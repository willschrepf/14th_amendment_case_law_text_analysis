ROBINSON, SR.,\n                                    Appellant/Cross-appellee.\n\n\n                                SYLLABUS BY THE COURT\n\n\n1.\n       A constitution-based claim for venue change can arise under a theory of presumed\nor actual prejudice. Presumed prejudice occurs when pretrial publicity is so pervasive and\nprejudicial that there can be no expectation of an unbiased jury pool in the community. In\ndeciding whether to presume prejudice under the Sixth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, an appellate court considers seven factors: (1) media interference with\ncourtroom proceedings; (2) the magnitude and tone of the coverage; (3) the size and\ncharacteristics of the community in which the crime occurred; (4) the amount of time that\nelapsed between the crime and the trial; (5) the jury's verdict; (6) the impact of the crime\non the community; and (7) the effect, if any, of a codefendant's publicized decision to\nplead guilty. Actual prejudice occurs when the effect of pretrial publicity is so substantial\nas to taint the entire jury pool.\n\n\n2.\n       K.S.A. 22-2616(1) compels a venue change when the district judge is satisfied that\nthere exists in the county where the prosecution is pending so great a prejudice against\nthe defendant that he or she cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in that county. The\n\n                                               1\n\fcourt considers nine factors in deciding whether community prejudice warrants a change\nof venue under K.S.A. 22-2616(1): (1) the particular degree to which the publicity\ncirculated throughout the community; (2) the degree to which the publicity or that of a\nlike nature circulated to other areas to which venue could be changed; (3) the length of\ntime which elapsed from the dissemination of the publicity to the date of trial; (4) the care\nexercised and the ease encountered in the selection of the jury; (5) the familiarity with the\npublicity complained of and its resultant effects, if any, upon the prospective jurors or the\ntrial jurors; (6) the challenges exercised by the defendant in the selection of the jury, both\nperemptory and for cause; (7) the connection of government officials with the release of\nthe publicity; (8) the severity of the offense charged; and (9) the particular size of the area\nfrom which the venire is drawn.\n\n\n3.\n       The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution guarantee\ncriminal defendants the right to counsel of choice, and due process prohibits judicial\nofficers from punishing or retaliating against a defendant for exercising this right.\n\n\n4.\n       Not every restriction on counsel's time or opportunity to investigate or to consult\nwith his or her client or to otherwise prepare for trial violates a defendant's Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel. Only an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon\nexpeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay violates the right to counsel,\nand this right cannot be manipulated to impede the efficient administration of justice.\n\n\n5.\n       Pursuant to K.S.A. 22-3401, continuances may be granted to either party for good\ncause shown. In a criminal case, the decision to continue a case lies within the sound\ndiscretion of the district court, but where a defendant claims the denial of continuance\n                                              2\n\finterfered with his or her ability to present a defense, an appellate court reviews the\nquestion de novo.\n\n\n6.\n       Where a continuance is sought to retain new counsel, a trial court considers the\nfollowing five factors: (1) whether a continuance would inconvenience witnesses, the\ncourt, counsel, or the parties; (2) whether other continuances have been granted; (3)\nwhether legitimate reasons exist for the delay; (4) whether the delay is the fault of the\ndefendant; and (5) whether denial of a continuance would prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n7.\n       The five factors used to consider a request for a continuance for the purpose of\nretaining new counsel do not apply in situations where one of several defense attorneys\nwithdraws from the case and the defendant seeks a continuance to provide the remaining\nmembers of the defense team additional time to prepare for trial but does not seek new\ncounsel.\n\n\n8.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying requests for a\ncontinuance to provide appointed counsel, two experienced death penalty litigators,\nadditional time to prepare a guilt phase defense following the withdrawal of retained\ncounsel, where appointed counsel had represented defendant for nearly 7 months prior to\nretained counsel's withdrawal; appointed counsel still had another 7 months to prepare\nbecause the district judge had granted a previous, lengthy continuance; appointed counsel\nhad the benefit of the work prepared by their predecessors over the course of nearly 2\nyears; appointed counsel had adequate resources, including the two lead attorneys and\ntheir two associate attorneys, one of whom entered his appearance following the\n\n\n                                               3\n\fwithdrawal of retained counsel, an investigator, and several assistants; and defendant\nnever sought appointment of new counsel following retained counsel's withdrawal.\n\n\n9.\n       When requesting a continuance to provide defendant additional time to develop a\nmitigation defense for the penalty phase of a capital murder trial, defendant must make an\nadequate proffer as to what mitigation evidence would be developed if relief were\ngranted.\n\n\n10.\n       The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that search\nwarrants be issued by a neutral and detached magistrate.\n\n\n11.\n       The United States Supreme Court has recognized at least two circumstances in\nwhich a magistrate fails to satisfy the neutral and detached requirement. First, a\nmagistrate who is involved in or who exercises law enforcement powers of the executive\nbranch lacks neutrality and detachment. Second, a magistrate with a direct pecuniary\ninterest in the outcome of the warrant proceedings also lacks neutrality and detachment.\n\n\n12.\n       In assessing whether a magistrate lacks neutrality and detachment, an appellate\ncourt considers whether the circumstances would offer a possible temptation to the\naverage judge to abandon the correct balance of consideration between the State and the\naccused. In applying this standard, it conducts an individualized and contextual inquiry,\nin light of the totality of the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f13.\n       The circumstances here—when the issuing magistrate had prosecuted the\ndefendant 15 years earlier for unrelated financial crimes—do not establish a violation of\nthe neutral and detached magistrate requirement. The magistrate had disengaged\ncompletely from law enforcement, had no involvement in any subsequent investigation or\nprosecution of the defendant, and had no knowledge of the defendant's possible\ninvolvement in other missing persons investigations; the former prosecution and current\ncapital murder investigation did not arise from a common investigation or single\ntransaction or event; and any overlapping facts between the magistrate's former\nprosecution of defendant and the current investigation were not probative of the probable\ncause determinations made by the magistrate.\n\n\n14.\n       When K.S.A. 22-2503 and K.S.A. 22-2505 are read together and considered\nalongside legislative amendments subsequent to the 1970 codification of the Kansas\nCode of Criminal Procedure, it is evident the legislature intended that district judges\nretain their pre-Code authority to issue search warrants executable statewide.\n\n\n15.\n       In this case, Lenexa police exercised \"their powers as law enforcement officers\"\nby planning, coordinating, and executing trash pulls from the defendant's Olathe\nresidence over the course of several weeks in furtherance of their investigation, and this\nactivity exceeded the officers' territorial jurisdiction pursuant to K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(a).\n\n\n16.\n       When a defendant seeks to suppress evidence based on a violation of state law\nunrelated to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or § 15 of the\n\n\n                                              5\n\fKansas Constitution Bill of Rights, application of the exclusionary rule does not\ninevitably follow.\n\n\n17.\n       K.S.A. 22-3216(1) provides a vehicle for defendants aggrieved by an unlawful\nsearch and seizure to move to suppress evidence, but it does not compel the trial court to\ngrant such relief for any search conducted in violation of state law.\n\n\n18.\n       The limitation on the territorial jurisdiction of city officers was intended to protect\nthe local autonomy of neighboring cities and counties, not to create an individual right.\n\n\n19.\n       Where, as here, a search is conducted in violation of state law and the statute\nviolated does not vest the defendant with an individual right, does not contemplate\nexclusion of evidence as a remedy, and its violation results in no cognizable injury to\ndefendant's substantial rights, suppression of the evidence is not an appropriate remedy.\n\n\n20.\n       A written request for assistance directed to officers in other jurisdictions that is\nsigned by an officer from the requesting jurisdiction—Linn County in this case—satisfies\nthe requirements of K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(b) and confers jurisdiction upon officers from\nother jurisdictions to execute a search warrant in Linn County.\n\n\n21.\n       K.S.A. 22-2401a(5) authorizes law enforcement officers in Johnson County to\nexecute search warrants countywide. Based on the plain language of this statute,\nreinforced by the context and history giving rise to its enactment, Lenexa and Overland\n                                              6\n\fPark city police had territorial jurisdiction to execute warrants to search defendant's\nresidence and storage unit located within the city limits of Olathe.\n\n\n22.\n       On the facts presented here, law enforcement officers did not search or seize trash\nwithin the curtilage of defendant's home and defendant did not have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in his discarded trash, when it had been set out for collection near\nthe end of an asphalt parking area, against the curb line, and approximately 10 to 12 feet\noutside of a fence that surrounded his residence.\n\n\n23.\n       The Kansas Wiretap Act requires prosecutors seeking to intercept telephonic\ncommunications to make a showing of necessity for this extraordinary investigative tool\nby including in the wiretap application a complete statement on whether other\ninvestigative procedures have been tried and failed or on why other methods reasonably\nappear to be dangerous or unlikely to succeed if tried.\n\n\n24.\n       The purpose of the necessity requirement for a wiretap is to assure that\nwiretapping is not resorted to in situations where traditional investigative techniques\nwould suffice to expose a crime and to prevent law enforcement from using wiretaps as a\nfirst step in an investigation.\n\n\n25.\n       General allegations and boilerplate language fail to satisfy the necessity\nrequirement for a wiretap. However, an appellate court employs a standard of\nreasonableness to evaluate the State's good-faith effort to use alternative investigative\nmeans or its failure to do so because of danger or a low probability of success. Law\n                                              7\n\fenforcement officers are not required to exhaust every possible technique before resorting\nto a wiretap—they must instead demonstrate that wiretapping is not the first meaningful\nstep in the investigation.\n\n\n26.\n       In this case, general language in the State's wiretap application that the use of\nsearch warrants would not further the goals of the investigation did not violate the\nnecessity requirement, where the application and supporting affidavit demonstrated that\nlaw enforcement made a reasonable good-faith effort to utilize other available normal and\nless intrusive investigative techniques before resorting to a wiretap, and a general\nstatement regarding the ineffectiveness of search warrants was supported by\nparticularized, case-specific information contained throughout the application and\naffidavit.\n\n\n27.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate the defendant's\nsubstantive rights under state or federal law in limiting voir dire on certain case-specific\nfacts where the defendant had the opportunity to formulate his own case-specific\nquestions in the juror questionnaire; the defense disclosed sensitive case-specific facts\nduring small group voir dire and inquired whether such facts rendered panelists biased;\ndefendant was allowed to question panelists during general voir dire on case-specific\nevidence anticipated at trial; and the district judge limited voir dire only when the\nquestions required prospective jurors to prejudge the penalty issue based on a general\ndescription of case-specific facts.\n\n\n28.\n       The heightened reliability standard applied in death penalty appeals does not bar\nthe application of the invited error doctrine.\n                                                 8\n\f29.\n       In capital murder trials, a prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of\nhis or her death penalty views if those views prevent or substantially impair the\nperformance of his or her duties as a juror. The same standard applies whether the\nchallenge is directed at death-leaning or life-leaning jurors.\n\n\n30.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's\nchallenges for cause of veniremembers who expressed support or favor for the death\npenalty. All of the veniremembers at issue professed their understanding of and fidelity to\nthe law, and the district judge's rulings were fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n31.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's\nchallenges for cause of veniremembers who were allegedly biased by pretrial publicity.\nThe record fairly supports the district judge's findings that the veniremembers at issue\ncould set their opinions aside, adhere to the court's instructions, and render a verdict\nbased on the evidence.\n\n\n32.\n       In this case, the trial court did not apply a more lenient standard of qualification to\njurors who supported the death penalty, in violation of defendant's substantive due\nprocess rights. The record confirms the district judge's rulings were supported by the voir\ndire testimony of the veniremembers at issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f33.\n       When improper or prejudicial remarks are made by one veniremember and heard\nby other veniremembers during the jury selection process, the test of juror impartiality is\nwhether those jurors actually seated can lay aside their impressions or opinions and\nrender a verdict based on the evidence.\n\n\n34.\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case in failing to strike all\npanelists on a small group panel exposed to a juror's inflammatory comments about the\ndefendant when the juror's comments were isolated and not founded on any specialized\nknowledge; the defendant failed to pursue curative measures; and the only panelist to\neventually serve on the jury declared his impartiality.\n\n\n35.\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case in granting the State's\nchallenge of a juror who expressed strong opposition to the death penalty when she\nconsistently expressed uncertainty about her ability to fairly consider both sentencing\noptions.\n\n\n36.\n       An appellate court employs a two-part balancing test in analyzing the propriety of\na district court's use of an anonymous jury identification system. First, there must be a\nreason to protect the jurors from identification, a decision left to the trial court's\ndiscretion. Second, the court must take reasonable precautions to minimize any\nprejudicial effects.\n\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f37.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate the defendant's\nsubstantial rights by employing a juror numbering system to identify veniremembers and\nseated jurors when the district judge identified the potential for invasion of juror privacy\nby the media or other overzealous individuals, particularly in the absence of\nsequestration, as the reason for the system and expressly informed the jury that the\nprocedure was unrelated to juror safety.\n\n\n38.\n       To establish the existence of a common scheme or course of conduct pursuant to\nK.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), the State must show that the alleged intentional and premeditated\nmurders are related to one another in some way.\n\n\n39.\n       In this case, evidence that the defendant lured his victims with promises of\nfinancial gain, employment, or travel; exploited them sexually or financially; used similar\nmethods to murder them and dispose of their bodies; and used similar methods of\ndeception to conceal the crimes was sufficient to support the jury's finding of the\nexistence of a common scheme or course of conduct.\n\n\n40.\n       In this case, the entirety of the defendant's course of conduct, which straddled the\ndate of enactment of the capital murder statute, could be considered and was sufficient to\nsupport the defendant's convictions on the capital murder charges under K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) when at least one of the elements of the charged offense was not committed\nuntil after the enactment of the capital murder statute.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f41.\n       When, as here, a defendant is charged and convicted of two counts of capital\nmurder, those convictions are multiplicitous when the State alleged and proved that all of\nthe murders were connected by the same common scheme or course of conduct and the\nState did not allege or prove the existence of a separate, distinct common scheme or\ncourse of conduct for each capital count.\n\n\n42.\n       A conviction for first-degree murder of one of the victims included in a series of\nmurders alleged under a separate charge of capital murder is multiplicitous with a\nconviction on the charge of capital murder.\n\n\n43.\n       The State's complaint was not defective and did not fail to confer jurisdiction on\nthe district court in this case because the complaint as a whole was clear what the charges\nwere and that defendant was the person charged.\n\n\n44.\n       The failure to lodge a contemporaneous objection to the admission of evidence\ntypically forecloses subsequent challenge on appeal. However, in capital murder appeals,\nK.S.A. 21-4627(b), recodified as K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 21-6619(b), compels review of any\nissue raised in defendant's brief, even if not preserved below. Yet this statute does not\nrequire this court to treat the record other than as it is presented to us on appeal, and we\napproach such compulsory review mindful that the defendant bears the burden of\ndemonstrating error on the record submitted.\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f45.\n       Accurate printouts of e-mails are akin to duplicate originals and deemed valid\nreproductions of electronically stored information for best evidence purposes under\nK.S.A. 60-467(a), even when messages have been forwarded or contain message strings.\n\n\n46.\n       E-mail exhibits found in a defendant's possession or under his or her control and\nseized pursuant to a search warrant can be authenticated by law enforcement officers'\ntestimony describing the circumstances in which the writings were seized.\n\n\n47.\n       Testimony that merely suggests a defendant intended to commit a crime falls\noutside the scope of K.S.A. 60-455. The evidentiary restriction is triggered by evidence\nthat a person actually committed a crime or civil wrong on a specified occasion, not by\nspeculation.\n\n\n48.\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case in allowing a detective to\ntestify to the number of tools seized during the search of the defendant's property when\nthe record establishes a logical connection between the tools, the defendant, and the\ncapital murder charges.\n\n\n49.\n       The trial court properly refused to grant a mistrial in this case after a witness'\ntestimony deviated from the State's proffer when the district judge instructed the jury to\ndisregard the testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f50.\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case in allowing a medical\nexaminer to testify that a fracture to a victim's right ulna was consistent with a defensive\ninjury when the evidence established the expert's qualifications to render such an opinion.\n\n\n51.\n       In this case, the State offered sufficient evidence that the defendant took the victim\nnamed in the aggravated kidnapping charge by way of deception with the specific intent\nto inflict bodily injury upon her.\n\n\n52.\n        Because the State's two theories as to how the defendant took the victim named in\nthe aggravated kidnapping charge by deception could support but one conviction, the\nState did not rely on multiple acts in this case.\n\n\n53.\n       The prosecutor erred in this case by suggesting a victim may have witnessed her\nmother's murder before her own demise, but the isolated remarks did not prejudice the\ndefendant.\n\n\n54.\n       The prosecutor erred in this case by asserting that the defendant ripped one\nvictim's baby out of her arms, but the remark did not prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n55.\n       The phrases \"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\" are commonly understood\nand require no specific definition in jury instructions under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). The\n\n\n                                              14\n\flack of a statutory definition for the phrases \"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\"\ndoes not render the capital murder statute unconstitutionally vague.\n\n\n56.\n       In this case, the trial court's instruction on venue was error, but the defendant\nfailed to establish that the jury would have reached a different verdict had the instruction\nerror not occurred.\n\n\n57.\n       In this case, the cumulative effect of the identified guilt phase errors did not\nsubstantially prejudice defendant or deny him a right to a fair trial.\n\n\n58.\n       In this case, there is no reasonable possibility that a juror's use of a Bible during\npenalty phase deliberations affected the jury's sentencing decision when the juror\nconsulted the Bible only outside of deliberations, he did not use or read from the Bible in\nthe jury room, he made an isolated remark about the Bible only after the jury's vote had\nconfirmed its unanimity as to sentence, and the district judge delivered a curative\ninstruction.\n\n\n59.\n       In this case, the State's evidence demonstrated a nexus between defendant's killing\nof more than one person and the charged capital offenses and was sufficient to establish\nthe existence of the multiple murder aggravating circumstance under K.S.A. 21-4625(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f60.\n       The prosecutor's closing argument comment on the defendant's demeanor was\nerror in this case, but it did not prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n61.\n       The prosecutor's statement in this case that he would \"bet\" the victims' families\nwould not agree that defendant posed a low risk of violence in prison was error, but it did\nnot prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n62.\n       In this case, the prosecutor's interrupted personalized attack of defense counsel's\nargument was error, but it did not prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n63.\n        The penalty phase instructions in this case did not create an unreasonable risk that\njurors would fail to recognize that they must find that aggravating factors outweighed\nmitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt in order to impose a death sentence.\n\n\n64.\n       The penalty phase instructions in this case made clear that mitigating\ncircumstances were to be determined by each individual juror and did not need to be\nfound by all members of the jury in order to be considered by an individual juror.\n\n\n65.\n       The penalty phase instructions in this case did not encourage a death verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f66.\n        The penalty phase instructions in this case did not undermine the jury's historic\nnullification power or otherwise create a reasonable likelihood that jurors would have\napplied instructions in a way that prevented consideration of constitutionally relevant\nevidence.\n\n\n67.\n        The defendant was not improperly sentenced under a void capital sentencing\nscheme under the facts in this case.\n\n\n68.\n        In this case, the cumulative effect of the identified errors during the penalty phase\ndid not substantially prejudice the defendant or deny him the right to a fair penalty phase\nproceeding.\n\n\n69.\n        In this case, the trial court erred by designating Counts I through III as sexually\nmotivated in the journal entry of judgment where the State did not seek such a\ndesignation and the district judge did not make supporting findings when pronouncing the\nsentence from the bench.\n\n\n        Appeal from Johnson District Court; JOHN ANDERSON III, judge.

Obermeier, senior deputy district attorney, and Jacob M. Gontesky, assistant district\nattorney, argued the cause, and Christopher L. McMullin, chief deputy district attorney, Stephen M.\n\n                                                    17\n\fHowe, district attorney, Natalie Chalmers, assistant solicitor general, Kristafer Ailslieger, deputy solicitor\ngeneral, and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, were with them on the briefs for appellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\n\n\n        STEGALL, J.: John E. Robinson, Sr., was charged with multiple offenses related to\nthe murders of six women—killings that constituted parts of a common scheme or course\nof conduct whereby Robinson would lure women to Johnson County with offers of\nemployment, travel, and other benefits; exploit them sexually, financially, or otherwise;\nkill them and dispose of their bodies in a similar manner; and engage in various acts of\nfraud, deceit, and manipulation to conceal his crimes. This common scheme or course of\nconduct began in the mid-1980s and continued until Robinson's arrest in June 2000.\n\n\n        The State charged Robinson with two counts of capital murder, one count for the\nintentional, premeditated murder of Suzette Marie Trouten (Count II) and the other for\nthe intentional, premeditated murder of Izabela Lewicka (Count III). The State alleged,\npursuant to K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), that the murders of Trouten and Lewicka were each\npart of a common scheme or course of conduct that also included the intentional,\npremeditated murders of Beverly J. Bonner, Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith, and Lisa Stasi.\n\n\n        The State also charged Robinson with aggravated kidnapping of Trouten (Count\nI), theft of Vicki Neufeld's property (Count IV), first-degree premeditated murder of Lisa\nStasi (Count V), and aggravated interference with Stasi's parental custody (Count VI).\nThe jury convicted Robinson on all counts.\n\n\n        Following the guilt phase trial, a separate sentencing proceeding was held pursuant\nto K.S.A. 21-4624(b). The penalty phase jury sentenced Robinson to death on each\ncapital murder conviction and that sentence was imposed by the trial court. Additionally,\n\n                                                     18\n\fthe trial court sentenced Robinson to 246 months in prison for the aggravated kidnapping\nof Trouten, 7 months for the theft of Neufeld's property, a life sentence with parole\neligibility after 15 years for the first-degree premeditated murder of Stasi, and a pre-\nsentencing guidelines sentence of 5 to 20 years or a postsentencing guidelines sentence of\n13 months for the aggravated interference with Stasi's parental custody.\n\n\n       On appeal, Robinson has raised 19 general claims of reversible error covering the\nentire proceeding below. Within these general claims, Robinson asserts a variety of sub-\nclaims. For simplicity, we number the general issues consecutively and address all claims\narising under each category. At the outset, we take the unusual step of noting that our\nreview of this matter—given its size and complexity—has been assisted and facilitated by\nthe diligence and professionalism of the trial judge, Judge Anderson, throughout the\nproceedings below. Moreover, the decision we announce today is in large part a product\nof Judge Anderson's conscientious commitment to Robinson's fair trial rights.\n\n\n               FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND – GUILT PHASE\n\n       Resolution of Robinson's claims on this appeal demands a comprehensive review\nof the disturbing facts underlying his convictions and sentences.\n\n\nJohn Robinson, Sr.\n\n       Robinson was a self-employed, but not entirely successful, entrepreneur. In the\n1970s, he formed Hydro-Gro, Inc., a company that produced hydroponic vegetables. In\nthe 1980s, Robinson offered financial consulting services through his company Equi II.\nHis operations were interrupted when he was convicted of a nonperson felony and\nincarcerated at the Western Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron, Missouri.\nFollowing his release in the 1990s until his arrest, Robinson published a mobile home\n\n                                             19\n\ftrade magazine called Manufactured Modular Home Living through his company\nSpecialty Publications.\n\n\n       Robinson lived with his wife Nancy in a three-bedroom modular home in Olathe,\ninside Santa Barbara Estates—a large mobile home community. Robinson used\ncomputers and e-mail extensively and also utilized a cell phone and pager. Nancy began\nworking as the on-site office manager at Santa Barbara Estates in 1997.\n\n\n       In the mid-1990s, Robinson acquired roughly 17 acres of property at a secluded\nLinn County location. He moved a trailer onto the property in July 1998 and installed two\nphone lines: one for his landline and one for his computer.\n\n\n       Though married to Nancy since 1964, Robinson's infidelity was an ongoing issue\nin their marriage. In 1998, Nancy learned her husband was involved in bondage and\ndiscipline, dominance and submission, sadism, and masochism (BDS&M) activities after\ndiscovering fetish websites saved in his Internet browser history. Robinson shared stories\nof his BDS&M liaisons with Carlos Ibarra, a maintenance employee at Santa Barbara\nEstates, and showed him nude photographs of a girlfriend depicted in BDS&M poses.\n\n\nRobinson's Victims\n\n       The State's capital murder theory in Counts II and III was that Robinson killed\nSuzette Trouten and Izabela Lewicka, along with Sheila and Debbie Faith, Beverly\nBonner and Lisa Stasi, and that these killings were all connected, constituting parts of a\ncommon scheme or course of conduct characterized by: (1) luring women with offers of\nemployment, travel, and other benefits; (2) exploiting them financially, sexually, or\notherwise; (3) killing them and disposing of their bodies in a similar manner; and (4)\nconcealing the crimes through acts of deception and fraud. The State alleged Robinson\n\n                                             20\n\fcommitted other crimes along the way, including the aggravated kidnapping of Trouten,\ntheft of Neufeld's property, first-degree murder of Stasi, and aggravated interference with\nStasi's parental custody.\n\n\n       1. Suzette Marie Trouten\n\n       Suzette Marie Trouten was the youngest of Carolyn and Harry Trouten's five\nchildren. She lived near her mother in the Monroe, Michigan, area. The two were\nextremely close and talked daily, even when Trouten was away.\n\n\n       Unbeknownst to her mother, Trouten was active in the BDS&M community. She\nfrequented BDS&M websites and chat rooms, created her own BDS&M web page, and\ntraveled out of state for BDS&M trysts.\n\n\n       In the mid-1990s, Trouten met Lore Remington, a Canadian resident who shared\nTrouten's interest in BDS&M role playing games. Remington trained Trouten as a\n\"slave,\" the submissive partner in a BDS&M relationship, for these online games, and the\ntwo became close friends. Remington introduced Trouten to her friend, Tami Taylor, who\nalso lived in Canada, shared an interest in BDS&M, and became another friend.\n\n\n       Trouten placed personal ads on BDS&M websites seeking a position as a \"slave.\"\nAt that point, Trouten and Robinson began communicating by e-mail. In summer 1999,\nTrouten told her mother that Robinson had offered her a job caring for his elderly father,\n\"Papa John.\" Trouten said Robinson and his father were selling off several companies\nand Papa John needed nursing care as they traveled to various locations to close the deals.\nTrouten said the job would pay $60,000 annually and require extensive travel to places\nsuch as Switzerland and Belgium.\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f       In October 1999, Trouten traveled to Kansas City, telling her mother she had an\ninterview with Robinson. When she returned a few days later, Trouten told her mother\nshe did not like the idea of being away from home but had decided to take the job for 1\nyear to earn enough money to return to school. Trouten took a second trip to Kansas in\nNovember, explaining she had to sign an employment contract and find a place to live.\n\n\n       Trouten shared the news of her employment opportunity with other friends and\nfamily. She told Taylor she would be working for a man named John, who needed\nsomeone to care for his elderly father, a wealthy businessman, while they traveled to\nEurope and other destinations throughout the United States. Trouten told Remington she\nwould earn $6,500 per month and travel to places such as Australia and Hawaii working\nfor Robinson. Trouten gave similar reports to her aunt, father, and employer in Michigan.\n\n\n       In late 1999 and early 2000, Trouten prepared for the move to Kansas and her\nupcoming travels. She researched colleges and other learning opportunities in\nSwitzerland and Belgium, telling her mother that Robinson said they would be overseas\nlong enough for her to take classes. Trouten completed a passport application. Just before\nTrouten left, her aunt, Marshalla Chidester, helped Trouten create a list of her friends' and\nfamily's contact information.\n\n\n       On or about February 12, 2000, Trouten left for Kansas, bringing along her two\nbeloved Pekingese dogs, Peka and Harry, in the moving truck Robinson had rented for\nher. On February 14, Trouten arrived and checked into Room 216 at the Guesthouse\nSuites in Lenexa. Robinson had reserved this room for 7 nights under his company's\nname, Specialty Publications. The reservation was later extended for an additional week.\n\n\n       When Trouten checked into her room, hotel staff informed her of their no-pet\npolicy. On February 16, Robinson brought two Pekingese dogs, one named Harry and the\n                                             22\n\fother named Peka, for boarding at Ridgeview Animal Hospital in Olathe. Robinson said\nthe dogs belonged to his employee. In completing check-in paperwork, Robinson\nindicated the dogs would be boarded through the end of February.\n\n\n       Once in Kansas, Trouten called her mother almost every day. Trouten told her\nmother she had decided to put her belongings in storage, rather than find an apartment\nimmediately, because she and Robinson would be leaving on their trip soon. Trouten also\nsaid their itinerary had changed. Rather than travel to Switzerland as originally planned,\nthey had decided to go to California, pick up Robinson's new yacht, and sail to Hawaii\nfirst, so Robinson could relax before resuming his meetings.\n\n\n       Trouten and Remington continued to communicate daily on ICQ, an instant\nmessaging program on Yahoo. In these conversations, Trouten disclosed that she was in a\nsexual relationship with Robinson. At trial, Robinson conceded that he and Trouten had\ncarried on a sexual, BDS&M relationship. The fact of this relationship was corroborated\nby other evidence at trial, including several e-mails in which they discussed BDS&M; a\n\"slave\" contract signed by Trouten, purportedly governing the terms of their master/slave\nrelationship; and a videotape of the two engaging in BDS&M sex.\n\n\n       The timeline of events on March 1 implicated Robinson in Trouten's\ndisappearance. Around 1 a.m. on March 1, Trouten called her mother at work and said\nshe and Robinson were leaving on their trip later that morning. Carolyn Trouten never\nsaw or spoke to her daughter again.\n\n\n       Trouten and Remington were also communicating via ICQ chat early that\nmorning. Remington ended her chat session with Trouten at 12:51 a.m. Remington never\nsaw or spoke to Trouten again.\n\n\n                                            23\n\f       At 11:43 a.m., a long-distance call was placed from Robinson's Linn County\ntrailer to Nancy Robinson's work phone.\n\n\n       At 2:13 p.m., Robinson picked up Trouten's dogs at the animal clinic in Olathe.\nEmployees said Robinson appeared to be agitated and in a hurry. He told one employee\nhe was in a rush to get to the airport. Robinson placed the dogs in a small kennel and left.\nTrouten was not seen with Robinson or in his truck at the animal clinic.\n\n\n       At 2:24 p.m., Robinson's access code was used to gain entry through the security\ngates at his Olathe storage unit, and the code was used to exit the facility 6 minutes later.\n\n\n       At 2:35 p.m., Olathe animal control officer Rodney E. McClain was dispatched to\nSanta Barbara Estates after Robinson had instructed the office assistant to report two\ndogs on the loose. McClain arrived 10 minutes later and saw two Pekingese dogs inside a\nsmall-medium-sized carrying kennel located just outside the office. Both appeared to be\nin good condition. McClain transported them to the local shelter. Trouten never claimed\nher dogs.\n\n\n       Around 3 p.m., Isabel Clark, a housekeeper at the Guesthouse Suites,\nobserved a man matching Robinson's general physical description loading\nTrouten's belongings from Room 216 into a truck matching the description of\nRobinson's vehicle in the hotel parking lot. When she cleaned the room, Clark\nnoticed the linens and towels were stained with blood. However, she had observed\nsimilar blood stains when she cleaned the room throughout Trouten's stay. Trouten\nhad an irregular menstrual cycle and would bleed heavily. Trouten told Remington\nthat she was experiencing a particularly long and heavy period at the end of\nFebruary.\n\n\n                                             24\n\f       Around 3:30 p.m., a hotel security camera captured Robinson checking out\nof Trouten's room. Hotel staff confirmed Robinson was the person who checked\nout of the room and paid the bill. Trouten was not with Robinson at the time, and\nhotel employees did not see her at all on March 1.\n\n\n       A few days after Trouten had supposedly left for California, Carolyn Trouten\nreceived a letter from her daughter. Its arrival was somewhat unusual, as Trouten\ntypically called her mother and did not write letters. The letter arrived in a pink envelope\npostmarked from Kansas City on March 6, 2000. The envelope was addressed to Carolyn\nTrouten, and the return address said only \"Suzette Trouten.\" The handwritten letter was\ndated February 28, 2000, and discussed Trouten's plans to leave for California with\nRobinson. Carolyn Trouten believed the handwriting on the envelope and letter was her\ndaughter's. However, she found it unusual the envelope was postmarked Kansas City on\nMarch 6 because Trouten said they were leaving on March 1. Suzette's father, who lived\nin Florida, received a similar handwritten letter dated February 28, 2000, in an envelope\npostmarked Kansas City on March 6, 2000.\n\n\n       Suspicious of the postmark date, Carolyn Trouten called Robinson, who said\nTrouten had decided not to take the job. Robinson claimed she had met a man named Jim\nTurner and left town with him. Jim Turner was one of Robinson's aliases.\n\n\n       A few weeks after receiving the first handwritten letter, Carolyn Trouten received\na second letter purportedly written by her daughter in an envelope postmarked from San\nJose, California. This time, the letter was typewritten with Trouten's name signed in\ncursive at the bottom. Trouten's mother believed the signature was Trouten's. The letter\nopened with the statement: \"Well, I'm off on an adventure of a lifetime.\" Carolyn\nTrouten was convinced Trouten did not draft the letter because the language, style,\nwording, and typewritten format were wholly inconsistent with her daughter's writing.\n                                             25\n\f       Just before her April 9 birthday, Trouten's grandmother received a birthday card\npurportedly written by Trouten. The card was in a green envelope postmarked San Jose,\nCalifornia, on March 27, 2000. Trouten's aunt, Chidester, believed the mailing address on\nthe envelope was written in Trouten's handwriting but that the \"S. Trouten\" written in the\nreturn address section of the envelope was not. Trouten's father also received a similar\ntypewritten letter in an envelope postmarked San Jose, California, March 27, 2000.\n\n\n       Unbeknownst to Trouten's family, Robinson had made arrangements in late March\n2000 for Jean Glines to mail several letters for him from California. Glines was a former\nemployee of Nancy Robinson, who maintained a long-distance relationship with\nRobinson by telephone and e-mail after she moved to California in 1997. Robinson asked\nGlines to mail some letters for him from California as a favor. Glines, who had grown\ntired of the relationship with Robinson, agreed to mail the letters if Robinson stopped\ncalling her. Glines received a package containing three pastel-colored envelopes from\nRobinson on March 27. Glines noticed some of the letters were addressed to a person in\n\"Minnesota or Michigan,\" and there was no return address, only the name \"Sue,\"\n\"Suzette,\" or the initials \"ST.\" Glines mailed the letters that day from Milpitas, where all\nmail is sent to and postmarked San Jose, California.\n\n\n       Several weeks later, Trouten's family received a number of letters purportedly\nauthored by Trouten in envelopes postmarked Veracruz, Mexico, on May 19, 2000.\nTrouten's aunt, Chidester, received one of these letters. She believed the address on the\nenvelope was written by Trouten, but the return address was not. The letter was\ntypewritten and dated May 5, 2000. It discussed Trouten's travels and was signed, \"Love\nyou, Suzette.\" Chidester believed Trouten signed the letter, but she was convinced\nTrouten did not draft it because the punctuation, style, and organization were not\n\n\n                                             26\n\fcharacteristic of Trouten's writing. Trouten's niece, her grandmother, and her father\nreceived similar letters postmarked May 19 from Veracruz, Mexico.\n\n\n       Once again, unbeknownst to Trouten's family, Robinson had made arrangements\nfor several letters to be mailed from Mexico in May 2000. Lidia Ponce lived in Veracruz,\nMexico. Her son, Carlos Ibarra, was a maintenance employee at Santa Barbara Estates\nand did side jobs for Robinson. Ponce traveled to Olathe to visit her son at the beginning\nof May. Robinson asked Ibarra to have his mother mail several letters from a resort when\nshe returned to Mexico. Robinson gave Ibarra several pastel-colored envelopes, which\nIbarra gave to his mother. Ponce returned to Mexico around May 10 and mailed the\nletters from a hotel in Veracruz several days later after writing the sender's initials on the\nenvelopes as Robinson had instructed. At trial, Ponce examined the envelopes Trouten's\nfamily had received and said they were consistent with the ones she had mailed from\nVeracruz and that the writing on the return address appeared to be her own.\n\n\n       When law enforcement officers searched Robinson's storage unit in Olathe, they\nfound the contact list that Chidester helped Trouten create before moving to Kansas. This\nlist included the mailing addresses and, for some, birthday information for Trouten's\nfamily members. The officers also seized a clear plastic folder containing 42 envelopes\npreaddressed to members of Trouten's family, along with 31 pieces of pastel-colored\nstationary with \"Love you, Suzette\" signed at the bottom. The officers also found over a\ndozen pastel-colored envelopes with enclosed greeting cards and envelopes inside a\nplastic Target sack. These envelopes were preaddressed to members of Trouten's family,\nwith \"S. Trouten\" written in the return address and the individual's birthday written in the\nupper-right corner where postage is typically placed. There were also several letters with\ngeneric greetings such as \"Hi, dad\" or \"Hi, mom\" handwritten at the top of stationary,\nalong with a number of blank envelopes, stationary, and greeting cards.\n\n\n                                              27\n\f         This was not the first time Robinson had prepared or coordinated deceptive letter\nwriting campaigns. In fall 1997, Robinson met Aleisia Cox through a personal ad she\nplaced in a local magazine. Sometime in 1998, Robinson offered Cox a job traveling with\nhim on business trips to London, Paris, and Australia. Before their scheduled departure,\nhe directed Cox to write letters to her mother and daughter as though she had already\narrived at each of these destinations, explaining there would not be time to write family\nduring the trips. Cox complied, crafting letters to her mother and daughter that were\nwritten as though she were in Paris, London, and Australia. The trips never materialized,\nand police found Cox's letters during the search of Robinson's Olathe residence 2 years\nlater.\n\n\n         Robinson's concealment of Trouten's disappearance was not limited to written\ncorrespondence. On February 25, 2000, Robinson sent Trouten an e-mail message\nrequesting login and password information for all of her e-mail accounts. Trouten\nprovided the information in a reply e-mail. Robinson also had e-mail addresses for a\nnumber of Trouten's friends and family members.\n\n\n         On the morning of March 2, 2000, the day after Trouten's disappearance,\nRemington received an e-mail from Trouten's Hotmail account. The body of the message\nsaid Trouten and her dogs had left on \"the adventure of a lifetime.\" Remington responded\na few minutes later, sharing that she had ended the relationship with her former BDS&M\n\"master.\" Remington received a reply from Trouten's Hotmail account, referring\nRemington to a new \"master\" at \"eruditemaster@email.com.\" Remington contacted this\nnew \"master\" and began communicating with a man she came to know as Jim Turner.\n\n\n         On March 24, 2000, an e-mail from Trouten's Hotmail account was sent to several\nmembers of Trouten's family, including her aunt, Chidester; her sister, Kim Padilla; her\nbrother, Michael Trouten; and her father's girlfriend. The message said Trouten had\n                                             28\n\fwritten to her mother, that she had left on her trip, that she would not have online access\nfor some time, and that she would try to stay in touch when possible. Chidester was\nconvinced Trouten did not write the e-mail because the word choices, style, and format\nwere inconsistent with Trouten's writing. Chidester was also convinced Trouten would\nhave called her, rather than sending an e-mail, before leaving on such a trip. When law\nenforcement officers searched Robinson's Olathe storage unit several weeks later, they\nfound the e-mail addresses for all four recipients attached to the contact list Trouten had\nprepared with Chidester before moving to Kansas.\n\n\n       On April 27, 2000, Robinson, posing as Jim Turner, discussed Trouten's\ndisappearance in an e-mail to Remington, claiming that Trouten had stolen his credit\ncards and that he had hired a private investigator to look into it. He also asked Remington\nfor information on all of Trouten's previous BDS&M partners. After consulting with law\nenforcement, Remington provided the requested information via e-mail. Law\nenforcement officers found a printed copy of this e-mail chain in Robinson's possession\nduring the search of his Olathe storage locker several weeks later.\n\n\n       Robinson used e-mail not only to conceal Trouten's disappearance, but also to lure\nTrouten's friends into new BDS&M relationships. In March 2000, Remington told Taylor\nshe had been communicating with Jim Turner, who she initially believed to be a friend of\nTrouten's employer, Robinson. Taylor jokingly told Remington to ask Jim Turner\nwhether he had any single friends interested in a BDS&M relationship. Remington did\njust that, and Robinson, posing as Turner, said Taylor should contact \"Tom\" at\n\"preipo@usa.net.\"\n\n\n       Remington forwarded the name and e-mail address to Taylor, and Taylor sent\n\"Tom\" an e-mail discussing her interest in BDS&M. When law enforcement officers\nsearched Robinson's Olathe residence, they found a note with the \"preipo@usa.net\" e-\n                                             29\n\fmail address written on it. On March 17, 2000, Robinson, posing as Tom, responded to\nTaylor's e-mail, describing himself as a \"very aggressive and hard working businessman\"\nand outlining his ground rules for a BDS&M relationship. Taylor and Robinson, posing\nas \"Tom,\" continued to communicate and discuss BDS&M topics via e-mail. Robinson\nalso began calling Taylor. In one voicemail message, he told her he was changing his\n\"preipo@usa.net\" e-mail address to \"bdsm@hotmail.com.\" \"Tom\" told Taylor that she\nwould be well taken care of if she were his slave.\n\n\n       On May 28, 2000, Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\" sent Taylor an e-mail from his new\n\"bdsm\" Hotmail account, asking her to visit him in Kansas City. Unlike his earlier e-\nmails, \"Tom\" signed this e-mail as \"MASTER\"—the same way this name/title appeared\nin Robinson's other e-mail communications, including Robinson's February 25 e-mail to\nTrouten and Jim Turner's April 27 e-mail to Remington.\n\n\n       Before committing to a visit, Taylor asked \"Tom\" for a reference from a past\nslave, and Robinson, still posing as \"Tom,\" told Taylor she could contact one of his\nformer slaves at \"slavedancer@hotmail.com.\" Taylor e-mailed \"slavedancer\" seeking\ninformation about \"Tom\" as a master. On May 31, Taylor received a response from the\n\"slavedancer\" account, in which \"Tom\" was referred to as \"MASTER\" throughout. When\nlaw enforcement officers searched Robinson's Olathe residence 2 days later, they found a\nlist of e-mail addresses and passwords, including \"slavedancer@hotmail.com,\" written on\na sheet of legal paper. They also found e-mails confirming Robinson's registration of the\n\"slavedancer\" name on several e-mail servers. Taylor received no further e-mail after\nRobinson's arrest on June 2.\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\f       2. Izabela Lewicka\n\n       Izabela Lewicka was born in Poland on April 11, 1978. She moved to West\nLafayette, Indiana, with her family at the age of 11. She began studies at Purdue\nUniversity in fall 1996. She was interested in the arts and was an avid drawer and painter.\nAccording to friends, Lewicka also had a strong interest in several alternative lifestyles,\nincluding paganism, goth, and BDS&M.\n\n\n       In spring 1997, Lewicka told her friend, Jennifer Hayes, that an international book\nagent in Kansas City had offered her a job doing secretarial work and had commissioned\nher to illustrate BDS&M manuscripts. Lewicka said she planned to move to the Kansas\nCity area to be with this older, married man, who had also agreed to train her to become a\n\"dominant\" in BDS&M relationships. Lewicka told Hayes he wanted her to call him\n\"master\" and to maintain strict confidentiality. Lewicka seemed concerned when she\ninadvertently told Hayes her master was named John.\n\n\n       While attending Purdue, Lewicka became friends with Dawn Carter and often\nused her computer to access the Internet. Lewicka told Carter she had a job opportunity in\nKansas City illustrating and editing books. Lewicka said that a man named John, whom\nshe had met online, had a job and apartment for her and that they had plans to travel.\n\n\n       Lewicka told her parents she had a summer internship with a publishing company\nin Kansas City, and if it led to a job, she might stay longer, but she did not rule out the\npossibility of returning to Purdue for the fall 1997 semester. Lewicka said she would be\nliving at 9280 Metcalf in Overland Park and could be reached by e-mail.\n\n\n       On June 8, 1997, Lewicka left for Kansas in her car filled with belongings.\nLewicka's friends believed she moved to Kansas both for BDS&M training and work.\n\n                                              31\n\f       Once in Kansas, Robinson helped Lewicka establish herself. They leased a private\nmailbox at Mailboxes, Etc., located at 9280 Metcalf in Overland Park—the same address\nLewicka had given her parents. Both Lewicka and Robinson were authorized to access\nmail at the box. In October 1997, Robinson had his insurance agent write a 2-year auto\npolicy on Lewicka's vehicle, explaining she was an employee.\n\n\n       On November 14, Lewicka opened an account at Bank of America, where\nRobinson also held a business account for Specialty Publications.\n\n\n       In February 1998, Robinson contacted Jennifer Boniedot, a property manager for\nthe Deerfield Apartment Complex in Olathe. Robinson said he needed a corporate\napartment for employees he would train before they were transferred to positions out of\nstate. In the rental application, Robinson identified himself and Lewicka as the\nprospective occupants. He told Boniedot that he met Lewicka at a graphics trade show,\nthat she had been abused by her parents, and that he had adopted her. Robinson signed a\n1-year rental agreement, from March 1, 1998, to February 28, 1999. Robinson paid rent\nwith a Specialty Publications' check, and Lewicka occupied the apartment through the\nterm of the lease.\n\n\n       In January 1999, just before the Deerfield Apartment lease expired, Robinson\ncontacted Julie Brown, a manager for A.J. Lang Property Management, to find an\napartment. Robinson said he was in the publication business and needed a corporate\napartment for female employees he trained from across the country. Robinson executed a\nlease for a different apartment in Olathe (Edgebrook Apartment) for a term beginning\nJanuary 15, 1999, through January 31, 2000. Lewicka occupied the Edgebrook\nApartment, and Robinson paid the rent.\n\n\n                                            32\n\f       While in Kansas, Lewicka worked for Specialty Publications, handling advertising\ngraphics for Robinson's magazine. In 1998, Robinson told his publishing broker, Karen\nScott, he had hired his adopted daughter, Lewicka, as a graphic designer. Lewicka told\nPam Sadewhite, who owned a graphic arts company that did work for Robinson, that\nRobinson was her uncle, but Sadewhite saw them flirting and touching one another in a\nmanner that suggested otherwise.\n\n\n       Lewicka often held herself out as Robinson's wife. Lewicka registered for an\nintroductory drafting class at Johnson County Community College under the name\nIzabela Lewicka-Robinson and told her instructor that she was married to an older man.\nShe also identified herself as Izabela Robinson to employees of several local businesses.\n\n\n       Though not married, Lewicka and Robinson did share a BDS&M sexual\nrelationship, as evidenced by a BDS&M \"slave\" contract signed by Lewicka, along with\nnumerous nude photographs depicting her in BDS&M poses, seized from Robinson's\nOlathe storage unit. Nancy Robinson learned of her husband's relationship with Lewicka\nin 1997. She believed the relationship was different from Robinson's other affairs. In the\npast, when Nancy had learned of an affair, Robinson had ended it immediately. This time,\nthe relationship continued, and Nancy thought Robinson would leave her for Lewicka.\n\n\n       However, Lewicka disappeared sometime in late summer or fall 1999. Earlier that\nsummer, Robinson convinced another paramour, Barbara Sandre, to move from Canada\nto Kansas. On August 18, they executed a lease for an unfurnished duplex at Hunter's\nPointe, located on Grant Street in Overland Park (Grant Street Duplex). Sandre needed\nfurnishings for the duplex, and Robinson agreed to provide them. On August 23,\nRobinson hired a moving company to deliver household items from Lewicka's Edgebrook\nApartment to Sandre's Grant Street Duplex. Over the next 2 weeks, Robinson brought\n\n\n                                            33\n\fadditional furnishings, including bedding and pillows, blankets, kitchen utensils, artwork,\nand hundreds of books. Many of these items were later identified as Lewicka's property.\n\n\n       Robinson had also rekindled his relationship with Aleisha Cox earlier in 1999.\nLater that year, Cox was unemployed and did not have permanent housing, so Robinson\ninvited her to stay at Lewicka's Edgebrook Apartment. Cox testified the apartment was\nmostly vacant, but there were some boxes containing clothing and household items.\nRobinson told Cox the girl that had been living there quit her job and ran off with her\nboyfriend, leaving the clothes behind. Cox took some of the clothing, which was later\nidentified as Lewicka's. Cox declined Robinson's offer to stay at the apartment.\n\n\n       In September 1999, with several months remaining on the lease, Robinson\ndelivered September's rent for Lewicka's Edgebrook Apartment and notified the property\nmanager, Brown, that he had vacated the premises. Brown later inspected the unit and\nfound it to be mostly unkempt but noticed the two bedrooms had been cleaned\nmeticulously.\n\n\n       Law enforcement officers searched Lewicka's Edgebrook Apartment on October\n12, 2000. Detective Sally Lane, a forensic chemist with the Johnson County Crime Lab\n(JOCO Lab), found hundreds of small, reddish-brown spots on the wall of one bedroom\nthat presumptively tested positive for blood. The blood spots were roughly circular and\nless than 1 millimeter in diameter. The pattern of stains ran from floor to ceiling and\napproximately 4 to 5 feet in width, from the middle of the south wall all the way to the\neast wall, with the highest concentration at waist to chest level. Lane took swabs from a\nrepresentative sampling of the spots and submitted them to the Kansas City, Missouri,\nRegional Crime Lab (KCMO Lab) for further analysis, where Detective Frank Booth, a\nDNA analysist, confirmed the genetic profile from the samples matched Lewicka's DNA.\n\n\n                                             34\n\f       Other circumstantial evidence corroborated Lewicka's disappearance in late\nsummer or early fall 1999 and Robinson's involvement. In September, Robinson called\nhis publishing broker, Scott, looking for a new graphic designer. Robinson told Scott that\nLewicka had been caught smoking marijuana and deported to Czechoslovakia. On\nSeptember 1, a $500 check payable to Specialty Publications was drawn on Lewicka's\naccount, leaving an available balance of $1. On September 3, the insurance policy\nRobinson placed on Lewicka's vehicle lapsed because of nonpayment of premium.\n\n\n       After fall 1999, Lewicka was never seen at the local establishments she\npatronized. During her time in Kansas, she shopped at A. Friendly's bookstore on 25 to\n30 occasions. Lewicka stood out to the owner, Robert Meyers, because of her European\naccent and interest in books about witch trials, horror, vampires, and medicinal plants.\nSometime before winter 1999, Lewicka came to A. Friendly's with a man Meyers\nbelieved to be Robinson. Lewicka told Meyers she was moving and Robinson would be\nbuying her books after her move. Lewicka shopped there one more time prior to winter\n1999, and Meyers never saw her again.\n\n\n       As with other victims, family members received suspicious correspondence after\nLewicka disappeared. Lewicka's father exchanged 25 to 30 e-mails with his daughter\nafter she moved to Kansas. Lewicka was spirited and fought with her parents for\nautonomy and control over her life. When Lewicka responded to the e-mails, her tone\nwas consistently abrasive and short, asking her father, \"What the hell do you want [?]\"\nand telling him to leave her alone. However, on April 14, 2000, Lewicka's father received\na different sort of e-mail from his daughter's account. The message said she and another\nperson had spent the last 2 weeks traveling the countryside in China. Unlike previous e-\nmails, the tone of this message was respectful and polite. The final series of e-mails\nLewicka's father received from his daughter's account said she was traveling to overseas\nlocations.\n                                             35\n\f       3. Lisa Stasi\n\n       Lisa Stasi, formerly Lisa Elledge, was 18 years old when she began dating Carl\nStasi sometime after June 1983. Lisa married Carl in August 1984. She was pregnant at\nthe time. On September 3, 1984, Lisa Stasi gave birth to her first child, Tiffany Lynn, at\nTruman Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri. After Tiffany's birth, Stasi's marriage\ncrumbled and Carl reenlisted in the Navy. He reported for duty at Great Lakes Naval\nBase, outside Chicago, Illinois, in early January 1985.\n\n\n       Around the time Stasi began dating Carl, Robinson was looking for a private\nadoption opportunity for his younger brother, Donald Robinson, and Donald's wife,\nHelen, who lived in the Chicago area. At a family reunion in 1983, Donald and Helen\ntold Robinson they were pursuing a private adoption. Robinson said he knew an adoption\nattorney, Doug Wood, and would handle the process for his younger brother. In fall 1984,\nRobinson told Donald and Helen a baby would be available in October. At Robinson's\ndirection, Donald sent him a $2,500 cashier's check payable to Robinson's business, Equi\nII, allegedly to cover adoption-related fees. Robinson later said the birth mother had\ndecided not to place the child for adoption.\n\n\n       In November 1984, Robinson contacted Karen Gaddis, a social worker at Truman\nMedical Center, and told her that he and several Johnson County businessmen had\ndeveloped a program to provide housing, transportation, daycare, and job training for\nyoung mothers and their babies. Robinson said he needed referrals of Caucasian women\nbecause the program already had African-American participants and needed racial\nbalance. Robinson was looking for a white woman in her teens or early 20s, who had a\nnewborn child, was struggling or disadvantaged, and had no family support or ties. In\nJanuary 1985, Robinson told Gaddis another organization, Hope House, had referred a\n\n                                               36\n\fyoung lady to his program, and he had placed her at a motel in Kansas. Lisa Stasi's aunt,\nKaren Moore, testified that she had contacted Hope House and took Stasi to the\norganization just before January 1, 1985.\n\n\n       Family members last saw Stasi and Tiffany in early January 1985. Carl Stasi's\nsister, Kathy Klingensmith, babysat Tiffany often. On January 8, Stasi dropped Tiffany\noff at Klingensmith's home and told her she had met a man named John Osborne, who\nwas going to help her get a job and finish her GED. Stasi said she might even get to travel\nas part of the job training program.\n\n\n       Stasi returned to Klingensmith's home to pick up Tiffany on January 9. When she\narrived, Stasi said John Osborne had paid for her to stay in a room at the Roadway Inn in\nOverland Park. At approximately 2 p.m., Stasi called the front desk at the Roadway Inn\nand gave the hotel receptionist Klingensmith's phone number in case Osborne called.\nOsborne called Klingensmith's number soon thereafter and got directions to her home.\nThe weather was treacherous because of a strong snowstorm, but Osborne arrived at\nKlingensmith's home at approximately 3 p.m. Stasi and Tiffany went with Osborne,\nleaving Stasi's car parked outside Klingensmith's home. Less than 1 hour later, Stasi\ncalled Klingensmith to tell her she had arrived safely at the motel. Klingensmith never\nsaw or heard from Stasi or Tiffany again. Stasi never returned for her car. Klingensmith\nidentified Robinson at trial as the man she knew as John Osborne.\n\n\n       Around 4:30 p.m., Stasi called her mother-in-law, Betty Stasi, in a panic, crying\nand hysterical. Stasi said \"they\" were claiming that Betty Stasi planned to take Tiffany\naway because Stasi was an unfit mother. Stasi's mother-in-law told her not to believe\nwhat \"they\" were saying because it was not true. Stasi said \"they\" wanted her to sign four\nblank sheets of paper. Betty Stasi told her not to sign anything. Stasi said \"here they\ncome,\" and she hung up.\n                                             37\n\f       Betty Stasi never spoke to or saw Stasi or Tiffany again. A few days later, Betty\nStasi received a letter purportedly written by Stasi. It was typewritten and signed \"Lisa\"\nat the bottom and said Stasi had left town to start a new life with Tiffany.\n\n\n       Nancy Robinson testified that in early January 1985, the day of the terrible\nsnowstorm, Robinson brought a baby to their home in Stanley. Robinson said that the\nbaby's name was Tiffany and that he received her through a private adoption for his\nbrother. Robinson called Donald and Helen and told them a baby was available\nimmediately. He said the birth mother had decided against adoption after delivery, but the\nfamily did not support her decision, so she left the baby at a shelter and committed\nsuicide.\n\n\n       Donald and Helen flew to Kansas City on January 10. Robinson picked them up at\nthe airport in the late afternoon and drove them to the offices of Equi II in Overland Park,\nwhere they signed legal paperwork, including a Petition for Adoption. After signing the\ndocuments, Donald gave Robinson a $3,000 cashier's check payable to Doug Wood,\nallegedly for further adoption expenses. Donald and Helen named the baby Heather\nTiffany Robinson. They returned to Chicago, along with the baby, the following day.\n\n\n       That same morning, Klingensmith called the Roadway Inn and learned Stasi's\nroom had been reserved under a name other than John Osborne. On January 11,\nKlingensmith filed a missing persons report with the Overland Park Police Department.\n\n\n       Robinson's name surfaced early in the investigation. On February 1, 1985,\nOverland Park detectives interviewed Robinson, who told them he was starting a\ncharitable organization to provide young mothers job training, food, and housing.\nRobinson admitted he had placed Stasi at the Roadway Inn as part of that program.\n                                             38\n\fHowever, he said Stasi had recently come to his office to give him the motel key.\nRobinson said Stasi thanked him for the assistance and said she had made other\narrangements. Robinson claimed that Stasi and Tiffany left with a young Caucasian male\nin an older model green car.\n\n\n       One week later, Robinson provided a similar story to his Missouri Parole and\nProbation Officer, Steve Haymes. Robinson told Haymes he had placed Stasi at the\nRoadway Inn, but on January 10, she and Tiffany came to his business with a man named\nBill and said they planned to start a new life together in Colorado.\n\n\n       To corroborate this story, Robinson paid Cora Holmes $800 in exchange for her\nfalse statement to police. At Robinson's direction, Holmes told Overland Park detectives\nthat she had recently babysat Tiffany and learned Stasi had left for Arkansas with a man\nnamed Bill Summers.\n\n       In July 1985, Donald and Helen received a package from Robinson containing\nfinal adoption paperwork, including a Petition for Adoption, Decree of Adoption, birth\ncertificate, and other documents. The Petition appeared to be signed by attorney Douglas\nWood, who had handled over 100 adoptions in his career. Wood testified that he did not\nprepare the document, that it deviated from his standard form, and that his signature had\nbeen forged. Wood confirmed that he had never represented Robinson or any member of\nhis family in any adoption proceeding nor received payment from Robinson for such\nlegal work.\n\n\n       The Decree appeared to contain the signature of attorney Ronald Wood, who had\nhandled only three adoptions in his 23-year career. Ronald Wood testified that he never\nsigned the Decree. He had represented Robinson in other matters, and Robinson had\naccess to other examples of Wood's signature. The Decree also appeared to be signed by\n\n                                             39\n\fJudge Michael H. Farley, but Judge Farley testified the decree was fraudulent and his\nsignature had been forged.\n\n\n       Both the Petition and Decree appeared to be notarized by Evi Gresham, who had\nbeen in a BDS&M relationship with Robinson in the early to mid-1980s, but Gresham\nhad never seen the documents, her name was misspelled, and she was never a notary\npublic. Robinson had directed Gresham to sign numerous blank papers during their\nrelationship. Neither the Petition nor the Decree was found in the district court clerk's\nofficial records.\n\n\n       After Robinson's arrest in 2000, Donald and Helen began to question the identity\nof Heather's birth mother. Law enforcement compared Heather's footprints to the known\nprints of Tiffany and found the prints matched, i.e., Heather Tiffany Robinson was\nTiffany, Stasi's biological daughter.\n\n\n       4. Beverly Bonner\n\n       Beverly Bonner lived in Cameron, Missouri, with her husband, Dr. William\nBonner, and their two sons. In 1992 and 1993, Bonner worked as a prison librarian at the\nWestern Missouri Correctional Center while Robinson was an inmate. William Bonner\nwas a prison physician who treated Robinson and other inmates.\n\n\n       In November 1993, Bonner filed for divorce. Toward the end of their marriage,\nBonner told her husband she was helping Robinson find property for a hydroponics\nproject. Bonner also said she planned to take a job with a company in Chicago.\n\n\n       Bonner was not seen by her family after her final divorce proceeding in February\n1994. Bonner's brother, Louell Heath, invited Bonner to his September 1995 wedding,\n\n                                             40\n\fbut she did not attend. Bonner's oldest son died in October 1995, but she did not attend\nhis funeral.\n\n\n       After Bonner's disappearance, Robinson stole her alimony payments. In December\n1993, Robinson, posing as Jim or James Turner, applied for a mailbox under Bonner's\nname at The Mail Room in Olathe. The owner, Colleen Davis, identified Robinson at trial\nas the person she knew as Turner. Robinson executed a lease for Box 182 under Bonner's\nname on January 1, 1994. Robinson presented Bonner's identification and told Davis he\nwas collecting Bonner's mail while she worked in Australia. Davis never met Bonner and\nonly saw Robinson access the mailbox.\n\n\n       William Bonner paid his ex-wife $1,000 in monthly alimony for 18 months. He\ntimely mailed each alimony payment to Bonner's private mailbox in Olathe. Every\nalimony check was deposited into Robinson's Hydro-Gro, Inc., business account at\nCommunity Bank of Raymore, an account opened on February 1, 1994, with James A.\nTurner and Beverly J. Bonner as the authorized signatories. Three latent prints lifted from\nthe original alimony checks matched Robinson's known prints.\n\n\n       Robinson attempted to conceal Bonner's disappearance with fraudulent\ncommunications to her family. In January 1994, Bonner's brother, Larry Heath, received\na handwritten letter purportedly from Bonner that said she was starting a new career with\nan international corporation in Chicago and that she would be traveling extensively, both\ndomestically and abroad. A few months later, Larry Heath received a typewritten letter\npurportedly from Bonner, which was unusual because Bonner had always written letters\nby hand. The letter said Bonner was working for \"Jim Redmond\" in the human resources\ndepartment of a large international corporation. Larry Heath continued to receive similar\ntypewritten letters every 3 to 4 months. Occasionally, he would respond, mailing\ncorrespondence to Bonner's private mailbox. During the same time period, Louell Heath\n                                            41\n\freceived roughly half a dozen letters, which arrived in envelopes postmarked Australia,\nFrance, the Netherlands, and Kansas City, Missouri. The letters were typewritten, often\ndiscussed Bonner's travel overseas, and were signed in what Bonner's brothers believed to\nbe her handwriting.\n\n\n       In early 1997 the letters ceased. Bonner's family grew concerned and contacted\nauthorities to report her disappearance. Detective Frank Booth examined nine of the\nenvelopes mailed to Larry Heath. Eight of the envelopes had sufficient amylase to create\na full DNA profile, and each profile matched Robinson's known DNA.\n\n\n       5. Sheila Faith and Debbie Faith\n\n       Sheila Faith married John Faith, and the couple had a baby girl named Debbie\nLynn on October 17, 1978. Debbie was born with a number of birth defects, including\ncerebral palsy, which limited her ability to walk and control her bladder, forcing her to\nwear adult diapers later in life. Sheila's husband passed away in 1993, and Sheila moved\nwith Debbie from California to Pueblo, Colorado, to be closer to her friend, Nancy\nGuerrero. Sheila and Debbie lived on Social Security and struggled financially.\n\n\n       According to Guerrero, Sheila was lonely and responded to personal ads in hopes\nof meeting a companion. On several occasions, Sheila talked to Guerrero about her\ninterest in BDS&M but did not share details because Guerrero was uncomfortable with\nthe subject. Sheila's sister also believed she was interested in BDS&M.\n\n\n       In spring 1994, Sheila told Guerrero she had met a man named \"John\" from\nMissouri. Sheila said \"John\" was a wealthy executive who promised to take her on a\ncruise and put Debbie in private school. Sheila told her sister, Cathy Norman, that she\nhad met a man with a good job, that they planned to travel together, and that he planned\n\n                                             42\n\fto buy Debbie a new wheelchair and accessible van. Norman said Shelia called him \"Jim\nTurner\" either in a letter or during their last telephone conversation.\n\n\n       Sheila told Guerrero that she and Debbie were going to visit John. They planned to\nbe gone for about a month, spending a couple weeks with John in Missouri and then\ntraveling to Texas to visit family. Guerrero expected Sheila to return within a few weeks\nbecause they had purchased tickets to the Colorado state fair, and Sheila planned to enter\na cross-stitched angel into the fair competition. While Sheila packed, Guerrero noticed\nshe did not take furniture, bedding, or other items one would need for an indefinite stay\nelsewhere.\n\n\n       Neither Guerrero nor Sheila's sisters saw or spoke to Sheila or Debbie again after\nthey left Colorado to visit Robinson. Additionally, in 1995, Robinson gave one of his\nparamours, Sandra Shields, a cross-stitched angel as a gift. Guerrero identified the item as\nthe piece Sheila Faith had made to enter into the state fair competition.\n\n\n       After Sheila and Debbie left, Sheila's sisters received letters purportedly written by\nSheila. In December 1994, Norman received a typewritten letter purportedly from Sheila\nin an envelope postmarked Canada. The letter said Sheila had met a wonderful man\nnamed Jim. Norman was convinced the letter was a fraud because Sheila always wrote\nletters by hand and Sheila's signature appeared to be forged. Norman received another\nletter the following December. Again, she was convinced Sheila did not write it because\nof the typewritten format and the nature of the signature. Sheila's other sister, Michelle\nFox, also received a letter in an envelope postmarked outside the country. Fox\nimmediately suspected it was fraudulent because of the typed format, style, and unusual\nsignatures.\n\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f       For years following their disappearance, Robinson stole Sheila's and Debbie's\nsocial security benefit payments. In June 1994, just months after setting up a private\nmailbox under Bonner's name, Robinson, posing as James Turner, set up another private\nmailbox at the Mail Room—this time under the names Sheila and Debbie Faith. The\nowner saw Robinson come to the mailbox at least once a month to collect two\ngovernment checks mailed to Sheila and Debbie Faith.\n\n\n       While the Faiths were living in Colorado, the Social Security Administration\n(SSA) had mailed Sheila's and Debbie's benefit checks to a Pueblo, Colorado, address.\nFor the first half of 1994, these checks were often deposited into an account held at\nColorado National Bank. In June 1994, SSA received notice that Sheila's and Debbie's\nmailing address had changed to the private mailbox in Olathe. SSA began mailing benefit\nchecks to this new address the following month.\n\n\n       From July 1994 to September 1995, the checks were deposited into Robinson's\nHydro-Gro, Inc., business account at Community Bank of Raymore—the same account\nRobinson used to deposit Bonner's alimony checks. In fall 1995, Community Bank of\nRaymore notified Robinson, a/k/a James Turner, that Social Security checks could not be\ndeposited into a business account. Thereafter, Robinson deposited the checks into his\nSpecialty Publications' accounts at other financial institutions.\n\n\n       Robinson also employed fraud and deceit to ensure Debbie's disability benefits\nwould continue. In August 1994, SSA received a completed disability review form for\nDebbie, purportedly signed by Sheila Faith. Attached to the disability form was a medical\nreport confirming Debbie's ongoing physical impairment. The report appeared to be\nsigned by Dr. William Bonner, but he testified that he had never treated Debbie Faith,\nhad not prepared the report, and had never had an office at the address identified in the\ndocument.\n                                             44\n\f       On June 7, 2000, law enforcement searched box 215 at The Mail Room and seized\nenvelopes containing the June 2000 SSA benefit checks for Sheila and Debbie Faith. Lyla\nThompson, a deputy with the JOCO Lab, developed several latent fingerprints from the\nother SSA checks that matched Robinson's known prints.\n\n\n       6. Vickie Neufeld\n\n       Vickie Neufeld lived in Texas. She lost her job as a geriatric therapist in March\n2000, and her financial situation was dire. Neufeld placed personal ads on BDS&M\nwebsites and began e-mailing Robinson. Neufeld and Robinson discussed a potential\nBDS&M relationship, and he sent her a slave contract to review.\n\n\n       On April 23, 2000, Robinson asked Neufeld to visit him in Kansas. Robinson said\nhe was a wealthy businessman with a history of helping other professional women get\nestablished in the area. He promised to support her and said they possibly could pursue a\nrelationship.\n\n\n       Robinson arranged for Neufeld to stay at Extended Stay America in Overland\nPark. She arrived on April 23, 2000. As Robinson had requested, she brought her own\nsex toys along for the trip. Robinson and Neufeld engaged in sexual activity at various\ntimes during her stay. On the morning of April 26, Robinson told Neufeld he was leaving\nfor a business trip in Israel and wanted to discuss a plan for her to move to Kansas.\nRobinson said his business would pay movers to bring her belongings to Kansas that\nweekend. Robinson asked Neufeld to leave her sex toys with him, explaining it would\ngive her extra incentive to return. Neufeld left behind her rattan-type canes and a mesh\nbag full of sex toys, which she valued at $700.\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\f       Neufeld returned to Texas, but the movers never arrived. On May 22, 2000,\nNeufeld asked Robinson to return her sex toys, but he did not comply. Neufeld filed a\npolice report, and law enforcement found Neufeld's sex toys several days later during the\nsearch of Robinson's Olathe storage locker.\n\n\nThe Investigation\n\n       On March 25, 2000, the Overland Park Police Department took a missing person's\nreport regarding Trouten and transferred it to the Lenexa Police Department, which had\njurisdiction. Lenexa police created a multijurisdictional task force that quickly focused its\ninvestigation on Robinson's activities. They employed numerous investigative\ntechniques, including surveillance, trash hits, consent searches, pen registers, wiretaps,\nand search warrants, leading to Robinson's arrest on June 2, 2000.\n\n\n       On March 29 and 30, 2000, Deputy Daniel Rundle, a forensic chemist with the\nJOCO Lab, searched Trouten's room at the Guesthouse Suites in Lenexa. Although\nRundle found several small bloodstains in the room, he admitted the search produced\nnothing of evidentiary value.\n\n\n       On March 31, 2000, the Lenexa Police Department began searching trash left at\nthe curbside for collection at Robinson's Olathe residence. On April 4, officers found an\ninvoice for a package Robinson sent to Glines in California—the woman who mailed\nletters postmarked from San Jose, California, at Robinson's request. On April 25,\ninvestigators used a Deffenbaugh trash truck with the company's permission and\ncollected three bags of Robinson's trash. They recovered a telephone bill for service at\nRobinson's Linn County property, which documented a long-distance call placed from\nRobinson's trailer on the morning of Trouten's disappearance.\n\n\n\n                                              46\n\f       On May 22, 2000, law enforcement secured a court-ordered wiretap on Robinson's\ncell phone. Law enforcement later intercepted a call from Robinson to Remington's\nphone, which was answered by her minor son. During that call, Robinson identified\nhimself as \"Jim.\" Later that afternoon, law enforcement intercepted another telephone call\nfrom Robinson, posing as Jim Turner, to Remington. During this call, he said Trouten\nhad stolen his credit cards and withdrawn money from his accounts, and that his private\ninvestigator had learned Trouten was in Mexico. He also said Carolyn Trouten had called\none of his friends, inquiring about her daughter's whereabouts.\n\n\n       On the morning of June 2, 2000, law enforcement secured a warrant to search\nRobinson's Olathe residence and his Olathe storage unit. Robinson was arrested that\nmorning just before officers executed the search warrants.\n\n\n       During the search of Robinson's residence, law enforcement officers seized a\nnumber of incriminating items, including books on creating false identities; a Home\nDepot credit card bearing the name \"James A. Turner\"; IRS Form 1099 statements for\nSheila and Debbie Faith; Roadway Inn receipts with \"Lisa Stasi\" written on them,\nreflecting payment for lodging in January 1985; an IRS form signed by \"Beverly J.\nBonner\"; documents identifying \"James Turner\" and \"John Robinson\" as affiliated with\nEquity Financial Group and Hydro-Gro, Inc.; papers and handwritten notes with e-mail\naddresses associated with the victims and their families; and e-mail communications\nbetween Trouten and Robinson.\n\n\n       During the search of Robinson's Olathe storage unit, law enforcement officers\nseized several items relevant to the disappearances of Trouten, Lewicka, and Sheila and\nDebbie Faith. First, several items were immediately identifiable as Trouten's, including\nher Social Security card, Michigan driver's license, birth certificate, high school diploma,\nSam's Club membership card, American Red Cross certification card, passport\n                                             47\n\fapplication, and prescription medication. Law enforcement officers also found numerous\npersonal items that family members identified as Trouten's property, including her\njewelry boxes, jewelry, collectible items, nursing textbooks, and a journal with the name\n\"Suzette\" inside. A number of items also evidenced Trouten's BDS&M relationship with\nRobinson, including a slave contract, a sex tape, nude photographs, and e-mails.\n\n\n       Several items were also immediately identifiable as Lewicka's, including her\nPolish passport, Kansas driver's license, Social Security card, resident alien card, Olathe\nPublic Library card, high school diploma, Indiana vehicle registration, and a document\nappointing Robinson as her power of attorney. Law enforcement officers also found\nseveral personal items that family members later identified as Lewicka's.\n\n\n       Additionally, law enforcement officers seized 1998 IRS Form 1099 statements for\nSheila and Debbie Faith, along with photocopies of their SSA benefit checks for\nSeptember 1997. Finally, police found a slave contract Neufeld had signed, along with\nher sex toys.\n\n\n       On the morning of June 3, 2000, law enforcement officers secured a warrant from\nJohnson County District Judge Larry McClain to search Robinson's Linn County\nproperty. The search began that morning and continued for roughly 1 full week.\n\n\n       Around 1 p.m. on June 3, Johnson County Sheriff's Detective Herald Hughes\nlearned a cadaver dog alerted on two yellow, metal barrels on the property. The barrels\nwere located out in the open, just to the south of a wooden shed located several yards to\nthe southwest of the trailer on the property. Hughes opened the barrels and confirmed\neach contained the remains of a human body.\n\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\f       The barrels were transported to the Shawnee County morgue, where Shawnee\nCounty Deputy Coroner Donald Pojman conducted autopsies on June 4. The body\nremoved from the first barrel was that of Trouten. It was mildly decomposed, unclothed,\nand lying in a fetal position inside the barrel. There was a soft, nylon rope tied around the\nhead with a piece of cloth underneath covering the nose and mouth, which Pojman\nbelieved to be a blindfold that had slipped below the eyes. There were two visible\ninjuries: a tear to the skin near the left armpit inflicted postmortem and an oval-shaped\ndefect on the left side of the head, which Pojman believed to be lethal. Pojman concluded\nthe cause of death was a blow to the left side of the head with a hard object. Forensic\nodontologist Daniel Winter confirmed Trouten's identity with her known dental records.\n\n\n       Pojman then conducted the autopsy of the body in the second barrel, later\nidentified as Lewicka. The body was moderately decomposed, lying in a fetal position,\npartially covered with a pillow, and clothed with a short-sleeve nightshirt. Inside the\nbarrel, Pojman saw three pieces of gray or silver duct tape. He observed two blunt-force\ninjuries to the skull, either of which could have been lethal. He noted the injuries were\nsimilar to Trouten's. Winter confirmed Lewicka's identity with her known dental records.\n\n\n       Back in Linn County, deputies from the JOCO Lab discovered a variety of\nincriminating trace evidence inside Robinson's trailer. First, Deputy Allen Hamm found a\npaper towel inside the kitchen sink with a reddish-brown stain that presumptively tested\npositive for blood. Detective Booth, KCMO Lab, determined the genetic profile from the\nblood on the paper towel matched Trouten's DNA profile. Booth testified that this genetic\nprofile occurs in only 1 in 6 billion people.\n\n\n       Booth also found eight hair strands on the paper towel. Booth compared them to\nknown samples from Trouten and Robinson and opined that they were common to\nTrouten and not Robinson. Booth admitted that, unlike DNA testing, comparative hair\n                                                49\n\fanalysis cannot yield a positive identification. However, he explained the methodology is\nstill useful in excluding individuals or including them among a group of people that share\nsimilar hair characteristics. Additionally, Booth obtained a root from one of the hair\nsamples and successfully acquired a genetic profile that produced a match to Trouten.\n\n\n       Hamm found reddish-brown stains on wallboard in the kitchen that presumptively\ntested positive for blood. Booth confirmed that the genetic profile from the wallboard\nstains matched Trouten's DNA. Booth also found two hairs in the samples, both of which\nwere common to Trouten and not Robinson. Hamm also collected swabs of a stain on a\nlong piece of trim board in the kitchen area of the trailer. Booth found two hairs and two\nfragments in these swabs that were common to Trouten and not Robinson.\n\n\n       Johnson County Sheriff's Deputy Andrew Guzman found a roll of duct tape inside\na green plastic trash container in the south bedroom. The tape appeared to be similar to\nthe strands of duct tape found inside the barrel containing Lewicka's body. Investigators\nsaw a reddish-brown stain on the roll of duct tape, and Booth's subsequent testing\nconfirmed the genetic profile produced a match to Lewicka's DNA. Deputy Thompson\nlifted one latent print from the roll of duct tape that did not match Robinson's known\nprints. Thompson compared the print to several crime scene investigators' known prints\nbut found no match. Due to the state of decomposition of Lewicka's body, Thompson was\nunable to compare the print to Lewicka's. Thompson saw what appeared to be another\npartial print with some ridge detail on the roll of duct tape, but it was too incomplete to\nbe of value.\n\n\n       In addition to trace evidence, law enforcement officers seized a number of\nTrouten's belongings from inside Robinson's trailer. In the living room area, Guzman\nfound a box with an \"EZ Set\" label on it and a box with a \"Big Boy\" label on it that\ncontained glassware, oil lamps, figurines, and other collectable items. Carolyn Trouten\n                                             50\n\fconfirmed that many of these items belonged to Suzette Trouten. Thompson developed a\nnumber of latent prints from items in the EZ Set box that matched Robinson's known\nprints.\n\n\n          On June 5, 2000, law enforcement officers executed a warrant to search a\nRaymore, Missouri, storage unit, rented by Robinson. In December 1993, Robinson had\nrented unit F-10 at Stor-Mor For Less in Raymore. He leased the unit under Beverly\nBonner's name, claiming that Bonner was his sister and that he was storing her\nbelongings while she worked in Australia. The leasing agent recalled Robinson saying\nBonner worked for an agricultural company with \"Hydro\" in its name. Robinson leased\nthis unit through the summer of 1996. In January 1994, Robinson leased a second unit, E-\n2, under Bonner's name and maintained that lease through the date of his arrest.\n\n\n          Law enforcement officers began searching unit E-2, and within 10 minutes, they\nsmelled a foul odor that they associated with a decomposing body.\n\n\n          In the back of the locker, officers saw three barrels. The first was black and sealed\nwith a gray lid. They opened the top and discovered a body inside. The two other barrels\nwere located in front of the black barrel. They were covered with a large plastic sheet,\nand cat litter had been sprinkled around the outside of the barrels inside the plastic. Some\nof the litter appeared to have absorbed a dark fluid. The barrels were wrapped together\nwith two additional pieces of plastic sheeting held up with pieces of duct tape. Thompson\nexamined the plastic sheeting and duct tape and developed four latent prints of value.\nThree of the latent prints matched Robinson's known prints, and one was not identified.\nThe officers did not open the second and third barrels but suspected they too contained\nhuman remains.\n\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\f       All three barrels were transported to the Jackson County Medical Examiner\nThomas Young. Young conducted an autopsy on the body inside the first barrel, later\nidentified as Beverly J. Bonner. The body was curled up inside the barrel and fully\ndressed for cold weather. Young believed the body had been stored for a long period of\ntime because most external features were blurred and the internal organs were hard to\ndistinguish. The body had substantial trauma to the head caused by multiple blows from a\nblunt object with a rounded surface, consistent with a hammer. Young opined that any\nnumber of these blows could have resulted in death. On June 7, 2000, forensic\nodontologist Ronald Grier confirmed the victim was Bonner.\n\n\n       Next, Young conducted an autopsy on the body contained one of the two barrels\nwrapped in plastic, later identified as Sheila Faith. The body was an adult female, fully\nclothed. Young believed the state of decomposition was consistent with the death having\noccurred 5 to 6 years prior but admitted no precise date of death could be determined.\nThe body had multiple injuries to the head caused by blunt-force trauma consistent with\ninfliction by a hammer. Young opined that any number of these blows could have been\nfatal. Young also observed a fracture of the right forearm, specifically the right ulna,\nwhich he testified to be consistent with a defensive wound. Grier confirmed the victim\nwas Sheila Faith.\n\n\n       Finally, Young conducted the autopsy on the body found inside the third barrel,\nlater identified as Debbie Faith. The body was fully clothed, and the subject was wearing\nan adult disposable diaper. Young believed the victim was a teenager because x-rays\nrevealed that several growth discs had not closed. Again, Young testified that the state of\ndecomposition was consistent with the death having occurred 5 to 6 years prior but\nadmitted no precise date could be determined. The victim had sustained at least three\nblows to the head, each of which could have been fatal, inflicted by a blunt object with a\n\n\n                                             52\n\frounded surface, consistent with a hammer. Using known dental x-rays, Young opined\nthe victim was Debbie Faith.\n\n\n       Lisa Stasi's body has never been found.\n\n\n       On June 9, law enforcement officers searched the Grant Street Duplex with\nSandre's consent. They seized a number of items belonging to Lewicka, including two\nsets of bedding, an antique Polish coffee grinder, a Hungarian espresso machine, and a\nblack journal with handwriting and sketches. Investigators noticed one of the sets of\nbedding matched the pattern on the pillowcase found inside the barrel containing\nLewicka's body. The bedding also matched the pattern depicted in nude photographs of\nLewicka found in Robinson's Olathe storage unit.\n\n\n       Hanging on the wall of the duplex was a framed oil painting with the signature\n\"John '92\" and the initials \"JR\" at the top. There were also two pencil drawings displayed\nin the spare bedroom signed \"John 2000\" and the initials \"JR\" underneath. Lewicka's\nfriend Carter, who had cataloged Lewicka's artwork and was familiar with her paintings\nand drawings, recognized the framed painting as Lewicka's artwork. Lewicka's friend\nHayes also identified the pencil drawings as Lewicka's work.\n\n\n       Law enforcement officers seized several books purchased from A. Friendly's,\nwhere Lewicka was a frequent patron. The owner, Meyers, specifically recalled selling\ntwo of the books to Lewicka.\n\n\nThe Trial\n\n       On June 2, 2000, the State filed its Complaint against Robinson, charging him\nwith two counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of theft. The State amended\n\n                                            53\n\fits Complaint on June 13, adding one count of aggravated kidnapping and two counts of\ncapital murder. The State filed its Second Amended Complaint on July 28, adding one\ncharge of premeditated first-degree murder and one charge of aggravated interference\nwith parental custody. On August 31, 2000, the State filed its Third Amended Complaint,\nsupplementing allegations in the existing counts.\n\n\n      At preliminary hearing, the State put on evidence supporting the eight counts in\nthe Third Amended Complaint. District Judge John Anderson III found probable cause\nlacking and dismissed Count IV, aggravated sexual battery of J.M. Judge Anderson\nrenumbered the remaining seven counts, which were tried to the jury.\n\n\n      Jury selection began on September 16, 2002. Judge Anderson empanelled the jury\non October 4, and trial commenced on October 7. At the close of the State's evidence,\nJudge Anderson granted defendant's motion for directed verdict on Count IV, aggravated\nsexual battery of Vicki Neufeld. On October 25, 2002, the defense rested. That same day,\nthe State filed a Fourth Amended Complaint charging Robinson only with the counts\nfrom the Third Amended Complaint that survived Robinson's motion for directed verdict.\n\n\n      The following six counts were submitted to the jury on October 28, 2002: Count\nI, aggravated kidnapping of Suzette Trouten; Count II, capital murder of Suzette Trouten;\nCount III, capital murder of Izabela Lewicka; Count IV, felony theft of Vicki Neufeld's\nproperty; Count V, premeditated first-degree murder of Lisa Stasi; and Count VI,\naggravated interference with Lisa Stasi's parental custody. On October 29, 2002, the jury\nreturned a unanimous verdict convicting Robinson on all counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                            54\n\f                            PRETRIAL AND GUILT PHASE ISSUES\n\n                                           1. VENUE\n\n\n       Robinson argues pretrial publicity was so pervasive and prejudicial in Johnson\nCounty that it resulted in actual prejudice to his right to trial by a fair and impartial jury\nin violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution. He also claims Judge Anderson abused his discretion by refusing to transfer\nvenue to another county pursuant to K.S.A. 22-2616(1).\n\n\nAdditional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       1. First Motion for Venue Change\n\n       Robinson first moved for a change of venue on January 17, 2002. At the January\n30, 2002, evidentiary hearing, defendant presented testimony from venue experts, along\nwith the results of a venue study prepared by Lisa Dahl of Litigation Consultants, Inc.\n\n\n       The study was based on three telephone surveys: one of 400 Johnson County\nresidents, one of 200 Harvey County residents, and one of 200 Ellis County residents.\nDahl selected Johnson County, which had a population of 464,083 at the time, because it\nwas the venue of origin. She selected Harvey County, which had a population of 35,737,\nas one of the control groups because its county seat, Newton, was a bedroom community\nto Wichita, much like Olathe was a bedroom community to Kansas City. She selected\nEllis County, which had a population of 28,731, as another control group because it was\ngeographically removed from the venue of origin and other metropolitan areas, yet its\ndemographic makeup and crime rates were comparable to Johnson County. Dahl testified\nthe number of respondents in each county was statistically sufficient to extrapolate results\n\n\n                                               55\n\fto the general population within a 5 percent margin of error in Johnson County and 7 to 8\npercent margin in the control counties.\n\n       The surveys' results showed 94 percent of the respondents in Johnson County were\naware of this case, compared to 80 percent in Harvey County and 64 percent in Ellis\nCounty. Further, 67 percent of those surveyed in Johnson County held an overall opinion\nthat the defendant was \"definitely guilty\" or \"probably guilty.\" In contrast, 50.5 percent\nof the Harvey County respondents and 35.5 percent of the Ellis County respondents held\nsimilar opinions. As to respondents' views of the strength of the evidence of defendant's\nguilt, 72.3 percent of the Johnson County respondents believed it to be \"overwhelming\"\nor \"strong.\" Half of the respondents in Harvey County and only 35.5 percent of\nrespondents in Ellis County believed likewise. Also, 68 percent of Johnson County\nrespondents had knowledge of case facts beyond those presented in the survey, compared\nto only 23 percent in Harvey County and 27.3 percent in Ellis County.\n\n\n       Dahl testified that the surveys' results were generally statistically significant.\nHowever, in the three counties surveyed, there was no statistically reliable difference in\nsentencing opinions among respondents who recalled the case.\n\n\n       Dahl admitted she was not interested in exploring whether respondents could set\naside preconceived opinions and serve as impartial jurors. In fact, none of the 38\nquestions in the surveys explored respondents' ability to assess the case impartially.\n\n\n       Robinson also called Ronald Dillehay, a professor of psychology at the University\nof Nevada-Reno with expertise in the design and analysis of venue studies and jury\nselection procedures. Dillehay testified that the design of Dahl's venue surveys was\nscientifically valid and conformed to generally accepted practices in the field. Dillehay\nalso testified that the absence of questions exploring respondents' ability to serve as\n\n                                              56\n\fimpartial jurors did not invalidate the venue study. In support, he cited studies in the\nfields of psychology and social science that suggest humans struggle to set aside\npreconceived opinions but will confirm their ability to do so when asked. Thus, Dillehay\nsaid such questions produce a lack of response variance sought in reliable questionnaires.\n\n\n       Dillehay acknowledged the survey data showed a very high level of awareness and\nprejudgment of the case in Johnson County and then discussed possible options to\ncounteract such prejudice, including: (1) change of venue; (2) importing jurors from\noutside Johnson County; (3) delay; (4) enhanced voir dire; (5) additional peremptory\nchallenges; and (6) judicial instructions.\n\n\n       Dillehay believed delay and judicial instructions would be ineffective due to the\nhigh levels of awareness and prejudgment. As to the option of enhanced voir dire,\nDillehay explained that the court could overcome juror minimization, which he described\nas a tendency on the part of jurors during voir dire to downplay what they learned from\nthe media coverage and the impact it had on their prejudgment and/or impartiality, by\nallowing attorneys to ask prospective jurors extensive, probing voir dire questions.\nDillehay explained that enhanced voir dire would require participation of attorneys, lots\nof questions, and small groups consisting of no more than four to six people, facilitating\nan environment where prospective jurors would be forthcoming. While effective,\nDillehay believed enhanced voir dire would be too onerous from a logistical or\nadministrative perspective, describing it as \"very laborious and very time-consuming.\"\n\n\n       On the second day of the evidentiary hearing, continued to March 6, 2002, the\ndefense played 2 hours of televised news coverage of the case broadcast within the first 2\nweeks of the discovery of bodies on Robinson's Linn County property in June 2000. In\nthe motion, defendant had also submitted articles about the case published by the Kansas\nCity Star from June 6, 2000, to July 27, 2001. During this time period, the Kansas City\n                                             57\n\fStar published 72 stories. More than half of them were published in the same month the\nstory broke. Coverage gradually dissipated and was nearly nonexistent at the end of 2000\nand early 2001. Thereafter, the majority of the coverage shifted from reports about\nRobinson and the crimes to trial coverage.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson denied the motion in a March 12, 2002, order, explaining:\n\n\n       \"Despite the extraordinary amount of attention this case has received from the public and\n       in the press thus far, the Court is not convinced that the defendant cannot obtain a fair\n       trial. Johnson County is a large county with a sophisticated pool of potential jurors. The\n       Court is confident that appropriate voir dire and jury selection methods will result in a\n       fair and impartial jury that will decide the case on the evidence presented in court and on\n       its merits. The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are of the utmost\n       importance to the rule of law in this country. The system simply does not function\n       without it. If it becomes apparent during voir dire that an impartial jury cannot be found,\n       the Court will not be reluctant to order a change of venue.\"\n\n\n       2. Renewed Motion for Venue Change after Voir Dire\n\n       On October 3, 2002, after completing voir dire, Robinson filed \"Defendant's\nRenewed Motion for Change of Venue, or, in the Alternative, to Discharge the Jury\nPanel,\" arguing that voir dire had proven inadequate to overcome community bias.\n\n\n       At the outset of jury selection, roughly 1,200 Johnson County residents were\nissued summonses and ordered to appear in four groups of 300, but the district judge later\nreleased the final two panels. Veniremembers completed a juror questionnaire\n(questionnaire) prepared by the parties, eliciting their views on pretrial publicity, the\ndeath penalty, and other case-specific facts and issues.\n\n\n\n                                                    58\n\f       With the agreement of the parties, the trial court conducted jury selection in four\nphases. In the first phase, Judge Anderson called prospective jurors in groups of 60 to\nexplore and rule on hardship challenges.\n\n\n       In the second phase, Judge Anderson assigned jurors to six-member panels to\nconduct small group voir dire on pretrial publicity and death penalty topics. After the\nparties completed voir dire of each panel, the district judge ruled on challenges for cause.\nFrom September 18 to October 1, 2002, the parties examined 43 panels made up of 259\nveniremembers. Nearly all had some knowledge of the case. Judge Anderson passed only\n83 of the 259 panelists to the third phase of jury selection.\n\n\n       A majority of these disqualified panelists, 167 of 259 (64 percent), were excused\nfor cause based on preconceived opinions of the case, firm death penalty opinions (both\nfor and against), or both. Specifically, 74 of the 259 panelists (28.5 percent) were excused\nbased solely on firm opinions due to exposure to pretrial publicity, 72 panelists (27.7\npercent) were excused based solely on firm opinions regarding the death penalty, and 21\nadditional panelists (8.1 percent) were excused on both pretrial publicity and death\npenalty grounds. In total, 95 of the 259 panelists were excused, in whole or part, due to\nbias related to pretrial publicity and 93 panelists were excused, in whole or part, based on\ntheir disqualifying death penalty opinions. Judge Anderson liberally excused panelists\nholding preconceived opinions, granting 92 of the 100 challenges defendant asserted on\nthis basis.\n\n\n       Nine of the 259 panelists (3.4 percent) were excused because of previously\nundisclosed hardships or grounds unrelated to pretrial publicity or the death penalty.\n\n\n       Of the 83 panelists passed to general voir dire, 52 were passed without any\nchallenge for cause asserted by either party. The 31 other panelists were passed over the\n                                              59\n\fobjection of one of the parties—4 from the State and 27 from defendant. However,\nRobinson challenged 19 of these 27 based on death penalty views and 8 on grounds\nrelated to bias arising from exposure to media coverage.\n\n\n       During general voir dire, Judge Anderson passed 65 of the 83 panelists, excusing\n18 on grounds unrelated to pretrial publicity. However, the district judge needed only 51\npanelists to seat a jury of 12 with 5 alternates. The parties agreed to release the 14 jurors\nwith the highest assigned juror numbers. Juror 440, whom Robinson had previously\nchallenged unsuccessfully on pretrial publicity grounds, was 1 of the 14 panelists\nreleased. This left only 7 prospective jurors on the final panel that defendant had\nchallenged unsuccessfully on grounds of bias arising from exposure to pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       In the final phase of jury selection, the parties exercised peremptory challenges.\nAmong those jurors seated, 11 of 12 were passed by the parties without any objection\nbased on preconceived opinions of guilt, and all jurors confirmed their ability to serve\nimpartially. Defendant had challenged only one of the seated jurors, Juror 39, on grounds\nof bias related to pretrial publicity. Eight of the 12 jurors were passed for cause without\nchallenge from either party (Jurors 87, 92, 131, 147, 214, 246, 302, and 309).\n\n\n       At the start of the eighth day of trial, Juror 214 was excused because of an\nemergency medical hardship in her family and was replaced by Alternate Juror 340. The\nparties had passed Juror 340 without challenge.\n\n\n       While every seated juror was familiar with the case, most had limited exposure to\nthe media's coverage. All but two members of the jury characterized their exposure to\npretrial publicity as minimal, passing, or light; and several members said they saw\ncoverage when the story first broke 2 years earlier and their recollection of the reported\nfacts had diminished over time.\n                                              60\n\f       After hearing argument on the renewed motion for venue change on October 4,\n2002, the trial judge denied the motion, finding the jury selection process had yielded a\nfair and impartial jury.\n\n       3. Second Renewed Motion for Venue Change\n\n       On October 7, 2002, just before opening statements, defendant renewed his motion\nto change venue for a second time. Defense counsel explained that earlier that morning,\nhe entered Judge Anderson's chambers and noticed a copy of that morning's Olathe Daily\nNews sitting in the reception area. The front page of the newspaper contained Robinson's\nphotograph, and the newspaper's banner headline read \"Robinson to face his jury\" and the\nsubheading read \"Defense says trial should be moved.\" Defense counsel explained that\nwhen he emerged from chambers, the jury walked past him, coming within 2 feet of the\npaper, which was face up on the reception counter. The defense believed jurors could\nhave seen the headlines, warranting a venue change.\n\n\n       The trial court denied the second renewed motion for venue change, finding that\nhe had \"no idea\" whether any jurors saw the newspaper, but even if they did, there was no\nprejudice in light of the content and given the media's extensive reporting on defendant's\nmotion to change venue earlier that spring.\n\n\n       4. Third Renewed Motion for Venue Change\n\n       Defendant renewed his motion to change venue for a third time on October 9,\n2002, explaining that a local radio personality had been giving away T-shirts outside the\ncourthouse as a publicity stunt that morning. The front of the T-shirts read \"Roll Out the\nBarrels! Of Evidence,\" and the back read \"John E. Robinson Trial 2002.\"\n\n\n                                              61\n\f        Judge Anderson found that none of the jurors were exposed to the publicity stunt\nor T-shirts because of safeguards the court had taken, including bringing jurors into the\ncourthouse through a secluded entry away from the incident. Judge Anderson denied the\nmotion, concluding the incident did not affect jurors \"in any way, shape or form.\"\n\n\nLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge's denial of his change of venue motions violated\nhis constitutional right to an impartial jury.\n\n\n       The Sixth Amendment guarantees an accused \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions\" the\nright to a trial by \"an impartial jury.\" U.S. Const. amend VI. This protection is\nincorporated into and made applicable to the States through the due process provision of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145, 153-58, 88 S. Ct. 1444,\n20 L. Ed. 2d 491 (1968).\n\n\n       A constitution-based claim for venue change can arise under a theory of presumed\nor actual Sixth Amendment prejudice. State v. Longoria, 301 Kan. 489, 506, 343 P.3d\n1128 (2015). \"'[A]ctual prejudice,' occurs 'where the effect of pretrial publicity\nmanifested at jury selection is so substantial as to taint the entire jury pool.'\" State v.\nCarr, 300 Kan. 1, 57, 331 P.3d 544 (2014) (quoting Goss v. Nelson, 439 F.3d 621, 628-\n29 [10th Cir. 2006]), cert. granted in part 135 S. Ct. 1698 (2015). \"'In cases of actual\nprejudice, \"the voir dire testimony and the record of publicity [must] reveal the kind of\nwave of public passion that would have made a fair trial unlikely by the jury that was\nimpaneled as a whole.\" [Citations omitted.]'\" 300 Kan. at 57.\n\n\n       \"Jury selection is a task 'particularly within the province of the trial judge.'\" Carr,\n300 Kan. at 75 (quoting Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589, 594-95, 96 S. Ct. 1017, 47 L. Ed.\n\n                                                 62\n\f2d 258 [1976]). A district judge's ruling on juror impartiality \"is entitled to special\ndeference.\" 300 Kan. at 75. Accordingly, we review claims of actual prejudice under the\nabuse of discretion standard. 300 Kan. at 75. \"An abuse of discretion can occur in one of\nthree ways—when the trial court makes an error of law; bases its decision on facts not\nsupported by the evidence; or makes an arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable decision.\"\nLongoria, 301 Kan. at 509.\n\n\n       Defendant also challenges Judge Anderson's rulings under the Kansas change of\nvenue statute, K.S.A. 22-2616(1). As with claims of actual prejudice, we review the trial\ncourt's ruling under the statute for abuse of discretion. Longoria, 301 Kan. at 509.\n\n\nActual Prejudice\n\n       Robinson advances five arguments in support of his actual prejudice challenge,\narguing that the trial court abused its discretion by: (1) failing to acknowledge\nuncontroverted social science evidence that individuals cannot set aside preconceived\nopinions; (2) applying K.S.A. 22-2616 contrary to the Sixth Amendment; (3) finding voir\ndire eliminated those with bias; (4) failing to acknowledge the media's interference with\nproceedings; and (5) failing to acknowledge jurors' failure to abide by admonitions.\n\n\n       1. Did the trial court's findings ignore social science research?\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge erroneously denied the venue change motion in\nlight of uncontroverted expert witness testimony describing social science studies that\nsuggest people struggle to genuinely set aside preconceived beliefs. Given this testimony,\nRobinson believes Judge Anderson's finding that voir dire could overcome community\nbias is unsupported by record evidence.\n\n\n\n                                              63\n\f       There are several problems with Robinson's argument. First, it fails to place the\nexpert witness' testimony in its proper context. During the evidentiary hearing, the\ndefense asked its expert witness, Dillehay, whether Dahl's venue questionnaire was valid\neven though it failed to explore respondents' ability to set aside their opinions of the case.\nDillehay opined that such questions were properly excluded from the surveys because\nthey do not produce reliable survey data. In support of this opinion, Dillehay identified\nseveral studies suggesting humans' struggle to genuinely set aside preconceived beliefs\nyet will attest to their ability to do so. Dillehay did not attempt to extrapolate these\nfindings as support for the broader proposition that Robinson advances here—that anyone\nwho forms an opinion of the case is thereafter unalterably tainted and rendered\nunqualified to serve as a juror. In fact, the Supreme Court has observed that empirical\nstudies support the opposite conclusion. Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030,\n1054-55, 111 S. Ct. 2720, 115 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1991) (\"Empirical research suggests that in\nthe few instances when jurors have been exposed to extensive and prejudicial publicity,\nthey are able to disregard it and base their verdict upon the evidence presented in court.\").\n\n\n       More importantly, Dillehay later testified that this phenomenon, which he called\n\"juror minimization,\" could be overcome by employing enhanced voir dire techniques.\nDillehay opined that enhanced voir dire would facilitate open, genuine responses from\nveniremembers, enabling the district judge to identify and remove those rendered\nunqualified to serve due to preconceived opinions of guilt. This testimony provides\nrecord support for Judge Anderson's finding that \"appropriate voir dire and jury selection\nmethods will result in a fair and impartial jury.\" For these reasons, the ruling is supported\nby substantial, competent evidence and does not constitute an abuse of discretion. See\nState v. McCullough, 293 Kan. 970, 980-81, 270 P.3d 1142 (2012) (trial court abuses\ndiscretion where substantial competent evidence does not support a finding upon which a\nlegal conclusion rests).\n\n\n                                              64\n\f       2. Did the trial court apply an incorrect legal standard?\n\n       Robinson next argues the trial court applied an \"impossibility of fair trial\" standard\nunder K.S.A. 22-2616(1) rather than the Sixth Amendment \"reasonable likelihood\" of an\nunfair trial standard embraced by the Supreme Court. See Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S.\n333, 363, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1966) (\"But where there is a reasonable\nlikelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge should . . .\ntransfer it to another county not so permeated with publicity.\").\n\n\n       Robinson relies on language from the trial court's order denying the first venue\nchange motion, which concluded that \"[d]espite the extraordinary amount of attention\nthis case has received from the public and in the press thus far, the Court is not convinced\nthat the defendant cannot obtain a fair trial.\" (Emphasis added.) Robinson believes the\nuse of the term \"cannot\" proves the district judge employed an \"impossibility\" standard to\ndefendant's venue change motion.\n\n\n       However, this language merely tracks the venue change statute itself, which\ncompels the court to transfer venue where prejudice against defendant is so great that he\nor she \"cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in that county.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A.\n22-2616(1).\n\n\n       We disposed of a substantively similar challenge in Carr, where defendant argued\nKansas' venue change statute improperly elevated the standard of proof from \"reasonable\nlikelihood\" of an unfair trial to an \"absolute certainty\" of an unfair trial by compelling a\nvenue change only when defendant cannot obtain a fair trial. 300 Kan. at 80. However,\nwe observed in Carr that Kansas courts consistently apply a \"reasonable certainty\"\nstandard of proof (i.e., \"'reasonable certainty' that the defendant cannot obtain a fair trial\nin the ordinary venue\") to challenges under Kansas' venue change statute and found this\n\n                                               65\n\fstandard to be wholly consistent with the Supreme Court's \"reasonable likelihood\"\nstandard. 300 Kan. at 80-81. Carr disposes of Robinson's challenge because it is founded\non Judge Anderson's reference to the same statutory language at issue there.\n\n\n       Defendant also contends Judge Anderson's order is erroneous because it fails to\naddress the constitutionally based venue challenge apart from his statutory challenge.\nHowever, the trial court's memorandum decision addressed the motion to change venue\nunder \"K.S.A. 22-2616, § 10 of the Kansas Constitution's Bill of Rights, and the Sixth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\" While the order does not\nmake separate findings between the statutory and constitutionally based theories in the\nmotion, \"defendant[ ] never sought a more complete recitation or writing to explain Judge\n[Anderson's] venue rulings; and, if [he] thought the findings were insufficient for\nappellate review, [he] had an obligation to do so.\" Carr, 300 Kan. at 65. Robinson's\nfailure to do so forecloses his challenge. See Longoria, 301 Kan. at 506 (Where\ndefendant fails to \"object to the adequacy of the trial court's factual findings, we assume\nthat the trial court made the findings necessary to deny the change of venue.\").\n\n\n       3. Did voir dire prove ineffective to overcome prejudice?\n\n       In his third actual prejudice argument, Robinson claims the trial court erred by\nfailing to recognize that jury selection only confirmed the need to change venue. This\nchallenge goes to the heart of the question of actual Sixth Amendment prejudice.\n\n\n       \"When faced with a claim of actual prejudice, a trial court must 'review the media\n       coverage and the substance of the jurors' statements at voir dire to determine whether a\n       community-wide sentiment exists against the defendant. Negative media coverage by\n       itself is insufficient to establish actual prejudice.'\" Longoria, 301 Kan. at 508 (quoting\n       Carr, 300 Kan. 1, Syl. ¶ 6).\n\n\n\n                                                    66\n\fIn reviewing a claim of actual prejudice, we examine \"'\"whether the judge had a\nreasonable basis for concluding that the jurors selected could be impartial.\"'\" Carr, 300\nKan. at 74-75.\n\n\n       Robinson first argues the character and composition of the jury panel, as well as\nthe members of his jury, demonstrate actual prejudice. To the contrary, Judge Anderson's\njury selection procedures proved to be successful in identifying bias and removing those\nveniremembers adversely affected by pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       During the second phase of jury selection, the district judge, consistent with the\nrecommendation of Robinson's expert, Dillehay, assigned veniremembers to small group\npanels consisting of six members and allowed counsel for the parties to question them\nextensively on pretrial publicity and death penalty topics. Through this process, Judge\nAnderson excused 95 of the 259 panelists, roughly 37 percent, in whole or in part,\nbecause of firm opinions of guilt arising from exposure to pretrial publicity. Of the 83\npanelists passed to the third phase of jury selection, general voir dire, Robinson had\nchallenged only 8 unsuccessfully on grounds related to pretrial publicity or preconceived\nopinions of guilt.\n\n\n       Robinson argues 52 of the 83 panelists (nearly 63 percent) passed to the third\nphase were biased. However, this calculation includes jurors who merely expressed a\nbelief in capital punishment, even if they had not formed opinions about the case as a\nresult of exposure to pretrial publicity. Robinson's selection criteria were also overly\nbroad, including jurors who expressed a belief or a \"leaning\" toward the belief that\nRobinson was guilty or made statements Robinson believed to be \"suggestive of such a\nbelief\" either during voir dire or merely in their questionnaire responses. Robinson claims\n28 of the 83 panelists held opinions of guilt (either exclusively or in addition to views in\nsupport of capital punishment). Yet, he challenged only 8 of the 83 panelists on such\n                                             67\n\fgrounds. The discrepancy between Robinson's calculation and his actual challenges for\ncause highlights the unreliability of defendant's calculations.\n\n\n       Moreover, the members of defendant's jury were well qualified. The jury consisted\nof 11 members who entered the box without preconceived opinions of the case, and all\nconfirmed their ability to set aside personal views and decide the case on the evidence at\ntrial. Most jurors had minimal exposure to the media's coverage of the case, and none\nexpressed community hostility toward Robinson.\n\n\n       Defendant argues that 8 of the 12 members of the jury were biased. However,\ndefendant's count suffers the same methodological flaws identified above—it includes\njurors based solely on their death penalty views unrelated to pretrial publicity and the\nselection criteria were overly broad. Excluding those jurors defendant counted based\nsolely on their alleged opinion regarding sentence, Robinson identified only four jurors\n(Jurors 39, 87, 246, and 302) who purportedly held preconceived opinions of guilt.\nHowever, a review of their voir dire testimony confirms their impartiality.\n\n\n       Juror 39 agreed there had been a lot of media coverage, mostly adverse to\nRobinson. When defense counsel asked whether the coverage had caused her to form any\nopinions about defendant's guilt, Juror 39 said, \"Well, from what I've read, it seems that\nthe crimes that were committed were committed by him. Again, that's just based on what\nI've read and what I've heard on the news.\" Even so, Juror 39 confirmed her ability to set\nthese facts and opinions aside and committed to holding the State to its burden of proof at\ntrial. When questioned on the subject again during general voir dire, Juror 39 understood\nshe would have to disregard all media facts and start with a clean slate at trial and\nconfirmed her willingness and ability to presume defendant innocent.\n\n\n\n\n                                             68\n\f       Juror 87 testified that she had formed no opinion of guilt and could set aside all\nmedia reported facts in response to questioning from both parties. In the questionnaire,\nshe said that the published reports did not look good for defendant but shared that people\nonly get half the story in the paper and those reports are unbalanced and one-sided. She\nalso clarified that she had not personally decided Robinson was guilty and would set\naside media information and render a verdict based on the evidence. Defendant did not\nchallenge Juror 87 for cause.\n\n\n       Juror 246, in questionnaire responses, said that she had no idea about Robinson's\nguilt or innocence, that if he did commit the crimes he was very sick, and that based\nsolely on the media's coverage it appeared there was a probability of guilt. Even so, Juror\n246 confirmed in response to questioning that she remained unsure as to defendant's guilt\nor innocence. Juror 246 said her memory of media reported facts had faded over time.\nEven if the evidence at trial refreshed her recollection of media facts, Juror 246 said she\nwould not consider them or allow them to influence her decision. She understood the\napplicable burden of proof and confirmed she would acquit Robinson if the State failed to\nmeet its burden. Defendant did not challenge Juror 246 for cause.\n\n\n       Juror 302 said she was unsure as to Robinson's guilt or innocence in questionnaire\nresponses. She felt the media had portrayed Robinson as guilty but clarified this was not\nnecessarily her view. Juror 302 was confident she could set aside media-reported facts\nand decide the case on the evidence. Defendant did not challenge Juror 302 for cause.\n\n\n       Based on his extensive jury selection procedures and the voir dire testimony of\nseated jurors, Judge Anderson had a reasonable basis for concluding that the jurors\nselected could be impartial. State v. Ruebke, 240 Kan. 493, 500-01, 731 P.2d 842\n(\"Unless we are to assume that (1) the jurors selected to try the defendant violated their\noath when they swore that they could give the defendant a fair trial or (2) an individual\n                                             69\n\fcan commit a crime so heinous that news coverage generated by that act will not allow\nthe perpetrator to be brought to trial, the defendant has not established substantial\nprejudice.\"), cert. denied 483 U.S. 1024 (1987); see Gardner v. Galetka, 568 F.3d 862,\n890 (10th Cir. 2009) (holding that there was no actual prejudice even though 55 percent\nof prospective jurors had formed an opinion about guilt, and 4 of 12 impaneled jurors\nindicated that they thought defendant was guilty, where all indicated they could decide\nthe case on the evidence alone); Hale v. Gibson, 227 F.3d 1298, 1320 (10th Cir. 2000)\n(defendant must show more than that the juror had a preconceived notion of guilt; he\nmust show that the juror had such a fixed opinion that he or she could not judge\nimpartially).\n\n\n       Robinson suggests the jurors' declarations of impartiality were unreliable in light\nof the extensive and unfavorable media attention. However, we have emphasized that\n\"[n]egative media coverage by itself is insufficient to establish actual prejudice.\" Carr,\n300 Kan. 1, Syl. ¶ 6. Only in rare and extreme cases will the court disregard juror\ndeclarations of impartiality in favor of a finding of actual prejudice.\n\n\n       For example, in Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 722-23, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d\n751 (1961), the media unleashed a barrage of newspaper headlines, articles, cartoons, and\npictures against defendant leading up to trial. These stories examined defendant's prior\nconvictions, announced his identification in a police lineup, reported that he had been\nplaced at the scene of the crime, and explained that \"the six murders were solved but\npetitioner refused to confess.\" 366 U.S. at 725. On the day before trial, the media\nreported that Irvin had admitted to the murder of the victim in the case, as well as other\nmurders. The press also reported that defendant offered to plead guilty to avoid the death\npenalty. The trial court excused 268 of the 430 veniremembers (62 percent) based on\ntheir bias, and 8 of 12 jurors entered the box with preconceived opinions of guilt. Given\n\n\n                                              70\n\fthese circumstances, the Supreme Court found it improper to rely on juror representations\nof impartiality. 366 U.S. at 727-28.\n\n\n       Since Irvin, the Supreme Court has twice considered and rejected claims that juror\ndeclarations of impartiality should be set aside. See Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025,\n1029-30, 1033-34, 104 S. Ct. 2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1984) (although 77 percent of\nveniremembers admitted they carried opinions of guilt and 8 of the 14 jurors and\nalternates admitted the same, declarations of impartiality were reliable because passage of\ntime had minimized jurors' conviction in opinions); Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794,\n800-01, 95 S. Ct. 2031, 44 L. Ed. 2d 589 (1975) (refusing to set aside the jurors'\ndeclarations of impartiality where the voir dire testimony did not reflect the wave of\ncommunity hostility present in Irvin).\n\n\n       In Carr, we considered but declined the invitation to second-guess jurors'\nassurances of impartiality under facts comparable to Robinson's:\n\n       \"The jury pool here was far less polluted by preconceptions on guilt; in Irvin, 90 percent\n       of potential jurors believed the defendant was guilty. Here, [the trial judge] was not\n       forced to excuse 60 percent of the jury pool at the outset. The number of jurors ultimately\n       seated who had to set aside their earlier opinions was half of that who would have had to\n       do so in Irvin; and none of them expressed community outrage. We also are reassured\n       here by the protective measures taken by [the trial judge], including use of jury\n       questionnaires and individual voir dire.\" 300 Kan. at 78-79.\n\n\n       As in Carr, Irvin is distinguishable on the facts. In Irvin, the trial court dismissed\n62 percent of the entire venire based on firmly held opinions of guilt. Here, the figure was\n37 percent. Only a small percentage of the 83 panelists passed to general voir dire had\nbeen challenged based on preconceived opinions of guilt. Nearly all, 11 of 12 jurors,\nentered the box having formed no such opinion of defendant, a vast improvement over\n\n                                                    71\n\fIrvin, where 8 of 12 jurors held preconceived opinions of guilt, and even better than in\nCarr, where 4 of 12 held preconceived opinions. With few exceptions, jurors did not\nactively follow the media coverage, and media facts did not contain the \"smoking-gun\"\nreports of particular concern in Irvin, such as confessions, results of lie-detector tests, and\noffers to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. Judge Anderson seated jurors who had\nformed no opinions, \"who had forgotten or would need to be persuaded again.\" Patton,\n467 U.S. at 1034.\n\n\n       In sum, Judge Anderson exercised great care in designing an enhanced jury\nselection process. As defendant's expert, Dillehay, predicted, the process proved to be a\nhighly effective tool for combating the impact of potentially prejudicial pretrial\npublicity—one that yielded a qualified and impartial jury. As such, Judge Anderson had\nreasonable grounds to accept jurors' declarations of impartiality in this case, and\nRobinson has failed to demonstrate actual prejudice. See Gardner, 568 F.3d at 887-90\n(finding no Sixth Amendment prejudice where four jurors had formed opinions of guilt,\nprotective measures trial court implemented during jury selection added credibility to the\njuror's declarations of impartiality); Hale, 227 F.3d at 1332-33 (refusing to set aside\ndeclarations of impartiality where half of jurors entered box with opinions of guilt, but\nvoir dire did not uncover \"an atmosphere of hostility toward the defendant, nor did the\ntrial court have a difficult time in seating the jury\").\n\n\n       4. Did media interference demonstrate actual prejudice?\n\n       Robinson argues the media's interference with courtroom proceedings necessitated\na finding of actual prejudice.\n\n\n       First, he suggests media saturation hit the courthouse steps when a local radio\nstation conducted a publicity stunt by handing out \"Roll out the Barrels of Evidence\" T-\n\n                                               72\n\fshirts outside the courthouse during trial—the incident giving rise to the third renewed\nvenue change motion. However, Robinson does not dispute Judge Anderson's factual\nfinding that the jury was not exposed to this incident, and that, therefore, it could not\nhave affected the jurors' impartiality. We defer to the district judge's findings and concur\nwith his legal conclusion. See State v. Anderson, 291 Kan. 849, 855, 249 P.3d 425 (2011)\n(applying deference to trial court factual findings in motion to withdraw plea).\n\n\n       Second, Robinson suggests the media coverage reached the court's chambers on\nOctober 7, 2002, when jurors had the opportunity to view the front page of that morning's\ncopy of the Olathe Daily News—the incident giving rise to the second renewed venue\nchange motion. Defendant failed to establish that any juror actually saw the article, and\neven if a juror or jurors had, we have no basis in the record to disagree with Judge\nAnderson's finding that the content was not prejudicial. See State v. Bible, 175 Ariz. 549,\n566-67, 858 P.2d 1152 (1993) (finding no error in denying motion to change venue where\nappellant failed to demonstrate publicity resulted in actual prejudice).\n\n\n       Finally, Robinson suggests media coverage spilled into the courtroom itself when\njurors were exposed to prejudicial comments during voir dire. Robinson explains that\nduring questioning of one small group panel, a veniremember said she sensed that she\nwas \"in the presence of evil\" around Robinson. Defendant acknowledges this prospective\njuror was excused but argues Juror 298, who served on the jury, was subjected to the\ncomment. Of course, the statement in question was made by a prospective juror, not\npublicized by the media, and Juror 298's voir dire responses confirmed she had formed no\nopinion of guilt and was committed to deciding the case based on the evidence. Not\nsurprisingly, defendant did not challenge Juror 298 as biased by pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       Similarly, defendant argues that Juror 184, who served on the jury, heard a fellow\npanelist describe Robinson as a \"predator.\" Again, this comment was made by a fellow\n                                              73\n\fveniremember, not publicized by the media. Juror 184 entered the box without any\npreconceived opinion of Robinson's guilt, and defendant did not challenge this juror for\ncause on grounds related to bias or exposure to pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       Robinson offers no further examples of media interference during court\nproceedings, and none are apparent from the record. Robinson fails to demonstrate actual\nprejudice.\n\n\n       5. Did jurors ignore admonitions, demonstrating actual prejudice?\n\n       Finally, Robinson suggests veniremembers' refusal to abide by the district judge's\nadmonitions to avoid media coverage necessitated a finding of actual prejudice.\nDefendant believes prospective jurors did not follow this admonishment because several\npanelists knew they would not be sequestered, a fact allegedly reported in the media,\nbefore the district judge made the announcement.\n\n\n       The record does not support defendant's deduction-based argument. Judge\nAnderson expressly found that court administrators informed several veniremembers of\nthe fact they would not be sequestered before the district judge made the announcement.\nRobinson does not dispute this finding. Moreover, defendant fails to establish that any\nmember of his jury actually failed to comply with the district judge's admonitions. While\nit is concerning that some prospective jurors may have learned the trial court's position on\nsequestration from media sources, this does not establish actual prejudice, given the\nextensive protective measures Judge Anderson implemented throughout jury selection\nand the character and composition of jurors ultimately seated.\n\n\n\n\n                                             74\n\fStatutory Venue Challenge\n\n       Independently, Robinson argues Judge Anderson abused his discretion in denying\nhis motions under Kansas' venue change statute.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-2616(1) compels a venue change where the district judge \"is satisfied\nthat there exists in the county where the prosecution is pending so great a prejudice\nagainst the defendant that he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in that county.\" The\nburden falls on defendant to show prejudice in the community, not as a matter of\nspeculation but as a demonstrable reality. State v. McBroom, 299 Kan. 731, 746, 325 P.3d\n1174 (2014).\n\n\n       A court considers nine factors in deciding whether community prejudice has\nreached levels warranting a change of venue under K.S.A. 22-2616(1):\n\n\n       \"[1] the particular degree to which the publicity circulated throughout the community; [2]\n       the degree to which the publicity or that of a like nature circulated to other areas to which\n       venue could be changed; [3] the length of time which elapsed from the dissemination of\n       the publicity to the date of trial; [4] the care exercised and the ease encountered in the\n       selection of the jury; [5] the familiarity with the publicity complained of and its resultant\n       effects, if any, upon the prospective jurors or the trial jurors; [6] the challenges exercised\n       by the defendant in the selection of the jury, both peremptory and for cause; [7] the\n       connection of government officials with the release of the publicity; [8] the severity of\n       the offense charged; and [9] the particular size of the area from which the venire is\n       drawn.\" State v. Higgenbotham, 271 Kan. 582, 592, 23 P.3d 874 (2001).\n\n\n       On the record before the court, the first, second, fifth, and eighth factors favored\ntransfer of venue out of Johnson County at the time Judge Anderson ruled on the\nmotions. The first factor weighed in favor of venue change because Dahl's surveys\nevidenced widespread circulation of the pretrial publicity throughout the community. The\n                                                     75\n\fsecond factor weighed slightly in favor of changing venue as the surveys demonstrated\nthat case recognition was not as extensive in Harvey and Ellis Counties. Even so,\nrecognition of the case outside the venue of origin was extremely high, with 80 percent of\nHarvey County residents and 64 percent of Ellis County residents expressing recognition\nof the case. Thus, the weight of this factor in the overall analysis is diminished. As to the\nfifth factor, Dahl's venue study suggests media coverage had an effect on prospective\njurors because 67 percent of respondents believed defendant was \"probably\" or\n\"definitely\" guilty. Regarding the eighth factor, Robinson was charged with two counts of\ncapital murder and one count of first-degree murder. \"[T]he most serious charged\noffenses could not have been more severe or their potential consequences more\nirreversible.\" Carr, 300 Kan. at 82.\n\n\n       Five factors, including the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and ninth, favored denial of\neach of defendant's motions for venue change. The third factor weighed against a change\nof venue as more than 2 years had lapsed between the time the story first broke in June\n2000, when media coverage was at its height, and Robinson's trial in October 2002, when\ncoverage had dissipated. The fourth factor weighed heavily against a change of venue\nbecause Judge Anderson took great care in designing and implementing his four-phase\njury selection process. The sixth factor, challenges exercised, weighed in favor of\ndenying a venue change. Judge Anderson granted 92 of defendant's 100 challenges\nasserted on pretrial publicity grounds. Of those jurors unsuccessfully challenged, all but\none, Juror 39, was removed by peremptory challenge. Regarding the seventh factor, the\nmedia coverage was not materially connected to government officials. Robinson suggests\nthat the prosecutor participated in press conferences, but none of the media-published\nfacts defendant contends to be uniquely prejudicial were connected to the prosecution.\nFinally, the ninth factor weighed against a venue change because Johnson County had\none of the largest population bases in the state from which to draw the venire.\n\n\n                                             76\n\f       The statutory venue challenge in Carr provides a useful comparison because there\nthe same expert witness produced nearly identical survey results in a capital murder trial\nsituated in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the state. In every relevant category\n(case recognition, opinion of guilt, and strength of evidence), the survey responses in\nCarr revealed case recognition and prejudgment at levels higher than or equal to those in\nthis case. 300 Kan. at 49. Even so, the majority held that Judge Paul Clark did not abuse\nhis discretion under K.S.A. 22-2616 in denying defendants' motions for venue change.\n300 Kan. at 82. Given the similarity between the two cases, Carr offers compelling\nsupport for Judge Anderson's rulings.\n\n\n       In fact, the rulings are all the more defensible here because, unlike Carr,\nRobinson's venue expert, Dillehay, opined that enhanced voir dire could effectively\ninoculate the effects of extensive pretrial publicity. While Dillehay believed \"enhanced\nvoir dire\" would be infeasible from an administrative perspective, Judge Anderson was\nundaunted, implementing the very type of voir dire process Dillehay described. The\nprocess was lengthy but, in hindsight, proved highly effective in identifying and\nremoving those rendered unqualified by their exposure to pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       Our other case precedents offer additional support for Judge Anderson's rulings.\nSee State v. Longoria, 301 Kan. 489, 510-12, 348 P.3d 1128 (2015) (reasonable person\ncould have agreed with denial of motion to change venue despite fact that 97 percent of\nrespondents recognized the case and some panelists held strong opinions of guilt);\nMcBroom, 299 Kan. at 750-52 (no error in denial of venue change where nearly 70\npercent of respondents believed defendant \"probably\" or \"definitely\" guilty); State v.\nVerge, 272 Kan. 501, 505-08, 34 P.3d 449 (2001) (no error in denying venue change\nwhere 96.7 percent of Dickinson County residents recalled the case; 71.7 percent had\ntalked about the case; and 64 percent believed Verge was \"definitely\" or \"probably\"\nguilty); Higgenbotham, 271 Kan. at 593-95 (no error in denial of venue change where\n                                             77\n\f95.7 percent of Harvey County respondents recalled the case, 60.6 percent believed\ndefendant was guilty, and 53 percent believed there was evidence of guilt); State v.\nJackson, 262 Kan. 119, 129-32, 936 P.2d 761 (1997) (finding no error in denial of venue\nchange where 89.7 percent of respondents recalled the case and 60 percent had formed\nopinion of guilt); State v. Anthony, 257 Kan. 1003, 1007, 1014-15, 898 P.2d 1109 (1995)\n(affirming denial of motion to change venue where 97 percent of Salina residents had\nheard of case, 63.8 percent felt evidence of guilt was strong or overwhelming, and more\nthan half unsure of impartiality); State v. Swafford, 257 Kan. 1023, 1035-36, 897 P.2d\n1027 (1995) (companion case to Anthony).\n\n\n       Given the mix of evidence on the nine factors relevant to K.S.A. 22-2616(1) and\nrecognizing that some factors weighed in favor of venue change, while others weighed\nagainst such relief, we conclude that reasonable judges could have agreed with Judge\nAnderson's decision to deny the requested motions to change venue under the statute. See\nLongoria, 301 Kan. at 512; Carr, 300 Kan. at 84. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion.\n\n\nPresumed Prejudice\n\n       On appeal, defendant advanced only two theories supporting his venue challenge:\nactual prejudice under the Sixth Amendment and abuse of discretion under Kansas' venue\nchange statute. However Robinson's first motion to change venue on Sixth Amendment\ngrounds was pursued prior to voir dire—a point at which a claim of actual prejudice\nunder the Sixth Amendment was premature. Defendant's supporting memorandum relied,\nin part, on a presumed prejudice theory. Furthermore, in a Rule 6.09 (2014 Kan. Ct. R.\nAnnot. 52) letter to this court, defendant cites the United States Supreme Court's most\nrecent opinion addressing presumed prejudice, Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358,\n381-85, 130 S. Ct. 2896, 177 L. Ed. 2d 619 (2010).\n\n\n\n                                            78\n\f       \"[Because this is a death penalty case, this court is empowered to notice and\ndiscuss unassigned potential errors under K.S.A. 201[4] Supp. 21-6619(b).\" Carr, 300\nKan. at 16. Independently, the Kansas statute compels the court, with regard to sentence,\nto determine \"[w]hether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of\npassion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\" K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 21-6619(c)(1). In the\ninterests of justice, we consider presumed prejudice as a potential unassigned error on\nappeal.\n\n\n       Presumed prejudice occurs \"'where the pretrial publicity is so pervasive and\nprejudicial that we cannot expect to find an unbiased jury pool in the community. We\n\"presume prejudice\" before trial in those cases, and a venue change is necessary.'\" Carr,\n300 Kan. at 57.\n\n\n       In deciding whether to presume prejudice, courts consider seven factors\nenunciated in Skilling, 561 U.S. at 381-85:\n\n\n       \"(1) media interference with courtroom proceedings; (2) the magnitude and tone of the\n       coverage; (3) the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred;\n       (4) the amount of time that elapsed between the crime and the trial; (5) the jury's verdict;\n       (6) the impact of the crime on the community; and (7) the effect, if any, of a\n       codefendant's publicized decision to plead guilty.\" Carr, 300 Kan. at 62\n\n\n       In reviewing presumed prejudice claims, \"we apply a mixed standard of review,\nexamining the trial court's findings of fact for substantial competent evidence and the\nultimate legal conclusion drawn from the facts—whether to presume prejudice—de\nnovo.\" Longoria, 301 Kan. at 506.\n\n\n       Turning to the first Skilling factor, defendant argued in his second and third\nrenewed motions to change venue that a media circus spilled into the courtroom.\n                                                    79\n\fHowever, as set forth in defendant's actual prejudice challenge, defendant failed to\ndemonstrate any prejudice from the T-shirt and Olathe Daily News incidents giving rise\nto these motions.\n\n\n       As to the second Skilling factor, Robinson argues the media reported prejudicial\nfacts that were inadmissible at trial, such as Robinson's white-collar criminal history; his\nconnection to other missing persons; his involvement with other women; and his\nprosecution for fraud and murder in Missouri. However, the presumed prejudice doctrine\n\"cannot be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to information about a\nstate defendant's prior convictions or to news accounts of the crime with which he is\ncharged alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.\" Murphy, 421 U.S. at\n799. The pretrial publicity included in the record was predominantly fact-based reporting.\nSee Longoria, 301 Kan. at 507 (factor weighs against venue change where reporting is\nmore fact based than inflammatory). There were no \"smoking-gun\" reports, such as\nconfessions of defendant, results of lie detector testing, or defendant's offer to plead\nguilty to avoid the death penalty. See Skilling, 561 U.S. at 382-83 (the lack of \"evidence\nof the smoking-gun variety\" weighed against a finding of presumed prejudice).\nMoreover, Dahl's venue study suggested that some of these media facts were not widely\nrecognized by the community or the level of recognition was similar to that in other\nvenues.\n\n\n       The third Skilling factor—the size and characteristics of the community—weighed\nagainst a finding of presumed prejudice because Johnson County is one of the largest\ncounties in the state, with close to half a million residents.\n\n\n       Regarding the fourth Skilling factor, more than 2 years had elapsed from the time\nthe story first broke and the start of trial. Even so, survey results more than 1 year after\nRobinson's arrest showed a high degree of case recognition. This factor is inconclusive or\n                                              80\n\fweighed slightly against a finding of presumed prejudice. See Longoria, 301 Kan. at 507-\n08 (factor weighed against venue change where case recognition high but memory of\ndetails had faded); Carr, 300 Kan. at 68 (factor inconclusive where substantial time\nelapsed but evidence of juror recollection remained high at voir dire).\n\n       The fifth Skilling factor, the jury's verdict, was unknown at the time the district\njudge ruled and carries no weight in the analysis. See Longoria, 301 Kan. at 508.\n\n       On the sixth Skilling factor, none of the publicity of record clearly addresses the\nimpact of the crimes on the community. The record includes two articles warning of the\ndangers of online dating in the aftermath of the crimes, but these reports reflect opinions\nof a law enforcement officer and a journalist rather than community-wide sentiment. On\nthe other hand, Dahl's venue study revealed a high level of case recognition, suggesting\nthe crimes generated interest and were followed by members of the community. Thus this\nfactor may have weighed slightly in favor of a finding of presumed prejudice.\n\n\n       The seventh and final Skilling factor—publicized confession of a codefendant—\ndoes not factor into the analysis because Robinson alone was charged with the offenses in\nthis action and the State never charged any codefendant. Cf. Carr, 300 Kan. at 69.\n\n\n       In the end, only the sixth Skilling factor weighed in favor of a finding of presumed\nprejudice. The fifth and seventh factors were not relevant to the analysis, and the fourth\nfactor was inconclusive at best. The first, second, and third Skilling factors weighed\nagainst a finding of presumed prejudice at the time Judge Anderson ruled on each\nmotion.\n\n\n       \"The bar facing the defendant wishing to prove presumed prejudice from pretrial\npublicity is extremely high.\" United States v. McVeigh, 153 F.3d 1166, 1182 (10th Cir.\n1998), disapproved on other grounds by Hooks v. Ward, 184 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 1999).\n                                             81\n\fRelief is granted only in those rare cases \"where publicity 'created either a circus\natmosphere in the court room or a lynch mob mentality such that it would be impossible\nto receive a fair trial.'\" Goss v. Nelson, 439 F.3d 621, 628 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting Hale\nv. Gibson, 227 F.3d 1298, 1332 [10th Cir. 2000]). Based on our de novo review, and\nconsidering the Skilling factors in light of the evidence, the record does not establish that\n\"an irrepressibly hostile attitude pervaded the community.\" Stafford v. Saffle, 34 F.3d\n1557, 1567 (10th Cir. 1994). Thus Judge Anderson did not err in failing to presume\nprejudice under the Sixth Amendment. See Longoria, 301 Kan. at 508; Carr, 300 Kan. at\n65-70.\n\n\n                                      2. CONTINUANCE\n\n\n         Defendant next challenges the trial court's denials of his continuance motions. He\nbelieves Judge Anderson denied them to penalize him for exercising his right to counsel\nof choice. Independently, Robinson argues the rulings constitute an abuse of discretion.\n\n\nAdditional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n         On June 14, 2000, Judge Anderson appointed Kansas' Death Penalty Defense Unit\n(DPDU) to represent Robinson. The State filed its notice to pursue a death penalty phase\nsentencing proceeding, along with its alleged aggravating circumstance on March 2,\n2001. The DPDU actively litigated the case for 13 months, investigating the charges,\nfiling 39 substantive motions, and defending Robinson at preliminary hearing.\n\n\n         1. Substitution of Counsel\n\n         On July 18, 2001, attorney Bob L. Thomas entered his appearance as attorney of\nrecord for Robinson. Later that day, the DPDU filed a motion to withdraw. At the July\n23, 2001 hearing, Judge Anderson made inquiry regarding Thomas' qualifications.\n                                              82\n\fThomas had practiced as a licensed attorney for about 1 year before entering his\nappearance in this case. In the year, he had served as lead counsel on two noncapital jury\ntrials. Thomas had hired a private investigator and planned to add several legal assistants\nbut confirmed he would be the only attorney on the defense team.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson observed that Thomas did not meet Kansas Board of Indigents'\nDefense Services' qualification standards for appointment to a capital case and that\nRobinson's Sixth Amendment right to representation by counsel of choice had to be\ntempered by his right to competent and effective counsel. To balance these competing\ninterests, the district judge explored the possibility of having the DPDU remain in the\ncase as cocounsel. Thomas and defendant were willing to consent to such an\narrangement, with the understanding that Thomas would serve as lead counsel. The\nDPDU declined, arguing that the arrangement was unworkable and that Robinson was no\nlonger eligible for DPDU assistance.\n\n\n       At a continued hearing on July 27, 2001, Judge Anderson granted the DPDU's\nmotion to withdraw and announced his intention to appoint capital defense qualified\ncocounsel to assist Thomas. Neither Robinson nor Thomas objected.\n\n\n       On August 2, the trial court entered orders appointing Patrick Berrigan and Sean\nO'Brien, both of whom had extensive capital defense litigation experience, as cocounsel\nin this case for the purpose of representing Robinson \"[d]uring the prosecution and trial\nof said felony defendant, including sentencing.\" No party objected to these orders. Judge\nAnderson set the matter over for 1 month to give the newly formed defense team time to\nreview motions and to give Berrigan time to recover from heart bypass surgery. O'Brien's\nassociate attorney, Joseph Luby, and Berrigan's associate attorney, Jason Billam, also\nserved as members of Robinson's defense team.\n\n\n                                            83\n\f        2. First Motion for Continuance\n\n        On September 20, 2001, Robinson filed his first motion to continue trial, citing\nextensive discovery, cocounsel's commitment in other cases, and the need to develop a\nmitigation case—including gathering mitigation evidence; investigating the State's\naggravating circumstance; considering the possibility of psychological and neurological\nevaluations; interviewing defendant's family for testimony in the sentencing phase; and\nconducting a thorough background investigation of Robinson's educational, medical,\nemployment, and criminal histories—in support of the requested relief. Defense counsel\nclaimed it needed \"as much as a year to adequately prepare this case for trial\" and\nrequested the setting be moved from January 14 to September 16, 2002.\n\n\n        At the September 21, 2001, hearing, Judge Anderson emphasized that if he\ngranted the continuance, the new trial date would be a firm setting and no further\ncontinuance would be granted absent \"extraordinary\" circumstances. After confirming\nthat defense counsel had evaluated their schedules and understood any new trial date\nwould be firm, Judge Anderson granted the motion and reset trial for September 16,\n2002.\n\n\n        3. Thomas' Withdrawal and Second Motion for Continuance\n\n        On February 21, 2002, Thomas filed a motion to withdraw after receiving the\nState's February 13 supplemental discovery, which included documents indicating\nMarvin Ray, Thomas' former client, had offered to be a cooperating witness for the State.\n\n\n        Later that same day, Robinson filed his second motion for continuance, arguing\nthat counsel Berrigan and O'Brien (appointed counsel) and Thomas (retained counsel)\nhad an agreement as to the division of labor in the case, whereby retained counsel was\nhandling the guilt phase and appointed counsel the penalty phase. Robinson argued\n                                             84\n\fThomas' withdrawal, combined with appointed counsels' obligations in other cases, made\nit impossible to prepare Robinson's defense before the September 16, 2002, trial setting.\nAppointed counsel requested a 4-month continuance.\n\n\n       After confirming with Robinson that he was discharging Thomas as counsel of\nrecord, Judge Anderson granted Thomas' motion to withdraw and denied the continuance\nmotion during a February 28 hearing.\n\n\n       4. Robinson's Third Request for Continuance\n\n       On July 18, 2002, Robinson filed a third motion for continuance, alleging that\ndiscovery complications made it impossible to prepare Robinson's guilt phase defense\nbefore the September trial setting. On July 25, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing.\n\n\n              a. Discovery Delays\n\n       Phil Gibson, an investigator for the defense team, testified that it would take\nsubstantial time to complete witness interviews because of the State's massive endorsed\nwitness list, which included roughly 600 witnesses, 79 of whom had been endorsed after\nthe February 2001 preliminary hearing. However, the State had later provided a \"will\ncall\" list that narrowed down those most likely to testify to around 200.\n\n\n       Dean Stettler, Robinson's DNA expert, testified to delays related to the State's\nDNA disclosures. Stettler was engaged to evaluate law enforcement's DNA testing\nprocedures and advise the defense on the need for independent testing. On March 22,\n2002, he received three, 4-inch binders containing well in excess of 100 pages of law\nenforcement lab reports. The documents were in Bates-stamp order, but Stettler thought\nthe Bates-stamp order was random. He said it took him 3 weeks to organize the\ndocuments in a logical order.\n                                             85\n\f       Once the reports were organized, Stettler met with members of the JOCO Lab and\nfound 46 reports that had not been included in the State's disclosures. District Attorney\nPaul Morrison testified that the DNA testing was handled exclusively by the KCMO Lab\nand he did not give Stettler the 46 reports from the JOCO Lab because they pertained to\nhair analysis, tire track impression work, and latent print examinations, not DNA testing.\nNevertheless, Stettler felt the reports might be useful and received copies the same day\nStettler learned of the reports' existence.\n\n\n       Stettler also reviewed the KCMO Lab's case file and confirmed the State had\nproduced all reports. However, Stettler wanted to review the supporting data and\nrequested the same. The KCMO Lab voluntarily produced this data on CD-ROM. Stettler\ndid not maintain a current version of the software necessary to view the material\nelectronically however, and it took him a month to find an independent lab to print the\nmaterial for him.\n\n\n       Stettler admitted he had a complete copy of the files maintained by both crime labs\nwithin a few weeks of receiving the State's disclosures. At the time of the hearing, Stettler\nhad been in possession of the files for nearly 3 months and the CD-ROM for more than\n10 weeks. Stettler said he could complete his work and advise the defense team on the\nneed for independent testing within 3 to 4 weeks.\n\n\n       On September 5, 2002, defense counsel informed the district judge that DNA\nsamples had been sent to a lab for independent testing. No results were introduced at trial;\nnor are they included in the record on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                              86\n\f              b. Delay Related to the Division-of-Labor Agreement\n\n       Thomas offered testimony regarding the need for continuance in light of defense\ncounsels' division-of-labor agreement. He confirmed that the defense team had agreed he\nwould handle the guilt phase, while appointed counsel, Berrigan and O'Brien, would\nhandle the penalty phase. Thomas said the defense conducted work consistent with this\ndivision of labor agreement and committed to the September trial setting in reliance on it.\n\n\n       Thomas also testified to the events giving rise to his withdrawal or discharge.\nThomas had represented Marvin Ray in another matter before entering his appearance as\nRobinson's counsel in the summer of 2001. Shortly thereafter, he asked prosecutor\nMorrison whether the State had any \"jail-house snitches,\" specifically mentioning Ray.\nMorrison said a few inmates, including Ray, had contacted his office, but Morrison\nbelieved Ray lacked credibility and the State was not interested in his testimony. The\nState made no further mention of Ray until February 2002, when it produced a letter Ray\nhad written and other documents.\n\n\n       Morrison testified the Ray letter and documents were disclosed with sufficient\ntime to prepare Robinson's defense. Ray first contacted his office, offering to testify\nagainst Robinson, around July 2001. On October 4, the prosecution subpoenaed\ndocuments from Ray, and in response, correctional officials searched Ray's cell and\nfound documents responsive to the subpoena. Among these documents, they found a\nletter in which Ray described how he and two other people allegedly transported two\nfemale bodies to a farm near LaCygne and placed them in barrels in exchange for drugs.\nMorrison disclosed the Ray documents 7 months in advance of trial and confirmed that\nthe prosecution had no intention of calling Ray or introducing the documents at trial.\nNeither party, in fact, called Ray or introduced his documents at trial.\n\n\n\n                                             87\n\f       The court denied the motion for continuance.\n\n\n       5. Robinson's Fourth Motion to Continue Trial\n\n       On August 30, 2002, nearly 2 weeks before trial, defense counsel filed a motion\nfor continuance or, alternatively, for leave to withdraw, arguing that several discovery\nproblems continued to delay preparations. Defense counsel also claimed to need\nadditional time to develop Robinson's penalty phase defense, explaining they had hired a\nforensic social worker in January 2002 to conduct an investigation of Robinson's\nbackground and social history but learned in late July that the expert had made no\nprogress because of a disabling back injury suffered in a car accident.\n\n\n       Defense counsel hired a new mitigation expert, Scarlet Nerad. Although she had\nalready commenced work, defense counsel argued there was insufficient time for her to\ncomplete it before trial. Robinson requested an 8-month continuance to complete a social\nhistory report and a comprehensive mental evaluation.\n\n\n       At the September 5 hearing, Robinson offered Nerad's affidavit under seal, which\nthe district judge reviewed in camera over the State's objection. In the affidavit, Nerad\nclaimed that her preliminary investigation suggested Robinson had endured chronic and\nlife-threatening violence, abandonment, and neglect at the hands of his caretakers. When\nRobinson was 5 years old, his mother began assaulting him several times a week, without\nprovocation—beating him severely, threatening to kill him, and telling him she wished he\nwere dead or never born. As a small child, Robinson grew deeply attached to his infant\nbrother. The child fell ill and died, and Robinson's mother blamed him for the death.\nRobinson was devastated by the loss of his brother and shattered by the false accusations\nlodged by his mother. As Robinson grew older, the abuse escalated, often leaving him\nunconscious or bedridden, and his mother isolated him from other family members.\n\n                                             88\n\f       According to Nerad, such suspected abuse left Robinson vulnerable to psychiatric\ndiseases such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In fact, she claimed Robinson met\nthe criteria for PTSD. Nerad also believed Robinson exhibited symptoms of dissociative\nand mood disorders, evidenced by bouts of psychosis, extreme mood fluctuations, flat\naffect, and episodes of mania. Nerad's affidavit did not establish her qualifications to\ndiagnose such conditions.\n\n\n       Nerad made clear that her findings were preliminary and that she needed to\ncomplete substantial additional investigation to verify and document the abuse and its\neffect on Robinson before she could deliver a completed background and social history\nreport. She said she could not complete it in time for the September trial setting. She also\nnoted that other medical professionals would need her report to complete Robinson's\ncomprehensive mental assessment.\n\n\n       The continuance was denied.\n\n\n       6. Request for Continuance at the Outset of the Penalty Phase\n\n       On September 12, 2002, the defense filed a motion to transport Robinson to the\nUniversity of Kansas Medical Center (KU Medical Center) for MRI and PET scans. The\ndefense argued the testing was necessary for its expert, Dr. Dorothy O. Lewis, a professor\nof psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine, to conduct a psychiatric\nevaluation of Robinson.\n\n\n       Defense counsel offered the affidavit of Lewis under seal in support of the motion.\nLewis declared that, based on her preliminary review, there was reason to believe\nRobinson suffered from \"a bipolar mood disorder\"; he \"was severely physically and\n\n                                             89\n\femotionally abused throughout childhood\"; \"as a result of this maltreatment, he\nexperiences episodic dissociative states\"; \"as many as four generations of family\nmembers may have suffered\" similar mental illness; a 1991 MRI revealed brain\nabnormalities, \"allegedly a result of transient ischemic attacks\"; and \"Robinson\n. . . cannot appreciate the nature and strength of the evidence\" against him.\n\n\n       Lewis also said that, in order to make a credible diagnosis, she needed time to\ncomplete additional testing and evaluation, including psychiatric interviews; an MRI to\nassess possible brain changes over time; a PET scan to assess frontal lobe function; a\nneurologic evaluation; a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery; and a review of\nRobinson's background and social history. Without such information, Lewis asserted, it\nwould be impossible to render an opinion regarding Robinson's mental functioning.\n\n\n       The trial court granted the motion during a September 12 status conference.\n\n\n       On October 31, after the jury had convicted Robinson on all charges, defendant\nmoved for continuance of the penalty phase. Appointed counsel explained that they had\ndecided not to have Robinson transported to KU Medical Center for an MRI and PET\nscan because there was simply insufficient time for experts to complete the testing and\nevaluation needed to render a qualified opinion regarding Robinson's mental functioning.\n\n\n       The court denied the continuance.\n\n\nConstitutional Challenge\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge refused to continue the trial as punishment or in\nretaliation for his decision to hire Thomas and discharge the DPDU, violating his right to\ndue process. Although the argument is less than clear from the briefing, Robinson also\n\n                                             90\n\fappears to suggest the trial court unconstitutionally burdened his Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel of choice by having him bear the risk that counsel would be unprepared.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       Robinson's challenge is founded on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel—a\nfundamental right guaranteed to all criminal defendants. Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477\nU.S. 365, 374, 106 S. Ct. 2574, 91 L. Ed. 2d 305 (1986). \"It is hardly necessary to say\nthat the right to counsel being conceded, a defendant should be afforded a fair\nopportunity to secure counsel of his own choice.\" Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53, 53\nS. Ct. 55, 77 L. Ed. 158 (1932); see State v. Anthony, 257 Kan. 1003, 1018, 898 P.2d\n1109 (1995) (\"An essential element of the Sixth Amendment's protection of the right to\ncounsel is that a defendant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to secure counsel of\nhis or her choosing.\").\n\n\n       Not only is a defendant vested with the constitutional right to counsel of choice,\nbut also due process prevents States from punishing or retaliating against a defendant for\nexercising this constitutional right. Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S. 357, 363, 98 S. Ct.\n663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1978) (\"To punish a person because he has done what the law\nplainly allows him to do is a due process violation of the most basic sort.\").\n\n\n       However, \"[n]ot every restriction on counsel's time or opportunity to investigate or\nto consult with his client or otherwise to prepare for trial violates a defendant's Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel.\" Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 11, 103 S. Ct. 1610, 75 L.\nEd. 2d 610 (1983). The Supreme Court has explained:\n\n\n       \"Trial judges necessarily require a great deal of latitude in scheduling trials. Not the least\n       of their problems is that of assembling the witnesses, lawyers, and jurors at the same\n       place at the same time, and this burden counsels against continuances except for\n                                                     91\n\f        compelling reasons. Consequently, broad discretion must be granted trial courts on\n        matters of continuances; only an unreasoning and arbitrary 'insistence upon\n        expeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay' violates the right to the\n        assistance of counsel. Ungar v. Sarafite, 376 U.S. 575, 589[, 84 S. Ct. 841, 11 L. Ed. 2d\n        921] (1964).\" Morris, 461 U.S. at 11-12.\n\n\n        We have recognized that a defendant's right to counsel of choice \"cannot be\nmanipulated to impede the efficient administration of justice.\" Anthony, 257 Kan. at\n1019.\n\n\n        Where defendants allege the deprivation of rights under the Constitution, our court\nreviews such challenges de novo. See State v. Chamberlain, 280 Kan. 241, 255, 120 P.3d\n319 (2005) (determination of whether a statute violates the Constitution is a question of\nlaw over which we have unlimited de novo review); see also United States v. Hopkins,\n509 Fed. Appx. 765, 770 (10th Cir. 2013) (unpublished opinion) (reviewing de novo\nwhether judicial action violated Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice).\n\n\n        2. The Due Process Challenge\n\n        Robinson first contends that Judge Anderson's rulings were intended to punish\ndefendant for the delay that resulted when he retained Thomas in place of the DPDU.\n\n\n        The argument ignores and is entirely inconsistent with the fact that Judge\nAnderson accepted Thomas' entry of appearance and subsequently granted him a lengthy\ncontinuance. Thomas' filing of his entry of appearance provided Judge Anderson with a\ndirect and immediate opportunity to subvert Robinson's right to counsel of choice.\nThomas lacked the experience and resources to handle a capital defense alone, and Judge\nAnderson could have denied the entry of appearance altogether. See, e.g., United States v.\nCollins, 920 F.2d 619, 626 (10th Cir. 1990) (district court may deny a defendant's\n                                                      92\n\fcounsel of choice where attorney unable to provide competent representation). Instead, he\ngave effect to both of Robinson's Sixth Amendment interests—the right to counsel of\nchoice and the right to competent counsel—by accepting Thomas' entry of appearance\nand appointing qualified cocounsel.\n\n\n       Once Thomas was granted entry, Judge Anderson had a second opportunity to\n\"punish\" Robinson for retaining private counsel by denying his first motion for\ncontinuance. Instead, Judge Anderson granted the continuance, providing defense counsel\nroughly 1 full year to prepare for trial.\n\n\n       Robinson makes no mention of these rulings. Instead, he focuses on the district\njudge's denial of subsequent motions for a second continuance. In these rulings, Judge\nAnderson mentions that the DPDU handled the case and was on track for a trial setting in\nearly 2002, that Robinson discharged the DPDU by hiring Thomas, that the court\nappointed qualified cocounsel, and that the result was further delay. Robinson believes\nthese comments evidence Judge Anderson's retaliatory motive.\n\n\n       The argument lacks merit. When read in context, it is apparent that Judge\nAnderson referenced the DPDU and Robinson's decision to hire Thomas, not to blame\nRobinson for any delay resulting from that decision, but to summarize the sequence and\ntimeline of events, highlight the purpose and scope of the appointment of cocounsel, and\nemphasize that Thomas and appointed counsel had the benefit of more than a year's\nworth of the DPDU's work on the case. The district judge's reference to the delay that\nfollowed Thomas' entry of appearance and the appointment of cocounsel was an accurate\naccount. It also served to highlight that the district judge had granted a previous, lengthy\ncontinuance, a relevant factor in assessing whether defendant has established good cause\nfor a subsequent continuance under K.S.A. 22-3401. See State v. Snodgrass, 252 Kan.\n253, 264, 843 P.2d 720 (1992) (trial court did not abuse discretion in denying\n                                             93\n\fcontinuance where a prior continuance had been granted on eve of trial); United States v.\nSharrak, 527 Fed. Appx. 383, 388 (6th Cir. 2013) (unpublished opinion) (whether court\nhas granted previous continuances is an appropriate factor in analyzing subsequent\nmotions).\n\n\n       In each ruling, after outlining previous relevant events, Judge Anderson addressed\nthe specific grounds asserted for the requested continuance and/or made findings and\nconclusions as to why defendant had failed to establish good cause. In the end, Judge\nAnderson denied each request for a second continuance because he believed there was\nadequate time to prepare the defense, especially considering the resources of the defense\nteam and the fact that a lengthy continuance had been granted previously. The rulings\nwere an appropriate exercise of lawful discretion and cannot be construed as retaliatory.\nSee Anthony, 257 Kan. at 1019-20 (trial court did not abuse discretion or otherwise\ninterfere with counsel of choice where it did not attempt to restrain counsel from entering\nthe case and only declined the request to continue trial to allow new counsel time to\nprepare).\n\n\n       3. The Sixth Amendment Challenge\n\n       Robinson next argues the district judge relied on a number of factual errors in\ndenying his motions for continuance. While this argument sounds more akin to an abuse\nof discretion challenge, Robinson seems to suggest the trial court's alleged factual errors\neffectively placed an unconstitutional burden on his right to counsel of choice.\n\n\n       Specifically, Robinson contends the district judge erred in fact, thereby burdening\nthe right to counsel of choice, by: (1) finding that Robinson had discharged the DPDU;\n(2) minimizing the burden defense counsel experienced in managing discovery; and (3)\n\n\n\n                                             94\n\ffailing to account for the delay caused by the State's tardy and disorganized DNA testing\ndisclosures.\n\n       First, Robinson argues the district judge erroneously found that Robinson had\ndischarged the DPDU. In the July 25, 2002 ruling denying defendant's third motion to\ncontinue trial, Judge Anderson said, \"When Mr. Thomas got in this case, he got in it\nbecause the defendant discharged, essentially through hiring Mr. Thomas, the capital\ndefense team and retained an attorney of his own choice.\" (Emphasis added.) Likewise,\nin the October 31, 2002, ruling denying defendant's motion to continue the penalty phase,\nJudge Anderson explained that \"in the summer of 2001 Mr. Robinson chose to discharge\nthe capital defense team provided to him by the State of Kansas. . . . and did so by\nretaining counsel, Mr. Thomas, who undertook to represent him at that time.\" (Emphasis\nadded.)\n\n\n       Judge Anderson's rulings indicate that Robinson effectively discharged the DPDU\nby retaining Thomas. The record supports this finding. During a July 23, 2001, in-camera\nproceeding, Judge Anderson discussed the status of defendant's representation in the\npresence of Robinson, the DPDU, and Thomas. During the proceeding, Judge Anderson\nconfirmed that it was Robinson's desire to remove DPDU counsel and substitute Thomas\nas counsel in their place.\n\n\n       More importantly, whether the trial court characterized the DPDU's exit as a\n\"discharge\" or a \"withdrawal\" is a factual distinction without a legal difference. Judge\nAnderson did not deny any of defendant's motions based on a finding that the DPDU\nexited the case as a result of discharge, as opposed to withdrawal. Cf. State v. Nelson, 296\nKan. 692, 694, 294 P.3d 323 (2013) (\"Judicial discretion is abused if judicial action . . . is\nbased on an error of fact, i.e., if substantial competent evidence does not support a factual\nfinding on which a prerequisite conclusion of law or the exercise of discretion is based.\").\n\n                                             95\n\fMoreover, it is unclear how the characterization of the DPDU's exit as a discharge instead\nof a withdrawal could or would have placed any additional burden on Robinson's Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel of choice.\n\n\n       Second, Robinson argues Judge Anderson improperly \"minimized\" testimony\nregarding the delay created by the number of witnesses endorsed by the State. Judge\nAnderson addressed this issue specifically in denying the third motion for continuance,\nfinding that Kansas law compelled the prosecution to endorse all potential witnesses\nregardless of the extent of their knowledge and that the defense team's resources,\nincluding four attorneys, an investigator, and six legal interns, were sufficient to\novercome the discovery complications and complete preparations in the time allotted for\ntrial. These findings were supported by substantial competent evidence in the record, and\nwe cannot say that no reasonable judge would have agreed with Judge Anderson's ruling.\nRobinson's real complaint is that Judge Anderson did not assign his evidence the weight\nhe believed it deserved. Such a dispute does not establish grounds for error. See In re\nEstate of Farr, 274 Kan. 51, 68, 49 P.3d 415 (2002) (\"It is the factfinder's function to\ndetermine the weight and credibility of the witnesses. Appellate courts will not pass upon\nthe credibility of witnesses or reweigh conflicting evidence.\").\n\n\n       Finally, Robinson believes Judge Anderson minimized the prejudice occasioned\nby the State's tardy and disorganized disclosures to defendant's DNA expert. Again,\nJudge Anderson addressed this issue specifically in denying the third motion for\ncontinuance, explaining that any delay the expert experienced did not prevent appointed\ncounsel from continuing to work on other aspects of Robinson's defense. On appeal,\nRobinson admits the expert's delay did not impede counsel's ability to prepare for trial but\nargues it prevented the defense from completing an independent DNA analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                             96\n\f       We find the argument unavailing. The defense team did not pursue independent\ntesting until after the State completed and disclosed its DNA lab reports. Thereafter,\nmuch of the delay Stettler experienced was the result of his decisions on time\nmanagement. We have found no error in the denial of continuance under similar\ncircumstances. See State v. Lewis, 299 Kan. 828, 846-48, 326 P.3d 387 (2014);\nSnodgrass, 252 Kan. at 264.\n\n\n       Moreover, during the July 25 evidentiary hearing, Stettler admitted he could\ncomplete his work and advise the defense within 3 to 4 weeks—leaving adequate time\nbefore trial. On September 5, defense counsel informed Judge Anderson that samples had\nbeen sent to a lab for independent analysis, but the results of that testing were never\nintroduced at trial or included in the record on appeal. Thus the district judge had no basis\nupon which to make a finding of good cause warranting a continuance. See State v.\nDaigle, 220 Kan. 639, 643-44, 556 P.2d 400 (1976) (affirming denial of continuance\nwhere defendant failed to show relief would result in favorable evidence from a\ncompleted fracture analysis), cert. denied 430 U.S. 983 (1977); see also Coy v. Renico,\n414 F. Supp. 2d 744, 777 (E.D. Mich. 2006) (continuance properly denied where\npetitioner failed to show independent DNA testing would yield exculpatory evidence).\nNothing in the record supports Robinson's claim that discovery complications foreclosed\nindependent DNA testing or use of the results of such testing at trial. In fact, the evidence\nstrongly suggests otherwise.\n\n\n       In the end, we hold that the denial of continuance did not violate Robinson's due\nprocess or Sixth Amendment rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                             97\n\fStatutory Challenge\n\n       In addition to his constitutional challenges, Robinson argues the trial court abused\nits discretion in denying his requests for continuance. For purposes of clarity, the\nchallenge is divided into two subissues: (1) whether the trial court abused its discretion\nin denying a continuance to allow counsel additional time to prepare the guilt phase\ndefense; and (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a continuance to\nallow counsel additional time to prepare the penalty phase defense.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       K.S.A. 22-3401 provides that \"[c]ontinuances may be granted to either party for\ngood cause shown.\" \"In a criminal case, the decision to continue a case lies within the\nsound discretion of the district court.\" State v. Haney, 299 Kan. 256, 259, 323 P.3d 164\n(2014). Thus, we review a denial of continuance for abuse of discretion. State v. Burnett,\n300 Kan. 419, 436, 329 P.3d 1169 (2014). Judicial discretion is abused where judicial\naction is arbitrary, or based on an error of law or fact. State v. Warrior, 294 Kan. 484,\n505, 277 P.3d 1111 (2012). The party asserting abuse of judicial discretion has the\nburden to prove an abuse of discretion on appeal. State v. Smith-Parker, 301 Kan. 132,\n161, 340 P.3d 485 (2014). Additionally, where a defendant claims the denial of\ncontinuance interfered with his or her ability to present a defense, we review the question\nde novo. Lewis, 299 Kan. at 846.\n\n\n       The legal standard for granting a continuance is \"good cause\" shown. K.S.A. 22-\n3401; State v. Carter, 284 Kan. 312, 318, 160 P.3d 457 (2007). However, where a\ncontinuance is sought to retain new counsel, we consider the following five factors:\n\n\n       \"(1) whether a continuance would inconvenience witnesses, the court, counsel, or the\n       parties; (2) whether other continuances have been granted; (3) whether legitimate reasons\n                                                  98\n\f       exist for the delay; (4) whether the delay is the fault of the defendant; and (5) whether\n       denial of a continuance would prejudice the defendant.\" Anthony, 257 Kan. at 1019.\n\n\nRobinson argues the Anthony factors should apply to his challenge. However, Anthony\napplies in situations where defendant seeks a continuance for the purpose of retaining\nnew counsel, thereby placing the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice\nin competition with the court's discretionary power to deny continuances. 257 Kan. at\n1019. At the time the court denied the defendant's second continuance motion, appointed\ncounsel, Berrigan and O'Brien, had served as counsel to Robinson for nearly 7 months.\nRobinson never requested or retained new counsel after Thomas' discharge, and\nappointed counsel represented him throughout both phases of trial. As such, Robinson's\nSixth Amendment right to counsel of choice was never implicated and Anthony's five-\nfactor test does not apply. See State v. Ly, 277 Kan. 386, 391, 85 P.3d 1200 (five-factor\ntest did not apply where defendant \"did not request a continuance so he could retain new\ncounsel\"), cert. denied 541 U.S. 1090 (2004).\n\n\n       2. Continuance to Provide Additional Time to Prepare Guilt Phase\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred in denying his requests for a second\ncontinuance in the face of evidence establishing: (1) the division-of-labor agreement,\nwhereby retained counsel, Thomas, was to prepare the guilt phase defense and appointed\ncounsel, Berrigan and O'Brien, the penalty phase defense; (2) the unexpected discharge or\nwithdrawal of Thomas; and (3) the impact of Thomas' withdrawal on trial preparations.\n\n\n       The record includes competing evidence regarding the propriety of a continuance\nnotwithstanding Robinson's arguments. Although defense counsel took it upon\nthemselves to divide the labor, Judge Anderson was unaware of this decision. His orders\nappointing counsel specified that Berrigan and O'Brien were to represent defendant at\ntrial and through sentencing. Judge Anderson found the division-of-labor agreement\n                                                    99\n\ffrustrated the purpose of his orders. Also, as Judge Anderson explained, conflicts and\nother matters giving rise to the withdrawal of counsel are not unforeseeable, casting\nfurther doubt on the reasonableness of defense counsels' reliance on this division of labor.\nThere is also reason to question how strictly counsel adhered to the arrangement. Soon\nafter their appointment, Berrigan and O'Brien signed pleadings and motions, played a\nleading role at motions hearings and status conferences, and handled the examination of\nwitnesses and argument at the January 2002 evidentiary hearing on the venue motion. All\nof these events were part of the guilt phase of the case.\n\n\n       The record also provides direct support for Judge Anderson's findings and\nconclusions. While Thomas' withdrawal certainly increased appointed counsel's workload\nand responsibility, they were not starting from scratch. Berrigan and O'Brien had served\nas counsel to Robinson for roughly 7 months prior to Thomas' withdrawal, and they had\nanother 7 months to prepare thereafter, thanks to Judge Anderson's order granting\nRobinson's first continuance motion. Appointed counsel also had the benefit of the\npreparation Thomas and the DPDU had done over the course of nearly 2 years. After\nThomas' withdrawal, O'Brien's associate attorney Luby entered his appearance for the\ndefense, and Robinson never sought appointment of new counsel.\n\n\n       We have not previously reviewed the denial of a continuance under the particular\nfacts presented here. Even so, Anthony provides some useful parallels under similar facts.\nThere, defendant moved for a 2-month continuance 18 days before trial so that\ndefendant's counsel of choice, Charles Atwell, could have adequate time to become\ninvolved in the case and prepare for trial. Atwell informed the court he could not accept\nappointment without a continuance. Defendant had already received a previous\ncontinuance. The trial court granted defendant leave to substitute Atwell as counsel but\ndenied the continuance. We found no abuse of discretion in the ruling. 257 Kan. at 1019-\n20.\n                                             100\n\f       Authority from other jurisdictions lends more direct support for Judge Anderson's\nrulings. See United States v. Messervey, 317 F.3d 457, 462 (5th Cir. 2002) (no error in\ndenying 4-month continuance after withdrawal; court had granted previous continuances\ngiving counsel a full year to prepare and new counsel benefitted from predecessor's\npreparation); People v. Johnson, 205 Ill. 2d 381, 406-07, 275 Ill. Dec. 820, 793 N.E.2d\n591 (2002) (no error in denial of continuance to allow counsel additional time to prepare\ndefense in capital murder prosecution where trial court had granted previous\ncontinuances totaling 55 days and public defender already had prepared for 3 months);\nFlinn v. State, 563 N.E.2d 536, 543 (Ind. 1990) (no error in denial of continuance to give\nnew counsel more preparation time; new counsel had benefit of predecessor's 16 months\nof preparation); State v. Sanders, 92 Ohio St. 3d 245, 276, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001) (no\nerror in denial of continuance to allow new lead counsel time to prepare defense in\ncapital murder prosecution; newly appointed counsel had 2 full months to prepare and\ncocounsel had been on the case for 15 months); State v. Hester, 324 S.W.3d 1, 35-36\n(Tenn. 2010) (no error in denial of continuance in capital murder case where one of\ndefendant's two lawyers withdrew; remaining attorney had served as lead counsel for\nalmost 3 years; case had encountered lengthy delays).\n\n\n       In light of the record here, we conclude a reasonable factfinder could have agreed\nwith Judge Anderson's rulings. Therefore, we hold that the district judge properly\nexercised his lawful discretion by refusing requests for a second continuance to prepare\nthe guilt phase defense.\n\n\n       3. Continuance to Provide Additional Time to Prepare Penalty Phase\n\n       Robinson also contends he was entitled to a continuance so counsel could fully\ndevelop his mitigation defense.\n                                           101\n\f       The problem with Robinson's challenge is he failed to make an adequate proffer as\nto what mitigation evidence would have been developed had Judge Anderson granted a\nsecond continuance. We discussed the movant's duty to make such a proffer in Burnett,\n300 Kan. 419, where defendant requested a continuance in order to prepare a redacted\nand admissible version of the videotaped recording of his police interview. Defendant\nargued the district court's refusal to grant a continuance denied him a defense at trial\nbecause without the video recording, he was unable to impeach law enforcement\ntestimony regarding the interview. However, defendant did not specify \"how [law\nenforcement officer's] testimony was inconsistent with the statements recorded on the\nvideo or even explain how [law enforcement officer's] testimony could have been\nimpeached by the video.\" 300 Kan. at 438. We held that \"[w]ithout specific references to\nhow the video would have bolstered his defense or impeached [law enforcement officer's]\ntestimony, Burnett ha[d] failed to show that 'good cause' supported his request for a\ncontinuance to prepare a redacted version of the video.\" 300 Kan. at 438.\n\n\n       The same principle holds true in the context of sentencing. In State v. Beaman,\n295 Kan. 853, 286 P.3d 876 (2012), defendant sought a sentencing continuance to\nresearch an Eighth Amendment argument under Jessica's Law that might have applied at\nsentencing. In affirming the denial of continuance, we explained: \"[S]imply arguing that\nthere 'may' be an issue worthy of another motion is insufficient to justify a continuance.\nMere speculation that with more time something favorable may happen for the defendant\ndoes not constitute good cause. [Citation omitted.]\" 295 Kan. at 864.\n\n\n       We thus conclude it would be unacceptably speculative to presume their\npreliminary findings would be consistent with those produced in a final analysis. Here,\nRobinson offered the affidavits of Nerad and Lewis in support of their motions for\ncontinuance to develop mitigation evidence. Both speculated, based on their initial\n                                             102\n\freviews, that Robinson may have suffered abuse as a child and impairment to his mental\nfunctioning. Nevertheless, these findings were preliminary. Both Nerad and Lewis made\nclear that they could not render qualified and reliable opinions on the subjects absent\nfurther investigation. Defense counsel implicitly acknowledged the unreliability of these\nexperts' preliminary findings during posttrial argument, explaining the defense did not\ncall Nerad or Lewis as witnesses because a \"half-baked\" mitigation defense would have\nbeen worse than no defense at all.\n\n\n       Counsel conceded at oral argument that defendant failed to make a proffer of the\nevidence that would have been introduced in the event of a continuance. We cannot find\nfault in Judge Anderson's decisions in the absence of such a showing. See People v.\nDoolin, 45 Cal. 4th 390, 451, 87 Cal. Rptr. 3d 209, 198 P.3d 11 (2009) (trial court did not\nerr in denying penalty phase continuance to allow defendant to develop childhood abuse\nissues; defendant \"made no showing that he could produce specific, relevant mitigating\nevidence within a reasonable time\"); People v. Jenkins, 22 Cal. 4th 900, 1038, 95 Cal.\nRptr. 2d 377, 997 P.2d 1044 (2000) (court within its discretion to refuse continuance to\nallow penalty phase consultant time to undertake investigation of character and\nbackground where defendant did not demonstrate it would produce specific relevant\nmitigation evidence); People v. Chapman, 194 Ill. 2d 186, 241-42, 743 N.E.2d 48 (2000)\n(trial court did not abuse discretion in denying 60-day continuance 3 weeks before trial to\nallow penalty phase expert to develop mitigation case where previous continuance had\nbeen granted and defendant failed to show how expert testimony would have added to the\nmitigation evidence); State v. Rimmer, 250 S.W.3d 12, 41 (Tenn. 2008) (no error in\ndenying continuance to allow expert to develop mitigation evidence where defendant\nfailed to show what, if any, mitigation evidence would have been uncovered had\ncontinuance been granted).\n\n\n\n\n                                            103\n\f       Robinson, relying on Haney, 299 Kan. 256, suggests the mere possibility that a\ncontinuance might yield fruitful mitigation evidence establishes good cause for relief. In\nHaney, defendant negotiated an opportunity to pursue a durational sentencing departure\nin exchange for his nolo contendere plea to various sex offenses. Prior to sentencing,\ndefendant sought a 1-month continuance to compensate for delays in funding for a sex\noffender evaluation expert. The trial court denied the motion, erroneously finding that\nsuch an evaluation was not relevant and that defendant could testify to the aberrational\nnature of his crimes without expert testimony. The Court of Appeals held that the district\ncourt abused its discretion but found the error harmless because defendant did not offer\nany evidence in support of the durational departure. We reversed, unable to \"declare that\nthe lost opportunity to present evidence in mitigation of punishment was harmless in this\ncase.\" 299 Kan. at 262.\n\n\n       Robinson's reliance on Haney is misplaced. There, the district court's denial of\ncontinuance was founded on legally erroneous findings, and the Court of Appeal's\ndeclaration that the error was harmless would have deprived defendant of the very benefit\nthat induced him to enter his plea agreement—the opportunity to pursue a durational\ndeparture. No such facts are present here, and Haney does not alter Robinson's duty to\nmake a proffer of the mitigation evidence he would have developed and presented had he\nbeen granted a continuance.\n\n\n                                 3. MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS\n\n\n       Defendant raises five issues related to the district court's denial of his motions to\nsuppress evidence obtained pursuant to pen registers, wiretaps, search warrants, and\nwarrantless trash searches. Specifically, Robinson contends: (1) District Judge Larry\nMcClain was not neutral and detached; (2) he lacked jurisdiction to issue extraterritorial\nsearch warrants; (3) law enforcement officers exceeded their territorial jurisdiction; (4)\n                                             104\n\flaw enforcement officers' trash searches violated defendant's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy; and (5) wiretap orders were issued without a sufficient showing of necessity.\n\n\nAdditional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      1. Judge McClain's Former Prosecution of Robinson\n\n      In the mid-1980s, McClain was a prosecutor in the Johnson County District\nAttorney's office. In 1984, he investigated a consumer complaint filed by the owners of\nBack Care Systems, International (Back Care), alleging Robinson defrauded Back Care\nthrough a bogus invoicing scheme through his company, Equi-plus.\n\n\n       In hopes of avoiding criminal prosecution, Robinson prepared four sham\naffidavits, all purportedly authored by vendors claiming the invoices were genuine. One\naffidavit appeared to be signed by Paula Godfrey, one of several missing persons\nconnected to Robinson. After reviewing the affidavits, McClain told Robinson's attorney,\nRonald Wood, that Robinson was the \"master of the copying machine.\"\n\n\n      On March 29, 1985, McClain filed a criminal complaint, along with a supporting\naffidavit, charging Robinson with one count of felony theft by deception. McClain\nhandled the Back Care case through preliminary hearing on May 29, 1985. On June 10,\nMcClain was appointed to the District Court bench in Johnson County. Steven J.\nObermeier assumed the prosecution of the Back Care case from that point forward.\nObermeier endorsed Godfrey as a witness because she had purportedly signed one of the\nsham affidavits. At the time, Obermeier did not know Robinson was a suspect in\nGodfrey's disappearance.\n\n\n      Obermeier tried the Back Care case in January 1986. The State called Judge\nMcClain as a witness to establish that the affidavits were shams and to lay foundation to\n                                           105\n\fadmit them into evidence. The trial judge, however, limited Judge McClain's testimony to\nfoundation issues only, and Judge McClain did not testify beyond that boundary. The jury\nconvicted Robinson on the theft by deception count.\n\n\n       Just after Robinson's conviction, Obermeier prosecuted a second case against him,\nthe Kuti case, which arose from a phony land deal Robinson concocted to defraud\ninvestors. Judge McClain was endorsed as a witness in the Kuti case because Obermeier\nbelieved Robinson's failure to disclose the Back Care prosecution constituted a material\nomission, an essential element of the securities fraud count pled in that case. Judge\nMcClain had no other involvement in the prosecution of the Kuti case.\n\n\n       Robinson entered a plea agreement in the Kuti case, and the trial judge joined the\nBack Care and Kuti cases for purposes of sentencing. In his sentencing brief, Obermeier\nmade reference to the fact that Robinson was the last person seen with Stasi before her\ndisappearance, but Obermeier had not received this information from Judge McClain.\n\n\n       In September 1987, when Robinson first became eligible, Obermeier filed a\nrecommendation to deny parole. Obermeier attached then-prosecutor McClain's affidavit\nfrom the Back Care case in support of the recommendation. Judge McClain had no\ninvolvement in preparing Obermeier's recommendation.\n\n\n       At the suppression hearing, the parties stipulated that (1) during his tenure with the\nDistrict Attorney's office, McClain had no knowledge that Robinson was a suspect in any\nhomicides or abductions; (2) upon assuming the bench in June 1985, Judge McClain\nexclusively handled a civil docket, with the exception of presiding over various\napplications for search warrants, wiretaps, and pen registers; and (3) once appointed,\nJudge McClain disengaged from all law enforcement-related activities.\n\n\n                                            106\n\f       2. Prosecution's Pursuit of Inquisition, Pen Registers, and Wiretaps\n\n       The Johnson County District Attorney's office regularly submitted wiretap and pen\nregister applications to an administrative or civil judge. After the retirement of the civil\njudge who had historically handled these matters, Judge McClain began receiving the\napplications because he was a civil judge who had familiarity with criminal law.\n\n\n       On March 30, 2000, prosecutor Morrison approached Judge McClain and secured\nan order to open an inquisition. Although it was unusual to approach a civil judge for an\ninquisition, Morrison felt there was a strong possibility he would later request pen\nregisters and wiretaps, so he wanted to begin proceedings with the wiretap judge.\n\n\n       In April 2000, the prosecution secured orders from Judge McClain for pen\nregisters on Robinson's phones.\n\n\n       On May 19, the prosecution submitted a wiretap application to Judge McClain.\nLenexa Police Detective Dave Brown offered a 31-page supporting affidavit containing\nhundreds of averments set forth in 78 separate paragraphs.\n\n\n       The affidavit detailed law enforcement's extensive investigation of Robinson and\ndescribed facts uncovered through the use of a variety of traditional investigatory\ntechniques, including surveillance of witnesses and the defendant, warrantless trash\nsearches, consensual searches, investigatory interviews, inquisitional subpoenas, and\nanalysis of pen register data.\n\n\n       Specifically, the affidavit outlined Robinson's relationship with Trouten, his likely\ninvolvement in her recent disappearance, and his attempts to conceal the same. It\nidentified facts suggesting Robinson had targeted new potential victims in the BDS&M\n\n                                             107\n\fcommunity, including Trouten's friends, Remington and Taylor, as well as J.M. and V.N.\nIt also summarized law enforcement's analysis of pen register data and inquisition\nsubpoenas, which demonstrated that Robinson was dependent on cellular and telephone\ncommunications to develop these relationships and further his criminal conduct.\n\n\n       The affidavit also touched on a few facts that were similar or common to both the\nBack Care case and the Robinson investigation. First, Brown made a passing reference to\nRobinson's convictions in the Back Care and Kuti cases, the former of which Judge\nMcClain handled through the preliminary hearing. Brown also made brief reference to\ntwo companies connected to Robinson, Equi II and Equruz II, that utilized a name similar\nto Equi-plus, Robinson's company implicated in the Back Care case. Finally, the affidavit\nincluded averments describing Robinson's connection to and possible involvement in the\ndisappearance of Paula Godfrey, who allegedly signed one of the sham affidavits in the\nBack Care case.\n\n\n       When prosecutors Morrison and Sara Welch, along with Brown, approached Judge\nMcClain for the wiretap, the judge said he had prosecuted Robinson in a financial crimes\ncase in the early to mid-1980s. Morrison testified that Judge McClain said something to\nthe effect that he \"knew the defendant as a, quote, con man or, quote, shyster,\" but\ncharacterized his comments as very brief and benign. Brown testified that Judge McClain\nsaid only that he had prosecuted Robinson for some financial crimes in the past. Judge\nMcClain did not discuss any specific details about the Back Care case, the witnesses\ninvolved, or any other criminal complaints against Robinson.\n\n\n       3. Search Warrants\n\n       As the investigation progressed, prosecutors approached Judge McClain for search\nwarrants. On June 2, 2000, law enforcement officers secured warrants to search\n\n                                            108\n\fRobinson's Olathe residence and storage locker. The following morning, prosecutors\nsecured a warrant to search Robinson's Linn County property.\n\n\n      The application to search the Linn County property was supported by Brown's\naffidavit, which contained dozens of averments set forth in 35 separate paragraphs\ncovering 10 single-spaced pages. The affidavits for all three search warrants were nearly\nidentical. The first 20 paragraphs described Robinson's connection to Trouten, her\ndisappearance, and Robinson's probable involvement in it. In paragraphs 21-30, Brown\nexplained how Robinson had targeted new women in the BDS&M community. The\naffidavit also included averments establishing probable cause that evidence of Robinson's\ncrimes would be found at each location.\n\n\n      As with the wiretap affidavit, Brown made reference to Robinson's prior\nconvictions in the Back Care and Kuti cases, identified businesses tied to Robinson that\nused a name similar to Equi-plus, and disclosed Robinson's possible connection to the\ndisappearance of Godfrey.\n\n\n      On June 2, 2000, Lenexa police officials contacted Linn County Sheriff Marvin\nStites to discuss plans for executing a search warrant for Robinson's Linn County\nproperty. After securing the warrant, Linn County Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Danciak\narrived at Robinson's Linn County property around 9:30 a.m., just as officers from\nLenexa and Overland Park were arriving. Danciak reviewed and executed a written\nrequest for assistance document drafted by Lenexa police. The document memorialized\nLinn County's request to Lenexa and other agencies for assistance in executing the search\nwarrant. Law enforcement officers began the search after Danciak signed the document.\n\n\n\n\n                                           109\n\f       4. Warrantless Searches of Robinson's Trash\n\n       Before obtaining search warrants, law enforcement officers employed a variety of\ninvestigatory techniques, including searching Robinson's trash placed outside for\ncollection at his Olathe residence. Lenexa Police Detective Michael Bussell drove by\nRobinson's residence 50 to 60 times from March to June 2000, exploring the location,\ndeveloping strategies for collecting Robinson's trash, and coordinating trash pulls on\ncollection days. Lenexa police did not disclose their activities to Olathe police.\n\n\n       Robinson lived inside Santa Barbara Estates, a private mobile home community\nthat maintained its own streets, sidewalks, and lighting. A private trash company,\nDeffenbaugh, regularly entered the community to collect residents' trash. At the\ncommunity's main entrance, there was a \"Santa Barbara Estates\" sign on the south side of\nthe road. Several yards beyond this sign, there was a \"Speed Limit 20\" sign. Just below\nthe speed limit sign, affixed to the same post, was a smaller sign captioned, \"Private\nProperty No Soliciting.\" There were no \"no trespassing\" signs posted within the\ncommunity. Santa Barbara Estates was not a gated community, and there was no physical\nbarrier impeding access into the area. Only transporters hauling mobile homes into or out\nof the community were required to check in before entering. If a person wanted to visit a\nresident, he or she was free to drive into the community, walk up to a resident's home,\nand knock on the resident's door. Olathe police freely entered the community to execute\nwarrants and handle other police business.\n\n\n       Robinson's residence was located 1/4 to 1/2 mile beyond the entrance to Santa\nBarbara Estates. The residence could not be seen, or views of it were limited, from any\nstreet outside Santa Barbara Estates.\n\n\n\n\n                                             110\n\f       Each time a law enforcement officer pulled Robinson's trash, it had been set out\nfor collection in a container placed toward the end of an asphalt parking area, near or\nagainst the curb line, where the parking pad intersected the roadway, approximately 10 to\n12 feet outside of the fence that surrounded the residence. When Bussell saw the trash\ncontainer placed in this location, he would radio another officer to collect it from the\ncontainer. However, on other occasions, a law enforcement officer, after making\narrangements with a security officer at Deffenbaugh, would ride on the trash truck and\ncollect the trash directly or would supervise Deffenbaugh's collection and arrange to pick\nit up at a location away from Santa Barbara Estates.\n\n\nNeutral and Detached Magistrate Challenge\n\n       Robinson argues the evidence seized pursuant to, or as a result of, the four pen\nregisters, one wiretap order, and four search warrants Judge McClain issued in this case\nshould have been suppressed because he was not a neutral and detached magistrate.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       Our standard of review for motions to suppress evidence is well established:\n\n\n               \"An appellate court reviews a district court's decision on a motion to suppress\n       using a bifurcated standard. Without reweighing the evidence, the district court's findings\n       of fact are reviewed to determine whether they are supported by substantial competent\n       evidence. A de novo standard of review is then used to review the ultimate legal\n       conclusion regarding the suppression of evidence.\" State v. Garza, 295 Kan. 326, 330-31,\n       286 P.3d 554 (2012).\n\n\n       The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, along with Section 15\nof the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights protects individuals against unreasonable\n\n                                                  111\n\fgovernment searches and seizures. See State v. Daniel, 291 Kan. 490, 498, 242 P.3d 1186\n(2010) (Section 15 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights provides \"the same\nprotection from unlawful government searches and seizures as the Fourth Amendment to\nthe federal Constitution.\"), cert. denied 131 S. Ct. 2114 (2011). While not expressly\ncontained in the text of the amendment, the United States Supreme Court first recognized\na neutral and detached magistrate requirement in Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10,\n13-14, 68 S. Ct. 367, 92 L. Ed. 436 (1948) (\"The point of the Fourth Amendment, which\noften is not grasped by zealous officers, is not that it denies law enforcement the support\nof the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence. Its protection consists\nin requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead\nof being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out\ncrime.\"). Since Johnson, the neutral and detached magistrate requirement has evolved\ninto a firmly established cornerstone of Fourth Amendment law. State v. Fremont, 749\nN.W.2d 234, 237-38 (Iowa 2008).\n\n\n       Throughout the judicial refinement of the doctrine, the Supreme Court has\nrecognized at least two circumstances in which a magistrate fails to satisfy the neutral and\ndetached requirement. First, a magistrate involved in or who exercises law enforcement\npowers of the executive branch lacks neutrality and detachment. \"Whatever else\nneutrality and detachment might entail, it is clear that they require severance and\ndisengagement from activities of law enforcement.\" Shadwick v. City of Tampa, 407 U.S.\n345, 350, 92 S. Ct. 2119, 32 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1972). Second, a magistrate with a direct\npecuniary interest in the outcome of the warrant proceedings also lacks neutrality and\ndetachment. Connally v. Georgia, 429 U.S. 245, 250-51, 97 S. Ct. 546, 50 L. Ed. 2d 444\n(1977).\n\n\n       Connally expanded the scope of the neutral and detached magistrate requirement\nbeyond separation of powers principles and into the realm of judicial bias, i.e., direct\n                                            112\n\fpecuniary interests, by applying due process principles to the Fourth Amendment\nanalysis. Specifically, Connally adopted the due process test articulated in Tumey v. Ohio,\n273 U.S. 510, 47 S. Ct. 437, 71 L. Ed. 749 (1927), and Ward v. Village of Monroeville,\n409 U.S. 57, 93 S. Ct. 80, 34 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1972). 429 U.S. at 247-50. Thus a magistrate\nlacks neutrality and detachment where the circumstances offer \"'a possible temptation to\nthe average man [or woman] as a judge . . . or which might lead him [or her] not to hold\nthe balance nice, clear and true between the State and the accused.'\" 429 U.S. at 250. In\napplying this standard, we conduct an individualized and contextual inquiry in light of the\ntotality of the circumstances. See United States v. Bowling, 619 F.3d 1175, 1186 (10th\nCir. 2010).\n\n\n       Robinson argues the court should apply an \"appearance of bias\" standard,\nborrowed from recusal statutes and judicial codes of conduct. While judicial bias and\nrecusal precedent may inform the Fourth Amendment analysis, the appearance of bias\nstandard is inconsistent with the objective test employed by the Supreme Court. See\nUnited States v. Heffington, 952 F.2d 275, 279-80 (9th Cir. 1991) (urging caution in the\napplication of an appearance of partiality standard to Fourth Amendment neutral and\ndetached magistrate challenges); State v. McCann, 391 N.J. Super. 542, 554, 919 A.2d\n136 (2007) (mere appearance of bias alone is insufficient, objectively reasonable\npartiality must be established); O'Connor v. Madera County Superior Court, 76 Cal.\nRptr. 2d 138, 148 (1998) (appearance of partiality, \"without more, is not enough to render\n[magistrate] constitutionally disqualified to act or to implicate the exclusionary rule under\nthe Fourth Amendment\"), rev. denied and ordered not officially published 65 Cal. App.\n4th 113 (October 14, 1998). It is also inconsistent with the standard we have applied to\ndue process challenges founded on allegations of judicial bias. See State v. Hurd, 298\nKan. 555, 570, 316 P.3d 696 (2013) (\"Recusal is required under the Fourteenth\nAmendment's Due Process Clause when the judge is actually biased or there is a\n\n\n                                            113\n\fconstitutionally intolerable probability of actual bias. [Citation omitted.]\"); State v.\nSawyer, 297 Kan. 902, 909-10, 305 P.3d 608 (2013) (same).\n\n\n       2. Did Judge McClain lack neutrality and detachment?\n\n       In ruling on Robinson's challenge, the district judge found:\n\n\n               \"In this case, McClain investigated Robinson and filed criminal charges against\n       him for theft on March 29, 1985 in what was referred to at the hearing as the Back Care\n       case (Case No. K48573). As Chief Deputy to the District Attorney at the time, McClain\n       assigned himself the case and handled the matter through the preliminary hearing. Shortly\n       after the preliminary hearing, on June 10, 1985, McClain was appointed to the bench.\n       Another prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Steve Obermeier, took over the case and\n       tried it in Judge McClain's stead. Judge McClain was later called as a witness in the Back\n       Care case to testify as to the delivery of certain affidavits to him from Ron Wood and at\n       the behest of Robinson. A review of the transcripts of those earlier proceedings indicates\n       that McClain was nothing more than a foundation witness to show the chain of custody\n       for the documents in question. McClain testified as to the delivery of the documents only.\n       It was Obermeier that obtained that conviction, handled the sentencing of defendant,\n       opposed defendant's parole, and later filed the charges against Robinson in the Kuti case\n       (Case No. K51711). The parties have stipulated that Judge McClain 'had no knowledge\n       whatsoever concerning the defendant's suspected involvement in any homicides or\n       abductions' and that 'since assuming the bench in June of 1985, Judge McClain has\n       handled a civil docket exclusively and has disengaged from any law enforcement related\n       activities, other than presiding over various applications for search warrants, wiretaps,\n       and pen registers.'\"\n\n\n       The district judge's factual findings are supported by substantial competent\nevidence, and Robinson does not challenge them on appeal. Thus our analysis focuses on\nJudge Anderson's legal conclusion that Judge McClain was neutral and detached.\n\n\n                                                   114\n\f       We have not previously addressed a neutral and detached magistrate challenge\nunder these particular facts. But see generally State v. Schoonover, 281 Kan. 453, 517,\n133 P.3d 48 (2006) (\"'The requirement that a warrant must be issued by a neutral and\ndetached magistrate does not equate to a constitutional mandate requiring that a judge\nhave no contact with or knowledge of the case or the defendant.'\") Nor has the Supreme\nCourt decided whether a magistrate's former prosecution of a defendant violates the\nneutral and detached magistrate requirement. As such, we turn to other persuasive\nauthority for guidance.\n\n\n       The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals issued the seminal decision on \"magistrate-as-\nformer-prosecutor\" challenges in United States v. Outler, 659 F.2d 1306 (5th Cir. 1981).\nIn Outler, the magistrate, who had prosecuted defendant for prescribing scheduled drugs\nwithout a license 3 years prior, issued a warrant in his capacity as a judicial officer to\nsearch defendant's medical office in a later investigation of defendant's practice. The\nsearch warrant was \"based on information gathered exclusively during the second\ninvestigation.\" 659 F.2d at 1312. The Fifth Circuit found no Fourth Amendment\nviolation, reasoning the search warrant contained sufficient evidence to indicate probable\ncause and the details therein were independent of the events involved in the magistrate's\nformer prosecution of the defendant. 659 F.2d at 1312.\n\n\n       The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a similar challenge in United States\nv. DeLuna, 763 F.2d 897 (8th Cir. 1985), where jointly charged codefendants argued the\nissuing magistrate's former prosecution of certain defendants violated the neutral and\ndetached magistrate requirement. The Eighth Circuit rejected the challenge because the\nevidence failed to demonstrate that the current investigation was related to the matter\nhandled previously by the magistrate or that the magistrate was still employed as a\nprosecutor at the time the current investigation began. 763 F.2d at 908.\n\n\n                                             115\n\f       More recently, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reached the same holding in\nUnited States v. Freerksen, 457 Fed. Appx. 769 (10th Cir.) (unpublished opinion), cert.\ndenied 132 S. Ct. 2788 (2012). There, defendant was convicted of five counts of\nproducing child pornography after law enforcement executed a search warrant\nuncovering digital images depicting the sexual abuse of an 11-year-old child. The search\nwarrants were issued by Special District Judge Don Work. Prior to his appointment to the\nbench, Judge Work was an assistant district attorney. In that capacity, he prosecuted\ndefendant for assault and battery in 2007 and for lewd molestation in 2008. Work had\nalso sought to accelerate a deferred sentence defendant received in a 2005 case for child\nstealing. The Tenth Circuit held that Judge Work's former prosecution of defendant on\ncases involving sex crimes and abuse of children, which were unrelated to the incident\ngiving rise to the pending child pornography investigation, failed to demonstrate a\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment's neutral and detached magistrate requirement. 457\nFed. Appx. at 772; see United States v. Waters, 786 F. Supp. 1111, 1117 (N.D.N.Y.\n1992) (\"Absent concrete evidence that [the magistrate judge] was involved in his prior\ncapacity as Assistant United States Attorney in an investigation of defendant as an open\ncriminal file to which he was assigned, there is no basis upon which to invalidate the . . .\nsearch warrant. [Citation omitted.]\"; cf. United States v. Harris, 566 F.3d 422, 434 (5th\nCir. 2009) (finding \"no reason to question the neutrality and detachment of a magistrate\nwho happened to have represented the defendant in an unrelated criminal matter 6 years\nprior\"); Heffington, 952 F.2d at 279-80 (magistrate's prior representation of defendant in\nprevious drug case was not the same matter at issue when warrants issued); Bowling, 619\nF.3d at 1186 (magistrate who represented bank in adversarial proceedings against\ndefendant 10 years before the warrant application did not violate neutral and detached\nrequirement).\n\n\n       Robinson suggests these decisions stand for the proposition that a magistrate lacks\nneutrality and detachment where any facts between the former prosecution and current\n                                             116\n\finvestigation overlap. He then argues Detective Brown's supporting affidavits disclosed\nthree overlapping or common facts between the Back Care case and the capital murder\ninvestigation, including reference to Robinson's conviction in the Back Care case, his\npossible involvement in the disappearance of Paula Godfrey, and businesses tied to\nRobinson that used a name similar to Equi-plus.\n\n\n       However, a careful review of Outler, DeLuna, and other \"magistrate-as-former-\nprosecutor\" cases reveals the pivotal question is not whether there are any facts common\nbetween the two cases, but instead whether they arose from a common investigation or\nsingle transaction or event. Outler, 659 F.2d at 1312 (affidavit established probable cause\nand significant facts in affidavit, such as agents, dates, and drugs in question, were\nwholly independent of the events at issue in the prior prosecution); cf. Del Vecchio v.\nIllinois Dept. of Corrections, 31 F.3d 1363, 1375 (7th Cir. 1994) (en banc) (recusal not\nrequired in a murder trial where judge had prosecuted defendant 14 years earlier on a\ndifferent murder charge); In re K.E.M., 89 S.W.3d 814, 826 (Tex. App. 2002) (judge is\nnot disqualified by mere fact that he personally prosecuted defendant for past crimes).\n\n\n       The judge's former prosecution of Robinson and the current capital murder\ninvestigation most certainly did not arise from a common investigation or single\ntransaction or event. Then-prosecutor McClain investigated and prosecuted Robinson on\na theft by deception charge related to his fraudulent invoicing practices that defrauded the\nowners of Back Care. In stark contrast, this case involved the investigation and\nprosecution of Robinson 15 years later for kidnapping, sexual battery, and the murders of\nsix female victims.\n\n\n       Robinson does not dispute that the averments in the supporting affidavits\nestablished probable cause for issuance of the pen registers, wiretap orders, and search\nwarrants; and none of the allegedly overlapping facts in the affidavits were material to\n                                             117\n\fJudge McClain's probable cause determinations. The most significant overlapping fact\nwas the affidavits' brief reference to Robinson's convictions in the Back Care and Kuti\ncases. Detective Brown testified that he referenced these cases to bolster other averments\ndescribing Robinson's attempts to conceal his crimes by fabricating letters on behalf of\nthe victims. The element of fraudulent concealment may have been common to both the\nBack Care case and the capital murder investigation, but, as Judge Anderson found, the\nfact that a perpetrator took steps to cover up the crimes is a fact common to most all\ncriminal cases.\n\n\n       Amongst the dozens of averments in the affidavits, the isolated reference to the\nBack Care case bore little weight in the overall assessment of probable cause. The other\nallegedly overlapping facts are even more benign. It is unclear how Godfrey's signature\non a sham affidavit in a financial crimes prosecution would adversely influence Judge\nMcClain's probable cause assessment in this capital murder investigation. The same holds\ntrue for the fleeting references to Robinson's companies using the Equi title.\n\n\n       Robinson relies on Sincavage v. Superior Court, 42 Cal. App. 4th 224, 49 Cal.\nRptr. 2d 615 (1996), and Goines v. State, 708 So. 2d 656 (Fla. Dist. App. 1998), in\nsupport of his challenge. Both cases involved a judge who formerly prosecuted and\nsecured convictions against the defendant, and these convictions were or could have been\nrelevant to the enhancements sought at a current sentencing. In this regard, the judge's\nformer prosecution and the enhancements sought at sentencing arose from the same acts\nor transactions. Thus the authority is distinguishable.\n\n\n       To the extent facts or circumstances were common to both cases here, they were\nnot sufficient to cause a reasonable person to question Judge McClain's ability to fairly\nassess the probable cause issue in the various applications for pen registers, wiretap\norders, and search warrants. See Schoonover, 281 Kan. at 517; see also DeLuna, 763 F.2d\n                                             118\n\fat 908 (magistrate's knowledge from prior investigation of defendant would not cause a\nreasonable person to believe he was unable to impartially assess the existence of probable\ncause); People v. Curkendall, 12 A.D.3d 710, 714, 783 N.Y.S.2d 707 (no merit in claim\nthat judge's former prosecution of defendant 14 years earlier on similar offense violated\ndue process), leave to appeal denied 4 N.Y.3d 743 (2004).\n\n\n       In addition to Judge McClain's former prosecution of defendant in the Back Care\ncase, Robinson contends that the magistrate's stray comments evidenced his lack of\nneutrality and detachment. Specifically, Robinson highlights McClain's comment that\nRobinson was a \"master of the copying machine\" and that he knew defendant as a \"con\nman or shyster.\"\n\n\n       The first comment was made to Robinson's defense counsel in the Back Care case\nmore than 15 years before Judge McClain issued the pen registers, wiretap orders, and\nsearch warrants in this case and before he was appointed to the bench. The comment was\nalso reasonably grounded in fact, as Robinson had provided fraudulent affidavits in hopes\nof avoiding prosecution. The comment does not evidence a lack of neutrality and\ndetachment.\n\n\n       The \"con man or shyster\" comment is more troubling when viewed in isolation.\nHowever, Judge McClain made this comment while disclosing his previous investigation\nand prosecution of Robinson in a financial crimes case. Viewed in context, Judge\nMcClain's comment appears to be an inartful description of the nature of the crimes he\nprosecuted rather than a pejorative statement regarding Robinson's character.\n\n\n       The parties stipulated that Judge McClain had completely disengaged from law\nenforcement upon taking the bench in 1985, had had no involvement in any subsequent\ninvestigation or prosecution of Robinson, and had no knowledge of Robinson's possible\n                                           119\n\finvolvement in other missing persons' investigations. Nothing in the record suggests\nJudge McClain considered any information outside the four corners of the applications\nand supporting affidavits, in this case, which provided ample independent support for his\nprobable cause determinations. The comments highlighted by Robinson fail to establish a\nviolation of the neutral and detached magistrate requirement. See Hurd, 298 Kan. at 571\n(trial judge comments that defendant was \"'a violent man,'\" the \"'best place for [him] is in\nprison,'\" and that he showed a \"'complete inability to . . . follow the rules'\" did not\nestablish due process violation when made in reference to his extensive criminal history);\nSchoonover, 281 Kan. at 516-17 (magistrate who formerly represented defendant and\ncalled him a \"low life\" was neutral and detached where he did not rely on information\noutside the affidavit, which clearly established probable cause); State v. Griffen, 241 Kan.\n68, 71-72, 734 P.2d 1089 (1987) (district judge referring to defendant as a \"'mean\nmother,'\" when explaining the case background to new defense counsel, while ill-advised,\ndid not demonstrate bias and prejudice).\n\n\n       Robinson, relying on State v. Alderson, 260 Kan. 445, 468-69, 922 P.2d 435\n(1996), argues Judge McClain's comments should be construed as evidence of bias\nbecause the judge was the victim of Robinson's fraud, i.e., he received Robinson's sham\naffidavits in the mid-1980s. In Alderson, we held that a reasonable person would question\nthe trial judge's impartiality where defendant was prosecuted for stealing a car owned by\nthe trial judge's brother. 260 Kan. at 469. Unlike the situation in Alderson, neither Judge\nMcClain nor any member of his family suffered injury or financial loss from Robinson's\nsham affidavits. Robinson delivered the affidavits in hopes of avoiding prosecution, not\nto defraud Judge McClain financially. Robinson's efforts proved unsuccessful and did not\nimpede then-prosecutor McClain's filing of criminal charges. In fact, the sham affidavits\nbolstered the State's case in the Back Care prosecution. Robinson's reliance on Alderson\nis misplaced.\n\n\n                                             120\n\f       Based on the foregoing analysis, we agree with Judge Anderson's legal conclusion\nthat Judge McClain was a neutral and detached magistrate.\n\n\nJurisdiction to Issue Extraterritorial Search Warrant\n\n       In his second suppression issue, Robinson claims Judge McClain exceeded his\nterritorial jurisdiction, as defined by Kansas statutes, by issuing the warrant to search\nRobinson's property in Linn County, rendering the warrant void ab initio.\n\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n       As set forth above, in considering the denial of a motion to suppress, we review\nfactual findings for substantial competent evidence and legal conclusions de novo. State\nv. Schultz, 289 Kan. 334, 340, 212 P.3d 150 (2009). Defendant's challenge also requires\nthe court to interpret various statutes defining the powers of district judges. \"The\ninterpretation of statutes is a question of law over which an appellate court exercises\nunlimited review.\" State v. Arnett, 290 Kan. 41, Syl. ¶ 1, 223 P.3d 780 (2010).\n\n\n       2. Can district judges issue extraterritorial search warrants?\n\n       Resolution of this challenge requires the court to analyze competing statutory\ninterpretations regarding a district judge's authority to issue extraterritorial search\nwarrants. To do so, we first outline the relevant constitutional and statutory framework.\n\n\n       The Kansas Constitution created the district courts of Kansas and provided that\nthey \"shall have such jurisdiction in their respective districts as may be provided by law.\"\nKan. Const. art. 3, § 6(a) and (b). The legislature, in turn, has provided that district judges\n\"provided for in the Kansas constitution shall have and exercise the full judicial power\nand authority of a district court.\" K.S.A. 20-302. The legislature later created two classes\n                                              121\n\fof \"judges of the district courts\"—district magistrate judges and district judges. K.S.A.\n20-301a. A \"'judge of the district court' means any of such judges.\" K.S.A. 20-301a.\n\n\n       The legislature has defined the general powers and authority of \"judges of the\ndistrict court\" at K.S.A. 20-301a:\n\n\n       \"Such judges shall have the jurisdiction, powers and duties prescribed by this act and\n       otherwise prescribed by law. The judicial power and authority of a judge of the district\n       court in each judicial district may be exercised anywhere within such judicial district and\n       may be exercised anywhere within any other judicial district when assigned to hear any\n       proceeding or try any cause in such judicial district, as provided in K.S.A. 20-319 and\n       amendments thereto.\"\n\n\n       These provisions serve as a general limitation on judges of the district court,\nrequiring that they exercise powers from within the territorial boundaries of their judicial\ndistricts. Verdigris Conservancy District v. Objectors, 131 Kan. 214, 218, 289 P. 966\n(1930) (\"judicial business is to be done in judicial districts, by district courts and district\njudges acting within and for their respective districts\").\n\n\n       Beyond these general grants of authority, the legislature has specifically defined a\njudicial officer's authority to issue search warrants. The legislature has provided that\nsearch warrants shall be issued by a \"magistrate.\" K.S.A. 22-2502(a). A \"'magistrate'\"\nincludes \"judges of district courts,\" which includes both district magistrate judges and\ndistrict judges. K.S.A. 22-2202(14); K.S.A. 20-301a. However, the legislature has placed\nterritorial limits on the execution of search warrants issued by a district magistrate judge.\n\n\n               \"Search warrants issued by a district magistrate judge may be executed only\n       within the judicial district in which said judge resides or within the judicial district to\n       which said judge has been assigned pursuant to K.S.A. 20-319.\" K.S.A. 22-2503.\n\n                                                    122\n\fImportantly, the legislature placed no such territorial limitation on search warrants issued\nby district judges. See K.S.A. 22-2502 and 22-2503.\n\n\n       Judge McClain was a district judge in Johnson County, the lone county in the\nTenth Judicial District. He issued a warrant from within the territorial boundaries of the\nTenth Judicial District to search Robinson's Linn County property, located in the Sixth\nJudicial District. In his motion to suppress and on appeal, Robinson argues K.S.A. 20-\n301a, which permits a \"judge of the district court\" to exercise judicial powers anywhere\nwithin the territorial boundaries of the judicial district, prevented Judge McClain from\nissuing the extraterritorial search warrant. Judge Anderson denied defendant's motion to\nsuppress, finding the legislature intended to grant district judges authority to issue search\nwarrants executable statewide under K.S.A. 22-2503 by placing territorial limits on\nsearch warrants issued by district magistrate judges only.\n\n\n       The resolution of these competing statutory interpretations lies within the history\nof the pertinent statutes. We begin with the search warrant statutes, which predate the\nlegislature's enactment of K.S.A. 20-301a. K.S.A. 22-2502 and 22-2503 authorize judges\nof the district court to issue search warrants, but K.S.A. 22-2503 places territorial limits\non the execution of warrants issued by district magistrate judges. This was not always the\ncase. K.S.A. 62-1830 (Corrick), the predecessor to K.S.A. 22-2502 and 22-2503,\nformerly provided:\n\n\n               \"'A warrant shall issue upon affidavit or upon oral testimony given under oath\n       and recorded before the magistrate or judge. If the magistrate or judge is satisfied that\n       there is probable cause for the issuance of a warrant, he shall issue such warrant\n       describing the property to be searched for and seized and naming or describing the\n       person, place or means of conveyance to be searched. The warrant shall be directed to\n       any peace officer of the state of Kansas, or one of its governmental subdivisions who is\n                                                   123\n\f       authorized to enforce or assist in enforcing any law thereof. It shall state the grounds for\n       its issuance, and shall command the officer to search the person, place, thing, or means of\n       conveyance named for the property specified, and to seize such property and hold the\n       same in accordance with the law.'\" (Emphasis added.) State v. Lamb, 209 Kan. 453, 468-\n       69, 497 P.2d 275 (1972) (quoting K.S.A. 62-1830), overruled on other grounds by State\n       v. Jacques, 225 Kan. 38, 587 P.2d 861 (1978).\n\n\n       In Lamb, the defendant challenged a Johnson County magistrate's jurisdiction to\nissue an extraterritorial search warrant. Rejecting the challenge, Lamb held that K.S.A.\n62-1830 granted both magistrates and judges the authority to issue search warrants\nexecutable statewide. Lamb reasoned that by directing a magistrate or judge to deliver the\nwarrant to any peace officer of the state of Kansas, the statute implied that \"a search\nwarrant issued by a magistrate within the confines of his [or her] jurisdiction, can be\nserved anywhere within the state of Kansas.\" 209 Kan. at 469.\n\n\n       In 1970, the legislature repealed K.S.A. 62-1830 and enacted K.S.A. 22-2503 as\npart of the codification of the Kansas Criminal Code. L. 1970, ch. 129, sec. 22-2503.\nUnlike former K.S.A. 62-1830, K.S.A. 22-2503 expressly provided that \"[s]earch\nwarrants issued by courts of limited jurisdiction may be executed only within the\nterritorial limits of the county in which the court is located.\" L. 1970, ch. 129, sec. 22-\n2503. As discussed below, this statute was later amended to specifically apply the\nterritorial restriction to district magistrate judges only.\n\n\n       However, the legislature did not wholly abandon the language in K.S.A. 62-1830\nfrom which Lamb inferred the authority to issue extraterritorial warrants, i.e., that\nwarrants be \"directed to any peace officer of the state of Kansas.\" Instead, it incorporated\nsubstantially similar language into new section 2505, providing that \"[a] search warrant\nshall be issued in duplicate and shall be directed for execution to all law enforcement\n\n\n                                                   124\n\fofficers of the state, or to any law enforcement officer specifically named therein.\"\n(Emphasis added.) L. 1970, ch. 129, sec. 22-2505.\n\n\n       Through these 1970 amendments, the legislature eliminated the authority of courts\nof limited jurisdiction to issue extraterritorial search warrants; it imposed no similar\nlimitation on district judges; and it retained in K.S.A. 22-2505, the language from which\nLamb inferred the authority of judges to issue extraterritorial warrants. Viewed together,\nthese amendments provide persuasive support for the view that the legislature intended to\ngrant district judges authority to issue search warrants executable statewide.\n\n\n       The 1970 amendments alone do not explain the legislature's subsequent enactment\nof K.S.A. 20-301a in 1976. But, the legislative history surrounding this enactment\nsuggests strongly that it was never intended to restrict district judges' authority to issue\nextraterritorial search warrants.\n\n\n       On April 14, 1976, the legislature approved House Bill 2729, resulting in the\nenactment of K.S.A. 20-301a. L. 1976, ch. 146, sec. 10. In this bill, the legislature\ndefined \"judges of the district court\" to include district judges and district magistrate\njudges and granted them authority to exercise their powers from anywhere within their\njudicial districts.\n\n\n       Eight days later, on April 22, 1976, the legislature passed House Bill 3186,\namending K.S.A. 22-2503 as follows:\n\n\n               \"Search warrants issued by courts of limited jurisdiction a district magistrate\n       judge may be executed only within the territorial limits of the county in which the court is\n       located said judge resides.\" L. 1976, ch. 163, sec. 3.\n\n\n\n                                                   125\n\f       The legislature's 1976 amendment to K.S.A. 22-2503 was a response to its earlier\napproval of K.S.A. 20-301a, which created district magistrate judges as one of two\nclasses of judges of the district court. The amendment to K.S.A. 22-2503 reflected this\nnew classification by substituting \"a district magistrate judge\" in place of \"courts of\nlimited jurisdiction.\" Had the legislature intended K.S.A. 20-301a to limit a district\njudge's authority to issue extraterritorial search warrants, it would have included all\nclasses of \"judges of the district court\" in its amendment of K.S.A. 22-2503 or repealed\nthis section altogether. Instead, it chose to place the territorial limitation on the execution\nof search warrants issued by \"a district magistrate judge\" only.\n\n\n       Three years later, the legislature adopted House Bill 2046, which amended K.S.A.\n22-2503 to clarify that search warrants issued by a district magistrate judge were\nexecutable within the \"judicial district\" rather than the \"territorial limits of the county\" in\nwhich the judge resides. L. 1979, ch. 96, sec. 1. Once again, such an amendment would\nhave been wholly unnecessary had the legislature intended K.S.A. 20-301a to limit the\nauthority of judges of the district courts to issue extraterritorial search warrants\naltogether.\n\n\n       Robinson's construction of K.S.A. 20-301a as a limitation on district judges'\nauthority to issue extraterritorial warrants would render the legislature's 1976 adoption of\nHouse Bill 3186 and 1979 adoption of House Bill 2046 meaningless. In fact, it would\nrender the entirety of K.S.A. 22-2503 altogether superfluous. See State v. LaGrange, 294\nKan. 623, Syl. ¶ 1, 279 P.3d 105 (2012) (courts shall \"presume that the legislature does\nnot intend to enact useless, superfluous, or meaningless legislation\").\n\n\n       The defendant's construction of K.S.A. 20-301a also fails to give meaning to other\nprovisions within Article 25 of the Kansas Code of Criminal Procedure. For example, the\n                                              126\n\fstatute authorizing installation or use of pen registers or trap and trace devices expressly\nlimits a judge's ability to issue extraterritorial orders authorizing the use of such\nmonitoring devices. K.S.A. 22-2527(1). The legislature enacted this statute in 1988,\nsubsequent to the 1976 enactment of K.S.A. 20-301a. L. 1988, ch. 117, sec. 8. Likewise,\nthe wiretap statute limits a judge's ability to issue extraterritorial orders authorizing\nelectronic interception of communications. K.S.A. 22-2516(3). Once again, had the\nlegislature intended K.S.A. 20-301a to serve as a general limitation on a district judge's\njurisdiction to issue orders and warrants to be executed outside the judge's home district,\nthen the express provisions doing so under the pen register and wiretap statutes would\nhave been unnecessary.\n\n\n       When K.S.A. 22-2503 and 22-2505 are read together and considered against the\nhistory and developments subsequent to the 1970 codification, it is evident the legislature\nintended for district judges to retain their pre-code authority to issue search warrants\nexecutable statewide, while simultaneously revoking district magistrate judges' pre-\ncodification authority to do so. See State v. Van Hoet, 277 Kan. 815, Syl. ¶ 2, 89 P.3d\n606 (2004) (\"Where the face of the statute leaves its construction uncertain, the court may\nlook to the historical background of the enactment, the circumstances attending its\npassage, the purpose to be accomplished, and the effect the statute may have under the\nvarious constructions suggested.\").\n\n\n       The Court of Appeals panel in State v. Englund, 50 Kan. App. 2d 123, 135, 329\nP.3d 502 (2014), reached the same conclusion:\n\n\n       \"When we consider K.S.A. 22-2503 and K.S.A. 22-2505 together, two statutes enacted at\n       the same time K.S.A. 62-1830 (Corrick 1964) was repealed, the legislature's intent is\n       clear: district magistrates may no longer issue search warrants outside their home\n       judicial district, but district judges can.\"\n\n\n                                                      127\n\fSee also State v. Adams, 2 Kan. App. 2d 135, 138, 576 P.2d 242 (unlike electronic\neavesdropping statute, nothing in the search and seizure statutes limits power of district\njudges to issue warrants within territorial jurisdiction), rev. denied 225 Kan. 845 (1978).\n\n\n       The United States District Court for the District of Kansas also has embraced this\nconstruction of the search warrant statutes. See United States v. Aikman, No. 09-10097-\n01-JTM, 2010 WL 420063, at *6 (D. Kan. 2010) (unpublished opinion) (no territorial\nlimit on search warrant issued by district judge under K.S.A. 22-2503); Lord v. City of\nLeavenworth, No. 08-2171-JWL, 2009 WL 129367, at *4 (D. Kan. 2009) (unpublished\nopinion) (in 42 U.S.C. § 1983 constitutional tort claim, finding that district judge\nproperly issued extraterritorial warrant under K.S.A. 22-2503; limitation on territorial\njurisdiction applies to district magistrate judges only).\n\n\n       This construction provides meaning to K.S.A. 22-2503 and 22-2505, as well as\nK.S.A. 20-301a. K.S.A. 20-301a requires judges of the district court to exercise their\npowers within the territorial boundaries of their judicial districts. Applied here, K.S.A.\n20-301a required Judge McClain to issue the search warrant from a location within\nJohnson County. More generally, K.S.A. 20-301a continues to prevent judges of the\ndistrict courts from trying cases or conducting judicial proceedings outside the\nboundaries of their judicial districts, absent proper assignment under K.S.A. 20-319.\n\n\n       Robinson argues K.S.A. 20-301a, as the more recent legislative act, controls over\nLamb and K.S.A. 22-2503 and 22-2505. See Farmers State Bank & Trust Co. of Hays v.\nCity of Yates Center, 229 Kan. 330, 338, 624 P.2d 971 (1981) (\"Where there is a conflict\nbetween the provisions of two or more statutory sections, the latest legislative expression\ncontrols.\"). However, as discussed above, 1 week after the legislature approved the bill\nresulting in the enactment of K.S.A. 20-301a, it adopted amendments to K.S.A. 22-2503,\n                                             128\n\fclarifying that only district magistrate judges are precluded from issuing extraterritorial\nwarrants. Defendant's argument fails to account for this sensible pattern of legislative\naction.\n\n\n          Furthermore, as explained in Englund, \"here we have a conflict between a general\nprinciple of law (K.S.A. 20-301a) and a more specific enactment dealing not with the\noverall jurisdiction of judges, but their specific jurisdiction in issuing search warrants\n(K.S.A. 22-2505). In this situation, the more specific statute controls.\" 50 Kan. App. 2d at\n135. Also, because K.S.A. 22-2503 and 22-2505 were enacted together, address the same\nsubject, and are contained in Article 25, Search and Seizure, of the Kansas Code of\nCriminal Procedure, they are in pari materia and must be construed together and brought\ninto harmony. See In re Tax Appeal of LaFarge Midwest, 293 Kan. 1039, 1045, 271 P.3d\n732 (2012) (\"when construing statutes to determine legislative intent, appellate courts\nmust consider various provisions of an act in pari materia with a view of reconciling and\nbringing the provisions into workable harmony if possible\").\n\n\n          Robinson also points to the arrest warrant and subpoena statutes, which expressly\ngrant district judges authority to issue extraterritorial warrants and orders, as support for\nhis construction. See K.S.A. 22-2305(2); K.S.A. 22-3214. Defendant suggests this\nlanguage would be unnecessary if district judges had authority to act beyond the\nterritorial limits set out by K.S.A. 20-301a. However, Robinson's argument fails to\naccount for the fact that the legislature enacted the arrest warrant and subpoena statutes in\n1970, prior to the 1976 enactment of K.S.A. 20-301a. The argument also begs the\nquestion whether the legislature intended to grant district judges the same extraterritorial\nauthority for search warrants when it repealed K.S.A. 62-1830 and enacted K.S.A. 22-\n2502, 22-2503, and 22-2505.\n\n\n\n\n                                              129\n\f       Robinson also cites State v. Sodders, 255 Kan. 79, 872 P.2d 736 (1994), as support\nfor his construction. There, defendant argued city police officers exceeded their authority\nby executing a search warrant beyond their territorial boundaries defined in K.S.A. 22-\n2401a. The State argued K.S.A. 22-2505 gave law enforcement officers power to execute\nwarrants outside their jurisdiction, creating an exception to a law enforcement officer's\nterritorial limitation under K.S.A. 22-2401a. We held that K.S.A. 22-2505 was a general\nstatute providing that search warrants shall be executed by law enforcement officers and\nhad nothing to do with their territorial jurisdiction. 255 Kan. at 84. Based on this\nrationale, Robinson argues that the territorial limits on district judges in K.S.A. 22-301a,\nlike the territorial limits on law enforcement officers in K.S.A. 22-2401a, prohibit\nextraterritorial search warrants, and just as K.S.A. 22-2505 has nothing to do with the\nterritorial jurisdiction of officers, it likewise has nothing to do with the territorial\njurisdiction of district judges.\n\n\n       However, Sodders examined the statutory scheme governing law enforcement\nofficers' territorial jurisdiction, not judges of the district courts. Furthermore, contrary to\nRobinson's assertion, Lamb held that language substantially similar to K.S.A. 22-2505\nwas relevant to defining a judge's authority to issue extraterritorial warrants. 209 Kan. at\n469. In fact, in his dissenting opinion in Sodders, Justice Lockett agreed with our\nconstruction of K.S.A. 22-2503 in dicta, acknowledging the territorial limitation on\nextraterritorial search warrants applied to district magistrate judges only. 255 Kan. at 87\n(Lockett, J., dissenting). Sodders is inapposite.\n\n\n       We likewise agree with the construction adopted by the panel of the Court of\nAppeals in Englund, which is more consistent with the legislative background and history\nand better harmonizes the relevant statutory scheme.See State v. Arnett, 290 Kan. 41, 47,\n223 P.3d 780 (2010); Van Hoet, 277 Kan. 815, Syl. ¶ 2. Accordingly, we find no error in\nJudge Anderson's denial of defendant's motion to suppress on these grounds.\n                                               130\n\fExercise of Law Enforcement Powers beyond Territorial Jurisdiction\n\n       Robinson next argues law enforcement officers exercised police powers beyond\ntheir territorial jurisdiction, in violation of K.S.A. 22-2401a, and Judge Anderson erred in\nrefusing to suppress evidence derived from such activity. In particular, defendant\ncontends Lenexa and/or Overland Park police exceeded their territorial jurisdiction by:\n(1) conducting warrantless trash searches at his Olathe residence; (2) executing the\nwarrant to search his Linn County property; and (3) executing warrants to search his\nOlathe residence and storage units.\n\n\n       As set forth in the previous section, we review Judge Anderson's factual findings\nfor substantial competent evidence and his legal conclusions de novo.\n\n\n       1. Did the trash searches violate K.S.A. 22-2401a?\n\n       On numerous occasions, members of the Lenexa Police Department (LPD)\ntraveled beyond the Lenexa city limits to conduct warrantless searches and seizures of\ntrash left for collection outside Robinson's Olathe residence. Because LPD conducted this\ninvestigative work beyond its territorial jurisdiction, Robinson believes evidence derived\nfrom the trash pulls should have been suppressed.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-2401a provides, in relevant part:\n\n\n               \"(2) Law enforcement officers employed by any city may exercise their powers\n       as law enforcement officers:\n               (a) Anywhere within the city limits of the city employing them and outside of\n       such city when on property owned or under the control of such city. \"\n\n\n\n                                                 131\n\fThe statute includes several exceptions, none of which are applicable to law\nenforcement's trash pulls. A \"law enforcement officer\" is \"any person who by virtue of\noffice or public employment is vested by law with a duty to maintain public order or to\nmake arrests for violation of the laws of the state of Kansas or ordinances of any\nmunicipality . . . .\" See K.S.A. 22-2202(13); K.S.A. 22-2401a(10)(a).\n\n\n       There is no dispute that LPD officers conducted trash searches beyond their\nterritorial jurisdiction. The question is whether they were exercising their powers as law\nenforcement officers in doing so. Judge Anderson found LPD officers were not acting\nunder the color of office and this activity fell beyond the scope of K.S.A. 22-2401a. We\ndisagree.\n\n\n       LPD officers were not acting as private citizens when they conducted the trash\npulls. They contacted the private trash hauler's security officer to obtain the company's\ncooperation and assistance. They commandeered the company's trash truck to collect\ndefendant's trash and/or made arrangements for the private hauler to segregate\ndefendant's trash and meet LPD officers at an agreed location to deliver it. The powers of\na law enforcement officer include those \"necessary to permit the city officer to meet his\nor her common-law duty to the public to preserve the peace.\" State v. Vrabel, 301 Kan.\n797, 803-04, 347 P.3d 201 (2015). Here, LPD officers utilized their status as law\nenforcement officers to facilitate the cooperation and assistance of the private trash\nhauler, and they did so in furtherance of their duty to preserve the peace by building a\ncase against Robinson—a person they believed was involved in multiple murders and\nposed a continuing threat to the community. Cf. Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 803-05 (officers'\norganized and planned controlled drug buy with confidential informant to build case\nagainst defendant in furtherance of duty to preserve the peace fell within scope of K.S.A.\n22-2401a).\n\n\n                                            132\n\f       We understand that, in most instances, private citizens may freely search garbage\nleft on or at the side of a public street. California v. Greenwood, 486 U.S. 35, 40, 108 S.\nCt. 1625, 100 L. Ed. 2d 30 (1988) (\"It is common knowledge that plastic garbage bags\nleft on or at the side of a public street are readily accessible to animals, children,\nscavengers, snoops, and other members of the public.\"). However, we doubt seriously\nthey could wield sufficient influence to secure the cooperation and assistance of a private\ntrash contractor in such endeavors for weeks on end. See State v. Martin, No. 102,639,\n2010 WL 1253752, at *7 (Kan. App. 2010) (unpublished opinion) (private citizen's trash\npulls carried out with prior knowledge and acquiescence of law enforcement to further\ninvestigative efforts could not be deemed private action); Rodgers v. Waste Industries,\nInc., No. 4:12-CV-294-FL, 2013 WL 4460265, at *5 (E.D.N.C. 2013) (where plaintiff\nalleged private trash hauler removed trash at behest of law enforcement, complaint\nsufficiently alleged action under color of law sufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. §\n1983), aff'd 553 Fed. Appx. 332 (4th Cir. 2014) (unpublished opinion).\n\n\n       Based on LPD officers' planning and coordination with the private trash\ncontractor, along with their collaborative efforts to successfully complete these trash pulls\nover the course of several weeks, we conclude LPD officers were not acting exclusively\nas private citizens but, instead, exercised \"powers as law enforcement officers\" under\nthese particular facts. See K.S.A. 22-2401a.\n\n\n       Acknowledging a violation of K.S.A. 22-2401a, the question turns to the\nappropriate remedy, if any. In Sodders, 255 Kan. at 84, despite the absence of any federal\nor state constitutional violation, the court affirmed the suppression of evidence where\nOverland Park police officers exceeded their territorial jurisdiction by executing a search\nwarrant within the municipal boundaries of Lenexa.\n\n\n\n\n                                              133\n\f       However, the Sodders majority did not specifically analyze or address the\nremedies available under K.S.A. 22-2401a. More recently, in Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 808-14,\nwe explored what, if any, remedy was available to defendant under K.S.A. 22-2401a.\nThere, city law enforcement officers violated the statute by organizing and carrying out a\ncontrolled drug buy outside their municipal boundaries. Neither the exclusionary rule,\napplicable to unconstitutional searches or seizures, nor the statutory provision for\nsuppressing illegally seized evidence, K.S.A. 22-3216, applied because officers did not\nconduct an illegal search or seizure. Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 810-11. Therefore we considered\nwhether suppression was an individual remedy available under K.S.A. 22-2401a. 301\nKan. at 811-14. Distinguishing Sodders based on the absence of any search or seizure, we\nheld that suppression is generally not required where city officers exercise police\npowers—\"other than search and seizure\"—outside their municipal jurisdiction. Vrabel,\n301 Kan. at 813-14.\n\n\n       Unlike Vrabel, LPD officers' conduct did involve searches and seizures carried out\nin violation of K.S.A. 22-2401a. Yet defendant's challenge is based on a violation of state\nstatute, not the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or § 15 of the\nKansas Constitution Bill of Rights. Thus, application of the exclusionary rule does not\ninevitably follow unless the legislature has enacted such a compulsory remedy. See\nUnited States v. Green, 178 F.3d 1099 (10th Cir. 1999) (search conducted in violation of\nK.S.A. 22-2401a did not warrant application of exclusionary rule); 2 LaFave, Israel, King\n& Kerr, Criminal Procedure § 3.1(e), pp. 30-32 (3d ed. 2007) (searches invalid on state\nlaw grounds do not invariably require suppression of evidence).\n\n\n       Kansas statute provides a vehicle for defendants to move for the suppression of\nevidence seized in violation of law. K.S.A. 22-3216(1) provides that a defendant\n\"aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move . . . to suppress as evidence\nanything so obtained.\" However, it does not compel the trial court to grant that remedy\n                                            134\n\ffor any search conducted in violation of state statute in particular. Compare K.S.A. 22-\n3216(1) with Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 38.23 (West 2005) (\"No evidence obtained\nby an officer or other person in violation of any provisions of the Constitution or laws of\nthe State of Texas, or of the Constitution or laws of the United States of America, shall be\nadmitted in evidence against the accused on the trial of any criminal case.\").\n\n\n       In the absence of the statutory equivalent to the federal exclusionary rule, we\nconsider whether the legislature intended to create individual rights or remedies under\nK.S.A. 22-2401a. See 1 LaFave, Search & Seizure, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment\n§ 1.5(b), pp. 210-12 (5th ed. 2012) (where search challenged on state law grounds, courts\nexamine underlying state statute and legislative intent to determine if suppression is an\navailable remedy); 2 LaFave, Israel, King & Kerr, Criminal Procedure § 3.1(e), pp. 30-32\n(exclusion may be an available remedy for search that violates state law where remedy is\nprovided by statute or statute confers a substantial right, especially one related to Fourth\nAmendment protections).\n\n\n       We addressed this question in Vrabel and found the purpose of K.S.A. 2014 Supp.\n22-2401a was to protect local autonomy, not to create individual rights.\n\n\n       \"[I]t is apparent that the statutory limitations on the jurisdiction of city officers was put in\n       place to protect the local autonomy of neighboring cities and counties, rather than to\n       create an individual right, assuring that a person could only be caught breaking the law by\n       an officer of the jurisdiction within which the crime was being committed.\" 301 Kan. at\n       813.\n\n\nBecause the statute does not vest defendant with any substantive right, it logically follows\nthat suppression of evidence is not an individual remedy available to defendant. Nor can\nRobinson reasonably claim he suffered injury to any substantial right based on the fact\nthat LPD officers, rather than Olathe police, conducted the otherwise lawful trash pulls.\n                                                     135\n\f       We hold that suppression of the evidence seized during LPD officers' trash pulls is\nnot a remedy available to Robinson. See Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 813-14 (suppression of\nevidence not a remedy under K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 22-2401a, \"especially . . . in\ncircumstances . . . where the defendant has not been prejudiced in the least by\" the\nexercise of law enforcement powers). In so holding, we do not suggest exclusion of\nevidence is never a remedy available for a search or seizure conducted in violation of\nstate law. However, where a search is conducted in violation of state statute only and the\nstatute violated does not vest defendant with an individual right, does not contemplate\nexclusion of evidence as a remedy, and the violation results in no cognizable injury to\ndefendant's substantial rights, such a remedy is unavailable.\n\n\n       2. Did the Linn County search violate K.S.A. 22-2401a?\n\n       Under the same statutory authority, Robinson argues LPD officers exceeded their\njurisdiction by executing the warrant to search Robinson's property in Linn County.\n\n\n       The relevant facts are not in dispute. The LPD was in charge of the investigation\nand secured a warrant from a Johnson County district judge to search Robinson's property\nin Linn County. Before obtaining the warrant, LPD discussed the search with the Linn\nCounty Sheriff's Department (LCSD). Before commencing the search, a LCSD deputy\nsigned a document memorializing LCSD's request for assistance from LPD and other\nagencies in executing the warrant.\n\n\n       Kansas statute requires city police officers to exercise their police powers within\nthe territorial boundaries of their employing municipality. K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(a).\nHowever, this general rule is subject to an exception where law enforcement officers\nreceive a request for assistance from another jurisdiction:\n\n                                            136\n\f               \"(2) Law enforcement officers employed by any city may exercise their powers\n       as law enforcement officers:\n               (a) Anywhere within the city limits of the city employing them . . .; and\n               (b) in any other place when a request for assistance has been made by law\n       enforcement officers from that place . . . .\" K.S.A. 22-2401a(2).\n\n\n       Robinson argues this exception does not apply because LCSD's request for\nassistance was not genuine, evidenced by the fact that LCSD did not draft the written\nrequest, did not secure the search warrant, had no prior involvement in the investigation,\nand did not play a lead role during the search. We disagree.\n\n\n       On its face, K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(b) requires only that law enforcement officers\nfrom the host jurisdiction make a request for assistance. See Zimmerman v. Board of\nWabaunsee County Comm'rs, 289 Kan. 926, Syl. ¶ 3, 218 P.3d 400 (2009) (\"An appellate\ncourt merely interprets the language as it appears; it is not free to speculate and cannot\nread into the statute language not readily found there.\"). We have rejected the view that\nK.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(b) includes any genuineness requirement in State v. Ross, 247 Kan.\n191, 194, 795 P.2d 937 (1990) (nothing in the statute suggests legislature intended to\nrequire a request arise from an actual need for assistance). Instead, we held that a request\nfor assistance alone satisfies the technical requirements of the statutory exception,\nregardless of the surrounding facts and extraneous circumstances. 247 Kan. at 195 (\"[i]t\nis not necessary to establish that the need existed . . . only that the request for assistance\nwas made\"). Ross confirms that the written request LCSD executed satisfied the\nrequirements of K.S.A. 22-2401a and LPD had jurisdiction to execute the search warrant\nin Linn County.\n\n\n       Robinson cities State v. Hennessee, 232 Kan. 807, 658 P.2d 1034 (1983), Sodders,\n255 Kan. 79, and State v. Rowe, 18 Kan. App. 2d 572, 856 P.2d 1340, rev. denied 253\n                                                  137\n\fKan. 863 (1993), in support of his position. However, unlike the situation here, in those\ncases law enforcement from the foreign jurisdiction never received a request for\nassistance from the host jurisdiction. Moreover, nothing in Hennessee, Sodders, or Rowe\nsuggests that there must be a genuine need for the requested assistance or that, if the\nrequest is reduced to writing, it must be drafted by the host jurisdiction. In contrast, Ross\nmakes clear that the plain language of K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(b) imposes no such\nrequirements.\n\n\n       3. Did Johnson County searches violate K.S.A. 22-2401a ?\n\n       Finally, Robinson contends the LPD and Overland Park Police Department\n(OPPD) lacked territorial jurisdiction to execute the warrants to search Robinson's\nresidence and storage unit located within the territorial boundaries of the city of Olathe.\n\n\n       However, in 1994, the legislature approved Senate Bill 742, which amended\nK.S.A. 22-2401a (Ensley 1988) to expand the territorial jurisdiction of law enforcement\nofficers in Johnson County when executing arrest and search warrants. L. 1994, ch. 286,\nsec 1. As enacted, the expanded statute of jurisdiction provides:\n\n\n                \"(5) In addition to the areas where law enforcement officers may exercise their\n       powers pursuant to subsection (2), law enforcement officers of any jurisdiction within\n       Johnson or Sedgwick county may exercise their powers as law enforcement officers in\n       any area within the respective county when executing a valid arrest warrant or search\n       warrant, to the extent necessary to execute such warrants.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A. 22-\n       2401a(5).\n\n\n       Robinson argues the phrase \"to the extent necessary to execute such warrants\"\nrequires the State to prove Olathe police had a genuine need for LPD's and OPPD's\ninvolvement in the execution of these warrants. Absent proof that the Olathe Police\n\n                                                  138\n\fDepartment lacked the ability or capacity to execute the warrants independently,\nRobinson believes the statutory exception cannot apply.\n\n\n       Robinson's construction is inconsistent with the plain meaning of K.S.A. 22-\n2401a(5). The subsection begins with a legislative grant of jurisdiction to law\nenforcement officers in Johnson County, allowing them to execute warrants countywide.\nThe legislature's use of the phrase \"when executing a valid . . . search warrant\"\ndemonstrates this grant of jurisdiction is not subject to any condition precedent. The\nphrase \"to the extent required to execute such warrants\" modifies and limits the type of\npolice powers officers may exercise \"when\" executing warrants outside their municipal\nboundaries, i.e., those powers incidental to the execution of the warrants. K.S.A. 22-\n2401a(5). The phrase does not limit the officers' jurisdiction to execute the warrants in\nthe first instance.\n\n\n       This plain meaning is consistent with the history and context that gave rise to the\nlegislature's enactment of K.S.A. 22-2401a(5). In Sodders, the court held that OPPD\nofficers lacked territorial jurisdiction to execute a search warrant within Lenexa city\nlimits, and the mere presence of LPD officers, even at the request of OPPD, did not\nsatisfy the request for assistance exception. 255 Kan. at 84. Only 10 days later, the\nlegislature enacted Senate Bill 742, enacting K.S.A. 22-2401a(5). L. 1994, ch. 286, sec.\n1. The amendment was a legislative response to Sodders designed \"to allow law\nenforcement officers of any jurisdiction within Johnson County or Sedgwick County to\nexercise their powers as law enforcement officers in any area within the respective\ncounty when executing a search warrant.\" Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 807; see State v. Mendez,\n275 Kan. 412, 419, 66 P.3d 811 (2003) (1994 legislative amendment \"clearly\nauthorize[s]\" city police officers in Johnson County to execute search warrants\ncountywide). Thus, even if interpretation of the statute's plain meaning were not possible\n\n\n                                            139\n\fand we needed to turn to construction, Robinson's construction is inconsistent with this\nlegislative purpose.\n\n\n       Based on the plain language of K.S.A. 22-2401a(5), consistent with the context\nand history giving rise to the 1994 amendment creating this subsection, LPD and OPPD\nofficers had territorial jurisdiction to execute the search warrants in Olathe. We find no\nerror in Judge Anderson's denial of defendant's motion to suppress on these grounds.\n\n\nFourth Amendment Challenge to LPD Officers' Trash Pulls\n\n       In addition to challenging LPD officers' trash searches under K.S.A. 22-2401a,\nRobinson believes this investigatory conduct violated his rights under the Fourth\nAmendment.\n\n\n       We apply a two-part analysis to Fourth Amendment challenges to law\nenforcement's trash pulls, considering: (1) whether trash was seized within the curtilage\nof defendant's home; and (2) whether defendant held a reasonable expectation of privacy\nin the trash. State v. Fisher, 283 Kan. 272, 282-83, 154 P.3d 455 (2007).\n\n\n       1. Was the trash located within the curtilage of the residence?\n\n       The Supreme Court considers the following four factors to determine whether a\nsearch was conducted within the curtilage of defendant's residence:\n\n\n       \"the proximity of the area claimed to be curtilage to the home, whether the area is\n       included within an enclosure surrounding the home, the nature of the uses to which the\n       area is put, and the steps taken by the resident to protect the area from observation by\n       people passing by.\" United States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294, 301, 107 S. Ct. 1134, 94 L. Ed.\n       2d 326 (1987).\n\n                                                   140\n\f       As to the first factor, Robinson placed his trash container at curbside, near the end\nof his asphalt parking pad at the outer edge of his property. Robinson's challenge\nnecessarily, but incorrectly, presumes the curtilage extended to the four corners of his\nentire property. Second, the trash container was located 10 to 12 feet beyond the exterior\nfence that encircled the perimeter of the mobile home. Third, the record confirms this\narea was utilized to discard trash, but there is scant evidence suggesting the area was put\nto other uses. Finally, Robinson took no affirmative steps to protect this area from\nobservation by people passing by.\n\n\n       Based on the totality of these circumstances, LPD officers seized Robinson's trash\nbeyond the curtilage of his residence. See United States v. Long, 176 F.3d 1304, 1308\n(10th Cir. 1999) (trash bags placed on top of trailer parked inside property line,\napproximately 3 feet from alley and 7 feet from attached garage, but not shielded from\npublic view, beyond curtilage); United States v. Redding, 540 F. Supp. 2d 1184, 1187 (D.\nKan. 2008) (trash bags located at curbside of defendant's front yard outside front fence\nbeyond curtilage); State v. Alexander, 26 Kan. App. 2d 192, 196-97, 981 P.2d 761 (trash\ninside dumpster at end of driveway near property line, with no fence or barrier around\nhome, beyond curtilage), rev. denied 268 Kan. 848 (1999); United States v. Martinez, No.\n99-2044, 1999 WL 910029, at *2 (10th Cir. 1999) (unpublished opinion) (trash located\noutside chain-link fence of trailer home beyond curtilage); United States v. Cianciarulo,\nNo. 10-40041-01-SAC, 2010 WL 2653423, at *3 (D. Kan. 2010) (unpublished opinion)\n(trash placed at the end of the driveway as if awaiting regular pickup not within\ncurtilage).\n\n\n       Defendant cites Robinson v. Com., 45 Va. App. 592, 612 S.E.2d 751 (2005), for\nthe proposition that a driveway lies within the curtilage because it is an area where people\nwash cars, unload groceries, etc. There, however, family members testified their\n                                            141\n\fdriveway was actually put to such uses. No similar testimony is included in our record.\nAlso, the driveway in that Virginia case was expansive, splitting into two divergent paths\nthat encircled an area of land in front of the home. The Virginia Court of Appeals found\nthe portion of the driveway located next to landscaping adjacent to the home, where\npolice observed evidence of the crime, was located within the curtilage of defendant's\nresidence, not the entire driveway. 45 Va. App. at 606-07. In contrast, Robinson set trash\nout for collection at the farthest edge of his parking pad, located at his property line and\nexposed to other members of the public. Defendant's cited authority is distinguishable.\n\n\n       2. Was there a reasonable expectation of privacy?\n\n       \"Even if the trash bags were in the curtilage, the defendant must show that he had\na reasonable expectation of privacy in them.\" Redding, 540 F. Supp. 2d at 1187; see\nFisher, 283 Kan. at 290-91.\n\n\n       Under nearly identical facts, Kansas courts have found no reasonable expectation\nof privacy in trash set out for collection at the edge of defendant's property in close\nproximity to the curb, even if located within the curtilage. Long, 176 F.3d at 1308-09\n(once defendant put trash on the trailer adjacent to a public thoroughfare for collection,\nhe defeated any reasonable expectation of privacy); Redding, 540 F. Supp. 2d at 1187\n(defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy in trash placed on front curb,\noutside the front fence, for collection); State v. Kimberlin, 267 Kan. 659, 666, 984 P.2d\n141 (1999) (placement of trash out for collection near road, even if located on property,\ndefeated any reasonable expectation of privacy); Alexander, 26 Kan. App. 2d at 200 (no\nexpectation of privacy in trash placed in dumpster 1 1/2 feet from street and clearly\naccessible to the public); Cianciarulo, 2010 WL 2653423, at *3 (\"Society does not\nrecognize a reasonable expectation of privacy in 'trash left for collection in an area\naccessible to the public.'\"); United States v. Hamilton, No. 03-10114-01-WEB, 2003 WL\n\n                                             142\n\f22462511, at *2 (D. Kan. 2003) (unpublished opinion) (no reasonable expectation of\nprivacy in trash bags left out within a few feet of an alley on collection day); Martinez,\n1999 WL 910029, at *2-3 (no reasonable expectation of privacy in trash placed outside\nfence near curb); State v. Baskas, No. 109,760, 2014 WL 3843088, at *7 (Kan. App.\n2014) (unpublished opinion) (law enforcement could search trash bags set out at curbside\nfor collection), rev. denied 302 Kan. ___ (July 21, 2015).\n\n\n       The fact Robinson resided within a private mobile home community does not alter\nour conclusion. Robinson's trash was exposed to fellow residents of the 500-unit mobile\nhome community. The trash also was exposed to members of the public who were free to\nenter the community provided they did not solicit while there. See Barekman v. State,\n200 P.3d 802, 805-06 (Wyo. 2009) (no reasonable expectation of privacy in curbside\ntrash accessible to others, even though defendant resided in private mobile home park);\ncf. United States v. Harris, 6 Fed. Appx. 304, 307-08 (6th Cir. 2001) (unpublished\nopinion) (curbside trash not protected by Fourth Amendment simply because defendant\nlived in gated community).\n\n\nShowing of Necessity for Wiretap Orders\n\n       In his final suppression challenge, Robinson argues that the application for wiretap\nfailed to satisfy a statutory requirement to show a need for this extraordinary\ninvestigatory tool, a standard dubbed the \"necessity requirement.\" See United States v.\nBlackmon, 273 F.3d 1204, 1207 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       The Kansas Wiretap Act provides:\n\n\n\n                                            143\n\f               \"(1) Each application for an order authorizing the interception of a wire, oral or\n       electronic communication shall be made in writing, upon oath or affirmation, to a judge\n       of competent jurisdiction, and shall state the applicant's authority to make such\n       application. Each application shall include the following information:\n                ....\n               \"(c) A full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative\n       procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to\n       succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A. 22-2516(1)(c).\n\n\n       The federal act contains identical language. See 18 U.S.C. § 2518(1)(c) (2012).\nThis is not surprising because the Kansas act largely mirrors the federal provisions, and\ntherefore wiretap applications are subject to both the state and federal requirements. State\nv. Bruce, 295 Kan. 1036, 1040, 287 P.3d 919 (2012). Accordingly, federal decisions\ninterpreting 18 U.S.C. § 2518 are persuasive. See Fredricks v. Foltz, 221 Kan. 28, 30,\n557 P.2d 1252 (1976); cf. Davis v. State, 426 Md. 211, 223, 43 A.3d 1044 (2012).\n\n\n       The purpose of the necessity requirement is \"to assure that wiretapping is not\nresorted to in situations where traditional investigative techniques would suffice to\nexpose the crime,\" United States v. Kahn, 415 U.S. 143, 153 n.12, 94 S. Ct. 977, 39 L.\nEd. 2d 225 (1974), and to prevent law enforcement from employing wiretaps as \"the\ninitial step in criminal investigation.\" United States v. Giordano, 416 U.S. 505, 515, 94 S.\nCt. 1820, 40 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974).\n\n\n       The statute requires the applicant to provide \"a full and complete statement of\nspecific allegations indicating why normal investigative procedures failed or would fail in\nthe particular case.\" Blackmon, 273 F.3d at 1207. General allegations and boilerplate\nlanguage fail to satisfy the necessity requirement. 273 F.3d at 1210. However, courts\n\"have adopted a 'common sense approach' in which the reviewing court uses a standard of\nreasonableness to evaluate the government's good faith effort to use alternative\n\n                                                   144\n\finvestigative means or its failure to do so because of danger or low probability of success.\n[Citation omitted.]\" 273 F.3d at 1207. As such, law enforcement officers are not required\nto exhaust every possible technique before resorting to a wiretap—they must instead\ndemonstrate that wiretapping is not the first meaningful step in the investigation. United\nStates v. Gonzalez, Inc., 412 F.3d 1102, 1113 (9th Cir. 2005), amended and reh. denied\n437 F.3d 854 (9th Cir. 2006).\n\n\n       To the extent Robinson's challenge requires us to construe state or federal versions\nof the necessity requirement, we apply ordinary rules of statutory interpretation and\nconstruction and de novo review. Bruce, 295 Kan. at 1038-39. To the extent the challenge\nrequires the court to assess Judge Anderson's denial of Robinson's motion to suppress\nwiretap evidence, we apply the traditional standard applicable to such motions. 295 Kan.\nat 1039 (factual findings reviewed for substantial competent evidence, legal conclusions\nde novo).\n\n\n       2. Did the application and affidavit satisfy the necessity requirement?\n\n\n       In Section VIII of the wiretap application, prosecutor Morrison and Detective\nBrown (Applicants) set forth allegations to satisfy the necessity requirement. The\napplication describes with particularity reasons why infiltration by undercover agents was\nunlikely to succeed and was too dangerous, given Robinson's desire to solicit women to\nserve as \"slaves\" in BDS&M relationships and his connection to the disappearance of\nother missing women. Applicants explained how the use of informants was likely to be\nunsuccessful because they knew of no informants, other than women who were already\ninvolved with Robinson and could not be trusted to maintain confidences. The applicants\nalso explained that continued surveillance would confirm overt acts but was unlikely to\nyield physical evidence or disclose coconspirator involvement, Robinson's modus\noperandi, or the specific nature of Robinson's relationship with the women he recruited.\n                                            145\n\fApplicants warned that further use of interviews and inquisitional subpoenas might alert\nRobinson to the investigation. Applicants believed more pen register data could\ndocument Robinson's contacts but would not reveal the content of his communications.\n\n\n       As for search warrants, applicants stated that they \"would not provide sufficient\nevidence . . . to accomplish the goals of this investigation.\" Applicants defined those\ngoals to include:\n\n\n       \"a.    [G]athering sufficient evidence to successfully prosecute John E. Robinson and\n              others yet unknown for the murder and kidnapping of Suzette Trouten.\n       \"b.    Identify[ing] future kidnapping victims targeted by John Robinson and\n              gather[ing] sufficient information to intervene and prevent harm to any future\n              victims.\"\n\n\n       The application also incorporated by reference the averments set forth in Detective\nBrown's 31-page supporting affidavit. This affidavit set out findings uncovered through\nlaw enforcement's witness interviews, inquisitional subpoenas, extensive surveillance,\ntrash pulls, analysis of pen register data, public record searches, consent searches, and\nother investigative practices.\n\n\n       In particular, Brown explained Robinson had been implicated in the disappearance\nof several women dating back to the mid-1980s; he enticed them into sexual\nrelationships, often involving BDS&M, and lured them to Johnson County with offers of\nemployment, travel, and financial gain; he had done the same with Suzette Trouten; and\nsince her disappearance had targeted new women using a similar modus operandi. Brown\nexplained that Robinson used his cell phone extensively and it was instrumental in his\nefforts to solicit and maintain relationships with these women—a conclusion supported\nby findings from LPD officers' extensive surveillance, use of inquisitional subpoenas, and\nanalysis of pen register data. See United States v. Nguyen, 46 F.3d 781, 783 (8th Cir.\n                                                146\n\f1995) (necessity requirement satisfied where affidavit showed targets of investigation\nwere dangerous, difficult to infiltrate, and conducted most of their crimes over the\ntelephone; and government had tried using pen registers, confidential informants,\nsurveillance, and garbage searches before pursuing wiretap).\n\n\n       Robinson does not dispute that applicants satisfied the necessity requirement in\ndiscussing several traditional investigative techniques. However, he suggests the\napplicants' boilerplate statement that search warrants would not effectively advance the\ngoals of the investigation was insufficient and invalidates the wiretap order. We disagree.\n\n\n       The majority of courts have not construed the necessity requirement in such a\nstrict, technical fashion. The statute \"does not impose upon the government an exhaustion\nrequirement but rather requires the government to establish that it first made a 'reasonable\ngood faith effort' to utilize other available normal and less intrusive investigative\ntechniques before resorting to a wiretap. [Citation omitted.]\" United States v. Melendez-\nSantiago, 447 F. Supp. 2d 144, 149 (D.P.R. 2006), aff'd 644 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 2011).\nWiretap applicants satisfy the necessity requirement by supplying a detailed overview of\nthe investigation to date, concrete reasons why a wiretap was necessary, and explanations\nof how a range of traditional investigative techniques were proving, or were expected to\nprove, unlikely to succeed or too dangerous. United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, 430 F.3d 1, 9\n(1st Cir. 2005); see United States v. Maynard, 615 F.3d 544, 550 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (law\nenforcement engaged in an adequate range of investigative endeavors; government not\nrequired to enumerate every technique or opportunity missed or overlooked), aff'd in part\nsub nom. United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 945, 181 L. Ed. 2d 911 (2012);\nUnited States v. Stewart, 306 F.3d 295, 305 (6th Cir. 2002) (\"In endeavoring to secure a\nwiretap warrant, the government need not prove the impossibility of other means of\nobtaining information.\"). Here, the application and affidavit did just that, establishing law\nenforcement's need for a wiretap and confirming that it was not an option of first resort.\n                                             147\n\f       Independently, the applicants' general statement regarding the ineffectiveness of\nsearch warrants in accomplishing the goals of the investigation was supported by\nparticularized, case-specific information contained within the four corners of the\napplication and affidavit. The affidavit detailed how traditional investigatory techniques\nhad revealed that defendant's criminal scheme involved soliciting and maintaining\nrelationships with women and that he was highly dependent on his cell phone to\nperpetuate this scheme. Law enforcement officers had already issued subpoenas to\ndefendant's telephone carriers and analyzed pen register data tracking calls from his home\nand cellular phone, but they needed to ascertain the substance of Robinson's\nconversations with the women he targeted to advance the goals of the investigation. From\nthese averments one can reasonably infer that resort to search warrants, like other\nalternative investigatory methods described in the application, would not have produced\nthis evidence.\n\n\n       Viewed together, the averments set forth in the application and affidavit supported\nthe boilerplate language regarding the ineffectiveness of search warrants, thereby\nsatisfying the necessity requirement. See United States v. Sobamowo, 892 F.2d 90, 93\n(D.C. Cir. 1989) (conclusory language cannot rationally be separated from preceding\ndetailed descriptions of investigative events); United States v. Carneiro, 861 F.2d 1171,\n1177 (9th Cir. 1988) (\"While it is true that some of the statements in the affidavit are\nmere conclusions, the facts set forth in the affidavit meet the necessity requirement when\nexamined as a whole and in a common-sense fashion.\"); United States v. Brone, 792 F.2d\n1504, 1506 (9th Cir. 1986) (\"the affidavit made somewhat conclusory assertions about\nthe difficulties of prosecuting the case, but these assertions were in the context of an\naffidavit that was sufficiently specific in all other respects\"); United States v. Sims, 508\nFed. Appx. 452, 457 (6th Cir. 2012) (unpublished opinion) (boilerplate language was not\nfatal to application where it also contained particular facts demonstrating wiretaps were\n                                             148\n\fnot being used routinely as the initial step in criminal investigation), cert. denied 133 S.\nCt. 1847 (2013); United States v. Flores-Velasquez, Crim. No. 06-310(2) ADM/JJG,\n2006 WL 3544927, at *3-4 (D. Minn. 2006) (unpublished opinion) (despite boilerplate\nlanguage, application as a whole established need for wiretap).\n\n\n       Robinson relies on United States v. Ramirez-Encarnacion, 291 F.3d 1219 (10th\nCir. 2002), in support of the proposition that boilerplate language describing the\neffectiveness of search warrants is legally insufficient. There, the Tenth Circuit took the\nposition that the statute requires applicants to describe all traditional investigatory\ntechniques, including use of search warrants, with particularity. 291 F.3d at 1222.\n\n\n       Robinson's reliance on Ramirez-Encarnacion is unpersuasive. The Tenth Circuit\nstands alone in requiring applicants to address all traditional investigatory techniques\nwith particularity. United States v. Mesa-Rincon, 911 F.2d 1433, 1444 (10th Cir. 1990)\n(recognizing other circuits require only a discussion of techniques employed and\nexplanation as to why a range of investigation methods would be ineffective or\ndangerous), modified on other grounds by United States v. Castillo-Garcia, 117 F.3d\n1179 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n       In addition, even under its more stringent framework, the Tenth Circuit reviews\nthe totality of the information and considers whether boilerplate language is adequately\nsupported within the four corners of the application. Ramirez-Encarnacion, 291 F.3d at\n1222 (court must consider all facts and circumstances in assessing showing of necessity);\nCastillo-Garcia, 117 F.3d at 1188 (court will overlook failure to adequately explain one\nor more specified categories of normal investigative techniques where recitation of facts\nmakes explanation unnecessary), overruled on other grounds by Ramirez-Encarnacion\n291 F.3d at 1222 n.1.\n\n\n                                             149\n\f       Here, the general language describing the ineffectiveness of search warrants was\nadequately supported by the averments contained in the four corners of the application\nand supporting affidavit. United States v. Segura, 318 Fed. Appx. 706, 709-10 (10th Cir.\n2009) (unpublished opinion) (necessity requirement met where boilerplate statement\nregarding effectiveness of search warrants supported by facts in affidavit). We find no\nerror in Judge Anderson's ruling.\n\n\n                                     4. JURY SELECTION\n\n\n       Defendant raises eight different issues related to the jury selection process,\nincluding: (1) whether Judge Anderson improperly curtailed voir dire questioning; (2)\nwhether he erroneously denied defense challenges for cause; (3) whether he made\ndisparate rulings on similarly situated challenges for cause; (4) whether he improperly\ndenied a motion to strike a small group voir dire panel exposed to Juror 173's\ninflammatory remarks; (5) whether he improperly retained five panelists in light of\nalleged juror-specific bias; (6) whether he erred by excusing Juror 253 based on her\nopposition to the death penalty; (7) whether jury selection was tainted by alleged\nprosecutorial misconduct; and (8) whether the anonymous jury selection procedure was\nunlawful. We address each challenge in turn.\n\n\nScope of Voir Dire\n\n       1. Standard of Review and Legal Framework\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson improperly curtailed the scope of voir dire in\nfour respects, each of which he characterizes as separate claims. First, he contends Judge\nAnderson violated Kansas law by prohibiting case-specific questions regarding panelists'\nability to consider a life sentence. Second, he argues the same limitation violated his\nconstitutional rights. Third, he believes this limitation impaired his ability to identify\n                                             150\n\fmitigation-impaired jurors, violating state and federal law. Finally, he claims Judge\nAnderson improperly limited questioning on his prior terms of incarceration.\n\n\n       We apply the following standard of review to scope of voir dire challenges:\n\n       \"Generally the nature and scope of the voir dire examination is entrusted to the sound\n       discretion of the trial court. Manning, 270 Kan. at 691. However, '\"[i]n determining\n       whether the trial court has taken sufficient measures to assure that the accused is tried by\n       an impartial jury free from outside influences, appellate tribunals have the duty to make\n       an independent evaluation of the circumstances.\"' State v. Aikins, 261 Kan. 346, 366, 932\n       P.2d 408 (1997).\" State v. Hayden, 281 Kan. 112, 128-29, 130 P.3d 24 (2006).\n\n\nSee State v. Reyna, 290 Kan. 666, 686, 234 P.3d 761(same), cert. denied 131 S. Ct. 532\n(2010).\n\n\n       The trial court's discretion is not without constitutional limit. The Sixth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the accused \"[i]n all criminal\nprosecutions\" the right to a trial by \"an impartial jury.\" \"Principles of Fifth Amendment\ndue process also guarantee a defendant an impartial jury.\" Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589,\n595 n.6, 96 S. Ct. 1017, 47 L. Ed. 2d 258 (1976). The Supreme Court has acknowledged\nthat an adequate voir dire is essential to the realization of these due process protections.\nMorgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 729-30, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992)\n(noting that part of guarantee of defendant's right to impartial jury is an adequate voir\ndire; without it, the trial judge cannot fulfill his or her responsibility to remove those who\ncannot impartially follow instructions and evaluate the evidence).\n\n       We \"will find an abuse of discretion if the court unconstitutionally restricted [a\ncapital defendant's] questioning during voir dire.\" United States v.

Ward, 184 F.3d\n1206 (10th Cir. 1999).\n\n\n        2. Did scope of voir dire rulings violate Kansas law?\n\n        Robinson argues the trial court consistently denied counsel's efforts to utilize case-\nspecific questioning to detect and disqualify panelists who would not realistically\nconsider a life sentence in violation of K.S.A. 22-3408, 22-3410, 22-3412, and the\nholding in State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, 40 P.3d 139 (2001), cert. denied 537 U.S. 834\n(2002), overruled on other grounds by Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516,\n165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006). To frame the issue properly, it is important to understand\nJudge Anderson's rulings pertaining to the scope of voir dire and the events giving rise to\nthem.\n\n\n        At the outset of the second phase of jury selection, small group voir dire, defense\ncounsel injected case-specific facts into his line of questioning, specifically disclosing\nthat Robinson had been charged with capital murder involving the killings of six women,\nincluding two 19 year olds, one of whom was in a wheelchair. The State objected,\narguing defense counsel was improperly staking out jurors (\"staking\" jurors is the\npractice of asking case-specific questions designed to commit prospective jurors to a\nparticular vote or to disclose how they would vote when faced with certain case-specific\nfacts). Judge Anderson overruled the objection, explaining defense counsel was entitled\nto go into the factual basis of the charges to the extent it was consistent with the\nanticipated trial evidence or reported media facts. However, Judge Anderson cautioned\ndefense counsel not to phrase such questions in a manner intended to elicit a commitment\nor promise from prospective jurors.\n\n\n\n\n                                             152\n\f       Defense counsel continued to disclose case-specific facts and incorporate them\ninto questioning throughout the first 2 days of the second phase of jury selection, where\nthe parties examined prospective jurors in panels of six on topics of pretrial publicity and\nthe death penalty. During this time, defense counsel also began to incorporate case-\nspecific facts into questions about how prospective jurors would decide the sentencing\nissue. For example, Robinson's counsel began to ask how much weight jurors would\nassign to a defendant's background and whether this type of mitigation evidence would be\nsufficient to warrant a life sentence.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson grew increasingly concerned that Robinson's line of questioning\nwas staking out the jury—a concern compounded by the fact that jurors were answering\nthese questions devoid of any knowledge of the law governing the sentencing decision.\nOn the morning of September 20, 2002, after completing 2 full days of small group voir\ndire, Judge Anderson established new guidelines for handling case-specific questions. He\nmade clear that defense counsel could continue to disclose potentially inflammatory case-\nspecific facts, including information regarding the victims, to determine whether they\nrendered potential jurors biased. However, Judge Anderson believed the case-specific\nquestioning should be compartmentalized, raising those facts during questions about bias\nrather than sentencing. Defense counsel objected, saying several veniremembers had\nexpressed in questionnaire responses that a person who committed crimes involving\ncertain case-specific facts deserved to die. Thus the defense believed that inflammatory\ncase-specific facts were \"inextricably intertwined\" with the sentencing issue.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson clarified:\n\n               \"I want to make it very clear. I am not prohibiting the defense from going into the\n       basic sketch of the factual allegations in the fashion that [defense counsel] gave the other\n       day. I am requiring that that not be rolled into and brought up in the midst of a\n       comparison between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, because I do believe\n                                                   153\n\f       that the fashion which it's been raised during the last session Wednesday is tantamount to\n       testing the jury to determine whether the specific, albeit very brief, factual allegations of\n       the State would be weighed by the jury against the very generic mitigating circumstance\n       without the factual comparison which we can't do because we are essentially getting into\n       taking a vote on death penalty issues when we start doing that which would produce a\n       juror that essentially would vote favorably for the defense and we are staking out the jury\n       when we get to that point.\n               \"I want you both to thoroughly explore the attitudes of the jury under\n       Witherspoon. But I don't want to get into a determination during voir dire as to what this\n       individual juror's position is on it and how they would vote on it and how much weight\n       they would attach and whether that's over the threshold of overcoming the aggravating\n       circumstance which is what I think you were getting into the other day. That's why I'm\n       requiring that that factual basis be brought up during the portion of the voir dire. They're\n       entitled to know it and you said to almost all of them, 'Do you know what the factual\n       allegations are?' The process that we went through the other day did produce numbers of\n       jurors who said they just didn't think there was anything that was going to convince them\n       not to vote for the death penalty because of the factual allegations of the case.\n               \"The defendant's voir dire has been effective in determining those jurors who\n       cannot do this process of giving meaningful consideration to mitigating circumstances,\n       and I do not believe this is contrary to the Constitution or to the case law counsel is\n       citing. I stand by my ruling in that regard.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       After the district judge ruled, defense counsel continued to inform prospective\njurors of the alleged case-specific facts they believed to be most inflammatory or which\nhad the greatest potential to create bias among members of the venire, including the fact\nthat multiple people were murdered, along with the gender, age, and disability status of\nthe victims. After disclosing the case-specific allegations, defense counsel consistently\nasked prospective jurors whether they could remain impartial.\n\n\n       In several instances, defense counsel asked these case-specific questions in the\ncontext of sentencing. For example, defense counsel asked Juror 283 whether she could\n\n                                                    154\n\frealistically consider a life sentence knowing the victims in this case were women, after\nher questionnaire responses expressed that people who prey on innocent women are sick\nand evil. Similarly, Juror 177 disclosed in questionnaire responses his belief that people\nwho prey on weaker victims should be punished severely. Defense counsel explored the\npossibility that this view would control his sentencing decision given that all of\nRobinson's alleged victims were women, including one confined to a wheelchair. While\nexploring death penalty views with Juror 542, Robinson's counsel asked whether as a\nfather of a young daughter, this juror could serve impartially, knowing Robinson was\ncharged with killing young, teenage women. Defense counsel asked Juror 484 whether\nher work counseling sex abuse victims would prevent her from serving impartially, given\nthe State's allegations of Robinson's violence against women and his participation in\nBDS&M activity. Defense counsel asked Juror 398 whether he could vote for a life\nsentence in a case involving a serial killer based on his questionnaire responses\nsuggesting that life imprisonment would not be an appropriate punishment in that\ninstance. Defense counsel employed similar lines of questioning with Jurors 463, 398,\nand 366.\n\n\n          Judge Anderson also allowed the defense to utilize case-specific questioning\nduring the third phase of jury selection, general voir dire. During this phase, Robinson's\ncounsel asked panel members whether certain case-specific facts, including violence\nagainst women, BDS&M activity, adultery, gruesome photographs, and other case-\nspecific evidence anticipated at trial would render them incapable of serving as impartial\njurors.\n\n\n          Robinson identifies only two instances relevant to this claim where the trial court\nenforced its ruling and limited the scope of inquiry. The first occurred during defense\ncounsel's questioning of prospective Juror 205, and the second occurred during defense\ncounsel's questioning of Juror 246. A review of the transcript confirms that in both\n                                               155\n\finstances, defense counsel's questions invited these panelists to compare the various\ntheories or categories of aggravation and mitigation that were likely to be at issue in the\ncase and discuss how such evidence would affect their sentencing decision, i.e., staked\nout the jury.\n\n\n       Short of such a line of inquiry, Judge Anderson did not substantially limit\nRobinson's case-specific inquiry during voir dire. He allowed the defense to inform\nprospective jurors of sensitive case-specific allegations during small group voir dire;\nexplore potential juror bias related to such facts; examine whether case-specific facts\nprevented jurors from realistically considering a life sentence, particularly when\nquestionnaire responses indicated potential case-specific bias; and discuss potential bias\nin response to case-specific evidence during general voir dire. Contrary to Robinson's\nassertion, Judge Anderson's rulings did not categorically prohibit case-specific\nquestioning. Nor did they limit case-specific questioning in the context of sentencing.\nInstead, the rulings limited case-specific questioning only to the extent such questions\ncalled on prospective jurors to assign weight to case-specific facts under Kansas'\nweighing equation and to disclose their likely sentencing decision in light of such facts.\n\n\n       With a clearer understanding of Judge Anderson's rulings, we return to the\nanalysis of Robinson's claim that they violated Kansas' voir dire statute, which provides:\n\n                \"The prosecuting attorney and the defendant or his attorney shall conduct the\n       examination of prospective jurors. The court may conduct an additional examination. The\n       court may limit the examination by the defendant, his attorney or the prosecuting attorney\n       if the court believes such examination to be harassment, is causing unnecessary delay or\n       serves no useful purpose.\" K.S.A. 22-3408(3).\n\n\n       By limiting case-specific questioning that required prospective jurors to assign\nweight to aggravating or mitigating circumstances and provisionally decide the sentence\n\n                                                  156\n\fin light of such facts, Judge Anderson's rulings can be construed reasonably from the\nrecord as an attempt to avoid \"unnecessary delay\" on a subject that served \"no useful\npurpose,\" i.e., staking out the jury. As such, the rulings reflect a permissible exercise of\nlawful discretion under Kansas' voir dire statute.\n\n\n       For the same reasons, Robinson's arguments under K.S.A. 22-3410 and K.S.A. 22-\n3412 are equally unavailing. K.S.A. 22-3410 entitles parties to \"challenge any\nprospective juror for cause.\" K.S.A. 22-3412 provides that defendants \"charged with an\noff-grid felony . . . shall be allowed 12 peremptory challenges.\" Robinson argues Judge\nAnderson's rulings \"prevented counsel from eliciting biases that would give rise to\nchallenges for cause\" and \"impaired the defense's use of peremptory challenges.\" This\nargument is founded on the assumption that Judge Anderson categorically denied\nRobinson opportunity to explore juror bias related to case-specific factual allegations.\nThis clearly was not the case.\n\n\n       Robinson cites to several state court decisions from other jurisdictions that stand\nfor the general proposition that jurors in capital proceedings who cannot consider both\navailable sentencing options are not qualified to serve. Robinson also cites State v.\nJackson, 107 Ohio St. 3d 53, 836 N.E.2d 1173 (2005), and United States v. Flores, 63\nF.3d 1342 (5th Cir. 1995), for the corollary proposition that defendants should be\ninformed of inflammatory case-specific facts (a 3-year-old victim and a victim who was a\nknown drug dealer in those cases) in order to discern potential bias. In his Rule 6.09\nletter, Robinson also cites to State v. Clark, 981 S.W.2d 143, 147 (Mo. 1998), for a\nsimilar proposition.\n\n\n       These holdings arose from a trial court's categorical refusal to allow defendants\nany opportunity to disclose or question jurors on case-specific facts during voir dire. As\ndiscussed above, Judge Anderson's rulings did not bar such inquiry. Defense counsel\n                                             157\n\ffreely informed prospective jurors of inflammatory case-specific facts and inquired\nwhether such facts rendered them partial.\n\n\n       Finally, Robinson argues Judge Anderson's rulings violated the holding of\nKleypas. There the capital defendant argued \"the trial court erred in denying his request\nfor a separate sentencing jury,\" resulting in prejudice \"because the same jury that heard\nhis guilt phase also heard the penalty phase argument.\" 272 Kan. at 994. More\nspecifically, defendant argued that the failure to provide a separate sentencing jury placed\nhim in the \"untenable position of being unable to voir dire the jury as to its bias regarding\ncertain aggravating circumstances, such as his prior record, for fear of prejudicing the\njury in the guilt phase.\" 272 Kan. at 995. However, we rejected this argument because\nKleypas failed to take advantage of provisions within the capital sentencing scheme\nallowing him to question jurors about his criminal record and remove those biased at the\nstart of the penalty phase:\n\n               \"K.S.A. 21-4624(b) provides a method for the defendant in every capital-murder\n       case to remove biased jurors during the penalty phase. The defendant is entitled to ask\n       questions during voir dire before the sentencing phase of the trial begins. Here, Kleypas\n       chose not to voir dire the jurors concerning the binding effect of his prior murder\n       conviction or any of the aggravating circumstances. However, that procedure existed as a\n       method of removing potentially biased jurors for cause.\" 272 Kan. at 995.\n\n\n       Robinson believes the above-cited language in Kleypas squarely authorizes case-\nspecific questions regarding a panelist's willingness and ability to consider a life\nsentence. To the contrary, Kleypas did not address the permissible scope of voir dire in a\ncapital proceeding. Even if it had, Judge Anderson's ruling did not preclude counsel from\nexploring whether case-specific facts rendered prospective jurors unqualified for service.\nAnd, like the defendant in Kleypas, Robinson did not request a separate opportunity to\n\n\n                                                   158\n\fvoir dire the jury after conviction and before the start of the penalty phase. See 272 Kan.\nat 995. Judge Anderson's rulings are not inconsistent with our holding in Kleypas.\n\n\n       3. Did scope of voir dire rulings violate constitutional rights?\n\n       Robinson also argues Judge Anderson's voir dire rulings violated his federal\nconstitutional rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n\n       Any question concerning the constitutionally permissible scope of voir dire in\ncapital proceedings necessarily begins with a discussion of Morgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S.\n719, 729-30, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992), where the Supreme Court\nrecognized a capital defendant's constitutional right to a \"life-qualified\" jury and the\nconcomitant right to remove for cause on the ground of bias any prospective juror who\nwill automatically vote for the death penalty irrespective of the facts or the trial court's\ninstructions of law. Morgan recognized that a capital defendant must be afforded a\nreasonable opportunity to voir dire prospective jurors to effectively remove those who are\nnot \"life-qualified.\" 504 U.S. at 733-34. Morgan ultimately held the petitioner \"was\nentitled, upon his request, to inquiry discerning those jurors who, even prior to the State's\ncase in chief, had predetermined the terminating issue of his trial, that being whether to\nimpose the death penalty.\" 504 U.S. at 736.\n\n\n       Robinson claims Judge Anderson imposed a categorical prohibition on case-\nspecific voir dire questioning in violation of his constitutional rights. The argument is\nlegally and factually suspect. First, since Morgan, the majority of federal appellate courts\nhave rejected the notion that the Constitution mandates case-specific questioning during\nvoir dire in capital proceedings. Foremost among this authority is McVeigh, 153 F.3d\n1166, the appeal of the defendant convicted of bombing the Murrah Federal Building in\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma. There, defendant challenged the trial court's limitation on\n\n                                              159\n\fcase-specific questioning during voir dire. The Tenth Circuit first identified two\ncategories of Morgan-related inquiries advanced by the defense: (1) \"'general Morgan\nquestions'\" that inquired whether the juror would automatically impose the death penalty\nif a defendant were convicted of a capital offense; and (2) \"'specific Morgan questions'\"\nthat inquired whether the facts of the bombing, as revealed through pretrial publicity, had\npredisposed prospective jurors toward automatically imposing the death penalty on\nanyone convicted. 153 F.3d at 1206. The Tenth Circuit found the trial court had not\nlimited any of the properly phrased \"general Morgan questions,\" but it had precluded\n\"specific Morgan questions.\" 153 F.3d at 1207-08.\n\n\n       Even so, the Tenth Circuit found no abuse of discretion, reasoning that defendant's\ncase-specific inquiry exceeded constitutional requirements under Morgan:\n\n       \"Essentially, the questions were designed to ascertain whether the jurors felt that the\n       circumstances of the bombing were so aggravating that no mitigating factor could\n       compensate. Thus, these were case-specific questions seeking to determine what\n       prospective jurors thought of the death penalty in regards to this particular case, rather\n       than the jurors' core value system regarding imposition of the death penalty. Morgan,\n       however, is designed to illuminate a juror's basic beliefs 'regardless of the facts and\n       circumstances of conviction,' Morgan, 504 U.S. at 735, 112 S. Ct. 2222, not to allow\n       defendants to pre-determine jurors' views of the appropriate punishment for the particular\n       crime charged. Morgan does not require that the questions at issue be asked.\" 153 F.3d at\n       1208.\n\n\nThe Tenth Circuit was satisfied that the district court's safeguards—including use of a\njury questionnaire; appropriate instructions; and abstract life-qualifying questions—\nprovided defendant adequate opportunity to identify juror bias. 153 F.3d at 1208-09.\n\n\n       The majority of federal circuits addressing the issue have adopted the same\nrationale. See Oken v. Corcoran, 220 F.3d 259, 266 (4th Cir. 2000) (state court's finding\n                                                   160\n\fthat abstract voir dire questions addressing prospective jurors' ability to consider life\nsentence were constitutionally adequate and neither contrary to nor an unreasonable\napplication of Morgan); Trevino v. Johnson, 168 F.3d 173, 183 (5th Cir. 1999) (state trial\ncourt's refusal to allow voir dire inquiry on \"youth\" as a mitigating factor did not give rise\nto a constitutional violation; Morgan only requires jurors be asked whether they would\nautomatically impose the death penalty upon conviction); McQueen v. Scroggy, 99 F.3d\n1302, 1330 (6th Cir. 1996) (abstract, life-and-death qualification questions were\nsufficient to satisfy constitutional rigor), overruled on other grounds by In re\nAbdur'Rahman, 392 F.3d 174 (6th Cir. 2004).\n\n\n       Several state courts have followed suit. See Hagood v. Alabama, 777 So. 2d 162,\n177 (Ala. Crim. App. 1998) (\"'\"[T]he use of hypothetical questions is of doubtful\npropriety certainly where one aspect of the putative evidence is singled out to probe for a\nsympathetic commitment as much as to explore for an impartial mind.\" [Citation\nomitted.]. . . On voir dire, \"[a] party may not . . . solicit a promise to return a particular\nverdict.\"' [Citations omitted.]\"); Lucas v. State, 274 Ga. 640, 646, 555 S.E.2d 440 (2001)\n(\"'improper to require the juror to enumerate hypothetical circumstances in which she\nmight or might not vote to impose the death penalty'\"); State v. Ball, 824 So. 2d 1089,\n1110 (La. 2002) (\"[V]oir dire does not encompass unlimited inquiry by defendant into all\npossible prejudices of prospective jurors, including their opinions on evidence, or its\nweight, hypothetical questions, or questions of law that call for any prejudgment of\nsupposed facts in the case.\"); State v. Stanko, 376 S.C. 571, 576-77, 658 S.E.2d 94 (2008)\n(limiting case-specific voir dire not an abuse of discretion where questionnaire explored\npotential impartiality and trial court used abstract questions to life qualify jurors); State v.\nMoeller, 616 N.W.2d 424, 442 (S.D. 2000) (\"It was proper for State to use the\nhypothetical concept of a mental defect or a 15-year-old person to explain the concept of\na mitigating factor. However, it would have been improper for it to then ask the potential\njuror whether he would impose a life sentence or death based upon that hypothetical,\n                                              161\n\fespecially if those were truly the facts of the case. Such a question would be akin to\n'staking out' the potential juror's responses, and that is not permitted.\"); Schmitt v.\nCommonwealth, 262 Va. 127, 141, 547 S.E.2d 186 (2001) (no abuse of discretion where\ntrial court prevented defense from asking prospective jurors to speculate as to \"whether\nthey would automatically impose a death sentence for certain types of killings or under\ncertain hypothetical circumstances\").\n\n\n       Again, the very premise of Robinson's argument that Judge Anderson\ncategorically prohibited case-specific questioning is unsupported by the record. As set\nforth above, Judge Anderson permitted defense counsel to disclose case-specific facts and\nto inquire whether those facts rendered prospective jurors unable to be impartial or\nprevented them from meaningfully considering mitigation evidence or a life sentence.\n\n\n       Even the minority of courts that have found case-specific questioning to be\nrequired under certain circumstances would not take issue with Judge Anderson's rulings.\nThese courts have adopted a balancing approach, finding it improper to categorically\ndeny case-specific questioning but also recognizing that such questioning is not without\nlimits and cannot be used to stake out jurors. These courts have found constitutional\nrequirements to be satisfied as long as prospective jurors are informed of potentially\ninflammatory case-specific facts and/or the defense is allowed to explore whether such\nfacts render prospective jurors unable to be impartial. See United States v. Wilson, 493 F.\nSupp. 2d 402, 405 (E.D.N.Y. 2006); United States v. Fell, 372 F. Supp. 2d 766, 769-71\n(D. Vt. 2005); United States v. Johnson , 366 F. Supp. 2d 822, 848-49 (N.D. Iowa 2005);\nPeople v. Carasi, 44 Cal. 4th 1263, 1285-87, 190 P.3d 616 (2008); People v. Coffman\nand Marlow, 34 Cal. 4th 1, 46-47, 17 Cal. Rptr. 3d 710, 96 P.3d 30, 82 Cal. Rptr. 3d 265\n(2004); Ellington v. State, 292 Ga. 109, 127-28, 735 S.E.2d 736 (2012). Robinson was\nable to do just that notwithstanding Judge Anderson's rulings.\n\n\n                                              162\n\f       Robinson again cites Jackson, 107 Ohio St. 3d 53, where the Ohio Supreme Court\nheld that the trial judge should have informed jurors the victim was a 3-year-old child,\nwhich would have elicited more informed responses to abstract questions regarding their\nimpartiality. 107 Ohio St. 3d at 62-65. Judge Anderson not only allowed the defense to\ninform prospective jurors of case-specific facts, but also gave counsel leeway to explore\npanelists' impartiality and ability to consider both sentencing options notwithstanding\nthese facts. Jackson does not alter our conclusion.\n\n\n       Robinson also relies on Uttecth v. Brown, 551 U.S. 1, 127 S. Ct. 2218, 167 L. Ed.\n2d 1014 (2007). However, Uttecth considered whether a trial court properly excused a\njuror who expressed uncertainty as to his ability to impose a sentence of death. The\nproper scope of voir dire and the permissibility of case-specific questioning were not\nissues before the Supreme Court. Uttecth is inapposite.\n\n\n       Robinson had the opportunity to formulate his own questions regarding case-\nspecific facts in the questionnaire. During small group voir dire, the defense disclosed\nsensitive case-specific allegations and probed jurors for potential bias, both in general\nand specific to sentencing, in response to such facts. Judge Anderson's rulings limited\ninquiry only when it required prospective jurors to prejudge the penalty issue based on a\ngeneral description of case-specific facts. Defendant had ample opportunity to identify\nthose unqualified to serve. See People v. Sanders, 11 Cal. 4th 475, 539, 46 Cal. Rptr. 2d\n751, 905 P.2d 420 (1995) (no error in trial court's limiting hypothetical questions\nrequiring jurors to provide advisory opinion based on preview of evidence). We find no\nconstitutional violation in Judge Anderson's rulings.\n\n\n\n\n                                            163\n\f       4. Did scope of voir dire rulings conceal mitigation impairment?\n\n       Robinson believes Judge Anderson imposed a \"blanket prohibition\" on case-\nspecific mitigation inquiry, preventing the defense from identifying panelists who were\nmitigation-impaired, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and Sections 1, 5, 9 and 10 of\nthe Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights.\n\n\n       Robinson does not suggest the Kansas Constitution affords him protections\nbeyond those provided under the United States Constitution, and we have so far held that\nthese state constitutional provisions are generally subject to the same analysis as their\nfederal counterparts. See State v. Scott, 265 Kan. 1, Syl. ¶ 1, 961 P.2d 667 (1998) (Eighth\nAmendment and Section 9 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights are nearly identical\nand construed similarly); State ex rel. Tomasic v. City of Kansas City, 237 Kan. 572, 583,\n701 P.2d 1314 (1985) (Section 1 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights given same\neffect as the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment); State v. Next Door\nCinema Corp., 225 Kan. 112, 115, 587 P.2d 326 (1978) (Fourteenth Amendment due\nprocess standard applies to state due process challenge under Section 10 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights). As such, we find federal authority on the subject persuasive.\n\n\n       Robinson's claim is both legally and factually suspect. First, the majority of federal\ncourts have rejected the view that defendants have a constitutional right to case-specific\nmitigation questioning during voir dire. United States v. Tipton, 90 F.3d 861, 879 (4th\nCir. 1996) (no error in refusing to allow detailed questioning during voir dire concerning\nspecific mitigating factors), cert. denied 520 U.S. 1253 (1997); United States v.\nMcCullah, 76 F.3d 1087, 1113-14 (10th Cir. 1996) (Morgan requires questioning during\nvoir dire regarding whether jurors would automatically impose the death penalty and does\nnot require specific questioning regarding mitigating factors), cert. denied 520 U.S. 1213\n(1997); Wilson, 493 F. Supp. 2d at 405 (allowing voir dire on specific types of mitigation\n\n                                             164\n\for aggravation evidence does \"not serve the goal of uncovering impermissible bias, but\nonly beg[s] follow-up questions that trend toward stake-out or pre-commitment\nquestions\").\n\n\n       Numerous state courts have adopted the same view. People v. Jackson, 182 Ill. 2d\n30, 61-62, 695 N.E.2d 391 (1998) (trial court properly refused to ask case-specific\nquestions regarding aggravating and mitigating circumstances; abstract questions\nregarding jurors' ability to consider both sentencing options satisfied constitutional\nscrutiny); Evans v. State, 333 Md. 660, 675-77, 637 A.2d 117 (1994) (refusal to allow\ncase-specific questioning on aggravating circumstances consistent with Morgan);\nHolland v. State, 705 So. 2d 307, 338-39 (Miss. 1997) (jurors cannot be asked to give\nweight to aggravators during voir dire); Witter v. State, 112 Nev. 908, 915-16, 921 P.2d\n886 (1996) (case-specific questions regarding statutory aggravator would have\nimproperly staked out jurors and were not required under Morgan or Witherspoon v.\nIllinois, 391 U.S. 510, 519-23, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776 [1968]), cert. denied 520\nU.S. 1217 (1997), abrogated on other grounds by Nunnery v. State, 127 Nev. Adv. Op.\n69, 263 P.3d 235 (2011); State v. Fletcher, 500 S.E.2d 668, 679 (N.C. 1998) (voir dire\nquestions comparing aggravating and mitigating circumstances improper); State v.\nWilson, 74 Ohio St. 3d 381, 386-87, 659 N.E.2d 292 (1996) (Morgan does not require\nvoir dire on specific mitigating circumstances), cert. denied 519 U.S. 845 (1996); Plantz\nv. State, 1994 OK CR 33, 876 P.2d 268, 279 (Okla. Crim. App. 1994) (trial court\nproperly limited the defense's voir dire on what jurors would consider as mitigation);\nState v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 103-04, 501 S.E.2d 122 (1998) (Morgan does not require voir\ndire on specific mitigating circumstances).\n\n\n       Second, Robinson's characterization of Judge Anderson's rulings as a blanket\nprohibition on case-specific mitigation questioning is unsupported factually. Robinson\nhighlights Judge Anderson's rulings sustaining the State's objections to defense counsel's\n                                              165\n\fquestioning of Jurors 115 and 271. In both instances, the district judge prevented defense\ncounsel from asking whether certain types of mitigation would outweigh aggravating\ncircumstances and warrant a life sentence, i.e., staking out the jurors. Judge Anderson\nclarified that it was appropriate to ask panelists whether they would meaningfully\nconsider a defendant's background, for example, as mitigation, but when defense counsel\nalso asked the prospective juror to compare it to aggravating circumstances and decide\nwhether the mitigation evidence would warrant a life sentence, the inquiry improperly\nstaked out the panelists.\n\n\n       These rulings are consistent with the majority of federal and state authority. They\nalso survive scrutiny under the minority view that disclosure of and limited questioning\non highly inflammatory case-specific facts may be necessary to identify mitigation-\nimpaired jurors. See, e.g., Carasi, 44 Cal. 4th at 1285-87 (Constitutional requirements\nsatisfied where trial court discloses case-specific facts to jurors before asking if they\nwould automatically vote for life or death.). Judge Anderson allowed the defense to ask\npanelists if they would consider certain categories of mitigation, and he also allowed the\ndefense to disclose case-specific facts to panelists and inquire if they would still consider\nmitigation evidence in light of such facts.\n\n\n       Robinson relies on United States v. Fell, 372 F. Supp. 2d 766 (D. Vt. 2005), in\nsupport of his claim of constitutional error. However, Fell merely recognized that \"rather\nthan reject all case-specific questions, a trial court should allow such questions to be\nasked when they are reasonably directed toward discovering juror bias.\" 372 F. Supp. 2d\nat 771. Here, Judge Anderson did not reject all case-specific questions, and nothing in\nFell suggests the balance Judge Anderson struck in his rulings violated Robinson's rights\nunder state or federal law. See State v. Kreutzer, 928 S.W.2d 854, 864-65 (Mo. 1996)\n(court properly limited questioning on specific facts that sought a commitment from\njurors).\n                                              166\n\f       In addition to challenging the rulings on prospective Jurors 115 and 271, Robinson\nclaims the trial court improperly limited inquiry into the weight jurors would assign\nparticular categories of mitigation. Judge Anderson allowed defense counsel to ask\nprospective jurors if they would meaningfully \"consider\" certain types of mitigation, but\nhe did not allow them to ask how much weight they would assign to such evidence.\nRobinson believes such questioning was necessary because those who would assign little\nto no weight to specific types of mitigation were unqualified to serve.\n\n\n       The Eighth Amendment requires \"the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital\ncase, not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a\ndefendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the\ndefendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" Lockett v. Ohio, 438 U.S.\n586, 604, 98 S. Ct. 2954, 57 L. Ed. 2d 973 (1978). However, Robinson's argument is\npremised incorrectly on the assumption that jurors must be willing to assign some weight\nto all evidence offered in mitigation to satisfy the Eighth Amendment protections defined\nin Lockett. To the contrary, while Lockett proscribes conduct that cuts off the sentencer's\nconsideration of mitigation evidence in an absolute manner, \"[i]t does not prohibit a\ncapital sentencing jury from assessing the weight of mitigating evidence 'and find[ing] it\nwanting as a matter of fact[.]'\" State v. Cheever, 295 Kan. 229, 269, 284 P.3d 1007\n(2012) (quoting Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 113, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1\n[1982]), vacated and remanded on other grounds 571 U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 596, 187 L.\nEd. 2d 519 (2013). In other words, jurors may assign zero weight to a particular piece of\nevidence without making an error of law. We see no error in the district judge's limitation\non such questioning.\n\n\n\n\n                                            167\n\f       5. Was voir dire on prior incarcerations limited improperly?\n\n       Finally, Robinson contends the trial court erred by prohibiting voir dire on his\nprior terms of incarceration and violating his right to trial by a fair and impartial jury\nunder the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments; Sections 5, 7, and 10 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights; and K.S.A. 22-3408 and K.S.A. 22-3410.\n\n\n       To frame the issue properly, it is important to understand the procedural history\ngiving rise to the challenge. On May 31, 2002, the State filed a motion to determine the\nadmissibility of other crimes or civil wrongs evidence pursuant to K.S.A. 60-455. As part\nof this effort, the State did not seek to introduce or admit any evidence that would have\ndisclosed the fact of Robinson's prior convictions or terms of incarceration. The trial\ncourt granted the State's motion at an August 2002 hearing.\n\n\n       After Judge Anderson announced his ruling on the motion, the State mentioned it\nwas developing a strategy for introducing evidence of Robinson's relationship with\nBeverly Bonner \"without alerting the jury\" that defendant met the victim, a prison\nlibrarian, while incarcerated. Judge Anderson told the State to \"[w]ork at it real hard, be\ncreative. There's ways around these problems. If you adequately address the issue with\nyour witnesses, you can avoid those.\" These comments reflected Judge Anderson's\nposition to exclude any evidence of Robinson's prior incarcerations. Robinson's counsel\nmade no comment and never expressed a desire to inject this issue into the guilt phase.\n\n\n       The parties proceeded to jury selection and completed the first (hardship inquiry)\nand second (small group voir dire) phases without making any reference to Robinson's\nprior convictions or terms of incarceration. On October 2, 2002, the district judge began\nthe third phase of jury selection by dividing the 83 remaining veniremembers into two\nseparate panels for general voir dire. During general voir dire of the first panel, defense\n\n                                             168\n\fcounsel disclosed that Robinson had previously been incarcerated. The State objected,\nbelieving the defense was trying to poison the panel. Defense counsel argued that the line\nwas needed because it was possible such evidence could inadvertently spill over into trial.\nThe defense did not express any design or plan to introduce the subject deliberately\nduring the guilt phase. Judge Anderson expressed his displeasure with the surprise\nmaneuver, noting he had made it clear that this information was not going to be disclosed\nto jurors. The district judge provided a curative instruction to the panel members and\nmade inquiry to confirm their impartiality. Consistent with Judge Anderson's direction,\ndefense counsel did not raise the subject during general voir dire of the second panel.\n\n\n       During trial, Judge Anderson took steps to ensure that evidence of Robinson's\nprior convictions or terms of incarceration was not admitted. For example, before direct\nexamination of Robinson's parole officer, Steve Haymes, the district judge confirmed\nwith prosecutors that they would not elicit testimony regarding Haymes' job title, the\nnature of his relationship with Robinson, or his knowledge of Robinson's past\nconvictions. Consistent with Judge Anderson's position, Haymes testified only to\nRobinson's admissions regarding his involvement with Lisa Stasi.\n\n\n       On October 23, 2002, 13 days into trial, the State called Beverly Bonner's former\nhusband, Dr. William Bonner. Though William Bonner worked as the prison doctor at the\nWestern Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron, Missouri, and treated Robinson as a\npatient while Robinson was incarcerated at this facility, the State did not elicit this\ntestimony. Before cross-examination, the defense informed Judge Anderson that counsel\nintended to elicit this testimony from the witness. Robinson's counsel said that it was\nquite probable the case would proceed to a penalty phase, during which the defense\nwould introduce evidence of Robinson's prior incarcerations to prove defendant was not\nprone to violence in a prison setting. Defense counsel believed the failure to disclose this\n\n\n                                             169\n\finformation during the guilt phase would undermine the credibility of this evidence\nduring the penalty phase:\n\n               \"We want to get that evidence that he's been in the penitentiary in front of the\n       jury at the very first opportunity, otherwise it looks to the jury—otherwise, we've been\n       hiding that from them. And to have any credibility in the second part of the trial, we're\n       going to introduce this kind of testimony. I don't want jurors sitting up there thinking why\n       didn't you tell us that before [Defense Counsel] went through the whole trial with regard\n       to Dr. Bonner working in Cameron. He sees John Robinson—nothing, says nothing about\n       Robinson being an inmate.\n               \"Now, it's coming in in the penalty phase of the trial. That hurts the credibility of\n       the defense attorneys who have had the responsibility of trying to convince this jury to\n       spare Mr. Robinson's life. So that's the reasoning behind my intention to elicit this\n       testimony.\"\n\n\n       Judge Anderson confirmed that the defense was making a tactical decision in\nanticipation of a conviction and subsequent penalty phase proceeding. The defense\nconceded that the testimony regarding Robinson's prior incarceration would have no\neffect on the juror's decision on guilt or innocence and again maintained that the failure to\ndisclose it at this juncture could undermine their credibility during the penalty phase.\nJudge Anderson granted the request, and the defense elicited testimony from Dr. Bonner\nthat Robinson served time at the Missouri prison for a nonperson felony conviction.\n\n       Now Robinson argues that Judge Anderson deprived him of the right to a fair and\nimpartial jury by limiting voir dire on the topic of his prior incarcerations. Robinson cites\nno authority directly supporting his claim of a legal right to question veniremembers on\nhis criminal history or prior terms of incarceration, let alone in a situation where the trial\ncourt had made clear that such evidence would not be allowed during the guilt phase. The\nfew courts that have addressed similar challenges have rejected the notion that due\nprocess compels the court to permit voir dire on the subject. Richmond v. Polk, 375 F.3d\n\n                                                   170\n\f309, 329-31 (4th Cir. 2004) (Morgan, 504 U.S. at 729-30, does not require trial court to\nallow defendant an opportunity to ask prospective jurors if they would still consider\nmitigating factors and impose a life sentence once informed of his prior conviction for\nfirst-degree murder.); Witter, 112 Nev. at 915 (trial court properly denied defendant's\nrequest to voir dire jurors regarding prior conviction involving use or threat of violence, a\nstatutory aggravator; such questioning improperly inquired into the verdict a juror would\nreturn), abrogated on other grounds by Nunnery v. State, 127 Nev. Adv. Op. 69.\n\n\n       Aside from other jurisdictions' treatment of this issue, we also note that Robinson\ninvited the alleged error. \"'A party may not invite error and then complain of that error on\nappeal.'\" Thoroughbred Assocs. v. Kansas City Royalty Co., 297 Kan. 1193, 1204, 308\nP.3d 1238 (2013) (quoting Butler County R.W.D. No. 8 v. Yates, 275 Kan. 291, 296, 64\nP.3d 357 [2003]). Well before jury selection commenced, the district judge had made\nclear that he would not allow jurors to be exposed to any evidence disclosing Robinson's\nprior terms of incarceration. The State acknowledged the district judge's position and\ntook affirmative steps to comply with it. Robinson never objected to the district judge's\nposition. Defense counsel disclosed the fact of Robinson's prior incarceration to the first\npanel during general voir dire, but he did so out of concern that these facts might bleed\ninto the proceedings inadvertently—not because the defense had a calculated strategy to\nintroduce the subject during the guilt phase. Judge Anderson's curative instruction and\nfollow-up inquiry confirmed this panel nevertheless remained impartial. See State v.\nDixon, 289 Kan. 46, 53, 209 P.3d 675 (2009) (court's independent inquiry of jurors\nconfirming impartiality cured potential due process concerns after juror observed\ndefendant in leg shackles). The district judge's limitation on the scope of voir dire became\nan issue only after the defense changed course midstream and made a tactical decision on\nthe thirteenth day of trial to inject the fact of Robinson's previous incarcerations into the\nproceedings. By that point, the defense had recognized the likelihood of conviction and\nwas positioning Robinson for the penalty phase. Before that moment, any error qualified\n                                             171\n\fas invited. See Powell v. Commonwealth, 267 Va. 107, 144, 590 S.E.2d 537 (2004) (trial\ncourt did not err in refusing to allow defendant to voir dire jurors on subject of his prior\nconviction; jurors exposed to this information were not subject to automatic exclusion\nwhere defense counsel disclosed prior conviction; challenge barred by invited error\ndoctrine).\n\n\n       The fact that we apply a heightened reliability standard in death penalty appeals\ndoes not necessarily bar application of this doctrine. See, e.g., Nichols v. Heidle, 725 F.3d\n516, 556 n.34 (6th Cir. 2013) (invited error applied to capital defendant's issue); United\nStates v. Chandler, 996 F.2d 1073, 1084 (11th Cir. 1993) (applying invited error to\ncapital defendant's claim); Rogers v. State, 630 So. 2d 78, 84 (Ala. Crim. App. 1991)\n(\"The invited error rule has been applied equally in capital cases and noncapital cases.\"),\nrev'd on other grounds 630 So. 2d 88 (Ala. 1992); People v. Cummings, 4 Cal. 4th 1233,\n1326, 18 Cal. Rptr. 2d 796, 850 P.2d 1 (1993) (applying invited error), cert. denied 511\nU.S. 1046 (1994); Rogers v. State, 282 Ga. 659, 662, 653 S.E.2d 31 (2007) (same); State\nv. McPhail, 329 N.C. 636, 643-44, 406 S.E.2d 591 (1991) (applying invited error to\nalleged instructional error); State v. Campbell, 90 Ohio St. 3d 320, 324-26, 738 N.E.2d\n1178 (2000) (applying doctrines of invited error, waiver, and harmless error to capital\nsentencing issues); Tucker v. State, 771 S.W.2d 523, 534 (Tex. Crim. App. 1988)\n(applying invited error), cert. denied 492 U.S. 912 (1989).\n\n\n       We also regard it as significant that Robinson made no effort to voir dire the jurors\non this subject prior to the start of the penalty phase, further undermining his appellate\nchallenge. See State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, 995, 40 P.3d 139 (2001) (suggesting\ndefendant's failure to voir dire jury prior to penalty phase undermined claim that prior\nmurder conviction could have biasing effect on jurors), cert. denied 537 U.S. 834 (2002),\noverruled on other grounds by Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L.\nEd. 2d 429 (2006).\n                                             172\n\f       While we find no error, it is also worth noting that defense counsel admitted\nduring trial that evidence of Robinson's prior convictions would have no adverse\ninfluence on the jurors' verdict on guilt, which demonstrates the harmlessness of the\nasserted error. Based on the foregoing, Judge Anderson's ruling was a proper exercise of\nlawful discretion.\n\n\nDenial of Defense Challenges for Cause\n\n       Robinson next claims the district judge erred by failing to excuse veniremembers\nwho were leaning toward death, unable to presume a life sentence, and biased by\nexposure to pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       K.S.A. 22-3410(2)(i) provides that a prospective juror may be removed for cause\nwhere \"[h]is [or her] state of mind with reference to the case or any of the parties is such\nthat the court determines there is doubt that he [or she] can act impartially and without\nprejudice to the substantial rights of any party.\"\n\n\n       \"The trial judge is in a better position than an appellate court to view the demeanor\nof prospective jurors as they are questioned.\" State v. Manning, 270 Kan. 674, 691, 19\nP.3d 84 (2001), disapproved on other grounds by State v. King, 288 Kan. 333, 204 P.3d\n585 (2009). \"Challenges for cause, therefore, are reviewed on appeal under an abuse of\ndiscretion standard of review.\" Manning, 270 Kan. at 691. A trial court abuses its\ndiscretion where: \"(1) no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the judge;\n(2) a ruling is based on an error of law; or (3) substantial competent evidence does not\nsupport a finding of fact on which the exercise of discretion is based.\" State v. Bowen,\n299 Kan. 339, 348, 323 P.3d 853 (2014).\n                                             173\n\f       Additionally, in capital cases, the Supreme Court's decision in Wainwright v. Witt,\n469 U.S. 412, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d 841 (1985),\n\n       \"clarified the standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for\n       cause because of his or her views on the death penalty. The Court stated that a\n       prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of his or her views on capital\n       punishment where 'the juror's views would \"prevent or substantially impair the\n       performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.\"'\"\n       Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 991 (quoting Witt, 469 U.S. at 424).\n\n\nThe same standard applies whether the challenge was directed at death-leaning or life-\nleaning jurors. State v. Carr, 300 Kan. 1, Syl. ¶ 20, 331 P.3d 544 (2014), cert. granted in\npart 135 S. Ct. 1698 (2015).\n\n\n       Under this standard, a juror's bias need not be proved with \"'\"unmistakable\nclarity.\"'\" Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 991 (quoting Witt, 469 U.S. at 424). Given the deference\nowed to the trial court, the controlling question on appeal is not whether we agree with\nthe district judge's ruling on the challenge for cause but, instead, whether it is fairly\nsupported by the record. Carr, 300 Kan. at 114.\n\n\n       2. Did the trial court retain jurors who would impose a death sentence\n       automatically upon conviction?\n\n       Robinson claims Judge Anderson erred in denying his challenge to Jurors 33, 39,\n63, and 271 because they would vote automatically for death upon conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   174\n\f              a. Juror 33\n\n\n       Robinson argues Juror 33 testified that he would sentence a defendant to death if\nconvicted of capital murder. However, this testimony was offered in response to a far\nmore specific question that assumed the fact of a capital murder conviction, plus evidence\nof the multiple murder aggravating circumstance and no suggestion of any mitigating\ncircumstances. Viewed in context, the response reflected an acceptable assessment of the\nevidence under Kansas' statutory weighing equation in K.S.A. 21-4624(e).\n\n\n       Moreover, during the State's questioning, prospective Juror 33 shared his belief\nthat capital punishment was not appropriate in all cases and confirmed that he would\nconsider both aggravating and mitigating circumstances in arriving at a sentencing\ndecision. Juror 33 confirmed he would consider any mitigation offered by the defense and\nassign it the weight he felt it deserved.\n\n\n       In denying Robinson's motion to strike, Judge Anderson emphasized that he was\n\"considering the totality of the response\" and, in doing so, it was clear Juror 33 was\nqualified and lacked substantial impairment. Judge Anderson further observed that Juror\n33 \"adequately clarified\" to his satisfaction \"any individual remark within the totality of\nthe voir dire\" that might \"seem to indicate otherwise.\"\n\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\nSee Carr, 300 Kan. at 121 (no error in denying challenge of allegedly mitigation-\nimpaired jurors; \"selected passages from the questionnaire and voir dire responses of\nthese [challenged] prospective jurors yield cause for concern,\" but they \"eventually\nprofessed understanding of and fidelity to the law\").\n\n\n\n\n                                            175\n\f              b. Juror 39\n\n\n       Robinson challenges Judge Anderson's ruling on Juror 39 based largely on\nquestionnaire responses where she expressed a personal belief that death would be the\nappropriate punishment for a person convicted of capital murder.\n\n\n       However, after defense counsel provided a more detailed explanation of the\npenalty phase process and the jury's duty to weigh aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances, Juror 39 confirmed she would consider defendant's mitigating\ncircumstances, including his character and background, in arriving at a sentencing\ndecision. Juror 39 admitted that some of those circumstances might not outweigh the\naggravators in all instances, but she would consider them, assign them the weight she felt\nthey deserved, and balance them against any aggravators.\n\n\n       Robinson believes this testimony should be disregarded because prospective Juror\n39 did not say she would assign some weight to all mitigation evidence. Robinson's\nargument is premised incorrectly on the assumption that jurors must assign some weight\nto all evidence offered in mitigation. See Cheever, 295 Kan. at 268-70 (juror free to\nassign any weight to mitigation evidence or find it wanting altogether); see Eddings v.\nOklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 114-15, 102 S. Ct. 869, 71 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1982) (\"The sentencer\n. . . may determine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence.\").\n\n\n       Judge Anderson acknowledged Juror 39's support of the death penalty in\nquestionnaire responses but explained he would not \"consider the questionnaire to be a\nMalaysian tiger trap\" and that veniremembers were not \"experts in this arena, and they\nneed[ed] to know a little bit about the situation before their answers can truly reflect what\nthey're capable of doing as jurors.\" In light of the totality of the responses, Judge\n\n\n                                             176\n\fAnderson decided Juror 39 satisfied the test as set forth in Kleypas. The ruling is fairly\nsupported by the record and consistent with the Witt-Witherspoon framework.\n\n\n              c. Juror 63\n\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge erroneously denied his challenge of Juror 63,\nwho he believed would be a certain vote for a sentence of death upon conviction.\n\n\n       Defense counsel asked Juror 63 if he would consider \"background\" in mitigation\nof punishment. He said he would \"definitely\" consider the mitigation evidence but\nthought it would not outweigh aggravating circumstances under the facts assumed in the\nhypothetical question, which presumed a conviction for capital murder, the existence of\nan aggravating circumstance, and a vague reference to \"background\" as mitigation.\nViewed in context, Juror 63's response reflects an acceptable consideration of the\nevidence under Kansas' statutory weighing equation rather than a propensity to vote for\ndeath. See K.S.A. 21-4624(e); United States v. Hall, 152 F.3d 381, 410 (5th Cir. 1998)\n(juror's comments about leaning toward death penalty even when presented with\nhypothetical evidence in mitigation did not demonstrate substantial impairment;\ncomments merely reflected her assignment of little weight to such mitigation). Moreover,\nin follow-up questioning from the State, Juror 63 confirmed that, notwithstanding his\npersonal views, he would consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances in arriving\nat a sentencing decision.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson decided Juror 63's opinions on the death penalty were not firmly\nheld and the totality of his responses showed he was not substantially impaired. The trial\ncourt's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                             177\n\f              d. Juror 271\n\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson erroneously denied his motion to strike Juror\n271 because the juror could not envision any mitigating circumstances justifying a life\nsentence.\n\n\n       The defense presented Juror 271 a hypothetical presuming the jury had convicted a\ndefendant of capital murder and was considering aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances. Based on the hypothetical, Juror 271was asked if he could realistically\nconsider a life sentence. He said, \"Depends on the mitigating circumstances.\" The\ndefense then asked if he would be leaning toward death after conviction. Juror 271 said,\n\"That's a hypothetical I don't know. I don't lean—the statement about capital punishment,\nlife in prison pretty much speaks for itself. If I felt there were no mitigating\ncircumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances, I would vote for the\ncapital punishment, for death.\" The defense then asked him to identify mitigation\nevidence that would assure a life sentence. Juror 271 was unable to do so at the time.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson recognized that Juror 271's response was susceptible to two\npossible interpretations: (1) The prospective juror believed no mitigating circumstances\ncould ever outweigh aggravating circumstances; or (2) the prospective juror would\nmeaningfully consider mitigating circumstances but struggled under the pressure of the\nsituation to identify specific examples that would guarantee a life sentence under the\nhypothetical. Judge Anderson noted that he had dismissed jurors who provided similar\nresponses after construing their testimony in the former category. However, based largely\non Juror 271's demeanor and his collective responses during voir dire, Judge Anderson\nconstrued his testimony as falling in the latter category.\n\n\n\n\n                                             178\n\f       Robinson argues the ruling violates Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894. There the trial judge\nstruck a prospective juror who admitted that she was substantially impaired because she\ncould not vote for the death penalty, except under exceptional circumstances that she was\nunable to identify. We affirmed the trial court's ruling, reasoning that the juror's ability to\nfollow instructions on the law was dependent on whether the case satisfied one of her\n\"'very few exceptions,' a standard she was unable to articulate.\" 272 Kan. at 992.\n\n\n       The logic of Kleypas does suggest that jurors who would consider evidence in\nmitigation only in the rarest and most exceptional circumstances are substantially\nimpaired. However, Judge Anderson did not construe Juror 271's testimony in this\nfashion. Instead, relying largely on Juror 271's demeanor, the district judge found the\njuror would consider all mitigation evidence but struggled under the pressure of the\nsituation to identify specific examples that would guarantee a life sentence under the\nhypothetical. From a cold reading of the record, one might construe Juror 271's testimony\ndifferently. However, Judge Anderson was in the best position to interpret Juror 271's\nresponses, and his interpretation is fairly supported by the record and entitled to\ndeference. See Carr, 300 Kan. at 75 (reviewing courts properly resistant to second-\nguessing impartiality where trial judge's appraisal influenced by demeanor and other\nfactors not apparent from the transcript); Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 386-87,\n130 S. Ct. 2896, 177 L. Ed. 2d 619 (2010) (same). Kleypas is distinguishable, and we\nhold there was no error in this instance.\n\n\n       2. Did the trial court retain jurors who were unable to presume a life sentence?\n\n       In a similar vein, Defendant next challenges Judge Anderson's refusal to strike\njurors who allegedly leaned toward a death sentence upon conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                              179\n\f       Robinson argues the Kansas Death Penalty Act, including K.S.A. 21-4624(e),\ncreates a presumption for life, see Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 178-79, 126 S. Ct.\n2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006) (\"the Kansas capital sentencing system is dominated by\nthe presumption that life imprisonment is the appropriate sentence for a capital\nconviction\"), and therefore, those veniremembers who would not presume a life sentence\nupon conviction for capital murder were not qualified to serve.\n\n\n       Since Marsh, we have clarified that Kansas' statutory scheme does not include a\ntrue evidentiary presumption in favor of a life sentence, but instead places the burden on\nthe State at every turn in its attempt to secure a sentence of death. State v. Scott, 286 Kan.\n54, 99, 183 P.3d 801 (2008). Thus the relevant inquiry is whether these challenged jurors\nexpressed a willingness and ability to hold the State to its burden of proof.\n\n\n       At the same time, the court remains mindful that \"'[j]urors are not expected to\nknow the law prior to being properly instructed.'\" Hall, 152 F.3d at 410 (quoting\nChandler, 996 F.2d at 1103). And, a juror's response to a single inquiry, \"[l]ike a single\nstroke on a canvas, or one mosaic tile on a wall,\" is a \"small part of a larger picture.\"\nBowling v. Haeberlin, No. Civ. 03-28-ART, 2012 WL 4498647, at *27 (E.D. Ky. 2012),\nreconsidered in part on other grounds No. Civ. 03-28-ART, 2013 WL 1182515 (E.D.\nKy. 2013). It is the larger picture that determines a capital juror's qualification, and, on\nreview, the question is not whether we agree with the trial court's ruling, but instead\nwhether it is fairly supported by the totality of the prospective juror's responses. Carr,\n300 Kan. at 114.\n\n\n              a. Juror 14\n\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson erred by denying his challenge of Juror 14\nbecause this panelist said a person convicted of capital murder forfeits his or her rights\n                                             180\n\fand that a life sentence is never justified because the victim was not shown the same\nmercy.\n\n\n         These comments were personal views expressed in Juror 14's questionnaire\nresponses, completed weeks before the veniremember was informed of the mechanics of\nKansas' capital sentencing scheme and long before the trial court instructed the jury. See\nLockhart v. McCree, 476 U.S. 162, 176, 106 S. Ct. 1758, 90 L. Ed. 2d 137 (1986) (those\nwith deeply held death penalty beliefs may serve as capital jurors if \"they are willing to\ntemporarily set aside their own beliefs in deference to the rule of law\").\n\n\n         During defense counsel's voir dire, Juror 14 was asked if he could realistically\nconsider a life sentence following a capital murder conviction. Juror 14 responded:\n\n\n                 \"I think I could. I think I'd be open to whatever facts were presented and base my\n         final conclusion on that. I don't think I have anything—any preconceived conclusion of\n         what the penalty should be or what the verdict should be or anything like that. So I do\n         believe I can do that.\"\n\n\nDefense counsel told Juror 14 that his questionnaire responses suggested he would\nautomatically vote for the death penalty upon conviction, but Juror 14 disagreed, \"I don't\n. . . think I'm 100 percent settled on punishment. I do think that life in prison\nis . . . definitely a harsh punishment, also. I would say that I have not 100 percent locked\non one punishment over another punishment at this time.\"\n\n\n         Defense counsel later inquired of Juror 14's sentencing position in light of a\nhypothetical that assumed a conviction under certain case-specific facts. Juror 14\nadmitted that evidence of six murders would weigh heavily in his sentencing decision and\nthat it would be difficult to consider other sentences in light of such evidence. Of course,\n\n                                                    181\n\fdefense counsel's questions presumed the fact of six murders, evidence which directly\nsupported the existence of the multiple murder statutory aggravating circumstance.\nK.S.A. 21-4625(2) (defining purposeful killing of more than one person as statutory\naggravating circumstance). Defense counsel's hypothetical did not include any competing\ndescription of mitigating circumstances. Viewed from this perspective, Juror 14's answers\nreflected an acceptable consideration and weighing of the aggravating circumstance\nrather than an inability to hold the State to its burden of proof at sentencing. K.S.A. 21-\n4624(e) (defendant shall be sentenced to death if existence of aggravating circumstances\nis not outweighed by mitigating circumstances); see Pruett v. Commonwealth, 232 Va.\n266, 281, 351 S.E.2d 1 (1986) (juror's leaning toward the death penalty did not\ndemonstrate substantial impairment when response made \"against the backdrop of the\nworst possible scenario under circumstances which likely would prompt a similar\nstatement from other prospective jurors\").\n\n\n       Juror 14 confirmed he would consider mitigation evidence and weigh it against\naggravating circumstances when questioned by the State, and he confirmed that he would\nconsider a defendant's background specifically in response to defense questioning. After\nhaving been exposed to the rules governing capital sentencing process, Juror 14 never\nexpressed an inability to follow instructions or suggested he would shift the sentencing\nburden to the defense.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson decided Juror 14 adequately explained his questionnaire\nresponses and demonstrated his fidelity to the law. The ruling is fairly supported by the\nrecord.\n\n\n\n\n                                             182\n\f              b. Juror 33\n\n\n       Defendant again challenges the ruling on Juror 33 (challenged above as one who\nwould automatically vote for death), claiming he would lean toward a sentence of death\nupon conviction. Robinson again relies on Juror 33's response to a hypothetical question\nassuming the fact of a capital murder conviction plus evidence of the multiple murder\naggravating circumstance and no suggestion of any mitigating circumstances. As\ndiscussed in the previous challenge, his responses reflected a proper consideration of the\nevidence under the statutory weighing equation.\n\n\n       Moreover, in follow-up questioning, the prosecution detected \"some confusion\"\namongst the six panel members and provided an overview of the capital sentencing\nscheme, including the legal obligation of jurors to consider mitigating circumstances and\nassign them whatever weight they believed they deserve. With this clarification, Juror 33\nconfirmed he would consider mitigation in arriving at a sentencing decision. On balance,\nJuror 33 expressed his impartiality and willingness to follow the law as instructed. We\nsee no error in Judge Anderson's ruling.\n\n\n              c. Juror 39\n\n\n       Robinson again challenges the ruling on Juror 39 (challenged above as one who\nwould automatically vote for death), claiming she leaned toward a death sentence upon\nconviction.\n\n\n       Robinson once again relies on Juror 39's questionnaire responses that reflected her\npersonal belief that capital murder warrants a death sentence. As discussed in the\nprevious challenge, Juror 39 expressed her willingness to consider mitigating\ncircumstances after the parties explained the statutory capital sentencing process to her.\n                                            183\n\fShe also confirmed her fidelity to the trial court's instructions, including instructions to\nmeaningfully consider mitigation evidence. The ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              d. Juror 63\n\n\n       Robinson again challenges the ruling on Juror 63 (challenged above as one who\nwould automatically vote for death), claiming he leaned toward a death sentence upon\nconviction. Defendant cites the same testimony he relied upon in the previous challenge\nof this veniremember. Juror 63 confirmed he would hold the State to its burden of proof\nat trial. For this reason and the others set forth in the analysis of the previous challenge,\nwe hold Judge Anderson's ruling was fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              e. Juror 69\n\n\n       Defendant argues Judge Anderson erred in denying his challenge for cause of\nJuror 69 because the veniremember was unable to hold the State to its burden of proof.\n\n\n       Once again, Robinson relies on Juror 69's response when asked if he could\nconsider a life sentence under a hypothetical scenario. While defense counsel may have\nintended to ask the hypothetical question in the context of any capital murder conviction,\nJuror 69 assumed it was specific to this case, and he explained the burden would be on\ndefendant to give him a reason not to impose a sentence of death, given that multiple\nvictims were murdered. Later, Juror 69 confirmed he would lean toward a death sentence\nbased on facts in this case but would consider any mitigation.\n\n\n       By emphasizing the significance of six murders, Juror 69's responses revealed the\nweight he would assign the multiple murder aggravator, requiring the defense to produce\nsubstantial evidence of mitigation to warrant a life sentence. Viewed in context, the\n                                              184\n\fresponses reflect a proper consideration of the facts under the statutory weighing\nequation, not improper shifting of the State's burden to the defense.\n\n\n       Moreover, during the State's questioning, Juror 69 said he would not automatically\nsentence a defendant to death and would consider mitigation. He also confirmed that his\npersonal views regarding sentence would yield to the judge's instructions on the law.\n\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we hold there was no abuse of discretion in Judge\nAnderson's ruling.\n\n\n              f. Juror 115\n\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred in denying his challenge for cause of Juror\n115 because the juror's questionnaire and voir dire responses showed the defense would\nhave to dissuade him from voting for a death sentence.\n\n\n       In questionnaire responses, Juror 115 expressed his belief that a life sentence for\ncapital murder is only appropriate in jurisdictions without the death penalty. However,\nafter defense counsel outlined the mechanics of the capital sentencing scheme, Juror 115\nsaid he would not automatically impose a death sentence upon conviction and would\nconsider mitigating circumstances. Defense counsel continued to approach the same\nquestion from different angles, but Juror 115 stayed firm in his position, confirming that a\nperson's background and other mitigation would be relevant to his sentencing decision.\nDuring the State's questioning, Juror 115 said his sentencing decision would not be\nautomatic and he would consider and weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n       During follow-up questioning from defense counsel, Juror 115 agreed he would\nlean toward death upon conviction, even though he was willing to listen to and consider\n                                            185\n\fmitigation evidence. It is unclear from the record whether Juror 115 answered these\nhypothetical questions assuming a conviction for capital murder in the abstract, or\nspecific to this case, where the evidence would support multiple murders, arguably\nestablishing the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance.\n\n\n       While certain responses may have suggested Juror 115's beliefs on the death\npenalty rendered him substantially impaired, when viewed in their totality and with\nappropriate deference to the district judge's ability to view demeanor and nonverbal\ncommunication, we hold that Judge Anderson did not err. See State v. Carr, 300 Kan. 1,\n121-22, 331 P.3d 544 (2014) (no error in denial of challenge of jurors who said they\nwould lean toward death upon conviction where balance of record reflected jurors'\nwillingness to consider mitigation and both sentencing options), cert. granted in part 135\nS. Ct. 1698 (2015); see also United States v. Umana, 750 F.3d 320, 342-43 (4th Cir.\n2014) (no error in denial of challenge of juror who would lean heavily toward death\npenalty upon conviction where she later agreed to consider both sentencing options and\nwas not irrevocably committed to death sentence); Ramsey v. Bowersox, 149 F.3d 749,\n758 (8th Cir. 1998) (jurors who leaned toward death upon conviction not substantially\nimpaired where capable of voting for either sentencing option); Gardner v.

State, 887\nSo. 2d 929, 952 (Ala. Crim.

Commonwealth, 240 Va. 236, 248, 397 S.E.2d 385 (1990) (same).\n\n\n              g. Juror 149\n\n\n       Robinson claims Judge Anderson abused his discretion by denying the challenge\nfor cause of Juror 149, who allegedly leaned toward a sentence of death.\n\n\n       Juror 149 agreed his questionnaire responses suggested he would lean toward\ndeath upon conviction, but he explained that he answered the questionnaire without\nknowledge of the statutory weighing equation or the role of mitigation in the sentencing\ndecision. With this knowledge, he said he was confident he could realistically consider a\nlife sentence. He also noted his personal views would be subject to and limited by further\ninstructions from the court. Moreover, after the parties explained the burden of proof and\npresumption of innocence, Juror 149 expressed his willingness to follow the law,\npresume the defendant innocent, and place the burden of proof on the State.\n\n\n       During defense questioning, Juror 149 was asked if Robinson would have the\nburden to justify a life sentence upon conviction. Juror 149 said he was not familiar with\nthe process and did not know if that was how the process worked at that stage of the\nproceedings. At that point, defense counsel interrupted and cut off the response. When\nasked how strong the mitigation evidence needed to be to vote for life, Juror 149 said it\ndepended on the court's instructions. Juror 149 also confirmed that, having been informed\nof the process, he would set aside his opinions and serve impartially.\n\n\n\n\n                                            187\n\f       Juror 149's responses evidenced his adherence to the law and did not establish\nsubstantial impairment based on a refusal or inability to hold the State to its burden of\nproof at sentencing. Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              h. Juror 184\n\n\n       Robinson contends Judge Anderson abused his discretion in denying the challenge\nof Juror 184, who would allegedly shift the burden to the defense upon conviction.\n\n\n       Defense counsel acknowledged that Juror 184's death penalty beliefs were middle\nof the road. When asked whether he could realistically consider a life sentence for\nintentional, premeditated, \"special circumstances murder,\" Juror 184 said that it depended\non the trial judge's instructions on the law and that he could \"go either way.\" Juror 184\nlater said he would probably lean toward the death penalty following a conviction for\n\"this particular capital murder,\" which presumed a conviction for capital murder, along\nwith multiple murders, without any competing mitigation. As with other jurors required\nto respond to this particular hypothetical, the response reflects an acceptable\nconsideration of the facts under the statutory weighing equation rather than disregard of\napplicable evidentiary burdens. Juror 184 later confirmed he would consider both\nsentencing options.\n\n\n       Robinson highlights one of Juror 184's responses where he appeared to qualify his\nability to be impartial, saying he would \"possibly\" be open-minded. Yet, Juror 184\nfollowed up, saying that he would \"absolutely\" give consideration to mitigating\ncircumstances, he was committed to impartiality, and that he \"would be fair and honest in\n[his] decision.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                            188\n\f       Robinson also highlight's Juror 184's statement that he expected the defense to put\non mitigation evidence. Defense counsel asked, \"[W]ould you expect me to present some\nevidence to you . . . ?\" (Emphasis added.) Juror 184 responded, \"Well, yes, sir. That\nwould be your job; wouldn't it?\" Defense counsel responded, \"Well, yeah, I suppose.\"\nThis panelist's question can be read fairly to reflect a reasonable belief that counsel would\nzealously represent the defendant. Viewed in context, the comment was benign.\n\n\n       In light of the totality of Juror 184's responses, we hold Judge Anderson's ruling to\nbe fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              i. Juror 202\n\n\n       Robinson next challenges the district judge's ruling on Juror 202 because he held a\n\"mild preference\" for the death penalty in the event of conviction.\n\n\n       Juror 202 said he could realistically consider a life sentence but expressed his own\n\"mild preference\" and slight favor for the death penalty. Robinson's counsel did not\ninquire whether Juror 202 could set these personal beliefs aside. Defendant believes the\ndistrict court ruling was erroneous because Juror 202 did not affirmatively disavow this\npersonal belief on the record. However, as noted above, a venireperson is not rendered\nsubstantially impaired merely because he or she holds personal opinions regarding the\ndeath penalty. Carr, 300 Kan. at 113-14. As the moving party, defendant had the burden\nto establish substantial impairment. See, e.g., State v. Hamilton, 74 Kan. 461, 466, 87 P.\n363 (1906) (\"The presumption is in favor of the competency of the juror, and the burden\nof showing that good cause exists for the challenge rests upon the one who makes the\nchallenge.\"). Robinson failed to meet this burden.\n\n\n\n\n                                            189\n\f       Juror 202 said he had no firmly held opinions and confirmed his willingness to\nconsider mitigation evidence and both sentencing options. We see no error.\n\n\n              j. Juror 229\n\n\n       Defendant believes Judge Anderson erred in denying his challenge of Juror 229\nbecause she believed that death is the proper sentence upon conviction and that a\nwrongful conviction could be corrected by appeal or clemency.\n\n\n       In questionnaire responses, Juror 229 shared her personal belief that death is an\nappropriate sentence for those convicted of capital murder. However, after the parties\nexplained the jurors' role in a capital proceeding, Juror 229 said her views had changed\nand she would realistically consider both sentences.\n\n\n       In questionnaire responses, Juror 229 also shared her belief that a wrongly\nimposed death sentence could be corrected on appeal or through clemency. If firmly held,\nsuch an opinion provides a possible basis for disqualification. See Caldwell v.\nMississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 328-29, 105 S. Ct. 2633, 86 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1985) (death\nsentence invalid where imposed by a person led to believe the ultimate responsibility for\nsentence rests elsewhere). However, Juror 229 confirmed her ability to set these views\naside and reach a sentencing decision based on aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              k. Juror 271\n\n\n       Robinson again challenges Juror 271, claiming he would fail to honor the statutory\npresumption for a life sentence. Defendant relies on the same testimony cited in support\n                                            190\n\fof his challenge of Juror 271 on grounds that he would automatically vote for a sentence\nof death. For the same reasons set forth in the analysis of this previous challenge, we hold\nthere was no error in Judge Anderson's ruling.\n\n\n              l. Juror 298\n\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson erred by denying the challenge of Juror 298\nbased on her comment that a defendant must be remorseful to justify a life sentence.\n\n\n       In questionnaire responses, Juror 298 said life imprisonment might be preferable if\nthe person \"is really remorseful . . . and can be rehabilitated.\" Juror 298 did not foreclose\nthe possibility of a life sentence absent such evidence, however. In response to defense\nquestioning, Juror 298 said that her ability to vote for a life sentence depended on the\nevidence and that she would not automatically impose either sentence. During the State's\nquestioning, Juror 298 confirmed her willingness to consider aggravating and mitigating\nfactors, follow the court's instructions, and realistically consider both sentencing options.\nDuring follow-up questioning from the defense, Juror 298 said evidence of remorse\nand/or rehabilitation could be helpful to a mitigation case but was not required, and she\nwould consider both sentences, even in the absence of such evidence.\n\n\n       We hold Judge Anderson's ruling to be fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              m. Juror 336\n\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge erred by denying the challenge of Juror 336\nbecause she believed a life sentence should not include the possibility of parole.\n\n\n\n\n                                             191\n\f       Juror 336 shared her belief that a life sentence is a proper punishment, assuming\nthe defendant remained incarcerated for his entire life. However, when the prosecutor\nasked if the possibility of parole after 25 or 50 years would cause her to disregard the\ncourt's instructions and allow it to influence her sentencing decision, she said, \"[T]here\nare rules of law to follow. That's why we have them.\" When asked if she could commit\nherself to follow those rules, Juror 336 said, \"I would think so.\" In follow-up questioning,\ndefense counsel asked if she still had difficulty with the fact that Kansas law did not offer\nlife without parole. Juror 336 said, \"It would make it difficult, but there are rules to\nfollow.\" Asked whether she would consider the possibility of parole in arriving at a\nsentencing decision, Juror 336 said, \"I would still weigh the circumstances and there are\nrules to follow. So that is what I hope that I would base it on, yes.\"\n\n\n       The prospective juror's responses appear less than unequivocal at times. However,\nJudge Anderson, who was best positioned to observe demeanor and nonverbal\ncommunication, found no substantial impairment from the totality of her responses. We\nfind no error, particularly given the deference owed to the district judge's findings. See\nWainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 425-26, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d 841 (1985) (At\ntimes a venireperson's answers will leave a lack of clarity or ambiguity in the printed\nrecord as to his or her impartiality, and in these situations, \"deference must be paid to the\ntrial judge who sees and hears the juror.\").\n\n\n       3. Did the trial court retain panelists biased by pretrial publicity?\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred by failing to strike Jurors 23, 39, 69, 202,\n271, and 324 because their exposure to pretrial publicity rendered them unqualified.\n\n\n       Neither a juror's knowledge of the facts of the case nor preconceived opinions of\nguilt/innocence warrant certain removal on due process grounds. State v. Kleypas, 272\n\n                                               192\n\fKan. 894, 974-75, 40 P.3d 139 (2001), cert denied 537 U.S. 834 (2002), overruled on\nother grounds by Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429\n(2006). Instead, \"[t]he Supreme Court has held that the test of juror impartiality is\nwhether 'the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on\nthe evidence presented in court.'\" United States v. Wacker, 72 F.3d 1453, 1467 (10th Cir.\n1995) (quoting Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 723, 81 S. Ct. 1639, 6 L. Ed. 2d 751 [1961]).\nWith this standard in mind, we turn to the analysis of each challenge.\n\n\n                a. Juror 23\n\n\n       Robinson contends the district judge erroneously denied his challenge of Juror 23\nbecause pretrial publicity would cause him to shift the burden of proof to Robinson.\n\n\n       During defense questioning, Juror 23 said he had not formed any opinion of guilt,\nthough he would lean toward guilt if he had to decide based on the media coverage. Once\ndefense counsel explained the burden of proof, Juror 23 agreed that the State would have\nto provide the evidence and that he would comply with the trial court's instructions. Juror\n23 later disclosed that he was an attorney and, therefore, understood the presumption of\ninnocence and would acquit if the State failed to meet its burden. While Juror 23 said he\nwas interested in hearing any evidence the defense could provide to explain certain\nmedia-reported facts, he confirmed that he would comply with the trial judge's\ninstructions.\n\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                             193\n\f              b. Juror 39\n\n\n       Robinson argues Juror 39 should have been excused because she never said she\ncould entirely ignore her previous knowledge of the case or presume defendant innocent.\n\n\n       Juror 39 said that the media coverage made it seem \"the crimes that were\ncommitted were committed by [Robinson].\" Yet, she emphasized, \"[T]hat's just based on\nwhat I've read and what I've heard on the news.\"\n\n\n       Defense counsel frequently used a football analogy to gauge the veniremembers'\nexposure to pretrial publicity and opinions formed from it. Robinson's counsel would\nexplain that the 50-yard line represented a person who had no exposure and formed no\nopinions based on the coverage. The goal lines represented individuals who had been\nexposed to coverage and either had formed an opinion of guilt, on one end zone, or of\ninnocence, on the other. Juror 39 indicated that she would be on the 20-yard line toward\nthe guilt end zone in light of the media coverage and agreed that defendant would need to\npresent some information to get her back to the 50-yard line.\n\n\n       However, when defense counsel initially described the football analogy, Juror 39\ninquired, \"Are you asking if I would be open-minded?\" Defense counsel said, \"No.\"\nDefense counsel never asked if Juror 39 could set aside information obtained from the\nmedia, presume Robinson innocent, and decide the case on the evidence. After the\nprosecutor explained the burden of proof, Juror 39 confirmed she would acquit Robinson\nif the State failed to meet its burden.\n\n\n       Robinson claims Juror 39's later assurances of impartiality cannot overcome her\ninitial statements of bias under State v. Yurk, 230 Kan. 516, 638 P.2d 516 (1982). In Yurk,\nsome jury members were exposed to a newspaper report published during trial that\n                                           194\n\fdisclosed defendant's three prior convictions for crimes similar to those charged. One\njuror was bothered by the information and did not know how it would affect his\ndeliberations but eventually expressed his willingness to decide the case on the evidence.\nUnder its particular facts, the Yurk court held that the juror's later declaration of\nimpartiality was not controlling and that his exposure to such a uniquely prejudicial\nmedia report during trial warranted a mistrial. 230 Kan. at 523-24.\n\n\n       Here, defendant failed to show Juror 39 was exposed to or affected by the type of\nuniquely prejudicial information at issue in Yurk. See State v. Bowen, 254 Kan. 618, 627,\n867 P.2d 1024 (1994) (distinguishing Yurk where record did not establish extent of juror's\nexposure to media or similarly prejudicial content). Also, the fact that Juror 39 was\nexposed to media coverage before the trial, not during it, is significant. We have made\nclear that pretrial publicity alone will not established prejudice per se. State v. Deiterman,\n271 Kan. 975, 979, 29 P.3d 411 (2001). In fact, in analyzing Robinson's venue challenge,\nwe held that the published reports did not warrant a finding of presumed prejudice\nthroughout the venire. Thus, Yurk is distinguishable.\n\n\n       Instead, we find the facts more comparable to those cases where we have affirmed\na district court's denial of a challenge for cause based on a party's successful\nrehabilitation of a prospective juror. See, e.g., Carr, 300 Kan. at 121-22 (no error in\ndenying challenges of prospective jurors whose voir dire responses yielded cause for\nconcern, but all eventually professed understanding of and fidelity to the law); State v.\nRansom, 289 Kan. 373, 389-90, 212 P.3d 203 (2009) (no error in refusing to strike\nprospective juror who admitted she \"might have trouble\" presuming defendant innocent;\nprospective juror merely acknowledged difficulty in applying presumption, not inability\nto do so; deference owed to trial judge); see also Stevens v. Beard, 701 F. Supp. 2d 671,\n723-24 (W.D. Penn. 2010) (no error in denial of challenge of prospective juror in capital\n\n\n                                              195\n\fprosecution who expressed preference for death sentence but later declared fidelity to law\nas instructed; deference owed to trial judge).\n\n\n       We find no error in Judge Anderson's ruling.\n\n\n               c. Juror 69\n\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson erred in denying his challenge of Juror 69, who\nallegedly presumed defendant's guilt and shifted the burden of proof to defendant.\n\n\n       In responding to defense counsel's football field analogy, Juror 69 said he was just\non the other side of the 50-yard line toward the guilt end zone based on the media's\ncoverage and would need to hear evidence from the defense to move back to midfield.\nHowever, after the State explained the presumption of innocence and burden of proof,\nJuror 69 identified \"impartiality\" as the most important trait of a juror and confirmed he\ncould set aside any preconceived opinions and remain fair and impartial. He\nacknowledged the State's burden of proof and confirmed he would acquit defendant if the\nState failed to meet it.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n               d. Juror 202\n\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred in denying his challenge of Juror 202 because\nhe expressed an inability to abide by the presumption of innocence.\n\n\n       During defense questioning, Juror 202 said media coverage had not caused him to\nform any opinions because his memory of reported facts had faded over the 2 years that\n                                            196\n\fhad passed since the story broke. Juror 202 also said he believed in defendant's right to be\npresumed innocent.\n\n\n       Based on the totality of Juror 202's responses, Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly\nsupported by the record.\n\n\n               e. Juror 271\n\n       Defendant argues the trial court improperly denied the challenge of Juror 271\nbecause his responses showed he would shift the burden of proof from the State to the\ndefense.\n\n\n       In response to defense counsel's football field analogy, Juror 271 said he could not\nquantify where he stood on the field but confirmed it would be toward the guilt side of\nthe field based on the media's coverage. As defense counsel continued to focus on his\nfootball field analogy, Juror 271 offered the following unsolicited remarks:\n\n               \"I just think I could be impartial. I realize, and I understand that all I've heard is\n       negative information, I understand that; so going into a trial, I take that into\n       consideration. I know that I have to just pay attention to what goes on in the trial and not\n       what I've heard before. I think I can do that.\"\n\n\nIn response to this unsolicited comment, defense counsel suggested Juror 271 would still\nexpect the defense to put on evidence. Juror 271 simply responded, \"I just say I can be\nimpartial come trial time.\"\n\n\n       We have no hesitation affirming Judge Anderson's ruling in light of these remarks\nand responses.\n\n\n\n                                                    197\n\f              f. Juror 324\n\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erroneously denied his challenge of Juror 324\nbecause she could not set aside her strong opinion of guilt.\n\n\n       Juror 324 expressed a personal belief that Robinson was likely to be guilty based\non the pretrial coverage of the case. However, Juror 324 expressed confidence in her\nability to set aside her opinion and serve impartially. She expressed no concern with her\nability to presume Robinson innocent. In response to the State's questions, Juror 324\nconfirmed her ability to set aside her personal view and decide the case on the evidence,\nfollow the court's instructions, and acquit Robinson if the State failed to carry its burden\nof proof.\n\n\n       There was some confusion when the State asked Juror 324 whether she would\n\"feel comfortable\" basing her decision on information from inside the courtroom, even if\nthe State did a poor job presenting the case, and Juror 324 responded, \"No. If what I learn\nin the trial would sway me that way, I would have a hard time doing that.\" However,\nJudge Anderson's subsequent independent inquiry confirmed that she had misunderstood\nthe question and that she would not let media coverage influence her decision.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\nDisparate Rulings on Challenges for Cause\n\n       Robinson claims Judge Anderson applied a more lenient standard to the State's\nchallenges for cause, in violation of his due process rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                             198\n\f       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       \"Each party may challenge any prospective juror for cause.\" K.S.A. 22-3410(1). In\ndeath penalty cases, prospective jurors may be excluded if their death penalty views\nsubstantially impair their ability to comply with the law. State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894,\n991, 40 P.3d 139 (2001), cert. denied 537 U.S. 834 (2002), overruled on other grounds\nby Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 12d 429 (2006).\n\n\n       The Due Process Clause, which includes procedural and substantive protections,\napplies to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment. Barbier v. Connolly, 113 U.S. 27,\n31, 5 S. Ct. 357, 28 L. Ed. 923 (1884). Substantive due process protects individuals from\narbitrary state action. See Darling v. Kansas Water Office, 245 Kan. 45, 51-52, 774 P.2d\n941 (1989). Such protections apply to all state actors, including the judiciary. See Bouie\nv. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 354, 84 S. Ct. 1697, 12 L. Ed. 2d 894 (1964)\n(applying Due Process Clause to state court's unforeseen retroactive application of law).\nTo satisfy substantive due process requirements, a statute must not be applied to parties\nin an arbitrary or capricious manner. Wesley Medical Center v. McCain, 226 Kan. 263,\n266, 597 P.2d 1088 (1979). The standard applied in reviewing substantive due process\nclaims is one of reasonableness. Darling, 245 Kan. at 51.\n\n\n       2. Did Judge Anderson's rulings violate due process?\n\n       Robinson's substantive due process challenge is premised on the district judge's\nrulings on the parties' challenges for cause of Jurors 185 and 271. Specifically, Robinson\nargues that Judge Anderson's use of a more lenient standard for the State's challenges is\nevidenced by the fact that Juror 185, who strongly opposed the death penalty, was\nexcused, but Juror 271, who strongly supported the death penalty, was retained. Robinson\noversimplifies the underlying facts.\n\n                                            199\n\f       During defense questioning, Juror 185 expressed uncertainty about her ability to\nimpose a sentence of death. Attempting to rehabilitate Juror 185, defense counsel asked\nwhether she could impose a death sentence if aggravators outweighed mitigators. Juror\n185 said, \"I'd have to say no today.\" In her final remarks, Juror 185 said it would be\n\"impossible\" for her to vote for the death penalty. In granting the State's challenge, Judge\nAnderson found that \"when finally put to the test, [Juror 185] couldn't do it [realistically\nconsider both sentencing options]. The Court finds that this juror meets the test of\nWitherspoon.\" See Witherspoon v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 510, 519-23, 88 S. Ct. 1770, 20 L.\nEd. 2d 776 (1968). The finding is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n       Juror 271, in contrast, consistently said he would consider mitigating\ncircumstances, and when \"put to the test,\" he was willing to impose a life sentence in lieu\nof the death penalty. When defense counsel asked him to identify specific types of\nmitigation that would guarantee a life sentence under a hypothetical scenario, Juror 271\ncould not think of any examples. Based largely on the prospective juror's demeanor,\nJudge Anderson construed this response to mean that he could not do so on the spot, not\nthat he believed mitigation could never result in a life sentence. This finding is fairly\nsupported by the record and entitled to deference. See Carr, 300 Kan. at 75.\n\n\n       The record confirms Jurors 271 and 185 were not similarly situated because the\nformer testified he could consider both sentencing options and the latter testified she\ncould not. Judge Anderson reached different conclusions on the challenges of these jurors\nbased on their voir dire responses, not because he applied the Witt-Witherspoon\nframework inconsistently. We hold there was no substantive due process violation. See\nPeople v. Cahill, 2 N.Y.3d 14, 140-41, 777 N.Y.S.2d 312, 809 N.E.2d 561 (2003) (\"The\ntrial court did not apply different standards to each party's for-cause challenge; applying\nthe same standard, [the court] reasonably reached different conclusions about each\nprospective juror's credibility and ability to deliberate impartially.\"); State v. Frazier, 73\n                                              200\n\fOhio St. 3d 323, 329-30, 652 N.E.2d 1000 (1995) (trial court did not apply different\nstandards in ruling on defense challenges for cause; jurors dismissed could not set aside\npersonal feelings on death penalty, whereas jurors passed for cause would apply the law\nas instructed by trial judge); Hogue v. State, 711 S.W.2d 9, 17 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986)\n(no due process violation where record fairly supports the basis of comparative rulings on\nchallenges for cause.).\n\n\nRefusal to Strike Entire Panel Exposed to Juror 173's Comments\n\n       Robinson next argues the district judge erred by denying his motion to strike the\nsmall group panel exposed to Juror 173's inflammatory comments.\n\n\n       1. Additional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       The seventeenth panel during the second phase of jury selection, small group voir\ndire, included Jurors 173, 177, 180, 184, 185, and 186. During questioning from defense\ncounsel, Juror 173 made the following comments:\n\n       \"I teach at Olathe North High School, okay. We've had two former students that were tied\n       up with Mr. Robinson, one of them is Ms. Stasi who he's on trial for first degree murder\n       and the second is Paula Godfrey. He should be on trial, first degree murder and both of\n       these were young women. I just think the man's a predator. That's as I said, this is a\n       pattern that's gone on for years. This is not something—.\"\n\n\n       Defense counsel cut off Juror 173 and moved to strike the panel, arguing the\ncomments tainted all panelists because Paula Godfrey was not one of the victims\nidentified in the Complaint and evidence of Robinson's involvement in her disappearance\nwould be inadmissible at trial. The State opposed the motion, noting Paula Godfrey's\nname was in the questionnaire, the media had reported Robinson's connection to her, and\nthe defense had explored similar issues during voir dire.\n                                                   201\n\f       Judge Anderson agreed the comments were \"troubling\" but did not believe they\nwere \"going to be a factor with\" the other panel members. He recommended defense\ncounsel question the remaining panelists to assess what, if any, impact Juror 173's\ncomments had had on them. Defense counsel said he could not ask them specific\nquestions about the comments without calling attention to them but said he could make\ninquiry in a more \"general fashion.\" Judge Anderson said he would not compel defense\ncounsel to explore the impact of the comments with the other panelists but shared his\nbelief that counsel could do so without making matters worse. The district judge denied\nthe motion to strike the panel, finding that while Juror 173 had communicated a strongly\nheld personal belief, it was not unlike others the parties had explored in previous panels.\nJudge Anderson said Juror 173's comments \"came close\" but did not actually taint the\nentire panel.\n\n\n       After the ruling, the defense continued its voir dire of the panel. Though granted\nthe opportunity, defense counsel did not ask any further questions—either general or\nspecific to Juror 173's comments—exploring panelists' impartiality. Instead he shifted the\nquestioning to death penalty topics. Then the prosecution fully explored topics of bias,\npretrial publicity, and the death penalty with the panel members. During follow-up\nquestioning, the defense again limited its inquiry to death penalty topics and did not\nexplore bias, in general, or related to Juror 173's comments, in particular.\n\n\n       At the end of questioning, the defense renewed its motion to strike the panel.\nJudge Anderson denied the motion, finding the panelists' responses remained candid,\nsuggesting they were unaffected by Juror 173's comments.\n\n\n       The trial court excused Juror 173 and entertained challenges against the remaining\npanelists. Judge Anderson granted the parties' challenges of Jurors 177, 180, 185, and\n                                            202\n\f186. Robinson challenged Juror 184 based solely on his death penalty views. Judge\nAnderson denied the challenge, in the process observing that Juror 184 held no\npreconceived opinions and gave no credence to media coverage of the case. Robinson did\nnot exercise a peremptory challenge to remove Juror 184, who served as a petit juror in\nthis case.\n\n\n       2. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       \"It is generally recognized that even though individual jurors on the panel may\nhave indicated prejudice or bias that is not sufficient ground for a successful challenge to\nthe entire panel.\" State v. Ferguson, Washington & Tucker, 228 Kan. 522, 530, 618 P.2d\n1186 (1980).\n\n                 \"When improper or prejudicial remarks are made by one venireperson and heard\n       by other venirepersons during the jury selection process, we have held that 'the test of\n       juror impartiality is whether the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a\n       verdict based on the evidence presented in court.'\" United States v. Lacey, 86 F.3d 956,\n       969 (10th Cir. 1996) (quoting United States v. Wacker, 72 F.3d 1453, 1467 [10th Cir.\n       1995]).\n\n\n       Where defendant seeks to discharge the entire panel, we review a trial court's\nruling for abuse of discretion. State v. Ji, 251 Kan. 3, 9, 832 P.2d 1176 (1992) (reviewing\ndecision on untimely motion to discharge panel under K.S.A. 22-3407 for abuse of\ndiscretion); see United States v. Tegzes, 715 F.2d 505, 507 (11th Cir. 1983) (reviewing\nruling on motion to discharge panel for abuse of discretion). Deference is owed to the\ndistrict court's exercise of discretion based on its unique position to evaluate demeanor\nand other factors that are not apparent from the record. United States v. Simmons, 961\nF.2d 183, 184 (11th Cir. 1992).\n\n\n\n                                                   203\n\f       3. Did Judge Anderson err in refusing to strike the entire panel?\n\n       Robinson believes Juror 173's comments about the uncharged homicide of Paula\nGodfrey and his characterization of Robinson as a \"predator\" tainted the entire panel. At\nthis stage, however, the analysis necessarily focuses on the partiality of Juror 184, who\nwas the only member of the panel to serve on the jury. See Lacey, 86 F.3d at 969 (in\nreviewing denial of motion to strike panel, \"the partiality of the . . . jury is evaluated in\nlight of those persons ultimately empaneled and sworn, not those who are excused\").\n\n\n       Prior to Juror 173's comments, Juror 184 testified that he had not followed the\ncoverage closely, and what he did follow he viewed with skepticism. The defense chose\nnot to explore Juror 184's impartiality after Juror 173's comments. The prosecution did\nand confirmed he held no firm opinion of guilt. See State v. Stanphill, 206 Kan. 612, 619,\n481 P.2d 998 (1971) (\"When some of the jurors are not qualified, but the entire panel is\nnot affected, a motion to quash the entire panel will not lie. The court may simply purge\nthe panel by discharging those individuals not qualified.\").\n\n\n       Because Judge Anderson believed Juror 173's comments came close to tainting the\nentire panel, we are of the opinion that the more expedient course of action would have\nbeen to grant defendant's motion. However, this difference of opinion does not equate to\na finding of an abuse of discretion, particularly in light of the diligence and thoroughness\nJudge Anderson exercised in the design and implementation of his effective four-part jury\nselection process.\n\n\n       In the end, we conclude that a reasonable jurist could agree with Judge Anderson's\nruling in light of the isolated nature of Juror 173's comments; the defense's failure to\npursue curative measures, including general or specific inquiry of the panelists to assess\nthe impact of the comments on their impartiality; and defendant's failure to make an\n\n                                              204\n\faffirmative showing that Juror 184 was affected by the comments, especially considering\nhis consistent declarations of impartiality. See State v. Betancourt, 299 Kan. 131, 146,\n322 P.3d 353 (2014) (no error in denying mistrial where panelist's comment regarding\ndefendant's gang affiliation was isolated and defense failed to explore potential bias with\npanelists or request safeguards to inoculate against it); State v. McCorgary, 224 Kan. 677,\n687, 585 P.2d 1024 (1978) (no abuse of discretion in denial of motion for mistrial after \"a\nprospective juror . . . expressed a strong feeling in front of other prospective jurors that\nwhat she had read in the paper about these murders was true\"; prospective juror excused,\ntrial court admonished remaining prospective jurors, and defendant failed to make an\naffirmative showing of substantial prejudice), disapproved on other grounds by State v.\nReid, 286 Kan. 494, 186 P.3d 713 (2008); cf. State v. Plaskett, 271 Kan. 995, 1027, 27\nP.3d 890 (2001) (no error in denying request for individual voir dire of panel after one\npanelist said defendant had been accused by more than one person of sexual abuse of a\nchild; comments not based on specialized knowledge of case).\n\n\n       Robinson relies on Mach v. Stewart, 137 F.3d 630 (9th Cir. 1997), in support of a\nfinding of prejudicial error. There, defendant was charged with sex crimes against an 8-\nyear-old girl. During voir dire of the panel, prospective juror Bodkin, a social worker\nwith the State of Arizona, said sexual assault had been confirmed in every reported case\nassigned to her. Bodkin explained repeatedly that a child had never lied about sexual\nabuse in her 3 years on the job. The Ninth Circuit found the district court erred in denying\ndefendant's motion for mistrial because the prosecution's theory was dependent on the\nvictim's testimony and Bodkin essentially vouched for this witness' credibility based on\nher knowledge, training, and expertise. 137 F.3d at 633-34.\n\n\n       Mach is distinguishable. Unlike the expert who repeatedly vouched for the\ncredibility of the victim, Juror 173 made only one comment regarding his belief that\nRobinson was involved in Godfrey's disappearance. His opinion was speculative and not\n                                             205\n\fbased on any specialized knowledge or expertise. Other courts, including the Ninth\nCircuit itself, have distinguished Mach on similar grounds. See United States v. Guzman,\n450 F.3d 627, 631-32 (6th Cir. 2006) (\"Critical to the ruling in Mach was the 'expert-like'\nnature of the statements and the fact that the potential juror-'expert' vouched for the\ncredibility of the prosecution's key witness,\" factors not present in this case.); United\nStates v. Uriarte-Perez, No. 97-50579, 1998 WL 704102, at *1 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(unpublished opinion) (declining to presume taint under Mach where prospective juror's\ncomments were not based on particularized expertise and uttered on only one occasion);\nMiddlebrook v.

Ct. 2811 (2013); State v. Ploof, 141 P.3d 764, 774-75\n(Ariz. App. 2006) (distinguishing Mach where veniremembers were not experts and\nstatements did not go to heart of credibility of complaining witness), rev. denied and\nordered depublished 213 Ariz. 598 (2006); State v. Sanders, 92 Ohio St. 3d 245, 248, 750\nN.E.2d 90 (2001) (unlike Mach situation, veniremember expressed only personal\nopinions, did not speak at length, and was immediately excused for cause); Pavatt v.\nState, 159 P.3d 272, 283-84 & n.8 (Okla. Crim. App. 2007) (Mach distinguished where\ncomments isolated, not based on specialized knowledge, and State's case not dependent\non credibility of victim); People v. Arellano, No. B164562, 2004 WL 33463, at *13 (Cal.\nApp. 2004) (unpublished opinion) (finding Mach distinguishable on several grounds,\nincluding the fact that venireperson in that case had repeated comments numerous times);\nPeople v. Shupp, No. F037676, 2002 WL 31839361, at *1 (Cal. App. 2002) (unpublished\nopinion) (statements at issue in Mach went to the heart of the credibility of the\ncomplaining witness and were made by a person who was an expert in the field;\n\"[n]othing of the sort appears in this record.\").\n\n\n       Robinson also relies on Breakiron v. Horn, 642 F.3d 126, 141 (3d Cir. 2011).\nThere, a habeas petitioner argued defense counsel was ineffective for failing to take\n                                             206\n\fcorrective action after a prospective juror in a robbery case said petitioner used to \"'do a\nlot of robbing'\" as a child. 642 F.3d at 141. The Third Circuit granted habeas relief\nbecause the district court committed legal error by applying a subjective standard of\nprejudice, examining whether the jury was actually prejudiced by the comments rather\nthan applying the objective prejudice standard applicable to claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel. 642 F.3d at 146. However, the subjective standard is appropriate\nhere, as the court considers whether the juror can actually serve impartially, and the\nobjective standard of prejudice applied to ineffective assistance claims is inapplicable.\nBreakiron is legally inapposite.\n\n\nDenial of Challenges for Juror-Specific Reasons\n\n       Robinson also contends the trial court erred in denying his challenge of five\nveniremembers (Jurors 184, 298, 316, 14, and 147) on grounds of juror-specific bias\nunrelated to pretrial publicity or their death penalty views. As set forth above, we review\na district judge's denial of a challenge for cause for abuse of discretion. State v.\nMcCullough, 293 Kan. 970, 996, 270 P.3d 1142 (2012).\n\n\n       1. Juror 184\n\n       Robinson suggests Juror 184 held numerous disqualifying biases, including: (1)\nleaning toward the death penalty; (2) close affiliation with law enforcement; (3) exposure\nto Juror 173's prejudicial comments; and (4) affiliation with the prosecutor. We addressed\nthe first and third grounds above and focus the following analysis on the remaining\nchallenges.\n\n\n       During general voir dire, Juror 184 revealed that upon his retirement, he\nvolunteered in the crime analysis unit of the Overland Park Police Department from April\n1997 to August 1999, months before law enforcement began its investigation of\n                                             207\n\fRobinson and nearly 3 years before trial. As a volunteer, he ran copies, distributed mail,\nand performed other small tasks. On one occasion, Juror 184 had lunch with Officer B.J.\nHohnholt, who was on the State's witness list but did not testify at trial. Juror 184 also\nrecognized the name Bill Batt, another officer on the State's witness list who did not\ntestify at trial.\n\n\n        Juror 184 maintained no contact with the department after resigning from his\nvolunteer position. Nor did he communicate with anyone in law enforcement about this\ncase. Juror 184 confirmed that his connection to law enforcement would not affect his\nability to assess police officer testimony just as he would any lay witness testimony. Juror\n184 also disclosed that his son was a police sergeant in Kansas City, Kansas. While\nholding a favorable impression of his son, Juror 184 confirmed he would not project that\nsame impression on law enforcement officers in general.\n\n\n        Also, prosecutor Morrison thought he recognized Juror 184 as a participant of a\nweekend marriage seminar the prosecutor and his wife taught more than a decade prior.\nWhen the prosecutor mentioned this to Juror 184, it refreshed his memory and he\nconfirmed he had attended the seminar. This was the only contact Juror 184 had had with\nthe prosecutor, and he characterized their relationship as not even rising to the level of\n\"acquaintances.\" Juror 184 confirmed this would not impact his duties as a juror.\n\n\n        The court denied Robinson's challenge for cause, which was advanced solely on\nthe ground of Juror 184's affiliation with the Overland Park Police Department. On\nappeal, Robinson acknowledges Juror 184 \"denied any bias in favor of law enforcement\nor the prosecutor\" but argues that all of these circumstances \"suggest the distinct\npossibility of such bias.\" (Emphasis added.) Such speculation is insufficient to\ndemonstrate error. McCullough, 293 Kan. at 996 (party asserting abuse of discretion in\n\n\n                                             208\n\fruling on juror impartiality bears the burden of establishing it). Judge Anderson's ruling is\nsupported by the record, and we hold that no error exists.\n\n\n       2. Juror 298\n\n       Robinson suggests Juror 298's preference to hear evidence of remorse violated his\nFifth Amendment right to silence. We addressed the same remarks in connection with\nRobinson's claim that this prospective juror should have been excused due to her inability\nto presume a life sentence. Her statements about remorse and rehabilitation were largely\nrhetorical, and she confirmed her willingness and ability to realistically consider\nmitigating circumstances and both sentencing options, even in the absence of evidence of\nrehabilitation or remorse. This testimony also demonstrates that Judge Anderson's ruling\ndid not violate Robinson's Fifth Amendment right to silence.\n\n\n       3. Juror 316\n\n       Robinson believes Judge Anderson erred in denying the challenge of Juror 316,\nwho expressed the view that the justice system is corrupted by defense lawyers who\nrepresent clients they know to be guilty.\n\n\n       The questionnaire asked jurors to identify the three biggest problems with the\ncriminal justice system. Juror 316's response identified delay, loopholes, and lawyers\nwho represent clients they know to be guilty. When asked to elaborate, Juror 316 said he\nfelt that, regardless of the facts, there is an attorney waiting to take any case. Juror 316\nsaid he had no viable solutions but shared in his questionnaire the belief that the appeals\nprocess should be streamlined. The defense did not ask Juror 316 whether he could set\naside these personal views. Juror 316 expressed no firm opinion of guilt. He confirmed\nthat his sentencing decision would not be automatic, that he would consider mitigating\ncircumstances and a life sentence, and that he would comply with the court's instructions.\n                                              209\n\f       In denying the challenge, Judge Anderson found the totality of Juror 316's\nresponses demonstrated that his personal beliefs would yield to the court's instructions on\nthe law and that he would serve impartially. These findings are fairly supported by the\nrecord, and we hold there is no error. See Goss v. Nelson, 439 F.3d 621, 627 (10th Cir.\n2006) (jurors qualified where they can set aside personal opinions and decide on\nevidence).\n\n\n       4. Juror 14\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erroneously denied his challenge to Juror 14, who\nexpressed bias in favor of law enforcement witnesses.\n\n\n       \"When a venireman expresses a partiality toward police officer testimony per se—\nas a generic class—the bias of credibility contrary to the interest of the complainant-\nlitigant disqualifies service as a juror.\" State v. Draper, 675 S.W.2d 863, 865 (Mo. 1984).\nHowever,\n\n               \"[b]ias cannot be presumed solely because a prospective juror believes a police\n       officer's training and experience in observing and recounting events might make the\n       officer's account more accurate than that of an ordinary witness, provided the prospective\n       juror does not ignore differing circumstances of observation, experience, and bias which\n       may be disclosed by the evidence.\" O'Dell v. Commonwealth, 234 Va. 672, 694, 364\n       S.E.2d 491 (1988).\n\n\n       In response to defense counsel's voir dire, Juror 14 said that \"without any further\ninformation to weigh,\" he would tend to weigh a police officer's testimony more\nfavorably than that of a lay witness. Defense counsel attempted to cut off Juror 14 at this\npoint, but the following exchange continued:\n\n                                                  210\n\f              \"VENIREPERSON 14:            But, I'd be willing to look at, you know, other—\n\n              \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:          You'd try to keep an open mind?\n\n              \"VENIREPERSON 14:            Yes.\n\n              \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:          But when it comes to police officer versus not a\n                                           police officer—\n\n              \"VENIREPERSON 14:            Without anything else to weigh—\n\n              \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:          —police officer has the edge?\n\n              \"VENIREPERSON 14:            A slight edge, yes, sir.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       Juror 14's statement that he would give a \"slight edge\" to law enforcement\ntestimony over lay witness testimony, without any further information to weigh, fails to\npersuade us of his bias in this case. When viewed in their entirety, Juror 14's responses\nindicated a willingness to keep an open mind and consider factors relevant to assessing\nthe credibility of both law enforcement and lay witness testimony. In short, he expressed\nwillingness and ability to set any bias aside. His overall statements did not reflect blind\nadherence to the testimony of law enforcement officers over lay witnesses. As such,\nJudge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record, and we hold there is no error.\n\n\n       5. Juror 147\n\n       Finally, Robinson argues Juror 147 should never have been seated because he was\nexcused for cause on the first day of jury selection for failing to appear. A summary of\nthe procedural and factual background demonstrates that this challenge is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                             211\n\f       Judge Anderson conducted jury selection in four separate phases. Phase one was\ndevoted to hardship issues and began on September 16, 2002. During this phase, Judge\nAnderson called prospective jurors in panels of 60 to identify those asserting hardship.\nNearly 300 jurors were ordered to appear on day one, and a number of veniremembers\nsummoned that day were deferred to a later date. After completing hardship inquiries on\nthe first panel of 60 veniremembers, the defense moved to strike those jurors who failed\nto appear. The district judge granted the motion and ordered those jurors excused, \"with\nthe proviso that that does not relieve them from the obligation on the summons . . . .\"\nNeither Robinson, in his motion, nor Judge Anderson, in his ruling, specifically identified\nJuror 147 as one of those excused for failure to appear.\n\n\n       At the start of the proceedings the following day, September 17, Juror 147\nappeared in response to his summons. Judge Anderson commented, \"Apparently I missed\nthat,\" explaining he had Juror 147 down as a failure to appear when he should have been\na deferral. Defense counsel merely responded, \"Okay.\"\n\n\n       Juror 147 did not assert any hardship, so Judge Anderson passed him to the second\nphase of jury selection and assigned him to the seventh panel for small group voir dire on\nthe topics of pretrial publicity, bias, and the death penalty. On October 20, 2002, Judge\nAnderson called the seventh panel and observed that Juror 147 was present, explaining\nthat this prospective juror had been deferred to the second day of hardship inquiry.\nDefense counsel asked what had happened, believing Juror 147 was one of the\nveniremembers who had been excused for failing to appear on the first day of jury\nselection. Judge Anderson explained that Juror 147 had been deferred on the first day due\nto Yom Kippur, but that he appeared on the second day and was assigned to the current\npanel for small group voir dire. Once again, defense counsel responded, \"Okay.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                            212\n\f       Both parties proceeded to examine Juror 147 extensively on the topics of pretrial\npublicity, bias, and the death penalty, and both parties passed him to the third phase of\njury selection, general voir dire. During general voir dire, neither Robinson nor the State\nchallenged him. Robinson did not exercise a peremptory challenge to remove Juror 147,\nand he was impaneled and sworn in as a member of Robinson's jury.\n\n\n       Robinson fails to establish any specific grounds for error. The record does not\nestablish with any degree of clarity that Juror 147 was dismissed for failing to appear.\nInstead, it suggests he had been deferred and appeared as ordered on the second day of\njury selection. Robinson did not object to Juror 147's continued participation in the jury\nselection process and passed him for cause. \"All challenges for cause must be made\nbefore the jury is sworn to try the case.\" K.S.A. 22-3410(3). Robinson's failure to do so\nwith Juror 147 undermines his claim of error on appeal. See State v. Paxton, 201 Kan.\n353, 359, 440 P.2d 650 (1968); State v. Burden, 30 Kan. App. 2d 690, 697, 46 P.3d 570,\nrev'd on other grounds 275 Kan. 934, 69 P.3d 1120 (2002).\n\n\n       Robinson argues that after being sworn, Juror 147 allegedly committed juror\nmisconduct by bringing a Bible into the penalty phase deliberations. The question of juror\nmisconduct will either stand or fall on its own merits, and we consider this challenge later\nin the opinion. However, Juror 147's subsequent conduct as a juror does not establish that\nhe lacked qualification to serve at the time he was impaneled. We find no error in the\ndistrict judge's seating of a juror who was subjected to voir dire, passed for cause by the\nparties, and impaneled as a juror without objection.\n\n\nStrike of Veniremember Opposed to Death Penalty\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court improperly granted the State's challenge of Juror\n253 based solely on her general opposition to the death penalty.\n\n                                            213\n\f       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       Prospective jurors cannot be excused simply because they voice general objection\nto the death penalty. Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S. Ct. 844, 83 L. Ed. 2d\n841 (1985). Yet such jurors are unqualified when their views prevent or substantially\nimpair their ability to apply the law as instructed. 469 U.S. at 424. We review a district\ncourt's ruling on such challenges for abuse of discretion. State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894,\n991, 40 P.3d 139 (2001), cert. denied 537 U.S. 834 (2002), overruled on other grounds\nby Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006).\n\n\n       2. Was Juror 253 excused improperly?\n\n       The one constant in Juror 253's testimony was uncertainty. On a number of\noccasions, Juror 253 commented that after weeks of thoughtful deliberation, she simply\ndid not know whether she could fairly consider both sentencing options. Based on\nprospective Juror 253's ambiguous, uncertain, and vacillating responses, we find no error\nin excusing this juror. See Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 992 (affirming trial court's decision to\nstrike prospective juror who could not unequivocally confirm ability to impose a sentence\nof death); see also United States v. Snarr, 704 F.3d 368, 381 (5th Cir. 2013) (no error in\nstriking juror who could vote for death penalty if she \"'heard enough bad evidence from\nthe government'\"; juror repeatedly expressed uncertainty in ability to vote for death\npenalty), cert. denied 134 S. Ct. 1274 (2014); People v. Manibusan, 58 Cal. 4th 40, 60,\n165 Cal. Rptr. 3d 1, 314 P.3d 1 (2013) (no error in dismissal of juror who expressed\nuncertainty or who held opinion that vacillated as to ability to vote for death sentence);\nPeople v. Souza, 54 Cal. 4th 90, 123-25, 141 Cal. Rptr. 3d 419, 277 P.3d 118 (2012)\n(record fairly supported trial court's finding of substantial impairment where juror was\nunsure whether she could impose a penalty of death), cert. denied 133 S. Ct. 1499 (2013);\nCom. v. DeHart, 512 Pa. 235, 251-52, 516 A.2d 656 (1986) (\"We reject the notion that\n                                            214\n\fthe exclusion of jurors expressing uncertainty as to their ability to impose the death\npenalty results in the impanelling of a jury biased in favor of the prosecution.\"), cert.\ndenied 483 U.S. 1010 (1987).\n\n\n       Robinson cites Hance v. Zant, 696 F.2d 940 (11th Cir. 1983), overruled in part on\nother grounds by Brooks v. Kemp, 762 F.2d 1383 (11th Cir. 1985), in support of his claim\nof error. In Zant, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court erred in excluding\nprospective jurors where their death penalty views did not prevent them from imposing a\ndeath sentence under all conceivable circumstances. 696 F.2d at 955. The Eleventh\nCircuit based its holding on Witherspoon's footnote 21, see 391 U.S. at 522-23 n.21,\nwhich suggested that a juror is rendered unqualified for service based on his or her death\npenalty views only when such views result in an automatic and unequivocal sentencing\nresult. 696 F.2d at 955.\n\n\n       However, Zant predated Witt, where the Supreme Court rejected footnote 21 of\nWitherspoon as dicta. Witt, 469 U.S. at 421-22. Witt clarified that the appropriate\nstandard for excusal included instances where a juror's views substantially impaired his\nor her ability to serve impartially, even if it did not prevent it outright. See State v. Carr,\n300 Kan. 1, 113, 331 P.3d 544 (2014) (quoting Witt, 469 U.S. at 424), cert. granted in\npart 135 S. Ct. 1698 (2015). Since Witt, the Supreme Court has deferred to the trial\ncourt's finding of substantial impairment, even in situations where the challenged juror at\ntimes expressed a willingness to impose a sentence of death. See, e.g., Uttecht v. Brown,\n551 U.S. 1, 18, 127 S. Ct. 2218, 167 L. Ed. 2d 1014 (2007) (\"Juror Z's assurances that he\nwould consider imposing the death penalty and would follow the law do not overcome\nthe reasonable inference from his other statements that in fact he would be substantially\nimpaired in this case . . . .\"). As such, Robinson's reliance on Zant is misplaced. State v.\nGregory, 158 Wash. 2d 759, 813 n.26, 147 P.3d 1201 (2006) (Defendant's reliance on\nZant misplaced because \"it was decided before the Witt Court clarified that jurors may be\n                                              215\n\fexcused even if they are not unmistakably clear.\"), overruled on other grounds by State v.\nW.R., 181 Wash. 2d 757, 336 P.3d 1134 (2014); State v. Yates, 161 Wash. 2d 714, 742\nn.9, 168 P.3d 359 (2007) (same).\n\n\n       Robinson also cites to United States v. Chanthadara, 230 F.3d 1237 (10th Cir.\n2000), in support of his position. There the trial court excused a juror based solely on\nambiguous questionnaire responses regarding her ability to impose a sentence of death,\neven though the prospective juror's voir dire responses evidenced no similar ambiguity\nand she was not asked whether she would realistically consider a death sentence. The\nTenth Circuit held the juror was excused improperly. 230 F.3d at 1270-72. Here Judge\nAnderson did not base his ruling solely on Juror 253's questionnaire responses, and she\nrepeatedly expressed uncertainty as to her ability to impose a death sentence during voir\ndire. Chanthadara is distinguishable.\n\n\nAlleged Prosecutorial Misconduct Enhancing Jury Selection Errors\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor interfered with his exercise of peremptory\nchallenges by infecting several small group panels with misstatements of law. He\ncontends the alleged misconduct exacerbated the trial court's other jury selection errors.\n\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n       \"Appellate review of an allegation of prosecutorial misconduct requires a two-step\n       analysis. First, an appellate court decides whether the comments were outside the wide\n       latitude that a prosecutor is allowed in discussing the evidence. Second, if misconduct is\n       found, an appellate court must determine whether the improper comments prejudiced the\n       jury against the defendant and denied the defendant a fair trial.\" State v. Marshall, 294\n       Kan. 850, 856, 281 P.3d 1112 (2012).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   216\n\fWe have held that this two-part test applies to \"allegations of improper prosecutorial\ncomments during voir dire.\" State v. McReynolds, 288 Kan. 318, 323, 202 P.3d 658\n(2009).\n\n\n       2. Did prosecutorial misconduct prejudice the jury selection process?\n\n       Robinson contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by defining mitigating\ncircumstances improperly, confusing guilt and penalty phase facts, commenting on\ndefendant's future dangerousness, implying jurors could consider nonstatutory\naggravating circumstances, and misstating the proper role of jurors.\n\n\n              a. Definition of Mitigating Circumstances\n\n\n       Robinson believes the prosecution committed misconduct by suggesting\nmitigating circumstances must reduce defendant's culpability for the offense.\n\n\n       While questioning the second small group panel, prosecutor Morrison asked Juror\n23 whether he would \"be able to consider factors that tend to lessen one's guilt when it\ncomes to that stage?\" The defense objected to this description of mitigating\ncircumstances, and the district judge instructed the prosecutor to rephrase. The prosecutor\ncomplied, defining mitigating circumstances in a manner that drew no further objection.\n\n\n       Mitigating circumstances are those that lessen or diminish the moral culpability or\nblame of defendant or otherwise warrant a life sentence, and we have cautioned\nprosecutors not to argue that certain circumstances should not be considered mitigating\nsimply because they do not excuse or justify the crime. Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1103. Here,\nthe prosecutor made no such argument. Nor is it evidence he intended to offer a precise,\nlegal definition of the term in his questioning. Instead, he was attempting to gauge\n\n                                            217\n\fveniremembers' ability to consider both sentencing options. The isolated nature of the\nprosecutor's statement and his immediate corrective action demonstrate that the conduct,\neven if improper, was not gross and flagrant or the product of ill will. See State v.\nAlbright, 283 Kan. 418, 426-27, 153 P.3d 497 (2007) (prosecutor's inadvertent and\nisolated violation of order in limine was not gross and flagrant or the product of ill will).\n\n\n       Moreover, none of the six veniremembers on the second small group panel served\nas a member of defendant's jury, and the district judge properly defined mitigating\ncircumstances in his ultimate instructions. Therefore the prosecutor's statement did not\nconstitute prejudicial misconduct. See State v. Phillips, 295 Kan. 929, 945-46, 287 P.3d\n245 (2012) (Misstatement of law on completion of robbery was not reversible misconduct\nwhere jurors properly instructed, and remarks were isolated and devoid of ill will.).\n\n\n              b. Mixing Guilt Phase Facts with Penalty Phase Facts\n\n\n       Robinson suggests the prosecutor committed misconduct before another small\ngroup panel, composed of Jurors 82, 85, 87, 90, 92, and 95, when he asked Juror 82,\n\"And if I gave you a scenario of a hundred homicides, we'd be able to find differences in\nthe facts and circumstances of all of them, right?\" Robinson's counsel objected, claiming\nthe prosecutor was attempting to inject guilt phase facts into a discussion of mitigating\nand aggravating circumstances. Judge Anderson overruled the objection, noting that it\n\"presupposes that [the prosecutor's] question, which references the different\nhomicides . . . deal[s] only with the elements of the crime but not the mitigating factors\nand the aggravating factors . . . .\" The record provides no basis to construe the comments\ndifferently from the district judge's construction, and we perceive no misconduct in the\nform of the question.\n\n\n\n\n                                             218\n\f               c. Comments on Future Dangerousness\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor inquired improperly about future dangerousness in\nprison. Indeed, while questioning the first small group panel, the prosecutor said that just\nbecause somebody goes to prison does not mean that he or she is no longer dangerous.\n\n\n       While reasonable minds might dispute the reasonableness of the prosecutor's\nobservation, there is no need to do so here because Judge Anderson excused the entire\npanel based on the prosecutor's comment. None of the panelists could have affected\nRobinson's peremptory challenges or his fair trial rights.\n\n\n               d. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor suggested that the jury could consider defendant's\nbad character as an aggravating circumstance. While questioning the small group panel\nconsisting of Jurors 34, 312, 336, 337, 342, and 344, the prosecutor said:\n\n       \"Even every murder is different. People do different things for different reasons; don't\n       they? Some defendants might be more conniving than others, right? Some might be\n       smarter than others. Some might be slower than others. Some might be acting under the\n       influence of somebody else.\"\n\n\nRobinson's counsel objected, arguing that the circumstances the prosecutor had identified\nwere not all valid, statutory aggravating circumstances. The court sustained the objection\non different grounds, finding that the form of the prosecutor's question was sending a\n\"mixed message\" and instructed the panel members to disregard the prosecutor's\ncomments. Judge Anderson denied defendant's motion to strike the panel, believing any\nconfusion could be cured. The prosecutor then rephrased without objection.\n\n\n                                                   219\n\f          Robinson cites no authority suggesting the prosecutor's statements were error.\nAlso, we presume prospective jurors followed the district judge's instruction, and we\nagree with Judge Anderson that the remarks were not of the type or character immune to\nsuch curative measures. See State v. Race, 293 Kan. 69, 77, 259 P.3d 707 (2011) (we\npresume jurors comply with instructions of the court). As such, the prosecutor's\ncomments did not adversely impact defendant's peremptory challenges or his fair trial\nrights.\n\n\n                 e. Role of Jury in Sentencing\n\n\n          Finally, Robinson argues the prosecutor made comments that minimized the role\nof jurors in the sentencing process, in violation of Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320,\n331-34, 105 S. Ct. 2633, 86 L. Ed. 2d 231 (1985), and Romano v. Oklahoma, 512 U.S. 1,\n9, 114 S. Ct. 2004, 129 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1994).\n\n\n          In Caldwell, the prosecutor told the jury that its sentencing decision was not final\nbecause it was subject to appellate review. The plurality of the Supreme Court concluded\nthat such remarks, combined with the trial judge's validation of them, impermissibly\n\"minimize[d] the jury's sense of responsibility for determining the appropriateness of\ndeath.\" 472 U.S. at 341. Such a diminution of the jury's sense of responsibility, according\nto the plurality, prevented the jury from making an individualized determination of the\nappropriateness of the death penalty in violation of the Eighth Amendment. 472 U.S. at\n330-31, 340-41. Romano clarified that Caldwell proscribes \"'certain types of comment—\nthose that mislead the jury as to its role in the sentencing process in a way that allows the\njury to feel less responsible than it should for the sentencing decision.'\" Romano, 512\nU.S. at 9 (quoting Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 184 n.15, 106 S. Ct. 2464, 91 L.\nEd. 2d 144 [1986]).\n\n\n                                                 220\n\f                     (i). Comments before the Ninth Panel\n\n\n       Robinson argues two prosecutorial comments during voir dire of the ninth small\ngroup panel, consisting of Jurors 312, 337, 336, 342, 344, and 347, violated Caldwell.\n\n\n       First, while explaining a capital sentencing jury's duty to consider and weigh\naggravating and mitigating circumstances, prosecutor Morrison commented, \"Because\nunder Kansas law, the death penalty can only be recommended by the jury if the\naggravating factor or factors outweigh any mitigating factors that are found to exist.\"\n(Emphasis added.) The second comment concerns the following statement that Robinson\nattributes to Morrison: \"If a person is found guilty, he receives the death penalty,\nsentence has been carried out with the death penalty on appeal to provide a safety net so\nwe don't have wrongful kinds of things.\" The defense lodged no objections.\n\n\n       As discussed below, the prosecutor's use of the term \"recommended\" is consistent\nwith the statutory language used to describe a capital jury's sentencing decision. Also, the\nisolated statement, made weeks before the jury was instructed on the capital sentencing\nprocess, was not gross and flagrant or the product of ill will. See State v. Williams, 299\nKan. 509, 540, 324 P.3d 1078 (2014). As to the second challenged statement, a careful\nreading of the record suggests prosecutor Morrison, who was questioning Juror 344 at the\ntime, was actually reading or summarizing the veniremember's questionnaire response,\nnot explaining the sentencing process to veniremembers. In other words, the challenged\nstatement is not properly attributed to the prosecutor. These remarks did not affect\nRobinson's peremptory challenges or fair trial rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                            221\n\f                     (ii). Comments before the Seventeenth Panel\n\n\n       Robinson also highlights comments the prosecutor made while examining the\nseventeenth panel. Before questioning these five veniremembers on their death penalty\nviews, prosecutor Morrison provided them with an overview of the sentencing process,\nexplaining that the jury arrives at a sentencing decision by \"considering aggravating\ncircumstances\" and \"mitigating circumstances . . . and weighing those and after\nconsidering those making a recommendation of whether the defendant should get the\ndeath penalty or whether the defendant should serve life . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's use of the term \"recommendation\" to\ndescribe the jury's sentencing decision, arguing it violated Caldwell. The district judge\ndenied defendant's motion to strike the panel but instructed panel members to disregard\nthe prosecutor's comments. The prosecutor rephrased, clarifying that the jury would\ndecide the sentence, either a life term or death.\n\n\n       The prosecutor's use of the term \"recommendation\" does not violate Caldwell or\nconstitute an improper statement of the law in this instance. In Caldwell, the prosecutor's\ncomments \"were quite focused, unambiguous, and strong.\" 472 U.S. at 340. In contrast,\nMorrison used one purportedly objectionable word, \"recommendation,\" on a single\noccasion before this small group panel. The prosecutor's use of the term\n\"recommendation\" did not unambiguously and forcefully diminish the jury's role in the\nsentencing decision. Ingram v. State, 779 So. 2d 1225, 1276 (Ala. Crim. App. 1999) (trial\ncourt's reference to jury's capital sentencing verdict as a \"recommendation\" did not\nviolate Caldwell), aff'd sub nom. Ex parte Ingram, 779 So. 2d 1283 (Ala. 2000). In fact,\nthe Kansas Legislature used the same word to describe the jury's sentencing verdict under\nour capital sentencing scheme. K.S.A. 21-4624(e) (\"The jury, if its verdict is a unanimous\nrecommendation of a sentence of death, shall designate in writing . . . the statutory\n                                             222\n\faggravating circumstances which it found beyond a reasonable doubt.\"). The legislature's\nuse of the term \"recommendation\" accurately describes the jury's sentencing verdict\nbecause K.S.A. 21-4624(f) requires the trial court to review any jury verdict imposing a\nsentence of death to decide whether the sentence is supported by the evidence. See Hicks\nv. Collins, 384 F.3d 204, 223 (6th Cir. 2004) (Because Ohio law \"requires a separate,\npost-recommendation finding by the trial judge confirming the jury's sentence, this court\nhas held that casting the jury's decision as a 'recommendation' is not an inaccurate\nstatement of Ohio law and therefore does not violate Caldwell.\").\n\n\n       Even if the comments had been improper, the district judge's curative instruction\nand the prosecutor's clarification of the jurors' role prevented interference with\ndefendant's right to exercise peremptory challenges and ruled out prejudice to his fair trial\nrights. See Romano, 512 U.S. at 9 (instructions that \"emphasized the importance of the\njury's role\" diminished the type of prejudice created in Caldwell).\n\n\n                       (iii). Comments before the Twenty-seventh Panel\n\n\n       Prosecutor Morrison used the word \"recommend\" in describing the sentencing\ndecision of the jury in comments made to the twenty-seventh small group panel.\nRobinson objected immediately, and Morrison said, \"Judge, honest misstatement. I'll be\nhappy to rephrase.\" The trial judge delivered the following curative instruction:\n\n       \"Members of the panel, Mr. Morrison, in his questions, used the word 'recommend.' I\n       want to make it clear to the panel that it will be the jury's determination what the sentence\n       is, and it will not be a recommendation.\"\n\n\nAfter the instruction, the prosecutor commented, \"Thank you Judge. I apologize. I\nmisspoke. It is not a recommendation. It is for you to determine. When we get to that\nphase, jury determines death penalty or life sentence. Everybody with me?\" None of the\n\n                                                   223\n\fpanelists expressed any uncertainty or confusion. For the same reasons outlined above,\nMorrison's use of the term \"recommend\" did not violate Caldwell in this instance.\n\n\n       In the end, the prosecutor's voir dire comments did not interfere with defendant's\nright to exercise peremptory challenges or otherwise prejudice his fair trial rights.\n\n\nTrial Court's Use of an Anonymous Jury Selection Procedure\n\n       Robinson next contends that Judge Anderson's use of a juror numbering system to\nidentify veniremembers and those seated as jurors was unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\n\n       1. Additional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       In June 2002, Judge Anderson entered a written order outlining the court's rules\nfor handling juror questionnaires. Therein, he ordered that the \"identities and addresses of\nthe jurors\" be maintained in strict confidence among the parties and that \"[a]ll jurors will\nbe assigned a unique number which will be used to identify them throughout voir dire\nand the course of the trial.\" While prospective jurors were identified only by number to\nthe public, their identities were known to the parties, and each prospective juror's name\nand address was disclosed in the questionnaire.\n\n\n       Robinson did not object to the use of juror numbers. In fact, he was a proponent of\nthe system. In opposing Judge Anderson's initial decision to sequester the jury for the\nduration of trial, Robinson argued, in part, that other measures, including a juror\nnumbering system, could accomplish the same objectives with less intrusion. At a\nSeptember 2002 motions hearing, both parties agreed that it was unnecessary to sequester\nthe jury in light of these less intrusive measures. Based on the parties' agreement, Judge\nAnderson ordered the jury sequestered during deliberations only.\n\n                                             224\n\f       After selecting the jury, Judge Anderson delivered admonitions and explained why\njurors would be identified by number:\n\n               \"Now, I want to explain to you a little bit about procedurally how we're going to\n       . . . handle things. Even though you're not going to be sequestered, we're going to be\n       helping you in following these admonitions; and you've all gotten the numbers, and we've\n       been using numbers rather than names.\n               \"I want to assure you that you should not be concerned for your safety. That's not\n       the reason that we're using the numbers, okay? The reason that we're using the numbers is\n       that we want to make sure that your integrity is preserved while you're serving as jurors\n       on this case and to help in these admonitions so that we don't have to sequester you in the\n       evening hours and on the weekends.\"\n\n\n       Judge Anderson continued:\n\n               \"Now, this is designed to prevent you from being exposed inadvertently or\n       against your will by anyone that might want to impose themselves upon you during the\n       pendency of the case with respect to the admonition issues; overzealous media persons,\n       for example, and I don't mean to single out the media, but that's just an example.\n       Overzealous anybody that might try to give you their views of the case. And we want to\n       try to avoid that. Does everybody understand that's why we're doing these things?\"\n\n\nNo juror expressed confusion as to the purpose of the juror numbering system.\n\n\n       2. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       We have identified a two-part balancing test for analyzing the propriety of a\ndistrict court's use of an anonymous jury identification system.\n\n       \"First, there must be a reason to protect the jurors from identification. This decision will\n       be left to the trial court's discretion. Second, the court must take reasonable precautions to\n       minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant. A neutral explanation should be given,\n\n                                                   225\n\f       and the jury should be instructed that the use of numbers instead of names should in no\n       way be interpreted as a reflection of the defendant's guilt or innocence.\" State v. Brown,\n       280 Kan. 65, 74, 118 P.3d 1273 (2005).\n\n\n       3. Was Judge Anderson's juror numbering system improper?\n\n       Robinson contends the anonymous jury selection procedure violated Kansas law\nand his due process right to the presumption of innocence. As a preliminary matter, it\nshould be clarified that Judge Anderson did not use an anonymous jury selection\nprocedure in the true sense of that word, where juror identities are withheld from the\npublic and parties alike. Both the district judge and the parties knew the identity of each\nprospective juror. See State v. Yates, No. 89,938, 2004 WL 795906, at *3 (Kan. App.\n2004) (unpublished opinion) (jury selection not truly anonymous where jurors names\nincluded on questionnaires but kept confidential to public), rev. denied 278 Kan. 852\n(2004); see also United States v. Johnson, 354 F. Supp. 2d 939, 956 (N.D. Iowa 2005)\n(where jurors' identities known by parties, procedure \"might be described as 'innominate,'\nrather than 'anonymous'\"), aff'd in part 495 F.3d 951 (8th Cir. 2007).\n\n\n       The distinction is important because where, as here, the identity of jurors is known\nto the parties, but withheld from the public, defendant cannot claim the procedure\ninterfered with a meaningful opportunity to voir dire the venire. See Brown, 280 Kan. at\n72-75. However, \"there remains the concern that the trial court's order negatively\nimpacted [defendant's] constitutional right to the presumption of innocence.\" 280 Kan. at\n72-73. To determine whether the juror number system appropriately balanced the court's\ninterest in protecting jurors' identities with defendant's right to a fair trial, we apply the\nBrown balancing test, considering whether Judge Anderson had \"a reason to protect the\njurors from identification\" and whether he took \"reasonable precautions to minimize any\nprejudicial effects on the defendant.\" 280 Kan. at 74.\n\n\n                                                   226\n\f              a. Reason to Protect Jurors from Identification\n\n\n       While safety concerns motivated the trial court's decision to use a juror number\nsystem in Brown, we also recognized that several other factors could justify use of such\nprocedures, including that extensive publicity \"'could enhance the possibility that jurors'\nnames would become public and expose them to intimidation and harassment.'\" 280 Kan.\nat 72 (identifying five common factors, including invasion of privacy from media);\nUnited States v. Krout, 66 F.3d 1420, 1427 (5th Cir. 1995) (same).\n\n\n       Judge Anderson identified the potential for invasion of juror privacy by the media\nor other overzealous individuals with an interest in the outcome of the proceedings,\nparticularly in the absence of sequestration, as the reason for using the juror numbering\nsystem. The concern for juror privacy was well founded. Defendant's own venue study\nconfirmed the media's coverage of the case was probably unprecedented in Johnson\nCounty. Judge Anderson's concern for juror privacy was also genuine. He initially\nordered the jury to be sequestered for the duration of trial to protect jurors from such\nintrusions. At the defense's urging, the district judge ultimately utilized the juror\nnumbering system and other protective measures in lieu of sequestration. The record\nconfirms Judge Anderson's concerns about invasion of juror privacy were reasonably\nsupported by the totality of the circumstances. The trial court asserted a proper reason for\nusing a juror numbering system, satisfying the first prong of Brown's two-part balancing\ntest. See Johnson, 354 F. Supp. 2d at 956 (extensive media publicity justified use of juror\nnumbers to protect jurors' privacy and limit their exposure to extrajudicial information).\n\n\n       Robinson suggests there was no evidence jurors needed such protection. The\nargument is wholly unpersuasive in light of the appellant's venue study, venue challenge\non appeal, and the arguments the defense advanced at trial in opposition to sequestration,\nincluding its support for the juror numbering system in lieu of sequestration. We defer to\n                                             227\n\fthe trial court's discretion regarding the need to protect juror privacy in this case. See\nBrown, 280 Kan. at 74 (whether reasons exist to protect juror identity is an issue \"left to\nthe trial court's discretion\"); see also United States v. Peoples, 250 F.3d 630, 635 (8th Cir.\n2001) (district court has wide discretion to require use of numbers for identification in\nany case).\n\n              b. Reasonable Precautions to Minimize Prejudice\n\n       As to the second prong of the Brown balancing test, it is clear Judge Anderson was\ncognizant of and took steps to avoid prejudicial inferences associated with the use of\njuror numbers. He provided jurors with a neutral explanation for the numbering system,\nexplaining that it protected jurors from corrupting influences that could result from public\ndisclosure of juror identities. Also, he expressly informed jurors that the procedure was\nunrelated to any security threat or juror safety. This explanation adequately protected\nRobinson's due process rights. See United States v. Paccione, 949 F.2d 1183, 1193 (2d\nCir. 1991) (no prejudice from juror numbers where court instructed jury at outset of trial\nthat precautions designed to protect jury from contact by the media); United States v.\nThomas, 757 F.2d 1359, 1365 (2d Cir. 1985) (\"the explanation that jurors were not to\nreveal their names to protect them from the press substantially avoided any risk of\naspersions on the defendants\"); State v. Flournoy, 535 N.W.2d 354, 362 (Minn. 1995)\n(trial court minimized prejudicial inferences by informing jurors that purpose of\nanonymity was to guard against extensive trial publicity), cert. denied 516 U.S. 1140\n(1996).\n\n\n       We recognize Judge Anderson did not affirmatively instruct jurors to draw no\nadverse inferences of guilt or innocence based on the use of juror numbers. In Brown, we\nfound such an instruction was necessary under the facts because the defendant's tactics of\nfear and intimidation were a predominant theme throughout the State's case and served as\n\n                                             228\n\fthe impetus for the use of juror numbers in the first instance. 280 Kan. at 67-70, 74. Here\nthe facts did not necessitate such instruction. Judge Anderson's neutral explanation for the\nuse of the procedure combined with his express statement that it was unrelated to any\nconcern for juror safety properly balanced jurors' interest in privacy against defendant's\ndue process interests. See United States v. Darden, 70 F.3d 1507, 1533 (8th Cir. 1995)\n(no violation of fair trial rights where court \"told the venirepersons that they were being\nidentified by numbers rather than their names so that members of the media would not\nask them questions\"; explanation provided a reasonable safeguard against undue\nprejudice); Perez v. People, 302 P.3d 222, 226 (Colo.) (use of juror numbers did not\nundermine presumption of innocence where intended to protect privacy and nothing\nsuggested defendant's guilt or dangerousness), cert. denied 134 S. Ct. 256 (2013); People\nv. Williams, 241 Mich. App. 519, 524, 616 N.W.2d 710 (2000) (use of juror numbers did\nnot undermine presumption of innocence where nothing suggested practice was unique to\ndefendant); cf. State v. Bowles, 530 N.W.2d 521, 529-31 (Minn. 1995) (use of juror\nnumbers does not inherently create inference of guilt contrary to the constitutional\npresumption of innocence).\n\n\n       The record supports Judge Anderson's use of a juror numbering system under the\ntwo-part Brown balancing test, and we find no error.\n\n\n      5. SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE OF COMMON SCHEME OR COURSE OF CONDUCT\n\n       Under Counts II and III of the Fourth Amended Complaint, Robinson was charged\nwith and tried for capital murder under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), which defines the offense\nto include the \"intentional and premeditated killing of more than one person as a part of\nthe same act or transaction or in two or more acts or transactions connected together or\nconstituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct.\" The counts were identical\nin charging the murder of a principal victim as \"one of multiple acts or transactions\n\n                                            229\n\fconstituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct in which other human beings\nwere killed in a premeditated and intentional manner, to-wit: Beverly J. Bonner, Sheila\nFaith, Debbie Faith and Lisa Stasi.\" Count II charged Suzette Trouten as the principal\nvictim and Count III charged Izabela Lewicka as the principal victim.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       Robinson advances two arguments challenging the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting his capital murder convictions. First, he contends the evidence failed to\nestablish a \"common scheme or course of conduct\" as the phrase should be construed\nunder K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). Second, he argues the State cannot rely on murders that\noccurred prior to the effective date of the capital murder statute to prove the multiple\nmurders required under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\n\n\n       To the extent Robinson's arguments compel us to construe K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6),\nwe exercise unlimited review. State v. Ortega-Cadelan, 287 Kan. 157, 164, 194 P.3d\n1195 (2008). In assessing whether sufficient evidence supported his convictions under a\nproper construction of this section, we determine \"whether, after review of all the\nevidence, examined in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the appellate court is\nconvinced a rational factfinder could have found the defendant guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt. [Citations omitted.]\" State v. Scott, 285 Kan. 366, 372, 171 P.3d 639\n(2007).\n\n\nDid the State's evidence establish a common scheme or course of conduct?\n\n       Robinson argues the State was obligated to prove that every killing alleged in each\ncapital count was part of that count's common scheme or course of conduct and that the\nState's evidence failed to do so as a matter of law under his interpretation of that phrase.\nTo resolve the challenge, we must construe the meaning of the phrase \"common scheme\n                                             230\n\for course of conduct\" under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) and decide if the State's evidence was\nsufficient to establish the same.\n\n       In an effort to define common scheme or course of conduct, Robinson examines\ncharacteristics or factors present in other cases found to satisfy the requirements of\nK.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) and attributes to them the status of legal requirements prerequisite\nto such a finding. For example, Robinson cites State v. Harris, 284 Kan. 560, 162 P.3d 28\n(2007), where we discussed the \"common scheme or course of conduct\" requirement in\nanalyzing the unit of prosecution for multiplicity purposes under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\nIn interpreting the unit of prosecution for capital murder, we stated:\n\n\n               \"The plain and unambiguous language of K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) defines capital\n       murder as multiple first-degree murders, i.e., the 'intentional and premeditated killing of\n       more than one person.' The statute also requires that the multiple killings be related to\n       one another in some way, that they occur 'as a part of the same act or transaction,' or 'in\n       two or more acts . . . connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or\n       course of conduct.' K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\" (Emphasis added.) 284 Kan. at 572.\n\n\n       We found the circumstances demonstrated the existence of a common scheme or\ncourse of conduct, finding:\n\n\n               \"Defendant's conduct certainly satisfies this statutory definition. The stipulated\n       facts demonstrate that he was complicit in four intentional and premeditated killings,\n       despite the ultimate dismissal of one capital count. The three murders on which he stands\n       convicted were connected together and constituted parts of a single course of conduct.\n       The evidence demonstrates that they all occurred within a short span of time and were\n       designed to avenge an earlier battery of [his codefendant's] mother.\" (Emphasis added.)\n       284 Kan. at 572.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   231\n\f       Robinson seizes upon this language and the court's reliance on the \"short span of\ntime\" and common revenge motive to argue that Harris dictates against finding a\ncommon scheme or a course of conduct in the absence of such evidence.\n\n\n       The argument is logically flawed. Harris does not require a short time span or a\ncommon motive to establish a common scheme or course of conduct. The only\nrequirement Harris recognizes is that the murders be \"related to one another in some\nway.\" The common motive and short time between criminal acts merely happened to be\nthe factors showing the relatedness of the murders in Harris. They were not conditions\nprecedent for the existence of a common scheme or course of conduct in any case\ncharged under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\n\n\n       Employing similarly flawed logic, Robinson reviews other cases in which our\ncourt has examined the terms \"common scheme\" or \"course of conduct\" in other contexts,\ndistinguishing those cases factually from his own, and arguing the specific factual\ncharacteristics of those cases established prerequisites for the legal conclusion. For\ninstance, he relies on State v. Spain, 263 Kan. 708, 953 P.2d 1004 (1998), to argue that a\ncourse of conduct cannot encompass crimes separated by several hours.\n\n\n       In Spain, we examined whether the facts supported the existence of the\naggravating circumstance alleged by the State, which required proof that defendant\nknowingly or purposely created a great risk of death to more than one person. We\ndetermined that the statutory aggravator required a direct relationship between the great\nrisk of death thrust upon the second victim and the homicide of the first victim. 263 Kan.\nat 718. We reversed the district court, stating:\n\n\n       \"The risk need not be contemporaneous with the homicide, but it must occur in the course\n       of committing the charged murder. In the present case, a period of time that included\n\n                                                  232\n\f       Spain's escaping from jail, shooting Powell, and kidnapping Briles might more precisely\n       be termed a series of discrete transactions or events than one course of conduct. Although\n       the events were loosely connected in that each figured in Spain's escape, they are too\n       remote from one another in time, distance, and nature to be characterized as a course of\n       conduct. The murder of Powell was completed long before Briles was kidnapped in\n       Colorado. Thus, the trial court erred in finding that the risk of death to Briles was an\n       aggravating circumstance in the murder of Powell.\" (Emphasis added.) 263 Kan. at 718.\n\n\n       Robinson relies on Spain to argue that a course of conduct cannot include acts that\nare \"remote from one another in time, distance, and nature.\" Again, Robinson's argument\nis flawed. First, the aggravating circumstance at issue required a direct relationship\nbetween the murder and the risk of death to another. Harris, on the other hand, provides\nthat K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) requires only that the multiple murders \"be related to each\nother in some way.\" Second, in Spain we did not define \"course of conduct.\" We merely\nused the phrase in the process of determining the meaning of the statutory aggravating\ncircumstance.\n\n\n       Likewise, Robinson relies on authority construing Kansas' joinder statute, which\nallows the State to join offenses in a single complaint under a variety of circumstances,\nincluding where the crimes are based on \"two or more acts or transactions connected\ntogether or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan,\" K.S.A. 22-3202(1), to argue\nthe phrase \"common scheme\" requires the crimes be motivated by a single identifiable\ngoal. See State v. Woods, 250 Kan. 109, 117-18, 825 P.2d 514 (district court did not err in\njoining two separate complaints into one where there were \"factual relationships\"\nbetween the charges), cert. denied 506 U.S. 850 (1992); State v. Hanks, 236 Kan. 524,\n533, 694 P.2d 407 (1985) (charges arising from two separate sexual attacks on the victim\nin her home, one in July and one in November, could be joined properly where they\ninvolved same victim, same defendant, occurred in same locale, and acts charged were of\nsimilar character), superseded by statute on other grounds as stated in State v. Borthwick,\n\n                                                   233\n\f255 Kan. 899, 916, 880 P.2d 1261 (1994). However, neither Woods nor Hanks held that a\nsingle identifiable goal or motive of the defendant was a prerequisite to finding a\ncommon scheme. In fact, Hanks identifies a number of other characteristics such as the\nsame victim, the same jurisdiction, and similar acts and crimes to further its conclusion\nthat the crimes were related.\n\n\n       While we have not expressly defined \"common scheme or course of conduct\"\nunder K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), we have examined its meaning. In State v. Gleason, 299\nKan. 1127, 329 P.3d 1102 (2014), cert. denied 135 S. Ct. 1698 (2015), defendant argued\nthere was insufficient evidence of a common scheme or course of conduct to support his\ncapital murder conviction. Reiterating the Harris standard, we stated:\n\n\n               \"Here, the State was required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt . . . the killings\n       were part of the same act or transaction or two or more connected transactions. . . .\n               \"This element 'requires that the multiple killings be related to one another in\n       some way, that they occur \"as a part of the same act or transaction,\" or \"in two or more\n       acts . . . connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\n       conduct.\"' State v. Harris, 284 Kan. 560, 572, 162 P.3d 28 (2007) (quoting K.S.A. 21-\n       3439[a][6]). Although Gleason's argument as to this issue is murky, he seems to suggest\n       that there is no evidence the murders are related because there is no evidence he and\n       Thompson talked about killing Wornkey or that Thompson knew Gleason intended to kill\n       Wornkey, and no evidence he and Thompson talked about killing Martinez on the way to\n       Great Bend or that Gleason knew Thompson intended to shoot Martinez.\n               \"But this argument ignores our standard of review, which requires us to view the\n       evidence in the light most favorable to the State. Here, the State presented evidence that\n       Gleason and Thompson armed themselves and drove to Great Bend to 'bring some\n       intimidation' to Martinez based on their mutual belief Martinez had talked to police about\n       the Elliott robbery—a robbery in which Thompson and Gleason participated. Thompson\n       parked across the street from Martinez' house; and when Martinez and Wornkey arrived\n       home, Thompson watched as Gleason approached Wornkey's Jeep and shot and killed\n       Wornkey, wounding Martinez. Gleason and Thompson then kidnapped Martinez and\n                                                   234\n\f       took her to a rural location where Thompson strangled, shot, and killed her. Viewing this\n       evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we are convinced a rational jury could\n       have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the murders of Martinez and Wornkey were\n       sufficiently related to support the capital murder charge.\" Gleason, 299 Kan. at 1150-51.\n\n\n       Contrary to Robinson's attempts to narrow and compartmentalize the meaning and\nscope of a common scheme or course of conduct under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), in Gleason,\nwe again required only that the multiple murders be related to one another in some way.\n\n\n       Moreover, in reviewing the evidence in Gleason, we did not point to any particular\ncharacteristics of the murders, i.e., common motive, short span of time, or similar modus\noperandi, in concluding that a rational jury could have found the murders sufficiently\nrelated to satisfy the statutory element. In fact, we rejected defendant's argument that the\ntwo murderers must have conspired to commit both murders for them to be sufficiently\nrelated to establish a common scheme or course of conduct.\n\n\n       Robinson fails to show a legal definition of the terms that would justify taking the\nissue from the jury. The State presented ample evidence that Robinson lured his victims\nwith promises of financial gain, employment, or travel; exploited them sexually or\nfinancially; used similar methods to murder and dispose of their bodies; and used\ndeception to conceal the crimes, including phony letters and e-mails to victims' friends\nand family members. While no two of the victims or their murders were identical, they\nare not required to be. Simply put, there was ample evidence from which the jurors could\nhave found that all of the murders were related to one another in some way and therefore\npart of a common scheme or course of conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  235\n\fCan conduct that straddles the date of enactment of the capital murder statute support\ndefendant's capital murder convictions?\n\n       Robinson next argues that K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) does not apply to murders that\noccurred prior to July 1, 1994, the effective date of the statute. The State failed to prove\nthat the murders of Lisa Stasi, Sheila and Debbie Faith, and Beverly Bonner occurred\nafter July 1, 1994, and, therefore, Robinson argues, his capital murder convictions must\nbe vacated.\n\n\n       Whether K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) applies to a common scheme or course of conduct\nthat straddles in time the date of enactment requires us to interpret the legislative act.\n\n\n               \"The most fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the intent of the\n       legislature governs if that intent can be ascertained. State v. Arnett, 290 Kan. 41, 47, 223\n       P.3d 780 (2010). But if a statute is plain and unambiguous, this court will not speculate\n       about legislative intent or turn to canons of construction or legislative history. State v.\n       Coman, 294 Kan. 84, 92, 273 P.3d 701 (2012).\" State v. Reese, 300 Kan. 650, 653, 333\n       P.3d 149 (2014).\n\n\n       Generally, a statute will operate only prospectively unless the legislature indicates\nby clear language that it is intended to operate retroactively. Gleason, 299 Kan. at 1157;\nState v. Wells, 297 Kan. 741, 761, 305 P.3d 568 (2013); State v. Jaben, 294 Kan. 607,\n612-13, 277 P.3d 417 (2012).\n\n\n       K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) sets out the definition of capital murder relevant here,\nproviding:\n\n\n               \"(a) Capital murder is the:\n               ....\n\n\n\n                                                    236\n\f               (6) intentional and premeditated killing of more than one person as a part of the\n       same act or transaction or in two or more acts or transactions connected together or\n       constituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct.\"\n\n\n       From this language we can ascertain at least two separate elements that must be\nmet before this iteration of capital murder has been committed. The first element of the\ncrime requires intentional and premeditated killing of more than one person. The second\nelement requires that these killings be part of the same act or transaction or multiple acts\nor transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\nconduct. K.S.A. 21-3106(6) provides: \"An offense is committed either when every\nelement occurs, or, if a legislative purpose to prohibit a continuing offense plainly\nappears, at the time when the course of conduct or the defendant's complicity therein is\nterminated.\" Robinson could not have completed capital murders until both of the\nstatutory elements were satisfied.\n\n\n       The murders of Trouten and Lewicka each constituted parts of the common\nscheme or course of conduct that included the murders of Stasi, Sheila and Debbie Faith,\nand Bonner. Accordingly, the elements of capital murder as charged under K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) were not united and fulfilled until the principal charged capital murder\nvictims, Trouten in Count II and Lewicka in Count III, had been killed. A reasonable\njuror could conclude from the State's evidence that the murders of Trouten and Lewicka\nboth occurred after July 1, 1994, the effective date of K.S.A. 21-3439. Simply put,\nRobinson did not complete the crimes of capital murder as charged in the Fourth\nAmended Complaint until after the statute was in effect.\n\n\n       The Oregon Court of Appeals was presented with a similar issue in State v.\nZelinka, 130 Or. App. 464, 882 P.2d 624 (1994). There, defendant was convicted of three\n\n\n\n                                                  237\n\fcounts of murder by abuse and criminal mistreatment. Oregon's murder by abuse statute,\nprovided:\n\n\n               \"(1) Except as provided in ORS 163.118 and 163.125, criminal homicide\n       constitutes murder:\n               ....\n               (c) By abuse when a person recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme\n       indifference to the value of human life, causes the death of a child under 14 years of\n       age . . . and the person has previously engaged in a pattern or practice of assault or torture\n       of the victim or another child under 14 years of age or a dependent person.\" Ore. Rev.\n       Stat. § 163.115(1)(c) (1990).\n\n\n       Defendant argued the trial court improperly allowed acts of abuse committed\nbefore the enactment of the statute to prove the element of pattern or practice of assault or\ntorture, arguing it was a retroactive application violating the Ex Post Facto Clause of the\nUnited States Constitution. Rejecting this claim, the Oregon Court of Appeals found that\n\"[d]efendant's ex post facto argument turns on an artificial disassociation of the pre-\nenactment assaults from the post-enactment murder. Murder by abuse requires both\nelements. Accordingly, defendant's crime was not completed until after the enactment of\nthe statute.\" 130 Ore. at 472.\n\n\n       The Zelinka rationale applies equally to Robinson's challenge. As charged, K.S.A.\n21-3439(a)(6) includes two separate elements, the killing of multiple persons and a\ncommon scheme or course of conduct. Robinson cannot artificially disassociate the\npreenactment murders from the postenactment murders of the principal victims that\nconstituted parts of defendant's common scheme or course of conduct. The elements of\nthe capital murder statute were not completed until Robinson murdered Trouten, under\nCount II, and Lewicka, under Count III—acts that occurred subsequent to enactment.\n\n\n                                                    238\n\f       Likewise, the California Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in People v.\nGrant, 20 Cal. 4th 150, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d 295, 973 P.2d 72 (1999). There, defendant was\nconvicted under the continuous sexual abuse of a minor statute, which prohibited any\nperson residing with or having access to a child under the age of 14 to molest that child at\nleast three times during a period of not less than 3 months. The court examined whether\nabusive conduct that began before, but continued after, the effective date of the\ncontrolling statute could support defendant's conviction. The California Supreme Court\nobserved that a statute is applied retroactively only if it penalizes a crime completed\nbefore the law's effective date. As such, the critical question was \"whether the last act or\nevent necessary to trigger application of the statute occurred before or after the statute's\neffective date.\" 20 Cal. 4th at 157. In affirming the conviction, the court held:\n\n\n               \"Here, defendant was convicted of continuous sexual abuse . . . after the court\n       instructed the jury to return a verdict of guilty only if it found that one of the required\n       minimum of three acts of molestation occurred after section 288.5's effective date. In\n       other words, defendant could be convicted only if the course of conduct constituting the\n       offense of continuous sexual abuse was completed after the new law became effective.\n       Because the last act necessary to trigger application of section 288.5 was an act of\n       molestation that defendant committed after section 288.5's effective date, defendant's\n       conviction was not a retroactive application of section 288.5 and therefore not a violation\n       of the statutory prohibition against retroactive application of the Penal Code.\" 20 Cal. 4th\n       at 157-58.\n\n\n       For Robinson, the last act or event necessary to trigger application of K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) was the murder of Trouten in Count II and the murder of Lewicka in Count\nIII. Both murders were committed subsequent to the enactment of the capital murder\nstatute. As in Grant, because the final acts necessary to trigger application of K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) were committed after the effective date of the statute, Robinson's convictions\nand the evidence supporting them do not constitute a retroactive application of the statute.\n\n                                                    239\n\f       Robinson relies on United States v. Husted, 545 F.3d 1240, 1241 (10th Cir. 2008).\nThere, defendant was convicted of a sex crime requiring him to register as a sex offender\nunder Illinois law in 1993. In January 2006, he informed Illinois he was moving to\nOklahoma, and he registered in that state the following month. Defendant later fell out of\ncompliance and was arrested in Missouri in March 2007. It was undisputed that defendant\nhad relocated to Missouri prior to the effective date of 18 U.S.C. § 2250 (2006) of the\nSex Offender Registration and Notification Act. In order to convict a defendant under this\nstatute, the government must prove that a person required to register, travels in interstate\ncommerce and knowingly fails to register or update his registration. 545 F.3d at 1243.\nThe Tenth Circuit found that Congress' use of the word \"travels\" expressed an intent that\nthe statute not apply to those who had traveled in interstate commerce prior to enactment\nof the statute. 545 F.3d at 1243-44.\n\n\n       The holding in Husted is largely dependent on Congress' use of the word \"travels\"\nin the federal act, and no comparable language in our capital murder statute exists or\nsupports a similar construction. Moreover, in Husted, unlike here, defendant had\ncompleted all elements of the offense prior to enactment of the statute, and defendant's\nconviction could stand only by applying the statute retroactively. 545 F.3d at 1246. On\nthese grounds, Husted is factually and legally distinguishable.\n\n\n       Based on our construction of K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), Robinson completed the acts\nsatisfying elements of the charged offenses only after enactment of the statute. As such,\napplying the statute prospectively, the State's evidence was sufficient to support his\ncapital murder convictions under Counts II and III.\n\n\n\n\n                                            240\n\f                                          6. MULTIPLICITY\n\n       Robinson argues the capital murder convictions are multiplicitous with one\nanother, and each is multiplicitous with the first-degree murder conviction.\n\n\nLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n               \"Multiplicity is the charging of a single offense in more than one count of a\n       complaint or information. It creates the potential for multiple punishments for a single\n       crime, offending the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United\n       States Constitution and Section 10 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. State v.\n       Scott, 286 Kan. at 65 (quoting Harris, 284 Kan. 560, Syl. ¶ 1).\" Carr, 300 Kan. at 163.\n\n\n       In determining whether convictions subject a defendant to double jeopardy, \"the\noverarching inquiry is whether the convictions are for the same offense.\" State v.\nSchoonover, 281 Kan. 453, 496, 133 P.3d 48 (2006). This inquiry is broken into \"two\ncomponents, both of which must be met for there to be a double jeopardy violation: (1)\nDo the convictions arise from the same conduct? and (2) By statutory definition, are there\ntwo offenses or only one?\" 281 Kan. at 496. As to the second component, \"[i]f the double\njeopardy issue arises from convictions for multiple violations of a single statute the unit\nof prosecution test is applied.\" 281 Kan. at 497. \"If the convictions are based upon\ndifferent statutes, the convictions are multiplicitous only when the statutes upon which\nthe convictions are based contain an identity of elements.\" State v. Thompson, 287 Kan.\n238, 244, 200 P.3d 22 (2009).\n\n\n       Our review is unlimited in assessing this question of law. State v. Appleby, 289\nKan. 1017, 1026, 221 P.3d 525 (2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  241\n\fWere Robinson's capital murder convictions multiplicitous?\n\n       Robinson was convicted of capital murder on Counts II and III of the Fourth\nAmended Complaint. The counts were identical in charging capital murder under K.S.A.\n21-3439(a)(6) for the murders of the principal victims, Trouten in Count II and Lewicka\nin Count III, as \"one of multiple acts or transactions constituting parts of a common\nscheme or course of conduct in which other human beings were killed in a premeditated\nand intentional manner, to-wit: Beverly J. Bonner, Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith and Lisa\nStasi.\" The jury convicted and sentenced Robinson to death on both counts. At trial,\nRobinson challenged his first-degree murder conviction, but not the capital convictions,\nas multiplicitous. Nevertheless, we consider both challenges in the interests of justice.\nSee Carr, 300 Kan. at 163-64.\n\n\n       The \"unit of prosecution\" under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) is the killing of more than\none person, and the killing of the second (and subsequent) victim(s) makes the murders\nof the group of victims punishable by death. As such, we have held previously that\nmultiple capital murder convictions under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) based on the killing of\nthe same victims are multiplicitous. Carr, 300 Kan. at 164; State v. Harris, 284 Kan. 560,\n571-78, 162 P.3d 28 (2007).\n\n\n       The State acknowledges this precedent but argues it is distinguishable because not\nall of the victims of the multiple murders are listed in all of the capital counts of the\ncomplaint. Specifically, Trouten is not mentioned in Count III of the complaint and\nLewicka is not mentioned in Count II of the complaint. The State emphasizes language in\nHarris acknowledging that \"under other circumstances, a defendant may be convicted\nand punished appropriately and constitutionally on multiple counts of capital murder, as\nthat offense is defined in K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(1) through (7).\" 284 Kan. at 578. The State\nmaintains this case presents those \"other circumstances\" because the serial killings of\n\n                                              242\n\fTrouten and Lewicka constituted discrete acts rather than unitary conduct. Schoonover,\n281 Kan. at 464 (double jeopardy issue not raised where defendant convicted and\nsentenced for discrete and separate acts or courses of conduct but, instead, where conduct\nis unitary).\n\n\n       However, in Schoonover we acknowledged \"[t]he overarching inquiry is whether\nthe convictions are for the same offense.\" 281 Kan. at 496. Here, the legislature has\ndefined capital murder to include the killing of more than one person \"in two or more acts\nor transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\nconduct.\" K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). Because the legislature defined the offense to include\ntwo or more discrete acts or transactions, the unitary conduct inquiry here must\nnecessarily focus on the nature of the \"common scheme or course of conduct,\" not merely\non the \"killing of more than one person.\" See Schoonover, 281 Kan. at 472 (unit of\nprosecution not necessarily dependent on whether there is a single act or victim, but,\ninstead, the key is the nature of the conduct described; unit of prosecution can be\ndetermined by scope of the course of conduct defined by statute rather than discrete\nphysical acts composing that course of conduct); see also State v. Olsson, 2014-NMSC-\n012, ¶ 18, 324 P.3d 1230 (N.M. 2014) (relevant inquiry in a unit of prosecution case is\nwhether legislature intended punishment for the entire course of conduct or for each\ndiscrete act).\n\n\n       Here, the State alleged, argued, and proved that all of the murders in Counts II and\nIII were tied together by the same common scheme or course of conduct. The State did\nnot allege or prove the existence of a separate, distinct common scheme or course of\nconduct for each capital murder charge. The lone common scheme or course of conduct\nconnecting all murders charged in Counts II and III is properly characterized as unitary\nconduct under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). Also, by statutory definition, there is but one\noffense because the legislature defined the unit of prosecution as more than one murder\n                                            243\n\ftied together by or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct, even if\ncommitted in discrete acts. Robinson's capital murder convictions are multiplicitous.\n\n\n       Robinson believes the proper remedy is to reverse one capital conviction and\nresentence him on the other, reasoning that these convictions might have prejudiced the\njury against defendant \"by creating the impression of more criminal activity on his part\nthan in fact may have been present.\" To the contrary, we have consistently held that the\nremedy for multiplicitous convictions in unit of prosecution cases is the reversal of all but\none conviction based upon a single unit of prosecution. \"There can be only one\nconviction for each allowable unit of prosecution.\" Schoonover, 281 Kan. at 497-98; see\nHarris, 284 Kan. at 577-78. Robinson cites no authority directly supporting his theory of\nprejudice or resentencing as a proper remedy, and, even if there were, we hold \"the death\nverdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable\" to the fact that the\nprosecution charged Robinson with two counts of capital murder instead of one, as both\nconvictions supported but one aggravating circumstance and no new evidence was\nadmitted during the penalty phase to support it. See State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, 1087-\n88, 40 P.3d 139 (2001), cert. denied 537 U.S. 834, overruled on other grounds by Kansas\nv. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429 (2006).\n\n\n       We reverse the conviction and vacate the sentence on Count III, which simply by\nbeing the second capital murder charge in the complaint is the multiplicitous count giving\nrise to the double jeopardy violation. In doing so, we emphasize and cannot overstate that\nthis holding in no way excuses Robinson's conduct or makes his murder of Lewicka any\nless reprehensible. Nor, we hope, should it reopen, heighten, or otherwise cheapen the\nterrible pain and suffering Robinson's conduct caused to Lewicka and the still living\nvictims of her murder. Had the State included her murder in Count II or alleged the\nexistence of a different common scheme or course of conduct in Count III, the situation\nwould be different.\n                                              244\n\fWas Robinson's first-degree murder conviction multiplicitous?\n\n         In addition to the two capital murder convictions, Robinson was also convicted\nand sentenced to life in prison with eligibility for parole after 15 years on Count V, the\nfirst-degree premeditated murder of Lisa Stasi. Robinson maintains this conviction and\nsentence is multiplicitous with both capital murder counts since Stasi's death is alleged as\na predicate murder for both those counts.\n\n\n         We settled this issue in State v. Scott, 286 Kan. 54, 65-68, 183 P.3d 801 (2008),\nholding that two convictions arising out of a double homicide, one for capital murder\nbased on the intentional and premeditated killing of more than one person and the other\nfor premeditated first-degree murder, were improperly multiplicitous because, under\nK.S.A. 21-3107(2)(d), the first-degree premeditated murder was a crime necessarily\nproved if the capital murder was proved and the legislature had not authorized multiple\nprosecutions. We have continued to apply the Scott holding in similar circumstances. See\nState v. Gleason, 299 Kan. 1127, 1184-85, 329 P.3d 1102 (2014) (capital murder\nconviction based on multiple intentional, premeditated murders and first-degree\npremeditated murder conviction multiplicitous), cert. denied 135 S. Ct. 1698 (2015);\nTrotter v. State, 288 Kan. 112, 124, 200 P.3d 1236 (2009) (same). The State concedes the\nerror.\n\n\n         We reverse the conviction and vacate the sentence on Count V as it is\nunconstitutionally multiplicitous with the capital counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                             245\n\f                         7. JURISDICTIONALLY DEFECTIVE COMPLAINT\n\n       Robinson argues the Fourth Amended Complaint was so poorly drafted that it\nfailed to confer jurisdiction on the trial court over the capital murder and aggravated\ninterference with parental custody counts, Counts II, III, and VI.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       \"This court reviews de novo whether a complaint is sufficient to give the district\ncourt jurisdiction over a charge.\" State v. Hurd, 298 Kan. 555, 565, 316 P.3d 696 (2013).\n\n\n       Because Robinson timely filed a motion for arrest of judgment based on a\ndefective complaint, we review the issue under the pre-Hall standard. Hurd, 298 Kan. at\n565; see State v. Hall, 246 Kan. 728, 764-65, 793 P.2d 737 (1990), overruled in part on\nother grounds by Ferguson v. State, 276 Kan. 428, 78 P.3d 40 (2003). \"Under this\nstandard, an information which omits one or more of the essential elements of the crime it\nattempts to charge is jurisdictionally and fatally defective, and a conviction based on such\nan information must be reversed.\" Scott, 286 Kan. at 63. Nevertheless,\n\n\n               \"[u]nder the pre–Hall standard, an information is sufficient if it substantially\n       follows the language of the statute or charges the offense in equivalent words or others of\n       the same import, so long as the defendant is fully informed of the particular offense\n       charged and the court is able to determine under what statute the charge is founded.\"\n       State v. Reyna, 290 Kan. 666, Syl. ¶ 6, 234 P.3d 761, cert. denied 131 S. Ct. 532 (2010).\n\n\nWas the complaint jurisdictionally defective?\n\n       K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), under which the two capital counts were brought, provides\nthat capital murder is the \"intentional and premeditated killing of more than one person as\n\n\n                                                   246\n\fa part of the same act or transaction or in two or more acts or transactions connected\ntogether or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct.\"\n\n\n       The capital counts provided:\n\n               \"Count II- Further, that between the 29th day of February, 2000, and the 3rd day\n       of June, 2000, in the County of Johnson, State of Kansas, JOHN EDWARD ROBINSON,\n       SR., did then and there unlawfully, feloniously, intentionally, and with premeditation kill\n       a human being, to-wit: Suzette Marie Trouten, by striking said Suzette Marie Trouten in\n       the head with a blunt instrument, and that said premeditated intentional killing of Suzette\n       Marie Trouten was one of multiple acts or transactions constituting parts of a common\n       scheme or course of conduct in which other human beings were killed in a premeditated\n       and intentional manner, to-wit: Beverly J.

Like here, the complaint in Scott alleged defendant\n\n       \"did then and there unlawfully, intentionally and with premeditation kill Elizabeth G.\n       Brittain, and that the intentional and premeditated killing of Elizabeth G. Brittain, and\n       Douglas G. Brittain, was part of the same act or transaction or two or more acts or\n       transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\n       conduct.\" 286 Kan. at 62.\n\n\nScott argued the complaint was defective in failing to allege that he killed Douglas\nBrittain. We disagreed, finding that \"the allegation Scott killed Douglas Brittain was\nnecessarily implied by the language used and a common-sense reading of the charge.\"\n286 Kan. at 64.\n\n\n       Robinson attempts to distinguish Scott on several grounds. His arguments\nillustrate that the language in the complaint could have been more specific and precise.\nNevertheless, it is easily discernible from the complaint as a whole what the charges were\nand that Robinson was the person charged under the capital murder and the aggravated\ninterference with parental custody counts. See Reyna, 290 Kan. 666, Syl. ¶ 6.\n\n\n                                   8. EVIDENTIARY CHALLENGES\n\n       Robinson challenges a number of Judge Anderson's evidentiary rulings on appeal.\nSpecifically, he contends the trial court erred by: (1) admitting Cathy Norman's\n                                                   249\n\ftestimony regarding contents of a writing discussing victim Sheila Faith's sexual\nproclivities; (2) admitting e-mails in violation of the best evidence and authentication\nrules; (3) admitting evidence of uncharged homicides in violation of K.S.A. 60-445 and\nK.S.A. 60-455; (4) allowing the medical examiner to testify that Sheila Faith's injury was\nconsistent with a defensive wound; and (5) disparately ruling on defendant's hearsay\nobjections when compared with similar objections from the State.\n\n\nCathy Norman's Testimony Regarding the Contents of a Writing\n\n       1. Additional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Again, Cathy Norman was victim Sheila Faith's sister. At the end of her direct\nexamination, prosecutor Welch asked Norman whether Sheila Faith had an interest in\nBDS&M, which resulted in the following exchange:\n\n\n       \"[Prosecutor]: Now, ma'am, did you know if your sister Sheila—or are you aware that\n                      your sister, Sheila, had an interest in bondage and discipline and\n                      sadomasochistic sex?\n       \"[Norman]:     Yes.\n       \"[Prosecutor]: How do you know that?\n       \"[Norman]:     For some reason she had moved out of this house and my other sister,\n                      Michelle, and I had to clean it up and we found correspondence to where\n                      she was into the kinky sex.\n       \"[Prosecutor]: Anything in specific?\n       \"[Norman]:     Spanking.\n       \"[Prosecutor]: And do you know about how long ago this was?\n       \"[Norman]:     It was a long time ago.\n       \"[Prosecutor]: Was this the house in Texas?\n       \"[Norman]:     Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                 250\n\f       Robinson lodged no objection. During cross-examination, defense counsel\neffectively challenged the reliability of this correspondence as proof of Sheila Faith's\ninterest in BDS&M, highlighting the fact that Norman found the writing more than 20\nyears prior, that she saw no other evidence of BDS&M activity at the time she found the\nwriting, and that she had not encountered any new information since then suggesting her\nsister held an interest in this subculture.\n\n\n       2. Standard of Review\n\n       \"'The admission of evidence lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.'\"\nState v. Holmes, 278 Kan. 603, 623, 102 P.3d 406 (2004) (quoting State v. Jenkins, 272\nKan. 1366, 1378, 39 P.3d 47 [2002]).\n\n               \"We begin by recognizing that when reviewing a district court decision to admit\n       or exclude evidence, we use a multistep analysis.

For the first step, we determine whether the evidence is relevant.\n       Evidence is relevant when it has 'any tendency in reason to prove any material fact.'\n       K.S.A. 60-401(b).

Did Judge Anderson erroneously admit Cathy Norman's testimony?\n\n       For the first time on appeal, Robinson argues the trial judge erred by allowing\nCathy Norman to testify to the correspondence because her testimony was irrelevant,\nlacked proper foundation, was based on hearsay, and violated the best evidence rule.\n\n\n       Generally, the failure to lodge a contemporaneous objection to the admission of\nevidence forecloses subsequent challenge on appeal. State v. Wilson, 247 Kan. 87, 98,\n795 P.2d 336 (1990). However, K.S.A. 21-4627(b), recodified as K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 21-\n6619(b), compels our review of any issue raised in defendant's brief, even if not\npreserved properly for appeal. State v. Cheever, 295 Kan. 229, 241, 284 P.3d 1007\n(2012), vacated and remanded on other grounds 571 U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 596, 187 L. Ed.\n2d 519 (2013).\n\n\n       Though not procedurally barred, the absence of a contemporaneous objection\nraises a very practical problem—it yielded a record devoid of a complete recitation of the\nfactual and legal basis for the objection, a proffer in support of admission, and findings of\nfact and conclusions of law upon which we typically review the district judge's decision.\nOther pertinent facts, such as the date and author of the writing, the form or medium in\nwhich it was written, the availability of the original, etc., are also absent.\n\n\n       While K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 21-6619(b) compels our review of all issues briefed on\nappeal, it does \"not require that we treat the record other than as it is presented to us.\" See\nState v. Bornholdt, 261 Kan. 644, 651, 932 P.2d 964 (1997), disapproved on other\ngrounds by State v. Marsh, 278 Kan. 520, 102 P.3d 445 (2004). We thus consider this\nchallenge based on the status of the record presented on appeal and mindful of the fact\n                                                  252\n\fthat Robinson, as the party alleging error, bears the burden of demonstrating error. See,\ne.g., State v. Tague, 296 Kan. 993, 1005, 298 P.3d 273 (2013) (burden is on party\nasserting error to establish trial judge abused discretion in limiting cross-examination).\n\n\n       In the absence of any objection, we consider whether Judge Anderson had an\naffirmative duty to exclude Norman's testimony. See Bornholdt, 261 Kan. at 652. Her\ntestimony was relevant to the State's theory that Robinson's pattern of luring women for\nthe purpose of exploiting them sexually, often through BDS&M activities specifically,\nwas part of the common scheme or course of conduct charged under K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6). There was no lack of foundation or improper authentication of the\ncorrespondence because the State did not offer it into evidence. See K.S.A. 60-464\n(proper foundation required prior to receiving writing into evidence). While Norman\ntestified in general to the nature of the correspondence, she did so to explain the basis for\nher belief that Sheila was interested in BDS&M-related activities. Without an adequately\ndeveloped record, we cannot presume this testimony was offered for the truth of the\nmatter asserted. See State v. Smith, 271 Kan. 666, 674, 24 P.3d 727 (hearsay rule\ninapplicable where statement not offered for truth of matter asserted), cert. denied 534\nU.S. 1066 (2001). For the same reason, it is not apparent the testimony was offered for\nthe purpose of proving the content of the correspondence, invoking the limitations of the\nbest evidence rule. See K.S.A. 60-467 (original writing required to prove its contents).\n\n\n       Based on the record presented, we simply cannot conclude that Judge Anderson\nerred by admitting this testimony in the absence of an objection. See State v. Thornburgh,\n220 N.W.2d 579, 584 (Iowa 1974) (\"[A]bsent an objection by opponent's counsel . . . , it\nis ordinarily not the judge's duty to exclude evidence or interpose an objection to the\nquestion.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                             253\n\fE-mails Admitted over Best Evidence and Authentication Objections\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court abused its discretion by admitting a number of e-\nmail exchanges between Robinson and the victims or other witnesses, which tended to\nsupport the State's theory that he lured his victims and engaged in acts of fraud and deceit\nto conceal their murders as part of the common scheme or course of conduct charged in\nthe capital counts. In particular, Robinson believes these e-mails were unreliable because\nmost exhibits had been forwarded to law enforcement and printed, rather than printed\nfrom the original recipient's computer.\n\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n       We review best evidence and authentication challenges on appeal for an abuse of\ndiscretion. See State v. Hill, 290 Kan. 339, 364, 228 P.3d 1027 (2010) (authentication).\n\n\n       2. Did admission of the e-mails violate the best evidence rule?\n\n       Robinson contends the trial court violated the best evidence rule by admitting\nnumerous e-mails that were forwarded to police rather than printed from the victims' or\nwitnesses' computers. Robinson also challenges exhibits containing e-mail strings rather\nthan individual, segregated messages.\n\n\n       The best evidence rule provides that \"[a]s tending to prove the content of a\nwriting, no evidence other than the writing itself is admissible, except as otherwise\nprovided in these rules.\" K.S.A. 60-467(a). A \"writing\" is defined broadly to include\nevery means of recording, upon any tangible thing, any form of communication or\nrepresentation. K.S.A. 60-401(m). Both parties presume the challenged e-mails constitute\n\"writings\" and were offered to prove their content. We assume, without deciding, the\nsame. Cf. State v. Schuette, 273 Kan. 593, 599, 44 P.3d 459 (2002) (caller ID displays not\n                                            254\n\fa writing because \"[t]he results cannot be printed out or saved on an electronic medium\");\nState v. Wilson, No. 103,749, 2012 WL 718916 (Kan. App. 2012) (unpublished opinion)\n(assuming \"text messages may be writings subject to the best evidence rule\"), rev. denied\n296 Kan. 1136 (2013); see State v. Dale, 293 Kan. 660, 663, 267 P.3d 743 (2011) (best\nevidence rule applies only when evidence offered to prove content of a writing).\n\n\n       Generally the best evidence rule requires the original writing be introduced when\navailable. See State v. Goodwin, 223 Kan. 257, 258, 573 P.2d 999 (1977) (original\nrequired, but secondary evidence admissible where original unavailable). However, when\na writing is stored electronically, what constitutes an original and the practicalities of any\nproduction are not automatically clear. After all, \"[p]roduction of a true original of an\nemail or social networking page is not necessarily possible because both are always\nelectronic.\" Pannozzo, Uploading Guilt: Adding A Virtual Records Exception to the\nFederal Rules of Evidence, 44 Conn. L. Rev. 1695, 1708 (2012). K.S.A. 60-467(a) does\nnot squarely address what constitutes an original for best evidence purposes when \"the\nwriting itself\" is stored electronically, and we have not had occasion to address the\nsubject previously.\n\n\n       In the absence of controlling authority, the parties turn to the federal equivalent of\nour best evidence rule. Like K.S.A. 60-467, the federal rule contemplates that \"[a]n\noriginal writing . . . is required in order to prove its content\" unless otherwise provided by\nrule or statute. Fed. R. Evid. 1002. More importantly, the federal rule specifically\ncontemplates that \"[f]or electronically stored information, 'original' means any printout—\nor other output readable by sight—if it accurately reflects the information.\" Fed. R. Evid.\n1001(d). This definition is consistent with Federal Rule of Evidence 1003, which\nprovides that \"[a] duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original unless a\ngenuine question is raised about the original's authenticity or the circumstances make it\nunfair to admit the duplicate.\" A \"duplicate\" is defined as \"a counterpart produced by a\n                                             255\n\fmechanical, photographic, chemical, electronic, or other equivalent process or technique\nthat accurately reproduces the original.\" Fed R. Evid. 1001(e).\n\n\n       We regard the federal rule, along with similar state counterparts, as instructive,\nand we are persuaded by the authority interpreting these provisions. See Fredricks v.\nFoltz, 221 Kan. 28, 30, 557 P.2d 1252 (1976) (finding federal interpretations persuasive\nwhere state and federal rules similar). The federal version of the rule is consistent with\nour prior holdings allowing the use of duplicates or secondary evidence, barring genuine\ndisputes as to fraud or alteration. See, e.g., Goodwin, 223 Kan. at 258-59 (defendant's\nbest evidence challenge flawed where he never suggested contents of secondary evidence\nwere less than the truth; absent proof of discrepancy, secondary evidence admissible).\nLikewise, by excluding printouts of electronically stored information or duplicates where\nthe content is inaccurate, the federal rules further the underlying purpose of the best\nevidence rule—the prevention of fraud. See United States v. Yamin, 868 F.2d 130, 134\n(5th Cir. 1989) (purpose is to prevent fraud).\n\n\n       Based on the federal definition of an \"original\" and \"duplicate\" writing, along with\nthe underlying rule accepting both for best evidence purposes, any printed version of e-\nmail communications may be admitted as the original, provided there is no genuine\ndispute regarding authenticity. See New Image Painting, Inc. v. Home Depot U.S.A., Inc.,\nNo. SACV 09-1224 AG (RNBx), 2009 WL 4730891, at *2 (C.D. Cal. 2009)\n(unpublished opinion) (copies of e-mails constitute duplicate originals under Fed. R.\nEvid. 1003); Dirickson v. State, 104 Ark. App. 273, 277, 291 S.W.3d 198 (2009)\n(printouts of Internet conversations fall within definition of original); Commonwealth v.\nAmaral, 78 Mass. App. 671, 675-76, 941 N.E.2d 1143 (2011) (accepting printed e-mails\nas best evidence). Courts have found such printouts acceptable for best evidence\npurposes, even where the e-mails have been forwarded. Greco v. Velvet Cactus, LLC,\nCiv. No. 13-3514, 2014 WL 2943598, at *2-3 (E.D. La. 2014) (unpublished opinion)\n                                             256\n\f(text messages converted to e-mail format and forwarded to counsel for printing\nconstituted \"original\" for best evidence purposes).\n\n\n       Robinson cites Bobo v. State, 102 Ark. App. 329, 335-36, 285 S.W.3d 270 (2008),\nfor the proposition that a printout of a forwarded e-mail violates the best evidence rule.\nHowever, Bobo did not hold that printouts of forwarded e-mails could not be deemed a\nproper \"original\" or \"duplicate\" per se. Instead, it merely ruled in favor of the argument\nadvanced by the prosecution in that case—that e-mails were admissible under the loss or\ndestruction-of-original exception to the best evidence rule. 102 Ark. App. at 335-36.\n\n\n       Robinson also cites Ruberto v. C.I.R., 774 F.2d 61 (2d Cir. 1985), and State v.\nLewis, No. 96,005, 2008 WL 142105, at *6 (Kan. App. 2008) (unpublished opinion), in\nsupport of his best evidence argument. In both those cases, the prosecution attempted to\nadmit photocopies of cancelled checks, instruments that formed the very subject of the\ncriminal charges. However, without the original checks, there were legitimate proof\nproblems in attempting to match the endorsements on the back of the checks. Neither\nRuberto nor Lewis involved the use of printouts of electronically stored information, and\nthe e-mails in this case did not give rise to the unique proof problems experienced with\nthe photocopies of the original checks. The cited authority is distinguishable.\n\n\n       Robinson also argues the State's e-mail evidence is not an original writing as\ndefined under the federal rules. He relies on an Advisory Committee Note explaining that\na duplicate \"describes 'copies' produced by methods possessing an accuracy which\nvirtually eliminates the possibility of error.\" Fed. R. Evid. 1001 Advisory committee\nNote 4. Robinson reasons that forwarded e-mails do not possess an accuracy virtually\neliminating error because their text can be manipulated.\n\n\n\n\n                                            257\n\f       Of course, Robinson's argument applies to the use of duplicates under Federal\nRule of Evidence 1003 only, and it completely ignores Federal Rule of Evidence 1001(d),\nwhich defines an original to include any accurate printout of electronically stored\ninformation. Furthermore, the Advisory Committee Note Robinson cites provides that the\nmethod of reproducing the communication must be accurate, not that the process must be\nimmune from subsequent fraudulent alteration. Fed. R. Evid. 1001 Advisory Committee\nNote 4; cf. United States v. Safavian, 435 F. Supp. 2d 36, 41 (D.D.C. 2006) (\"The\npossibility of alteration does not and cannot be the basis for excluding e-mails as\nunidentified or unauthenticated as a matter of course, any more than it can be the\nrationale for excluding paper documents (and copies of those documents).\"); Simon v.\nState, 279 Ga. App. 844, 847, 632 S.E.2d 723 (2006) (\"e-mail offers unique opportunities\nfor fabrication, [but] it is held to the same standards of authentication as other similar\nevidence\"); Commonwealth v. Purdy, 459 Mass. 442, 450, 945 N.E.2d 372 (2011)\n(\"While e-mails and other forms of electronic communication present their own\nopportunities for false claims of authorship, the basic principles of authentication are the\nsame.\"). Robinson does not dispute that e-mail programs accurately reproduce the content\nof the prior e-mail exchanges between a sender and recipient, i.e., the e-mail string,\nanytime a party clicks \"reply\" or \"forward\" within the e-mail program. This method of\nreproduction appears to be the very type of process the Advisory Committee deemed\nacceptable for purposes of a duplicate original.\n\n\n       Robinson also argues that the e-mails did not constitute the best evidence because\nthere were signs of possible alteration. We address this argument fully in defendant's\nauthentication challenge.\n\n\n       We find no error in Judge Anderson's ruling that accurate printouts of e-mails are\nakin to duplicates or otherwise satisfy the best evidence rule, even if the e-mail messages\nare forwarded or contain e-mail strings. See Adams v. State, 2005 WY 94, ¶ 22-26, 117\n                                             258\n\fP.3d 1210 (Wyo. 2005) (admission of edited printouts of chat room messages did not\nviolate best evidence rule; computer printouts subject only to proof of authenticity).\n\n\n       3. Were the Challenged E-mails Authenticated Properly?\n\n       \"Authentication of a writing is required before it may be received in evidence.\"\nK.S.A. 60-464. \"The authentication requirement is 'satisfied by evidence sufficient to\nsupport a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims.'\" United States\nv. Hernandez-Herrera, 952 F.2d 342, 343 (10th Cir. 1991) (quoting Fed. R. Evid.\n901[a]). The proponent of the writing must proffer evidence upon which a reasonable\njuror could conclude that the message is what it purports to be. Safavian, 435 F. Supp. 2d\nat 38; People v. Downin, 357 Ill. App. 3d 193, 202-03, 828 N.E.2d 341 (2005). Courts\nhave characterized this burden of proof as minimal or slight. United States v. Gagliardi,\n506 F.3d 140, 151 (2d Cir. 2007) (standard \"minimal\"); Lexington Ins. v. Western\nPennsylvania Hosp., 423 F.3d 318, 328 (3d Cir. 2005) (burden \"slight\"); Manuel v. State,\n357 S.W.3d 66, 74 (Tex. App. 2011) (not a \"particularly high hurdle\").\n\n\n       \"[W]hether a writing has been properly authenticated is a matter for the court to\ndecide, according to no precise formula, but based upon proof to its satisfaction.\" United\nStates v. Wagner, 475 F.2d 121, 123 (10th Cir. 1973). We have recognized that such\nproof may be in the form of indirect or circumstantial evidence. State v. Hill, 290 Kan.\n339, 365, 228 P.3d 1027 (2010). Circumstantial evidence may include \"appearance,\ncontents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken\ntogether with all the circumstances.\" Fed. R. Evid. 901(b)(4); United States v. Smith, 918\nF.2d 1501, 1510 (11th Cir. 1990) (Document may be authenticated solely through\ncircumstantial evidence, \"including the document's own distinctive characteristics and the\ncircumstances surrounding its discovery. [Citations omitted.]\"), cert. denied sub nom.\n\n\n\n                                             259\n\fHicks v. United States, 502 U.S. 849 (1991), and Sawyer v. United States, 502 U.S. 890\n(1991).\n\n\n       Once the proponent has offered sufficient authentication evidence, discrepancies\nand other conflicting evidence go to the weight, not the admissibility, of the writing. See\nState v. Peoples, 227 Kan. 127, 133, 605 P.2d 135 (1980); People v. Lucas, 60 Cal. 4th\n153, 262, 177 Cal. Rptr. 3d 378, 333 P.3d 587 (2014).\n\n\n       Robinson's challenge focuses on the genuineness of numerous e-mail exhibits.\nGiven the number of e-mails in question, the various senders and recipients involved, and\nthe different forms in which they were admitted, we divide them into the following four\ncategories for purposes of our analysis: (1) e-mails sent to or from Lore Remington; (2)\ne-mails sent to or from Tammi Taylor; (3) e-mail to Marshalla Chidester; and (4) e-mails\nseized pursuant to search warrant.\n\n\n              a. E-mails Sent to or from Lore Remington\n\n\n       Robinson contends the e-mail messages between Robinson and Lore Remington,\nState's Exhibits 4, 5, 11, and 12, were not properly authenticated.\n\n\n       At trial, the State proffered Remington's testimony outside the presence of the jury\nto authenticate these exhibits. Based on her independent recollection, Remington testified\nthat State's Exhibits 4 and 5 were printouts from her home computer of e-mails she\nreceived from and sent to Robinson when he was posing as Trouten. She confirmed the\ncontent of the messages were true and accurate and that she did not alter them in any\nway. Based on this testimony, the State adequately authenticated State's Exhibits 4 and 5.\nSee Bobo, 102 Ark. App. at 334-36 (copies of e-mails properly admitted where witness\nconfirmed content matched his independent recollection of messages); Simon, 279 Ga.\n                                            260\n\fApp. at 847-48 (e-mails properly authenticated where witness testified printouts\naccurately reflected exchange between the parties and messages contained indicia of\nreliability); Kearley v. State, 843 So. 2d 66, 70 (Miss. App. 2002) (e-mails properly\nauthenticated where witness vouched for accuracy of printouts); Shea v. State, 167\nS.W.3d 98, 105 (Tex. App. 2005) (e-mails authenticated where complaining witness\ntestified she was familiar with the defendant's e-mail and received the messages from\nhim); Tibbetts v. RadioShack Corp., No. 03-C-2249, 2004 WL 2203418, at *13 (N.D. Ill.\n2004) (unpublished opinion) (copies of e-mails authenticated by sales manager's\ntestimony that they were true and accurate copies); see also Annot., 34 A.L.R. 6th 253\n(Authentication of Electronically Stored Evidence) § 2, pp. 269-70 (citing Mueller and\nKirkpatrick, Federal Evidence § 9:9 [3d ed.] [witness who viewed original e-mail need\nonly testify printout is an accurate reproduction]).\n\n\n       Other circumstantial evidence corroborated Remington's testimony and the\nauthenticity of these e-mails. State's Exhibit 4 is a copy of the original message\nRobinson, posing as Trouten, sent to Remington on Trouten's Hotmail account. State's\nExhibit 5 depicts the entire exchange of messages that occurred between the two on\nMarch 2, 2000, including the original message contained in State's Exhibit 4,\nRemington's response, and Robinson's reply to that response. The content within each\nmessage is logically connected to the others and reflects an ongoing exchange or dialogue\nbetween the parties. See Downin, 357 Ill. App. 3d at 203-04 (e-mails authenticated where\nwitness sent e-mail to defendant's address, and defendant's reply was responsive to\nmessage). In the final message of the e-mail string in State's Exhibit 5, Robinson, posing\nas Trouten, referred Remington to an eruditemaster@email.com address and encouraged\nher to contact the party at that address to meet a new BDS&M master. Before her proffer\nto the district judge, Remington had testified that she sent an e-mail message to the\n\"eruditemaster\" address, received a response, and began communicating regularly with a\nman she came to know as \"James Turner,\" one of Robinson's known aliases. See Hill,\n                                             261\n\f290 Kan. at 365 (writing authenticated where contents reveal knowledge particularly held\nby parties or substance uniquely identifiable); State v. Rives, 220 Kan. 141, 143-44, 551\nP.2d 788 (1976) (writing may be admitted where contents and circumstances reasonably\nimply author is person sought to be charged).\n\n\n       As to State's Exhibits 11 and 12, Remington testified they were copies of two e-\nmail exchanges between Remington and Robinson, posing as Turner, at the eruditemaster\naddress, which she forwarded to investigators at the Lenexa Police Department.\nRemington confirmed these exhibits were true and accurate copies of the original\nmessages she observed on her computer screen. The only difference was that the exhibits\nhad caret symbols located in front of the body of the message, signifying the content had\nbeen forwarded to investigators. Remington testified she did not alter the content of the\nmessages before forwarding them to police.\n\n\n       Additional circumstances corroborated Remington's testimony and the authenticity\nof these exhibits. Before her proffer, Remington testified that she began communicating\nwith Robinson, posing as Turner, at the eruditemaster address around the third week of\nMarch 2000 and continued to do so until Robinson's arrest in June. See State v. Bohlman,\nNo. A05-207, 2006 WL 915765, at *7 (Minn. App. 2006) (unpublished opinion) (e-mails\nauthenticated where witness testified she regularly communicated with defendant at\naddress appearing on exhibits). The e-mail communications carried over into telephone\nconversations. Remington testified that she spoke to Robinson, posing as Turner, by\ntelephone on 20 to 30 occasions. One of those conversations, which was intercepted by\nwiretap and played for the jury, closely paralleled the content of the e-mail message\nadmitted as State's Exhibit 12. See State v. Franklin, 280 Kan. 337, 342, 121 P.3d 447\n(2005) (text messages authenticated where content consistent with defendant's activities\nand statements); see also United States v. Siddiqui, 235 F.3d 1318, 1321-22 (11th Cir.\n\n\n                                            262\n\f2000) (e-mails properly authenticated where witness testified that subject matter of e-\nmail conversations carried over into telephone conversations).\n\n\n       Also, while searching Robinson's Olathe storage unit, police found several printed\ndocuments stored in a briefcase, including State's Exhibit 19EE—a printout of an e-mail\nfrom Remington to \"JT,\" presumably James Turner. The body of this e-mail message is\nidentical to the body of the message contained in State's Exhibit 11. The only difference\nbetween the exhibits is that the header information on State's Exhibit 11 shows the e-mail\nwas sent from Remington's e-mail account and the header information on State's Exhibit\n19EE shows the e-mail was received on Robinson's e-mail account. While State's Exhibit\n19EE was admitted after Judge Anderson had admitted State's Exhibits 11 and 12, it\nnevertheless confirms the accuracy of the contents of these exhibits.\n\n\n       Despite this evidence, Robinson argues the e-mails should have been excluded\nbecause of possible indicators of alteration. First, Robinson highlights a time stamp\ndiscrepancy between State's Exhibit 4 and State's Exhibit 5. State's Exhibit 4 contains a\ntime stamp indicating the first e-mail sent by Robinson to Remington was delivered at\n9:15 a.m. State's Exhibit 5, which includes the entire string of e-mails sent between the\ntwo on March 2, includes a time stamp indicating that the same message was sent at 8:15\na.m. Remington could not definitively explain the reason for the difference but confirmed\nthe 8:15 a.m. time stamp on State's Exhibit 5 did not originate from her computer; it came\nfrom Robinson's, suggesting the clocks on their computers were not synchronized or\nperhaps set to different time zones. Remington testified to the actual dates and times she\nsent and received the messages in these exhibits based on her independent recollection,\nand Robinson does not challenge the accuracy of their content. Judge Anderson's\nauthentication findings are supported by substantial competent evidence. See Schlaikjer\nv. Kaplan, 296 Kan. 456, 468, 293 P.3d 155 (2013) (appellate courts accept findings\nsupported by substantial competent evidence).\n                                            263\n\f       Second, Robinson argues the header information in State's Exhibit 5 is suspicious.\nIn the first message of that e-mail string, the subject line read: \"I'm off.\" In the second\nmessage, the header read: \"Re: I'm off.\" In the third message, the subject line again read:\n\"Re: I'm off.\" During her proffer, Remington explained her e-mail program\nautomatically generated a \"Re:\" in the subject line when she responded to a message but\nthat not all e-mail programs did so. During cross-examination, Robinson's counsel\nsuggested the final message in Exhibit 5 should have included a \"Re: Re:\" in the subject\nline—apparently forgetting that the final message was sent by Robinson, not Remington.\nDefense counsel seemed to realize the oversight, withdrawing his line of questioning and\nabandoning the argument. Robinson's attempt to revive the issue is wholly unpersuasive.\n\n\n       Third, Robinson argues that all exhibits authenticated through Remington should\nhave been excluded due to her propensity to alter electronic messages. Remington sent\ninvestigators logs of her online chat sessions with Trouten in two separate e-mails. The\nfirst time, Remington included only the logs she thought were most relevant to the\ninvestigation. She later sent a complete set of the requested logs. Robinson believes\nRemington \"omitted material information\" and demonstrated \"a pattern of manipulating\ndocuments\" by sending an incomplete set of chat logs in her first e-mail. Judge Anderson\nrejected the argument, finding that Remington never said the first submission was\ncomplete and, in fact, disclosed otherwise. Indeed, in the first e-mail submission,\nRemington made clear she was including only a selection of her chat logs with Trouten.\nOnce again, Judge Anderson's finding is supported by substantial competent evidence.\n\n\n       Finally, Robinson argues State's Exhibits 11 and 12 are unreliable because the\nState redacted header information showing the e-mails had been forwarded to it by\nRemington. However, the defense received unredacted versions of these e-mails during\ndiscovery and nothing prevented counsel from using them on cross-examination.\n                                             264\n\fRemington's testimony confirmed the redacted versions of the e-mails were true and\naccurate copies of the original messages on her computer, and Robinson does not suggest\notherwise. In fact, in his brief, Robinson compares a redacted version of an e-mail to the\nunredacted version, and the content of the two messages is identical.\n\n\n       Remington's testimony and other corroborating evidence authenticated State's\nExhibits 4, 5, 11, and 12. Robinson's arguments founded on immaterial, technical\ndeviations in the writings failed to establish a genuine issue as to their accuracy. Such\narguments went to the weight, not the admissibility, of the evidence. See Gagliardi, 506\nF.3d at 151; United States v. Tank, 200 F.3d 627, 630 (9th Cir. 2000); Purdy, 459 Mass.\nat 451; State v. Bell, 145 Ohio Misc. 2d 55, 67, ¶ 34, 882 N.E.2d 502 (2008), aff'd 2009\nWL 1395857, at *5 ¶ 31 (Ohio App. 2009) (unpublished opinion); Commonwealth v.\nKoch, ___ Pa. ___, 106 A.3d 705, 712-14 (Pa. 2014).\n\n\n              b. E-mails Sent to or from Tammi Taylor\n\n\n       Robinson next challenges the admission of State's Exhibits 13 to 16, which were e-\nmails sent to and from Trouten's friend, Tammi Taylor.\n\n\n       Prior to admitting these exhibits, Remington and Taylor testified that they were\nfriends of Trouten who shared an interest in BDS&M and talked regularly, often via\nonline chat messaging. In March 2000, Remington told Taylor she had been\ncommunicating with James Turner. Taylor jokingly told Remington to ask Turner if he\nknew any other available masters. Remington did just that, asking Robinson, posing as\nTurner, whether he knew of someone interested in serving as a master in a BDS&M\nrelationship with her friend Taylor. Robinson, posing as Turner, told Remington that\n\"Tom\" was interested and gave Remington \"Tom's\" e-mail address to pass on to Taylor.\nRemington told Taylor to contact \"Tom\" at \"preipo@usa.net.\"\n                                            265\n\f       Taylor sent an e-mail to \"Tom\" at this e-mail address, expressing her interest in a\nBDS&M relationship. Taylor received a response from \"Tom,\" identified as State's\nExhibit 13. The exhibit is a printout of an e-mail message from a person at\npreipo@usa.net. In the e-mail, the author provides some personal background\ninformation and outlines his rules and expectations as a master in BDS&M relationships.\nThe message is signed \"T.\" Taylor testified State's Exhibit 13 was a true and accurate\ncopy of the e-mail response she received from \"Tom.\"\n\n\n       Robinson objected to the admission of this e-mail because Taylor had forwarded\nthe e-mail to law enforcement officers, who then printed it from their computer system.\nJudge Anderson overruled the objection, explaining he would admit this and other e-mail\nexhibits, provided the witness could confirm accuracy.\n\n\n       Taylor then testified that after receiving this response from \"Tom,\" the two\nmaintained an ongoing e-mail relationship, communicating several times a week until\nRobinson's arrest in June 2000. Taylor identified State's Exhibit 14 as one of the e-mails\nshe received from \"Tom\" at preipo@usa.net. In that e-mail, Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\"\ngave Taylor BDS&M training activities to complete as his slave. Taylor confirmed the\nexhibit was a true and accurate copy of the message she received on her Hotmail account.\n\n\n       Taylor testified Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\" later began contacting her by phone.\nRobinson left Taylor a voicemail message, advising Taylor that he was replacing his\npreipo@usa.net address with a new account, mbdsm@hotmail.com. On May 28, 2000,\nTaylor received an e-mail from this new address, identified as State's Exhibit 15. In the\nmessage, Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\" asked Taylor to meet him in Kansas City. This\ntime, the e-mail was signed \"MASTER.\" Based on this testimony, Judge Anderson\nadmitted State's Exhibits 14 and 15.\n                                            266\n\f       Before accepting Robinson's invitation to meet him in Kansas City, Taylor asked\n\"Tom\" for a reference from a former submissive/slave. Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\" told\nTaylor she could talk to one of his former slaves at slavedancer@hotmail.com. Taylor\nsent an e-mail to the slavedancer address, explaining that \"Tom\" had given her this e-mail\naddress to learn more about him. Taylor received a response from this e-mail address,\nidentified as State's Exhibit 16, in which Robinson, posing as slavedancer, responded to\neach of Taylor's questions. Taylor confirmed the content was a true and accurate copy of\nthe message she originally received on her computer. The message refers to \"Tom\" as\n\"MASTER,\" just as \"Tom\" signed his name in Exhibit 15.\n\n\n       Additional record evidence corroborates the accuracy of these exhibits. When law\nenforcement searched Robinson's Olathe residence, they found a note with the\npreipo@usa.net address written on it. They also found a list of e-mail addresses and\npasswords, including slavedancer@hotmail.com, written on a sheet of legal paper, along\nwith e-mails confirming Robinson's registration of the slavedancer address on several e-\nmail servers. Taylor testified that her ongoing communication with \"Tom\" ceased after\nRobinson's arrest on June 2, 2000.\n\n\n       Robinson again highlights minor, technical variances, such as the location of caret\nsymbols on one of the e-mails, as evidence of possible alteration but does not specifically\ncontrovert Taylor's testimony or the additional circumstances corroborating the\nauthenticity of the messages. Taylor's testimony, along with the distinctive characteristics\nand subject matter of these interrelated messages, provide substantial competent evidence\nsupporting Judge Anderson's rulings on State's Exhibits 13 to 16. See Hill, 290 Kan. at\n366 (note properly authenticated where it included distinctive language and content\ncommon to defendant); see also Safavian, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 40 (e-mails authenticated\n\n\n                                            267\n\fwhere they included distinctive characteristics and addressed topics pertinent to parties'\ncommunications).\n\n\n              c. E-mail Sent to Chidester\n\n\n       Robinson argues the State failed to properly authenticate State's Exhibit 20, a copy\nof an e-mail sent from Trouten's Hotmail account to several family members, including\nTrouten's aunt, Marshalla Chidester, because the State redacted the header information\nshowing that Chidester had forwarded the e-mail to them.\n\n\n       However, Chidester testified the exhibit was identical to the e-mail she received\non her computer. Robinson did not controvert this testimony. Other evidence introduced\nafter Judge Anderson admitted State's Exhibit 20 corroborated its authenticity. For\nexample, Chidester was convinced the e-mail was fraudulent because the word choices,\nstyle, and format were not consistent with Trouten's writing. Also, when law enforcement\nofficers searched Robinson's Olathe storage unit, they found a contact list Trouten had\nprepared with Chidester's assistance that included e-mail addresses for all four recipients\nof State's Exhibit 20. Law enforcement also seized e-mails confirming that Trouten had\ngiven her login and password information to Robinson, including the information to\naccess the Hotmail account used to send State's Exhibit 20. We hold there was no error.\n\n\n              d. Lewicka E-mails\n\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge erred by admitting three e-mail exchanges\nbetween Izabela Lewicka and her father, Andrzej, admitted as State's Exhibits 69 to 71.\nRobinson challenges the exhibits because they contain e-mail strings rather than\nsegregated messages admitted as separate exhibits.\n\n\n                                            268\n\f      Andrzej confirmed the accuracy of these exhibits, and Robinson does not\ncontrovert this testimony. Judge Anderson's rulings are supported by substantial\ncompetent evidence, and we find no error in the admission of these exhibits.\n\n\n             e. E-mails Seized Pursuant to Search Warrant\n\n\n      Finally, Robinson argues Judge Anderson erroneously admitted State's Exhibits\n19EE, 19NN-RR, 19TT-WW, 19XX, 52O, and 52Q because they were introduced\nthrough law enforcement officers rather than the parties to the messages.\n\n\n      Robinson's challenge to State's Exhibit 19EE is plainly without merit. Detective\nLayman testified this e-mail from Remington to Robinson, posing as Turner or JT, was\nseized during the search of Robinson's Olathe storage locker. The body of the message is\nidentical to State's Exhibit 11, which was authenticated independently through\nRemington's proffer. See United States v. Safavian, 435 F. Supp. 2d 3d 36, 40 (D.D.C.\n2006) (e-mails may be authenticated by other specimens that have already been\nindependently authenticated).\n\n\n      State's Exhibits 19NN-RR, 19TT-XX, 52O, and 52Q are a series of e-mail\ncommunications between Robinson and Trouten. The messages were sent to or from\nTrouten at her \"peka@tdi.net\" e-mail address and most include conversations touching on\nvarious BDS&M topics.\n\n\n      Detective Layman testified that law enforcement seized State's Exhibits 19NN-RR\nand 19TT-XX from inside a brown briefcase during the search of Robinson's storage\nlocker in Olathe. During this search, law enforcement also seized a number of items\nbelonging to Trouten. Detective Owsley testified that law enforcement seized State's\nExhibits 52O and 52Q from inside a black, soft-sided case inside a closet during the\n                                           269\n\fsearch of Robinson's residence in Olathe. This testimony was sufficient to authenticate\nthe documents found in Robinson's possession or under his control. See United States v.\nWake, 948 F.2d 1422, 1434 (5th Cir. 1991) (law enforcement officer testimony\ndescribing the circumstances in which writings were seized from defendant's possession\nor control adequately supported finding of authentication); United States v. Alisal Water\nCorp., 114 F. Supp. 2d 927, 933 (N.D. Cal. 2000) (rejecting authentication challenge to\ndocuments EPA agents seized from laboratory; declaration of EPA agent who described\ndocuments' seizure and chain of custody adequately authenticated writings).\n\n\nAdmission of Other Crimes or Civil Wrongs Evidence\n\n      Robinson argues the district judge admitted evidence or allowed testimony\nconcerning his prior crimes or civil wrongs in violation of K.S.A. 60-445 and 60-455.\nRobinson also claims the district judge erroneously denied a motion for mistrial in\nconnection with the testimony of one of the State's witnesses.\n\n\n      1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n      The admissibility of all other crimes and civil wrongs evidence is governed by\nK.S.A. 60-455. State v. Gunby, 282 Kan. 39, 57, 144 P.3d 647 (2006). We have adopted a\nmultistep analysis for determining the admission of such evidence and defined the\nstandard of review applicable to each step:\n\n\n              \"Determining whether evidence was properly admitted pursuant to K.S.A. 60-\n      455 requires several steps. The appellate court must determine that the fact to be proven\n      is material, e.g., concerning intent, motive, knowledge, or identity. In other words, the\n      court must determine whether the fact has a legitimate and effective bearing on the\n      decision in the case. The appellate court standard of review for materiality is de novo.\n      The appellate court must also determine whether the material fact is disputed, i.e., the\n      element or elements being considered must be substantially at issue in the case. The\n                                                  270\n\f       appellate court must also determine whether the evidence presented is relevant to prove\n       the disputed material fact, i.e., whether it has any tendency in reason to prove that fact.\n       The appellate court reviews relevance—in particular, the probative element—of K.S.A.\n       60-455 evidence for abuse of discretion. The burden of proof is on the party alleging the\n       discretion is abused. The court must also determine whether the probative value of the\n       evidence outweighs the potential for producing undue prejudice. The appellate standard\n       for reviewing this determination is abuse of discretion.\" State v. Hollingsworth, 289 Kan.\n       1250, Syl. ¶ 6, 221 P.3d 1122 (2009).\n\n\n       Additionally, as it relates to the denial of Robinson's motion for mistrial, we\nreview this issue for an abuse of discretion. State v. Warrior, 294 Kan. 484, 505, 277\nP.3d 1111 (2012).\n\n\n       2. Did admission of Carlos Ibarra's testimony violate K.S.A 60-455?\n\n       During the State's direct examination, Carlos Ibarra, a maintenance employee,\ntestified that Robinson frequently talked about his girlfriend and asked Ibarra to find a\n\"Mexican woman . . . for him.\" Defense counsel objected, but the district judge overruled\nafter the State explained the evidence was relevant to establishing Robinson's common\nscheme or course of conduct. Ibarra then testified that Robinson wanted him to find \"a\ngood looking woman from Mexico\" and that he would lease an apartment for her and\nhandle her immigration issues, provided they were sexually compatible. Ibarra also\ntestified that Robinson showed him a nude picture of a \"girlfriend\" depicted in a\nBDS&M-themed pose.\n\n\n       Robinson argues this testimony, particularly Robinson's request to be set up with\n\"a good looking woman from Mexico,\" violated K.S.A. 60-455 because the implication\nwas that he sought an additional victim to exploit sexually and then murder, improperly\ndemonstrating propensity to commit the charged crimes. At trial, Robinson objected only\nto the relevance of Ibarra's testimony, but K.S.A. 21-4627(b) and K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 21-\n                                                    271\n\f6619(b) compel our review of the challenge under K.S.A. 60-455. State v. Cheever, 295\nKan. 229, 241, 284 P.3d 1007 (2012), vacated and remanded on other grounds 571 U.S.\n___, 134 S. Ct. 596, 187 L. Ed. 2d 519 (2013).\n\n\n       Robinson's argument is unavailing. Contrary to defendant's assertion, Ibarra's\ntestimony was relevant. It tended to prove or corroborate other evidence that Robinson\nlured women to Kansas with offers of travel, employment, or other personal or financial\nsupport with the intent to exploit them financially or sexually. This fact was material\nbecause it supported the State's theory that Robinson's luring and exploitation were\ncomponents of his common scheme or course of conduct under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\n\n\n       More importantly, the challenged testimony falls outside the scope of K.S.A. 60-\n455. Under its plain language, the statute specifically limits application of this provision\n\"'to situations involving \"evidence that a person committed a crime or civil wrong on a\nspecified occasion\" to infer a person has the disposition or propensity to \"commit[ ]\nanother crime or civil wrong on another specified occasion.\"'\" (Emphasis added.) State v.\nMolina, 299 Kan. 651, 658, 325 P.3d 1142 (2014) (quoting State v. Breeden, 297 Kan.\n567, 577, 304 P.3d 660 [2013]). Ibarra's testimony did not establish that Robinson\ncommitted a crime or civil wrong on a specified occasion. Robinson's request that Ibarra\nset him up with another woman was not a crime or civil wrong.\n\n\n       Robinson argues this testimony implied he made the request in hopes of luring a\nwoman from Mexico and then murdering her. However, K.S.A. 60-455 \"is not triggered\nby juror speculation, but by evidence of prior crimes committed by a defendant.\" State v.\nConley, No. 94,096, 2006 WL 2129127, at *3 (Kan. App. 2006) (unpublished opinion);\n\n\n       Robinson relies on State v. Warledo, 286 Kan. 927, 942, 190 P.3d 937 (2008), to\nargue that any prior acts testimony is excluded under K.S.A. 60-455, so long as it creates\n                                             272\n\fan inference of propensity to commit the charged offense. The argument flies in the face\nof the plain language of K.S.A. 60-455, which requires exclusion only where the\nevidence concerning a prior act constitutes a crime or civil wrong. Also, defendant\nmisconstrues Warledo. There, the State argued K.S.A. 60-455 did not apply because\ndefendant's prior acts did not constitute criminal offenses. We rejected the argument,\nexpressly finding the acts in question \"were criminal acts.\" 286 Kan. at 942. Having\ndetermined the witness testified to defendant's prior crimes, we then analyzed whether\nsuch crimes inferred propensity to commit the charged offenses. Here, defendant failed to\nclear the first hurdle, as Ibarra's testimony did not establish that Robinson committed a\nprior criminal act.\n\n\n       Robinson also cites State v. Hall, 246 Kan. 728, 793 P.2d 737 (1990), overruled in\npart on other grounds by Ferguson v. State, 276 Kan. 428, 78 P.3d 40 (2003), in support\nof the same argument. However, in Hall, defendant's prior acts clearly constituted a\ncriminal offense; namely, conspiracy to commit murder. 246 Kan. at 738-40. In fact, the\nState did not dispute that Hall's prior conduct constituted a criminal offense. Robinson's\nreliance on Hall, like his reliance on Warledo, is misplaced.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 60-455 does not bar admission of Ibarra's testimony because he did not\ntestify to any prior crimes. See Molina, 299 Kan. at 658 (evidence of gang membership\nand expectation that members engage in crime is not evidence that a particular person\ncommitted a particular crime on a particular occasion and is not excluded under K.S.A.\n60-455); State v. Winston, 281 Kan. 1114, 1135, 135 P.3d 1072 (2006) (same); State v.\nGaines, 260 Kan. 752, 766, 926 P.2d 641 (1996) (\"[K.S.A. 60-455] does not apply to the\ntoe sucking evidence because toe sucking is not a crime\"); State v. Sexton, 256 Kan. 344,\n349, 886 P.2d 811 (1994) (K.S.A. 60-455 did not apply because \"sexual bondage\nbetween consenting adults is [not] a crime.\"); State v. Reves, No. 98,233, 2008 WL\n2796461, at *1-2 (Kan. App. 2008) (unpublished opinion) (\"the selling of scrap material\n                                            273\n\fis not a crime and . . . would not be subject to K.S.A. 60-455\"), rev. denied 287 Kan. 768\n(2009). We see no error.\n\n\n       3. Did admission of Jean Glines' testimony violate K.S.A 60-455?\n\n       Again, Glines was a former employee of Nancy Robinson at a mobile home park\nin Independence, Missouri. Glines met Robinson while working for his wife. In January\n1997, Glines moved to California and her marriage later dissolved. Robinson told Glines\nhe and Nancy had also divorced, and they began a long-distance relationship,\ncommunicating by phone, letters, and e-mails.\n\n\n       In March 2000, Robinson asked Glines to mail some letters for him from\nCalifornia. Glines agreed to mail the letters if Robinson stopped calling her. The\nprosecutor asked Glines why she wanted Robinson to stop calling her, and she explained:\n\n\n       \"He was wanting me to come back here and live with him, work for him and totally\n       abandon, so to speak—or never speak to any family again. As to the fact that my kids\n       were in California, I was out there with them. I guess I talked about them a lot when we\n       talked on the phone. He didn't seem to care for the fact that I had other interests besides\n       him. He wanted me to give up my family and my grandkids or my grandchild and come\n       and work with him and live with him.\"\n\n\n       Defense counsel lodged no objection to Glines' testimony. Robinson now argues\nGlines' testimony, particularly her comments that Robinson asked her to move back to\nKansas, live with him, work for him, and never speak to her family again, violated K.S.A.\n60-455. Once again, the testimony did not establish that Robinson committed a particular\ncrime or civil wrong on a particular occasion and falls outside the scope of the statute.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   274\n\f       Robinson argues adultery is a crime under Kansas law, K.S.A. 21-3507, and that\nGlines' testimony regarding his solicitation to commit adultery constituted an attempt to\ncommit that crime. Yet Glines' testimony did not clearly establish Robinson's solicitation\nto commit adultery. Even if it had, mere solicitation to commit adultery is not an attempt\nto commit the crime. See State v. Bowles, 70 Kan. 821, 835, 79 P. 726 (1905) (citing\nState v. Butler, 8 Wash. 194, 35 P. 1093 [1894]). More importantly, however, this offense\ndoes not imply defendant's propensity to commit capital murder or the other charged\noffenses and is not barred under K.S.A. 60-455. See State v. Anthony, 282 Kan. 201, 214,\n145 P.3d 1 (2006) (evidence of defendant's prior civil eviction and restraining order did\nnot imply propensity to commit first-degree premeditated murder, testimony falls beyond\nlimitations of K.S.A. 60-455).\n\n\n       Independently, Robinson argues Glines' testimony introduced collateral facts that\nwere irrelevant under K.S.A. 60-401(b). However, Glines' testimony explained her\nmotivation to comply with Robinson's rather unusual request to mail letters from a\nCalifornia address, evidence that supported the State's theory that Robinson sent\nfraudulent letters to the victims' family members as part of his common scheme or course\nof conduct under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). We cannot conclude from the undeveloped\nrecord created by the absence of objection that this testimony included irrelevant\ncollateral facts. See State v. Vaughn, 254 Kan. 191, Syl. ¶ 6, 865 P.2d 207 (1993)\n(\"evidence of collateral facts must be confined to the issues, but need not bear directly on\nthem\").\n\n\n       4. Did testimony of tools seized during Linn County search violate K.S.A 60-455?\n\n\n       During the execution of the warrant to search Robinson's Linn County property,\nlaw enforcement seized nine hammers, two picks, and a chisel from various locations on\nthe property. Robinson moved in limine to exclude testimony regarding the number of\n                                            275\n\ftools seized. In response, the State argued that it intended to introduce testimony that\nthose items were seized during the search and that experts found no blood, tissue, or other\ntrace evidence on them, but that such items could be cleaned easily. The district judge\ndenied the motion, explaining:\n\n\n               \"It's very relevant; it has probative value; the Court finds little or no prejudicial\n       effect with respect to the numbers that we're dealing with here. Given that we're talking\n       about a rural location and a dwelling that was in the process of being refurbished over a\n       period of time, based upon the testimony I've heard thus far, and it becomes a question of\n       weight.\"\n\n\n       At trial, the medical examiners testified the victims died as a result of blunt force\nbrain trauma inflicted with a hard object, and one medical examiner testified specifically\nthat the injuries were consistent with those inflicted by a hammer. Rundle, a forensic\nchemist with the JOCO Lab, confirmed that nine hammers, two picks, and one chisel\nwere seized for further forensic examination during the Linn County search. Detective\nBooth testified that he looked at these items under a microscope to examine all the\ncrevices and defects on the tools—\"anyplace where blood or tissue would be hiding.\"\nOccasionally he also used a Hemostik to test for the presence of blood. Nevertheless,\nBooth confirmed he found no blood, tissue, or hair on any of these tools.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred by allowing Rundle to testify to the number\nof tools seized during the search because it \"implied some sort of obsession with the type\nof weapon purportedly used to kill Suzette Trouten, as well as the defendant's desire to\nkill yet more women in the same manner and at the same place.\" Clearly, Rundle did not\ntestify to a prior crime within the meaning of K.S.A. 60-455, and Judge Anderson did not\nerr in admitting the testimony under this statutory provision.\n\n\n\n                                                    276\n\f       Robinson also claims that Rundle's testimony was improper because there was not\na sufficient connection between the tools and the defendant or the charges against him.\nThe tools were not admitted as physical evidence. Instead, the State's witnesses merely\ntestified to the fact of their seizure and subsequent testing for trace evidence. Even so, our\nprecedent addressing the admission of physical evidence provides useful guidance.\n\n\n       \"The admissibility of physical evidence is based on its relevance in connection\nwith the accused and the crime charged. Physical evidence should be admitted unless it is\nclearly irrelevant. The jury may attribute such weight and effect as it sees fit. [Citation\nomitted.]\" State v. Trammell, 278 Kan. 265, 282, 92 P.3d 1101 (2004); State v. Whitesell,\n270 Kan. 259, 277, 13 P.3d 887 (2000) (same); see State v. Mitchell, 220 Kan. 700, 704,\n556 P.2d 874 (1976) (weapon properly admitted where witness testified it looked similar\nto the one used in the crime; evidence highlighting difference between admitted weapon\nand one described from the scene went to weight, not admissibility).\n\n\n       The record establishes a logical connection between the tools, defendant, and the\ncapital murder charges. The bodies of Lewicka and Trouten were recovered inside metal\ndrums located on Robinson's Linn County property. Trace bloodstains inside Robinson's\ntrailer on the property matched the DNA of victims Trouten and Lewicka. The medical\nexaminers opined that Trouten and Lewicka were killed as a result of blunt-force trauma\nto the head inflicted by a hard object. The tools were seized in close physical and\ntemporal proximity to the discovery of the bodies and the trace evidence. Based on this\nrecord evidence, Judge Anderson properly admitted the testimony. See State v. Gardner,\n264 Kan. 95, 104-05, 955 P.2d 1199 (1998) (no abuse of discretion in admitting jeans and\nboots where witnesses testified they saw defendant in similar attire around time of\nmurder and blood spots tested positive for human blood; evidence that clothing did not\nbelong to defendant went to weight, not admissibility of evidence).\n\n\n                                             277\n\f       Robinson relies on State v. Bornholdt, 261 Kan. 644, 658, 932 P.2d 964 (1997),\ndisapproved on other grounds by State v. Marsh, 278 Kan. 520, 102 P.3d 445 (2004),\nrev'd on other grounds by Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d\n429 (2006), to argue the tools were not logically connected to the crimes. There the State\nintroduced testimony that drugs were taken from defendant's car at the time of his arrest.\nThe district judge allowed this testimony as res gestae because it showed defendant's\ninvolvement with drugs in a case where the State's theory was that defendant murdered\nthe victim in retaliation for testifying in another drug case. However, we held that the\ntestimony was \"clearly not part of the res gestae\" because the drugs were seized 10 days\nafter the commission of the charged offenses and had no direct connection to them.\nBornholdt, 261 Kan. at 659-60. Here the victims were killed by blunt-force trauma\ninflicted by a hard object consistent with the tools seized on Robinson's property. These\ntools were recovered close in time and proximity to the bodies and trace evidence of the\nvictims. Bornholdt is distinguishable.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor's proffer for the admission of Rundle's testimony\nwas misleading because experts did not testify that blood could be removed easily from\nthe tools, and evidence admitted under such false pretenses violated his right to due\nprocess. However, this argument assumes Judge Anderson's ruling was dependent on the\nprosecutor's proffer that crime lab experts would testify that hammers can be cleaned\neasily. This was not the case. Judge Anderson found the testimony was clearly relevant\nbased on the totality of the circumstances. Nothing suggests the admission of this\ntestimony was dependent on the prosecutor's proffer regarding the expert's testimony.\nFurthermore, defense counsel, not the prosecution, elicited the testimony from the State's\nexperts on cross-examination that it would be difficult to wash away blood from certain\ncrevices of certain hammers. Nothing in the record suggests the State anticipated this\ntestimony. Moreover, by establishing that forensic investigators found no trace evidence,\ndespite extensive investigation and the difficulty in removing blood from certain tools,\n                                            278\n\fRobinson demonstrated that Rundle's testimony gave rise to no adverse inferences.\nRobinson fails to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n       5. Did Loretta Mattingly's testimony compel a mistrial?\n\n       Robinson believes the trial court should have granted his motion for mistrial after\nwitness Loretta Mattingly failed to testify in accordance with the prosecutor's proffer. To\nunderstand the nuances of the challenge, a summary of the procedural facts and\nbackground is in order.\n\n\n       Mattingly managed the rental of storage units at Stor-Mor For Less in Raymore,\nMissouri (Stor-Mor). In December 1993, Robinson rented unit F-10 at Stor-Mor under\nBonner's name and maintained possession of the unit until Summer 1996. In January\n1994, Robinson leased a second unit at Stor-Mor, unit E-2, under Bonner's name and\nmaintained possession through his arrest in June 2000.\n\n\n       At preliminary hearing, Mattingly testified on cross-examination that she never\nreceived any complaints from other renters about noises or smells from Robinson's\nstorage units. On redirect, Mattingly clarified she had never received any complaints\nrelated to unit E-2, but when the prosecutor asked about unit F-10, Mattingly said:\n\n\n       \"There was a problem with one of the units behind [F-10] of a mattress that had gotten\n       damaged, and I did walk by and see Mr. Robinson cleaning out F10. And when the other\n       person behind went to move out, there was stuff all over a mattress that had bleeded [sic]\n       through and he told me it was a raccoon. . . . A raccoon had gotten in there.\"\n\n\n       At trial, the State intended to establish that Robinson stored the barrels containing\nthe bodies of Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith, and Beverly Bonner in unit F-10 but moved\nthem to unit E-2 and wrapped them in plastic after they began to leak. To support this\n                                                  279\n\fargument, the State planned to have Mattingly testify to the odor or property damage\ncomplaint concerning unit F-10, in addition to having police testify that the barrels found\nin unit E-2 had been wrapped in large plastic sheeting with kitty litter placed along the\nbottom to form a dam that would contain seepage of biological fluids.\n\n\n       At trial, the defense objected when the prosecutor asked Mattingly if she received\nany complaints related to Robinson's lease of unit F-10, arguing the testimony called for\nhearsay and was irrelevant and prejudicial. Prosecutor Welch proffered outside the\npresence of the jury that Mattingly would testify that she received an odor complaint\nfrom a lessee of a unit adjacent to unit F-10, that she told Robinson about it, that she saw\ndefendant cleaning up some kind of bloody fluid outside unit F-10 soon thereafter, and\nthat defendant told her a dead raccoon was the source. Prosecutor Welch argued jurors\ncould reasonably infer from the proffered testimony that Robinson previously stored the\nbarrels containing the victims' bodies in unit F-10; they leaked, causing another renter to\ncomplain of an odor; and Robinson cleaned up the seepage and moved the barrels to unit\nE-2, carefully wrapping them in plastic to avoid any further incident. The prosecutor\noffered Mattingly's testimony regarding the complaint to explain her future action, i.e.,\ninforming Robinson that she had received a complaint, not for the truth of the matter\nasserted. The judge asked, \"[S]he's going to testify that she encountered him cleaning out\nthe lockers?\" Prosecutor Welch responded, \"Yes, and that his explanation was there was a\ndead raccoon in there; from his mouth, there was a dead raccoon in there.\"\n\n\n       Judge Anderson overruled Robinson's objections, allowing Mattingly to \"testify in\naccordance with the proffer.\" The district judge provided a limiting instruction so the jury\nwould not consider the lessee's complaint for the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n\n       After the jury had been instructed, the prosecutor conducted the following\nexamination of Mattingly:\n                                            280\n\f       \"Q.     Did you ever receive a complaint about F10?\n       \"A.     I did when somebody was moving out.\n       \"Q.     All right. And what was the complaint?\n       \"A.     Was that something had leaked through from one of the other units and ruined a\n       mattress.\n       \"Q.     All right. And who did you notify about that?\n       \"A.     Mr. Robinson.\n       \"Q.     Okay. And what did you tell him?\n       \"A.     I told him that whatever he had used cleaning his unit had leaked through to\n       another one.\n       \"Q.     And after you told him this, did you see Mr. Robinson at that unit?\n       \"A.     I had seen him before.\n       \"Q.     Okay. And what had you seen him doing?\n       \"A.     Cleaning something out of there with—like some kind of soap solution.\"\n\n\n       At this juncture, the defense renewed its objection, arguing the testimony was\ninconsistent with the proffer because Mattingly testified that she observed Robinson\ncleaning unit F-10 before the complaint, not after, as suggested in the proffer, and the\nliquid was a cleaning solution, not a bloody substance, as stated in the proffer. Robinson\nalso moved for a mistrial based on the improper inference that Robinson had dead bodies\nin barrels in unit F-10. Judge Anderson found Mattingly's testimony was inconsistent\nwith the proffer and unreliable. He denied the motion for mistrial but did instruct the jury\nto disregard Mattingly's testimony on the subject.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecution \"misrepresented its own evidence\" in the proffer,\nand the district judge's refusal to declare a mistrial left the jury with \"the distinct\nimpression that Mr. Robinson had killed or wished to kill yet other women, stuffed them\ninto yet other barrels, and kept them in yet another storage unit—all on the basis of a\nfalse proffer from the State.\"\n\n                                                  281\n\f       To warrant a mistrial, the trial court must decide if there is a fundamental failure\nof the proceeding, and if so, whether it is possible to continue without an injustice. See\nK.S.A. 22-3423(c); State v. Ward, 292 Kan, 541, 550, 256 P.3d 801 (2011), cert. denied\n132 S. Ct. 1594 (2012). Robinson's claim does not warrant relief under this standard.\n\n\n       First, there was no fundamental failure of the proceeding. A close examination of\nMattingly's preliminary hearing testimony and the State's proffer undercuts Robinson's\nclaim that prosecutor Welch intentionally misrepresented Mattingly's testimony in her\nproffer to the court. Prosecutor Welch proffered that Mattingly, consistent with her\nstatements during preliminary hearing, would testify that (1) she received an odor\ncomplaint regarding unit F-10; (2) she informed Robinson; (3) a short time later, she\nobserved him cleaning unit F-10 to remove a bloody, \"yucky\" fluid; and (4) Robinson's\nexplanation for the fluid was that there was a dead raccoon in his unit. Mattingly's\npreliminary hearing testimony was generally consistent with the proffer.\n\n\n       The most significant variance among Mattingly's preliminary hearing testimony,\nthe prosecutor's proffer, and Mattingly's trial testimony concerned the timing or sequence\nof these events—specifically, the point in time at which Mattingly observed Robinson\ncleaning unit F-10. The precise sequence of events was important because if Mattingly\nobserved Robinson cleaning unit F-10 subsequent to the lessee's complaint, the logical\ninference was that some other foreign substance caused the mattress stain, i.e., biological\nfluid from a raccoon, according to Robinson, or seepage from the barrels holding the\nbodies of the victims, according to the State. However, if Mattingly observed Robinson\ncleaning unit F-10 with a cleaning solution before the lessee's complaint, then the\ninference was that the cleaning solution itself stained the mattress. As such, the sequence\nof the events determined whether Mattingly's testimony was inculpatory or benign.\n\n\n                                            282\n\f       It was not until Mattingly's direct examination at trial that she clarified that she\nhad first observed Robinson cleaning unit F-10 and then, at a later point in time, received\nthe complaint from the third-party lessee. Once this testimony came out and the sequence\nof events was made clear, the reasonable inference was that the cleaning solution\nRobinson had used, not seepage of biological fluid from a dead raccoon or bodies in\nbarrels, damaged the adjacent lessee's mattress. In fact, Mattingly testified that she told\nRobinson that his cleaning solution had leaked through to the adjacent unit. These\ncircumstances demonstrate the prosecutor did not intentionally or maliciously\nmisrepresent Mattingly's testimony in her proffer. They also demonstrate that Mattingly's\ntestimony was not prejudicial and, in fact, worked to Robinson's benefit.\n\n\n       Not only was Mattingly's trial testimony stripped of the inculpatory content\ndescribed in the State's proffer, but also the district judge instructed the jury to disregard\nit altogether. \"The general rule is that an admonition to the jury normally cures the\nprejudice from an improper admission of evidence.\" State v. Navarro, 272 Kan. 573, 582,\n35 P.3d 802 (2001). \"Accordingly, where the trial court sustains an objection and\nadmonishes the jury to disregard the objectionable testimony, reversal is not required\nunless the remarks are so prejudicial as to be incurable.\" State v. Gleason, 277 Kan. 624,\n642, 88 P.3d 218 (2004). Mattingly's trial testimony was not of the type immune to such\ninstruction.\n\n\n       Because there was no fundamental failure in the proceedings, Judge Anderson's\ndecision to proceed resulted in no injustice. See State v. Albright, 283 Kan. 418, 426-27,\n153 P.3d 497 (2007) (no error in denying mistrial where prosecutor's violation of limine\norder was not malicious and had little weight on minds of jurors).\n\n\n\n\n                                              283\n\f       6. Did Judge Anderson err in allowing the medical examiner's testimony\n       regarding defensive wounds?\n\n       Jackson County Medical Examiner Thomas Young performed autopsies on the\nthree victims found inside barrels at Robinson's Missouri storage unit. Young testified to\nvarious injuries he observed during Sheila Faith's autopsy, concluding that the cause of\ndeath was the result of blunt-force trauma to the head. Young also testified Sheila Faith\nhad sustained a fracture to her right ulna at a point located close to her wrist. After\nidentifying this injury, prosecutor Morrison asked, \"Would that be consistent with a\ndefensive wound?\" Defense counsel objected, arguing the question called for speculation.\nJudge Anderson allowed defense counsel to voir dire the expert.\n\n\n       The defense made the following inquiries during voir dire of Young:\n\n\n       \"[COUNSEL]: Do you have any idea where that hand or arm was at the time\n                      that injury was inflicted?\n       ....\n       \"[YOUNG]:      Are you asking what was the position of the hand? No, I don't know.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: It may have been at the side as likely as raised (indicating)?\n       \"[YOUNG]:       Sure.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: So the truth is you don't know whether that injury was inflicted in any\n                      type of defensive posture by the victim or not, do you?\n       \"[YOUNG]:       It is consistent with a defensive, warding off a defensive blow. Could I\n                      tell in and of itself that was the case, I can't tell. I can say it's consistent\n                      though.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: It could be?\n       \"[YOUNG]:      It's consistent with it.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: You have no personal knowledge of that, nor does your examination\n                      reveal the position of the arm at the time that it was broken; is that true?\n       \"[YOUNG]:      Okay. In terms of personal knowledge, I wasn't there at the time. I just\n                      performed an autopsy. In terms of the position that the arms or hand was\n\n                                                   284\n\f                     in at the time the blow was inflicted, that's not something that you would\n                     determine from an autopsy.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: You did not determine that?\n       \"[YOUNG]:     As I said, it's not something that you would determine from an\n                     autopsy.\"\n\n\nThe defense renewed its objection. The district judge overruled it, reasoning the question\nwas whether the injury was consistent with a defensive blow, not whether the injury was\nin fact a defensive wound, and the challenge went to the weight, not the admissibility, of\nthe testimony.\n\n\n       The State had established Young's education, training, and experience on direct\nexamination, which demonstrated his competence to render an opinion on the subject.\nDefense counsel's voir dire did not otherwise challenge these qualifications. In this\nregard, Young was sufficiently qualified from his prior knowledge and experience to\ntestify on this subject. See K.S.A. 60-419.\n\n\n       Robinson suggests the testimony was not useful to the jury. However, the defense\ndid not object to Young's testimony on this basis at trial, and therefore, the record\nprovides no basis in fact to support this new theory of error on appeal. We cannot say that\nno reasonable jurist would have allowed Young's testimony. See Moore v. Associated\nMaterial & Supply Co., 263 Kan. 226, 244, 948 P.2d 652 (1997) (trial court granted\nbroad discretion regarding admission of expert testimony); see also Caldwell v. State, 245\nGa. App. 630, 632, 538 S.E.2d 531 (2000) (no error in permitting officer to \"testify about\nher observations of the victim's wounds, to make an inference based on her training and\non her observations of the wounds, and to opine that the victim's wounds were consistent\nwith 'defensive' ones, a conclusion that is beyond the ken of the average layman\"). Thus\nwe find no abuse of discretion. See Carr, 300 Kan. at 223-24 (court reviews decision to\nadmit or exclude expert testimony for abuse of discretion).\n                                                285\n\fAllegedly Disparate Rulings on Similarly Situated Hearsay Objections\n\n       Robinson claims the district judge violated his substantive due process rights by\ndenying his hearsay objections when they were similarly situated to those lodged by the\nState and sustained by Judge Anderson.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       Substantive due process protects individuals from arbitrary state action. Darling v.\nKansas Water Office, 245 Kan. 45, 51, 774 P.2d 941 (1989). To satisfy substantive due\nprocess requirements, the court's actions must not be applied to parties in an arbitrary or\ncapricious manner. Wesley Medical Center v. McCain, 226 Kan. 263, 266, 597 P.2d 1088\n(1979).\n\n\n       2. Did Judge Anderson's hearsay rulings violate due process?\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge failed to apply the hearsay rules consistently\nbetween similarly situated challenges of the defendant and the State. Specifically,\nRobinson relies on two examples to support his substantive due process challenge.\n\n\n       First, Robinson points to Judge Anderson's ruling allowing Kathy Klingensmith,\nStasi's sister, and Overland Park Sergeant Ronald Wissel to testify over defense objection\nthat a desk clerk at the Roadway Inn told Klingensmith that Robinson, not John Osborne,\nhad paid for Lisa Stasi's motel room. The State argued, and Judge Anderson agreed, that\nthe testimony was offered to explain Klingensmith's future actions; specifically, her\ndecision to file a missing persons report. Yet, during the defense's questioning of Wissel,\nJudge Anderson sustained the State's hearsay objection and did not allow him to testify to\nthe names of other persons of interest in the Stasi investigation, even though such\n                                            286\n\ftestimony, according to Robinson, would have explained Wissel's future investigative\nactions.\n\n\n       Robinson's argument is unsupported by the record. During recross of Wissel, the\ndefense asked if he had completed any independent investigation before handing the case\nover to Detective Scott. Wissel said he had called Robinson's business, Equi II. Defense\ncounsel then asked, \"And you got names, several names, from your investigation at that\nlocation; is that correct?\" Wissel agreed. Defense counsel began listing the names \"Jim\nLions, Bob—,\" at which point the State lodged its hearsay objection and the district judge\nsustained it. The defense made no proffer or argument in support of its line of\nquestioning. It simply moved on. Robinson did not argue the testimony was being elicited\nto explain Wissel's future investigative actions. As such, Robinson fails to establish that\nJudge Anderson's rulings on these competing hearsay objections were similarly situated,\nand we find no due process violation.\n\n\n       In his second example, Robinson compares two allegedly inconsistent rulings\nunder the \"persons present\" hearsay exception in K.S.A. 60-460(a). First, Robinson\nhighlights Judge Anderson's decision to exclude certain testimony from Suzette Trouten's\nformer landlord, John Stapleton. Stapleton testified that Suzette Trouten told him she was\nmoving to Kansas to undergo cancer treatment. Stapleton was also prepared to testify that\nwhen he informed Carolyn Trouten of this fact, she instructed him not to share this\ninformation with law enforcement. When Robinson attempted to elicit this testimony\nfrom Stapleton, the district judge sustained the State's hearsay objection. Robinson argues\nthis ruling is inconsistent with Judge Anderson's decision to allow Detective Brown to\ntestify, over Robinson's hearsay objection, to Carolyn Trouten's declarations concerning\nthe last time she spoke to her daughter.\n\n\n\n\n                                            287\n\f       The record confirms that Judge Anderson did not disparately apply the \"persons\npresent\" hearsay rule under K.S.A. 60-460(a). In interpreting and applying K.S.A. 60-\n460(a) in connection with Brown's testimony, Judge Anderson explained that under the\nperson's present exception, \"as long as the subject matter was inquired into earlier [with\nthe declarant] and there's been an opportunity to cross-examine as to the subject matter,\n[the prosecutor] can go into it [with the third party witness] without it being hearsay.\"\nBrown testified that Carolyn Trouten informed him that she last spoke to Suzette late in\nthe evening of February 29 or during the early morning hours of March 1, 2000. During\ndirect examination, Carolyn Trouten testified to these facts, and she was subject to cross-\nexamination from Robinson. As such, Judge Anderson properly found Brown's testimony\nregarding Carolyn Trouten's declarations were admissible under K.S.A. 60-460(a). In\ncontrast, Carolyn Trouten did not address the subject of Stapleton's testimony during her\ndirect or cross-examination, and therefore, his testimony regarding Carolyn Trouten's\ndeclarations were not admissible under K.S.A. 60-460(a). See State v. Wilson, 35 Kan.\nApp. 2d 333, 338, 130 P.3d 139 (2006) (police officer's testimony regarding declarant's\nstatements improperly admitted where declarant was available but was not called and did\nnot testify to subject of officer's testimony).\n\n\n       The district judge arrived at different rulings between Stapleton and Brown, not\nbecause he applied the rules in an arbitrary or disparate fashion, but because the facts\nsupported different rulings under K.S.A. 60-460(a). We hold there was no due process\nviolation.\n\n\n       Robinson also claims these rulings were invalid under state hearsay rules. Our\nanalysis above suggests otherwise. Judge Anderson's rulings were supported by\nsubstantial competent evidence, and we cannot conclude from the record that no\nreasonable jurist would have agreed with them. We hold there was no abuse of discretion.\n\n\n                                              288\n\f                    9. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE—COUNTS I AND V\n\n       Robinson claims the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's convictions on\nCount I, aggravated kidnapping of Trouten, and Count V, first-degree premeditated\nmurder of Stasi. Independently, he argues the State relied on multiple acts to prove a\nsingle aggravated kidnapping charge and the district court's failure to provide a special\nunanimity instruction constituted clear error.\n\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence Supporting Counts I and V\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n               \"'When sufficiency of evidence is challenged in a criminal case, our standard of\n       review is whether, after review of all the evidence, examined in the light most favorable\n       to the prosecution, we are convinced that a rational factfinder could have found the\n       defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.' [Citations omitted.] 'In reviewing the\n       sufficiency of the evidence, this court will not reweigh the evidence. It is the jury's\n       function, not ours, to weigh the evidence and determine the credibility of witnesses.'\n       [Citations omitted.]\" State v. Cosby, 293 Kan. 121, 133-34, 262 P.3d 285 (2011).\n\n\n       2. Was the State's evidence sufficient to support Robinson's aggravated kidnapping\n       conviction?\n\n       Robinson advances two specific challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting his aggravated kidnapping conviction under Count I. First, he argues the State\nfailed to provide sufficient evidence of a taking by deception. Robinson also claims the\nState failed to prove he took Trouten with specific intent to inflict bodily injury upon her.\n\n\n       At the time Robinson committed the offense, kidnapping included \"the taking or\nconfining of any person, accomplished by force, threat or deception, with intent to hold\nsuch person: . . . (c) to inflict bodily injury or to terrorize the victim or another.\" K.S.A.\n                                                    289\n\f21-3420. The Criminal Code defined \"deception\" as \"knowingly and willfully making a\nfalse statement or representation, express or implied, pertaining to a present or past\nexisting fact.\" K.S.A. 21-3110(5). \"Aggravated kidnapping is kidnapping . . . when\nbodily harm is inflicted upon the person kidnapped.\" K.S.A. 21-3421.\n\n\n       In Count I of the Fourth Amended Complaint, the State alleged:\n\n       \"That between the 12th day of February, 2000, and the 1st day of March, 2000, in the\n       City of Lenexa, County of Johnson, State of Kansas, JOHN EDWARD ROBINSON, SR,\n       did then and there unlawfully, knowingly, willfully and feloniously take a person, to wit:\n       Suzette Marie Trouten, by force and or threat and or deception with the intent to hold\n       such person to inflict bodily injury on another, to-wit: Suzette Marie Trouten, and did\n       inflict bodily harm on Suzette Marie Trouten, a severity level 1 person felony, in\n       violation of K.S.A. 21-3421, K.S.A. 21-4704 and K.S.A. 21-4707.\"\n\n\nAt trial, the State's theory was that Robinson kidnapped Trouten by deception, with the\nspecific intent of killing her, and that he, in fact, accomplished this purpose.\n\n\n               a. Did the evidence establish a taking by deception?\n\n       Robinson first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the State's\ntheory that Robinson took Trouten by way of deception. At trial, the State advanced two\narguments in support of this theory. First, the prosecution argued Trouten was taken by\ndeception when Robinson lured her from Michigan to Kansas with false promises of\nemployment and travel, for the specific purpose of killing her. Second, the prosecutor\nargued the jury could possibly find that Trouten was taken by deception when Robinson\nlured her to his Linn County property under the guise of fulfilling her BDS&M fantasy.\n\n\n       The State provided substantial evidence in support of its first theory of taking by\ndeception. Trouten's mother testified that in the summer of 1999, Trouten told her that\n                                                  290\n\fRobinson had offered her a job caring for his elderly father. Trouten explained the job\nwould allow her to travel with them to business meetings overseas. Trouten also told her\nfriends about the opportunity. She told Taylor that she would care for the elderly father of\na man named \"John\" and accompany them while they traveled domestically and abroad.\nTrouten told Remington she would earn $6,500 a month and travel to Australia and\nHawaii. Trouten provided similar descriptions of the job and travel opportunities to her\nfather, aunt, and Michigan employer. Trouten traveled to Kansas City on two occasions\nin the fall of 1999, purportedly to interview for the position and find a place to live.\n\n\n       This testimony was corroborated by Trouten's subsequent conduct and other\ncircumstantial evidence. Before the move to Johnson County, Carolyn Trouten observed\nher daughter researching overseas educational opportunities, and Trouten began filling\nout a passport application, a copy of which was seized during the search of Robinson's\nOlathe storage unit. Robinson reserved a room for Trouten at the Guesthouse Suites\nunder his company's name, Specialty Publications. When Robinson boarded Trouten's\ntwo dogs at a veterinary clinic, he said the dogs belonged to his employee. While in\nKansas, Trouten called her mother almost every day, updating her on the trip itinerary.\nEarly morning on March 1, 2000, Trouten told her mother she was leaving with Robinson\non their trip later that day. Trouten's journal, recovered during the search of Robinson's\nOlathe storage unit, included an entry dated February 21 where Trouten wrote: \"Found\nout this morning that we will be leaving for the trip next Monday. I am excited about\ngoing.\" In online chat sessions, Remington and Trouten discussed her work for and\nrelationship with Robinson. After her disappearance, Robinson posed as Trouten and sent\ncommunications to her family explaining she had left town on an \"adventure of a\nlifetime.\" When Carolyn Trouten called Robinson to find her daughter, Robinson said,\n\"'Well, she had met some man, a Jim Turner, and that she decided not to take the job, and\nthat they were traveling.'\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n                                             291\n\f       This evidence was more than sufficient to prove Robinson took Trouten by\ndeception; specifically, making false representations of employment and/or travel\nopportunities. See State v. Holt, 223 Kan. 34, Syl. ¶ 1, 574 P.2d 152 (1977) (State must\nprove taking was accomplished through defendant's false statement or representation,\nexpress or implied, pertaining to a present or past fact to support conviction under K.S.A.\n21-3421).\n\n\n       Robinson argues the record establishes but one theory: that Robinson's taking of\nTrouten was accomplished by his truthful statements regarding his desire to serve as her\nBDS&M master. Robinson highlights e-mails and other evidence confirming the two\nwere involved in a BDS&M sexual relationship to support this argument.\n\n\n       Essentially, Robinson argues the evidence supporting his theory of a truthful\ntaking was more credible than the evidence supporting the State's theory of a taking by\ndeception. We do not \"reweigh evidence, resolve evidentiary conflicts, or make witness\ncredibility determinations\" when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence. State v.\nWilliams, 299 Kan. 509, 525, 324 P.3d 1078 (2014). The State's evidence was sufficient\nto establish a taking by deception, and Robinson's arguments to the contrary fail to\nestablish otherwise. See State v. Dull, 298 Kan. 832, 840-41, 317 P.3d 104 (2014)\n(defendant's arguments regarding weakness and inconsistency of State's evidence \"failed\nto meet our demanding standard for reversal for insufficiency of the evidence\").\n\n\n       Having confirmed that the jury's verdict on Count I is supported by sufficient\nevidence of a taking by deception, we need not consider the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting the State's alternative argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                               292\n\f              b. Did the evidence establish Robinson's specific intent to cause bodily\n              injury?\n\n       Robinson also argues the State failed to prove he possessed the specific intent to\nhold Trouten for the purpose of inflicting bodily injury upon her.\n\n\n       To convict defendant, the State was required to prove he took or confined Trouten\nwith specific intent to carry out one of the enumerated acts in the statute. See State v.\nMcGee, 224 Kan. 173, 177, 578 P.2d 269 (1978). Here, the State alleged defendant took\nthe victim and held her to inflict bodily injury. Thus it had to prove \"not only that\n[defendant] had the general intent to take or confine a person by force, threat, or\ndeception, but also that he had the specific intent to inflict bodily injury or to terrorize the\nvictim or another.\" State v. Becker, 290 Kan. 842, 852, 235 P.3d 424 (2010).\n\n\n       \"Specific intent as an element of the crime charged is normally a question of fact\nfor the jury . . . .\" State v. Dubish, 234 Kan. 708, 717, 675 P.2d 877 (1984). \"Specific\nintent may be shown by acts, circumstances, and reasonable inferences deducible\ntherefrom; it need not be shown by direct proof.\" Becker, 290 Kan. at 852.\n\n\n       The State offered sufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Robinson\ntook Trouten by deception and held her with the specific intent to inflict bodily injury.\nFirst, the State's evidence of Robinson's common scheme and course of conduct\nestablished that he lured multiple women to the Kansas City area in order to exploit and\nlater kill them. Jurors could reasonably infer from this evidence that Robinson intended to\ndo the same with Trouten. See State v. Drennan, 278 Kan. 704, 718, 101 P.3d 1218\n(2004) (prior murder probative of intent and premeditation, given similarity of incidents),\noverruled in part on other grounds by State v. Neighbors, 299 Kan. 234, 328 P.3d 1081\n(2014); State v. Henson, 221 Kan. 635, 645, 562 P.2d 51 (1977) (evidence of prior\nknifing probative of identity and premeditation, given similarity of offenses). The jury\n                                              293\n\fwas free to consider this evidence offered in support of the capital murder counts, Counts\nII and III, as probative of Robinson's specific intent to inflict bodily injury under Count I,\naggravated kidnapping. See Carr, 300 Kan. at 149 (jury free to consider evidence offered\nin support of one charge in considering separate felony-murder charge, where all charges\nproperly joined together in a single complaint); State v. Cromwell, 253 Kan. 495, 509-10,\n856 P.2d 1299 (1993) (where charges tried together, evidence of defendant's commission\nof charged offense admissible to support other charges).\n\n\n       Also, the State's evidence of Robinson's planning and preparation to kill Trouten\nand conceal her disappearance is probative of his specific intent to inflict bodily injury.\nAfter Trouten's disappearance, her mother and father each received a handwritten letter\nfrom their daughter describing her supposed departure on a trip of a lifetime. Robinson's\nformer paramour, Aleisa Cox, testified that Robinson had her draft similar letters to her\nfamily members before they were supposedly scheduled to leave on a trip to Europe—a\ntrip that ultimately fell through. Trouten's family continued to receive typewritten letters\nsigned by Trouten that they believed were fraudulent. During the search of Robinson's\nstorage unit, law enforcement found 42 envelopes preaddressed to members of Trouten's\nfamily, along with 31 pieces of pastel-colored stationary that were blank, except for a\nhandwritten closing that read: \"'Love you, Suzette.'\"\n\n\n       This evidence suggests Robinson planned to kill Trouten and prepared to conceal\nthe crime well before committing the act, and such evidence is probative of his specific\nintent to inflict bodily injury. See State v. Harper, 9 Kan. App. 2d 349, 351-52, 676 P.2d\n774 (a defendant's preparation to steal can reasonably support inference of specific intent\nfor burglary), rev'd on other grounds 235 Kan. 825, 685 P.2d 850 (1984); State v.\nHolmes, 388 So. 2d 722, 728 (La. 1980) (jury could reasonably infer from defendant's\nplanning and execution of robbery a specific intent to kill or inflict great bodily harm);\nPeople v. Youngblood, 165 Mich. App. 381, 387, 418 N.W.2d 472 (1988) (premeditation\n                                             294\n\fcan be founded on circumstantial evidence of organized planning and conduct prior to or\nafter killing); see also State v. Kettler, 299 Kan. 448, 467, 325 P.3d 1075 (2014)\n(defendant's conduct before and after crime is relevant factor in deciding whether\nevidence gives rise to inference of premeditation).\n\n\n       Once again, Robinson argues the evidence at trial established only that he took\nTrouten with the specific intent of engaging in a consensual BDS&M relationship with\nher. The argument invites the court to reweigh the competing evidence and substitute our\njudgment in place of the jury's. This we cannot do. Together, the evidence establishing\nRobinson's common scheme and course of conduct, along with his extensive planning\nand preparation for Trouten's murder, was sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude\nthat he took Trouten by deception with the specific intent to inflict bodily injury upon\nher. See Durbish, 234 Kan. at 717 (specific intent may be shown by acts, circumstances,\nand inferences reasonably deducible from them).\n\n\n       3. Was the State's evidence sufficient to support Robinson's first-degree murder\n       conviction?\n\n       Robinson next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his first-\ndegree premeditated murder conviction for the killing of Lisa Stasi, as alleged in Count\nV. Robinson believes the evidence was insufficient because Stasi's body was never found\nand that the evidence does not tie him to her disappearance.\n\n\n       As discussed in the analysis of the multiplicity issue, we are reversing Robinson's\nfirst-degree premeditated murder conviction under Count V because it is\nunconstitutionally multiplicitous with his capital murder conviction under Count II,\nwhich also alleged that Robinson killed Stasi intentionally and with premeditation as part\nof his common scheme or course of conduct. Given our holding on the multiplicity issue,\n\n                                            295\n\fwe need not address Robinson's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\nhis conviction under Count V in detail.\n\n\nMultiple Acts, Count I—Aggravated Kidnapping\n\n       Robinson argues the State relied on multiple acts to prove its aggravated\nkidnapping charge in Count I, and therefore, the district judge's failure to force the State\nto elect one act or to give a special unanimity instruction constituted clear error.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       In assessing a multiple acts challenge, \"[t]he threshold question is whether we are\npresented with a multiple acts case. If not, [defendant's] argument fails.\" State v. Voyles,\n284 Kan. 239, 244, 160 P.3d 794 (2007). In a multiple acts case, several acts are alleged\nand any one of them could constitute the crime charged. State v. Kesselring, 279 Kan.\n671, 682, 112 P.3d 175 (2005).The court \"treat[s] the question of whether a case presents\na multiple acts issue as one of law over which [it has] unlimited review.\" State v. King,\n299 Kan. 372, 379, 323 P.3d 1277 (2014).\n\n\n       2. Did the State present a multiple acts case?\n\n       In Count I, the State alleged Robinson took Trouten but did not specify the precise\nact that constituted the taking. At trial, the State presented evidence and made argument\nin support of two possible \"takings\": (1) Robinson lured Trouten from Michigan to\nKansas with false representations of employment and travel; and (2) Robinson took\nTrouten to his rural Linn County property with representations of fulfilling her sexual\nfantasy. Robinson contends that the two takings constitute multiple acts, and therefore,\nthe district judge should have compelled the State to elect a single theory of taking to\n\n\n                                             296\n\fsubmit to the jury or provided the jury with a special unanimity instruction requiring\njurors to agree unanimously on the criminal act constituting the taking.\n\n\n       Here, the two separate theories of Trouten's taking could support but one\nconviction for aggravated kidnapping. As the State points out in its brief, a crime is\ncompleted when every element of the offense has occurred. See Cox v. State, 197 Kan.\n395, 405, 416 P.2d 741 (1966) (the crime of kidnapping in the second degree is complete\nwhen without lawful authority a person is forcibly seized with intent to secretly confine\nthe person in this state against his or her will); K.S.A. 21-3106(6) (crime committed\nwhen every element occurs). The actual infliction of bodily injury is one of the essential\nelements of aggravated kidnapping. K.S.A. 21-3421. The State's evidence established that\nRobinson inflicted nonconsensual bodily injury only once—at the time of Trouten's\nmurder. Any bodily injury Trouten may have sustained through consensual BDS&M sex\ncould not, as a matter of law, support the bodily injury element of the aggravated\nkidnapping statute. See State v. Mason, 250 Kan. 393, 396-98, 827 P.2d 748 (1992)\n(court properly instructed that bodily injury must be against the victim's will under\nkidnapping statute).\n\n\n       Because the State's two theories as to how Robinson \"took\" Trouten could support\nbut one conviction, rather than two, Count I and the State's evidence supporting it did not\nconstitute a multiple acts case. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to force\nthe State to elect one theory or, alternatively, in failing to provide a special unanimity\ninstruction to the jury. See State v. Colston, 290 Kan. 952, 961, 235 P.3d 1234 (2010)\n(multiple acts case exists when the State charges defendant with a single count and\npresents evidence of multiple acts—each of which, independently, is sufficient to support\nthe crime charged).\n\n\n\n\n                                              297\n\f                      10. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT—GUILT PHASE\n\n       Robinson claims several instances of alleged prosecutorial misconduct prejudiced\nhis right to a fair trial. In particular, he highlights the prosecutor's use of what he\ncharacterizes as imaginary scripts on closing argument; comments that allegedly\nundermined the presumption of innocence, burden of proof, and right to remain silent;\nand the failure to disclose the State's theory regarding defendant's common scheme or\ncourse of conduct until the rebuttal portion of closing argument.\n\n\nLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n               \"For many years, we have said that 'review of prosecutorial misconduct claims\n       involves a two-step process. The court first decides whether the comments were outside\n       the wide latitude a prosecutor is allowed, e.g., in discussing the evidence. If so, there was\n       misconduct. Second, if misconduct is found, we have said the court must determine\n       whether the improper comments prejudiced the jury and denied the defendant a fair trial.\n       State v. Marshall, 294 Kan. 850, 856, 281 P.3d 1112 (2012).' State v. Bridges, 297 Kan.\n       989, 1012, 306 P.3d 244 (2013).\" State v. Carr, 300 Kan. 1, 248, 331 P.3d 544 (2014),\n       cert. granted in part 135 S. Ct. 1698 (2015).\n\n\nUse of Imaginary Scripts\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor improperly utilized \"imaginary scripts\": (1)\nduring closing argument when the prosecutor advanced the rhetorical question, \"And one\nmust wonder, did that poor, fat, disabled Debbie Faith, did she watch her mom get\nkilled?\"; (2) during closing argument when the prosecutor said, \"We know that there he is\ngrinning like a Cheshire cat; within hours of Lisa Stasi having that baby ripped from her\narms.\"; and (3) during closing argument when the prosecutor made argument based on a\nletter Robinson purportedly sent to victim Lisa Stasi's brother, which was not admitted\ninto evidence.\n\n                                                   298\n\f       1. Did the prosecutor's suggestion that Debbie Faith witnessed her mother's death\n       constitute prosecutorial misconduct?\n\n       At the start of closing argument, prosecutor Morrison characterized Robinson's\nacts as sinister and provided examples of his conduct warranting the title. In the process,\nhe commented, \"And one must wonder, did that poor, fat, disabled Debbie Faith, did she\nwatch her mom get killed?\"\n\n\n       Defense counsel objected, claiming the comment invited speculation from jurors.\nJudge Anderson did not clearly rule on the objection. Instead, he commented that \"I\nunderstand [the prosecutors] have a certain degree of latitude here. On the other hand, it's\nprobably not a good thing for us to get too speculative.\" The defense requested a curative\ninstruction, but the district judge felt it would draw the jury's attention to the remark.\nRobinson believes the comment was improper and prejudicial to his due process rights.\n\n\n       Under the controlling framework, we first consider whether the remark fell beyond\nthe wide latitude afforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence. State v. Martinez, 290\nKan. 992, 1012, 236 P.3d 481 (2010). Prosecutors are granted wide latitude to argue\ncases because it is their duty to present them with \"'earnestness and vigor and to use\nevery legitimate means to bring about a just conviction.'\" State v. King, 288 Kan. 333,\n351, 204 P.3d 585 (2009) (quoting State v. Ruff, 252 Kan. 625, 634, 847 P.2d 1258\n[1993]). \"'Inherent in this wide latitude is the freedom to craft an argument that includes\nreasonable inferences based on the evidence.'\" King, 288 Kan. at 351 (quoting State v.\nPabst, 268 Kan. 501, 507, 996 P.2d 321 [2000]).\n\n\n       However, we have made clear that this wide latitude is not limitless, and\nprosecutors may not comment on facts beyond the evidence. King, 288 Kan. at 351; State\nv. Ly, 277 Kan. 386, 393, 85 P.3d 1200, cert. denied 541 U.S. 1090 (2004). For example,\n                                             299\n\f\"[p]rosecutorial comments referring to what the victim was thinking are improper\nbecause they ask the jury to speculate on facts not in evidence.\" State v. Kleypas, 272\nKan. 894, 1113, 40 P.3d 139 (2001), cert. denied 537 U.S. 834 (2002), overruled on\nother grounds by Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429\n(2006); see State v. De La Torre, 300 Kan. 591, 610, 331 P.3d 815, cert. denied 135 S.\nCt. 728 (2014). Likewise, \"[i]t is improper for the prosecutor to create an 'imaginary\nscript' in order to create and arouse the prejudice and passion of the sentencing jury.\"\nKleypas, 272 Kan. at 1113.\n\n\n       The evidence relevant to the prosecutor's comment established that Debbie Faith\nwas a disabled minor who depended on her mother, Sheila Faith, as her primary\ncaregiver. They left Colorado together to visit Robinson and were never seen alive again.\nTheir bodies were found in two metal drums at Robinson's Raymore, Missouri, storage\nunit. The coroner testified both were killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. He could\nnot determine if the blows rendered them immediately unconscious. Nor could he provide\na precise date of death but said the decomposition was consistent with the State's theory\nthat they had been murdered 6 years earlier.\n\n\n       The State offered no direct evidence that Debbie Faith witnessed her mother's\nmurder. Nor did the circumstantial evidence reasonably give rise to such an inference.\nThe State did not prove which victim Robinson killed first or, for that matter, whether\nthey were killed at the same time or location. It is speculative to presume from the record\nthat Debbie Faith saw Robinson kill her mother. The form of the prosecutor's rhetorical\nquestion, \"One must wonder . . . ,\" did just that and invited jurors to speculate about\nevents unsupported by the evidence. As such, the comment exceeded the wide latitude\nafforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence. See State v. Flournoy, 272 Kan. 784,\n796-97, 36 P.3d 273 (2001) (comment speculating about victim's final thoughts\nimproper).\n                                            300\n\f       The State attempts to distinguish Flournoy, arguing the prosecutor's comments\nthere were unsupported and concerned the victim's possible last thoughts rather than the\nevents she may have witnessed. The distinction is one without a legal difference. In both\ninstances, the State's evidence, and reasonable inferences from it, failed to support the\nevents or scenario the prosecutor painted for the jury during closing argument.\n\n\n       Having determined the comment was beyond the scope of the evidence, we next\ndecide whether Robinson suffered prejudice as a result. See State v. Maestas, 298 Kan.\n765, 774, 316 P.3d 724 (2014). In doing so, we consider: \"(1) whether the misconduct\nwas gross and flagrant; (2) whether the misconduct showed ill will on the prosecutor's\npart; and (3) whether the evidence was of such a direct and overwhelming nature that the\nmisconduct would likely have had little weight in the minds of jurors.\" 298 Kan. at 774.\n\n\n       After careful consideration of these factors, we hold that the prosecutor's comment\nwas not prejudicial to Robinson's right to a fair trial. Prosecutor Morrison's isolated, stray\nremark was not gross and flagrant. See State v. Adams, 292 Kan. 60, 68-69, 253 P.3d 5\n(2011) (comments not gross or flagrant when \"the prosecutor only made a passing\nreference to the victim and did not dwell on or repeat the point\"); State v. Miller, 284\nKan. 682, 719, 163 P.3d 267 (2007) (accumulation of multiple comments may render\nthem gross and flagrant).\n\n\n       The record also confirms the absence of any ill will. After Robinson's objection,\nthe prosecutor moved on to other issues at the district judge's urging and made no further\nreference to the subject. Cf. State v. McHenry, 276 Kan. 513, 525, 78 P.3d 403 (2003) (ill\nwill exists where prosecutor expressed indifference to court's rulings, mocked the\ndefendant, or engaged in repeated acts of misconduct), disapproved on other grounds by\n\n\n                                             301\n\fState v. Gunby, 282 Kan. 39, 144 P.3d 647 (2006); State v. Washington, 275 Kan. 644,\n672, 68 P.3d 134 (2003) (a few comments in lengthy transcript do not show ill will).\n\n\n       Finally, we are convinced this isolated remark had little weight in the minds of\njurors. The prosecutor did not argue Debbie Faith definitively witnessed her mother's\nmurder. Because the form of the rhetorical question was equivocal, the potential impact\non jurors was diminished. Moreover, this isolated remark was likely to have far less\nimpact than the State's overwhelming and compelling evidence establishing that\nRobinson violently murdered this young, disabled teenager and her mother and, for years\nthereafter, reaped the financial benefits of his horrific acts by stealing their Social\nSecurity benefit payments. See Miller, 284 Kan. at 721 (prosecutor's improper comment\nheld little weight in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant).\n\n\n       We find this isolated comment, uttered amongst thousands of pages of transcript,\nwas not prejudicial to Robinson's right to a fair trial.\n\n\n       2. Did the prosecutor's remark about ripping Lisa Stasi's baby from her arms\n       constitute prejudicial misconduct?\n\n       During the rebuttal portion of the State's closing argument, the prosecutor\nresponded to Robinson's argument challenging the State's evidence that Robinson\nmurdered Stasi. As the prosecutor discussed the timeline of events, he commented, \"We\nknow that there [Robinson] is grinning like a Cheshire cat, within hours of Lisa Stasi\nhaving that baby ripped from her arms.\"\n\n\n       The district judge sustained Robinson's objection, instructed the jury to disregard\nthe comment, and admonished the prosecutor not to comment on matters not in evidence.\nThe prosecutor then clarified his argument, explaining to the jury:\n\n                                              302\n\f               \"Would a young mother. . . willingly give up her baby, willingly give her baby\n       away to a stranger? I think we all know the answer to that question; don't we? I think we\n       all know that she wouldn't just walk away from her baby. I think we all know what\n       happened to Lisa Stasi for her baby.\"\n\n\nDefendant did not object to the prosecutor's argument as clarified.\n\n\n       Robinson contends the prosecutor's suggestion that baby Tiffany was \"ripped\"\nfrom Stasi's arms was beyond the scope of the evidence. The record established that Stasi\nwas hysterical and crying when she called her mother-in-law on the afternoon of her\ndisappearance, explaining somebody was trying to have her sign papers and take baby\nTiffany from her. The evidence showed that Robinson later returned to his home with a\nbaby named Tiffany and gave the child to his younger brother in furtherance of what\nturned out to be his adoption ruse.\n\n\n       The evidence did not establish that Robinson actually \"ripped\" baby Tiffany from\nLisa Stasi's arms. Nor could one reasonably make such an inference from the evidence.\nThe record simply contains no evidence describing how it came to pass that Robinson\nobtained physical control over baby Tiffany. We agree with Judge Anderson that the\ncomment exceeded the scope of the evidence.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, it did not prejudice Robinson's right to a fair trial. The lone, isolated\nremark was not gross and flagrant. Though technically improper, the remark did not land\nfar beyond the wide latitude afforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence because\nStasi's emotional response to the situation suggested she was unwilling to part ways with\nher baby voluntarily. See State v. Naputi, 293 Kan. 55, 65, 260 P.3d 86 (2011) (misuse of\nthe word \"corroborate\" was not gross and flagrant misconduct or the product of ill will).\n\n\n\n                                                  303\n\f       Nor was the comment motivated by ill will. After the ruling, the prosecutor\nimmediately explained that the State's argument was that Stasi would not have\nvoluntarily relinquished her parental rights—an inference reasonably supported by the\nevidence. Prosecutors made no further remark on the subject inconsistent with the district\njudge's ruling. Cf. McHenry, 276 Kan. at 525 (noting that ill will has been found in cases\nwhere the prosecutor expressed indifference to a court's rulings or engaged in repeated\nacts of misconduct).\n\n\n       Finally, the comment would have supported little weight in the minds of jurors.\nThe isolated comment paled in comparison to the State's overwhelming evidence\nestablishing that Robinson created a sham charitable outreach program claiming to offer\nassistance to young, vulnerable women with newborn babies; he recruited young,\nCaucasian mothers without strong family connections to participate; he enticed Stasi into\nthis program, and thereafter, murdered her and delivered her baby to his brother as part of\na fraudulent private adoption scheme. See State v. Crawford, 300 Kan. 740, 757, 334\nP.3d 311 (2014) (misconduct could not have been prejudicial in light of highly persuasive\nevidence incriminating defendant).\n\n\n       In addition, whatever prejudicial impact the comment may have created was\nmitigated by the district judge's instruction to jurors to disregard the remark altogether.\nSee State v. Warbritton, 215 Kan. 534, Syl. ¶ 1, 527 P.2d 1050 (1974) (improper remarks\nwill not provide basis for reversal where jury instructed to disregard same, unless remarks\nare so prejudicial as to be incurable). The comment was not immune to such instruction.\nAs such, we hold that the remark did not prejudice Robinson's right to a fair trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                             304\n\f       3. Did the prosecutor's comments on matters not in evidence constitute prejudicial\n       misconduct?\n\n       During the rebuttal portion of closing argument, while discussing evidence\nestablishing that Robinson murdered Stasi, Morrison argued:\n\n\n       \"You know what, he knew her car sat in front of Kathy Klingensmith's house and he\n       thought, How am I going to explain that? What would Lisa say about that? So there's a\n       part in the letter about it. He wrote to Marty, her brother, told him to let the bank take the\n       car back. The payments are so far behind. She wants the money or the car. I don't have\n       the money to pay the bank all the back payments. The car needs lots of work. A whole\n       paragraph and a half trying to explain why she would leave her car there. Why, that car\n       sat there day after day, week after week collecting dust. Why would she leave her car\n       there? Because she's dead, because she's dead.\"\n\n\nThe comments drew no objection from the defense.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by discussing\nthe letter sent to Stasi's brother, Marty Elledge, because it was not admitted into evidence.\nThe State agrees the comments were improper but argues they were not prejudicial.\n\n\n       Indeed, in discussing the letter sent to Elledge, the prosecutor improperly\nreferenced a document that was not admitted into evidence. See State v. Peppers, 294\nKan. 377, 394, 276 P.3d 148 (2012) (prosecutors free to make argument, provided it is\nsupported by admitted evidence).\n\n\n       Even so, we find no prejudice. The prosecutor's comments were not gross or\nflagrant or motivated by ill will. He mentioned the letter on only one occasion, drawing\nno objection from the defense. See King, 288 Kan. at 349 (while not required to preserve\nissue on appeal, lack of objection can be relevant to prejudice analysis); Miller, 284 Kan.\n                                                    305\n\fat 720 (lack of objection relevant to whether comments motivated by ill will). The\ncircumstances suggest the comment, or the failure to introduce the letter, resulted from a\nmere oversight by the prosecutor. The State admitted numerous letters that Robinson,\nposing as the victim, sent to the victims' families, including a letter to Stasi's mother-in-\nlaw. The State also admitted a photocopy of an envelope with an affixed postage stamp\naddressed to Stasi's brother, seized during the search of Robinson's Olathe residence.\nBefore referencing the letter, the prosecutor reminded jurors that all of these letters were\nin evidence, and he asked them to review this evidence during deliberations.\n\n\n       Robinson believes the prosecutor should have known the letter was not in\nevidence because Judge Anderson had previously sustained defendant's hearsay objection\nafter Stasi's aunt, Karen Moore, tried to testify to its contents. However, this objection\nwas founded on Moore's attempt to testify to the contents of the letter, not to its\nadmission of the letter itself. Also, the ruling was made 10 days before closing argument,\nin the midst of an extremely complex, multiweek criminal trial. It is unlikely this\nparticular ruling was fresh in the prosecutor's mind during the rebuttal portion of closing\nargument.\n\n\n       Finally, the comments would have supported little weight in the minds of jurors.\nMorrison made reference to this letter, among other evidence, to rebut the defense's\nclosing argument that the evidence failed to establish that Stasi was dead or that she had\nfallen victim to Robinson's foul play. However, the State put on substantial evidence,\nindependent of this letter, establishing the fact of Stasi's murder and Robinson's\nconnection to it. Morrison's comments on the content of the letter to Elledge did little, if\nanything, to bolster this evidence. Moreover, the trial court instructed jurors to disregard\nany testimony or exhibit not admitted and that counsels' remarks were not evidence,\nfurther mitigating any risk of prejudice.\n\n\n                                             306\n\f        Based on the foregoing, we find the isolated remarks did not prejudice Robinson's\nright to a fair trial.\n\n\nComments with Potential Impact on Defendant's Constitutional Rights\n\n        Robinson also contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by making\ncomments that undermined his substantial rights. Specifically, he claims the prosecutor\nimproperly: (1) commented on Robinson's silence; (2) shifted the burden of proof to the\ndefense; (3) appealed to community interests; and (4) undermined the presumption of\ninnocence during voir dire.\n\n\n        1. Did the prosecutor comment improperly on defendant's silence?\n\n        \"The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as well as § 10 of the\nKansas Constitution Bill of Rights, prohibits a prosecutor from making direct, adverse\ncomments on a defendant's failure to testify on his or her own behalf.\" State v. McKinney,\n272 Kan. 331, 347, 33 P.3d 234 (2001), overruled on other grounds by State v. Davis,\n283 Kan. 569, 158 P.3d 317 (2006). \"An indirect comment may also violate the privilege\nwhere the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury\nwould necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\"\nMcKinney, 272 Kan. at 347.\n\n\n        During the rebuttal portion of closing, the State argued that Robinson's common\nscheme or course of conduct was characterized by four circumstances or elements,\nincluding similar methods of killing the victims and subsequent concealment of the\nbodies. In discussing these elements, Morrison said, \"Finally, concealment, the barrels\nhidden away or isolated. Of course, in Lisa Stasi's case a body not found. That's the\nultimate concealment; isn't it? It's the ultimate concealment.\"\n\n                                            307\n\f         Robinson argues this remark was an indirect and impermissible comment on\nRobinson's right to remain silent. We disagree. The remarks were consistent with and\nwithin the scope of the evidence, which was sufficient to establish that Robinson\nmurdered Stasi and five other women and that law enforcement officers conducted an\nextensive investigation that led to the discovery of all the victims' bodies, other than\nStasi's. From this evidence, one could reasonably infer that Robinson had disposed of\nStasi's body in a manner that prevented law enforcement from discovering the corpus\ndelicti. Considering the record and argument in its totality, the prosecutor was addressing\nlaw enforcement's inability to find Stasi's body—not Robinson's failure to take the stand\nor to otherwise inform law enforcement of the body's location—as the \"ultimate\nconcealment.\" Jurors would not have necessarily and naturally understood Morrison's\nremark as a comment on Robinson's postarrest silence, and, therefore, it was not\nimproper. See State v. Ninci, 262 Kan. 21, 48, 936 P.2d 1364 (1997); see also McKinney,\n272 Kan. at 346 (prosecutor free to draw reasonable inferences \"provided that the\nremarks do not indirectly draw an adverse inference regarding the defendant's failure to\ntestify\").\n\n\n         2. Did the prosecutor improperly shift the burden of proof?\n\n         During closing, the defense argued Robinson did not act alone, in hopes of\ncreating reasonable doubt or, perhaps more likely, residual doubt for the penalty phase.\nTo support the theory, counsel argued that the metal drums holding the bodies were too\nheavy for Robinson to move alone and that the unidentified fingerprint on the roll of duct\ntape stained with Lewicka's blood suggested others were involved.\n\n\n         At the outset of rebuttal, the prosecutor told jurors he would address these specific\nissues, but first he wanted to remind them of the strength of the evidence of Robinson's\nguilt:\n\n                                              308\n\f               \"Before we spend a lot of time talking about whether or not there's a fingerprint\n       on duct tape or why Izabela Lewicka didn't send letters, before we get caught up in those\n       things, let's just remember one thing. Let's think about how intertwined the defendant's\n       conduct with all these women was. And let's not forget the fact that these barrels with\n       their bodies are on his farm. Think about that. Mr. O'Brien wants us all to think, gosh,\n       this is a circumstantial case, look at all these questions here, questions here, questions\n       there over 17 years, that's the best he can come up with. There are very few questions in\n       this case that are unanswered, very, very few.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\nRobinson argues the comment \"that's the best he can come up with\" had the effect of\nshifting the burden of proof to the defendant.\n\n\n       We disagree. The comment was clearly intended to remind the jury not to lose\nsight of the overwhelming evidence of Robinson's guilt when evaluating the defendant's\nreasonable doubt arguments. Moreover, the district judge properly instructed the jurors\non the burden of proof. Viewing the remark in context, we find it to be within the wide\nlatitude afforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence. See State v. Cosby, 293 Kan.\n121, 137, 262 P.3d 285 (2011) (prosecutor's rhetorical question whether jury had heard\nany evidence to contradict the State's position \"constituted only a general question about\nthe absence of evidence to rebut the State's witnesses,\" especially given district judge's\ninstruction on burden of proof); McKinney, 272 Kan. at 347 (prosecutors may make\ninferences from the balance or lack of evidence presented at trial; comment suggesting\nthat defendant failed to prove State's witness was lying was proper argument on lack of\nevidence where jury instructed properly on burden of proof).\n\n\n       Robinson cites State v. Tosh, 278 Kan. 83, 91 P.3d 1204 (2004), in support of his\nposition. There we held the prosecutor improperly shifted the burden of proof by\nquestioning whether there was \"'\"any evidence that [the crimes] didn't happen? Is there\n\n                                                    309\n\fany evidence that the things [the victim] told you didn't happen?\"'\" 278 Kan. at 92.\nHowever, in arriving at this holding, we noted the importance of considering the context\nin which the comments were made. The prosecutor not only made the challenged remark,\nbut also suggested defendant's challenge of the victim's account was akin to \"'rap[ing] her\nagain,'\" and questioned why defendant would even do so, having confessed previously.\n278 Kan. at 90, 92. When viewing the remarks together in context, we found the\nimproper motive and effect of the comment was apparent. 278 Kan. at 92.\n\n\n       In stark contrast, Morrison made the comment at issue here in the context of\nrehabilitating the State's evidence. He was responding directly to the challenges the\ndefense had lodged to the State's theory during closing. In this context, \"the best they can\ncome up with\" remark was not an attempt to shift the burden of proof. Tosh is\ndistinguishable, and the remark was not improper under these facts. See City of Dodge\nCity v. Ingram, 33 Kan. App. 2d 829, 837-38, 109 P.3d 1272 (2005) (prosecutor's\ncomments that defense \"'simply arguing smoke and mirrors'\" and \"'[g]rasping at straws'\"\nnot improper).\n\n\n       3. Did the prosecutor improperly appeal to community interests?\n\n       In his final remarks to the jury, the prosecutor said:\n\n\n               \"Now is your opportunity to decide whether or not you want to hold the\n       defendant accountable for his actions for all these years. I hope you do. Thank you.\"\n\n\nRobinson argues this comment improperly appealed to community interests.\n\n\n       Whether a statement properly calls for a conviction based on the evidence or,\ninstead, improperly appeals to larger community interests is a matter of degree and\ndependent on the nature of the remark and the context in which it is made. See, e.g., State\n                                                  310\n\fv. Anderson, 294 Kan. 450, 463, 276 P.3d 200 (\"statement that the victim's 'redemption'\nwould come with a guilty verdict is an appeal to emotion that attempts to pressure a\nverdict from the jury out of pity for the victim, rather than the defendant's guilt, and is an\nattempt to divert the jury's attention from the evidence\"), cert. denied 133 S. Ct. 529\n(2012); but see State v. Finley, 273 Kan. 237, 244-45, 42 P.3d 723 (2002) (\"prosecutor's\ncomments asking the jury not to let the defendant get away with the crime is in most\ninstances permissible comment\"). A prosecutor's argument to convict based on the\nevidence is proper. In contrast, remarks that imply that an acquittal will result in adverse\nimpact on the community or otherwise appeal to community-wide interests are improper.\n273 Kan. at 245 (\"'[w]e don't want people making meth in our communities'\" and we\nneed to prevent \"'people from making meth in our community'\"); State v. Ruff, 252 Kan.\n625, 636, 847 P.2d 1258 (1993) (arguing jurors had a duty to send a message to the\ncommunity that charged conduct will not be tolerated).\n\n\n       Here the prosecutor's closing remarks to the jury, on their face, did not invoke a\nplea for jurors to consider broader community-wide interests. Instead, after summarizing\nthe relevant evidence and arguments, the prosecutor asked the jury to hold Robinson\naccountable for his actions by finding him guilty. Such a comment was not improper.\n\n\n       4. Did the prosecutor's voir dire comments undermine the presumption of\n       innocence?\n\n       Robinson believes the prosecutor undermined the presumption of innocence\nduring jury selection by: (1) telling veniremembers that a juror should enter proceedings\nwith no preconceived opinions of guilt or innocence; and (2) suggesting Robinson could\nbe acquitted only if the prosecution did a \"bad job\" of presenting the case at trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                             311\n\f       A prosecutor's statements must accurately reflect the law. Tosh, 278 Kan. at 90. If\nnot, they are deemed misconduct. State v. Raskie, 293 Kan. 906, 917-18, 269 P.3d 1268\n(2012) (once misstatement of law established, analysis shifts to prejudice inquiry).\n\n\n               a. Were the prosecutor's remarks about panelists' preconceived opinions\n               improper?\n\n       Robinson first argues the prosecutor misstated the law by saying jurors should\nenter the box without preconceived opinions of guilt or innocence. During the second\nphase of jury selection, Judge Anderson assigned veniremembers to small group panels\nfor questioning on bias related to pretrial publicity and the death penalty. While\nquestioning one of the small group panels, the prosecutor told Juror 342:\n\n\n               \"Obviously, if somebody comes in with a notion then they know the whole story\n       or they think that somebody is guilty, they think that somebody is not guilty, if they do\n       have some of that baggage, they need to be able to set it aside.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\nDefense counsel objected, explaining the presumption of innocence allows jurors to\nbelieve defendant is not guilty unless or until proven otherwise. Morrison immediately\nresponded, \"I didn't mean it in that context.\" Judge Anderson sustained the objection and\ninstructed the panelists to disregard the statement.\n\n\n       Notwithstanding the district judge's ruling, Robinson argues, the prosecutor\ncontinued to make the same comments. First, Robinson highlights the prosecutor's\nremarks to the twenty-second small group panel on September 25, 2002:\n\n\n               \"Okay. And does everybody here understand that's really kind of why we're\n       asking these questions, because the law . . . doesn't expect everybody to, you know, have\n       a totally blank mind and not to have ever heard anything about a case. That's not really\n       the issue.\n\n                                                   312\n\f               \"What the issue is, if you're going to be a juror on this case, jurors have got to be\n       able to set that aside. Preconceived opinions or notions that you have about facts of the\n       case, you've got to be able to say, 'I can check that at the door, I can . . . leave that outside\n       the courtroom and not let that affect me.'\"\n\n\nRobinson also highlights the prosecutor's comments to the thirteenth small group panel\non September 23, 2002, when he asked prospective jurors 85 and 87 if they could set\naside the information they learned and any opinions formed as a result of exposure to\npretrial publicity and decide the case based on the evidence presented at trial.\n\n\n       The prosecutor's initial comment to the small group panel did not prejudice\nRobinson's substantial rights. The comment was made in the context of discussing\npretrial publicity, not the appropriate burden of proof at trial. Moreover, the prosecutor\nimmediately clarified that he had not intended for his remarks to be construed as a\nstatement on the presumption of innocence. Judge Anderson also provided a curative\ninstruction to the panelists, none of whom served on Robinson's jury.\n\n\n       Likewise, neither of the later comments is objectionable or inconsistent with Judge\nAnderson's prior ruling. Each reflected the proper standard for juror qualification where\nmedia coverage has been widespread. Patton v. Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 1036, 104 S. Ct.\n2885, 81 L. Ed. 2d 847 (1984) (where juror exposure to publicity raises concerns of bias,\nrelevant question is whether he or she can set information aside and judge case on the\nevidence). The prosecutor did not suggest to jurors that the goal of impartiality undercut\nor should subvert the presumption of innocence.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     313\n\f               b. Was the prosecutor's hypothetical that assumed the State did a \"bad job\"\n               presenting the case improper?\n\n       At various times during small group voir dire, some panelists expressed\nuncertainty as to their ability to set aside pretrial publicity. In these situations, the\nprosecutor occasionally presented the panelists with a hypothetical question to the effect\nthat \"assuming the prosecution did a horrible or bad job presenting the case and you had\nserious doubts that the State had met its burden, how would you vote, or would you vote\nto acquit?\" In doing so, Robinson believes the prosecutor implied that acquittal would be\nproper only if the prosecutors did a horrible job presenting the case.\n\n\n       Contrary to Robinson's assertion, Morrison's use of this hypothetical question did\nnot improperly shift the burden of proof or undermine the presumption of innocence. The\nprosecutor phrased the question as a hypothetical scenario for the purpose of establishing\npanelists' willingness and ability to set aside media facts and opinions formed as a result\nof exposure to them. The question was particularly appropriate, given that the entire\npurpose of small group voir dire during the second phase of jury selection was to explore\npotential bias created by exposure to pretrial publicity and panelists' death penalty views.\nThroughout the voir dire process, the prosecutor emphasized the applicable evidentiary\nburdens and legal presumptions to veniremembers. Viewing the voir dire record in its\nentirety, we hold the remarks were not misconduct.\n\n\nTiming of Discussion of State's \"Common Scheme or Course of Conduct\" Theory\n\n       In Count II and III of the Fourth Amended Complaint, the State alleged that\nRobinson killed Suzette Trouten and Izabela Lewicka, respectively, as part of a common\nscheme or course of conduct that included the murders of Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith,\nBeverly Bonner, and Lisa Stasi. Robinson claims the prosecutors engaged in misconduct\n\n\n                                               314\n\fby withholding the factual basis of or theory regarding the common scheme or course of\nconduct until the rebuttal portion of closing argument.\n\n\n       \"'As a general rule, [prosecutors] should not be allowed to develop new arguments\non rebuttal, but should be restricted to answering the arguments put forth by defense\ncounsel.'\" Hall v. United States, 540 A.2d 442, 448 (D.C. 1988) (quoting Moore v. United\nStates, 344 F.2d 558, 560 [D.C. Cir. 1965]); see Supreme Court Rule 168(a)(2) (2014\nKan. Ct. R. Annot. 276) (\"Plaintiff may not argue a general issue not discussed in the\nopening portion of plaintiff's closing argument, unless in rebuttal.\") The general rule,\nhowever, is not applied in a rigid fashion and \"has evolved to give trial courts a modicum\nof discretion to allow a more substantial rebuttal which is not so narrowly tailored to the\nscope of defense counsel's summation.\" Bailey v. State, 440 A.2d 997, 1003 (Del. 1982);\nsee State v. Rosa, 170 Conn. 417, 428, 365 A.2d 1135 (\"no rigid requirement that a\nprosecutor's final summation must be limited solely to rebuttal of matters raised in the\ndefendant's argument.\"), cert. denied 429 U.S. 845 (1976).\n\n\n       Robinson's argument fails for at least two reasons. First, it is unsupported by the\nrecord. At the outset of trial, during opening statements, the prosecutor told jurors that the\nevidence would demonstrate that Robinson employed a common scheme or course of\nconduct that included elaborate scams to exploit victims financially or sexually, kill them,\nand conceal their deaths. During its case-in-chief, the State put on evidence supporting\nthe inference that Robinson's killings were linked together by common elements,\nincluding: luring victims with promises of financial benefit or travel, exploitation of the\nvictims financially or sexually, similar methods of killing and disposal or concealment of\nthe bodies, and acts of deceit and fraud to hide all of these crimes. During the first portion\nof the State's closing argument, prosecutor Morrison claimed that Robinson was the\ncommon thread that ran through the similar characteristics of all the murders, including\n\n\n                                             315\n\fthe bogus cover stories used to lure victims, the similar manner of killings, and the\nvarious efforts taken to conceal the deaths.\n\n\n       Additionally, the defense opened the door to the State's rebuttal argument.\nRobinson devoted a substantial portion of his closing to challenging the sufficiency of the\nevidence supporting the existence of a common scheme or course of conduct. The\nprosecutor's challenged remarks were proper rebuttal to Robinson's closing argument.\nUnited States v. Sharp, 400 Fed. Appx. 741, 750-51 (4th Cir. 2010) (unpublished\nopinion) (prosecutor did not commit misconduct by referring to altered records during\nrebuttal argument where it replied to theory raised in defendant's closing argument); State\nv. Harrison, 631 So. 2d 531, 534 (La. App. 1994) (prosecutor's rebuttal argument proper\nwhere defense counsel opened the door during closing argument).\n\n\n       Thus we hold the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct by discussing the\nelements of Robinson's common scheme or course of conduct during the rebuttal portion\nof closing argument.\n\n\nSummary of Guilt Phase Prosecutorial Misconduct Issues\n\n       In the end, we find the prosecutor made three isolated improper remarks during a\njury selection process and guilt phase trial that continued for several weeks. In particular,\nthe prosecutor made comments beyond the scope of the evidence when he: (1)\nspeculated whether Debbie Faith witnessed her mother's murder; (2) suggested baby\nTiffany was ripped from Lisa Stasi's arms; and (3) discussed the contents of a letter sent\nto Lisa Stasi's brother. Viewed together, the one-time-only nature of each of the\ncomments does not demonstrate that they were gross and flagrant or motivated by ill will.\nAlso, they would have held little weight in the minds of jurors, given the State's\noverwhelming evidence of Robinson's guilt. The cumulative effect of these statements\n\n                                               316\n\fwas not prejudicial to Robinson's fair trial rights. See State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894,\n1088, 40 P.3d 139 (2001) (even if instances of prosecutorial misconduct are harmless\nerror in and of themselves, their cumulative effect must be analyzed), cert. denied 537\nU.S. 834 (2002), overruled on other grounds by Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S.\nCt. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 439 (2006).\n\n\n                          11. INSTRUCTIONAL ERROR—GUILT PHASE\n\n       Robinson lodges three challenges to the district judge's guilt phase instructions. In\nparticular, he argues the capital murder elements instructions were deficient in failing to\ndefine \"common scheme or course of conduct.\" Similarly, he contends the lack of such a\ndefinition rendered those terms unconstitutionally vague. Finally, he complains the venue\ninstruction was incomplete and confusing.\n\n\nFailure to Define \"Common Scheme\" or \"Course of Conduct\" in Instructions\n\n       The district judge provided a separate elements instruction for each capital murder\ncount, Counts II and III of the Fourth Amended Complaint. The instructions were\nidentical except for the name of the primary victim, Trouten or Lewicka, and the relevant\ndates of the offense. Each instruction informed the jury that, as one of the elements of the\noffense, the State had to prove the killing of Trouten or Lewicka, along with the killings\nof Bonner, Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith, and Stasi, \"were multiple acts or transactions\nconstituting parts of a common scheme or a course of conduct.\"\n\n\n       Robinson requested that the trial judge include the following definitions of\n\"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\" for the jury:\n\n               \"A common scheme exists between multiple acts if such acts are closely\n       connected in time, place, occasion, and the nature of the activity.\n\n                                                   317\n\f               \"A course of conduct is a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a\n       period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose.\"\n\n\n       Judge Anderson declined, finding the terms were not particularly difficult for a lay\nperson to resolve. Robinson now contends the failure to define the terms was erroneous.\n\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n               \"For jury instruction issues, the progression of analysis and corresponding\n       standards of review on appeal are: (1) First, the appellate court should consider the\n       reviewability of the issue from both jurisdiction and preservation viewpoints, exercising\n       an unlimited standard of review; (2) next, the court should use an unlimited review to\n       determine whether the instruction was legally appropriate; (3) then, the court should\n       determine whether there was sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\n       the defendant or the requesting party, that would have supported the instruction; and (4)\n       finally, if the district court erred, the appellate court must determine whether the error\n       was harmless, utilizing the test and degree of certainty set forth in State v. Ward, 292\n       Kan. 541, 256 P.3d 801 (2011), cert. denied ___ U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 1594 (2012).\" State\n       v. Salary, 301 Kan. 586, Syl. ¶ 1, 343 P.3d 1165 (2015).\n\n\n       2. Did \"common scheme\" or \"course of conduct\" require definition?\n\n       Because the reviewability of the issue is not in dispute, our inquiry focuses on the\nsecond step of the analysis—whether defendant's proposed instruction defining \"common\nscheme\" and \"course of conduct\" was legally appropriate. In assessing whether definition\nof instructional terms is legally appropriate, we have held that\n\n\n       \"a trial court 'need not define every word or phrase in the instructions. It is only when the\n       instructions as a whole would mislead the jury, or cause them to speculate, that additional\n       terms should be defined.' State v. Norris, 226 Kan. 90, 95, 595 P.2d 1110 (1979). We\n       further stated that '[a] term which is widely used and which is readily comprehensible\n\n                                                    318\n\f       need not have a defining instruction.' 226 Kan. at 95.\" State v. Armstrong, 299 Kan. 405,\n       440, 324 P.3d 1052 (2014).\n\n\n       The legislature has not defined the phrases \"common scheme\" or \"course of\nconduct.\" The Notes on Use to PIK Crim. 4th 54.020, the elements instruction for capital\nmurder, suggest instructions on definitions of terms should be given as defined in PIK\nCrim. 4th 54.150 (homicide definitions), which does not define \"common scheme\" or\n\"course of conduct.\"\n\n\n       We have not previously had occasion to address whether the phrases \"common\nscheme\" or \"course of conduct\" under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) necessitate further definition.\nHowever, other state appellate courts have held that these or similar terms in their capital\nmurder statutes are commonly understood and require no further elaboration. Duke v.\nState, 889 So. 2d 1, 31 (Ala. Crim. App. 2002) (terms \"one scheme\" and \"course of\nconduct\" could be \"understood by the average juror in their common usage\"), cert.\ngranted, judgment vacated on other grounds 544 U.S. 901 (2005); Sendejo v. State, 676\nS.W.2d 454, 456 (Tex. App. 1984) (no need to define \"pursuant to one scheme or\ncontinuing course of conduct\" as the phrase includes terms of common understanding);\nState v. Yates, 161 Wash. 2d 714, 749, 168 P.3d 359 (2007) (\"common scheme or plan\"\nunder Washington capital murder statute are words of common understanding requiring\nno definition); State v. Cross, 156 Wash. 2d 580, 617, 132 P.3d 80 (2006) (same).\n\n\n       Robinson cites multiple dictionary definitions of the words \"common,\" \"scheme,\"\n\"course,\" and \"conduct\" in an effort to illustrate the terms have varied meanings and\nrequire further definition. The problem with this approach is that the meaning of the\nindividual words is not at issue. Rather, the issue is whether the phrases \"common\nscheme\" and \"course of conduct\" are easily understood by lay jurors. The phrases use\nwords in combination, not isolated definitions in combination, and, consequently, in\n\n                                                  319\n\fcommon usage are more precise than the sum of their parts. See K.S.A. 77-201 Second\n(words and phrases in a statute \"shall be construed according to the context and the\napproved usage of the language\"); see also United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 294,\n128 S. Ct. 1830, 170 L. Ed. 2d 650 (2008) (\"[M]eanings are narrowed by the common-\nsense canon of noscitur a sociis—which counsels that a word is given more precise\ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\"); State v. Ross, 2007 UT\n89, ¶¶ 28-29, 174 P.3d 628 (Utah 2007) (statutory terms become clearer considered in\ncontext of the whole provision; \"the clarity of the whole of the statute is greater than the\nsum of its individual parts\").\n\n\n          Robinson also claims this court and the legislature have confused matters by using\nthe terms in \"wide-ranging\" ways. He reviews various cases and statutes in which the\nphrases have been used and concludes that collectively they demonstrate no one meaning\ncan be identified. But this argument also ignores context and relies on an\nunacknowledged and incorrect premise that the jurors asked to construe the phrases in\nthis capital murder trial were aware of and confused by their use in other contexts.\nRobinson points to nothing in the record evidencing such confusion among Robinson's\njurors.\n\n\n          Neither the legislature nor the PIK Committee recommended a definition for\n\"common scheme\" or \"course of conduct\" in K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), implying both\nbelieved the phrases were easily understood. Consistent with this view, other state courts\nhave held that these or similar phrases in their capital murder statutes required no further\ndefinition. Defendant's proposed instruction defining \"common scheme\" and \"course of\nconduct\" was not legally appropriate, and we hold there was no error.\n\n\n\n\n                                              320\n\f\"Common Scheme\" or \"Course of Conduct\" as Unconstitutionally Vague\n\n      In a similar vein, Robinson suggests Judge Anderson's failure to define the terms\n\"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\" rendered the capital murder statute\nunconstitutionally vague, in violation of his due process and Eighth Amendment rights.\n\n\n      1. Standard of Review\n\n                \"When the application of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, this\n      court exercises an unlimited, de novo standard of review. State v. Myers, 260 Kan. 669,\n      676, 923 P.2d 1024 (1996), cert. denied 521 U.S. 1118 (1997). We presume that\n      legislative enactments are constitutional and resolve all doubts in favor of a statute's\n      validity. State v. Wilkinson, 269 Kan. 603, 606, 9 P.3d 1 (2000). We will not declare a\n      statute unconstitutional as applied unless it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n      statute infringes on constitutionally protected rights. See 269 Kan. at 606.\" State v. Cook,\n      286 Kan. 766, 768, 187 P.3d 1283 (2008).\n\n\n      2. Are the Phrases \"common scheme\" or \"course of conduct\" unconstitutionally\n      vague?\n\n      We apply a two-part test in analyzing whether a statute is unconstitutionally vague\nunder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution:\n\n\n      \"First, the [statute] must give adequate notice to those tasked with following it. More\n      specifically, the [statute] must 'convey sufficient definite warning and fair notice as to the\n      prohibited conduct in light of common understanding and practice.' Steffes, 284 Kan. at\n      389 (citing [City of Wichita v.] Hackett, 275 Kan. [848,] 853-54[, 69 P.3d 621 (2003)]).\n      We have recognized that [a statute] that '\"requires or forbids the doing of an act in terms\n      so vague that persons of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and\n      differ as to its application is violative of due process.\"' Hackett, 275 Kan. at 853 (citing\n      State v. Dunn, 233 Kan. 411, 418, 662 P.2d 1286 [1983]); see Connally v. Gen. Constr.\n                                                   321\n\f      Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926). But on the other hand,\n      Kansas has long held that [a statute] is not unconstitutionally vague if it employs words\n      commonly used, previously judicially defined, or having a settled meaning in law.\n      Hackett, 275 Kan. at 853-54 (citing City of Wichita v. Lucero, 255 Kan. 437, 451, 874\n      P.2d 1144 [1994]).\n\n\n              \"In the second prong of our inquiry, we require that [a statute]'s terms must be\n      precise enough to adequately protect against arbitrary and discriminatory action by those\n      tasked with enforcing it. Steffes, 284 Kan. at 389 (citing Hackett, 275 Kan. at 854); see\n      Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703, 732, 120 S. Ct. 2480, 147 L. Ed .2d 597 (2000). We\n      acknowledge that a law is invalid if it violates either prong. City of Chicago v. Morales,\n      527 U.S. 41, 56, 119 S. Ct. 1849, 144 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1999). However, 'the more important\n      aspect of the vagueness doctrine \"is not actual notice but the other principal element of\n      the doctrine—the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern\n      law enforcement.\"' Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 75 L. Ed. 2d\n      903 (1983) (citing Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 574-75, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d\n      605 [1974]). And in analyzing this second prong for vagueness, we are further mindful\n      that '[t]he standards of certainty in [a statute] punishing criminal offenses are higher than\n      in those depending primarily upon civil sanctions for enforcement.' Steffes, 284 Kan. at\n      389.\" City of Lincoln Center v. Farmway Co-Op, Inc., 298 Kan. 540, 545-46, 316 P.3d\n      707 (2013).\n\n\nSee City of Wichita v. Hackett, 275 Kan. 848, 853, 69 P.3d 621 (2003).\n\n\n      In elaborating further on the second part of the framework, we explained:\n\n\n      \"'[I]f arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide\n      explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic\n      policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective\n      basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.'\" 276 Kan. at\n      822 (quoting Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09, 92 S. Ct. 2294, 33 L.\n      Ed. 2d 222 [1972]).\n\n                                                  322\n\f       A vagueness challenge based on the Eighth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution is subject to a substantially similar analysis. See Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1025\n(when statutory language challenged as unconstitutionally vague, court must decide\nwhether language is too vague to guide discretion of jurors regarding the sentencing\nprocess); see also Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.S. 356, 361-62, 108 S. Ct. 1853, 100 L.\nEd. 2d 372 (1988) (claims of vagueness under Eighth Amendment assert inadequate\nnotice failing to limit a sentencer's discretion).\n\n\n       Robinson makes clear his challenge arises under the second part of the framework,\narbitrary enforcement. As such, we must decide whether the failure of the trial judge to\ndefine \"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\" for the jury rendered the language\nsusceptible to arbitrary and capricious or discriminatory application by the jury.\n\n\n       Robinson believes the statutory language was susceptible to arbitrary application\nbecause his case lies at the boundaries of the concepts of \"common scheme\" and \"course\nof conduct,\" and, therefore, it was difficult for the jury to determine whether his conduct\nfell within them.\n\n\n       The Supreme Court rejected the very premise of Robinson's argument in Williams,\n553 U.S. 285, where it reviewed a due process vagueness challenge to a statute\ncriminalizing the pandering or solicitation of child pornography. The Eleventh Circuit\nhad held language in the statute void for vagueness, concluding that under certain\nhypothetical scenarios it demanded close calls on whether conduct fell within the statute's\nprohibition. This meant innocent individuals could be prosecuted under the law. The\nSupreme Court disagreed:\n\n\n\n\n                                              323\n\f       \"[T]he Eleventh Circuit's . . . basic mistake lies in the belief that the mere fact that close\n       cases can be envisioned renders a statute vague. That is not so. Close cases can be\n       imagined under virtually any statute. The problem that poses is addressed, not by the\n       doctrine of vagueness, but by the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. See In\n       re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 363[, 90 S. Ct. 1068, 25 L. Ed. 2d 368] (1970).\n               \"What renders a statute vague is not the possibility that it will sometimes be\n       difficult to determine whether the incriminating fact it establishes has been proved; but\n       rather the indeterminacy of precisely what that fact is. Thus, we have struck down\n       statutes that tied criminal culpability to whether the defendant's conduct was 'annoying' or\n       'indecent'—wholly subjective judgments without statutory definitions, narrowing context,\n       or settled legal meanings. See Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U.S. 611, 614[, 91 S. Ct. 1686,\n       29 L. Ed. 2d 214] (1971); Reno [v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.S. 844,] 870-\n       871, and n.35[, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 138 L. Ed. 2d 874 (1997)].\" Williams, 553 U.S. at 305-\n       06.\n\n\n       Williams makes clear the pivotal question here is not whether it might be difficult\nfor the jury to determine if Robinson's conduct constituted a common scheme or course\nof conduct, but rather whether the jury can apply those concepts in a reasoned,\nnonarbitrary way to the evidence it received.\n\n\n       Courts have consistently found that \"common scheme,\" \"course of conduct,\" and\nsimilar terms are not unconstitutionally vague. Sheriff v. Smith, 91 Nev. 729, 731-32, 542\nP.2d 440 (1975) (the phrase \"common plan or scheme\" interpreted to mean a single plan\nor scheme contemplating two or more offenses before the plan has been completed, did\nnot violate due process); State v. Perez, 124 Ohio St. 3d 122, 156 ¶ 233, 920 N.E.2d 104\n(2009) (rejecting course-of-conduct specification as unconstitutionally vague); Corwin v.\nState, 870 S.W.2d 23, 28-29 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (\"same scheme or course of\nconduct\" in capital murder statute not unconstitutionally vague; fact that marginal cases\nmay make it difficult to determine whether offense committed not grounds to find statute\nunconstitutionally vague); Ross, 174 P.3d at 633-34 (\"incident to one act, scheme, course\n\n                                                    324\n\fof conduct, or criminal episode\" not unconstitutionally vague on due process grounds);\nState v. Pirtle, 127 Wash. 2d 628, 662, 904 P.2d 245 (1995) (\"common scheme or plan is\nnot unconstitutionally vague\" because jury instructions and verdict forms could be\nunderstood by an average person). This authority also suggests Robinson's jury could\napply the concepts in a reasoned, non-arbitrary fashion. Accordingly, we hold that the\nphrases \"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\" are not unconstitutionally vague.\n\n\n        Robinson's citation to State v. Locklear, 105 Wash. App. 555, 560-62, 20 P.3d 993\n(2001), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. State v. Rodgers, 146 Wash. 2d 55, 43 P.3d 1\n(2002), do not dissuade us from this ruling. In Locklear, the Washington Court of\nAppeals reversed defendant's conviction under a state drive-by shooting statute it found\nto be unconstitutionally vague. However, on appeal, defendant argued the intermediary\nappellate court erred by reversing his conviction on constitutional grounds rather than on\nthe basis of insufficient evidence supporting the conviction. Citing the \"well-established\nrule of judicial restraint that the issue of the constitutionality of a statute will not be\npassed upon if the case can be decided without reaching that issue,\" 146 Wash. 2d at 60,\nthe Washington Supreme Court, sitting en banc, noted: \"It seems obvious that one is not\nin the immediate area of a vehicle that is parked two blocks away from the place where\nthat person discharges a firearm\" and held that the evidence was insufficient to support\ndefendant's conviction under the drive-by shooting statute. 146 Wash. 2d at 62. Locklear\nappears to be of questionable authority even in Washington, and we find it unpersuasive\nhere.\n\n\nDefendant's Challenge to Venue Instruction\n\n        The trial court's instructions on the capital murder counts, along with the lesser\nincluded offense instructions, provided that the jury must find that the murders occurred\nin Johnson County, Kansas. However, the bodies of the capital murder victims, Trouten\n\n                                               325\n\fand Lewicka, were discovered in Linn County. To assist jurors on the venue issue, the\ndistrict judge gave the following instruction:\n\n\n                                    \"INSTRUCTION NO. 11\n               \"If you find that the defendant committed criminal acts in one county which were\n       a substantial and integral part of an overall continuing crime plan, and which were in\n       partial execution of that plan, the prosecution may be in any county in which any of such\n       acts occur.\"\n\n\n       Robinson neither objected to the venue instruction nor offered an alternative. He\nnow complains that Instruction No. 11 was confusing and erroneous and that the trial\ncourt should have given an additional instruction informing the jury of the presumption\ncontained in K.S.A. 22-2611 that \"[d]eath shall be presumed to have occurred in the\ncounty where the body of the victim is found.\"\n\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n       Because Robinson failed to object to the venue instruction or request an alternative\ninstruction, we review the challenge for clear error. See K.S.A. 22-3414(3); State v.\nBriseno, 299 Kan. 877, 882, 326 P.3d 1074 (2014). We apply a two-part test to determine\nwhether a jury instruction is clearly erroneous.\n\n\n       \"First, 'the reviewing court must . . . determine whether there was any error at all. To\n       make that determination, the appellate court must consider whether the subject instruction\n       was legally and factually appropriate, employing an unlimited review of the entire\n       record.'\" State v. Herbel, 296 Kan. 1101, 1121, 299 P.3d 292 (2013) (quoting State v.\n       Williams, 295 Kan. 506, Syl. ¶ 4, 286 P.3d 195 [2012]).\n\n\n       If error is found, we next conduct a reversibility inquiry, where\n\n\n                                                   326\n\f       \"'the court assesses whether it is firmly convinced that the jury would have reached a\n       different verdict had the instruction error not occurred. The party claiming a clearly\n       erroneous instruction maintains the burden to establish the degree of prejudice necessary\n       for reversal.' Williams, 295 Kan. 506, Syl. ¶ 5.\" Herbel, 296 Kan. at 1121.\n\n\n       2. Was the venue instruction erroneous?\n\n       \"Venue must be proved to establish the jurisdiction of the court; it is a question of\nfact to be determined by the jury, albeit the existence of jurisdiction is a question of law,\nsubject to unlimited appellate review.\" State v. Hunt, 285 Kan. 855, 859, 176 P.3d 183\n(2008). Being tried in the proper venue is a right granted by the Kansas Constitution Bill\nof Rights, § 10. K.S.A. 22-2602 states that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the\nprosecution shall be in the county where the crime was committed.\"\n\n\n       However, in some instances, it may not be apparent where a crime was committed.\nThe legislature has developed a number of rules to address more complicated venue\nquestions. Relevant to this case is K.S.A. 22-2603, which provides \"[w]here two or more\nacts are requisite to the commission of any crime and such acts occur in different counties\nthe prosecution may be in any county in which any of such acts occur,\" and K.S.A. 22-\n2611, which provides that \"[i]f the cause of death is inflicted in one county and the death\nensues in another county, the prosecution may be in either of such counties. Death shall\nbe presumed to have occurred in the county where the body of the victim is found.\"\n\n\n       The district judge's venue instruction failed to incorporate either statutory\nprovision. Instruction No. 11 is similar to the language of K.S.A. 22-2603, but there are\nsignificant differences. The statute requires two or more acts that are \"requisite to the\ncommission\" of the crime. The instruction, on the other hand, focuses on acts that are a\n\"substantial and integral part of an overall continuing crime plan.\" Instruction No. 11\n\n\n                                                   327\n\fdoes not focus on a crime, which is problematic because the instruction is intended to\nassist jurors in deciding where the crimes occurred.\n\n\n       Furthermore, Instruction No. 11 failed to include the statutory presumption under\nK.S.A. 22-2611 altogether. The failure to do so is particularly troubling given that the\nprosecution occurred in Johnson County, but the bodies of Trouten and Lewicka were\nfound in Linn County. See Hunt, 285 Kan. at 859-60 (State had burden to prove venue\nproper; jury should have been instructed that it must find murder occurred in venue of\nprosecution and further instructed that death presumed to occur in county where victim's\nbody found under K.S.A. 22-2611).\n\n\n       Instruction No. 11 was modeled after language from State v. Grissom, 251 Kan.\n851, 889, 840 P.2d 1142 (1992), where we held that the Johnson County District Court\nhad territorial jurisdiction to prosecute defendant because \"[t]here [wa]s evidence from\nwhich a jury could find that Grissom committed criminal acts in Kansas which were a\nsubstantial and integral part of an overall continuing crime plan and which were in partial\nexecution of the plan.\" 251 Kan. at 889. The district judge's reliance on this language was\nmisplaced. Grissom was a territorial jurisdiction case, not a venue case. 251 Kan. at 889-\n90 (Kansas court has jurisdiction over murder prosecution involving victims who had\ndisappeared after last being seen in Missouri). Moreover, the statutory venue rules,\nparticularly K.S.A. 22-2611, were not helpful in Grissom because the victims' bodies\nwere never found. Here, territorial jurisdiction was not an issue, and K.S.A. 22-2603 and\n22-2611 were directly applicable to the evidence developed at trial.\n\n\n       Finally, we believe the language in Instruction No. 11 concerning where \"the\nprosecution may be\" must have been confusing to the jury. Nowhere else in the\ninstructions does it matter where the prosecution may be, and it is reasonable to believe\nthat a juror would conclude that issue had long since been decided. Cf. State v. Rivera, 42\n                                            328\n\fKan. App. 2d 1005, 1011, 219 P.3d 1231 (2009) (\"A juror might conclude that\nInstruction No. 9 was supposed to modify Instruction No. 4 so as to allow the crime to\nhave been committed either in Kingman County or its neighboring county. That\napparently was the district court's intention. But that's a pretty confusing way to express\nthat concept to lay jurors.\"), rev. denied 290 Kan. 1102 (2010).\n\n\n       The trial court's capital murder elements instructions, requiring the jury find facts\nsupporting venue, were appropriate. See Rivera, 42 Kan. App. 2d at 1010. However, the\nvenue instruction was incomplete, inaccurate, and confusing. As such, we find that\nInstruction No. 11 was erroneous.\n\n\n       3. Was the venue instruction clearly erroneous?\n\n       For Robinson to prevail on this claim, however, the court must be firmly\nconvinced that the jury would have reached a different verdict had the instruction error\nnot occurred, and Robinson has the burden of convincing the court. See Williams, 295\nKan. 506, Syl. ¶ 5.\n\n\n       He argues that the forensic evidence does not support a finding that the deaths\noccurred in Johnson County. To the contrary, as it relates to Count III, the capital murder\nof Lewicka, the State presented compelling forensic and circumstantial evidence that\nRobinson killed Lewicka in her Johnson County apartment.\n\n\n       Robinson leased an apartment for Lewicka at 901A Edgebrook in Olathe. Lewicka\nwas residing at this location at the time of her disappearance around fall 1999. In\nSeptember 1999, Robinson delivered a check for that month's rent to the property\nmanager, Julie Brown, and informed her that he had vacated the apartment even though\nseveral months remained on the term of the lease. Brown later conducted a \"check-out\"\n\n                                            329\n\finspection of Lewicka's apartment and noticed she had left behind a fish tank,\nmicrowave, and table. A substantial portion of the dwelling was unkempt, but the two\nbedrooms had been cleaned meticulously.\n\n\n         On October 12, 2000, law enforcement officers searched Lewicka's apartment for\ntrace evidence. In the southwest bedroom, one of the rooms that had been cleaned\nmeticulously, the officers found hundreds of small reddish-brown spots on the south wall\nthat tested presumptively positive for blood. Subsequent testing confirmed the blood\nmatched Lewicka's DNA.\n\n\n         When law enforcement officers discovered Lewicka's body inside a metal drum at\nRobinson's Linn County property, she was partially clothed in a nightshirt. Law\nenforcement officers also recovered a pillow and pillowcase from inside the barrel that\nmatched the pattern of Lewicka's bedsheets, which Robinson had since given to his\nparamour, Barbara Sandre. This circumstantial evidence lent further support to the State's\ntheory that Robinson had killed Lewicka as she slept or lay in her bed at the Olathe\napartment.\n\n         Other than her body, there was little evidence connecting Lewicka's murder to\nLinn County. There was a small bloodstain on a roll of duct tape recovered from\nRobinson's Linn County trailer that matched Lewicka's DNA. Law enforcement officers\nalso found several strips of duct tape inside the barrel containing Lewicka's body.\nHowever, this evidence also was consistent with the State's theory that Robinson killed\nLewicka in Johnson County and transported her body to Linn County to conceal the\ncrime.\n\n\n         With regard to Count II, the capital murder of Trouten, Robinson is correct that the\nforensic evidence did not clearly establish the location of Trouten's murder. In fact,\n\n                                             330\n\fduring closing argument, the State argued that Robinson \"perhaps\" killed Trouten inside\nher room at the Guesthouse Suites in Lenexa or inside the trailer at his Linn County\nproperty but admitted the theories were speculative. If anything, the State's forensic\nevidence presented a more convincing case that Robinson killed Trouten inside his Linn\nCounty trailer because of the trace evidence identified at this location, including blood\nsamples and a hair root matching Trouten's DNA.\n\n\n       Robinson's argument in support of clear error focuses on the forensic evidence\nsuggesting a greater probability that Robinson killed Trouten in Linn County than in\nJohnson County. Robinson's argument presumes incorrectly that the location of the\nmurder alone is determinative of the venue question. However, K.S.A. 22-2603 provides\nthat \"where two or more acts are requisite to the commission of any crime and such acts\noccur in different counties the prosecution may be in any county in which any of such\nacts occur.\" The existence of a common scheme or course of conduct connecting the\nmurders is one of the acts requisite to the commission of capital murder under K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) as charged in Counts II and III. To the extent Robinson engaged in conduct\nwithin Johnson County that established or furthered the alleged common scheme or\ncourse of conduct, such evidence not only satisfies an element of the offense but also\nestablishes Johnson County as an appropriate venue.\n\n\n       At trial, the State presented evidence that Robinson employed a common scheme\nor course of conduct characterized by luring women to Johnson County, exploiting them\nfinancially or sexually, killing them and disposing of their bodies in a similar fashion, and\nengaging in fraud and deceit to conceal the murders. Given that Robinson resided in and\nran his businesses out of Johnson County, it is not surprising that the State's evidence\noverwhelmingly demonstrated that he carried out this common scheme or course of\nconduct almost exclusively within Johnson County. For example, Robinson lured Trouten\nfrom Michigan to Johnson County with offers of employment, travel, and other benefits.\n                                            331\n\fTo facilitate such luring, Robinson paid for Trouten to stay at the Guesthouse Suites in\nLenexa; paid for a moving truck to transport Trouten's belongings from Michigan to\nJohnson County; and, after her arrival, stored Trouten's belongings in his Olathe storage\nunit and boarded her two dogs at an Olathe animal clinic.\n\n\n       Robinson also employed fraud and deceit to conceal Trouten's murder as part of\nhis common scheme and course of conduct. To facilitate the cover-up, Robinson disposed\nof Trouten's two dogs by reporting them to an Olathe animal control officer; moved\nTrouten's belongings out of her Lenexa hotel room; and made arrangements with a\nresident of Mexico, while she was visiting her son in Johnson County, to mail fraudulent\nletters to Trouten's family members postmarked from Mexico.\n\n\n       Moreover, as to the other victims identified in the capital counts, Robinson carried\nout a substantial portion of his common scheme or course of conduct in Johnson County.\nFor example, in luring Stasi, Robinson held himself out as a successful Johnson County\nbusinessman who had established a program to provide assistance to young women with\nbabies. To successfully lure Stasi, he paid for her to stay at the Roadway Inn in Overland\nPark. To conceal her disappearance, Robinson fabricated an alibi and paid a third party to\nprovide a false statement to Overland Park police consistent with it. At the same time,\nwhile residing in Johnson County, Robinson employed an adoption ruse to conceal the\ndisappearance of Stasi's baby. To complete the scheme, Robinson had his brother execute\nfraudulent adoption paperwork at Robinson's Johnson County business office and pick up\nthe baby at Robinson's home in Stanley.\n\n\n       Robinson also engaged in a variety of conduct within Johnson County to lure and\nthen exploit Sheila and Debbie Faith financially. The State's evidence demonstrated\nRobinson killed both victims to steal their Social Security benefit payments. To do so,\n\n\n                                            332\n\fRobinson set up a private mailbox under their names in Olathe and submitted a change of\naddress form to the SSA directing benefit checks to this Johnson County address.\n\n\n       Robinson's common scheme and course of conduct also included the financial\nexploitation of Beverly Bonner and, later, the use of deceit to conceal her murder. As\nwith the Faiths, Robinson set up a private mailbox in Olathe under Bonner's name.\nBonner's alimony checks were mailed to this Olathe mailbox, and Robinson deposited\nthem into joint bank accounts set up under his and Bonner's names. Robinson also used\nthis mailbox to facilitate his fraudulent letter writing campaign aimed at Bonner's family.\n\n\n       The State presented persuasive forensic and circumstantial evidence that Robinson\nkilled Lewicka at her apartment in Johnson County. Furthermore, the State presented\noverwhelming evidence that Robinson carried out a substantial portion of the common\nscheme and course of conduct common to all six murders within Johnson County, where\nhe lived and conducted business. Based on this evidence, Robinson has failed to firmly\nconvince us that the verdict would have changed but for the instructional error. As such,\nthe district judge's erroneous venue instruction does not constitute clear error.\n\n\n                            12. CUMULATIVE ERROR—GUILT PHASE\n\n       Robinson argues that the cumulative effect of the pretrial and guilt phase errors\nrequire the court to reverse all of his convictions.\n\n\nLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       \"Cumulative error, considered collectively, may be so great as to require reversal of a\n       defendant's conviction. The test is whether the totality of the circumstances substantially\n       prejudiced the defendant and denied him or her a fair trial. No prejudicial error may be\n       found under the cumulative error doctrine if the evidence against the defendant is\n\n                                                   333\n\f       overwhelming. State v. Cosby, 285 Kan. 230, Syl. ¶ 9, 169 P.3d 1128 (2007). Moreover,\n       this doctrine does not apply if no error or only one error supports reversal. See State v.\n       Carter, 284 Kan. 312, 332, 160 P.3d 457 (2007).\" State v. Dixon, 289 Kan. 46, 71, 209\n       P.3d 675 (2009).\n\n\n       \"This court utilizes a de novo standard when determining whether the totality of\ncircumstances substantially prejudiced a defendant and denied the defendant a fair trial\nbased on cumulative error.\" State v. Brown, 298 Kan. 1040, 1056, 318 P.3d 1005 (2014).\n\n\nDid the Aggregate Effect of Errors Deny Robinson a Right to a Fair Trial?\n\n       As we have already stated, Judge Anderson conducted proceedings with great\ndeference toward and respect for Robinson's fair trial rights. The results speak for\nthemselves. In a highly complex, capital trial that continued for weeks on end, we have\ndetected only three errors.\n\n\n       Robinson's two capital murder convictions, Counts II and III, were multiplicitous\nwith each other, and his conviction for first-degree murder, Count V, was multiplicitous\nwith the capital convictions. However, this had no effect on jurors, and our reversal of the\nsecond capital conviction and the first-degree murder conviction cures any prejudice. We\nalso have ruled that the prosecutor made three isolated remarks that exceeded the scope\nof the evidence. Yet, the cumulative impact of the remarks was not prejudicial. Finally,\nthe trial court's venue instruction was erroneous, but the overwhelming nature of the\nState's evidence established convincingly that this error did not affect the outcome of the\nproceedings.\n\n\n       When considered together, the errors are negligible in comparison to the nature of\nthese proceedings and the enormous weight of the evidence against Robinson.\n\n\n                                                   334\n\fConsidering the totality of the circumstances, we find the cumulative effect of the errors\ndid not substantially prejudice Robinson or deny him the right to a fair trial.\n\n\n               FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND—PENALTY PHASE\n\n\nThe State's Case\n\n       In the penalty phase, the State alleged the existence of one aggravating\ncircumstance: \"That the defendant knowingly or purposely killed more than one person.\"\nThe State asked the jury to consider all the guilt phase evidence presented during its case-\nin-chief relevant to this aggravator in deciding the sentence.\n\n\nThe Defendant's Case\n\n       Robinson alleged the existence of several mitigating circumstances, including:\n\n\n                \"1. If not sentenced to death, the defendant will peacefully spend the rest of his\n       life in prison.\n                \"2. The defendant is likely to make a satisfactory adjustment to prison life.\n                \"3. If the defendant is not sentenced to death, a term of imprisonment is sufficient\n       to defend and protect the people's safety.\n                \"4. If the defendant receives a life sentence, he will be able to maintain a\n       relationship with his wife, children, grandchildren and other family members.\n                \"5. Defendant's family will suffer grief and loss if he is executed.\n                \"6. The degree to which, if any, others may have participated in the crimes and\n       share a degree of moral culpability or blame.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                    335\n\f       1. Maintaining family relationships and familial grief\n\n       The defense called Nancy Robinson to testify in support of mitigating\ncircumstances 4 and 5, maintaining family relationships if sentenced to life and familial\ngrief if sentenced to death.\n\n\n       Nancy testified that she met Robinson in 1963 in Oak Park, Illinois. They married\nseveral months later and moved to the Kansas City area in late 1963 or early 1964.\nRobinson and Nancy had four children. Nancy said Robinson played an important role in\nthe lives of his children and actively participated in and attended their activities. Even\nwhen Robinson served time in state prison in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the children\nvisited him and their relationship remained strong. All of Robinson's children grew to be\nproductive and contributing members of their communities.\n\n\n       Robinson was also involved in the lives of his grandchildren. Robinson's youngest\ndaughter, Christy, had a daughter and younger son. Robinson was involved in the lives of\nboth of Christy's children and babysat them on a regular basis while their parents were at\nwork. Robinson shared a particularly close relationship with Christy's daughter, who\nspent time with Robinson every day. Robinson's arrest affected her the most because she\nviewed Robinson as a role model or idol. She became so upset that the family arranged\nspecial contact visits, with the approval of sheriff's department personnel, while Robinson\nwas in jail awaiting trial. Christy's daughter continued to talk to Robinson by phone\nduring trial.\n\n\n       Nancy testified that the prospect of Robinson's execution has had a devastating\nimpact on their entire family. If Robinson were sentenced to life imprisonment, Nancy\nsaid, the family would continue to maintain a relationship with him. Nancy, in particular,\nalways stood by Robinson. She testified on his behalf when he was convicted of fraud in\n\n                                             336\n\fJohnson County in 1986. She stayed with him after his theft conviction in Missouri and\nwhen he went back to prison after his probation was revoked. Despite Robinson's\nmultiple, ongoing extramarital affairs, Nancy stayed in the relationship. Even Robinson's\nconviction for capital murder did not break their marriage. Despite everything, Nancy\ntestified that she still shared a bond with Robinson and that it would continue if the jury\nspared his life.\n\n\n       2. Satisfactory adjustment to prison, community safety\n\n       The defense offered the testimony of expert witnesses Mark D. Cunningham and\nPaul Delo in support of mitigating circumstances 1 through 3 (peaceful prison existence,\nsatisfactory adjustment to prison life, and life imprisonment as sufficient to defend and\nprotect the public). The defense retained Cunningham, a clinical and forensic\npsychologist, to conduct a risk assessment of Robinson and render an opinion on his\nfuture dangerousness in prison. The defense retained Delo, a retired prison warden and\ncorrectional consultant, to assess Robinson's propensity for violence in prison.\n\n\n       Cunningham had testified as an expert on more than 150 occasions. He reviewed\ncorrectional records, information about the offenses of conviction, the presentence\nreports, and Robinson's criminal history and educational and medical records.\nCunningham also interviewed Robinson's family members and correctional officials who\nsupervised Robinson while in custody.\n\n\n       Cunningham compared the case-specific facts he gathered from these records with\nrisk assessment factors established in the field of forensic psychology and other statistical\ninformation on prison adjustment. Through this comparative analysis, Cunningham\nidentified four key factors, in decreasing order of significance, supporting his opinion that\nRobinson would experience a positive, nonviolent adjustment in the prison system,\n\n                                            337\n\fincluding: (1) his age; (2) his past behavioral history in custody; (3) correctional staff\nappraisals; and (4) contact with family and children.\n\n\n              a. Age of Offender\n\n\n       Robinson was born on December 27, 1943, and was 58 years old at the time of\ntrial. Cunningham identified studies showing a significant reduction in the risk of prison\nviolence among offenders who are age 45 years or older, referring to this phenomenon as\nthe \"aging effect.\" This aging effect is generally consistent with data among the general\npopulation that shows a decreasing tendency for violence with increased age.\nCunningham noted that research confirms this aging effect still holds true and applies\nequally to offenders who commit violent crimes at an advanced age, such as in\nRobinson's case. Delo corroborated this testimony, confirming that as an inmate ages, the\nrisk of violence decreases. He opined that an inmate's age is the most significant factor\ninfluencing propensity for violence.\n\n\n              b. Prior Behavioral History in Custody\n\n\n       Cunningham identified Robinson's past behavioral history in prison as the second\nrisk assessment factor relevant to his analysis. Cunningham and Delo testified that an\ninmate's conduct during prior incarcerations is often an indicator of future behavior.\n\n\n       Robinson served a 40-month term of imprisonment with Kansas Department of\nCorrections (KDOC) from 1987 to 1991. Thereafter, he was transferred to the Western\nMissouri Correctional Center for 22 months. Following his arrest in June 2000, Robinson\nwas detained at the Johnson County jail for 22 months awaiting trial. Cunningham found\nit particularly relevant that Robinson served all of his time in custody after murdering\n\n\n                                             338\n\fStasi because this showed he was already prone to violence before entering the prison\nsystem.\n\n\n       Robinson was not involved in any acts of serious violence during his 62-month\nstint in the state prison system or his 22-month stay in county jail. Cunningham found\nonly a few minor disciplinary infractions in Robinson's record. First, in the Johnson\nCounty jail, Robinson was written up for bringing a salt shaker back to his cell, which he\nused to create a saltwater rinse for his sore throat. Second, at KDOC, Robinson received a\nwritten infraction for using a typewriter to draft 17 grievances that he distributed to other\ninmates. Finally, in Missouri, he received a written infraction for failing to take his\nprescribed medication. Delo testified that an exemplary inmate will receive five or fewer\ndisciplinary infractions a year, making Robinson's record one of the best he had seen\nduring his time working within the Missouri prison system.\n\n\n       Instead of turning to violence, Cunningham found that Robinson used his time in\ncustody constructively and had a positive \"work adjustment\" in the prison setting.\nRobinson worked on an inmate building crew and performed a substantial amount of\ncomputer work for the benefit of the prison. Delo testified that Robinson also took\nadvantage of several educational and training opportunities.\n\n\n              c. Appraisal of Correctional Staff\n\n\n       Cunningham testified that correctional staff's assessment and appraisal of an\ninmate is a relevant factor in predicting his or her propensity for violence in prison.\n\n\n       Cunningham found that staff's appraisals of Robinson were favorable. Robinson\nbegan his term at KDOC in maximum security, but he was reduced to medium security\nwithin several months. Robinson began his pretrial confinement at the Johnson County\n                                             339\n\fDetention Center in a medium security setting but was later transferred to maximum\nsecurity when the State charged him with capital murder. Even so, officials at the\nJohnson County jail allowed Robinson's granddaughter to have contact visits with him,\nwhich suggested to Cunningham that their compassion for the young girl outweighed any\nconcern they had about Robinson's propensity for violence.\n\n\n       Cunningham interviewed two staff members at KDOC who had supervised\nRobinson, and both confirmed he was an exceptional worker. One of the staff members\nnoted that Robinson was particularly skilled in the field of computer technology and that\nprison officials had Robinson troubleshoot computer problems and develop software\nprograms used by the prison. However, both of these correctional officials told\nCunningham that Robinson fraudulently altered documents containing their signatures\nand used them to bolster his position before the parole board.\n\n\n              d. Relationship with Family\n\n\n       Cunningham identified an inmate's relationship with family as the final assessment\nfactor, explaining that inmates who are in routine contact with their families tend to have\nbetter prison adjustment and fewer disciplinary issues. Cunningham testified that during\nthe 22 months Robinson spent in pretrial detention, his wife, youngest daughter, and\ngranddaughter visited him with some regularity.\n\n\n              e. Other Risk Factors\n\n\n       Cunningham knew Robinson used computers and the Internet to perpetrate a\nnumber of his crimes of conviction. Nevertheless, he expressed little concern with\nRobinson's history of computer use in prison because he would be placed in a maximum\nsecurity setting, which he presumed would offer Robinson little to no opportunity to have\n                                            340\n\funsupervised access to the Internet. Cunningham also observed that Robinson's previous\ncomputer activity in prison was focused on software and troubleshooting, not Internet\nactivity. Cunningham admitted, however, that he did not speak to KDOC officials\nregarding their policy and did not know definitively whether Robinson would have\nInternet access in its facilities.\n\n\n       Cunningham also testified that the violent nature of Robinson's offenses did not\nincrease his propensity for violence in prison. Cunningham highlighted studies conducted\nby the United States Department of Justice that found that an inmate's conviction for\nviolent crime was not a reliable predictor of prison adjustment and did not correlate with\nhigher rates of prison violence. Cunningham also explained that Robinson had committed\nviolent crimes in the community before entering the prison system, yet he exhibited no\npropensity for violence while incarcerated.\n\n\n       Cunningham admitted that Robinson had a history of deception both inside and\noutside of the prison setting, and he predicted this behavior would continue. Delo also\nconfirmed that as an inmate ages, he may rely more on manipulation or deception in\norder to survive and thrive within the prison system. However, Cunningham believed\nRobinson's use of deceit inside prison was motivated primarily by his desire to secure an\nearlier release, and Robinson would have no such opportunity with his crimes of\nconviction.\n\n\n       Cunningham could not completely rule out the possibility that Robinson might use\ndeceit and manipulation to further a plan of escape, but he noted that Robinson had\nshown no propensity for flight and cited data illustrating the extraordinarily low\npercentage of successful escapes from maximum security prisons.\n\n\n\n\n                                              341\n\f       Cunningham also had no serious concerns about Robinson's history of\nmanipulating women inside prison, particularly Bonner. Cunningham explained that\nRobinson would be placed in a much higher security level, limiting his interaction with\nand access to prison staff. Also, Cunningham believed that Bonner knew Robinson only\nas a white collar criminal. In the future, it would be harder for Robinson to manipulate\nwomen behind bars because he is widely known for luring, deceiving, and killing\nmultiple women. However, Delo admitted that it is not uncommon for prison staff to\nform relationships with and fall victim to the manipulation of inmates within the system.\n\n\n       Based on his assessment of the key risk factors, Cunningham opined that\nRobinson would have a positive adjustment to prison free from violence. Delo offered a\nsimilar opinion.\n\n\n       3. Residual Doubt\n\n\n       In support of mitigating circumstance 6, Robinson argued that there was residual\ndoubt as to whether he acted alone, suggesting that his moral culpability should be\ndiminished by or shared with his cohorts. In closing argument, Robinson's counsel\nhighlighted evidence, including the weight of the barrels housing the bodies and the\nunidentified fingerprints found on the plastic sheeting inside his Raymore, Missouri,\nstorage locker and on the roll of duct tape stained with Lewicka's blood, as proof of\nothers' involvement.\n\n\n       4. Mercy\n\n       Finally, Robinson's counsel asked the jury to consider mercy as an independent\nbasis for imposing a life sentence. Robinson's counsel acknowledged his client did not\n\n\n\n                                            342\n\f\"deserve\" mercy, but he asked the jury to grant it for the sake of Robinson's family and in\nlight of the residual doubt surrounding his role in the capital murders.\n\n\nJury Deliberations and Verdict\n\n       The parties put on evidence in support of their penalty phase cases on October 31,\n2002, and the cause was submitted to the jury on November 1, 2002.\n\n\n       During the evening of November 1, 2002, Juror 147 consulted a Gideon Bible that\nhe found in the hotel room where the jury had been sequestered. Juror 147 had essentially\nmade up his mind to vote for a sentence of death and consulted the Bible to see if\nanything would force him to reconsider. Juror 147 wrote down the book and verse\nnumbers of passages he had consulted, but not the Biblical text itself, on a slip of paper\nthat he placed inside the Bible. He testified that nothing in the Bible aided him in arriving\nat his sentencing decision, which remained unchanged after consulting the Bible.\n\n\n       On Saturday, November 2, 2002, at approximately 9:15 a.m., the jurors entered the\njury room to resume deliberations. Juror 147 brought the Bible with the slip of paper into\nthe jury room. The jury immediately took a vote by written ballot and determined that all\njurors were in unanimous agreement as to the proper sentence. The foreman testified that\nat that point the sentence had been decided and all that remained was for him to sign the\nverdict form and inform the district judge. After the vote, the jurors engaged in a general\nconversation about their time on the jury. The conversation was brief and several jurors\ndescribed it as a moment of decompression or unwinding after a long and arduous trial.\nDuring the conversation, Juror 147 told another juror that he had learned from the Bible\nthat in order to be granted mercy, one must ask for mercy, repent, and forgive. Juror 147\ndid not read from or quote any particular verse in making these remarks. Instead, he\nshared his view or interpretation of what the Bible says about the concept of mercy based\n\n                                            343\n\fon his review from the night before. None of the jurors read from or consulted the Bible\nthat Juror 147 had brought into the jury room.\n\n\n       In the meantime, a bailiff had observed Juror 147 enter the jury room with the\nBible and informed the district judge, who removed the juror, along with the Bible,\naround 9:20 a.m., approximately 5 minutes after the jury had resumed deliberations. The\ndistrict judge called each juror independently and inquired into the matter before allowing\nthe parties to make their own inquiry. One juror thought Juror 147 might have opened the\nBible at one point and quoted from one of the verses in the jury room, but he was not\nconfident about the accuracy of this fact. The other 10 jurors testified that Juror 147 did\nnot read from or quote any verse from the Bible during deliberations that morning or at\nany time prior.\n\n\n       The defense moved for a mistrial on the penalty phase proceeding only. The\ndistrict judge found that Juror 147 had brought the Bible into the jury room but had not\nread or quoted from it during deliberations, and the statement Juror 147 made in\nreference to the Bible occurred after the parties had arrived at a unanimous decision on\nsentence. Judge Anderson, relying on the then-recently published opinion in State v.\nKleypas, 272 Kan. 894, 40 P.3d 139 (2001), cert. denied 537 U.S. 834 (2002), overruled\non other grounds by Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429\n(2006), concluded that these events did not \"play a major role in the deliberations to this\npoint\" and denied the motion.\n\n\n       However, Judge Anderson provided the following supplemental instruction:\n\n\n               \"What the Bible says about the appropriateness of a death penalty in a particular\n       case is not a legitimate concern of a penalty phase jury. The law specifies when the death\n\n\n\n                                                  344\n\f       penalty is appropriate. A jury may not independently consult the biblical scriptures for\n       guidance in reaching its life and death decision.\"\n\n\nJudge Anderson delivered the supplemental instruction to the jury and released them to\ncontinue deliberations. A short time later, the jury returned a verdict of death on both\ncapital murder counts.\n\n\n       The court sentenced Robinson on January 21, 2003. The court imposed a sentence\nof death on the capital murder convictions, Counts II and III. Robinson was sentenced to\n246 months in prison for the aggravated kidnapping of Suzette Trouten, Count I; 7\nmonths for the theft of Vicki Neufeld's property, Count IV; a life sentence with parole\neligibility after 15 years for the first-degree premeditated murder of Lisa Stasi, Count V;\nand a pre-Guidelines sentence of 5 to 20 years or a post-Guidelines sentence of 13\nmonths for the continuing offense of aggravated interference with parental custody,\nCount VI. Robinson was further ordered to pay restitution in the amount of $9,122.24.\n\n\n       During sentencing, neither the court nor the parties addressed whether the crimes\nof conviction were sexually motivated. After sentencing, Judge Anderson designated\nCounts I, II, and III as sexually motivated in the journal entry of judgment.\n\n\n                                      PENALTY PHASE ISSUES\n\n\n                                      13. JUROR MISCONDUCT\n\n       Robinson contends that the district judge erred in denying his motion for mistrial\nfounded on Juror 147's alleged misconduct regarding his use of the Bible.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   345\n\fLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n               \"K.S.A. 22-3423(1)(c) permits a trial court to declare a mistrial because of\n       prejudicial conduct, in or outside the courtroom, which makes it impossible to proceed\n       with the trial without injustice to the defendant or the prosecution. Applying the statute, a\n       trial court must engage in a two-step analysis. First, the trial court must decide if there is\n       some fundamental failure of the proceeding. If so, in the second step of the analysis, the\n       trial court must assess whether it is possible to continue the trial without an injustice. This\n       means that if there is prejudicial conduct, the trial court must determine if the damaging\n       effect can be removed or mitigated by admonition or instruction to the jury. If not, the\n       trial court must determine whether the degree of prejudice results in an injustice and, if\n       so, declare a mistrial.\" State v. Ward, 292 Kan. 541, Syl. ¶ 1, 256 P.3d 801 (2011), cert.\n       denied 132 S. Ct. 1594 (2012).\n\n\n       \"On appeal, the trial court's decision denying a motion for mistrial is reviewed\nunder an abuse of discretion standard.\" State v. Williams, 299 Kan. 509, 559, 324 P.3d\n1078 (2014). When reviewing the denial of a motion for mistrial founded on claims of\njuror misconduct, we consider whether the trial court abused its discretion in\ndetermining: \"(1) whether juror misconduct occurred and (2) if so, whether the\nmisconduct substantially prejudiced [defendant's] right to a fair trial.\" State v. Armstrong,\n299 Kan. 405, 442, 324 P.3d 1052 (2014). Judicial discretion is abused if the ruling is\narbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable, i.e., no reasonable person would have taken the view\nadopted by the trial court, or if it is based on an error of law or fact. State v. Gonzalez,\n290 Kan. 747, 755-56, 234 P.3d 1 (2010). The burden of proving error rests with the\nparty alleging the misconduct. State v. Wells, 297 Kan. 741, 754, 305 P.3d 568 (2013).\nHowever, once error is established, the burden to demonstrate prejudice or the lack\nthereof shifts to the party benefitting from the error. Ward, 292 Kan. at 578.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    346\n\fDid Juror 147's Use of the Bible Constitute Juror Misconduct?\n\n       \"Juror misconduct is a broad label which has been used to describe\ncommunications with jurors from outsiders, witnesses, bailiffs, or judges; and actions by\njurors in the unauthorized viewing of premises, or reading of newspaper articles.\" State v.\nFenton, 228 Kan. 658, 664, 620 P.2d 813 (1980). \"Ordinarily, jury misconduct occurs\nwhen, during deliberations, a jury considers matters completely outside the evidence and\nissues in the case.\" State v. Leaper, 291 Kan. 89, Syl. ¶ 4, 238 P.3d 266 (2010). Such\nmisconduct runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which\nguarantees criminal defendants the right to a fair and impartial trial by a jury capable of\ndeciding the issues based solely on the evidence. 291 Kan. at 97. \"Juror misconduct is not\na ground for . . . mistrial unless it is shown to have substantially prejudiced a party's\nrights.\" Fenton, 228 Kan. at 664.\n\n\n       Robinson argues Juror 147 committed misconduct by referring to the Bible at his\nhotel room after deliberations had concluded for the day, by bringing the Bible into the\njury room at the outset of the second day of deliberations, and by making comments to\nother jurors about his interpretation of what the Bible says about the concept of mercy.\nThe State concedes that Juror 147 engaged in misconduct. We note, however, that our\nprecedent does not clearly establish that the State's concession is legally compelled. See\nKleypas, 272 Kan. at 970 (trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a recall or\ninquiry where juror quoted Biblical passage during penalty phase deliberations). Other\ncourts considering this issue have decided there was no error in similar circumstances.\nSee, e.g., Robinson v. Polk, 438 F.3d 350, 363-64 (4th Cir. 2006) (state court's finding\nthat jury's reading of Bible during sentencing deliberations in capital proceeding did not\nviolate Sixth Amendment is neither contrary to nor unreasonable application of clearly\nestablished federal law); Lenz v. Washington, 444 F.3d 295, 310-12 (4th Cir. 2006)\n(following Robinson); United States v. Rodriguez, 667 F. Supp. 2d 218, 222 (D. Mass.\n\n                                             347\n\f2009) (\"There is no proscription on jurors reading the Bible before or after deliberations,\nor having a personal Bible in their possession.\"), aff'd 675 F.3d 48, 59-61 (1st Cir. 2012);\ncf. State v. DeMille, 756 P.2d 81, 84 (Utah 1988) (juror's communication to other jurors\nthat defendant's guilt was revealed to her through prayer did not constitute extraneous\ninfluence undermining jury's verdict). Today, we need not, and do not, decide that juror\nmisconduct necessarily results from the use of outside religious texts. But, based on the\nState's concession, we presume that Juror 147 engaged in misconduct and focus our\ndiscussion on the second prong of the analysis—prejudice.\n\n\nDid Juror 147's Conduct Substantially Prejudice Robinson's Fair Trial Rights?\n\n       A juror's use of or reliance on the Bible during penalty phase deliberations is not\nso uniquely influential that it warrants a finding of prejudice per se. United States v.\nLara-Ramirez, 519 F.3d 76, 88-89 (1st Cir. 2008) (no \"per se rule that juror discussion of\nthe Bible in the jury room during deliberations creates an incurable taint\"). Thus we are\ncharged with the task of deciding whether Judge Anderson abused his discretion in\nconcluding that Robinson's fair trial rights were not substantially prejudiced by Juror\n147's conduct. See Armstrong, 299 Kan. at 442.\n\n\n       Because Robinson asserts error of a constitutional magnitude, we can affirm his\ndeath sentence only if \"there is no reasonable possibility that the juror's misconduct\naffected the outcome of the trial.\" See Williams, 299 Kan. at 562. Moreover, in\nconducting this analysis, we are mindful that our prejudice inquiry must be limited to\nobjective facts rather than the subjective evidence of the jurors' mental impressions. See\nK.S.A. 60-441; K.S.A. 60-444.\n\n\n       Robinson claims he was prejudiced by Juror 147's consultation of the Bible, his\ndecision to bring it into the jury room, and his comments referencing it during\n\n                                             348\n\fdeliberations. As to Juror 147's independent review of the Bible after deliberations had\nconcluded for the day, courts have been reluctant to condemn such conduct. In Billings v.\nPolk, 441 F.3d 238, 248 (4th Cir. 2006), a juror declared by affidavit that on the night\nbefore the jury's sentencing deliberations, he read the Bible at home because he was\n\"'very confused and didn't know what to do,' and that his study of the Bible helped him\nconclude that the death penalty was the 'right sentence.'\" The Fourth Circuit held that it\nwas neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law to conclude that a\njuror's private consultation of the Bible outside deliberations did not violate the Sixth\nAmendment. 441 F.3d at 248-49.\n\n\n       As to Juror 147's decision to bring the Bible into the jury room, the district judge\nfound, based on the jurors' testimony, that they did not read from or use it as a resource\nduring deliberations. This finding is supported by substantial competent evidence and is\nentitled to deference. See Venters v. Sellers, 293 Kan. 87, 93, 261 P.3d 538 (2011).\nMoreover, the mere presence of the Bible in the jury room, standing alone, is not deemed\nto have affected any juror's sentencing decision. See Ackerman v. State, 737 So. 2d 1145,\n1148 (Fla. Dist. App. 1999) (mere presence of Bible in jury room during deliberations is\nnot prejudicial).\n\n\n       Finally, as to Juror 147's comments regarding his view of what the Bible says\nabout mercy, there is no reasonable possibility they affected the jurors' sentencing\ndecision. The juror did not read from the Bible or quote any particular verse. Instead, he\nmade a brief remark expressing his opinion or interpretation about what the Bible says\nregarding mercy. See, e.g., Bieghler v. State, 690 N.E.2d 188, 203 (Ind. 1997)\n(\"'conscientious people who are faced with a life and death decision resort to their\nreligious scruples in making such decision'\" and \"[s]uch deep introspection neither\nviolates principles of justice nor prejudices the defendant\"); Young v. State, 2007 OK CR\n17, ¶¶ 111-13, 12 P.3d 20 (Okla. Crim. App. 2000) (juror discussion of biblical propriety\n                                             349\n\fof death penalty or their religious beliefs while deliberating death penalty is not offensive\nto defendant's Sixth Amendment rights); see also Perkins v. State, 144 So. 3d 457, 496\n(Ala. Crim. App. 2012) (\"'[T]he situation where a juror quotes the Bible from memory\n. . . assuredly would not be considered an improper influence.'\"); Lenz v. Warden of the\nSussex I State Prison, 267 Va. 318, 330-31, 593 S.E.2d 292 (2004) (denying habeas relief\nwhere \"a juror recited, by memory, the location of a Bible passage relating to the\nappropriate punishment for murder\").\n\n\n       We embraced a similar rationale in Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 968-70, where the\ndefendant requested vacation of his death sentence or recall of the jury based on evidence\nthat a juror had \"'quoted the Bible'\" to other jurors during deliberations. 272 Kan. at 968.\nHowever, because the juror had merely quoted the biblical passage from memory and did\nnot read from the Bible directly or use it as a source of reference with other jurors during\ndeliberations, we found no error in the district judge's refusal to grant the defendant\nrelief. 272 Kan. at 970.\n\n\n       Here, Juror 147's comments were even more benign because he did not quote a\nBible verse but, instead, gave his interpretation of biblical passages. In addition, Juror\n147's comments were very brief in nature, did not lead to ongoing discussions among\njurors, and were made only after the jury had taken a vote in which all were in unanimous\nagreement as to Robinson's sentence. Faced with far more egregious misconduct, where\nthe Bible was in the jury room and used collaboratively as a resource by jurors during\ndeliberations, courts have found such mitigating factors sufficient to rebut claims of\nprejudice. See Oliver v. Quarterman, 541 F.3d 329, 343-44 (5th Cir. 2008)\n(circumstances, including conflicting evidence as to whether jurors' consultation of Bible\noccurred before or after jury reached decision, evidence that Bible was not the focus of\ndiscussions, and court's instruction to base sentence on facts and law rebutted claim of\nprejudice, notwithstanding fact that biblical passage in question was particularly relevant\n                                             350\n\fto sentencing facts); McNair v. Campbell, 416 F.3d 1291, 1308-09 (11th Cir. 2005) (State\novercame presumption of prejudice where Bible verses that jury foreman read to\nmembers of the jury were innocuous, the extraneous information came from a juror and\nnot the judge, and the strength of the government's evidence was overwhelming); People\nv. Danks, 32 Cal. 4th 269, 308-09, 8 Cal. Rptr. 3d 767, 82 P.3d 1249 (2004) (juror's\nmisconduct in sharing Bible passages with fellow jurors did not establish a substantial\nlikelihood of actual bias, given that conduct was isolated, that there was no evidence of\nongoing discussion about the verses shared with other jurors, and that other comments\nregarding jurors' Christian beliefs did not constitute misconduct).\n\n\n       Furthermore, the court's curative instruction provided additional assurance that\nJuror 147's conduct did not prejudice Robinson's right to a fair penalty phase proceeding.\nWithin minutes after Juror 147 had entered the jury room with the Bible, Judge Anderson\nhad removed him and confiscated the Bible and his notes. The district judge spent the\nnext 5 hours conducting a thorough examination of each juror to assess the extent to\nwhich each or the group had relied upon the Bible in the course of deliberations. Judge\nAnderson's inquiry was supplemented by the parties' own examination of the jurors.\nArmed with this information and fully informed of the circumstances, Judge Anderson\ndetermined the proceedings could continue without injustice to Robinson. Nevertheless,\nout of an abundance of caution, he delivered a supplemental written instruction directing\njurors to decide defendant's sentence without reference to or reliance on the Bible. The\ninstruction was legally appropriate and calculated to remove any taint created by Juror\n147's conduct.\n\n\n       In some contexts, juror instructions are insufficient to cure the taint created by\nprejudicial information. However, courts have not found jurors' use of the Bible during\ndeliberations to be immune to curative instruction. In Lara-Ramirez, the First Circuit\nreviewed a district court's decision to declare a mistrial based on the fact that a juror\n                                             351\n\fbrought a Bible into the jury room, referred to specific portions of the text, and told\nfellow jurors that they should consider what God says in the Bible in their deliberations.\nIn reversing the order granting a mistrial, the First Circuit found the district court had\nemployed a legally incorrect presumption that curative instructions would be inadequate\nafter the jury had embarked upon deliberations. \"Our case law does not support such a\nrestrictive view of curative instructions. Although the issue does not arise often, [citation\nomitted], we have held that curative instructions are an appropriate remedy when jurors\nare exposed, during their deliberations, to extraneous materials.\" 519 F.3d at 87. The First\nCircuit concluded that \"[w]e cannot assume, as the district court apparently did, that\nindividual voir dire of the jurors and a curative instruction would not have eradicated the\nrisk of prejudice in this case.\" 519 F.3d at 88; see Cross v. Com., No. 2008-SC-000465-\nMR, 2009 WL 4251649, at *9-10 (Ky. 2009) (unpublished opinion) (curative instruction\ncured taint from juror's use of the Bible during deliberations).\n\n\n       Robinson argues the curative instruction was ineffective because before making\ninquiry of each juror, Judge Anderson assured each that he or she had done nothing\nwrong. However, when read in context, it was apparent that the jurors were nervous and,\nin some instances, defensive. Judge Anderson made these remarks to calm the jurors so\ntheir responses would be forthright and complete, allowing him to make an informed\ndecision based on an accurate recitation of the facts. Also, the district judge delivered the\ncurative instruction after making such remarks to jurors, and the sequence of events made\nclear that jurors were obligated to set aside biblical influences.\n\n\n       Robinson also cites People v. Hensley, 59 Cal. 4th 788, 175 Cal. Rptr. 3d 213, 330\nP.3d 296 (2014), in support of his claim of prejudicial misconduct. However, in Hensley,\nthe juror actually consulted with his minister during the course of deliberations, speaking\nat length about mercy and the death penalty. The minister's comments sent a clear signal\nto the juror that \"mercy, sympathy, and grace are inconsistent with the 'law of the land,'\n                                             352\n\fthat persons who kill must themselves be killed, and that just as a police officer has to kill\nin the line of duty, a juror must 'go with the law of the land.'\" 59 Cal. 4th at 826-27. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court found the conduct prejudicial because the juror actively\nsolicited his pastor's comments while he was still wrestling with his decision and was\ngiven directions inconsistent with the jury instructions. 59 Cal. 4th at 827-28.\n\n\n       Here, Juror 147 consulted the Bible personally and did not engage in\nconversations with any nonjuror, let alone his personal minister, about the Bible's stance\non the death penalty. This fact is important because Hensley recognized a legally\nsignificant distinction between a juror's personal resort to religious values and his or her\ndecision to consult a minister for guidance in deciding the sentence. 59 Cal. 4th at 826-\n28. Also, the juror in Hensley was still struggling with the sentencing decision when he\nconferred with the pastor. Here, Juror 147 made his comments after the jury had taken a\nvote, reaching unanimous agreement as to sentence. Hensley is distinguishable.\n\n\n       Viewing the totality of the circumstances, we are confident that Juror 147's\nconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Chapman v. California, 386 U.S.\n18, 24, 875 S. Ct. 24, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967). He consulted the Bible outside of\ndeliberations, did not use or read from the Bible in the jury room, and made an isolated\nremark about the Bible's views on mercy only after the jury's vote evidenced unanimous\nagreement as to sentence. Furthermore, the juror's comment was brief and did not lead to\nongoing discussions, and the district judge provided an appropriate curative instruction.\nSee People v. Mincey, 2 Cal. 4th 408, 466-67, 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 822, 827 P.2d 388 (1992)\n(no prejudice where trial judge removed and questioned jurors promptly after learning\njuror had brought Bible into the jury room and provided curative instruction).\n\n\n\n\n                                             353\n\f14. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING STATE'S AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE\n\n       Robinson challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the State's lone\naggravating circumstance—that defendant knowingly or purposely killed more than one\nperson. More particularly, Robinson argues we have defined \"aggravating circumstance\"\nso narrowly that the State's evidence did not fall within the scope of the definition.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       \"The standard of review on appeal as to the sufficiency of evidence regarding an\n       aggravating circumstance is whether, after review of all the evidence, viewed in the light\n       most favorable to the prosecution, the appellate court is convinced that a rational\n       factfinder could have found the existence of the aggravating circumstance beyond a\n       reasonable doubt.\" Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1019.\n\n\n       However, to the extent Robinson's argument is dependent on an interpretation of\nthe aggravating circumstances statute, we review his challenge de novo. See Dodge City\nImplement, Inc. v. Board of Barber County Comm'rs, 288 Kan. 619, 638, 205 P.3d 1265\n(2009) (\"Interpretation or construction of a statute raises a question of law reviewable on\nappeal under a de novo standard.\").\n\n\nWas the Evidence Sufficient to Support the State's Aggravating Circumstance?\n\n       The State's lone aggravating circumstance is set out in K.S.A. 21-4625(2), which\nprovides that \"[a]ggravating circumstances shall be limited to the following: . . . (2) The\ndefendant knowingly or purposely killed or created a great risk of death to more than one\nperson.\"\n\n\n       To establish the existence of this aggravating circumstance, Robinson believes the\nstatute requires the State to prove that the killing of more than one person occurred\n                                                   354\n\fduring the course of the charged murder. More specifically, Robinson seems to believe\nthe statute limits the operation of the aggravator to situations in which more than one\nperson is killed essentially at the same time. He then argues that Stasi, Sheila Faith,\nDebbie Faith, and Bonner were not killed during the course of, or in conjunction with, the\nmurders of the primary capital murder victims, Trouten and Lewicka, and, therefore, the\nState failed to establish the existence of this aggravating circumstance.\n\n\n       Robinson's application of the statute is flawed. He cites to our hard 40 precedent,\nState v. Brady, 261 Kan. 109, 929 P.2d 132 (1996), and State v. Spain, 263 Kan. 708, 953\nP.2d 1004 (1998), in support of his argument. In Brady, we held that a trial court may\nimpose a hard 40 sentence for a first-degree murder conviction if the defendant\nknowingly or purposefully killed more than one person in the course of the charged\nmurder. 261 Kan. at 113. In Spain, we recognized that under K.S.A. 21-4636(b), there\nmust be a direct relationship or nexus between the multiple murders or the great risk of\ndeath to more than one person, i.e., the aggravating circumstance, and the charged\nmurder. However, we made clear that such a risk need not be contemporaneous with the\nhomicide. 263 Kan. at 718. Thereafter, in State v. Hazelton, 267 Kan. 384, 386, 985 P.2d\n698 (1999), we acknowledged that proof of the aggravating circumstance did not require\nthat the multiple murders occur contemporaneously and held that K.S.A. 21-4636(b) was\napplicable because the killings there occurred during the same course of conduct.\n\n\n       Here, the State's evidence established that all of the murders charged in the capital\ncounts (the primary capital victims, Lewicka and Trouten, along with the other victims,\nStasi, the Faiths, and Bonner) were connected together as part of a \"common scheme or\ncourse of conduct\" under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). The existence of such a common scheme\nor course of conduct demonstrates a sufficient nexus between Robinson's killing of more\nthan one person, the aggravating circumstance, and the charged capital offenses. As such,\nwe find K.S.A. 21-4652(2) applies to all of the murders identified in the capital charges\n                                             355\n\fand hold that the State's evidence was sufficient to support the existence of the \"multiple\nmurders\" aggravating circumstance. Cf. State v. Gleason, 299 Kan. 1127, 1187, 329 P.3d\n1102 (2014) (using risk of death to more than one person as both a narrowing\nqualification for the death penalty at the guilt phase and an aggravating factor at the\npenalty phase constitutionally permissible and in conformance with legislative intent),\ncert. granted 135 S. Ct. 1698 (2015).\n\n\n                     15. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT—PENALTY PHASE\n\n        Robinson claims the prosecutor committed several acts of misconduct that\ndeprived him of his right to a fair penalty phase proceeding and requests the court vacate\nhis death sentences. Particularly, Robinson believes he was prejudiced by misstatements\nof the law concerning mitigating circumstances during voir dire, improper cross-\nexamination of mitigation witnesses, and the prosecutor's closing argument remarks.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n        We apply the traditional two-step framework in analyzing Robinson's penalty\nphase prosecutorial misconduct challenges, considering first whether the prosecutor\nexceeded the permissible scope of his or her authority by engaging in the challenged\nconduct and, if so, whether defendant suffered prejudice as a result. Kleypas, 272 Kan. at\n1084.\n\n\n        However, in the prejudice analysis, the framework varies slightly from that used in\nthe guilt phase analysis. To the extent the court employs a harmless error analysis as part\nof the prejudice inquiry, we have described the standard as follows:\n\n\n                \"Thus, the standard of review and the ultimate question that must be answered\n        with regard to whether prosecutorial misconduct in the penalty phase of a capital trial was\n                                                   356\n\f      harmless is whether the court is able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n      prosecutorial misconduct, viewed in the light of the record as a whole, had little, if any,\n      likelihood of changing the jury's ultimate conclusion regarding the weight of the\n      aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In this determination, the overwhelming\n      nature of the evidence is a factor to be considered, although its impact is limited. Also, in\n      making the determination as to whether an error was harmless, it is important to\n      recognize that the question for the reviewing court is not what effect the constitutional\n      error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury but, rather, what effect\n      it had upon the actual verdict in the case at hand. Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275,\n      279, 124 L. Ed. 2d 182, 113 S. Ct. 2078 (1993). 'The inquiry, in other words, is not\n      whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a [verdict for death] would surely have\n      been rendered, but whether the [death verdict] actually rendered in this trial was surely\n      unattributable to the error.' 508 U.S. at 279.\" Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1087-88.\n\n\nAlleged Misconduct during Closing Argument\n\n      Robinson argues that the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial misconduct during\nclosing argument by: (1) commenting on Robinson's demeanor; (2) making an argument\nunsupported by the evidence; (3) unfairly attacking Nancy Robinson; and (4) expressing\nhis personal opinion regarding the quality of defense counsel's argument.\n\n\n      1. Did the prosecutor improperly comment on Robinson's demeanor?\n\n      During the State's rebuttal portion of the penalty phase closing, prosecutor\nMorrison argued:\n\n\n              \"When the defendant cried, cried one time during this trial, he didn't cry when\n      there was testimony about Lisa Stasi. He didn't cry when there was testimony about\n      Izabela Lewicka's body was taken out of that barrel. He didn't cry when there was\n      testimony about Suzette Trouten—when her family testified—when her body was taken\n      out of that barrel or Beverly Bonner or Sheila Faith or Debbie Faith. He cried for himself.\n\n                                                  357\n\f       That says it all. He doesn't care anything about anybody but himself. Manipulation and\n       deceit, they go hand in hand with the defendant throughout these last 20 years.\"\n\n\n       Robinson argues these remarks commented improperly on defendant's silence and\ninjected remorse as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. We agree the remark was\nimproper, but on different grounds. The prosecutor's comment pertaining to the one\noccasion Robinson cried during trial was certainly beyond the scope of the penalty phase\nevidence. See State v. Whitaker, 255 Kan. 118, 134, 872 P.2d 278 (1994) (argument\nbeyond evidence improper). The remarks appear to serve no legitimate purpose other\nthan to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jurors and divert their attention from the\ntask at hand—weighing the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and, therefore,\nwere improper. State v. Tosh, 278 Kan. 83, 90, 91 P.3d 1204 (2004) (\"A prosecutor\nshould not make statements intended to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury or\nto divert the jury from its duty to decide the case based on the evidence and the\ncontrolling law.\").\n\n\n       However, the remarks were brief and isolated. The prosecutor referenced\nRobinson's demeanor on only one occasion at the end of his rebuttal closing argument.\nSee State v. Chanthaseng, 293 Kan. 140, 148, 261 P.3d 889 (2011) (when deciding\nwhether conduct is gross and flagrant appellate courts look to whether the prosecutor\nrepeated or emphasized the misconduct). The remark was such that it drew no objection\nfrom the defense. State v. King, 288 Kan. 333, 349, 204 P.3d 585 (2009) (\"the presence\nor absence of an objection may figure into our analysis of the alleged misconduct\"). Nor\ndid the comment run afoul of any prior ruling of the district judge. See Chanthaseng, 293\nKan. at 148-49 (prosecutor's ill will reflected through deliberate and repeated misconduct\nor indifference to prior rulings). We hold the improper comment was not gross and\nflagrant. See State v. Novotny, 297 Kan. 1174, 1190, 307 P.3d 1278 (2013) (even\n\n\n                                                  358\n\fassuming prosecutor's comment on defendant's demeanor was misconduct, isolated\nnature of remarks did not rise to the level of being gross or flagrant).\n\n\n       The brief and isolated nature of the comment also leads us to conclude that it bore\nlittle weight in the minds of jurors during their consideration of the evidence supporting\nthe aggravating and mitigating circumstances. This is particularly true given that the\nremarks comprised a few lines of a closing argument in a multiweek trial recorded in\nthousands of pages of transcript. See State v. Washington, 275 Kan. 644, 672, 68 P.3d\n134 (2003) (improper closing argument remarks in a few lines in a trial transcript over\n1300 pages did not establish prejudice to fair trial rights). The district judge instructed the\njury that arguments of counsel were not to be considered as evidence and that the jury\nwas to decide defendant's sentence by weighing aggravating circumstances against\nmitigating circumstances. Also, the State presented overwhelming evidence supporting\nits lone aggravating circumstance that Robinson killed more than one person, and the\nState effectively challenged and often discredited Robinson's mitigation evidence. In light\nof the totality of the circumstances, we are confident that the prosecutor's remarks had no\neffect on the sentencing decision. See Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1084-85 (citing Chapman,\n386 U.S. at 24); see also Novotny, 297 Kan. at 1190 (comment on demeanor was\nharmless beyond reasonable doubt, given lack of gross or flagrant remarks and solid\nevidence presented by the State).\n\n\n       2. Did the prosecutor make arguments unsupported by the evidence?\n\n       Robinson challenges three instances where the prosecutor allegedly advanced an\nargument unsupported by the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             359\n\f               a. Tender Mercies Comments\n\n\n       During rebuttal closing, prosecutor Morrison argued against Robinson's\nimpassioned plea for mercy during his closing, and in the process used the movie Tender\nMercies as a rhetorical device:\n\n\n       \"There's an old movie out several years that had Robert Duvall, he was a down and out\n       alcoholic country singer and the movie was called Tender Mercies. And in the movie he\n       talks about how hard this guy's life has been and how he was a success at one time. He\n       drank it all away. Now, he's living in some shack with some divorced woman and her\n       little kid and he helps her kind of. He talks in that movie about tender mercies in life, how\n       life is full of tender mercies, these tender mercies are things like being able to hear the\n       rain on the ceiling, getting out of bed in the morning, filling your lungs with air and\n       standing up and stretching or maybe laying in bed for a few extra minutes. Tender\n       mercies are about being able to have a drink of coffee in the morning. Tender mercies are\n       about being able to have visits with loved ones, read letters from them. He wants you to\n       extend all those things to him. He says, gosh, you know, you got you need to, let me live\n       because I'm going to be peaceful in prison, although I haven't demonstrated that.\"\n\n\nThe defense objected, but only to the prosecutor's remark about Robinson claiming he\nwould be peaceful in prison. The district judge sustained the objection and directed the\nprosecutor to proceed.\n\n\n       The prosecutor continued:\n\n\n               \"I've got a history of incredible violence, but let me see my family. When you\n       think of those tender mercies, six dead people in this case, six dead people in this case,\n       they don't have those mercies o[r] they don't get to listen to the rain.\"\n\n\nDefense counsel again objected. The district judge sustained the objection, explaining\nthat the prosecutor was beginning to move past a discussion of the aggravating\n                                                    360\n\fcircumstance and entering into victim impact. As discussed below, we have since\nclarified that a prosecutor may properly introduce evidence of and make argument on\nvictim impact during the penalty phase.\n\n\n       Robinson argues that the prosecutor's Tender Mercies speech constituted\nmisconduct because it was a \"lengthy imaginary script from an actual movie,\" the type\nwe disapproved of in Kleypas. To the contrary, we disagree that the prosecutor's\ncomments were akin to those we found improper in Kleypas. There the prosecutor invited\njurors to speculate what the victim \"'must have thought when [defendant] burst through\nthat door'\"; \"'the anguish she must have felt when she saw that knife'\"; and \"'how long\nthat time must have seemed to [the victim].'\" 272 Kan. at 1112. Then the prosecutor\nprovided answers to those questions through an imaginary script of the deceased victim,\nwhich told jurors about the victim's final thoughts based on pure speculation. We found\nthe arguments improper because \"when the prosecutor began speculating as to the\nvictim's thoughts and essentially making up an [i]nternal dialogue for the victim, he\ncrossed the line into a blatant appeal to the emotions of the jury.\" 272 Kan. at 1114.\n\n\n       Here, Morrison's argument did not speculate as to the victims' thoughts and did not\noffer an imaginary dialogue from the deceased. Instead, he used the Tender Mercies film\nto illustrate why the aggravating factor of multiple murders should outweigh Robinson's\nclosing argument appeals for mercy and a life sentence. See State v. Hilt, 299 Kan. 176,\n199, 322 P.3d 367 (2014) (prosecutor's use of Goodfellas film as rhetorical device not\nmisconduct where reference to the iconic film in connection with the case \"brought order\nto the facts and placed them in the meaningful context of the prosecution's theory of the\ncase\"). We find the comments fell within the wide latitude afforded prosecutors in\ndiscussing the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                            361\n\f                b. \"I bet the [families of the victims] wouldn't agree\" Comment\n\n       The defense devoted a substantial portion of its penalty phase case putting on\nevidence suggesting Robinson posed a low risk of violence in prison. In the first portion\nof the prosecutor's closing argument, he challenged this evidence and commented:\n\n\n                \"I bet you Bev Bonner's family wouldn't agree with that. I bet you the Troutens\n       wouldn't agree with that. I bet you the Lewickas wouldn't agree with that or the Faiths, or\n       the Stasis, I bet they wouldn't agree with that.\"\n\n\nRobinson contends the remarks were beyond the latitude afforded prosecutors in arguing\nthe evidence.\n\n\n       It is a well-established rule in this State that error is committed when a prosecutor\ninjects his or her personal opinion into the closing argument. See State v. Longoria, 301\nKan. 489, 525, 343 P.2d 1128 (2015). On their face, the comments improperly expressed\nthe opinion of the prosecutor and were improper. We disagree with the State's attempt to\ncharacterize the comments as mere rhetorical expressions.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, the conduct was not prejudicial to Robinson. The prosecutor made\nthe comments on one occasion in response to the defense's mitigation theory; the defense\nlodged no objection; and the remarks did not run afoul of the district judge's prior rulings.\nWe find the remarks were not gross or flagrant or the product of ill will. Moreover, while\nbeyond the wide latitude afforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence, the comments\nwere made in response to expert testimony concerning defendant's propensity toward\nviolence in prison. Though not insulating the comments from a claim of prosecutorial\nmisconduct, these circumstances mitigate the prejudicial force of the comments. See\nState v. Williams, 299 Kan. 911, 938, 329 P.3d 400 (2014) (considering responsive nature\nof comments in prejudice analysis, but not applying immunity based on this fact); State v.\n                                                    362\n\fMarshall, 294 Kan. 850, 860-61, 281 P.3d 1112 (2012) (responsive, extemporaneous, or\nrebuttal nature of a prosecutor's improper comment or argument is a factor relevant to the\nprejudice analysis, albeit not determinative). Considering the totality of the facts, along\nwith the strength of the State's aggravating circumstance evidence and Robinson's less\nthan compelling mitigation evidence, the comments did not affect the jury's consideration\nof the penalty phase evidence.\n\n\n               c. Comments about the Severity of Robinson's Capital Murders\n\n       During penalty phase opening statements, the prosecutor explained that the\npurpose of the penalty phase under Kansas' capital sentencing scheme is to distinguish\nbetween capital murders that warrant a life sentence and those that warrant a sentence of\ndeath. The prosecutor repeated this explanation at the outset of closing argument.\n\n\n       During the rebuttal portion of penalty phase closing argument, the prosecutor\nchallenged Robinson's mitigation case and emphasized the significance of the multiple\nmurder aggravating circumstance. In making this argument, the prosecutor remarked:\n\n\n       \"Is this a severe capital murder? Is it one of greater enormity than the—is it one of greater\n       gravity than the average? Of course it is. Is somebody who kills in a course of conduct\n       that lasts almost two decades the worst kind of murderer imaginable? Does he deserve the\n       death penalty? We all know the answer to that question. We all know the answer to that\n       question.\"\n\n\n       In his final remarks to the jury, the prosecutor returned to the purpose of the\npenalty phase proceedings under Kansas' statutory scheme.\n\n\n               \"This process is all about finding just punishment, fairness, and I'm sure we\n       would all agree that capital punishment should be reserved for the most severe crimes. It\n\n                                                   363\n\f       should be reserved for the most severe crimes, only the most heinous of acts should be\n       punished with that sentence. Obviously with this, if not him, then who? I'll leave you\n       with that thought.\"\n\n\n       Robinson believes that these remarks, both those explaining the purpose of the\npenalty phase process and those commenting on the gravity of Robinson's crimes,\nimproperly called on the jury to compare Robinson's murders to other capital murders\nthat were not part of this record.\n\n\n       We disagree. Morrison's remarks explaining the purpose of the penalty phase\nreasonably conveyed to jurors that the process served as a mechanism to narrow the class\nof individuals eligible to receive a sentence of death by comparing aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances. See State v. Scott, 286 Kan. 54, 108, 183 P.3d 801 (2008) (\"In\norder for a capital sentencing scheme to pass constitutional muster, it must 'genuinely\nnarrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the\nimposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others found guilty of\nmurder.' One way in which sentencing schemes do so is in the use of aggravating\ncircumstances.\" [quoting Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 877, 103 S. Ct. 2733, 77 L. Ed.\n2d 235 (1983)]).\n\n\n       The prosecutor's other challenged remarks simply advanced the appropriate\nargument that the aggravating circumstance was so abhorrent that this case warranted\nimposition of a sentence of death, notwithstanding defendant's mitigation evidence.\nThrough the remarks, the prosecutor tied together the purpose of the penalty phase, i.e.,\nnarrowing the class of death-eligible capital murders, with the State's aggravating\ncircumstance evidence that Robinson had killed six people. The prosecutor did not inject\ninformation from other capital cases or otherwise discuss matters beyond the evidence.\nThe remarks properly suggested that Robinson's conduct and moral culpability was so\n\n                                                  364\n\fsevere that it warranted a sentence of death, an argument within the wide latitude\nafforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence. Cf. Scott, 286 Kan. at 81 (prosecutor\nmay refer to defendant as a murderer or killer when arguing that evidence shows\ndefendant committed murder).\n\n\n       Robinson believes the prosecutor's attempt to answer his own rhetorical\nquestion—\"Is this a severe capital murder?\"—injected his own personal opinion based on\nhis experience as a prosecutor. However, when viewed in context, the prosecutor was\nusing a rhetorical device to emphasize the weight of the multiple murders evidence and to\nillustrate that under the narrowing function of Kansas' capital sentencing scheme, a death\nsentence was warranted. See Hall v. Luebbers, 341 F.3d 706, 716-17 (8th Cir. 2003)\n(finding no misconduct from prosecutor's argument that not every capital murder meets\nthe legal requirements for the death penalty, but this one did based on evidence proving\nall requirements for imposing death penalty); Cunningham v. Hudson, No. 3:06CV0167,\n2010 WL 5092705, at *49 (N.D. Ohio 2010) (unpublished opinion) (in capital murder\nproceeding, \"the prosecutor's comment characterizing the murders as 'the most cold-\nblooded calculated inhumane murder' fell within the latitude permitted to both parties\"),\nvacated and remanded on other grounds 756 F.3d 477 (6th Cir. 2014). For the same\nreasons, the argument did not inject a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance.\n\n\n       Robinson also suggests that the prosecutor's final remark—\"[I]f not him, then\nwho?\" —appealed to the jurors' sense of duty to maintain the death penalty as a viable\nsentencing option under state law, contrary to our holding in Scott, 286 Kan. at 79\n(Prosecutorial comments that tell \"jurors to honor their oath and return a verdict of\nguilty\" impliedly suggest that to do otherwise would be a violation of such duty and are\nimproper.). However, the prosecutor did not suggest jurors would violate their oath by\nsentencing the defendant to life imprisonment. Instead, his comment was designed to\nemphasize the weight of the aggravating circumstance and demonstrate the propriety of a\n                                            365\n\fdeath sentence under the narrowing function of Kansas' capital sentencing scheme. See\nState v. Davis, 175 Wash. 2d 287, 339-40, 290 P.3d 43 (2012) (prosecutor's closing\nargument comment of \"'If not now, then when? And, if not [defendant], then who?'\" did\nnot constitute prosecutorial misconduct; comment was made in the context of arguing\nthat the death penalty was appropriate, given the circumstances of the crime, and was\nwithin latitude granted to prosecutors).\n\n\n       Accordingly, we hold that these comments fell within the wide latitude afforded\nprosecutors in arguing the evidence.\n\n\n       3. Did the prosecutor improperly attack Nancy Robinson?\n\n       During Robinson's penalty phase case, Nancy Robinson testified to the character\nof her husband as a good father, grandfather, and family man. She also informed jurors\nthat she and other family members would continue to maintain relationships with\nRobinson and be spared grief if he were sentenced to life imprisonment. The State\neffectively challenged the credibility and reliability of her opinions on cross-examination.\n\n\n       During the initial portion of the State's penalty phase closing argument, the\nprosecutor commented on Nancy Robinson and the credibility of the opinions she\nprovided to the jury.\n\n\n               \"Then we had Nancy Robinson, in some ways a tragic figure, and in some ways a\n       sad figure, in some ways a pathetic figure, who takes the term 'stand by your man' to a\n       whole new level. In many ways if you look at the evidence in this case, Nancy Robinson\n       is just another of the many victims of this man (indicating), just another victim.\n               \"She's up here crying (indicating), lives probably been ruined because of what he\n       has done, because of what he has done to her and that family. Has she been manipulated?\n       Has she been deceived? Look at the letter that I put in yesterday; read the note. That will\n\n                                                   366\n\f       answer that question for you. She had been manipulated to stand by after a continuum of\n       5, 10, 15, 25 year streams of girlfriends right under her nose, BDS&M relationships,\n       prison terms, probation revs, trials, the 'stand by him,' is she a victim? Yep. After\n       conviction of multiple murders that are of the most heinous yesterday, she tells us, well,\n       I'm not sure if I want a divorce or not.\n               ....\n               \"Decide for yourselves. When I asked her, you know, you testified for him before\n       in his earlier trials; haven't you? Yep. You were there at his hearings and his sentencing\n       probation revocations? Yep. Well, didn't you know that he was a suspect back in the mid\n       '80s in the disappearance of a woman and little girl? I must have been out in the hall and\n       her fall-back answer, 'Nobody asked me.' What do you think? What do you think? Can\n       you be a great dad when you're in prison? Can you be a great dad and grandpa when\n       you're doing the kind of things the defendant has done? You answer that question.\"\n\n\nDefense counsel objected midway through these comments after the prosecutor\nmentioned Nancy Robinson's uncertainty as to whether she would divorce Robinson. The\ndistrict judge overruled the objection, finding the comment within the scope of the\nevidence.\n\n\n       Robinson argues these remarks were improper because they communicated the\ntheme that Nancy Robinson's pleas to spare her husband's life should be disregarded\nbecause \"the prosecutor held her in suspicion.\"\n\n\n       Robinson seems to misconstrue the prosecutor's argument. He was not attempting\nto implicate Nancy Robinson in her husband's criminal activity. Instead, the comments\nchallenged the credibility and reliability of her opinion regarding Robinson's character as\na good family man. His comments were founded on her cross-examination testimony and\nreasonable inferences from it. The argument was well within the latitude afforded\nprosecutors in arguing the evidence. See State v. Todd, 299 Kan. 263, 285-86, 323 P.3d\n829 (prosecutor's comment that witness lacked credibility was reasonable inference that\n                                                    367\n\fthe prosecutor could argue based on evidence), cert. denied 135 S. Ct. 460 (2014);\nMarshall, 294 Kan. at 863 (comments regarding witness' honesty not improper when tied\nto evidence); Chanthaseng, 293 Kan. at 148 (prosecutor's statements about the witness'\ncredibility proper where based on reasonable inferences from evidence); State v. Duong,\n292 Kan. 824, 830-32, 257 P.3d 309 (2011) (prosecutor's statements about the victim's\ncredibility proper where based on evidence).\n\n\n       4. Did the prosecutor improperly attack defense counsel's argument?\n\n       Finally, Robinson takes issue with prosecutor Morrison's personalized attack of\narguments advanced by defense counsel. During defense counsel's closing argument, he\nsuggested that there was residual doubt as to whether Robinson acted alone. At the\nbeginning of the State's rebuttal closing, the prosecutor said, \"I find it absolutely insulting\nand astonishing that [defense counsel] wants to talk about whether,\" at which point\ndefense counsel lodged an objection and the district judge sustained it. The prosecutor\nmoved on, returning to a discussion of the aggravating circumstance evidence.\n\n\n       Comments that disparage the arguments of the defense or the role of defense\ncounsel in the adversarial process are improper. State v. Knox, 301 Kan. 671, 684, 347\nP.3d 656 (2015); see State v. Lockhart, 24 Kan. App. 2d 488, 492, 947 P.2d 461, rev.\ndenied 263 Kan. 889 (1997). The prosecutor's remark suggested he personally felt one of\nthe defense's arguments was \"insulting and astounding.\" The remark was an improper\ncomment on the evidence.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, it was not prejudicial. The prosecutor's remark was isolated, and it\nwas incomplete because the statement was interrupted by the defense's objection and\ndistrict judge's ruling. We find the comment was not gross or flagrant. Because of its\nisolated and incomplete character, along with the fact that the prosecutor continued on in\n\n                                             368\n\fcompliance with the district judge's ruling, the remark also fell short of establishing ill\nwill. Nor would the comment have weighed heavily in the minds of jurors. Had the\nprosecutor completed his statement, Robinson might have had a more viable argument.\nHowever, the interruption left jurors only with the knowledge that the prosecutor was\noffended by some argument the defense had made, a relatively benign statement.\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the comment was harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1084 (citing Chapman, 386 U.S. at\n24); see also State v. Douglas, 274 Kan. 96, 108, 49 P.3d 446 (2002) (comment that\ndefendant's \"'story is ridiculous and absurd and ludicrous'\" did not prejudice defendant\nwhere objection sustained and jury instructed to disregard); State v. Hernandez, No.\n94,873, 2007 WL 316787, at *13 (Kan. 2007) (unpublished opinion) (calling defense\ntheory \"'ludicrous'\" not gross or flagrant; no ill will was shown; no likelihood it changed\nthe result of the trial); State v. Norwood, No. 109,419, 2014 WL 6909514, at *11-12\n(Kan. App. 2014) (unpublished opinion) (calling defense position \"ridiculous\" not\nprejudicial, given remark was isolated and State's evidence compelling), rev. denied 302\nKan. ___ (July 22, 2015).\n\n\nAlleged Misconduct during State's Cross-Examination\n\n       Robinson asserts that the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial misconduct when\nmaking assertions of fact in questions posed during cross-examination of defendant's\nmitigation witnesses. Robinson identifies five specific instances of this alleged\nmisconduct, each addressed in turn.\n\n\n       We apply the same two-part standard when reviewing claims of prosecutorial\nmisconduct based on a prosecutor's questioning of witnesses on cross-examination. State\nv. Edgar, 281 Kan. 47, 66, 127 P.3d 1016 (2006); State v. Tosh, 278 Kan. 83, Syl. ¶ 1, 91\nP.3d 1204 (2004).\n\n                                             369\n\f       1. Did the prosecutor commit misconduct during the cross-examination of Nancy\n       Robinson?\n\n       During the defense's mitigation case, Nancy Robinson testified to defendant's\ncharacter as a good family man, father, and grandfather. During cross-examination, the\nprosecutor asked, \"[W]ould it affect your opinion of your husband if you knew that he\nhad taken [their granddaughter] to liaisons with one of his BDS&M girlfriends?\"\n\n\n       The defense objected, and the district judge held a bench conference. The\nprosecutor informed the district judge it had a witness who could substantiate the factual\nbasis of the question, i.e., that during the course of their BDS&M relationship, Robinson\nbrought his infant grandchild to their BDS&M liaisons on more than one occasion. Judge\nAnderson ruled that the defense had opened the door to the inquiry, which was properly\ncalculated to elicit relevant evidence to impeach Nancy Robinson's opinion of Robinson's\ncharacter as caring grandfather. Based on the prosecutor's proffer, the district judge\nallowed the inquiry, and Nancy Robinson testified that she did not know whether her\nopinion would be affected by this fact unless she knew the entirety of the circumstances.\n\n       A prosecutor's questions must be relevant and supported by a good-faith basis for\nbelieving the asserted matter to be true. State v. Overton, 279 Kan. 547, 558, 112 P.3d\n244 (2005). Robinson contends the prosecutor lacked a good-faith basis for the question,\nand, therefore, it was improper.\n\n\n       The record demonstrates otherwise. The prosecutor made a proffer of the\ntestimony that supported his good-faith basis for the question at the time of the objection.\nThe district judge not only found that the prosecutor had established a good-faith basis\nfor his questioning, but also ruled appropriately that the inquiry was calculated to elicit\n\n\n                                             370\n\frelevant evidence impeaching Nancy Robinson's testimony regarding Robinson's\ncharacter as a good grandfather.\n\n\n       Moreover, the following day, the prosecutor intended to introduce testimony from\nSandra Shields to establish that Robinson brought his infant grandchild with him on more\nthan one BDS&M liaison. The State intended to introduce this testimony to rebut the\ndefense's evidence that the Johnson County Detention Center allowed Robinson to have\ncontact visits with his grandchild, giving rise to the inference that they shared a special\nrelationship. The prosecutor provided a more detailed proffer of Shields' testimony, but\nthe district judge ruled that it was not proper rebuttal to the defense's evidence of\nRobinson's contact visits. While inadmissible for that purpose, the proffer confirms that\nthe prosecutor had a good-faith basis for his cross-examination of Nancy Robinson.\n\n\n       Robinson takes issue with the fact that the jury never heard the good-faith basis for\nthe questions posed to Nancy Robinson, citing State v. McCaslin, 291 Kan. 697, 720, 245\nP.3d 1030 (2011), overruled on other grounds by State v. Astorga, 299 Kan. 395, 324\nP.3d 1046 (2014). There we found the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by lodging\ninflammatory questions that lacked a good-faith factual basis and were never intended to\nelicit a substantive response. Although the prosecutor later provided a good-faith basis\nfor the questions during the hearing on defendant's motion for new trial, the jury never\nheard it, potentially leaving the jury to imagine \"'all kinds of damaging and prejudicial\nbut false or inadmissible facts'\" that the defense could not refute. 291 Kan. at 720. Like\nMcCaslin, in this case the jury was left to imagine certain details; but unlike McCaslin,\nthe basic asserted facts in the prosecutor's questions were supported by proffered\ntestimony and reasonably calculated to elicit relevant testimony from Nancy Robinson.\nMoreover, the defense had no intention of exposing the jury to the facts supporting the\nprosecutor's good-faith basis for his questioning. In fact, defense counsel fought\nvigorously to exclude Shields' testimony for good reason—these facts were detrimental to\n                                             371\n\fhis mitigation case. Even if there was error in the exclusion of Shields' testimony, it\nwould have been invited by the defense. We hold there was no misconduct.\n\n\n       2. Did the prosecutor commit misconduct during the cross-examination of Mark\n       Cunningham?\n\n       The defense called Cunningham to testify that Robinson would make a positive,\nnonviolent adjustment to prison. During direct examination, defense counsel asked\nCunningham whether Robinson would have access to the Internet. Cunningham\nresponded, \"No, sir,\" explaining that prisoner communications are very carefully\nmonitored in a maximum security setting and that it would be negligent to allow a\nprisoner who had used the Internet to facilitate his crimes to have access to the same tool\ninside prison. Cunningham also said that whatever computer access defendant would\nhave, would be restricted, especially the Internet.\n\n\n       During cross-examination, prosecutor Welch asked Cunningham about Internet\naccess within the Kansas Department of Corrections institutions.\n\n\n       \"Q.    Now, you talked a little bit with [defense counsel] about the defendant's access or\n              potential access to the computers should he be incarcerated. I kind of got the\n              impression that perhaps you hadn't spoken with Kansas DOC about specific\n              access to computers?\n\n       \"A.    No, ma'am, I have not.\n\n       \"Q.    We're not sure whether he would have access to computers or what type of access\n              he would have or not, correct?\n\n       \"A.    Not definitively to Kansas as a general—I mean, a lot of prisons across the\n              United States on a pretty routine basis there is not access to computers in prison\n              that there are in our homes, and particularly Internet access, but I have not\n\n                                                  372\n\f               questioned Kansas specifically about their computer policy with inmates.\"\n               (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       During closing argument, prosecutor Morrison challenged Robinson's mitigation\nevidence by highlighting his use of fraud and deception to facilitate crime both inside and\noutside the prison environment.\n\n\n               \"Gosh, if they [recommendation letters fraudulently created or altered by\n       Robinson] would have been real, the people would have said good things about it. What\n       does that tell us? Model inmate, somebody who should be allowed to peacefully live out\n       his life in prison, somebody who won't be a threat. You've never heard us say for a\n       second that we're concerned about the defendant attack[ing] somebody in prison [and]\n       starting a gang or riot. That's not his way. His way is manipulation, his way is deceit that\n       often ends in tragic consequences. You decide. I thought it interesting that Mr.\n       Cunningham didn't take two minutes to decide whether or not his bait of choice, the\n       computer, will even be available for him in prison. Would you agree that that's his lure of\n       choice?\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       Robinson argues that the prosecutor's use of the term \"we're,\" instead of \"you're,\"\nin questioning Cunningham improperly suggested that both the State and Cunningham\npersonally thought it possible that Robinson could have Internet access in prison. He also\nbelieves prosecutor Morrison's comments during closing argument were improper if, in\nfact, KDOC prohibited Internet access to prisoners. Robinson then cites to a KDOC\npolicy from 2002, attached to the briefing, which appears to prohibit Internet access for\ninmates.\n\n\n       The problem for Robinson is that the court is limited to record evidence in\nanalyzing the prosecutorial misconduct challenge, and the KDOC policy was never\nintroduced as evidence during the penalty phase. As to prosecutor Welch's questioning of\nCunningham, her use of the word \"we're\" rather than \"you're\" is of little significance.\n                                                   373\n\fRobinson offers no support for his claim that the prosecutor lacked a good-faith basis for\nher questioning, and even if he did, the expert's testimony on direct implied that he had\nnot researched KDOC policy specifically, providing the prosecutors with a good-faith\nbasis for the inquiry on cross-examination.\n\n\n         Based on the foregoing, the prosecutor's questions to Cunningham and the closing\nargument remarks were well within the appropriate bounds of cross-examination\nwitnesses and closing argument. Robinson has failed to demonstrate misconduct on this\nbasis.\n\n\n         3. Did the prosecutor improperly question Nancy Robinson about the infant?\n\n         During the cross-examination of Nancy Robinson, prosecutor Morrison asked\nwhether she reported to authorities that Robinson came home with an infant baby at the\ntime of Stasi's disappearance in January 1985. The district judge overruled the defense's\ngeneral objection, finding the question relevant.\n\n\n         Robinson argues that the prosecutor did not have an adequate basis for asking the\nquestion and that it improperly implied that Nancy Robinson was an accomplice to\ndefendant's crimes. However, the State's evidence had established that Robinson returned\nhome with an infant around the time of Lisa Stasi's disappearance. Her testimony also\nimplied that she did not report this incident to law enforcement. The record confirms the\nprosecutor's good-faith basis for the inquiry.\n\n\n         The prosecutor's question was also relevant. Contrary to Robinson's assertion, the\nprosecutor did not ask the question to implicate Nancy Robinson in any criminal activity.\nInstead, the question was designed to challenge the credibility of Nancy Robinson and\nher testimony that her husband was a good family man. As such, the prosecutor did not\nengage in any misconduct.\n                                              374\n\f       4. Were questions about Social Security benefit checks improper?\n\n       The record evidence established that Robinson murdered Sheila and Debbie Faith\nand, thereafter, deposited their Social Security benefit checks into various accounts under\nhis control. Two of these checks were cashed in Florida, around the time defendant and\nhis wife were there attending a wedding. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked\nNancy Robinson if she was there when defendant cashed those two checks. The defense\nlodged no objection.\n\n\n       Robinson now alleges that the prosecutor supplied no factual basis for the\nquestioning. The above summary of the record evidence suggests the contrary. Moreover,\nthe defense did not object to the question at trial, and the prosecution had no reason to\naffirmatively supply a factual basis for the inquiry. See Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1090 (\"The\nfailure of the defendant to object and to trigger the prosecutor's proffer of a good faith\nbasis precludes a finding of error on this issue.\").\n\n\n       5. Were questions related to Cunningham's written report improper?\n\n       During the State's cross-examination of Cunningham, prosecutor Welch explored\nthe expert's qualifications, methodology, and fee. Through this questioning, the State\nestablished that Cunningham earned $11,000 for his services. Prosecutor Welch then\nasked Cunningham whether he had prepared a written report, to which he answered, \"No,\nma'am.\" Prosecutor Welch then asked, \"Were you asked by defense counsel not to write a\nreport?,\" to which Cunningham again responded, \"No, ma'am.\"\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor lacked a good-faith basis to assert as fact that\ndefense counsel advised Cunningham not to produce a written report. However, the\nprosecutor's question did not assert this as fact. Instead, the prosecutor asked the question\n                                             375\n\fin a fact-neutral manner, \"Were you asked by defense counsel not to write a report?\" This\nallowed Cunningham to respond, \"No ma'am,\" dispelling any notion that defense counsel\nhad instructed the expert not to prepare a written report. The prosecutor's inquiry was\nproper.\n\n\n         Robinson cites State v. Atkins, 405 N.J. Super. 392, 964 A.2d 845 (2009), in\nsupport of his claim. There, the prosecutor asked a series of questions of the defense\ninvestigator as to why he did not prepare a written report. On appeal, the New Jersey\nSuperior Court found the trial court should have provided the jury with an instruction that\nno written report was required and that it should draw no adverse inference from its\nabsence. 405 N.J. Super. at 406. However, the Superior Court did not find that the\nprosecutor had engaged in misconduct by exploring this line of questioning, and it did not\nsuggest that the prosecutor lacked a good-faith basis for such questions. Instead, it found\nerror because the trial judge compelled the defense to produce its retained investigator's\nnotes from an interview with the victim, and these notes contained the victim's prior\nconsistent statements that defendant had molested her, violating the privilege for\nnontestifying experts. At trial, the prosecutor used this evidence against the defendant,\neffectively turning defense counsel's consulting expert into a witness for the prosecution.\nThe prosecutor's questions regarding the existence of a written report compounded the\ntrial court's error in compelling production of the written notes in the first instance. Atkins\nis factually distinguishable and lacks persuasive value when compared to Robinson's\nfacts.\n\n\n         In the end, Robinson has failed to establish misconduct as it relates to any of the\nfive challenges alleging that prosecutors lacked a good-faith basis for facts asserted\nwithin their cross-examination questioning of Robinson's mitigation witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n                                              376\n\fAlleged Misstatements of the Law during Voir Dire\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by misstating\nthe law relating to mitigating circumstances during voir dire. Specifically, he contends\nthat the prosecutor: (1) mischaracterized mitigating circumstances as those pertaining to\nthe crime itself; and (2) improperly suggested jurors could assign mitigation evidence no\nweight whatsoever.\n\n\n       We apply the same two-part standard of review for alleged prosecutorial\nmisconduct during voir dire. State v. Simmons, 292 Kan. 406, 412, 254 P.3d 97 (2011)\n(noting that two-part framework has been applied to the voir dire process).\n\n\n       1. Did prosecutors define mitigating circumstances improperly?\n\n       Robinson first contends the prosecutor misstated the law in summarizing the\nconcept of mitigating circumstances during voir dire.\n\n\n       A prosecutor's misstatement of the law is improper and satisfies the first prong of\nthe two-part prosecutorial misconduct standard. See State v. Cosby, 285 Kan. 230, 247-\n48, 169 P.3d 1128 (2007) (prosecutor's comment was a misstatement of law on\npremeditation and thus was improper). We have defined mitigating circumstances as\nthose \"which in fairness may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of\nmoral culpability, or blame, or which justify a sentence of less than death, even though\nthey do not justify or excuse the offense. \" Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, Syl. ¶ 79.\n\n\n       Robinson identifies three occasions where prosecutor Morrison allegedly\nmisstated the definition of mitigating circumstances during small group voir dire. First,\nduring voir dire of the fourth panel, which included petit Juror 39, the prosecutor\nexplained, \"Mitigating circumstances would be those circumstances that would make it\n                                            377\n\fnot as bad, if you will, not as morally wrong, if you will, as your typical capital murder.\"\nRobinson contends this definition improperly limited mitigating circumstances to the\nfacts of the crime.\n\n\n       Robinson's argument lacks merit. The prosecutor's description of mitigating\ncircumstances as those that diminish the moral culpability of the offense is entirely\nconsistent with the definition set forth in Kleypas. Contrary to Robinson's assertion, the\nprosecutor's definition did not exclude circumstances outside the facts of the crime itself.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor reinforced this allegedly narrow construction by\nfollowing up his definition with hypothetical questions that focused on the facts of the\ncrime rather than the background and character of the defendant. The argument is\nmisplaced. When Juror 41 suggested she would automatically vote for the death penalty\nregardless of the circumstances, prosecutor Morrison provided a hypothetical comparing\ntwo contract killings: one where a drug dealer contracted the murder of a police officer\nand the other where a sexually abused woman contracted the murder of her abuser. The\nprosecutor asked Juror 41 if she would view those hypothetical cases the same in terms of\npunishment or, instead, would consider the circumstances unique to each. The prosecutor\nwas not attempting to provide a legal definition of mitigating circumstances but, instead,\nwas properly exploring whether the veniremember was mitigation-impaired. In fact, the\nsecond hypothetical actually highlighted the defendant's social history and background as\na victim of sexual abuse and was not limited to the facts of the crime itself. The\nprosecutor did not exceed the bounds afforded to him in questioning veniremembers.\n\n\n       Second, Robinson objects to the prosecutor's discussion of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances during voir dire of the thirteenth small group panel, which\nincluded petit Jurors 87 and 92. Prosecutor Morrison asked Juror 82 whether he would\nconsider aggravating and mitigating circumstances and if he agreed that every case is\n                                            378\n\fdifferent. After responding in the affirmative to both questions, prosecutor Morrison\nasked, \"And if I gave you a scenario of a hundred homicides, we'd be able to find\ndifferences in the facts and circumstances of all of them, correct?\" Defense counsel\nobjected, claiming that the question unduly narrowed mitigating circumstances to the\nfacts surrounding the crime itself, but the district judge overruled, explaining that the\nobjection presumed the question dealt only with the elements of the crime and not other\nmitigating and aggravating factors. We find no basis in the record to disagree with Judge\nAnderson's interpretation of the prosecutor's question and find no misconduct on this\nbasis.\n\n\n         Finally, Robinson contends that petit Juror 246 was exposed to similar\nmisstatements of the law. During voir dire of the twenty-second small group panel,\nprosecutor Morrison made the following comments while describing the capital\nsentencing scheme:\n\n\n                 \"The second phase is after a defendant has been convicted of capital murder. And\n         in that phase, evidence is heard called evidence of aggravating circumstances and\n         evidence of mitigating circumstances. Aggravating circumstances will be those things\n         that tend to favor a death sentence. Mitigating circumstances will be those things that will\n         tend to favor a life sentence. Everybody kind of understand? Worse stuff generally is\n         aggravated. Things that tend to lessen guilt or excuse behaviors tend to be mitigation.\n         Understand? Everybody with me?\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n         The prosecutor's description of mitigating circumstances was consistent with\nKansas law. Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1103 (defining mitigating circumstances as those\nwhich justify a sentence of less than death or reduce moral culpability or blame). While it\nis improper for a prosecutor to argue that circumstances are not mitigating because they\ndo not excuse the crime, State v. Scott, 286 Kan. 54, 118, 183 P.3d 801 (2008), the\nprosecutor did not make such an argument to the small group panel.\n\n                                                     379\n\f       We see no error in the prosecutor's remarks to the small group panels regarding the\nconcept of mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n       2. Did the prosecutor comment improperly on weight assigned to mitigating\n       circumstances?\n\n       Robinson also challenges comments prosecutor Morrison made during voir dire of\nthe fourth small group panel, which he sees as suggesting that a juror could assign little\nor no weight to mitigating circumstances evidence.\n\n\n       Specifically, during voir dire of this panel, the prosecutor explained, \"[T]he rules\nare going to say 'you shall consider' [mitigating circumstances]. Doesn't necessarily mean\nyou have to give a lot of weight to it or even any weight, but you shall consider.\"\nMoments later, prosecutor Morrison commented:\n\n\n       \"Does everybody here understand it is for you to determine what, if any, weight you give\n       to an aggravating circumstance or a mitigating circumstance? It is for you to determine\n       what, if any, weight you give. But you must be willing to consider those things. That's the\n       question.\"\n\n\n       Contrary to Robinson, we find these comments were consistent with established\nlaw. In Johnson v. Texas, 509 U.S. 350, 361, 113 S. Ct. 2658, 125 L. Ed. 2d 290 (1993),\nthe Supreme Court made clear:\n\n\n       \"'Lockett and its progeny stand only for the proposition that a State may not cut off in an\n       absolute manner the presentation of mitigating evidence, either by statute or judicial\n       instruction, or by limiting the inquiries to which it is relevant so severely that the\n       evidence could never be a part of the sentencing decision at all.'

While\nLockett proscribes State conduct that bars defendant's presentation of mitigation\nevidence, \"[i]t does not prohibit a capital sentencing jury from assessing the weight of\nmitigating evidence 'and find[ing] it wanting as a matter of fact[.]'\" State v.

CHALLENGES TO PENALTY PHASE INSTRUCTIONS\n\n       Robinson advances four challenges to the penalty phase instructions given to the\njury. We address each challenge in turn.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       In reviewing challenges to jury instructions in the penalty phase of a capital trial,\nwe have employed the following standard of review:\n\n\n               \"In considering a [preserved] claim that a jury instruction in the penalty phase of\n       a capital trial prevented the jury from giving proper consideration to mitigating evidence,\n       our standard of review is 'whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has\n       applied the challenged instruction in a way that prevents the consideration of\n       constitutionally relevant evidence.' Boyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S. Ct.\n       1190, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1990). However, we consider the instructions as a whole and do\n       not isolate any one instruction. Even if erroneous in some way, instructions do not result\n       in reversible error if they properly and fairly state the law as applied to the facts of the\n       case and could not reasonably have misled the jury. State v. Edgar, 281 Kan. 47, 54, 127\n       P.3d 1016 (2006).\" Scott, 286 Kan. at 104-05.\n\n\nDefining Standard of Proof for Aggravating Circumstances\n\n       Robinson first argues the penalty phase instructions created an unreasonable risk\nthat the jury would fail to recognize it must find that aggravating factors outweighed\nmitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt in order to impose a death sentence.\n\n\n\n                                                    382\n\f       The Kansas death sentencing scheme requires that the jury make two findings\nbeyond a reasonable doubt in arriving at a sentence of death.\n\n\n       \"In Kansas, the death penalty may be imposed only if the jury unanimously finds beyond\n       a reasonable doubt that (1) the aggravating circumstances alleged by the State exist and\n       (2) the existence of such aggravating circumstances is not outweighed by any mitigating\n       circumstances found to exist. K.S.A. 21-4624(e).\" State v. Gleason, 299 Kan. 1127, 1186,\n       329 P.3d 1102 (2014), cert. granted 135 S. Ct. 1698 (2015).\n\n\n       One historical interpretive note is warranted. Robinson's trial was conducted after\nKleypas, 272 Kan. 894, where in order to survive constitutional scrutiny, we construed\nthe statutory weighing equation to require a showing that aggravating circumstances\noutweighed mitigating circumstances before a sentence of death could be imposed. 272\nKan. 894, Syl. ¶ 48. Consequently, in its instructions, the trial court used the then-\napplicable language from Kleypas, requiring jurors to find that aggravating circumstances\noutweighed mitigating circumstances before imposing a sentence of death. After\nRobinson's trial, in Marsh, 548 U.S. at 170-73, the United States Supreme Court found\nthe statutory weighing equation had been constitutional as enacted, i.e., a sentence of\ndeath could be imposed so long as aggravators were not outweighed by mitigators.\n\n\n       Robinson's argument arises under Instruction No. 10, which provides: \"The State\nhas the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there are one or more aggravating\ncircumstances and that they outweigh any mitigating circumstances believed to exist.\"\nThe instruction was based on the recommended instruction in PIK Crim. 3d 56.00-E and\nmirrored the language of the applicable statute, K.S.A. 21-4624(e) (Furse 1995), with one\nminor alteration.\n\n\n       Robinson believes this language is ambiguous because \"beyond a reasonable\ndoubt\" only clearly modifies the State's burden to prove that there are one or more\n                                                  383\n\faggravating circumstances, giving rise to the possibility that the instruction creates two\nburdens of proof: beyond a reasonable doubt for proof of the existence of aggravating\ncircumstances; and preponderance of the evidence for whether aggravators outweigh\nmitigators. Robinson argues his position is corroborated by prosecutor Welch's argument\nduring the jury instructions conference that the State did not have a double reasonable\ndoubt burden and that she did not read the instructions to create one.\n\n\n       Robinson offers little aside from speculation to suggest jurors would adopt his\ninterpretation of the instructions rather than the one chosen by the district judge, the PIK\nCommittee, and the legislature. See State v. Scott, 271 Kan. 103, 117, 21 P.3d 516\n(highly encouraging courts to follow the language found in the PIK instructions unless\nfacts of case dictate otherwise), cert. denied 534 U.S. 1047 (2001). The ultimate question\nis \"whether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged\ninstruction in a way that prevents the consideration of constitutionally relevant evidence.\"\nBoyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 380, 110 S. Ct. 1190, 108 L. Ed. 2d 316 (1990).\n\n\n       Robinson's argument does not rise above the level of speculation. The assistant\ndistrict attorney's argument notwithstanding, a commonsense interpretation of the\nlanguage in Instruction No. 10 is that the State's burden of proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt applies to both object clauses of the sentence—that aggravators exist and that\naggravators outweigh mitigating circumstances. That interpretation is clearly confirmed\nby language in Instruction No. 12, which provides: \"[I]f one or more jurors is not\npersuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating\ncircumstances, then you should sign the appropriate alternative verdict form,\" and\nInstruction No. 8, which states that \"[m]itigating circumstances are to be determined by\neach individual juror when deciding whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the death penalty should be imposed.\"\n\n\n                                            384\n\f       Reading the instructions together, we find no reasonable likelihood that jurors\napplied the instructions in a way that prevented consideration of constitutionally relevant\nevidence.\n\n\nAlleged Failure to Convey that Each Juror Could Find Mitigating Circumstances\n\n       In Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1078, this court advised that, going forward,\n\n\n       \"[a]ny instruction dealing with the consideration of mitigating circumstances should state\n       (1) they need to be proved only to the satisfaction of the individual juror in the juror's\n       sentencing decision and not beyond a reasonable doubt and (2) mitigating circumstances\n       do not need to be found by all members of the jury in order to be considered in an\n       individual juror's sentencing decision.\"\n\n\n       We have repeated the advisement in almost every death penalty decision since.\nSee Scott, 286 Kan. at 106-07; Cheever, 295 Kan. at 266; Gleason, 299 Kan. at 1193-97;\nState v. Carr, 300 Kan. 1, 303, 331 P.3d 544 (2014), cert. granted in part 135 S. Ct. 1698\n(2015).\n\n\n       The trial judge had the benefit of the Kleypas opinion at trial and included the\nfollowing paragraph in the mitigating circumstances instruction, Instruction No. 8:\n\n\n               \"The determination of what are mitigating circumstances is for you as jurors to\n       decide under the facts and circumstances of the case. Mitigating circumstances are to be\n       determined by each individual juror when deciding whether the State has proved beyond\n       a reasonable doubt that the death penalty should be imposed. The same mitigating\n       circumstances do not need to be found by all members of the jury in order to be\n       considered by an individual juror in arriving at his or her sentencing decision. You may\n       consider any mitigating circumstance which you believe to exist, regardless of whether it\n       has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n\n                                                    385\n\f       Robinson argues that Instructions Nos. 10, 12, 13 and the verdict forms conflicted\nwith Instruction No. 8 because language used in those instructions referring to\n\"mitigating circumstances believed to exist\" implied that mitigating circumstances must\nbe unanimously found by the jury. Robinson compares this case to the instructions in\nScott. But in Scott, the trial court did not include any instruction informing the jurors that\nit was unnecessary they agree on mitigating factors. Robinson also relies on Abu-Jamal v.\nHorn, 520 F.3d 272, 302 (3d Cir. 2008), cert. granted, judgment vacated, and case\nremanded sub nom. Beard v. Abu-Jamal, 558 U.S. 1143 (2010). But there the jury was\nnot given any instruction on how to determine mitigating circumstances. Moreover, after\nRobinson's brief was filed, the Abu-Jamal case was vacated and remanded in light of the\nSupreme Court's opinion in Smith v. Spisak, 558 U.S. 139, 148-49, 130 S. Ct. 676, 175 L.\nEd. 2d 595 (2010).\n\n\n       We disagree with Robinson. Instruction No. 8 clearly informs the jurors that\nmitigating circumstances \"are to be determined by each individual juror\" and \"do not\nneed to be found by all members of the jury in order to be considered by an individual\njuror.\" Viewing the instructions collectively, there is no reasonable likelihood that the\njury applied them in a way that prevented the consideration of constitutionally relevant\nevidence.\n\n\nInstructions' Alleged Encouragement of a Death Verdict\n\n       In his third challenge to the penalty phase instructions, Robinson argues the\nlanguage used to convey the contours of the sentencing decision confronting the jury\ncreated a presumption of death and improperly influenced the jury to arrive at such a\ndetermination. Robinson focuses on language in Instructions Nos. 12 and 13 and in the\nfour verdict forms that describes a jury decision not to impose the death penalty as an\n\n                                             386\n\finability to reach a decision. Robinson characterizes this language as speaking \"of a death\nsentence as if it were something that the jury should strive to achieve, and a life sentence\nas a failure or inability to reach that objective.\"\n\n       Robinson recognizes the primary shortcoming of his argument, that the\ninstructions given by the trial judge were based on the language of the statute providing\nfor the penalty phase hearing, which provides:\n\n\n                \"If, by unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or\n       more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in K.S.A. 21-4625 and amendments\n       thereto exist and, further, that the existence of such aggravating circumstances is not\n       outweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are found to exist, the defendant shall\n       be sentenced to death; otherwise, the defendant shall be sentenced as provided by law.\n       The jury, if its verdict is a unanimous recommendation of a sentence of death, shall\n       designate in writing, signed by the foreman of the jury, the statutory aggravating\n       circumstances which it found beyond a reasonable doubt. If, after a reasonable time for\n       deliberation, the jury is unable to reach a verdict, the judge shall dismiss the jury and\n       impose a sentence of imprisonment as provided by law and shall commit the defendant to\n       the custody of the secretary of corrections.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A. 21-4624(e) (Furse\n       1995).\n\n\n       In Kansas v. Marsh, 548 U.S. 163, 178-79, 126 S. Ct. 2516, 165 L. Ed. 2d 429\n(2006), the United States Supreme Court reviewed K.S.A. 21-4624(e) and held this\nlanguage to be constitutional. Moreover, the Court reviewed instructions based on K.S.A.\n21-4624(e) and said:\n\n       \"Kansas jurors, presumed to follow their instructions, are made aware that: a\n       determination that mitigators outweigh aggravators is a decision that a life sentence is\n       appropriate; a determination that aggravators outweigh mitigators or a determination that\n       mitigators do not outweigh aggravators—including a finding that aggravators and\n       mitigators are in balance—is a decision that death is the appropriate sentence; and an\n\n                                                   387\n\f       inability to reach a unanimous decision will result in a sentence of life imprisonment.\"\n       548 U.S. at 179-80.\n\n\n       Contrary to Robinson's argument that jurors are not given a way to express a\ndecision for a life sentence, Marsh suggests they are told exactly how to do that. Cf.\nBobby v. Mitts, 563 U.S. 395, __, 131 S. Ct. 1762, 1763-65, 179 L. Ed. 2d 819 (2011)\n(instructions did not impermissibly encourage death sentence by requiring jury to reject\ndeath penalty before considering life sentence); State v. Wakefield, 190 N.J. 397, 475-78,\n921 A.2d 954 (2007) (defendant was not entitled to a sua sponte instruction on the\npresumption of life during penalty phase of capital murder trial; although the trial court\ndid not, in so many words, instruct the jury that it must presume a sentence of life\nimprisonment, it did instruct the jury that a death sentence could be reached only if (1)\nthe jury found the existence of an aggravating factor beyond a reasonable doubt and (2)\nthe aggravating factor outweighed any mitigating factors).\n\n\n       Robinson has not established that there is a reasonable likelihood the jury has\napplied the challenged instruction in a way that prevented the consideration of\nconstitutionally relevant evidence.\n\nChallenge to Instruction No. 12\n\n       In supplemental briefing, Robinson challenged Instruction No. 12, which\nprovided:\n\n\n               \"As to each count, if you find unanimously beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n       aggravating circumstance claimed by the State exists and that it outweighs mitigating\n       circumstances believed to exist, then you shall impose a sentence of death and sign the\n       appropriate verdict form.\n               \"However, if one or more jurors is not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that\n       aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances, then you should sign the\n                                                  388\n\f       appropriate alternative verdict form indicating the jury is unable to reach a unanimous\n       verdict sentencing the defendant to death. In that event, the defendant will not be\n       sentenced to death but will be sentenced by the court as described in Instruction 9.\"\n       (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       Robinson argues that the \"shall\" in the first paragraph of Instruction No. 12\nimproperly forbade the jury from exercising its historic nullification power. See State v.\nSmith-Parker, 301 Kan. 132, 164, 340 P.3d 485 (2014) (jury instruction which provided\nthat jury \"will\" enter verdict of guilty in absence of reasonable doubt clearly erroneous\nbecause \"[i]t essentially forbade the jury from exercising its power of nullification\").\nHowever, the use of the term \"shall\" in Instruction No. 12 tracks the statutory language.\nK.S.A. 21-4624(e) (providing defendant \"shall\" be sentenced to death if aggravating\ncircumstances not outweighed by mitigating circumstances). Instruction No. 12 also\nprovides guidance for the jury to provide an alternative verdict for a life sentence. As\nsuch, we find the instruction is unlike the situation in Smith-Parker and does not \"fly too\nclose to the sun of directing a verdict for the State.\" 301 Kan. at 164. Indeed, the\npossibility of jury nullification logically requires, as a necessary precondition, the\nexistence of a mandatory charge from the court, such as \"shall impose.\"\n\n\n       In addition, Robinson argues the \"should\" in the second paragraph of the\ninstruction misstated Kansas law and improperly slanted the instruction toward the death\npenalty. Ideally, the instruction should have employed the term \"shall\" in discussing the\nboth the life verdict and the death verdict, consistent with K.S.A. 21-4624(e). However,\nwhen the instructions are read together as a whole, they made clear to jurors that there\nwere two sentencing options available and that jurors' ultimate sentencing decision was\ndependent on the jurors' application of the evidence to the statutory weighing equation.\nAs such, Instruction No. 12 was unlikely to create juror confusion and did not create a\nreasonable likelihood that jurors would have applied it in a way that prevented\n\n                                                   389\n\fconsideration of constitutionally relevant evidence. Despite the absence of error under\nthese facts, we caution that similar instructions should conform with the statutory\nlanguage, for under a different set of facts, the instruction may be deemed erroneous\nunder the applicable standard of review.\n\n\n                     17. SENTENCING UNDER ALLEGEDLY VOID LAW\n\n       Robinson makes a novel, albeit unpersuasive, argument that this court's decision in\nState v. Marsh, 278 Kan. 520, 102 P.3d 445 (2004), rev'd and remanded by 548 U.S. 163,\nand vacated in part by 282 Kan. 38, 144 P.3d 48 (2006), requires that his death sentence,\nimposed under the invalidated Kleypas interpretation of the weighing equation, be\nvacated and replaced by a life sentence with a mandatory minimum.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       Robinson's argument is founded in part on statutory construction and application\nof caselaw under Kansas' capital sentencing scheme. \"To the extent resolution of this\nissue requires interpretation of the capital sentencing statutes or application of caselaw,\nour review is unlimited.\" State v. Burnett, 293 Kan. 840, 847, 270 P.3d 1115 (2012).\n\n\nSentencing Under an Allegedly Void Capital Murder Scheme\n\n       As mentioned above, in State v. Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1016-18, we found\nunconstitutional as applied the provision contained in K.S.A. 21-4624(e) that directed a\npenalty phase jury to impose the death sentence if aggravating circumstances found to\nexist were not outweighed by mitigating circumstances found to exist. Rather than\ninvalidating the statute, however, the court construed it to require the jury to be directed\nto impose the death penalty only if aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating\ncircumstances. 272 Kan. at 1018.\n                                             390\n\f       In State v. Marsh, 278 Kan. 520, decided by this court on December 17, 2004, this\ncourt reversed tack on Kleypas and declared the original weighing equation provision of\nK.S.A. 21-4624(e) unconstitutional on its face. 278 Kan. at 534-44. The United States\nSupreme Court later reversed Marsh and held the Kansas death penalty scheme,\nincluding the weighing equation as originally written, constitutional. Kansas v. Marsh,\n548 U.S. at 173, 181.\n\n\n       Robinson was tried in 2002, subsequent to Kleypas but before our opinion in\nMarsh and the Supreme Court's later reversal of that opinion. Broken down to its\nsyllogistic form, Robinson argues: (1) Kleypas was wrongly decided because the court\nusurped legislative authority and rewrote K.S.A. 21-4624(e); (2) had Kleypas been\ncorrectly decided, the court would have simply declared the statute unconstitutional as it\ndid in Marsh; (3) had the Kleypas court declared K.S.A. 21-4624(e) unconstitutional,\nthere would have been no death penalty in Kansas; (4) in the absence of a death penalty,\nRobinson would have been sentenced to life in prison with a hard 50-year or hard 25-year\nminimum sentence without parole; and, therefore, (5) we should vacate his death\nsentence and remand for imposition of a life sentence.\n\n\n       It is apparent most, if not all, of Robinson's premises are incorrect. According to\nRobinson, Marsh leads to the conclusion that Kleypas should have declared K.S.A. 21-\n4624(e) unconstitutional. The decision in Kleypas did declare the weighing equation of\nK.S.A. 21-4624(e) unconstitutional. Marsh, 278 Kan. at 534; Kleypas, 272 Kan. 894, Syl.\n¶ 45. The remedy we chose was to construe it constitutionally. Marsh, 278 Kan. at 544;\nKleypas, 272 Kan. 894, Syl. ¶¶ 46-48. The historical fact Robinson chooses to ignore is\nthat the United States Supreme Court held the weighing equation as originally drafted by\nthe legislature was constitutional. Marsh, 548 U.S. at 173, 181. Therefore, if Kleypas was\nwrongly decided, and the Supreme Court of the United States says it was, then the correct\n                                            391\n\fdecision in Kleypas would have been to uphold the statute as written. Contrary to\nRobinson's premise that there would have been no death penalty at the time of his trial,\nhis jury would actually have been instructed to impose death if his mitigators did not\noutweigh aggravators, and the State would have had an easier bar to clear.\n\n\n       Accordingly, we find no basis to vacate Robinson's sentence on this asserted error.\n\n\n                          18. CUMULATIVE ERROR—PENALTY PHASE\n\n       Robinson argues the cumulative effect of penalty phase errors requires the\nvacation of his death sentences.\n\n\nLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       \"Cumulative error, considered collectively, may be so great as to require reversal of a\n       defendant's conviction. The test is whether the totality of the circumstances substantially\n       prejudiced the defendant and denied him or her a fair trial. No prejudicial error may be\n       found under the cumulative error doctrine if the evidence against the defendant is\n       overwhelming. State v. Cosby, 285 Kan. 230, Syl. ¶ 9, 169 P.3d 1128 (2007). Moreover,\n       this doctrine does not apply if no error or only one error supports reversal. See State v.\n       Carter, 284 Kan. 312, 332, 160 P.3d 457 (2007).\" State v. Dixon, 289 Kan. 46, 71, 209\n       P.3d 675 (2009).\n\n\n       \"This court utilizes a de novo standard when determining whether the totality of\ncircumstances substantially prejudiced a defendant and denied the defendant a fair trial\nbased on cumulative error.\" State v. Brown, 298 Kan. 1040, 1056, 318 P.3d 1005 (2014).\n\n\n\n\n                                                   392\n\fDid the Cumulative Effect of Errors Prejudice Robinson's Fair Trial Rights?\n\n       In analyzing the penalty phase proceedings, we presumed without holding that\nJuror 147's use of the Bible constituted juror misconduct. Nevertheless, the circumstances\nsurrounding his use of and comments regarding the Bible, including the fact that they\nwere isolated, brief, and made after the jurors' vote had revealed they were in unanimous\nagreement as to sentence, combined with the district judge's curative instruction,\nmitigated any prejudice. Likewise, the prosecutor made improper remarks during closing,\nbut those comments were not gross and flagrant and would have had little weight in the\nminds of jurors when considered individually and collectively. In light of the length and\ncomplexity of these proceedings, and the abundant evidence against Robinson on the\naggravating circumstance when compared with the relatively weak evidence in his favor\non mitigation, we hold that the totality of the circumstances did not substantially\nprejudice Robinson or deny him the right to a fair penalty phase proceeding.\n\n\n                   19. DESIGNATION OF ROBINSON AS A SEX OFFENDER\n\n       The district judge sentenced Robinson on January 21, 2003. During the sentencing\nhearing, the State did not argue and the district judge did not find that any of the crimes\nof conviction were sexually motivated. Nevertheless, in the journal entry of judgment, the\ndistrict judge sua sponte designated Robinson's convictions on Counts I, II, and III as\nsexually motivated. Robinson argues that the sexually motivated designation constitutes\nan unlawful variance from the sentence announced from the bench.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       \"Whether a sentence is illegal is a question of law over which this court has\nunlimited review.\" State v. Howard, 287 Kan. 686, 691, 198 P.3d 146 (2008). Likewise,\nto the extent Robinson's challenge requires the court to interpret the statutory\n                                             393\n\frequirements of the Kansas Offender Registration Act, the issue presents a question of\nlaw subject to de novo review. State v. Wilson, 295 Kan. 605, 627, 289 P.3d 1082 (2012).\n\n\nImproper Designation of Convictions as Sexually Motivated\n\n       We have confirmed repeatedly that \"the actual sentencing occurs when the court\npronounces the sentence from the bench. [Citations omitted.]\" State v. Garcia, 288 Kan.\n761, 765, 207 P.3d 251 (2009); see State v. Royse, 252 Kan. 394, 397, 845 P.2d 44\n(1993); State v. Moses, 227 Kan. 400, Syl. ¶¶ 1, 2, 3, 607 P.2d 477 (1980). \"[A] journal\nentry is merely a record of the sentence imposed and the sentencing court has no\njurisdiction to change the sentence after pronouncement.\" Garcia, 288 Kan. at 766.\n\n\n       Before a conviction may be deemed sexually motivated, the district judge must\nmake such a finding based on the evidence. See State v. Patterson, 25 Kan. App. 2d 245,\n251, 963 P.2d 436 (specific findings from evidence properly supported finding that\nburglary sexually motivated), rev. denied 265 Kan. 888 (1998). Here, the district judge's\nactual sentence from the bench failed to make any findings that Robinson's convictions\nwere sexually motivated. The sentencing judge thus lacked jurisdiction to make such a\ndesignation sua sponte in the journal entry. See Abasolo v. State, 284 Kan. 299, 304, 160\nP.3d 471 (2007) (\"where the sentence announced from the bench differs from the\nsentence later described in the journal entry, the orally pronounced sentence controls\");\nRoyse, 252 Kan. at 398 (\"Once a sentence is imposed, the district court is powerless to\nvacate that sentence and impose a harsher sentence.\"); see also In re L.L.B., No. 106,469,\n2012 WL 1658933, at *1-2 (Kan. App. 2012) (unpublished opinion) (reversing and\nremanding for evidentiary hearing where trial court failed to make findings of fact on the\nrecord or in the journal entry to support conclusion that crime was sexually motivated),\nrev. denied 295 Kan. 1173 (2013).\n\n\n\n                                            394\n\f         This was not a situation where the context of the sentencing hearing made clear\nthat the district judge intended to find the convictions were sexually motivated but failed\nto designate them as such when pronouncing sentence because of a mere oversight or\ntechnical error. See Garcia, 288 Kan. at 765-67 (though district court had not made\npronouncement from the bench that the murder was sexually motivated, its journal entry\nfiled the same day had confirmed its intention to do so); Howard, 287 Kan. at 694-95\n(finding that trial judge could clarify sentence in follow up hearing when original\nsentence was \"indistinct\"). The State offered no evidence at the sentencing hearing to\nsuggest any of the convictions were sexually motivated, and the question was never at\nissue.\n\n\n         The State concedes the error. Accordingly, we vacate that portion of Robinson's\nsentence and remand for the trial court to file a corrected journal entry.\n\n\n                               20. THE STATE'S CROSS-APPEAL\n\n         In its cross-appeal, the State argued that Judge Anderson's rulings limiting the\nprosecution's ability to argue victim impact evidence during penalty phase closing\narguments were erroneous.\n\n\n         We settled this issue in State v. Scott, 286 Kan. 54, 118-19, 183 P.3d 801 (2008),\nholding that a prosecutor's remarks about the victim and the impact of the murder on the\nvictim's family were relevant to the question of sentence and, therefore, proper. The State\nacknowledged the effect of this holding in its reply brief and admitted that \"consideration\nof the issue appears no longer necessary.\"\n\n\n         In light of the foregoing, we deem the issue to be abandoned or otherwise no\nlonger of statewide importance, and it is hereby dismissed.\n\n                                              395\n\f                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       The outcome of this appeal is a testament to Judge Anderson's diligence and\ncommitment to Robinson's fair trial rights. The caution he exercised and the preventative\nmeasures he employed were well planned and reasonably calculated to mitigate the risk\nof extraneous factors influencing the outcome of the guilt phase and penalty phase\nproceedings. These efforts have facilitated our determination that the sentence of death\nwas not \"imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\";\nthat the State's lone aggravating circumstance existed; and that Robinson's mitigating\ncircumstances were insufficient to outweigh it. See K.S.A. 21-4627(c)(2).\n\n\n       In sum, we affirm Robinson's capital murder conviction charged in Count II. We\nreverse his capital murder conviction charged in Count III and his first-degree murder\nconviction charged in Count V as unconstitutionally multiplicitous with the capital\nmurder conviction in Count II. All remaining convictions are affirmed. We affirm\nRobinson's death sentence under his capital murder conviction in Count II. We vacate\nonly that portion of Robinson's sentence designating certain of his crimes sexually\nmotivated and remand so that the trial court can correct the journal entry.\n\n\n       Affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded with directions.\n\n\n       LUCKERT, J., not participating.\n       MICHAEL J. MALONE, Senior Judge, assigned.1\n\n\n\n\n1\n REPORTER'S NOTE: Senior Judge Malone was appointed to hear case No. 90,196\nvice Justice Luckert under the authority vested in the Supreme Court by K.S.A. 20-2616.\n\n                                            396\n\f                                                 ***\n\n\n       MALONE, J., concurring: I agree with the decision reached by the majority and the\nanalysis Justice Stegall has written for the court. I write separately to address the\nmajority's holding that the prosecutor's closing argument pertaining to occasions when\nRobinson cried and did not cry during the trial was beyond the scope of the penalty phase\nand served no purpose but to inflame the passion of the jurors and divert their attention\nfrom sentencing. Specifically, I write to emphasize why, in my opinion, any comment\nregarding the demeanor of a nontestifying defendant amounts to improper closing\nargument. Nevertheless, I agree the misconduct in this case was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\n\n\n       Robinson never took the stand during his trial. During the penalty stage of his final\nclosing argument, the prosecutor declared to the jury:\n\n\n               \"When the defendant cried, [he] cried one time during this trial, he didn't cry\n       when there was testimony about Lisa Stasi. He didn't cry when there was testimony about\n       Izabela Lewicka's body was taken out of that barrel. He didn't cry when there was\n       testimony about Suzette Trouten—when her family testified—when her body was taken\n       out of that barrel or Beverly Bonner or Sheila Faith or Debbie Faith. He cried for himself.\n       That says it all. He doesn't care anything about anybody but himself. Manipulation and\n       deceit, they go hand in hand with the defendant throughout these last 20 years.\"\n\n\n       Preliminarily, I address the State's argument that these rebuttal comments were\nproper because they were made in response to defendant's closing argument. That\ncontention is not strongly supported by the record but, even if true, the comments were\nstill improper. See State v. Longoria, 301 Kan. 489, 522, 343 P.3d 1128 (2015) (while not\nexcusing prosecutorial misconduct, \"the defense counsel's closing arguments provide\n                                                  397\n\fcontext for the State's rebuttal statements\"); State v. Marshall, 294 Kan. 850, 860-61, 281\nP.3d 1112 (2012) (defendants do not open the door to prosecutorial misconduct, but\nrebuttal nature of prosecutor's arguments is a factor to be considered by appellate court).\n\n\n       During closing argument the prosecutor may discuss \"admitted evidence as long as\nthe remarks accurately reflect the evidence, accurately state the law, and are not intended\nto inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury or divert the jury from its duty to decide\nthe case based on the evidence and the controlling law.\" (Emphasis added.) State v.\nFriday, 297 Kan. 1023, Syl. ¶ 5, 306 P.3d 265 (2013). In delivering this summary, a\nprosecutor has wide latitude to craft arguments that include reasonable inferences to be\ndrawn from the evidence but may not comment on facts outside the evidence. See\nLongoria, 301 Kan. at 524; State v. Novotny, 297 Kan. 1174, Syl. ¶ 7, 307 P.3d 1278\n(2013); State v. Ly, 277 Kan. 386, 392, 85 P.3d 1200, cert. denied 541 U.S. 1090 (2004).\n\n\n       When a prosecutor argues facts not in evidence, misconduct is committed. State v.\nAkins, 298 Kan. 592, 601, 315 P.3d 868 (2010). And a prosecutor generally exceeds the\nproper bounds of argument by offering a personal opinion about witness credibility\n\"because such comments are 'unsworn, unchecked testimony, not commentary on the\nevidence of the case.'\" State v. Duong, 292 Kan. 824, 830, 257 P.3d 309 (2011).\n\n\n       Here, the prosecutor's comments about the defendant crying and not crying—\nwhile seated at counsel table—were not about evidence that came from the witness stand\nbut rather about what the prosecutor said he observed and his opinion about these\nobservations. In essence, the prosecutor made himself an eyewitness and an expert\nwitness who was not subject to the rules of evidence or cross-examination. Of course,\njurors may see a defendant laugh, cry, yawn, stretch, sit without expression, or visit with\ncounsel. From their own observations, jurors may form opinions about a defendant.\nThese observations are a natural consequence of a jury trial; however, a prosecutor\n                                             398\n\fshould not draw attention to these appearances and behaviors—which may have gone\nunnoticed by the jurors—and then pontificate about what these actions mean. See\nNovotny, 297 Kan. at 1189-90 (assuming prosecutor's comment on defendant \"eye-\nballing the witnesses\" was misconduct). Absent an examined explanation from a\ndefendant, it is difficult to know why a defendant would show or not show a certain\nbehavior or emotion during his or her trial.\n\n\n       While I agree with the majority that the prosecutor's closing comments were\nimproper and that the misconduct does not warrant a reversal in this case, my concerns go\nbeyond those expressed by the majority. Commenting on the courtroom demeanor of a\nnontestifying defendant defies the purpose of closing argument, so neither party should\nbe allowed to expressly or implicitly refer to it. Indeed, the only proper comment about\nthe courtroom demeanor of a nontestifying defendant is that the jurors should not\nconsider it in reaching a decision.\n\n                                           ***\n\n\n       JOHNSON, J., dissenting: I agree with the majority's reversal of the capital murder\nconviction under Count III, which included the killing of Izabela Lewicka; but I dissent\nfrom the majority's determination that the State proved capital murder, as the prosecutor\nchose to charge it, in Count II of the complaint. The prosecutor has the duty to prepare a\ncharging document that actually describes a valid crime and then the State must prove all\nof the elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. From a legal, factual, or\nlogical viewpoint, one simply cannot say that those duties were fulfilled in this case. This\ncourt should not provide cover for a prosecutor's charging mistakes in any case, much\nless a death penalty case. Accordingly, both capital murder convictions should be set\naside, along with both corresponding sentences of death.\n\n\n\n                                               399\n\f       The majority jumps the rails at the start of its journey by describing the capital\nmurder charges as follows: \"The State charged Robinson with two counts of capital\nmurder, one count for the intentional, premeditated murder of Suzette Marie Trouten\n(Count II) and the other for the intentional, premeditated murder of Izabela Lewicka\n(Count III).\" Slip op. at 18. It then recites that \"the murders of Trouten and Lewicka were\neach part of a common scheme or course of conduct that also included the intentional,\npremeditated murders of Beverly J. Bonner, Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith and Lisa Stasi.\"\nSlip op. at 18. The majority is apparently implying that the defendant was guilty of the\ncapital murder of Trouten and the capital murder of Lewicka and that the murders of the\nfour other women simply served as proof of a common scheme or course of conduct.\nLater, the majority refers to Trouten and Lewicka as the \"principal capital murder\nvictims,\" declaring that their killings completed the elements of capital murder in each\ncount. Slip op. at 237-38. Although the majority's characterization of the capital murder\ncharges comports with a fair reading of the State's complaint, it is not supported by the\nplain language of the capital murder statute. See K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\n\n\n       I begin with the statutory definition of the precise crime for which the defendant\nwas purportedly charged, convicted, and sentenced to death. That starting point is critical\nbecause it is a legislative function to define crimes. See State v. Bolin, 200 Kan. 369, 370,\n436 P.2d 978 (1968) (\"Generally speaking, of course, it is within the power of the\nlegislature to define what acts shall constitute crimes.\"). Neither an executive branch\nprosecutor, nor a judicial branch appellate court, has the authority to redefine the acts that\nconstitute a legislatively created crime. Here, the relevant part of the applicable statutory\nlanguage states: \"(a) Capital murder is the: . . . (6) intentional and premeditated killing\nof more than one person as a part of the same act or transaction or in two or more acts or\ntransactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\nconduct.\" K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). Hereafter, I will discuss that statute as it relates to the\n\n\n                                             400\n\fone count of capital murder that the majority affirmed, albeit the discussion would apply\nequally to the manner in which the State charged the other capital murder count.\n\n\n         Given its collective experience discerning the plain language of statutes, what\nshould jump out at the majority is that, first and foremost, the crime requires the State to\nprove \"the killing of more than one person.\" Pointedly, the legislature did not say that\ncapital murder is the killing of one person after having previously killed one or more\nother persons. It did not say that capital murder is the killing of one person as part of a\ncommon scheme or course of conduct involving the killing of others. Rather, the\nlegislature said that the State must prove that the defendant killed at least two persons,\nand the crime-defining statute makes absolutely no qualitative distinction between those\ntwo or more victims. In other words, proof of the intentional, premeditated murder of\neach and every victim is a required essential element of the charged crime of capital\nmurder equal in importance to every other element. As the prosecutor charged Count II,\nthe State's burden to prove that the defendant killed Bonner, the Faiths, and/or Stasi was\nno less (or no more) than its burden to prove defendant killed Trouten. Consequently, the\ndesignation of Trouten as a \"principal capital murder victim\" is a phantom concept,\nmanufactured by the State's charging document and perpetuated here by the majority, but\ntotally devoid of any legal support.\n\n\n         Granted, a complaint \"drawn in the language of the statute[] shall be deemed\nsufficient.\" K.S.A. 22-3201(b). And here, the prosecutor incorporated most of the\nstatutory words into the complaint, albeit not in the same order as set forth in the statute.\nNevertheless, in this case, the most damning aspect of the mischaracterization of capital\nmurder as the killing of one person after engaging in a course of conduct of killing others\nis that it permits the majority to divine a new theory whereby the State is permitted to\nexecute a defendant for a murder that occurred before there was a death penalty in this\nState.\n                                             401\n\f       The rule of law has always been that the district court must sentence a person\nwithin the maximum punishment allowable by the law in effect when that person\ncommitted the crime for which sentence is being imposed. See Cooper v. Werholtz, 277\nKan. 250, Syl. ¶ 1, 83 P.3d 1212 (2004) (\"Criminal statutes and penalties in effect at the\ntime of the criminal act are controlling.\"). Likewise, as the majority acknowledges, a\nstatute will operate prospectively in the absence of clear language that it is intended to\noperate retroactively, and K.S.A. 21-3439 lacks such clear retroactive language.\nMoreover, the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution \"is aimed at laws\nthat 'retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal\nacts.' [Collins v. Youngblood, 497 U.S. 37,] at 43 (citing Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 391-\n392 (1798) (opinion of Chase, J.); Beazell v. Ohio, 269 U.S. 167, 169-170 (1925)).\"\n(Emphasis added.) California Dept. of Corrections v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499, 504-05, 115\nS. Ct. 1597, 131 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1995). Here, the majority retroactively alters the\ndefinition of the crimes Robinson committed prior to the July 1, 1994, enactment of\ncapital murder and increases his punishment for those crimes.\n\n\n       In this case, when defendant killed Bonner, the Faiths, and Stasi, the maximum\npenalty for those murders was life in prison. Indeed, in this very case, the district court\nsentenced the defendant to a hard 15 life sentence for the killing of Stasi. But the majority\nvacated that sentence in favor of a death sentence. Given that all of the elements of Stasi's\nintentional, premeditated murder had to be proved in order to fulfill the elements of the\ncapital murder charge, the previously completed intentional, premeditated murder of Stasi\nwas a lesser included offense of the charged capital murder. See K.S.A. 21-3107(2)(b)\n(\"A lesser included crime is: . . . a crime where all elements of the lesser crime are\nidentical to some of the elements of the crime charged.\"). And a person \"may be\nconvicted of either the crime charged or a lesser included crime, but not both.\" K.S.A.\n21-3107(2). But permitting the State to use a predeath penalty murder to fulfill the capital\n                                             402\n\fmurder requirement of two or more killings effectively alters the definition of the prior\nmurders and increases the penalty for the previously completed \"lesser included offense\"\nmurders from life in prison to death.\n\n\n       To rationalize the retroactive application of the death penalty to murders that pre-\ndated the legislative authority to impose that draconian penalty, the majority fashions a\ncompleted-crime theory of prosecution, whereby a murder completed years earlier is\nsubsequently utilized as an element of a capital murder that is \"completed\" after the fact\nby adding a new killing. Pointedly, the majority cites to no Kansas case that has\npermitted such a ploy in any context, much less a capital case. Instead, curiously, the\nmajority points to a statute of limitations statutory provision, K.S.A. 21-3106(6), as direct\nauthority for converting a previously completed crime into an element of a newly\ndefined, more serious crime. The majority's manufactured rationale is flawed.\n\n\n       First, the statutory provision forming the foundation of the majority's theory is a\nsubsection of a statute that is entitled \"Time limitations for commencement of\nprosecutions.\" K.S.A. 21-3106. In other words, the majority's magical provision declaring\nthat an offense is committed when every element occurs is direct authority only when a\ncourt is determining whether the time limit for prosecuting an offense has expired. But\nK.S.A. 21-3106(1) states unequivocally that \"[a] prosecution for murder . . . may be\ncommenced at any time.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, we have no need to ruminate on when\nthe current capital murder was committed for statute of limitation purposes because there\nis no statutory time limitation on prosecuting capital murder. Quite simply, then, K.S.A.\n21-3106(6) is not applicable here.\n\n\n       Perhaps the majority intended to apply the statute of limitations provision by\nanalogy, i.e., as persuasive support for its \"completed crime\" theory of retroactively\nimposing the death sentence. If so, I submit that a statutory provision that is facially more\n                                            403\n\fanalogous to the determination of which crime is applicable is found in K.S.A. 21-\n3102(4), which addressed the scope and application of the Kansas Criminal Code that\nwas effective July 1, 1970. The provision states:\n\n\n               \"This code has no application to crimes committed prior to its effective date. A\n       crime is committed prior to the effective date of the code if any of the essential elements\n       of the crime as then defined occurred before that date. Prosecutions for prior crimes shall\n       be governed, prosecuted and punished under the laws existing at the time such crimes\n       were committed.\" K.S.A. 21-3102(4).\n\n\n       Granted, this court has construed that provision to be applicable only to the\nadoption of the entire new criminal code rather than applying to any subsequent\namendments to crimes within the code. State v. Noah, 246 Kan. 291, 293, 788 P.2d 257\n(1990) (K.S.A. 21-3102[4] refers to crimes committed prior to July 1, 1970, effective\ndate of new criminal code). Nevertheless, it is no less persuasive as to how the law should\nbe applied than the majority's statute of limitations provision. Having completed first-\ndegree premeditated murder before the existence of capital murder, the prosecution for\nthat prior murder should, intuitively as well as logically, be governed under the laws\nexisting at the time such crime was committed. That paradigm comports with the long-\nstanding rule that courts are to impose the punishment that was in effect when the crime\nwas committed and precludes the punishment-increasing gamesmanship displayed here.\n\n\n       Next, even accepting that K.S.A. 21-3106(6) might have something to do with the\nquestion presented to us in this case, it actually confirms that the murders of Bonner, the\nFaiths, and Stasi should be deemed \"committed\" before the adoption of the death penalty.\nEvery element of first-degree premeditated murder had \"occurred\" before the adoption of\ncapital murder. And to the extent that the majority contends that the prior killings had not\nfulfilled their role as its purported \"second element\" of capital murder prior to Trouten's\nmurder, the opinion contradicts itself.\n                                                   404\n\f       The majority describes that \"second element\" as a requirement that \"these killings\nbe part of the same act or transaction or multiple acts or transactions connected together\nor constituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct.\" Slip op. at 237. But\npreviously, in discussing the sufficiency of the evidence, the majority asserted that there\nwas enough evidence that \"the jurors could have found that all of the murders were\nrelated to one another in some way and therefore part of a common scheme or course of\nconduct.\" (Emphasis added.) Slip op. at 235. If it were true that all of the murders were\nsufficient evidence of the second element, then all of the statutory elements of capital\nmurder had occurred before the defendant killed Trouten. The defendant had killed more\nthan one person as part of the same act or transaction (the Faiths) or as parts of a common\nscheme or course of conduct (Bonner, the Faiths, and Stasi), completing all of the\nstatutory elements of capital murder before it was statutorily enacted. Contrary to the\nmajority's declaration, the murder of Trouten was unnecessary to complete the elements\nof capital murder. Rather, the Trouten murder added nothing to the State's theory of\nprosecution, except to use its occurrence date to invoke the death penalty and thereby\nincrease the punishment for the previously completed crimes. In my view, this is a blatant\nexample of ex post facto jurisprudence.\n\n\n       To bolster its contention that the State can increase the penalty for a completed\nfirst-degree premeditated murder, i.e., after the murder has been \"committed,\" the\nmajority resorts to cases from foreign jurisdictions that are not on point. As the majority\npoints out, the crime involved in State v. Zelinka, 130 Or. App. 464, 472, 882 P.2d 624\n(1994)—murder by abuse and criminal mistreatment—required proof that the defendant\nmurdered the victim by abuse after having previously assaulted or tortured the victim or\nanother child. Slip op. at 237-38. Allowing the previous assaults or torture to occur\nbefore enactment of the murder by abuse statute might have been an analog here if capital\nmurder was defined as the intentional, premeditated murder of one person, after having\n                                            405\n\fpreviously murdered others. But as discussed above, that is not how our statute defines\ncapital murder.\n\n\n       Likewise, the crime involved in People v. Grant, 20 Cal. 4th 150, 83 Cal. Rptr. 2d\n295, 973 P.2d 72 (1999), was a violation of a continuous sexual abuse of a minor statute,\nwhereby the defendant had to molest the child three times during a period of not less than\n3 months. See Slip op. at 239. Where a statute requires continuous conduct over a\nspecified time period, it makes sense that the crime is not completed until the last act is\ncommitted. But capital murder can occur in one act or transaction, which presumably\nhappened when defendant killed both Sheila and Debbie Faith, thus completing all of the\nelements of the later-to-be-established crime of capital murder.\n\n\n       In that vein, the majority's assertion that \"the last act or event necessary to trigger\napplication of K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) was the murder of Trouten\" because she was killed\nafter the enactment of capital murder skews the plain statutory language. Slip op. at 239.\nTo belabor the point, the statute required \"the killing of more than one person,\" not the\nkilling of one person after having killed others. When the prosecutor included the killings\nof Bonner, the Faiths, and Stasi in the complaint, all of the elements of capital murder\nwere effectively pled, without considering the killing of Trouten.\n\n\n       The majority rejects Robinson's proffer of United States v. Husted, 545 F.3d 1240\n(10th Cir. 2008), because the federal act applicable there used the word \"travels\" which\ndid not apply to someone who had previously \"traveled.\" Slip op. at 240. Yet, our capital\nmurder statute suggests the present tense when it defines the crime as \"the killing of more\nthan one person.\" Like Husted, that language does not express an intent to apply to\nsomeone who has \"killed\" prior to the statute's enactment. Rather, to commit capital\nmurder under subsection (a)(6), I submit that the defendant had to kill more than one\n\n\n                                             406\n\fperson after the enactment of the capital murder statute in order to fulfill the\nindispensable initial actus reus of the crime.\n\n\n       Even if one is seduced by the majority's interpretation of the capital murder\nstatute, I contend that my present-tense interpretation is certainly a reasonable reading of\nthe statute. In that circumstance, the rule of lenity \"'requires the court to interpret [the\nstatute's] meaning in favor of the accused.'\" State v. Reese, 300 Kan. 650, 658, 333 P.3d\n149 (2014) (quoting State v. Coman, 294 Kan. 84, 97, 273 P.3d 701 [2012]). That\nconstruction principle is even more compelling in a death penalty case, considering the\nfollowing:\n\n\n       \"'[D]eath is a different kind of punishment from any other which may be imposed in this\n       country. . . . From the point of view of the defendant, it is different in both its severity\n       and its finality. From the point of view of society, the action of the sovereign in taking\n       the life of one of its citizens also differs dramatically from any other legitimate state\n       action. It is of vital importance to the defendant and to the community that any decision\n       to impose the death sentence be, and appear to be, based on reason rather than caprice or\n       emotion.' Gardner v. Florida, 430 U.S. 349, 357-358 [1977] (opinion of STEVENS, J.).\"\n       Beck v. Alabama, 447 U.S. 625, 637-38, 100 S. Ct. 2382, 65 L. Ed. 2d 392 (1980).\n\n\n       The majority not only fails to employ the rule of lenity, it bends over backward to\ncreate a way to affirm the capital conviction. That tack baffles me, especially given that\nthe State did not need to ask this court to retroactively apply the capital murder statute.\nBoth Trouten and Lewicka were killed after the enactment of the capital murder statute.\nConsequently, the prosecutor could have avoided the need to use preenactment killings to\nsatisfy the \"killing of more than one person\" element of capital murder by simply\ncharging the murders of Trouten and Lewicka in one capital count, i.e., alleging that\nRobinson killed both Trouten and Lewicka as part of a common scheme or course of\nconduct. Then, the killings of Bonner, the Faiths, and Stasi could have been the subject of\n\n                                                     407\n\ffour separate counts of first-degree, premeditated murder without being vulnerable to a\nmultiplicity or double jeopardy challenge. The reason for splitting the death-eligible\nmurders into two separate counts of capital murder is not readily apparent. Obviously, a\ndeath sentence can only be imposed once; the State's drive to obtain two death sentences\naccomplished nothing beyond creating grist for the appeal mill.\n\n\n       In short, if the State is going to kill its own citizens, even those who commit\nheinous and unfathomable acts, it is not unreasonable to require that the State strictly\ncomply with the laws that authorize the imposition of that ultimate punishment. Here, the\nprosecution did not strictly conform with the law, and it is this court's duty to throw a flag\nand call that foul. I would reverse the remaining capital murder conviction and remand\nfor resentencing as a first-degree premeditated murder. That course of action would\npermit the first-degree premeditated murder conviction and accompanying life sentence\nfor Stasi's killing to be affirmed and would permit the defendant to be convicted for\nLewicka's killing, albeit for the lesser included offense of first-degree premeditated\nmurder.\n\n\n       Even if the State could clear the \"killing of more than one person\" hurdle, I believe\nit stumbles in its attempt to tie the Trouten murder to the others to meet the majority's\n\"second element.\" I disagree with the majority's emphasis on the cherry-picked, out-of-\ncontext phrase from State v. Harris, 284 Kan. 560, 572, 162 P.3d 28 (2007), to conclude\nthat the multiple killings only need to \"'be related to one another in some way.'\" Slip op.\nat 232, 233. Nevertheless, even using the majority's liberal concept of nexus, Trouten's\nmurder does not fit. Stasi was apparently murdered for her child, Bonner for her divorce\nmaintenance payments, the Faiths for their Social Security benefit payments, and\nLewicka to clear the way for a former paramour. The majority states no apparent motive\nfor the Trouten killing. I do not believe that it is sufficient for some of the killer's\nmethods to be similar. The killings have to be related to one another, not the killer's\n                                              408\n\fmethods. I do not read the subsection as including serial, but completely separate,\nkillings. Again, I would reverse the remaining capital murder conviction on evidentiary\ngrounds.\n\n\n       Finally, although there are other aspects of the majority opinion with which I take\nexception, I see no reason for further argument here. I do, however, take the liberty of\nusing this platform to echo the sentiments that Justices Breyer and Ginsburg expressed in\ntheir dissent in the recent case of Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.S. ___, 135 S. Ct. 2726, 2755-\n77, 192 L. Ed. 2d 761 (2015) (Breyer, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., dissenting), in which\nthey called for a reexamination of whether the death penalty, in and of itself, constitutes a\nlegally prohibited cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. 135 S. Ct. at 2756. Notwithstanding the egregious nature of\nthe crimes and the compelling evidence of guilt presented in this particular case, I believe\nit is time for this court to reexamine the constitutionality of the death penalty under § 9 of\nthe Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights, which prohibits the infliction of \"cruel or unusual\npunishment.\"\n\n\n       The Glossip dissent opined that in 1976, when the United States Supreme Court\nupheld the death penalty, \"the Court thought that the constitutional infirmities in the\ndeath penalty could be healed,\" and it \"delegated significant responsibility to the States to\ndevelop procedures that would protect against those constitutional problems.\" 135 S. Ct.\nat 2755 (Breyer, J., dissenting). But \"[a]lmost 40 years of studies, surveys, and\nexperience strongly indicate . . . that this effort has failed.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2755 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). The dissent related that the current administration of the death penalty\n\"involves three fundamental constitutional defects: (1) serious unreliability, (2)\narbitrariness in application, and (3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death\npenalty's penological purpose.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2755-56 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Moreover,\nthe dissent noted that, perhaps as a result of these constitutional defects in the death\n                                              409\n\fpenalty, \"most places within the United States have abandoned its use,\" which makes the\npenalty \"unusual.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2756 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\nCruel—Lack of Reliability\n\n       On the first point, the dissent noted the obvious, i.e., that \"the finality of death\"\nmakes it a qualitatively different punishment that requires a heightened need for\nreliability. 135 S. Ct. at 2756 (Breyer, J., dissenting.) One cannot undo an execution. Yet,\nresearchers have uncovered \"convincing evidence that, in the past three decades, innocent\npeople have been executed,\" as well as striking evidence that the death penalty has been\nwrongly imposed. 135 S. Ct. at 2756 (Breyer, J., dissenting). As of the date of this year's\ndissent in Glossip, \"the number of exonerations in capital cases [had] risen to 115.\" 135\nS. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting). And that only included exonerations in the sense\nthat the defendant was granted \"relief from all legal consequences of a capital conviction\nthrough a decision by a prosecutor, a Governor[,] or a court, after new evidence of the\ndefendant's innocence was discovered.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       Interestingly, \"exonerations occur far more frequently where capital convictions,\nrather than ordinary criminal convictions, are at issue.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). Courts or governors are 130 times more likely to exonerate a defendant\nwhere a death penalty is at issue and 9 times more likely where capital murder, rather\nthan noncapital murder, is at issue. 135 S. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Some\nresearchers have opined that the disparity is at least partially explained by a \"greater\nlikelihood of an initial wrongful conviction\" in a death penalty case, precipitated in part\nbecause capital crimes are typically horrendous murders that generate an \"intense\ncommunity pressure on police, prosecutors, and jurors to secure a conviction.\" 135 S. Ct.\nat 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting). That pressure increases the probability of a wrongful\nconviction. Moreover, I would add my belief that the intense public pressure\n\n                                              410\n\faccompanying the case on appeal increases the likelihood that a wrongful capital\nconviction will be affirmed by a state Supreme Court.\n\n\n       Granted, there are other factors that explain the inordinate number of death penalty\nexonerations, one of which is the practice of death-qualification of the capital jury, i.e.,\nno one can serve as a juror unless he or she is willing to impose the death penalty.\nResearch has led to the conclusion that \"'[f]or over fifty years, empirical investigation has\ndemonstrated that death qualification skews juries toward guilt and death.'\"135 S. Ct. at\n2758 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Likewise, flawed forensic testimony, such as faulty hair\nanalysis, has been used in a number of capital cases. In light of all of the factors,\n\"researchers estimate that about 4% of those sentenced to death are actually innocent.\"\n135 S. Ct. at 2758 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       If one expands the analysis beyond cases establishing actual innocence, the\ninstances in which the law was not followed in capital cases is breathtaking. \"Between\n1973 and 1995, courts identified prejudicial errors in 68% of the capital cases before\nthem.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2759 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \"In sum, there is significantly more\nresearch-based evidence today indicating that courts sentence to death individuals who\nmay well be actually innocent or whose convictions (in the law's view) do not warrant the\ndeath penalty's application.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2759 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\nCruel—Arbitrariness\n\n       \"The arbitrary imposition of punishment is the antithesis of the rule of law.\" 135 S.\nCt. at 2759 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \"[S]tudies indicate that the factors that most clearly\nought to affect application of the death penalty—namely, comparative egregiousness of\nthe crime—often do not,\" while \"circumstances that ought not to affect application of the\ndeath penalty, such as race, gender, or geography, often do.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2760 (Breyer,\n\n                                               411\n\fJ., dissenting). In other words, \"[t]he research strongly suggests that the death penalty is\nimposed arbitrarily.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2762 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Because the \"imposition\nand implementation of the death penalty seems capricious, random, [and] arbitrary,\" its\nimposition on a defendant would seem to be \"the equivalent of being struck by\nlightning.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \"How then can we reconcile the\ndeath penalty with the demands of a Constitution that first and foremost insists upon a\nrule of law?\" 135 S. Ct. at 2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       Reconciling the death penalty with the rule of law under our Kansas Constitution\nis no less imperative. Like elsewhere, the gatekeeper in this State is the prosecutor, who\nhas unfettered discretion in any capital-eligible case to seek, or to not seek, the death\npenalty. To state the obvious, unfettered discretion is fertile ground for sprouting\narbitrariness. In my view, Kansas is fortunate to have so many competent attorneys who\nare willing to engage in public service as prosecutors. Nevertheless, those popularly\nelected public servants cannot be totally immune to the intense public pressure generated\nby high-profile cases. A system that does not safeguard against such potential\narbitrariness cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\n\nCruel—Excessive Delays\n\n       Ironically, the solutions to the problems of unreliability and unfairness \"almost\ninevitably lead to a third independent constitutional problem: excessively long periods of\ntime that individuals typically spend on death row, alive but under sentence of death.\"\n135 S. Ct. at 2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting). As of last year, the average length of time\nbetween sentencing and execution in the United States was almost 18 years. 135 S. Ct. at\n2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Kansas has yet to execute anyone since the 1994 adoption\nof the current capital murder statute, so the average time between sentencing and\nexecution in this State is currently incalculable. Despite this court's recent efforts to\n\n                                              412\n\fimprove the processing of death penalty cases, even when faced with chronic\nunderfunding of the Judicial Branch budget, nothing suggests that Kansas will beat the\nnational average on death penalty delays in the foreseeable future.\n\n\n       The \"lengthy delays create two special constitutional difficulties.\" 135 S. Ct. at\n2765 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The first is the fact that a lengthy delay \"'subjects death row\ninmates to decades of especially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confinement.'\" 135\nS. Ct. at 2765 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \"Indeed, one death row inmate, who was later\nexonerated, still said he would have preferred to die rather than to spend years on death\nrow pursuing his exoneration.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2766 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In Robinson's\ncase, it has been 13 years since he was sentenced to death, and he is still pursuing his\ndirect appeal. After the direct appeal is finally resolved, Robinson has the right to pursue\ncollateral relief in both State and federal courts, which could take years, if not decades.\nRobinson is now 72 years old, making it highly probable that Kansas will face the\nprospect of executing an octogenarian. See Rapaport, A Modest Proposal: The Aged of\nDeath Row Should Be Deemed Too Old To Execute, 77 Brook L. Rev. 1089 (2012).\n\n\n       The second problem is that lengthy delays \"undermine the death penalty's\npenological rationale, perhaps irreparably so.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2767 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\nThe classic rationale for punishment is to secure deterrence, incapacitation, retribution, or\nrehabilitation. Obviously, there is no rehabilitation of an executed person, albeit death\nmost certainly incapacitates that person. But life in prison without possibility of parole is\nno less incapacitating. Accordingly, \"the death penalty's penological rationale in fact rests\nalmost exclusively upon a belief in its tendency to deter and upon its ability to satisfy a\ncommunity's interest in retribution.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2767 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       With respect to deterrence, decades of studies have been unable to establish\nreliable statistical evidence to prove one way or the other whether capital punishment\n                                             413\n\fdeters potential killers. But common sense would dictate that, where a person sentenced\nto death \"is two or three times more likely to find his [or her] sentence overturned or\ncommuted than to be executed,\" and \"has a good chance of dying from natural causes\nbefore any execution (or exoneration) can take place,\" the deterrent effect of a death\npenalty statute would be de minimis. 135 S. Ct. at 2768 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       Likewise, while \"[r]etribution is a valid penological goal,\" one has to question\n\"whether a 'community's sense of retribution' can often find vindication in 'a death that\ncomes,' if at all, 'only several decades after the crime was committed.'\" 135 S. Ct. at 2769\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Arguably, whatever interest in retribution that might be served by\nthe death penalty can be similarly served by a sentence of life in prison without parole.\n135 S. Ct. at 2769 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Moreover, in that event, one would hope that\nthe victim's family and friends could attain some semblance of closure sooner if they are\nspared decades of death penalty appeals.\n\n\n       In short, \"[t]he upshot is that lengthy delays both aggravate the cruelty of the death\npenalty and undermine its jurisprudential rationale.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2769 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). And if the death penalty fails to reach the goals of deterrence or retribution,\n\"'it is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering\nand hence an unconstitutional punishment.'\" 135 S. Ct. at 2769-70 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n\n       Granted, some uninformed, chest-pounding death penalty proponents will demand\nthat the delays between sentencing and execution be shortened, if not eliminated. One\nploy would be to seek a time limit on an appellate court's consideration of a death penalty\nappeal. But doing so would only increase the already too high incidence of unreliable and\narbitrary death penalties and \"risk causing procedural harms that also undermine the\ndeath penalty's constitutionality.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2770 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Indeed, one\n                                             414\n\foffender was exonerated by DNA evidence 30 years after his conviction, so that an\nabbreviated or cursory appellate review would have resulted in the execution of an\ninnocent man. 135 S. Ct. at 2770-71 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In other words, the death\npenalty presents a Catch-22 dilemma: to avoid unconstitutionality, a death sentence must\nbe thoroughly and completely examined and reexamined, but the resultant delay renders\nthe punishment unconstitutional. The remedy is to declare the punishment\nunconstitutional.\n\n\nUnusual—Decline in Death Penalty Use\n\n       The Eighth Amendment proscribes punishments that are cruel and unusual,\nwhereas § 9 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights proscribes punishments that are\ncruel or unusual. The Glossip dissent's Eighth Amendment analysis reviews the recent\ndecline in the number of states that are using the death penalty, as well as the decline in\nthe number of executions in those states still using the punishment. In 2014, only seven\nstates carried out an execution, i.e., 86% of the states did not execute anyone last year.\nEven in Texas, which perennially leads the nation in executions, the number decreased\nfrom 40 in the year 2000, to 10 in the year 2013. Consequently, considering the nation as\na whole, \"[i]t seems fair to say that it is now unusual to find capital punishment in the\nUnited States.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2774 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       I would reiterate what I said in State v. Carr, 300 Kan. 1, 327, 331 P.3d 544\n(2014) (Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), cert. granted in part 135 S.\nCt. 1698 (2015), about giving credence to the Kansas founding fathers' choice to use the\ndisjunctive \"or\" in § 9 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights. Under a plain reading of\nour constitution, a punishment would be infirm if it is either \"cruel,\" or it is \"unusual.\"\nNevertheless, in my view, the death penalty fits both and I would declare it\nunconstitutional in this state.\n\n                                             415\n\f",

Presumed prejudice occurs when pretrial publicity is so pervasive and\nprejudicial that there can be no expectation of an unbiased jury pool in the community. In\ndeciding whether to presume prejudice under the Sixth Amendment to the United States\nConstitution, an appellate court considers seven factors: (1) media interference with\ncourtroom proceedings; (2) the magnitude and tone of the coverage; (3) the size and\ncharacteristics of the community in which the crime occurred; (4) the amount of time that\nelapsed between the crime and the trial; (5) the jury's verdict; (6) the impact of the crime\non the community; and (7) the effect, if any, of a codefendant's publicized decision to\nplead guilty. Actual prejudice occurs when the effect of pretrial publicity is so substantial\nas to taint the entire jury pool.\n\n\n2.\n       K.S.A. 22-2616(1) compels a venue change when the district judge is satisfied that\nthere exists in the county where the prosecution is pending so great a prejudice against\nthe defendant that he or she cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in that county. The\n\n                                               1\n\fcourt considers nine factors in deciding whether community prejudice warrants a change\nof venue under K.S.A. 22-2616(1): (1) the particular degree to which the publicity\ncirculated throughout the community; (2) the degree to which the publicity or that of a\nlike nature circulated to other areas to which venue could be changed; (3) the length of\ntime which elapsed from the dissemination of the publicity to the date of trial; (4) the care\nexercised and the ease encountered in the selection of the jury; (5) the familiarity with the\npublicity complained of and its resultant effects, if any, upon the prospective jurors or the\ntrial jurors; (6) the challenges exercised by the defendant in the selection of the jury, both\nperemptory and for cause; (7) the connection of government officials with the release of\nthe publicity; (8) the severity of the offense charged; and (9) the particular size of the area\nfrom which the venire is drawn.\n\n\n3.\n       The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution guarantee\ncriminal defendants the right to counsel of choice, and due process prohibits judicial\nofficers from punishing or retaliating against a defendant for exercising this right.\n\n\n4.\n       Not every restriction on counsel's time or opportunity to investigate or to consult\nwith his or her client or to otherwise prepare for trial violates a defendant's Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel. Only an unreasoning and arbitrary insistence upon\nexpeditiousness in the face of a justifiable request for delay violates the right to counsel,\nand this right cannot be manipulated to impede the efficient administration of justice.\n\n\n5.\n       Pursuant to K.S.A. 22-3401, continuances may be granted to either party for good\ncause shown. In a criminal case, the decision to continue a case lies within the sound\ndiscretion of the district court, but where a defendant claims the denial of continuance\n                                              2\n\finterfered with his or her ability to present a defense, an appellate court reviews the\nquestion de novo.\n\n\n6.\n       Where a continuance is sought to retain new counsel, a trial court considers the\nfollowing five factors: (1) whether a continuance would inconvenience witnesses, the\ncourt, counsel, or the parties; (2) whether other continuances have been granted; (3)\nwhether legitimate reasons exist for the delay; (4) whether the delay is the fault of the\ndefendant; and (5) whether denial of a continuance would prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n7.\n       The five factors used to consider a request for a continuance for the purpose of\nretaining new counsel do not apply in situations where one of several defense attorneys\nwithdraws from the case and the defendant seeks a continuance to provide the remaining\nmembers of the defense team additional time to prepare for trial but does not seek new\ncounsel.\n\n\n8.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying requests for a\ncontinuance to provide appointed counsel, two experienced death penalty litigators,\nadditional time to prepare a guilt phase defense following the withdrawal of retained\ncounsel, where appointed counsel had represented defendant for nearly 7 months prior to\nretained counsel's withdrawal; appointed counsel still had another 7 months to prepare\nbecause the district judge had granted a previous, lengthy continuance; appointed counsel\nhad the benefit of the work prepared by their predecessors over the course of nearly 2\nyears; appointed counsel had adequate resources, including the two lead attorneys and\ntheir two associate attorneys, one of whom entered his appearance following the\n\n\n                                               3\n\fwithdrawal of retained counsel, an investigator, and several assistants; and defendant\nnever sought appointment of new counsel following retained counsel's withdrawal.\n\n\n9.\n       When requesting a continuance to provide defendant additional time to develop a\nmitigation defense for the penalty phase of a capital murder trial, defendant must make an\nadequate proffer as to what mitigation evidence would be developed if relief were\ngranted.\n\n\n10.\n       The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that search\nwarrants be issued by a neutral and detached magistrate.\n\n\n11.\n       The United States Supreme Court has recognized at least two circumstances in\nwhich a magistrate fails to satisfy the neutral and detached requirement. First, a\nmagistrate who is involved in or who exercises law enforcement powers of the executive\nbranch lacks neutrality and detachment. Second, a magistrate with a direct pecuniary\ninterest in the outcome of the warrant proceedings also lacks neutrality and detachment.\n\n\n12.\n       In assessing whether a magistrate lacks neutrality and detachment, an appellate\ncourt considers whether the circumstances would offer a possible temptation to the\naverage judge to abandon the correct balance of consideration between the State and the\naccused. In applying this standard, it conducts an individualized and contextual inquiry,\nin light of the totality of the circumstances.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n\f13.\n       The circumstances here—when the issuing magistrate had prosecuted the\ndefendant 15 years earlier for unrelated financial crimes—do not establish a violation of\nthe neutral and detached magistrate requirement. The magistrate had disengaged\ncompletely from law enforcement, had no involvement in any subsequent investigation or\nprosecution of the defendant, and had no knowledge of the defendant's possible\ninvolvement in other missing persons investigations; the former prosecution and current\ncapital murder investigation did not arise from a common investigation or single\ntransaction or event; and any overlapping facts between the magistrate's former\nprosecution of defendant and the current investigation were not probative of the probable\ncause determinations made by the magistrate.\n\n\n14.\n       When K.S.A. 22-2503 and K.S.A. 22-2505 are read together and considered\nalongside legislative amendments subsequent to the 1970 codification of the Kansas\nCode of Criminal Procedure, it is evident the legislature intended that district judges\nretain their pre-Code authority to issue search warrants executable statewide.\n\n\n15.\n       In this case, Lenexa police exercised \"their powers as law enforcement officers\"\nby planning, coordinating, and executing trash pulls from the defendant's Olathe\nresidence over the course of several weeks in furtherance of their investigation, and this\nactivity exceeded the officers' territorial jurisdiction pursuant to K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(a).\n\n\n16.\n       When a defendant seeks to suppress evidence based on a violation of state law\nunrelated to the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or § 15 of the\n\n\n                                              5\n\fKansas Constitution Bill of Rights, application of the exclusionary rule does not\ninevitably follow.\n\n\n17.\n       K.S.A. 22-3216(1) provides a vehicle for defendants aggrieved by an unlawful\nsearch and seizure to move to suppress evidence, but it does not compel the trial court to\ngrant such relief for any search conducted in violation of state law.\n\n\n18.\n       The limitation on the territorial jurisdiction of city officers was intended to protect\nthe local autonomy of neighboring cities and counties, not to create an individual right.\n\n\n19.\n       Where, as here, a search is conducted in violation of state law and the statute\nviolated does not vest the defendant with an individual right, does not contemplate\nexclusion of evidence as a remedy, and its violation results in no cognizable injury to\ndefendant's substantial rights, suppression of the evidence is not an appropriate remedy.\n\n\n20.\n       A written request for assistance directed to officers in other jurisdictions that is\nsigned by an officer from the requesting jurisdiction—Linn County in this case—satisfies\nthe requirements of K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(b) and confers jurisdiction upon officers from\nother jurisdictions to execute a search warrant in Linn County.\n\n\n21.\n       K.S.A. 22-2401a(5) authorizes law enforcement officers in Johnson County to\nexecute search warrants countywide. Based on the plain language of this statute,\nreinforced by the context and history giving rise to its enactment, Lenexa and Overland\n                                              6\n\fPark city police had territorial jurisdiction to execute warrants to search defendant's\nresidence and storage unit located within the city limits of Olathe.\n\n\n22.\n       On the facts presented here, law enforcement officers did not search or seize trash\nwithin the curtilage of defendant's home and defendant did not have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in his discarded trash, when it had been set out for collection near\nthe end of an asphalt parking area, against the curb line, and approximately 10 to 12 feet\noutside of a fence that surrounded his residence.\n\n\n23.\n       The Kansas Wiretap Act requires prosecutors seeking to intercept telephonic\ncommunications to make a showing of necessity for this extraordinary investigative tool\nby including in the wiretap application a complete statement on whether other\ninvestigative procedures have been tried and failed or on why other methods reasonably\nappear to be dangerous or unlikely to succeed if tried.\n\n\n24.\n       The purpose of the necessity requirement for a wiretap is to assure that\nwiretapping is not resorted to in situations where traditional investigative techniques\nwould suffice to expose a crime and to prevent law enforcement from using wiretaps as a\nfirst step in an investigation.\n\n\n25.\n       General allegations and boilerplate language fail to satisfy the necessity\nrequirement for a wiretap. However, an appellate court employs a standard of\nreasonableness to evaluate the State's good-faith effort to use alternative investigative\nmeans or its failure to do so because of danger or a low probability of success. Law\n                                              7\n\fenforcement officers are not required to exhaust every possible technique before resorting\nto a wiretap—they must instead demonstrate that wiretapping is not the first meaningful\nstep in the investigation.\n\n\n26.\n       In this case, general language in the State's wiretap application that the use of\nsearch warrants would not further the goals of the investigation did not violate the\nnecessity requirement, where the application and supporting affidavit demonstrated that\nlaw enforcement made a reasonable good-faith effort to utilize other available normal and\nless intrusive investigative techniques before resorting to a wiretap, and a general\nstatement regarding the ineffectiveness of search warrants was supported by\nparticularized, case-specific information contained throughout the application and\naffidavit.\n\n\n27.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate the defendant's\nsubstantive rights under state or federal law in limiting voir dire on certain case-specific\nfacts where the defendant had the opportunity to formulate his own case-specific\nquestions in the juror questionnaire; the defense disclosed sensitive case-specific facts\nduring small group voir dire and inquired whether such facts rendered panelists biased;\ndefendant was allowed to question panelists during general voir dire on case-specific\nevidence anticipated at trial; and the district judge limited voir dire only when the\nquestions required prospective jurors to prejudge the penalty issue based on a general\ndescription of case-specific facts.\n\n\n28.\n       The heightened reliability standard applied in death penalty appeals does not bar\nthe application of the invited error doctrine.\n                                                 8\n\f29.\n       In capital murder trials, a prospective juror may be excluded for cause because of\nhis or her death penalty views if those views prevent or substantially impair the\nperformance of his or her duties as a juror. The same standard applies whether the\nchallenge is directed at death-leaning or life-leaning jurors.\n\n\n30.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's\nchallenges for cause of veniremembers who expressed support or favor for the death\npenalty. All of the veniremembers at issue professed their understanding of and fidelity to\nthe law, and the district judge's rulings were fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n31.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's\nchallenges for cause of veniremembers who were allegedly biased by pretrial publicity.\nThe record fairly supports the district judge's findings that the veniremembers at issue\ncould set their opinions aside, adhere to the court's instructions, and render a verdict\nbased on the evidence.\n\n\n32.\n       In this case, the trial court did not apply a more lenient standard of qualification to\njurors who supported the death penalty, in violation of defendant's substantive due\nprocess rights. The record confirms the district judge's rulings were supported by the voir\ndire testimony of the veniremembers at issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f33.\n       When improper or prejudicial remarks are made by one veniremember and heard\nby other veniremembers during the jury selection process, the test of juror impartiality is\nwhether those jurors actually seated can lay aside their impressions or opinions and\nrender a verdict based on the evidence.\n\n\n34.\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case in failing to strike all\npanelists on a small group panel exposed to a juror's inflammatory comments about the\ndefendant when the juror's comments were isolated and not founded on any specialized\nknowledge; the defendant failed to pursue curative measures; and the only panelist to\neventually serve on the jury declared his impartiality.\n\n\n35.\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case in granting the State's\nchallenge of a juror who expressed strong opposition to the death penalty when she\nconsistently expressed uncertainty about her ability to fairly consider both sentencing\noptions.\n\n\n36.\n       An appellate court employs a two-part balancing test in analyzing the propriety of\na district court's use of an anonymous jury identification system. First, there must be a\nreason to protect the jurors from identification, a decision left to the trial court's\ndiscretion. Second, the court must take reasonable precautions to minimize any\nprejudicial effects.\n\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\f37.\n       In this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion or violate the defendant's\nsubstantial rights by employing a juror numbering system to identify veniremembers and\nseated jurors when the district judge identified the potential for invasion of juror privacy\nby the media or other overzealous individuals, particularly in the absence of\nsequestration, as the reason for the system and expressly informed the jury that the\nprocedure was unrelated to juror safety.\n\n\n38.\n       To establish the existence of a common scheme or course of conduct pursuant to\nK.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), the State must show that the alleged intentional and premeditated\nmurders are related to one another in some way.\n\n\n39.\n       In this case, evidence that the defendant lured his victims with promises of\nfinancial gain, employment, or travel; exploited them sexually or financially; used similar\nmethods to murder them and dispose of their bodies; and used similar methods of\ndeception to conceal the crimes was sufficient to support the jury's finding of the\nexistence of a common scheme or course of conduct.\n\n\n40.\n       In this case, the entirety of the defendant's course of conduct, which straddled the\ndate of enactment of the capital murder statute, could be considered and was sufficient to\nsupport the defendant's convictions on the capital murder charges under K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) when at least one of the elements of the charged offense was not committed\nuntil after the enactment of the capital murder statute.\n\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f41.\n       When, as here, a defendant is charged and convicted of two counts of capital\nmurder, those convictions are multiplicitous when the State alleged and proved that all of\nthe murders were connected by the same common scheme or course of conduct and the\nState did not allege or prove the existence of a separate, distinct common scheme or\ncourse of conduct for each capital count.\n\n\n42.\n       A conviction for first-degree murder of one of the victims included in a series of\nmurders alleged under a separate charge of capital murder is multiplicitous with a\nconviction on the charge of capital murder.\n\n\n43.\n       The State's complaint was not defective and did not fail to confer jurisdiction on\nthe district court in this case because the complaint as a whole was clear what the charges\nwere and that defendant was the person charged.\n\n\n44.\n       The failure to lodge a contemporaneous objection to the admission of evidence\ntypically forecloses subsequent challenge on appeal. However, in capital murder appeals,\nK.S.A. 21-4627(b), recodified as K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 21-6619(b), compels review of any\nissue raised in defendant's brief, even if not preserved below. Yet this statute does not\nrequire this court to treat the record other than as it is presented to us on appeal, and we\napproach such compulsory review mindful that the defendant bears the burden of\ndemonstrating error on the record submitted.\n\n\n\n\n                                              12\n\f45.\n       Accurate printouts of e-mails are akin to duplicate originals and deemed valid\nreproductions of electronically stored information for best evidence purposes under\nK.S.A. 60-467(a), even when messages have been forwarded or contain message strings.\n\n\n46.\n       E-mail exhibits found in a defendant's possession or under his or her control and\nseized pursuant to a search warrant can be authenticated by law enforcement officers'\ntestimony describing the circumstances in which the writings were seized.\n\n\n47.\n       Testimony that merely suggests a defendant intended to commit a crime falls\noutside the scope of K.S.A. 60-455. The evidentiary restriction is triggered by evidence\nthat a person actually committed a crime or civil wrong on a specified occasion, not by\nspeculation.\n\n\n48.\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case in allowing a detective to\ntestify to the number of tools seized during the search of the defendant's property when\nthe record establishes a logical connection between the tools, the defendant, and the\ncapital murder charges.\n\n\n49.\n       The trial court properly refused to grant a mistrial in this case after a witness'\ntestimony deviated from the State's proffer when the district judge instructed the jury to\ndisregard the testimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f50.\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in this case in allowing a medical\nexaminer to testify that a fracture to a victim's right ulna was consistent with a defensive\ninjury when the evidence established the expert's qualifications to render such an opinion.\n\n\n51.\n       In this case, the State offered sufficient evidence that the defendant took the victim\nnamed in the aggravated kidnapping charge by way of deception with the specific intent\nto inflict bodily injury upon her.\n\n\n52.\n        Because the State's two theories as to how the defendant took the victim named in\nthe aggravated kidnapping charge by deception could support but one conviction, the\nState did not rely on multiple acts in this case.\n\n\n53.\n       The prosecutor erred in this case by suggesting a victim may have witnessed her\nmother's murder before her own demise, but the isolated remarks did not prejudice the\ndefendant.\n\n\n54.\n       The prosecutor erred in this case by asserting that the defendant ripped one\nvictim's baby out of her arms, but the remark did not prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n55.\n       The phrases \"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\" are commonly understood\nand require no specific definition in jury instructions under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). The\n\n\n                                              14\n\flack of a statutory definition for the phrases \"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\"\ndoes not render the capital murder statute unconstitutionally vague.\n\n\n56.\n       In this case, the trial court's instruction on venue was error, but the defendant\nfailed to establish that the jury would have reached a different verdict had the instruction\nerror not occurred.\n\n\n57.\n       In this case, the cumulative effect of the identified guilt phase errors did not\nsubstantially prejudice defendant or deny him a right to a fair trial.\n\n\n58.\n       In this case, there is no reasonable possibility that a juror's use of a Bible during\npenalty phase deliberations affected the jury's sentencing decision when the juror\nconsulted the Bible only outside of deliberations, he did not use or read from the Bible in\nthe jury room, he made an isolated remark about the Bible only after the jury's vote had\nconfirmed its unanimity as to sentence, and the district judge delivered a curative\ninstruction.\n\n\n59.\n       In this case, the State's evidence demonstrated a nexus between defendant's killing\nof more than one person and the charged capital offenses and was sufficient to establish\nthe existence of the multiple murder aggravating circumstance under K.S.A. 21-4625(2).\n\n\n\n\n                                              15\n\f60.\n       The prosecutor's closing argument comment on the defendant's demeanor was\nerror in this case, but it did not prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n61.\n       The prosecutor's statement in this case that he would \"bet\" the victims' families\nwould not agree that defendant posed a low risk of violence in prison was error, but it did\nnot prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n62.\n       In this case, the prosecutor's interrupted personalized attack of defense counsel's\nargument was error, but it did not prejudice the defendant.\n\n\n63.\n        The penalty phase instructions in this case did not create an unreasonable risk that\njurors would fail to recognize that they must find that aggravating factors outweighed\nmitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt in order to impose a death sentence.\n\n\n64.\n       The penalty phase instructions in this case made clear that mitigating\ncircumstances were to be determined by each individual juror and did not need to be\nfound by all members of the jury in order to be considered by an individual juror.\n\n\n65.\n       The penalty phase instructions in this case did not encourage a death verdict.\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\f66.\n        The penalty phase instructions in this case did not undermine the jury's historic\nnullification power or otherwise create a reasonable likelihood that jurors would have\napplied instructions in a way that prevented consideration of constitutionally relevant\nevidence.\n\n\n67.\n        The defendant was not improperly sentenced under a void capital sentencing\nscheme under the facts in this case.\n\n\n68.\n        In this case, the cumulative effect of the identified errors during the penalty phase\ndid not substantially prejudice the defendant or deny him the right to a fair penalty phase\nproceeding.\n\n\n69.\n        In this case, the trial court erred by designating Counts I through III as sexually\nmotivated in the journal entry of judgment where the State did not seek such a\ndesignation and the district judge did not make supporting findings when pronouncing the\nsentence from the bench.\n\n\n        Appeal from Johnson District Court; JOHN ANDERSON III, judge. Opinion filed November 6,\n2015. Affirmed in part, reversed in part, vacated in part, and remanded with directions.\n\n\n        Paige A. Nichols, of Lawrence, argued the cause, and Joseph W. Luby, of Death Penalty\nLitigation Clinic, of Kansas City, Missouri, was with her on the briefs for appellant/cross-appellee.\n\n\n        Steven J. Obermeier, senior deputy district attorney, and Jacob M. Gontesky, assistant district\nattorney, argued the cause, and Christopher L. McMullin, chief deputy district attorney, Stephen M.\n\n                                                    17\n\fHowe, district attorney, Natalie Chalmers, assistant solicitor general, Kristafer Ailslieger, deputy solicitor\ngeneral, and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, were with them on the briefs for appellee/cross-appellant.\n\n\nThe opinion of the court was delivered by\n\n\n        STEGALL, J.: John E. Robinson, Sr., was charged with multiple offenses related to\nthe murders of six women—killings that constituted parts of a common scheme or course\nof conduct whereby Robinson would lure women to Johnson County with offers of\nemployment, travel, and other benefits; exploit them sexually, financially, or otherwise;\nkill them and dispose of their bodies in a similar manner; and engage in various acts of\nfraud, deceit, and manipulation to conceal his crimes. This common scheme or course of\nconduct began in the mid-1980s and continued until Robinson's arrest in June 2000.\n\n\n        The State charged Robinson with two counts of capital murder, one count for the\nintentional, premeditated murder of Suzette Marie Trouten (Count II) and the other for\nthe intentional, premeditated murder of Izabela Lewicka (Count III). The State alleged,\npursuant to K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), that the murders of Trouten and Lewicka were each\npart of a common scheme or course of conduct that also included the intentional,\npremeditated murders of Beverly J. Bonner, Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith, and Lisa Stasi.\n\n\n        The State also charged Robinson with aggravated kidnapping of Trouten (Count\nI), theft of Vicki Neufeld's property (Count IV), first-degree premeditated murder of Lisa\nStasi (Count V), and aggravated interference with Stasi's parental custody (Count VI).\nThe jury convicted Robinson on all counts.\n\n\n        Following the guilt phase trial, a separate sentencing proceeding was held pursuant\nto K.S.A. 21-4624(b). The penalty phase jury sentenced Robinson to death on each\ncapital murder conviction and that sentence was imposed by the trial court. Additionally,\n\n                                                     18\n\fthe trial court sentenced Robinson to 246 months in prison for the aggravated kidnapping\nof Trouten, 7 months for the theft of Neufeld's property, a life sentence with parole\neligibility after 15 years for the first-degree premeditated murder of Stasi, and a pre-\nsentencing guidelines sentence of 5 to 20 years or a postsentencing guidelines sentence of\n13 months for the aggravated interference with Stasi's parental custody.\n\n\n       On appeal, Robinson has raised 19 general claims of reversible error covering the\nentire proceeding below. Within these general claims, Robinson asserts a variety of sub-\nclaims. For simplicity, we number the general issues consecutively and address all claims\narising under each category. At the outset, we take the unusual step of noting that our\nreview of this matter—given its size and complexity—has been assisted and facilitated by\nthe diligence and professionalism of the trial judge, Judge Anderson, throughout the\nproceedings below. Moreover, the decision we announce today is in large part a product\nof Judge Anderson's conscientious commitment to Robinson's fair trial rights.\n\n\n               FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND – GUILT PHASE\n\n       Resolution of Robinson's claims on this appeal demands a comprehensive review\nof the disturbing facts underlying his convictions and sentences.\n\n\nJohn Robinson, Sr.\n\n       Robinson was a self-employed, but not entirely successful, entrepreneur. In the\n1970s, he formed Hydro-Gro, Inc., a company that produced hydroponic vegetables. In\nthe 1980s, Robinson offered financial consulting services through his company Equi II.\nHis operations were interrupted when he was convicted of a nonperson felony and\nincarcerated at the Western Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron, Missouri.\nFollowing his release in the 1990s until his arrest, Robinson published a mobile home\n\n                                             19\n\ftrade magazine called Manufactured Modular Home Living through his company\nSpecialty Publications.\n\n\n       Robinson lived with his wife Nancy in a three-bedroom modular home in Olathe,\ninside Santa Barbara Estates—a large mobile home community. Robinson used\ncomputers and e-mail extensively and also utilized a cell phone and pager. Nancy began\nworking as the on-site office manager at Santa Barbara Estates in 1997.\n\n\n       In the mid-1990s, Robinson acquired roughly 17 acres of property at a secluded\nLinn County location. He moved a trailer onto the property in July 1998 and installed two\nphone lines: one for his landline and one for his computer.\n\n\n       Though married to Nancy since 1964, Robinson's infidelity was an ongoing issue\nin their marriage. In 1998, Nancy learned her husband was involved in bondage and\ndiscipline, dominance and submission, sadism, and masochism (BDS&M) activities after\ndiscovering fetish websites saved in his Internet browser history. Robinson shared stories\nof his BDS&M liaisons with Carlos Ibarra, a maintenance employee at Santa Barbara\nEstates, and showed him nude photographs of a girlfriend depicted in BDS&M poses.\n\n\nRobinson's Victims\n\n       The State's capital murder theory in Counts II and III was that Robinson killed\nSuzette Trouten and Izabela Lewicka, along with Sheila and Debbie Faith, Beverly\nBonner and Lisa Stasi, and that these killings were all connected, constituting parts of a\ncommon scheme or course of conduct characterized by: (1) luring women with offers of\nemployment, travel, and other benefits; (2) exploiting them financially, sexually, or\notherwise; (3) killing them and disposing of their bodies in a similar manner; and (4)\nconcealing the crimes through acts of deception and fraud. The State alleged Robinson\n\n                                             20\n\fcommitted other crimes along the way, including the aggravated kidnapping of Trouten,\ntheft of Neufeld's property, first-degree murder of Stasi, and aggravated interference with\nStasi's parental custody.\n\n\n       1. Suzette Marie Trouten\n\n       Suzette Marie Trouten was the youngest of Carolyn and Harry Trouten's five\nchildren. She lived near her mother in the Monroe, Michigan, area. The two were\nextremely close and talked daily, even when Trouten was away.\n\n\n       Unbeknownst to her mother, Trouten was active in the BDS&M community. She\nfrequented BDS&M websites and chat rooms, created her own BDS&M web page, and\ntraveled out of state for BDS&M trysts.\n\n\n       In the mid-1990s, Trouten met Lore Remington, a Canadian resident who shared\nTrouten's interest in BDS&M role playing games. Remington trained Trouten as a\n\"slave,\" the submissive partner in a BDS&M relationship, for these online games, and the\ntwo became close friends. Remington introduced Trouten to her friend, Tami Taylor, who\nalso lived in Canada, shared an interest in BDS&M, and became another friend.\n\n\n       Trouten placed personal ads on BDS&M websites seeking a position as a \"slave.\"\nAt that point, Trouten and Robinson began communicating by e-mail. In summer 1999,\nTrouten told her mother that Robinson had offered her a job caring for his elderly father,\n\"Papa John.\" Trouten said Robinson and his father were selling off several companies\nand Papa John needed nursing care as they traveled to various locations to close the deals.\nTrouten said the job would pay $60,000 annually and require extensive travel to places\nsuch as Switzerland and Belgium.\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\f       In October 1999, Trouten traveled to Kansas City, telling her mother she had an\ninterview with Robinson. When she returned a few days later, Trouten told her mother\nshe did not like the idea of being away from home but had decided to take the job for 1\nyear to earn enough money to return to school. Trouten took a second trip to Kansas in\nNovember, explaining she had to sign an employment contract and find a place to live.\n\n\n       Trouten shared the news of her employment opportunity with other friends and\nfamily. She told Taylor she would be working for a man named John, who needed\nsomeone to care for his elderly father, a wealthy businessman, while they traveled to\nEurope and other destinations throughout the United States. Trouten told Remington she\nwould earn $6,500 per month and travel to places such as Australia and Hawaii working\nfor Robinson. Trouten gave similar reports to her aunt, father, and employer in Michigan.\n\n\n       In late 1999 and early 2000, Trouten prepared for the move to Kansas and her\nupcoming travels. She researched colleges and other learning opportunities in\nSwitzerland and Belgium, telling her mother that Robinson said they would be overseas\nlong enough for her to take classes. Trouten completed a passport application. Just before\nTrouten left, her aunt, Marshalla Chidester, helped Trouten create a list of her friends' and\nfamily's contact information.\n\n\n       On or about February 12, 2000, Trouten left for Kansas, bringing along her two\nbeloved Pekingese dogs, Peka and Harry, in the moving truck Robinson had rented for\nher. On February 14, Trouten arrived and checked into Room 216 at the Guesthouse\nSuites in Lenexa. Robinson had reserved this room for 7 nights under his company's\nname, Specialty Publications. The reservation was later extended for an additional week.\n\n\n       When Trouten checked into her room, hotel staff informed her of their no-pet\npolicy. On February 16, Robinson brought two Pekingese dogs, one named Harry and the\n                                             22\n\fother named Peka, for boarding at Ridgeview Animal Hospital in Olathe. Robinson said\nthe dogs belonged to his employee. In completing check-in paperwork, Robinson\nindicated the dogs would be boarded through the end of February.\n\n\n       Once in Kansas, Trouten called her mother almost every day. Trouten told her\nmother she had decided to put her belongings in storage, rather than find an apartment\nimmediately, because she and Robinson would be leaving on their trip soon. Trouten also\nsaid their itinerary had changed. Rather than travel to Switzerland as originally planned,\nthey had decided to go to California, pick up Robinson's new yacht, and sail to Hawaii\nfirst, so Robinson could relax before resuming his meetings.\n\n\n       Trouten and Remington continued to communicate daily on ICQ, an instant\nmessaging program on Yahoo. In these conversations, Trouten disclosed that she was in a\nsexual relationship with Robinson. At trial, Robinson conceded that he and Trouten had\ncarried on a sexual, BDS&M relationship. The fact of this relationship was corroborated\nby other evidence at trial, including several e-mails in which they discussed BDS&M; a\n\"slave\" contract signed by Trouten, purportedly governing the terms of their master/slave\nrelationship; and a videotape of the two engaging in BDS&M sex.\n\n\n       The timeline of events on March 1 implicated Robinson in Trouten's\ndisappearance. Around 1 a.m. on March 1, Trouten called her mother at work and said\nshe and Robinson were leaving on their trip later that morning. Carolyn Trouten never\nsaw or spoke to her daughter again.\n\n\n       Trouten and Remington were also communicating via ICQ chat early that\nmorning. Remington ended her chat session with Trouten at 12:51 a.m. Remington never\nsaw or spoke to Trouten again.\n\n\n                                            23\n\f       At 11:43 a.m., a long-distance call was placed from Robinson's Linn County\ntrailer to Nancy Robinson's work phone.\n\n\n       At 2:13 p.m., Robinson picked up Trouten's dogs at the animal clinic in Olathe.\nEmployees said Robinson appeared to be agitated and in a hurry. He told one employee\nhe was in a rush to get to the airport. Robinson placed the dogs in a small kennel and left.\nTrouten was not seen with Robinson or in his truck at the animal clinic.\n\n\n       At 2:24 p.m., Robinson's access code was used to gain entry through the security\ngates at his Olathe storage unit, and the code was used to exit the facility 6 minutes later.\n\n\n       At 2:35 p.m., Olathe animal control officer Rodney E. McClain was dispatched to\nSanta Barbara Estates after Robinson had instructed the office assistant to report two\ndogs on the loose. McClain arrived 10 minutes later and saw two Pekingese dogs inside a\nsmall-medium-sized carrying kennel located just outside the office. Both appeared to be\nin good condition. McClain transported them to the local shelter. Trouten never claimed\nher dogs.\n\n\n       Around 3 p.m., Isabel Clark, a housekeeper at the Guesthouse Suites,\nobserved a man matching Robinson's general physical description loading\nTrouten's belongings from Room 216 into a truck matching the description of\nRobinson's vehicle in the hotel parking lot. When she cleaned the room, Clark\nnoticed the linens and towels were stained with blood. However, she had observed\nsimilar blood stains when she cleaned the room throughout Trouten's stay. Trouten\nhad an irregular menstrual cycle and would bleed heavily. Trouten told Remington\nthat she was experiencing a particularly long and heavy period at the end of\nFebruary.\n\n\n                                             24\n\f       Around 3:30 p.m., a hotel security camera captured Robinson checking out\nof Trouten's room. Hotel staff confirmed Robinson was the person who checked\nout of the room and paid the bill. Trouten was not with Robinson at the time, and\nhotel employees did not see her at all on March 1.\n\n\n       A few days after Trouten had supposedly left for California, Carolyn Trouten\nreceived a letter from her daughter. Its arrival was somewhat unusual, as Trouten\ntypically called her mother and did not write letters. The letter arrived in a pink envelope\npostmarked from Kansas City on March 6, 2000. The envelope was addressed to Carolyn\nTrouten, and the return address said only \"Suzette Trouten.\" The handwritten letter was\ndated February 28, 2000, and discussed Trouten's plans to leave for California with\nRobinson. Carolyn Trouten believed the handwriting on the envelope and letter was her\ndaughter's. However, she found it unusual the envelope was postmarked Kansas City on\nMarch 6 because Trouten said they were leaving on March 1. Suzette's father, who lived\nin Florida, received a similar handwritten letter dated February 28, 2000, in an envelope\npostmarked Kansas City on March 6, 2000.\n\n\n       Suspicious of the postmark date, Carolyn Trouten called Robinson, who said\nTrouten had decided not to take the job. Robinson claimed she had met a man named Jim\nTurner and left town with him. Jim Turner was one of Robinson's aliases.\n\n\n       A few weeks after receiving the first handwritten letter, Carolyn Trouten received\na second letter purportedly written by her daughter in an envelope postmarked from San\nJose, California. This time, the letter was typewritten with Trouten's name signed in\ncursive at the bottom. Trouten's mother believed the signature was Trouten's. The letter\nopened with the statement: \"Well, I'm off on an adventure of a lifetime.\" Carolyn\nTrouten was convinced Trouten did not draft the letter because the language, style,\nwording, and typewritten format were wholly inconsistent with her daughter's writing.\n                                             25\n\f       Just before her April 9 birthday, Trouten's grandmother received a birthday card\npurportedly written by Trouten. The card was in a green envelope postmarked San Jose,\nCalifornia, on March 27, 2000. Trouten's aunt, Chidester, believed the mailing address on\nthe envelope was written in Trouten's handwriting but that the \"S. Trouten\" written in the\nreturn address section of the envelope was not. Trouten's father also received a similar\ntypewritten letter in an envelope postmarked San Jose, California, March 27, 2000.\n\n\n       Unbeknownst to Trouten's family, Robinson had made arrangements in late March\n2000 for Jean Glines to mail several letters for him from California. Glines was a former\nemployee of Nancy Robinson, who maintained a long-distance relationship with\nRobinson by telephone and e-mail after she moved to California in 1997. Robinson asked\nGlines to mail some letters for him from California as a favor. Glines, who had grown\ntired of the relationship with Robinson, agreed to mail the letters if Robinson stopped\ncalling her. Glines received a package containing three pastel-colored envelopes from\nRobinson on March 27. Glines noticed some of the letters were addressed to a person in\n\"Minnesota or Michigan,\" and there was no return address, only the name \"Sue,\"\n\"Suzette,\" or the initials \"ST.\" Glines mailed the letters that day from Milpitas, where all\nmail is sent to and postmarked San Jose, California.\n\n\n       Several weeks later, Trouten's family received a number of letters purportedly\nauthored by Trouten in envelopes postmarked Veracruz, Mexico, on May 19, 2000.\nTrouten's aunt, Chidester, received one of these letters. She believed the address on the\nenvelope was written by Trouten, but the return address was not. The letter was\ntypewritten and dated May 5, 2000. It discussed Trouten's travels and was signed, \"Love\nyou, Suzette.\" Chidester believed Trouten signed the letter, but she was convinced\nTrouten did not draft it because the punctuation, style, and organization were not\n\n\n                                             26\n\fcharacteristic of Trouten's writing. Trouten's niece, her grandmother, and her father\nreceived similar letters postmarked May 19 from Veracruz, Mexico.\n\n\n       Once again, unbeknownst to Trouten's family, Robinson had made arrangements\nfor several letters to be mailed from Mexico in May 2000. Lidia Ponce lived in Veracruz,\nMexico. Her son, Carlos Ibarra, was a maintenance employee at Santa Barbara Estates\nand did side jobs for Robinson. Ponce traveled to Olathe to visit her son at the beginning\nof May. Robinson asked Ibarra to have his mother mail several letters from a resort when\nshe returned to Mexico. Robinson gave Ibarra several pastel-colored envelopes, which\nIbarra gave to his mother. Ponce returned to Mexico around May 10 and mailed the\nletters from a hotel in Veracruz several days later after writing the sender's initials on the\nenvelopes as Robinson had instructed. At trial, Ponce examined the envelopes Trouten's\nfamily had received and said they were consistent with the ones she had mailed from\nVeracruz and that the writing on the return address appeared to be her own.\n\n\n       When law enforcement officers searched Robinson's storage unit in Olathe, they\nfound the contact list that Chidester helped Trouten create before moving to Kansas. This\nlist included the mailing addresses and, for some, birthday information for Trouten's\nfamily members. The officers also seized a clear plastic folder containing 42 envelopes\npreaddressed to members of Trouten's family, along with 31 pieces of pastel-colored\nstationary with \"Love you, Suzette\" signed at the bottom. The officers also found over a\ndozen pastel-colored envelopes with enclosed greeting cards and envelopes inside a\nplastic Target sack. These envelopes were preaddressed to members of Trouten's family,\nwith \"S. Trouten\" written in the return address and the individual's birthday written in the\nupper-right corner where postage is typically placed. There were also several letters with\ngeneric greetings such as \"Hi, dad\" or \"Hi, mom\" handwritten at the top of stationary,\nalong with a number of blank envelopes, stationary, and greeting cards.\n\n\n                                              27\n\f         This was not the first time Robinson had prepared or coordinated deceptive letter\nwriting campaigns. In fall 1997, Robinson met Aleisia Cox through a personal ad she\nplaced in a local magazine. Sometime in 1998, Robinson offered Cox a job traveling with\nhim on business trips to London, Paris, and Australia. Before their scheduled departure,\nhe directed Cox to write letters to her mother and daughter as though she had already\narrived at each of these destinations, explaining there would not be time to write family\nduring the trips. Cox complied, crafting letters to her mother and daughter that were\nwritten as though she were in Paris, London, and Australia. The trips never materialized,\nand police found Cox's letters during the search of Robinson's Olathe residence 2 years\nlater.\n\n\n         Robinson's concealment of Trouten's disappearance was not limited to written\ncorrespondence. On February 25, 2000, Robinson sent Trouten an e-mail message\nrequesting login and password information for all of her e-mail accounts. Trouten\nprovided the information in a reply e-mail. Robinson also had e-mail addresses for a\nnumber of Trouten's friends and family members.\n\n\n         On the morning of March 2, 2000, the day after Trouten's disappearance,\nRemington received an e-mail from Trouten's Hotmail account. The body of the message\nsaid Trouten and her dogs had left on \"the adventure of a lifetime.\" Remington responded\na few minutes later, sharing that she had ended the relationship with her former BDS&M\n\"master.\" Remington received a reply from Trouten's Hotmail account, referring\nRemington to a new \"master\" at \"eruditemaster@email.com.\" Remington contacted this\nnew \"master\" and began communicating with a man she came to know as Jim Turner.\n\n\n         On March 24, 2000, an e-mail from Trouten's Hotmail account was sent to several\nmembers of Trouten's family, including her aunt, Chidester; her sister, Kim Padilla; her\nbrother, Michael Trouten; and her father's girlfriend. The message said Trouten had\n                                             28\n\fwritten to her mother, that she had left on her trip, that she would not have online access\nfor some time, and that she would try to stay in touch when possible. Chidester was\nconvinced Trouten did not write the e-mail because the word choices, style, and format\nwere inconsistent with Trouten's writing. Chidester was also convinced Trouten would\nhave called her, rather than sending an e-mail, before leaving on such a trip. When law\nenforcement officers searched Robinson's Olathe storage unit several weeks later, they\nfound the e-mail addresses for all four recipients attached to the contact list Trouten had\nprepared with Chidester before moving to Kansas.\n\n\n       On April 27, 2000, Robinson, posing as Jim Turner, discussed Trouten's\ndisappearance in an e-mail to Remington, claiming that Trouten had stolen his credit\ncards and that he had hired a private investigator to look into it. He also asked Remington\nfor information on all of Trouten's previous BDS&M partners. After consulting with law\nenforcement, Remington provided the requested information via e-mail. Law\nenforcement officers found a printed copy of this e-mail chain in Robinson's possession\nduring the search of his Olathe storage locker several weeks later.\n\n\n       Robinson used e-mail not only to conceal Trouten's disappearance, but also to lure\nTrouten's friends into new BDS&M relationships. In March 2000, Remington told Taylor\nshe had been communicating with Jim Turner, who she initially believed to be a friend of\nTrouten's employer, Robinson. Taylor jokingly told Remington to ask Jim Turner\nwhether he had any single friends interested in a BDS&M relationship. Remington did\njust that, and Robinson, posing as Turner, said Taylor should contact \"Tom\" at\n\"preipo@usa.net.\"\n\n\n       Remington forwarded the name and e-mail address to Taylor, and Taylor sent\n\"Tom\" an e-mail discussing her interest in BDS&M. When law enforcement officers\nsearched Robinson's Olathe residence, they found a note with the \"preipo@usa.net\" e-\n                                             29\n\fmail address written on it. On March 17, 2000, Robinson, posing as Tom, responded to\nTaylor's e-mail, describing himself as a \"very aggressive and hard working businessman\"\nand outlining his ground rules for a BDS&M relationship. Taylor and Robinson, posing\nas \"Tom,\" continued to communicate and discuss BDS&M topics via e-mail. Robinson\nalso began calling Taylor. In one voicemail message, he told her he was changing his\n\"preipo@usa.net\" e-mail address to \"bdsm@hotmail.com.\" \"Tom\" told Taylor that she\nwould be well taken care of if she were his slave.\n\n\n       On May 28, 2000, Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\" sent Taylor an e-mail from his new\n\"bdsm\" Hotmail account, asking her to visit him in Kansas City. Unlike his earlier e-\nmails, \"Tom\" signed this e-mail as \"MASTER\"—the same way this name/title appeared\nin Robinson's other e-mail communications, including Robinson's February 25 e-mail to\nTrouten and Jim Turner's April 27 e-mail to Remington.\n\n\n       Before committing to a visit, Taylor asked \"Tom\" for a reference from a past\nslave, and Robinson, still posing as \"Tom,\" told Taylor she could contact one of his\nformer slaves at \"slavedancer@hotmail.com.\" Taylor e-mailed \"slavedancer\" seeking\ninformation about \"Tom\" as a master. On May 31, Taylor received a response from the\n\"slavedancer\" account, in which \"Tom\" was referred to as \"MASTER\" throughout. When\nlaw enforcement officers searched Robinson's Olathe residence 2 days later, they found a\nlist of e-mail addresses and passwords, including \"slavedancer@hotmail.com,\" written on\na sheet of legal paper. They also found e-mails confirming Robinson's registration of the\n\"slavedancer\" name on several e-mail servers. Taylor received no further e-mail after\nRobinson's arrest on June 2.\n\n\n\n\n                                            30\n\f       2. Izabela Lewicka\n\n       Izabela Lewicka was born in Poland on April 11, 1978. She moved to West\nLafayette, Indiana, with her family at the age of 11. She began studies at Purdue\nUniversity in fall 1996. She was interested in the arts and was an avid drawer and painter.\nAccording to friends, Lewicka also had a strong interest in several alternative lifestyles,\nincluding paganism, goth, and BDS&M.\n\n\n       In spring 1997, Lewicka told her friend, Jennifer Hayes, that an international book\nagent in Kansas City had offered her a job doing secretarial work and had commissioned\nher to illustrate BDS&M manuscripts. Lewicka said she planned to move to the Kansas\nCity area to be with this older, married man, who had also agreed to train her to become a\n\"dominant\" in BDS&M relationships. Lewicka told Hayes he wanted her to call him\n\"master\" and to maintain strict confidentiality. Lewicka seemed concerned when she\ninadvertently told Hayes her master was named John.\n\n\n       While attending Purdue, Lewicka became friends with Dawn Carter and often\nused her computer to access the Internet. Lewicka told Carter she had a job opportunity in\nKansas City illustrating and editing books. Lewicka said that a man named John, whom\nshe had met online, had a job and apartment for her and that they had plans to travel.\n\n\n       Lewicka told her parents she had a summer internship with a publishing company\nin Kansas City, and if it led to a job, she might stay longer, but she did not rule out the\npossibility of returning to Purdue for the fall 1997 semester. Lewicka said she would be\nliving at 9280 Metcalf in Overland Park and could be reached by e-mail.\n\n\n       On June 8, 1997, Lewicka left for Kansas in her car filled with belongings.\nLewicka's friends believed she moved to Kansas both for BDS&M training and work.\n\n                                              31\n\f       Once in Kansas, Robinson helped Lewicka establish herself. They leased a private\nmailbox at Mailboxes, Etc., located at 9280 Metcalf in Overland Park—the same address\nLewicka had given her parents. Both Lewicka and Robinson were authorized to access\nmail at the box. In October 1997, Robinson had his insurance agent write a 2-year auto\npolicy on Lewicka's vehicle, explaining she was an employee.\n\n\n       On November 14, Lewicka opened an account at Bank of America, where\nRobinson also held a business account for Specialty Publications.\n\n\n       In February 1998, Robinson contacted Jennifer Boniedot, a property manager for\nthe Deerfield Apartment Complex in Olathe. Robinson said he needed a corporate\napartment for employees he would train before they were transferred to positions out of\nstate. In the rental application, Robinson identified himself and Lewicka as the\nprospective occupants. He told Boniedot that he met Lewicka at a graphics trade show,\nthat she had been abused by her parents, and that he had adopted her. Robinson signed a\n1-year rental agreement, from March 1, 1998, to February 28, 1999. Robinson paid rent\nwith a Specialty Publications' check, and Lewicka occupied the apartment through the\nterm of the lease.\n\n\n       In January 1999, just before the Deerfield Apartment lease expired, Robinson\ncontacted Julie Brown, a manager for A.J. Lang Property Management, to find an\napartment. Robinson said he was in the publication business and needed a corporate\napartment for female employees he trained from across the country. Robinson executed a\nlease for a different apartment in Olathe (Edgebrook Apartment) for a term beginning\nJanuary 15, 1999, through January 31, 2000. Lewicka occupied the Edgebrook\nApartment, and Robinson paid the rent.\n\n\n                                            32\n\f       While in Kansas, Lewicka worked for Specialty Publications, handling advertising\ngraphics for Robinson's magazine. In 1998, Robinson told his publishing broker, Karen\nScott, he had hired his adopted daughter, Lewicka, as a graphic designer. Lewicka told\nPam Sadewhite, who owned a graphic arts company that did work for Robinson, that\nRobinson was her uncle, but Sadewhite saw them flirting and touching one another in a\nmanner that suggested otherwise.\n\n\n       Lewicka often held herself out as Robinson's wife. Lewicka registered for an\nintroductory drafting class at Johnson County Community College under the name\nIzabela Lewicka-Robinson and told her instructor that she was married to an older man.\nShe also identified herself as Izabela Robinson to employees of several local businesses.\n\n\n       Though not married, Lewicka and Robinson did share a BDS&M sexual\nrelationship, as evidenced by a BDS&M \"slave\" contract signed by Lewicka, along with\nnumerous nude photographs depicting her in BDS&M poses, seized from Robinson's\nOlathe storage unit. Nancy Robinson learned of her husband's relationship with Lewicka\nin 1997. She believed the relationship was different from Robinson's other affairs. In the\npast, when Nancy had learned of an affair, Robinson had ended it immediately. This time,\nthe relationship continued, and Nancy thought Robinson would leave her for Lewicka.\n\n\n       However, Lewicka disappeared sometime in late summer or fall 1999. Earlier that\nsummer, Robinson convinced another paramour, Barbara Sandre, to move from Canada\nto Kansas. On August 18, they executed a lease for an unfurnished duplex at Hunter's\nPointe, located on Grant Street in Overland Park (Grant Street Duplex). Sandre needed\nfurnishings for the duplex, and Robinson agreed to provide them. On August 23,\nRobinson hired a moving company to deliver household items from Lewicka's Edgebrook\nApartment to Sandre's Grant Street Duplex. Over the next 2 weeks, Robinson brought\n\n\n                                            33\n\fadditional furnishings, including bedding and pillows, blankets, kitchen utensils, artwork,\nand hundreds of books. Many of these items were later identified as Lewicka's property.\n\n\n       Robinson had also rekindled his relationship with Aleisha Cox earlier in 1999.\nLater that year, Cox was unemployed and did not have permanent housing, so Robinson\ninvited her to stay at Lewicka's Edgebrook Apartment. Cox testified the apartment was\nmostly vacant, but there were some boxes containing clothing and household items.\nRobinson told Cox the girl that had been living there quit her job and ran off with her\nboyfriend, leaving the clothes behind. Cox took some of the clothing, which was later\nidentified as Lewicka's. Cox declined Robinson's offer to stay at the apartment.\n\n\n       In September 1999, with several months remaining on the lease, Robinson\ndelivered September's rent for Lewicka's Edgebrook Apartment and notified the property\nmanager, Brown, that he had vacated the premises. Brown later inspected the unit and\nfound it to be mostly unkempt but noticed the two bedrooms had been cleaned\nmeticulously.\n\n\n       Law enforcement officers searched Lewicka's Edgebrook Apartment on October\n12, 2000. Detective Sally Lane, a forensic chemist with the Johnson County Crime Lab\n(JOCO Lab), found hundreds of small, reddish-brown spots on the wall of one bedroom\nthat presumptively tested positive for blood. The blood spots were roughly circular and\nless than 1 millimeter in diameter. The pattern of stains ran from floor to ceiling and\napproximately 4 to 5 feet in width, from the middle of the south wall all the way to the\neast wall, with the highest concentration at waist to chest level. Lane took swabs from a\nrepresentative sampling of the spots and submitted them to the Kansas City, Missouri,\nRegional Crime Lab (KCMO Lab) for further analysis, where Detective Frank Booth, a\nDNA analysist, confirmed the genetic profile from the samples matched Lewicka's DNA.\n\n\n                                             34\n\f       Other circumstantial evidence corroborated Lewicka's disappearance in late\nsummer or early fall 1999 and Robinson's involvement. In September, Robinson called\nhis publishing broker, Scott, looking for a new graphic designer. Robinson told Scott that\nLewicka had been caught smoking marijuana and deported to Czechoslovakia. On\nSeptember 1, a $500 check payable to Specialty Publications was drawn on Lewicka's\naccount, leaving an available balance of $1. On September 3, the insurance policy\nRobinson placed on Lewicka's vehicle lapsed because of nonpayment of premium.\n\n\n       After fall 1999, Lewicka was never seen at the local establishments she\npatronized. During her time in Kansas, she shopped at A. Friendly's bookstore on 25 to\n30 occasions. Lewicka stood out to the owner, Robert Meyers, because of her European\naccent and interest in books about witch trials, horror, vampires, and medicinal plants.\nSometime before winter 1999, Lewicka came to A. Friendly's with a man Meyers\nbelieved to be Robinson. Lewicka told Meyers she was moving and Robinson would be\nbuying her books after her move. Lewicka shopped there one more time prior to winter\n1999, and Meyers never saw her again.\n\n\n       As with other victims, family members received suspicious correspondence after\nLewicka disappeared. Lewicka's father exchanged 25 to 30 e-mails with his daughter\nafter she moved to Kansas. Lewicka was spirited and fought with her parents for\nautonomy and control over her life. When Lewicka responded to the e-mails, her tone\nwas consistently abrasive and short, asking her father, \"What the hell do you want [?]\"\nand telling him to leave her alone. However, on April 14, 2000, Lewicka's father received\na different sort of e-mail from his daughter's account. The message said she and another\nperson had spent the last 2 weeks traveling the countryside in China. Unlike previous e-\nmails, the tone of this message was respectful and polite. The final series of e-mails\nLewicka's father received from his daughter's account said she was traveling to overseas\nlocations.\n                                             35\n\f       3. Lisa Stasi\n\n       Lisa Stasi, formerly Lisa Elledge, was 18 years old when she began dating Carl\nStasi sometime after June 1983. Lisa married Carl in August 1984. She was pregnant at\nthe time. On September 3, 1984, Lisa Stasi gave birth to her first child, Tiffany Lynn, at\nTruman Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri. After Tiffany's birth, Stasi's marriage\ncrumbled and Carl reenlisted in the Navy. He reported for duty at Great Lakes Naval\nBase, outside Chicago, Illinois, in early January 1985.\n\n\n       Around the time Stasi began dating Carl, Robinson was looking for a private\nadoption opportunity for his younger brother, Donald Robinson, and Donald's wife,\nHelen, who lived in the Chicago area. At a family reunion in 1983, Donald and Helen\ntold Robinson they were pursuing a private adoption. Robinson said he knew an adoption\nattorney, Doug Wood, and would handle the process for his younger brother. In fall 1984,\nRobinson told Donald and Helen a baby would be available in October. At Robinson's\ndirection, Donald sent him a $2,500 cashier's check payable to Robinson's business, Equi\nII, allegedly to cover adoption-related fees. Robinson later said the birth mother had\ndecided not to place the child for adoption.\n\n\n       In November 1984, Robinson contacted Karen Gaddis, a social worker at Truman\nMedical Center, and told her that he and several Johnson County businessmen had\ndeveloped a program to provide housing, transportation, daycare, and job training for\nyoung mothers and their babies. Robinson said he needed referrals of Caucasian women\nbecause the program already had African-American participants and needed racial\nbalance. Robinson was looking for a white woman in her teens or early 20s, who had a\nnewborn child, was struggling or disadvantaged, and had no family support or ties. In\nJanuary 1985, Robinson told Gaddis another organization, Hope House, had referred a\n\n                                               36\n\fyoung lady to his program, and he had placed her at a motel in Kansas. Lisa Stasi's aunt,\nKaren Moore, testified that she had contacted Hope House and took Stasi to the\norganization just before January 1, 1985.\n\n\n       Family members last saw Stasi and Tiffany in early January 1985. Carl Stasi's\nsister, Kathy Klingensmith, babysat Tiffany often. On January 8, Stasi dropped Tiffany\noff at Klingensmith's home and told her she had met a man named John Osborne, who\nwas going to help her get a job and finish her GED. Stasi said she might even get to travel\nas part of the job training program.\n\n\n       Stasi returned to Klingensmith's home to pick up Tiffany on January 9. When she\narrived, Stasi said John Osborne had paid for her to stay in a room at the Roadway Inn in\nOverland Park. At approximately 2 p.m., Stasi called the front desk at the Roadway Inn\nand gave the hotel receptionist Klingensmith's phone number in case Osborne called.\nOsborne called Klingensmith's number soon thereafter and got directions to her home.\nThe weather was treacherous because of a strong snowstorm, but Osborne arrived at\nKlingensmith's home at approximately 3 p.m. Stasi and Tiffany went with Osborne,\nleaving Stasi's car parked outside Klingensmith's home. Less than 1 hour later, Stasi\ncalled Klingensmith to tell her she had arrived safely at the motel. Klingensmith never\nsaw or heard from Stasi or Tiffany again. Stasi never returned for her car. Klingensmith\nidentified Robinson at trial as the man she knew as John Osborne.\n\n\n       Around 4:30 p.m., Stasi called her mother-in-law, Betty Stasi, in a panic, crying\nand hysterical. Stasi said \"they\" were claiming that Betty Stasi planned to take Tiffany\naway because Stasi was an unfit mother. Stasi's mother-in-law told her not to believe\nwhat \"they\" were saying because it was not true. Stasi said \"they\" wanted her to sign four\nblank sheets of paper. Betty Stasi told her not to sign anything. Stasi said \"here they\ncome,\" and she hung up.\n                                             37\n\f       Betty Stasi never spoke to or saw Stasi or Tiffany again. A few days later, Betty\nStasi received a letter purportedly written by Stasi. It was typewritten and signed \"Lisa\"\nat the bottom and said Stasi had left town to start a new life with Tiffany.\n\n\n       Nancy Robinson testified that in early January 1985, the day of the terrible\nsnowstorm, Robinson brought a baby to their home in Stanley. Robinson said that the\nbaby's name was Tiffany and that he received her through a private adoption for his\nbrother. Robinson called Donald and Helen and told them a baby was available\nimmediately. He said the birth mother had decided against adoption after delivery, but the\nfamily did not support her decision, so she left the baby at a shelter and committed\nsuicide.\n\n\n       Donald and Helen flew to Kansas City on January 10. Robinson picked them up at\nthe airport in the late afternoon and drove them to the offices of Equi II in Overland Park,\nwhere they signed legal paperwork, including a Petition for Adoption. After signing the\ndocuments, Donald gave Robinson a $3,000 cashier's check payable to Doug Wood,\nallegedly for further adoption expenses. Donald and Helen named the baby Heather\nTiffany Robinson. They returned to Chicago, along with the baby, the following day.\n\n\n       That same morning, Klingensmith called the Roadway Inn and learned Stasi's\nroom had been reserved under a name other than John Osborne. On January 11,\nKlingensmith filed a missing persons report with the Overland Park Police Department.\n\n\n       Robinson's name surfaced early in the investigation. On February 1, 1985,\nOverland Park detectives interviewed Robinson, who told them he was starting a\ncharitable organization to provide young mothers job training, food, and housing.\nRobinson admitted he had placed Stasi at the Roadway Inn as part of that program.\n                                             38\n\fHowever, he said Stasi had recently come to his office to give him the motel key.\nRobinson said Stasi thanked him for the assistance and said she had made other\narrangements. Robinson claimed that Stasi and Tiffany left with a young Caucasian male\nin an older model green car.\n\n\n       One week later, Robinson provided a similar story to his Missouri Parole and\nProbation Officer, Steve Haymes. Robinson told Haymes he had placed Stasi at the\nRoadway Inn, but on January 10, she and Tiffany came to his business with a man named\nBill and said they planned to start a new life together in Colorado.\n\n\n       To corroborate this story, Robinson paid Cora Holmes $800 in exchange for her\nfalse statement to police. At Robinson's direction, Holmes told Overland Park detectives\nthat she had recently babysat Tiffany and learned Stasi had left for Arkansas with a man\nnamed Bill Summers.\n\n       In July 1985, Donald and Helen received a package from Robinson containing\nfinal adoption paperwork, including a Petition for Adoption, Decree of Adoption, birth\ncertificate, and other documents. The Petition appeared to be signed by attorney Douglas\nWood, who had handled over 100 adoptions in his career. Wood testified that he did not\nprepare the document, that it deviated from his standard form, and that his signature had\nbeen forged. Wood confirmed that he had never represented Robinson or any member of\nhis family in any adoption proceeding nor received payment from Robinson for such\nlegal work.\n\n\n       The Decree appeared to contain the signature of attorney Ronald Wood, who had\nhandled only three adoptions in his 23-year career. Ronald Wood testified that he never\nsigned the Decree. He had represented Robinson in other matters, and Robinson had\naccess to other examples of Wood's signature. The Decree also appeared to be signed by\n\n                                             39\n\fJudge Michael H. Farley, but Judge Farley testified the decree was fraudulent and his\nsignature had been forged.\n\n\n       Both the Petition and Decree appeared to be notarized by Evi Gresham, who had\nbeen in a BDS&M relationship with Robinson in the early to mid-1980s, but Gresham\nhad never seen the documents, her name was misspelled, and she was never a notary\npublic. Robinson had directed Gresham to sign numerous blank papers during their\nrelationship. Neither the Petition nor the Decree was found in the district court clerk's\nofficial records.\n\n\n       After Robinson's arrest in 2000, Donald and Helen began to question the identity\nof Heather's birth mother. Law enforcement compared Heather's footprints to the known\nprints of Tiffany and found the prints matched, i.e., Heather Tiffany Robinson was\nTiffany, Stasi's biological daughter.\n\n\n       4. Beverly Bonner\n\n       Beverly Bonner lived in Cameron, Missouri, with her husband, Dr. William\nBonner, and their two sons. In 1992 and 1993, Bonner worked as a prison librarian at the\nWestern Missouri Correctional Center while Robinson was an inmate. William Bonner\nwas a prison physician who treated Robinson and other inmates.\n\n\n       In November 1993, Bonner filed for divorce. Toward the end of their marriage,\nBonner told her husband she was helping Robinson find property for a hydroponics\nproject. Bonner also said she planned to take a job with a company in Chicago.\n\n\n       Bonner was not seen by her family after her final divorce proceeding in February\n1994. Bonner's brother, Louell Heath, invited Bonner to his September 1995 wedding,\n\n                                             40\n\fbut she did not attend. Bonner's oldest son died in October 1995, but she did not attend\nhis funeral.\n\n\n       After Bonner's disappearance, Robinson stole her alimony payments. In December\n1993, Robinson, posing as Jim or James Turner, applied for a mailbox under Bonner's\nname at The Mail Room in Olathe. The owner, Colleen Davis, identified Robinson at trial\nas the person she knew as Turner. Robinson executed a lease for Box 182 under Bonner's\nname on January 1, 1994. Robinson presented Bonner's identification and told Davis he\nwas collecting Bonner's mail while she worked in Australia. Davis never met Bonner and\nonly saw Robinson access the mailbox.\n\n\n       William Bonner paid his ex-wife $1,000 in monthly alimony for 18 months. He\ntimely mailed each alimony payment to Bonner's private mailbox in Olathe. Every\nalimony check was deposited into Robinson's Hydro-Gro, Inc., business account at\nCommunity Bank of Raymore, an account opened on February 1, 1994, with James A.\nTurner and Beverly J. Bonner as the authorized signatories. Three latent prints lifted from\nthe original alimony checks matched Robinson's known prints.\n\n\n       Robinson attempted to conceal Bonner's disappearance with fraudulent\ncommunications to her family. In January 1994, Bonner's brother, Larry Heath, received\na handwritten letter purportedly from Bonner that said she was starting a new career with\nan international corporation in Chicago and that she would be traveling extensively, both\ndomestically and abroad. A few months later, Larry Heath received a typewritten letter\npurportedly from Bonner, which was unusual because Bonner had always written letters\nby hand. The letter said Bonner was working for \"Jim Redmond\" in the human resources\ndepartment of a large international corporation. Larry Heath continued to receive similar\ntypewritten letters every 3 to 4 months. Occasionally, he would respond, mailing\ncorrespondence to Bonner's private mailbox. During the same time period, Louell Heath\n                                            41\n\freceived roughly half a dozen letters, which arrived in envelopes postmarked Australia,\nFrance, the Netherlands, and Kansas City, Missouri. The letters were typewritten, often\ndiscussed Bonner's travel overseas, and were signed in what Bonner's brothers believed to\nbe her handwriting.\n\n\n       In early 1997 the letters ceased. Bonner's family grew concerned and contacted\nauthorities to report her disappearance. Detective Frank Booth examined nine of the\nenvelopes mailed to Larry Heath. Eight of the envelopes had sufficient amylase to create\na full DNA profile, and each profile matched Robinson's known DNA.\n\n\n       5. Sheila Faith and Debbie Faith\n\n       Sheila Faith married John Faith, and the couple had a baby girl named Debbie\nLynn on October 17, 1978. Debbie was born with a number of birth defects, including\ncerebral palsy, which limited her ability to walk and control her bladder, forcing her to\nwear adult diapers later in life. Sheila's husband passed away in 1993, and Sheila moved\nwith Debbie from California to Pueblo, Colorado, to be closer to her friend, Nancy\nGuerrero. Sheila and Debbie lived on Social Security and struggled financially.\n\n\n       According to Guerrero, Sheila was lonely and responded to personal ads in hopes\nof meeting a companion. On several occasions, Sheila talked to Guerrero about her\ninterest in BDS&M but did not share details because Guerrero was uncomfortable with\nthe subject. Sheila's sister also believed she was interested in BDS&M.\n\n\n       In spring 1994, Sheila told Guerrero she had met a man named \"John\" from\nMissouri. Sheila said \"John\" was a wealthy executive who promised to take her on a\ncruise and put Debbie in private school. Sheila told her sister, Cathy Norman, that she\nhad met a man with a good job, that they planned to travel together, and that he planned\n\n                                             42\n\fto buy Debbie a new wheelchair and accessible van. Norman said Shelia called him \"Jim\nTurner\" either in a letter or during their last telephone conversation.\n\n\n       Sheila told Guerrero that she and Debbie were going to visit John. They planned to\nbe gone for about a month, spending a couple weeks with John in Missouri and then\ntraveling to Texas to visit family. Guerrero expected Sheila to return within a few weeks\nbecause they had purchased tickets to the Colorado state fair, and Sheila planned to enter\na cross-stitched angel into the fair competition. While Sheila packed, Guerrero noticed\nshe did not take furniture, bedding, or other items one would need for an indefinite stay\nelsewhere.\n\n\n       Neither Guerrero nor Sheila's sisters saw or spoke to Sheila or Debbie again after\nthey left Colorado to visit Robinson. Additionally, in 1995, Robinson gave one of his\nparamours, Sandra Shields, a cross-stitched angel as a gift. Guerrero identified the item as\nthe piece Sheila Faith had made to enter into the state fair competition.\n\n\n       After Sheila and Debbie left, Sheila's sisters received letters purportedly written by\nSheila. In December 1994, Norman received a typewritten letter purportedly from Sheila\nin an envelope postmarked Canada. The letter said Sheila had met a wonderful man\nnamed Jim. Norman was convinced the letter was a fraud because Sheila always wrote\nletters by hand and Sheila's signature appeared to be forged. Norman received another\nletter the following December. Again, she was convinced Sheila did not write it because\nof the typewritten format and the nature of the signature. Sheila's other sister, Michelle\nFox, also received a letter in an envelope postmarked outside the country. Fox\nimmediately suspected it was fraudulent because of the typed format, style, and unusual\nsignatures.\n\n\n\n\n                                             43\n\f       For years following their disappearance, Robinson stole Sheila's and Debbie's\nsocial security benefit payments. In June 1994, just months after setting up a private\nmailbox under Bonner's name, Robinson, posing as James Turner, set up another private\nmailbox at the Mail Room—this time under the names Sheila and Debbie Faith. The\nowner saw Robinson come to the mailbox at least once a month to collect two\ngovernment checks mailed to Sheila and Debbie Faith.\n\n\n       While the Faiths were living in Colorado, the Social Security Administration\n(SSA) had mailed Sheila's and Debbie's benefit checks to a Pueblo, Colorado, address.\nFor the first half of 1994, these checks were often deposited into an account held at\nColorado National Bank. In June 1994, SSA received notice that Sheila's and Debbie's\nmailing address had changed to the private mailbox in Olathe. SSA began mailing benefit\nchecks to this new address the following month.\n\n\n       From July 1994 to September 1995, the checks were deposited into Robinson's\nHydro-Gro, Inc., business account at Community Bank of Raymore—the same account\nRobinson used to deposit Bonner's alimony checks. In fall 1995, Community Bank of\nRaymore notified Robinson, a/k/a James Turner, that Social Security checks could not be\ndeposited into a business account. Thereafter, Robinson deposited the checks into his\nSpecialty Publications' accounts at other financial institutions.\n\n\n       Robinson also employed fraud and deceit to ensure Debbie's disability benefits\nwould continue. In August 1994, SSA received a completed disability review form for\nDebbie, purportedly signed by Sheila Faith. Attached to the disability form was a medical\nreport confirming Debbie's ongoing physical impairment. The report appeared to be\nsigned by Dr. William Bonner, but he testified that he had never treated Debbie Faith,\nhad not prepared the report, and had never had an office at the address identified in the\ndocument.\n                                             44\n\f       On June 7, 2000, law enforcement searched box 215 at The Mail Room and seized\nenvelopes containing the June 2000 SSA benefit checks for Sheila and Debbie Faith. Lyla\nThompson, a deputy with the JOCO Lab, developed several latent fingerprints from the\nother SSA checks that matched Robinson's known prints.\n\n\n       6. Vickie Neufeld\n\n       Vickie Neufeld lived in Texas. She lost her job as a geriatric therapist in March\n2000, and her financial situation was dire. Neufeld placed personal ads on BDS&M\nwebsites and began e-mailing Robinson. Neufeld and Robinson discussed a potential\nBDS&M relationship, and he sent her a slave contract to review.\n\n\n       On April 23, 2000, Robinson asked Neufeld to visit him in Kansas. Robinson said\nhe was a wealthy businessman with a history of helping other professional women get\nestablished in the area. He promised to support her and said they possibly could pursue a\nrelationship.\n\n\n       Robinson arranged for Neufeld to stay at Extended Stay America in Overland\nPark. She arrived on April 23, 2000. As Robinson had requested, she brought her own\nsex toys along for the trip. Robinson and Neufeld engaged in sexual activity at various\ntimes during her stay. On the morning of April 26, Robinson told Neufeld he was leaving\nfor a business trip in Israel and wanted to discuss a plan for her to move to Kansas.\nRobinson said his business would pay movers to bring her belongings to Kansas that\nweekend. Robinson asked Neufeld to leave her sex toys with him, explaining it would\ngive her extra incentive to return. Neufeld left behind her rattan-type canes and a mesh\nbag full of sex toys, which she valued at $700.\n\n\n\n                                            45\n\f       Neufeld returned to Texas, but the movers never arrived. On May 22, 2000,\nNeufeld asked Robinson to return her sex toys, but he did not comply. Neufeld filed a\npolice report, and law enforcement found Neufeld's sex toys several days later during the\nsearch of Robinson's Olathe storage locker.\n\n\nThe Investigation\n\n       On March 25, 2000, the Overland Park Police Department took a missing person's\nreport regarding Trouten and transferred it to the Lenexa Police Department, which had\njurisdiction. Lenexa police created a multijurisdictional task force that quickly focused its\ninvestigation on Robinson's activities. They employed numerous investigative\ntechniques, including surveillance, trash hits, consent searches, pen registers, wiretaps,\nand search warrants, leading to Robinson's arrest on June 2, 2000.\n\n\n       On March 29 and 30, 2000, Deputy Daniel Rundle, a forensic chemist with the\nJOCO Lab, searched Trouten's room at the Guesthouse Suites in Lenexa. Although\nRundle found several small bloodstains in the room, he admitted the search produced\nnothing of evidentiary value.\n\n\n       On March 31, 2000, the Lenexa Police Department began searching trash left at\nthe curbside for collection at Robinson's Olathe residence. On April 4, officers found an\ninvoice for a package Robinson sent to Glines in California—the woman who mailed\nletters postmarked from San Jose, California, at Robinson's request. On April 25,\ninvestigators used a Deffenbaugh trash truck with the company's permission and\ncollected three bags of Robinson's trash. They recovered a telephone bill for service at\nRobinson's Linn County property, which documented a long-distance call placed from\nRobinson's trailer on the morning of Trouten's disappearance.\n\n\n\n                                              46\n\f       On May 22, 2000, law enforcement secured a court-ordered wiretap on Robinson's\ncell phone. Law enforcement later intercepted a call from Robinson to Remington's\nphone, which was answered by her minor son. During that call, Robinson identified\nhimself as \"Jim.\" Later that afternoon, law enforcement intercepted another telephone call\nfrom Robinson, posing as Jim Turner, to Remington. During this call, he said Trouten\nhad stolen his credit cards and withdrawn money from his accounts, and that his private\ninvestigator had learned Trouten was in Mexico. He also said Carolyn Trouten had called\none of his friends, inquiring about her daughter's whereabouts.\n\n\n       On the morning of June 2, 2000, law enforcement secured a warrant to search\nRobinson's Olathe residence and his Olathe storage unit. Robinson was arrested that\nmorning just before officers executed the search warrants.\n\n\n       During the search of Robinson's residence, law enforcement officers seized a\nnumber of incriminating items, including books on creating false identities; a Home\nDepot credit card bearing the name \"James A. Turner\"; IRS Form 1099 statements for\nSheila and Debbie Faith; Roadway Inn receipts with \"Lisa Stasi\" written on them,\nreflecting payment for lodging in January 1985; an IRS form signed by \"Beverly J.\nBonner\"; documents identifying \"James Turner\" and \"John Robinson\" as affiliated with\nEquity Financial Group and Hydro-Gro, Inc.; papers and handwritten notes with e-mail\naddresses associated with the victims and their families; and e-mail communications\nbetween Trouten and Robinson.\n\n\n       During the search of Robinson's Olathe storage unit, law enforcement officers\nseized several items relevant to the disappearances of Trouten, Lewicka, and Sheila and\nDebbie Faith. First, several items were immediately identifiable as Trouten's, including\nher Social Security card, Michigan driver's license, birth certificate, high school diploma,\nSam's Club membership card, American Red Cross certification card, passport\n                                             47\n\fapplication, and prescription medication. Law enforcement officers also found numerous\npersonal items that family members identified as Trouten's property, including her\njewelry boxes, jewelry, collectible items, nursing textbooks, and a journal with the name\n\"Suzette\" inside. A number of items also evidenced Trouten's BDS&M relationship with\nRobinson, including a slave contract, a sex tape, nude photographs, and e-mails.\n\n\n       Several items were also immediately identifiable as Lewicka's, including her\nPolish passport, Kansas driver's license, Social Security card, resident alien card, Olathe\nPublic Library card, high school diploma, Indiana vehicle registration, and a document\nappointing Robinson as her power of attorney. Law enforcement officers also found\nseveral personal items that family members later identified as Lewicka's.\n\n\n       Additionally, law enforcement officers seized 1998 IRS Form 1099 statements for\nSheila and Debbie Faith, along with photocopies of their SSA benefit checks for\nSeptember 1997. Finally, police found a slave contract Neufeld had signed, along with\nher sex toys.\n\n\n       On the morning of June 3, 2000, law enforcement officers secured a warrant from\nJohnson County District Judge Larry McClain to search Robinson's Linn County\nproperty. The search began that morning and continued for roughly 1 full week.\n\n\n       Around 1 p.m. on June 3, Johnson County Sheriff's Detective Herald Hughes\nlearned a cadaver dog alerted on two yellow, metal barrels on the property. The barrels\nwere located out in the open, just to the south of a wooden shed located several yards to\nthe southwest of the trailer on the property. Hughes opened the barrels and confirmed\neach contained the remains of a human body.\n\n\n\n\n                                             48\n\f       The barrels were transported to the Shawnee County morgue, where Shawnee\nCounty Deputy Coroner Donald Pojman conducted autopsies on June 4. The body\nremoved from the first barrel was that of Trouten. It was mildly decomposed, unclothed,\nand lying in a fetal position inside the barrel. There was a soft, nylon rope tied around the\nhead with a piece of cloth underneath covering the nose and mouth, which Pojman\nbelieved to be a blindfold that had slipped below the eyes. There were two visible\ninjuries: a tear to the skin near the left armpit inflicted postmortem and an oval-shaped\ndefect on the left side of the head, which Pojman believed to be lethal. Pojman concluded\nthe cause of death was a blow to the left side of the head with a hard object. Forensic\nodontologist Daniel Winter confirmed Trouten's identity with her known dental records.\n\n\n       Pojman then conducted the autopsy of the body in the second barrel, later\nidentified as Lewicka. The body was moderately decomposed, lying in a fetal position,\npartially covered with a pillow, and clothed with a short-sleeve nightshirt. Inside the\nbarrel, Pojman saw three pieces of gray or silver duct tape. He observed two blunt-force\ninjuries to the skull, either of which could have been lethal. He noted the injuries were\nsimilar to Trouten's. Winter confirmed Lewicka's identity with her known dental records.\n\n\n       Back in Linn County, deputies from the JOCO Lab discovered a variety of\nincriminating trace evidence inside Robinson's trailer. First, Deputy Allen Hamm found a\npaper towel inside the kitchen sink with a reddish-brown stain that presumptively tested\npositive for blood. Detective Booth, KCMO Lab, determined the genetic profile from the\nblood on the paper towel matched Trouten's DNA profile. Booth testified that this genetic\nprofile occurs in only 1 in 6 billion people.\n\n\n       Booth also found eight hair strands on the paper towel. Booth compared them to\nknown samples from Trouten and Robinson and opined that they were common to\nTrouten and not Robinson. Booth admitted that, unlike DNA testing, comparative hair\n                                                49\n\fanalysis cannot yield a positive identification. However, he explained the methodology is\nstill useful in excluding individuals or including them among a group of people that share\nsimilar hair characteristics. Additionally, Booth obtained a root from one of the hair\nsamples and successfully acquired a genetic profile that produced a match to Trouten.\n\n\n       Hamm found reddish-brown stains on wallboard in the kitchen that presumptively\ntested positive for blood. Booth confirmed that the genetic profile from the wallboard\nstains matched Trouten's DNA. Booth also found two hairs in the samples, both of which\nwere common to Trouten and not Robinson. Hamm also collected swabs of a stain on a\nlong piece of trim board in the kitchen area of the trailer. Booth found two hairs and two\nfragments in these swabs that were common to Trouten and not Robinson.\n\n\n       Johnson County Sheriff's Deputy Andrew Guzman found a roll of duct tape inside\na green plastic trash container in the south bedroom. The tape appeared to be similar to\nthe strands of duct tape found inside the barrel containing Lewicka's body. Investigators\nsaw a reddish-brown stain on the roll of duct tape, and Booth's subsequent testing\nconfirmed the genetic profile produced a match to Lewicka's DNA. Deputy Thompson\nlifted one latent print from the roll of duct tape that did not match Robinson's known\nprints. Thompson compared the print to several crime scene investigators' known prints\nbut found no match. Due to the state of decomposition of Lewicka's body, Thompson was\nunable to compare the print to Lewicka's. Thompson saw what appeared to be another\npartial print with some ridge detail on the roll of duct tape, but it was too incomplete to\nbe of value.\n\n\n       In addition to trace evidence, law enforcement officers seized a number of\nTrouten's belongings from inside Robinson's trailer. In the living room area, Guzman\nfound a box with an \"EZ Set\" label on it and a box with a \"Big Boy\" label on it that\ncontained glassware, oil lamps, figurines, and other collectable items. Carolyn Trouten\n                                             50\n\fconfirmed that many of these items belonged to Suzette Trouten. Thompson developed a\nnumber of latent prints from items in the EZ Set box that matched Robinson's known\nprints.\n\n\n          On June 5, 2000, law enforcement officers executed a warrant to search a\nRaymore, Missouri, storage unit, rented by Robinson. In December 1993, Robinson had\nrented unit F-10 at Stor-Mor For Less in Raymore. He leased the unit under Beverly\nBonner's name, claiming that Bonner was his sister and that he was storing her\nbelongings while she worked in Australia. The leasing agent recalled Robinson saying\nBonner worked for an agricultural company with \"Hydro\" in its name. Robinson leased\nthis unit through the summer of 1996. In January 1994, Robinson leased a second unit, E-\n2, under Bonner's name and maintained that lease through the date of his arrest.\n\n\n          Law enforcement officers began searching unit E-2, and within 10 minutes, they\nsmelled a foul odor that they associated with a decomposing body.\n\n\n          In the back of the locker, officers saw three barrels. The first was black and sealed\nwith a gray lid. They opened the top and discovered a body inside. The two other barrels\nwere located in front of the black barrel. They were covered with a large plastic sheet,\nand cat litter had been sprinkled around the outside of the barrels inside the plastic. Some\nof the litter appeared to have absorbed a dark fluid. The barrels were wrapped together\nwith two additional pieces of plastic sheeting held up with pieces of duct tape. Thompson\nexamined the plastic sheeting and duct tape and developed four latent prints of value.\nThree of the latent prints matched Robinson's known prints, and one was not identified.\nThe officers did not open the second and third barrels but suspected they too contained\nhuman remains.\n\n\n\n\n                                                51\n\f       All three barrels were transported to the Jackson County Medical Examiner\nThomas Young. Young conducted an autopsy on the body inside the first barrel, later\nidentified as Beverly J. Bonner. The body was curled up inside the barrel and fully\ndressed for cold weather. Young believed the body had been stored for a long period of\ntime because most external features were blurred and the internal organs were hard to\ndistinguish. The body had substantial trauma to the head caused by multiple blows from a\nblunt object with a rounded surface, consistent with a hammer. Young opined that any\nnumber of these blows could have resulted in death. On June 7, 2000, forensic\nodontologist Ronald Grier confirmed the victim was Bonner.\n\n\n       Next, Young conducted an autopsy on the body contained one of the two barrels\nwrapped in plastic, later identified as Sheila Faith. The body was an adult female, fully\nclothed. Young believed the state of decomposition was consistent with the death having\noccurred 5 to 6 years prior but admitted no precise date of death could be determined.\nThe body had multiple injuries to the head caused by blunt-force trauma consistent with\ninfliction by a hammer. Young opined that any number of these blows could have been\nfatal. Young also observed a fracture of the right forearm, specifically the right ulna,\nwhich he testified to be consistent with a defensive wound. Grier confirmed the victim\nwas Sheila Faith.\n\n\n       Finally, Young conducted the autopsy on the body found inside the third barrel,\nlater identified as Debbie Faith. The body was fully clothed, and the subject was wearing\nan adult disposable diaper. Young believed the victim was a teenager because x-rays\nrevealed that several growth discs had not closed. Again, Young testified that the state of\ndecomposition was consistent with the death having occurred 5 to 6 years prior but\nadmitted no precise date could be determined. The victim had sustained at least three\nblows to the head, each of which could have been fatal, inflicted by a blunt object with a\n\n\n                                             52\n\frounded surface, consistent with a hammer. Using known dental x-rays, Young opined\nthe victim was Debbie Faith.\n\n\n       Lisa Stasi's body has never been found.\n\n\n       On June 9, law enforcement officers searched the Grant Street Duplex with\nSandre's consent. They seized a number of items belonging to Lewicka, including two\nsets of bedding, an antique Polish coffee grinder, a Hungarian espresso machine, and a\nblack journal with handwriting and sketches. Investigators noticed one of the sets of\nbedding matched the pattern on the pillowcase found inside the barrel containing\nLewicka's body. The bedding also matched the pattern depicted in nude photographs of\nLewicka found in Robinson's Olathe storage unit.\n\n\n       Hanging on the wall of the duplex was a framed oil painting with the signature\n\"John '92\" and the initials \"JR\" at the top. There were also two pencil drawings displayed\nin the spare bedroom signed \"John 2000\" and the initials \"JR\" underneath. Lewicka's\nfriend Carter, who had cataloged Lewicka's artwork and was familiar with her paintings\nand drawings, recognized the framed painting as Lewicka's artwork. Lewicka's friend\nHayes also identified the pencil drawings as Lewicka's work.\n\n\n       Law enforcement officers seized several books purchased from A. Friendly's,\nwhere Lewicka was a frequent patron. The owner, Meyers, specifically recalled selling\ntwo of the books to Lewicka.\n\n\nThe Trial\n\n       On June 2, 2000, the State filed its Complaint against Robinson, charging him\nwith two counts of aggravated sexual battery and one count of theft. The State amended\n\n                                            53\n\fits Complaint on June 13, adding one count of aggravated kidnapping and two counts of\ncapital murder. The State filed its Second Amended Complaint on July 28, adding one\ncharge of premeditated first-degree murder and one charge of aggravated interference\nwith parental custody. On August 31, 2000, the State filed its Third Amended Complaint,\nsupplementing allegations in the existing counts.\n\n\n      At preliminary hearing, the State put on evidence supporting the eight counts in\nthe Third Amended Complaint. District Judge John Anderson III found probable cause\nlacking and dismissed Count IV, aggravated sexual battery of J.M. Judge Anderson\nrenumbered the remaining seven counts, which were tried to the jury.\n\n\n      Jury selection began on September 16, 2002. Judge Anderson empanelled the jury\non October 4, and trial commenced on October 7. At the close of the State's evidence,\nJudge Anderson granted defendant's motion for directed verdict on Count IV, aggravated\nsexual battery of Vicki Neufeld. On October 25, 2002, the defense rested. That same day,\nthe State filed a Fourth Amended Complaint charging Robinson only with the counts\nfrom the Third Amended Complaint that survived Robinson's motion for directed verdict.\n\n\n      The following six counts were submitted to the jury on October 28, 2002: Count\nI, aggravated kidnapping of Suzette Trouten; Count II, capital murder of Suzette Trouten;\nCount III, capital murder of Izabela Lewicka; Count IV, felony theft of Vicki Neufeld's\nproperty; Count V, premeditated first-degree murder of Lisa Stasi; and Count VI,\naggravated interference with Lisa Stasi's parental custody. On October 29, 2002, the jury\nreturned a unanimous verdict convicting Robinson on all counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                            54\n\f                            PRETRIAL AND GUILT PHASE ISSUES\n\n                                           1. VENUE\n\n\n       Robinson argues pretrial publicity was so pervasive and prejudicial in Johnson\nCounty that it resulted in actual prejudice to his right to trial by a fair and impartial jury\nin violation of his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\nConstitution. He also claims Judge Anderson abused his discretion by refusing to transfer\nvenue to another county pursuant to K.S.A. 22-2616(1).\n\n\nAdditional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       1. First Motion for Venue Change\n\n       Robinson first moved for a change of venue on January 17, 2002. At the January\n30, 2002, evidentiary hearing, defendant presented testimony from venue experts, along\nwith the results of a venue study prepared by Lisa Dahl of Litigation Consultants, Inc.\n\n\n       The study was based on three telephone surveys: one of 400 Johnson County\nresidents, one of 200 Harvey County residents, and one of 200 Ellis County residents.\nDahl selected Johnson County, which had a population of 464,083 at the time, because it\nwas the venue of origin. She selected Harvey County, which had a population of 35,737,\nas one of the control groups because its county seat, Newton, was a bedroom community\nto Wichita, much like Olathe was a bedroom community to Kansas City. She selected\nEllis County, which had a population of 28,731, as another control group because it was\ngeographically removed from the venue of origin and other metropolitan areas, yet its\ndemographic makeup and crime rates were comparable to Johnson County. Dahl testified\nthe number of respondents in each county was statistically sufficient to extrapolate results\n\n\n                                               55\n\fto the general population within a 5 percent margin of error in Johnson County and 7 to 8\npercent margin in the control counties.\n\n       The surveys' results showed 94 percent of the respondents in Johnson County were\naware of this case, compared to 80 percent in Harvey County and 64 percent in Ellis\nCounty. Further, 67 percent of those surveyed in Johnson County held an overall opinion\nthat the defendant was \"definitely guilty\" or \"probably guilty.\" In contrast, 50.5 percent\nof the Harvey County respondents and 35.5 percent of the Ellis County respondents held\nsimilar opinions. As to respondents' views of the strength of the evidence of defendant's\nguilt, 72.3 percent of the Johnson County respondents believed it to be \"overwhelming\"\nor \"strong.\" Half of the respondents in Harvey County and only 35.5 percent of\nrespondents in Ellis County believed likewise. Also, 68 percent of Johnson County\nrespondents had knowledge of case facts beyond those presented in the survey, compared\nto only 23 percent in Harvey County and 27.3 percent in Ellis County.\n\n\n       Dahl testified that the surveys' results were generally statistically significant.\nHowever, in the three counties surveyed, there was no statistically reliable difference in\nsentencing opinions among respondents who recalled the case.\n\n\n       Dahl admitted she was not interested in exploring whether respondents could set\naside preconceived opinions and serve as impartial jurors. In fact, none of the 38\nquestions in the surveys explored respondents' ability to assess the case impartially.\n\n\n       Robinson also called Ronald Dillehay, a professor of psychology at the University\nof Nevada-Reno with expertise in the design and analysis of venue studies and jury\nselection procedures. Dillehay testified that the design of Dahl's venue surveys was\nscientifically valid and conformed to generally accepted practices in the field. Dillehay\nalso testified that the absence of questions exploring respondents' ability to serve as\n\n                                              56\n\fimpartial jurors did not invalidate the venue study. In support, he cited studies in the\nfields of psychology and social science that suggest humans struggle to set aside\npreconceived opinions but will confirm their ability to do so when asked. Thus, Dillehay\nsaid such questions produce a lack of response variance sought in reliable questionnaires.\n\n\n       Dillehay acknowledged the survey data showed a very high level of awareness and\nprejudgment of the case in Johnson County and then discussed possible options to\ncounteract such prejudice, including: (1) change of venue; (2) importing jurors from\noutside Johnson County; (3) delay; (4) enhanced voir dire; (5) additional peremptory\nchallenges; and (6) judicial instructions.\n\n\n       Dillehay believed delay and judicial instructions would be ineffective due to the\nhigh levels of awareness and prejudgment. As to the option of enhanced voir dire,\nDillehay explained that the court could overcome juror minimization, which he described\nas a tendency on the part of jurors during voir dire to downplay what they learned from\nthe media coverage and the impact it had on their prejudgment and/or impartiality, by\nallowing attorneys to ask prospective jurors extensive, probing voir dire questions.\nDillehay explained that enhanced voir dire would require participation of attorneys, lots\nof questions, and small groups consisting of no more than four to six people, facilitating\nan environment where prospective jurors would be forthcoming. While effective,\nDillehay believed enhanced voir dire would be too onerous from a logistical or\nadministrative perspective, describing it as \"very laborious and very time-consuming.\"\n\n\n       On the second day of the evidentiary hearing, continued to March 6, 2002, the\ndefense played 2 hours of televised news coverage of the case broadcast within the first 2\nweeks of the discovery of bodies on Robinson's Linn County property in June 2000. In\nthe motion, defendant had also submitted articles about the case published by the Kansas\nCity Star from June 6, 2000, to July 27, 2001. During this time period, the Kansas City\n                                             57\n\fStar published 72 stories. More than half of them were published in the same month the\nstory broke. Coverage gradually dissipated and was nearly nonexistent at the end of 2000\nand early 2001. Thereafter, the majority of the coverage shifted from reports about\nRobinson and the crimes to trial coverage.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson denied the motion in a March 12, 2002, order, explaining:\n\n\n       \"Despite the extraordinary amount of attention this case has received from the public and\n       in the press thus far, the Court is not convinced that the defendant cannot obtain a fair\n       trial. Johnson County is a large county with a sophisticated pool of potential jurors. The\n       Court is confident that appropriate voir dire and jury selection methods will result in a\n       fair and impartial jury that will decide the case on the evidence presented in court and on\n       its merits. The presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial are of the utmost\n       importance to the rule of law in this country. The system simply does not function\n       without it. If it becomes apparent during voir dire that an impartial jury cannot be found,\n       the Court will not be reluctant to order a change of venue.\"\n\n\n       2. Renewed Motion for Venue Change after Voir Dire\n\n       On October 3, 2002, after completing voir dire, Robinson filed \"Defendant's\nRenewed Motion for Change of Venue, or, in the Alternative, to Discharge the Jury\nPanel,\" arguing that voir dire had proven inadequate to overcome community bias.\n\n\n       At the outset of jury selection, roughly 1,200 Johnson County residents were\nissued summonses and ordered to appear in four groups of 300, but the district judge later\nreleased the final two panels. Veniremembers completed a juror questionnaire\n(questionnaire) prepared by the parties, eliciting their views on pretrial publicity, the\ndeath penalty, and other case-specific facts and issues.\n\n\n\n                                                    58\n\f       With the agreement of the parties, the trial court conducted jury selection in four\nphases. In the first phase, Judge Anderson called prospective jurors in groups of 60 to\nexplore and rule on hardship challenges.\n\n\n       In the second phase, Judge Anderson assigned jurors to six-member panels to\nconduct small group voir dire on pretrial publicity and death penalty topics. After the\nparties completed voir dire of each panel, the district judge ruled on challenges for cause.\nFrom September 18 to October 1, 2002, the parties examined 43 panels made up of 259\nveniremembers. Nearly all had some knowledge of the case. Judge Anderson passed only\n83 of the 259 panelists to the third phase of jury selection.\n\n\n       A majority of these disqualified panelists, 167 of 259 (64 percent), were excused\nfor cause based on preconceived opinions of the case, firm death penalty opinions (both\nfor and against), or both. Specifically, 74 of the 259 panelists (28.5 percent) were excused\nbased solely on firm opinions due to exposure to pretrial publicity, 72 panelists (27.7\npercent) were excused based solely on firm opinions regarding the death penalty, and 21\nadditional panelists (8.1 percent) were excused on both pretrial publicity and death\npenalty grounds. In total, 95 of the 259 panelists were excused, in whole or part, due to\nbias related to pretrial publicity and 93 panelists were excused, in whole or part, based on\ntheir disqualifying death penalty opinions. Judge Anderson liberally excused panelists\nholding preconceived opinions, granting 92 of the 100 challenges defendant asserted on\nthis basis.\n\n\n       Nine of the 259 panelists (3.4 percent) were excused because of previously\nundisclosed hardships or grounds unrelated to pretrial publicity or the death penalty.\n\n\n       Of the 83 panelists passed to general voir dire, 52 were passed without any\nchallenge for cause asserted by either party. The 31 other panelists were passed over the\n                                              59\n\fobjection of one of the parties—4 from the State and 27 from defendant. However,\nRobinson challenged 19 of these 27 based on death penalty views and 8 on grounds\nrelated to bias arising from exposure to media coverage.\n\n\n       During general voir dire, Judge Anderson passed 65 of the 83 panelists, excusing\n18 on grounds unrelated to pretrial publicity. However, the district judge needed only 51\npanelists to seat a jury of 12 with 5 alternates. The parties agreed to release the 14 jurors\nwith the highest assigned juror numbers. Juror 440, whom Robinson had previously\nchallenged unsuccessfully on pretrial publicity grounds, was 1 of the 14 panelists\nreleased. This left only 7 prospective jurors on the final panel that defendant had\nchallenged unsuccessfully on grounds of bias arising from exposure to pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       In the final phase of jury selection, the parties exercised peremptory challenges.\nAmong those jurors seated, 11 of 12 were passed by the parties without any objection\nbased on preconceived opinions of guilt, and all jurors confirmed their ability to serve\nimpartially. Defendant had challenged only one of the seated jurors, Juror 39, on grounds\nof bias related to pretrial publicity. Eight of the 12 jurors were passed for cause without\nchallenge from either party (Jurors 87, 92, 131, 147, 214, 246, 302, and 309).\n\n\n       At the start of the eighth day of trial, Juror 214 was excused because of an\nemergency medical hardship in her family and was replaced by Alternate Juror 340. The\nparties had passed Juror 340 without challenge.\n\n\n       While every seated juror was familiar with the case, most had limited exposure to\nthe media's coverage. All but two members of the jury characterized their exposure to\npretrial publicity as minimal, passing, or light; and several members said they saw\ncoverage when the story first broke 2 years earlier and their recollection of the reported\nfacts had diminished over time.\n                                              60\n\f       After hearing argument on the renewed motion for venue change on October 4,\n2002, the trial judge denied the motion, finding the jury selection process had yielded a\nfair and impartial jury.\n\n       3. Second Renewed Motion for Venue Change\n\n       On October 7, 2002, just before opening statements, defendant renewed his motion\nto change venue for a second time. Defense counsel explained that earlier that morning,\nhe entered Judge Anderson's chambers and noticed a copy of that morning's Olathe Daily\nNews sitting in the reception area. The front page of the newspaper contained Robinson's\nphotograph, and the newspaper's banner headline read \"Robinson to face his jury\" and the\nsubheading read \"Defense says trial should be moved.\" Defense counsel explained that\nwhen he emerged from chambers, the jury walked past him, coming within 2 feet of the\npaper, which was face up on the reception counter. The defense believed jurors could\nhave seen the headlines, warranting a venue change.\n\n\n       The trial court denied the second renewed motion for venue change, finding that\nhe had \"no idea\" whether any jurors saw the newspaper, but even if they did, there was no\nprejudice in light of the content and given the media's extensive reporting on defendant's\nmotion to change venue earlier that spring.\n\n\n       4. Third Renewed Motion for Venue Change\n\n       Defendant renewed his motion to change venue for a third time on October 9,\n2002, explaining that a local radio personality had been giving away T-shirts outside the\ncourthouse as a publicity stunt that morning. The front of the T-shirts read \"Roll Out the\nBarrels! Of Evidence,\" and the back read \"John E. Robinson Trial 2002.\"\n\n\n                                              61\n\f        Judge Anderson found that none of the jurors were exposed to the publicity stunt\nor T-shirts because of safeguards the court had taken, including bringing jurors into the\ncourthouse through a secluded entry away from the incident. Judge Anderson denied the\nmotion, concluding the incident did not affect jurors \"in any way, shape or form.\"\n\n\nLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge's denial of his change of venue motions violated\nhis constitutional right to an impartial jury.\n\n\n       The Sixth Amendment guarantees an accused \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions\" the\nright to a trial by \"an impartial jury.\" U.S. Const. amend VI. This protection is\nincorporated into and made applicable to the States through the due process provision of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Duncan v.

A district judge's ruling on juror impartiality \"is entitled to special\ndeference.\" 300 Kan. at 75. Accordingly, we review claims of actual prejudice under the\nabuse of discretion standard. 300 Kan. at 75. \"An abuse of discretion can occur in one of\nthree ways—when the trial court makes an error of law; bases its decision on facts not\nsupported by the evidence; or makes an arbitrary, fanciful, or unreasonable decision.\"\nLongoria, 301 Kan. at 509.\n\n\n       Defendant also challenges Judge Anderson's rulings under the Kansas change of\nvenue statute, K.S.A. 22-2616(1). As with claims of actual prejudice, we review the trial\ncourt's ruling under the statute for abuse of discretion. Longoria, 301 Kan. at 509.\n\n\nActual Prejudice\n\n       Robinson advances five arguments in support of his actual prejudice challenge,\narguing that the trial court abused its discretion by: (1) failing to acknowledge\nuncontroverted social science evidence that individuals cannot set aside preconceived\nopinions; (2) applying K.S.A. 22-2616 contrary to the Sixth Amendment; (3) finding voir\ndire eliminated those with bias; (4) failing to acknowledge the media's interference with\nproceedings; and (5) failing to acknowledge jurors' failure to abide by admonitions.\n\n\n       1. Did the trial court's findings ignore social science research?\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge erroneously denied the venue change motion in\nlight of uncontroverted expert witness testimony describing social science studies that\nsuggest people struggle to genuinely set aside preconceived beliefs. Given this testimony,\nRobinson believes Judge Anderson's finding that voir dire could overcome community\nbias is unsupported by record evidence.\n\n\n\n                                              63\n\f       There are several problems with Robinson's argument. First, it fails to place the\nexpert witness' testimony in its proper context. During the evidentiary hearing, the\ndefense asked its expert witness, Dillehay, whether Dahl's venue questionnaire was valid\neven though it failed to explore respondents' ability to set aside their opinions of the case.\nDillehay opined that such questions were properly excluded from the surveys because\nthey do not produce reliable survey data. In support of this opinion, Dillehay identified\nseveral studies suggesting humans' struggle to genuinely set aside preconceived beliefs\nyet will attest to their ability to do so. Dillehay did not attempt to extrapolate these\nfindings as support for the broader proposition that Robinson advances here—that anyone\nwho forms an opinion of the case is thereafter unalterably tainted and rendered\nunqualified to serve as a juror. In fact, the Supreme Court has observed that empirical\nstudies support the opposite conclusion. Gentile v.

This testimony provides\nrecord support for Judge Anderson's finding that \"appropriate voir dire and jury selection\nmethods will result in a fair and impartial jury.\" For these reasons, the ruling is supported\nby substantial, competent evidence and does not constitute an abuse of discretion.

Did the trial court apply an incorrect legal standard?\n\n       Robinson next argues the trial court applied an \"impossibility of fair trial\" standard\nunder K.S.A. 22-2616(1) rather than the Sixth Amendment \"reasonable likelihood\" of an\nunfair trial standard embraced by the Supreme Court.

Robinson believes the\nuse of the term \"cannot\" proves the district judge employed an \"impossibility\" standard to\ndefendant's venue change motion.\n\n\n       However, this language merely tracks the venue change statute itself, which\ncompels the court to transfer venue where prejudice against defendant is so great that he\nor she \"cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in that county.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A.\n22-2616(1).\n\n\n       We disposed of a substantively similar challenge in Carr, where defendant argued\nKansas' venue change statute improperly elevated the standard of proof from \"reasonable\nlikelihood\" of an unfair trial to an \"absolute certainty\" of an unfair trial by compelling a\nvenue change only when defendant cannot obtain a fair trial. 300 Kan. at 80. However,\nwe observed in Carr that Kansas courts consistently apply a \"reasonable certainty\"\nstandard of proof (i.e., \"'reasonable certainty' that the defendant cannot obtain a fair trial\nin the ordinary venue\") to challenges under Kansas' venue change statute and found this\n\n                                               65\n\fstandard to be wholly consistent with the Supreme Court's \"reasonable likelihood\"\nstandard. 300 Kan. at 80-81. Carr disposes of Robinson's challenge because it is founded\non Judge Anderson's reference to the same statutory language at issue there.\n\n\n       Defendant also contends Judge Anderson's order is erroneous because it fails to\naddress the constitutionally based venue challenge apart from his statutory challenge.\nHowever, the trial court's memorandum decision addressed the motion to change venue\nunder \"K.S.A. 22-2616, § 10 of the Kansas Constitution's Bill of Rights, and the Sixth\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\" While the order does not\nmake separate findings between the statutory and constitutionally based theories in the\nmotion, \"defendant[ ] never sought a more complete recitation or writing to explain Judge\n[Anderson's] venue rulings; and, if [he] thought the findings were insufficient for\nappellate review, [he] had an obligation to do so.\" Carr, 300 Kan. at 65. Robinson's\nfailure to do so forecloses his challenge. See Longoria, 301 Kan. at 506 (Where\ndefendant fails to \"object to the adequacy of the trial court's factual findings, we assume\nthat the trial court made the findings necessary to deny the change of venue.\").\n\n\n       3. Did voir dire prove ineffective to overcome prejudice?\n\n       In his third actual prejudice argument, Robinson claims the trial court erred by\nfailing to recognize that jury selection only confirmed the need to change venue. This\nchallenge goes to the heart of the question of actual Sixth Amendment prejudice.\n\n\n       \"When faced with a claim of actual prejudice, a trial court must 'review the media\n       coverage and the substance of the jurors' statements at voir dire to determine whether a\n       community-wide sentiment exists against the defendant. Negative media coverage by\n       itself is insufficient to establish actual prejudice.'\" Longoria, 301 Kan. at 508 (quoting\n       Carr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl. ¶ 6).\n\n\n\n                                                    66\n\fIn reviewing a claim of actual prejudice, we examine \"'\"whether the judge had a\nreasonable basis for concluding that the jurors selected could be impartial.\"'\" Carr, 300\nKan. at 74-75.\n\n\n       Robinson first argues the character and composition of the jury panel, as well as\nthe members of his jury, demonstrate actual prejudice. To the contrary, Judge Anderson's\njury selection procedures proved to be successful in identifying bias and removing those\nveniremembers adversely affected by pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       During the second phase of jury selection, the district judge, consistent with the\nrecommendation of Robinson's expert, Dillehay, assigned veniremembers to small group\npanels consisting of six members and allowed counsel for the parties to question them\nextensively on pretrial publicity and death penalty topics. Through this process, Judge\nAnderson excused 95 of the 259 panelists, roughly 37 percent, in whole or in part,\nbecause of firm opinions of guilt arising from exposure to pretrial publicity. Of the 83\npanelists passed to the third phase of jury selection, general voir dire, Robinson had\nchallenged only 8 unsuccessfully on grounds related to pretrial publicity or preconceived\nopinions of guilt.\n\n\n       Robinson argues 52 of the 83 panelists (nearly 63 percent) passed to the third\nphase were biased. However, this calculation includes jurors who merely expressed a\nbelief in capital punishment, even if they had not formed opinions about the case as a\nresult of exposure to pretrial publicity. Robinson's selection criteria were also overly\nbroad, including jurors who expressed a belief or a \"leaning\" toward the belief that\nRobinson was guilty or made statements Robinson believed to be \"suggestive of such a\nbelief\" either during voir dire or merely in their questionnaire responses. Robinson claims\n28 of the 83 panelists held opinions of guilt (either exclusively or in addition to views in\nsupport of capital punishment). Yet, he challenged only 8 of the 83 panelists on such\n                                             67\n\fgrounds. The discrepancy between Robinson's calculation and his actual challenges for\ncause highlights the unreliability of defendant's calculations.\n\n\n       Moreover, the members of defendant's jury were well qualified. The jury consisted\nof 11 members who entered the box without preconceived opinions of the case, and all\nconfirmed their ability to set aside personal views and decide the case on the evidence at\ntrial. Most jurors had minimal exposure to the media's coverage of the case, and none\nexpressed community hostility toward Robinson.\n\n\n       Defendant argues that 8 of the 12 members of the jury were biased. However,\ndefendant's count suffers the same methodological flaws identified above—it includes\njurors based solely on their death penalty views unrelated to pretrial publicity and the\nselection criteria were overly broad. Excluding those jurors defendant counted based\nsolely on their alleged opinion regarding sentence, Robinson identified only four jurors\n(Jurors 39, 87, 246, and 302) who purportedly held preconceived opinions of guilt.\nHowever, a review of their voir dire testimony confirms their impartiality.\n\n\n       Juror 39 agreed there had been a lot of media coverage, mostly adverse to\nRobinson. When defense counsel asked whether the coverage had caused her to form any\nopinions about defendant's guilt, Juror 39 said, \"Well, from what I've read, it seems that\nthe crimes that were committed were committed by him. Again, that's just based on what\nI've read and what I've heard on the news.\" Even so, Juror 39 confirmed her ability to set\nthese facts and opinions aside and committed to holding the State to its burden of proof at\ntrial. When questioned on the subject again during general voir dire, Juror 39 understood\nshe would have to disregard all media facts and start with a clean slate at trial and\nconfirmed her willingness and ability to presume defendant innocent.\n\n\n\n\n                                             68\n\f       Juror 87 testified that she had formed no opinion of guilt and could set aside all\nmedia reported facts in response to questioning from both parties. In the questionnaire,\nshe said that the published reports did not look good for defendant but shared that people\nonly get half the story in the paper and those reports are unbalanced and one-sided. She\nalso clarified that she had not personally decided Robinson was guilty and would set\naside media information and render a verdict based on the evidence. Defendant did not\nchallenge Juror 87 for cause.\n\n\n       Juror 246, in questionnaire responses, said that she had no idea about Robinson's\nguilt or innocence, that if he did commit the crimes he was very sick, and that based\nsolely on the media's coverage it appeared there was a probability of guilt. Even so, Juror\n246 confirmed in response to questioning that she remained unsure as to defendant's guilt\nor innocence. Juror 246 said her memory of media reported facts had faded over time.\nEven if the evidence at trial refreshed her recollection of media facts, Juror 246 said she\nwould not consider them or allow them to influence her decision. She understood the\napplicable burden of proof and confirmed she would acquit Robinson if the State failed to\nmeet its burden. Defendant did not challenge Juror 246 for cause.\n\n\n       Juror 302 said she was unsure as to Robinson's guilt or innocence in questionnaire\nresponses. She felt the media had portrayed Robinson as guilty but clarified this was not\nnecessarily her view. Juror 302 was confident she could set aside media-reported facts\nand decide the case on the evidence. Defendant did not challenge Juror 302 for cause.\n\n\n       Based on his extensive jury selection procedures and the voir dire testimony of\nseated jurors, Judge Anderson had a reasonable basis for concluding that the jurors\nselected could be impartial.

Here, [the trial judge] was not\n       forced to excuse 60 percent of the jury pool at the outset. The number of jurors ultimately\n       seated who had to set aside their earlier opinions was half of that who would have had to\n       do so in Irvin; and none of them expressed community outrage. We also are reassured\n       here by the protective measures taken by [the trial judge], including use of jury\n       questionnaires and individual voir dire.\" 300 Kan. at 78-79.\n\n\n       As in Carr, Irvin is distinguishable on the facts. In Irvin, the trial court dismissed\n62 percent of the entire venire based on firmly held opinions of guilt. Here, the figure was\n37 percent. Only a small percentage of the 83 panelists passed to general voir dire had\nbeen challenged based on preconceived opinions of guilt. Nearly all, 11 of 12 jurors,\nentered the box having formed no such opinion of defendant, a vast improvement over\n\n                                                    71\n\fIrvin, where 8 of 12 jurors held preconceived opinions of guilt, and even better than in\nCarr, where 4 of 12 held preconceived opinions. With few exceptions, jurors did not\nactively follow the media coverage, and media facts did not contain the \"smoking-gun\"\nreports of particular concern in Irvin, such as confessions, results of lie-detector tests, and\noffers to plead guilty to avoid the death penalty. Judge Anderson seated jurors who had\nformed no opinions, \"who had forgotten or would need to be persuaded again.\" Patton,\n467 U.S. at 1034.\n\n\n       In sum, Judge Anderson exercised great care in designing an enhanced jury\nselection process. As defendant's expert, Dillehay, predicted, the process proved to be a\nhighly effective tool for combating the impact of potentially prejudicial pretrial\npublicity—one that yielded a qualified and impartial jury. As such, Judge Anderson had\nreasonable grounds to accept jurors' declarations of impartiality in this case, and\nRobinson has failed to demonstrate actual prejudice. See Gardner, 568 F.3d at 887-90\n(finding no Sixth Amendment prejudice where four jurors had formed opinions of guilt,\nprotective measures trial court implemented during jury selection added credibility to the\njuror's declarations of impartiality); Hale, 227 F.3d at 1332-33 (refusing to set aside\ndeclarations of impartiality where half of jurors entered box with opinions of guilt, but\nvoir dire did not uncover \"an atmosphere of hostility toward the defendant, nor did the\ntrial court have a difficult time in seating the jury\").\n\n\n       4. Did media interference demonstrate actual prejudice?\n\n       Robinson argues the media's interference with courtroom proceedings necessitated\na finding of actual prejudice.\n\n\n       First, he suggests media saturation hit the courthouse steps when a local radio\nstation conducted a publicity stunt by handing out \"Roll out the Barrels of Evidence\" T-\n\n                                               72\n\fshirts outside the courthouse during trial—the incident giving rise to the third renewed\nvenue change motion. However, Robinson does not dispute Judge Anderson's factual\nfinding that the jury was not exposed to this incident, and that, therefore, it could not\nhave affected the jurors' impartiality. We defer to the district judge's findings and concur\nwith his legal conclusion. See State v. Anderson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631553\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631553/state-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">425</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011)\n(applying deference to trial court factual findings in motion to withdraw plea).\n\n\n       Second, Robinson suggests the media coverage reached the court's chambers on\nOctober 7, 2002, when jurors had the opportunity to view the front page of that morning's\ncopy of the Olathe Daily News—the incident giving rise to the second renewed venue\nchange motion. Defendant failed to establish that any juror actually saw the article, and\neven if a juror or jurors had, we have no basis in the record to disagree with Judge\nAnderson's finding that the content was not prejudicial. See State v. Bible, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1154894\"><a href=\"/opinion/1154894/state-v-bible/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">549</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n566-67, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1154894\"><a href=\"/opinion/1154894/state-v-bible/\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993) (finding no error in denying motion to change venue where\nappellant failed to demonstrate publicity resulted in actual prejudice).\n\n\n       Finally, Robinson suggests media coverage spilled into the courtroom itself when\njurors were exposed to prejudicial comments during voir dire. Robinson explains that\nduring questioning of one small group panel, a veniremember said she sensed that she\nwas \"in the presence of evil\" around Robinson. Defendant acknowledges this prospective\njuror was excused but argues Juror 298, who served on the jury, was subjected to the\ncomment. Of course, the statement in question was made by a prospective juror, not\npublicized by the media, and Juror 298's voir dire responses confirmed she had formed no\nopinion of guilt and was committed to deciding the case based on the evidence. Not\nsurprisingly, defendant did not challenge Juror 298 as biased by pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       Similarly, defendant argues that Juror 184, who served on the jury, heard a fellow\npanelist describe Robinson as a \"predator.\" Again, this comment was made by a fellow\n                                              73\n\fveniremember, not publicized by the media. Juror 184 entered the box without any\npreconceived opinion of Robinson's guilt, and defendant did not challenge this juror for\ncause on grounds related to bias or exposure to pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       Robinson offers no further examples of media interference during court\nproceedings, and none are apparent from the record. Robinson fails to demonstrate actual\nprejudice.\n\n\n       5. Did jurors ignore admonitions, demonstrating actual prejudice?\n\n       Finally, Robinson suggests veniremembers' refusal to abide by the district judge's\nadmonitions to avoid media coverage necessitated a finding of actual prejudice.\nDefendant believes prospective jurors did not follow this admonishment because several\npanelists knew they would not be sequestered, a fact allegedly reported in the media,\nbefore the district judge made the announcement.\n\n\n       The record does not support defendant's deduction-based argument. Judge\nAnderson expressly found that court administrators informed several veniremembers of\nthe fact they would not be sequestered before the district judge made the announcement.\nRobinson does not dispute this finding. Moreover, defendant fails to establish that any\nmember of his jury actually failed to comply with the district judge's admonitions. While\nit is concerning that some prospective jurors may have learned the trial court's position on\nsequestration from media sources, this does not establish actual prejudice, given the\nextensive protective measures Judge Anderson implemented throughout jury selection\nand the character and composition of jurors ultimately seated.\n\n\n\n\n                                             74\n\fStatutory Venue Challenge\n\n       Independently, Robinson argues Judge Anderson abused his discretion in denying\nhis motions under Kansas' venue change statute.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-2616(1) compels a venue change where the district judge \"is satisfied\nthat there exists in the county where the prosecution is pending so great a prejudice\nagainst the defendant that he cannot obtain a fair and impartial trial in that county.\" The\nburden falls on defendant to show prejudice in the community, not as a matter of\nspeculation but as a demonstrable reality.

The first factor weighed in favor of venue change because Dahl's surveys\nevidenced widespread circulation of the pretrial publicity throughout the community. The\n                                                     75\n\fsecond factor weighed slightly in favor of changing venue as the surveys demonstrated\nthat case recognition was not as extensive in Harvey and Ellis Counties. Even so,\nrecognition of the case outside the venue of origin was extremely high, with 80 percent of\nHarvey County residents and 64 percent of Ellis County residents expressing recognition\nof the case. Thus, the weight of this factor in the overall analysis is diminished. As to the\nfifth factor, Dahl's venue study suggests media coverage had an effect on prospective\njurors because 67 percent of respondents believed defendant was \"probably\" or\n\"definitely\" guilty. Regarding the eighth factor, Robinson was charged with two counts of\ncapital murder and one count of first-degree murder. \"[T]he most serious charged\noffenses could not have been more severe or their potential consequences more\nirreversible.\" Carr, 300 Kan. at 82.\n\n\n       Five factors, including the third, fourth, sixth, seventh, and ninth, favored denial of\neach of defendant's motions for venue change. The third factor weighed against a change\nof venue as more than 2 years had lapsed between the time the story first broke in June\n2000, when media coverage was at its height, and Robinson's trial in October 2002, when\ncoverage had dissipated. The fourth factor weighed heavily against a change of venue\nbecause Judge Anderson took great care in designing and implementing his four-phase\njury selection process. The sixth factor, challenges exercised, weighed in favor of\ndenying a venue change. Judge Anderson granted 92 of defendant's 100 challenges\nasserted on pretrial publicity grounds. Of those jurors unsuccessfully challenged, all but\none, Juror 39, was removed by peremptory challenge. Regarding the seventh factor, the\nmedia coverage was not materially connected to government officials. Robinson suggests\nthat the prosecutor participated in press conferences, but none of the media-published\nfacts defendant contends to be uniquely prejudicial were connected to the prosecution.\nFinally, the ninth factor weighed against a venue change because Johnson County had\none of the largest population bases in the state from which to draw the venire.\n\n\n                                             76\n\f       The statutory venue challenge in Carr provides a useful comparison because there\nthe same expert witness produced nearly identical survey results in a capital murder trial\nsituated in one of the largest metropolitan areas in the state. In every relevant category\n(case recognition, opinion of guilt, and strength of evidence), the survey responses in\nCarr revealed case recognition and prejudgment at levels higher than or equal to those in\nthis case. 300 Kan. at 49. Even so, the majority held that Judge Paul Clark did not abuse\nhis discretion under K.S.A. 22-2616 in denying defendants' motions for venue change.\n300 Kan. at 82. Given the similarity between the two cases, Carr offers compelling\nsupport for Judge Anderson's rulings.\n\n\n       In fact, the rulings are all the more defensible here because, unlike Carr,\nRobinson's venue expert, Dillehay, opined that enhanced voir dire could effectively\ninoculate the effects of extensive pretrial publicity. While Dillehay believed \"enhanced\nvoir dire\" would be infeasible from an administrative perspective, Judge Anderson was\nundaunted, implementing the very type of voir dire process Dillehay described. The\nprocess was lengthy but, in hindsight, proved highly effective in identifying and\nremoving those rendered unqualified by their exposure to pretrial publicity.\n\n\n       Our other case precedents offer additional support for Judge Anderson's rulings.\nSee State v.

See\nLongoria, 301 Kan. at 512; Carr, 300 Kan. at 84. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion.\n\n\nPresumed Prejudice\n\n       On appeal, defendant advanced only two theories supporting his venue challenge:\nactual prejudice under the Sixth Amendment and abuse of discretion under Kansas' venue\nchange statute. However Robinson's first motion to change venue on Sixth Amendment\ngrounds was pursued prior to voir dire—a point at which a claim of actual prejudice\nunder the Sixth Amendment was premature. Defendant's supporting memorandum relied,\nin part, on a presumed prejudice theory. Furthermore, in a Rule 6.09 (2014 Kan. Ct. R.\nAnnot. 52) letter to this court, defendant cites the United States Supreme Court's most\nrecent opinion addressing presumed prejudice, Skilling v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150540\"><a href=\"/opinion/150540/skilling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">358</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n381-85, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150540\"><a href=\"/opinion/150540/skilling-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Independently, the Kansas statute compels the court, with regard to sentence,\nto determine \"[w]hether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of\npassion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor.\" K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 21-6619(c)(1). In the\ninterests of justice, we consider presumed prejudice as a potential unassigned error on\nappeal.\n\n\n       Presumed prejudice occurs \"'where the pretrial publicity is so pervasive and\nprejudicial that we cannot expect to find an unbiased jury pool in the community. We\n\"presume prejudice\" before trial in those cases, and a venue change is necessary.'\" Carr,\n300 Kan. at 57.\n\n\n       In deciding whether to presume prejudice, courts consider seven factors\nenunciated in Skilling, 561 U.S. at 381-85:\n\n\n       \"(1) media interference with courtroom proceedings; (2) the magnitude and tone of the\n       coverage; (3) the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred;\n       (4) the amount of time that elapsed between the crime and the trial; (5) the jury's verdict;\n       (6) the impact of the crime on the community; and (7) the effect, if any, of a\n       codefendant's publicized decision to plead guilty.\" Carr, 300 Kan. at 62\n\n\n       In reviewing presumed prejudice claims, \"we apply a mixed standard of review,\nexamining the trial court's findings of fact for substantial competent evidence and the\nultimate legal conclusion drawn from the facts—whether to presume prejudice—de\nnovo.\" Longoria, 301 Kan. at 506.\n\n\n       Turning to the first Skilling factor, defendant argued in his second and third\nrenewed motions to change venue that a media circus spilled into the courtroom.\n                                                    79\n\fHowever, as set forth in defendant's actual prejudice challenge, defendant failed to\ndemonstrate any prejudice from the T-shirt and Olathe Daily News incidents giving rise\nto these motions.\n\n\n       As to the second Skilling factor, Robinson argues the media reported prejudicial\nfacts that were inadmissible at trial, such as Robinson's white-collar criminal history; his\nconnection to other missing persons; his involvement with other women; and his\nprosecution for fraud and murder in Missouri. However, the presumed prejudice doctrine\n\"cannot be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to information about a\nstate defendant's prior convictions or to news accounts of the crime with which he is\ncharged alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.\" Murphy, 421 U.S. at\n799. The pretrial publicity included in the record was predominantly fact-based reporting.\nSee Longoria, 301 Kan. at 507 (factor weighs against venue change where reporting is\nmore fact based than inflammatory). There were no \"smoking-gun\" reports, such as\nconfessions of defendant, results of lie detector testing, or defendant's offer to plead\nguilty to avoid the death penalty. See Skilling, 561 U.S. at 382-83 (the lack of \"evidence\nof the smoking-gun variety\" weighed against a finding of presumed prejudice).\nMoreover, Dahl's venue study suggested that some of these media facts were not widely\nrecognized by the community or the level of recognition was similar to that in other\nvenues.\n\n\n       The third Skilling factor—the size and characteristics of the community—weighed\nagainst a finding of presumed prejudice because Johnson County is one of the largest\ncounties in the state, with close to half a million residents.\n\n\n       Regarding the fourth Skilling factor, more than 2 years had elapsed from the time\nthe story first broke and the start of trial. Even so, survey results more than 1 year after\nRobinson's arrest showed a high degree of case recognition. This factor is inconclusive or\n                                              80\n\fweighed slightly against a finding of presumed prejudice. See Longoria, 301 Kan. at 507-\n08 (factor weighed against venue change where case recognition high but memory of\ndetails had faded); Carr, 300 Kan. at 68 (factor inconclusive where substantial time\nelapsed but evidence of juror recollection remained high at voir dire).\n\n       The fifth Skilling factor, the jury's verdict, was unknown at the time the district\njudge ruled and carries no weight in the analysis. See Longoria, 301 Kan. at 508.\n\n       On the sixth Skilling factor, none of the publicity of record clearly addresses the\nimpact of the crimes on the community. The record includes two articles warning of the\ndangers of online dating in the aftermath of the crimes, but these reports reflect opinions\nof a law enforcement officer and a journalist rather than community-wide sentiment. On\nthe other hand, Dahl's venue study revealed a high level of case recognition, suggesting\nthe crimes generated interest and were followed by members of the community. Thus this\nfactor may have weighed slightly in favor of a finding of presumed prejudice.\n\n\n       The seventh and final Skilling factor—publicized confession of a codefendant—\ndoes not factor into the analysis because Robinson alone was charged with the offenses in\nthis action and the State never charged any codefendant. Cf. Carr, 300 Kan. at 69.\n\n\n       In the end, only the sixth Skilling factor weighed in favor of a finding of presumed\nprejudice. The fifth and seventh factors were not relevant to the analysis, and the fourth\nfactor was inconclusive at best. The first, second, and third Skilling factors weighed\nagainst a finding of presumed prejudice at the time Judge Anderson ruled on each\nmotion.\n\n\n       \"The bar facing the defendant wishing to prove presumed prejudice from pretrial\npublicity is extremely high.\" United States v.

Thus Judge Anderson did not err in failing to presume\nprejudice under the Sixth Amendment. See Longoria, 301 Kan. at 508; Carr, 300 Kan. at\n65-70.\n\n\n                                      2. CONTINUANCE\n\n\n         Defendant next challenges the trial court's denials of his continuance motions. He\nbelieves Judge Anderson denied them to penalize him for exercising his right to counsel\nof choice. Independently, Robinson argues the rulings constitute an abuse of discretion.\n\n\nAdditional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n         On June 14, 2000, Judge Anderson appointed Kansas' Death Penalty Defense Unit\n(DPDU) to represent Robinson. The State filed its notice to pursue a death penalty phase\nsentencing proceeding, along with its alleged aggravating circumstance on March 2,\n2001. The DPDU actively litigated the case for 13 months, investigating the charges,\nfiling 39 substantive motions, and defending Robinson at preliminary hearing.\n\n\n         1. Substitution of Counsel\n\n         On July 18, 2001, attorney Bob L. Thomas entered his appearance as attorney of\nrecord for Robinson. Later that day, the DPDU filed a motion to withdraw. At the July\n23, 2001 hearing, Judge Anderson made inquiry regarding Thomas' qualifications.\n                                              82\n\fThomas had practiced as a licensed attorney for about 1 year before entering his\nappearance in this case. In the year, he had served as lead counsel on two noncapital jury\ntrials. Thomas had hired a private investigator and planned to add several legal assistants\nbut confirmed he would be the only attorney on the defense team.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson observed that Thomas did not meet Kansas Board of Indigents'\nDefense Services' qualification standards for appointment to a capital case and that\nRobinson's Sixth Amendment right to representation by counsel of choice had to be\ntempered by his right to competent and effective counsel. To balance these competing\ninterests, the district judge explored the possibility of having the DPDU remain in the\ncase as cocounsel. Thomas and defendant were willing to consent to such an\narrangement, with the understanding that Thomas would serve as lead counsel. The\nDPDU declined, arguing that the arrangement was unworkable and that Robinson was no\nlonger eligible for DPDU assistance.\n\n\n       At a continued hearing on July 27, 2001, Judge Anderson granted the DPDU's\nmotion to withdraw and announced his intention to appoint capital defense qualified\ncocounsel to assist Thomas. Neither Robinson nor Thomas objected.\n\n\n       On August 2, the trial court entered orders appointing Patrick Berrigan and Sean\nO'Brien, both of whom had extensive capital defense litigation experience, as cocounsel\nin this case for the purpose of representing Robinson \"[d]uring the prosecution and trial\nof said felony defendant, including sentencing.\" No party objected to these orders. Judge\nAnderson set the matter over for 1 month to give the newly formed defense team time to\nreview motions and to give Berrigan time to recover from heart bypass surgery. O'Brien's\nassociate attorney, Joseph Luby, and Berrigan's associate attorney, Jason Billam, also\nserved as members of Robinson's defense team.\n\n\n                                            83\n\f        2. First Motion for Continuance\n\n        On September 20, 2001, Robinson filed his first motion to continue trial, citing\nextensive discovery, cocounsel's commitment in other cases, and the need to develop a\nmitigation case—including gathering mitigation evidence; investigating the State's\naggravating circumstance; considering the possibility of psychological and neurological\nevaluations; interviewing defendant's family for testimony in the sentencing phase; and\nconducting a thorough background investigation of Robinson's educational, medical,\nemployment, and criminal histories—in support of the requested relief. Defense counsel\nclaimed it needed \"as much as a year to adequately prepare this case for trial\" and\nrequested the setting be moved from January 14 to September 16, 2002.\n\n\n        At the September 21, 2001, hearing, Judge Anderson emphasized that if he\ngranted the continuance, the new trial date would be a firm setting and no further\ncontinuance would be granted absent \"extraordinary\" circumstances. After confirming\nthat defense counsel had evaluated their schedules and understood any new trial date\nwould be firm, Judge Anderson granted the motion and reset trial for September 16,\n2002.\n\n\n        3. Thomas' Withdrawal and Second Motion for Continuance\n\n        On February 21, 2002, Thomas filed a motion to withdraw after receiving the\nState's February 13 supplemental discovery, which included documents indicating\nMarvin Ray, Thomas' former client, had offered to be a cooperating witness for the State.\n\n\n        Later that same day, Robinson filed his second motion for continuance, arguing\nthat counsel Berrigan and O'Brien (appointed counsel) and Thomas (retained counsel)\nhad an agreement as to the division of labor in the case, whereby retained counsel was\nhandling the guilt phase and appointed counsel the penalty phase. Robinson argued\n                                             84\n\fThomas' withdrawal, combined with appointed counsels' obligations in other cases, made\nit impossible to prepare Robinson's defense before the September 16, 2002, trial setting.\nAppointed counsel requested a 4-month continuance.\n\n\n       After confirming with Robinson that he was discharging Thomas as counsel of\nrecord, Judge Anderson granted Thomas' motion to withdraw and denied the continuance\nmotion during a February 28 hearing.\n\n\n       4. Robinson's Third Request for Continuance\n\n       On July 18, 2002, Robinson filed a third motion for continuance, alleging that\ndiscovery complications made it impossible to prepare Robinson's guilt phase defense\nbefore the September trial setting. On July 25, the trial court held an evidentiary hearing.\n\n\n              a. Discovery Delays\n\n       Phil Gibson, an investigator for the defense team, testified that it would take\nsubstantial time to complete witness interviews because of the State's massive endorsed\nwitness list, which included roughly 600 witnesses, 79 of whom had been endorsed after\nthe February 2001 preliminary hearing. However, the State had later provided a \"will\ncall\" list that narrowed down those most likely to testify to around 200.\n\n\n       Dean Stettler, Robinson's DNA expert, testified to delays related to the State's\nDNA disclosures. Stettler was engaged to evaluate law enforcement's DNA testing\nprocedures and advise the defense on the need for independent testing. On March 22,\n2002, he received three, 4-inch binders containing well in excess of 100 pages of law\nenforcement lab reports. The documents were in Bates-stamp order, but Stettler thought\nthe Bates-stamp order was random. He said it took him 3 weeks to organize the\ndocuments in a logical order.\n                                             85\n\f       Once the reports were organized, Stettler met with members of the JOCO Lab and\nfound 46 reports that had not been included in the State's disclosures. District Attorney\nPaul Morrison testified that the DNA testing was handled exclusively by the KCMO Lab\nand he did not give Stettler the 46 reports from the JOCO Lab because they pertained to\nhair analysis, tire track impression work, and latent print examinations, not DNA testing.\nNevertheless, Stettler felt the reports might be useful and received copies the same day\nStettler learned of the reports' existence.\n\n\n       Stettler also reviewed the KCMO Lab's case file and confirmed the State had\nproduced all reports. However, Stettler wanted to review the supporting data and\nrequested the same. The KCMO Lab voluntarily produced this data on CD-ROM. Stettler\ndid not maintain a current version of the software necessary to view the material\nelectronically however, and it took him a month to find an independent lab to print the\nmaterial for him.\n\n\n       Stettler admitted he had a complete copy of the files maintained by both crime labs\nwithin a few weeks of receiving the State's disclosures. At the time of the hearing, Stettler\nhad been in possession of the files for nearly 3 months and the CD-ROM for more than\n10 weeks. Stettler said he could complete his work and advise the defense team on the\nneed for independent testing within 3 to 4 weeks.\n\n\n       On September 5, 2002, defense counsel informed the district judge that DNA\nsamples had been sent to a lab for independent testing. No results were introduced at trial;\nnor are they included in the record on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                              86\n\f              b. Delay Related to the Division-of-Labor Agreement\n\n       Thomas offered testimony regarding the need for continuance in light of defense\ncounsels' division-of-labor agreement. He confirmed that the defense team had agreed he\nwould handle the guilt phase, while appointed counsel, Berrigan and O'Brien, would\nhandle the penalty phase. Thomas said the defense conducted work consistent with this\ndivision of labor agreement and committed to the September trial setting in reliance on it.\n\n\n       Thomas also testified to the events giving rise to his withdrawal or discharge.\nThomas had represented Marvin Ray in another matter before entering his appearance as\nRobinson's counsel in the summer of 2001. Shortly thereafter, he asked prosecutor\nMorrison whether the State had any \"jail-house snitches,\" specifically mentioning Ray.\nMorrison said a few inmates, including Ray, had contacted his office, but Morrison\nbelieved Ray lacked credibility and the State was not interested in his testimony. The\nState made no further mention of Ray until February 2002, when it produced a letter Ray\nhad written and other documents.\n\n\n       Morrison testified the Ray letter and documents were disclosed with sufficient\ntime to prepare Robinson's defense. Ray first contacted his office, offering to testify\nagainst Robinson, around July 2001. On October 4, the prosecution subpoenaed\ndocuments from Ray, and in response, correctional officials searched Ray's cell and\nfound documents responsive to the subpoena. Among these documents, they found a\nletter in which Ray described how he and two other people allegedly transported two\nfemale bodies to a farm near LaCygne and placed them in barrels in exchange for drugs.\nMorrison disclosed the Ray documents 7 months in advance of trial and confirmed that\nthe prosecution had no intention of calling Ray or introducing the documents at trial.\nNeither party, in fact, called Ray or introduced his documents at trial.\n\n\n\n                                             87\n\f       The court denied the motion for continuance.\n\n\n       5. Robinson's Fourth Motion to Continue Trial\n\n       On August 30, 2002, nearly 2 weeks before trial, defense counsel filed a motion\nfor continuance or, alternatively, for leave to withdraw, arguing that several discovery\nproblems continued to delay preparations. Defense counsel also claimed to need\nadditional time to develop Robinson's penalty phase defense, explaining they had hired a\nforensic social worker in January 2002 to conduct an investigation of Robinson's\nbackground and social history but learned in late July that the expert had made no\nprogress because of a disabling back injury suffered in a car accident.\n\n\n       Defense counsel hired a new mitigation expert, Scarlet Nerad. Although she had\nalready commenced work, defense counsel argued there was insufficient time for her to\ncomplete it before trial. Robinson requested an 8-month continuance to complete a social\nhistory report and a comprehensive mental evaluation.\n\n\n       At the September 5 hearing, Robinson offered Nerad's affidavit under seal, which\nthe district judge reviewed in camera over the State's objection. In the affidavit, Nerad\nclaimed that her preliminary investigation suggested Robinson had endured chronic and\nlife-threatening violence, abandonment, and neglect at the hands of his caretakers. When\nRobinson was 5 years old, his mother began assaulting him several times a week, without\nprovocation—beating him severely, threatening to kill him, and telling him she wished he\nwere dead or never born. As a small child, Robinson grew deeply attached to his infant\nbrother. The child fell ill and died, and Robinson's mother blamed him for the death.\nRobinson was devastated by the loss of his brother and shattered by the false accusations\nlodged by his mother. As Robinson grew older, the abuse escalated, often leaving him\nunconscious or bedridden, and his mother isolated him from other family members.\n\n                                             88\n\f       According to Nerad, such suspected abuse left Robinson vulnerable to psychiatric\ndiseases such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In fact, she claimed Robinson met\nthe criteria for PTSD. Nerad also believed Robinson exhibited symptoms of dissociative\nand mood disorders, evidenced by bouts of psychosis, extreme mood fluctuations, flat\naffect, and episodes of mania. Nerad's affidavit did not establish her qualifications to\ndiagnose such conditions.\n\n\n       Nerad made clear that her findings were preliminary and that she needed to\ncomplete substantial additional investigation to verify and document the abuse and its\neffect on Robinson before she could deliver a completed background and social history\nreport. She said she could not complete it in time for the September trial setting. She also\nnoted that other medical professionals would need her report to complete Robinson's\ncomprehensive mental assessment.\n\n\n       The continuance was denied.\n\n\n       6. Request for Continuance at the Outset of the Penalty Phase\n\n       On September 12, 2002, the defense filed a motion to transport Robinson to the\nUniversity of Kansas Medical Center (KU Medical Center) for MRI and PET scans. The\ndefense argued the testing was necessary for its expert, Dr. Dorothy O. Lewis, a professor\nof psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine, to conduct a psychiatric\nevaluation of Robinson.\n\n\n       Defense counsel offered the affidavit of Lewis under seal in support of the motion.\nLewis declared that, based on her preliminary review, there was reason to believe\nRobinson suffered from \"a bipolar mood disorder\"; he \"was severely physically and\n\n                                             89\n\femotionally abused throughout childhood\"; \"as a result of this maltreatment, he\nexperiences episodic dissociative states\"; \"as many as four generations of family\nmembers may have suffered\" similar mental illness; a 1991 MRI revealed brain\nabnormalities, \"allegedly a result of transient ischemic attacks\"; and \"Robinson\n. . . cannot appreciate the nature and strength of the evidence\" against him.\n\n\n       Lewis also said that, in order to make a credible diagnosis, she needed time to\ncomplete additional testing and evaluation, including psychiatric interviews; an MRI to\nassess possible brain changes over time; a PET scan to assess frontal lobe function; a\nneurologic evaluation; a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery; and a review of\nRobinson's background and social history. Without such information, Lewis asserted, it\nwould be impossible to render an opinion regarding Robinson's mental functioning.\n\n\n       The trial court granted the motion during a September 12 status conference.\n\n\n       On October 31, after the jury had convicted Robinson on all charges, defendant\nmoved for continuance of the penalty phase. Appointed counsel explained that they had\ndecided not to have Robinson transported to KU Medical Center for an MRI and PET\nscan because there was simply insufficient time for experts to complete the testing and\nevaluation needed to render a qualified opinion regarding Robinson's mental functioning.\n\n\n       The court denied the continuance.\n\n\nConstitutional Challenge\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge refused to continue the trial as punishment or in\nretaliation for his decision to hire Thomas and discharge the DPDU, violating his right to\ndue process. Although the argument is less than clear from the briefing, Robinson also\n\n                                             90\n\fappears to suggest the trial court unconstitutionally burdened his Sixth Amendment right\nto counsel of choice by having him bear the risk that counsel would be unprepared.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       Robinson's challenge is founded on the Sixth Amendment right to counsel—a\nfundamental right guaranteed to all criminal defendants. Kimmelman v.

The Due Process Challenge\n\n        Robinson first contends that Judge Anderson's rulings were intended to punish\ndefendant for the delay that resulted when he retained Thomas in place of the DPDU.\n\n\n        The argument ignores and is entirely inconsistent with the fact that Judge\nAnderson accepted Thomas' entry of appearance and subsequently granted him a lengthy\ncontinuance. Thomas' filing of his entry of appearance provided Judge Anderson with a\ndirect and immediate opportunity to subvert Robinson's right to counsel of choice.\nThomas lacked the experience and resources to handle a capital defense alone, and Judge\nAnderson could have denied the entry of appearance altogether. See, e.g., United States v.\nCollins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552433\"><a href=\"/opinion/552433/united-states-v-roy-w-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 626 (10th Cir. 1990) (district court may deny a defendant's\n                                                      92\n\fcounsel of choice where attorney unable to provide competent representation). Instead, he\ngave effect to both of Robinson's Sixth Amendment interests—the right to counsel of\nchoice and the right to competent counsel—by accepting Thomas' entry of appearance\nand appointing qualified cocounsel.\n\n\n       Once Thomas was granted entry, Judge Anderson had a second opportunity to\n\"punish\" Robinson for retaining private counsel by denying his first motion for\ncontinuance. Instead, Judge Anderson granted the continuance, providing defense counsel\nroughly 1 full year to prepare for trial.\n\n\n       Robinson makes no mention of these rulings. Instead, he focuses on the district\njudge's denial of subsequent motions for a second continuance. In these rulings, Judge\nAnderson mentions that the DPDU handled the case and was on track for a trial setting in\nearly 2002, that Robinson discharged the DPDU by hiring Thomas, that the court\nappointed qualified cocounsel, and that the result was further delay. Robinson believes\nthese comments evidence Judge Anderson's retaliatory motive.\n\n\n       The argument lacks merit. When read in context, it is apparent that Judge\nAnderson referenced the DPDU and Robinson's decision to hire Thomas, not to blame\nRobinson for any delay resulting from that decision, but to summarize the sequence and\ntimeline of events, highlight the purpose and scope of the appointment of cocounsel, and\nemphasize that Thomas and appointed counsel had the benefit of more than a year's\nworth of the DPDU's work on the case. The district judge's reference to the delay that\nfollowed Thomas' entry of appearance and the appointment of cocounsel was an accurate\naccount. It also served to highlight that the district judge had granted a previous, lengthy\ncontinuance, a relevant factor in assessing whether defendant has established good cause\nfor a subsequent continuance under K.S.A. 22-3401. See State v. Snodgrass, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2604247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2604247/state-v-snodgrass/\"><span class=\"volume\">252</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2604247\"><a href=\"/opinion/2604247/state-v-snodgrass/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992) (trial court did not abuse discretion in denying\n                                             93\n\fcontinuance where a prior continuance had been granted on eve of trial); United States v.\nSharrak, 527 Fed.

In the end, Judge\nAnderson denied each request for a second continuance because he believed there was\nadequate time to prepare the defense, especially considering the resources of the defense\nteam and the fact that a lengthy continuance had been granted previously. The rulings\nwere an appropriate exercise of lawful discretion and cannot be construed as retaliatory.\nSee Anthony, 257 Kan. at 1019-20 (trial court did not abuse discretion or otherwise\ninterfere with counsel of choice where it did not attempt to restrain counsel from entering\nthe case and only declined the request to continue trial to allow new counsel time to\nprepare).\n\n\n       3. The Sixth Amendment Challenge\n\n       Robinson next argues the district judge relied on a number of factual errors in\ndenying his motions for continuance. While this argument sounds more akin to an abuse\nof discretion challenge, Robinson seems to suggest the trial court's alleged factual errors\neffectively placed an unconstitutional burden on his right to counsel of choice.\n\n\n       Specifically, Robinson contends the district judge erred in fact, thereby burdening\nthe right to counsel of choice, by: (1) finding that Robinson had discharged the DPDU;\n(2) minimizing the burden defense counsel experienced in managing discovery; and (3)\n\n\n\n                                             94\n\ffailing to account for the delay caused by the State's tardy and disorganized DNA testing\ndisclosures.\n\n       First, Robinson argues the district judge erroneously found that Robinson had\ndischarged the DPDU. In the July 25, 2002 ruling denying defendant's third motion to\ncontinue trial, Judge Anderson said, \"When Mr. Thomas got in this case, he got in it\nbecause the defendant discharged, essentially through hiring Mr. Thomas, the capital\ndefense team and retained an attorney of his own choice.\" (Emphasis added.) Likewise,\nin the October 31, 2002, ruling denying defendant's motion to continue the penalty phase,\nJudge Anderson explained that \"in the summer of 2001 Mr. Robinson chose to discharge\nthe capital defense team provided to him by the State of Kansas. . . . and did so by\nretaining counsel, Mr. Thomas, who undertook to represent him at that time.\" (Emphasis\nadded.)\n\n\n       Judge Anderson's rulings indicate that Robinson effectively discharged the DPDU\nby retaining Thomas. The record supports this finding. During a July 23, 2001, in-camera\nproceeding, Judge Anderson discussed the status of defendant's representation in the\npresence of Robinson, the DPDU, and Thomas. During the proceeding, Judge Anderson\nconfirmed that it was Robinson's desire to remove DPDU counsel and substitute Thomas\nas counsel in their place.\n\n\n       More importantly, whether the trial court characterized the DPDU's exit as a\n\"discharge\" or a \"withdrawal\" is a factual distinction without a legal difference. Judge\nAnderson did not deny any of defendant's motions based on a finding that the DPDU\nexited the case as a result of discharge, as opposed to withdrawal. Cf. State v. Nelson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">692</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013) (\"Judicial discretion is abused if judicial action . . . is\nbased on an error of fact, i.e., if substantial competent evidence does not support a factual\nfinding on which a prerequisite conclusion of law or the exercise of discretion is based.\").\n\n                                             95\n\fMoreover, it is unclear how the characterization of the DPDU's exit as a discharge instead\nof a withdrawal could or would have placed any additional burden on Robinson's Sixth\nAmendment right to counsel of choice.\n\n\n       Second, Robinson argues Judge Anderson improperly \"minimized\" testimony\nregarding the delay created by the number of witnesses endorsed by the State. Judge\nAnderson addressed this issue specifically in denying the third motion for continuance,\nfinding that Kansas law compelled the prosecution to endorse all potential witnesses\nregardless of the extent of their knowledge and that the defense team's resources,\nincluding four attorneys, an investigator, and six legal interns, were sufficient to\novercome the discovery complications and complete preparations in the time allotted for\ntrial. These findings were supported by substantial competent evidence in the record, and\nwe cannot say that no reasonable judge would have agreed with Judge Anderson's ruling.\nRobinson's real complaint is that Judge Anderson did not assign his evidence the weight\nhe believed it deserved. Such a dispute does not establish grounds for error. See In re\nEstate of Farr, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632331/in-re-estate-of-farr/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632331\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632331/in-re-estate-of-farr/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002) (\"It is the factfinder's function to\ndetermine the weight and credibility of the witnesses. Appellate courts will not pass upon\nthe credibility of witnesses or reweigh conflicting evidence.\").\n\n\n       Finally, Robinson believes Judge Anderson minimized the prejudice occasioned\nby the State's tardy and disorganized disclosures to defendant's DNA expert. Again,\nJudge Anderson addressed this issue specifically in denying the third motion for\ncontinuance, explaining that any delay the expert experienced did not prevent appointed\ncounsel from continuing to work on other aspects of Robinson's defense. On appeal,\nRobinson admits the expert's delay did not impede counsel's ability to prepare for trial but\nargues it prevented the defense from completing an independent DNA analysis.\n\n\n\n\n                                             96\n\f       We find the argument unavailing. The defense team did not pursue independent\ntesting until after the State completed and disclosed its DNA lab reports. Thereafter,\nmuch of the delay Stettler experienced was the result of his decisions on time\nmanagement. We have found no error in the denial of continuance under similar\ncircumstances. See State v. Lewis, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">828</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 846-48, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014);\nSnodgrass, 252 Kan. at 264.\n\n\n       Moreover, during the July 25 evidentiary hearing, Stettler admitted he could\ncomplete his work and advise the defense within 3 to 4 weeks—leaving adequate time\nbefore trial. On September 5, defense counsel informed Judge Anderson that samples had\nbeen sent to a lab for independent analysis, but the results of that testing were never\nintroduced at trial or included in the record on appeal. Thus the district judge had no basis\nupon which to make a finding of good cause warranting a continuance. See State v.\nDaigle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1183586\"><a href=\"/opinion/1183586/state-v-daigle/\"><span class=\"volume\">220</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643-44, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1183586\"><a href=\"/opinion/1183586/state-v-daigle/\"><span class=\"volume\">556</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976) (affirming denial of continuance\nwhere defendant failed to show relief would result in favorable evidence from a\ncompleted fracture analysis), cert. denied </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977); see also Coy v.

In fact, the evidence\nstrongly suggests otherwise.\n\n\n       In the end, we hold that the denial of continuance did not violate Robinson's due\nprocess or Sixth Amendment rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                             97\n\fStatutory Challenge\n\n       In addition to his constitutional challenges, Robinson argues the trial court abused\nits discretion in denying his requests for continuance. For purposes of clarity, the\nchallenge is divided into two subissues: (1) whether the trial court abused its discretion\nin denying a continuance to allow counsel additional time to prepare the guilt phase\ndefense; and (2) whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying a continuance to\nallow counsel additional time to prepare the penalty phase defense.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       K.S.A. 22-3401 provides that \"[c]ontinuances may be granted to either party for\ngood cause shown.\" \"In a criminal case, the decision to continue a case lies within the\nsound discretion of the district court.\" State v.

Additionally, where a defendant claims the denial of\ncontinuance interfered with his or her ability to present a defense, we review the question\nde novo. Lewis, 299 Kan. at 846.\n\n\n       The legal standard for granting a continuance is \"good cause\" shown. K.S.A. 22-\n3401; State v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2571537\"><a href=\"/opinion/2571537/state-v-carter/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007). However, where a\ncontinuance is sought to retain new counsel, we consider the following five factors:\n\n\n       \"(1) whether a continuance would inconvenience witnesses, the court, counsel, or the\n       parties; (2) whether other continuances have been granted; (3) whether legitimate reasons\n                                                  98\n\f       exist for the delay; (4) whether the delay is the fault of the defendant; and (5) whether\n       denial of a continuance would prejudice the defendant.\" Anthony, 257 Kan. at 1019.\n\n\nRobinson argues the Anthony factors should apply to his challenge. However, Anthony\napplies in situations where defendant seeks a continuance for the purpose of retaining\nnew counsel, thereby placing the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice\nin competition with the court's discretionary power to deny continuances. 257 Kan. at\n1019. At the time the court denied the defendant's second continuance motion, appointed\ncounsel, Berrigan and O'Brien, had served as counsel to Robinson for nearly 7 months.\nRobinson never requested or retained new counsel after Thomas' discharge, and\nappointed counsel represented him throughout both phases of trial. As such, Robinson's\nSixth Amendment right to counsel of choice was never implicated and Anthony's five-\nfactor test does not apply. See State v. Ly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639095\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639095/state-v-ly/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639095\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639095/state-v-ly/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (five-factor\ntest did not apply where defendant \"did not request a continuance so he could retain new\ncounsel\"), cert. denied </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).\n\n\n       2. Continuance to Provide Additional Time to Prepare Guilt Phase\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred in denying his requests for a second\ncontinuance in the face of evidence establishing: (1) the division-of-labor agreement,\nwhereby retained counsel, Thomas, was to prepare the guilt phase defense and appointed\ncounsel, Berrigan and O'Brien, the penalty phase defense; (2) the unexpected discharge or\nwithdrawal of Thomas; and (3) the impact of Thomas' withdrawal on trial preparations.\n\n\n       The record includes competing evidence regarding the propriety of a continuance\nnotwithstanding Robinson's arguments. Although defense counsel took it upon\nthemselves to divide the labor, Judge Anderson was unaware of this decision. His orders\nappointing counsel specified that Berrigan and O'Brien were to represent defendant at\ntrial and through sentencing. Judge Anderson found the division-of-labor agreement\n                                                    99\n\ffrustrated the purpose of his orders. Also, as Judge Anderson explained, conflicts and\nother matters giving rise to the withdrawal of counsel are not unforeseeable, casting\nfurther doubt on the reasonableness of defense counsels' reliance on this division of labor.\nThere is also reason to question how strictly counsel adhered to the arrangement. Soon\nafter their appointment, Berrigan and O'Brien signed pleadings and motions, played a\nleading role at motions hearings and status conferences, and handled the examination of\nwitnesses and argument at the January 2002 evidentiary hearing on the venue motion. All\nof these events were part of the guilt phase of the case.\n\n\n       The record also provides direct support for Judge Anderson's findings and\nconclusions. While Thomas' withdrawal certainly increased appointed counsel's workload\nand responsibility, they were not starting from scratch. Berrigan and O'Brien had served\nas counsel to Robinson for roughly 7 months prior to Thomas' withdrawal, and they had\nanother 7 months to prepare thereafter, thanks to Judge Anderson's order granting\nRobinson's first continuance motion. Appointed counsel also had the benefit of the\npreparation Thomas and the DPDU had done over the course of nearly 2 years. After\nThomas' withdrawal, O'Brien's associate attorney Luby entered his appearance for the\ndefense, and Robinson never sought appointment of new counsel.\n\n\n       We have not previously reviewed the denial of a continuance under the particular\nfacts presented here. Even so, Anthony provides some useful parallels under similar facts.\nThere, defendant moved for a 2-month continuance 18 days before trial so that\ndefendant's counsel of choice, Charles Atwell, could have adequate time to become\ninvolved in the case and prepare for trial. Atwell informed the court he could not accept\nappointment without a continuance. Defendant had already received a previous\ncontinuance. The trial court granted defendant leave to substitute Atwell as counsel but\ndenied the continuance. We found no abuse of discretion in the ruling. 257 Kan. at 1019-\n20.\n                                             100\n\f       Authority from other jurisdictions lends more direct support for Judge Anderson's\nrulings.

Therefore, we hold that the district judge properly\nexercised his lawful discretion by refusing requests for a second continuance to prepare\nthe guilt phase defense.\n\n\n       3. Continuance to Provide Additional Time to Prepare Penalty Phase\n\n       Robinson also contends he was entitled to a continuance so counsel could fully\ndevelop his mitigation defense.\n                                           101\n\f       The problem with Robinson's challenge is he failed to make an adequate proffer as\nto what mitigation evidence would have been developed had Judge Anderson granted a\nsecond continuance. We discussed the movant's duty to make such a proffer in Burnett,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, where defendant requested a continuance in order to prepare a redacted\nand admissible version of the videotaped recording of his police interview. Defendant\nargued the district court's refusal to grant a continuance denied him a defense at trial\nbecause without the video recording, he was unable to impeach law enforcement\ntestimony regarding the interview. However, defendant did not specify \"how [law\nenforcement officer's] testimony was inconsistent with the statements recorded on the\nvideo or even explain how [law enforcement officer's] testimony could have been\nimpeached by the video.\" 300 Kan. at 438. We held that \"[w]ithout specific references to\nhow the video would have bolstered his defense or impeached [law enforcement officer's]\ntestimony, Burnett ha[d] failed to show that 'good cause' supported his request for a\ncontinuance to prepare a redacted version of the video.\" 300 Kan. at 438.\n\n\n       The same principle holds true in the context of sentencing. In State v. Beaman,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">853</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">286</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012), defendant sought a sentencing continuance to\nresearch an Eighth Amendment argument under Jessica's Law that might have applied at\nsentencing. In affirming the denial of continuance, we explained: \"[S]imply arguing that\nthere 'may' be an issue worthy of another motion is insufficient to justify a continuance.\nMere speculation that with more time something favorable may happen for the defendant\ndoes not constitute good cause. [Citation omitted.]\" 295 Kan. at 864.\n\n\n       We thus conclude it would be unacceptably speculative to presume their\npreliminary findings would be consistent with those produced in a final analysis. Here,\nRobinson offered the affidavits of Nerad and Lewis in support of their motions for\ncontinuance to develop mitigation evidence. Both speculated, based on their initial\n                                             102\n\freviews, that Robinson may have suffered abuse as a child and impairment to his mental\nfunctioning. Nevertheless, these findings were preliminary. Both Nerad and Lewis made\nclear that they could not render qualified and reliable opinions on the subjects absent\nfurther investigation. Defense counsel implicitly acknowledged the unreliability of these\nexperts' preliminary findings during posttrial argument, explaining the defense did not\ncall Nerad or Lewis as witnesses because a \"half-baked\" mitigation defense would have\nbeen worse than no defense at all.\n\n\n       Counsel conceded at oral argument that defendant failed to make a proffer of the\nevidence that would have been introduced in the event of a continuance. We cannot find\nfault in Judge Anderson's decisions in the absence of such a showing.

In\nHaney, defendant negotiated an opportunity to pursue a durational sentencing departure\nin exchange for his nolo contendere plea to various sex offenses. Prior to sentencing,\ndefendant sought a 1-month continuance to compensate for delays in funding for a sex\noffender evaluation expert. The trial court denied the motion, erroneously finding that\nsuch an evaluation was not relevant and that defendant could testify to the aberrational\nnature of his crimes without expert testimony. The Court of Appeals held that the district\ncourt abused its discretion but found the error harmless because defendant did not offer\nany evidence in support of the durational departure. We reversed, unable to \"declare that\nthe lost opportunity to present evidence in mitigation of punishment was harmless in this\ncase.\" 299 Kan. at 262.\n\n\n       Robinson's reliance on Haney is misplaced. There, the district court's denial of\ncontinuance was founded on legally erroneous findings, and the Court of Appeal's\ndeclaration that the error was harmless would have deprived defendant of the very benefit\nthat induced him to enter his plea agreement—the opportunity to pursue a durational\ndeparture. No such facts are present here, and Haney does not alter Robinson's duty to\nmake a proffer of the mitigation evidence he would have developed and presented had he\nbeen granted a continuance.\n\n\n                                 3. MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS\n\n\n       Defendant raises five issues related to the district court's denial of his motions to\nsuppress evidence obtained pursuant to pen registers, wiretaps, search warrants, and\nwarrantless trash searches. Specifically, Robinson contends: (1) District Judge Larry\nMcClain was not neutral and detached; (2) he lacked jurisdiction to issue extraterritorial\nsearch warrants; (3) law enforcement officers exceeded their territorial jurisdiction; (4)\n                                             104\n\flaw enforcement officers' trash searches violated defendant's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy; and (5) wiretap orders were issued without a sufficient showing of necessity.\n\n\nAdditional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      1. Judge McClain's Former Prosecution of Robinson\n\n      In the mid-1980s, McClain was a prosecutor in the Johnson County District\nAttorney's office. In 1984, he investigated a consumer complaint filed by the owners of\nBack Care Systems, International (Back Care), alleging Robinson defrauded Back Care\nthrough a bogus invoicing scheme through his company, Equi-plus.\n\n\n       In hopes of avoiding criminal prosecution, Robinson prepared four sham\naffidavits, all purportedly authored by vendors claiming the invoices were genuine. One\naffidavit appeared to be signed by Paula Godfrey, one of several missing persons\nconnected to Robinson. After reviewing the affidavits, McClain told Robinson's attorney,\nRonald Wood, that Robinson was the \"master of the copying machine.\"\n\n\n      On March 29, 1985, McClain filed a criminal complaint, along with a supporting\naffidavit, charging Robinson with one count of felony theft by deception. McClain\nhandled the Back Care case through preliminary hearing on May 29, 1985. On June 10,\nMcClain was appointed to the District Court bench in Johnson County. Steven J.\nObermeier assumed the prosecution of the Back Care case from that point forward.\nObermeier endorsed Godfrey as a witness because she had purportedly signed one of the\nsham affidavits. At the time, Obermeier did not know Robinson was a suspect in\nGodfrey's disappearance.\n\n\n      Obermeier tried the Back Care case in January 1986. The State called Judge\nMcClain as a witness to establish that the affidavits were shams and to lay foundation to\n                                           105\n\fadmit them into evidence. The trial judge, however, limited Judge McClain's testimony to\nfoundation issues only, and Judge McClain did not testify beyond that boundary. The jury\nconvicted Robinson on the theft by deception count.\n\n\n       Just after Robinson's conviction, Obermeier prosecuted a second case against him,\nthe Kuti case, which arose from a phony land deal Robinson concocted to defraud\ninvestors. Judge McClain was endorsed as a witness in the Kuti case because Obermeier\nbelieved Robinson's failure to disclose the Back Care prosecution constituted a material\nomission, an essential element of the securities fraud count pled in that case. Judge\nMcClain had no other involvement in the prosecution of the Kuti case.\n\n\n       Robinson entered a plea agreement in the Kuti case, and the trial judge joined the\nBack Care and Kuti cases for purposes of sentencing. In his sentencing brief, Obermeier\nmade reference to the fact that Robinson was the last person seen with Stasi before her\ndisappearance, but Obermeier had not received this information from Judge McClain.\n\n\n       In September 1987, when Robinson first became eligible, Obermeier filed a\nrecommendation to deny parole. Obermeier attached then-prosecutor McClain's affidavit\nfrom the Back Care case in support of the recommendation. Judge McClain had no\ninvolvement in preparing Obermeier's recommendation.\n\n\n       At the suppression hearing, the parties stipulated that (1) during his tenure with the\nDistrict Attorney's office, McClain had no knowledge that Robinson was a suspect in any\nhomicides or abductions; (2) upon assuming the bench in June 1985, Judge McClain\nexclusively handled a civil docket, with the exception of presiding over various\napplications for search warrants, wiretaps, and pen registers; and (3) once appointed,\nJudge McClain disengaged from all law enforcement-related activities.\n\n\n                                            106\n\f       2. Prosecution's Pursuit of Inquisition, Pen Registers, and Wiretaps\n\n       The Johnson County District Attorney's office regularly submitted wiretap and pen\nregister applications to an administrative or civil judge. After the retirement of the civil\njudge who had historically handled these matters, Judge McClain began receiving the\napplications because he was a civil judge who had familiarity with criminal law.\n\n\n       On March 30, 2000, prosecutor Morrison approached Judge McClain and secured\nan order to open an inquisition. Although it was unusual to approach a civil judge for an\ninquisition, Morrison felt there was a strong possibility he would later request pen\nregisters and wiretaps, so he wanted to begin proceedings with the wiretap judge.\n\n\n       In April 2000, the prosecution secured orders from Judge McClain for pen\nregisters on Robinson's phones.\n\n\n       On May 19, the prosecution submitted a wiretap application to Judge McClain.\nLenexa Police Detective Dave Brown offered a 31-page supporting affidavit containing\nhundreds of averments set forth in 78 separate paragraphs.\n\n\n       The affidavit detailed law enforcement's extensive investigation of Robinson and\ndescribed facts uncovered through the use of a variety of traditional investigatory\ntechniques, including surveillance of witnesses and the defendant, warrantless trash\nsearches, consensual searches, investigatory interviews, inquisitional subpoenas, and\nanalysis of pen register data.\n\n\n       Specifically, the affidavit outlined Robinson's relationship with Trouten, his likely\ninvolvement in her recent disappearance, and his attempts to conceal the same. It\nidentified facts suggesting Robinson had targeted new potential victims in the BDS&M\n\n                                             107\n\fcommunity, including Trouten's friends, Remington and Taylor, as well as J.M. and V.N.\nIt also summarized law enforcement's analysis of pen register data and inquisition\nsubpoenas, which demonstrated that Robinson was dependent on cellular and telephone\ncommunications to develop these relationships and further his criminal conduct.\n\n\n       The affidavit also touched on a few facts that were similar or common to both the\nBack Care case and the Robinson investigation. First, Brown made a passing reference to\nRobinson's convictions in the Back Care and Kuti cases, the former of which Judge\nMcClain handled through the preliminary hearing. Brown also made brief reference to\ntwo companies connected to Robinson, Equi II and Equruz II, that utilized a name similar\nto Equi-plus, Robinson's company implicated in the Back Care case. Finally, the affidavit\nincluded averments describing Robinson's connection to and possible involvement in the\ndisappearance of Paula Godfrey, who allegedly signed one of the sham affidavits in the\nBack Care case.\n\n\n       When prosecutors Morrison and Sara Welch, along with Brown, approached Judge\nMcClain for the wiretap, the judge said he had prosecuted Robinson in a financial crimes\ncase in the early to mid-1980s. Morrison testified that Judge McClain said something to\nthe effect that he \"knew the defendant as a, quote, con man or, quote, shyster,\" but\ncharacterized his comments as very brief and benign. Brown testified that Judge McClain\nsaid only that he had prosecuted Robinson for some financial crimes in the past. Judge\nMcClain did not discuss any specific details about the Back Care case, the witnesses\ninvolved, or any other criminal complaints against Robinson.\n\n\n       3. Search Warrants\n\n       As the investigation progressed, prosecutors approached Judge McClain for search\nwarrants. On June 2, 2000, law enforcement officers secured warrants to search\n\n                                            108\n\fRobinson's Olathe residence and storage locker. The following morning, prosecutors\nsecured a warrant to search Robinson's Linn County property.\n\n\n      The application to search the Linn County property was supported by Brown's\naffidavit, which contained dozens of averments set forth in 35 separate paragraphs\ncovering 10 single-spaced pages. The affidavits for all three search warrants were nearly\nidentical. The first 20 paragraphs described Robinson's connection to Trouten, her\ndisappearance, and Robinson's probable involvement in it. In paragraphs 21-30, Brown\nexplained how Robinson had targeted new women in the BDS&M community. The\naffidavit also included averments establishing probable cause that evidence of Robinson's\ncrimes would be found at each location.\n\n\n      As with the wiretap affidavit, Brown made reference to Robinson's prior\nconvictions in the Back Care and Kuti cases, identified businesses tied to Robinson that\nused a name similar to Equi-plus, and disclosed Robinson's possible connection to the\ndisappearance of Godfrey.\n\n\n      On June 2, 2000, Lenexa police officials contacted Linn County Sheriff Marvin\nStites to discuss plans for executing a search warrant for Robinson's Linn County\nproperty. After securing the warrant, Linn County Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Danciak\narrived at Robinson's Linn County property around 9:30 a.m., just as officers from\nLenexa and Overland Park were arriving. Danciak reviewed and executed a written\nrequest for assistance document drafted by Lenexa police. The document memorialized\nLinn County's request to Lenexa and other agencies for assistance in executing the search\nwarrant. Law enforcement officers began the search after Danciak signed the document.\n\n\n\n\n                                           109\n\f       4. Warrantless Searches of Robinson's Trash\n\n       Before obtaining search warrants, law enforcement officers employed a variety of\ninvestigatory techniques, including searching Robinson's trash placed outside for\ncollection at his Olathe residence. Lenexa Police Detective Michael Bussell drove by\nRobinson's residence 50 to 60 times from March to June 2000, exploring the location,\ndeveloping strategies for collecting Robinson's trash, and coordinating trash pulls on\ncollection days. Lenexa police did not disclose their activities to Olathe police.\n\n\n       Robinson lived inside Santa Barbara Estates, a private mobile home community\nthat maintained its own streets, sidewalks, and lighting. A private trash company,\nDeffenbaugh, regularly entered the community to collect residents' trash. At the\ncommunity's main entrance, there was a \"Santa Barbara Estates\" sign on the south side of\nthe road. Several yards beyond this sign, there was a \"Speed Limit 20\" sign. Just below\nthe speed limit sign, affixed to the same post, was a smaller sign captioned, \"Private\nProperty No Soliciting.\" There were no \"no trespassing\" signs posted within the\ncommunity. Santa Barbara Estates was not a gated community, and there was no physical\nbarrier impeding access into the area. Only transporters hauling mobile homes into or out\nof the community were required to check in before entering. If a person wanted to visit a\nresident, he or she was free to drive into the community, walk up to a resident's home,\nand knock on the resident's door. Olathe police freely entered the community to execute\nwarrants and handle other police business.\n\n\n       Robinson's residence was located 1/4 to 1/2 mile beyond the entrance to Santa\nBarbara Estates. The residence could not be seen, or views of it were limited, from any\nstreet outside Santa Barbara Estates.\n\n\n\n\n                                             110\n\f       Each time a law enforcement officer pulled Robinson's trash, it had been set out\nfor collection in a container placed toward the end of an asphalt parking area, near or\nagainst the curb line, where the parking pad intersected the roadway, approximately 10 to\n12 feet outside of the fence that surrounded the residence. When Bussell saw the trash\ncontainer placed in this location, he would radio another officer to collect it from the\ncontainer. However, on other occasions, a law enforcement officer, after making\narrangements with a security officer at Deffenbaugh, would ride on the trash truck and\ncollect the trash directly or would supervise Deffenbaugh's collection and arrange to pick\nit up at a location away from Santa Barbara Estates.\n\n\nNeutral and Detached Magistrate Challenge\n\n       Robinson argues the evidence seized pursuant to, or as a result of, the four pen\nregisters, one wiretap order, and four search warrants Judge McClain issued in this case\nshould have been suppressed because he was not a neutral and detached magistrate.\n\n\n       1. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       Our standard of review for motions to suppress evidence is well established:\n\n\n               \"An appellate court reviews a district court's decision on a motion to suppress\n       using a bifurcated standard. Without reweighing the evidence, the district court's findings\n       of fact are reviewed to determine whether they are supported by substantial competent\n       evidence. A de novo standard of review is then used to review the ultimate legal\n       conclusion regarding the suppression of evidence.\" State v.

Did Judge McClain lack neutrality and detachment?\n\n       In ruling on Robinson's challenge, the district judge found:\n\n\n               \"In this case, McClain investigated Robinson and filed criminal charges against\n       him for theft on March 29, 1985 in what was referred to at the hearing as the Back Care\n       case (Case No. K48573). As Chief Deputy to the District Attorney at the time, McClain\n       assigned himself the case and handled the matter through the preliminary hearing. Shortly\n       after the preliminary hearing, on June 10, 1985, McClain was appointed to the bench.\n       Another prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Steve Obermeier, took over the case and\n       tried it in Judge McClain's stead. Judge McClain was later called as a witness in the Back\n       Care case to testify as to the delivery of certain affidavits to him from Ron Wood and at\n       the behest of Robinson. A review of the transcripts of those earlier proceedings indicates\n       that McClain was nothing more than a foundation witness to show the chain of custody\n       for the documents in question. McClain testified as to the delivery of the documents only.\n       It was Obermeier that obtained that conviction, handled the sentencing of defendant,\n       opposed defendant's parole, and later filed the charges against Robinson in the Kuti case\n       (Case No. K51711). The parties have stipulated that Judge McClain 'had no knowledge\n       whatsoever concerning the defendant's suspected involvement in any homicides or\n       abductions' and that 'since assuming the bench in June of 1985, Judge McClain has\n       handled a civil docket exclusively and has disengaged from any law enforcement related\n       activities, other than presiding over various applications for search warrants, wiretaps,\n       and pen registers.'\"\n\n\n       The district judge's factual findings are supported by substantial competent\nevidence, and Robinson does not challenge them on appeal. Thus our analysis focuses on\nJudge Anderson's legal conclusion that Judge McClain was neutral and detached.\n\n\n                                                   114\n\f       We have not previously addressed a neutral and detached magistrate challenge\nunder these particular facts.

Then-prosecutor McClain investigated and prosecuted Robinson on\na theft by deception charge related to his fraudulent invoicing practices that defrauded the\nowners of Back Care. In stark contrast, this case involved the investigation and\nprosecution of Robinson 15 years later for kidnapping, sexual battery, and the murders of\nsix female victims.\n\n\n       Robinson does not dispute that the averments in the supporting affidavits\nestablished probable cause for issuance of the pen registers, wiretap orders, and search\nwarrants; and none of the allegedly overlapping facts in the affidavits were material to\n                                             117\n\fJudge McClain's probable cause determinations. The most significant overlapping fact\nwas the affidavits' brief reference to Robinson's convictions in the Back Care and Kuti\ncases. Detective Brown testified that he referenced these cases to bolster other averments\ndescribing Robinson's attempts to conceal his crimes by fabricating letters on behalf of\nthe victims. The element of fraudulent concealment may have been common to both the\nBack Care case and the capital murder investigation, but, as Judge Anderson found, the\nfact that a perpetrator took steps to cover up the crimes is a fact common to most all\ncriminal cases.\n\n\n       Amongst the dozens of averments in the affidavits, the isolated reference to the\nBack Care case bore little weight in the overall assessment of probable cause. The other\nallegedly overlapping facts are even more benign. It is unclear how Godfrey's signature\non a sham affidavit in a financial crimes prosecution would adversely influence Judge\nMcClain's probable cause assessment in this capital murder investigation.

Specifically, Robinson highlights McClain's comment that\nRobinson was a \"master of the copying machine\" and that he knew defendant as a \"con\nman or shyster.\"\n\n\n       The first comment was made to Robinson's defense counsel in the Back Care case\nmore than 15 years before Judge McClain issued the pen registers, wiretap orders, and\nsearch warrants in this case and before he was appointed to the bench. The comment was\nalso reasonably grounded in fact, as Robinson had provided fraudulent affidavits in hopes\nof avoiding prosecution. The comment does not evidence a lack of neutrality and\ndetachment.\n\n\n       The \"con man or shyster\" comment is more troubling when viewed in isolation.\nHowever, Judge McClain made this comment while disclosing his previous investigation\nand prosecution of Robinson in a financial crimes case. Viewed in context, Judge\nMcClain's comment appears to be an inartful description of the nature of the crimes he\nprosecuted rather than a pejorative statement regarding Robinson's character.\n\n\n       The parties stipulated that Judge McClain had completely disengaged from law\nenforcement upon taking the bench in 1985, had had no involvement in any subsequent\ninvestigation or prosecution of Robinson, and had no knowledge of Robinson's possible\n                                           119\n\finvolvement in other missing persons' investigations. Nothing in the record suggests\nJudge McClain considered any information outside the four corners of the applications\nand supporting affidavits, in this case, which provided ample independent support for his\nprobable cause determinations. The comments highlighted by Robinson fail to establish a\nviolation of the neutral and detached magistrate requirement.

In Alderson, we held that a reasonable person would question\nthe trial judge's impartiality where defendant was prosecuted for stealing a car owned by\nthe trial judge's brother. 260 Kan. at 469. Unlike the situation in Alderson, neither Judge\nMcClain nor any member of his family suffered injury or financial loss from Robinson's\nsham affidavits. Robinson delivered the affidavits in hopes of avoiding prosecution, not\nto defraud Judge McClain financially. Robinson's efforts proved unsuccessful and did not\nimpede then-prosecutor McClain's filing of criminal charges. In fact, the sham affidavits\nbolstered the State's case in the Back Care prosecution.

Can district judges issue extraterritorial search warrants?\n\n       Resolution of this challenge requires the court to analyze competing statutory\ninterpretations regarding a district judge's authority to issue extraterritorial search\nwarrants. To do so, we first outline the relevant constitutional and statutory framework.\n\n\n       The Kansas Constitution created the district courts of Kansas and provided that\nthey \"shall have such jurisdiction in their respective districts as may be provided by law.\"\nKan. Const. art. 3, § 6(a) and (b). The legislature, in turn, has provided that district judges\n\"provided for in the Kansas constitution shall have and exercise the full judicial power\nand authority of a district court.\" K.S.A. 20-302. The legislature later created two classes\n                                              121\n\fof \"judges of the district courts\"—district magistrate judges and district judges. K.S.A.\n20-301a. A \"'judge of the district court' means any of such judges.\" K.S.A. 20-301a.\n\n\n       The legislature has defined the general powers and authority of \"judges of the\ndistrict court\" at K.S.A. 20-301a:\n\n\n       \"Such judges shall have the jurisdiction, powers and duties prescribed by this act and\n       otherwise prescribed by law. The judicial power and authority of a judge of the district\n       court in each judicial district may be exercised anywhere within such judicial district and\n       may be exercised anywhere within any other judicial district when assigned to hear any\n       proceeding or try any cause in such judicial district, as provided in K.S.A. 20-319 and\n       amendments thereto.\"\n\n\n       These provisions serve as a general limitation on judges of the district court,\nrequiring that they exercise powers from within the territorial boundaries of their judicial\ndistricts. Verdigris Conservancy District v. Objectors, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 218, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">966</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1930) (\"judicial business is to be done in judicial districts, by district courts and district\njudges acting within and for their respective districts\").\n\n\n       Beyond these general grants of authority, the legislature has specifically defined a\njudicial officer's authority to issue search warrants. The legislature has provided that\nsearch warrants shall be issued by a \"magistrate.\" K.S.A. 22-2502(a). A \"'magistrate'\"\nincludes \"judges of district courts,\" which includes both district magistrate judges and\ndistrict judges. K.S.A. 22-2202(14); K.S.A. 20-301a. However, the legislature has placed\nterritorial limits on the execution of search warrants issued by a district magistrate judge.\n\n\n               \"Search warrants issued by a district magistrate judge may be executed only\n       within the judicial district in which said judge resides or within the judicial district to\n       which said judge has been assigned pursuant to K.S.A. 20-319.\" K.S.A. 22-2503.\n\n                                                    122\n\fImportantly, the legislature placed no such territorial limitation on search warrants issued\nby district judges. See K.S.A. 22-2502 and 22-2503.\n\n\n       Judge McClain was a district judge in Johnson County, the lone county in the\nTenth Judicial District. He issued a warrant from within the territorial boundaries of the\nTenth Judicial District to search Robinson's Linn County property, located in the Sixth\nJudicial District. In his motion to suppress and on appeal, Robinson argues K.S.A. 20-\n301a, which permits a \"judge of the district court\" to exercise judicial powers anywhere\nwithin the territorial boundaries of the judicial district, prevented Judge McClain from\nissuing the extraterritorial search warrant. Judge Anderson denied defendant's motion to\nsuppress, finding the legislature intended to grant district judges authority to issue search\nwarrants executable statewide under K.S.A. 22-2503 by placing territorial limits on\nsearch warrants issued by district magistrate judges only.\n\n\n       The resolution of these competing statutory interpretations lies within the history\nof the pertinent statutes. We begin with the search warrant statutes, which predate the\nlegislature's enactment of K.S.A. 20-301a. K.S.A. 22-2502 and 22-2503 authorize judges\nof the district court to issue search warrants, but K.S.A. 22-2503 places territorial limits\non the execution of warrants issued by district magistrate judges. This was not always the\ncase. K.S.A. 62-1830 (Corrick), the predecessor to K.S.A. 22-2502 and 22-2503,\nformerly provided:\n\n\n               \"'A warrant shall issue upon affidavit or upon oral testimony given under oath\n       and recorded before the magistrate or judge.

Rejecting the challenge, Lamb held that K.S.A.\n62-1830 granted both magistrates and judges the authority to issue search warrants\nexecutable statewide. Lamb reasoned that by directing a magistrate or judge to deliver the\nwarrant to any peace officer of the state of Kansas, the statute implied that \"a search\nwarrant issued by a magistrate within the confines of his [or her] jurisdiction, can be\nserved anywhere within the state of Kansas.\" 209 Kan. at 469.\n\n\n       In 1970, the legislature repealed K.S.A. 62-1830 and enacted K.S.A. 22-2503 as\npart of the codification of the Kansas Criminal Code. L. 1970, ch. 129, sec. 22-2503.\nUnlike former K.S.A. 62-1830, K.S.A. 22-2503 expressly provided that \"[s]earch\nwarrants issued by courts of limited jurisdiction may be executed only within the\nterritorial limits of the county in which the court is located.\" L. 1970, ch. 129, sec. 22-\n2503. As discussed below, this statute was later amended to specifically apply the\nterritorial restriction to district magistrate judges only.\n\n\n       However, the legislature did not wholly abandon the language in K.S.A. 62-1830\nfrom which Lamb inferred the authority to issue extraterritorial warrants, i.e., that\nwarrants be \"directed to any peace officer of the state of Kansas.\" Instead, it incorporated\nsubstantially similar language into new section 2505, providing that \"[a] search warrant\nshall be issued in duplicate and shall be directed for execution to all law enforcement\n\n\n                                                   124\n\fofficers of the state, or to any law enforcement officer specifically named therein.\"\n(Emphasis added.) L. 1970, ch. 129, sec. 22-2505.\n\n\n       Through these 1970 amendments, the legislature eliminated the authority of courts\nof limited jurisdiction to issue extraterritorial search warrants; it imposed no similar\nlimitation on district judges; and it retained in K.S.A. 22-2505, the language from which\nLamb inferred the authority of judges to issue extraterritorial warrants. Viewed together,\nthese amendments provide persuasive support for the view that the legislature intended to\ngrant district judges authority to issue search warrants executable statewide.\n\n\n       The 1970 amendments alone do not explain the legislature's subsequent enactment\nof K.S.A. 20-301a in 1976. But, the legislative history surrounding this enactment\nsuggests strongly that it was never intended to restrict district judges' authority to issue\nextraterritorial search warrants.\n\n\n       On April 14, 1976, the legislature approved House Bill 2729, resulting in the\nenactment of K.S.A. 20-301a. L. 1976, ch. 146, sec. 10. In this bill, the legislature\ndefined \"judges of the district court\" to include district judges and district magistrate\njudges and granted them authority to exercise their powers from anywhere within their\njudicial districts.\n\n\n       Eight days later, on April 22, 1976, the legislature passed House Bill 3186,\namending K.S.A. 22-2503 as follows:\n\n\n               \"Search warrants issued by courts of limited jurisdiction a district magistrate\n       judge may be executed only within the territorial limits of the county in which the court is\n       located said judge resides.\" L. 1976, ch. 163, sec. 3.\n\n\n\n                                                   125\n\f       The legislature's 1976 amendment to K.S.A. 22-2503 was a response to its earlier\napproval of K.S.A. 20-301a, which created district magistrate judges as one of two\nclasses of judges of the district court. The amendment to K.S.A. 22-2503 reflected this\nnew classification by substituting \"a district magistrate judge\" in place of \"courts of\nlimited jurisdiction.\" Had the legislature intended K.S.A. 20-301a to limit a district\njudge's authority to issue extraterritorial search warrants, it would have included all\nclasses of \"judges of the district court\" in its amendment of K.S.A. 22-2503 or repealed\nthis section altogether. Instead, it chose to place the territorial limitation on the execution\nof search warrants issued by \"a district magistrate judge\" only.\n\n\n       Three years later, the legislature adopted House Bill 2046, which amended K.S.A.\n22-2503 to clarify that search warrants issued by a district magistrate judge were\nexecutable within the \"judicial district\" rather than the \"territorial limits of the county\" in\nwhich the judge resides. L. 1979, ch. 96, sec. 1. Once again, such an amendment would\nhave been wholly unnecessary had the legislature intended K.S.A. 20-301a to limit the\nauthority of judges of the district courts to issue extraterritorial search warrants\naltogether.\n\n\n       Robinson's construction of K.S.A. 20-301a as a limitation on district judges'\nauthority to issue extraterritorial warrants would render the legislature's 1976 adoption of\nHouse Bill 3186 and 1979 adoption of House Bill 2046 meaningless. In fact, it would\nrender the entirety of K.S.A. 22-2503 altogether superfluous. See State v. LaGrange, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">623</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl. ¶ 1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012) (courts shall \"presume that the legislature does\nnot intend to enact useless, superfluous, or meaningless legislation\").\n\n\n       The defendant's construction of K.S.A. 20-301a also fails to give meaning to other\nprovisions within Article 25 of the Kansas Code of Criminal Procedure. For example, the\n                                              126\n\fstatute authorizing installation or use of pen registers or trap and trace devices expressly\nlimits a judge's ability to issue extraterritorial orders authorizing the use of such\nmonitoring devices. K.S.A. 22-2527(1). The legislature enacted this statute in 1988,\nsubsequent to the 1976 enactment of K.S.A. 20-301a. L. 1988, ch. 117, sec. 8. Likewise,\nthe wiretap statute limits a judge's ability to issue extraterritorial orders authorizing\nelectronic interception of communications. K.S.A. 22-2516(3). Once again, had the\nlegislature intended K.S.A. 20-301a to serve as a general limitation on a district judge's\njurisdiction to issue orders and warrants to be executed outside the judge's home district,\nthen the express provisions doing so under the pen register and wiretap statutes would\nhave been unnecessary.\n\n\n       When K.S.A. 22-2503 and 22-2505 are read together and considered against the\nhistory and developments subsequent to the 1970 codification, it is evident the legislature\nintended for district judges to retain their pre-code authority to issue search warrants\nexecutable statewide, while simultaneously revoking district magistrate judges' pre-\ncodification authority to do so.

K.S.A. 20-301a requires judges of the district court to exercise their\npowers within the territorial boundaries of their judicial districts. Applied here, K.S.A.\n20-301a required Judge McClain to issue the search warrant from a location within\nJohnson County. More generally, K.S.A. 20-301a continues to prevent judges of the\ndistrict courts from trying cases or conducting judicial proceedings outside the\nboundaries of their judicial districts, absent proper assignment under K.S.A. 20-319.\n\n\n       Robinson argues K.S.A. 20-301a, as the more recent legislative act, controls over\nLamb and K.S.A. 22-2503 and 22-2505.

However, as discussed above, 1 week after the legislature approved the bill\nresulting in the enactment of K.S.A. 20-301a, it adopted amendments to K.S.A. 22-2503,\n                                             128\n\fclarifying that only district magistrate judges are precluded from issuing extraterritorial\nwarrants. Defendant's argument fails to account for this sensible pattern of legislative\naction.\n\n\n          Furthermore, as explained in Englund, \"here we have a conflict between a general\nprinciple of law (K.S.A. 20-301a) and a more specific enactment dealing not with the\noverall jurisdiction of judges, but their specific jurisdiction in issuing search warrants\n(K.S.A. 22-2505). In this situation, the more specific statute controls.\" 50 Kan. App. 2d at\n135. Also, because K.S.A. 22-2503 and 22-2505 were enacted together, address the same\nsubject, and are contained in Article 25, Search and Seizure, of the Kansas Code of\nCriminal Procedure, they are in pari materia and must be construed together and brought\ninto harmony.

See K.S.A. 22-2305(2); K.S.A. 22-3214. Defendant suggests this\nlanguage would be unnecessary if district judges had authority to act beyond the\nterritorial limits set out by K.S.A. 20-301a. However, Robinson's argument fails to\naccount for the fact that the legislature enacted the arrest warrant and subpoena statutes in\n1970, prior to the 1976 enactment of K.S.A. 20-301a. The argument also begs the\nquestion whether the legislature intended to grant district judges the same extraterritorial\nauthority for search warrants when it repealed K.S.A. 62-1830 and enacted K.S.A. 22-\n2502, 22-2503, and 22-2505.\n\n\n\n\n                                              129\n\f       Robinson also cites State v.

There, defendant argued city police officers exceeded their authority\nby executing a search warrant beyond their territorial boundaries defined in K.S.A. 22-\n2401a. The State argued K.S.A. 22-2505 gave law enforcement officers power to execute\nwarrants outside their jurisdiction, creating an exception to a law enforcement officer's\nterritorial limitation under K.S.A. 22-2401a. We held that K.S.A. 22-2505 was a general\nstatute providing that search warrants shall be executed by law enforcement officers and\nhad nothing to do with their territorial jurisdiction. 255 Kan. at 84. Based on this\nrationale, Robinson argues that the territorial limits on district judges in K.S.A. 22-301a,\nlike the territorial limits on law enforcement officers in K.S.A. 22-2401a, prohibit\nextraterritorial search warrants, and just as K.S.A. 22-2505 has nothing to do with the\nterritorial jurisdiction of officers, it likewise has nothing to do with the territorial\njurisdiction of district judges.\n\n\n       However, Sodders examined the statutory scheme governing law enforcement\nofficers' territorial jurisdiction, not judges of the district courts. Furthermore, contrary to\nRobinson's assertion, Lamb held that language substantially similar to K.S.A. 22-2505\nwas relevant to defining a judge's authority to issue extraterritorial warrants. 209 Kan. at\n469. In fact, in his dissenting opinion in Sodders, Justice Lockett agreed with our\nconstruction of K.S.A. 22-2503 in dicta, acknowledging the territorial limitation on\nextraterritorial search warrants applied to district magistrate judges only. 255 Kan. at 87\n(Lockett, J., dissenting). Sodders is inapposite.\n\n\n       We likewise agree with the construction adopted by the panel of the Court of\nAppeals in Englund, which is more consistent with the legislative background and history\nand better harmonizes the relevant statutory scheme.See State v.

In particular, defendant\ncontends Lenexa and/or Overland Park police exceeded their territorial jurisdiction by:\n(1) conducting warrantless trash searches at his Olathe residence; (2) executing the\nwarrant to search his Linn County property; and (3) executing warrants to search his\nOlathe residence and storage units.\n\n\n       As set forth in the previous section, we review Judge Anderson's factual findings\nfor substantial competent evidence and his legal conclusions de novo.\n\n\n       1. Did the trash searches violate K.S.A. 22-2401a?\n\n       On numerous occasions, members of the Lenexa Police Department (LPD)\ntraveled beyond the Lenexa city limits to conduct warrantless searches and seizures of\ntrash left for collection outside Robinson's Olathe residence. Because LPD conducted this\ninvestigative work beyond its territorial jurisdiction, Robinson believes evidence derived\nfrom the trash pulls should have been suppressed.\n\n\n       K.S.A. 22-2401a provides, in relevant part:\n\n\n               \"(2) Law enforcement officers employed by any city may exercise their powers\n       as law enforcement officers:\n               (a) Anywhere within the city limits of the city employing them and outside of\n       such city when on property owned or under the control of such city. \"\n\n\n\n                                                 131\n\fThe statute includes several exceptions, none of which are applicable to law\nenforcement's trash pulls. A \"law enforcement officer\" is \"any person who by virtue of\noffice or public employment is vested by law with a duty to maintain public order or to\nmake arrests for violation of the laws of the state of Kansas or ordinances of any\nmunicipality . . . .\" See K.S.A. 22-2202(13); K.S.A. 22-2401a(10)(a).\n\n\n       There is no dispute that LPD officers conducted trash searches beyond their\nterritorial jurisdiction. The question is whether they were exercising their powers as law\nenforcement officers in doing so. Judge Anderson found LPD officers were not acting\nunder the color of office and this activity fell beyond the scope of K.S.A. 22-2401a. We\ndisagree.\n\n\n       LPD officers were not acting as private citizens when they conducted the trash\npulls. They contacted the private trash hauler's security officer to obtain the company's\ncooperation and assistance. They commandeered the company's trash truck to collect\ndefendant's trash and/or made arrangements for the private hauler to segregate\ndefendant's trash and meet LPD officers at an agreed location to deliver it. The powers of\na law enforcement officer include those \"necessary to permit the city officer to meet his\nor her common-law duty to the public to preserve the peace.\" State v.

Appx. 332 (4th Cir. 2014) (unpublished opinion).\n\n\n       Based on LPD officers' planning and coordination with the private trash\ncontractor, along with their collaborative efforts to successfully complete these trash pulls\nover the course of several weeks, we conclude LPD officers were not acting exclusively\nas private citizens but, instead, exercised \"powers as law enforcement officers\" under\nthese particular facts. See K.S.A. 22-2401a.\n\n\n       Acknowledging a violation of K.S.A. 22-2401a, the question turns to the\nappropriate remedy, if any. In Sodders, 255 Kan. at 84, despite the absence of any federal\nor state constitutional violation, the court affirmed the suppression of evidence where\nOverland Park police officers exceeded their territorial jurisdiction by executing a search\nwarrant within the municipal boundaries of Lenexa.\n\n\n\n\n                                              133\n\f       However, the Sodders majority did not specifically analyze or address the\nremedies available under K.S.A. 22-2401a. More recently, in Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 808-14,\nwe explored what, if any, remedy was available to defendant under K.S.A. 22-2401a.\nThere, city law enforcement officers violated the statute by organizing and carrying out a\ncontrolled drug buy outside their municipal boundaries. Neither the exclusionary rule,\napplicable to unconstitutional searches or seizures, nor the statutory provision for\nsuppressing illegally seized evidence, K.S.A. 22-3216, applied because officers did not\nconduct an illegal search or seizure. Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 810-11. Therefore we considered\nwhether suppression was an individual remedy available under K.S.A. 22-2401a. 301\nKan. at 811-14. Distinguishing Sodders based on the absence of any search or seizure, we\nheld that suppression is generally not required where city officers exercise police\npowers—\"other than search and seizure\"—outside their municipal jurisdiction. Vrabel,\n301 Kan. at 813-14.\n\n\n       Unlike Vrabel, LPD officers' conduct did involve searches and seizures carried out\nin violation of K.S.A. 22-2401a. Yet defendant's challenge is based on a violation of state\nstatute, not the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution or § 15 of the\nKansas Constitution Bill of Rights. Thus, application of the exclusionary rule does not\ninevitably follow unless the legislature has enacted such a compulsory remedy. See\nUnited States v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1999) (search conducted in violation of\nK.S.A. 22-2401a did not warrant application of exclusionary rule); 2 LaFave, Israel, King\n& Kerr, Criminal Procedure § 3.1(e), pp. 30-32 (3d ed. 2007) (searches invalid on state\nlaw grounds do not invariably require suppression of evidence).\n\n\n       Kansas statute provides a vehicle for defendants to move for the suppression of\nevidence seized in violation of law. K.S.A. 22-3216(1) provides that a defendant\n\"aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure may move . . . to suppress as evidence\nanything so obtained.\" However, it does not compel the trial court to grant that remedy\n                                            134\n\ffor any search conducted in violation of state statute in particular. Compare K.S.A. 22-\n3216(1) with Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann. art. 38.23 (West 2005) (\"No evidence obtained\nby an officer or other person in violation of any provisions of the Constitution or laws of\nthe State of Texas, or of the Constitution or laws of the United States of America, shall be\nadmitted in evidence against the accused on the trial of any criminal case.\").\n\n\n       In the absence of the statutory equivalent to the federal exclusionary rule, we\nconsider whether the legislature intended to create individual rights or remedies under\nK.S.A. 22-2401a. See 1 LaFave, Search & Seizure, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment\n§ 1.5(b), pp. 210-12 (5th ed. 2012) (where search challenged on state law grounds, courts\nexamine underlying state statute and legislative intent to determine if suppression is an\navailable remedy); 2 LaFave, Israel, King & Kerr, Criminal Procedure § 3.1(e), pp. 30-32\n(exclusion may be an available remedy for search that violates state law where remedy is\nprovided by statute or statute confers a substantial right, especially one related to Fourth\nAmendment protections).\n\n\n       We addressed this question in Vrabel and found the purpose of K.S.A. 2014 Supp.\n22-2401a was to protect local autonomy, not to create individual rights.\n\n\n       \"[I]t is apparent that the statutory limitations on the jurisdiction of city officers was put in\n       place to protect the local autonomy of neighboring cities and counties, rather than to\n       create an individual right, assuring that a person could only be caught breaking the law by\n       an officer of the jurisdiction within which the crime was being committed.\" 301 Kan. at\n       813.\n\n\nBecause the statute does not vest defendant with any substantive right, it logically follows\nthat suppression of evidence is not an individual remedy available to defendant. Nor can\nRobinson reasonably claim he suffered injury to any substantial right based on the fact\nthat LPD officers, rather than Olathe police, conducted the otherwise lawful trash pulls.\n                                                     135\n\f       We hold that suppression of the evidence seized during LPD officers' trash pulls is\nnot a remedy available to Robinson. See Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 813-14 (suppression of\nevidence not a remedy under K.S.A. 2014 Supp. 22-2401a, \"especially . . . in\ncircumstances . . . where the defendant has not been prejudiced in the least by\" the\nexercise of law enforcement powers). In so holding, we do not suggest exclusion of\nevidence is never a remedy available for a search or seizure conducted in violation of\nstate law. However, where a search is conducted in violation of state statute only and the\nstatute violated does not vest defendant with an individual right, does not contemplate\nexclusion of evidence as a remedy, and the violation results in no cognizable injury to\ndefendant's substantial rights, such a remedy is unavailable.\n\n\n       2. Did the Linn County search violate K.S.A. 22-2401a?\n\n       Under the same statutory authority, Robinson argues LPD officers exceeded their\njurisdiction by executing the warrant to search Robinson's property in Linn County.\n\n\n       The relevant facts are not in dispute. The LPD was in charge of the investigation\nand secured a warrant from a Johnson County district judge to search Robinson's property\nin Linn County. Before obtaining the warrant, LPD discussed the search with the Linn\nCounty Sheriff's Department (LCSD). Before commencing the search, a LCSD deputy\nsigned a document memorializing LCSD's request for assistance from LPD and other\nagencies in executing the warrant.\n\n\n       Kansas statute requires city police officers to exercise their police powers within\nthe territorial boundaries of their employing municipality. K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(a).\nHowever, this general rule is subject to an exception where law enforcement officers\nreceive a request for assistance from another jurisdiction:\n\n                                            136\n\f               \"(2) Law enforcement officers employed by any city may exercise their powers\n       as law enforcement officers:\n               (a) Anywhere within the city limits of the city employing them . . .; and\n               (b) in any other place when a request for assistance has been made by law\n       enforcement officers from that place . . . .\" K.S.A. 22-2401a(2).\n\n\n       Robinson argues this exception does not apply because LCSD's request for\nassistance was not genuine, evidenced by the fact that LCSD did not draft the written\nrequest, did not secure the search warrant, had no prior involvement in the investigation,\nand did not play a lead role during the search. We disagree.\n\n\n       On its face, K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(b) requires only that law enforcement officers\nfrom the host jurisdiction make a request for assistance. See Zimmerman v.

However, unlike the situation here, in those\ncases law enforcement from the foreign jurisdiction never received a request for\nassistance from the host jurisdiction. Moreover, nothing in Hennessee, Sodders, or Rowe\nsuggests that there must be a genuine need for the requested assistance or that, if the\nrequest is reduced to writing, it must be drafted by the host jurisdiction. In contrast, Ross\nmakes clear that the plain language of K.S.A. 22-2401a(2)(b) imposes no such\nrequirements.\n\n\n       3. Did Johnson County searches violate K.S.A. 22-2401a ?\n\n       Finally, Robinson contends the LPD and Overland Park Police Department\n(OPPD) lacked territorial jurisdiction to execute the warrants to search Robinson's\nresidence and storage unit located within the territorial boundaries of the city of Olathe.\n\n\n       However, in 1994, the legislature approved Senate Bill 742, which amended\nK.S.A. 22-2401a (Ensley 1988) to expand the territorial jurisdiction of law enforcement\nofficers in Johnson County when executing arrest and search warrants. L. 1994, ch. 286,\nsec 1. As enacted, the expanded statute of jurisdiction provides:\n\n\n                \"(5) In addition to the areas where law enforcement officers may exercise their\n       powers pursuant to subsection (2), law enforcement officers of any jurisdiction within\n       Johnson or Sedgwick county may exercise their powers as law enforcement officers in\n       any area within the respective county when executing a valid arrest warrant or search\n       warrant, to the extent necessary to execute such warrants.\" (Emphasis added.) K.S.A. 22-\n       2401a(5).\n\n\n       Robinson argues the phrase \"to the extent necessary to execute such warrants\"\nrequires the State to prove Olathe police had a genuine need for LPD's and OPPD's\ninvolvement in the execution of these warrants. Absent proof that the Olathe Police\n\n                                                  138\n\fDepartment lacked the ability or capacity to execute the warrants independently,\nRobinson believes the statutory exception cannot apply.\n\n\n       Robinson's construction is inconsistent with the plain meaning of K.S.A. 22-\n2401a(5). The subsection begins with a legislative grant of jurisdiction to law\nenforcement officers in Johnson County, allowing them to execute warrants countywide.\nThe legislature's use of the phrase \"when executing a valid . . . search warrant\"\ndemonstrates this grant of jurisdiction is not subject to any condition precedent. The\nphrase \"to the extent required to execute such warrants\" modifies and limits the type of\npolice powers officers may exercise \"when\" executing warrants outside their municipal\nboundaries, i.e., those powers incidental to the execution of the warrants. K.S.A. 22-\n2401a(5). The phrase does not limit the officers' jurisdiction to execute the warrants in\nthe first instance.\n\n\n       This plain meaning is consistent with the history and context that gave rise to the\nlegislature's enactment of K.S.A. 22-2401a(5). In Sodders, the court held that OPPD\nofficers lacked territorial jurisdiction to execute a search warrant within Lenexa city\nlimits, and the mere presence of LPD officers, even at the request of OPPD, did not\nsatisfy the request for assistance exception. 255 Kan. at 84. Only 10 days later, the\nlegislature enacted Senate Bill 742, enacting K.S.A. 22-2401a(5). L. 1994, ch. 286, sec.\n1. The amendment was a legislative response to Sodders designed \"to allow law\nenforcement officers of any jurisdiction within Johnson County or Sedgwick County to\nexercise their powers as law enforcement officers in any area within the respective\ncounty when executing a search warrant.\" Vrabel, 301 Kan. at 807; see State v.

Did the application and affidavit satisfy the necessity requirement?\n\n\n       In Section VIII of the wiretap application, prosecutor Morrison and Detective\nBrown (Applicants) set forth allegations to satisfy the necessity requirement. The\napplication describes with particularity reasons why infiltration by undercover agents was\nunlikely to succeed and was too dangerous, given Robinson's desire to solicit women to\nserve as \"slaves\" in BDS&M relationships and his connection to the disappearance of\nother missing women. Applicants explained how the use of informants was likely to be\nunsuccessful because they knew of no informants, other than women who were already\ninvolved with Robinson and could not be trusted to maintain confidences. The applicants\nalso explained that continued surveillance would confirm overt acts but was unlikely to\nyield physical evidence or disclose coconspirator involvement, Robinson's modus\noperandi, or the specific nature of Robinson's relationship with the women he recruited.\n                                            145\n\fApplicants warned that further use of interviews and inquisitional subpoenas might alert\nRobinson to the investigation. Applicants believed more pen register data could\ndocument Robinson's contacts but would not reveal the content of his communications.\n\n\n       As for search warrants, applicants stated that they \"would not provide sufficient\nevidence . . . to accomplish the goals of this investigation.\" Applicants defined those\ngoals to include:\n\n\n       \"a.    [G]athering sufficient evidence to successfully prosecute John E. Robinson and\n              others yet unknown for the murder and kidnapping of Suzette Trouten.\n       \"b.    Identify[ing] future kidnapping victims targeted by John Robinson and\n              gather[ing] sufficient information to intervene and prevent harm to any future\n              victims.\"\n\n\n       The application also incorporated by reference the averments set forth in Detective\nBrown's 31-page supporting affidavit. This affidavit set out findings uncovered through\nlaw enforcement's witness interviews, inquisitional subpoenas, extensive surveillance,\ntrash pulls, analysis of pen register data, public record searches, consent searches, and\nother investigative practices.\n\n\n       In particular, Brown explained Robinson had been implicated in the disappearance\nof several women dating back to the mid-1980s; he enticed them into sexual\nrelationships, often involving BDS&M, and lured them to Johnson County with offers of\nemployment, travel, and financial gain; he had done the same with Suzette Trouten; and\nsince her disappearance had targeted new women using a similar modus operandi. Brown\nexplained that Robinson used his cell phone extensively and it was instrumental in his\nefforts to solicit and maintain relationships with these women—a conclusion supported\nby findings from LPD officers' extensive surveillance, use of inquisitional subpoenas, and\nanalysis of pen register data.

Nguyen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"687664\"><a href=\"/opinion/687664/united-states-v-michael-quoc-anh-nguyen/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">781</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 783 (8th Cir.\n                                                146\n\f1995) (necessity requirement satisfied where affidavit showed targets of investigation\nwere dangerous, difficult to infiltrate, and conducted most of their crimes over the\ntelephone; and government had tried using pen registers, confidential informants,\nsurveillance, and garbage searches before pursuing wiretap).\n\n\n       Robinson does not dispute that applicants satisfied the necessity requirement in\ndiscussing several traditional investigative techniques. However, he suggests the\napplicants' boilerplate statement that search warrants would not effectively advance the\ngoals of the investigation was insufficient and invalidates the wiretap order. We disagree.\n\n\n       The majority of courts have not construed the necessity requirement in such a\nstrict, technical fashion. The statute \"does not impose upon the government an exhaustion\nrequirement but rather requires the government to establish that it first made a 'reasonable\ngood faith effort' to utilize other available normal and less intrusive investigative\ntechniques before resorting to a wiretap.

JURY SELECTION\n\n\n       Defendant raises eight different issues related to the jury selection process,\nincluding: (1) whether Judge Anderson improperly curtailed voir dire questioning; (2)\nwhether he erroneously denied defense challenges for cause; (3) whether he made\ndisparate rulings on similarly situated challenges for cause; (4) whether he improperly\ndenied a motion to strike a small group voir dire panel exposed to Juror 173's\ninflammatory remarks; (5) whether he improperly retained five panelists in light of\nalleged juror-specific bias; (6) whether he erred by excusing Juror 253 based on her\nopposition to the death penalty; (7) whether jury selection was tainted by alleged\nprosecutorial misconduct; and (8) whether the anonymous jury selection procedure was\nunlawful. We address each challenge in turn.\n\n\nScope of Voir Dire\n\n       1. Standard of Review and Legal Framework\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson improperly curtailed the scope of voir dire in\nfour respects, each of which he characterizes as separate claims. First, he contends Judge\nAnderson violated Kansas law by prohibiting case-specific questions regarding panelists'\nability to consider a life sentence. Second, he argues the same limitation violated his\nconstitutional rights. Third, he believes this limitation impaired his ability to identify\n                                             150\n\fmitigation-impaired jurors, violating state and federal law. Finally, he claims Judge\nAnderson improperly limited questioning on his prior terms of incarceration.\n\n\n       We apply the following standard of review to scope of voir dire challenges:\n\n       \"Generally the nature and scope of the voir dire examination is entrusted to the sound\n       discretion of the trial court. Manning, 270 Kan. at 691.

To frame the issue properly, it is important to understand\nJudge Anderson's rulings pertaining to the scope of voir dire and the events giving rise to\nthem.\n\n\n        At the outset of the second phase of jury selection, small group voir dire, defense\ncounsel injected case-specific facts into his line of questioning, specifically disclosing\nthat Robinson had been charged with capital murder involving the killings of six women,\nincluding two 19 year olds, one of whom was in a wheelchair. The State objected,\narguing defense counsel was improperly staking out jurors (\"staking\" jurors is the\npractice of asking case-specific questions designed to commit prospective jurors to a\nparticular vote or to disclose how they would vote when faced with certain case-specific\nfacts). Judge Anderson overruled the objection, explaining defense counsel was entitled\nto go into the factual basis of the charges to the extent it was consistent with the\nanticipated trial evidence or reported media facts. However, Judge Anderson cautioned\ndefense counsel not to phrase such questions in a manner intended to elicit a commitment\nor promise from prospective jurors.\n\n\n\n\n                                             152\n\f       Defense counsel continued to disclose case-specific facts and incorporate them\ninto questioning throughout the first 2 days of the second phase of jury selection, where\nthe parties examined prospective jurors in panels of six on topics of pretrial publicity and\nthe death penalty. During this time, defense counsel also began to incorporate case-\nspecific facts into questions about how prospective jurors would decide the sentencing\nissue. For example, Robinson's counsel began to ask how much weight jurors would\nassign to a defendant's background and whether this type of mitigation evidence would be\nsufficient to warrant a life sentence.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson grew increasingly concerned that Robinson's line of questioning\nwas staking out the jury—a concern compounded by the fact that jurors were answering\nthese questions devoid of any knowledge of the law governing the sentencing decision.\nOn the morning of September 20, 2002, after completing 2 full days of small group voir\ndire, Judge Anderson established new guidelines for handling case-specific questions. He\nmade clear that defense counsel could continue to disclose potentially inflammatory case-\nspecific facts, including information regarding the victims, to determine whether they\nrendered potential jurors biased. However, Judge Anderson believed the case-specific\nquestioning should be compartmentalized, raising those facts during questions about bias\nrather than sentencing. Defense counsel objected, saying several veniremembers had\nexpressed in questionnaire responses that a person who committed crimes involving\ncertain case-specific facts deserved to die. Thus the defense believed that inflammatory\ncase-specific facts were \"inextricably intertwined\" with the sentencing issue.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson clarified:\n\n               \"I want to make it very clear. I am not prohibiting the defense from going into the\n       basic sketch of the factual allegations in the fashion that [defense counsel] gave the other\n       day. I am requiring that that not be rolled into and brought up in the midst of a\n       comparison between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, because I do believe\n                                                   153\n\f       that the fashion which it's been raised during the last session Wednesday is tantamount to\n       testing the jury to determine whether the specific, albeit very brief, factual allegations of\n       the State would be weighed by the jury against the very generic mitigating circumstance\n       without the factual comparison which we can't do because we are essentially getting into\n       taking a vote on death penalty issues when we start doing that which would produce a\n       juror that essentially would vote favorably for the defense and we are staking out the jury\n       when we get to that point.\n               \"I want you both to thoroughly explore the attitudes of the jury under\n       Witherspoon. But I don't want to get into a determination during voir dire as to what this\n       individual juror's position is on it and how they would vote on it and how much weight\n       they would attach and whether that's over the threshold of overcoming the aggravating\n       circumstance which is what I think you were getting into the other day. That's why I'm\n       requiring that that factual basis be brought up during the portion of the voir dire. They're\n       entitled to know it and you said to almost all of them, 'Do you know what the factual\n       allegations are?' The process that we went through the other day did produce numbers of\n       jurors who said they just didn't think there was anything that was going to convince them\n       not to vote for the death penalty because of the factual allegations of the case.\n               \"The defendant's voir dire has been effective in determining those jurors who\n       cannot do this process of giving meaningful consideration to mitigating circumstances,\n       and I do not believe this is contrary to the Constitution or to the case law counsel is\n       citing. I stand by my ruling in that regard.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       After the district judge ruled, defense counsel continued to inform prospective\njurors of the alleged case-specific facts they believed to be most inflammatory or which\nhad the greatest potential to create bias among members of the venire, including the fact\nthat multiple people were murdered, along with the gender, age, and disability status of\nthe victims. After disclosing the case-specific allegations, defense counsel consistently\nasked prospective jurors whether they could remain impartial.\n\n\n       In several instances, defense counsel asked these case-specific questions in the\ncontext of sentencing. For example, defense counsel asked Juror 283 whether she could\n\n                                                    154\n\frealistically consider a life sentence knowing the victims in this case were women, after\nher questionnaire responses expressed that people who prey on innocent women are sick\nand evil. Similarly, Juror 177 disclosed in questionnaire responses his belief that people\nwho prey on weaker victims should be punished severely. Defense counsel explored the\npossibility that this view would control his sentencing decision given that all of\nRobinson's alleged victims were women, including one confined to a wheelchair. While\nexploring death penalty views with Juror 542, Robinson's counsel asked whether as a\nfather of a young daughter, this juror could serve impartially, knowing Robinson was\ncharged with killing young, teenage women. Defense counsel asked Juror 484 whether\nher work counseling sex abuse victims would prevent her from serving impartially, given\nthe State's allegations of Robinson's violence against women and his participation in\nBDS&M activity. Defense counsel asked Juror 398 whether he could vote for a life\nsentence in a case involving a serial killer based on his questionnaire responses\nsuggesting that life imprisonment would not be an appropriate punishment in that\ninstance. Defense counsel employed similar lines of questioning with Jurors 463, 398,\nand 366.\n\n\n          Judge Anderson also allowed the defense to utilize case-specific questioning\nduring the third phase of jury selection, general voir dire. During this phase, Robinson's\ncounsel asked panel members whether certain case-specific facts, including violence\nagainst women, BDS&M activity, adultery, gruesome photographs, and other case-\nspecific evidence anticipated at trial would render them incapable of serving as impartial\njurors.\n\n\n          Robinson identifies only two instances relevant to this claim where the trial court\nenforced its ruling and limited the scope of inquiry. The first occurred during defense\ncounsel's questioning of prospective Juror 205, and the second occurred during defense\ncounsel's questioning of Juror 246. A review of the transcript confirms that in both\n                                               155\n\finstances, defense counsel's questions invited these panelists to compare the various\ntheories or categories of aggravation and mitigation that were likely to be at issue in the\ncase and discuss how such evidence would affect their sentencing decision, i.e., staked\nout the jury.\n\n\n       Short of such a line of inquiry, Judge Anderson did not substantially limit\nRobinson's case-specific inquiry during voir dire. He allowed the defense to inform\nprospective jurors of sensitive case-specific allegations during small group voir dire;\nexplore potential juror bias related to such facts; examine whether case-specific facts\nprevented jurors from realistically considering a life sentence, particularly when\nquestionnaire responses indicated potential case-specific bias; and discuss potential bias\nin response to case-specific evidence during general voir dire. Contrary to Robinson's\nassertion, Judge Anderson's rulings did not categorically prohibit case-specific\nquestioning. Nor did they limit case-specific questioning in the context of sentencing.\nInstead, the rulings limited case-specific questioning only to the extent such questions\ncalled on prospective jurors to assign weight to case-specific facts under Kansas'\nweighing equation and to disclose their likely sentencing decision in light of such facts.\n\n\n       With a clearer understanding of Judge Anderson's rulings, we return to the\nanalysis of Robinson's claim that they violated Kansas' voir dire statute, which provides:\n\n                \"The prosecuting attorney and the defendant or his attorney shall conduct the\n       examination of prospective jurors. The court may conduct an additional examination. The\n       court may limit the examination by the defendant, his attorney or the prosecuting attorney\n       if the court believes such examination to be harassment, is causing unnecessary delay or\n       serves no useful purpose.\" K.S.A. 22-3408(3).\n\n\n       By limiting case-specific questioning that required prospective jurors to assign\nweight to aggravating or mitigating circumstances and provisionally decide the sentence\n\n                                                  156\n\fin light of such facts, Judge Anderson's rulings can be construed reasonably from the\nrecord as an attempt to avoid \"unnecessary delay\" on a subject that served \"no useful\npurpose,\" i.e., staking out the jury. As such, the rulings reflect a permissible exercise of\nlawful discretion under Kansas' voir dire statute.\n\n\n       For the same reasons, Robinson's arguments under K.S.A. 22-3410 and K.S.A. 22-\n3412 are equally unavailing. K.S.A. 22-3410 entitles parties to \"challenge any\nprospective juror for cause.\" K.S.A. 22-3412 provides that defendants \"charged with an\noff-grid felony . . . shall be allowed 12 peremptory challenges.\" Robinson argues Judge\nAnderson's rulings \"prevented counsel from eliciting biases that would give rise to\nchallenges for cause\" and \"impaired the defense's use of peremptory challenges.\" This\nargument is founded on the assumption that Judge Anderson categorically denied\nRobinson opportunity to explore juror bias related to case-specific factual allegations.\nThis clearly was not the case.\n\n\n       Robinson cites to several state court decisions from other jurisdictions that stand\nfor the general proposition that jurors in capital proceedings who cannot consider both\navailable sentencing options are not qualified to serve. Robinson also cites State v.\nJackson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), and United States v.

In his Rule 6.09\nletter, Robinson also cites to State v. Clark, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1759886\"><a href=\"/opinion/1759886/state-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 147 (Mo. 1998), for a\nsimilar proposition.\n\n\n       These holdings arose from a trial court's categorical refusal to allow defendants\nany opportunity to disclose or question jurors on case-specific facts during voir dire. As\ndiscussed above, Judge Anderson's rulings did not bar such inquiry. Defense counsel\n                                             157\n\ffreely informed prospective jurors of inflammatory case-specific facts and inquired\nwhether such facts rendered them partial.\n\n\n       Finally, Robinson argues Judge Anderson's rulings violated the holding of\nKleypas. There the capital defendant argued \"the trial court erred in denying his request\nfor a separate sentencing jury,\" resulting in prejudice \"because the same jury that heard\nhis guilt phase also heard the penalty phase argument.\" 272 Kan. at 994. More\nspecifically, defendant argued that the failure to provide a separate sentencing jury placed\nhim in the \"untenable position of being unable to voir dire the jury as to its bias regarding\ncertain aggravating circumstances, such as his prior record, for fear of prejudicing the\njury in the guilt phase.\" 272 Kan. at 995. However, we rejected this argument because\nKleypas failed to take advantage of provisions within the capital sentencing scheme\nallowing him to question jurors about his criminal record and remove those biased at the\nstart of the penalty phase:\n\n               \"K.S.A. 21-4624(b) provides a method for the defendant in every capital-murder\n       case to remove biased jurors during the penalty phase. The defendant is entitled to ask\n       questions during voir dire before the sentencing phase of the trial begins. Here, Kleypas\n       chose not to voir dire the jurors concerning the binding effect of his prior murder\n       conviction or any of the aggravating circumstances. However, that procedure existed as a\n       method of removing potentially biased jurors for cause.\" 272 Kan. at 995.\n\n\n       Robinson believes the above-cited language in Kleypas squarely authorizes case-\nspecific questions regarding a panelist's willingness and ability to consider a life\nsentence. To the contrary, Kleypas did not address the permissible scope of voir dire in a\ncapital proceeding. Even if it had, Judge Anderson's ruling did not preclude counsel from\nexploring whether case-specific facts rendered prospective jurors unqualified for service.\nAnd, like the defendant in Kleypas, Robinson did not request a separate opportunity to\n\n\n                                                   158\n\fvoir dire the jury after conviction and before the start of the penalty phase. See 272 Kan.\nat 995. Judge Anderson's rulings are not inconsistent with our holding in Kleypas.\n\n\n       3. Did scope of voir dire rulings violate constitutional rights?\n\n       Robinson also argues Judge Anderson's voir dire rulings violated his federal\nconstitutional rights under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments.\n\n\n       Any question concerning the constitutionally permissible scope of voir dire in\ncapital proceedings necessarily begins with a discussion of Morgan v. Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112753\"><a href=\"/opinion/112753/morgan-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 729-30, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112753\"><a href=\"/opinion/112753/morgan-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), where the Supreme Court\nrecognized a capital defendant's constitutional right to a \"life-qualified\" jury and the\nconcomitant right to remove for cause on the ground of bias any prospective juror who\nwill automatically vote for the death penalty irrespective of the facts or the trial court's\ninstructions of law. Morgan recognized that a capital defendant must be afforded a\nreasonable opportunity to voir dire prospective jurors to effectively remove those who are\nnot \"life-qualified.\" 504 U.S. at 733-34. Morgan ultimately held the petitioner \"was\nentitled, upon his request, to inquiry discerning those jurors who, even prior to the State's\ncase in chief, had predetermined the terminating issue of his trial, that being whether to\nimpose the death penalty.\" 504 U.S. at 736.\n\n\n       Robinson claims Judge Anderson imposed a categorical prohibition on case-\nspecific voir dire questioning in violation of his constitutional rights. The argument is\nlegally and factually suspect. First, since Morgan, the majority of federal appellate courts\nhave rejected the notion that the Constitution mandates case-specific questioning during\nvoir dire in capital proceedings. Foremost among this authority is McVeigh, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156859\"><a href=\"/opinion/156859/united-states-v-mcveigh/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the appeal of the defendant convicted of bombing the Murrah Federal Building in\nOklahoma City, Oklahoma. There, defendant challenged the trial court's limitation on\n\n                                              159\n\fcase-specific questioning during voir dire. The Tenth Circuit first identified two\ncategories of Morgan-related inquiries advanced by the defense: (1) \"'general Morgan\nquestions'\" that inquired whether the juror would automatically impose the death penalty\nif a defendant were convicted of a capital offense; and (2) \"'specific Morgan questions'\"\nthat inquired whether the facts of the bombing, as revealed through pretrial publicity, had\npredisposed prospective jurors toward automatically imposing the death penalty on\nanyone convicted. 153 F.3d at 1206. The Tenth Circuit found the trial court had not\nlimited any of the properly phrased \"general Morgan questions,\" but it had precluded\n\"specific Morgan questions.\" 153 F.3d at 1207-08.\n\n\n       Even so, the Tenth Circuit found no abuse of discretion, reasoning that defendant's\ncase-specific inquiry exceeded constitutional requirements under Morgan:\n\n       \"Essentially, the questions were designed to ascertain whether the jurors felt that the\n       circumstances of the bombing were so aggravating that no mitigating factor could\n       compensate. Thus, these were case-specific questions seeking to determine what\n       prospective jurors thought of the death penalty in regards to this particular case, rather\n       than the jurors' core value system regarding imposition of the death penalty.

Judge Anderson not only allowed the defense to\ninform prospective jurors of case-specific facts, but also gave counsel leeway to explore\npanelists' impartiality and ability to consider both sentencing options notwithstanding\nthese facts.

However, Uttecth considered whether a trial court properly excused a\njuror who expressed uncertainty as to his ability to impose a sentence of death. The\nproper scope of voir dire and the permissibility of case-specific questioning were not\nissues before the Supreme Court. Uttecth is inapposite.\n\n\n       Robinson had the opportunity to formulate his own questions regarding case-\nspecific facts in the questionnaire. During small group voir dire, the defense disclosed\nsensitive case-specific allegations and probed jurors for potential bias, both in general\nand specific to sentencing, in response to such facts. Judge Anderson's rulings limited\ninquiry only when it required prospective jurors to prejudge the penalty issue based on a\ngeneral description of case-specific facts.

Robinson\nhighlights Judge Anderson's rulings sustaining the State's objections to defense counsel's\n                                              165\n\fquestioning of Jurors 115 and 271. In both instances, the district judge prevented defense\ncounsel from asking whether certain types of mitigation would outweigh aggravating\ncircumstances and warrant a life sentence, i.e., staking out the jurors. Judge Anderson\nclarified that it was appropriate to ask panelists whether they would meaningfully\nconsider a defendant's background, for example, as mitigation, but when defense counsel\nalso asked the prospective juror to compare it to aggravating circumstances and decide\nwhether the mitigation evidence would warrant a life sentence, the inquiry improperly\nstaked out the panelists.\n\n\n       These rulings are consistent with the majority of federal and state authority. They\nalso survive scrutiny under the minority view that disclosure of and limited questioning\non highly inflammatory case-specific facts may be necessary to identify mitigation-\nimpaired jurors. See, e.g., Carasi, 44 Cal. 4th at 1285-87 (Constitutional requirements\nsatisfied where trial court discloses case-specific facts to jurors before asking if they\nwould automatically vote for life or death.). Judge Anderson allowed the defense to ask\npanelists if they would consider certain categories of mitigation, and he also allowed the\ndefense to disclose case-specific facts to panelists and inquire if they would still consider\nmitigation evidence in light of such facts.\n\n\n       Robinson relies on United States v.

Here, Judge Anderson did not reject all case-specific questions, and nothing in\nFell suggests the balance Judge Anderson struck in his rulings violated Robinson's rights\nunder state or federal law. See State v.

Judge Anderson allowed defense counsel to ask\nprospective jurors if they would meaningfully \"consider\" certain types of mitigation, but\nhe did not allow them to ask how much weight they would assign to such evidence.\nRobinson believes such questioning was necessary because those who would assign little\nto no weight to specific types of mitigation were unqualified to serve.\n\n\n       The Eighth Amendment requires \"the sentencer, in all but the rarest kind of capital\ncase, not be precluded from considering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a\ndefendant's character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the\ndefendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" Lockett v.

In other words, jurors may assign zero weight to a particular piece of\nevidence without making an error of law. We see no error in the district judge's limitation\non such questioning.\n\n\n\n\n                                            167\n\f       5. Was voir dire on prior incarcerations limited improperly?\n\n       Finally, Robinson contends the trial court erred by prohibiting voir dire on his\nprior terms of incarceration and violating his right to trial by a fair and impartial jury\nunder the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments; Sections 5, 7, and 10 of the Kansas\nConstitution Bill of Rights; and K.S.A. 22-3408 and K.S.A. 22-3410.\n\n\n       To frame the issue properly, it is important to understand the procedural history\ngiving rise to the challenge. On May 31, 2002, the State filed a motion to determine the\nadmissibility of other crimes or civil wrongs evidence pursuant to K.S.A. 60-455. As part\nof this effort, the State did not seek to introduce or admit any evidence that would have\ndisclosed the fact of Robinson's prior convictions or terms of incarceration. The trial\ncourt granted the State's motion at an August 2002 hearing.\n\n\n       After Judge Anderson announced his ruling on the motion, the State mentioned it\nwas developing a strategy for introducing evidence of Robinson's relationship with\nBeverly Bonner \"without alerting the jury\" that defendant met the victim, a prison\nlibrarian, while incarcerated. Judge Anderson told the State to \"[w]ork at it real hard, be\ncreative. There's ways around these problems. If you adequately address the issue with\nyour witnesses, you can avoid those.\" These comments reflected Judge Anderson's\nposition to exclude any evidence of Robinson's prior incarcerations. Robinson's counsel\nmade no comment and never expressed a desire to inject this issue into the guilt phase.\n\n\n       The parties proceeded to jury selection and completed the first (hardship inquiry)\nand second (small group voir dire) phases without making any reference to Robinson's\nprior convictions or terms of incarceration. On October 2, 2002, the district judge began\nthe third phase of jury selection by dividing the 83 remaining veniremembers into two\nseparate panels for general voir dire. During general voir dire of the first panel, defense\n\n                                             168\n\fcounsel disclosed that Robinson had previously been incarcerated. The State objected,\nbelieving the defense was trying to poison the panel. Defense counsel argued that the line\nwas needed because it was possible such evidence could inadvertently spill over into trial.\nThe defense did not express any design or plan to introduce the subject deliberately\nduring the guilt phase. Judge Anderson expressed his displeasure with the surprise\nmaneuver, noting he had made it clear that this information was not going to be disclosed\nto jurors. The district judge provided a curative instruction to the panel members and\nmade inquiry to confirm their impartiality. Consistent with Judge Anderson's direction,\ndefense counsel did not raise the subject during general voir dire of the second panel.\n\n\n       During trial, Judge Anderson took steps to ensure that evidence of Robinson's\nprior convictions or terms of incarceration was not admitted. For example, before direct\nexamination of Robinson's parole officer, Steve Haymes, the district judge confirmed\nwith prosecutors that they would not elicit testimony regarding Haymes' job title, the\nnature of his relationship with Robinson, or his knowledge of Robinson's past\nconvictions. Consistent with Judge Anderson's position, Haymes testified only to\nRobinson's admissions regarding his involvement with Lisa Stasi.\n\n\n       On October 23, 2002, 13 days into trial, the State called Beverly Bonner's former\nhusband, Dr. William Bonner. Though William Bonner worked as the prison doctor at the\nWestern Missouri Correctional Center in Cameron, Missouri, and treated Robinson as a\npatient while Robinson was incarcerated at this facility, the State did not elicit this\ntestimony. Before cross-examination, the defense informed Judge Anderson that counsel\nintended to elicit this testimony from the witness. Robinson's counsel said that it was\nquite probable the case would proceed to a penalty phase, during which the defense\nwould introduce evidence of Robinson's prior incarcerations to prove defendant was not\nprone to violence in a prison setting. Defense counsel believed the failure to disclose this\n\n\n                                             169\n\finformation during the guilt phase would undermine the credibility of this evidence\nduring the penalty phase:\n\n               \"We want to get that evidence that he's been in the penitentiary in front of the\n       jury at the very first opportunity, otherwise it looks to the jury—otherwise, we've been\n       hiding that from them. And to have any credibility in the second part of the trial, we're\n       going to introduce this kind of testimony. I don't want jurors sitting up there thinking why\n       didn't you tell us that before [Defense Counsel] went through the whole trial with regard\n       to Dr. Bonner working in Cameron. He sees John Robinson—nothing, says nothing about\n       Robinson being an inmate.\n               \"Now, it's coming in in the penalty phase of the trial. That hurts the credibility of\n       the defense attorneys who have had the responsibility of trying to convince this jury to\n       spare Mr. Robinson's life. So that's the reasoning behind my intention to elicit this\n       testimony.\"\n\n\n       Judge Anderson confirmed that the defense was making a tactical decision in\nanticipation of a conviction and subsequent penalty phase proceeding. The defense\nconceded that the testimony regarding Robinson's prior incarceration would have no\neffect on the juror's decision on guilt or innocence and again maintained that the failure to\ndisclose it at this juncture could undermine their credibility during the penalty phase.\nJudge Anderson granted the request, and the defense elicited testimony from Dr. Bonner\nthat Robinson served time at the Missouri prison for a nonperson felony conviction.\n\n       Now Robinson argues that Judge Anderson deprived him of the right to a fair and\nimpartial jury by limiting voir dire on the topic of his prior incarcerations. Robinson cites\nno authority directly supporting his claim of a legal right to question veniremembers on\nhis criminal history or prior terms of incarceration, let alone in a situation where the trial\ncourt had made clear that such evidence would not be allowed during the guilt phase. The\nfew courts that have addressed similar challenges have rejected the notion that due\nprocess compels the court to permit voir dire on the subject. Richmond v.

Well before jury selection commenced, the district judge had made\nclear that he would not allow jurors to be exposed to any evidence disclosing Robinson's\nprior terms of incarceration. The State acknowledged the district judge's position and\ntook affirmative steps to comply with it. Robinson never objected to the district judge's\nposition. Defense counsel disclosed the fact of Robinson's prior incarceration to the first\npanel during general voir dire, but he did so out of concern that these facts might bleed\ninto the proceedings inadvertently—not because the defense had a calculated strategy to\nintroduce the subject during the guilt phase. Judge Anderson's curative instruction and\nfollow-up inquiry confirmed this panel nevertheless remained impartial.

The district judge's limitation on the scope of voir dire became\nan issue only after the defense changed course midstream and made a tactical decision on\nthe thirteenth day of trial to inject the fact of Robinson's previous incarcerations into the\nproceedings. By that point, the defense had recognized the likelihood of conviction and\nwas positioning Robinson for the penalty phase.

Carr, 300 Kan. at 114.\n\n\n       2. Did the trial court retain jurors who would impose a death sentence\n       automatically upon conviction?\n\n       Robinson claims Judge Anderson erred in denying his challenge to Jurors 33, 39,\n63, and 271 because they would vote automatically for death upon conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   174\n\f              a. Juror 33\n\n\n       Robinson argues Juror 33 testified that he would sentence a defendant to death if\nconvicted of capital murder. However, this testimony was offered in response to a far\nmore specific question that assumed the fact of a capital murder conviction, plus evidence\nof the multiple murder aggravating circumstance and no suggestion of any mitigating\ncircumstances. Viewed in context, the response reflected an acceptable assessment of the\nevidence under Kansas' statutory weighing equation in K.S.A. 21-4624(e).\n\n\n       Moreover, during the State's questioning, prospective Juror 33 shared his belief\nthat capital punishment was not appropriate in all cases and confirmed that he would\nconsider both aggravating and mitigating circumstances in arriving at a sentencing\ndecision. Juror 33 confirmed he would consider any mitigation offered by the defense and\nassign it the weight he felt it deserved.\n\n\n       In denying Robinson's motion to strike, Judge Anderson emphasized that he was\n\"considering the totality of the response\" and, in doing so, it was clear Juror 33 was\nqualified and lacked substantial impairment. Judge Anderson further observed that Juror\n33 \"adequately clarified\" to his satisfaction \"any individual remark within the totality of\nthe voir dire\" that might \"seem to indicate otherwise.\"\n\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\nSee Carr, 300 Kan. at 121 (no error in denying challenge of allegedly mitigation-\nimpaired jurors; \"selected passages from the questionnaire and voir dire responses of\nthese [challenged] prospective jurors yield cause for concern,\" but they \"eventually\nprofessed understanding of and fidelity to the law\").\n\n\n\n\n                                            175\n\f              b. Juror 39\n\n\n       Robinson challenges Judge Anderson's ruling on Juror 39 based largely on\nquestionnaire responses where she expressed a personal belief that death would be the\nappropriate punishment for a person convicted of capital murder.\n\n\n       However, after defense counsel provided a more detailed explanation of the\npenalty phase process and the jury's duty to weigh aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances, Juror 39 confirmed she would consider defendant's mitigating\ncircumstances, including his character and background, in arriving at a sentencing\ndecision. Juror 39 admitted that some of those circumstances might not outweigh the\naggravators in all instances, but she would consider them, assign them the weight she felt\nthey deserved, and balance them against any aggravators.\n\n\n       Robinson believes this testimony should be disregarded because prospective Juror\n39 did not say she would assign some weight to all mitigation evidence. Robinson's\nargument is premised incorrectly on the assumption that jurors must assign some weight\nto all evidence offered in mitigation. See Cheever, 295 Kan. at 268-70 (juror free to\nassign any weight to mitigation evidence or find it wanting altogether); see Eddings v.\nOklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114-15, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110641\"><a href=\"/opinion/110641/eddings-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The ruling is fairly\nsupported by the record and consistent with the Witt-Witherspoon framework.\n\n\n              c. Juror 63\n\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge erroneously denied his challenge of Juror 63,\nwho he believed would be a certain vote for a sentence of death upon conviction.\n\n\n       Defense counsel asked Juror 63 if he would consider \"background\" in mitigation\nof punishment. He said he would \"definitely\" consider the mitigation evidence but\nthought it would not outweigh aggravating circumstances under the facts assumed in the\nhypothetical question, which presumed a conviction for capital murder, the existence of\nan aggravating circumstance, and a vague reference to \"background\" as mitigation.\nViewed in context, Juror 63's response reflects an acceptable consideration of the\nevidence under Kansas' statutory weighing equation rather than a propensity to vote for\ndeath. See K.S.A. 21-4624(e); United States v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757051\"><a href=\"/opinion/757051/united-states-v-orlando-cordia-hall-also-known-as-lan/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 410 (5th Cir. 1998)\n(juror's comments about leaning toward death penalty even when presented with\nhypothetical evidence in mitigation did not demonstrate substantial impairment;\ncomments merely reflected her assignment of little weight to such mitigation). Moreover,\nin follow-up questioning from the State, Juror 63 confirmed that, notwithstanding his\npersonal views, he would consider aggravating and mitigating circumstances in arriving\nat a sentencing decision.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson decided Juror 63's opinions on the death penalty were not firmly\nheld and the totality of his responses showed he was not substantially impaired. The trial\ncourt's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                             177\n\f              d. Juror 271\n\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson erroneously denied his motion to strike Juror\n271 because the juror could not envision any mitigating circumstances justifying a life\nsentence.\n\n\n       The defense presented Juror 271 a hypothetical presuming the jury had convicted a\ndefendant of capital murder and was considering aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances. Based on the hypothetical, Juror 271was asked if he could realistically\nconsider a life sentence. He said, \"Depends on the mitigating circumstances.\" The\ndefense then asked if he would be leaning toward death after conviction. Juror 271 said,\n\"That's a hypothetical I don't know. I don't lean—the statement about capital punishment,\nlife in prison pretty much speaks for itself. If I felt there were no mitigating\ncircumstances that outweighed the aggravating circumstances, I would vote for the\ncapital punishment, for death.\" The defense then asked him to identify mitigation\nevidence that would assure a life sentence. Juror 271 was unable to do so at the time.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson recognized that Juror 271's response was susceptible to two\npossible interpretations: (1) The prospective juror believed no mitigating circumstances\ncould ever outweigh aggravating circumstances; or (2) the prospective juror would\nmeaningfully consider mitigating circumstances but struggled under the pressure of the\nsituation to identify specific examples that would guarantee a life sentence under the\nhypothetical. Judge Anderson noted that he had dismissed jurors who provided similar\nresponses after construing their testimony in the former category. However, based largely\non Juror 271's demeanor and his collective responses during voir dire, Judge Anderson\nconstrued his testimony as falling in the latter category.\n\n\n\n\n                                             178\n\f       Robinson argues the ruling violates Kleypas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599107\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599107/state-v-kleypas/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There the trial judge\nstruck a prospective juror who admitted that she was substantially impaired because she\ncould not vote for the death penalty, except under exceptional circumstances that she was\nunable to identify. We affirmed the trial court's ruling, reasoning that the juror's ability to\nfollow instructions on the law was dependent on whether the case satisfied one of her\n\"'very few exceptions,' a standard she was unable to articulate.\" 272 Kan. at 992.\n\n\n       The logic of Kleypas does suggest that jurors who would consider evidence in\nmitigation only in the rarest and most exceptional circumstances are substantially\nimpaired. However, Judge Anderson did not construe Juror 271's testimony in this\nfashion. Instead, relying largely on Juror 271's demeanor, the district judge found the\njuror would consider all mitigation evidence but struggled under the pressure of the\nsituation to identify specific examples that would guarantee a life sentence under the\nhypothetical. From a cold reading of the record, one might construe Juror 271's testimony\ndifferently. However, Judge Anderson was in the best position to interpret Juror 271's\nresponses, and his interpretation is fairly supported by the record and entitled to\ndeference.

Juror 14 responded:\n\n\n                 \"I think I could. I think I'd be open to whatever facts were presented and base my\n         final conclusion on that. I don't think I have anything—any preconceived conclusion of\n         what the penalty should be or what the verdict should be or anything like that.

Juror 14\nadmitted that evidence of six murders would weigh heavily in his sentencing decision and\nthat it would be difficult to consider other sentences in light of such evidence.

As\ndiscussed in the previous challenge, his responses reflected a proper consideration of the\nevidence under the statutory weighing equation.\n\n\n       Moreover, in follow-up questioning, the prosecution detected \"some confusion\"\namongst the six panel members and provided an overview of the capital sentencing\nscheme, including the legal obligation of jurors to consider mitigating circumstances and\nassign them whatever weight they believed they deserve. With this clarification, Juror 33\nconfirmed he would consider mitigation in arriving at a sentencing decision. On balance,\nJuror 33 expressed his impartiality and willingness to follow the law as instructed. We\nsee no error in Judge Anderson's ruling.\n\n\n              c. Juror 39\n\n\n       Robinson again challenges the ruling on Juror 39 (challenged above as one who\nwould automatically vote for death), claiming she leaned toward a death sentence upon\nconviction.\n\n\n       Robinson once again relies on Juror 39's questionnaire responses that reflected her\npersonal belief that capital murder warrants a death sentence. As discussed in the\nprevious challenge, Juror 39 expressed her willingness to consider mitigating\ncircumstances after the parties explained the statutory capital sentencing process to her.\n                                            183\n\fShe also confirmed her fidelity to the trial court's instructions, including instructions to\nmeaningfully consider mitigation evidence. The ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              d. Juror 63\n\n\n       Robinson again challenges the ruling on Juror 63 (challenged above as one who\nwould automatically vote for death), claiming he leaned toward a death sentence upon\nconviction. Defendant cites the same testimony he relied upon in the previous challenge\nof this veniremember. Juror 63 confirmed he would hold the State to its burden of proof\nat trial. For this reason and the others set forth in the analysis of the previous challenge,\nwe hold Judge Anderson's ruling was fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              e. Juror 69\n\n\n       Defendant argues Judge Anderson erred in denying his challenge for cause of\nJuror 69 because the veniremember was unable to hold the State to its burden of proof.\n\n\n       Once again, Robinson relies on Juror 69's response when asked if he could\nconsider a life sentence under a hypothetical scenario. While defense counsel may have\nintended to ask the hypothetical question in the context of any capital murder conviction,\nJuror 69 assumed it was specific to this case, and he explained the burden would be on\ndefendant to give him a reason not to impose a sentence of death, given that multiple\nvictims were murdered. Later, Juror 69 confirmed he would lean toward a death sentence\nbased on facts in this case but would consider any mitigation.\n\n\n       By emphasizing the significance of six murders, Juror 69's responses revealed the\nweight he would assign the multiple murder aggravator, requiring the defense to produce\nsubstantial evidence of mitigation to warrant a life sentence. Viewed in context, the\n                                              184\n\fresponses reflect a proper consideration of the facts under the statutory weighing\nequation, not improper shifting of the State's burden to the defense.\n\n\n       Moreover, during the State's questioning, Juror 69 said he would not automatically\nsentence a defendant to death and would consider mitigation. He also confirmed that his\npersonal views regarding sentence would yield to the judge's instructions on the law.\n\n\n       Based on the foregoing, we hold there was no abuse of discretion in Judge\nAnderson's ruling.\n\n\n              f. Juror 115\n\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred in denying his challenge for cause of Juror\n115 because the juror's questionnaire and voir dire responses showed the defense would\nhave to dissuade him from voting for a death sentence.\n\n\n       In questionnaire responses, Juror 115 expressed his belief that a life sentence for\ncapital murder is only appropriate in jurisdictions without the death penalty. However,\nafter defense counsel outlined the mechanics of the capital sentencing scheme, Juror 115\nsaid he would not automatically impose a death sentence upon conviction and would\nconsider mitigating circumstances. Defense counsel continued to approach the same\nquestion from different angles, but Juror 115 stayed firm in his position, confirming that a\nperson's background and other mitigation would be relevant to his sentencing decision.\nDuring the State's questioning, Juror 115 said his sentencing decision would not be\nautomatic and he would consider and weigh aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n       During follow-up questioning from defense counsel, Juror 115 agreed he would\nlean toward death upon conviction, even though he was willing to listen to and consider\n                                            185\n\fmitigation evidence. It is unclear from the record whether Juror 115 answered these\nhypothetical questions assuming a conviction for capital murder in the abstract, or\nspecific to this case, where the evidence would support multiple murders, arguably\nestablishing the existence of a statutory aggravating circumstance.\n\n\n       While certain responses may have suggested Juror 115's beliefs on the death\npenalty rendered him substantially impaired, when viewed in their totality and with\nappropriate deference to the district judge's ability to view demeanor and nonverbal\ncommunication, we hold that Judge Anderson did not err.

Juror 149\n\n\n       Robinson claims Judge Anderson abused his discretion by denying the challenge\nfor cause of Juror 149, who allegedly leaned toward a sentence of death.\n\n\n       Juror 149 agreed his questionnaire responses suggested he would lean toward\ndeath upon conviction, but he explained that he answered the questionnaire without\nknowledge of the statutory weighing equation or the role of mitigation in the sentencing\ndecision. With this knowledge, he said he was confident he could realistically consider a\nlife sentence. He also noted his personal views would be subject to and limited by further\ninstructions from the court. Moreover, after the parties explained the burden of proof and\npresumption of innocence, Juror 149 expressed his willingness to follow the law,\npresume the defendant innocent, and place the burden of proof on the State.\n\n\n       During defense questioning, Juror 149 was asked if Robinson would have the\nburden to justify a life sentence upon conviction. Juror 149 said he was not familiar with\nthe process and did not know if that was how the process worked at that stage of the\nproceedings. At that point, defense counsel interrupted and cut off the response. When\nasked how strong the mitigation evidence needed to be to vote for life, Juror 149 said it\ndepended on the court's instructions. Juror 149 also confirmed that, having been informed\nof the process, he would set aside his opinions and serve impartially.\n\n\n\n\n                                            187\n\f       Juror 149's responses evidenced his adherence to the law and did not establish\nsubstantial impairment based on a refusal or inability to hold the State to its burden of\nproof at sentencing. Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              h. Juror 184\n\n\n       Robinson contends Judge Anderson abused his discretion in denying the challenge\nof Juror 184, who would allegedly shift the burden to the defense upon conviction.\n\n\n       Defense counsel acknowledged that Juror 184's death penalty beliefs were middle\nof the road. When asked whether he could realistically consider a life sentence for\nintentional, premeditated, \"special circumstances murder,\" Juror 184 said that it depended\non the trial judge's instructions on the law and that he could \"go either way.\" Juror 184\nlater said he would probably lean toward the death penalty following a conviction for\n\"this particular capital murder,\" which presumed a conviction for capital murder, along\nwith multiple murders, without any competing mitigation. As with other jurors required\nto respond to this particular hypothetical, the response reflects an acceptable\nconsideration of the facts under the statutory weighing equation rather than disregard of\napplicable evidentiary burdens. Juror 184 later confirmed he would consider both\nsentencing options.\n\n\n       Robinson highlights one of Juror 184's responses where he appeared to qualify his\nability to be impartial, saying he would \"possibly\" be open-minded. Yet, Juror 184\nfollowed up, saying that he would \"absolutely\" give consideration to mitigating\ncircumstances, he was committed to impartiality, and that he \"would be fair and honest in\n[his] decision.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                            188\n\f       Robinson also highlight's Juror 184's statement that he expected the defense to put\non mitigation evidence. Defense counsel asked, \"[W]ould you expect me to present some\nevidence to you . . . ?\" (Emphasis added.) Juror 184 responded, \"Well, yes, sir. That\nwould be your job; wouldn't it?\" Defense counsel responded, \"Well, yeah, I suppose.\"\nThis panelist's question can be read fairly to reflect a reasonable belief that counsel would\nzealously represent the defendant. Viewed in context, the comment was benign.\n\n\n       In light of the totality of Juror 184's responses, we hold Judge Anderson's ruling to\nbe fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              i. Juror 202\n\n\n       Robinson next challenges the district judge's ruling on Juror 202 because he held a\n\"mild preference\" for the death penalty in the event of conviction.\n\n\n       Juror 202 said he could realistically consider a life sentence but expressed his own\n\"mild preference\" and slight favor for the death penalty. Robinson's counsel did not\ninquire whether Juror 202 could set these personal beliefs aside. Defendant believes the\ndistrict court ruling was erroneous because Juror 202 did not affirmatively disavow this\npersonal belief on the record. However, as noted above, a venireperson is not rendered\nsubstantially impaired merely because he or she holds personal opinions regarding the\ndeath penalty. Carr, 300 Kan. at 113-14. As the moving party, defendant had the burden\nto establish substantial impairment. See, e.g., State v. Hamilton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 466, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">363</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1906) (\"The presumption is in favor of the competency of the juror, and the burden\nof showing that good cause exists for the challenge rests upon the one who makes the\nchallenge.\"). Robinson failed to meet this burden.\n\n\n\n\n                                            189\n\f       Juror 202 said he had no firmly held opinions and confirmed his willingness to\nconsider mitigation evidence and both sentencing options. We see no error.\n\n\n              j. Juror 229\n\n\n       Defendant believes Judge Anderson erred in denying his challenge of Juror 229\nbecause she believed that death is the proper sentence upon conviction and that a\nwrongful conviction could be corrected by appeal or clemency.\n\n\n       In questionnaire responses, Juror 229 shared her personal belief that death is an\nappropriate sentence for those convicted of capital murder. However, after the parties\nexplained the jurors' role in a capital proceeding, Juror 229 said her views had changed\nand she would realistically consider both sentences.\n\n\n       In questionnaire responses, Juror 229 also shared her belief that a wrongly\nimposed death sentence could be corrected on appeal or through clemency. If firmly held,\nsuch an opinion provides a possible basis for disqualification.

However, Juror 229 confirmed her ability to set these views\naside and reach a sentencing decision based on aggravating and mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              k. Juror 271\n\n\n       Robinson again challenges Juror 271, claiming he would fail to honor the statutory\npresumption for a life sentence. Defendant relies on the same testimony cited in support\n                                            190\n\fof his challenge of Juror 271 on grounds that he would automatically vote for a sentence\nof death. For the same reasons set forth in the analysis of this previous challenge, we hold\nthere was no error in Judge Anderson's ruling.\n\n\n              l. Juror 298\n\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson erred by denying the challenge of Juror 298\nbased on her comment that a defendant must be remorseful to justify a life sentence.\n\n\n       In questionnaire responses, Juror 298 said life imprisonment might be preferable if\nthe person \"is really remorseful . . . and can be rehabilitated.\" Juror 298 did not foreclose\nthe possibility of a life sentence absent such evidence, however. In response to defense\nquestioning, Juror 298 said that her ability to vote for a life sentence depended on the\nevidence and that she would not automatically impose either sentence. During the State's\nquestioning, Juror 298 confirmed her willingness to consider aggravating and mitigating\nfactors, follow the court's instructions, and realistically consider both sentencing options.\nDuring follow-up questioning from the defense, Juror 298 said evidence of remorse\nand/or rehabilitation could be helpful to a mitigation case but was not required, and she\nwould consider both sentences, even in the absence of such evidence.\n\n\n       We hold Judge Anderson's ruling to be fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n              m. Juror 336\n\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge erred by denying the challenge of Juror 336\nbecause she believed a life sentence should not include the possibility of parole.\n\n\n\n\n                                             191\n\f       Juror 336 shared her belief that a life sentence is a proper punishment, assuming\nthe defendant remained incarcerated for his entire life. However, when the prosecutor\nasked if the possibility of parole after 25 or 50 years would cause her to disregard the\ncourt's instructions and allow it to influence her sentencing decision, she said, \"[T]here\nare rules of law to follow. That's why we have them.\" When asked if she could commit\nherself to follow those rules, Juror 336 said, \"I would think so.\" In follow-up questioning,\ndefense counsel asked if she still had difficulty with the fact that Kansas law did not offer\nlife without parole. Juror 336 said, \"It would make it difficult, but there are rules to\nfollow.\" Asked whether she would consider the possibility of parole in arriving at a\nsentencing decision, Juror 336 said, \"I would still weigh the circumstances and there are\nrules to follow. So that is what I hope that I would base it on, yes.\"\n\n\n       The prospective juror's responses appear less than unequivocal at times. However,\nJudge Anderson, who was best positioned to observe demeanor and nonverbal\ncommunication, found no substantial impairment from the totality of her responses. We\nfind no error, particularly given the deference owed to the district judge's findings. See\nWainwright v.

Juror 23\n\n\n       Robinson contends the district judge erroneously denied his challenge of Juror 23\nbecause pretrial publicity would cause him to shift the burden of proof to Robinson.\n\n\n       During defense questioning, Juror 23 said he had not formed any opinion of guilt,\nthough he would lean toward guilt if he had to decide based on the media coverage. Once\ndefense counsel explained the burden of proof, Juror 23 agreed that the State would have\nto provide the evidence and that he would comply with the trial court's instructions. Juror\n23 later disclosed that he was an attorney and, therefore, understood the presumption of\ninnocence and would acquit if the State failed to meet its burden. While Juror 23 said he\nwas interested in hearing any evidence the defense could provide to explain certain\nmedia-reported facts, he confirmed that he would comply with the trial judge's\ninstructions.\n\n\n       Based on the foregoing, Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                             193\n\f              b. Juror 39\n\n\n       Robinson argues Juror 39 should have been excused because she never said she\ncould entirely ignore her previous knowledge of the case or presume defendant innocent.\n\n\n       Juror 39 said that the media coverage made it seem \"the crimes that were\ncommitted were committed by [Robinson].\" Yet, she emphasized, \"[T]hat's just based on\nwhat I've read and what I've heard on the news.\"\n\n\n       Defense counsel frequently used a football analogy to gauge the veniremembers'\nexposure to pretrial publicity and opinions formed from it. Robinson's counsel would\nexplain that the 50-yard line represented a person who had no exposure and formed no\nopinions based on the coverage. The goal lines represented individuals who had been\nexposed to coverage and either had formed an opinion of guilt, on one end zone, or of\ninnocence, on the other. Juror 39 indicated that she would be on the 20-yard line toward\nthe guilt end zone in light of the media coverage and agreed that defendant would need to\npresent some information to get her back to the 50-yard line.\n\n\n       However, when defense counsel initially described the football analogy, Juror 39\ninquired, \"Are you asking if I would be open-minded?\" Defense counsel said, \"No.\"\nDefense counsel never asked if Juror 39 could set aside information obtained from the\nmedia, presume Robinson innocent, and decide the case on the evidence. After the\nprosecutor explained the burden of proof, Juror 39 confirmed she would acquit Robinson\nif the State failed to meet its burden.\n\n\n       Robinson claims Juror 39's later assurances of impartiality cannot overcome her\ninitial statements of bias under State v.

One\njuror was bothered by the information and did not know how it would affect his\ndeliberations but eventually expressed his willingness to decide the case on the evidence.\nUnder its particular facts, the Yurk court held that the juror's later declaration of\nimpartiality was not controlling and that his exposure to such a uniquely prejudicial\nmedia report during trial warranted a mistrial. 230 Kan. at 523-24.\n\n\n       Here, defendant failed to show Juror 39 was exposed to or affected by the type of\nuniquely prejudicial information at issue in Yurk.

Juror 69\n\n\n       Robinson argues Judge Anderson erred in denying his challenge of Juror 69, who\nallegedly presumed defendant's guilt and shifted the burden of proof to defendant.\n\n\n       In responding to defense counsel's football field analogy, Juror 69 said he was just\non the other side of the 50-yard line toward the guilt end zone based on the media's\ncoverage and would need to hear evidence from the defense to move back to midfield.\nHowever, after the State explained the presumption of innocence and burden of proof,\nJuror 69 identified \"impartiality\" as the most important trait of a juror and confirmed he\ncould set aside any preconceived opinions and remain fair and impartial. He\nacknowledged the State's burden of proof and confirmed he would acquit defendant if the\nState failed to meet it.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n               d. Juror 202\n\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred in denying his challenge of Juror 202 because\nhe expressed an inability to abide by the presumption of innocence.\n\n\n       During defense questioning, Juror 202 said media coverage had not caused him to\nform any opinions because his memory of reported facts had faded over the 2 years that\n                                            196\n\fhad passed since the story broke. Juror 202 also said he believed in defendant's right to be\npresumed innocent.\n\n\n       Based on the totality of Juror 202's responses, Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly\nsupported by the record.\n\n\n               e. Juror 271\n\n       Defendant argues the trial court improperly denied the challenge of Juror 271\nbecause his responses showed he would shift the burden of proof from the State to the\ndefense.\n\n\n       In response to defense counsel's football field analogy, Juror 271 said he could not\nquantify where he stood on the field but confirmed it would be toward the guilt side of\nthe field based on the media's coverage. As defense counsel continued to focus on his\nfootball field analogy, Juror 271 offered the following unsolicited remarks:\n\n               \"I just think I could be impartial. I realize, and I understand that all I've heard is\n       negative information, I understand that; so going into a trial, I take that into\n       consideration. I know that I have to just pay attention to what goes on in the trial and not\n       what I've heard before. I think I can do that.\"\n\n\nIn response to this unsolicited comment, defense counsel suggested Juror 271 would still\nexpect the defense to put on evidence. Juror 271 simply responded, \"I just say I can be\nimpartial come trial time.\"\n\n\n       We have no hesitation affirming Judge Anderson's ruling in light of these remarks\nand responses.\n\n\n\n                                                    197\n\f              f. Juror 324\n\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erroneously denied his challenge of Juror 324\nbecause she could not set aside her strong opinion of guilt.\n\n\n       Juror 324 expressed a personal belief that Robinson was likely to be guilty based\non the pretrial coverage of the case. However, Juror 324 expressed confidence in her\nability to set aside her opinion and serve impartially. She expressed no concern with her\nability to presume Robinson innocent. In response to the State's questions, Juror 324\nconfirmed her ability to set aside her personal view and decide the case on the evidence,\nfollow the court's instructions, and acquit Robinson if the State failed to carry its burden\nof proof.\n\n\n       There was some confusion when the State asked Juror 324 whether she would\n\"feel comfortable\" basing her decision on information from inside the courtroom, even if\nthe State did a poor job presenting the case, and Juror 324 responded, \"No. If what I learn\nin the trial would sway me that way, I would have a hard time doing that.\" However,\nJudge Anderson's subsequent independent inquiry confirmed that she had misunderstood\nthe question and that she would not let media coverage influence her decision.\n\n\n       Judge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\nDisparate Rulings on Challenges for Cause\n\n       Robinson claims Judge Anderson applied a more lenient standard to the State's\nchallenges for cause, in violation of his due process rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                             198\n\f       1.

Did Judge Anderson's rulings violate due process?\n\n       Robinson's substantive due process challenge is premised on the district judge's\nrulings on the parties' challenges for cause of Jurors 185 and 271. Specifically, Robinson\nargues that Judge Anderson's use of a more lenient standard for the State's challenges is\nevidenced by the fact that Juror 185, who strongly opposed the death penalty, was\nexcused, but Juror 271, who strongly supported the death penalty, was retained. Robinson\noversimplifies the underlying facts.\n\n                                            199\n\f       During defense questioning, Juror 185 expressed uncertainty about her ability to\nimpose a sentence of death. Attempting to rehabilitate Juror 185, defense counsel asked\nwhether she could impose a death sentence if aggravators outweighed mitigators. Juror\n185 said, \"I'd have to say no today.\" In her final remarks, Juror 185 said it would be\n\"impossible\" for her to vote for the death penalty. In granting the State's challenge, Judge\nAnderson found that \"when finally put to the test, [Juror 185] couldn't do it [realistically\nconsider both sentencing options]. The Court finds that this juror meets the test of\nWitherspoon.\" See Witherspoon v. Illinois, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519-23, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1770</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 L.\nEd. 2d 776 (1968). The finding is fairly supported by the record.\n\n\n       Juror 271, in contrast, consistently said he would consider mitigating\ncircumstances, and when \"put to the test,\" he was willing to impose a life sentence in lieu\nof the death penalty. When defense counsel asked him to identify specific types of\nmitigation that would guarantee a life sentence under a hypothetical scenario, Juror 271\ncould not think of any examples. Based largely on the prospective juror's demeanor,\nJudge Anderson construed this response to mean that he could not do so on the spot, not\nthat he believed mitigation could never result in a life sentence. This finding is fairly\nsupported by the record and entitled to deference. See Carr, 300 Kan. at 75.\n\n\n       The record confirms Jurors 271 and 185 were not similarly situated because the\nformer testified he could consider both sentencing options and the latter testified she\ncould not. Judge Anderson reached different conclusions on the challenges of these jurors\nbased on their voir dire responses, not because he applied the Witt-Witherspoon\nframework inconsistently.

Additional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       The seventeenth panel during the second phase of jury selection, small group voir\ndire, included Jurors 173, 177, 180, 184, 185, and 186. During questioning from defense\ncounsel, Juror 173 made the following comments:\n\n       \"I teach at Olathe North High School, okay. We've had two former students that were tied\n       up with Mr. Robinson, one of them is Ms. Stasi who he's on trial for first degree murder\n       and the second is Paula Godfrey. He should be on trial, first degree murder and both of\n       these were young women. I just think the man's a predator. That's as I said, this is a\n       pattern that's gone on for years. This is not something—.\"\n\n\n       Defense counsel cut off Juror 173 and moved to strike the panel, arguing the\ncomments tainted all panelists because Paula Godfrey was not one of the victims\nidentified in the Complaint and evidence of Robinson's involvement in her disappearance\nwould be inadmissible at trial. The State opposed the motion, noting Paula Godfrey's\nname was in the questionnaire, the media had reported Robinson's connection to her, and\nthe defense had explored similar issues during voir dire.\n                                                   201\n\f       Judge Anderson agreed the comments were \"troubling\" but did not believe they\nwere \"going to be a factor with\" the other panel members. He recommended defense\ncounsel question the remaining panelists to assess what, if any, impact Juror 173's\ncomments had had on them. Defense counsel said he could not ask them specific\nquestions about the comments without calling attention to them but said he could make\ninquiry in a more \"general fashion.\" Judge Anderson said he would not compel defense\ncounsel to explore the impact of the comments with the other panelists but shared his\nbelief that counsel could do so without making matters worse. The district judge denied\nthe motion to strike the panel, finding that while Juror 173 had communicated a strongly\nheld personal belief, it was not unlike others the parties had explored in previous panels.\nJudge Anderson said Juror 173's comments \"came close\" but did not actually taint the\nentire panel.\n\n\n       After the ruling, the defense continued its voir dire of the panel. Though granted\nthe opportunity, defense counsel did not ask any further questions—either general or\nspecific to Juror 173's comments—exploring panelists' impartiality. Instead he shifted the\nquestioning to death penalty topics. Then the prosecution fully explored topics of bias,\npretrial publicity, and the death penalty with the panel members. During follow-up\nquestioning, the defense again limited its inquiry to death penalty topics and did not\nexplore bias, in general, or related to Juror 173's comments, in particular.\n\n\n       At the end of questioning, the defense renewed its motion to strike the panel.\nJudge Anderson denied the motion, finding the panelists' responses remained candid,\nsuggesting they were unaffected by Juror 173's comments.\n\n\n       The trial court excused Juror 173 and entertained challenges against the remaining\npanelists. Judge Anderson granted the parties' challenges of Jurors 177, 180, 185, and\n                                            202\n\f186. Robinson challenged Juror 184 based solely on his death penalty views. Judge\nAnderson denied the challenge, in the process observing that Juror 184 held no\npreconceived opinions and gave no credence to media coverage of the case.

Did Judge Anderson err in refusing to strike the entire panel?\n\n       Robinson believes Juror 173's comments about the uncharged homicide of Paula\nGodfrey and his characterization of Robinson as a \"predator\" tainted the entire panel. At\nthis stage, however, the analysis necessarily focuses on the partiality of Juror 184, who\nwas the only member of the panel to serve on the jury. See Lacey, 86 F.3d at 969 (in\nreviewing denial of motion to strike panel, \"the partiality of the . . . jury is evaluated in\nlight of those persons ultimately empaneled and sworn, not those who are excused\").\n\n\n       Prior to Juror 173's comments, Juror 184 testified that he had not followed the\ncoverage closely, and what he did follow he viewed with skepticism. The defense chose\nnot to explore Juror 184's impartiality after Juror 173's comments. The prosecution did\nand confirmed he held no firm opinion of guilt. See State v. Stanphill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1186479\"><a href=\"/opinion/1186479/state-v-stanphill/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">612</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 619,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1186479\"><a href=\"/opinion/1186479/state-v-stanphill/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">998</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971) (\"When some of the jurors are not qualified, but the entire panel is\nnot affected, a motion to quash the entire panel will not lie. The court may simply purge\nthe panel by discharging those individuals not qualified.\").\n\n\n       Because Judge Anderson believed Juror 173's comments came close to tainting the\nentire panel, we are of the opinion that the more expedient course of action would have\nbeen to grant defendant's motion. However, this difference of opinion does not equate to\na finding of an abuse of discretion, particularly in light of the diligence and thoroughness\nJudge Anderson exercised in the design and implementation of his effective four-part jury\nselection process.\n\n\n       In the end, we conclude that a reasonable jurist could agree with Judge Anderson's\nruling in light of the isolated nature of Juror 173's comments; the defense's failure to\npursue curative measures, including general or specific inquiry of the panelists to assess\nthe impact of the comments on their impartiality; and defendant's failure to make an\n\n                                              204\n\faffirmative showing that Juror 184 was affected by the comments, especially considering\nhis consistent declarations of impartiality.

Bodkin explained repeatedly that a child had never lied about sexual\nabuse in her 3 years on the job. The Ninth Circuit found the district court erred in denying\ndefendant's motion for mistrial because the prosecution's theory was dependent on the\nvictim's testimony and Bodkin essentially vouched for this witness' credibility based on\nher knowledge, training, and expertise. 137 F.3d at 633-34.\n\n\n       Mach is distinguishable.

The Third Circuit granted habeas relief\nbecause the district court committed legal error by applying a subjective standard of\nprejudice, examining whether the jury was actually prejudiced by the comments rather\nthan applying the objective prejudice standard applicable to claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel. 642 F.3d at 146. However, the subjective standard is appropriate\nhere, as the court considers whether the juror can actually serve impartially, and the\nobjective standard of prejudice applied to ineffective assistance claims is inapplicable.\nBreakiron is legally inapposite.\n\n\nDenial of Challenges for Juror-Specific Reasons\n\n       Robinson also contends the trial court erred in denying his challenge of five\nveniremembers (Jurors 184, 298, 316, 14, and 147) on grounds of juror-specific bias\nunrelated to pretrial publicity or their death penalty views. As set forth above, we review\na district judge's denial of a challenge for cause for abuse of discretion.

Juror 184\n\n       Robinson suggests Juror 184 held numerous disqualifying biases, including: (1)\nleaning toward the death penalty; (2) close affiliation with law enforcement; (3) exposure\nto Juror 173's prejudicial comments; and (4) affiliation with the prosecutor. We addressed\nthe first and third grounds above and focus the following analysis on the remaining\nchallenges.\n\n\n       During general voir dire, Juror 184 revealed that upon his retirement, he\nvolunteered in the crime analysis unit of the Overland Park Police Department from April\n1997 to August 1999, months before law enforcement began its investigation of\n                                             207\n\fRobinson and nearly 3 years before trial. As a volunteer, he ran copies, distributed mail,\nand performed other small tasks. On one occasion, Juror 184 had lunch with Officer B.J.\nHohnholt, who was on the State's witness list but did not testify at trial. Juror 184 also\nrecognized the name Bill Batt, another officer on the State's witness list who did not\ntestify at trial.\n\n\n        Juror 184 maintained no contact with the department after resigning from his\nvolunteer position. Nor did he communicate with anyone in law enforcement about this\ncase. Juror 184 confirmed that his connection to law enforcement would not affect his\nability to assess police officer testimony just as he would any lay witness testimony. Juror\n184 also disclosed that his son was a police sergeant in Kansas City, Kansas. While\nholding a favorable impression of his son, Juror 184 confirmed he would not project that\nsame impression on law enforcement officers in general.\n\n\n        Also, prosecutor Morrison thought he recognized Juror 184 as a participant of a\nweekend marriage seminar the prosecutor and his wife taught more than a decade prior.\nWhen the prosecutor mentioned this to Juror 184, it refreshed his memory and he\nconfirmed he had attended the seminar. This was the only contact Juror 184 had had with\nthe prosecutor, and he characterized their relationship as not even rising to the level of\n\"acquaintances.\" Juror 184 confirmed this would not impact his duties as a juror.\n\n\n        The court denied Robinson's challenge for cause, which was advanced solely on\nthe ground of Juror 184's affiliation with the Overland Park Police Department. On\nappeal, Robinson acknowledges Juror 184 \"denied any bias in favor of law enforcement\nor the prosecutor\" but argues that all of these circumstances \"suggest the distinct\npossibility of such bias.\" (Emphasis added.) Such speculation is insufficient to\ndemonstrate error. McCullough, 293 Kan. at 996 (party asserting abuse of discretion in\n\n\n                                             208\n\fruling on juror impartiality bears the burden of establishing it). Judge Anderson's ruling is\nsupported by the record, and we hold that no error exists.\n\n\n       2. Juror 298\n\n       Robinson suggests Juror 298's preference to hear evidence of remorse violated his\nFifth Amendment right to silence. We addressed the same remarks in connection with\nRobinson's claim that this prospective juror should have been excused due to her inability\nto presume a life sentence. Her statements about remorse and rehabilitation were largely\nrhetorical, and she confirmed her willingness and ability to realistically consider\nmitigating circumstances and both sentencing options, even in the absence of evidence of\nrehabilitation or remorse. This testimony also demonstrates that Judge Anderson's ruling\ndid not violate Robinson's Fifth Amendment right to silence.\n\n\n       3. Juror 316\n\n       Robinson believes Judge Anderson erred in denying the challenge of Juror 316,\nwho expressed the view that the justice system is corrupted by defense lawyers who\nrepresent clients they know to be guilty.\n\n\n       The questionnaire asked jurors to identify the three biggest problems with the\ncriminal justice system. Juror 316's response identified delay, loopholes, and lawyers\nwho represent clients they know to be guilty. When asked to elaborate, Juror 316 said he\nfelt that, regardless of the facts, there is an attorney waiting to take any case. Juror 316\nsaid he had no viable solutions but shared in his questionnaire the belief that the appeals\nprocess should be streamlined. The defense did not ask Juror 316 whether he could set\naside these personal views. Juror 316 expressed no firm opinion of guilt. He confirmed\nthat his sentencing decision would not be automatic, that he would consider mitigating\ncircumstances and a life sentence, and that he would comply with the court's instructions.\n                                              209\n\f       In denying the challenge, Judge Anderson found the totality of Juror 316's\nresponses demonstrated that his personal beliefs would yield to the court's instructions on\nthe law and that he would serve impartially. These findings are fairly supported by the\nrecord, and we hold there is no error. See Goss v. Nelson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627 (10th Cir.\n2006) (jurors qualified where they can set aside personal opinions and decide on\nevidence).\n\n\n       4. Juror 14\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erroneously denied his challenge to Juror 14, who\nexpressed bias in favor of law enforcement witnesses.\n\n\n       \"When a venireman expresses a partiality toward police officer testimony per se—\nas a generic class—the bias of credibility contrary to the interest of the complainant-\nlitigant disqualifies service as a juror.\" State v.

Defense counsel attempted to cut off Juror 14 at this\npoint, but the following exchange continued:\n\n                                                  210\n\f              \"VENIREPERSON 14:            But, I'd be willing to look at, you know, other—\n\n              \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:          You'd try to keep an open mind?\n\n              \"VENIREPERSON 14:            Yes.\n\n              \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:          But when it comes to police officer versus not a\n                                           police officer—\n\n              \"VENIREPERSON 14:            Without anything else to weigh—\n\n              \"[DEFENSE COUNSEL]:          —police officer has the edge?\n\n              \"VENIREPERSON 14:            A slight edge, yes, sir.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       Juror 14's statement that he would give a \"slight edge\" to law enforcement\ntestimony over lay witness testimony, without any further information to weigh, fails to\npersuade us of his bias in this case. When viewed in their entirety, Juror 14's responses\nindicated a willingness to keep an open mind and consider factors relevant to assessing\nthe credibility of both law enforcement and lay witness testimony. In short, he expressed\nwillingness and ability to set any bias aside. His overall statements did not reflect blind\nadherence to the testimony of law enforcement officers over lay witnesses. As such,\nJudge Anderson's ruling is fairly supported by the record, and we hold there is no error.\n\n\n       5. Juror 147\n\n       Finally, Robinson argues Juror 147 should never have been seated because he was\nexcused for cause on the first day of jury selection for failing to appear. A summary of\nthe procedural and factual background demonstrates that this challenge is without merit.\n\n\n\n\n                                             211\n\f       Judge Anderson conducted jury selection in four separate phases. Phase one was\ndevoted to hardship issues and began on September 16, 2002. During this phase, Judge\nAnderson called prospective jurors in panels of 60 to identify those asserting hardship.\nNearly 300 jurors were ordered to appear on day one, and a number of veniremembers\nsummoned that day were deferred to a later date. After completing hardship inquiries on\nthe first panel of 60 veniremembers, the defense moved to strike those jurors who failed\nto appear. The district judge granted the motion and ordered those jurors excused, \"with\nthe proviso that that does not relieve them from the obligation on the summons . . . .\"\nNeither Robinson, in his motion, nor Judge Anderson, in his ruling, specifically identified\nJuror 147 as one of those excused for failure to appear.\n\n\n       At the start of the proceedings the following day, September 17, Juror 147\nappeared in response to his summons. Judge Anderson commented, \"Apparently I missed\nthat,\" explaining he had Juror 147 down as a failure to appear when he should have been\na deferral. Defense counsel merely responded, \"Okay.\"\n\n\n       Juror 147 did not assert any hardship, so Judge Anderson passed him to the second\nphase of jury selection and assigned him to the seventh panel for small group voir dire on\nthe topics of pretrial publicity, bias, and the death penalty. On October 20, 2002, Judge\nAnderson called the seventh panel and observed that Juror 147 was present, explaining\nthat this prospective juror had been deferred to the second day of hardship inquiry.\nDefense counsel asked what had happened, believing Juror 147 was one of the\nveniremembers who had been excused for failing to appear on the first day of jury\nselection. Judge Anderson explained that Juror 147 had been deferred on the first day due\nto Yom Kippur, but that he appeared on the second day and was assigned to the current\npanel for small group voir dire. Once again, defense counsel responded, \"Okay.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                            212\n\f       Both parties proceeded to examine Juror 147 extensively on the topics of pretrial\npublicity, bias, and the death penalty, and both parties passed him to the third phase of\njury selection, general voir dire. During general voir dire, neither Robinson nor the State\nchallenged him. Robinson did not exercise a peremptory challenge to remove Juror 147,\nand he was impaneled and sworn in as a member of Robinson's jury.\n\n\n       Robinson fails to establish any specific grounds for error. The record does not\nestablish with any degree of clarity that Juror 147 was dismissed for failing to appear.\nInstead, it suggests he had been deferred and appeared as ordered on the second day of\njury selection. Robinson did not object to Juror 147's continued participation in the jury\nselection process and passed him for cause. \"All challenges for cause must be made\nbefore the jury is sworn to try the case.\" K.S.A. 22-3410(3). Robinson's failure to do so\nwith Juror 147 undermines his claim of error on appeal. See State v. Paxton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1411429\"><a href=\"/opinion/1411429/state-v-paxton/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">353</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1411429\"><a href=\"/opinion/1411429/state-v-paxton/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968); State v.

The question of juror\nmisconduct will either stand or fall on its own merits, and we consider this challenge later\nin the opinion. However, Juror 147's subsequent conduct as a juror does not establish that\nhe lacked qualification to serve at the time he was impaneled. We find no error in the\ndistrict judge's seating of a juror who was subjected to voir dire, passed for cause by the\nparties, and impaneled as a juror without objection.\n\n\nStrike of Veniremember Opposed to Death Penalty\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court improperly granted the State's challenge of Juror\n253 based solely on her general opposition to the death penalty.\n\n                                            213\n\f       1.

Did prosecutorial misconduct prejudice the jury selection process?\n\n       Robinson contends the prosecutor committed misconduct by defining mitigating\ncircumstances improperly, confusing guilt and penalty phase facts, commenting on\ndefendant's future dangerousness, implying jurors could consider nonstatutory\naggravating circumstances, and misstating the proper role of jurors.\n\n\n              a. Definition of Mitigating Circumstances\n\n\n       Robinson believes the prosecution committed misconduct by suggesting\nmitigating circumstances must reduce defendant's culpability for the offense.\n\n\n       While questioning the second small group panel, prosecutor Morrison asked Juror\n23 whether he would \"be able to consider factors that tend to lessen one's guilt when it\ncomes to that stage?\" The defense objected to this description of mitigating\ncircumstances, and the district judge instructed the prosecutor to rephrase. The prosecutor\ncomplied, defining mitigating circumstances in a manner that drew no further objection.\n\n\n       Mitigating circumstances are those that lessen or diminish the moral culpability or\nblame of defendant or otherwise warrant a life sentence, and we have cautioned\nprosecutors not to argue that certain circumstances should not be considered mitigating\nsimply because they do not excuse or justify the crime. Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1103. Here,\nthe prosecutor made no such argument. Nor is it evidence he intended to offer a precise,\nlegal definition of the term in his questioning. Instead, he was attempting to gauge\n\n                                            217\n\fveniremembers' ability to consider both sentencing options. The isolated nature of the\nprosecutor's statement and his immediate corrective action demonstrate that the conduct,\neven if improper, was not gross and flagrant or the product of ill will. See State v.\nAlbright, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 426-27, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2628083\"><a href=\"/opinion/2628083/state-v-albright/\"><span class=\"volume\">153</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007) (prosecutor's inadvertent and\nisolated violation of order in limine was not gross and flagrant or the product of ill will).\n\n\n       Moreover, none of the six veniremembers on the second small group panel served\nas a member of defendant's jury, and the district judge properly defined mitigating\ncircumstances in his ultimate instructions. Therefore the prosecutor's statement did not\nconstitute prejudicial misconduct. See State v. Phillips, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">295</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 945-46, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">245</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012) (Misstatement of law on completion of robbery was not reversible misconduct\nwhere jurors properly instructed, and remarks were isolated and devoid of ill will.).\n\n\n              b. Mixing Guilt Phase Facts with Penalty Phase Facts\n\n\n       Robinson suggests the prosecutor committed misconduct before another small\ngroup panel, composed of Jurors 82, 85, 87, 90, 92, and 95, when he asked Juror 82,\n\"And if I gave you a scenario of a hundred homicides, we'd be able to find differences in\nthe facts and circumstances of all of them, right?\" Robinson's counsel objected, claiming\nthe prosecutor was attempting to inject guilt phase facts into a discussion of mitigating\nand aggravating circumstances. Judge Anderson overruled the objection, noting that it\n\"presupposes that [the prosecutor's] question, which references the different\nhomicides . . . deal[s] only with the elements of the crime but not the mitigating factors\nand the aggravating factors . . . .\" The record provides no basis to construe the comments\ndifferently from the district judge's construction, and we perceive no misconduct in the\nform of the question.\n\n\n\n\n                                             218\n\f               c. Comments on Future Dangerousness\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor inquired improperly about future dangerousness in\nprison. Indeed, while questioning the first small group panel, the prosecutor said that just\nbecause somebody goes to prison does not mean that he or she is no longer dangerous.\n\n\n       While reasonable minds might dispute the reasonableness of the prosecutor's\nobservation, there is no need to do so here because Judge Anderson excused the entire\npanel based on the prosecutor's comment. None of the panelists could have affected\nRobinson's peremptory challenges or his fair trial rights.\n\n\n               d. Nonstatutory Aggravating Circumstances\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor suggested that the jury could consider defendant's\nbad character as an aggravating circumstance. While questioning the small group panel\nconsisting of Jurors 34, 312, 336, 337, 342, and 344, the prosecutor said:\n\n       \"Even every murder is different. People do different things for different reasons; don't\n       they? Some defendants might be more conniving than others, right? Some might be\n       smarter than others. Some might be slower than others. Some might be acting under the\n       influence of somebody else.\"\n\n\nRobinson's counsel objected, arguing that the circumstances the prosecutor had identified\nwere not all valid, statutory aggravating circumstances. The court sustained the objection\non different grounds, finding that the form of the prosecutor's question was sending a\n\"mixed message\" and instructed the panel members to disregard the prosecutor's\ncomments. Judge Anderson denied defendant's motion to strike the panel, believing any\nconfusion could be cured. The prosecutor then rephrased without objection.\n\n\n                                                   219\n\f          Robinson cites no authority suggesting the prosecutor's statements were error.\nAlso, we presume prospective jurors followed the district judge's instruction, and we\nagree with Judge Anderson that the remarks were not of the type or character immune to\nsuch curative measures.

Comments before the Ninth Panel\n\n\n       Robinson argues two prosecutorial comments during voir dire of the ninth small\ngroup panel, consisting of Jurors 312, 337, 336, 342, 344, and 347, violated Caldwell.\n\n\n       First, while explaining a capital sentencing jury's duty to consider and weigh\naggravating and mitigating circumstances, prosecutor Morrison commented, \"Because\nunder Kansas law, the death penalty can only be recommended by the jury if the\naggravating factor or factors outweigh any mitigating factors that are found to exist.\"\n(Emphasis added.) The second comment concerns the following statement that Robinson\nattributes to Morrison: \"If a person is found guilty, he receives the death penalty,\nsentence has been carried out with the death penalty on appeal to provide a safety net so\nwe don't have wrongful kinds of things.\" The defense lodged no objections.\n\n\n       As discussed below, the prosecutor's use of the term \"recommended\" is consistent\nwith the statutory language used to describe a capital jury's sentencing decision. Also, the\nisolated statement, made weeks before the jury was instructed on the capital sentencing\nprocess, was not gross and flagrant or the product of ill will. See State v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">509</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1078</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). As to the second challenged statement, a careful\nreading of the record suggests prosecutor Morrison, who was questioning Juror 344 at the\ntime, was actually reading or summarizing the veniremember's questionnaire response,\nnot explaining the sentencing process to veniremembers. In other words, the challenged\nstatement is not properly attributed to the prosecutor. These remarks did not affect\nRobinson's peremptory challenges or fair trial rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                            221\n\f                     (ii). Comments before the Seventeenth Panel\n\n\n       Robinson also highlights comments the prosecutor made while examining the\nseventeenth panel. Before questioning these five veniremembers on their death penalty\nviews, prosecutor Morrison provided them with an overview of the sentencing process,\nexplaining that the jury arrives at a sentencing decision by \"considering aggravating\ncircumstances\" and \"mitigating circumstances . . . and weighing those and after\nconsidering those making a recommendation of whether the defendant should get the\ndeath penalty or whether the defendant should serve life . . . .\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       Defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's use of the term \"recommendation\" to\ndescribe the jury's sentencing decision, arguing it violated Caldwell. The district judge\ndenied defendant's motion to strike the panel but instructed panel members to disregard\nthe prosecutor's comments. The prosecutor rephrased, clarifying that the jury would\ndecide the sentence, either a life term or death.\n\n\n       The prosecutor's use of the term \"recommendation\" does not violate Caldwell or\nconstitute an improper statement of the law in this instance. In Caldwell, the prosecutor's\ncomments \"were quite focused, unambiguous, and strong.\" 472 U.S. at 340. In contrast,\nMorrison used one purportedly objectionable word, \"recommendation,\" on a single\noccasion before this small group panel. The prosecutor's use of the term\n\"recommendation\" did not unambiguously and forcefully diminish the jury's role in the\nsentencing decision. Ingram v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1125382\"><a href=\"/opinion/1125382/ingram-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">779</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1276 (Ala.

In fact,\nthe Kansas Legislature used the same word to describe the jury's sentencing verdict under\nour capital sentencing scheme.

The legislature's\nuse of the term \"recommendation\" accurately describes the jury's sentencing verdict\nbecause K.S.A. 21-4624(f) requires the trial court to review any jury verdict imposing a\nsentence of death to decide whether the sentence is supported by the evidence. See Hicks\nv. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787816\"><a href=\"/opinion/787816/john-r-hicks-v-terry-collins-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (6th Cir. 2004) (Because Ohio law \"requires a separate,\npost-recommendation finding by the trial judge confirming the jury's sentence, this court\nhas held that casting the jury's decision as a 'recommendation' is not an inaccurate\nstatement of Ohio law and therefore does not violate Caldwell.\").\n\n\n       Even if the comments had been improper, the district judge's curative instruction\nand the prosecutor's clarification of the jurors' role prevented interference with\ndefendant's right to exercise peremptory challenges and ruled out prejudice to his fair trial\nrights. See Romano, 512 U.S. at 9 (instructions that \"emphasized the importance of the\njury's role\" diminished the type of prejudice created in Caldwell).\n\n\n                       (iii). Comments before the Twenty-seventh Panel\n\n\n       Prosecutor Morrison used the word \"recommend\" in describing the sentencing\ndecision of the jury in comments made to the twenty-seventh small group panel.\nRobinson objected immediately, and Morrison said, \"Judge, honest misstatement. I'll be\nhappy to rephrase.\" The trial judge delivered the following curative instruction:\n\n       \"Members of the panel, Mr. Morrison, in his questions, used the word 'recommend.' I\n       want to make it clear to the panel that it will be the jury's determination what the sentence\n       is, and it will not be a recommendation.\"\n\n\nAfter the instruction, the prosecutor commented, \"Thank you Judge. I apologize. I\nmisspoke. It is not a recommendation. It is for you to determine. When we get to that\nphase, jury determines death penalty or life sentence. Everybody with me?\" None of the\n\n                                                   223\n\fpanelists expressed any uncertainty or confusion. For the same reasons outlined above,\nMorrison's use of the term \"recommend\" did not violate Caldwell in this instance.\n\n\n       In the end, the prosecutor's voir dire comments did not interfere with defendant's\nright to exercise peremptory challenges or otherwise prejudice his fair trial rights.\n\n\nTrial Court's Use of an Anonymous Jury Selection Procedure\n\n       Robinson next contends that Judge Anderson's use of a juror numbering system to\nidentify veniremembers and those seated as jurors was unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\n\n       1. Additional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       In June 2002, Judge Anderson entered a written order outlining the court's rules\nfor handling juror questionnaires. Therein, he ordered that the \"identities and addresses of\nthe jurors\" be maintained in strict confidence among the parties and that \"[a]ll jurors will\nbe assigned a unique number which will be used to identify them throughout voir dire\nand the course of the trial.\" While prospective jurors were identified only by number to\nthe public, their identities were known to the parties, and each prospective juror's name\nand address was disclosed in the questionnaire.\n\n\n       Robinson did not object to the use of juror numbers. In fact, he was a proponent of\nthe system. In opposing Judge Anderson's initial decision to sequester the jury for the\nduration of trial, Robinson argued, in part, that other measures, including a juror\nnumbering system, could accomplish the same objectives with less intrusion. At a\nSeptember 2002 motions hearing, both parties agreed that it was unnecessary to sequester\nthe jury in light of these less intrusive measures. Based on the parties' agreement, Judge\nAnderson ordered the jury sequestered during deliberations only.\n\n                                             224\n\f       After selecting the jury, Judge Anderson delivered admonitions and explained why\njurors would be identified by number:\n\n               \"Now, I want to explain to you a little bit about procedurally how we're going to\n       . . . handle things. Even though you're not going to be sequestered, we're going to be\n       helping you in following these admonitions; and you've all gotten the numbers, and we've\n       been using numbers rather than names.\n               \"I want to assure you that you should not be concerned for your safety. That's not\n       the reason that we're using the numbers, okay? The reason that we're using the numbers is\n       that we want to make sure that your integrity is preserved while you're serving as jurors\n       on this case and to help in these admonitions so that we don't have to sequester you in the\n       evening hours and on the weekends.\"\n\n\n       Judge Anderson continued:\n\n               \"Now, this is designed to prevent you from being exposed inadvertently or\n       against your will by anyone that might want to impose themselves upon you during the\n       pendency of the case with respect to the admonition issues; overzealous media persons,\n       for example, and I don't mean to single out the media, but that's just an example.\n       Overzealous anybody that might try to give you their views of the case. And we want to\n       try to avoid that. Does everybody understand that's why we're doing these things?\"\n\n\nNo juror expressed confusion as to the purpose of the juror numbering system.\n\n\n       2. Legal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       We have identified a two-part balancing test for analyzing the propriety of a\ndistrict court's use of an anonymous jury identification system.\n\n       \"First, there must be a reason to protect the jurors from identification. This decision will\n       be left to the trial court's discretion. Second, the court must take reasonable precautions to\n       minimize any prejudicial effects on the defendant. A neutral explanation should be given,\n\n                                                   225\n\f       and the jury should be instructed that the use of numbers instead of names should in no\n       way be interpreted as a reflection of the defendant's guilt or innocence.\" State v. Brown,\n       </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2595587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2595587/state-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 74, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1273</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).\n\n\n       3. Was Judge Anderson's juror numbering system improper?\n\n       Robinson contends the anonymous jury selection procedure violated Kansas law\nand his due process right to the presumption of innocence. As a preliminary matter, it\nshould be clarified that Judge Anderson did not use an anonymous jury selection\nprocedure in the true sense of that word, where juror identities are withheld from the\npublic and parties alike. Both the district judge and the parties knew the identity of each\nprospective juror. See State v. Yates, No. 89,938, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">795906</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3 (Kan.

See Brown, 280 Kan. at\n72-75. However, \"there remains the concern that the trial court's order negatively\nimpacted [defendant's] constitutional right to the presumption of innocence.\" 280 Kan. at\n72-73. To determine whether the juror number system appropriately balanced the court's\ninterest in protecting jurors' identities with defendant's right to a fair trial, we apply the\nBrown balancing test, considering whether Judge Anderson had \"a reason to protect the\njurors from identification\" and whether he took \"reasonable precautions to minimize any\nprejudicial effects on the defendant.\" 280 Kan. at 74.\n\n\n                                                   226\n\f              a. Reason to Protect Jurors from Identification\n\n\n       While safety concerns motivated the trial court's decision to use a juror number\nsystem in Brown, we also recognized that several other factors could justify use of such\nprocedures, including that extensive publicity \"'could enhance the possibility that jurors'\nnames would become public and expose them to intimidation and harassment.'\" 280 Kan.\nat 72 (identifying five common factors, including invasion of privacy from media);\nUnited States v. Krout, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"705174\"><a href=\"/opinion/705174/united-states-v-douglas-william-krout-aka-mark-william-danford-aka/\"><span class=\"volume\">66</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1427 (5th Cir. 1995) (same).\n\n\n       Judge Anderson identified the potential for invasion of juror privacy by the media\nor other overzealous individuals with an interest in the outcome of the proceedings,\nparticularly in the absence of sequestration, as the reason for using the juror numbering\nsystem. The concern for juror privacy was well founded. Defendant's own venue study\nconfirmed the media's coverage of the case was probably unprecedented in Johnson\nCounty. Judge Anderson's concern for juror privacy was also genuine. He initially\nordered the jury to be sequestered for the duration of trial to protect jurors from such\nintrusions. At the defense's urging, the district judge ultimately utilized the juror\nnumbering system and other protective measures in lieu of sequestration. The record\nconfirms Judge Anderson's concerns about invasion of juror privacy were reasonably\nsupported by the totality of the circumstances. The trial court asserted a proper reason for\nusing a juror numbering system, satisfying the first prong of Brown's two-part balancing\ntest. See Johnson, 354 F. Supp. 2d at 956 (extensive media publicity justified use of juror\nnumbers to protect jurors' privacy and limit their exposure to extrajudicial information).\n\n\n       Robinson suggests there was no evidence jurors needed such protection. The\nargument is wholly unpersuasive in light of the appellant's venue study, venue challenge\non appeal, and the arguments the defense advanced at trial in opposition to sequestration,\nincluding its support for the juror numbering system in lieu of sequestration. We defer to\n                                             227\n\fthe trial court's discretion regarding the need to protect juror privacy in this case. See\nBrown, 280 Kan. at 74 (whether reasons exist to protect juror identity is an issue \"left to\nthe trial court's discretion\"); see also United States v. Peoples, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773307\"><a href=\"/opinion/773307/united-states-v-cornelius-peoples-united-states-of-america-v-xavier/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635 (8th Cir.\n2001) (district court has wide discretion to require use of numbers for identification in\nany case).\n\n              b. Reasonable Precautions to Minimize Prejudice\n\n       As to the second prong of the Brown balancing test, it is clear Judge Anderson was\ncognizant of and took steps to avoid prejudicial inferences associated with the use of\njuror numbers. He provided jurors with a neutral explanation for the numbering system,\nexplaining that it protected jurors from corrupting influences that could result from public\ndisclosure of juror identities. Also, he expressly informed jurors that the procedure was\nunrelated to any security threat or juror safety. This explanation adequately protected\nRobinson's due process rights. See United States v.

SUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE OF COMMON SCHEME OR COURSE OF CONDUCT\n\n       Under Counts II and III of the Fourth Amended Complaint, Robinson was charged\nwith and tried for capital murder under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), which defines the offense\nto include the \"intentional and premeditated killing of more than one person as a part of\nthe same act or transaction or in two or more acts or transactions connected together or\nconstituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct.\" The counts were identical\nin charging the murder of a principal victim as \"one of multiple acts or transactions\n\n                                            229\n\fconstituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct in which other human beings\nwere killed in a premeditated and intentional manner, to-wit: Beverly J. Bonner, Sheila\nFaith, Debbie Faith and Lisa Stasi.\" Count II charged Suzette Trouten as the principal\nvictim and Count III charged Izabela Lewicka as the principal victim.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       Robinson advances two arguments challenging the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting his capital murder convictions. First, he contends the evidence failed to\nestablish a \"common scheme or course of conduct\" as the phrase should be construed\nunder K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). Second, he argues the State cannot rely on murders that\noccurred prior to the effective date of the capital murder statute to prove the multiple\nmurders required under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\n\n\n       To the extent Robinson's arguments compel us to construe K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6),\nwe exercise unlimited review.

For example, Robinson cites State v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2586244\"><a href=\"/opinion/2586244/state-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2007), where we discussed the \"common scheme or course of conduct\" requirement in\nanalyzing the unit of prosecution for multiplicity purposes under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\nIn interpreting the unit of prosecution for capital murder, we stated:\n\n\n               \"The plain and unambiguous language of K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) defines capital\n       murder as multiple first-degree murders, i.e., the 'intentional and premeditated killing of\n       more than one person.' The statute also requires that the multiple killings be related to\n       one another in some way, that they occur 'as a part of the same act or transaction,' or 'in\n       two or more acts . . . connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or\n       course of conduct.' K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\" (Emphasis added.) 284 Kan. at 572.\n\n\n       We found the circumstances demonstrated the existence of a common scheme or\ncourse of conduct, finding:\n\n\n               \"Defendant's conduct certainly satisfies this statutory definition. The stipulated\n       facts demonstrate that he was complicit in four intentional and premeditated killings,\n       despite the ultimate dismissal of one capital count. The three murders on which he stands\n       convicted were connected together and constituted parts of a single course of conduct.\n       The evidence demonstrates that they all occurred within a short span of time and were\n       designed to avenge an earlier battery of [his codefendant's] mother.\" (Emphasis added.)\n       284 Kan. at 572.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   231\n\f       Robinson seizes upon this language and the court's reliance on the \"short span of\ntime\" and common revenge motive to argue that Harris dictates against finding a\ncommon scheme or a course of conduct in the absence of such evidence.\n\n\n       The argument is logically flawed. Harris does not require a short time span or a\ncommon motive to establish a common scheme or course of conduct. The only\nrequirement Harris recognizes is that the murders be \"related to one another in some\nway.\" The common motive and short time between criminal acts merely happened to be\nthe factors showing the relatedness of the murders in Harris. They were not conditions\nprecedent for the existence of a common scheme or course of conduct in any case\ncharged under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\n\n\n       Employing similarly flawed logic, Robinson reviews other cases in which our\ncourt has examined the terms \"common scheme\" or \"course of conduct\" in other contexts,\ndistinguishing those cases factually from his own, and arguing the specific factual\ncharacteristics of those cases established prerequisites for the legal conclusion. For\ninstance, he relies on State v. Spain, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1378889\"><a href=\"/opinion/1378889/state-v-spain/\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1378889\"><a href=\"/opinion/1378889/state-v-spain/\"><span class=\"volume\">953</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1004</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998), to argue that a\ncourse of conduct cannot encompass crimes separated by several hours.\n\n\n       In Spain, we examined whether the facts supported the existence of the\naggravating circumstance alleged by the State, which required proof that defendant\nknowingly or purposely created a great risk of death to more than one person. We\ndetermined that the statutory aggravator required a direct relationship between the great\nrisk of death thrust upon the second victim and the homicide of the first victim. 263 Kan.\nat 718. We reversed the district court, stating:\n\n\n       \"The risk need not be contemporaneous with the homicide, but it must occur in the course\n       of committing the charged murder. In the present case, a period of time that included\n\n                                                  232\n\f       Spain's escaping from jail, shooting Powell, and kidnapping Briles might more precisely\n       be termed a series of discrete transactions or events than one course of conduct. Although\n       the events were loosely connected in that each figured in Spain's escape, they are too\n       remote from one another in time, distance, and nature to be characterized as a course of\n       conduct. The murder of Powell was completed long before Briles was kidnapped in\n       Colorado. Thus, the trial court erred in finding that the risk of death to Briles was an\n       aggravating circumstance in the murder of Powell.\" (Emphasis added.) 263 Kan. at 718.\n\n\n       Robinson relies on Spain to argue that a course of conduct cannot include acts that\nare \"remote from one another in time, distance, and nature.\" Again, Robinson's argument\nis flawed. First, the aggravating circumstance at issue required a direct relationship\nbetween the murder and the risk of death to another. Harris, on the other hand, provides\nthat K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) requires only that the multiple murders \"be related to each\nother in some way.\" Second, in Spain we did not define \"course of conduct.\" We merely\nused the phrase in the process of determining the meaning of the statutory aggravating\ncircumstance.\n\n\n       Likewise, Robinson relies on authority construing Kansas' joinder statute, which\nallows the State to join offenses in a single complaint under a variety of circumstances,\nincluding where the crimes are based on \"two or more acts or transactions connected\ntogether or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan,\" K.S.A. 22-3202(1), to argue\nthe phrase \"common scheme\" requires the crimes be motivated by a single identifiable\ngoal.

Although Gleason's argument as to this issue is murky, he seems to suggest\n       that there is no evidence the murders are related because there is no evidence he and\n       Thompson talked about killing Wornkey or that Thompson knew Gleason intended to kill\n       Wornkey, and no evidence he and Thompson talked about killing Martinez on the way to\n       Great Bend or that Gleason knew Thompson intended to shoot Martinez.\n               \"But this argument ignores our standard of review, which requires us to view the\n       evidence in the light most favorable to the State. Here, the State presented evidence that\n       Gleason and Thompson armed themselves and drove to Great Bend to 'bring some\n       intimidation' to Martinez based on their mutual belief Martinez had talked to police about\n       the Elliott robbery—a robbery in which Thompson and Gleason participated. Thompson\n       parked across the street from Martinez' house; and when Martinez and Wornkey arrived\n       home, Thompson watched as Gleason approached Wornkey's Jeep and shot and killed\n       Wornkey, wounding Martinez. Gleason and Thompson then kidnapped Martinez and\n                                                   234\n\f       took her to a rural location where Thompson strangled, shot, and killed her. Viewing this\n       evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we are convinced a rational jury could\n       have found beyond a reasonable doubt that the murders of Martinez and Wornkey were\n       sufficiently related to support the capital murder charge.\" Gleason, 299 Kan. at 1150-51.\n\n\n       Contrary to Robinson's attempts to narrow and compartmentalize the meaning and\nscope of a common scheme or course of conduct under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), in Gleason,\nwe again required only that the multiple murders be related to one another in some way.\n\n\n       Moreover, in reviewing the evidence in Gleason, we did not point to any particular\ncharacteristics of the murders, i.e., common motive, short span of time, or similar modus\noperandi, in concluding that a rational jury could have found the murders sufficiently\nrelated to satisfy the statutory element. In fact, we rejected defendant's argument that the\ntwo murderers must have conspired to commit both murders for them to be sufficiently\nrelated to establish a common scheme or course of conduct.\n\n\n       Robinson fails to show a legal definition of the terms that would justify taking the\nissue from the jury. The State presented ample evidence that Robinson lured his victims\nwith promises of financial gain, employment, or travel; exploited them sexually or\nfinancially; used similar methods to murder and dispose of their bodies; and used\ndeception to conceal the crimes, including phony letters and e-mails to victims' friends\nand family members. While no two of the victims or their murders were identical, they\nare not required to be. Simply put, there was ample evidence from which the jurors could\nhave found that all of the murders were related to one another in some way and therefore\npart of a common scheme or course of conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  235\n\fCan conduct that straddles the date of enactment of the capital murder statute support\ndefendant's capital murder convictions?\n\n       Robinson next argues that K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) does not apply to murders that\noccurred prior to July 1, 1994, the effective date of the statute. The State failed to prove\nthat the murders of Lisa Stasi, Sheila and Debbie Faith, and Beverly Bonner occurred\nafter July 1, 1994, and, therefore, Robinson argues, his capital murder convictions must\nbe vacated.\n\n\n       Whether K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) applies to a common scheme or course of conduct\nthat straddles in time the date of enactment requires us to interpret the legislative act.\n\n\n               \"The most fundamental rule of statutory construction is that the intent of the\n       legislature governs if that intent can be ascertained.

The first element of the\ncrime requires intentional and premeditated killing of more than one person. The second\nelement requires that these killings be part of the same act or transaction or multiple acts\nor transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\nconduct. K.S.A. 21-3106(6) provides: \"An offense is committed either when every\nelement occurs, or, if a legislative purpose to prohibit a continuing offense plainly\nappears, at the time when the course of conduct or the defendant's complicity therein is\nterminated.\" Robinson could not have completed capital murders until both of the\nstatutory elements were satisfied.\n\n\n       The murders of Trouten and Lewicka each constituted parts of the common\nscheme or course of conduct that included the murders of Stasi, Sheila and Debbie Faith,\nand Bonner. Accordingly, the elements of capital murder as charged under K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) were not united and fulfilled until the principal charged capital murder\nvictims, Trouten in Count II and Lewicka in Count III, had been killed. A reasonable\njuror could conclude from the State's evidence that the murders of Trouten and Lewicka\nboth occurred after July 1, 1994, the effective date of K.S.A. 21-3439.

Rejecting this claim, the Oregon Court of Appeals found that\n\"[d]efendant's ex post facto argument turns on an artificial disassociation of the pre-\nenactment assaults from the post-enactment murder. Murder by abuse requires both\nelements. Accordingly, defendant's crime was not completed until after the enactment of\nthe statute.\" 130 Ore. at 472.\n\n\n       The Zelinka rationale applies equally to Robinson's challenge. As charged, K.S.A.\n21-3439(a)(6) includes two separate elements, the killing of multiple persons and a\ncommon scheme or course of conduct. Robinson cannot artificially disassociate the\npreenactment murders from the postenactment murders of the principal victims that\nconstituted parts of defendant's common scheme or course of conduct. The elements of\nthe capital murder statute were not completed until Robinson murdered Trouten, under\nCount II, and Lewicka, under Count III—acts that occurred subsequent to enactment.\n\n\n                                                    238\n\f       Likewise, the California Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in People v.\nGrant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1301864\"><a href=\"/opinion/1301864/people-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1301864\"><a href=\"/opinion/1301864/people-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

There, defendant was\nconvicted under the continuous sexual abuse of a minor statute, which prohibited any\nperson residing with or having access to a child under the age of 14 to molest that child at\nleast three times during a period of not less than 3 months. The court examined whether\nabusive conduct that began before, but continued after, the effective date of the\ncontrolling statute could support defendant's conviction. The California Supreme Court\nobserved that a statute is applied retroactively only if it penalizes a crime completed\nbefore the law's effective date. As such, the critical question was \"whether the last act or\nevent necessary to trigger application of the statute occurred before or after the statute's\neffective date.\" 20 Cal. 4th at 157. In affirming the conviction, the court held:\n\n\n               \"Here, defendant was convicted of continuous sexual abuse . . . after the court\n       instructed the jury to return a verdict of guilty only if it found that one of the required\n       minimum of three acts of molestation occurred after section 288.5's effective date. In\n       other words, defendant could be convicted only if the course of conduct constituting the\n       offense of continuous sexual abuse was completed after the new law became effective.\n       Because the last act necessary to trigger application of section 288.5 was an act of\n       molestation that defendant committed after section 288.5's effective date, defendant's\n       conviction was not a retroactive application of section 288.5 and therefore not a violation\n       of the statutory prohibition against retroactive application of the Penal Code.\" 20 Cal. 4th\n       at 157-58.\n\n\n       For Robinson, the last act or event necessary to trigger application of K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) was the murder of Trouten in Count II and the murder of Lewicka in Count\nIII. Both murders were committed subsequent to the enactment of the capital murder\nstatute. As in Grant, because the final acts necessary to trigger application of K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) were committed after the effective date of the statute, Robinson's convictions\nand the evidence supporting them do not constitute a retroactive application of the statute.\n\n                                                    239\n\f       Robinson relies on United States v.

In January 2006, he informed Illinois he was moving to\nOklahoma, and he registered in that state the following month. Defendant later fell out of\ncompliance and was arrested in Missouri in March 2007. It was undisputed that defendant\nhad relocated to Missouri prior to the effective date of 18 U.S.C. § 2250 (2006) of the\nSex Offender Registration and Notification Act. In order to convict a defendant under this\nstatute, the government must prove that a person required to register, travels in interstate\ncommerce and knowingly fails to register or update his registration. 545 F.3d at 1243.\nThe Tenth Circuit found that Congress' use of the word \"travels\" expressed an intent that\nthe statute not apply to those who had traveled in interstate commerce prior to enactment\nof the statute. 545 F.3d at 1243-44.\n\n\n       The holding in Husted is largely dependent on Congress' use of the word \"travels\"\nin the federal act, and no comparable language in our capital murder statute exists or\nsupports a similar construction. Moreover, in Husted, unlike here, defendant had\ncompleted all elements of the offense prior to enactment of the statute, and defendant's\nconviction could stand only by applying the statute retroactively. 545 F.3d at 1246. On\nthese grounds, Husted is factually and legally distinguishable.\n\n\n       Based on our construction of K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), Robinson completed the acts\nsatisfying elements of the charged offenses only after enactment of the statute. As such,\napplying the statute prospectively, the State's evidence was sufficient to support his\ncapital murder convictions under Counts II and III.\n\n\n\n\n                                            240\n\f                                          6.

The counts were identical in charging capital murder under K.S.A.\n21-3439(a)(6) for the murders of the principal victims, Trouten in Count II and Lewicka\nin Count III, as \"one of multiple acts or transactions constituting parts of a common\nscheme or course of conduct in which other human beings were killed in a premeditated\nand intentional manner, to-wit: Beverly J. Bonner, Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith and Lisa\nStasi.\" The jury convicted and sentenced Robinson to death on both counts. At trial,\nRobinson challenged his first-degree murder conviction, but not the capital convictions,\nas multiplicitous. Nevertheless, we consider both challenges in the interests of justice.\nSee Carr, 300 Kan. at 163-64.\n\n\n       The \"unit of prosecution\" under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) is the killing of more than\none person, and the killing of the second (and subsequent) victim(s) makes the murders\nof the group of victims punishable by death. As such, we have held previously that\nmultiple capital murder convictions under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) based on the killing of\nthe same victims are multiplicitous. Carr, 300 Kan. at 164; State v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n571-78, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2586244\"><a href=\"/opinion/2586244/state-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007).\n\n\n       The State acknowledges this precedent but argues it is distinguishable because not\nall of the victims of the multiple murders are listed in all of the capital counts of the\ncomplaint. Specifically, Trouten is not mentioned in Count III of the complaint and\nLewicka is not mentioned in Count II of the complaint. The State emphasizes language in\nHarris acknowledging that \"under other circumstances, a defendant may be convicted\nand punished appropriately and constitutionally on multiple counts of capital murder, as\nthat offense is defined in K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(1) through (7).\" 284 Kan. at 578. The State\nmaintains this case presents those \"other circumstances\" because the serial killings of\n\n                                              242\n\fTrouten and Lewicka constituted discrete acts rather than unitary conduct. Schoonover,\n281 Kan. at 464 (double jeopardy issue not raised where defendant convicted and\nsentenced for discrete and separate acts or courses of conduct but, instead, where conduct\nis unitary).\n\n\n       However, in Schoonover we acknowledged \"[t]he overarching inquiry is whether\nthe convictions are for the same offense.\" 281 Kan. at 496. Here, the legislature has\ndefined capital murder to include the killing of more than one person \"in two or more acts\nor transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\nconduct.\" K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). Because the legislature defined the offense to include\ntwo or more discrete acts or transactions, the unitary conduct inquiry here must\nnecessarily focus on the nature of the \"common scheme or course of conduct,\" not merely\non the \"killing of more than one person.\" See Schoonover, 281 Kan. at 472 (unit of\nprosecution not necessarily dependent on whether there is a single act or victim, but,\ninstead, the key is the nature of the conduct described; unit of prosecution can be\ndetermined by scope of the course of conduct defined by statute rather than discrete\nphysical acts composing that course of conduct); see also State v. Olsson, 2014-NMSC-\n012, ¶ 18, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">324</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (N.M. 2014) (relevant inquiry in a unit of prosecution case is\nwhether legislature intended punishment for the entire course of conduct or for each\ndiscrete act).\n\n\n       Here, the State alleged, argued, and proved that all of the murders in Counts II and\nIII were tied together by the same common scheme or course of conduct. The State did\nnot allege or prove the existence of a separate, distinct common scheme or course of\nconduct for each capital murder charge. The lone common scheme or course of conduct\nconnecting all murders charged in Counts II and III is properly characterized as unitary\nconduct under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). Also, by statutory definition, there is but one\noffense because the legislature defined the unit of prosecution as more than one murder\n                                            243\n\ftied together by or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct, even if\ncommitted in discrete acts. Robinson's capital murder convictions are multiplicitous.\n\n\n       Robinson believes the proper remedy is to reverse one capital conviction and\nresentence him on the other, reasoning that these convictions might have prejudiced the\njury against defendant \"by creating the impression of more criminal activity on his part\nthan in fact may have been present.\" To the contrary, we have consistently held that the\nremedy for multiplicitous convictions in unit of prosecution cases is the reversal of all but\none conviction based upon a single unit of prosecution. \"There can be only one\nconviction for each allowable unit of prosecution.\" Schoonover, 281 Kan. at 497-98; see\nHarris, 284 Kan. at 577-78. Robinson cites no authority directly supporting his theory of\nprejudice or resentencing as a proper remedy, and, even if there were, we hold \"the death\nverdict actually rendered in this trial was surely unattributable\" to the fact that the\nprosecution charged Robinson with two counts of capital murder instead of one, as both\nconvictions supported but one aggravating circumstance and no new evidence was\nadmitted during the penalty phase to support it.

In doing so, we emphasize and cannot overstate that\nthis holding in no way excuses Robinson's conduct or makes his murder of Lewicka any\nless reprehensible. Nor, we hope, should it reopen, heighten, or otherwise cheapen the\nterrible pain and suffering Robinson's conduct caused to Lewicka and the still living\nvictims of her murder. Had the State included her murder in Count II or alleged the\nexistence of a different common scheme or course of conduct in Count III, the situation\nwould be different.\n                                              244\n\fWas Robinson's first-degree murder conviction multiplicitous?\n\n         In addition to the two capital murder convictions, Robinson was also convicted\nand sentenced to life in prison with eligibility for parole after 15 years on Count V, the\nfirst-degree premeditated murder of Lisa Stasi.

EVIDENTIARY CHALLENGES\n\n       Robinson challenges a number of Judge Anderson's evidentiary rulings on appeal.\nSpecifically, he contends the trial court erred by: (1) admitting Cathy Norman's\n                                                   249\n\ftestimony regarding contents of a writing discussing victim Sheila Faith's sexual\nproclivities; (2) admitting e-mails in violation of the best evidence and authentication\nrules; (3) admitting evidence of uncharged homicides in violation of K.S.A. 60-445 and\nK.S.A. 60-455; (4) allowing the medical examiner to testify that Sheila Faith's injury was\nconsistent with a defensive wound; and (5) disparately ruling on defendant's hearsay\nobjections when compared with similar objections from the State.\n\n\nCathy Norman's Testimony Regarding the Contents of a Writing\n\n       1. Additional Factual and Procedural Background\n\n       Again, Cathy Norman was victim Sheila Faith's sister. At the end of her direct\nexamination, prosecutor Welch asked Norman whether Sheila Faith had an interest in\nBDS&M, which resulted in the following exchange:\n\n\n       \"[Prosecutor]: Now, ma'am, did you know if your sister Sheila—or are you aware that\n                      your sister, Sheila, had an interest in bondage and discipline and\n                      sadomasochistic sex?\n       \"[Norman]:     Yes.\n       \"[Prosecutor]: How do you know that?\n       \"[Norman]:     For some reason she had moved out of this house and my other sister,\n                      Michelle, and I had to clean it up and we found correspondence to where\n                      she was into the kinky sex.\n       \"[Prosecutor]: Anything in specific?\n       \"[Norman]:     Spanking.\n       \"[Prosecutor]: And do you know about how long ago this was?\n       \"[Norman]:     It was a long time ago.\n       \"[Prosecutor]: Was this the house in Texas?\n       \"[Norman]:     Yes.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                 250\n\f       Robinson lodged no objection. During cross-examination, defense counsel\neffectively challenged the reliability of this correspondence as proof of Sheila Faith's\ninterest in BDS&M, highlighting the fact that Norman found the writing more than 20\nyears prior, that she saw no other evidence of BDS&M activity at the time she found the\nwriting, and that she had not encountered any new information since then suggesting her\nsister held an interest in this subculture.\n\n\n       2.

See Bornholdt, 261 Kan. at 652. Her\ntestimony was relevant to the State's theory that Robinson's pattern of luring women for\nthe purpose of exploiting them sexually, often through BDS&M activities specifically,\nwas part of the common scheme or course of conduct charged under K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6). There was no lack of foundation or improper authentication of the\ncorrespondence because the State did not offer it into evidence. See K.S.A. 60-464\n(proper foundation required prior to receiving writing into evidence). While Norman\ntestified in general to the nature of the correspondence, she did so to explain the basis for\nher belief that Sheila was interested in BDS&M-related activities. Without an adequately\ndeveloped record, we cannot presume this testimony was offered for the truth of the\nmatter asserted. See State v.

In particular, Robinson believes these e-mails were unreliable because\nmost exhibits had been forwarded to law enforcement and printed, rather than printed\nfrom the original recipient's computer.\n\n\n       1.

Did admission of the e-mails violate the best evidence rule?\n\n       Robinson contends the trial court violated the best evidence rule by admitting\nnumerous e-mails that were forwarded to police rather than printed from the victims' or\nwitnesses' computers. Robinson also challenges exhibits containing e-mail strings rather\nthan individual, segregated messages.\n\n\n       The best evidence rule provides that \"[a]s tending to prove the content of a\nwriting, no evidence other than the writing itself is admissible, except as otherwise\nprovided in these rules.\" K.S.A. 60-467(a).

K.S.A. 60-467(a) does\nnot squarely address what constitutes an original for best evidence purposes when \"the\nwriting itself\" is stored electronically, and we have not had occasion to address the\nsubject previously.\n\n\n       In the absence of controlling authority, the parties turn to the federal equivalent of\nour best evidence rule. Like K.S.A. 60-467, the federal rule contemplates that \"[a]n\noriginal writing . . . is required in order to prove its content\" unless otherwise provided by\nrule or statute. Fed. R. Evid. 1002. More importantly, the federal rule specifically\ncontemplates that \"[f]or electronically stored information, 'original' means any printout—\nor other output readable by sight—if it accurately reflects the information.\" Fed. R. Evid.\n1001(d). This definition is consistent with Federal Rule of Evidence 1003, which\nprovides that \"[a] duplicate is admissible to the same extent as the original unless a\ngenuine question is raised about the original's authenticity or the circumstances make it\nunfair to admit the duplicate.\" A \"duplicate\" is defined as \"a counterpart produced by a\n                                             255\n\fmechanical, photographic, chemical, electronic, or other equivalent process or technique\nthat accurately reproduces the original.\" Fed R. Evid. 1001(e).\n\n\n       We regard the federal rule, along with similar state counterparts, as instructive,\nand we are persuaded by the authority interpreting these provisions. See Fredricks v.\nFoltz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1148619\"><a href=\"/opinion/1148619/fredricks-v-foltz/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1148619\"><a href=\"/opinion/1148619/fredricks-v-foltz/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1252</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976) (finding federal interpretations persuasive\nwhere state and federal rules similar).

In both those cases, the prosecution attempted to\nadmit photocopies of cancelled checks, instruments that formed the very subject of the\ncriminal charges. However, without the original checks, there were legitimate proof\nproblems in attempting to match the endorsements on the back of the checks.

Before her proffer\nto the district judge, Remington had testified that she sent an e-mail message to the\n\"eruditemaster\" address, received a response, and began communicating regularly with a\nman she came to know as \"James Turner,\" one of Robinson's known aliases.

One of those conversations, which was intercepted by\nwiretap and played for the jury, closely paralleled the content of the e-mail message\nadmitted as State's Exhibit 12. See State v.

The body of this e-mail message is\nidentical to the body of the message contained in State's Exhibit 11. The only difference\nbetween the exhibits is that the header information on State's Exhibit 11 shows the e-mail\nwas sent from Remington's e-mail account and the header information on State's Exhibit\n19EE shows the e-mail was received on Robinson's e-mail account. While State's Exhibit\n19EE was admitted after Judge Anderson had admitted State's Exhibits 11 and 12, it\nnevertheless confirms the accuracy of the contents of these exhibits.\n\n\n       Despite this evidence, Robinson argues the e-mails should have been excluded\nbecause of possible indicators of alteration. First, Robinson highlights a time stamp\ndiscrepancy between State's Exhibit 4 and State's Exhibit 5. State's Exhibit 4 contains a\ntime stamp indicating the first e-mail sent by Robinson to Remington was delivered at\n9:15 a.m. State's Exhibit 5, which includes the entire string of e-mails sent between the\ntwo on March 2, includes a time stamp indicating that the same message was sent at 8:15\na.m. Remington could not definitively explain the reason for the difference but confirmed\nthe 8:15 a.m. time stamp on State's Exhibit 5 did not originate from her computer; it came\nfrom Robinson's, suggesting the clocks on their computers were not synchronized or\nperhaps set to different time zones. Remington testified to the actual dates and times she\nsent and received the messages in these exhibits based on her independent recollection,\nand Robinson does not challenge the accuracy of their content. Judge Anderson's\nauthentication findings are supported by substantial competent evidence. See Schlaikjer\nv. Kaplan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">456</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 468, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013) (appellate courts accept findings\nsupported by substantial competent evidence).\n                                            263\n\f       Second, Robinson argues the header information in State's Exhibit 5 is suspicious.\nIn the first message of that e-mail string, the subject line read: \"I'm off.\" In the second\nmessage, the header read: \"Re: I'm off.\" In the third message, the subject line again read:\n\"Re: I'm off.\" During her proffer, Remington explained her e-mail program\nautomatically generated a \"Re:\" in the subject line when she responded to a message but\nthat not all e-mail programs did so. During cross-examination, Robinson's counsel\nsuggested the final message in Exhibit 5 should have included a \"Re: Re:\" in the subject\nline—apparently forgetting that the final message was sent by Robinson, not Remington.\nDefense counsel seemed to realize the oversight, withdrawing his line of questioning and\nabandoning the argument. Robinson's attempt to revive the issue is wholly unpersuasive.\n\n\n       Third, Robinson argues that all exhibits authenticated through Remington should\nhave been excluded due to her propensity to alter electronic messages. Remington sent\ninvestigators logs of her online chat sessions with Trouten in two separate e-mails. The\nfirst time, Remington included only the logs she thought were most relevant to the\ninvestigation. She later sent a complete set of the requested logs. Robinson believes\nRemington \"omitted material information\" and demonstrated \"a pattern of manipulating\ndocuments\" by sending an incomplete set of chat logs in her first e-mail. Judge Anderson\nrejected the argument, finding that Remington never said the first submission was\ncomplete and, in fact, disclosed otherwise. Indeed, in the first e-mail submission,\nRemington made clear she was including only a selection of her chat logs with Trouten.\nOnce again, Judge Anderson's finding is supported by substantial competent evidence.\n\n\n       Finally, Robinson argues State's Exhibits 11 and 12 are unreliable because the\nState redacted header information showing the e-mails had been forwarded to it by\nRemington. However, the defense received unredacted versions of these e-mails during\ndiscovery and nothing prevented counsel from using them on cross-examination.\n                                             264\n\fRemington's testimony confirmed the redacted versions of the e-mails were true and\naccurate copies of the original messages on her computer, and Robinson does not suggest\notherwise. In fact, in his brief, Robinson compares a redacted version of an e-mail to the\nunredacted version, and the content of the two messages is identical.\n\n\n       Remington's testimony and other corroborating evidence authenticated State's\nExhibits 4, 5, 11, and 12. Robinson's arguments founded on immaterial, technical\ndeviations in the writings failed to establish a genuine issue as to their accuracy. Such\narguments went to the weight, not the admissibility, of the evidence. See Gagliardi, 506\nF.3d at 151; United States v.

E-mails Sent to or from Tammi Taylor\n\n\n       Robinson next challenges the admission of State's Exhibits 13 to 16, which were e-\nmails sent to and from Trouten's friend, Tammi Taylor.\n\n\n       Prior to admitting these exhibits, Remington and Taylor testified that they were\nfriends of Trouten who shared an interest in BDS&M and talked regularly, often via\nonline chat messaging. In March 2000, Remington told Taylor she had been\ncommunicating with James Turner. Taylor jokingly told Remington to ask Turner if he\nknew any other available masters. Remington did just that, asking Robinson, posing as\nTurner, whether he knew of someone interested in serving as a master in a BDS&M\nrelationship with her friend Taylor. Robinson, posing as Turner, told Remington that\n\"Tom\" was interested and gave Remington \"Tom's\" e-mail address to pass on to Taylor.\nRemington told Taylor to contact \"Tom\" at \"preipo@usa.net.\"\n                                            265\n\f       Taylor sent an e-mail to \"Tom\" at this e-mail address, expressing her interest in a\nBDS&M relationship. Taylor received a response from \"Tom,\" identified as State's\nExhibit 13. The exhibit is a printout of an e-mail message from a person at\npreipo@usa.net. In the e-mail, the author provides some personal background\ninformation and outlines his rules and expectations as a master in BDS&M relationships.\nThe message is signed \"T.\" Taylor testified State's Exhibit 13 was a true and accurate\ncopy of the e-mail response she received from \"Tom.\"\n\n\n       Robinson objected to the admission of this e-mail because Taylor had forwarded\nthe e-mail to law enforcement officers, who then printed it from their computer system.\nJudge Anderson overruled the objection, explaining he would admit this and other e-mail\nexhibits, provided the witness could confirm accuracy.\n\n\n       Taylor then testified that after receiving this response from \"Tom,\" the two\nmaintained an ongoing e-mail relationship, communicating several times a week until\nRobinson's arrest in June 2000. Taylor identified State's Exhibit 14 as one of the e-mails\nshe received from \"Tom\" at preipo@usa.net. In that e-mail, Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\"\ngave Taylor BDS&M training activities to complete as his slave. Taylor confirmed the\nexhibit was a true and accurate copy of the message she received on her Hotmail account.\n\n\n       Taylor testified Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\" later began contacting her by phone.\nRobinson left Taylor a voicemail message, advising Taylor that he was replacing his\npreipo@usa.net address with a new account, mbdsm@hotmail.com. On May 28, 2000,\nTaylor received an e-mail from this new address, identified as State's Exhibit 15. In the\nmessage, Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\" asked Taylor to meet him in Kansas City. This\ntime, the e-mail was signed \"MASTER.\" Based on this testimony, Judge Anderson\nadmitted State's Exhibits 14 and 15.\n                                            266\n\f       Before accepting Robinson's invitation to meet him in Kansas City, Taylor asked\n\"Tom\" for a reference from a former submissive/slave. Robinson, posing as \"Tom,\" told\nTaylor she could talk to one of his former slaves at slavedancer@hotmail.com. Taylor\nsent an e-mail to the slavedancer address, explaining that \"Tom\" had given her this e-mail\naddress to learn more about him. Taylor received a response from this e-mail address,\nidentified as State's Exhibit 16, in which Robinson, posing as slavedancer, responded to\neach of Taylor's questions. Taylor confirmed the content was a true and accurate copy of\nthe message she originally received on her computer. The message refers to \"Tom\" as\n\"MASTER,\" just as \"Tom\" signed his name in Exhibit 15.\n\n\n       Additional record evidence corroborates the accuracy of these exhibits. When law\nenforcement searched Robinson's Olathe residence, they found a note with the\npreipo@usa.net address written on it. They also found a list of e-mail addresses and\npasswords, including slavedancer@hotmail.com, written on a sheet of legal paper, along\nwith e-mails confirming Robinson's registration of the slavedancer address on several e-\nmail servers. Taylor testified that her ongoing communication with \"Tom\" ceased after\nRobinson's arrest on June 2, 2000.\n\n\n       Robinson again highlights minor, technical variances, such as the location of caret\nsymbols on one of the e-mails, as evidence of possible alteration but does not specifically\ncontrovert Taylor's testimony or the additional circumstances corroborating the\nauthenticity of the messages. Taylor's testimony, along with the distinctive characteristics\nand subject matter of these interrelated messages, provide substantial competent evidence\nsupporting Judge Anderson's rulings on State's Exhibits 13 to 16. See Hill, 290 Kan. at\n366 (note properly authenticated where it included distinctive language and content\ncommon to defendant); see also Safavian, 435 F. Supp. 2d at 40 (e-mails authenticated\n\n\n                                            267\n\fwhere they included distinctive characteristics and addressed topics pertinent to parties'\ncommunications).\n\n\n              c. E-mail Sent to Chidester\n\n\n       Robinson argues the State failed to properly authenticate State's Exhibit 20, a copy\nof an e-mail sent from Trouten's Hotmail account to several family members, including\nTrouten's aunt, Marshalla Chidester, because the State redacted the header information\nshowing that Chidester had forwarded the e-mail to them.\n\n\n       However, Chidester testified the exhibit was identical to the e-mail she received\non her computer. Robinson did not controvert this testimony. Other evidence introduced\nafter Judge Anderson admitted State's Exhibit 20 corroborated its authenticity. For\nexample, Chidester was convinced the e-mail was fraudulent because the word choices,\nstyle, and format were not consistent with Trouten's writing. Also, when law enforcement\nofficers searched Robinson's Olathe storage unit, they found a contact list Trouten had\nprepared with Chidester's assistance that included e-mail addresses for all four recipients\nof State's Exhibit 20. Law enforcement also seized e-mails confirming that Trouten had\ngiven her login and password information to Robinson, including the information to\naccess the Hotmail account used to send State's Exhibit 20. We hold there was no error.\n\n\n              d. Lewicka E-mails\n\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge erred by admitting three e-mail exchanges\nbetween Izabela Lewicka and her father, Andrzej, admitted as State's Exhibits 69 to 71.\nRobinson challenges the exhibits because they contain e-mail strings rather than\nsegregated messages admitted as separate exhibits.\n\n\n                                            268\n\f      Andrzej confirmed the accuracy of these exhibits, and Robinson does not\ncontrovert this testimony. Judge Anderson's rulings are supported by substantial\ncompetent evidence, and we find no error in the admission of these exhibits.\n\n\n             e. E-mails Seized Pursuant to Search Warrant\n\n\n      Finally, Robinson argues Judge Anderson erroneously admitted State's Exhibits\n19EE, 19NN-RR, 19TT-WW, 19XX, 52O, and 52Q because they were introduced\nthrough law enforcement officers rather than the parties to the messages.\n\n\n      Robinson's challenge to State's Exhibit 19EE is plainly without merit. Detective\nLayman testified this e-mail from Remington to Robinson, posing as Turner or JT, was\nseized during the search of Robinson's Olathe storage locker. The body of the message is\nidentical to State's Exhibit 11, which was authenticated independently through\nRemington's proffer. See United States v. Safavian, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">3d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 36, 40 (D.D.C.\n2006) (e-mails may be authenticated by other specimens that have already been\nindependently authenticated).\n\n\n      State's Exhibits 19NN-RR, 19TT-XX, 52O, and 52Q are a series of e-mail\ncommunications between Robinson and Trouten. The messages were sent to or from\nTrouten at her \"peka@tdi.net\" e-mail address and most include conversations touching on\nvarious BDS&M topics.\n\n\n      Detective Layman testified that law enforcement seized State's Exhibits 19NN-RR\nand 19TT-XX from inside a brown briefcase during the search of Robinson's storage\nlocker in Olathe. During this search, law enforcement also seized a number of items\nbelonging to Trouten. Detective Owsley testified that law enforcement seized State's\nExhibits 52O and 52Q from inside a black, soft-sided case inside a closet during the\n                                           269\n\fsearch of Robinson's residence in Olathe. This testimony was sufficient to authenticate\nthe documents found in Robinson's possession or under his control.

We have adopted a\nmultistep analysis for determining the admission of such evidence and defined the\nstandard of review applicable to each step:\n\n\n              \"Determining whether evidence was properly admitted pursuant to K.S.A. 60-\n      455 requires several steps. The appellate court must determine that the fact to be proven\n      is material, e.g., concerning intent, motive, knowledge, or identity. In other words, the\n      court must determine whether the fact has a legitimate and effective bearing on the\n      decision in the case. The appellate court standard of review for materiality is de novo.\n      The appellate court must also determine whether the material fact is disputed, i.e., the\n      element or elements being considered must be substantially at issue in the case. The\n                                                  270\n\f       appellate court must also determine whether the evidence presented is relevant to prove\n       the disputed material fact, i.e., whether it has any tendency in reason to prove that fact.\n       The appellate court reviews relevance—in particular, the probative element—of K.S.A.\n       60-455 evidence for abuse of discretion. The burden of proof is on the party alleging the\n       discretion is abused. The court must also determine whether the probative value of the\n       evidence outweighs the potential for producing undue prejudice.

Did admission of Carlos Ibarra's testimony violate K.S.A 60-455?\n\n       During the State's direct examination, Carlos Ibarra, a maintenance employee,\ntestified that Robinson frequently talked about his girlfriend and asked Ibarra to find a\n\"Mexican woman . . . for him.\" Defense counsel objected, but the district judge overruled\nafter the State explained the evidence was relevant to establishing Robinson's common\nscheme or course of conduct. Ibarra then testified that Robinson wanted him to find \"a\ngood looking woman from Mexico\" and that he would lease an apartment for her and\nhandle her immigration issues, provided they were sexually compatible. Ibarra also\ntestified that Robinson showed him a nude picture of a \"girlfriend\" depicted in a\nBDS&M-themed pose.\n\n\n       Robinson argues this testimony, particularly Robinson's request to be set up with\n\"a good looking woman from Mexico,\" violated K.S.A. 60-455 because the implication\nwas that he sought an additional victim to exploit sexually and then murder, improperly\ndemonstrating propensity to commit the charged crimes.

This fact was material\nbecause it supported the State's theory that Robinson's luring and exploitation were\ncomponents of his common scheme or course of conduct under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\n\n\n       More importantly, the challenged testimony falls outside the scope of K.S.A. 60-\n455. Under its plain language, the statute specifically limits application of this provision\n\"'to situations involving \"evidence that a person committed a crime or civil wrong on a\nspecified occasion\" to infer a person has the disposition or propensity to \"commit[ ]\nanother crime or civil wrong on another specified occasion.\"'\" (Emphasis added.)

Ibarra's testimony did not establish that Robinson\ncommitted a crime or civil wrong on a specified occasion. Robinson's request that Ibarra\nset him up with another woman was not a crime or civil wrong.\n\n\n       Robinson argues this testimony implied he made the request in hopes of luring a\nwoman from Mexico and then murdering her.

The argument flies in the face\nof the plain language of K.S.A. 60-455, which requires exclusion only where the\nevidence concerning a prior act constitutes a crime or civil wrong. Also, defendant\nmisconstrues Warledo. There, the State argued K.S.A. 60-455 did not apply because\ndefendant's prior acts did not constitute criminal offenses. We rejected the argument,\nexpressly finding the acts in question \"were criminal acts.\" 286 Kan. at 942. Having\ndetermined the witness testified to defendant's prior crimes, we then analyzed whether\nsuch crimes inferred propensity to commit the charged offenses.

We see no error.\n\n\n       3. Did admission of Jean Glines' testimony violate K.S.A 60-455?\n\n       Again, Glines was a former employee of Nancy Robinson at a mobile home park\nin Independence, Missouri. Glines met Robinson while working for his wife. In January\n1997, Glines moved to California and her marriage later dissolved. Robinson told Glines\nhe and Nancy had also divorced, and they began a long-distance relationship,\ncommunicating by phone, letters, and e-mails.\n\n\n       In March 2000, Robinson asked Glines to mail some letters for him from\nCalifornia. Glines agreed to mail the letters if Robinson stopped calling her. The\nprosecutor asked Glines why she wanted Robinson to stop calling her, and she explained:\n\n\n       \"He was wanting me to come back here and live with him, work for him and totally\n       abandon, so to speak—or never speak to any family again. As to the fact that my kids\n       were in California, I was out there with them. I guess I talked about them a lot when we\n       talked on the phone. He didn't seem to care for the fact that I had other interests besides\n       him. He wanted me to give up my family and my grandkids or my grandchild and come\n       and work with him and live with him.\"\n\n\n       Defense counsel lodged no objection to Glines' testimony. Robinson now argues\nGlines' testimony, particularly her comments that Robinson asked her to move back to\nKansas, live with him, work for him, and never speak to her family again, violated K.S.A.\n60-455. Once again, the testimony did not establish that Robinson committed a particular\ncrime or civil wrong on a particular occasion and falls outside the scope of the statute.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   274\n\f       Robinson argues adultery is a crime under Kansas law, K.S.A. 21-3507, and that\nGlines' testimony regarding his solicitation to commit adultery constituted an attempt to\ncommit that crime. Yet Glines' testimony did not clearly establish Robinson's solicitation\nto commit adultery. Even if it had, mere solicitation to commit adultery is not an attempt\nto commit the crime. See State v.

Did testimony of tools seized during Linn County search violate K.S.A 60-455?\n\n\n       During the execution of the warrant to search Robinson's Linn County property,\nlaw enforcement seized nine hammers, two picks, and a chisel from various locations on\nthe property. Robinson moved in limine to exclude testimony regarding the number of\n                                            275\n\ftools seized. In response, the State argued that it intended to introduce testimony that\nthose items were seized during the search and that experts found no blood, tissue, or other\ntrace evidence on them, but that such items could be cleaned easily. The district judge\ndenied the motion, explaining:\n\n\n               \"It's very relevant; it has probative value; the Court finds little or no prejudicial\n       effect with respect to the numbers that we're dealing with here. Given that we're talking\n       about a rural location and a dwelling that was in the process of being refurbished over a\n       period of time, based upon the testimony I've heard thus far, and it becomes a question of\n       weight.\"\n\n\n       At trial, the medical examiners testified the victims died as a result of blunt force\nbrain trauma inflicted with a hard object, and one medical examiner testified specifically\nthat the injuries were consistent with those inflicted by a hammer. Rundle, a forensic\nchemist with the JOCO Lab, confirmed that nine hammers, two picks, and one chisel\nwere seized for further forensic examination during the Linn County search. Detective\nBooth testified that he looked at these items under a microscope to examine all the\ncrevices and defects on the tools—\"anyplace where blood or tissue would be hiding.\"\nOccasionally he also used a Hemostik to test for the presence of blood. Nevertheless,\nBooth confirmed he found no blood, tissue, or hair on any of these tools.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the trial court erred by allowing Rundle to testify to the number\nof tools seized during the search because it \"implied some sort of obsession with the type\nof weapon purportedly used to kill Suzette Trouten, as well as the defendant's desire to\nkill yet more women in the same manner and at the same place.\" Clearly, Rundle did not\ntestify to a prior crime within the meaning of K.S.A. 60-455, and Judge Anderson did not\nerr in admitting the testimony under this statutory provision.\n\n\n\n                                                    276\n\f       Robinson also claims that Rundle's testimony was improper because there was not\na sufficient connection between the tools and the defendant or the charges against him.\nThe tools were not admitted as physical evidence. Instead, the State's witnesses merely\ntestified to the fact of their seizure and subsequent testing for trace evidence. Even so, our\nprecedent addressing the admission of physical evidence provides useful guidance.\n\n\n       \"The admissibility of physical evidence is based on its relevance in connection\nwith the accused and the crime charged. Physical evidence should be admitted unless it is\nclearly irrelevant. The jury may attribute such weight and effect as it sees fit. [Citation\nomitted.]\" State v.

There the State\nintroduced testimony that drugs were taken from defendant's car at the time of his arrest.\nThe district judge allowed this testimony as res gestae because it showed defendant's\ninvolvement with drugs in a case where the State's theory was that defendant murdered\nthe victim in retaliation for testifying in another drug case. However, we held that the\ntestimony was \"clearly not part of the res gestae\" because the drugs were seized 10 days\nafter the commission of the charged offenses and had no direct connection to them.\nBornholdt, 261 Kan. at 659-60. Here the victims were killed by blunt-force trauma\ninflicted by a hard object consistent with the tools seized on Robinson's property. These\ntools were recovered close in time and proximity to the bodies and trace evidence of the\nvictims. Bornholdt is distinguishable.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor's proffer for the admission of Rundle's testimony\nwas misleading because experts did not testify that blood could be removed easily from\nthe tools, and evidence admitted under such false pretenses violated his right to due\nprocess. However, this argument assumes Judge Anderson's ruling was dependent on the\nprosecutor's proffer that crime lab experts would testify that hammers can be cleaned\neasily. This was not the case. Judge Anderson found the testimony was clearly relevant\nbased on the totality of the circumstances. Nothing suggests the admission of this\ntestimony was dependent on the prosecutor's proffer regarding the expert's testimony.\nFurthermore, defense counsel, not the prosecution, elicited the testimony from the State's\nexperts on cross-examination that it would be difficult to wash away blood from certain\ncrevices of certain hammers. Nothing in the record suggests the State anticipated this\ntestimony. Moreover, by establishing that forensic investigators found no trace evidence,\ndespite extensive investigation and the difficulty in removing blood from certain tools,\n                                            278\n\fRobinson demonstrated that Rundle's testimony gave rise to no adverse inferences.\nRobinson fails to demonstrate an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n       5. Did Loretta Mattingly's testimony compel a mistrial?\n\n       Robinson believes the trial court should have granted his motion for mistrial after\nwitness Loretta Mattingly failed to testify in accordance with the prosecutor's proffer. To\nunderstand the nuances of the challenge, a summary of the procedural facts and\nbackground is in order.\n\n\n       Mattingly managed the rental of storage units at Stor-Mor For Less in Raymore,\nMissouri (Stor-Mor). In December 1993, Robinson rented unit F-10 at Stor-Mor under\nBonner's name and maintained possession of the unit until Summer 1996. In January\n1994, Robinson leased a second unit at Stor-Mor, unit E-2, under Bonner's name and\nmaintained possession through his arrest in June 2000.\n\n\n       At preliminary hearing, Mattingly testified on cross-examination that she never\nreceived any complaints from other renters about noises or smells from Robinson's\nstorage units. On redirect, Mattingly clarified she had never received any complaints\nrelated to unit E-2, but when the prosecutor asked about unit F-10, Mattingly said:\n\n\n       \"There was a problem with one of the units behind [F-10] of a mattress that had gotten\n       damaged, and I did walk by and see Mr. Robinson cleaning out F10. And when the other\n       person behind went to move out, there was stuff all over a mattress that had bleeded [sic]\n       through and he told me it was a raccoon. . . . A raccoon had gotten in there.\"\n\n\n       At trial, the State intended to establish that Robinson stored the barrels containing\nthe bodies of Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith, and Beverly Bonner in unit F-10 but moved\nthem to unit E-2 and wrapped them in plastic after they began to leak. To support this\n                                                  279\n\fargument, the State planned to have Mattingly testify to the odor or property damage\ncomplaint concerning unit F-10, in addition to having police testify that the barrels found\nin unit E-2 had been wrapped in large plastic sheeting with kitty litter placed along the\nbottom to form a dam that would contain seepage of biological fluids.\n\n\n       At trial, the defense objected when the prosecutor asked Mattingly if she received\nany complaints related to Robinson's lease of unit F-10, arguing the testimony called for\nhearsay and was irrelevant and prejudicial. Prosecutor Welch proffered outside the\npresence of the jury that Mattingly would testify that she received an odor complaint\nfrom a lessee of a unit adjacent to unit F-10, that she told Robinson about it, that she saw\ndefendant cleaning up some kind of bloody fluid outside unit F-10 soon thereafter, and\nthat defendant told her a dead raccoon was the source. Prosecutor Welch argued jurors\ncould reasonably infer from the proffered testimony that Robinson previously stored the\nbarrels containing the victims' bodies in unit F-10; they leaked, causing another renter to\ncomplain of an odor; and Robinson cleaned up the seepage and moved the barrels to unit\nE-2, carefully wrapping them in plastic to avoid any further incident. The prosecutor\noffered Mattingly's testimony regarding the complaint to explain her future action, i.e.,\ninforming Robinson that she had received a complaint, not for the truth of the matter\nasserted. The judge asked, \"[S]he's going to testify that she encountered him cleaning out\nthe lockers?\" Prosecutor Welch responded, \"Yes, and that his explanation was there was a\ndead raccoon in there; from his mouth, there was a dead raccoon in there.\"\n\n\n       Judge Anderson overruled Robinson's objections, allowing Mattingly to \"testify in\naccordance with the proffer.\" The district judge provided a limiting instruction so the jury\nwould not consider the lessee's complaint for the truth of the matter asserted.\n\n\n       After the jury had been instructed, the prosecutor conducted the following\nexamination of Mattingly:\n                                            280\n\f       \"Q.     Did you ever receive a complaint about F10?\n       \"A.     I did when somebody was moving out.\n       \"Q.     All right. And what was the complaint?\n       \"A.     Was that something had leaked through from one of the other units and ruined a\n       mattress.\n       \"Q.     All right. And who did you notify about that?\n       \"A.     Mr. Robinson.\n       \"Q.     Okay. And what did you tell him?\n       \"A.     I told him that whatever he had used cleaning his unit had leaked through to\n       another one.\n       \"Q.     And after you told him this, did you see Mr. Robinson at that unit?\n       \"A.     I had seen him before.\n       \"Q.     Okay. And what had you seen him doing?\n       \"A.     Cleaning something out of there with—like some kind of soap solution.\"\n\n\n       At this juncture, the defense renewed its objection, arguing the testimony was\ninconsistent with the proffer because Mattingly testified that she observed Robinson\ncleaning unit F-10 before the complaint, not after, as suggested in the proffer, and the\nliquid was a cleaning solution, not a bloody substance, as stated in the proffer. Robinson\nalso moved for a mistrial based on the improper inference that Robinson had dead bodies\nin barrels in unit F-10. Judge Anderson found Mattingly's testimony was inconsistent\nwith the proffer and unreliable. He denied the motion for mistrial but did instruct the jury\nto disregard Mattingly's testimony on the subject.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecution \"misrepresented its own evidence\" in the proffer,\nand the district judge's refusal to declare a mistrial left the jury with \"the distinct\nimpression that Mr. Robinson had killed or wished to kill yet other women, stuffed them\ninto yet other barrels, and kept them in yet another storage unit—all on the basis of a\nfalse proffer from the State.\"\n\n                                                  281\n\f       To warrant a mistrial, the trial court must decide if there is a fundamental failure\nof the proceeding, and if so, whether it is possible to continue without an injustice. See\nK.S.A. 22-3423(c); State v. Ward, 292 Kan, 541, 550, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2460345\"><a href=\"/opinion/2460345/state-v-ward/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011), cert. denied\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1594</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012). Robinson's claim does not warrant relief under this standard.\n\n\n       First, there was no fundamental failure of the proceeding. A close examination of\nMattingly's preliminary hearing testimony and the State's proffer undercuts Robinson's\nclaim that prosecutor Welch intentionally misrepresented Mattingly's testimony in her\nproffer to the court. Prosecutor Welch proffered that Mattingly, consistent with her\nstatements during preliminary hearing, would testify that (1) she received an odor\ncomplaint regarding unit F-10; (2) she informed Robinson; (3) a short time later, she\nobserved him cleaning unit F-10 to remove a bloody, \"yucky\" fluid; and (4) Robinson's\nexplanation for the fluid was that there was a dead raccoon in his unit. Mattingly's\npreliminary hearing testimony was generally consistent with the proffer.\n\n\n       The most significant variance among Mattingly's preliminary hearing testimony,\nthe prosecutor's proffer, and Mattingly's trial testimony concerned the timing or sequence\nof these events—specifically, the point in time at which Mattingly observed Robinson\ncleaning unit F-10. The precise sequence of events was important because if Mattingly\nobserved Robinson cleaning unit F-10 subsequent to the lessee's complaint, the logical\ninference was that some other foreign substance caused the mattress stain, i.e., biological\nfluid from a raccoon, according to Robinson, or seepage from the barrels holding the\nbodies of the victims, according to the State. However, if Mattingly observed Robinson\ncleaning unit F-10 with a cleaning solution before the lessee's complaint, then the\ninference was that the cleaning solution itself stained the mattress. As such, the sequence\nof the events determined whether Mattingly's testimony was inculpatory or benign.\n\n\n                                            282\n\f       It was not until Mattingly's direct examination at trial that she clarified that she\nhad first observed Robinson cleaning unit F-10 and then, at a later point in time, received\nthe complaint from the third-party lessee. Once this testimony came out and the sequence\nof events was made clear, the reasonable inference was that the cleaning solution\nRobinson had used, not seepage of biological fluid from a dead raccoon or bodies in\nbarrels, damaged the adjacent lessee's mattress. In fact, Mattingly testified that she told\nRobinson that his cleaning solution had leaked through to the adjacent unit. These\ncircumstances demonstrate the prosecutor did not intentionally or maliciously\nmisrepresent Mattingly's testimony in her proffer. They also demonstrate that Mattingly's\ntestimony was not prejudicial and, in fact, worked to Robinson's benefit.\n\n\n       Not only was Mattingly's trial testimony stripped of the inculpatory content\ndescribed in the State's proffer, but also the district judge instructed the jury to disregard\nit altogether. \"The general rule is that an admonition to the jury normally cures the\nprejudice from an improper admission of evidence.\" State v.

Did Judge Anderson err in allowing the medical examiner's testimony\n       regarding defensive wounds?\n\n       Jackson County Medical Examiner Thomas Young performed autopsies on the\nthree victims found inside barrels at Robinson's Missouri storage unit. Young testified to\nvarious injuries he observed during Sheila Faith's autopsy, concluding that the cause of\ndeath was the result of blunt-force trauma to the head. Young also testified Sheila Faith\nhad sustained a fracture to her right ulna at a point located close to her wrist. After\nidentifying this injury, prosecutor Morrison asked, \"Would that be consistent with a\ndefensive wound?\" Defense counsel objected, arguing the question called for speculation.\nJudge Anderson allowed defense counsel to voir dire the expert.\n\n\n       The defense made the following inquiries during voir dire of Young:\n\n\n       \"[COUNSEL]: Do you have any idea where that hand or arm was at the time\n                      that injury was inflicted?\n       ....\n       \"[YOUNG]:      Are you asking what was the position of the hand? No, I don't know.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: It may have been at the side as likely as raised (indicating)?\n       \"[YOUNG]:       Sure.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: So the truth is you don't know whether that injury was inflicted in any\n                      type of defensive posture by the victim or not, do you?\n       \"[YOUNG]:       It is consistent with a defensive, warding off a defensive blow. Could I\n                      tell in and of itself that was the case, I can't tell. I can say it's consistent\n                      though.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: It could be?\n       \"[YOUNG]:      It's consistent with it.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: You have no personal knowledge of that, nor does your examination\n                      reveal the position of the arm at the time that it was broken; is that true?\n       \"[YOUNG]:      Okay. In terms of personal knowledge, I wasn't there at the time. I just\n                      performed an autopsy. In terms of the position that the arms or hand was\n\n                                                   284\n\f                     in at the time the blow was inflicted, that's not something that you would\n                     determine from an autopsy.\n       \"[COUNSEL]: You did not determine that?\n       \"[YOUNG]:     As I said, it's not something that you would determine from an\n                     autopsy.\"\n\n\nThe defense renewed its objection. The district judge overruled it, reasoning the question\nwas whether the injury was consistent with a defensive blow, not whether the injury was\nin fact a defensive wound, and the challenge went to the weight, not the admissibility, of\nthe testimony.\n\n\n       The State had established Young's education, training, and experience on direct\nexamination, which demonstrated his competence to render an opinion on the subject.\nDefense counsel's voir dire did not otherwise challenge these qualifications. In this\nregard, Young was sufficiently qualified from his prior knowledge and experience to\ntestify on this subject. See K.S.A. 60-419.\n\n\n       Robinson suggests the testimony was not useful to the jury. However, the defense\ndid not object to Young's testimony on this basis at trial, and therefore, the record\nprovides no basis in fact to support this new theory of error on appeal. We cannot say that\nno reasonable jurist would have allowed Young's testimony. See Moore v.

Did Judge Anderson's hearsay rulings violate due process?\n\n       Robinson argues the district judge failed to apply the hearsay rules consistently\nbetween similarly situated challenges of the defendant and the State. Specifically,\nRobinson relies on two examples to support his substantive due process challenge.\n\n\n       First, Robinson points to Judge Anderson's ruling allowing Kathy Klingensmith,\nStasi's sister, and Overland Park Sergeant Ronald Wissel to testify over defense objection\nthat a desk clerk at the Roadway Inn told Klingensmith that Robinson, not John Osborne,\nhad paid for Lisa Stasi's motel room. The State argued, and Judge Anderson agreed, that\nthe testimony was offered to explain Klingensmith's future actions; specifically, her\ndecision to file a missing persons report. Yet, during the defense's questioning of Wissel,\nJudge Anderson sustained the State's hearsay objection and did not allow him to testify to\nthe names of other persons of interest in the Stasi investigation, even though such\n                                            286\n\ftestimony, according to Robinson, would have explained Wissel's future investigative\nactions.\n\n\n       Robinson's argument is unsupported by the record. During recross of Wissel, the\ndefense asked if he had completed any independent investigation before handing the case\nover to Detective Scott. Wissel said he had called Robinson's business, Equi II. Defense\ncounsel then asked, \"And you got names, several names, from your investigation at that\nlocation; is that correct?\" Wissel agreed. Defense counsel began listing the names \"Jim\nLions, Bob—,\" at which point the State lodged its hearsay objection and the district judge\nsustained it. The defense made no proffer or argument in support of its line of\nquestioning. It simply moved on. Robinson did not argue the testimony was being elicited\nto explain Wissel's future investigative actions. As such, Robinson fails to establish that\nJudge Anderson's rulings on these competing hearsay objections were similarly situated,\nand we find no due process violation.\n\n\n       In his second example, Robinson compares two allegedly inconsistent rulings\nunder the \"persons present\" hearsay exception in K.S.A. 60-460(a). First, Robinson\nhighlights Judge Anderson's decision to exclude certain testimony from Suzette Trouten's\nformer landlord, John Stapleton. Stapleton testified that Suzette Trouten told him she was\nmoving to Kansas to undergo cancer treatment. Stapleton was also prepared to testify that\nwhen he informed Carolyn Trouten of this fact, she instructed him not to share this\ninformation with law enforcement. When Robinson attempted to elicit this testimony\nfrom Stapleton, the district judge sustained the State's hearsay objection. Robinson argues\nthis ruling is inconsistent with Judge Anderson's decision to allow Detective Brown to\ntestify, over Robinson's hearsay objection, to Carolyn Trouten's declarations concerning\nthe last time she spoke to her daughter.\n\n\n\n\n                                            287\n\f       The record confirms that Judge Anderson did not disparately apply the \"persons\npresent\" hearsay rule under K.S.A. 60-460(a). In interpreting and applying K.S.A. 60-\n460(a) in connection with Brown's testimony, Judge Anderson explained that under the\nperson's present exception, \"as long as the subject matter was inquired into earlier [with\nthe declarant] and there's been an opportunity to cross-examine as to the subject matter,\n[the prosecutor] can go into it [with the third party witness] without it being hearsay.\"\nBrown testified that Carolyn Trouten informed him that she last spoke to Suzette late in\nthe evening of February 29 or during the early morning hours of March 1, 2000. During\ndirect examination, Carolyn Trouten testified to these facts, and she was subject to cross-\nexamination from Robinson. As such, Judge Anderson properly found Brown's testimony\nregarding Carolyn Trouten's declarations were admissible under K.S.A. 60-460(a). In\ncontrast, Carolyn Trouten did not address the subject of Stapleton's testimony during her\ndirect or cross-examination, and therefore, his testimony regarding Carolyn Trouten's\ndeclarations were not admissible under K.S.A. 60-460(a). See State v. Wilson, 35 Kan.\nApp. 2d 333, 338, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006) (police officer's testimony regarding declarant's\nstatements improperly admitted where declarant was available but was not called and did\nnot testify to subject of officer's testimony).\n\n\n       The district judge arrived at different rulings between Stapleton and Brown, not\nbecause he applied the rules in an arbitrary or disparate fashion, but because the facts\nsupported different rulings under K.S.A. 60-460(a). We hold there was no due process\nviolation.\n\n\n       Robinson also claims these rulings were invalid under state hearsay rules. Our\nanalysis above suggests otherwise. Judge Anderson's rulings were supported by\nsubstantial competent evidence, and we cannot conclude from the record that no\nreasonable jurist would have agreed with them. We hold there was no abuse of discretion.\n\n\n                                              288\n\f                    9. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE—COUNTS I AND V\n\n       Robinson claims the evidence was insufficient to support the jury's convictions on\nCount I, aggravated kidnapping of Trouten, and Count V, first-degree premeditated\nmurder of Stasi. Independently, he argues the State relied on multiple acts to prove a\nsingle aggravated kidnapping charge and the district court's failure to provide a special\nunanimity instruction constituted clear error.\n\n\nSufficiency of the Evidence Supporting Counts I and V\n\n       1.

Was the State's evidence sufficient to support Robinson's aggravated kidnapping\n       conviction?\n\n       Robinson advances two specific challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting his aggravated kidnapping conviction under Count I. First, he argues the State\nfailed to provide sufficient evidence of a taking by deception. Robinson also claims the\nState failed to prove he took Trouten with specific intent to inflict bodily injury upon her.\n\n\n       At the time Robinson committed the offense, kidnapping included \"the taking or\nconfining of any person, accomplished by force, threat or deception, with intent to hold\nsuch person: . . . (c) to inflict bodily injury or to terrorize the victim or another.\" K.S.A.\n                                                    289\n\f21-3420. The Criminal Code defined \"deception\" as \"knowingly and willfully making a\nfalse statement or representation, express or implied, pertaining to a present or past\nexisting fact.\" K.S.A. 21-3110(5). \"Aggravated kidnapping is kidnapping . . . when\nbodily harm is inflicted upon the person kidnapped.\" K.S.A. 21-3421.\n\n\n       In Count I of the Fourth Amended Complaint, the State alleged:\n\n       \"That between the 12th day of February, 2000, and the 1st day of March, 2000, in the\n       City of Lenexa, County of Johnson, State of Kansas, JOHN EDWARD ROBINSON, SR,\n       did then and there unlawfully, knowingly, willfully and feloniously take a person, to wit:\n       Suzette Marie Trouten, by force and or threat and or deception with the intent to hold\n       such person to inflict bodily injury on another, to-wit: Suzette Marie Trouten, and did\n       inflict bodily harm on Suzette Marie Trouten, a severity level 1 person felony, in\n       violation of K.S.A. 21-3421, K.S.A. 21-4704 and K.S.A. 21-4707.\"\n\n\nAt trial, the State's theory was that Robinson kidnapped Trouten by deception, with the\nspecific intent of killing her, and that he, in fact, accomplished this purpose.\n\n\n               a. Did the evidence establish a taking by deception?\n\n       Robinson first challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the State's\ntheory that Robinson took Trouten by way of deception. At trial, the State advanced two\narguments in support of this theory. First, the prosecution argued Trouten was taken by\ndeception when Robinson lured her from Michigan to Kansas with false promises of\nemployment and travel, for the specific purpose of killing her. Second, the prosecutor\nargued the jury could possibly find that Trouten was taken by deception when Robinson\nlured her to his Linn County property under the guise of fulfilling her BDS&M fantasy.\n\n\n       The State provided substantial evidence in support of its first theory of taking by\ndeception. Trouten's mother testified that in the summer of 1999, Trouten told her that\n                                                  290\n\fRobinson had offered her a job caring for his elderly father. Trouten explained the job\nwould allow her to travel with them to business meetings overseas. Trouten also told her\nfriends about the opportunity. She told Taylor that she would care for the elderly father of\na man named \"John\" and accompany them while they traveled domestically and abroad.\nTrouten told Remington she would earn $6,500 a month and travel to Australia and\nHawaii. Trouten provided similar descriptions of the job and travel opportunities to her\nfather, aunt, and Michigan employer. Trouten traveled to Kansas City on two occasions\nin the fall of 1999, purportedly to interview for the position and find a place to live.\n\n\n       This testimony was corroborated by Trouten's subsequent conduct and other\ncircumstantial evidence. Before the move to Johnson County, Carolyn Trouten observed\nher daughter researching overseas educational opportunities, and Trouten began filling\nout a passport application, a copy of which was seized during the search of Robinson's\nOlathe storage unit. Robinson reserved a room for Trouten at the Guesthouse Suites\nunder his company's name, Specialty Publications. When Robinson boarded Trouten's\ntwo dogs at a veterinary clinic, he said the dogs belonged to his employee. While in\nKansas, Trouten called her mother almost every day, updating her on the trip itinerary.\nEarly morning on March 1, 2000, Trouten told her mother she was leaving with Robinson\non their trip later that day. Trouten's journal, recovered during the search of Robinson's\nOlathe storage unit, included an entry dated February 21 where Trouten wrote: \"Found\nout this morning that we will be leaving for the trip next Monday. I am excited about\ngoing.\" In online chat sessions, Remington and Trouten discussed her work for and\nrelationship with Robinson. After her disappearance, Robinson posed as Trouten and sent\ncommunications to her family explaining she had left town on an \"adventure of a\nlifetime.\" When Carolyn Trouten called Robinson to find her daughter, Robinson said,\n\"'Well, she had met some man, a Jim Turner, and that she decided not to take the job, and\nthat they were traveling.'\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n                                             291\n\f       This evidence was more than sufficient to prove Robinson took Trouten by\ndeception; specifically, making false representations of employment and/or travel\nopportunities.

Robinson's\nformer paramour, Aleisa Cox, testified that Robinson had her draft similar letters to her\nfamily members before they were supposedly scheduled to leave on a trip to Europe—a\ntrip that ultimately fell through. Trouten's family continued to receive typewritten letters\nsigned by Trouten that they believed were fraudulent.

The argument invites the court to reweigh the competing evidence and substitute our\njudgment in place of the jury's. This we cannot do. Together, the evidence establishing\nRobinson's common scheme and course of conduct, along with his extensive planning\nand preparation for Trouten's murder, was sufficient for a reasonable juror to conclude\nthat he took Trouten by deception with the specific intent to inflict bodily injury upon\nher. See Durbish, 234 Kan. at 717 (specific intent may be shown by acts, circumstances,\nand inferences reasonably deducible from them).\n\n\n       3. Was the State's evidence sufficient to support Robinson's first-degree murder\n       conviction?\n\n       Robinson next challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his first-\ndegree premeditated murder conviction for the killing of Lisa Stasi, as alleged in Count\nV. Robinson believes the evidence was insufficient because Stasi's body was never found\nand that the evidence does not tie him to her disappearance.\n\n\n       As discussed in the analysis of the multiplicity issue, we are reversing Robinson's\nfirst-degree premeditated murder conviction under Count V because it is\nunconstitutionally multiplicitous with his capital murder conviction under Count II,\nwhich also alleged that Robinson killed Stasi intentionally and with premeditation as part\nof his common scheme or course of conduct. Given our holding on the multiplicity issue,\n\n                                            295\n\fwe need not address Robinson's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\nhis conviction under Count V in detail.\n\n\nMultiple Acts, Count I—Aggravated Kidnapping\n\n       Robinson argues the State relied on multiple acts to prove its aggravated\nkidnapping charge in Count I, and therefore, the district judge's failure to force the State\nto elect one act or to give a special unanimity instruction constituted clear error.\n\n\n       1.

Did the State present a multiple acts case?\n\n       In Count I, the State alleged Robinson took Trouten but did not specify the precise\nact that constituted the taking. At trial, the State presented evidence and made argument\nin support of two possible \"takings\": (1) Robinson lured Trouten from Michigan to\nKansas with false representations of employment and travel; and (2) Robinson took\nTrouten to his rural Linn County property with representations of fulfilling her sexual\nfantasy. Robinson contends that the two takings constitute multiple acts, and therefore,\nthe district judge should have compelled the State to elect a single theory of taking to\n\n\n                                             296\n\fsubmit to the jury or provided the jury with a special unanimity instruction requiring\njurors to agree unanimously on the criminal act constituting the taking.\n\n\n       Here, the two separate theories of Trouten's taking could support but one\nconviction for aggravated kidnapping. As the State points out in its brief, a crime is\ncompleted when every element of the offense has occurred. See Cox v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1232575\"><a href=\"/opinion/1232575/cox-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">395</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1232575\"><a href=\"/opinion/1232575/cox-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966) (the crime of kidnapping in the second degree is complete\nwhen without lawful authority a person is forcibly seized with intent to secretly confine\nthe person in this state against his or her will); K.S.A. 21-3106(6) (crime committed\nwhen every element occurs). The actual infliction of bodily injury is one of the essential\nelements of aggravated kidnapping. K.S.A. 21-3421. The State's evidence established that\nRobinson inflicted nonconsensual bodily injury only once—at the time of Trouten's\nmurder. Any bodily injury Trouten may have sustained through consensual BDS&M sex\ncould not, as a matter of law, support the bodily injury element of the aggravated\nkidnapping statute. See State v.

Accordingly, the trial court did not err in failing to force\nthe State to elect one theory or, alternatively, in failing to provide a special unanimity\ninstruction to the jury. See State v.

In the process,\nhe commented, \"And one must wonder, did that poor, fat, disabled Debbie Faith, did she\nwatch her mom get killed?\"\n\n\n       Defense counsel objected, claiming the comment invited speculation from jurors.\nJudge Anderson did not clearly rule on the objection. Instead, he commented that \"I\nunderstand [the prosecutors] have a certain degree of latitude here. On the other hand, it's\nprobably not a good thing for us to get too speculative.\" The defense requested a curative\ninstruction, but the district judge felt it would draw the jury's attention to the remark.\nRobinson believes the comment was improper and prejudicial to his due process rights.\n\n\n       Under the controlling framework, we first consider whether the remark fell beyond\nthe wide latitude afforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence.

Likewise, \"[i]t is improper for the prosecutor to create an 'imaginary\nscript' in order to create and arouse the prejudice and passion of the sentencing jury.\"\nKleypas, 272 Kan. at 1113.\n\n\n       The evidence relevant to the prosecutor's comment established that Debbie Faith\nwas a disabled minor who depended on her mother, Sheila Faith, as her primary\ncaregiver. They left Colorado together to visit Robinson and were never seen alive again.\nTheir bodies were found in two metal drums at Robinson's Raymore, Missouri, storage\nunit. The coroner testified both were killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. He could\nnot determine if the blows rendered them immediately unconscious. Nor could he provide\na precise date of death but said the decomposition was consistent with the State's theory\nthat they had been murdered 6 years earlier.\n\n\n       The State offered no direct evidence that Debbie Faith witnessed her mother's\nmurder. Nor did the circumstantial evidence reasonably give rise to such an inference.\nThe State did not prove which victim Robinson killed first or, for that matter, whether\nthey were killed at the same time or location. It is speculative to presume from the record\nthat Debbie Faith saw Robinson kill her mother. The form of the prosecutor's rhetorical\nquestion, \"One must wonder . . . ,\" did just that and invited jurors to speculate about\nevents unsupported by the evidence. As such, the comment exceeded the wide latitude\nafforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence. See State v. Flournoy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621795\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621795/state-v-flournoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n796-97, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621795\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621795/state-v-flournoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001) (comment speculating about victim's final thoughts\nimproper).\n                                            300\n\f       The State attempts to distinguish Flournoy, arguing the prosecutor's comments\nthere were unsupported and concerned the victim's possible last thoughts rather than the\nevents she may have witnessed. The distinction is one without a legal difference. In both\ninstances, the State's evidence, and reasonable inferences from it, failed to support the\nevents or scenario the prosecutor painted for the jury during closing argument.\n\n\n       Having determined the comment was beyond the scope of the evidence, we next\ndecide whether Robinson suffered prejudice as a result. See State v. Maestas, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">765</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">316</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014). In doing so, we consider: \"(1) whether the misconduct\nwas gross and flagrant; (2) whether the misconduct showed ill will on the prosecutor's\npart; and (3) whether the evidence was of such a direct and overwhelming nature that the\nmisconduct would likely have had little weight in the minds of jurors.\" 298 Kan. at 774.\n\n\n       After careful consideration of these factors, we hold that the prosecutor's comment\nwas not prejudicial to Robinson's right to a fair trial. Prosecutor Morrison's isolated, stray\nremark was not gross and flagrant. See State v. Adams, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 68-69, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2453508\"><a href=\"/opinion/2453508/state-v-adams/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2011) (comments not gross or flagrant when \"the prosecutor only made a passing\nreference to the victim and did not dwell on or repeat the point\"); State v.

After Robinson's objection,\nthe prosecutor moved on to other issues at the district judge's urging and made no further\nreference to the subject. Cf. State v. McHenry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2549265\"><a href=\"/opinion/2549265/state-v-mchenry/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2549030\"><a href=\"/opinion/2549030/ferguson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">78</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">3 (2003) (ill\nwill exists where prosecutor expressed indifference to court's rulings, mocked the\ndefendant, or engaged in repeated acts of misconduct), disapproved on other grounds by\n\n\n                                             301\n\fState v.

The prosecutor did not argue Debbie Faith definitively witnessed her mother's\nmurder. Because the form of the rhetorical question was equivocal, the potential impact\non jurors was diminished. Moreover, this isolated remark was likely to have far less\nimpact than the State's overwhelming and compelling evidence establishing that\nRobinson violently murdered this young, disabled teenager and her mother and, for years\nthereafter, reaped the financial benefits of his horrific acts by stealing their Social\nSecurity benefit payments. See Miller, 284 Kan. at 721 (prosecutor's improper comment\nheld little weight in light of the overwhelming evidence against defendant).\n\n\n       We find this isolated comment, uttered amongst thousands of pages of transcript,\nwas not prejudicial to Robinson's right to a fair trial.\n\n\n       2. Did the prosecutor's remark about ripping Lisa Stasi's baby from her arms\n       constitute prejudicial misconduct?\n\n       During the rebuttal portion of the State's closing argument, the prosecutor\nresponded to Robinson's argument challenging the State's evidence that Robinson\nmurdered Stasi. As the prosecutor discussed the timeline of events, he commented, \"We\nknow that there [Robinson] is grinning like a Cheshire cat, within hours of Lisa Stasi\nhaving that baby ripped from her arms.\"\n\n\n       The district judge sustained Robinson's objection, instructed the jury to disregard\nthe comment, and admonished the prosecutor not to comment on matters not in evidence.\nThe prosecutor then clarified his argument, explaining to the jury:\n\n                                              302\n\f               \"Would a young mother. . . willingly give up her baby, willingly give her baby\n       away to a stranger? I think we all know the answer to that question; don't we? I think we\n       all know that she wouldn't just walk away from her baby. I think we all know what\n       happened to Lisa Stasi for her baby.\"\n\n\nDefendant did not object to the prosecutor's argument as clarified.\n\n\n       Robinson contends the prosecutor's suggestion that baby Tiffany was \"ripped\"\nfrom Stasi's arms was beyond the scope of the evidence. The record established that Stasi\nwas hysterical and crying when she called her mother-in-law on the afternoon of her\ndisappearance, explaining somebody was trying to have her sign papers and take baby\nTiffany from her. The evidence showed that Robinson later returned to his home with a\nbaby named Tiffany and gave the child to his younger brother in furtherance of what\nturned out to be his adoption ruse.\n\n\n       The evidence did not establish that Robinson actually \"ripped\" baby Tiffany from\nLisa Stasi's arms. Nor could one reasonably make such an inference from the evidence.\nThe record simply contains no evidence describing how it came to pass that Robinson\nobtained physical control over baby Tiffany. We agree with Judge Anderson that the\ncomment exceeded the scope of the evidence.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, it did not prejudice Robinson's right to a fair trial. The lone, isolated\nremark was not gross and flagrant. Though technically improper, the remark did not land\nfar beyond the wide latitude afforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence because\nStasi's emotional response to the situation suggested she was unwilling to part ways with\nher baby voluntarily. See State v. Naputi, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">55</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 65, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2465563\"><a href=\"/opinion/2465563/state-v-naputi/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011) (misuse of\nthe word \"corroborate\" was not gross and flagrant misconduct or the product of ill will).\n\n\n\n                                                  303\n\f       Nor was the comment motivated by ill will. After the ruling, the prosecutor\nimmediately explained that the State's argument was that Stasi would not have\nvoluntarily relinquished her parental rights—an inference reasonably supported by the\nevidence. Prosecutors made no further remark on the subject inconsistent with the district\njudge's ruling. Cf. McHenry, 276 Kan. at 525 (noting that ill will has been found in cases\nwhere the prosecutor expressed indifference to a court's rulings or engaged in repeated\nacts of misconduct).\n\n\n       Finally, the comment would have supported little weight in the minds of jurors.\nThe isolated comment paled in comparison to the State's overwhelming evidence\nestablishing that Robinson created a sham charitable outreach program claiming to offer\nassistance to young, vulnerable women with newborn babies; he recruited young,\nCaucasian mothers without strong family connections to participate; he enticed Stasi into\nthis program, and thereafter, murdered her and delivered her baby to his brother as part of\na fraudulent private adoption scheme.

Did the prosecutor's comments on matters not in evidence constitute prejudicial\n       misconduct?\n\n       During the rebuttal portion of closing argument, while discussing evidence\nestablishing that Robinson murdered Stasi, Morrison argued:\n\n\n       \"You know what, he knew her car sat in front of Kathy Klingensmith's house and he\n       thought, How am I going to explain that? What would Lisa say about that? So there's a\n       part in the letter about it. He wrote to Marty, her brother, told him to let the bank take the\n       car back. The payments are so far behind. She wants the money or the car. I don't have\n       the money to pay the bank all the back payments. The car needs lots of work. A whole\n       paragraph and a half trying to explain why she would leave her car there. Why, that car\n       sat there day after day, week after week collecting dust. Why would she leave her car\n       there? Because she's dead, because she's dead.\"\n\n\nThe comments drew no objection from the defense.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by discussing\nthe letter sent to Stasi's brother, Marty Elledge, because it was not admitted into evidence.\nThe State agrees the comments were improper but argues they were not prejudicial.\n\n\n       Indeed, in discussing the letter sent to Elledge, the prosecutor improperly\nreferenced a document that was not admitted into evidence. See State v. Peppers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 394, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2499407\"><a href=\"/opinion/2499407/state-v-peppers/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">148</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012) (prosecutors free to make argument, provided it is\nsupported by admitted evidence).\n\n\n       Even so, we find no prejudice. The prosecutor's comments were not gross or\nflagrant or motivated by ill will. He mentioned the letter on only one occasion, drawing\nno objection from the defense. See King, 288 Kan. at 349 (while not required to preserve\nissue on appeal, lack of objection can be relevant to prejudice analysis); Miller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span>\n                                                    <span class=\"page\">305</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\fat 720 (lack of objection relevant to whether comments motivated by ill will). The\ncircumstances suggest the comment, or the failure to introduce the letter, resulted from a\nmere oversight by the prosecutor. The State admitted numerous letters that Robinson,\nposing as the victim, sent to the victims' families, including a letter to Stasi's mother-in-\nlaw. The State also admitted a photocopy of an envelope with an affixed postage stamp\naddressed to Stasi's brother, seized during the search of Robinson's Olathe residence.\nBefore referencing the letter, the prosecutor reminded jurors that all of these letters were\nin evidence, and he asked them to review this evidence during deliberations.\n\n\n       Robinson believes the prosecutor should have known the letter was not in\nevidence because Judge Anderson had previously sustained defendant's hearsay objection\nafter Stasi's aunt, Karen Moore, tried to testify to its contents. However, this objection\nwas founded on Moore's attempt to testify to the contents of the letter, not to its\nadmission of the letter itself. Also, the ruling was made 10 days before closing argument,\nin the midst of an extremely complex, multiweek criminal trial. It is unlikely this\nparticular ruling was fresh in the prosecutor's mind during the rebuttal portion of closing\nargument.\n\n\n       Finally, the comments would have supported little weight in the minds of jurors.\nMorrison made reference to this letter, among other evidence, to rebut the defense's\nclosing argument that the evidence failed to establish that Stasi was dead or that she had\nfallen victim to Robinson's foul play. However, the State put on substantial evidence,\nindependent of this letter, establishing the fact of Stasi's murder and Robinson's\nconnection to it. Morrison's comments on the content of the letter to Elledge did little, if\nanything, to bolster this evidence. Moreover, the trial court instructed jurors to disregard\nany testimony or exhibit not admitted and that counsels' remarks were not evidence,\nfurther mitigating any risk of prejudice.\n\n\n                                             306\n\f        Based on the foregoing, we find the isolated remarks did not prejudice Robinson's\nright to a fair trial.\n\n\nComments with Potential Impact on Defendant's Constitutional Rights\n\n        Robinson also contends that the prosecutor committed misconduct by making\ncomments that undermined his substantial rights. Specifically, he claims the prosecutor\nimproperly: (1) commented on Robinson's silence; (2) shifted the burden of proof to the\ndefense; (3) appealed to community interests; and (4) undermined the presumption of\ninnocence during voir dire.\n\n\n        1.

In discussing these elements, Morrison said, \"Finally, concealment, the barrels\nhidden away or isolated. Of course, in Lisa Stasi's case a body not found. That's the\nultimate concealment; isn't it?

We disagree. The remarks were consistent with and\nwithin the scope of the evidence, which was sufficient to establish that Robinson\nmurdered Stasi and five other women and that law enforcement officers conducted an\nextensive investigation that led to the discovery of all the victims' bodies, other than\nStasi's. From this evidence, one could reasonably infer that Robinson had disposed of\nStasi's body in a manner that prevented law enforcement from discovering the corpus\ndelicti. Considering the record and argument in its totality, the prosecutor was addressing\nlaw enforcement's inability to find Stasi's body—not Robinson's failure to take the stand\nor to otherwise inform law enforcement of the body's location—as the \"ultimate\nconcealment.\" Jurors would not have necessarily and naturally understood Morrison's\nremark as a comment on Robinson's postarrest silence, and, therefore, it was not\nimproper.

Did the prosecutor improperly shift the burden of proof?\n\n         During closing, the defense argued Robinson did not act alone, in hopes of\ncreating reasonable doubt or, perhaps more likely, residual doubt for the penalty phase.\nTo support the theory, counsel argued that the metal drums holding the bodies were too\nheavy for Robinson to move alone and that the unidentified fingerprint on the roll of duct\ntape stained with Lewicka's blood suggested others were involved.\n\n\n         At the outset of rebuttal, the prosecutor told jurors he would address these specific\nissues, but first he wanted to remind them of the strength of the evidence of Robinson's\nguilt:\n\n                                              308\n\f               \"Before we spend a lot of time talking about whether or not there's a fingerprint\n       on duct tape or why Izabela Lewicka didn't send letters, before we get caught up in those\n       things, let's just remember one thing. Let's think about how intertwined the defendant's\n       conduct with all these women was. And let's not forget the fact that these barrels with\n       their bodies are on his farm. Think about that. Mr. O'Brien wants us all to think, gosh,\n       this is a circumstantial case, look at all these questions here, questions here, questions\n       there over 17 years, that's the best he can come up with.

The comment was clearly intended to remind the jury not to lose\nsight of the overwhelming evidence of Robinson's guilt when evaluating the defendant's\nreasonable doubt arguments. Moreover, the district judge properly instructed the jurors\non the burden of proof. Viewing the remark in context, we find it to be within the wide\nlatitude afforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence. See State v.

When viewing the remarks together in context, we found the\nimproper motive and effect of the comment was apparent. 278 Kan. at 92.\n\n\n       In stark contrast, Morrison made the comment at issue here in the context of\nrehabilitating the State's evidence. He was responding directly to the challenges the\ndefense had lodged to the State's theory during closing. In this context, \"the best they can\ncome up with\" remark was not an attempt to shift the burden of proof. Tosh is\ndistinguishable, and the remark was not improper under these facts.

I hope you do.

During the second\nphase of jury selection, Judge Anderson assigned veniremembers to small group panels\nfor questioning on bias related to pretrial publicity and the death penalty. While\nquestioning one of the small group panels, the prosecutor told Juror 342:\n\n\n               \"Obviously, if somebody comes in with a notion then they know the whole story\n       or they think that somebody is guilty, they think that somebody is not guilty, if they do\n       have some of that baggage, they need to be able to set it aside.\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\nDefense counsel objected, explaining the presumption of innocence allows jurors to\nbelieve defendant is not guilty unless or until proven otherwise. Morrison immediately\nresponded, \"I didn't mean it in that context.\" Judge Anderson sustained the objection and\ninstructed the panelists to disregard the statement.\n\n\n       Notwithstanding the district judge's ruling, Robinson argues, the prosecutor\ncontinued to make the same comments. First, Robinson highlights the prosecutor's\nremarks to the twenty-second small group panel on September 25, 2002:\n\n\n               \"Okay. And does everybody here understand that's really kind of why we're\n       asking these questions, because the law . . . doesn't expect everybody to, you know, have\n       a totally blank mind and not to have ever heard anything about a case. That's not really\n       the issue.\n\n                                                   312\n\f               \"What the issue is, if you're going to be a juror on this case, jurors have got to be\n       able to set that aside.

The comment was made in the context of discussing\npretrial publicity, not the appropriate burden of proof at trial. Moreover, the prosecutor\nimmediately clarified that he had not intended for his remarks to be construed as a\nstatement on the presumption of innocence. Judge Anderson also provided a curative\ninstruction to the panelists, none of whom served on Robinson's jury.\n\n\n       Likewise, neither of the later comments is objectionable or inconsistent with Judge\nAnderson's prior ruling.

Was the prosecutor's hypothetical that assumed the State did a \"bad job\"\n               presenting the case improper?\n\n       At various times during small group voir dire, some panelists expressed\nuncertainty as to their ability to set aside pretrial publicity. In these situations, the\nprosecutor occasionally presented the panelists with a hypothetical question to the effect\nthat \"assuming the prosecution did a horrible or bad job presenting the case and you had\nserious doubts that the State had met its burden, how would you vote, or would you vote\nto acquit?\" In doing so, Robinson believes the prosecutor implied that acquittal would be\nproper only if the prosecutors did a horrible job presenting the case.\n\n\n       Contrary to Robinson's assertion, Morrison's use of this hypothetical question did\nnot improperly shift the burden of proof or undermine the presumption of innocence. The\nprosecutor phrased the question as a hypothetical scenario for the purpose of establishing\npanelists' willingness and ability to set aside media facts and opinions formed as a result\nof exposure to them. The question was particularly appropriate, given that the entire\npurpose of small group voir dire during the second phase of jury selection was to explore\npotential bias created by exposure to pretrial publicity and panelists' death penalty views.\nThroughout the voir dire process, the prosecutor emphasized the applicable evidentiary\nburdens and legal presumptions to veniremembers.

First, it is unsupported by the\nrecord. At the outset of trial, during opening statements, the prosecutor told jurors that the\nevidence would demonstrate that Robinson employed a common scheme or course of\nconduct that included elaborate scams to exploit victims financially or sexually, kill them,\nand conceal their deaths. During its case-in-chief, the State put on evidence supporting\nthe inference that Robinson's killings were linked together by common elements,\nincluding: luring victims with promises of financial benefit or travel, exploitation of the\nvictims financially or sexually, similar methods of killing and disposal or concealment of\nthe bodies, and acts of deceit and fraud to hide all of these crimes. During the first portion\nof the State's closing argument, prosecutor Morrison claimed that Robinson was the\ncommon thread that ran through the similar characteristics of all the murders, including\n\n\n                                             315\n\fthe bogus cover stories used to lure victims, the similar manner of killings, and the\nvarious efforts taken to conceal the deaths.\n\n\n       Additionally, the defense opened the door to the State's rebuttal argument.\nRobinson devoted a substantial portion of his closing to challenging the sufficiency of the\nevidence supporting the existence of a common scheme or course of conduct. The\nprosecutor's challenged remarks were proper rebuttal to Robinson's closing argument.\nUnited States v. Sharp, 400 Fed. Appx. 741, 750-51 (4th Cir. 2010) (unpublished\nopinion) (prosecutor did not commit misconduct by referring to altered records during\nrebuttal argument where it replied to theory raised in defendant's closing argument); State\nv.

In particular,\nthe prosecutor made comments beyond the scope of the evidence when he: (1)\nspeculated whether Debbie Faith witnessed her mother's murder; (2) suggested baby\nTiffany was ripped from Lisa Stasi's arms; and (3) discussed the contents of a letter sent\nto Lisa Stasi's brother.

INSTRUCTIONAL ERROR—GUILT PHASE\n\n       Robinson lodges three challenges to the district judge's guilt phase instructions. In\nparticular, he argues the capital murder elements instructions were deficient in failing to\ndefine \"common scheme or course of conduct.\" Similarly, he contends the lack of such a\ndefinition rendered those terms unconstitutionally vague. Finally, he complains the venue\ninstruction was incomplete and confusing.\n\n\nFailure to Define \"Common Scheme\" or \"Course of Conduct\" in Instructions\n\n       The district judge provided a separate elements instruction for each capital murder\ncount, Counts II and III of the Fourth Amended Complaint. The instructions were\nidentical except for the name of the primary victim, Trouten or Lewicka, and the relevant\ndates of the offense. Each instruction informed the jury that, as one of the elements of the\noffense, the State had to prove the killing of Trouten or Lewicka, along with the killings\nof Bonner, Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith, and Stasi, \"were multiple acts or transactions\nconstituting parts of a common scheme or a course of conduct.\"\n\n\n       Robinson requested that the trial judge include the following definitions of\n\"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\" for the jury:\n\n               \"A common scheme exists between multiple acts if such acts are closely\n       connected in time, place, occasion, and the nature of the activity.\n\n                                                   317\n\f               \"A course of conduct is a pattern of conduct composed of a series of acts over a\n       period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose.\"\n\n\n       Judge Anderson declined, finding the terms were not particularly difficult for a lay\nperson to resolve. Robinson now contends the failure to define the terms was erroneous.\n\n\n       1. Standard of Review\n\n               \"For jury instruction issues, the progression of analysis and corresponding\n       standards of review on appeal are: (1) First, the appellate court should consider the\n       reviewability of the issue from both jurisdiction and preservation viewpoints, exercising\n       an unlimited standard of review; (2) next, the court should use an unlimited review to\n       determine whether the instruction was legally appropriate; (3) then, the court should\n       determine whether there was sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to\n       the defendant or the requesting party, that would have supported the instruction; and (4)\n       finally, if the district court erred, the appellate court must determine whether the error\n       was harmless, utilizing the test and degree of certainty set forth in State v.

The problem with this approach is that the meaning of the\nindividual words is not at issue. Rather, the issue is whether the phrases \"common\nscheme\" and \"course of conduct\" are easily understood by lay jurors. The phrases use\nwords in combination, not isolated definitions in combination, and, consequently, in\n\n                                                  319\n\fcommon usage are more precise than the sum of their parts.

He reviews various cases and statutes in which the\nphrases have been used and concludes that collectively they demonstrate no one meaning\ncan be identified. But this argument also ignores context and relies on an\nunacknowledged and incorrect premise that the jurors asked to construe the phrases in\nthis capital murder trial were aware of and confused by their use in other contexts.\nRobinson points to nothing in the record evidencing such confusion among Robinson's\njurors.\n\n\n          Neither the legislature nor the PIK Committee recommended a definition for\n\"common scheme\" or \"course of conduct\" in K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6), implying both\nbelieved the phrases were easily understood. Consistent with this view, other state courts\nhave held that these or similar phrases in their capital murder statutes required no further\ndefinition. Defendant's proposed instruction defining \"common scheme\" and \"course of\nconduct\" was not legally appropriate, and we hold there was no error.\n\n\n\n\n                                              320\n\f\"Common Scheme\" or \"Course of Conduct\" as Unconstitutionally Vague\n\n      In a similar vein, Robinson suggests Judge Anderson's failure to define the terms\n\"common scheme\" and \"course of conduct\" rendered the capital murder statute\nunconstitutionally vague, in violation of his due process and Eighth Amendment rights.\n\n\n      1.

To assist jurors on the venue issue, the\ndistrict judge gave the following instruction:\n\n\n                                    \"INSTRUCTION NO. 11\n               \"If you find that the defendant committed criminal acts in one county which were\n       a substantial and integral part of an overall continuing crime plan, and which were in\n       partial execution of that plan, the prosecution may be in any county in which any of such\n       acts occur.\"\n\n\n       Robinson neither objected to the venue instruction nor offered an alternative.

Being tried in the proper venue is a right granted by the Kansas Constitution Bill\nof Rights, § 10. K.S.A. 22-2602 states that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law, the\nprosecution shall be in the county where the crime was committed.\"\n\n\n       However, in some instances, it may not be apparent where a crime was committed.\nThe legislature has developed a number of rules to address more complicated venue\nquestions. Relevant to this case is K.S.A. 22-2603, which provides \"[w]here two or more\nacts are requisite to the commission of any crime and such acts occur in different counties\nthe prosecution may be in any county in which any of such acts occur,\" and K.S.A. 22-\n2611, which provides that \"[i]f the cause of death is inflicted in one county and the death\nensues in another county, the prosecution may be in either of such counties. Death shall\nbe presumed to have occurred in the county where the body of the victim is found.\"\n\n\n       The district judge's venue instruction failed to incorporate either statutory\nprovision. Instruction No. 11 is similar to the language of K.S.A. 22-2603, but there are\nsignificant differences. The statute requires two or more acts that are \"requisite to the\ncommission\" of the crime. The instruction, on the other hand, focuses on acts that are a\n\"substantial and integral part of an overall continuing crime plan.\" Instruction No. 11\n\n\n                                                   327\n\fdoes not focus on a crime, which is problematic because the instruction is intended to\nassist jurors in deciding where the crimes occurred.\n\n\n       Furthermore, Instruction No. 11 failed to include the statutory presumption under\nK.S.A. 22-2611 altogether. The failure to do so is particularly troubling given that the\nprosecution occurred in Johnson County, but the bodies of Trouten and Lewicka were\nfound in Linn County. See Hunt, 285 Kan. at 859-60 (State had burden to prove venue\nproper; jury should have been instructed that it must find murder occurred in venue of\nprosecution and further instructed that death presumed to occur in county where victim's\nbody found under K.S.A. 22-2611).\n\n\n       Instruction No. 11 was modeled after language from State v. Grissom, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1450094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1450094/state-v-grissom/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 889, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1450094\"><a href=\"/opinion/1450094/state-v-grissom/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), where we held that the Johnson County District Court\nhad territorial jurisdiction to prosecute defendant because \"[t]here [wa]s evidence from\nwhich a jury could find that Grissom committed criminal acts in Kansas which were a\nsubstantial and integral part of an overall continuing crime plan and which were in partial\nexecution of the plan.\" 251 Kan. at 889. The district judge's reliance on this language was\nmisplaced. Grissom was a territorial jurisdiction case, not a venue case. 251 Kan. at 889-\n90 (Kansas court has jurisdiction over murder prosecution involving victims who had\ndisappeared after last being seen in Missouri). Moreover, the statutory venue rules,\nparticularly K.S.A. 22-2611, were not helpful in Grissom because the victims' bodies\nwere never found. Here, territorial jurisdiction was not an issue, and K.S.A. 22-2603 and\n22-2611 were directly applicable to the evidence developed at trial.\n\n\n       Finally, we believe the language in Instruction No. 11 concerning where \"the\nprosecution may be\" must have been confusing to the jury. Nowhere else in the\ninstructions does it matter where the prosecution may be, and it is reasonable to believe\nthat a juror would conclude that issue had long since been decided. Cf. State v.

To the contrary, as it relates to Count III, the capital murder\nof Lewicka, the State presented compelling forensic and circumstantial evidence that\nRobinson killed Lewicka in her Johnson County apartment.\n\n\n       Robinson leased an apartment for Lewicka at 901A Edgebrook in Olathe. Lewicka\nwas residing at this location at the time of her disappearance around fall 1999. In\nSeptember 1999, Robinson delivered a check for that month's rent to the property\nmanager, Julie Brown, and informed her that he had vacated the apartment even though\nseveral months remained on the term of the lease. Brown later conducted a \"check-out\"\n\n                                            329\n\finspection of Lewicka's apartment and noticed she had left behind a fish tank,\nmicrowave, and table. A substantial portion of the dwelling was unkempt, but the two\nbedrooms had been cleaned meticulously.\n\n\n         On October 12, 2000, law enforcement officers searched Lewicka's apartment for\ntrace evidence. In the southwest bedroom, one of the rooms that had been cleaned\nmeticulously, the officers found hundreds of small reddish-brown spots on the south wall\nthat tested presumptively positive for blood. Subsequent testing confirmed the blood\nmatched Lewicka's DNA.\n\n\n         When law enforcement officers discovered Lewicka's body inside a metal drum at\nRobinson's Linn County property, she was partially clothed in a nightshirt. Law\nenforcement officers also recovered a pillow and pillowcase from inside the barrel that\nmatched the pattern of Lewicka's bedsheets, which Robinson had since given to his\nparamour, Barbara Sandre. This circumstantial evidence lent further support to the State's\ntheory that Robinson had killed Lewicka as she slept or lay in her bed at the Olathe\napartment.\n\n         Other than her body, there was little evidence connecting Lewicka's murder to\nLinn County. There was a small bloodstain on a roll of duct tape recovered from\nRobinson's Linn County trailer that matched Lewicka's DNA. Law enforcement officers\nalso found several strips of duct tape inside the barrel containing Lewicka's body.\nHowever, this evidence also was consistent with the State's theory that Robinson killed\nLewicka in Johnson County and transported her body to Linn County to conceal the\ncrime.\n\n\n         With regard to Count II, the capital murder of Trouten, Robinson is correct that the\nforensic evidence did not clearly establish the location of Trouten's murder. In fact,\n\n                                             330\n\fduring closing argument, the State argued that Robinson \"perhaps\" killed Trouten inside\nher room at the Guesthouse Suites in Lenexa or inside the trailer at his Linn County\nproperty but admitted the theories were speculative. If anything, the State's forensic\nevidence presented a more convincing case that Robinson killed Trouten inside his Linn\nCounty trailer because of the trace evidence identified at this location, including blood\nsamples and a hair root matching Trouten's DNA.\n\n\n       Robinson's argument in support of clear error focuses on the forensic evidence\nsuggesting a greater probability that Robinson killed Trouten in Linn County than in\nJohnson County. Robinson's argument presumes incorrectly that the location of the\nmurder alone is determinative of the venue question. However, K.S.A. 22-2603 provides\nthat \"where two or more acts are requisite to the commission of any crime and such acts\noccur in different counties the prosecution may be in any county in which any of such\nacts occur.\" The existence of a common scheme or course of conduct connecting the\nmurders is one of the acts requisite to the commission of capital murder under K.S.A. 21-\n3439(a)(6) as charged in Counts II and III. To the extent Robinson engaged in conduct\nwithin Johnson County that established or furthered the alleged common scheme or\ncourse of conduct, such evidence not only satisfies an element of the offense but also\nestablishes Johnson County as an appropriate venue.\n\n\n       At trial, the State presented evidence that Robinson employed a common scheme\nor course of conduct characterized by luring women to Johnson County, exploiting them\nfinancially or sexually, killing them and disposing of their bodies in a similar fashion, and\nengaging in fraud and deceit to conceal the murders. Given that Robinson resided in and\nran his businesses out of Johnson County, it is not surprising that the State's evidence\noverwhelmingly demonstrated that he carried out this common scheme or course of\nconduct almost exclusively within Johnson County. For example, Robinson lured Trouten\nfrom Michigan to Johnson County with offers of employment, travel, and other benefits.\n                                            331\n\fTo facilitate such luring, Robinson paid for Trouten to stay at the Guesthouse Suites in\nLenexa; paid for a moving truck to transport Trouten's belongings from Michigan to\nJohnson County; and, after her arrival, stored Trouten's belongings in his Olathe storage\nunit and boarded her two dogs at an Olathe animal clinic.\n\n\n       Robinson also employed fraud and deceit to conceal Trouten's murder as part of\nhis common scheme and course of conduct. To facilitate the cover-up, Robinson disposed\nof Trouten's two dogs by reporting them to an Olathe animal control officer; moved\nTrouten's belongings out of her Lenexa hotel room; and made arrangements with a\nresident of Mexico, while she was visiting her son in Johnson County, to mail fraudulent\nletters to Trouten's family members postmarked from Mexico.\n\n\n       Moreover, as to the other victims identified in the capital counts, Robinson carried\nout a substantial portion of his common scheme or course of conduct in Johnson County.\nFor example, in luring Stasi, Robinson held himself out as a successful Johnson County\nbusinessman who had established a program to provide assistance to young women with\nbabies. To successfully lure Stasi, he paid for her to stay at the Roadway Inn in Overland\nPark. To conceal her disappearance, Robinson fabricated an alibi and paid a third party to\nprovide a false statement to Overland Park police consistent with it. At the same time,\nwhile residing in Johnson County, Robinson employed an adoption ruse to conceal the\ndisappearance of Stasi's baby. To complete the scheme, Robinson had his brother execute\nfraudulent adoption paperwork at Robinson's Johnson County business office and pick up\nthe baby at Robinson's home in Stanley.\n\n\n       Robinson also engaged in a variety of conduct within Johnson County to lure and\nthen exploit Sheila and Debbie Faith financially. The State's evidence demonstrated\nRobinson killed both victims to steal their Social Security benefit payments. To do so,\n\n\n                                            332\n\fRobinson set up a private mailbox under their names in Olathe and submitted a change of\naddress form to the SSA directing benefit checks to this Johnson County address.\n\n\n       Robinson's common scheme and course of conduct also included the financial\nexploitation of Beverly Bonner and, later, the use of deceit to conceal her murder. As\nwith the Faiths, Robinson set up a private mailbox in Olathe under Bonner's name.\nBonner's alimony checks were mailed to this Olathe mailbox, and Robinson deposited\nthem into joint bank accounts set up under his and Bonner's names. Robinson also used\nthis mailbox to facilitate his fraudulent letter writing campaign aimed at Bonner's family.\n\n\n       The State presented persuasive forensic and circumstantial evidence that Robinson\nkilled Lewicka at her apartment in Johnson County. Furthermore, the State presented\noverwhelming evidence that Robinson carried out a substantial portion of the common\nscheme and course of conduct common to all six murders within Johnson County, where\nhe lived and conducted business. Based on this evidence, Robinson has failed to firmly\nconvince us that the verdict would have changed but for the instructional error. As such,\nthe district judge's erroneous venue instruction does not constitute clear error.\n\n\n                            12. CUMULATIVE ERROR—GUILT PHASE\n\n       Robinson argues that the cumulative effect of the pretrial and guilt phase errors\nrequire the court to reverse all of his convictions.\n\n\nLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       \"Cumulative error, considered collectively, may be so great as to require reversal of a\n       defendant's conviction. The test is whether the totality of the circumstances substantially\n       prejudiced the defendant and denied him or her a fair trial.

The results speak for\nthemselves. In a highly complex, capital trial that continued for weeks on end, we have\ndetected only three errors.\n\n\n       Robinson's two capital murder convictions, Counts II and III, were multiplicitous\nwith each other, and his conviction for first-degree murder, Count V, was multiplicitous\nwith the capital convictions. However, this had no effect on jurors, and our reversal of the\nsecond capital conviction and the first-degree murder conviction cures any prejudice. We\nalso have ruled that the prosecutor made three isolated remarks that exceeded the scope\nof the evidence. Yet, the cumulative impact of the remarks was not prejudicial. Finally,\nthe trial court's venue instruction was erroneous, but the overwhelming nature of the\nState's evidence established convincingly that this error did not affect the outcome of the\nproceedings.\n\n\n       When considered together, the errors are negligible in comparison to the nature of\nthese proceedings and the enormous weight of the evidence against Robinson.\n\n\n                                                   334\n\fConsidering the totality of the circumstances, we find the cumulative effect of the errors\ndid not substantially prejudice Robinson or deny him the right to a fair trial.\n\n\n               FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND—PENALTY PHASE\n\n\nThe State's Case\n\n       In the penalty phase, the State alleged the existence of one aggravating\ncircumstance: \"That the defendant knowingly or purposely killed more than one person.\"\nThe State asked the jury to consider all the guilt phase evidence presented during its case-\nin-chief relevant to this aggravator in deciding the sentence.\n\n\nThe Defendant's Case\n\n       Robinson alleged the existence of several mitigating circumstances, including:\n\n\n                \"1. If not sentenced to death, the defendant will peacefully spend the rest of his\n       life in prison.\n                \"2. The defendant is likely to make a satisfactory adjustment to prison life.\n                \"3. If the defendant is not sentenced to death, a term of imprisonment is sufficient\n       to defend and protect the people's safety.\n                \"4. If the defendant receives a life sentence, he will be able to maintain a\n       relationship with his wife, children, grandchildren and other family members.\n                \"5. Defendant's family will suffer grief and loss if he is executed.\n                \"6. The degree to which, if any, others may have participated in the crimes and\n       share a degree of moral culpability or blame.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                                    335\n\f       1. Maintaining family relationships and familial grief\n\n       The defense called Nancy Robinson to testify in support of mitigating\ncircumstances 4 and 5, maintaining family relationships if sentenced to life and familial\ngrief if sentenced to death.\n\n\n       Nancy testified that she met Robinson in 1963 in Oak Park, Illinois. They married\nseveral months later and moved to the Kansas City area in late 1963 or early 1964.\nRobinson and Nancy had four children. Nancy said Robinson played an important role in\nthe lives of his children and actively participated in and attended their activities. Even\nwhen Robinson served time in state prison in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the children\nvisited him and their relationship remained strong. All of Robinson's children grew to be\nproductive and contributing members of their communities.\n\n\n       Robinson was also involved in the lives of his grandchildren. Robinson's youngest\ndaughter, Christy, had a daughter and younger son. Robinson was involved in the lives of\nboth of Christy's children and babysat them on a regular basis while their parents were at\nwork. Robinson shared a particularly close relationship with Christy's daughter, who\nspent time with Robinson every day. Robinson's arrest affected her the most because she\nviewed Robinson as a role model or idol. She became so upset that the family arranged\nspecial contact visits, with the approval of sheriff's department personnel, while Robinson\nwas in jail awaiting trial. Christy's daughter continued to talk to Robinson by phone\nduring trial.\n\n\n       Nancy testified that the prospect of Robinson's execution has had a devastating\nimpact on their entire family. If Robinson were sentenced to life imprisonment, Nancy\nsaid, the family would continue to maintain a relationship with him. Nancy, in particular,\nalways stood by Robinson. She testified on his behalf when he was convicted of fraud in\n\n                                             336\n\fJohnson County in 1986. She stayed with him after his theft conviction in Missouri and\nwhen he went back to prison after his probation was revoked. Despite Robinson's\nmultiple, ongoing extramarital affairs, Nancy stayed in the relationship. Even Robinson's\nconviction for capital murder did not break their marriage. Despite everything, Nancy\ntestified that she still shared a bond with Robinson and that it would continue if the jury\nspared his life.\n\n\n       2. Satisfactory adjustment to prison, community safety\n\n       The defense offered the testimony of expert witnesses Mark D. Cunningham and\nPaul Delo in support of mitigating circumstances 1 through 3 (peaceful prison existence,\nsatisfactory adjustment to prison life, and life imprisonment as sufficient to defend and\nprotect the public). The defense retained Cunningham, a clinical and forensic\npsychologist, to conduct a risk assessment of Robinson and render an opinion on his\nfuture dangerousness in prison. The defense retained Delo, a retired prison warden and\ncorrectional consultant, to assess Robinson's propensity for violence in prison.\n\n\n       Cunningham had testified as an expert on more than 150 occasions. He reviewed\ncorrectional records, information about the offenses of conviction, the presentence\nreports, and Robinson's criminal history and educational and medical records.\nCunningham also interviewed Robinson's family members and correctional officials who\nsupervised Robinson while in custody.\n\n\n       Cunningham compared the case-specific facts he gathered from these records with\nrisk assessment factors established in the field of forensic psychology and other statistical\ninformation on prison adjustment. Through this comparative analysis, Cunningham\nidentified four key factors, in decreasing order of significance, supporting his opinion that\nRobinson would experience a positive, nonviolent adjustment in the prison system,\n\n                                            337\n\fincluding: (1) his age; (2) his past behavioral history in custody; (3) correctional staff\nappraisals; and (4) contact with family and children.\n\n\n              a. Age of Offender\n\n\n       Robinson was born on December 27, 1943, and was 58 years old at the time of\ntrial. Cunningham identified studies showing a significant reduction in the risk of prison\nviolence among offenders who are age 45 years or older, referring to this phenomenon as\nthe \"aging effect.\" This aging effect is generally consistent with data among the general\npopulation that shows a decreasing tendency for violence with increased age.\nCunningham noted that research confirms this aging effect still holds true and applies\nequally to offenders who commit violent crimes at an advanced age, such as in\nRobinson's case. Delo corroborated this testimony, confirming that as an inmate ages, the\nrisk of violence decreases. He opined that an inmate's age is the most significant factor\ninfluencing propensity for violence.\n\n\n              b. Prior Behavioral History in Custody\n\n\n       Cunningham identified Robinson's past behavioral history in prison as the second\nrisk assessment factor relevant to his analysis. Cunningham and Delo testified that an\ninmate's conduct during prior incarcerations is often an indicator of future behavior.\n\n\n       Robinson served a 40-month term of imprisonment with Kansas Department of\nCorrections (KDOC) from 1987 to 1991. Thereafter, he was transferred to the Western\nMissouri Correctional Center for 22 months. Following his arrest in June 2000, Robinson\nwas detained at the Johnson County jail for 22 months awaiting trial. Cunningham found\nit particularly relevant that Robinson served all of his time in custody after murdering\n\n\n                                             338\n\fStasi because this showed he was already prone to violence before entering the prison\nsystem.\n\n\n       Robinson was not involved in any acts of serious violence during his 62-month\nstint in the state prison system or his 22-month stay in county jail. Cunningham found\nonly a few minor disciplinary infractions in Robinson's record. First, in the Johnson\nCounty jail, Robinson was written up for bringing a salt shaker back to his cell, which he\nused to create a saltwater rinse for his sore throat. Second, at KDOC, Robinson received a\nwritten infraction for using a typewriter to draft 17 grievances that he distributed to other\ninmates. Finally, in Missouri, he received a written infraction for failing to take his\nprescribed medication. Delo testified that an exemplary inmate will receive five or fewer\ndisciplinary infractions a year, making Robinson's record one of the best he had seen\nduring his time working within the Missouri prison system.\n\n\n       Instead of turning to violence, Cunningham found that Robinson used his time in\ncustody constructively and had a positive \"work adjustment\" in the prison setting.\nRobinson worked on an inmate building crew and performed a substantial amount of\ncomputer work for the benefit of the prison. Delo testified that Robinson also took\nadvantage of several educational and training opportunities.\n\n\n              c. Appraisal of Correctional Staff\n\n\n       Cunningham testified that correctional staff's assessment and appraisal of an\ninmate is a relevant factor in predicting his or her propensity for violence in prison.\n\n\n       Cunningham found that staff's appraisals of Robinson were favorable. Robinson\nbegan his term at KDOC in maximum security, but he was reduced to medium security\nwithin several months. Robinson began his pretrial confinement at the Johnson County\n                                             339\n\fDetention Center in a medium security setting but was later transferred to maximum\nsecurity when the State charged him with capital murder. Even so, officials at the\nJohnson County jail allowed Robinson's granddaughter to have contact visits with him,\nwhich suggested to Cunningham that their compassion for the young girl outweighed any\nconcern they had about Robinson's propensity for violence.\n\n\n       Cunningham interviewed two staff members at KDOC who had supervised\nRobinson, and both confirmed he was an exceptional worker. One of the staff members\nnoted that Robinson was particularly skilled in the field of computer technology and that\nprison officials had Robinson troubleshoot computer problems and develop software\nprograms used by the prison. However, both of these correctional officials told\nCunningham that Robinson fraudulently altered documents containing their signatures\nand used them to bolster his position before the parole board.\n\n\n              d. Relationship with Family\n\n\n       Cunningham identified an inmate's relationship with family as the final assessment\nfactor, explaining that inmates who are in routine contact with their families tend to have\nbetter prison adjustment and fewer disciplinary issues. Cunningham testified that during\nthe 22 months Robinson spent in pretrial detention, his wife, youngest daughter, and\ngranddaughter visited him with some regularity.\n\n\n              e. Other Risk Factors\n\n\n       Cunningham knew Robinson used computers and the Internet to perpetrate a\nnumber of his crimes of conviction. Nevertheless, he expressed little concern with\nRobinson's history of computer use in prison because he would be placed in a maximum\nsecurity setting, which he presumed would offer Robinson little to no opportunity to have\n                                            340\n\funsupervised access to the Internet. Cunningham also observed that Robinson's previous\ncomputer activity in prison was focused on software and troubleshooting, not Internet\nactivity. Cunningham admitted, however, that he did not speak to KDOC officials\nregarding their policy and did not know definitively whether Robinson would have\nInternet access in its facilities.\n\n\n       Cunningham also testified that the violent nature of Robinson's offenses did not\nincrease his propensity for violence in prison. Cunningham highlighted studies conducted\nby the United States Department of Justice that found that an inmate's conviction for\nviolent crime was not a reliable predictor of prison adjustment and did not correlate with\nhigher rates of prison violence. Cunningham also explained that Robinson had committed\nviolent crimes in the community before entering the prison system, yet he exhibited no\npropensity for violence while incarcerated.\n\n\n       Cunningham admitted that Robinson had a history of deception both inside and\noutside of the prison setting, and he predicted this behavior would continue. Delo also\nconfirmed that as an inmate ages, he may rely more on manipulation or deception in\norder to survive and thrive within the prison system. However, Cunningham believed\nRobinson's use of deceit inside prison was motivated primarily by his desire to secure an\nearlier release, and Robinson would have no such opportunity with his crimes of\nconviction.\n\n\n       Cunningham could not completely rule out the possibility that Robinson might use\ndeceit and manipulation to further a plan of escape, but he noted that Robinson had\nshown no propensity for flight and cited data illustrating the extraordinarily low\npercentage of successful escapes from maximum security prisons.\n\n\n\n\n                                              341\n\f       Cunningham also had no serious concerns about Robinson's history of\nmanipulating women inside prison, particularly Bonner. Cunningham explained that\nRobinson would be placed in a much higher security level, limiting his interaction with\nand access to prison staff. Also, Cunningham believed that Bonner knew Robinson only\nas a white collar criminal. In the future, it would be harder for Robinson to manipulate\nwomen behind bars because he is widely known for luring, deceiving, and killing\nmultiple women. However, Delo admitted that it is not uncommon for prison staff to\nform relationships with and fall victim to the manipulation of inmates within the system.\n\n\n       Based on his assessment of the key risk factors, Cunningham opined that\nRobinson would have a positive adjustment to prison free from violence. Delo offered a\nsimilar opinion.\n\n\n       3. Residual Doubt\n\n\n       In support of mitigating circumstance 6, Robinson argued that there was residual\ndoubt as to whether he acted alone, suggesting that his moral culpability should be\ndiminished by or shared with his cohorts. In closing argument, Robinson's counsel\nhighlighted evidence, including the weight of the barrels housing the bodies and the\nunidentified fingerprints found on the plastic sheeting inside his Raymore, Missouri,\nstorage locker and on the roll of duct tape stained with Lewicka's blood, as proof of\nothers' involvement.\n\n\n       4. Mercy\n\n       Finally, Robinson's counsel asked the jury to consider mercy as an independent\nbasis for imposing a life sentence. Robinson's counsel acknowledged his client did not\n\n\n\n                                            342\n\f\"deserve\" mercy, but he asked the jury to grant it for the sake of Robinson's family and in\nlight of the residual doubt surrounding his role in the capital murders.\n\n\nJury Deliberations and Verdict\n\n       The parties put on evidence in support of their penalty phase cases on October 31,\n2002, and the cause was submitted to the jury on November 1, 2002.\n\n\n       During the evening of November 1, 2002, Juror 147 consulted a Gideon Bible that\nhe found in the hotel room where the jury had been sequestered. Juror 147 had essentially\nmade up his mind to vote for a sentence of death and consulted the Bible to see if\nanything would force him to reconsider. Juror 147 wrote down the book and verse\nnumbers of passages he had consulted, but not the Biblical text itself, on a slip of paper\nthat he placed inside the Bible. He testified that nothing in the Bible aided him in arriving\nat his sentencing decision, which remained unchanged after consulting the Bible.\n\n\n       On Saturday, November 2, 2002, at approximately 9:15 a.m., the jurors entered the\njury room to resume deliberations. Juror 147 brought the Bible with the slip of paper into\nthe jury room. The jury immediately took a vote by written ballot and determined that all\njurors were in unanimous agreement as to the proper sentence. The foreman testified that\nat that point the sentence had been decided and all that remained was for him to sign the\nverdict form and inform the district judge. After the vote, the jurors engaged in a general\nconversation about their time on the jury. The conversation was brief and several jurors\ndescribed it as a moment of decompression or unwinding after a long and arduous trial.\nDuring the conversation, Juror 147 told another juror that he had learned from the Bible\nthat in order to be granted mercy, one must ask for mercy, repent, and forgive. Juror 147\ndid not read from or quote any particular verse in making these remarks. Instead, he\nshared his view or interpretation of what the Bible says about the concept of mercy based\n\n                                            343\n\fon his review from the night before. None of the jurors read from or consulted the Bible\nthat Juror 147 had brought into the jury room.\n\n\n       In the meantime, a bailiff had observed Juror 147 enter the jury room with the\nBible and informed the district judge, who removed the juror, along with the Bible,\naround 9:20 a.m., approximately 5 minutes after the jury had resumed deliberations. The\ndistrict judge called each juror independently and inquired into the matter before allowing\nthe parties to make their own inquiry. One juror thought Juror 147 might have opened the\nBible at one point and quoted from one of the verses in the jury room, but he was not\nconfident about the accuracy of this fact. The other 10 jurors testified that Juror 147 did\nnot read from or quote any verse from the Bible during deliberations that morning or at\nany time prior.\n\n\n       The defense moved for a mistrial on the penalty phase proceeding only.

But, based on the\nState's concession, we presume that Juror 147 engaged in misconduct and focus our\ndiscussion on the second prong of the analysis—prejudice.\n\n\nDid Juror 147's Conduct Substantially Prejudice Robinson's Fair Trial Rights?\n\n       A juror's use of or reliance on the Bible during penalty phase deliberations is not\nso uniquely influential that it warrants a finding of prejudice per se.

Thus we are\ncharged with the task of deciding whether Judge Anderson abused his discretion in\nconcluding that Robinson's fair trial rights were not substantially prejudiced by Juror\n147's conduct. See Armstrong, 299 Kan. at 442.\n\n\n       Because Robinson asserts error of a constitutional magnitude, we can affirm his\ndeath sentence only if \"there is no reasonable possibility that the juror's misconduct\naffected the outcome of the trial.\" See Williams, 299 Kan. at 562. Moreover, in\nconducting this analysis, we are mindful that our prejudice inquiry must be limited to\nobjective facts rather than the subjective evidence of the jurors' mental impressions. See\nK.S.A. 60-441; K.S.A. 60-444.\n\n\n       Robinson claims he was prejudiced by Juror 147's consultation of the Bible, his\ndecision to bring it into the jury room, and his comments referencing it during\n\n                                             348\n\fdeliberations. As to Juror 147's independent review of the Bible after deliberations had\nconcluded for the day, courts have been reluctant to condemn such conduct.

This finding is supported by substantial competent evidence and is\nentitled to deference. See Venters v.

The district judge spent the\nnext 5 hours conducting a thorough examination of each juror to assess the extent to\nwhich each or the group had relied upon the Bible in the course of deliberations. Judge\nAnderson's inquiry was supplemented by the parties' own examination of the jurors.\nArmed with this information and fully informed of the circumstances, Judge Anderson\ndetermined the proceedings could continue without injustice to Robinson. Nevertheless,\nout of an abundance of caution, he delivered a supplemental written instruction directing\njurors to decide defendant's sentence without reference to or reliance on the Bible. The\ninstruction was legally appropriate and calculated to remove any taint created by Juror\n147's conduct.\n\n\n       In some contexts, juror instructions are insufficient to cure the taint created by\nprejudicial information. However, courts have not found jurors' use of the Bible during\ndeliberations to be immune to curative instruction. In Lara-Ramirez, the First Circuit\nreviewed a district court's decision to declare a mistrial based on the fact that a juror\n                                             351\n\fbrought a Bible into the jury room, referred to specific portions of the text, and told\nfellow jurors that they should consider what God says in the Bible in their deliberations.\nIn reversing the order granting a mistrial, the First Circuit found the district court had\nemployed a legally incorrect presumption that curative instructions would be inadequate\nafter the jury had embarked upon deliberations. \"Our case law does not support such a\nrestrictive view of curative instructions.

However, when read in context, it was apparent that the jurors were nervous and,\nin some instances, defensive. Judge Anderson made these remarks to calm the jurors so\ntheir responses would be forthright and complete, allowing him to make an informed\ndecision based on an accurate recitation of the facts. Also, the district judge delivered the\ncurative instruction after making such remarks to jurors, and the sequence of events made\nclear that jurors were obligated to set aside biblical influences.\n\n\n       Robinson also cites People v.

However, in Hensley,\nthe juror actually consulted with his minister during the course of deliberations, speaking\nat length about mercy and the death penalty. The minister's comments sent a clear signal\nto the juror that \"mercy, sympathy, and grace are inconsistent with the 'law of the land,'\n                                             352\n\fthat persons who kill must themselves be killed, and that just as a police officer has to kill\nin the line of duty, a juror must 'go with the law of the land.'\" 59 Cal. 4th at 826-27. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court found the conduct prejudicial because the juror actively\nsolicited his pastor's comments while he was still wrestling with his decision and was\ngiven directions inconsistent with the jury instructions. 59 Cal. 4th at 827-28.\n\n\n       Here, Juror 147 consulted the Bible personally and did not engage in\nconversations with any nonjuror, let alone his personal minister, about the Bible's stance\non the death penalty. This fact is important because Hensley recognized a legally\nsignificant distinction between a juror's personal resort to religious values and his or her\ndecision to consult a minister for guidance in deciding the sentence. 59 Cal. 4th at 826-\n28. Also, the juror in Hensley was still struggling with the sentencing decision when he\nconferred with the pastor. Here, Juror 147 made his comments after the jury had taken a\nvote, reaching unanimous agreement as to sentence. Hensley is distinguishable.\n\n\n       Viewing the totality of the circumstances, we are confident that Juror 147's\nconduct was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See Chapman v.

SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE SUPPORTING STATE'S AGGRAVATING CIRCUMSTANCE\n\n       Robinson challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the State's lone\naggravating circumstance—that defendant knowingly or purposely killed more than one\nperson. More particularly, Robinson argues we have defined \"aggravating circumstance\"\nso narrowly that the State's evidence did not fall within the scope of the definition.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       \"The standard of review on appeal as to the sufficiency of evidence regarding an\n       aggravating circumstance is whether, after review of all the evidence, viewed in the light\n       most favorable to the prosecution, the appellate court is convinced that a rational\n       factfinder could have found the existence of the aggravating circumstance beyond a\n       reasonable doubt.\" Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1019.\n\n\n       However, to the extent Robinson's argument is dependent on an interpretation of\nthe aggravating circumstances statute, we review his challenge de novo. See Dodge City\nImplement, Inc. v. Board of Barber County Comm'rs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">288</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 638, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2588110\"><a href=\"/opinion/2588110/dodge-city-implement-inc-v-board-of-comrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2009) (\"Interpretation or construction of a statute raises a question of law reviewable on\nappeal under a de novo standard.\").\n\n\nWas the Evidence Sufficient to Support the State's Aggravating Circumstance?\n\n       The State's lone aggravating circumstance is set out in K.S.A. 21-4625(2), which\nprovides that \"[a]ggravating circumstances shall be limited to the following: . . . (2) The\ndefendant knowingly or purposely killed or created a great risk of death to more than one\nperson.\"\n\n\n       To establish the existence of this aggravating circumstance, Robinson believes the\nstatute requires the State to prove that the killing of more than one person occurred\n                                                   354\n\fduring the course of the charged murder. More specifically, Robinson seems to believe\nthe statute limits the operation of the aggravator to situations in which more than one\nperson is killed essentially at the same time. He then argues that Stasi, Sheila Faith,\nDebbie Faith, and Bonner were not killed during the course of, or in conjunction with, the\nmurders of the primary capital murder victims, Trouten and Lewicka, and, therefore, the\nState failed to establish the existence of this aggravating circumstance.\n\n\n       Robinson's application of the statute is flawed. He cites to our hard 40 precedent,\nState v.

In Spain, we recognized that under K.S.A. 21-4636(b), there\nmust be a direct relationship or nexus between the multiple murders or the great risk of\ndeath to more than one person, i.e., the aggravating circumstance, and the charged\nmurder. However, we made clear that such a risk need not be contemporaneous with the\nhomicide. 263 Kan. at 718. Thereafter, in State v. Hazelton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1264527\"><a href=\"/opinion/1264527/state-v-hazelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 386, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1264527\"><a href=\"/opinion/1264527/state-v-hazelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1999), we acknowledged that proof of the aggravating circumstance did not require\nthat the multiple murders occur contemporaneously and held that K.S.A. 21-4636(b) was\napplicable because the killings there occurred during the same course of conduct.\n\n\n       Here, the State's evidence established that all of the murders charged in the capital\ncounts (the primary capital victims, Lewicka and Trouten, along with the other victims,\nStasi, the Faiths, and Bonner) were connected together as part of a \"common scheme or\ncourse of conduct\" under K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). The existence of such a common scheme\nor course of conduct demonstrates a sufficient nexus between Robinson's killing of more\nthan one person, the aggravating circumstance, and the charged capital offenses. As such,\nwe find K.S.A. 21-4652(2) applies to all of the murders identified in the capital charges\n                                             355\n\fand hold that the State's evidence was sufficient to support the existence of the \"multiple\nmurders\" aggravating circumstance.

PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT—PENALTY PHASE\n\n        Robinson claims the prosecutor committed several acts of misconduct that\ndeprived him of his right to a fair penalty phase proceeding and requests the court vacate\nhis death sentences. Particularly, Robinson believes he was prejudiced by misstatements\nof the law concerning mitigating circumstances during voir dire, improper cross-\nexamination of mitigation witnesses, and the prosecutor's closing argument remarks.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n        We apply the traditional two-step framework in analyzing Robinson's penalty\nphase prosecutorial misconduct challenges, considering first whether the prosecutor\nexceeded the permissible scope of his or her authority by engaging in the challenged\nconduct and, if so, whether defendant suffered prejudice as a result. Kleypas, 272 Kan. at\n1084.\n\n\n        However, in the prejudice analysis, the framework varies slightly from that used in\nthe guilt phase analysis. To the extent the court employs a harmless error analysis as part\nof the prejudice inquiry, we have described the standard as follows:\n\n\n                \"Thus, the standard of review and the ultimate question that must be answered\n        with regard to whether prosecutorial misconduct in the penalty phase of a capital trial was\n                                                   356\n\f      harmless is whether the court is able to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n      prosecutorial misconduct, viewed in the light of the record as a whole, had little, if any,\n      likelihood of changing the jury's ultimate conclusion regarding the weight of the\n      aggravating and mitigating circumstances. In this determination, the overwhelming\n      nature of the evidence is a factor to be considered, although its impact is limited. Also, in\n      making the determination as to whether an error was harmless, it is important to\n      recognize that the question for the reviewing court is not what effect the constitutional\n      error might generally be expected to have upon a reasonable jury but, rather, what effect\n      it had upon the actual verdict in the case at hand.

Louisiana, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n      279, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112868\"><a href=\"/opinion/112868/sullivan-v-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

'The inquiry, in other words, is not\n      whether, in a trial that occurred without the error, a [verdict for death] would surely have\n      been rendered, but whether the [death verdict] actually rendered in this trial was surely\n      unattributable to the error.' 508 U.S. at 279.\" Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1087-88.\n\n\nAlleged Misconduct during Closing Argument\n\n      Robinson argues that the prosecutor engaged in prejudicial misconduct during\nclosing argument by: (1) commenting on Robinson's demeanor; (2) making an argument\nunsupported by the evidence; (3) unfairly attacking Nancy Robinson; and (4) expressing\nhis personal opinion regarding the quality of defense counsel's argument.\n\n\n      1. Did the prosecutor improperly comment on Robinson's demeanor?\n\n      During the State's rebuttal portion of the penalty phase closing, prosecutor\nMorrison argued:\n\n\n              \"When the defendant cried, cried one time during this trial, he didn't cry when\n      there was testimony about Lisa Stasi. He didn't cry when there was testimony about\n      Izabela Lewicka's body was taken out of that barrel. He didn't cry when there was\n      testimony about Suzette Trouten—when her family testified—when her body was taken\n      out of that barrel or Beverly Bonner or Sheila Faith or Debbie Faith. He cried for himself.\n\n                                                  357\n\f       That says it all. He doesn't care anything about anybody but himself. Manipulation and\n       deceit, they go hand in hand with the defendant throughout these last 20 years.\"\n\n\n       Robinson argues these remarks commented improperly on defendant's silence and\ninjected remorse as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. We agree the remark was\nimproper, but on different grounds. The prosecutor's comment pertaining to the one\noccasion Robinson cried during trial was certainly beyond the scope of the penalty phase\nevidence. See State v. Whitaker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189772\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189772/state-v-whitaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1189772\"><a href=\"/opinion/1189772/state-v-whitaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">872</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994) (argument\nbeyond evidence improper).

The prosecutor referenced\nRobinson's demeanor on only one occasion at the end of his rebuttal closing argument.\nSee State v. Chanthaseng, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">293</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 148, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2354947\"><a href=\"/opinion/2354947/state-v-chanthaseng/\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">889</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011) (when deciding\nwhether conduct is gross and flagrant appellate courts look to whether the prosecutor\nrepeated or emphasized the misconduct). The remark was such that it drew no objection\nfrom the defense. State v.

Nor\ndid the comment run afoul of any prior ruling of the district judge. See Chanthaseng, 293\nKan. at 148-49 (prosecutor's ill will reflected through deliberate and repeated misconduct\nor indifference to prior rulings). We hold the improper comment was not gross and\nflagrant. See State v. Novotny, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">1174</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013) (even\n\n\n                                                  358\n\fassuming prosecutor's comment on defendant's demeanor was misconduct, isolated\nnature of remarks did not rise to the level of being gross or flagrant).\n\n\n       The brief and isolated nature of the comment also leads us to conclude that it bore\nlittle weight in the minds of jurors during their consideration of the evidence supporting\nthe aggravating and mitigating circumstances. This is particularly true given that the\nremarks comprised a few lines of a closing argument in a multiweek trial recorded in\nthousands of pages of transcript. See State v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2598865\"><a href=\"/opinion/2598865/state-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">644</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 672, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2598865\"><a href=\"/opinion/2598865/state-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003) (improper closing argument remarks in a few lines in a trial transcript over\n1300 pages did not establish prejudice to fair trial rights). The district judge instructed the\njury that arguments of counsel were not to be considered as evidence and that the jury\nwas to decide defendant's sentence by weighing aggravating circumstances against\nmitigating circumstances. Also, the State presented overwhelming evidence supporting\nits lone aggravating circumstance that Robinson killed more than one person, and the\nState effectively challenged and often discredited Robinson's mitigation evidence. In light\nof the totality of the circumstances, we are confident that the prosecutor's remarks had no\neffect on the sentencing decision. See Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1084-85 (citing Chapman,\n386 U.S. at 24); see also Novotny, 297 Kan. at 1190 (comment on demeanor was\nharmless beyond reasonable doubt, given lack of gross or flagrant remarks and solid\nevidence presented by the State).\n\n\n       2. Did the prosecutor make arguments unsupported by the evidence?\n\n       Robinson challenges three instances where the prosecutor allegedly advanced an\nargument unsupported by the evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                             359\n\f               a. Tender Mercies Comments\n\n\n       During rebuttal closing, prosecutor Morrison argued against Robinson's\nimpassioned plea for mercy during his closing, and in the process used the movie Tender\nMercies as a rhetorical device:\n\n\n       \"There's an old movie out several years that had Robert Duvall, he was a down and out\n       alcoholic country singer and the movie was called Tender Mercies. And in the movie he\n       talks about how hard this guy's life has been and how he was a success at one time. He\n       drank it all away. Now, he's living in some shack with some divorced woman and her\n       little kid and he helps her kind of. He talks in that movie about tender mercies in life, how\n       life is full of tender mercies, these tender mercies are things like being able to hear the\n       rain on the ceiling, getting out of bed in the morning, filling your lungs with air and\n       standing up and stretching or maybe laying in bed for a few extra minutes. Tender\n       mercies are about being able to have a drink of coffee in the morning. Tender mercies are\n       about being able to have visits with loved ones, read letters from them. He wants you to\n       extend all those things to him. He says, gosh, you know, you got you need to, let me live\n       because I'm going to be peaceful in prison, although I haven't demonstrated that.\"\n\n\nThe defense objected, but only to the prosecutor's remark about Robinson claiming he\nwould be peaceful in prison. The district judge sustained the objection and directed the\nprosecutor to proceed.\n\n\n       The prosecutor continued:\n\n\n               \"I've got a history of incredible violence, but let me see my family. When you\n       think of those tender mercies, six dead people in this case, six dead people in this case,\n       they don't have those mercies o[r] they don't get to listen to the rain.\"\n\n\nDefense counsel again objected. The district judge sustained the objection, explaining\nthat the prosecutor was beginning to move past a discussion of the aggravating\n                                                    360\n\fcircumstance and entering into victim impact. As discussed below, we have since\nclarified that a prosecutor may properly introduce evidence of and make argument on\nvictim impact during the penalty phase.\n\n\n       Robinson argues that the prosecutor's Tender Mercies speech constituted\nmisconduct because it was a \"lengthy imaginary script from an actual movie,\" the type\nwe disapproved of in Kleypas. To the contrary, we disagree that the prosecutor's\ncomments were akin to those we found improper in Kleypas. There the prosecutor invited\njurors to speculate what the victim \"'must have thought when [defendant] burst through\nthat door'\"; \"'the anguish she must have felt when she saw that knife'\"; and \"'how long\nthat time must have seemed to [the victim].'\" 272 Kan. at 1112. Then the prosecutor\nprovided answers to those questions through an imaginary script of the deceased victim,\nwhich told jurors about the victim's final thoughts based on pure speculation. We found\nthe arguments improper because \"when the prosecutor began speculating as to the\nvictim's thoughts and essentially making up an [i]nternal dialogue for the victim, he\ncrossed the line into a blatant appeal to the emotions of the jury.\" 272 Kan. at 1114.\n\n\n       Here, Morrison's argument did not speculate as to the victims' thoughts and did not\noffer an imaginary dialogue from the deceased. Instead, he used the Tender Mercies film\nto illustrate why the aggravating factor of multiple murders should outweigh Robinson's\nclosing argument appeals for mercy and a life sentence. See State v.

On their face, the comments improperly expressed\nthe opinion of the prosecutor and were improper. We disagree with the State's attempt to\ncharacterize the comments as mere rhetorical expressions.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, the conduct was not prejudicial to Robinson. The prosecutor made\nthe comments on one occasion in response to the defense's mitigation theory; the defense\nlodged no objection; and the remarks did not run afoul of the district judge's prior rulings.\nWe find the remarks were not gross or flagrant or the product of ill will. Moreover, while\nbeyond the wide latitude afforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence, the comments\nwere made in response to expert testimony concerning defendant's propensity toward\nviolence in prison.

Comments about the Severity of Robinson's Capital Murders\n\n       During penalty phase opening statements, the prosecutor explained that the\npurpose of the penalty phase under Kansas' capital sentencing scheme is to distinguish\nbetween capital murders that warrant a life sentence and those that warrant a sentence of\ndeath. The prosecutor repeated this explanation at the outset of closing argument.\n\n\n       During the rebuttal portion of penalty phase closing argument, the prosecutor\nchallenged Robinson's mitigation case and emphasized the significance of the multiple\nmurder aggravating circumstance. In making this argument, the prosecutor remarked:\n\n\n       \"Is this a severe capital murder? Is it one of greater enormity than the—is it one of greater\n       gravity than the average? Of course it is. Is somebody who kills in a course of conduct\n       that lasts almost two decades the worst kind of murderer imaginable? Does he deserve the\n       death penalty? We all know the answer to that question. We all know the answer to that\n       question.\"\n\n\n       In his final remarks to the jury, the prosecutor returned to the purpose of the\npenalty phase proceedings under Kansas' statutory scheme.\n\n\n               \"This process is all about finding just punishment, fairness, and I'm sure we\n       would all agree that capital punishment should be reserved for the most severe crimes. It\n\n                                                   363\n\f       should be reserved for the most severe crimes, only the most heinous of acts should be\n       punished with that sentence. Obviously with this, if not him, then who? I'll leave you\n       with that thought.\"\n\n\n       Robinson believes that these remarks, both those explaining the purpose of the\npenalty phase process and those commenting on the gravity of Robinson's crimes,\nimproperly called on the jury to compare Robinson's murders to other capital murders\nthat were not part of this record.\n\n\n       We disagree. Morrison's remarks explaining the purpose of the penalty phase\nreasonably conveyed to jurors that the process served as a mechanism to narrow the class\nof individuals eligible to receive a sentence of death by comparing aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances.

The prosecutor did not inject\ninformation from other capital cases or otherwise discuss matters beyond the evidence.\nThe remarks properly suggested that Robinson's conduct and moral culpability was so\n\n                                                  364\n\fsevere that it warranted a sentence of death, an argument within the wide latitude\nafforded prosecutors in discussing the evidence. Cf. Scott, 286 Kan. at 81 (prosecutor\nmay refer to defendant as a murderer or killer when arguing that evidence shows\ndefendant committed murder).\n\n\n       Robinson believes the prosecutor's attempt to answer his own rhetorical\nquestion—\"Is this a severe capital murder?\"—injected his own personal opinion based on\nhis experience as a prosecutor. However, when viewed in context, the prosecutor was\nusing a rhetorical device to emphasize the weight of the multiple murders evidence and to\nillustrate that under the narrowing function of Kansas' capital sentencing scheme, a death\nsentence was warranted. See Hall v. Luebbers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783343\"><a href=\"/opinion/783343/stanley-hall-appelleecross-appellant-v-al-luebbers-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716-17 (8th Cir. 2003)\n(finding no misconduct from prosecutor's argument that not every capital murder meets\nthe legal requirements for the death penalty, but this one did based on evidence proving\nall requirements for imposing death penalty); Cunningham v.

For the same\nreasons, the argument did not inject a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance.\n\n\n       Robinson also suggests that the prosecutor's final remark—\"[I]f not him, then\nwho?\" —appealed to the jurors' sense of duty to maintain the death penalty as a viable\nsentencing option under state law, contrary to our holding in Scott, 286 Kan. at 79\n(Prosecutorial comments that tell \"jurors to honor their oath and return a verdict of\nguilty\" impliedly suggest that to do otherwise would be a violation of such duty and are\nimproper.). However, the prosecutor did not suggest jurors would violate their oath by\nsentencing the defendant to life imprisonment. Instead, his comment was designed to\nemphasize the weight of the aggravating circumstance and demonstrate the propriety of a\n                                            365\n\fdeath sentence under the narrowing function of Kansas' capital sentencing scheme.

Did the prosecutor improperly attack Nancy Robinson?\n\n       During Robinson's penalty phase case, Nancy Robinson testified to the character\nof her husband as a good father, grandfather, and family man. She also informed jurors\nthat she and other family members would continue to maintain relationships with\nRobinson and be spared grief if he were sentenced to life imprisonment. The State\neffectively challenged the credibility and reliability of her opinions on cross-examination.\n\n\n       During the initial portion of the State's penalty phase closing argument, the\nprosecutor commented on Nancy Robinson and the credibility of the opinions she\nprovided to the jury.\n\n\n               \"Then we had Nancy Robinson, in some ways a tragic figure, and in some ways a\n       sad figure, in some ways a pathetic figure, who takes the term 'stand by your man' to a\n       whole new level. In many ways if you look at the evidence in this case, Nancy Robinson\n       is just another of the many victims of this man (indicating), just another victim.\n               \"She's up here crying (indicating), lives probably been ruined because of what he\n       has done, because of what he has done to her and that family. Has she been manipulated?\n       Has she been deceived? Look at the letter that I put in yesterday; read the note. That will\n\n                                                   366\n\f       answer that question for you. She had been manipulated to stand by after a continuum of\n       5, 10, 15, 25 year streams of girlfriends right under her nose, BDS&M relationships,\n       prison terms, probation revs, trials, the 'stand by him,' is she a victim? Yep. After\n       conviction of multiple murders that are of the most heinous yesterday, she tells us, well,\n       I'm not sure if I want a divorce or not.\n               ....\n               \"Decide for yourselves. When I asked her, you know, you testified for him before\n       in his earlier trials; haven't you? Yep. You were there at his hearings and his sentencing\n       probation revocations? Yep. Well, didn't you know that he was a suspect back in the mid\n       '80s in the disappearance of a woman and little girl? I must have been out in the hall and\n       her fall-back answer, 'Nobody asked me.' What do you think? What do you think? Can\n       you be a great dad when you're in prison? Can you be a great dad and grandpa when\n       you're doing the kind of things the defendant has done? You answer that question.\"\n\n\nDefense counsel objected midway through these comments after the prosecutor\nmentioned Nancy Robinson's uncertainty as to whether she would divorce Robinson. The\ndistrict judge overruled the objection, finding the comment within the scope of the\nevidence.\n\n\n       Robinson argues these remarks were improper because they communicated the\ntheme that Nancy Robinson's pleas to spare her husband's life should be disregarded\nbecause \"the prosecutor held her in suspicion.\"\n\n\n       Robinson seems to misconstrue the prosecutor's argument. He was not attempting\nto implicate Nancy Robinson in her husband's criminal activity. Instead, the comments\nchallenged the credibility and reliability of her opinion regarding Robinson's character as\na good family man. His comments were founded on her cross-examination testimony and\nreasonable inferences from it. The argument was well within the latitude afforded\nprosecutors in arguing the evidence. See State v.

Did the prosecutor improperly attack defense counsel's argument?\n\n       Finally, Robinson takes issue with prosecutor Morrison's personalized attack of\narguments advanced by defense counsel. During defense counsel's closing argument, he\nsuggested that there was residual doubt as to whether Robinson acted alone. At the\nbeginning of the State's rebuttal closing, the prosecutor said, \"I find it absolutely insulting\nand astonishing that [defense counsel] wants to talk about whether,\" at which point\ndefense counsel lodged an objection and the district judge sustained it. The prosecutor\nmoved on, returning to a discussion of the aggravating circumstance evidence.\n\n\n       Comments that disparage the arguments of the defense or the role of defense\ncounsel in the adversarial process are improper.

The prosecutor's remark suggested he personally felt one of\nthe defense's arguments was \"insulting and astounding.\" The remark was an improper\ncomment on the evidence.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, it was not prejudicial. The prosecutor's remark was isolated, and it\nwas incomplete because the statement was interrupted by the defense's objection and\ndistrict judge's ruling. We find the comment was not gross or flagrant. Because of its\nisolated and incomplete character, along with the fact that the prosecutor continued on in\n\n                                             368\n\fcompliance with the district judge's ruling, the remark also fell short of establishing ill\nwill. Nor would the comment have weighed heavily in the minds of jurors. Had the\nprosecutor completed his statement, Robinson might have had a more viable argument.\nHowever, the interruption left jurors only with the knowledge that the prosecutor was\noffended by some argument the defense had made, a relatively benign statement.\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, we hold that the comment was harmless\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.

Did the prosecutor commit misconduct during the cross-examination of Nancy\n       Robinson?\n\n       During the defense's mitigation case, Nancy Robinson testified to defendant's\ncharacter as a good family man, father, and grandfather. During cross-examination, the\nprosecutor asked, \"[W]ould it affect your opinion of your husband if you knew that he\nhad taken [their granddaughter] to liaisons with one of his BDS&M girlfriends?\"\n\n\n       The defense objected, and the district judge held a bench conference. The\nprosecutor informed the district judge it had a witness who could substantiate the factual\nbasis of the question, i.e., that during the course of their BDS&M relationship, Robinson\nbrought his infant grandchild to their BDS&M liaisons on more than one occasion. Judge\nAnderson ruled that the defense had opened the door to the inquiry, which was properly\ncalculated to elicit relevant evidence to impeach Nancy Robinson's opinion of Robinson's\ncharacter as caring grandfather. Based on the prosecutor's proffer, the district judge\nallowed the inquiry, and Nancy Robinson testified that she did not know whether her\nopinion would be affected by this fact unless she knew the entirety of the circumstances.\n\n       A prosecutor's questions must be relevant and supported by a good-faith basis for\nbelieving the asserted matter to be true.

The prosecutor made a proffer of the\ntestimony that supported his good-faith basis for the question at the time of the objection.\nThe district judge not only found that the prosecutor had established a good-faith basis\nfor his questioning, but also ruled appropriately that the inquiry was calculated to elicit\n\n\n                                             370\n\frelevant evidence impeaching Nancy Robinson's testimony regarding Robinson's\ncharacter as a good grandfather.\n\n\n       Moreover, the following day, the prosecutor intended to introduce testimony from\nSandra Shields to establish that Robinson brought his infant grandchild with him on more\nthan one BDS&M liaison. The State intended to introduce this testimony to rebut the\ndefense's evidence that the Johnson County Detention Center allowed Robinson to have\ncontact visits with his grandchild, giving rise to the inference that they shared a special\nrelationship. The prosecutor provided a more detailed proffer of Shields' testimony, but\nthe district judge ruled that it was not proper rebuttal to the defense's evidence of\nRobinson's contact visits. While inadmissible for that purpose, the proffer confirms that\nthe prosecutor had a good-faith basis for his cross-examination of Nancy Robinson.\n\n\n       Robinson takes issue with the fact that the jury never heard the good-faith basis for\nthe questions posed to Nancy Robinson, citing State v. McCaslin, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">697</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2378023\"><a href=\"/opinion/2378023/state-v-mccaslin/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1030</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011), overruled on other grounds by State v.

There we found the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by lodging\ninflammatory questions that lacked a good-faith factual basis and were never intended to\nelicit a substantive response. Although the prosecutor later provided a good-faith basis\nfor the questions during the hearing on defendant's motion for new trial, the jury never\nheard it, potentially leaving the jury to imagine \"'all kinds of damaging and prejudicial\nbut false or inadmissible facts'\" that the defense could not refute. 291 Kan. at 720. Like\nMcCaslin, in this case the jury was left to imagine certain details; but unlike McCaslin,\nthe basic asserted facts in the prosecutor's questions were supported by proffered\ntestimony and reasonably calculated to elicit relevant testimony from Nancy Robinson.\nMoreover, the defense had no intention of exposing the jury to the facts supporting the\nprosecutor's good-faith basis for his questioning. In fact, defense counsel fought\nvigorously to exclude Shields' testimony for good reason—these facts were detrimental to\n                                             371\n\fhis mitigation case. Even if there was error in the exclusion of Shields' testimony, it\nwould have been invited by the defense. We hold there was no misconduct.\n\n\n       2. Did the prosecutor commit misconduct during the cross-examination of Mark\n       Cunningham?\n\n       The defense called Cunningham to testify that Robinson would make a positive,\nnonviolent adjustment to prison. During direct examination, defense counsel asked\nCunningham whether Robinson would have access to the Internet. Cunningham\nresponded, \"No, sir,\" explaining that prisoner communications are very carefully\nmonitored in a maximum security setting and that it would be negligent to allow a\nprisoner who had used the Internet to facilitate his crimes to have access to the same tool\ninside prison. Cunningham also said that whatever computer access defendant would\nhave, would be restricted, especially the Internet.\n\n\n       During cross-examination, prosecutor Welch asked Cunningham about Internet\naccess within the Kansas Department of Corrections institutions.\n\n\n       \"Q.    Now, you talked a little bit with [defense counsel] about the defendant's access or\n              potential access to the computers should he be incarcerated. I kind of got the\n              impression that perhaps you hadn't spoken with Kansas DOC about specific\n              access to computers?\n\n       \"A.    No, ma'am, I have not.\n\n       \"Q.    We're not sure whether he would have access to computers or what type of access\n              he would have or not, correct?\n\n       \"A.    Not definitively to Kansas as a general—I mean, a lot of prisons across the\n              United States on a pretty routine basis there is not access to computers in prison\n              that there are in our homes, and particularly Internet access, but I have not\n\n                                                  372\n\f               questioned Kansas specifically about their computer policy with inmates.\"\n               (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       During closing argument, prosecutor Morrison challenged Robinson's mitigation\nevidence by highlighting his use of fraud and deception to facilitate crime both inside and\noutside the prison environment.\n\n\n               \"Gosh, if they [recommendation letters fraudulently created or altered by\n       Robinson] would have been real, the people would have said good things about it. What\n       does that tell us? Model inmate, somebody who should be allowed to peacefully live out\n       his life in prison, somebody who won't be a threat. You've never heard us say for a\n       second that we're concerned about the defendant attack[ing] somebody in prison [and]\n       starting a gang or riot. That's not his way. His way is manipulation, his way is deceit that\n       often ends in tragic consequences. You decide. I thought it interesting that Mr.\n       Cunningham didn't take two minutes to decide whether or not his bait of choice, the\n       computer, will even be available for him in prison. Would you agree that that's his lure of\n       choice?\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n       Robinson argues that the prosecutor's use of the term \"we're,\" instead of \"you're,\"\nin questioning Cunningham improperly suggested that both the State and Cunningham\npersonally thought it possible that Robinson could have Internet access in prison. He also\nbelieves prosecutor Morrison's comments during closing argument were improper if, in\nfact, KDOC prohibited Internet access to prisoners. Robinson then cites to a KDOC\npolicy from 2002, attached to the briefing, which appears to prohibit Internet access for\ninmates.\n\n\n       The problem for Robinson is that the court is limited to record evidence in\nanalyzing the prosecutorial misconduct challenge, and the KDOC policy was never\nintroduced as evidence during the penalty phase. As to prosecutor Welch's questioning of\nCunningham, her use of the word \"we're\" rather than \"you're\" is of little significance.\n                                                   373\n\fRobinson offers no support for his claim that the prosecutor lacked a good-faith basis for\nher questioning, and even if he did, the expert's testimony on direct implied that he had\nnot researched KDOC policy specifically, providing the prosecutors with a good-faith\nbasis for the inquiry on cross-examination.\n\n\n         Based on the foregoing, the prosecutor's questions to Cunningham and the closing\nargument remarks were well within the appropriate bounds of cross-examination\nwitnesses and closing argument. Robinson has failed to demonstrate misconduct on this\nbasis.\n\n\n         3. Did the prosecutor improperly question Nancy Robinson about the infant?\n\n         During the cross-examination of Nancy Robinson, prosecutor Morrison asked\nwhether she reported to authorities that Robinson came home with an infant baby at the\ntime of Stasi's disappearance in January 1985. The district judge overruled the defense's\ngeneral objection, finding the question relevant.\n\n\n         Robinson argues that the prosecutor did not have an adequate basis for asking the\nquestion and that it improperly implied that Nancy Robinson was an accomplice to\ndefendant's crimes. However, the State's evidence had established that Robinson returned\nhome with an infant around the time of Lisa Stasi's disappearance. Her testimony also\nimplied that she did not report this incident to law enforcement. The record confirms the\nprosecutor's good-faith basis for the inquiry.\n\n\n         The prosecutor's question was also relevant. Contrary to Robinson's assertion, the\nprosecutor did not ask the question to implicate Nancy Robinson in any criminal activity.\nInstead, the question was designed to challenge the credibility of Nancy Robinson and\nher testimony that her husband was a good family man. As such, the prosecutor did not\nengage in any misconduct.\n                                              374\n\f       4. Were questions about Social Security benefit checks improper?\n\n       The record evidence established that Robinson murdered Sheila and Debbie Faith\nand, thereafter, deposited their Social Security benefit checks into various accounts under\nhis control. Two of these checks were cashed in Florida, around the time defendant and\nhis wife were there attending a wedding. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked\nNancy Robinson if she was there when defendant cashed those two checks. The defense\nlodged no objection.\n\n\n       Robinson now alleges that the prosecutor supplied no factual basis for the\nquestioning. The above summary of the record evidence suggests the contrary. Moreover,\nthe defense did not object to the question at trial, and the prosecution had no reason to\naffirmatively supply a factual basis for the inquiry. See Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1090 (\"The\nfailure of the defendant to object and to trigger the prosecutor's proffer of a good faith\nbasis precludes a finding of error on this issue.\").\n\n\n       5. Were questions related to Cunningham's written report improper?\n\n       During the State's cross-examination of Cunningham, prosecutor Welch explored\nthe expert's qualifications, methodology, and fee. Through this questioning, the State\nestablished that Cunningham earned $11,000 for his services. Prosecutor Welch then\nasked Cunningham whether he had prepared a written report, to which he answered, \"No,\nma'am.\" Prosecutor Welch then asked, \"Were you asked by defense counsel not to write a\nreport?,\" to which Cunningham again responded, \"No, ma'am.\"\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor lacked a good-faith basis to assert as fact that\ndefense counsel advised Cunningham not to produce a written report. However, the\nprosecutor's question did not assert this as fact. Instead, the prosecutor asked the question\n                                             375\n\fin a fact-neutral manner, \"Were you asked by defense counsel not to write a report?\" This\nallowed Cunningham to respond, \"No ma'am,\" dispelling any notion that defense counsel\nhad instructed the expert not to prepare a written report. The prosecutor's inquiry was\nproper.\n\n\n         Robinson cites State v. Atkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1489514\"><a href=\"/opinion/1489514/state-v-atkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.

There, the prosecutor asked a series of questions of the defense\ninvestigator as to why he did not prepare a written report. On appeal, the New Jersey\nSuperior Court found the trial court should have provided the jury with an instruction that\nno written report was required and that it should draw no adverse inference from its\nabsence. 405 N.J. Super. at 406. However, the Superior Court did not find that the\nprosecutor had engaged in misconduct by exploring this line of questioning, and it did not\nsuggest that the prosecutor lacked a good-faith basis for such questions. Instead, it found\nerror because the trial judge compelled the defense to produce its retained investigator's\nnotes from an interview with the victim, and these notes contained the victim's prior\nconsistent statements that defendant had molested her, violating the privilege for\nnontestifying experts. At trial, the prosecutor used this evidence against the defendant,\neffectively turning defense counsel's consulting expert into a witness for the prosecution.\nThe prosecutor's questions regarding the existence of a written report compounded the\ntrial court's error in compelling production of the written notes in the first instance. Atkins\nis factually distinguishable and lacks persuasive value when compared to Robinson's\nfacts.\n\n\n         In the end, Robinson has failed to establish misconduct as it relates to any of the\nfive challenges alleging that prosecutors lacked a good-faith basis for facts asserted\nwithin their cross-examination questioning of Robinson's mitigation witnesses.\n\n\n\n\n                                              376\n\fAlleged Misstatements of the Law during Voir Dire\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor committed prejudicial misconduct by misstating\nthe law relating to mitigating circumstances during voir dire. Specifically, he contends\nthat the prosecutor: (1) mischaracterized mitigating circumstances as those pertaining to\nthe crime itself; and (2) improperly suggested jurors could assign mitigation evidence no\nweight whatsoever.\n\n\n       We apply the same two-part standard of review for alleged prosecutorial\nmisconduct during voir dire. State v. Simmons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2453676\"><a href=\"/opinion/2453676/state-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">292</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 412, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2453676\"><a href=\"/opinion/2453676/state-v-simmons/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011)\n(noting that two-part framework has been applied to the voir dire process).\n\n\n       1. Did prosecutors define mitigating circumstances improperly?\n\n       Robinson first contends the prosecutor misstated the law in summarizing the\nconcept of mitigating circumstances during voir dire.\n\n\n       A prosecutor's misstatement of the law is improper and satisfies the first prong of\nthe two-part prosecutorial misconduct standard. See State v. Cosby, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">230</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247-\n48, 16</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599471\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599471/state-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">128 (2007) (prosecutor's comment was a misstatement of law on\npremeditation and thus was improper). We have defined mitigating circumstances as\nthose \"which in fairness may be considered as extenuating or reducing the degree of\nmoral culpability, or blame, or which justify a sentence of less than death, even though\nthey do not justify or excuse the offense. \" Kleypas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599107\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599107/state-v-kleypas/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl. ¶ 79.\n\n\n       Robinson identifies three occasions where prosecutor Morrison allegedly\nmisstated the definition of mitigating circumstances during small group voir dire. First,\nduring voir dire of the fourth panel, which included petit Juror 39, the prosecutor\nexplained, \"Mitigating circumstances would be those circumstances that would make it\n                                            377\n\fnot as bad, if you will, not as morally wrong, if you will, as your typical capital murder.\"\nRobinson contends this definition improperly limited mitigating circumstances to the\nfacts of the crime.\n\n\n       Robinson's argument lacks merit. The prosecutor's description of mitigating\ncircumstances as those that diminish the moral culpability of the offense is entirely\nconsistent with the definition set forth in Kleypas. Contrary to Robinson's assertion, the\nprosecutor's definition did not exclude circumstances outside the facts of the crime itself.\n\n\n       Robinson argues the prosecutor reinforced this allegedly narrow construction by\nfollowing up his definition with hypothetical questions that focused on the facts of the\ncrime rather than the background and character of the defendant. The argument is\nmisplaced. When Juror 41 suggested she would automatically vote for the death penalty\nregardless of the circumstances, prosecutor Morrison provided a hypothetical comparing\ntwo contract killings: one where a drug dealer contracted the murder of a police officer\nand the other where a sexually abused woman contracted the murder of her abuser. The\nprosecutor asked Juror 41 if she would view those hypothetical cases the same in terms of\npunishment or, instead, would consider the circumstances unique to each. The prosecutor\nwas not attempting to provide a legal definition of mitigating circumstances but, instead,\nwas properly exploring whether the veniremember was mitigation-impaired. In fact, the\nsecond hypothetical actually highlighted the defendant's social history and background as\na victim of sexual abuse and was not limited to the facts of the crime itself. The\nprosecutor did not exceed the bounds afforded to him in questioning veniremembers.\n\n\n       Second, Robinson objects to the prosecutor's discussion of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances during voir dire of the thirteenth small group panel, which\nincluded petit Jurors 87 and 92. Prosecutor Morrison asked Juror 82 whether he would\nconsider aggravating and mitigating circumstances and if he agreed that every case is\n                                            378\n\fdifferent. After responding in the affirmative to both questions, prosecutor Morrison\nasked, \"And if I gave you a scenario of a hundred homicides, we'd be able to find\ndifferences in the facts and circumstances of all of them, correct?\" Defense counsel\nobjected, claiming that the question unduly narrowed mitigating circumstances to the\nfacts surrounding the crime itself, but the district judge overruled, explaining that the\nobjection presumed the question dealt only with the elements of the crime and not other\nmitigating and aggravating factors. We find no basis in the record to disagree with Judge\nAnderson's interpretation of the prosecutor's question and find no misconduct on this\nbasis.\n\n\n         Finally, Robinson contends that petit Juror 246 was exposed to similar\nmisstatements of the law. During voir dire of the twenty-second small group panel,\nprosecutor Morrison made the following comments while describing the capital\nsentencing scheme:\n\n\n                 \"The second phase is after a defendant has been convicted of capital murder. And\n         in that phase, evidence is heard called evidence of aggravating circumstances and\n         evidence of mitigating circumstances. Aggravating circumstances will be those things\n         that tend to favor a death sentence. Mitigating circumstances will be those things that will\n         tend to favor a life sentence. Everybody kind of understand? Worse stuff generally is\n         aggravated. Things that tend to lessen guilt or excuse behaviors tend to be mitigation.\n         Understand? Everybody with me?\" (Emphasis added.)\n\n\n         The prosecutor's description of mitigating circumstances was consistent with\nKansas law. Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1103 (defining mitigating circumstances as those\nwhich justify a sentence of less than death or reduce moral culpability or blame). While it\nis improper for a prosecutor to argue that circumstances are not mitigating because they\ndo not excuse the crime, State v.

Did the prosecutor comment improperly on weight assigned to mitigating\n       circumstances?\n\n       Robinson also challenges comments prosecutor Morrison made during voir dire of\nthe fourth small group panel, which he sees as suggesting that a juror could assign little\nor no weight to mitigating circumstances evidence.\n\n\n       Specifically, during voir dire of this panel, the prosecutor explained, \"[T]he rules\nare going to say 'you shall consider' [mitigating circumstances]. Doesn't necessarily mean\nyou have to give a lot of weight to it or even any weight, but you shall consider.\"\nMoments later, prosecutor Morrison commented:\n\n\n       \"Does everybody here understand it is for you to determine what, if any, weight you give\n       to an aggravating circumstance or a mitigating circumstance? It is for you to determine\n       what, if any, weight you give. But you must be willing to consider those things. That's the\n       question.\"\n\n\n       Contrary to Robinson, we find these comments were consistent with established\nlaw. In Johnson v.

Consequently, in its instructions, the trial court used the then-\napplicable language from Kleypas, requiring jurors to find that aggravating circumstances\noutweighed mitigating circumstances before imposing a sentence of death. After\nRobinson's trial, in Marsh, 548 U.S. at 170-73, the United States Supreme Court found\nthe statutory weighing equation had been constitutional as enacted, i.e., a sentence of\ndeath could be imposed so long as aggravators were not outweighed by mitigators.\n\n\n       Robinson's argument arises under Instruction No. 10, which provides: \"The State\nhas the burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that there are one or more aggravating\ncircumstances and that they outweigh any mitigating circumstances believed to exist.\"\nThe instruction was based on the recommended instruction in PIK Crim. 3d 56.00-E and\nmirrored the language of the applicable statute, K.S.A. 21-4624(e) (Furse 1995), with one\nminor alteration.\n\n\n       Robinson believes this language is ambiguous because \"beyond a reasonable\ndoubt\" only clearly modifies the State's burden to prove that there are one or more\n                                                  383\n\faggravating circumstances, giving rise to the possibility that the instruction creates two\nburdens of proof: beyond a reasonable doubt for proof of the existence of aggravating\ncircumstances; and preponderance of the evidence for whether aggravators outweigh\nmitigators. Robinson argues his position is corroborated by prosecutor Welch's argument\nduring the jury instructions conference that the State did not have a double reasonable\ndoubt burden and that she did not read the instructions to create one.\n\n\n       Robinson offers little aside from speculation to suggest jurors would adopt his\ninterpretation of the instructions rather than the one chosen by the district judge, the PIK\nCommittee, and the legislature.

The assistant\ndistrict attorney's argument notwithstanding, a commonsense interpretation of the\nlanguage in Instruction No. 10 is that the State's burden of proof beyond a reasonable\ndoubt applies to both object clauses of the sentence—that aggravators exist and that\naggravators outweigh mitigating circumstances. That interpretation is clearly confirmed\nby language in Instruction No. 12, which provides: \"[I]f one or more jurors is not\npersuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating\ncircumstances, then you should sign the appropriate alternative verdict form,\" and\nInstruction No. 8, which states that \"[m]itigating circumstances are to be determined by\neach individual juror when deciding whether the State has proved beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the death penalty should be imposed.\"\n\n\n                                            384\n\f       Reading the instructions together, we find no reasonable likelihood that jurors\napplied the instructions in a way that prevented consideration of constitutionally relevant\nevidence.\n\n\nAlleged Failure to Convey that Each Juror Could Find Mitigating Circumstances\n\n       In Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1078, this court advised that, going forward,\n\n\n       \"[a]ny instruction dealing with the consideration of mitigating circumstances should state\n       (1) they need to be proved only to the satisfaction of the individual juror in the juror's\n       sentencing decision and not beyond a reasonable doubt and (2) mitigating circumstances\n       do not need to be found by all members of the jury in order to be considered in an\n       individual juror's sentencing decision.\"\n\n\n       We have repeated the advisement in almost every death penalty decision since.\nSee Scott, 286 Kan. at 106-07; Cheever, 295 Kan. at 266; Gleason, 299 Kan. at 1193-97;\nState v.

Mitigating circumstances are to be\n       determined by each individual juror when deciding whether the State has proved beyond\n       a reasonable doubt that the death penalty should be imposed. The same mitigating\n       circumstances do not need to be found by all members of the jury in order to be\n       considered by an individual juror in arriving at his or her sentencing decision.

Robinson compares this case to the instructions in\nScott. But in Scott, the trial court did not include any instruction informing the jurors that\nit was unnecessary they agree on mitigating factors. Robinson also relies on Abu-Jamal v.\nHorn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1200725\"><a href=\"/opinion/1200725/abu-jamal-v-horn/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 302 (3d Cir. 2008), cert. granted, judgment vacated, and case\nremanded sub nom.

But there the jury was\nnot given any instruction on how to determine mitigating circumstances. Moreover, after\nRobinson's brief was filed, the Abu-Jamal case was vacated and remanded in light of the\nSupreme Court's opinion in Smith v. Spisak, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1749\"><a href=\"/opinion/1749/smith-v-spisak/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 148-49, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1749\"><a href=\"/opinion/1749/smith-v-spisak/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instruction No. 8 clearly informs the jurors that\nmitigating circumstances \"are to be determined by each individual juror\" and \"do not\nneed to be found by all members of the jury in order to be considered by an individual\njuror.\" Viewing the instructions collectively, there is no reasonable likelihood that the\njury applied them in a way that prevented the consideration of constitutionally relevant\nevidence.\n\n\nInstructions' Alleged Encouragement of a Death Verdict\n\n       In his third challenge to the penalty phase instructions, Robinson argues the\nlanguage used to convey the contours of the sentencing decision confronting the jury\ncreated a presumption of death and improperly influenced the jury to arrive at such a\ndetermination. Robinson focuses on language in Instructions Nos. 12 and 13 and in the\nfour verdict forms that describes a jury decision not to impose the death penalty as an\n\n                                             386\n\finability to reach a decision. Robinson characterizes this language as speaking \"of a death\nsentence as if it were something that the jury should strive to achieve, and a life sentence\nas a failure or inability to reach that objective.\"\n\n       Robinson recognizes the primary shortcoming of his argument, that the\ninstructions given by the trial judge were based on the language of the statute providing\nfor the penalty phase hearing, which provides:\n\n\n                \"If, by unanimous vote, the jury finds beyond a reasonable doubt that one or\n       more of the aggravating circumstances enumerated in K.S.A. 21-4625 and amendments\n       thereto exist and, further, that the existence of such aggravating circumstances is not\n       outweighed by any mitigating circumstances which are found to exist, the defendant shall\n       be sentenced to death; otherwise, the defendant shall be sentenced as provided by law.\n       The jury, if its verdict is a unanimous recommendation of a sentence of death, shall\n       designate in writing, signed by the foreman of the jury, the statutory aggravating\n       circumstances which it found beyond a reasonable doubt. If, after a reasonable time for\n       deliberation, the jury is unable to reach a verdict, the judge shall dismiss the jury and\n       impose a sentence of imprisonment as provided by law and shall commit the defendant to\n       the custody of the secretary of corrections.\" (Emphasis added.)

Moreover, the Court reviewed instructions based on K.S.A.\n21-4624(e) and said:\n\n       \"Kansas jurors, presumed to follow their instructions, are made aware that: a\n       determination that mitigators outweigh aggravators is a decision that a life sentence is\n       appropriate; a determination that aggravators outweigh mitigators or a determination that\n       mitigators do not outweigh aggravators—including a finding that aggravators and\n       mitigators are in balance—is a decision that death is the appropriate sentence; and an\n\n                                                   387\n\f       inability to reach a unanimous decision will result in a sentence of life imprisonment.\"\n       548 U.S. at 179-80.\n\n\n       Contrary to Robinson's argument that jurors are not given a way to express a\ndecision for a life sentence, Marsh suggests they are told exactly how to do that.

See State v.\nSmith-Parker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">132</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 164, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">485</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2014) (jury instruction which provided\nthat jury \"will\" enter verdict of guilty in absence of reasonable doubt clearly erroneous\nbecause \"[i]t essentially forbade the jury from exercising its power of nullification\").\nHowever, the use of the term \"shall\" in Instruction No. 12 tracks the statutory language.\nK.S.A. 21-4624(e) (providing defendant \"shall\" be sentenced to death if aggravating\ncircumstances not outweighed by mitigating circumstances). Instruction No. 12 also\nprovides guidance for the jury to provide an alternative verdict for a life sentence. As\nsuch, we find the instruction is unlike the situation in Smith-Parker and does not \"fly too\nclose to the sun of directing a verdict for the State.\" 301 Kan. at 164. Indeed, the\npossibility of jury nullification logically requires, as a necessary precondition, the\nexistence of a mandatory charge from the court, such as \"shall impose.\"\n\n\n       In addition, Robinson argues the \"should\" in the second paragraph of the\ninstruction misstated Kansas law and improperly slanted the instruction toward the death\npenalty. Ideally, the instruction should have employed the term \"shall\" in discussing the\nboth the life verdict and the death verdict, consistent with K.S.A. 21-4624(e). However,\nwhen the instructions are read together as a whole, they made clear to jurors that there\nwere two sentencing options available and that jurors' ultimate sentencing decision was\ndependent on the jurors' application of the evidence to the statutory weighing equation.\nAs such, Instruction No. 12 was unlikely to create juror confusion and did not create a\nreasonable likelihood that jurors would have applied it in a way that prevented\n\n                                                   389\n\fconsideration of constitutionally relevant evidence. Despite the absence of error under\nthese facts, we caution that similar instructions should conform with the statutory\nlanguage, for under a different set of facts, the instruction may be deemed erroneous\nunder the applicable standard of review.\n\n\n                     17.

Kleypas, 272 Kan. at 1016-18, we found\nunconstitutional as applied the provision contained in K.S.A. 21-4624(e) that directed a\npenalty phase jury to impose the death sentence if aggravating circumstances found to\nexist were not outweighed by mitigating circumstances found to exist.

The United States\nSupreme Court later reversed Marsh and held the Kansas death penalty scheme,\nincluding the weighing equation as originally written, constitutional. Kansas v. Marsh,\n548 U.S. at 173, 181.\n\n\n       Robinson was tried in 2002, subsequent to Kleypas but before our opinion in\nMarsh and the Supreme Court's later reversal of that opinion. Broken down to its\nsyllogistic form, Robinson argues: (1) Kleypas was wrongly decided because the court\nusurped legislative authority and rewrote K.S.A. 21-4624(e); (2) had Kleypas been\ncorrectly decided, the court would have simply declared the statute unconstitutional as it\ndid in Marsh; (3) had the Kleypas court declared K.S.A. 21-4624(e) unconstitutional,\nthere would have been no death penalty in Kansas; (4) in the absence of a death penalty,\nRobinson would have been sentenced to life in prison with a hard 50-year or hard 25-year\nminimum sentence without parole; and, therefore, (5) we should vacate his death\nsentence and remand for imposition of a life sentence.\n\n\n       It is apparent most, if not all, of Robinson's premises are incorrect. According to\nRobinson, Marsh leads to the conclusion that Kleypas should have declared K.S.A. 21-\n4624(e) unconstitutional. The decision in Kleypas did declare the weighing equation of\nK.S.A. 21-4624(e) unconstitutional.

The historical fact Robinson chooses to ignore is\nthat the United States Supreme Court held the weighing equation as originally drafted by\nthe legislature was constitutional. Marsh, 548 U.S. at 173, 181. Therefore, if Kleypas was\nwrongly decided, and the Supreme Court of the United States says it was, then the correct\n                                            391\n\fdecision in Kleypas would have been to uphold the statute as written. Contrary to\nRobinson's premise that there would have been no death penalty at the time of his trial,\nhis jury would actually have been instructed to impose death if his mitigators did not\noutweigh aggravators, and the State would have had an easier bar to clear.\n\n\n       Accordingly, we find no basis to vacate Robinson's sentence on this asserted error.\n\n\n                          18. CUMULATIVE ERROR—PENALTY PHASE\n\n       Robinson argues the cumulative effect of penalty phase errors requires the\nvacation of his death sentences.\n\n\nLegal Framework and Standard of Review\n\n       \"Cumulative error, considered collectively, may be so great as to require reversal of a\n       defendant's conviction. The test is whether the totality of the circumstances substantially\n       prejudiced the defendant and denied him or her a fair trial.

Nevertheless, the circumstances\nsurrounding his use of and comments regarding the Bible, including the fact that they\nwere isolated, brief, and made after the jurors' vote had revealed they were in unanimous\nagreement as to sentence, combined with the district judge's curative instruction,\nmitigated any prejudice. Likewise, the prosecutor made improper remarks during closing,\nbut those comments were not gross and flagrant and would have had little weight in the\nminds of jurors when considered individually and collectively. In light of the length and\ncomplexity of these proceedings, and the abundant evidence against Robinson on the\naggravating circumstance when compared with the relatively weak evidence in his favor\non mitigation, we hold that the totality of the circumstances did not substantially\nprejudice Robinson or deny him the right to a fair penalty phase proceeding.\n\n\n                   19. DESIGNATION OF ROBINSON AS A SEX OFFENDER\n\n       The district judge sentenced Robinson on January 21, 2003. During the sentencing\nhearing, the State did not argue and the district judge did not find that any of the crimes\nof conviction were sexually motivated. Nevertheless, in the journal entry of judgment, the\ndistrict judge sua sponte designated Robinson's convictions on Counts I, II, and III as\nsexually motivated. Robinson argues that the sexually motivated designation constitutes\nan unlawful variance from the sentence announced from the bench.\n\n\nStandard of Review\n\n       \"Whether a sentence is illegal is a question of law over which this court has\nunlimited review.\" State v.

The caution he exercised and the preventative\nmeasures he employed were well planned and reasonably calculated to mitigate the risk\nof extraneous factors influencing the outcome of the guilt phase and penalty phase\nproceedings. These efforts have facilitated our determination that the sentence of death\nwas not \"imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice or any other arbitrary factor\";\nthat the State's lone aggravating circumstance existed; and that Robinson's mitigating\ncircumstances were insufficient to outweigh it. See K.S.A. 21-4627(c)(2).\n\n\n       In sum, we affirm Robinson's capital murder conviction charged in Count II. We\nreverse his capital murder conviction charged in Count III and his first-degree murder\nconviction charged in Count V as unconstitutionally multiplicitous with the capital\nmurder conviction in Count II.

I write separately to address the\nmajority's holding that the prosecutor's closing argument pertaining to occasions when\nRobinson cried and did not cry during the trial was beyond the scope of the penalty phase\nand served no purpose but to inflame the passion of the jurors and divert their attention\nfrom sentencing. Specifically, I write to emphasize why, in my opinion, any comment\nregarding the demeanor of a nontestifying defendant amounts to improper closing\nargument. Nevertheless, I agree the misconduct in this case was harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt.\n\n\n       Robinson never took the stand during his trial. During the penalty stage of his final\nclosing argument, the prosecutor declared to the jury:\n\n\n               \"When the defendant cried, [he] cried one time during this trial, he didn't cry\n       when there was testimony about Lisa Stasi. He didn't cry when there was testimony about\n       Izabela Lewicka's body was taken out of that barrel. He didn't cry when there was\n       testimony about Suzette Trouten—when her family testified—when her body was taken\n       out of that barrel or Beverly Bonner or Sheila Faith or Debbie Faith. He cried for himself.\n       That says it all. He doesn't care anything about anybody but himself. Manipulation and\n       deceit, they go hand in hand with the defendant throughout these last 20 years.\"\n\n\n       Preliminarily, I address the State's argument that these rebuttal comments were\nproper because they were made in response to defendant's closing argument. That\ncontention is not strongly supported by the record but, even if true, the comments were\nstill improper. See State v.

In essence, the prosecutor made himself an eyewitness and an expert\nwitness who was not subject to the rules of evidence or cross-examination. Of course,\njurors may see a defendant laugh, cry, yawn, stretch, sit without expression, or visit with\ncounsel. From their own observations, jurors may form opinions about a defendant.\nThese observations are a natural consequence of a jury trial; however, a prosecutor\n                                             398\n\fshould not draw attention to these appearances and behaviors—which may have gone\nunnoticed by the jurors—and then pontificate about what these actions mean. See\nNovotny, 297 Kan. at 1189-90 (assuming prosecutor's comment on defendant \"eye-\nballing the witnesses\" was misconduct). Absent an examined explanation from a\ndefendant, it is difficult to know why a defendant would show or not show a certain\nbehavior or emotion during his or her trial.\n\n\n       While I agree with the majority that the prosecutor's closing comments were\nimproper and that the misconduct does not warrant a reversal in this case, my concerns go\nbeyond those expressed by the majority. Commenting on the courtroom demeanor of a\nnontestifying defendant defies the purpose of closing argument, so neither party should\nbe allowed to expressly or implicitly refer to it. Indeed, the only proper comment about\nthe courtroom demeanor of a nontestifying defendant is that the jurors should not\nconsider it in reaching a decision.\n\n                                           ***\n\n\n       JOHNSON, J., dissenting: I agree with the majority's reversal of the capital murder\nconviction under Count III, which included the killing of Izabela Lewicka; but I dissent\nfrom the majority's determination that the State proved capital murder, as the prosecutor\nchose to charge it, in Count II of the complaint. The prosecutor has the duty to prepare a\ncharging document that actually describes a valid crime and then the State must prove all\nof the elements of the charged crime beyond a reasonable doubt. From a legal, factual, or\nlogical viewpoint, one simply cannot say that those duties were fulfilled in this case. This\ncourt should not provide cover for a prosecutor's charging mistakes in any case, much\nless a death penalty case. Accordingly, both capital murder convictions should be set\naside, along with both corresponding sentences of death.\n\n\n\n                                               399\n\f       The majority jumps the rails at the start of its journey by describing the capital\nmurder charges as follows: \"The State charged Robinson with two counts of capital\nmurder, one count for the intentional, premeditated murder of Suzette Marie Trouten\n(Count II) and the other for the intentional, premeditated murder of Izabela Lewicka\n(Count III).\" Slip op. at 18. It then recites that \"the murders of Trouten and Lewicka were\neach part of a common scheme or course of conduct that also included the intentional,\npremeditated murders of Beverly J. Bonner, Sheila Faith, Debbie Faith and Lisa Stasi.\"\nSlip op. at 18. The majority is apparently implying that the defendant was guilty of the\ncapital murder of Trouten and the capital murder of Lewicka and that the murders of the\nfour other women simply served as proof of a common scheme or course of conduct.\nLater, the majority refers to Trouten and Lewicka as the \"principal capital murder\nvictims,\" declaring that their killings completed the elements of capital murder in each\ncount. Slip op. at 237-38. Although the majority's characterization of the capital murder\ncharges comports with a fair reading of the State's complaint, it is not supported by the\nplain language of the capital murder statute. See K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6).\n\n\n       I begin with the statutory definition of the precise crime for which the defendant\nwas purportedly charged, convicted, and sentenced to death. That starting point is critical\nbecause it is a legislative function to define crimes. See State v. Bolin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1184086\"><a href=\"/opinion/1184086/state-v-bolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1184086\"><a href=\"/opinion/1184086/state-v-bolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1968) (\"Generally speaking, of course, it is within the power of the\nlegislature to define what acts shall constitute crimes.\"). Neither an executive branch\nprosecutor, nor a judicial branch appellate court, has the authority to redefine the acts that\nconstitute a legislatively created crime. Here, the relevant part of the applicable statutory\nlanguage states: \"(a) Capital murder is the: . . . (6) intentional and premeditated killing\nof more than one person as a part of the same act or transaction or in two or more acts or\ntransactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or course of\nconduct.\" K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6). Hereafter, I will discuss that statute as it relates to the\n\n\n                                             400\n\fone count of capital murder that the majority affirmed, albeit the discussion would apply\nequally to the manner in which the State charged the other capital murder count.\n\n\n         Given its collective experience discerning the plain language of statutes, what\nshould jump out at the majority is that, first and foremost, the crime requires the State to\nprove \"the killing of more than one person.\" Pointedly, the legislature did not say that\ncapital murder is the killing of one person after having previously killed one or more\nother persons. It did not say that capital murder is the killing of one person as part of a\ncommon scheme or course of conduct involving the killing of others. Rather, the\nlegislature said that the State must prove that the defendant killed at least two persons,\nand the crime-defining statute makes absolutely no qualitative distinction between those\ntwo or more victims. In other words, proof of the intentional, premeditated murder of\neach and every victim is a required essential element of the charged crime of capital\nmurder equal in importance to every other element. As the prosecutor charged Count II,\nthe State's burden to prove that the defendant killed Bonner, the Faiths, and/or Stasi was\nno less (or no more) than its burden to prove defendant killed Trouten. Consequently, the\ndesignation of Trouten as a \"principal capital murder victim\" is a phantom concept,\nmanufactured by the State's charging document and perpetuated here by the majority, but\ntotally devoid of any legal support.\n\n\n         Granted, a complaint \"drawn in the language of the statute[] shall be deemed\nsufficient.\" K.S.A. 22-3201(b). And here, the prosecutor incorporated most of the\nstatutory words into the complaint, albeit not in the same order as set forth in the statute.\nNevertheless, in this case, the most damning aspect of the mischaracterization of capital\nmurder as the killing of one person after engaging in a course of conduct of killing others\nis that it permits the majority to divine a new theory whereby the State is permitted to\nexecute a defendant for a murder that occurred before there was a death penalty in this\nState.\n                                             401\n\f       The rule of law has always been that the district court must sentence a person\nwithin the maximum punishment allowable by the law in effect when that person\ncommitted the crime for which sentence is being imposed. See Cooper v. Werholtz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629160\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629160/cooper-v-werholtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, Syl. ¶ 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2629160\"><a href=\"/opinion/2629160/cooper-v-werholtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1212</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004) (\"Criminal statutes and penalties in effect at the\ntime of the criminal act are controlling.\"). Likewise, as the majority acknowledges, a\nstatute will operate prospectively in the absence of clear language that it is intended to\noperate retroactively, and K.S.A. 21-3439 lacks such clear retroactive language.\nMoreover, the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution \"is aimed at laws\nthat 'retroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal\nacts.'

Here, the majority retroactively alters the\ndefinition of the crimes Robinson committed prior to the July 1, 1994, enactment of\ncapital murder and increases his punishment for those crimes.\n\n\n       In this case, when defendant killed Bonner, the Faiths, and Stasi, the maximum\npenalty for those murders was life in prison. Indeed, in this very case, the district court\nsentenced the defendant to a hard 15 life sentence for the killing of Stasi. But the majority\nvacated that sentence in favor of a death sentence. Given that all of the elements of Stasi's\nintentional, premeditated murder had to be proved in order to fulfill the elements of the\ncapital murder charge, the previously completed intentional, premeditated murder of Stasi\nwas a lesser included offense of the charged capital murder. See K.S.A. 21-3107(2)(b)\n(\"A lesser included crime is: . . . a crime where all elements of the lesser crime are\nidentical to some of the elements of the crime charged.\"). And a person \"may be\nconvicted of either the crime charged or a lesser included crime, but not both.\" K.S.A.\n21-3107(2). But permitting the State to use a predeath penalty murder to fulfill the capital\n                                             402\n\fmurder requirement of two or more killings effectively alters the definition of the prior\nmurders and increases the penalty for the previously completed \"lesser included offense\"\nmurders from life in prison to death.\n\n\n       To rationalize the retroactive application of the death penalty to murders that pre-\ndated the legislative authority to impose that draconian penalty, the majority fashions a\ncompleted-crime theory of prosecution, whereby a murder completed years earlier is\nsubsequently utilized as an element of a capital murder that is \"completed\" after the fact\nby adding a new killing. Pointedly, the majority cites to no Kansas case that has\npermitted such a ploy in any context, much less a capital case. Instead, curiously, the\nmajority points to a statute of limitations statutory provision, K.S.A. 21-3106(6), as direct\nauthority for converting a previously completed crime into an element of a newly\ndefined, more serious crime. The majority's manufactured rationale is flawed.\n\n\n       First, the statutory provision forming the foundation of the majority's theory is a\nsubsection of a statute that is entitled \"Time limitations for commencement of\nprosecutions.\" K.S.A. 21-3106. In other words, the majority's magical provision declaring\nthat an offense is committed when every element occurs is direct authority only when a\ncourt is determining whether the time limit for prosecuting an offense has expired. But\nK.S.A. 21-3106(1) states unequivocally that \"[a] prosecution for murder . . . may be\ncommenced at any time.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, we have no need to ruminate on when\nthe current capital murder was committed for statute of limitation purposes because there\nis no statutory time limitation on prosecuting capital murder. Quite simply, then, K.S.A.\n21-3106(6) is not applicable here.\n\n\n       Perhaps the majority intended to apply the statute of limitations provision by\nanalogy, i.e., as persuasive support for its \"completed crime\" theory of retroactively\nimposing the death sentence. If so, I submit that a statutory provision that is facially more\n                                            403\n\fanalogous to the determination of which crime is applicable is found in K.S.A. 21-\n3102(4), which addressed the scope and application of the Kansas Criminal Code that\nwas effective July 1, 1970. The provision states:\n\n\n               \"This code has no application to crimes committed prior to its effective date. A\n       crime is committed prior to the effective date of the code if any of the essential elements\n       of the crime as then defined occurred before that date. Prosecutions for prior crimes shall\n       be governed, prosecuted and punished under the laws existing at the time such crimes\n       were committed.\" K.S.A. 21-3102(4).\n\n\n       Granted, this court has construed that provision to be applicable only to the\nadoption of the entire new criminal code rather than applying to any subsequent\namendments to crimes within the code. State v. Noah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1292470\"><a href=\"/opinion/1292470/state-v-noah/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1292470\"><a href=\"/opinion/1292470/state-v-noah/\"><span class=\"volume\">788</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1990) (K.S.A. 21-3102[4] refers to crimes committed prior to July 1, 1970, effective\ndate of new criminal code). Nevertheless, it is no less persuasive as to how the law should\nbe applied than the majority's statute of limitations provision. Having completed first-\ndegree premeditated murder before the existence of capital murder, the prosecution for\nthat prior murder should, intuitively as well as logically, be governed under the laws\nexisting at the time such crime was committed. That paradigm comports with the long-\nstanding rule that courts are to impose the punishment that was in effect when the crime\nwas committed and precludes the punishment-increasing gamesmanship displayed here.\n\n\n       Next, even accepting that K.S.A. 21-3106(6) might have something to do with the\nquestion presented to us in this case, it actually confirms that the murders of Bonner, the\nFaiths, and Stasi should be deemed \"committed\" before the adoption of the death penalty.\nEvery element of first-degree premeditated murder had \"occurred\" before the adoption of\ncapital murder. And to the extent that the majority contends that the prior killings had not\nfulfilled their role as its purported \"second element\" of capital murder prior to Trouten's\nmurder, the opinion contradicts itself.\n                                                   404\n\f       The majority describes that \"second element\" as a requirement that \"these killings\nbe part of the same act or transaction or multiple acts or transactions connected together\nor constituting parts of a common scheme or course of conduct.\" Slip op. at 237. But\npreviously, in discussing the sufficiency of the evidence, the majority asserted that there\nwas enough evidence that \"the jurors could have found that all of the murders were\nrelated to one another in some way and therefore part of a common scheme or course of\nconduct.\" (Emphasis added.) Slip op. at 235. If it were true that all of the murders were\nsufficient evidence of the second element, then all of the statutory elements of capital\nmurder had occurred before the defendant killed Trouten. The defendant had killed more\nthan one person as part of the same act or transaction (the Faiths) or as parts of a common\nscheme or course of conduct (Bonner, the Faiths, and Stasi), completing all of the\nstatutory elements of capital murder before it was statutorily enacted. Contrary to the\nmajority's declaration, the murder of Trouten was unnecessary to complete the elements\nof capital murder. Rather, the Trouten murder added nothing to the State's theory of\nprosecution, except to use its occurrence date to invoke the death penalty and thereby\nincrease the punishment for the previously completed crimes. In my view, this is a blatant\nexample of ex post facto jurisprudence.\n\n\n       To bolster its contention that the State can increase the penalty for a completed\nfirst-degree premeditated murder, i.e., after the murder has been \"committed,\" the\nmajority resorts to cases from foreign jurisdictions that are not on point. As the majority\npoints out, the crime involved in State v. Zelinka, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1296883\"><a href=\"/opinion/1296883/state-v-zelinka/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Or.

Slip op. at 237-38. Allowing the previous assaults or torture to occur\nbefore enactment of the murder by abuse statute might have been an analog here if capital\nmurder was defined as the intentional, premeditated murder of one person, after having\n                                            405\n\fpreviously murdered others. But as discussed above, that is not how our statute defines\ncapital murder.\n\n\n       Likewise, the crime involved in People v. Grant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1301864\"><a href=\"/opinion/1301864/people-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1301864\"><a href=\"/opinion/1301864/people-v-grant/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

See Slip op. at 239. Where a statute requires continuous conduct over a\nspecified time period, it makes sense that the crime is not completed until the last act is\ncommitted. But capital murder can occur in one act or transaction, which presumably\nhappened when defendant killed both Sheila and Debbie Faith, thus completing all of the\nelements of the later-to-be-established crime of capital murder.\n\n\n       In that vein, the majority's assertion that \"the last act or event necessary to trigger\napplication of K.S.A. 21-3439(a)(6) was the murder of Trouten\" because she was killed\nafter the enactment of capital murder skews the plain statutory language. Slip op. at 239.\nTo belabor the point, the statute required \"the killing of more than one person,\" not the\nkilling of one person after having killed others. When the prosecutor included the killings\nof Bonner, the Faiths, and Stasi in the complaint, all of the elements of capital murder\nwere effectively pled, without considering the killing of Trouten.\n\n\n       The majority rejects Robinson's proffer of United States v. Husted, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"171395\"><a href=\"/opinion/171395/united-states-v-husted/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(10th Cir. 2008), because the federal act applicable there used the word \"travels\" which\ndid not apply to someone who had previously \"traveled.\" Slip op. at 240. Yet, our capital\nmurder statute suggests the present tense when it defines the crime as \"the killing of more\nthan one person.\" Like Husted, that language does not express an intent to apply to\nsomeone who has \"killed\" prior to the statute's enactment. Rather, to commit capital\nmurder under subsection (a)(6), I submit that the defendant had to kill more than one\n\n\n                                             406\n\fperson after the enactment of the capital murder statute in order to fulfill the\nindispensable initial actus reus of the crime.\n\n\n       Even if one is seduced by the majority's interpretation of the capital murder\nstatute, I contend that my present-tense interpretation is certainly a reasonable reading of\nthe statute. In that circumstance, the rule of lenity \"'requires the court to interpret [the\nstatute's] meaning in favor of the accused.'\" State v.

That tack baffles me, especially given that\nthe State did not need to ask this court to retroactively apply the capital murder statute.\nBoth Trouten and Lewicka were killed after the enactment of the capital murder statute.\nConsequently, the prosecutor could have avoided the need to use preenactment killings to\nsatisfy the \"killing of more than one person\" element of capital murder by simply\ncharging the murders of Trouten and Lewicka in one capital count, i.e., alleging that\nRobinson killed both Trouten and Lewicka as part of a common scheme or course of\nconduct. Then, the killings of Bonner, the Faiths, and Stasi could have been the subject of\n\n                                                     407\n\ffour separate counts of first-degree, premeditated murder without being vulnerable to a\nmultiplicity or double jeopardy challenge. The reason for splitting the death-eligible\nmurders into two separate counts of capital murder is not readily apparent. Obviously, a\ndeath sentence can only be imposed once; the State's drive to obtain two death sentences\naccomplished nothing beyond creating grist for the appeal mill.\n\n\n       In short, if the State is going to kill its own citizens, even those who commit\nheinous and unfathomable acts, it is not unreasonable to require that the State strictly\ncomply with the laws that authorize the imposition of that ultimate punishment. Here, the\nprosecution did not strictly conform with the law, and it is this court's duty to throw a flag\nand call that foul. I would reverse the remaining capital murder conviction and remand\nfor resentencing as a first-degree premeditated murder. That course of action would\npermit the first-degree premeditated murder conviction and accompanying life sentence\nfor Stasi's killing to be affirmed and would permit the defendant to be convicted for\nLewicka's killing, albeit for the lesser included offense of first-degree premeditated\nmurder.\n\n\n       Even if the State could clear the \"killing of more than one person\" hurdle, I believe\nit stumbles in its attempt to tie the Trouten murder to the others to meet the majority's\n\"second element.\" I disagree with the majority's emphasis on the cherry-picked, out-of-\ncontext phrase from State v. Harris, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2586244\"><a href=\"/opinion/2586244/state-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2007), to conclude\nthat the multiple killings only need to \"'be related to one another in some way.'\" Slip op.\nat 232, 233. Nevertheless, even using the majority's liberal concept of nexus, Trouten's\nmurder does not fit. Stasi was apparently murdered for her child, Bonner for her divorce\nmaintenance payments, the Faiths for their Social Security benefit payments, and\nLewicka to clear the way for a former paramour. The majority states no apparent motive\nfor the Trouten killing. I do not believe that it is sufficient for some of the killer's\nmethods to be similar. The killings have to be related to one another, not the killer's\n                                              408\n\fmethods. I do not read the subsection as including serial, but completely separate,\nkillings. Again, I would reverse the remaining capital murder conviction on evidentiary\ngrounds.\n\n\n       Finally, although there are other aspects of the majority opinion with which I take\nexception, I see no reason for further argument here. I do, however, take the liberty of\nusing this platform to echo the sentiments that Justices Breyer and Ginsburg expressed in\ntheir dissent in the recent case of Glossip v. Gross, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">576</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">___, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2812588\"><a href=\"/opinion/2812588/glossip-v-gross/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015) (Breyer, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., dissenting), in which\nthey called for a reexamination of whether the death penalty, in and of itself, constitutes a\nlegally prohibited cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment to the\nUnited States Constitution. 135 S. Ct. at 2756. Notwithstanding the egregious nature of\nthe crimes and the compelling evidence of guilt presented in this particular case, I believe\nit is time for this court to reexamine the constitutionality of the death penalty under § 9 of\nthe Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights, which prohibits the infliction of \"cruel or unusual\npunishment.\"\n\n\n       The Glossip dissent opined that in 1976, when the United States Supreme Court\nupheld the death penalty, \"the Court thought that the constitutional infirmities in the\ndeath penalty could be healed,\" and it \"delegated significant responsibility to the States to\ndevelop procedures that would protect against those constitutional problems.\" 135 S. Ct.\nat 2755 (Breyer, J., dissenting). But \"[a]lmost 40 years of studies, surveys, and\nexperience strongly indicate . . . that this effort has failed.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2755 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). The dissent related that the current administration of the death penalty\n\"involves three fundamental constitutional defects: (1) serious unreliability, (2)\narbitrariness in application, and (3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death\npenalty's penological purpose.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2755-56 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Moreover,\nthe dissent noted that, perhaps as a result of these constitutional defects in the death\n                                              409\n\fpenalty, \"most places within the United States have abandoned its use,\" which makes the\npenalty \"unusual.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2756 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\nCruel—Lack of Reliability\n\n       On the first point, the dissent noted the obvious, i.e., that \"the finality of death\"\nmakes it a qualitatively different punishment that requires a heightened need for\nreliability. 135 S. Ct. at 2756 (Breyer, J., dissenting.) One cannot undo an execution. Yet,\nresearchers have uncovered \"convincing evidence that, in the past three decades, innocent\npeople have been executed,\" as well as striking evidence that the death penalty has been\nwrongly imposed. 135 S. Ct. at 2756 (Breyer, J., dissenting). As of the date of this year's\ndissent in Glossip, \"the number of exonerations in capital cases [had] risen to 115.\" 135\nS. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting). And that only included exonerations in the sense\nthat the defendant was granted \"relief from all legal consequences of a capital conviction\nthrough a decision by a prosecutor, a Governor[,] or a court, after new evidence of the\ndefendant's innocence was discovered.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       Interestingly, \"exonerations occur far more frequently where capital convictions,\nrather than ordinary criminal convictions, are at issue.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). Courts or governors are 130 times more likely to exonerate a defendant\nwhere a death penalty is at issue and 9 times more likely where capital murder, rather\nthan noncapital murder, is at issue. 135 S. Ct. at 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Some\nresearchers have opined that the disparity is at least partially explained by a \"greater\nlikelihood of an initial wrongful conviction\" in a death penalty case, precipitated in part\nbecause capital crimes are typically horrendous murders that generate an \"intense\ncommunity pressure on police, prosecutors, and jurors to secure a conviction.\" 135 S. Ct.\nat 2757 (Breyer, J., dissenting). That pressure increases the probability of a wrongful\nconviction. Moreover, I would add my belief that the intense public pressure\n\n                                              410\n\faccompanying the case on appeal increases the likelihood that a wrongful capital\nconviction will be affirmed by a state Supreme Court.\n\n\n       Granted, there are other factors that explain the inordinate number of death penalty\nexonerations, one of which is the practice of death-qualification of the capital jury, i.e.,\nno one can serve as a juror unless he or she is willing to impose the death penalty.\nResearch has led to the conclusion that \"'[f]or over fifty years, empirical investigation has\ndemonstrated that death qualification skews juries toward guilt and death.'\"135 S. Ct. at\n2758 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Likewise, flawed forensic testimony, such as faulty hair\nanalysis, has been used in a number of capital cases. In light of all of the factors,\n\"researchers estimate that about 4% of those sentenced to death are actually innocent.\"\n135 S. Ct. at 2758 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       If one expands the analysis beyond cases establishing actual innocence, the\ninstances in which the law was not followed in capital cases is breathtaking. \"Between\n1973 and 1995, courts identified prejudicial errors in 68% of the capital cases before\nthem.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2759 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \"In sum, there is significantly more\nresearch-based evidence today indicating that courts sentence to death individuals who\nmay well be actually innocent or whose convictions (in the law's view) do not warrant the\ndeath penalty's application.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2759 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\nCruel—Arbitrariness\n\n       \"The arbitrary imposition of punishment is the antithesis of the rule of law.\" 135 S.\nCt. at 2759 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \"[S]tudies indicate that the factors that most clearly\nought to affect application of the death penalty—namely, comparative egregiousness of\nthe crime—often do not,\" while \"circumstances that ought not to affect application of the\ndeath penalty, such as race, gender, or geography, often do.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2760 (Breyer,\n\n                                               411\n\fJ., dissenting). In other words, \"[t]he research strongly suggests that the death penalty is\nimposed arbitrarily.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2762 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Because the \"imposition\nand implementation of the death penalty seems capricious, random, [and] arbitrary,\" its\nimposition on a defendant would seem to be \"the equivalent of being struck by\nlightning.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \"How then can we reconcile the\ndeath penalty with the demands of a Constitution that first and foremost insists upon a\nrule of law?\" 135 S. Ct. at 2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       Reconciling the death penalty with the rule of law under our Kansas Constitution\nis no less imperative. Like elsewhere, the gatekeeper in this State is the prosecutor, who\nhas unfettered discretion in any capital-eligible case to seek, or to not seek, the death\npenalty. To state the obvious, unfettered discretion is fertile ground for sprouting\narbitrariness. In my view, Kansas is fortunate to have so many competent attorneys who\nare willing to engage in public service as prosecutors. Nevertheless, those popularly\nelected public servants cannot be totally immune to the intense public pressure generated\nby high-profile cases. A system that does not safeguard against such potential\narbitrariness cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.\n\n\nCruel—Excessive Delays\n\n       Ironically, the solutions to the problems of unreliability and unfairness \"almost\ninevitably lead to a third independent constitutional problem: excessively long periods of\ntime that individuals typically spend on death row, alive but under sentence of death.\"\n135 S. Ct. at 2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting). As of last year, the average length of time\nbetween sentencing and execution in the United States was almost 18 years. 135 S. Ct. at\n2764 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Kansas has yet to execute anyone since the 1994 adoption\nof the current capital murder statute, so the average time between sentencing and\nexecution in this State is currently incalculable. Despite this court's recent efforts to\n\n                                              412\n\fimprove the processing of death penalty cases, even when faced with chronic\nunderfunding of the Judicial Branch budget, nothing suggests that Kansas will beat the\nnational average on death penalty delays in the foreseeable future.\n\n\n       The \"lengthy delays create two special constitutional difficulties.\" 135 S. Ct. at\n2765 (Breyer, J., dissenting). The first is the fact that a lengthy delay \"'subjects death row\ninmates to decades of especially severe, dehumanizing conditions of confinement.'\" 135\nS. Ct. at 2765 (Breyer, J., dissenting). \"Indeed, one death row inmate, who was later\nexonerated, still said he would have preferred to die rather than to spend years on death\nrow pursuing his exoneration.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2766 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In Robinson's\ncase, it has been 13 years since he was sentenced to death, and he is still pursuing his\ndirect appeal. After the direct appeal is finally resolved, Robinson has the right to pursue\ncollateral relief in both State and federal courts, which could take years, if not decades.\nRobinson is now 72 years old, making it highly probable that Kansas will face the\nprospect of executing an octogenarian. See Rapaport, A Modest Proposal: The Aged of\nDeath Row Should Be Deemed Too Old To Execute, 77 Brook L. Rev. 1089 (2012).\n\n\n       The second problem is that lengthy delays \"undermine the death penalty's\npenological rationale, perhaps irreparably so.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2767 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\nThe classic rationale for punishment is to secure deterrence, incapacitation, retribution, or\nrehabilitation. Obviously, there is no rehabilitation of an executed person, albeit death\nmost certainly incapacitates that person. But life in prison without possibility of parole is\nno less incapacitating. Accordingly, \"the death penalty's penological rationale in fact rests\nalmost exclusively upon a belief in its tendency to deter and upon its ability to satisfy a\ncommunity's interest in retribution.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2767 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       With respect to deterrence, decades of studies have been unable to establish\nreliable statistical evidence to prove one way or the other whether capital punishment\n                                             413\n\fdeters potential killers. But common sense would dictate that, where a person sentenced\nto death \"is two or three times more likely to find his [or her] sentence overturned or\ncommuted than to be executed,\" and \"has a good chance of dying from natural causes\nbefore any execution (or exoneration) can take place,\" the deterrent effect of a death\npenalty statute would be de minimis. 135 S. Ct. at 2768 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       Likewise, while \"[r]etribution is a valid penological goal,\" one has to question\n\"whether a 'community's sense of retribution' can often find vindication in 'a death that\ncomes,' if at all, 'only several decades after the crime was committed.'\" 135 S. Ct. at 2769\n(Breyer, J., dissenting). Arguably, whatever interest in retribution that might be served by\nthe death penalty can be similarly served by a sentence of life in prison without parole.\n135 S. Ct. at 2769 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Moreover, in that event, one would hope that\nthe victim's family and friends could attain some semblance of closure sooner if they are\nspared decades of death penalty appeals.\n\n\n       In short, \"[t]he upshot is that lengthy delays both aggravate the cruelty of the death\npenalty and undermine its jurisprudential rationale.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2769 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting). And if the death penalty fails to reach the goals of deterrence or retribution,\n\"'it is nothing more than the purposeless and needless imposition of pain and suffering\nand hence an unconstitutional punishment.'\" 135 S. Ct. at 2769-70 (Breyer, J.,\ndissenting).\n\n\n       Granted, some uninformed, chest-pounding death penalty proponents will demand\nthat the delays between sentencing and execution be shortened, if not eliminated. One\nploy would be to seek a time limit on an appellate court's consideration of a death penalty\nappeal. But doing so would only increase the already too high incidence of unreliable and\narbitrary death penalties and \"risk causing procedural harms that also undermine the\ndeath penalty's constitutionality.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2770 (Breyer, J., dissenting). Indeed, one\n                                             414\n\foffender was exonerated by DNA evidence 30 years after his conviction, so that an\nabbreviated or cursory appellate review would have resulted in the execution of an\ninnocent man. 135 S. Ct. at 2770-71 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In other words, the death\npenalty presents a Catch-22 dilemma: to avoid unconstitutionality, a death sentence must\nbe thoroughly and completely examined and reexamined, but the resultant delay renders\nthe punishment unconstitutional. The remedy is to declare the punishment\nunconstitutional.\n\n\nUnusual—Decline in Death Penalty Use\n\n       The Eighth Amendment proscribes punishments that are cruel and unusual,\nwhereas § 9 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights proscribes punishments that are\ncruel or unusual. The Glossip dissent's Eighth Amendment analysis reviews the recent\ndecline in the number of states that are using the death penalty, as well as the decline in\nthe number of executions in those states still using the punishment. In 2014, only seven\nstates carried out an execution, i.e., 86% of the states did not execute anyone last year.\nEven in Texas, which perennially leads the nation in executions, the number decreased\nfrom 40 in the year 2000, to 10 in the year 2013. Consequently, considering the nation as\na whole, \"[i]t seems fair to say that it is now unusual to find capital punishment in the\nUnited States.\" 135 S. Ct. at 2774 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\n\n       I would reiterate what I said in State v. Carr, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Kan.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 327, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2014) (Johnson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), cert. granted in part 135 S.\nCt. 1698 (2015), about giving credence to the Kansas founding fathers' choice to use the\ndisjunctive \"or\" in § 9 of the Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights.
