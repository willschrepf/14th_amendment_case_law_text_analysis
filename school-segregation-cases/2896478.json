See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a), (g), 3559(d),\n3591-3598. On appeal, Mr. Purkey raises myriad challenges to his conviction and\nsentence. After careful review, we conclude that his arguments lack merit and\ntherefore affirm the judgment of the district court.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri.\n\f       Jennifer Long, a sixteen year-old high school sophomore, disappeared in\nJanuary of 1998. On December 15, 1998, while in the Wyandotte County Jail\nawaiting a Kansas state prosecution for the murder of eighty-year-old Mary Ruth\nBales, Mr. Purkey contacted Detective Bill Howard of the Kansas City, Kansas, Police\nDepartment and offered to speak with him about a kidnapping and homicide that had\noccurred earlier that year. Mr. Purkey told Detective Howard that he also wanted to\nspeak with an FBI agent about this crime because he wanted to spend his time in a\nfederal, rather than a state, institution. Detective Howard asked FBI Special Agent\nDirk Tarpley to go with him to meet with Mr. Purkey.\n\n       The next day, Mr. Purkey met with Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley. At\nthe beginning of the meeting, Mr. Purkey executed a form indicating that he\nunderstood and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights. He then told the officers\nthat he was going to plead guilty in the Kansas case and was therefore willing to\nconfess to the kidnapping, rape, and murder of a Missouri woman, provided that he\ncould serve his state time in a federal penitentiary. Detective Howard and Agent\nTarpley informed Mr. Purkey that they could not make any promises but would take\nwhatever he had to say to the United States Attorney. After giving an account of the\nkidnapping, rape, and murder of the victim (who was later identified as Ms. Long),\nMr. Purkey refused to cooperate further unless he received assurances from the United\nStates Attorney that his case would be federally prosecuted.\n\n       That afternoon, Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley met with Kurt Shernuk,\nan Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Kansas. Although he was\nskeptical of Mr. Purkey, Mr. Shernuk indicated that his office might be willing to\nprosecute the case if Mr. Purkey fully cooperated with the investigators and provided\nthe location of the victim's remains and other evidence to corroborate his confession.\n\n      After meeting with Mr. Shernuk, Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley returned\nto the Wyandotte County Jail to speak with Mr. Purkey. They told him that\n\n                                         -2-\n\fMr. Shernuk wanted a body and would require full cooperation, but they did not make\nMr. Purkey any promises as to the sentence that he might receive. Mr. Purkey then\nled Messrs. Tarpley and Howard to the crime scene and to the place where he claimed\nto have discarded the victim's undergarments and jaw bone. He told the officers that\nbecause he had taken extraordinary measures to dispose of the body, including\ndismembering it with a chain saw and burning the remains, the victim's remains were\nnot recoverable.\n\n      More meetings occurred over the next several days. On December 17,\nDetective Howard and Agent Tarpley again met with Mr. Purkey and, after being\nreminded verbally of his constitutional rights, Mr. Purkey gave a detailed handwritten\nconfession. The next day, Detective Howard met with Mr. Purkey and, after\nreminding him of his rights, conducted a photo lineup to see if he could identify the\nvictim. Without hesitation, Mr. Purkey identified Ms. Long. Agent Tarpley met with\nMr. Purkey three days later, and after being advised of his rights, Mr. Purkey\nconfessed again.\n\n       During the guilt phase of his federal trial, Mr. Purkey affirmed his statements\nabout the killing and dismemberment of Ms. Long, but he disavowed his previous\nstatements that he forced Ms. Long to travel with him from Missouri to his home in\nKansas. Instead, he stated that Ms. Long, who he said he thought was a prostitute,\nvoluntarily entered his truck and accompanied him to his home. He indicated that he\nfabricated the kidnapping aspect of the confession to ensure that his actions would be\nconsidered, and therefore prosecuted as, a federal crime. After deliberating briefly,\nthe jury returned a verdict of guilty.\n\n       During the penalty phase of the trial, the defense submitted and the court\ninstructed on twenty-seven mitigating factors. Mr. Purkey's primary mitigation\ndefense consisted of expert testimony indicating that he suffered brain damage that\nresulted in diminished mental capacity. The government presented expert testimony\n\n                                         -3-\n\fto rebut this assertion and also produced evidence in support of six statutory and four\nnon-statutory aggravating factors.\n\n        After deliberating for eleven hours and ten minutes, the jury found the existence\nof all six of the statutory aggravating factors: (1) that the death of Ms. Long occurred\nduring the commission and attempted commission of her kidnapping; (2) that\nMr. Purkey killed Ms. Long in an especially heinous, cruel, and depraved manner in\nthat the killing involved torture and serious physical abuse; (3) that the victim was\nparticularly vulnerable due to her youthful age of sixteen years; (4) that Mr. Purkey\nhad previously been convicted of an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of\nmore than one year, involving the use, attempted use, and threatened use of a firearm\nagainst another person; (5) that Mr. Purkey had previously been convicted of an\noffense resulting in the death of a person for which a sentence of life imprisonment\nwas authorized by statute; and (6) that Mr. Purkey had previously been convicted of\ntwo or more offenses punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year,\ncommitted on different occasions and involving the infliction and attempted infliction\nof serious bodily injury and death upon another person. The jury also found the\nexistence of three of the four non-statutory aggravating factors: (1) that the\ngovernment established loss and harm because of the victim's personal characteristics\nas an individual human being and the impact of the death upon the victim's family; (2)\nthat the defendant had previously killed Mary Ruth Bales in a vicious manner in that\nhe repeatedly struck her in the head with a hammer until she died; and (3) that\nMr. Purkey had a substantial criminal history. The jury did not record any evidence\nof its findings with regard to the mitigating factors. It then determined that\nMr. Purkey should be sentenced to death.\n\n                                       I.\n       We begin with Mr. Purkey's arguments pertaining to the district court's denials\nof his pretrial motions.\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                                           A.\n       Mr. Purkey's primary argument on appeal is that the district court erred in\ndenying his motion to suppress his multiple confessions to the kidnapping, rape, and\nmurder of Ms. Long. He argues that the district court should have suppressed his\nstatements to Messrs. Tarpley and Howard because the statements were involuntary\nand therefore obtained in violation of the fifth amendment to the Constitution. He\nbases this argument on his assertion that the officers obtained the confessions through\na false promise, cf. United States v. Pierce, 152 F.3d 808, 812-13 (8th Cir. 1998),\nnamely, that if he cooperated with the government he would receive a life sentence in\na federal institution. As an alternative to suppression, Mr. Purkey moved to prohibit\nthe government from pursuing the death penalty. The district court also denied that\nmotion.\n\n       The core of Mr. Purkey's argument is that Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley\nprocured his confession by indicating that the Assistant United States Attorney had\naccepted Mr. Purkey's alleged quid pro quo offer, that is, that Mr. Purkey would\nconfess to the crime and provide full cooperation in return for a life sentence in a\nfederal institution. Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley testified at the suppression\nhearing that they never made this representation to Mr. Purkey. The district court,\nadopting the discussion and conclusions in the report and recommendation of a\nmagistrate judge,2 squarely rejected Mr. Purkey's version of the events. It found that,\n\"[d]uring all of the time the officers spent with Purkey on December 16, 1998, there\nwere no hints or suggestions made to Purkey ... that Purkey would get a life sentence\nif he confessed. No one told Purkey that a life sentence would be recommended if he\nconfessed.\" The court inserted a footnote within this language to make explicit that\nit found \"the testimony of Special Agent Tarpley and Detective Howard more credible\nthan that of defendant Purkey\" on the issue of whether Messrs. Tarpley and Howard\n\n\n      2\n        The Honorable Sarah W. Hays, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Missouri.\n                                         -5-\n\ftold Mr. Purkey that the Assistant United States Attorney had agreed to give\nMr. Purkey a life sentence in the federal system in exchange for a full confession.\nFinally, the court concluded that during the course of the investigation, \"[n]o promises\nwere made to defendant Purkey in exchange for his confessions. While the defendant\nwas apparently surprised to find out that the death penalty was a potential sentence he\nmight receive, the officers did not mislead [the] defendant into believing that there\nwas no federal death penalty.\"\n\n       Because Mr. Purkey's challenges are to the district court's conclusions regarding\nthe facts underlying its decisions to deny his motions, we review the matter for clear\nerror. See United States v. Kilgore, 58 F.3d 350, 353 (8th Cir. 1995); see also United\nStates v. Heath, 58 F.3d 1271, 1275 (8th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 892 (1995).\nAfter a thorough review of the record, we cannot conclude that the district court\nclearly erred in arriving at the credibility determinations and factual conclusions that\nit reached. We therefore affirm the district court's denial of Mr. Purkey's motion to\nsuppress his statements and his motion to prohibit the government from seeking the\ndeath penalty.\n\n                                          B.\n       Mr. Purkey also maintains that the district court erred when it denied his motion\nto dismiss based on the alleged destruction of notes that Mr. Purkey asserts that he\ntook to document his conversations with Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley in\nDecember of 1998. Mr. Purkey testified that these notes were destroyed by prison\nstaff during a \"shakedown\" of his segregation pod while he was incarcerated at\nCCA(Corrections Corporation of America)-Leavenworth. He asserts that the\ndestruction of these notes constitutes a denial of due process and requires dismissal\nof the indictment.\n\n      In United States v. Malbrough, 922 F.2d 458 (8th Cir. 1990), cert. denied,\n501 U.S. 1258 (1991), we recognized that the \"Supreme Court has held that the state's\n\n                                          -6-\n\ffailure to preserve evidence does not constitute a denial of due process unless ...\ncomparable exculpatory evidence was not reasonably available to the defendant.\" Id.\nat 463 (citing California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479, 488-89 (1984)). The district\ncourt, adopting the discussion and conclusions of the magistrate judge, concluded that\nMr. Purkey's motion must fail because, among other shortcomings, Mr. Purkey could\nnot demonstrate that he was unable to obtain comparable exculpatory evidence by\nother means. We review the matter to determine whether this conclusion was clearly\nerroneous, cf. United States v. Weise, 89 F.3d 502, 504 (8th Cir. 1996), and we\nconclude that it was not.\n\n         At best, these notes can be characterized as Mr. Purkey's account of his\nconversations with Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley. They were neither\ntranscripts of the conversations nor were they attested to by Messrs. Howard or\nTarpley. They were simply Mr. Purkey's recollections of the conversations as\nrecorded shortly after each conversation concluded. Mr. Purkey had ample\nopportunity to introduce comparable evidence in the form of his own testimony as to\nthe substance of the conversations. And, although these notes could have been read\ninto evidence to fill gaps in Mr. Purkey's recollection as to the content of those\nconversations, see Fed. R. Evid. 803(5), Mr. Purkey's own testimony belied his\nassertion of an incomplete recollection of the conversations. We can find no clear\nerror in the magistrate judge's observation that, \"Despite Purkey's contention that he\nneeds these notes to assist him with remembering the details of the interrogations,\nPurkey's testimony would suggest that he has no trouble remembering [those] details\n... (at least until defense counsel reminded him that he should not remember).\" Hence\nthe district court did not err in denying Mr. Purkey's motion to dismiss based on the\nalleged destruction of his notes.\n\n                                         C.\n     Mr. Purkey also argues that the district court erred in denying his pretrial\nmotion asking the court to prohibit the government from seeking the death penalty\n\n                                         -7-\n\fbecause of two violations of the fifth amendment's indictment clause. First,\nMr. Purkey asserts that the Federal Death Penalty Act (FDPA), 18 U.S.C. § 3591-\n3598, is facially unconstitutional because it vests the prosecution with unilateral\nauthority to seek the death penalty without ever taking the matter of whether the death\npenalty is justified to the grand jury, see 18 U.S.C. § 3593(a). Second, he argues that\nhis prosecution ran afoul of the indictment clause because the government failed to\nseek an indictment upon some of the necessary elements of the capital prosecution,\nnamely, the government's non-statutory aggravating factors and the issue of whether\nthe aggravating factors sufficiently outweighed any mitigating factors to justify a\nsentence of death. Both of these are questions of law, and we therefore review them\nde novo. See United States v. Koons, 300 F.3d 985, 990 (8th Cir. 2002); cf. United\nStates v. Roy, 408 F.3d 484, 491 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n       In United States v. Allen, 406 F.3d 940, 949 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc), we\naddressed the same facial challenge that Mr. Purkey now presents. There we\nrecognized that the FDPA does vest the prosecution with authority to charge\naggravating factors in a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, and does not\nspecifically require the government to bring those factors before the grand jury for\ninclusion in the indictment. But because \"nothing in the Act precludes the\ngovernment from also submitting them to the grand jury for inclusion in the\nindictment,\" we rejected the contention that the FDPA was unconstitutional. Id.\nTherefore, Mr. Purkey's facial challenge also fails.\n\n       To deal with Mr. Purkey's second challenge, we begin with a bit of background.\nUnder the FDPA, once the jury finds the defendant guilty of one of the offenses listed\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3591, the trial proceeds to a separate phase – the sentencing or penalty\nphase. In a homicide case, the jury must make three determinations in this latter phase\nbefore it can impose the death penalty: First it must find, unanimously and beyond\na reasonable doubt, that the defendant acted with the requisite mens rea. See\n18 U.S.C. § 3591(a)(2). Second, again unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\n                                         -8-\n\fit must find the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor. See 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 3592(c), 3593(d). If the above two requirements are satisfied, the jury must then\ndetermine whether the aggravating factors, both statutory and non-statutory,\n\"sufficiently outweigh\" the mitigating factors presented by the defendant to justify a\ndeath sentence, \"or, in the absence of a mitigating factor, whether the aggravating\nfactor or factors alone are sufficient to justify\" that sentence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e).\n\n       Mr. Purkey maintains that because the jury is required to take this third step\nbefore it may impose a sentence of death, the necessary elements for a capital\nprosecution under the FDPA include all aggravating factors, including non-statutory\naggravating factors, and the weighing of aggravating factors versus mitigating factors.\nHe therefore contends that because his superseding indictment did not include non-\nstatutory aggravating factors or a determination that there exists probable cause to\nbelieve that aggravating factors sufficiently outweigh mitigating factors so as to\njustify a sentence of death, it falls short of what the fifth amendment requires. We\ndisagree.\n\n       \"[T]he same facts that the Sixth Amendment requires to be proven to the petit\njury beyond a reasonable doubt in state and federal prosecutions must also be found\nby the grand jury and charged in the indictment in federal prosecutions.\" Allen,\n406 F.3d at 943. For that reason, Allen held that to comport with the fifth amendment\n\"at least one statutory aggravating factor and the mens rea requirement [must] be\nfound by the grand jury and charged in the indictment\" in a prosecution under the\nFDPA. Id. Mr. Purkey's superseding indictment satisfies both of these requirements.\n\n       The indictment must charge at least one of the statutory aggravating factors that\nis ultimately found by the petit jury because \"that is what is required to elevate the\navailable statutory maximum sentence from life imprisonment to death.\" Id. In other\nwords, including that factor in the indictment is required to make the defendant\neligible for the death penalty. See United States v. Higgs, 353 F.3d 281, 299 (4th Cir.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f2003), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 608 (2004). We now make clear what Allen merely\nimplied: \"There is no requirement that the indictment allege all of the factors that\nmight be weighed by the jury when deciding whether to impose a death sentence.\"\nHiggs, 353 F.3d at 299. Non-statutory aggravating factors do not increase the\nmaximum punishment to which a defendant is subject. They are neither sufficient nor\nnecessary under the FDPA for a sentence of death. Their purpose is merely to aid the\nsentencer \"in selecting the appropriate sentence from the available options,\" id. at 298,\n\" 'on the basis of the character of the [defendant] and the circumstances of the crime,'\n\" id. (quoting Tuilaepa v. California, 512 U.S. 967, 972 (1994)).\n\n        Further, it makes no sense to speak of the weighing process mandated by\n18 U.S.C. § 3593(e) as an elemental fact for which a grand jury must find probable\ncause. In the words of the statute, it is a \"consideration,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e), – that\nis, the lens through which the jury must focus the facts that it has found to produce an\nindividualized determination regarding \"whether the defendant should be sentenced\nto death, to life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other lesser\nsentence.\" Id.\n\n       We thus conclude that Mr. Purkey's arguments based on the indictment clause\nof the fifth amendment are without merit.\n\n                                            II.\n        Mr. Purkey next challenges the district court's for-cause exclusion of three\npotential jurors who expressed reluctance to impose the death penalty. In Wainwright\nv. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 420, 424 (1985), the Supreme Court instructed that a potential\njuror may be excluded for cause based on his or her views on capital punishment only\nif those views would \" ' prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties\nas a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath. ' \" (quoting Adams v. Texas,\n448 U.S. 38, 45 (1980)). We review a district court's removal of death-scrupled\nvenirepersons for an abuse of discretion. See United States v. Nelson, 347 F.3d 701,\n710-11 (8th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 486 (2004); United States v. Ortiz,\n                                          -10-\n\f315 F.3d 873, 888 (8th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1042 & 540 U.S. 1073\n(2003).\n\n       Mr. Purkey first asks us to find error in the district court's removal of Margaret\nFox. He begins by inviting us to adopt the holding of the Tenth Circuit in United\nStates v. Chanthadara, 230 F.3d 1237, 1270 (10th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S.\n992 (2001), and review Ms. Fox's removal de novo because the court struck her solely\non the basis of her answers to a questionnaire. We do not agree, however, with\nChanthadara's implicit assumption that a district court's decision on the qualifications\nof a juror is entitled to deference only because of that court's superior position to\nassess a potential juror's demeanor and credibility. See id. at 1269-70. Other reasons,\nsuch as respect for the trial process, \"the expertise developed by trial judges,\" and the\ndesire to conserve judicial resources also underpin the fundamental principle that\n\"appellate courts are not to decide factual questions de novo, reversing any findings\nthey would have made differently.\" Maine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 145 (1986); cf.\nAnderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574-76 (1985); Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a).\nAccordingly, we decline this invitation to stray from the standard of review\nestablished in our previous cases, which is whether the district court abused its\ndiscretion.\n\n       The district court did not abuse its discretion by striking Ms. Fox. She\nrepeatedly indicated on the questionnaire that she had serious reservations about\ncapital punishment. When asked in question thirty-eight of the questionnaire to\ndescribe her feelings about the death penalty, how strong those feelings were, and how\nlong she had held them, she wrote, \"Within the last 50 years I've gained stronger and\nstronger feelings against [the] use of the death penalty. I believe major criminals\nshould be punished, but taking away their lives should be left to God.\" Her responses\nto questions thirty-six and thirty-seven, which asked about the effect that exposure to\nbooks, articles, and movies about the death penalty had on her, also indicate that she\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f\"questioned that the death penalty should be used\" and \"question[ed] the right of the\ncourts to administer the death penalty.\"\n\n      Question thirty-nine, a multiple choice question, gave each juror an opportunity\nto mark the choice that best described his or her feelings about the death penalty.\nThree of the eight choices pertained to people with some degree of opposition to the\ndeath penalty. They were as follows:\n\n             a. I am opposed to the death penalty, and I will never vote\n             to impose the death penalty in any case, no matter what the\n             facts.\n\n             b. I am opposed to the death penalty, and I would have a\n             difficult time voting to impose the death penalty.\n\n             c. I am opposed to the death penalty, but could vote to\n             impose the death penalty if I believed that the death penalty\n             was called for in light of the facts and law in the case.\n\nMs. Fox declined to indicate that she could vote to impose the death penalty by\nselecting choice \"c\" and instead chose the ambiguous \"b.\" When we consider this\nresponse together with her other answers regarding her views on the death penalty, we\nfind sufficient evidence in the record from which the district court could conclude that\nher views on the death penalty would \" 'substantially impair the performance of her\nduties as a juror in accordance with h[er] instructions and h[er] oath.' \" Wainwright,\n469 U.S. at 424 (quoting Adams, 448 U.S. at 45).\n\n      Mr. Purkey also argues that the court erroneously struck Willie Randle after\nmishearing or incorrectly recollecting his responses during voir dire. During voir dire,\nthe government asked Mr. Randle whether he would \"hold the government to a higher\n\n                                         -12-\n\fburden of proof than what is required under the law.\" He responded, \"I think I\nwould.\" When the government next asked whether he would hold it to a higher\nburden of proof than \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" he replied, \"It has to be proof\nwithout a reasonable doubt.\" Later, in granting the government's request to strike\nMr. Randle, the district judge declared, \"My recollection is that he's holding the\ngovernment to a higher standard than the law provides.\"\n\n        Reviewing the cold record, it is difficult to divine exactly what Mr. Randle\nmeant when he replied that \"[i]t has to be proof without a reasonable doubt.\" Although\nthose words of the transcript, taken literally, may indicate that Mr. Randle had agreed\nto apply a burden equivalent to the one that the law actually imposes, the transcript\ncannot provide any insight regarding Mr. Randle's intent in using the phrase \"without\na reasonable doubt\" instead of \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" This is why the Supreme\nCourt instructed in Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 426, that \"deference must be paid to the\ntrial judge who sees and hears the juror.\" The trial judge, who had the opportunity to\nobserve the exchange, could have reasonably interpreted Mr. Randle's refusal to parrot\nthe words of the government and instead use the phrase \"without a reasonable doubt\"\nas an affirmation of his earlier statement that he would hold the government to a\nhigher burden of proof than the law provides. Based on the colloquy between Mr.\nRandle and the government, as well as the court's stated reason for its ruling, we\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by striking this potential\njuror.\n\n       Finally, Mr. Purkey argues that the district court erred when it removed Gary\nDanford for cause after he had been \"rehabilitated.\" When questioned by the\ngovernment, Mr. Danford insisted that he would hold the government to a higher\nburden of proof than reasonable doubt. But Mr. Danford reversed course under\nsubsequent questioning by Mr. Purkey's counsel and indicated that he would \"follow\nthe law.\" The district court concluded that, \"I think he has kind of made up his mind\nwhat the standard is and that the standard he has decided upon is something different\n\n                                         -13-\n\fthan what the law provides.\" Quite simply, the district court made a reasonable\njudgment based on its impression of Mr. Danford's credibility as was its prerogative.\nSee Nelson, 347 F.3d at 710-11; United States v. Moore, 149 F.3d 773, 779-80 (8th\nCir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1030 & 1082 (1998). The record lacks adequate\ngrounds for us to conclude that the district court abused its discretion.\n\n                                         III.\n      Mr. Purkey also maintains that the district court erred in several respects during\nthe guilt phase of his trial.\n\n                                           A.\n       We begin with Mr. Purkey's contention that the district court erred by refusing\nto allow certain evidence during the guilt phase of the trial. He asserts that the district\ncourt erred in the following ways: by excluding the testimony of defense expert\nDr. David Preston; by refusing to allow Mr. Purkey to testify about how his father had\nintroduced him to prostitutes at an early age; and by refusing to permit cross-\nexamination of Michael Speakman regarding his misconduct while he was\nincarcerated at CCA-Leavenworth. \"We review de novo the district court's\ninterpretation and application of the rules of evidence, and review for an abuse of\ndiscretion the factual findings supporting its evidentiary ruling.\" United States v.\nSmith, 383 F.3d 700, 706 (8th Cir. 2004). We may affirm on any ground supported\nby the record, even if that ground was not relied on by the district court. See Bilal v.\nLockhart, 993 F.2d 643, 645 (8th Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 924 (1993).\n\n        Dr. Preston, a nuclear medicine specialist, conducted positron emission\ntopography and magnetic resonance imaging testing upon Mr. Purkey and would have\ntestified that those tests revealed abnormalities within Mr. Purkey's brain. Mr. Purkey\nintended to offer this testimony during the guilt phase of the trial to support both his\ncontention that he did not intentionally kidnap Ms. Long (because he thought she was\na prostitute and/or voluntarily accompanied him to his home) and to illuminate\n\n                                           -14-\n\fMr. Purkey's state of mind when he confessed to Detective Howard and Agent\nTarpley. The district court concluded that \"although Dr. Preston is qualified in the\nfield of nuclear medicine, he is not qualified to testify regarding defendant's state of\nmind and actions at the time of the offenses or at the time that Mr. Purkey gave his\nstatements to the investigators.\"\n\n       We believe that the district court's conclusion was correct. Although we harbor\nno doubt that Dr. Preston was qualified to testify regarding the results of the tests that\nhe conducted on Mr. Purkey, there is nothing in the record that indicates that he was\nqualified to connect that testimony to the inquiry for which it was offered, namely,\nMr. Purkey's state of mind and actions either at the time of the offenses or when he\ngave his statements to the investigators. Indeed, in neither the expert report nor the\noffer of proof did Dr. Preston even attempt to tie the test results to Mr. Purkey's state\nof mind on the specific occasions in question. When questioned by the government,\nmoreover, Dr. Preston admitted that the images produced by the tests could not predict\nbehavior and did not have a causal relationship to criminal behavior. There is\nmanifestly no error in the district court's decision to exclude Dr. Preston's testimony.\n\n       Mr. Purkey also argues that the court erred when it refused, in the guilt phase\nof the trial, to allow him to testify that his father had introduced him to the use of\nprostitutes during his boyhood. (The court did permit some testimony of this nature\nin the penalty phase.) Mr. Purkey submits that this testimony would have provided\nthe jury with context to understand why he might have mistakenly believed that\nMs. Long was a prostitute. This, he argues, would have bolstered his defense that he\ndid not kidnap Ms. Long and that she willingly entered his car and traveled with him\nfrom Missouri to Kansas. And, defense counsel argues, if the jury believed that\nMr. Purkey did not transport Ms. Long across state lines against her will and did not\ndo so with the intent to rape her, it could not have convicted him of kidnapping. But\nwe fail to see how the method by which Mr. Purkey was introduced to prostitutes\nmore than thirty years before his crime is relevant to explaining why he mistook a\n\n                                          -15-\n\fteenage schoolgirl for a prostitute, and we therefore uphold the district court's decision\nto exclude the testimony.\n\n      Mr. Purkey also argues that the district court erred by refusing to permit him to\ncross-examine Michael Speakman regarding Mr. Speakman's uncharged misconduct\nwhile at CCA-Leavenworth. Mr. Purkey wanted to elicit this testimony to\ndemonstrate that a desire to avoid punishment for these uncharged acts might have\nmotivated Mr. Speakman to provide information and testimony for the prosecution.\nHe asserts that this denial deprived him of his sixth amendment right to confront an\nadverse witness.\n\n       Mr. Purkey calls our attention to the Supreme Court's language in Davis v.\nAlaska, 415 U.S. 308, 316-17 (1974), which recognizes that \"the exposure of a\nwitness' motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the\nconstitutionally protected right of cross-examination.” Id. at 316-17. But this passage\ndoes not suggest that a judge should be prevented from imposing limits of any sort on\ndefense counsel's inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness. Delaware\nv. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986). \"On the contrary, trial judges retain wide\nlatitude ... to impose reasonable limits on such cross-examination based on concerns\nabout, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness'\nsafety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.\" Id. We will not\nreverse a trial court's decision to limit cross-examination absent a \"clear abuse of\ndiscretion and a showing of prejudice to [the] defendant.\" United States v. Love,\n329 F.3d 981, 984 (8th Cir. 2003).\n\n      Mr. Purkey has failed to demonstrate a violation of the confrontation clause.\nTo do so, he must show that a reasonable jury might have received a different\nimpression of the witness's credibility had Mr. Purkey's counsel been permitted to\npursue his proposed line of cross-examination. See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 680;\nUnited States v. Drapeau, 414 F.3d 869, 875-76 (8th Cir. 2005). Here, Mr. Purkey's\n\n                                          -16-\n\fcounsel conclusively demonstrated by other means that Mr. Speakman was driven to\ntestify by a desire for leniency. Mr. Speakman's testimony established that the\ngovernment had filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35,\nrequesting a reduction of Mr. Speakman's sentence. Mr. Purkey's counsel asked\nMr. Speakman, \"Basically what you're trying to do is do your best to get a reduction\nto your sentence?\" Mr. Speakman replied, \"I'd be lying if I said I was sitting here\nbeing a good citizen.\" Mr. Purkey's counsel then asked, \"Your sole point in being\nhere is to reduce the sentence that you received?\" Mr. Speakman replied, \"Yes,\nma'am.\" We have difficulty imagining how further testimony could have shown more\ndefinitively that a desire for leniency played a significant part in Mr. Speakman's\nwillingness to testify. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\nlimiting cross-examination that would have further established that point.\n\n\n                                           B.\n       Mr. Purkey also submits that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on\nthe elements contained in the kidnapping statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 1201. That statute\nprovides that a person commits the offense of kidnapping if he or she \"unlawfully\nseizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for\nransom or reward or otherwise any person ... when – (1) the person is willfully\ntransported in interstate or foreign commerce.\" Id. This statute quite clearly requires\nthat the government prove that Mr. Purkey seized Ms. Long \"for ransom or reward or\notherwise,\" id., which in this case was for the purpose of forcible rape. Mr. Purkey,\nhowever, contends that the statute also requires that the government prove that he\ntransported Ms. Long across state lines for that same reason. He bases this contention\non the language of the statute that requires the defendant to have \"willfully\ntransported,\" id., his or her victim. He submits that this phrase requires that the\nkidnapper transport his or her victim with the intent to do something that the law\nforbids. Cf. United States v. Gabaldon, 389 F.3d 1090, 1094-95 n.1 (10th Cir. 2004),\ncert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 1688 (2005). He therefore maintains that the district court\nerred by failing to give an instruction that required the government to prove not only\n\n                                          -17-\n\fthat he seized the victim for the purpose of forcible rape but also that he transported\nher across the state line for the purpose of forcible rape. This error is significant,\naccording to Mr. Purkey, because he argued as part of his defense that he transported\nMs. Long from Missouri to Kansas without the intent to rape. We will affirm if the\ninstructions correctly stated the law and fairly and adequately submitted the issues to\nthe jury. Cf. United States v. Kehoe, 310 F.3d 579, 593 (8th Cir. 2002), cert. denied,\n538 U.S. 1048 (2003).\n\n\n       The district court instructed the jury that in order to convict it had to find that\n\"the defendant unlawfully seized, confined, kidnapped, abducted, carried away or held\nJennifer Long;\" that \"the defendant did so for the purpose of the forcible rape of\nJennifer Long;\" that \"the defendant willfully, knowingly, and unlawfully transported\nJennifer Long across the state line from Missouri to Kansas;\" and that \"Jennifer Long\ndied as a result of defendant's actions.\" This instruction precisely tracked the statute's\nordering of the elements. See 18 U.S.C. § 1201. And, although the Eighth Circuit\nManual of Model Jury Instructions (Criminal) (2005) does not contain a recommended\ninstruction on kidnapping, the instruction given by the district court is consistent with\nthe recommended instructions for the Ninth and Eleventh Circuit, see Ninth Circuit\nManual of Model Jury Instructions (Criminal) § 8.95 (2003 ed.); Eleventh Circuit\nPattern Jury Instructions (Criminal) 49 (2003 ed.), as well as the instruction\nrecommended by the Federal Judicial Center, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions § 84.\nCf. Eighth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions (Criminal) 12.07A. We disagree\nwith Mr. Purkey's construction of the statute and therefore find no error in the district\ncourt's instruction on the elements contained in § 1201.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f                                            C.\n        In his last contention of error with respect to the guilt phase of his trial,\nMr. Purkey maintains that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct. He asserts that the government's efforts to call\nattention to his tattoos that depicted, among other things, a Nazi swastika and symbols\nof the Aryan Brotherhood unfairly inflamed the jury and deprived him of his right to\na fair trial.\n\n\n       During the government's direct examination of its first witness, it displayed a\npicture of Mr. Purkey standing shirtless with his tattoos visible. Due to a\nmisunderstanding between the prosecution and the defense, Mr. Purkey's counsel did\nnot have a chance to object before the government displayed the picture to the jury.\nMr. Purkey's counsel then objected to the picture's admission into evidence and that\nobjection was sustained. Three days later, during the government's cross-examination\nof Mr. Purkey, the government again highlighted the tattoos. The prosecutor asked\nMr. Purkey whether Ms. Long observed his tattoos, including the \"Nazi swastika\"\ntattoo, when she entered his vehicle or while she was, according to Mr. Purkey,\nvoluntarily kissing him while he had his shirt off. The government stated that it made\nthis inquiry to demonstrate the unreasonableness of Mr. Purkey's testimony that\nMs. Long voluntarily accompanied him to his home and consented to engaging in\nforeplay with him. When defense counsel objected to this question, the district court\nsustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the government's questions\nabout Mr. Purkey's tattoos. The defense then asked the judge to declare a mistrial\nbased on the prosecution's referring to the tattoos after the district court had previously\nsustained the objection regarding the picture showing the tattoos. The district court\ndenied that request.\n\n\n      \"The test for reversible prosecutorial misconduct has two parts: (1) the\nprosecutor's remarks or conduct must in fact have been improper, and (2) such\n\n                                           -19-\n\fremarks or conduct must have prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights\nso as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\" United States v. Hernandez, 779 F.2d\n456, 458 (8th Cir.1985). Even assuming arguendo that the prosecutor's actions and\nquestions were improper, these actions nevertheless fail to constitute reversible error.\nWhen determining whether the prosecutor's remarks and conduct so infected the trial\nwith unfairness that it deprived the defendant of a fair trial, we usually consider three\ncriteria: \"(1) the cumulative effect of such misconduct; (2) the strength of the properly\nadmitted evidence of the defendant's guilt; and (3) the curative actions taken by the\ntrial court.\" Hernandez, 779 F.2d at 460. Here the cumulative effect of the\nprosecutor's references to Mr. Purkey's tattoos was not significant. Although we do\nnot doubt that references of this sort can sometimes result in prejudice, the prosecution\nreferred to Mr. Purkey's tattoos only twice, cf. id., and only briefly at that. There was\nalso considerable evidence of guilt. Although he gave a somewhat different story at\ntrial, there was evidence that Mr. Purkey had confessed to the crime on multiple\noccasions. Finally, the district court took prompt curative action. It sustained the\nobjections to the admission of the picture and to the questions regarding Mr. Purkey's\ntattoos. After sustaining the latter objection, the court also instructed the jury to\ndisregard the questions. Cf. United States v. Uphoff, 232 F.3d 624, 625-26 (8th Cir.\n2000). We therefore reject Mr. Purkey's contention that his assertions of prosecutorial\nmisconduct warrant reversal.\n\n\n                                          IV.\n\n       We move now to Mr. Purkey's assignments of error regarding the penalty phase\nof his trial.\n                                           A.\n      Mr. Purkey makes several arguments relating to the district court's evidentiary\nrulings. He asserts that the district court erred in the following ways: by refusing to\npermit evidence that his wife had poisoned him; by excluding the testimony of\nDr. Mark Cunningham regarding Mr. Purkey's alleged fetal alcohol exposure; by\n\n                                          -20-\n\frefusing to permit the surrebuttal testimony of Dr. Stephen Peterson in response to the\ntestimony of Dr. Helen Mayberg; by limiting the impeachment of Dr. Park Dietz; and\nby allowing the government to question Dr. Peterson regarding his views on the death\npenalty.\n\n\n       \"The Federal Death Penalty Act (FDPA) erects very low barriers to the\nadmission of evidence at capital sentencing hearings.\" United States v. Lee, 274 F.3d\n485, 494 (8th Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1000 (2002). In the sentencing phase,\n\"[i]nformation is admissible regardless of its admissibility under the rules governing\nadmission of evidence at criminal trials.\" See 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c). One reason for\nthis more lenient standard is that it affords the defendant additional opportunities to\npresent mitigating evidence consistent with the Supreme Court's directive that to meet\nconstitutional requirements in capital cases \" 'the sentencer ... not be precluded from\nconsidering, as a mitigating factor, any aspect of a defendant's character or record and\nany circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence\nless than death.' \" Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110 (1982) (quoting Lockett\nv. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion)) (emphasis omitted).\n\n\n       But this does not mean that the defense has carte blanche to introduce any and\nall evidence that it wishes. The trial court retains its traditional authority \"to exclude,\nas irrelevant, evidence not bearing on the defendant's character, prior record, or the\ncircumstances of his offense.\" Lockett, 438 U.S. at 604 n.12 (plurality opinion). The\nFDPA, moreover, invests the judge with the authority to exclude probative\ninformation during the penalty phase if \"its probative value is outweighed by the\ndanger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury.\"\n18 U.S.C. § 3593(c). We review the record to determine whether the district judge\nabused the discretion entrusted to him by the FDPA, see United States v. Johnson,\n223 F.3d 665, 674 (7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 829 (2001); United States\nv. Hall, 152 F.3d 381, 397 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1117 (1999),\n\n                                           -21-\n\fabrogated on other grounds in United States v. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. 304, 310-\n14 (2000), and we determine de novo the question of whether Mr. Purkey's\nconstitutional rights have been violated. See United States v. Washington, 318 F.3d\n845, 854-55 (8th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 884 & 899 (2003). Even if we\nconclude that the district court erred, we cannot reverse or vacate a federal death\nsentence on account of an error that is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See\n18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2); Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 402-05 (1999).\n\n\n       Mr. Purkey contends that the district court erred by refusing to allow evidence\nthat his wife, Jeanette Purkey, had poisoned him. Mr. Purkey wished to use this\nevidence to demonstrate that because he was operating under the influence of poison\nwhen he murdered the elderly Kansas woman or when he killed Ms. Long, his actions\ntook place while he was involuntarily intoxicated or, at the very least, in an altered\nmental state. When he sought to introduce the evidence in the penalty phase (he also\nsought to introduce this evidence in the guilt phase), he had no evidence that the\npoison he allegedly received, rat poison, had any known effect on the mind. Also, his\nwife's testimony as to whether she had poisoned him during the relevant time period\nwas equivocal at best. During the penalty phase, the government objected to the\nevidence, asserting that for both of the above reasons the presentation of this evidence\nwas not relevant and would be a \"big diversion\" for the jury. The district court\nagreed.\n\n\n      We cannot say that the district court erred in excluding this evidence. The\ndefense admitted that it had no evidence that rat poison has any psychological effects.\nTherefore, this evidence could not have had any probative value to suggest that\nMr. Purkey's mind was operating under the poison's supposed influence when he\ncommitted either of the two murders. A reasonable judge could conclude that this\nevidence was both completely irrelevant to the purpose for which it was offered, cf.\nLockett, 438 U.S. at 604 n.12 (plurality opinion), and, because of the scandalous and\n\n                                         -22-\n\fperplexing nature of the claim, had significant potential to confuse or mislead the jury.\nCf. 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).\n\n\n       Mr. Purkey also asserts on appeal that this evidence also demonstrates his\ndifficult home life. Because he did not argue this below, we review for plain error,\nsee Lee, 274 F.3d at 493; United States v. Turner, 104 F.3d 217, 221 (8th Cir. 1997),\nand find none. To begin, we note Ms. Purkey's benevolent, if misguided, motivation\nfor poisoning her husband by mixing the poison with his drugs: She asserted that she\nwas trying to scare him into abandoning his illegal use of drugs. This evidence might\ndemonstrate that Mr. Purkey had someone in his life who cared about his well being.\nTo the extent that this evidence could be construed as illustrating Mr. Purkey's\ndifficult home life, we note that the record is replete with evidence of the difficult and\ndysfunctional environments in which Mr. Purkey has lived, and so we cannot\nconclude that the omission of this additional evidence affected his substantial rights.\nSee Turner, 104 F.3d at 221.\n\n\n       Mr. Purkey also contends that the district court erred by refusing to allow\nDr. Cunningham to testify to his opinion that Mr. Purkey suffered from fetal alcohol\nexposure. The district court excluded the evidence because Mr. Purkey could not\nadduce specific evidence that his mother drank during the time that she was pregnant\nwith him. Mr. Purkey's offer of proof does indicate, however, that had the court\npermitted Dr. Cunningham to testify on this issue he would have brought forth\nsignificant circumstantial evidence that Mr. Purkey suffered from this affliction. First,\nthere was evidence that Mr. Purkey's mother abused alcohol dating back to at least\n1950. (Mr. Purkey was born in 1952.) Second, there was evidence that Mr. Purkey's\nmother had two other children around the time of Mr. Purkey's birth, both of whom\ndied, one shortly before and one shortly after birth. This, according to\nDr. Cunningham, would have been consistent with those children's fetal alcohol\nexposure. Third, Dr. Cunningham would have testified that Mr. Purkey's brain\n\n                                          -23-\n\fcondition is consistent with his having suffered fetal alcohol exposure. We think that\nDr. Cunningham's testimony regarding Mr. Purkey's fetal alcohol exposure would\nhave provided probative mitigating evidence. Cf. Silva v. Woodford, 279 F.3d 825,\n847 n.17 (9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 942 (2002). Given that and the\nrelaxed standard set forth by 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c), we conclude that the district court\nerred when it excluded this evidence simply because there was no direct evidence that\nMr. Purkey's mother drank while pregnant with him.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, when we consider the record as a whole, we are satisfied that this\nerror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See 18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2); Jones,\n527 U.S. at 402-05; cf. Hitchcock v. Dugger, 481 U.S. 393, 398-99 (1987); Chapman\nv. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). We are confident that the jury would have\nreached the sentence that it did even if the court had admitted this evidence. See\nJones, 527 U.S. at 402; cf. Sweet v. Delo, 125 F.3d 1144, 1158-59 (8th Cir. 1997),\ncert. denied, 523 U.S. 1010 (1998). The district court admitted significant expert\ntestimony regarding Mr. Purkey's brain abnormalities and their impact on his mental\nand emotional health. The jury was not, therefore, precluded from considering\nMr. Purkey's mental and emotional impairments as potential mitigating factors; it was\nmerely precluded from considering one of several possible explanations as to the\ncause of these alleged impairments. And, although we recognize that a jury may be\nmore likely to believe that someone suffers from a problem if its cause is explained,\nwe nevertheless harbor no doubt that considering the minimal probative value of the\nevidence and the overwhelming evidence and jury findings of serious aggravating\nfactors, its exclusion was harmless. Cf. United States v. Bernard, 299 F.3d 467, 487\n(5th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 928 (2003).\n\n\n        Mr. Purkey also assigns error in the district court's refusal to allow him to\nimpeach Dr. Park Dietz by inquiring into an error that the doctor made when testifying\nin the case of Yates v. State, Nos. 01-02-00462/00463, 2005 WL 20416 (Tex. Ct. App.\n\n                                         -24-\n\fJan. 6, 2005). When serving as an expert witness for the state in the Yates case,\nDr. Dietz erroneously testified that the facts of an episode of a television show on\nwhich he consulted, \"Law & Order,\" were very similar to those in Yates. In fact, no\nsuch episode existed. Id. at *3-*4. Dr. Dietz, during a proffer session conducted\noutside of the hearing of the jury in Mr. Purkey's case, freely admitted to the error that\nhe had made in the Yates trial. The district court, however, sustained the government's\nobjection to testimony about the error because it would \"create[] confusion and [was]\ncollateral.\"\n\n\n       In response to Mr. Purkey's argument, the government asserts that the exclusion\nof this evidence was proper under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. But that is not the\ncontrolling law here. This is an FDPA case, and its evidentiary standard must govern.\nSee Lee, 274 F.3d at 494-95. Accordingly, we review this issue under the standard of\n§ 3593(c), which provides for the exclusion of evidence \"if its probative value is\noutweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or\nmisleading the jury.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c); see Lee, 274 F.3d at 494.\n\n\n       Although one of the court's reasons, that the testimony would \"create[]\nconfusion,\" is arguably consistent with a permissible reason under the FDPA, we\ncannot conclude that the district court acted correctly when it refused to permit any\ninquiry into Dr. Dietz's previous mistake. This testimony would have been relevant\nto demonstrate the doctor's fallibility. Further, we cannot agree with the district court\nthat this testimony would have resulted in confusion. Dr. Dietz freely admitted that\nhe erred; that was not in dispute. The nature of Dr. Dietz's error, moreover, was not\nunusually complex or confusing. Therefore we can find no reason to conclude that\nthe probative value of this testimony was \"outweighed by the danger of creating unfair\nprejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\f       We nevertheless conclude that the error was harmless. Mr. Purkey's cross-\nexamination of Dr. Dietz was otherwise extensive. During that cross-examination,\nMr. Purkey was able to extract concessions from Dr. Dietz that he had made mistakes\nin two other cases in which he had testified. And, although we do not doubt that the\nexcluded information would have provided a morsel of additional probative evidence\nof Dr. Dietz's ability to err, given the otherwise extensive cross-examination that\nallowed the defense to bring out his other errors, and the overwhelming number and\nthe nature of the aggravating factors found by the jury, we cannot conclude that the\nabsence of this additional information affected Mr. Purkey's substantial rights. See\n18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2); Jones, 527 U.S. at 402-05; Hitchcock, 481 U.S. at 398-99; cf.\nBernard, 299 F.3d at 487; Sweet, 125 F.3d at 1158-59.\n\n\n       Mr. Purkey also maintains that the district court erred by denying his request\nto allow Dr. Peterson to present surrebuttal testimony in response to the testimony of\nDr. Helen Mayberg. Dr. Mayberg's testimony was presented to rebut the conclusions\nof the defense's experts regarding Mr. Purkey's alleged brain injuries. The defense\nrequested that it be allowed to introduce surrebuttal evidence pertaining to two of\nDr. Mayberg's conclusions: that Mr. Purkey could not have suffered significant brain\ninjuries in automobile accidents that occurred in 1968 and 1972, and that Mr. Purkey's\nfunctioning as a \"jailhouse lawyer\" was inconsistent with the sort of brain damage\nreported by the defense's medical experts.\n\n\n      The government argues that the court did not err in excluding this surrebuttal\ntestimony because Dr. Mayberg's rebuttal testimony did not raise a new matter. The\ndecision of whether to allow a party to present evidence in surrebuttal is generally\ncommitted to the discretion of the trial court, see United States v. Wilford, 710 F.2d\n439, 452 (8th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.S. 1039 (1984), and surrebuttal is\ntypically thought appropriate only when new matters are raised in the rebuttal\n\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\ftestimony, see United States v. Barnette, 211 F.3d 803, 821 (4th Cir. 2000); cf.\nWilford, 710 F.2d at 452.\n\n\n       We do not think that the FDPA alters this standard. Cf. Barnette, 211 F.3d at\n820-21. Although the FDPA dispenses with the rules governing the admission of\nevidence during criminal trials, it is not sensible to read this statutory imperative as\nalso divesting the trial judge of his or her traditional authority to control the mode and\norder of the interrogation of witnesses and the presentation of evidence. A contrary\nreading would transform the FDPA sentencing hearing into an evidentiary mélee.\n\n\n       Even assuming that Dr. Mayberg's testimony that Mr. Purkey's work as a\n\"jailhouse lawyer\" demonstrated his lack of significant brain damage presented a new\nmatter, thereby making surrebuttal appropriate, we cannot conclude that this putative\nerror provides an adequate ground for reversal. As mentioned previously, Mr. Purkey\npresented a significant amount of testimony regarding his assertion that he suffered\nfrom brain damage. This additional testimony would have, at best, offered only\nmarginal additional support for this defense. When we consider this fact combined\nwith the significant number and serious nature of the aggravating factors advanced by\nthe government and found by the jury, we cannot conclude that this error affected\nMr. Purkey's substantial rights. See 18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2); Jones, 527 U.S. at 402-\n05; Hitchcock, 481 U.S. at 398-99; cf. Bernard, 299 F.3d at 487; Sweet, 125 F.3d at\n1158-59.\n\n      Finally, Mr. Purkey asserts that the district court erred by overruling his\nobjection to questions that the government asked on cross-examination of\nDr. Peterson, one of Mr. Purkey's expert witnesses. Specifically, Mr. Purkey's counsel\nobjected to the government's inquiry into Dr. Peterson's views on the death penalty.\n\n      Even under the traditional rules of evidence, \"cross-examination regarding\npotential bias of a witness is proper.\" United States v. Amerson-Bey, 898 F.2d 681,\n\n                                          -27-\n\f682 (8th Cir. 1990); see United States v. McCoy, 131 F.3d 760, 760-61 (8th Cir. 1997)\n(per curiam). If Dr. Peterson strongly disfavored the death penalty, knowledge of that\nwould be relevant to the jury's evaluation of his credibility in testifying to factors that\ncould mitigate Mr. Purkey's sentence; \" 'exposure of a witness' motivation in testifying\nis a proper and important function of ... cross-examination,' \" Van Arsdall, 475 U.S.\nat 678-79 (quoting Davis, 415 U.S. at 316-17). To the extent that the FDPA alters this\nrule, it relaxes it, see 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c); Lee, 274 F.3d at 495; a fortiori the district\ncourt did not err in allowing the government to continue its line of inquiry into\nDr. Peterson's beliefs about the death penalty.\n\n       In addition to considering whether each of the evidentiary errors that we have\nfound is individually sufficient to require reversal, we have also considered, sua\nsponte, what cumulative effect these errors might have had upon Mr. Purkey's\nsubstantial rights. Cf. United States v. Steffen, 641 F.2d 591, 597-98 (8th Cir. 1981),\ncert. denied, 452 U.S. 943 (1981). After careful review, we also conclude that the\nerrors, even when taken cumulatively, are harmless.\n\n                                           B.\n       Mr. Purkey next maintains that the district court erred by denying his motion\nfor allocution during the penalty phase of the trial; Mr. Purkey sought to make a\nstatement before the jury without being subject to cross-examination. Although\nMr. Purkey was permitted to address the district court before it imposed his sentence,\nhe argues that the court functionally deprived him of his right to allocution, because\nit lacked any discretion to impose a sentence other than the one that the jury already\nhad recommended, see 18 U.S.C. § 3594. The district court's error, he maintains,\nviolated his constitutional rights, Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\nand the FDPA, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 3592(a)(8), 3593(c). We disagree.\n\n     First, our circuit previously has recognized that the right to allocution does not\nemanate from the Constitution. See United States v. Patterson, 128 F.3d 1259, 1260\n\n                                           -28-\n\f(8th Cir. 1997) (per curiam); see also Barnette, 211 F.3d at 820; Hall, 152 F.3d at 396.\nTherefore, even if Mr. Purkey were correct that the district court denied him the right\nto allocution, the error would not be a constitutional one.\n\n       Second, Mr. Purkey does not have a statutory right to make statements to a jury\nduring the penalty phase of an FDPA trial without being subject to cross-examination.\nRule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) requires that \"[b]efore imposing sentence,\" the district court must\n\"permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\"\nThe district court satisfied Rule 32 when it allowed Mr. Purkey to speak \"before\nimposing sentence.\" See Hall, 152 F.3d at 392. Although Mr. Purkey's allocution\ncould not have mitigated his sentence because it followed the jury's recommendation\nof the death penalty, see 18 U.S.C. § 3594, nowhere does Rule 32 grant Mr. Purkey\na right to allocution before a jury; Rule 32 speaks only of \"the court.\" We agree with\nthe Fifth Circuit that Rule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) should not be interpreted to entitle\nMr. Purkey to a right of allocution before the jury \"when the plain language of the rule\ndoes not dictate such an interpretation.\" Hall, 152 F.3d at 393; see also Barnette,\n211 F.3d at 820. As for the FDPA, nowhere does it mention a right to allocution or\nanything comparable; Mr. Purkey's claimed right on that ground therefore does not\nexist.\n\n                                           C.\n       Mr. Purkey assigns several errors relating to the jury's special findings and\nrecommendation of his death sentence. We previously noted that, to recommend a\ndeath sentence after determining that the defendant is eligible for such a sentence, the\njury must unanimously find that the statutory and non-statutory aggravating factors\n\"sufficiently outweigh\" the mitigating factors. See 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e). For an\naggravating factor to enter into the jury's calculation, the government must establish\n\"the existence of such a factor ... beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at § 3593(c). The\nstandard for mitigating factors, however, is less rigorous. The jury may consider any\nmitigating factor that at least one juror found proved \"by a preponderance of the\n\n                                         -29-\n\finformation.\" Id. at § 3593(c), (d). After the jury has completed its deliberations, it\nmust \"return special findings identifying any aggravating factor ... found to exist.\" Id.\nat § 3593(d).\n\n       Mr. Purkey first contends that the district court erroneously permitted the\nprosecution to present the jury with duplicative aggravating factors, thereby skewing\nthe jury's balancing of aggravating and mitigating factors in violation of the eighth\namendment. Because Mr. Purkey challenges the constitutionality of allegedly\nduplicative aggravating factors, we review the district court's decision de novo. Cf.\nCooks v. Ward, 165 F.3d 1283, 1289 (10th Cir. 1998).\n\n      Mr. Purkey's best case for duplication is that the nonstatutory aggravator for\n\"[s]ubstantial criminal history\" mirrors the statutory aggravator for convictions of\n\"two or more offenses punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year,\ncommitted on different occasions, involving the infliction and attempted infliction of\nserious bodily injury and death upon another person.\" The convictions that the\ngovernment offered to support both aggravating factors were identical.\n\n       We think that the Tenth Circuit is correct to conclude that the same facts can\nsupport different inferences that form different aggravators. See Medlock v. Ward,\n200 F.3d 1314, 1319 (10th Cir. 2000) (per curiam), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 882 (2000).\nOtherwise the government would either have to choose one out of several possible\naggravating factors for each instance of a defendant's misconduct or pack into a single\naggravator multiple negative inferences that could be drawn from the misconduct and\nthen risk the jury's rejection of the aggravator due to disagreement over just one of the\ninferences.\n\n       Even under the Tenth Circuit's standard, however, we agree with Mr. Purkey\nthat the nonstatutory aggravating factor duplicated the statutory one. The government\nused the same set of convictions each time for the same purpose, namely to show the\n\n                                          -30-\n\fdefendant's criminal history. The nonstatutory aggravating factor did refer to a fact\nof Mr. Purkey's criminal history that went unmentioned in the statutory aggravating\nfactor, namely, that Mr. Purkey \"shot Gregg W. Carlberg on or about August 3, 1980.\"\nEven if this fact were enough to distinguish the two aggravators, though, it overlaps\nwith a separate statutory aggravating factor based on Mr. Purkey's conviction of \"an\noffense punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year, involving the\nuse ... of a firearm ... against another person,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(2) – an aggravator\nthat went to the same history of illegal firearm use as did the shooting episode.\n\n       Despite the duplication of aggravators in Mr. Purkey's case, we see no basis for\nthe constitutional infirmity of such factors. The Supreme Court has \"never before held\nthat aggravating factors could be duplicative so as to render them constitutionally\ninvalid,\" Jones, 527 U.S. at 398 (plurality opinion), and we decline to do so when the\nFDPA avoids arbitrary death sentences by requiring juries to weigh aggravating and\nmitigating factors rather than to tally the factors on each side and declare a winner\nbased on sheer numbers. See 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e). But see United States v. Tipton,\n90 F.3d 861, 899 (4th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1253 (1997); United States\nv. McCullah, 76 F.3d 1087, 1111-12 (10th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1213\n(1997). The district court's jury instructions bolster this view as applied to\nMr. Purkey's case: The district court ensured that the jury would not employ a tally\nmethod of evaluating factors when it instructed the jury that \"weighing aggravating\nand mitigating factors ... is not a mechanical process. In other words, you should not\nsimply count the number of aggravating and mitigating factors. The law contemplates\nthat different factors may be given different weights or values by different jurors.\"\n\n       Of course, had the government introduced an invalid aggravating factor into the\njury's weighing process, then the government might have violated Mr. Purkey's rights\nunder the eighth amendment. See Stringer v. Black, 503 U.S. 222, 232 (1992). But\nMr. Purkey asserts no such error here.\n\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\f       Mr. Purkey next requests that our circuit reconsider its precedents that have\napproved jury instructions mandating that a jury recommend a sentence of death\nshould it conclude, after balancing aggravating against mitigating factors, that the\nformer sufficiently outweigh the latter to justify imposition of a death sentence. He\nrecognizes that overruling those precedents would require the action of our en banc\ncourt and that, as a panel of that court, we are required to give them effect. See United\nStates v. Provost, 969 F.2d 617, 622 (8th Cir. 1992). For our part, we believe that our\nprecedents are well-reasoned. See Nelson, 347 F.3d at 712; Ortiz, 315 F.3d at 900-01.\n\n       Finally, Mr. Purkey maintains that the FDPA requires juries to identify any\nmitigating factor that at least one juror found to exist and that the district court\nconsequently erred by accepting the jury's verdict form. (The verdict form asked the\njury to record the number of jurors who found each mitigating factor to exist, and the\njury returned that portion of the form blank.) Because Mr. Purkey presents us with\na question of law by asking us to interpret the FDPA, we review de novo the district\ncourt's refusal to order the jury to complete the mitigation portion of the verdict form.\nSee United States v. Storer, 413 F.3d 918, 921 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n        In a prior case, we hinted that the FDPA does not mandate that jurors identify\nthe mitigating factors they find to exist, but we ultimately avoided deciding the\nquestion. See United States v. Paul, 217 F.3d 989, 999 n.6 (8th Cir. 2000) (citing\nHall, 152 F.3d at 413). We conclude that in Paul we correctly, albeit tentatively,\nconstrued the FDPA. Section 3593(d) specifically requires the jury to \"return special\nfindings identifying any aggravating factor[s] ... found to exist,\" without any mention\nof identifying such mitigating factors, and so requires no special findings with respect\nto the latter. It is true that the jury's identification of proven mitigating factors\nfacilitates appellate review, especially when we have to evaluate the effect of any error\non the sentence that the jury recommended. Nevertheless, the jury's failure to identify\nproven mitigating factors is entirely proper under the FDPA, and therefore the district\ncourt did not err by accepting the jury's verdict form.\n\n                                          -32-\n\f                                          D.\n       In Mr. Purkey's last assignment of error, he argues that the district court erred\nby denying his motion for a mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct.\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, Mr. Purkey interrupted the government's cross-\nexamination of a psychiatric expert for the defense, at which point the district court\nexcused the jury and Mr. Purkey gave voice to an additional comment that the\nprosecutor interpreted as a threat against him. During the government's subsequent\ncross-examination of a defense expert, who testified to the calming effects of\nmedication that Mr. Purkey was taking, the prosecutor asked the expert whether he\nwas \"aware [that Mr. Purkey] threatened to run my head through yesterday in court,\"\nto which Mr. Purkey's counsel immediately objected. The district court sustained the\nobjection. Mr. Purkey contends that the prosecutor's question compromised the\nfairness of the penalty proceedings.\n\n        Earlier in our opinion, we rehearsed the legal principles that guide our review\nof alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Cf. Jackson, 41 F.3d at 1233. Even if, as\nMr. Purkey claims, the prosecutor's question was improper, we conclude that the\nquestion did not deprive Mr. Purkey of due process: Although the district court failed\nto instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor's question, it sustained defense counsel's\nobjection. Given that defense counsel did not request the court to give the jury a\ncautionary instruction and that the question was brief and isolated, the district court's\ncurative action, combined with the overwhelming evidence of aggravating factors,\nensured that Mr. Purkey was not denied a fair penalty proceeding. See id. This\nremains true even when we take into account any residual effect on the jury from the\ninstances of improper prosecutorial conduct that related to Mr. Purkey's tattoos and\noccurred during the guilt phase of Mr. Purkey's trial. We therefore conclude that the\ndistrict court did not err when it denied Mr. Purkey's motion for a mistrial.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -33-\n\f                                V.\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                     ______________________\n\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f",

See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a), (g), 3559(d),\n3591-3598. On appeal, Mr. Purkey raises myriad challenges to his conviction and\nsentence. After careful review, we conclude that his arguments lack merit and\ntherefore affirm the judgment of the district court.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr., United States District Judge for the\nWestern District of Missouri.\n\f       Jennifer Long, a sixteen year-old high school sophomore, disappeared in\nJanuary of 1998. On December 15, 1998, while in the Wyandotte County Jail\nawaiting a Kansas state prosecution for the murder of eighty-year-old Mary Ruth\nBales, Mr. Purkey contacted Detective Bill Howard of the Kansas City, Kansas, Police\nDepartment and offered to speak with him about a kidnapping and homicide that had\noccurred earlier that year. Mr. Purkey told Detective Howard that he also wanted to\nspeak with an FBI agent about this crime because he wanted to spend his time in a\nfederal, rather than a state, institution. Detective Howard asked FBI Special Agent\nDirk Tarpley to go with him to meet with Mr. Purkey.\n\n       The next day, Mr. Purkey met with Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley. At\nthe beginning of the meeting, Mr. Purkey executed a form indicating that he\nunderstood and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights. He then told the officers\nthat he was going to plead guilty in the Kansas case and was therefore willing to\nconfess to the kidnapping, rape, and murder of a Missouri woman, provided that he\ncould serve his state time in a federal penitentiary. Detective Howard and Agent\nTarpley informed Mr. Purkey that they could not make any promises but would take\nwhatever he had to say to the United States Attorney. After giving an account of the\nkidnapping, rape, and murder of the victim (who was later identified as Ms. Long),\nMr. Purkey refused to cooperate further unless he received assurances from the United\nStates Attorney that his case would be federally prosecuted.\n\n       That afternoon, Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley met with Kurt Shernuk,\nan Assistant United States Attorney for the District of Kansas. Although he was\nskeptical of Mr. Purkey, Mr. Shernuk indicated that his office might be willing to\nprosecute the case if Mr. Purkey fully cooperated with the investigators and provided\nthe location of the victim's remains and other evidence to corroborate his confession.\n\n      After meeting with Mr. Shernuk, Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley returned\nto the Wyandotte County Jail to speak with Mr. Purkey. They told him that\n\n                                         -2-\n\fMr. Shernuk wanted a body and would require full cooperation, but they did not make\nMr. Purkey any promises as to the sentence that he might receive. Mr. Purkey then\nled Messrs. Tarpley and Howard to the crime scene and to the place where he claimed\nto have discarded the victim's undergarments and jaw bone. He told the officers that\nbecause he had taken extraordinary measures to dispose of the body, including\ndismembering it with a chain saw and burning the remains, the victim's remains were\nnot recoverable.\n\n      More meetings occurred over the next several days. On December 17,\nDetective Howard and Agent Tarpley again met with Mr. Purkey and, after being\nreminded verbally of his constitutional rights, Mr. Purkey gave a detailed handwritten\nconfession. The next day, Detective Howard met with Mr. Purkey and, after\nreminding him of his rights, conducted a photo lineup to see if he could identify the\nvictim. Without hesitation, Mr. Purkey identified Ms. Long. Agent Tarpley met with\nMr. Purkey three days later, and after being advised of his rights, Mr. Purkey\nconfessed again.\n\n       During the guilt phase of his federal trial, Mr. Purkey affirmed his statements\nabout the killing and dismemberment of Ms. Long, but he disavowed his previous\nstatements that he forced Ms. Long to travel with him from Missouri to his home in\nKansas. Instead, he stated that Ms. Long, who he said he thought was a prostitute,\nvoluntarily entered his truck and accompanied him to his home. He indicated that he\nfabricated the kidnapping aspect of the confession to ensure that his actions would be\nconsidered, and therefore prosecuted as, a federal crime. After deliberating briefly,\nthe jury returned a verdict of guilty.\n\n       During the penalty phase of the trial, the defense submitted and the court\ninstructed on twenty-seven mitigating factors. Mr. Purkey's primary mitigation\ndefense consisted of expert testimony indicating that he suffered brain damage that\nresulted in diminished mental capacity. The government presented expert testimony\n\n                                         -3-\n\fto rebut this assertion and also produced evidence in support of six statutory and four\nnon-statutory aggravating factors.\n\n        After deliberating for eleven hours and ten minutes, the jury found the existence\nof all six of the statutory aggravating factors: (1) that the death of Ms. Long occurred\nduring the commission and attempted commission of her kidnapping; (2) that\nMr. Purkey killed Ms. Long in an especially heinous, cruel, and depraved manner in\nthat the killing involved torture and serious physical abuse; (3) that the victim was\nparticularly vulnerable due to her youthful age of sixteen years; (4) that Mr. Purkey\nhad previously been convicted of an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment of\nmore than one year, involving the use, attempted use, and threatened use of a firearm\nagainst another person; (5) that Mr. Purkey had previously been convicted of an\noffense resulting in the death of a person for which a sentence of life imprisonment\nwas authorized by statute; and (6) that Mr. Purkey had previously been convicted of\ntwo or more offenses punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year,\ncommitted on different occasions and involving the infliction and attempted infliction\nof serious bodily injury and death upon another person. The jury also found the\nexistence of three of the four non-statutory aggravating factors: (1) that the\ngovernment established loss and harm because of the victim's personal characteristics\nas an individual human being and the impact of the death upon the victim's family; (2)\nthat the defendant had previously killed Mary Ruth Bales in a vicious manner in that\nhe repeatedly struck her in the head with a hammer until she died; and (3) that\nMr. Purkey had a substantial criminal history. The jury did not record any evidence\nof its findings with regard to the mitigating factors. It then determined that\nMr. Purkey should be sentenced to death.\n\n                                       I.\n       We begin with Mr. Purkey's arguments pertaining to the district court's denials\nof his pretrial motions.\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\f                                           A.\n       Mr. Purkey's primary argument on appeal is that the district court erred in\ndenying his motion to suppress his multiple confessions to the kidnapping, rape, and\nmurder of Ms. Long. He argues that the district court should have suppressed his\nstatements to Messrs. Tarpley and Howard because the statements were involuntary\nand therefore obtained in violation of the fifth amendment to the Constitution. He\nbases this argument on his assertion that the officers obtained the confessions through\na false promise, cf. United States v. Pierce, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757093\"><a href=\"/opinion/757093/united-states-v-kevin-l-pierce/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 812-13 (8th Cir. 1998),\nnamely, that if he cooperated with the government he would receive a life sentence in\na federal institution. As an alternative to suppression, Mr. Purkey moved to prohibit\nthe government from pursuing the death penalty. The district court also denied that\nmotion.\n\n       The core of Mr. Purkey's argument is that Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley\nprocured his confession by indicating that the Assistant United States Attorney had\naccepted Mr. Purkey's alleged quid pro quo offer, that is, that Mr. Purkey would\nconfess to the crime and provide full cooperation in return for a life sentence in a\nfederal institution. Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley testified at the suppression\nhearing that they never made this representation to Mr. Purkey. The district court,\nadopting the discussion and conclusions in the report and recommendation of a\nmagistrate judge,2 squarely rejected Mr. Purkey's version of the events. It found that,\n\"[d]uring all of the time the officers spent with Purkey on December 16, 1998, there\nwere no hints or suggestions made to Purkey ... that Purkey would get a life sentence\nif he confessed. No one told Purkey that a life sentence would be recommended if he\nconfessed.\" The court inserted a footnote within this language to make explicit that\nit found \"the testimony of Special Agent Tarpley and Detective Howard more credible\nthan that of defendant Purkey\" on the issue of whether Messrs. Tarpley and Howard\n\n\n      2\n        The Honorable Sarah W. Hays, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Missouri.\n                                         -5-\n\ftold Mr. Purkey that the Assistant United States Attorney had agreed to give\nMr. Purkey a life sentence in the federal system in exchange for a full confession.\nFinally, the court concluded that during the course of the investigation, \"[n]o promises\nwere made to defendant Purkey in exchange for his confessions. While the defendant\nwas apparently surprised to find out that the death penalty was a potential sentence he\nmight receive, the officers did not mislead [the] defendant into believing that there\nwas no federal death penalty.\"\n\n       Because Mr. Purkey's challenges are to the district court's conclusions regarding\nthe facts underlying its decisions to deny his motions, we review the matter for clear\nerror.

Mr. Purkey testified that these notes were destroyed by prison\nstaff during a \"shakedown\" of his segregation pod while he was incarcerated at\nCCA(Corrections Corporation of America)-Leavenworth. He asserts that the\ndestruction of these notes constitutes a denial of due process and requires dismissal\nof the indictment.\n\n      In United States v.

The district\ncourt, adopting the discussion and conclusions of the magistrate judge, concluded that\nMr. Purkey's motion must fail because, among other shortcomings, Mr. Purkey could\nnot demonstrate that he was unable to obtain comparable exculpatory evidence by\nother means. We review the matter to determine whether this conclusion was clearly\nerroneous, cf. United States v. Weise, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721548\"><a href=\"/opinion/721548/united-states-v-simon-frank-weise-united-states-of-america-v-simon-frank/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504 (8th Cir. 1996), and we\nconclude that it was not.\n\n         At best, these notes can be characterized as Mr. Purkey's account of his\nconversations with Detective Howard and Agent Tarpley. They were neither\ntranscripts of the conversations nor were they attested to by Messrs. Howard or\nTarpley. They were simply Mr. Purkey's recollections of the conversations as\nrecorded shortly after each conversation concluded. Mr. Purkey had ample\nopportunity to introduce comparable evidence in the form of his own testimony as to\nthe substance of the conversations. And, although these notes could have been read\ninto evidence to fill gaps in Mr. Purkey's recollection as to the content of those\nconversations, see Fed. R. Evid. 803(5), Mr. Purkey's own testimony belied his\nassertion of an incomplete recollection of the conversations. We can find no clear\nerror in the magistrate judge's observation that, \"Despite Purkey's contention that he\nneeds these notes to assist him with remembering the details of the interrogations,\nPurkey's testimony would suggest that he has no trouble remembering [those] details\n... (at least until defense counsel reminded him that he should not remember).\" Hence\nthe district court did not err in denying Mr. Purkey's motion to dismiss based on the\nalleged destruction of his notes.\n\n                                         C.\n     Mr. Purkey also argues that the district court erred in denying his pretrial\nmotion asking the court to prohibit the government from seeking the death penalty\n\n                                         -7-\n\fbecause of two violations of the fifth amendment's indictment clause. First,\nMr. Purkey asserts that the Federal Death Penalty Act (FDPA), 18 U.S.C. § 3591-\n3598, is facially unconstitutional because it vests the prosecution with unilateral\nauthority to seek the death penalty without ever taking the matter of whether the death\npenalty is justified to the grand jury, see 18 U.S.C. § 3593(a). Second, he argues that\nhis prosecution ran afoul of the indictment clause because the government failed to\nseek an indictment upon some of the necessary elements of the capital prosecution,\nnamely, the government's non-statutory aggravating factors and the issue of whether\nthe aggravating factors sufficiently outweighed any mitigating factors to justify a\nsentence of death. Both of these are questions of law, and we therefore review them\nde novo. See United States v. Koons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778815\"><a href=\"/opinion/778815/united-states-v-timothy-donald-koons/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 990 (8th Cir. 2002); cf.

Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790128\"><a href=\"/opinion/790128/united-states-v-billie-jerome-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">940</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 949 (8th Cir. 2005) (en banc), we\naddressed the same facial challenge that Mr. Purkey now presents. There we\nrecognized that the FDPA does vest the prosecution with authority to charge\naggravating factors in a notice of intent to seek the death penalty, and does not\nspecifically require the government to bring those factors before the grand jury for\ninclusion in the indictment. But because \"nothing in the Act precludes the\ngovernment from also submitting them to the grand jury for inclusion in the\nindictment,\" we rejected the contention that the FDPA was unconstitutional. Id.\nTherefore, Mr. Purkey's facial challenge also fails.\n\n       To deal with Mr. Purkey's second challenge, we begin with a bit of background.\nUnder the FDPA, once the jury finds the defendant guilty of one of the offenses listed\nin 18 U.S.C. § 3591, the trial proceeds to a separate phase – the sentencing or penalty\nphase. In a homicide case, the jury must make three determinations in this latter phase\nbefore it can impose the death penalty: First it must find, unanimously and beyond\na reasonable doubt, that the defendant acted with the requisite mens rea. See\n18 U.S.C. § 3591(a)(2). Second, again unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\n                                         -8-\n\fit must find the existence of at least one statutory aggravating factor. See 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 3592(c), 3593(d). If the above two requirements are satisfied, the jury must then\ndetermine whether the aggravating factors, both statutory and non-statutory,\n\"sufficiently outweigh\" the mitigating factors presented by the defendant to justify a\ndeath sentence, \"or, in the absence of a mitigating factor, whether the aggravating\nfactor or factors alone are sufficient to justify\" that sentence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e).\n\n       Mr. Purkey maintains that because the jury is required to take this third step\nbefore it may impose a sentence of death, the necessary elements for a capital\nprosecution under the FDPA include all aggravating factors, including non-statutory\naggravating factors, and the weighing of aggravating factors versus mitigating factors.\nHe therefore contends that because his superseding indictment did not include non-\nstatutory aggravating factors or a determination that there exists probable cause to\nbelieve that aggravating factors sufficiently outweigh mitigating factors so as to\njustify a sentence of death, it falls short of what the fifth amendment requires. We\ndisagree.\n\n       \"[T]he same facts that the Sixth Amendment requires to be proven to the petit\njury beyond a reasonable doubt in state and federal prosecutions must also be found\nby the grand jury and charged in the indictment in federal prosecutions.\" Allen,\n406 F.3d at 943. For that reason, Allen held that to comport with the fifth amendment\n\"at least one statutory aggravating factor and the mens rea requirement [must] be\nfound by the grand jury and charged in the indictment\" in a prosecution under the\nFDPA. Id. Mr. Purkey's superseding indictment satisfies both of these requirements.\n\n       The indictment must charge at least one of the statutory aggravating factors that\nis ultimately found by the petit jury because \"that is what is required to elevate the\navailable statutory maximum sentence from life imprisonment to death.\" Id. In other\nwords, including that factor in the indictment is required to make the defendant\neligible for the death penalty. See United States v. Higgs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784555\"><a href=\"/opinion/784555/united-states-v-dustin-john-higgs/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">281</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 299 (4th Cir.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f2003), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004). We now make clear what Allen merely\nimplied: \"There is no requirement that the indictment allege all of the factors that\nmight be weighed by the jury when deciding whether to impose a death sentence.\"\nHiggs, 353 F.3d at 299. Non-statutory aggravating factors do not increase the\nmaximum punishment to which a defendant is subject. They are neither sufficient nor\nnecessary under the FDPA for a sentence of death. Their purpose is merely to aid the\nsentencer \"in selecting the appropriate sentence from the available options,\" id. at 298,\n\" 'on the basis of the character of the [defendant] and the circumstances of the crime,'\n\" id. (quoting Tuilaepa v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117875\"><a href=\"/opinion/117875/tuilaepa-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 972 (1994)).\n\n        Further, it makes no sense to speak of the weighing process mandated by\n18 U.S.C. § 3593(e) as an elemental fact for which a grand jury must find probable\ncause. In the words of the statute, it is a \"consideration,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e), – that\nis, the lens through which the jury must focus the facts that it has found to produce an\nindividualized determination regarding \"whether the defendant should be sentenced\nto death, to life imprisonment without possibility of release or some other lesser\nsentence.\" Id.\n\n       We thus conclude that Mr. Purkey's arguments based on the indictment clause\nof the fifth amendment are without merit.\n\n                                            II.\n        Mr. Purkey next challenges the district court's for-cause exclusion of three\npotential jurors who expressed reluctance to impose the death penalty.

I am opposed to the death penalty, and I will never vote\n             to impose the death penalty in any case, no matter what the\n             facts.\n\n             b. I am opposed to the death penalty, and I would have a\n             difficult time voting to impose the death penalty.\n\n             c. I am opposed to the death penalty, but could vote to\n             impose the death penalty if I believed that the death penalty\n             was called for in light of the facts and law in the case.\n\nMs. Fox declined to indicate that she could vote to impose the death penalty by\nselecting choice \"c\" and instead chose the ambiguous \"b.\" When we consider this\nresponse together with her other answers regarding her views on the death penalty, we\nfind sufficient evidence in the record from which the district court could conclude that\nher views on the death penalty would \" 'substantially impair the performance of her\nduties as a juror in accordance with h[er] instructions and h[er] oath.' \" Wainwright,\n469 U.S. at 424 (quoting Adams, 448 U.S. at 45).\n\n      Mr. Purkey also argues that the court erroneously struck Willie Randle after\nmishearing or incorrectly recollecting his responses during voir dire. During voir dire,\nthe government asked Mr. Randle whether he would \"hold the government to a higher\n\n                                         -12-\n\fburden of proof than what is required under the law.\" He responded, \"I think I\nwould.\" When the government next asked whether he would hold it to a higher\nburden of proof than \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" he replied, \"It has to be proof\nwithout a reasonable doubt.\" Later, in granting the government's request to strike\nMr. Randle, the district judge declared, \"My recollection is that he's holding the\ngovernment to a higher standard than the law provides.\"\n\n        Reviewing the cold record, it is difficult to divine exactly what Mr. Randle\nmeant when he replied that \"[i]t has to be proof without a reasonable doubt.\" Although\nthose words of the transcript, taken literally, may indicate that Mr. Randle had agreed\nto apply a burden equivalent to the one that the law actually imposes, the transcript\ncannot provide any insight regarding Mr. Randle's intent in using the phrase \"without\na reasonable doubt\" instead of \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" This is why the Supreme\nCourt instructed in Wainwright, 469 U.S. at 426, that \"deference must be paid to the\ntrial judge who sees and hears the juror.\" The trial judge, who had the opportunity to\nobserve the exchange, could have reasonably interpreted Mr. Randle's refusal to parrot\nthe words of the government and instead use the phrase \"without a reasonable doubt\"\nas an affirmation of his earlier statement that he would hold the government to a\nhigher burden of proof than the law provides. Based on the colloquy between Mr.\nRandle and the government, as well as the court's stated reason for its ruling, we\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by striking this potential\njuror.\n\n       Finally, Mr. Purkey argues that the district court erred when it removed Gary\nDanford for cause after he had been \"rehabilitated.\" When questioned by the\ngovernment, Mr. Danford insisted that he would hold the government to a higher\nburden of proof than reasonable doubt. But Mr. Danford reversed course under\nsubsequent questioning by Mr. Purkey's counsel and indicated that he would \"follow\nthe law.\" The district court concluded that, \"I think he has kind of made up his mind\nwhat the standard is and that the standard he has decided upon is something different\n\n                                         -13-\n\fthan what the law provides.\" Quite simply, the district court made a reasonable\njudgment based on its impression of Mr. Danford's credibility as was its prerogative.\nSee Nelson, 347 F.3d at 710-11; United States v.

He asserts that the district\ncourt erred in the following ways: by excluding the testimony of defense expert\nDr. David Preston; by refusing to allow Mr. Purkey to testify about how his father had\nintroduced him to prostitutes at an early age; and by refusing to permit cross-\nexamination of Michael Speakman regarding his misconduct while he was\nincarcerated at CCA-Leavenworth. \"We review de novo the district court's\ninterpretation and application of the rules of evidence, and review for an abuse of\ndiscretion the factual findings supporting its evidentiary ruling.\" United States v.\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787745\"><a href=\"/opinion/787745/united-states-v-lamont-o-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">700</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (8th Cir. 2004).

Mr. Purkey\nintended to offer this testimony during the guilt phase of the trial to support both his\ncontention that he did not intentionally kidnap Ms. Long (because he thought she was\na prostitute and/or voluntarily accompanied him to his home) and to illuminate\n\n                                           -14-\n\fMr. Purkey's state of mind when he confessed to Detective Howard and Agent\nTarpley. The district court concluded that \"although Dr. Preston is qualified in the\nfield of nuclear medicine, he is not qualified to testify regarding defendant's state of\nmind and actions at the time of the offenses or at the time that Mr. Purkey gave his\nstatements to the investigators.\"\n\n       We believe that the district court's conclusion was correct. Although we harbor\nno doubt that Dr. Preston was qualified to testify regarding the results of the tests that\nhe conducted on Mr. Purkey, there is nothing in the record that indicates that he was\nqualified to connect that testimony to the inquiry for which it was offered, namely,\nMr. Purkey's state of mind and actions either at the time of the offenses or when he\ngave his statements to the investigators. Indeed, in neither the expert report nor the\noffer of proof did Dr. Preston even attempt to tie the test results to Mr. Purkey's state\nof mind on the specific occasions in question. When questioned by the government,\nmoreover, Dr. Preston admitted that the images produced by the tests could not predict\nbehavior and did not have a causal relationship to criminal behavior. There is\nmanifestly no error in the district court's decision to exclude Dr. Preston's testimony.\n\n       Mr. Purkey also argues that the court erred when it refused, in the guilt phase\nof the trial, to allow him to testify that his father had introduced him to the use of\nprostitutes during his boyhood. (The court did permit some testimony of this nature\nin the penalty phase.) Mr. Purkey submits that this testimony would have provided\nthe jury with context to understand why he might have mistakenly believed that\nMs. Long was a prostitute. This, he argues, would have bolstered his defense that he\ndid not kidnap Ms. Long and that she willingly entered his car and traveled with him\nfrom Missouri to Kansas. And, defense counsel argues, if the jury believed that\nMr. Purkey did not transport Ms. Long across state lines against her will and did not\ndo so with the intent to rape her, it could not have convicted him of kidnapping. But\nwe fail to see how the method by which Mr. Purkey was introduced to prostitutes\nmore than thirty years before his crime is relevant to explaining why he mistook a\n\n                                          -15-\n\fteenage schoolgirl for a prostitute, and we therefore uphold the district court's decision\nto exclude the testimony.\n\n      Mr. Purkey also argues that the district court erred by refusing to permit him to\ncross-examine Michael Speakman regarding Mr. Speakman's uncharged misconduct\nwhile at CCA-Leavenworth. Mr. Purkey wanted to elicit this testimony to\ndemonstrate that a desire to avoid punishment for these uncharged acts might have\nmotivated Mr. Speakman to provide information and testimony for the prosecution.\nHe asserts that this denial deprived him of his sixth amendment right to confront an\nadverse witness.\n\n       Mr. Purkey calls our attention to the Supreme Court's language in Davis v.\nAlaska, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108974\"><a href=\"/opinion/108974/davis-v-alaska/\"><span class=\"volume\">415</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 316-17 (1974), which recognizes that \"the exposure of a\nwitness' motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the\nconstitutionally protected right of cross-examination.” Id. at 316-17.

See Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. at 680;\nUnited States v. Drapeau, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790984\"><a href=\"/opinion/790984/united-states-v-bernard-j-drapeau-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 875-76 (8th Cir. 2005). Here, Mr. Purkey's\n\n                                          -16-\n\fcounsel conclusively demonstrated by other means that Mr. Speakman was driven to\ntestify by a desire for leniency. Mr. Speakman's testimony established that the\ngovernment had filed a motion under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35,\nrequesting a reduction of Mr. Speakman's sentence. Mr. Purkey's counsel asked\nMr. Speakman, \"Basically what you're trying to do is do your best to get a reduction\nto your sentence?\" Mr. Speakman replied, \"I'd be lying if I said I was sitting here\nbeing a good citizen.\" Mr. Purkey's counsel then asked, \"Your sole point in being\nhere is to reduce the sentence that you received?\" Mr. Speakman replied, \"Yes,\nma'am.\" We have difficulty imagining how further testimony could have shown more\ndefinitively that a desire for leniency played a significant part in Mr. Speakman's\nwillingness to testify. Consequently, the district court did not abuse its discretion in\nlimiting cross-examination that would have further established that point.\n\n\n                                           B.\n       Mr. Purkey also submits that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on\nthe elements contained in the kidnapping statute. See 18 U.S.C. § 1201. That statute\nprovides that a person commits the offense of kidnapping if he or she \"unlawfully\nseizes, confines, inveigles, decoys, kidnaps, abducts, or carries away and holds for\nransom or reward or otherwise any person ... when – (1) the person is willfully\ntransported in interstate or foreign commerce.\" Id. This statute quite clearly requires\nthat the government prove that Mr. Purkey seized Ms. Long \"for ransom or reward or\notherwise,\" id., which in this case was for the purpose of forcible rape. Mr. Purkey,\nhowever, contends that the statute also requires that the government prove that he\ntransported Ms. Long across state lines for that same reason. He bases this contention\non the language of the statute that requires the defendant to have \"willfully\ntransported,\" id., his or her victim. He submits that this phrase requires that the\nkidnapper transport his or her victim with the intent to do something that the law\nforbids. Cf. United States v. Gabaldon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165225\"><a href=\"/opinion/165225/united-states-v-gabaldon/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1094-95 n.1 (10th Cir. 2004),\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1688</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). He therefore maintains that the district court\nerred by failing to give an instruction that required the government to prove not only\n\n                                          -17-\n\fthat he seized the victim for the purpose of forcible rape but also that he transported\nher across the state line for the purpose of forcible rape. This error is significant,\naccording to Mr. Purkey, because he argued as part of his defense that he transported\nMs. Long from Missouri to Kansas without the intent to rape. We will affirm if the\ninstructions correctly stated the law and fairly and adequately submitted the issues to\nthe jury. Cf. United States v. Kehoe, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 593 (8th Cir. 2002), cert. denied,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">538</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1048</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003).\n\n\n       The district court instructed the jury that in order to convict it had to find that\n\"the defendant unlawfully seized, confined, kidnapped, abducted, carried away or held\nJennifer Long;\" that \"the defendant did so for the purpose of the forcible rape of\nJennifer Long;\" that \"the defendant willfully, knowingly, and unlawfully transported\nJennifer Long across the state line from Missouri to Kansas;\" and that \"Jennifer Long\ndied as a result of defendant's actions.\" This instruction precisely tracked the statute's\nordering of the elements. See 18 U.S.C. § 1201. And, although the Eighth Circuit\nManual of Model Jury Instructions (Criminal) (2005) does not contain a recommended\ninstruction on kidnapping, the instruction given by the district court is consistent with\nthe recommended instructions for the Ninth and Eleventh Circuit, see Ninth Circuit\nManual of Model Jury Instructions (Criminal) § 8.95 (2003 ed.); Eleventh Circuit\nPattern Jury Instructions (Criminal) 49 (2003 ed.), as well as the instruction\nrecommended by the Federal Judicial Center, Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions § 84.\nCf. Eighth Circuit Manual of Model Jury Instructions (Criminal) 12.07A. We disagree\nwith Mr. Purkey's construction of the statute and therefore find no error in the district\ncourt's instruction on the elements contained in § 1201.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -18-\n\f                                            C.\n        In his last contention of error with respect to the guilt phase of his trial,\nMr. Purkey maintains that the district court erred in denying his motion for a mistrial\nbased on prosecutorial misconduct. He asserts that the government's efforts to call\nattention to his tattoos that depicted, among other things, a Nazi swastika and symbols\nof the Aryan Brotherhood unfairly inflamed the jury and deprived him of his right to\na fair trial.\n\n\n       During the government's direct examination of its first witness, it displayed a\npicture of Mr. Purkey standing shirtless with his tattoos visible. Due to a\nmisunderstanding between the prosecution and the defense, Mr. Purkey's counsel did\nnot have a chance to object before the government displayed the picture to the jury.\nMr. Purkey's counsel then objected to the picture's admission into evidence and that\nobjection was sustained. Three days later, during the government's cross-examination\nof Mr. Purkey, the government again highlighted the tattoos. The prosecutor asked\nMr. Purkey whether Ms. Long observed his tattoos, including the \"Nazi swastika\"\ntattoo, when she entered his vehicle or while she was, according to Mr. Purkey,\nvoluntarily kissing him while he had his shirt off. The government stated that it made\nthis inquiry to demonstrate the unreasonableness of Mr. Purkey's testimony that\nMs. Long voluntarily accompanied him to his home and consented to engaging in\nforeplay with him. When defense counsel objected to this question, the district court\nsustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the government's questions\nabout Mr. Purkey's tattoos. The defense then asked the judge to declare a mistrial\nbased on the prosecution's referring to the tattoos after the district court had previously\nsustained the objection regarding the picture showing the tattoos. The district court\ndenied that request.\n\n\n      \"The test for reversible prosecutorial misconduct has two parts: (1) the\nprosecutor's remarks or conduct must in fact have been improper, and (2) such\n\n                                           -19-\n\fremarks or conduct must have prejudicially affected the defendant's substantial rights\nso as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial.\" United States v.

Even assuming arguendo that the prosecutor's actions and\nquestions were improper, these actions nevertheless fail to constitute reversible error.\nWhen determining whether the prosecutor's remarks and conduct so infected the trial\nwith unfairness that it deprived the defendant of a fair trial, we usually consider three\ncriteria: \"(1) the cumulative effect of such misconduct; (2) the strength of the properly\nadmitted evidence of the defendant's guilt; and (3) the curative actions taken by the\ntrial court.\" Hernandez, 779 F.2d at 460. Here the cumulative effect of the\nprosecutor's references to Mr. Purkey's tattoos was not significant. Although we do\nnot doubt that references of this sort can sometimes result in prejudice, the prosecution\nreferred to Mr. Purkey's tattoos only twice, cf. id., and only briefly at that. There was\nalso considerable evidence of guilt. Although he gave a somewhat different story at\ntrial, there was evidence that Mr. Purkey had confessed to the crime on multiple\noccasions. Finally, the district court took prompt curative action. It sustained the\nobjections to the admission of the picture and to the questions regarding Mr. Purkey's\ntattoos. After sustaining the latter objection, the court also instructed the jury to\ndisregard the questions. Cf. United States v. Uphoff, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771132\"><a href=\"/opinion/771132/united-states-of-america-v-martin-uphoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 625-26 (8th Cir.\n2000).

He asserts that the district court erred in the following ways: by refusing to\npermit evidence that his wife had poisoned him; by excluding the testimony of\nDr. Mark Cunningham regarding Mr. Purkey's alleged fetal alcohol exposure; by\n\n                                          -20-\n\frefusing to permit the surrebuttal testimony of Dr. Stephen Peterson in response to the\ntestimony of Dr. Helen Mayberg; by limiting the impeachment of Dr. Park Dietz; and\nby allowing the government to question Dr. Peterson regarding his views on the death\npenalty.\n\n\n       \"The Federal Death Penalty Act (FDPA) erects very low barriers to the\nadmission of evidence at capital sentencing hearings.\" United States v.

Even if we\nconclude that the district court erred, we cannot reverse or vacate a federal death\nsentence on account of an error that is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See\n18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2); Jones v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118309\"><a href=\"/opinion/118309/jones-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">373</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 402-05 (1999).\n\n\n       Mr. Purkey contends that the district court erred by refusing to allow evidence\nthat his wife, Jeanette Purkey, had poisoned him. Mr. Purkey wished to use this\nevidence to demonstrate that because he was operating under the influence of poison\nwhen he murdered the elderly Kansas woman or when he killed Ms. Long, his actions\ntook place while he was involuntarily intoxicated or, at the very least, in an altered\nmental state. When he sought to introduce the evidence in the penalty phase (he also\nsought to introduce this evidence in the guilt phase), he had no evidence that the\npoison he allegedly received, rat poison, had any known effect on the mind. Also, his\nwife's testimony as to whether she had poisoned him during the relevant time period\nwas equivocal at best. During the penalty phase, the government objected to the\nevidence, asserting that for both of the above reasons the presentation of this evidence\nwas not relevant and would be a \"big diversion\" for the jury. The district court\nagreed.\n\n\n      We cannot say that the district court erred in excluding this evidence. The\ndefense admitted that it had no evidence that rat poison has any psychological effects.\nTherefore, this evidence could not have had any probative value to suggest that\nMr. Purkey's mind was operating under the poison's supposed influence when he\ncommitted either of the two murders. A reasonable judge could conclude that this\nevidence was both completely irrelevant to the purpose for which it was offered, cf.\nLockett, 438 U.S. at 604 n.12 (plurality opinion), and, because of the scandalous and\n\n                                         -22-\n\fperplexing nature of the claim, had significant potential to confuse or mislead the jury.\nCf. 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).\n\n\n       Mr. Purkey also asserts on appeal that this evidence also demonstrates his\ndifficult home life. Because he did not argue this below, we review for plain error,\nsee Lee, 274 F.3d at 493; United States v. Turner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"732508\"><a href=\"/opinion/732508/united-states-v-john-henry-turner-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221 (8th Cir. 1997),\nand find none. To begin, we note Ms. Purkey's benevolent, if misguided, motivation\nfor poisoning her husband by mixing the poison with his drugs: She asserted that she\nwas trying to scare him into abandoning his illegal use of drugs. This evidence might\ndemonstrate that Mr. Purkey had someone in his life who cared about his well being.\nTo the extent that this evidence could be construed as illustrating Mr. Purkey's\ndifficult home life, we note that the record is replete with evidence of the difficult and\ndysfunctional environments in which Mr. Purkey has lived, and so we cannot\nconclude that the omission of this additional evidence affected his substantial rights.\nSee Turner, 104 F.3d at 221.\n\n\n       Mr. Purkey also contends that the district court erred by refusing to allow\nDr. Cunningham to testify to his opinion that Mr. Purkey suffered from fetal alcohol\nexposure. The district court excluded the evidence because Mr. Purkey could not\nadduce specific evidence that his mother drank during the time that she was pregnant\nwith him. Mr. Purkey's offer of proof does indicate, however, that had the court\npermitted Dr. Cunningham to testify on this issue he would have brought forth\nsignificant circumstantial evidence that Mr. Purkey suffered from this affliction. First,\nthere was evidence that Mr. Purkey's mother abused alcohol dating back to at least\n1950. (Mr. Purkey was born in 1952.) Second, there was evidence that Mr. Purkey's\nmother had two other children around the time of Mr. Purkey's birth, both of whom\ndied, one shortly before and one shortly after birth. This, according to\nDr. Cunningham, would have been consistent with those children's fetal alcohol\nexposure. Third, Dr. Cunningham would have testified that Mr. Purkey's brain\n\n                                          -23-\n\fcondition is consistent with his having suffered fetal alcohol exposure. We think that\nDr. Cunningham's testimony regarding Mr. Purkey's fetal alcohol exposure would\nhave provided probative mitigating evidence. Cf. Silva v. Woodford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776474\"><a href=\"/opinion/776474/benjamin-wai-silva-v-jeanne-s-woodford-warden-san-quentin-state-prison/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n847 n.17 (9th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">942</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). Given that and the\nrelaxed standard set forth by 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c), we conclude that the district court\nerred when it excluded this evidence simply because there was no direct evidence that\nMr. Purkey's mother drank while pregnant with him.\n\n\n       Nevertheless, when we consider the record as a whole, we are satisfied that this\nerror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. See 18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2); Jones,\n527 U.S. at 402-05; cf. Hitchcock v. Dugger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111871\"><a href=\"/opinion/111871/hitchcock-v-dugger/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 398-99 (1987); Chapman\nv.

We are confident that the jury would have\nreached the sentence that it did even if the court had admitted this evidence. See\nJones, 527 U.S. at 402; cf. Sweet v. Delo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746780\"><a href=\"/opinion/746780/glennon-paul-sweet-v-paul-delo-superintendent-potosi-correctional-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1158-59 (8th Cir. 1997),\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998). The district court admitted significant expert\ntestimony regarding Mr. Purkey's brain abnormalities and their impact on his mental\nand emotional health. The jury was not, therefore, precluded from considering\nMr. Purkey's mental and emotional impairments as potential mitigating factors; it was\nmerely precluded from considering one of several possible explanations as to the\ncause of these alleged impairments. And, although we recognize that a jury may be\nmore likely to believe that someone suffers from a problem if its cause is explained,\nwe nevertheless harbor no doubt that considering the minimal probative value of the\nevidence and the overwhelming evidence and jury findings of serious aggravating\nfactors, its exclusion was harmless. Cf. United States v. Bernard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778660\"><a href=\"/opinion/778660/united-states-v-brandon-bernard-and-christopher-andre-vialva/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487\n(5th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">928</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003).\n\n\n        Mr. Purkey also assigns error in the district court's refusal to allow him to\nimpeach Dr. Park Dietz by inquiring into an error that the doctor made when testifying\nin the case of Yates v. State, Nos. 01-02-00462/00463, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">20416</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. Ct. App.\n\n                                         -24-\n\fJan. 6, 2005). When serving as an expert witness for the state in the Yates case,\nDr. Dietz erroneously testified that the facts of an episode of a television show on\nwhich he consulted, \"Law & Order,\" were very similar to those in Yates. In fact, no\nsuch episode existed. Id. at *3-*4. Dr. Dietz, during a proffer session conducted\noutside of the hearing of the jury in Mr. Purkey's case, freely admitted to the error that\nhe had made in the Yates trial. The district court, however, sustained the government's\nobjection to testimony about the error because it would \"create[] confusion and [was]\ncollateral.\"\n\n\n       In response to Mr. Purkey's argument, the government asserts that the exclusion\nof this evidence was proper under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. But that is not the\ncontrolling law here. This is an FDPA case, and its evidentiary standard must govern.\nSee Lee, 274 F.3d at 494-95. Accordingly, we review this issue under the standard of\n§ 3593(c), which provides for the exclusion of evidence \"if its probative value is\noutweighed by the danger of creating unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, or\nmisleading the jury.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c); see Lee, 274 F.3d at 494.\n\n\n       Although one of the court's reasons, that the testimony would \"create[]\nconfusion,\" is arguably consistent with a permissible reason under the FDPA, we\ncannot conclude that the district court acted correctly when it refused to permit any\ninquiry into Dr. Dietz's previous mistake. This testimony would have been relevant\nto demonstrate the doctor's fallibility. Further, we cannot agree with the district court\nthat this testimony would have resulted in confusion. Dr. Dietz freely admitted that\nhe erred; that was not in dispute. The nature of Dr. Dietz's error, moreover, was not\nunusually complex or confusing. Therefore we can find no reason to conclude that\nthe probative value of this testimony was \"outweighed by the danger of creating unfair\nprejudice, confusing the issues, or misleading the jury,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\f       We nevertheless conclude that the error was harmless. Mr. Purkey's cross-\nexamination of Dr. Dietz was otherwise extensive. During that cross-examination,\nMr. Purkey was able to extract concessions from Dr. Dietz that he had made mistakes\nin two other cases in which he had testified. And, although we do not doubt that the\nexcluded information would have provided a morsel of additional probative evidence\nof Dr. Dietz's ability to err, given the otherwise extensive cross-examination that\nallowed the defense to bring out his other errors, and the overwhelming number and\nthe nature of the aggravating factors found by the jury, we cannot conclude that the\nabsence of this additional information affected Mr. Purkey's substantial rights. See\n18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2); Jones, 527 U.S. at 402-05; Hitchcock, 481 U.S. at 398-99; cf.\nBernard, 299 F.3d at 487; Sweet, 125 F.3d at 1158-59.\n\n\n       Mr. Purkey also maintains that the district court erred by denying his request\nto allow Dr. Peterson to present surrebuttal testimony in response to the testimony of\nDr. Helen Mayberg. Dr. Mayberg's testimony was presented to rebut the conclusions\nof the defense's experts regarding Mr. Purkey's alleged brain injuries. The defense\nrequested that it be allowed to introduce surrebuttal evidence pertaining to two of\nDr. Mayberg's conclusions: that Mr. Purkey could not have suffered significant brain\ninjuries in automobile accidents that occurred in 1968 and 1972, and that Mr. Purkey's\nfunctioning as a \"jailhouse lawyer\" was inconsistent with the sort of brain damage\nreported by the defense's medical experts.\n\n\n      The government argues that the court did not err in excluding this surrebuttal\ntestimony because Dr. Mayberg's rebuttal testimony did not raise a new matter. The\ndecision of whether to allow a party to present evidence in surrebuttal is generally\ncommitted to the discretion of the trial court, see United States v. Wilford, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420763\"><a href=\"/opinion/420763/united-states-v-harry-j-wilford-united-states-of-america-v-everett-g/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">439</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 452 (8th Cir. 1983), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), and surrebuttal is\ntypically thought appropriate only when new matters are raised in the rebuttal\n\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\ftestimony, see United States v.

Cf. Barnette, 211 F.3d at\n820-21. Although the FDPA dispenses with the rules governing the admission of\nevidence during criminal trials, it is not sensible to read this statutory imperative as\nalso divesting the trial judge of his or her traditional authority to control the mode and\norder of the interrogation of witnesses and the presentation of evidence. A contrary\nreading would transform the FDPA sentencing hearing into an evidentiary mélee.\n\n\n       Even assuming that Dr. Mayberg's testimony that Mr. Purkey's work as a\n\"jailhouse lawyer\" demonstrated his lack of significant brain damage presented a new\nmatter, thereby making surrebuttal appropriate, we cannot conclude that this putative\nerror provides an adequate ground for reversal. As mentioned previously, Mr. Purkey\npresented a significant amount of testimony regarding his assertion that he suffered\nfrom brain damage. This additional testimony would have, at best, offered only\nmarginal additional support for this defense. When we consider this fact combined\nwith the significant number and serious nature of the aggravating factors advanced by\nthe government and found by the jury, we cannot conclude that this error affected\nMr. Purkey's substantial rights. See 18 U.S.C. § 3595(c)(2); Jones, 527 U.S. at 402-\n05; Hitchcock, 481 U.S. at 398-99; cf. Bernard, 299 F.3d at 487; Sweet, 125 F.3d at\n1158-59.\n\n      Finally, Mr. Purkey asserts that the district court erred by overruling his\nobjection to questions that the government asked on cross-examination of\nDr. Peterson, one of Mr. Purkey's expert witnesses. Specifically, Mr. Purkey's counsel\nobjected to the government's inquiry into Dr. Peterson's views on the death penalty.\n\n      Even under the traditional rules of evidence, \"cross-examination regarding\npotential bias of a witness is proper.\" United States v. Amerson-Bey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538449\"><a href=\"/opinion/538449/united-states-v-raymond-amerson-bey/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">681</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n                                          -27-\n\f682 (8th Cir. 1990); see United States v.

If Dr. Peterson strongly disfavored the death penalty, knowledge of that\nwould be relevant to the jury's evaluation of his credibility in testifying to factors that\ncould mitigate Mr. Purkey's sentence; \" 'exposure of a witness' motivation in testifying\nis a proper and important function of ... cross-examination,' \" Van Arsdall, 475 U.S.\nat 678-79 (quoting Davis, 415 U.S. at 316-17). To the extent that the FDPA alters this\nrule, it relaxes it, see 18 U.S.C. § 3593(c); Lee, 274 F.3d at 495; a fortiori the district\ncourt did not err in allowing the government to continue its line of inquiry into\nDr. Peterson's beliefs about the death penalty.\n\n       In addition to considering whether each of the evidentiary errors that we have\nfound is individually sufficient to require reversal, we have also considered, sua\nsponte, what cumulative effect these errors might have had upon Mr. Purkey's\nsubstantial rights. Cf. United States v. Steffen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"387273\"><a href=\"/opinion/387273/united-states-v-donald-steffen/\"><span class=\"volume\">641</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 597-98 (8th Cir. 1981),\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">943</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981). After careful review, we also conclude that the\nerrors, even when taken cumulatively, are harmless.\n\n                                           B.\n       Mr. Purkey next maintains that the district court erred by denying his motion\nfor allocution during the penalty phase of the trial; Mr. Purkey sought to make a\nstatement before the jury without being subject to cross-examination. Although\nMr. Purkey was permitted to address the district court before it imposed his sentence,\nhe argues that the court functionally deprived him of his right to allocution, because\nit lacked any discretion to impose a sentence other than the one that the jury already\nhad recommended, see 18 U.S.C. § 3594. The district court's error, he maintains,\nviolated his constitutional rights, Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,\nand the FDPA, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 3592(a)(8), 3593(c). We disagree.\n\n     First, our circuit previously has recognized that the right to allocution does not\nemanate from the Constitution. See United States v. Patterson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747803\"><a href=\"/opinion/747803/united-states-v-ronald-a-patterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1260\n\n                                           -28-\n\f(8th Cir. 1997) (per curiam); see also Barnette, 211 F.3d at 820; Hall, 152 F.3d at 396.\nTherefore, even if Mr. Purkey were correct that the district court denied him the right\nto allocution, the error would not be a constitutional one.\n\n       Second, Mr. Purkey does not have a statutory right to make statements to a jury\nduring the penalty phase of an FDPA trial without being subject to cross-examination.\nRule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) requires that \"[b]efore imposing sentence,\" the district court must\n\"permit the defendant to speak or present any information to mitigate the sentence.\"\nThe district court satisfied Rule 32 when it allowed Mr. Purkey to speak \"before\nimposing sentence.\" See Hall, 152 F.3d at 392. Although Mr. Purkey's allocution\ncould not have mitigated his sentence because it followed the jury's recommendation\nof the death penalty, see 18 U.S.C. § 3594, nowhere does Rule 32 grant Mr. Purkey\na right to allocution before a jury; Rule 32 speaks only of \"the court.\" We agree with\nthe Fifth Circuit that Rule 32(i)(4)(A)(ii) should not be interpreted to entitle\nMr. Purkey to a right of allocution before the jury \"when the plain language of the rule\ndoes not dictate such an interpretation.\" Hall, 152 F.3d at 393; see also Barnette,\n211 F.3d at 820. As for the FDPA, nowhere does it mention a right to allocution or\nanything comparable; Mr. Purkey's claimed right on that ground therefore does not\nexist.\n\n                                           C.\n       Mr. Purkey assigns several errors relating to the jury's special findings and\nrecommendation of his death sentence. We previously noted that, to recommend a\ndeath sentence after determining that the defendant is eligible for such a sentence, the\njury must unanimously find that the statutory and non-statutory aggravating factors\n\"sufficiently outweigh\" the mitigating factors. See 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e). For an\naggravating factor to enter into the jury's calculation, the government must establish\n\"the existence of such a factor ... beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at § 3593(c). The\nstandard for mitigating factors, however, is less rigorous. The jury may consider any\nmitigating factor that at least one juror found proved \"by a preponderance of the\n\n                                         -29-\n\finformation.\" Id. at § 3593(c), (d). After the jury has completed its deliberations, it\nmust \"return special findings identifying any aggravating factor ... found to exist.\" Id.\nat § 3593(d).\n\n       Mr. Purkey first contends that the district court erroneously permitted the\nprosecution to present the jury with duplicative aggravating factors, thereby skewing\nthe jury's balancing of aggravating and mitigating factors in violation of the eighth\namendment. Because Mr. Purkey challenges the constitutionality of allegedly\nduplicative aggravating factors, we review the district court's decision de novo. Cf.\nCooks v.

See Medlock v. Ward,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159069\"><a href=\"/opinion/159069/medlock-v-gibson/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1314</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1319 (10th Cir. 2000) (per curiam), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">882</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000).\nOtherwise the government would either have to choose one out of several possible\naggravating factors for each instance of a defendant's misconduct or pack into a single\naggravator multiple negative inferences that could be drawn from the misconduct and\nthen risk the jury's rejection of the aggravator due to disagreement over just one of the\ninferences.\n\n       Even under the Tenth Circuit's standard, however, we agree with Mr. Purkey\nthat the nonstatutory aggravating factor duplicated the statutory one. The government\nused the same set of convictions each time for the same purpose, namely to show the\n\n                                          -30-\n\fdefendant's criminal history. The nonstatutory aggravating factor did refer to a fact\nof Mr. Purkey's criminal history that went unmentioned in the statutory aggravating\nfactor, namely, that Mr. Purkey \"shot Gregg W. Carlberg on or about August 3, 1980.\"\nEven if this fact were enough to distinguish the two aggravators, though, it overlaps\nwith a separate statutory aggravating factor based on Mr. Purkey's conviction of \"an\noffense punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year, involving the\nuse ... of a firearm ... against another person,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3592(c)(2) – an aggravator\nthat went to the same history of illegal firearm use as did the shooting episode.\n\n       Despite the duplication of aggravators in Mr. Purkey's case, we see no basis for\nthe constitutional infirmity of such factors. The Supreme Court has \"never before held\nthat aggravating factors could be duplicative so as to render them constitutionally\ninvalid,\" Jones, 527 U.S. at 398 (plurality opinion), and we decline to do so when the\nFDPA avoids arbitrary death sentences by requiring juries to weigh aggravating and\nmitigating factors rather than to tally the factors on each side and declare a winner\nbased on sheer numbers. See 18 U.S.C. § 3593(e). But see United States v.

The district court's jury instructions bolster this view as applied to\nMr. Purkey's case: The district court ensured that the jury would not employ a tally\nmethod of evaluating factors when it instructed the jury that \"weighing aggravating\nand mitigating factors ... is not a mechanical process. In other words, you should not\nsimply count the number of aggravating and mitigating factors. The law contemplates\nthat different factors may be given different weights or values by different jurors.\"\n\n       Of course, had the government introduced an invalid aggravating factor into the\njury's weighing process, then the government might have violated Mr. Purkey's rights\nunder the eighth amendment. See Stringer v. Black, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112705\"><a href=\"/opinion/112705/stringer-v-black/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 232 (1992). But\nMr. Purkey asserts no such error here.\n\n\n\n                                         -31-\n\f       Mr. Purkey next requests that our circuit reconsider its precedents that have\napproved jury instructions mandating that a jury recommend a sentence of death\nshould it conclude, after balancing aggravating against mitigating factors, that the\nformer sufficiently outweigh the latter to justify imposition of a death sentence. He\nrecognizes that overruling those precedents would require the action of our en banc\ncourt and that, as a panel of that court, we are required to give them effect. See United\nStates v. Provost, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"586942\"><a href=\"/opinion/586942/united-states-v-terrance-kenneth-provost/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 (8th Cir. 1992). For our part, we believe that our\nprecedents are well-reasoned. See Nelson, 347 F.3d at 712; Ortiz, 315 F.3d at 900-01.\n\n       Finally, Mr. Purkey maintains that the FDPA requires juries to identify any\nmitigating factor that at least one juror found to exist and that the district court\nconsequently erred by accepting the jury's verdict form. (The verdict form asked the\njury to record the number of jurors who found each mitigating factor to exist, and the\njury returned that portion of the form blank.) Because Mr. Purkey presents us with\na question of law by asking us to interpret the FDPA, we review de novo the district\ncourt's refusal to order the jury to complete the mitigation portion of the verdict form.\nSee United States v. Storer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790890\"><a href=\"/opinion/790890/united-states-v-donald-daye-storer/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 921 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n        In a prior case, we hinted that the FDPA does not mandate that jurors identify\nthe mitigating factors they find to exist, but we ultimately avoided deciding the\nquestion. See United States v. Paul, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769328\"><a href=\"/opinion/769328/united-states-v-jeffrey-william-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">989</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 999 n.6 (8th Cir. 2000) (citing\nHall, 152 F.3d at 413). We conclude that in Paul we correctly, albeit tentatively,\nconstrued the FDPA. Section 3593(d) specifically requires the jury to \"return special\nfindings identifying any aggravating factor[s] ... found to exist,\" without any mention\nof identifying such mitigating factors, and so requires no special findings with respect\nto the latter. It is true that the jury's identification of proven mitigating factors\nfacilitates appellate review, especially when we have to evaluate the effect of any error\non the sentence that the jury recommended. Nevertheless, the jury's failure to identify\nproven mitigating factors is entirely proper under the FDPA, and therefore the district\ncourt did not err by accepting the jury's verdict form.\n\n                                          -32-\n\f                                          D.\n       In Mr. Purkey's last assignment of error, he argues that the district court erred\nby denying his motion for a mistrial based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct.\nDuring the penalty phase of the trial, Mr. Purkey interrupted the government's cross-\nexamination of a psychiatric expert for the defense, at which point the district court\nexcused the jury and Mr. Purkey gave voice to an additional comment that the\nprosecutor interpreted as a threat against him. During the government's subsequent\ncross-examination of a defense expert, who testified to the calming effects of\nmedication that Mr. Purkey was taking, the prosecutor asked the expert whether he\nwas \"aware [that Mr. Purkey] threatened to run my head through yesterday in court,\"\nto which Mr. Purkey's counsel immediately objected. The district court sustained the\nobjection. Mr. Purkey contends that the prosecutor's question compromised the\nfairness of the penalty proceedings.\n\n        Earlier in our opinion, we rehearsed the legal principles that guide our review\nof alleged prosecutorial misconduct. Cf. Jackson, 41 F.3d at 1233. Even if, as\nMr. Purkey claims, the prosecutor's question was improper, we conclude that the\nquestion did not deprive Mr. Purkey of due process: Although the district court failed\nto instruct the jury to disregard the prosecutor's question, it sustained defense counsel's\nobjection. Given that defense counsel did not request the court to give the jury a\ncautionary instruction and that the question was brief and isolated, the district court's\ncurative action, combined with the overwhelming evidence of aggravating factors,\nensured that Mr. Purkey was not denied a fair penalty proceeding. See id. This\nremains true even when we take into account any residual effect on the jury from the\ninstances of improper prosecutorial conduct that related to Mr. Purkey's tattoos and\noccurred during the guilt phase of Mr. Purkey's trial. We therefore conclude that the\ndistrict court did not err when it denied Mr. Purkey's motion for a mistrial.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -33-\n\f                                V.\nAccordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.\n                     ______________________\n\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f</pre>",
