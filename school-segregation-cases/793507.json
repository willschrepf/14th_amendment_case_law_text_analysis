(Del Monte) appeals from the trial\n\ncourt‟s order granting summary judgment to Dayka & Hackett, LLC (D&H) on its claims\n\nof lien priority and conversion regarding the proceeds from the sale of Rolando Castelo\n\nde la Rosa and Maria Olivia Aguirre Ramos‟s (growers) 2008 table grape crop. Del\n\nMonte argues its security interest in the crop had priority over D&H‟s security interest in\n\nthe same collateral, it had a right of recoupment pursuant to A.R.S. § 47-9404(A)(1), it\n\ndid not engage in conversion because it had acted in accordance with A.R.S. §§ 47-9610\n\nand 47-9615, and D&H had permitted it to sell the collateral without first having made a\n\ndemand for possession. We affirm.\n\n                         Factual and Procedural Background\n\n¶2            We view the facts in the light most favorable to the party against whom\n\nsummary judgment was entered, drawing all justifiable inferences in its favor. Modular\n\nMining Sys., Inc. v. Jigsaw Techs., Inc., 221 Ariz. 515, ¶ 2, 212 P.3d 853, 855 (App.\n\n2009). In January 2007, D&H agreed to finance and sell the growers‟ 2007 grape crop to\n\nbe grown in Sonora, Mexico. D&H entered into marketing and security agreements with\n\nthe growers and, on January 18, 2007, it filed a financing statement pursuant to A.R.S.\n\n§ 47-9307(C) in Washington, D.C. to perfect its interest. The security agreement granted\n\nD&H an interest in the 2007 and any future crops the growers produced together with any\n\nproceeds generated by the sale of the crops. The 2007 grape crop was not profitable and\n\n                                            2\n\fthe growers were unable to repay to D&H what they owed. The growers subsequently\n\ndefaulted on their obligations to D&H, eventually owing $688,587.71.\n\n¶3            Del Monte, unaware of the relationship between the growers and D&H,\n\nadvanced the growers funds to produce their 2008 crop. After conducting a lien search of\n\nthe public registry in Sonora, Del Monte entered into a marketing and security agreement\n\nwith the growers. Under its marketing agreement, Del Monte was obligated to market\n\nand sell the crop it was advancing the growers funds to raise, and to pay the growers a\n\nportion of the sales proceeds. The growers granted Del Monte a security interest in\n\ncollateral, which included the 2008 crop and any proceeds from its sale. In May 2008,\n\nDel Monte registered its security interest with the public registry in Sonora.\n\n¶4            On April 24, 2008, D&H sent Del Monte a letter informing Del Monte of\n\nits security interest in the growers‟ crops. Del Monte responded with a letter on May 14,\n\n2008 asserting a superior interest in the crops. Del Monte marketed the 2008 crop and\n\ncollected and retained all the sales proceeds.\n\n¶5            D&H filed a complaint against the growers and Del Monte seeking to\n\nenforce its security interest in the growers‟ 2008 crop and its proceeds. The trial court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of D&H on its conversion claim and awarded it\n\ndamages of $688,587.71, the amount the growers owed D&H.                The judgment also\n\ndeclared D&H‟s security interest in the 2008 crop and proceeds to be superior to Del\n\nMonte‟s interest and denied Del Monte‟s asserted right of recoupment. The court denied\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fDel Monte‟s motion for reconsideration and entered a final judgment pursuant to\n\nRule 54(b), Ariz. R. Civ. P. This appeal followed.\n\n                                         Discussion\n\n¶6              Summary judgment is appropriate when “there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” Ariz.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(c)(1). And a trial court should grant a motion for summary judgment “if the\n\nfacts produced in support of the claim or defense have so little probative value, given the\n\nquantum of evidence required, that reasonable people could not agree with the conclusion\n\nadvanced by the proponent of the claim or defense.” Orme Sch. v. Reeves, 166 Ariz. 301,\n\n309, 802 P.2d 1000, 1008 (1990). “On appeal from a summary judgment, we must\n\ndetermine de novo whether there are any genuine issues of material fact and whether the\n\ntrial court erred in applying the law.” Bothell v. Two Point Acres, Inc., 192 Ariz. 313,\n\n¶ 8, 965 P.2d 47, 50 (App. 1998).\n\nPriority\n\n¶7              Del Monte argues its security interest in the 2008 crop was superior to and\n\nhad priority over D&H‟s security interest because D&H did not perfect its interest by\n\ntaking possession of the collateral or by filing notice of its interest in a proper\n\njurisdiction.    D&H recorded its security interest with the Registrar of Deeds in\n\nWashington, D.C., on January 18, 2007. Del Monte recorded its security agreement in\n\nMexico‟s Real Property Registry and Movables Registry on May 7, 2008 in Hermosillo,\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fSonora, Mexico. To assess which party‟s filing was effective to perfect its interest and\n\ngive it priority, we must determine whether United States or Mexican law applies.\n\n¶8            The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as adopted in Arizona provides\n\nthat, “while a debtor is located in a jurisdiction, the local law of that jurisdiction governs\n\nperfection . . . and the priority of a security interest in collateral.” A.R.S. § 47-9301(1).\n\nAn individual generally “is located at the individual‟s principal residence,” A.R.S.\n\n§ 47-9307(B)(1), and it is undisputed that the growers are residents of Sonora, Mexico.\n\nHowever, § 47-9307(B) applies only if:\n\n              [the] debtor‟s residence . . . is located in a jurisdiction whose\n              law generally requires information concerning the existence\n              of a nonpossessory security interest to be made generally\n              available in a filing, recording or registration system as a\n              condition or result of the security interest‟s obtaining priority\n              over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the collateral.\n\n§ 47-9307(C). If the requirements of § 47-9307(C) are not met, the debtor is considered\n\nto be “located in the District of Columbia.” Id.\n\n¶9            Therefore, whether priority is determined by United States or Mexican law\n\ndepends on whether, during the relevant time period, Mexican law “generally require[d]”\n\nsuch information “to be made generally available in a filing, recording or registration\n\nsystem” in order to obtain priority. See id. To determine whether Mexico‟s law meets\n\nthe test in § 47-9307(C), we “may consider any relevant material or source, including\n\ntestimony.” Ariz. R. Civ. P. 44.1. The issue is treated as a question of law, id., which we\n\nreview de novo, Green v. Lisa Frank, Inc., 221 Ariz. 138, ¶ 48, 211 P.3d 16, 33 (App.\n\n2009).\n                                              5\n\f¶10            Both parties presented expert testimony regarding whether Mexican law\n\nduring the relevant period satisfied the conditions set forth in § 47-9307(C). D&H expert\n\nDale Furnish has authored articles and book chapters on Mexican law, has consulted with\n\nthe Mexican government regarding the amendment of its laws, and has assisted in\n\ndrafting Arizona‟s secured transactions laws and the Organization of American States\n\nmodel on secured transactions. According to Furnish, Mexican law in 2007 and 2008\n\nwas a “crazy quilt” of different security devices that did not meet the requirements of\n\n§ 47-9307(C). Checking public records in Mexico provided no assurance of the priority\n\nof an interest because it was “possible for several common types of credit guaranties to\n\nbe unrecorded, and still gain priority over even a recorded security interest.” According\n\nto Furnish, one of the major flaws in the Mexican registration system preventing the\n\ngrowers from being “located” in Mexico is that it did not include a provision stating it\n\napplied to any device acting in practical effect as a security interest.\n\n¶11            D&H expert Ramón Bringas Acedo has practiced law in Mexico for over\n\ntwenty-eight years representing borrowers, growers, finance companies, and distributors\n\nin crop-financing transactions.       He agreed that Mexican law does not “generally\n\nrequire[]” filing as described in § 47-9307(C), noting that a financer like Del Monte, to\n\nperfect its interest in a crop, need only “notify any third party who may be in possession\n\nof that same fruit . . . such that perfection of the guaranty . . . is not the result of recording\n\nin any registry but rather by way of notification.”\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f¶12             Amendments to Mexico‟s laws in 2009 recognized and defined a “security\n\ninterest,” created a single federal registry for recording security interests, and generally\n\nrequired that all security interests be recorded in the federal registry. Furnish offered that\n\nthe Mexican system before the 2009 amendments “resemble[d] the United States system\n\nprior to the 1962 advent of UCC Article 9.” Both Furnish and Bringas Acedo opined that\n\nonce the 2009 amendments are implemented they will, for the first time, create a system\n\nthat “„generally requires‟ recording to establish priority between competing claims or\n\nsecurity interests in personal property.”\n\n¶13             Furnish added that “[e]very authoritative source available agrees that\n\nMexico did not have . . . a law” satisfying § 47-9307(C) in 2007 and 2008. For example,\n\nhe discussed a 2008 article in evidence authored by Arnold S. Rosenberg and published\n\nin the book Practice Under Article 9 of the UCC by the UCC Committee of the American\n\nBar Association (ABA). The article classified foreign filing systems into category “A”—\n\njurisdictions clearly satisfying the test in U.C.C. § 9-307(c)1—through category “D”—\n\njurisdictions that clearly fail the test. It classified Mexico as a category “D” jurisdiction\n\nbecause “filing is a sufficient but unnecessary step due to the existence of alternative\n\nmethods of perfecting the secured party‟s interest without filing.”\n\n¶14             Additional authority supports Furnish‟s and Bringas Acedo‟s conclusions.\n\nA 2006 article by Rosenberg reiterates the concern that “Mexican law recognizes various\n\ntypes of nonpossessory security devices in personal property that do not require\n\n       1\n           U.C.C. § 9-307(c) is the equivalent of Arizona‟s § 47-9307(C).\n                                              7\n\fregistration yet may take priority over lien creditors and registered nonpossessory\n\npledges.” Arnold S. Rosenberg, Where to File Against Non-U.S. Debtors: Applying UCC\n\n§ 9-307(c) [Rev] to Foreign Filing, Recording, and Registration Systems, 39 UCC L.J.,\n\nno. 2, 2006, art. 1. A 2004 article recognized that “current mechanisms [in Mexico]\n\nundermine secured transactions . . . [and] create secret liens, making it difficult for a\n\nsecured party to determine if potential debtor‟s assets are encumbered.”         Alejandro\n\nLopez-Velarde & John M. Wilson, A Practical Point-by-Point Comparison of Secured\n\nTransactions Law in the United States and Mexico, 36 UCC L.J., no. 4, 2004, art. 1. And\n\na recent article by Furnish noted that, even after reforms in 2003, “the pre-existing secret\n\nliens and diverse security mechanisms continued unabated.” Dale Beck Furnish, The\n\nImpact of the Organization of American States Model Law of Secured Transactions in\n\nLatin America: The First Decade, 43 UCC L.J., no. 4, 2011, art. 1. Another article\n\ndiscussing the 2009 reforms noted that one motivation was Mexican companies‟\n\ndifficulty attracting secured lending from the United States “because of concerns as to the\n\nreliability of Mexican . . . systems for filing and perfecting security interests . . . in\n\npersonal . . . property or goods.” John E. Rogers & Ramiro Rangel, Mexico’s Unified\n\nSecured Transactions Registry: Implications for Secured Lending, Bankruptcy and\n\nCross-Border Filings (U.C.C. § 9-307), 43 UCC L.J., no. 4, 2011, art. 3. The authors\n\nsuggested Mexico‟s recent reforms may bring it into compliance with U.C.C. § 9-307(c)\n\nand “may require U.S. lenders relying on accounts receivable collateral . . . to re-examine\n\ntheir reliance on the filing of a UCC-1 financing statement in the District of Columbia\n\n                                             8\n\fpursuant to U.C.C. § 9-307(c),” noting “the traditional method of perfecting such security\n\ninterests” has been to file with the Recorder of Deeds in the District of Columbia. Id.\n\n¶15           Del Monte expert Steven Weise specializes in UCC secured transactions.\n\nHe was the chairperson of the ABA committee on Article 9, and is a member of the\n\neditorial board for the UCC. He is not an expert on Mexican law, and based his opinions\n\non the testimony of Bringas Acedo, Furnish, and a Mexican attorney hired by Del Monte.\n\nAlthough he deferred to the interpretation of Mexican law offered by other experts,\n\nWeise testified that, pursuant to § 47-9307(C), a jurisdiction‟s registration system should\n\nbe examined with regard to the specific collateral at issue, rather than for nonpossessory\n\nsecured interests as a whole.        Based on his interpretation of the other experts‟\n\ndescriptions of the Mexican system, he contended the Mexican security interest devices\n\ndiscussed by Bringas Acedo were either similar to the UCC or irrelevant to grape crops.\n\nHe further opined that, based on his conversations with Del Monte‟s Mexican attorney, a\n\nsecurity interest in crops must be filed in Mexico to gain priority over third parties.2\n\n¶16           Del Monte urges us to accept Weise‟s interpretation of § 47-9307(C) as\n\ncollateral-specific. There is no Arizona case law addressing the issue. One article by\n\nRosenberg on the topic acknowledged it is an “unsettled question” whether U.C.C.\n\n§ 9-307(c) should be interpreted to require a system for the specific collateral or for\n\n\n       2\n        Portions of Weise‟s declaration suggest it is relevant that filing was available or\nsufficient in Mexico in some circumstances. However, to satisfy § 47-9307(C), a\njurisdiction must “generally require[]” filing as a condition of obtaining priority, not\nmerely allow it.\n                                              9\n\fnonpossessory security interests as a whole, but noted a comprehensive test is the more\n\nlikely interpretation. Rosenberg, Where to File, supra. One reason supporting this\n\nprediction is that U.C.C. § 9-307 cmt. 3 appears to support a comprehensive\n\ninterpretation of the phrase “generally requires,”3 stating in relevant part:\n\n              The phrase “generally requires” is meant to include legal\n              regimes that generally require notice in a filing or recording\n              system as a condition of perfecting nonpossessory security\n              interests, but which permit perfection by another method . . .\n              in limited circumstances. A jurisdiction that has adopted this\n              Article or an earlier version of this Article is such a\n              jurisdiction.\n\n¶17           Policy implications also favor interpreting § 47-9307(C) as requiring the\n\njurisdiction‟s system to satisfy the test generally. One risk of a comprehensive test is\n\nthat, if a jurisdiction‟s system satisfies § 47-9307(C) generally but leaves a void for a\n\nparticular type of collateral, a lender could find it impossible to perfect a security interest\n\nin that type of collateral because it would be required to file in that jurisdiction. See\n\nRosenberg, Where to File, supra.          However, a comprehensive approach “has the\n\nadvantage of clarity and might reduce transaction costs,” and a collateral-specific\n\napproach would require secured parties “to retain foreign counsel in almost all cases to\n\nascertain foreign law on the subject.” Id. As noted in Rosenberg‟s 2008 article, admitted\n\nin evidence during Furnish‟s testimony, under a collateral-specific approach a debtor\n\n\n       3\n        Although Del Monte argues the phrase “with respect to the collateral” in\n§ 47-9307(C) favors a collateral-specific approach, we think it more likely the phrase\nmerely refers to the “rights of a lien creditor” in collateral and does not modify the earlier\nclause, especially when read in conjunction with U.C.C. § 9-307 cmt. 3.\n                                              10\n\fcould be “located” in more than one jurisdiction and, “in a single transaction, a secured\n\nparty might have to file in the limited-purpose registry to perfect as to some security\n\ninterests or collateral, while having to file in the District of Columbia to perfect as to\n\nothers.”   For these reasons, and based on the comments to the UCC, we interpret\n\n§ 47-9307(C) to adopt the comprehensive approach, requiring a system for perfecting\n\nnonpossessory security interests as a whole.\n\n¶18            The expert testimony and secondary authority on the topic establish that\n\nMexico‟s law in 2007 and 2008 did not meet the requirements of § 47-9307(C) and,\n\ntherefore, the growers for the purpose of perfecting security interests in their property\n\nwere located in the District of Columbia pursuant to the statute. Thus, D&H perfected its\n\nsecurity interest by filing in the District of Columbia, and its security interest in the 2008\n\ncrop and its proceeds had priority over Del Monte‟s conflicting, unperfected security\n\ninterest. See A.R.S. § 47-9322(A)(2) (“A perfected security interest . . . has priority over\n\na conflicting unperfected security interest . . . .”).\n\nConversion\n\n¶19            Del Monte argues it cannot be liable for conversion because it sold the\n\ngrapes and applied the proceeds following the growers‟ default in accordance with\n\nA.R.S. §§ 47-9610 and 47-9615. Del Monte contends the growers defaulted on their\n\nobligations to it by breaching the marketing agreement. Section 47-9610 entitles a\n\nsecured party to dispose of collateral upon default and § 47-9615 provides for disposition\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fof the cash proceeds.       We conclude, however, under these circumstances neither\n\n§§ 47-9610 nor 47-9615 preclude liability for conversion.\n\n¶20           The official comments to the UCC note that non-UCC law governs a junior\n\nsecured party‟s liability to a senior secured party for conversion when the junior party is\n\nin possession of collateral, noting that normally “a junior who refuses to relinquish\n\npossession of collateral upon the demand of a secured party having a superior possessory\n\nright . . . would be liable in conversion.” U.C.C. § 9-609 cmt. 5 (2001). Conversion is\n\n“„an act of wrongful dominion or control over personal property in denial of or\n\ninconsistent with the rights of another.‟” Case Corp. v. Gehrke, 208 Ariz. 140, ¶ 11, 91\n\nP.3d 362, 365 (App. 2004), quoting Sears Consumer Fin. Corp. v. Thunderbird Prods.,\n\n166 Ariz. 333, 335, 802 P.2d 1032, 1034 (App. 1990). Because a secured party has a\n\nright to take possession of collateral on default, its possessory interest is sufficient to\n\nmaintain an action for conversion. Id. And money “can be the subject of a conversion\n\nclaim if the money „can be described, identified or segregated, and an obligation to treat\n\nit in a specific manner is established.‟” Id., quoting Autoville, Inc. v. Friedman, 20 Ariz.\n\nApp. 89, 91, 510 P.2d 400, 402 (App. 1973). A secured party also can bring a conversion\n\naction against third parties that interfere with its rights in the collateral. Sears, 166 Ariz.\n\nat 335, 802 P.2d at 1034.\n\n¶21           The growers defaulted on their obligations to D&H by failing to pay D&H\n\nand by pledging collateral to Del Monte without D&H‟s consent. D&H explicitly had a\n\nsecurity interest both in the growers‟ future crops and any proceeds from those crops.\n\n                                              12\n\fWhen the growers defaulted, D&H had the right under the security agreement to demand\n\npayment and take possession of the collateral. The growers already had defaulted on\n\ntheir obligations to D&H when Del Monte took possession of the crops, sold them, and\n\nretained the sales proceeds. By doing so, Del Monte interfered with D&H‟s rights to the\n\ncollateral and its proceeds and D&H had a valid conversion claim. See Sears, 166 Ariz.\n\nat 335, 802 P.2d at 1034; see also Gehrke, 208 Ariz. 140, ¶ 11, 91 P.3d at 365.\n\nMoreover, the proceeds from the sale of the crops properly are the subject of D&H‟s\n\nconversion claim because they are identifiable and because D&H‟s security agreement\n\nwith the growers required them to pay D&H the proceeds from the sale of the collateral.\n\nSee Gehrke, 208 Ariz. 140, ¶ 11, 91 P.3d at 365 (money can be subject of conversion\n\nclaim if it can be described, identified, and obligation to treat in specific manner\n\nestablished); see also Empire Fire & Marine Ins. Co. v. First Nat’l Bank of Ariz., 26 Ariz.\n\nApp. 157, 159, 546 P.2d 1166, 1168 (1976) (sale of vehicle by dealer and retention of\n\nproceeds constituted conversion where bank had both security interest in vehicle and\n\nright to possession upon default). Accordingly, Del Monte properly was held liable for\n\nconversion of the crop‟s sales proceeds.\n\n¶22           Sections 47-9610 and 47-9615 do not alter the result here. A secured party\n\nis entitled to take possession of the collateral after default, A.R.S. § 47-9609, dispose of\n\nthe collateral, § 47-9610, and apply the proceeds of the disposition, § 47-9615. Because\n\nmore than one secured party may be entitled to possession of collateral, conflicting rights\n\namong secured parties are resolved by the priority rules. See U.C.C. § 9-609 cmt. 5 (“[A]\n\n                                            13\n\fsenior secured party is entitled to possession as against a junior claimant.”). Here, D&H\n\nand Del Monte each had a security interest in the collateral and proceeds. And the\n\ngrowers defaulted on their agreements with both. But, as discussed above, D&H‟s\n\nsecurity interest had priority over Del Monte‟s and D&H was entitled to dispose of the\n\ncollateral and apply the proceeds pursuant to §§ 47-9610 and 47-9615. Del Monte‟s\n\ninterference with that right constituted conversion. See Gehrke, 208 Ariz. 140, ¶ 11, 91\n\nP.3d at 365.\n\n¶23            Del Monte contends the official comment five to U.C.C. § 9-610 precludes\n\nliability for conversion. We disagree. Comment five states: “The exercise of [the right\n\nto dispose of collateral after default] by a secured party whose security interest is\n\nsubordinate to that of another secured party does not of itself constitute a conversion or\n\notherwise give rise to liability in favor of the holder of the senior security interest.”\n\nU.C.C. § 9-610 cmt. 5 (2001). This is so because normally “the disposition by a junior\n\nwould not cut off a senior‟s security interest” and “the junior‟s receipt of the cash\n\nproceeds would not violate the rights of the senior,” instead the senior‟s secured interest\n\n“ordinarily will survive the disposition by the junior.” Id. But here, although D&H‟s\n\nrights in the crops were cut off when Del Monte sold them, D&H also had rights to the\n\nsales proceeds, which survived the sale, and Del Monte violated those rights by retaining\n\nthose proceeds. See 7 U.S.C. § 1631(d) (buyer of farm product in ordinary course of\n\nbusiness takes free of security interest). Moreover, the same comment further provides\n\n“[t]he holder of a senior security interest is entitled, by virtue of its priority, to take\n\n                                            14\n\fpossession of collateral from the junior secured party and conduct its own disposition”\n\nfollowing default. U.C.C. § 9-610 cmt. 5. And “[i]t is well settled that a secured\n\ncreditor, upon default of the debtor, has an immediate right to possession of the\n\ncollateral” and can maintain an action for conversion if the collateral is transferred.\n\nCiticorp Homeowners, Inc. v. Western Sur. Co., 131 Ariz. 334, 336, 641 P.2d 248, 250\n\n(App. 1981). D&H was entitled to possession of the collateral but Del Monte discharged\n\nD&H‟s interest by selling the collateral and retaining the proceeds.\n\n¶24           Del Monte further contends it cannot be liable for conversion because D&H\n\nencouraged it to sell the grapes and did not demand possession. But D&H was entitled to\n\nimmediate possession of the collateral upon default and that right is sufficient to maintain\n\nan action for conversion. See Gehrke, 208 Ariz. 140, ¶ 11, 91 P.3d at 365. And the\n\nauthority Del Monte cites does not suggest a claim for conversion is precluded if a senior\n\nsecured party fails to demand possession of the collateral under circumstances similar to\n\nthose presented here. See Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Gen. Elec. Credit Corp., 119 Ariz. 97,\n\n100, 579 P.2d 601, 604 (App. 1978) (no possessory interest to support conversion claim\n\nwhere secured party expressed desire not to assert possessory interest and filed claim\n\njoining in request for appointment of receiver to assume possession of inventory); W.\n\nCoach Corp. v. Kincheloe, 24 Ariz. App. 55, 58, 535 P.2d 1059, 1062 (1975) (demand\n\nand refusal required for conversion action where defendants “had not dealt with the\n\n[collateral] in a manner inconsistent with the rights of the one entitled to possession”).\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\f¶25          Moreover, the record reflects D&H did demand possession of the collateral.\n\nIn its April 24 letter, D&H notified Del Monte it was “entitled to take possession of the\n\ngrape crop and the proceeds of its sale.”       And it “insist[ed] that steps be taken\n\nimmediately to acknowledge [its] interest and that a means be agreed upon to protect its\n\ninterest by payment from the current season‟s sale proceeds.”            The letter clearly\n\nexpressed D&H‟s security interest in both the collateral and any proceeds from its sale.\n\nAnd as the trial court noted, Del Monte acted wrongfully by retaining the sales proceeds.\n\nTherefore, because Del Monte exercised control over the grape crops and retained the\n\nsales proceeds in a manner inconsistent with D&H‟s senior security interest in those\n\ncrops and proceeds, the trial court did not err in awarding D&H summary judgment on\n\nthe conversion claim. See Gehrke, 208 Ariz. 140, ¶ 11, 91 P.3d at 365.\n\nRight of Recoupment\n\n¶26          Del Monte further argues that, even if its security interest was inferior to\n\nD&H‟s security interest, it is entitled pursuant to A.R.S. § 47-9404 to a right of\n\nrecoupment under its marketing agreement with the growers. Section 47-9404(A)(1)\n\nprovides that the rights of an assignee are subject to “[a]ll terms of the agreement\n\nbetween the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising\n\nfrom the transaction that gave rise to the contract.” Del Monte contends the growers\n\nwere the “assignors” and D&H was the “assignee” because the growers had granted\n\nD&H a security interest in the crops and proceeds. Del Monte further contends it is the\n\n“account debtor” because it was obligated to pay the growers the sales proceeds from the\n\n                                           16\n\fgrapes it sold.4 Consequently, it asserts, under § 47-9404, D&H‟s rights are subject to\n\nthe agreement between Del Monte and the growers, which included a right of\n\nrecoupment.\n\n¶27           The trial court concluded that § 47-9404 did not apply because “[Del\n\nMonte] is not suing to enforce an assignment of Grower‟s rights under the [marketing\n\nagreement].” We agree. Section 47-9404 does not apply in actions for conversion\n\nbecause “the basis for a conversion [action] is the secured party‟s superior property\n\ninterest in the inventory itself, not the assignment of the account held by the debtor.”\n\nUnited States v. Handy & Harman, 750 F.2d 777, 786 (9th Cir. 1984). Here, D&H\n\nbrought a conversion action against Del Monte asserting its superior security interest in\n\nthe grape crops and their sales proceeds. It did not assert an interest in the growers‟\n\naccount with Del Monte, instead asserting an interest in the crops and proceeds.\n\nTherefore, D&H was not “merely the assignee of an account against which setoffs are\n\ngenerally permissible,” rather it had a senior security interest in the crops and their sales\n\nproceeds. See In re Commercial Reprographics, Inc., 95 B.R. 174, 180 (Bankr. E.D. Cal.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        Del Monte contends the trial court erred in relying on J.R. Simplot Co. v. Sales\nKing Int’l, Inc., 17 P.3d 1100 (Utah 2000), because that court, Del Monte asserts,\n“plainly misunderstood the roles of the parties” and the terms “account debtor,”\n“assignor,” and “assignee.” However, this argument is not relevant here because we\ndetermine § 47-9404 is inapplicable.\n                                             17\n\f1988) (discussing Handy & Harman). Therefore, § 47-9404 does not entitle Del Monte\n\nto a right of recoupment against D&H‟s claim for conversion.5\n\n                                      Disposition\n\n¶28           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm. Both parties request attorney fees on\n\nappeal pursuant to A.R.S. § 12-341.01(A). We grant D&H, as the prevailing party in this\n\ncontract action, its reasonable attorney fees upon its compliance with Rule 21, Ariz. R.\n\nCiv. App. P. We remand this matter to the trial court to take action consistent with this\n\ndecision and address any remaining issues, including any motion for sanctions pursuant\n\nto Rule 68, Ariz. R. Civ. P.\n\n\n\n\n                                         /s/ J. William Brammer, Jr.\n                                         J. WILLIAM BRAMMER, JR., Judge\n\n\nCONCURRING:\n\n\n\n/s/ Peter J.

Because we affirm the judgment, we deny Del Monte‟s\nrequest to vacate the attorney fee award.\n                                           18\n\f",

In January 2007, D&H agreed to finance and sell the growers‟ 2007 grape crop to\n\nbe grown in Sonora, Mexico. D&H entered into marketing and security agreements with\n\nthe growers and, on January 18, 2007, it filed a financing statement pursuant to A.R.S.\n\n§ 47-9307(C) in Washington, D.C. to perfect its interest. The security agreement granted\n\nD&H an interest in the 2007 and any future crops the growers produced together with any\n\nproceeds generated by the sale of the crops. The 2007 grape crop was not profitable and\n\n                                            2\n\fthe growers were unable to repay to D&H what they owed. The growers subsequently\n\ndefaulted on their obligations to D&H, eventually owing $688,587.71.\n\n¶3            Del Monte, unaware of the relationship between the growers and D&H,\n\nadvanced the growers funds to produce their 2008 crop. After conducting a lien search of\n\nthe public registry in Sonora, Del Monte entered into a marketing and security agreement\n\nwith the growers. Under its marketing agreement, Del Monte was obligated to market\n\nand sell the crop it was advancing the growers funds to raise, and to pay the growers a\n\nportion of the sales proceeds. The growers granted Del Monte a security interest in\n\ncollateral, which included the 2008 crop and any proceeds from its sale. In May 2008,\n\nDel Monte registered its security interest with the public registry in Sonora.\n\n¶4            On April 24, 2008, D&H sent Del Monte a letter informing Del Monte of\n\nits security interest in the growers‟ crops. Del Monte responded with a letter on May 14,\n\n2008 asserting a superior interest in the crops. Del Monte marketed the 2008 crop and\n\ncollected and retained all the sales proceeds.\n\n¶5            D&H filed a complaint against the growers and Del Monte seeking to\n\nenforce its security interest in the growers‟ 2008 crop and its proceeds. The trial court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of D&H on its conversion claim and awarded it\n\ndamages of $688,587.71, the amount the growers owed D&H.                The judgment also\n\ndeclared D&H‟s security interest in the 2008 crop and proceeds to be superior to Del\n\nMonte‟s interest and denied Del Monte‟s asserted right of recoupment. The court denied\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fDel Monte‟s motion for reconsideration and entered a final judgment pursuant to\n\nRule 54(b), Ariz. R. Civ. P.

And a trial court should grant a motion for summary judgment “if the\n\nfacts produced in support of the claim or defense have so little probative value, given the\n\nquantum of evidence required, that reasonable people could not agree with the conclusion\n\nadvanced by the proponent of the claim or defense.” Orme Sch. v.

D&H recorded its security interest with the Registrar of Deeds in\n\nWashington, D.C., on January 18, 2007. Del Monte recorded its security agreement in\n\nMexico‟s Real Property Registry and Movables Registry on May 7, 2008 in Hermosillo,\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fSonora, Mexico. To assess which party‟s filing was effective to perfect its interest and\n\ngive it priority, we must determine whether United States or Mexican law applies.\n\n¶8            The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as adopted in Arizona provides\n\nthat, “while a debtor is located in a jurisdiction, the local law of that jurisdiction governs\n\nperfection . . . and the priority of a security interest in collateral.” A.R.S. § 47-9301(1).\n\nAn individual generally “is located at the individual‟s principal residence,” A.R.S.\n\n§ 47-9307(B)(1), and it is undisputed that the growers are residents of Sonora, Mexico.\n\nHowever, § 47-9307(B) applies only if:\n\n              [the] debtor‟s residence . . . is located in a jurisdiction whose\n              law generally requires information concerning the existence\n              of a nonpossessory security interest to be made generally\n              available in a filing, recording or registration system as a\n              condition or result of the security interest‟s obtaining priority\n              over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the collateral.\n\n§ 47-9307(C). If the requirements of § 47-9307(C) are not met, the debtor is considered\n\nto be “located in the District of Columbia.” Id.\n\n¶9            Therefore, whether priority is determined by United States or Mexican law\n\ndepends on whether, during the relevant time period, Mexican law “generally require[d]”\n\nsuch information “to be made generally available in a filing, recording or registration\n\nsystem” in order to obtain priority. See id. To determine whether Mexico‟s law meets\n\nthe test in § 47-9307(C), we “may consider any relevant material or source, including\n\ntestimony.” Ariz. R. Civ. P. 44.1.

D&H expert\n\nDale Furnish has authored articles and book chapters on Mexican law, has consulted with\n\nthe Mexican government regarding the amendment of its laws, and has assisted in\n\ndrafting Arizona‟s secured transactions laws and the Organization of American States\n\nmodel on secured transactions. According to Furnish, Mexican law in 2007 and 2008\n\nwas a “crazy quilt” of different security devices that did not meet the requirements of\n\n§ 47-9307(C). Checking public records in Mexico provided no assurance of the priority\n\nof an interest because it was “possible for several common types of credit guaranties to\n\nbe unrecorded, and still gain priority over even a recorded security interest.” According\n\nto Furnish, one of the major flaws in the Mexican registration system preventing the\n\ngrowers from being “located” in Mexico is that it did not include a provision stating it\n\napplied to any device acting in practical effect as a security interest.\n\n¶11            D&H expert Ramón Bringas Acedo has practiced law in Mexico for over\n\ntwenty-eight years representing borrowers, growers, finance companies, and distributors\n\nin crop-financing transactions.       He agreed that Mexican law does not “generally\n\nrequire[]” filing as described in § 47-9307(C), noting that a financer like Del Monte, to\n\nperfect its interest in a crop, need only “notify any third party who may be in possession\n\nof that same fruit . . . such that perfection of the guaranty . . . is not the result of recording\n\nin any registry but rather by way of notification.”\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\f¶12             Amendments to Mexico‟s laws in 2009 recognized and defined a “security\n\ninterest,” created a single federal registry for recording security interests, and generally\n\nrequired that all security interests be recorded in the federal registry. Furnish offered that\n\nthe Mexican system before the 2009 amendments “resemble[d] the United States system\n\nprior to the 1962 advent of UCC Article 9.” Both Furnish and Bringas Acedo opined that\n\nonce the 2009 amendments are implemented they will, for the first time, create a system\n\nthat “„generally requires‟ recording to establish priority between competing claims or\n\nsecurity interests in personal property.”\n\n¶13             Furnish added that “[e]very authoritative source available agrees that\n\nMexico did not have . . . a law” satisfying § 47-9307(C) in 2007 and 2008. For example,\n\nhe discussed a 2008 article in evidence authored by Arnold S. Rosenberg and published\n\nin the book Practice Under Article 9 of the UCC by the UCC Committee of the American\n\nBar Association (ABA). The article classified foreign filing systems into category “A”—\n\njurisdictions clearly satisfying the test in U.C.C. § 9-307(c)1—through category “D”—\n\njurisdictions that clearly fail the test. It classified Mexico as a category “D” jurisdiction\n\nbecause “filing is a sufficient but unnecessary step due to the existence of alternative\n\nmethods of perfecting the secured party‟s interest without filing.”\n\n¶14             Additional authority supports Furnish‟s and Bringas Acedo‟s conclusions.\n\nA 2006 article by Rosenberg reiterates the concern that “Mexican law recognizes various\n\ntypes of nonpossessory security devices in personal property that do not require\n\n       1\n           U.C.C. § 9-307(c) is the equivalent of Arizona‟s § 47-9307(C).\n                                              7\n\fregistration yet may take priority over lien creditors and registered nonpossessory\n\npledges.” Arnold S.

A 2004 article recognized that “current mechanisms [in Mexico]\n\nundermine secured transactions . . .

Another article\n\ndiscussing the 2009 reforms noted that one motivation was Mexican companies‟\n\ndifficulty attracting secured lending from the United States “because of concerns as to the\n\nreliability of Mexican . . . systems for filing and perfecting security interests . . . in\n\npersonal . . . property or goods.” John E. Rogers & Ramiro Rangel, Mexico’s Unified\n\nSecured Transactions Registry: Implications for Secured Lending, Bankruptcy and\n\nCross-Border Filings (U.C.C. § 9-307), 43 UCC L.J., no. 4, 2011, art. 3. The authors\n\nsuggested Mexico‟s recent reforms may bring it into compliance with U.C.C. § 9-307(c)\n\nand “may require U.S. lenders relying on accounts receivable collateral . . . to re-examine\n\ntheir reliance on the filing of a UCC-1 financing statement in the District of Columbia\n\n                                             8\n\fpursuant to U.C.C. § 9-307(c),” noting “the traditional method of perfecting such security\n\ninterests” has been to file with the Recorder of Deeds in the District of Columbia. Id.\n\n¶15           Del Monte expert Steven Weise specializes in UCC secured transactions.\n\nHe was the chairperson of the ABA committee on Article 9, and is a member of the\n\neditorial board for the UCC. He is not an expert on Mexican law, and based his opinions\n\non the testimony of Bringas Acedo, Furnish, and a Mexican attorney hired by Del Monte.\n\nAlthough he deferred to the interpretation of Mexican law offered by other experts,\n\nWeise testified that, pursuant to § 47-9307(C), a jurisdiction‟s registration system should\n\nbe examined with regard to the specific collateral at issue, rather than for nonpossessory\n\nsecured interests as a whole.        Based on his interpretation of the other experts‟\n\ndescriptions of the Mexican system, he contended the Mexican security interest devices\n\ndiscussed by Bringas Acedo were either similar to the UCC or irrelevant to grape crops.\n\nHe further opined that, based on his conversations with Del Monte‟s Mexican attorney, a\n\nsecurity interest in crops must be filed in Mexico to gain priority over third parties.2\n\n¶16           Del Monte urges us to accept Weise‟s interpretation of § 47-9307(C) as\n\ncollateral-specific. There is no Arizona case law addressing the issue. One article by\n\nRosenberg on the topic acknowledged it is an “unsettled question” whether U.C.C.\n\n§ 9-307(c) should be interpreted to require a system for the specific collateral or for\n\n\n       2\n        Portions of Weise‟s declaration suggest it is relevant that filing was available or\nsufficient in Mexico in some circumstances. However, to satisfy § 47-9307(C), a\njurisdiction must “generally require[]” filing as a condition of obtaining priority, not\nmerely allow it.\n                                              9\n\fnonpossessory security interests as a whole, but noted a comprehensive test is the more\n\nlikely interpretation. Rosenberg, Where to File, supra. One reason supporting this\n\nprediction is that U.C.C. § 9-307 cmt. 3 appears to support a comprehensive\n\ninterpretation of the phrase “generally requires,”3 stating in relevant part:\n\n              The phrase “generally requires” is meant to include legal\n              regimes that generally require notice in a filing or recording\n              system as a condition of perfecting nonpossessory security\n              interests, but which permit perfection by another method . . .\n              in limited circumstances. A jurisdiction that has adopted this\n              Article or an earlier version of this Article is such a\n              jurisdiction.\n\n¶17           Policy implications also favor interpreting § 47-9307(C) as requiring the\n\njurisdiction‟s system to satisfy the test generally. One risk of a comprehensive test is\n\nthat, if a jurisdiction‟s system satisfies § 47-9307(C) generally but leaves a void for a\n\nparticular type of collateral, a lender could find it impossible to perfect a security interest\n\nin that type of collateral because it would be required to file in that jurisdiction. See\n\nRosenberg, Where to File, supra.          However, a comprehensive approach “has the\n\nadvantage of clarity and might reduce transaction costs,” and a collateral-specific\n\napproach would require secured parties “to retain foreign counsel in almost all cases to\n\nascertain foreign law on the subject.” Id. As noted in Rosenberg‟s 2008 article, admitted\n\nin evidence during Furnish‟s testimony, under a collateral-specific approach a debtor\n\n\n       3\n        Although Del Monte argues the phrase “with respect to the collateral” in\n§ 47-9307(C) favors a collateral-specific approach, we think it more likely the phrase\nmerely refers to the “rights of a lien creditor” in collateral and does not modify the earlier\nclause, especially when read in conjunction with U.C.C. § 9-307 cmt. 3.\n                                              10\n\fcould be “located” in more than one jurisdiction and, “in a single transaction, a secured\n\nparty might have to file in the limited-purpose registry to perfect as to some security\n\ninterests or collateral, while having to file in the District of Columbia to perfect as to\n\nothers.”   For these reasons, and based on the comments to the UCC, we interpret\n\n§ 47-9307(C) to adopt the comprehensive approach, requiring a system for perfecting\n\nnonpossessory security interests as a whole.\n\n¶18            The expert testimony and secondary authority on the topic establish that\n\nMexico‟s law in 2007 and 2008 did not meet the requirements of § 47-9307(C) and,\n\ntherefore, the growers for the purpose of perfecting security interests in their property\n\nwere located in the District of Columbia pursuant to the statute. Thus, D&H perfected its\n\nsecurity interest by filing in the District of Columbia, and its security interest in the 2008\n\ncrop and its proceeds had priority over Del Monte‟s conflicting, unperfected security\n\ninterest. See A.R.S. § 47-9322(A)(2) (“A perfected security interest . . . has priority over\n\na conflicting unperfected security interest . . . .”).\n\nConversion\n\n¶19            Del Monte argues it cannot be liable for conversion because it sold the\n\ngrapes and applied the proceeds following the growers‟ default in accordance with\n\nA.R.S. §§ 47-9610 and 47-9615. Del Monte contends the growers defaulted on their\n\nobligations to it by breaching the marketing agreement. Section 47-9610 entitles a\n\nsecured party to dispose of collateral upon default and § 47-9615 provides for disposition\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fof the cash proceeds.       We conclude, however, under these circumstances neither\n\n§§ 47-9610 nor 47-9615 preclude liability for conversion.\n\n¶20           The official comments to the UCC note that non-UCC law governs a junior\n\nsecured party‟s liability to a senior secured party for conversion when the junior party is\n\nin possession of collateral, noting that normally “a junior who refuses to relinquish\n\npossession of collateral upon the demand of a secured party having a superior possessory\n\nright . . . would be liable in conversion.” U.C.C. § 9-609 cmt. 5 (2001). Conversion is\n\n“„an act of wrongful dominion or control over personal property in denial of or\n\ninconsistent with the rights of another.‟” Case Corp. v.

A secured party\n\nis entitled to take possession of the collateral after default, A.R.S. § 47-9609, dispose of\n\nthe collateral, § 47-9610, and apply the proceeds of the disposition, § 47-9615. Because\n\nmore than one secured party may be entitled to possession of collateral, conflicting rights\n\namong secured parties are resolved by the priority rules. See U.C.C. § 9-609 cmt. 5 (“[A]\n\n                                            13\n\fsenior secured party is entitled to possession as against a junior claimant.”). Here, D&H\n\nand Del Monte each had a security interest in the collateral and proceeds. And the\n\ngrowers defaulted on their agreements with both. But, as discussed above, D&H‟s\n\nsecurity interest had priority over Del Monte‟s and D&H was entitled to dispose of the\n\ncollateral and apply the proceeds pursuant to §§ 47-9610 and 47-9615. Del Monte‟s\n\ninterference with that right constituted conversion. See Gehrke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508630\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508630/case-corp-v-gehrke/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ariz.</span> <span class=\"page\">140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 11, 91\n\nP.3d at 365.\n\n¶23            Del Monte contends the official comment five to U.C.C. § 9-610 precludes\n\nliability for conversion. We disagree. Comment five states: “The exercise of [the right\n\nto dispose of collateral after default] by a secured party whose security interest is\n\nsubordinate to that of another secured party does not of itself constitute a conversion or\n\notherwise give rise to liability in favor of the holder of the senior security interest.”\n\nU.C.C. § 9-610 cmt. 5 (2001). This is so because normally “the disposition by a junior\n\nwould not cut off a senior‟s security interest” and “the junior‟s receipt of the cash\n\nproceeds would not violate the rights of the senior,” instead the senior‟s secured interest\n\n“ordinarily will survive the disposition by the junior.” Id. But here, although D&H‟s\n\nrights in the crops were cut off when Del Monte sold them, D&H also had rights to the\n\nsales proceeds, which survived the sale, and Del Monte violated those rights by retaining\n\nthose proceeds. See 7 U.S.C. § 1631(d) (buyer of farm product in ordinary course of\n\nbusiness takes free of security interest). Moreover, the same comment further provides\n\n“[t]he holder of a senior security interest is entitled, by virtue of its priority, to take\n\n                                            14\n\fpossession of collateral from the junior secured party and conduct its own disposition”\n\nfollowing default. U.C.C. § 9-610 cmt. 5.

Section 47-9404(A)(1)\n\nprovides that the rights of an assignee are subject to “[a]ll terms of the agreement\n\nbetween the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising\n\nfrom the transaction that gave rise to the contract.” Del Monte contends the growers\n\nwere the “assignors” and D&H was the “assignee” because the growers had granted\n\nD&H a security interest in the crops and proceeds. Del Monte further contends it is the\n\n“account debtor” because it was obligated to pay the growers the sales proceeds from the\n\n                                           16\n\fgrapes it sold.4 Consequently, it asserts, under § 47-9404, D&H‟s rights are subject to\n\nthe agreement between Del Monte and the growers, which included a right of\n\nrecoupment.\n\n¶27           The trial court concluded that § 47-9404 did not apply because “[Del\n\nMonte] is not suing to enforce an assignment of Grower‟s rights under the [marketing\n\nagreement].” We agree. Section 47-9404 does not apply in actions for conversion\n\nbecause “the basis for a conversion [action] is the secured party‟s superior property\n\ninterest in the inventory itself, not the assignment of the account held by the debtor.”\n\nUnited States v. Handy & Harman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445533\"><a href=\"/opinion/445533/united-states-v-handy-and-harman-a-new-york-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 786 (9th Cir. 1984). Here, D&H\n\nbrought a conversion action against Del Monte asserting its superior security interest in\n\nthe grape crops and their sales proceeds. It did not assert an interest in the growers‟\n\naccount with Del Monte, instead asserting an interest in the crops and proceeds.\n\nTherefore, D&H was not “merely the assignee of an account against which setoffs are\n\ngenerally permissible,” rather it had a senior security interest in the crops and their sales\n\nproceeds.
