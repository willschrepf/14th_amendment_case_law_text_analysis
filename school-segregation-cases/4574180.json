The victim was beaten, stabbed, and ultimately strangled to death while\nher boyfriend was out Christmas shopping. The jury convicted defendant of\nmurder in the course of a robbery, with personal use of a deadly weapon.1 It fixed\nthe penalty at death. We affirm.\n                                I. BACKGROUND\nA.      Guilt Phase\n        1.      Events Before the Murder\n        In December 1995, 20-year-old Erika Beeson lived with 21-year-old Mario\nBotello in an Oakland apartment. The building had a security gate, and visitors\nhad to be ―buzzed in‖ to enter. Botello sold small amounts of marijuana, mostly to\n\n\n1     Penal Code sections 187, 190.2, subdivision (a)(17)(A), and former section\n12022, subdivision (b). All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless\notherwise stated.\n\n\n                          SEE CONCURRING OPINION\n\fpeople he knew. He grew up in South Berkeley and had been childhood friends\nwith Norman Patterson. He was 14 when he first met defendant.\n       Defendant was arrested at age 14 for driving a stolen car and spent the next\nfour years in custody at the California Youth Authority (CYA).2 On December\n12, 1995, at the age of 19, he was released on parole subject to electronic\nmonitoring. Defendant soon began contacting friends, including Patterson. By\nthat time, Patterson‘s sister had married defendant‘s brother.\n       During the weeks before defendant‘s release, Patterson and Botello had\nspent time together. On December 20, about a week after defendant came home,\nPatterson took defendant to visit Botello‘s apartment. Botello, Patterson, and\ndefendant spent the visit talking and smoking marijuana. Beeson was home but\ndid not join the conversation. At one point, defendant noticed a shotgun in the\nroom. He asked if Botello could get him a gun, explaining he wanted to rob some\ndrug dealers. The conversation made Botello uncomfortable. He did not want to\nhelp defendant, who was acting aggressively. Botello gave defendant $40 and\ntalked about helping him find a job, but defendant did not appear grateful.\nDefendant and Patterson left after about an hour.\n       During the next two days, defendant called Botello five or six times asking\nfor help obtaining a large-caliber gun. Defendant said he wanted to rob some drug\ndealers in Hayward and asked if Botello knew others he could rob. In one\nconversation, defendant asked if Botello loved his girlfriend. Botello thought the\nquestion was odd but did not consider it a threat. He tried to put defendant off\npolitely, hoping he would drop the subject of guns. Nevertheless, defendant\ninsisted Botello find him a firearm by the end of the week.\n       December 22 was the day of the murder. Around noon or 1:00 p.m., Maceo\nSmith brought defendant to the house he shared with his girlfriend, Iva Mosely.\n\n\n2      CYA is now the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of\nJuvenile Facilities. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 1000.)\n\n\n                                         2\n\fSmith had long known defendant but had not seen him in four years. Among other\nthings, the two men discussed committing a robbery together later that night.\nThey called Botello to ask about the gun and announced they would be at his\napartment in about 20 minutes. Botello and Smith were close friends. Botello left\nhome immediately, however, to avoid encountering defendant. He asked Beeson\nto say he would be back later.\n        After defendant and Smith left, Mosely called Beeson to warn her they\nwere coming. The women were friends and had shared their view that defendant\nwas ―weird.‖ Beeson was still speaking with Mosely when defendant and Smith\narrived, around 3:00 p.m. They climbed over the security gate and knocked on the\napartment door. Beeson opened the door a crack and told them Botello was not\nhome.\n        Defendant was angry that Botello had left and suggested robbing Botello.\nSmith refused to participate. Later that evening, defendant called Smith\nrepeatedly. Smith avoided the calls. He and Mosely went to a movie, returning\nhome shortly after 9:00 p.m.\n        Various witnesses established the following timeline. Around 3:45 p.m.,\nBotello went Christmas shopping with his friend Grace Sumisaki. He called\nBeeson between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. Beeson also spoke to her mother around 6:00\np.m. Two other friends stopped by the apartment in the same time frame. Another\nfriend tried calling Beeson around 8:00 or 9:00 that evening, but the line was busy.\n        Botello‘s uncle, Andrew Williams, called around 7:35 p.m. and spoke\nbriefly to Beeson. Williams arrived at Beeson and Botello‘s apartment between\n7:45 and 8:00 p.m. Another young man was ringing the security buzzer, but he\nsoon left. Williams rang the buzzer for about 10 minutes. No one answered. He\nthen went to a friend‘s house and called the apartment about 10 times between\n8:15 and 9:15 p.m. Each time, the line was busy.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f       2.     The Murder\n       Around 8:00 p.m., defendant and Patterson went to Botello‘s apartment,\nintending to rob him. Beeson buzzed them through the security gate and met them\nat the apartment door. Patterson said he wanted to buy some marijuana. Beeson\nhesitated when she saw defendant but then let them both inside.\n       Defendant told Patterson to put the couple‘s puppies in a bedroom.\nPatterson returned with Botello‘s shotgun and picked up some containers of\nmarijuana lying nearby. Defendant searched the bedroom and took $300.\nDefendant became irritated because Beeson did not seem to be taking the robbery\nseriously. He removed his belt and forced Beeson to the floor. Both he and\nPatterson choked her. Beeson struggled throughout but remained conscious.\nAfter a few minutes, at defendant‘s direction, Patterson brought him a butcher\nknife from the kitchen. Defendant stabbed Beeson repeatedly in the face,\nshoulder, and neck. He and Patterson left immediately afterward. Defendant took\nthe knife with him. Patterson drove to Aquatic Park in Berkeley, where defendant\nthrew the knife in the lagoon.\n       Defendant and Patterson picked up Smith shortly after he returned home\nfrom the movies. The trio went out drinking. Smith noticed defendant now had\nmoney to spend.\n       3.     Investigation\n              a.     Discovery of the Crime Scene\n       Knowing her boyfriend would be out, Beeson invited two friends to come\nover. Jennifer Onweller called around 8:00 p.m. to tell Beeson that she and Amy\nKekki were on their way. The line was busy, which worried Onweller because she\nknew Beeson had call waiting. After several tries, Onweller called the operator\nand confirmed the phone was off the hook.\n       Onweller and Kekki arrived at Beeson‘s apartment around 9:30 p.m. and\nfound the security gate propped open. The apartment door was locked, and no one\nresponded when they knocked. The lights and television were on, but the\n\n\n                                        4\n\ftelevision was tuned to a sports channel, which was unusual for Beeson. The\nbedroom door was shut, and they could not see Beeson or the dogs inside.\nOnweller and Kekki then walked around the corner to a park to see if Beeson had\ntaken her dogs for a walk. Unsuccessful, they returned to the apartment, and\nOnweller began writing a note. As she did so, Botello arrived. He found the door\nlocked and could hear the dogs barking. Not having a key with him, he removed a\nscreen and opened a window to enter.\n       The apartment had been ransacked. Beeson lay on the living room floor,\ncovered in blood. She was not breathing. A wadded-up strip of masking tape and\npieces of a gold rope necklace lay on the floor near her. The robbers had left a roll\nof masking tape nearby on the floor. Onweller found the telephone, which had\nbeen knocked off the hook, and called 911. Botello spoke with the dispatcher.\nSounding ―frantic‖ and ―terrified,‖ Botello insisted an ambulance be sent\nimmediately. Police and an ambulance arrived, but Beeson had expired.\n       An autopsy revealed Beeson died from ―[a]sphyxiation due to strangulation\nand multiple stab wounds.‖ She had multiple scrapes and bruises on her arms,\nlegs, back, and face, including a bruise on her nose matching the size and shape of\nBotello‘s shotgun barrel. A ligature mark circling her neck could have been made\nby a belt. She also had nine stab wounds on her face and neck.\n              b.     Investigation and Arrests\n       Botello‘s shotgun, some marijuana, a piece of stereo equipment, and $300\nin cash had been stolen. Botello told police he suspected defendant, Smith, and\nPatterson were responsible.\n       On December 26, the police discovered that defendant‘s electronic\nmonitoring ankle bracelet had been disabled from 7:04 p.m. on the night of the\nmurder through Christmas Day. They conducted a brief parole search and\nadjusted defendant‘s bracelet but were not ready to question him about Beeson‘s\nmurder. They did question Smith, however. Smith gave them an unusually\nprecise, ―minute-by-minute‖ alibi for the night of the murder. As the investigation\n\n\n                                          5\n\fcontinued, a number of witnesses reported that defendant was bragging about the\nmurder.\n       On April 4, 1996, defendant and an accomplice were arrested for robbing a\ngas station. Defendant initially gave the police two false names. Questioned\nabout the murder, defendant admitted he had met Beeson twice at Botello‘s\napartment but denied ever speaking with her. About a week after this interview,\ndefendant pled guilty to the gas station robbery and remained in custody.\n       While defendant was in jail, Julia P. called the police anonymously to\nreport that she had heard defendant telling his cousin about the murder. Julia\nknew defendant‘s cousin, Lakeisha Lovely, and Patterson‘s girlfriend, Latonya\nWilson. According to the caller, defendant said he had broken off his ankle\nbracelet, then robbed and killed a young Caucasian girl in her home. When Julia\nheard ―Mario‘s girlfriend‖ had been stabbed, she was confused about why\ndefendant would have stabbed her since ―he always [had] guns on him‖ now.\n       On the evening of April 30, 1996, Patterson robbed a gas station and was\narrested early the next morning. On the ride to the police station, he asked the\nofficer sitting next to him, ―You all didn‘t come get me about a murder?‖ The\nofficer responded, ―Not unless you want to talk to me about one.‖ They both\nlaughed, and Patterson said, ―Naw, I don‘t think so.‖ In a search of Patterson‘s\nhome, police recovered the shotgun and stereo equipment stolen from Botello‘s\napartment.\n              c.     Confessions of Defendant and Patterson\n       At the police station, Patterson waived his Miranda3 rights and eventually\nconfessed to the robbery. Because the shotgun was found at his home, the police\nthen took him to the homicide division. Patterson first claimed he had bought the\nshotgun from a ―dope fiend‖ he knew as Gichi Dan. When questioned specifically\n\n\n\n3      Miranda v. Arizona (1966) 384 U.S. 436 (Miranda).\n\n\n                                         6\n\fabout the Beeson murder several hours later, however, Patterson admitted his\ninvolvement.\n       Patterson told the police that defendant needed money and wanted to rob\nBotello. Patterson kept making excuses, but defendant bullied him into going\nalong. After Beeson let them into the apartment, Patterson put the dogs in a back\nroom. When he returned to the living room, defendant was on top of Beeson,\nchoking her with his belt. Defendant continued to struggle with Beeson and\nordered him to retrieve the shotgun and marijuana. At one point, defendant hit\nBeeson in the head with the shotgun barrel. Patterson initially said that defendant\ntook a butcher knife from the kitchen but later admitted that he had retrieved the\nweapon. Patterson described how defendant assaulted Beeson but denied ever\nstabbing her himself. Afterward, defendant took the knife and told Patterson to\ndrive him to Aquatic Park. There, defendant left the car and returned without the\nknife. Defendant wanted Patterson to keep the shotgun at his house because he\nfeared a parole search of his own home. They drove to Maceo Smith‘s house, and\ndefendant told Patterson not to worry because they would have an alibi. Patterson\nlater heard that defendant was bragging about the killing.\n       Shortly after Patterson‘s statement, officers interviewed defendant.\nDefendant waived his Miranda rights and initially denied any involvement. He\nwas confident and self-assured during the questioning. However, after police told\nhim they had evidence against him, showed him pictures of Patterson in custody,\nand played the first five minutes of Patterson‘s taped confession, defendant\nadmitted the crimes.4 The police secretly recorded his initial statements, and\ndefendant later gave a formal taped confession. He also admitted the murder in a\nrecorded phone call to his mother.\n\n\n\n4       The circumstances and content of defendant‘s interview are discussed in\ndetail in connection with his claim that the statements were coerced. (See\nDiscussion, pt. A.3, post, at pp. 44-48.)\n\n\n                                         7\n\f              d.      Other Events Before Trial\n       About two weeks later, acting on an anonymous tip, the police interviewed\ncounty jail inmate Tyrone Freeman. Freeman had shared a holding cell with\ndefendant on May 8, 1996. Defendant told Freeman that he was in jail on a\nmurder charge and ―might have partially confessed.‖ He said he and his brother-\nin-law ―Nate‖ were committing a robbery but the girl was not cooperating. After\nsending ―Nate‖ to search the house, defendant said he pistol-whipped the girl,\nchoked her with his belt, and finally stabbed her with a knife he saw lying on the\ncounter. Defendant said he planned to blame the whole crime on ―Nate.‖ He\nwould explain that he was tired when he talked to the police and did not remember\nconfessing.\n       Patterson was released on bail in July 1997. A little over a year later, in\nSeptember 1998, Patterson called Julia P. and asked her to come out and smoke\nmarijuana. He said nothing about Julia‘s anonymous phone call to the police, and\nshe did not think he was aware of it. They drove to a park and Patterson asked,\n―Was that you on that tape?‖ Scared, Julia denied making the call. Patterson then\ndemanded that Julia have oral sex and punched her in the face when she refused.\nHe beat her severely, knocking out two teeth, breaking her nose, and causing her\neyes to swell shut. He also choked her, saying ―[t]hat was you on that tape,‖ and\nthreatening to kill her. He said, ―I‘m going to do you just like we did that bitch.‖\nThe assault ended when witnesses heard Julia screaming. In 1999, Patterson was\nconvicted of several charges arising from the incident.\n       4.     Trial\n       Defendant and Patterson were tried together for murder with special\ncircumstance allegations. Emphasizing that no physical evidence linked them to\nthe murder, the defense argued the prosecution‘s case was based entirely on street\nrumors and coerced confessions.\n       Defendant testified, denying any involvement. He admitted he and Smith\nwent to Botello‘s apartment the afternoon of the murder but denied going back\n\n\n                                          8\n\flater. Defendant testified he left his grandmother‘s house around 7:00 p.m. and\ntook a bus to his aunt‘s home in South Berkeley. Around 10:00 p.m., he and\nPatterson drank and smoked marijuana with Smith and another friend. Defendant\nclaimed the police had coerced his confession. They threatened him with the\ndeath penalty, said they had his fingerprints on Botello‘s shotgun, and played him\nthe entire recording of Patterson‘s statement. Defendant said he confessed\nbecause the officers told him it would help him avoid the death penalty. He\nobtained details of the crime from Patterson‘s statement and things the officers\ntold him. Defendant explained that he lied on the phone call to his mother because\nthe officers were standing nearby and he wanted to keep his deal to avoid the\ndeath penalty.\n       Codefendant Patterson also testified that he had nothing to do with\nBeeson‘s killing. He said he did not visit Botello‘s apartment on the night of the\nmurder and did not see defendant until 10:15 or 10:30 p.m. Patterson claimed he\ngave a false confession because police officers had assaulted him and threatened\nthe death penalty.\n       Defendant‘s aunt testified that defendant sometimes visited her home, but\nshe could not recall the specific date or time of any visit. Botello‘s landlord\ntestified that he saw a lot of traffic in and out of the apartment and suspected drug\nactivity.\n       The jury returned guilty verdicts against both defendants on all charges and\nfound the special circumstance allegations true.\nB.     Penalty Phase\n       1.     Prosecution Evidence\n       The prosecution presented victim impact testimony from Beeson‘s mother\nand sister.5 Melitta Beeson shared memories of her daughter and described her\n\n5       Because defendant challenges the admission of victim impact evidence, this\nevidence will be described in greater detail in connection with his claims. (See\npost, at pp. 65-67.)\n\n\n                                          9\n\fclose relationship with her father. Fred Beeson was ―totally devastated‖ by the\nmurder and died six months later. Lisa Beeson testified about her sister‘s\nmemorial service and the family‘s difficulty coping with the murder. She also\ndescribed her ritual of bringing flowers to the graves of her father and sister.\n       The prosecution offered evidence under section 190.3, factor (b) (factor (b))\nof other instances in which defendant committed or threatened violence. Seven\nincidents predated the murder. They involved physical and sexual assaults on\nother youths and altercations with police and CYA staff members. These\nincidents are discussed in detail in connection with defendant‘s claim that the\ncourt erred in admitting acts he committed as a juvenile. (See post, at pp. 74-75.)\nFour incidents occurred between defendant‘s release from CYA in December 1995\nand his robbery arrest in April 1996. The prosecution also presented evidence that\ndefendant sexually assaulted Julia P. three times. Details about these incidents are\ndiscussed in connection with defendant‘s claims of error relating to her testimony.\n(See post, at pp. 69-74.) In addition, the gas station clerk who was robbed testified\nthat defendant and his accomplice wore ski masks and threatened to shoot if she\ndid not cooperate.\n       The prosecution also presented factor (b) evidence about several jail\nincidents. Twice while awaiting trial, defendant attacked a fellow inmate. On\nFebruary 6, 1998, defendant slipped out of his restraints and charged an inmate\nboarding a prison bus. After a deputy forced defendant to back away, defendant\ntold the inmate, ―That is what you get for calling me PC.‖6 Another time,\ndefendant charged an inmate being escorted back to his cell. Defendant punched\nthe inmate, wrestling him and two deputies to the floor. The inmate did not\nprovoke the attack. He was in waist chains and ―virtually defenseless‖ when\n\n\n\n\n6     ―PC‖ is a derogatory term referring to the classification for pedophiles,\ninformants, and prisoners with low status.\n\n\n                                          10\n\fdefendant charged him. Defendant defied commands to stop and continued the\nbeating until subdued.\n       Defendant also attacked prison guards on several occasions. For example,7\non March 1, 1997, defendant was in the shower during a lockdown and given two\nminutes to finish. After the water was turned off, he complained he needed more\ntime and angrily refused to comply with the lockdown. When a deputy tried to\ntake him to an isolation cell, defendant punched the deputy two or three times in\nthe face, breaking his nose. On another occasion, defendant refused to cooperate\nwith procedures for a security check. He punched a deputy in the face, breaking\nhis glasses.\n       2.      Defense Evidence\n       A defense investigator testified about interviews with two prisoners who\nsaw defendant‘s altercation with the deputy in the showers. Both said the deputy\nstruck first. Although defendant was shivering, the deputy threatened to send him\nto the ―cold room,‖ then began hitting him and spraying him with pepper spray.\nThe prisoners said defendant was not combative but was simply asking to rinse\noff.\n       In addition, the defense offered expert testimony from Jamie Candelaria-\nGreene, Ph.D., that defendant suffered from learning disabilities and attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). On cross-examination, she conceded\ndefendant had been diagnosed with a conduct disorder and met the diagnostic\ncriteria for antisocial personality disorder.\n       The jury sentenced Patterson to life imprisonment without possibility of\nparole but sentenced defendant to death. Defendant‘s appeal is automatic.\n(§ 1239, subdivision (b).)\n\n\n\n7       Additional incidents will be discussed in connection with defendant‘s claim\nthat the court erred in admitting evidence of misconduct not involving actual or\nthreatened violence. (See post, at pp. 77-82.)\n\n\n                                           11\n\f                                  II. DISCUSSION\nA.     Pretrial Issues\n       1.      Pitchess Rulings\n       The trial court ruled on several motions filed pursuant to Pitchess v.\nSuperior Court (1974) 11 Cal.3d 531.\n       Defendant sought to discover any complaints against Sergeants Olivas and\nMcKenna for incidents of aggression, use of excessive force, dishonesty, or\nimproper interrogation tactics. Based on defendant‘s showing, the court reviewed\nthe records for promises of leniency or other improper interrogation tactics. It\nfound no discoverable information. The court also reviewed Oakland Police\nDepartment personnel files in response to Patterson‘s Pitchess motion and found\nno discoverable information about inappropriate interview tactics. The defense\nreceived the officers‘ training records but no additional discovery through Pitchess\nproceedings.\n       Defendant also sought Pitchess discovery on four CYA officers and seven\nAlameda County Sheriff‘s deputies. After litigation over the required foundation,\nthe court reviewed all but two of the files.8 The court ordered release of nearly all\nof the CYA files, subject to a limited protective order. It also ordered discovery of\nsome sheriff‘s department records, including the dates of incidents and names and\naddresses of individuals involved.\n       When a defendant shows good cause for the discovery of information in an\nofficer‘s personnel records, the trial court must examine the records in camera to\ndetermine if any information should be disclosed. (Evid. Code, § 1045; People v.\nMooc (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1216, 1226.) The court may not disclose complaints over\nfive years old, conclusions drawn during an investigation, or facts so remote or\nirrelevant that their disclosure would be of little benefit. (Evid. Code, § 1045,\n\n\n8      The court found insufficient cause to review the records of two sheriff‘s\ndeputies. Defendant has not challenged this ruling on appeal.\n\n\n                                         12\n\fsubd. (b); Mooc, at pp. 1226-1227, 1232.) Pitchess rulings are reviewed for abuse\nof discretion. (People v. Jackson (1996) 13 Cal.4th 1164, 1220.)\n       The record includes five large volumes of sealed documents pertaining to\nall of defendant‘s motions. The trial court made a detailed record of all the\nmaterials it found discoverable. Our review confirms that all discoverable\nmaterials were properly released. There was no Pitchess error.\n       2.     Jury Selection Issues\n              a.      Cause Challenge Rulings\n       Defendant contends the court erred in denying two of his challenges for\ncause and in granting one prosecution challenge without adequate voir dire. Each\nchallenge involved the panelist‘s personal views on the death penalty.\n       A cause challenge lies only if a panelist‘s death penalty views ―would\n‗ ―prevent or substantially impair‖ ‘ the performance of the juror‘s duties as\ndefined by the court‘s instructions and the juror‘s oath.‖ (People v. Cunningham\n(2001) 25 Cal.4th 926, 975; see Wainwright v. Witt (1985) 469 U.S. 412, 424;\nWitherspoon v. Illinois (1968) 391 U.S. 510, 521-522.) ―If a juror‘s responses are\nconflicting or equivocal, the trial court‘s ruling is binding on us. [Citations.] If\nnot, we will uphold the trial court if the ruling is fairly supported by substantial\nevidence in the record, giving deference to the trial court which had the\nopportunity to observe and listen to the juror. [Citations.]‖ (People v. Holt (1997)\n15 Cal.4th 619, 651.) Defendant‘s first two claims were not preserved for appeal.\nThe record amply supports the court‘s ruling on the third.\n                      i.     Denial of Defense Challenges\n       Defendant unsuccessfully challenged two prospective jurors for cause. He\nargued Prospective Juror E.T. was not qualified to serve because voir dire\nresponses indicated he would vote for the death penalty in any case involving an\nintentional killing during a robbery. Defendant raised a different challenge to\nProspective Juror G.M. He maintained G.M. could not be fair because, as a young\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fWhite woman similar in appearance to Beeson, she would identify too closely\nwith the murder victim. The court denied both challenges.\n       Weeks later, voir dire concluded and actual selection began. Prospective\nJuror E.T. was seated early in the process. Neither side exercised a peremptory\nchallenge, and he served as Juror No. 12. Several panelists cycled through the\nNo. 9 seat. Eventually, Prospective Juror G.M. was seated in this position.\nImmediately afterward, the prosecution and defense declined to exercise any\nfurther peremptory challenges. Patterson‘s attorney declared, ―The defense is very\nsatisfied with the jury.‖ As a result, Prospective Juror G.M. served as Juror No. 9.\n       Defendant now complains the court erred in denying his cause challenges\nto Juror Nos. 9 and 12. To preserve such a claim, a defendant must exercise a\nperemptory challenge and remove the prospective juror in question, exhaust all\navailable peremptory challenges, and express ―dissatisfaction with the jury as\npresently constituted.‖ (People v. Mills (2010) 48 Cal.4th 158, 186.) None of\nthese requirements was satisfied.\n       Defendant did not peremptorily challenge either Juror No. 9 or No. 12, nor\ndid he exhaust his challenges. Counsel for defendant and Patterson were given 30\nchallenges to exercise jointly in selecting the 12 trial jurors. When counsel\naccepted the jury panel as constituted, the defense had 25 challenges remaining.\nIndeed, the defense ―passed,‖ indicating its satisfaction with the panel, four times\nafter Prospective Juror E.T. was seated. Finally, rather than expressing\ndissatisfaction, counsel assured the court the defense was ―very satisfied‖ with the\npanel chosen.9 The court confirmed this satisfaction was shared by both\ndefendants, and confirmed again, during an in-chambers discussion, that all parties\nagreed the 12 jurors currently sitting would serve as the trial jury.\n\n\n9      Although it was Patterson‘s attorney who expressed this satisfaction, the\ndefendants agreed to make joint decisions about peremptory challenges and jury\nselection. The court was initially reluctant to proceed in this fashion but was\npersuaded to do so by defendant‘s counsel.\n\n\n                                          14\n\f       These facts establish forfeiture. When defendant accepted the jury, he had\nsufficient challenges remaining to repopulate the panel twice over yet declined to\nexcuse E.T. or G.M. Using additional challenges would not have depleted the\nvenire. Such a large pool of qualified jurors remained after the panel was selected\nthat the court decided to seat six alternate jurors and allowed 12 peremptory\nchallenges per side in their selection. Counsel was well aware this decision would\nforfeit defendant‘s ability to dispute the rulings on appeal.10\n       Relying on United States v. Martinez-Salazar (2000) 528 U.S. 304,\ndefendant contends his claim is preserved. He argues Martinez-Salazar allows\ncriminal defendants to risk leaving a biased individual on the jury then bring a\nSixth Amendment challenge on appeal. Defendant misreads the case. In\nMartinez-Salazar, the high court was interpreting federal law, specifically rule 24\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C.), when it concluded a\ndefendant need not excuse a prospective juror in order to preserve a claim of error\nin the denial of a cause challenge. (Martinez-Salazar, at pp. 314-315; see People\nv. Hillhouse (2002) 27 Cal.4th 469, 487.) That rule is not binding on the states.\n(See Martinez–Salazar, at pp. 313-314.) Indeed, the high court has held there is\n―nothing arbitrary or irrational‖ about a state law requirement that the defendant\nuse peremptory challenges to cure a trial court‘s assertedly erroneous refusals to\ndismiss jurors for cause. (Ross v. Oklahoma (1988) 487 U.S. 81, 90.) Such a\nrequirement reasonably ―subordinates the absolute freedom to use a peremptory\nchallenge as one wishes to the goal of empaneling an impartial jury.‖ (Ibid.)\n       Accordingly, defendant‘s claims are not cognizable on appeal. (People v.\nThomas (2012) 54 Cal.4th 908, 935; People v. Hillhouse, supra, 27 Cal.4th at\n\n\n10     Before jury selection, Patterson‘s attorney sought a ruling that all cause\nchallenges would be deemed cognizable on appeal, even if the defense did not\nexhaust its peremptory challenges. The court denied the motion, noting such a\nruling would be contrary to precedent of this court and the United States Supreme\nCourt.\n\n\n                                          15\n\fp. 487; People v. Williams (1997) 16 Cal.4th 635, 667.) We decline defendant‘s\ninvitation to revisit these rules or find his failure to satisfy them was justified.\n(See Thomas, at p. 935.) Defendant‘s attempt to derive an alternative standard of\nforfeiture from People v. Yeoman (2003) 31 Cal.4th 93 and People v. Boyette\n(2002) 29 Cal.4th 381 is also unavailing. In those cases, the defendant used a\nperemptory challenge to excuse the objectionable juror and exhausted all\nchallenges. (Yeoman, at p. 114; Boyette, at p. 416.) Defendant failed to do either.\n                      ii.    Excusal of Prospective Juror E.I.\n       Next, defendant claims the court erred in excusing Prospective Juror E.I.,\nboth because voir dire was inadequate and because her views on the death penalty\nwould not have substantially impaired her ability to serve.\n       E.I.‘s questionnaire responses indicated she was ―[m]oderately in favor‖ of\nthe death penalty. She explained, ―it is acceptable punishment for certain crimes\nbut,‖ because of the ―heavy responsibility‖ in imposing it, the defendant ―had\nbetter be guilty and the jury had better be sure.‖ She said she had been opposed to\ncapital punishment in college but ―became for it again‖ after learning about some\nhorrific crimes. She agreed that California should have a death penalty because\n―[s]ome crimes are so serious that there are no second chances for the person who\ncommitted them. Why spend huge amounts of money on imprisoning these\npeople.‖ Asked whether she would always vote for death if the victim was\nintentionally killed for the purpose of a robbery by defendants with substantial\ncriminal histories, E.I. responded that an ―intentional‖ killing warranted the death\npenalty but she did not agree it was ―always‖ appropriate.\n       In voir dire, when asked if she could realistically consider both sentencing\noptions, E.I. stated that, while both were possible, ―it would have to be really,\nreally aggravating circumstances for me to choose the death penalty over life in\nprison, because that is the most serious thing you can do.‖ When the court probed\nfurther, E.I. said she probably would have voted for the death penalty in notorious\ncases involving serial murder or ―incredibly violent‖ murders like decapitation.\n\n\n                                           16\n\fThe court responded with a general description of the facts here: ―In this case the\nallegation is one person has been killed. There aren‘t a number of victims like the\nYosemite case or Ted Bundy. One victim. [¶] There was no mutilation involved,\nsuch as cutting the head off of the victim, things of this nature. That did not occur.\n[¶] There was no sexual assault involved in the commission of the murder.‖ Given\nthese features of the case, the court asked whether the death penalty would be a\nrealistic sentencing option for E.I. She responded, ―It doesn‘t seem to be the kind\nof case where I would vote for the death penalty.‖ The court indicated it was\ninclined to excuse the juror but allowed the attorneys to question her first.\n       The prosecutor added that the victim had been ―involved in marijuana\ndealing‖ and described the murder as a kind of ―drug deal gone bad,‖ after which\nthe victim was strangled, stabbed and robbed. E.I. responded that she had not\nheard anything about the case to make the death penalty a possible sentencing\noption. She noted, ―I would have to hear something really different to make the\npeople so incredibly dangerous and deranged that it would have to be death as\nopposed to life in prison.‖ The murder of a single victim would have to be\nextremely violent for her to vote for the death penalty. In an effort to rehabilitate\nthe juror, Patterson‘s attorney gave her more details about the case: The victim\nwas a 20-year-old woman, and two men entered her apartment with the intention\nof robbing her. They did rob her, and also ―stabbed her repeatedly‖ and ―[c]hoked\nher with a belt and killed her.‖ He stressed, ―There is no question that it was an\nintentional murder.‖ E.I. said she would not automatically find the death penalty\nappropriate for an intentional killing, nor would she automatically vote for life\nimprisonment without parole in all cases not involving serial murder. She stated,\n―I do believe in the death penalty in most cases, but for the most part, life in prison\nwill handle it.‖ When asked about hypothetical cases, E.I. stated, ―I can‘t say that\nI absolutely wouldn‘t, wouldn‘t vote for the death penalty. But, you know, I—it\nwould definitely have to really be some reason for me to do that.‖\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f       After a brief chambers conference, defendant‘s attorney examined E.I. He\nexplained in some detail that penalty would be decided after a second trial in\nwhich the parties presented aggravating and mitigating evidence. Following this\nlengthy explanation, counsel said, ―All I‘m asking you, [is] would you wait and\nlisten to the evidence in the second phase, and can you conceive that depending on\nwhat the aggravation is that you might return a verdict of death?‖ E.I. responded,\n―I don‘t want to send anybody to death.‖ Counsel asked if she was saying she\nwould not vote for death. She said, ―I‘m beginning to think more and more—as\nI‘m more and more on the spot, I don‘t want to live with my conscience.‖ When\ncounsel asked again, ―Are you telling me that you would not want to return a\nverdict of death,‖ E.I. answered, ―No.‖\n       The court dismissed E.I. for cause, remarking it had formed a ―definite\nimpression‖ from the courtroom voir dire that E.I.‘s views on capital punishment\nwould substantially impair her ability to serve. E.I. clearly described the types of\ncases in which she would consider voting for death, i.e., those involving multiple\nkillings or mutilation, circumstances not present in this case. Moreover, it\nappeared that, over the course of her questioning, E.I.‘s views had become\n―crystalized that she could never return a verdict of death.‖\n       ―A prospective juror may be excluded for cause without compromising a\ndefendant‘s right to trial by an impartial jury if the juror‘s views on capital\npunishment ‗would ―prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties\nas a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.‖ ‘ (Wainwright v. Witt,\nsupra, 469 U.S. at p. 424; [citation].)‖11 (People v. Virgil (2011) 51 Cal.4th 1210,\n1243.) ― ‗Generally, the qualifications of jurors challenged for cause are matters\nwithin the wide discretion of the trial court, seldom disturbed on appeal.\n[Citations.] There is no requirement that a prospective juror‘s bias against the\n\n11     Citing no governing authority, defendant argues the familiar Wainwright v.\nWitt standard is ―inconsistent with modern Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.‖ We\ndecline defendant‘s invitation to ignore this long-standing binding precedent.\n\n\n                                          18\n\fdeath penalty be proven with unmistakable clarity. [Citations.] Rather, it is\nsufficient that the trial judge is left with the definite impression that a prospective\njuror would be unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law in the case before\nthe juror. [Citations.] ―On review, if the juror‘s statements are equivocal or\nconflicting, the trial court‘s determination of the juror‘s state of mind is binding.\nIf there is no inconsistency, we will uphold the court‘s ruling if it is supported by\nsubstantial evidence. [Citations.]‖ [Citation.]‘ [Citation.]‖ (Virgil, at pp. 1243-\n1244.)12\n       The record supports the conclusion that E.I.‘s finally expressed views made\nher unqualified to serve. ―A prospective juror is properly excluded if he or she is\nunable to conscientiously consider all of the sentencing alternatives, including the\ndeath penalty where appropriate. [Citations.]‖ (People v. Jones (2003) 29 Cal.4th\n1229, 1246.) Defendant complains the court ignored questionnaire responses\nshowing support for the death penalty in favor of E.I.‘s ambiguous statements in\nvoir dire that did not clearly show she was unqualified to serve. Defendant\nmischaracterizes the record and misconstrues our standard of review.\n       Even if a prospective juror‘s questionnaire responses express a willingness\nto consider the death penalty, an excusal for cause is appropriate if oral\nquestioning establishes that the juror‘s views on capital punishment would, in fact,\nsubstantially impair her ability to return a death sentence. (See, e.g., People v.\nVirgil, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 1244.) Here, E.I.‘s questionnaire responses showed\nmoderate support for capital punishment, noting it was appropriate for ―some\ncrimes.‖ However, she clarified her beliefs during voir dire, consistently\nexpressing the view that only the most violent kinds of killings warrant death.\nDefendant characterizes these responses as ambiguous because E.I. left room for\n\n\n12     Defendant argues this deference is inconsistent with Gray v. Mississippi\n(1987) 481 U.S. 648 and Adams v. Texas (1980) 448 U.S. 38. As defendant notes,\nwe have rejected this argument before. (See People v. Schmeck (2005) 37 Cal.4th\n240, 263.)\n\n\n                                           19\n\fthe possibility that she could vote for death. However, in each instance, she\nemphasized that the murder would have to be particularly brutal. ― ‗The real\nquestion is ― ‗ ―whether the juror‘s views about capital punishment would prevent\nor impair the juror‘s ability to return a verdict of death in the case before the\njuror.‖ ‘ ‖ ‘ [Citations.]‖ (People v. Cash (2002) 28 Cal.4th 703, 719-720.)\nWhen E.I. was given a general outline of the facts, she candidly admitted it did not\nsound like the kind of case in which she could vote for the death penalty.\n         Defendant now complains the court and prosecutor gave the juror a\nsanitized, ―sugarcoat[ed]‖ version of the incident. Yet, two defense lawyers\nexpanded on those descriptions and on the process for determining penalty.\nPatterson‘s attorney stressed that the victim was only 20 years old and was killed\nin her own apartment by two men who intended to rob her. They choked and\nstabbed her repeatedly in what he stressed was unquestionably an intentional\nkilling. With that preface, he asked whether such a murder could be sufficient to\nsupport a death verdict. Once again, E.I. hedged in responding, stating only that\nan intentional killing would ―sort of ma[ke] that more of a possibility,‖ but\nconsistently emphasized that she would be able to vote for death only in extreme\ncases.\n         We determined similar views supported a removal for cause in a previous\ndeath penalty case involving the same trial judge. (People v. Martinez (2009) 47\nCal.4th 399.)13 In Martinez, a prospective juror stated that a crime would have to\nbe ― ‗particularly heinous‘ ‖ or involve other circumstances like recidivism to\nwarrant the death penalty. (Id. at p. 428.) The prospective juror in Martinez\nconceded there was a possibility she could vote for death, depending on the facts,\nbut ― ‗it would have to be something that would push me beyond the way I\nnormally feel about the death penalty.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 429.) We concluded these\n\n13    We repeatedly commented on the careful and thoughtful voir dire Judge\nHorner conducted in Martinez. (People v. Martinez, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 433,\n437.) The thoroughness of his voir dire in this case is similarly commendable.\n\n\n                                          20\n\fstatements reserving the possibility of a death verdict did not necessarily mean the\njuror was qualified: ―The trial court was justified in concluding that the\nprospective juror‘s responses, rather than suggesting she could set aside her own\npersonal views, constituted merely a grudging acknowledgment that those views\nmight include some narrow exception—or at least an abstract possibility she\nwould consider the statutory penalty of death. But the mere theoretical possibility\nthat a prospective juror might be able to reach a verdict of death in some case does\nnot necessarily render the dismissal of the juror an abuse of discretion.\n[Citations.] Excusal for cause is not limited to a juror who ‗ ―zealously opposes or\nsupports the death penalty in every case.‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖ (Id. at p. 432.) Echoing\nthe dissent in Martinez, defendant argues the dismissal was improper because E.I.\nwas not asked whether serial killings and murders involving mutilation were the\nonly types of cases in which she could consider the death penalty. (See id. at\np. 461 (conc. & dis. opn. of Moreno, J.).) However, a court is certainly capable of\ndiscerning bias without hearing a prospective juror‘s speculation about all the\npotential circumstances that might support death. E.I. did not limit her discussion\nto serial killings or mutilations but consistently made clear that, in her view, only\nan especially violent murder could warrant punishment by death.\n       Defendant also complains the court did not allow adequate voir dire\nbecause it prevented defense counsel from telling E.I. about aggravating evidence\nthat would likely be introduced at the penalty phase. We have repeatedly\ncautioned that death-qualification voir dire ―must not be so abstract that it fails to\nidentify jurors whose death penalty views would prevent or substantially impair\ntheir performance as jurors‖ but also ―must not be so specific as to require\nprejudgment based on a summary of potential [aggravating and mitigating]\nevidence. (People v. Cash[, supra,] 28 Cal.4th [at pp.] 721-722.)‖ (People v.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fLeon (2015) 61 Cal.4th 569, 586.)14 The trial court has considerable discretion in\nstriking this balance. (Leon, at p. 586; People v. Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at\np. 722.) The ruling here was well within that ample scope. The attorneys had\nalready given E.I. a detailed preview of how and why the murder was committed.\nThe court reasonably concluded that voir dire questions describing particular\nevidence likely to be offered in aggravation would come too close to requiring E.I.\nto prejudge penalty. A defendant has no right to ask prospective jurors to predict\nhow they would decide penalty based on a summary of aggravating or mitigating\nevidence. (People v. Carasi (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1263, 1326-1327 (Carasi); People\nv. Burgener (2003) 29 Cal.4th 833, 865.) In any event, the aggravating evidence\nhere, which primarily consisted of violent outbursts while defendant was in\ncustody, was not nearly as shocking as Beeson‘s murder. A description of this\nevidence would not have caused a reasonable juror to change her views about the\nappropriateness of death as a penalty.\n       Moreover, E.I.‘s response to defense counsel‘s final questioning removed\nany doubt about her inability to serve. Defendant‘s attorney explained that if the\ncase reached a penalty phase, the parties would present aggravating and mitigating\nevidence about the crime and the backgrounds of the offenders and the victim. He\nthen asked whether E.I. could simply wait to hear that evidence and, if the\naggravating evidence was appropriate, consider possibly returning a verdict of\n\n\n14     In supplemental briefing, defendant argues People v. Leon supports reversal\nbecause E.I.‘s questionnaire responses indicated she could consider a death\nsentence, and she only changed her mind due to the prosecutor‘s ―misleading‖ voir\ndire. What happened here is precisely the opposite of the situation that led to\nreversal in Leon. There, three jurors‘ questionnaires stated unequivocally that they\ncould set aside their opinions about the death penalty and apply the law. (People\nv. Leon, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 590-591.) Thus, they were presumptively\nqualified to serve. (Id. at p. 592.) Because the court‘s cursory voir dire was not\nsufficient to undermine this presumption, the record did not support their dismissal\nfor cause. (Id. at pp. 592-593.) By contrast, the probing and thorough voir dire\nhere amply supports E.I.‘s dismissal.\n\n\n                                         22\n\fdeath. E.I. responded that she had thought more about the issue and realized she\ncould not live with her conscience if she sent anyone to death. She gave this\nanswer when proceedings resumed after an in-chambers conference. As the court\nobserved, E.I.‘s views had apparently ―crystalized‖ over the course of her\nquestioning and perhaps during the break.15. Her candid admission that she could\nnot vote for death under any circumstances revealed views that would ― ‗prevent\nor substantially impair‘ ‖ her ability to perform as a capital juror. (Wainwright v.\nWitt, supra, 469 U.S. at p. 424.)\n       A refinement of views often occurs during voir dire. When panel members\nare sent to a courtroom, they learn for the first time that they have been called for a\ncapital case. Then, appropriately, their opinions are probed in depth. These\nquestions touch on matters of conscience, morality, social policy, and individual\nability that panelists may never have considered in practical detail. The process\nencourages panelists to think deeply and seriously about their views. It falls to the\ndiscerning trial judge to carefully evaluate each panelist‘s state of mind on these\nweighty issues. The able trial court did so here. There was no error.\n              b.     Batson/Wheeler Rulings\n       Defendant, who is African-American, complains he was deprived of his\nconstitutional rights to equal protection and a representative jury because the\nprosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude African-Americans from\n\n\n15     For this reason, defendant‘s reliance on People v. Heard (2003) 31 Cal.4th\n946 and People v. Pearson (2012) 53 Cal.4th 306 is unavailing. In those cases, we\ndetermined cause dismissals were not supported by substantial evidence. One\nprospective juror‘s voir dire responses ―indicated he was prepared to follow the\nlaw and had no predisposition one way or the other as to imposition of the death\npenalty.‖ (Heard, at p. 967.) A second ― ‗had no strong feelings on the death\npenalty‘ ‖ (Pearson, at p. 330) but was ― ‗positive‘ ‖ she could vote to impose it in\nan appropriate case (id. at p. 331). These views stand in sharp contrast to E.I.‘s\npredisposition to vote against death in all but the most egregious cases, and her\nultimate conclusion that her conscience would prevent her from ever voting for\ndeath.\n\n\n                                          23\n\fthe jury. (See Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476 U.S. 79 (Batson); People v. Wheeler\n(1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 (Wheeler).)\n                     i.      Background\n       Because defendant makes several statistical arguments, we discuss the jury\nselection procedures in some detail. The process, which the court conducted with\nmeticulous attention, lasted from the middle of November 2002 until the\nbeginning of March 2003. Twelve panels of 90 individuals each were called and\ncompleted a 41-page questionnaire. After some panelists were excused by\nstipulation or for hardship, the rest returned in small groups over several weeks for\nindividual sequestered voir dire. (See Hovey v. Superior Court (1980) 28 Cal.3d\n1, 80.) This process produced a pool of 73 qualified jurors: 49 Caucasians (67.12\npercent); 10 Asian or Pacific Islanders (13.70 percent); four African-Americans\n(5.48 percent); three mixed-race16 individuals (4.11 percent); four Hispanics (5.48\npercent); and three (4.11 percent) whose race is not reflected in the questionnaires.\n       Jurors were called into the jury box in random order for the parties to\nexercise peremptory challenges. Each side had 30 challenges, with 12 additional\nchallenges to use for the alternates. Defendant and Patterson agreed to exercise\ntheir challenges jointly. The prosecutor exercised 10 peremptory challenges in\nselecting the trial jury and eight in selecting the alternates. Three of these\nchallenges were made against African-American panelists. After each, the defense\njointly asserted a Batson/Wheeler motion. The court held a hearing and issued a\ndetailed ruling denying the motions.\n       Including alternates, the jury was composed of 11 women and seven men,\nranging in age from 24 to 61 years old. All major cities in the county were\nrepresented except Fremont, Pleasanton, and Berkeley. Thirteen of the jurors were\nCaucasian, three were Hispanic, and two were Asian.\n\n\n16    These jurors identified as Puerto Rican/Hawaiian, Asian/Hispanic, and\nCaucasian/Latino.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f                      ii.    Analysis of Individual Challenges\n       Both state and federal Constitutions prohibit the use of peremptory\nchallenges to remove prospective jurors based on their race or membership in a\ncognizable group. (Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 89; Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at\npp. 276-277.) A three-step inquiry governs the analysis of Batson/Wheeler claims.\n―First, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has made a prima facie\nshowing that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge based on race.\nSecond, if the showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to demonstrate\nthat the challenges were exercised for a race-neutral reason. Third, the court\ndetermines whether the defendant has proven purposeful discrimination. The\nultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never\nshifts from, the opponent of the strike. [Citation.]‖ (People v. Lenix (2008) 44\nCal.4th 602, 612-613; see also Johnson v. California (2005) 545 U.S. 162, 168.)\n       ―A prima facie case of racial discrimination in the use of peremptory\nchallenges is established if the totality of the relevant facts ‗ ―gives rise to an\ninference of discriminatory purpose.‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖ (People v. Scott (2015) 61\nCal.4th 363, 384.) At step two of the analysis, the prosecutor ―must provide a\n‗ ―clear and reasonably specific‖ explanation of his ―legitimate reasons‖ for\nexercising the challenges.‘ [Citation.] ‗The justification need not support a\nchallenge for cause, and even a ―trivial‖ reason, if genuine and neutral, will\nsuffice.‘ [Citation.] A prospective juror may be excused based upon facial\nexpressions, gestures, hunches, and even for arbitrary or idiosyncratic reasons.‖\n(People v. Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) However, ―race-based decisions are\nnot constitutionally tolerable.‖ (Id. at p. 621; accord, Rice v. Collins (2006) 546\nU.S. 333, 338.)\n       The People do not dispute the trial court‘s finding that a prima facie case\nhad been established. Accordingly, we focus on the third Batson/Wheeler prong\nand examine whether the African-American panelists were excused due to\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\fintentional discrimination. (See People v. Mills, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 174;\nPeople v. Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613, fn. 8.)\n       ―At the third stage of the Wheeler/Batson inquiry, ‗the issue comes down to\nwhether the trial court finds the prosecutor‘s race-neutral explanations to be\ncredible. Credibility can be measured by, among other factors, the prosecutor‘s\ndemeanor; by how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by\nwhether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.‘ (Miller-\nEl [v. Cockrell (2003)] 537 U.S. [322,] 339.)‖ (People v. Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th\nat p. 613, fn. omitted.) Implausible or fantastic justifications offered at the second\nstage may not be sufficiently credible to pass muster at stage three. (Purkett v.\nElem (1995) 514 U.S. 765, 768.) ―In assessing credibility, the court draws upon\nits contemporaneous observations of the voir dire.‖ (Lenix, at p. 613.) This\nassessment may also take into account ―the court‘s own experiences as a lawyer\nand bench officer in the community, and even the common practices of the\nadvocate and the office that employs him or her. (See Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d\nat p. 281.)‖ (Lenix, at p. 613.)\n       ―We review a trial court‘s determination regarding the sufficiency of a\nprosecutor‘s justifications for exercising peremptory challenges ‗ ―with great\nrestraint.‖ ‘ [Citation.] We presume that a prosecutor uses peremptory challenges\nin a constitutional manner and give great deference to the trial court‘s ability to\ndistinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses. [Citation.] So long as the trial\ncourt makes a sincere and reasoned effort to evaluate the nondiscriminatory\njustifications offered, its conclusions are entitled to deference on appeal.\n[Citation.]‖ (People v. Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 864.)\n       Here, in making its ―sincere and reasoned‖ evaluation, the court carefully\nexamined each of the prosecutor‘s explanations after independent review of the\nvoir dire transcripts and its own notes about the jurors‘ demeanor. (See People v.\nWilliams (2013) 58 Cal.4th 197, 283-284.) The court clearly understood its duty\nto scrutinize the prosecutor‘s reasons to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham\n\n\n                                          26\n\fexcuses contrived to hide discrimination. (See People v. DeHoyos (2013) 57\nCal.4th 79, 115.) It issued an unusually detailed, careful ruling, referring to\nspecific portions of voir dire and citing numerous authorities. Accordingly, its\ndecision is entitled to deference and must be upheld if it is supported by\nsubstantial evidence. (People v. Lomax (2010) 49 Cal.4th 530, 571; People v.\nLenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.)\n                             a)     Prospective Juror E.T.\n       The prosecutor used his second peremptory challenge to excuse Prospective\nJuror E.T., a retired credit manager from Oakland married to a retired federal\nimmigration agent. She stated in the questionnaire that she had been arrested for\nobstruction of justice but did not explain her answer. During voir dire, she\nexplained that she and a police officer ―kind of got into a thing‖ when she was\nhelping her sister leave her husband. She said the officer pushed her and ―made\nsome kind of remarks.‖ She retaliated, and ―[i]t escalated from that.‖ She was\narrested but the charges were dropped.\n       In the questionnaire, E.T. described her general opinion about the death\npenalty as neutral but also stated, ―If you take a life be prepared to give up your\nlife.‖ In voir dire, she said she had ―mixed feelings‖ about capital punishment.\nShe explained that, according to the Bible, ―only God is supposed to be able to\nreally take somebody‘s life,‖ and ―[i]t‘s not our place‖ to kill someone; however,\nshe also believed people shouldn‘t be allowed to murder others.\n       The prosecutor cited these mixed feelings about the death penalty as one\nreason for striking E.T. Another reason, related to the first, was a concern that\nE.T.‘s religious beliefs would make it difficult for her to impose the death penalty.\nThe prosecutor said it raised ―a huge red flag‖ if a potential juror stated that only\nGod can take a life. He explained that, ―as a prosecutor in a death penalty case,\nevery single juror that makes [that] answer [has to be excused] either by cause or\nby peremptory challenge or I‘m not doing my job.‖ He noted no one sitting on the\njury had given such an answer.\n\n\n                                          27\n\f       The prosecutor also cited E.T.‘s attitude toward law enforcement. Before\nvoir dire, he had obtained the police report related to E.T.‘s obstruction of justice\ncharge. The report, which was provided to the defense, revealed a different kind\nof encounter than E.T. described. A uniformed police officer responded to a\nresidence to serve a felony arrest warrant on a person inside. E.T. blocked his\nentry. Even after the officer physically moved her aside, E.T. continued to place\nherself in the officer‘s way until the subject of the warrant was able to escape.\nThe prosecutor believed the incident showed E.T. was unfriendly toward law\nenforcement, and this attitude was especially problematic because the credibility\nof Oakland police officers would be a crucial issue in the case.\n       The prosecutor also observed that Patterson‘s attorney questioned E.T. only\nbriefly and defendant‘s attorney asked no questions at all. Their approach raised\nthe concern that E.T. would favor the defense.\n       The court found each of the prosecutor‘s reasons supported by the record\nand expressive of his true motives in excusing E.T. Substantial evidence supports\nthese findings. E.T. expressed mixed feelings about capital punishment. A juror‘s\nreluctance to impose the death penalty has long been considered a legitimate, race-\nneutral basis for excusal in a capital case. (E.g., People v. Lomax, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 572; People v. Gutierrez (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1083, 1123; People v.\nPride (1992) 3 Cal.4th 195, 230; People v. Johnson (1989) 47 Cal.3d 1194, 1222.)\nThe trial court observed E.T.‘s statement that only God can take a life expressed a\n―startling and dramatic‖ reservation about the death penalty based on what\nappeared to be the juror‘s strongly held religious beliefs. The court observed that\nno other juror had expressed such a strongly held view. We have repeatedly\nupheld peremptory challenges to jurors whose reservations about the death penalty\nare religious in nature. (E.g., People v. Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 725; People\nv. Catlin (2001) 26 Cal.4th 81, 118-119; see People v. Pearson (2013) 56 Cal.4th\n393, 422 [challenge to juror whose religious beliefs would make it ― ‗hard‘ ‖ to\nimpose the death penalty did not support a prima facie case of Wheeler error].)\n\n\n                                          28\n\f       The court found E.T.‘s negative attitude toward law enforcement was an\nindependent reason for the strike. After reading her arrest report for interfering\nwith a police officer, the court concluded E.T. had committed substantial unlawful\nconduct, which she minimized during voir dire. A juror‘s prior arrest is an\naccepted race-neutral reason for peremptory challenge. (People v. Lomax, supra,\n49 Cal.4th at p. 575.) For similar reasons, a juror‘s negative experience with law\nenforcement can also be a valid basis for exclusion. (People v. Gutierrez, supra,\n28 Cal.4th at pp. 1124-1125; see People v. Farnam (2002) 28 Cal.4th 107, 138;\nPeople v. Sanders (1990) 51 Cal.3d 471, 500-501.)\n       Finally, the court noted that defense counsel‘s failure to question a juror\nwas viewed as a valid race-neutral reason justifying the prosecutor‘s peremptory\nchallenge in People v. Ervin (2000) 22 Cal.4th 48, 75. While this reason might\nnot be sufficient in isolation to support a challenge, the absence of any significant\nquestioning by defense counsel is relevant and may legitimately support a\nprosecutor‘s feeling that the panelist would favor the defense. (See ibid.)\n                             b)     Prospective Juror B.C.\n       The prosecutor used his sixth peremptory challenge to excuse B.C., a 54-\nyear-old receptionist from Oakland. B.C. disclosed in the questionnaire that her\ndaughter had been raped two years earlier by a ―high-profile‖ person who was not\nconvicted. She favored strengthening the justice system to give victims justice. In\nvoir dire, B.C. explained that her daughter‘s rapist was a professional basketball\nplayer. The case was investigated by the Alameda Police Department but was\neventually ―dropped.‖\n       B.C. had previously served as the foreperson in a criminal case. In her\nquestionnaire, she stated that the case resulted in a verdict; however, in voir dire,\nshe reported that the jury hung on one count. They found the defendant guilty of\nattempted robbery and being a felon in possession of a firearm but could not reach\na verdict on an attempted murder charge.\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\f       B.C. also expressed the view that minorities are not treated fairly by the\njustice system, explaining that minorities were usually unable to pay for the same\nquality of legal representation available to White defendants. In voir dire, B.C.\nsaid she thought people who can afford a private attorney ―have a better chance in\ncourt‖ than those represented by a public defender, citing the O.J. Simpson case as\nan example. Patterson‘s attorney then told B.C. that in addition to retained\nlawyers and public defenders, some defendants are represented by private lawyers\nwho donate their time. The court remarked after B.C. left the courtroom that this\ncolloquy was misleading. It appeared to give the juror the impression that these\ndefense counsel were donating their time, which was not true. The court noted\nthat the problem had only arisen with B.C. but admonished counsel, ―Don‘t do that\nagain.‖\n       The prosecutor gave several reasons for striking B.C. He mentioned her\nexperience as the foreperson of a hung jury. He gave examples of other panelists\nhe had excused specifically because they had served on hung juries. B.C. was the\nforeperson of a jury that could not agree on the most difficult charge, attempted\nmurder. However, even though the jury hung on one count, B.C. found the\nexperience satisfying and nonstressful. From these answers, the prosecutor\ndeduced that, ―rather than dig in[and] work her way through to a verdict, which\nwould have been a more difficult thing to do,‖ B.C. joined with other jurors and\n―agreed to take the easy way out[,] to simply agree not to agree.‖ He noted that\njurors here would be confronted with a difficult decision if the case reached a\npenalty phase, and he did not want someone on the jury who previously ―took the\neasier way out‖ when she was leading deliberations. The prosecutor also feared\nB.C. would be elected foreperson, because of her experience in that role, ―and\nwhen she was a foreperson before, she led the jury to a hang on the difficult\ncharge.‖\n       The prosecutor also struck B.C. because of her views on the criminal justice\nsystem. She expressed concern in both the questionnaire and voir dire about the\n\n\n                                         30\n\fquality of representation received by people who could not afford private lawyers.\nAfter this discussion, Patterson‘s attorney made comments that gave B.C. the clear\nimpression that he was working on the case for free. The impression that defense\ncounsel were working for free was damaging because B.C. seemed to have a ―full-\nfledged belief that if an African-American defendant can‘t pay his lawyers in the\nway that O.J. did, [he‘s] not getting a fair shake.‖ B.C.‘s views on money in the\ncriminal justice system were highlighted by her assertion that the police or district\nattorney‘s office failed to pursue charges against the professional basketball player\nwho had raped her daughter. The prosecutor summarized: ―So here‘s a juror\nwho‘s been in this situation before as a foreperson, who was willing to take the\neasy way out of a hung jury on a difficult count, who has very strongly held views\nexpressed in her questionnaire and her oral voir dire that money gets you good\nrepresentation, and she has concerns about that in African-American context. . . .\nAnd then we have a defense attorney who stands up and misleads her, leaves her\nwith the impression that he‘s working for free along with the other lawyers here.\nThat‘s a race-neutral reason, your honor. That‘s a situation where that juror was\npoisoned.‖\n       The court found that these reasons reflected the truth of why the prosecutor\nexcused B.C. Again, the court‘s careful findings are amply supported by the\nrecord.\n       The court found B.C.‘s prior service as the foreperson of a criminal jury\nthat hung on the most serious charge justified the use of a peremptory strike. As\nthe court observed, many cases have held service on a hung jury to be an\nappropriate, race-neutral reason for excusing a juror, and this reason alone could\nhave justified the excusal of B.C. (E.g., People v. Taylor (2010) 48 Cal.4th 574,\n644; People v. Ayala (2000) 24 Cal.4th 243, 265-267; People v. Farnam, supra,\n28 Cal.4th at p. 138.) Prior experience on a hung jury ―constitutes a legitimate\nconcern for the prosecution, which seeks a jury that can reach a unanimous\nverdict.‖ (People v. Turner (1994) 8 Cal.4th 137, 170.)\n\n\n                                         31\n\f       The court found that B.C.‘s views about the fairness of the criminal justice\nsystem were also a substantial reason justifying the strike. In many of her\nanswers, B.C. expressed ―real fears‖ that an indigent defendant would suffer a\nsignificant disadvantage and only people who can pay for private lawyers will\nreceive a good defense. ―A prospective juror‘s distrust of the criminal justice\nsystem is a race-neutral basis for excusal. (People v. Turner, supra, 8 Cal.4th at\npp. 170-171.)‖ (People v. Clark (2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 907; see People v. Pride,\nsupra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 230.) Further, the court believed defense counsel‘s\nstatements about private attorneys donating their time created the irrevocable\nimpression that the defense lawyers in this case were working for free. The\nprosecutor was justifiably concerned that B.C. would feel sympathy for the\ndefendants because she would believe they were not receiving adequate\nrepresentation. Finally, the court observed that B.C.‘s views on the disparity of\nrepresentation available to the wealthy were probably reinforced by the fact that\nher daughter‘s rapist, a high-profile and presumably wealthy person, avoided\nprosecution. Skepticism about the fairness of the criminal justice system to\nindigents and racial minorities has also been recognized as a valid race-neutral\nground for excusing a juror. (E.g., People v. Vines (2011) 51 Cal.4th 830, 850-\n852; People v. Calvin (2008) 159 Cal.App.4th 1377, 1386.)\n                            c)     Prospective Juror T.W.\n       Immediately after Prospective Juror T.W. was called into the jury box, the\nprosecutor used his tenth peremptory challenge to excuse him. T.W., a 57-year-\nold maintenance supervisor from Oakland, answered ―yes‖ to questionnaire items\nasking if he knew anyone who had been investigated or charged with a crime or if\nanyone in his family had been arrested or convicted of a crime. When asked to\nexplain these answers, however, he simply drew question marks. In response to a\nquestion about particular types of crimes that upset him, T.W. said, ―Innocent\npeople going to jail.‖ He stated, ―I think the system is unfair to Black[s]‖ when\nasked about the effectiveness of the criminal justice system and checked ―no‖\n\n\n                                         32\n\fwhen asked if the system treats minorities fairly. Expounding on this answer, he\nwrote: ―So much to say[.] The history of slavery go[es] to[o] deep in this\ncountry.‖ Asked if he would like to see changes to the justice system, T.W.\nresponded ―no‖ and explained, ―It [is] the people I want to see changed.‖ T.W.\nsaid he was ―neutral‖ on the death penalty and thought it appropriate in some\ncases. When asked if his views on the death penalty had changed, however, he\nanswered ―yes‖ and commented ―because of the number of Black[s] on death\nrow.‖\n        The trial court explored some of these responses during T.W.‘s voir dire.\nAsked about his comment that innocent people are going to jail, T.W. said, ―We\nseem to be hearing a lot of it lately‖ and recalled hearing that another state had\nreleased many prisoners from death row for this reason. He also mentioned he\nwas upset by the Riders scandal, a highly publicized case involving allegations of\nserious misconduct by four Oakland police officers. He affirmed that he held a\nstrong view ―that African-Americans have not been and are not now being treated\nfairly‖ in the criminal justice system. When asked about his comment that it was\n―the people‖ in the justice system he wanted to see changed, he told the court,\n―Well, I guess I‘m talking about White people,‖ although he conceded that\n―probably a lot of Black people‘s minds are made up as well, and maybe they‘re\nnot capable of making decisions based on facts.‖ Asked to explain his comments\nabout race and capital punishment, T.W. said Black people have not been treated\nfairly in the judicial system and are disproportionately represented on death row.\n        On the subject of whether he could vote to impose the death penalty on an\nAfrican-American defendant, T.W. stated that sentencing someone to death would\nbe ―a very difficult decision‖ regardless of the defendant‘s race. He told the\nprosecutor that he could conceivably impose the death penalty for the murder of a\nsingle adult, but the facts would have to be ―pretty heinous‖ and ―ugly.‖ He also\nsaid ―it seem[ed] unlikely‖ that he could vote for death for two defendants if only\none person had been murdered.\n\n\n                                          33\n\f       Finally, the prosecutor asked if T.W. himself had any experience with being\narrested or taken to jail. He answered that around 20 years earlier, after having too\nmuch to drink, he was arrested during an altercation with a cab driver. Although\nthe police took him to jail, T.W. stated that he had ―probably‖ been treated\nappropriately. Neither of the attorneys conducting voir dire for the defense asked\nT.W. any questions.\n       After this voir dire, the prosecutor challenged T.W. for cause. In the\nquestionnaire, which had been signed under penalty of perjury, T.W. stated that he\nhad not been arrested for any crime and had never ―visited or been incarcerated in,\nany jail, prison, or juvenile detention facility.‖ The prosecutor argued T.W.‘s\nprompt and detailed voir dire answers indicated he clearly remembered his\nprevious arrest and trip to jail. His failure to disclose these facts in the\nquestionnaire could not be attributed to faulty memory. The prosecutor was also\n―deeply concerned‖ about the juror‘s views on race. He remarked that T.W. was\nvery candid about his view that African-Americans are treated unfairly in the\ncriminal justice system and disproportionately placed on death row.\n       The court denied the cause challenge but said it was ―not totally\nsatisfied . . . that this man is a totally impartial juror.‖ The court understood the\nprosecutor‘s concern about having T.W. on the jury, noting it would stretch\ncredulity to assume that T.W.‘s views on racism and African-Americans on death\nrow would not enter into his deliberations and judgment. However, it could not\nconclude as a matter of law that T.W. was too biased to serve.\n       The prosecutor repeated these reasons in explaining why he used a\nperemptory challenge to excuse T.W. He noted the juror had markedly negative\nviews about the police and had mentioned a recent scandal involving Oakland\npolice officers in particular. Because T.W. said he thought the Oakland Police\nDepartment was ―a whole lot better now than it had been‖ despite the egregious\nmisconduct alleged in the case, the prosecutor concluded he held a negative view\nof the department. The prosecutor‘s case depended heavily on the credibility of\n\n\n                                           34\n\fOakland police officers, and he did not believe T.W. would fairly consider their\ntestimony. Negative views about the Oakland police were also evident in T.W.‘s\ndescription of his arrest. The prosecutor argued that T.W.‘s failure to disclose this\nincident in the questionnaire reflected a lack of honesty that was an independent,\nrace-neutral ground for excusal. The prosecutor also cited T.W.‘s reluctance to\nimpose the death penalty and his clear belief that the criminal justice system is\nracist. The prosecutor also observed that defense counsel did not ask the juror a\nsingle question, which suggested their belief that T.W. leaned heavily in their\nfavor.\n         Before ruling on the Batson/Wheeler motion, the court reviewed the\ntranscript of voir dire and the cause challenge hearing as well as its own notes\nabout the juror. Remarking that perhaps the cause challenge should have been\ngranted after all, the court concluded the prosecutor had ample reasons for striking\nT.W. and his race-neutral justifications were sincere. When a prospective juror‘s\nhostility to law enforcement and the criminal justice system is not sufficient to\nsupport a dismissal for cause, it may well justify a prosecutor‘s peremptory\nchallenge. (See, e.g., People v. Williams, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 287.) The court\nnoted T.W. had been arrested by the same police department that investigated the\nmurder. T.W.‘s own arrest was a valid race-neutral reason for excusal. (See\nPeople v. Box (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1153, 1186, 1189.) Moreover, the juror‘s failure\nto disclose his arrest in the questionnaire could reflect a lack of candor, a\nlegitimate concern for the prosecutor. (See, e.g., People v. DeHoyos, supra, 57\nCal.4th at p. 114; People v. Booker (2011) 51 Cal.4th 141, 166-167; People v.\nAyala, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 266.) T.W. also expressed a very low opinion of the\nOakland Police Department. Even if T.W. truly believed the department had\nimproved in recent years, the relevant events took place seven years earlier.\nMoreover, T.W. strongly believed that nonwhite defendants cannot receive a fair\ntrial. A prospective juror‘s views that the criminal justice system is biased, and\nthat the death penalty has been disproportionately imposed against minorities, can\n\n\n                                          35\n\fvalidly support a peremptory strike. (Williams, at p. 285; People v. Vines, supra,\n51 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.) Based on this record, the trial court reasonably\nconcluded T.W.‘s mind was already made up against the prosecution.\n                     iii.   Comparative Analysis\n       As part of our assessment of the court‘s factual findings, we also consider\ncomparisons between African-American panelists the prosecutor challenged with\npanelists of other races who were allowed to serve. (People v. DeHoyos, supra, 57\nCal.4th at p. 103.) ―The rationale for comparative juror analysis is that a side-by-\nside comparison of a prospective juror struck by the prosecutor with a prospective\njuror accepted by the prosecutor may provide relevant circumstantial evidence of\npurposeful discrimination by the prosecutor. [Citations.]‖ (Id. at p. 109.) ―If a\nprosecutor‘s proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an\notherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to\nprove purposeful discrimination to be considered at Batson‘s third step.‖ (Miller-\nEl v. Dretke (2005) 545 U.S. 231, 241.) ―At the same time, ‗we are mindful that\ncomparative juror analysis on a cold appellate record has inherent limitations.‘\n[Citation.] In addition to the difficulty of assessing tone, expression and gesture\nfrom the written transcript of voir dire, we attempt to keep in mind the fluid\ncharacter of the jury selection process and the complexity of the balance involved.\n‗Two panelists might give a similar answer on a given point. Yet the risk posed\nby one panelist might be offset by other answers, behavior, attitudes or\nexperiences that make one juror, on balance, more or less desirable. These\nrealities, and the complexity of human nature, make a formulaic comparison of\nisolated responses an exceptionally poor medium to overturn a trial court‘s factual\nfinding.‘ [Citation.]‖ (People v. Taylor (2009) 47 Cal.4th 850, 887.)\n       Defendant urges this court to conduct a comparative analysis of the excused\npanelists with all 18 of the seated trial jurors and alternates. However, defendant\nhimself compares the excused panelists with only five of the trial jurors and one\nalternate. He makes no contention that comparison with any of the other 12 jurors\n\n\n                                         36\n\fhas probative value. Accordingly, we limit our analysis to the six seated jurors\ndefendant has specifically discussed. (See People v. Lomax, supra, 49 Cal.4th at\np. 572.)17\n       Defendant does not explicitly compare the excused panelists with jurors\nwho were seated. Rather, he argues two of the prosecutor‘s reasons for dismissing\nthe panelists were pretextual because Caucasian jurors who expressed similar\nviews were not excused. Pretext is established, however, when the compared\njurors have expressed ―a substantially similar combination of responses,‖ in all\nmaterial respects, to the jurors excused. (People v. DeHoyos, supra, 57 Cal.4th at\np. 107, italics added.) Although jurors need not be completely identical for a\ncomparison to be probative (see Miller-El v. Dretke, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 247,\nfn. 6), ―they must be materially similar in the respects significant to the\nprosecutor‘s stated basis for the challenge.‖ (DeHoyos, at p. 107.)\n       Defendant raised a comparative analysis argument in the trial court, and the\nprosecutor responded by explaining why he accepted some jurors who expressed\nbeliefs similar to those he struck. The trial court accepted the prosecutor‘s\nreasons, and we too conclude they do not support an inference of discriminatory\nmotive.\n       Like B.C. and T.W., three seated jurors and one alternate expressed the\nview that the criminal justice system is unfair to minorities. However, the\nprosecutor adequately explained why each of the seated jurors was stronger for the\nprosecution than those excused.\n       Juror No. 5, a Puerto Rican financial advisor, checked ―no‖ on the\nquestionnaire when asked if the criminal justice system treats minorities fairly and\nexplained, ―Empirical data has proven this fact.‖ However, based on this juror‘s\ndemeanor and questionnaire responses, the prosecutor viewed him as ―a\n\n\n17     In any event, we have examined the responses of the remaining jurors and\nfind nothing that casts doubt on the trial court‘s findings.\n\n\n                                          37\n\fconservative person‖ with ―strong beliefs in the need for people to take personal\nresponsibility for their actions.‖ The prosecutor explained that he accepted Juror\nNo. 5 because of his strong support for the death penalty. For example, he stated\nthat he would vote in favor of the death penalty on a ballot initiative because\n―[c]ertain crimes need to be dealt with [by] the death of the convicted.‖ Even\nmore important, when asked in voir dire whether death or a life sentence would be\nharder to impose, Juror No. 5 indicated they would be equally difficult. The\nprosecutor explained that in his experience, a juror who perceives either penalty to\nbe a difficult choice is likely to be ―very favorably disposed towards imposing the\ndeath penalty.‖18\n       Juror No. 6, a registered nurse, stated that the criminal justice system treats\nminorities fairly ―not at all times, but usually.‖ However, this juror had life\nexperience the prosecutor reasonably believed would favor his side. Three years\nearlier, the 13-year-old niece of the juror‘s husband was murdered by a serial\nkiller. The killer was then on death row in Texas. When asked about her views on\nthe death penalty, Juror No. 6 said she knew that California had over 600 people\non death row but had executed only three people in the past 10 years. She hoped\nthe state would either start carrying out the sentences or change the law.\nNonetheless, she viewed the death penalty as a strong symbolic statement that\ncould hopefully deter similar crimes. The prosecutor described Juror No. 6‘s voir\ndire as ―perhaps the most articulate recitation of a variety of kinds of reasons for\nvoting for the death penalty as any juror [he had] ever come across.‖ He found her\nto be ―a remarkably strong juror‖ for the prosecution.\n\n\n18     Although the prosecutor justified his challenges to E.T. and T.W., in part,\nbecause the defense had failed to question them in voir dire, defense counsel also\nasked no questions of Juror No. 5. The prosecutor observed that Juror No. 5 was\nthe only juror he had accepted whom defense counsel did not question. He\nbelieved Juror No. 5 leaned toward the prosecution, however, observing that he\nand the defense ―probably have a pretty big disagreement about where that juror\nsits.‖\n\n\n                                          38\n\f       Juror No. 11 was a fire department captain. He placed an ―x‖ on the\nquestionnaire in between ―yes‖ and ―no‖ when asked if the justice system treats\nminorities fairly. He explained, ―I have seen newspaper and news accounts that\naddress this. I do believe that ethnicity is an issue in the criminal justice system.\nHowever, I have no strong personal opinion.‖ The prosecutor recalled that he\nliked Juror No. 11 because he seemed focused on the issue of remorse. He stated\nin the questionnaire that the death penalty was appropriate only for cases involving\nextreme acts for which the defendant showed no remorse. Noting that both\ndefendants had committed significant postmurder violence, including attempts to\nintimidate a witness, the prosecutor predicted he would ―do pretty well on [the\nremorse] issue‖ with this juror. Also, like Juror No. 5, Juror No. 11 said in voir\ndire that both death and life imprisonment are severe penalties, and he would not\nhave more difficulty imposing either one.\n       Some seated jurors also made statements similar to B.C.‘s comments that\nmoney is necessary to buy a good defense. However, their sentiments on this\nissue were generally milder, or qualified. The prosecutor reasonably viewed them\nas stronger jurors for his side.\n       Juror No. 8 referred to the influence of wealth obliquely when she\ncommented in the questionnaire that the O.J. Simpson trial had made her\n―somewhat skeptical‖ of the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. The\nprosecutor was impressed with her prior jury service in a murder trial, however.\nJuror No. 8 and one other juror believed the defendant was guilty of the greater\noffense, but the rest of the jury believed only the lesser offense had been proven.\nAware that the verdict had to be unanimous, after much deliberation she and the\nother juror switched sides, convicting the defendant of the lesser offense. Juror\nNo. 8 commented that they later learned, after talking with the judge, that they\n―had given the wrong verdict.‖ From Juror No. 8‘s description of this experience,\nthe prosecutor saw her as someone ―who made great strides to reach a unanimous\nverdict.‖ As for the fact that Juror No. 8 had talked herself into voting not guilty\n\n\n                                          39\n\fon a murder charge, only to find out later that she had made a mistake, the\nprosecutor believed she would see this case as ―an opportunity to redo her jury\nservice‖ and would not make the same mistake again.\n       Juror No. 10, a supervisor of a grocery store meat department, stated in her\nquestionnaire that the criminal justice system is ―very effective if you have plenty\nof money & an excellent attorney.‖ She also checked ―yes‖ when asked whether\nminorities are treated unfairly in the criminal justice system. The prosecutor\nexplained that he liked jurors who are supervisors because they often have to make\nhard decisions in their job. Because Juror No. 10 was a butcher, he felt she would\nnot be overwhelmed by gory evidence in the case. The prosecutor also noted two\nways in which Juror No. 10 shared similarities with victim Beeson: She had a\nhistory of drug abuse, and her husband had strangled her during an argument. In\naddition, when asked in the general portion of the questionnaire if she would like\nto see any changes to the criminal justice system, Juror No. 10 volunteered that\nshe wanted to ―narrow the appeals down on death penalty cases.‖ She repeated in\nvoir dire that if there was no doubt of a defendant‘s guilt, she did not see the need\nto spend money and court time on lengthy appeals. In light of these answers, the\nprosecutor believed she was a strong juror.\n       Like Juror No. 10, Alternate Juror No. 16 expressed doubts about the\nfairness of the justice system to minorities and the indigent. She stated in the\nquestionnaire that the criminal justice system is ―generally effective – but access\n(financially) to effective attorneys can be beneficial.‖ When asked if minorities\nare fairly treated, she answered, ―For the most part yes[,] but as in all aspects of\nlife some people can be judged (unfairly) based on their race or ethnicity.‖ The\nprosecutor did not recall details of Alternate Juror No. 16‘s questionnaire or voir\ndire except that she was strongly in favor of the death penalty and that her brother-\nin-law was a judge in Kern County. Although she circled the questionnaire\nresponse stating she was ―moderately in favor‖ of the death penalty, rather than\n―strongly in favor,‖ we do not agree with defendant‘s assertion that the prosecutor\n\n\n                                          40\n\fmischaracterized the juror‘s views in a manner that evidences discriminatory\npretext. (See Miller-El v. Dretke, supra, 545 U.S. at pp. 244-246; Cook v.\nLaMarque (9th Cir. 2010) 593 F.3d 810, 818.) Moreover, we find reasonable the\nprosecutor‘s reliance on the fact that Alternate Juror No. 16 was related to a sitting\njudge as an explanation for why the prosecutor chose not to challenge her.\n       The prosecutor gave reasonable explanations for why he viewed each of\nthese seated jurors as more favorable than excused panelists E.T., B.C., and T.W.\nComparative analysis does not suggest that the prosecutor‘s reasons for striking\nthese panelists were pretexts for unlawful discrimination.\n                     iv.    Statistical Arguments\n       Apart from individual and comparative juror analyses designed to ferret out\npretext, defendant insists discrimination must have occurred because it was\nstatistically improbable that no African-Americans would serve on a jury in\nAlameda County. He notes that while African-Americans comprised only about 6\npercent of the panel, the prosecutor used 30 percent of his peremptory challenges\nagainst them, excusing 100 percent of the African-American panelists called into\nthe jury box.\n       In regard to whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been\nestablished under Batson‘s first step, we have observed that the excusal of all\nmembers of a particular group may suggest impropriety. (People v. Pearson,\nsupra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 422; People v. Crittenden (1994) 9 Cal.4th 83, 119.)\nStatistical evidence about the underrepresentation of certain groups in the venire\nmay also be relevant to this prima facie showing. (See Johnson v. California,\nsupra, 545 U.S. at pp. 169-170 & fn. 5.) Here, however, the trial court found a\nprima facie case had been established and proceeded to the second and third steps\nof the Batson/Wheeler inquiry. The existence of a prima facie case is therefore not\nin dispute. The only dispute here concerns whether the court properly found that\nthe inference of discrimination was rebutted by the race-neutral justifications\ngiven for the strikes. (See Johnson, at p. 168.)\n\n\n                                         41\n\f       We are aware of no case holding that statistical evidence about the\nunderrepresentation of particular groups on a venire, or jury panel, can be\nsufficient to undermine a trial court‘s considered findings at the third step of a\nBatson/Wheeler analysis. By the third step, the court has already found that\nexclusion of jurors from a particular group requires explanation. (See Johnson v.\nCalifornia, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 173.) The question at the third step is not\nwhether the defendant can plausibly urge systematic exclusion, but whether any\nparticular panelist was, in fact, excused due to group bias. (See People v. Avila\n(2006) 38 Cal.4th 491, 549.) Defendant argues the Supreme Court‘s discussion of\nthe percentage of African-American panel members struck in Miller-El v. Dretke,\nsupra, 545 U.S. at pages 240 to 241, supports the relevance of statistics to third\nstep inquiries. The high court did discuss these facts as relevant background.\nHowever, its conclusion that at least two panelists were dismissed because of\nmanifest racial prejudice was not based solely on statistics but also on a close\nanalysis of the voir dire responses of dismissed panelists and seated jurors, the use\nof racially discriminatory practices such as ―shuffling‖ the jury panels, disparities\nin the prosecutor‘s questioning of African-American panelists, and a systemic\npolicy of the district attorney‘s office to exclude African-Americans from juries.\n(Id. at pp. 241-264.) While statistical facts may retain some relevance at Batson‘s\nthird step as part of the universe of evidence bearing on the plausibility of asserted\njustifications for a strike (see id. at pp. 251-252), no case has suggested such facts\nalone could be sufficient to establish pretext.\n       Defendant complains that his jury consisted of eight Caucasians, two\nAsians and two Latinos, whereas, ―if race were not an issue . . . one would have\nexpected five white jurors, three Asian jurors, two Latinos, [and] two blacks.‖\nHowever, we have long held that ―no litigant has the right to a jury that mirrors the\ndemographic composition of the population, or necessarily includes members of\nhis own group, or indeed is composed of any particular individuals.‖ (Wheeler,\nsupra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 277.) Nor does the Sixth Amendment demand such a\n\n\n                                          42\n\fprecise correlation between the demographics of the community and a particular\njury. ―Although a defendant has a right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section\nof the community as a means of ensuring his or her right to an impartial jury, he or\nshe has no right to a jury that reflects the racial composition of the community.\n[Citations.]‖ (People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 119-120.) As the\nSupreme Court has explained, ―[t]he Sixth Amendment requirement of a fair cross\nsection on the venire is a means of assuring, not a representative jury (which the\nConstitution does not demand), but an impartial one (which it does).‖ (Holland v.\nIllinois (1990) 493 U.S. 474, 480.)\n         Finally, to the extent defendant‘s statistical arguments urge that the venire\nwas not representative, the claim has not been preserved for appeal. Defendant\nneither objected to the panel nor moved to quash the venire. (See People v. Lewis\n(2001) 25 Cal.4th 610, 634.) Nor has he attempted to support the claim by\nshowing that the jury selection process in Alameda County results in the\nsystematic exclusion of African-Americans. (See Duren v. Missouri (1979) 439\nU.S. 357, 364; Lewis, at pp. 634-635.)\n         3.     Admission of Defendant’s Confessions\n         Defendant sought to exclude his recorded statements about Beeson‘s\nmurder. The confessions were made after full Miranda warnings (see Miranda,\nsupra, 384 U.S. 436), but defendant argued they were involuntary because they\nwere induced by ―the intentional application of psychological pressure‖ and a\npromise of leniency to avoid the death penalty. After a lengthy hearing, the court\nfound all of the statements admissible. Defendant renews his arguments, claiming\nreversible error. Substantial evidence supports the factual findings below. We\nindependently conclude as a legal matter that the statements were voluntarily\ngiven.\n                a.     Background\n         On May 1, 1996, police officers questioned Patterson about the murder\nafter they found Botello‘s shotgun in his home. Patterson initially denied specific\n\n\n                                           43\n\fknowledge but ultimately admitted his involvement and identified defendant as the\nmurderer. The police then advised Patterson of his Miranda rights again and took\na recorded statement. Patterson‘s interview concluded shortly before 1:00 a.m.\n       A day later, officers brought defendant to the police department. He was\nplaced in a homicide interview room without handcuffs at 10:15 a.m. About an\nhour later, Sergeants Enoch Olivas and John McKenna began the interview.\nDefendant was immediately advised of his Miranda rights and waived them, both\norally and in writing. The officers used no physical force during the interview and\nmade no threats or promises to induce cooperation. Altogether, defendant spoke\nto the police from 11:07 a.m. until 2:00 a.m. the next morning, when he finished\ngiving his final recorded statement about the crimes. This interview was\nconducted in relatively short sessions, with lengthy breaks between. Defendant\nwas given food, drink, and access to a bathroom.\n       During the first session, defendant discussed how he knew Botello and\nPatterson. After 50 minutes of questioning, officers took an hour-long break and\ndefendant had lunch. Questioning resumed for another hour and 15 minutes.\nDefendant talked more about Patterson and how he knew Maceo Smith. He\nspeculated that a power outage at his grandmother‘s house was the reason his\nankle monitoring bracelet did not transmit a signal during some days in December.\nAt the end of the session, Sergeant Olivas said he had evidence that defendant was\ninvolved in Beeson‘s murder. He did not mention Patterson‘s interview or\ndisclose other details. Defendant denied any involvement. The third interview\nsession began after a 40-minute break and lasted a little over an hour. Defendant\nacknowledged visiting Botello‘s apartment and, contrary to his earlier statements,\nnow admitted he had noticed Botello‘s shotgun. The officers brought defendant\nanother meal during a 45-minute break.\n       The fourth interview session lasted about an hour and a half. Sergeant\nOlivas showed defendant photographs that depicted Patterson in custody and\nplayed the first four or five minutes of Patterson‘s taped confession. Olivas\n\n\n                                         44\n\ftestified that the portion he played did not include details about the murder, nor\ndid he supply defendant with any details from Patterson‘s account about how the\nmurder had been committed. Nevertheless, defendant‘s countenance changed\nnoticeably. Whereas he had displayed confidence, smirking and saying the\nofficers ―didn‘t have anything on him,‖ defendant now dropped his head. He\nmouthed, ―that motherfucker,‖ and said, ―the streets made me bitter.‖ After more\nquestioning, defendant admitted he went to Botello‘s apartment to commit a\nrobbery but said, ―I didn‘t plan it the way it happened.‖ He explained that Beeson\n―didn‘t take the robbery seriously.‖ The officers took a 10-minute break.\n       When the interview resumed for another hour-long session, defendant made\nadditional statements which Sergeant Olivas wrote down verbatim. Defendant\nsaid: ― ‗I admit I was there‘ ‖; ― ‗If I get the death penalty, I get it‘ ‖; ― ‗Once I got\nthere, it all went sour‘ ‖; ― ‗I have to play it out‘ ‖; and ― ‗I‘m fucked.‘ ‖ Sergeants\nOlivas and McKenna both testified that they never mentioned the death penalty or\nany possible punishments. Defendant was the first to mention the penalty. His\nremark was unsolicited and not responsive. The officers did not acknowledge the\nremark or discuss penalties with defendant in any way. They took a 90-minute\nbreak after this session and set up equipment for the next interview session to be\nsurreptitiously recorded. Sergeant Olivas believed defendant would soon start\ndescribing details about the murder, and he did not want to inhibit this disclosure\nby openly recording.\n       The next interview session began again shortly after 9:00 p.m. Before the\nquestioning started, defendant remarked, ― ‗I‘m going to get what I‘m going to\nget.‘ ‖ The officers then showed defendant photographs of Beeson and began\nrecording. Defendant then confessed to robbing and murdering Beeson. He gave\nmany details about the chronology, including what he and Patterson each did to\nBeeson, the items they stole, and how they disposed of the knife. Specifically, he\nsaid Patterson hit Beeson with the barrel of Botello‘s shotgun and she began\nmaking a lot of noise. Defendant gave his belt to Patterson and told him to choke\n\n\n                                           45\n\fher into unconsciousness. When Patterson was unsuccessful, defendant grabbed\nan end of the belt, and they choked her together for several minutes. Because\nBeeson was still conscious and they worried about her making noise, defendant\ntook a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her repeatedly in the shoulder and back\nof the neck. When they left, he thought Beeson was probably dead. Defendant\nwas very animated in retelling the events, even acting out for the officers how he\nand Patterson had choked their victim and where on the neck he had stabbed her.\nAt the end of this interview session, defendant said, ―Man, I get this off my chest,\nman.‖\n        During a short break, the officers brought recording equipment into the\ninterview room. Defendant waived his Miranda rights again and gave a formal\ntaped statement. He again blamed Patterson for hitting Beeson with the shotgun\nand starting to choke her, but he admitted he grabbed the belt and choked Beeson\nalso. Defendant also took full responsibility for the stabbing, although he said he\nonly meant to quiet Beeson down so that he and Patterson could leave. When he\nrealized the wounds could kill her, and it looked like she was suffering, defendant\nsaid he stabbed her one final time ―[t]o finish it off.‖ Sergeant Olivas testified\nthat, throughout the interview, he never talked with defendant about the\npunishment for murder or circumstances that would implicate the death penalty.\n        After giving the recorded statement, defendant asked to call his mother. He\nwas allowed to do so but was warned that all telephone calls were monitored.\nAfter the recording equipment was installed, defendant called and told his mother\nthat he and Patterson had murdered a woman. He explained he had confessed to\nthe police because he heard a taped statement in which Patterson was trying to\nminimize his own responsibility. Defendant said he told the police the truth\nbecause he thought they would seek the death penalty against him, whereas\nPatterson would get a reduced sentence. He thought he would probably spend the\nrest of his life in prison.\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\f       Later that night, defendant gave two more recorded statements to a deputy\ndistrict attorney. The first described the robbery and murder in full detail. The\nsecond was an Aranda statement recounting the events of that evening without\nmention of Patterson‘s involvement.19 Each of these statements was preceded by\nMiranda warnings followed by defendant‘s repeated waivers.\n       Defendant testified that he was not harmed or threatened during the\ninterview, and his physical needs were provided for. The interview‘s tone was\ncordial and respectful at the start but turned accusatory when Sergeant McKenna\nshowed him a photograph of Botello‘s shotgun. McKenna said defendant‘s\nfingerprints were found on the gun and the police had learned defendant was\npressuring and threatening Botello before the murder. Defendant claimed\nMcKenna said ―I might as well help myself, defend myself right now, or else they\nwould have to assume the worst and I would get the death penalty.‖ The officers\nplayed him the entire tape of Patterson‘s confession. Afterward, defendant asked\nwhat could happen if he gave additional information. Sergeant McKenna\nresponded that talking could help ―clear‖ him of the death penalty if the murder\nwas unintentional or accidental. Defendant testified that he changed his story\nbecause, with Patterson‘s statement and his fingerprints on the gun, the case\nagainst him appeared strong, and he did not want to risk the death penalty. He\nasked what would happen if he admitted more knowledge of the murder and said\nMcKenna promised to call a friend at the district attorney‘s office. Then\ndefendant ―wouldn‘t have to worry about the death penalty if they [kept] their end\nof the bargain.‖ Defendant believed the officers ―had all the power‖ and could\nremove the case from death penalty consideration if he cooperated.\n       Sociology professor Richard Ofshe, Ph.D., testified as an expert on\ninfluence and police interrogation. Based on the interview tapes and transcripts\nand defendant‘s own recollection about unrecorded portions of the interview,\n\n\n19     See People v. Aranda (1965) 63 Cal.2d 518.\n\n\n                                         47\n\fOfshe concluded the police used psychologically coercive tactics to secure\ndefendant‘s confession. Specifically, in the professor‘s opinion, defendant‘s\nstatements in the phone call to his mother indicated he believed he was avoiding\nthe death penalty and securing a lighter sentence by admitting involvement.\nAlthough these statements did not prove capital punishment was threatened, they\ndid suggest the subject came up during questioning. Ofshe also testified that\ndefendant‘s confession was ―contaminat[ed]‖ because it came after defendant\nheard the recording of Patterson‘s statement. He explained, ―contamination can\ngive someone information necessary to tell a story that fits the crime facts even if\nthey weren‘t there.‖ Ofshe discounted testimony that the tape was played for only\nfive minutes because Patterson did not implicate defendant until later in his\nstatement. Finally, Ofshe believed defendant‘s unpersuasive claim that the murder\nwas accidental was an attempt to obtain leniency.\n       On cross-examination, Ofshe conceded that generally accepted procedure\ndid not require the police to record all phases of defendant‘s interview.\nEncouraging defendant to feel angry with Patterson was not a psychologically\ncoercive tactic. Nor was it inappropriate for the police to play defendant a portion\nof Patterson‘s recorded confession. Ofshe conceded the police did not appear to\nhave used any psychologically coercive tactics during the recorded portions of\ndefendant‘s interview.\n       After examining all relevant circumstances in a lengthy, thoughtful ruling,\nthe court determined beyond a reasonable doubt that all of defendant‘s statements\nwere voluntary. The court found both police officers credible based on the criteria\nset forth in CALJIC No. 2.20 and concluded both gave truthful accounts of\ndefendant‘s interviews. Indeed, with regard to personal demeanor, the court\nobserved that ―one would be hard-pressed to find a more mild-mannered,\nin[]offensive, unantagonistic, soft-spoken, nonconfrontational, pleasant man than\nSergeant Olivas.‖ Nothing about the content of defendant‘s statements or his tone\nof voice on the recordings suggested he was speaking under physical or\n\n\n                                         48\n\fpsychological duress. Nor did defendant say anything in the recordings to suggest\nthat any deal had been offered regarding his penalty. Based on the officers‘\nunequivocal testimony and the absence of any contrary suggestion in defendant‘s\nrecorded statements, the court found that no threats or deals had been made about\nthe death penalty. Defendant told his mother he believed he could avoid the death\npenalty by cooperating with the police, ―telling them the truth,‖ but he never\nattributed this belief to anything the officers said to him. Defendant was\nextraordinarily experienced with the criminal justice system, had been interrogated\nby law enforcement and juvenile justice authorities many times before, and would\nnot have been easily intimidated or coerced by the questioning here. Finally, the\ncourt rejected Dr. Ofshe‘s testimony as heavily biased and based on unsupported\nhypothetical scenarios, such as death penalty threats made during a suspect‘s trips\nto the bathroom. All of defendant‘s statements were admitted at trial.\n              b.      Analysis\n       State and federal constitutional principles prohibit a conviction based on an\ninvoluntary confession. (Lego v. Twomey (1972) 404 U.S. 477, 483; People v.\nMassie (1998) 19 Cal.4th 550, 576.) ―The prosecution has the burden of\nestablishing by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant‘s confession was\nvoluntarily made. [Citations.] In determining whether a confession was\nvoluntary, ‗ ―[t]he question is whether defendant‘s choice to confess was not\n‗essentially free‘ because his [or her] will was overborne.‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖ (People\nv. Carrington (2009) 47 Cal.4th 145, 169.) To be considered involuntary, a\nconfession must have resulted from coercive police conduct rather than outside\ninfluences. (Colorado v. Connelly (1986) 479 U.S. 157, 164-167.)\n       A confession‘s voluntariness depends upon the totality of the circumstances\nin which it was made. (People v. Carrington, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 169;\nSchneckloth v. Bustamonte (1973) 412 U.S. 218, 226.) Relevant factors include:\n― ‗ ―the crucial element of police coercion [citation]; the length of the interrogation\n[citation]; its location [citation]; its continuity‖ as well as ―the defendant‘s\n\n\n                                           49\n\fmaturity [citation]; education [citation]; physical condition [citation]; and mental\nhealth.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Massie, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 576.) No single factor is\ndispositive. (People v. Williams (2010) 49 Cal.4th 405, 436.)\n       Our standard of review is well established. Voluntariness is a legal\nquestion subject to independent review; a trial court‘s related factual findings are\nupheld if supported by substantial evidence. (People v. Carrington, supra, 47\nCal.4th at p. 169; People v. Holloway (2004) 33 Cal.4th 96, 114; People v. Massie,\nsupra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 576.) When the evidence conflicts, the reviewing court\nmust accept the version of events most favorable to the People as long as it finds\nsupport in the record. (People v. Tully (2012) 54 Cal.4th 952, 993; People v.\nThompson (1990) 50 Cal.3d 134, 166.)\n       Defendant‘s primary argument is that police officers improperly coerced his\nconfession by mentioning the death penalty and either explicitly or implicitly\npromising he would receive a lighter sentence if he confessed. Although\nconfessions procured by threats of prosecution for a capital crime have been held\ninadmissible (see People v. Thompson, supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 169), mere\n―[r]eference to the death penalty does not necessarily render a statement\ninvoluntary.‖ (People v. Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 443.) A constitutional\nviolation arises ―only where the confession results directly from the threat [capital]\npunishment will be imposed if the suspect is uncooperative, coupled with a\n‗promise [of] leniency in exchange for the suspect‘s cooperation‘ [citation].‖\n(People v. Holloway, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 116.)\n       There was a square conflict in the evidence concerning whether defendant\nwas threatened or promised leniency. The court‘s resolution of this factual\nquestion rested heavily on credibility assessments. Sergeants Olivas and\nMcKenna both denied mentioning the death penalty or discussing the subject of\npunishment during defendant‘s interviews. They testified that defendant made an\nunsolicited remark about the death penalty in an unrecorded session but that they\ndid not respond or even acknowledge the remark. Although defendant made\n\n\n                                         50\n\fstatements to his mother suggesting a belief he would not get the death penalty if\nhe confessed, nothing in the transcript of the call, or elsewhere in the record,\nreveals the source of this misunderstanding. The trial court expressly found the\nofficers‘ testimony credible. It found defendant‘s contrary account, and his\nexpert‘s inferences based on that account, unbelievable. Substantial evidence\nsupports these findings. We independently conclude defendant‘s statements were\nnot coerced by express or implied promises of leniency. (See People v. Tully,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 993; People v. Boyette, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 412.)\n       This conclusion is not undermined by defendant‘s complaint that he was\nyoung and ―had a limited educational background.‖ Despite his youth, defendant\nhad extensive experience with the criminal justice system, beginning in his early\nteens. He testified that he knew his Miranda rights. In his phone call to his\nmother he was even able to explain the difference between Three Strikes and\nindeterminate sentencing for murder. The record also belies defendant‘s claim\nthat the police deceived him by claiming they had his fingerprints on Botello‘s\nshotgun, playing all of Patterson‘s taped confession, or suggesting that the murder\nwas accidental. None of these assertions was corroborated. The trial court\nreasonably rejected defendant‘s testimony.\n       Defendant also now claims the length of his interrogation rendered it\ninvoluntary. Below, defendant expressly disclaimed any challenge based on\ndeprivation of physical needs. Assuming he did not thereby forfeit his present\ncomplaint about interrogation conditions, the claim fails on the merits. Defendant\nmisleadingly asserts that he was interrogated continuously for over 16 hours,\npunctuated only by psychologically coercive ―periods of isolation.‖ In fact, as\ndefendant‘s trial counsel observed, defendant was in custody and interviewed for\nonly about six hours before he confessed to murdering Beeson. The officers\nprovided defendant with meals and access to the restroom. The questioning was\ninterspersed with numerous breaks. Indeed, the trial court observed that the\nsessions between breaks were shorter than those at court. Although defendant was\n\n\n                                          51\n\fleft alone in the interview room, these relatively brief periods of solitude did not\nrender the interview coercive, or the resulting statements involuntary. The police\nwere under no obligation to provide defendant with entertainment or diversion.\nThese periods gave him an opportunity to consider his situation, evaluate his\noptions, and change his mind if he chose to do so. The trial court reasonably\ndetermined that the interview sessions were not unduly protracted and all of\ndefendant‘s personal needs were appropriately met. There is no evidence the\npolice ― ‗exploited any ―slowly mounting fatigue‖ ‘ ‖ to coerce a confession.\n(People v. Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 446.) Defendant‘s claim of\ninvoluntariness on this ground fails as well.\n       The cases on which defendant relies are readily distinguishable. In People\nv. Neal (2003) 31 Cal.4th 63, 80-82, the police deliberately continued questioning\nafter the defendant clearly and repeatedly invoked his right to counsel. This\nflagrant violation of Miranda weighed heavily in our conclusion that the\ninterrogation was coercive. (Neal, at p. 81.) Neal was also jailed overnight\nbetween interviews without food, drink, or access to a toilet. (Id. at p. 84.) Here\ndefendant‘s personal needs were accommodated and the officers carefully adhered\nto Miranda, obtaining multiple waivers. (Cf. People v. Williams, supra, 49\nCal.4th at pp. 447-448 [distinguishing Neal on these grounds].) Taylor v. Maddox\n(9th Cir. 2004) 366 F.3d 992 is neither binding nor apposite. In that habeas\nproceeding, the Ninth Circuit found a voluntariness determination unreasonable\nbecause state courts had ignored highly probative testimony supporting the\ndefendant‘s account of his interrogation. (Id. at pp. 1005-1007.) The same cannot\nbe said here; indeed, the trial court‘s careful examination of the evidence is\nespecially notable. Spanning more than 57 pages of the reporter‘s transcript, the\ncourt‘s discussion covered all relevant evidence in extensive detail.\n       4.     Denial of Severance\n       Before trial, defendant moved to sever his case from Patterson‘s, arguing\ntheir antagonistic defenses would undermine verdict reliability and the\n\n\n                                          52\n\fintroduction of Patterson‘s statements would violate defendant‘s right of\nconfrontation. In lengthy hearings, the court and counsel reviewed each line of\nPatterson‘s statement to the police and removed all references that arguably\ninculpated defendant. Having thoroughly and carefully redacted Patterson‘s\nstatement, the court concluded its admission in a joint trial would not prejudice\ndefendant.20 The court ruled that defendant‘s claim of antagonistic defenses was\ninsufficient for severance, citing numerous United States Supreme Court and\nCalifornia cases. (See, e.g., Zafiro v. United States (1993) 506 U.S. 534, 537-538;\nPeople v. Jackson, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 1208.)\n       Defendant renewed his motion for severance at various points during the\ntrial when questioning or argument by Patterson‘s counsel suggested defendant\nbore primary responsibility. These motions were consistently denied. On appeal,\ndefendant again claims he was prejudiced by Patterson‘s defense. He focuses on\nthe testimony of two witnesses.\n       At the guilt phase, evidence was admitted that Julia P. anonymously called\nthe police to report information about the murder. Julia told the police she had\noverheard defendant telling a cousin he had robbed Beeson, and people were\nsaying defendant had either shot or stabbed Beeson when she refused to cooperate.\nA recording of this phone call was played at trial. The evidence was offered as\nproof of Patterson‘s motive for and consciousness of guilt in the assault. The\ncourt admonished the jury that it was being admitted against Patterson only.\nNevertheless, defendant complains the evidence was not probative unless the jury\nfound his confession to be true, and he argues the phone call would not have been\nadmitted at all in a separate trial.\n       Defendant also complains Patterson ―abandoned his defense of innocence‖\nby offering the preliminary hearing testimony of Tyrone Freeman. Freeman had\ntestified that, while they were in custody, defendant said he had murdered a girl\n\n\n20     This issue became moot because Patterson ultimately testified.\n\n\n                                         53\n\fduring a robbery with his brother-in-law ―Nate.‖ The testimony implicated\nPatterson, who was romantically involved with defendant‘s sister. It also\nsuggested defendant was responsible for the actual killing. Defendant now\ncomplains he was prejudiced because the prosecutor elected not to offer\nFreeman‘s testimony.\n       The Legislature has established a strong preference for joint trials. (People\nv. Souza (2012) 54 Cal.4th 90, 109.) Section 1098 states, in relevant part: ―When\ntwo or more defendants are jointly charged with any public offense, whether\nfelony or misdemeanor, they must be tried jointly, unless the court order separate\ntrials.‖ ―Joint trials are favored because they ‗promote [economy and] efficiency‘\nand ‗ ―serve the interests of justice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of\ninconsistent verdicts.‖ ‘ (Zafiro v. United States[, supra,] 506 U.S. [at pp.] 537,\n[539].)‖ (People v. Coffman and Marlow (2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 40 (Coffman and\nMarlow).) We review the denial of a severance motion for abuse of discretion,\nbased on the facts as they appeared at the time of the court‘s ruling. (Id. at p. 41;\nSouza, at p. 109.) ―Even if a trial court abuses its discretion in failing to grant\nseverance, reversal is required only upon a showing that, to a reasonable\nprobability, the defendant would have received a more favorable result in a\nseparate trial. [Citation.]‖ (Coffman and Marlow, at p. 41.)\n       ―When defendants are charged with having committed ‗common crimes\ninvolving common events and victims,‘ as here, the court is presented with a\n‗ ―classic case‖ ‘ for a joint trial. (People v. Keenan (1988) 46 Cal.3d 478, 499-\n500.)‖ (Coffman and Marlow, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 40.) Defendant and\nPatterson were charged with Beeson‘s first degree murder and faced special\ncircumstance allegations. The evidence against both was strong. Their common\nmotivation to shift blame to each other did not by itself compel severance.\n(People v. Letner and Tobin (2010) 50 Cal.4th 99, 150 (Letner and Tobin); People\nv. Jackson, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 1208.) ― ‗If the fact of conflicting or\nantagonistic defenses alone required separate trials, it would negate the legislative\n\n\n                                          54\n\fpreference for joint trials and separate trials ―would appear to be mandatory in\nalmost every case.‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖ (Letner and Tobin, at p. 150.) Instead,\nantagonistic defenses support severance ―only where the acceptance of one party‘s\ndefense precludes the other party‘s acquittal.‖ (Carasi, supra, 44 Cal.4th at\np. 1296; Coffman and Marlow, at p. 41.) If the moving party‘s guilt can be\nestablished by sufficient independent evidence, ―it is not the conflict alone that\ndemonstrates . . . guilt,‖ and severance is not required. (Coffman and Marlow, at\np. 41; see Letner and Tobin, at p. 150; Carasi, at p. 1298.)\n       Defendant‘s arguments for severance fail. The defenses he and Patterson\noffered at trial were largely consistent. Both testified that they were not present at\nthe murder but were tricked into confessing. They each disavowed their own\ninculpatory statements. (See Carasi, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1297.) Rather than\nundermining defendant, Patterson‘s testimony actually supported his claim that the\npolice had coerced him into making a false confession. Indeed, it was defendant,\nnot the prosecutor, who introduced Patterson‘s confession. Defendant relied on\nthe tape to explain how he could have confessed to a murder he later claimed to\nknow nothing about.\n       Even if the jury disbelieved their trial testimony and focused on the police\nstatements, these versions were not sufficiently antagonistic to require severance.\nDefendant and Patterson each admitted to robbing Beeson, leaving her for dead,\nand disposing of the weapon. The only material inconsistency concerned the\ndegree to which each participated in the murderous acts. ― ‗That each was\ninvolved in the incident was undisputed, however . . . . [T]his was not a case in\nwhich only one defendant could be guilty. The prosecution did not charge both\nand leave it to the defendants to convince the jury that the other was [the guilty]\nperson.‘ ‖ (People v. Jackson, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 1209.)\n       Significant independent evidence established defendant‘s guilt. As the trial\ncourt observed in denying his severance motion, ―overwhelming‖ proof of\ndefendant‘s guilt came from evidence ―out of his own mouth.‖ He confessed to\n\n\n                                          55\n\fBeeson‘s murder repeatedly to the police, prosecutors, and his own mother. These\nconfessions, coupled with testimony from others establishing motive and a\ntimeline for the night of the murder, provided ample proof of defendant‘s guilt\napart from Patterson‘s statements. Severance was not required. (Letner and\nTobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 150; Carasi, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1298.)\n       Defendant‘s complaints about specific evidence do not persuade us\notherwise. Although Julia‘s phone call might not have been admitted in a separate\ntrial, it was not admitted against defendant in this trial. The jury was admonished\nthat the evidence was offered only against Patterson. We presume it followed this\ninstruction. (See Letner and Tobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 152; People v. Boyette,\nsupra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 436.) Nor does defendant have cause to complain about the\nadmission of Tyrone Freeman‘s preliminary hearing testimony describing\ndefendant‘s jailhouse confession. This evidence would have been admissible\nagainst defendant in a separate trial. The mere fact that damaging testimony is\npresented by codefendant‘s counsel instead of the prosecutor does not deprive a\ndefendant of constitutional or statutory rights. (People v. Jackson, supra, 13\nCal.4th at p. 1208.)\n       Defendant‘s additional complaints of prejudice at the penalty phase are\nunpersuasive. Defendant complains he was denied his right to individualized\nsentencing because Patterson‘s counsel portrayed him as the more culpable party.\nHowever, this argument would eviscerate the statutory preference for joint trials in\nall capital cases. (See People v. Hardy (1992) 2 Cal.4th 86, 168.) There is no\nindication that the jury was unable or unwilling to assess penalty independently, or\nthat it ―engaged in improper comparative evaluations‖ of defendant and Patterson.\n(People v. Taylor (2001) 26 Cal.4th 1155, 1174.) The jury was told to decide the\nquestion of penalty separately as to each defendant, and we must presume it\nfollowed this instruction. (Letner and Tobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 152.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         56\n\fB.     Guilt Phase Issues\n       1.     Admission of Victim Photographs\n       Defendant sought to exclude several photographs taken at the crime scene\nand just before Beeson‘s autopsy. He argued the crime scene photos were\ngruesome, because they showed a large amount of blood, and misleading, because\nthe scene had been altered. Paramedics had removed some of Beeson‘s clothing\nwhile attempting to revive her. Defendant worried her seminude body would\nsuggest a sexual component to the murder. He also objected that photographs of\nBeeson‘s nude body on the autopsy table were unnecessarily graphic and largely\ncumulative of the pathologist‘s testimony. The prosecutor argued the autopsy\nphotographs were relevant to show Beeson had sustained bruising and other\ninjuries all over her body, not just to her head and neck. Photos of her blood-\nsoaked clothing and of blood at the crime scene illustrated the brutality of the\nmurder and contradicted defendant‘s self-serving statement that he had merely\ntried to put Beeson to sleep. Although the paramedics‘ intervention had changed\nsome aspects of the crime scene, the prosecutor maintained these photos were still\nrelevant to corroborate testimony about the placement of Beeson‘s body and other\nitems in the room.\n       The court weighed the probative value and risk of undue prejudice for each\nitem offered, ultimately excluding four photographs. Defendant now claims those\nadmitted were unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352 and their\nadmission violated his federal constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\n       The admission of victim photographs lies within the broad discretion of the\ntrial court. Its decision will not be disturbed unless the photographs‘ probative\nvalue is clearly outweighed by their prejudicial effect. (People v. Heard, supra,\n31 Cal.4th at p. 975; People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 133-134.) The\ncourt carefully balanced probative value and potential prejudice for each\nphotograph and admitted only those it found appropriate. This decision was well\nwithin the court‘s discretion. Proper admission vitiates defendant‘s constitutional\n\n\n                                          57\n\fclaim. (See People v. Thomas, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 935; People v. Riggs (2008)\n44 Cal.4th 248, 304.)\n       Defendant‘s claim of prejudice rests largely on the fact that several photos\ndepict Beeson‘s nude body. Crime scene photos with Beeson‘s shirt removed are\nmisleading, he argues, and ―subliminally‖ suggest a sexual aspect to the murder.\nDefendant contends this risk of undue prejudice was exacerbated by racial\nundertones: ―A photograph of a naked, young white woman is the kind that tends\nto evoke an emotional bias against a defendant, particularly a young black man.‖\nThe trial court properly determined any risk of prejudice was outweighed by the\nphotographs‘ probative value.\n       The crime scene photos were the only ones depicting the location of\nBeeson‘s body in the room and her blood-soaked clothing. They corroborated the\ntestimony of Botello and police witnesses and would help the jury understand and\nevaluate testimony about how Beeson was found. (See People v. Pollock (2004)\n32 Cal.4th 1153, 1171.) Although unpleasant, they are not particularly gruesome\nor sexually graphic. Four of the photos show Beeson‘s body on its side, facing\naway from the camera. She is wearing only underwear and lying on a blood-\nsoaked shirt with defibrillator pads attached to her chest. Two photos focus on the\nwounds to the back of her head and neck. These photographs were not so\ngruesome as to impermissibly sway the jury, which would hear testimony detailing\nall facts relating to the crime scene and victim. (See People v. Scheid (1997) 16\nCal.4th 1, 20.) Nor could nudity in the photos have misled the jury into thinking\nthere was a sexual component to the murder. As the trial court observed,\nwitnesses explained how medical interventions altered the original crime scene.\nBotello and the first police officer at the scene testified that Beeson was clothed\nwhen they found her. Witnesses repeatedly explained that her clothing had been\nremoved by paramedics. Forensics experts confirmed there was no evidence of\nany sexual activity. Finally, the prosecutor assured the jury in opening statement\n\n\n\n                                         58\n\fthat ―[t]here was no rape here,‖ and defendant points to no questioning or\nargument raising that insinuation.\n       Nor were the autopsy photos impermissibly cumulative because there was\nno dispute about the cause of death. We have rejected this argument on many\noccasions. (See People v. Riggs, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 304; People v. Scheid,\nsupra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 19; People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 134-135.)\nThe photographs were properly admitted to illustrate the testimony of the\npathologist and to corroborate other evidence, including statements in both\ndefendants‘ confessions. (See People v. Thomas, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 935;\nRiggs, at p. 304.)\n       2.     Presence of Courtroom Deputy During Defendant’s Testimony\n\n       Defendant contends his federal due process rights were violated when the\ncourt stationed a deputy near the witness stand during his testimony. Any error\nwas harmless.\n       When defendant testified at a pretrial hearing, a bailiff sat near the witness\nstand. Defendant‘s attorney observed that, while this arrangement was fine for the\npretrial hearing, he would strongly object if a bailiff accompanied defendant to the\nstand during trial. Treating defendant differently from other witnesses in this way\nwould communicate to the jury that defendant was especially dangerous. The\ncourt responded that its practice, like that of other judges in the county, was that\n―defendants with the charges we have before us‖ were accompanied to the witness\nstand by a bailiff. The court disagreed that the bailiff‘s presence communicated\nanything to the jury and noted that the bailiff was positioned about the same\ndistance from defendant at the witness stand as he was when defendant was seated\nat counsel table. At a break, the court took measurements and moved the bailiff‘s\nchair farther from the witness stand to ensure that these distances would be\nidentical. Having done so, the court ruled that it would ―continue the practice of\nhaving any in-custody witness accompanied by a bailiff.‖ He emphasized that this\n\n\n                                          59\n\frule would apply to any witness in custody, whether called by the prosecution or\ndefense and regardless of the charge for which the witness was incarcerated. Both\ndefendant and Patterson testified during the guilt phase and were the only in-\ncustody witnesses to do so.\n       Decisions about courtroom security measures are typically reviewed for\nabuse of discretion unless they ―carry an inordinate risk of infringing upon a\ncriminal defendant‘s right to a fair trial.‖ (People v. Stevens (2009) 47 Cal.4th\n625, 632.) In Stevens, we held that stationing a deputy at the witness stand near a\ntestifying defendant is not an ―inherently prejudicial‖ practice that can only be\njustified by a showing of manifest need. (Id. at p. 638; see also Holbrook v. Flynn\n(1986) 475 U.S. 560, 567-569.) However, we also observed that ―the trial court\nmust exercise its own discretion in ordering such a procedure and may not simply\ndefer to a generic policy.‖ (Stevens, at p. 644.) We urged trial courts to give\nreasons on the record and explain why the need for this security measure\noutweighed potential prejudice to the defendant. (Id. at p. 642.) ―Although not a\nmodel of clarity,‖ the trial court‘s discussion there of safety concerns, the need to\nprevent distractions or escape, and juror notes expressing concern about the\ndefendant‘s agitated demeanor, all indicated the court had exercised its own\njudgment based on case-specific considerations. (Id. at p. 643.)\n       The record was quite different in People v. Hernandez (2011) 51 Cal.4th\n733. There, the trial ―court asserted that it had seen a deputy at the witness stand\n‗in every trial I‘ve ever done . . . because of security,‘ and noted that a bailiff was\n‗supposed‘ to sit behind ‗all defendants‘ who testify, ‗even in a petty theft‘ case.\nDespite a direct request from defense counsel, the court refused to make an\nindividualized finding that defendant‘s behavior warranted this heightened\nsecurity measure. Instead, the court responded that this defendant ‗deserve [d]‘ to\nhave a deputy stationed at the witness stand for the same basic security reasons\n‗every defendant deserve[d]‘ to have this procedure employed.‖ (Id. at p. 743.)\nOn the whole, these remarks revealed that the court ruled pursuant to a standard\n\n\n                                           60\n\fpolicy and not based on specific facts about the defendant or the particular case.\n(Ibid.) The court briefly mentioned some specific factors, such as the defendant‘s\nextensive criminal record and the violent nature of his offense. However, its\nremarks were, at most, post hoc justifications for adhering to a generic policy.\n(Ibid.) This reliance on a standard policy was an abuse of discretion but reversal\nwas not required because the error was harmless under People v. Watson (1956)\n46 Cal.2d 818. (Hernandez, at pp. 744, 746.)\n       Here, the court devoted considerable time and attention to the issue. It\ndiscussed California cases addressing the use of physical restraints and other\ncourtroom security measures and concluded the posting of deputies in the\ncourtroom was within the court‘s broad discretion. It also obtained measurements\nand repositioned seating to ensure that the bailiff would not obstruct jurors‘ views\nof defendant and would sit the same distance away from him as when defendant\nwas at counsel table. While the court‘s legal research and its careful measures to\navoid prejudice are commendable, its analysis did not focus on case-specific\nreasons justifying the security measure.21 On the contrary, the court emphasized\nthat its order for posting a bailiff at the witness stand applied to any in-custody\nwitness called by either side. Although many facts could have justified the order,\ngiven the nature of the present crimes and defendant‘s long record of violence\nwhile in custody (see post, at pp. 74-77), we do not examine the record for such\ncase-specific reasons when it is clear that the court‘s order was based on a\nstanding practice. (See People v. Hernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 744.)\n       However, the error was clearly harmless. Two or three bailiffs were\nstationed in the courtroom throughout the trial, and only one sat near defendant at\nthe witness stand. As the trial court took pains to ensure, the deputy sat three feet\naway from defendant, maintaining precisely the same distance from the witness\n\n\n21    We note that the trial occurred in 2003, well before our decisions in Stevens\nand Hernandez.\n\n\n                                          61\n\fchair as from defendant‘s usual position at counsel table. Nothing in the record\nsuggests the bailiff treated defendant with anything other than courtesy and\nrespect. (See People v. Hernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 746.) Moreover, the\nevidence against defendant was strong, much of it coming from his own detailed\nstatements to the police and his mother. Given the compelling evidence of guilt, it\nis not reasonably probable defendant would have obtained a more favorable result\nabsent the error. (See id. at pp. 745-746, 748; People v. Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d\nat p. 837.) Nor is there a reasonable possibility that this security measure affected\nthe penalty phase verdict.22\nC.       Penalty Phase Issues\n         1.    Victim Impact Evidence\n         Defendant raises several challenges to victim impact evidence. None has\nmerit.\n               a.     Background\n         The prosecution and defense filed motions in connection with victim\nimpact evidence. After a lengthy hearing, the court rejected defendant‘s argument\nthat victim impact testimony be restricted to family members who were personally\npresent at the murder or would foreseeably be affected by the crime. However, the\ncourt precluded testimony from two of Beeson‘s friends under Evidence Code\nsection 352, finding it would likely be duplicative of other evidence.\n         The prosecution offered testimony from Beeson‘s mother and sister.\nMelitta Beeson described her daughter as loyal, fearless, and artistic, with an\ninfectious sense of humor. Beeson struggled with a learning disability and\n\n\n22     Defendant argues prejudice under Chapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S.\n18, 23. However, the failure to state reasons for stationing a deputy at the witness\nstand is not a federal constitutional error, and People v. Watson furnishes the\nappropriate test for judging harmlessness. (See People v. Hernandez, supra, 51\nCal.4th at pp. 745-746.) In regard to the penalty phase, the error was also\nharmless under the ―reasonable possibility‖ test. (See People v. Brown (1988) 46\nCal.3d 432, 447-448.)\n\n\n                                         62\n\fattended many schools. She was a rebellious teenager who often drank and stayed\nout late; however, she had matured in the year before her death and was starting to\nplan for the future. Beeson was very close to her father. Fred Beeson received the\ncall that she was dead, and he had to identify the body. He was ―totally\ndevastated‖ by the murder and died six months later.\n       Lisa Beeson was close to her younger sister. She had just finished her\npenultimate semester of law school at Tulane and was out of the country when she\nlearned Beeson had been killed. She came home to parents who were profoundly\naffected. Her father was depressed but also obsessed with trying to discover what\nhad happened. Lisa withdrew from law school and moved home. She arranged a\nmemorial service for her sister that many people attended. She also arranged a\ncremation and went with her father to bury the remains. As they drove to the\nmortuary, Lisa saw her father in the backseat stroking the top of the box\ncontaining Beeson‘s ashes. Her father and sister were now buried next to each\nother. Lisa described making identical bouquets, tied together with a ribbon, and\nplacing them on the graves each time she visited. The family no longer celebrated\nholidays or birthdays. Lisa remained angry and hurt over her sister‘s murder.\n       After reviewing numerous photographs and documents offered by the\nprosecution, the court excluded roughly half under Evidence Code section 352. It\nadmitted a notebook containing 53 photographs taken throughout Beeson‘s life, a\nreport card, a group of letters, and a Christmas list Beeson gave her mother shortly\nbefore the murder. During closing argument, the court allowed the prosecutor to\nplay an 18-minute video montage displaying photographs of Beeson from the\nnotebook, crime scene, and autopsy, and the audio confessions of defendant and\nPatterson. The soundtrack consisted of taped excerpts from Iva Mosely‘s police\ninterview along with both defendants‘ confessions.\n\n\n\n\n                                        63\n\f              b.      Analysis\n                      i.     Attendance of Family Members at Trial\n       Before addressing the substance of this evidence, defendant claims the\ncourt erred in permitting Beeson‘s sister and mother to both attend the guilt phase\nand testify as victim impact witnesses. Defense counsel observed these family\nmembers silently crying at points during the trial and argued they should be\nexcluded from the courtroom. The court denied the request, noting that it had paid\nclose attention to the audience and had observed nothing remotely prejudicial.\nThere had been no outbursts or vocal demonstrations, nor any other violations of\ncourtroom decorum.\n       This ruling was an appropriate exercise of the court‘s discretion.\nImmediate family members of a murder victim have the right to attend trial subject\nto ―overriding interests,‖ such as the defendant‘s right to a fair trial. (§ 1102.6,\nsubds. (b)(1), (c).) A spectator‘s behavior is grounds for reversal only if it is ― ‗of\nsuch a character as to prejudice the defendant or influence the verdict,‘ ‖ and the\ntrial court has broad discretion in determining whether spectator conduct is\nprejudicial. (People v. Myles (2012) 53 Cal.4th 1181, 1215; People v. Lucero\n(1988) 44 Cal.3d 1006, 1022.) We found no error in Myles when a murder\nvictim‘s wife nodded in agreement with prosecution witnesses, cried openly in\ncourt, and was consoled by support persons. (Myles, at pp. 1215-1216.) The\nmodest displays of emotion here were even less likely to prejudice defendant‘s\nright to a fair trial. The trial court closely observed the proceedings and was in the\nbest position to evaluate the impact of family members‘ conduct on the jury. (See\nibid.) We defer to its informed conclusion that silent tears from Beeson‘s mother\nand sister were not prejudicial.\n       Nor is there merit to defendant‘s unsupported claim that family members\nwho observe the guilt phase of trial may not testify as victim impact witnesses.\nHis proposal would severely curtail family members‘ statutory right to attend trial\nand the scope of permissible victim impact evidence. Preserving a fair trial for the\n\n\n                                          64\n\fdefendant does not require such an extreme limitation on the court‘s discretion and\nthe universe of victim impact evidence.\n                     ii.    Volume and Content of Victim Impact Evidence\n       Next, defendant raises several challenges to the victim impact evidence\nadmitted. He argues the evidence was excessive and the content was so\nemotionally charged as to be a memorial service for the victim. He specifically\nobjects to testimony about Beeson‘s funeral and family visits to her grave.\nFinally, he complains the victim impact evidence supported ―an invidious\ncomparison between the societal worth‖ of the deceased and defendant.\n       ―Unless it invites a purely irrational response, evidence of the effect of a\ncapital murder on the loved ones of the victim is relevant and admissible under\nsection 190.3, factor (a), as a circumstance of the crime. [Citation.]‖ (People v.\nBooker, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 190.) Moreover, the federal Constitution prohibits\nvictim impact evidence only if it is ―so unduly prejudicial‖ as to render the trial\n―fundamentally unfair.‖ (Payne v. Tennessee (1991) 501 U.S. 808, 825; see\nPeople v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 466-467.)\n       This victim impact evidence was well within these guidelines and typical in\nboth volume and content to evidence we have routinely deemed acceptable. (See,\ne.g., People v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 467; People v. Kelly (2007) 42\nCal.4th 763, 793.) Testimony from two family members is not excessive. (People\nv. Booker, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 194.) In Pearson, we upheld the admission of\nvictim impact testimony from three family members and six close friends.\n(Pearson, at pp. 464-467.) In People v. Brady (2010) 50 Cal.4th 547, 573, 576-\n577, we concluded testimony from a slain police officer‘s four sisters, fiancée, two\nfellow officers, police chief, and treating physician was not unfairly excessive.\n       Defendant argues that, to be consistent with Payne v. Tennessee, victim\nimpact evidence must be limited to testimony from a single witness describing the\nmurder‘s effect on a family member who was present at or immediately after the\ncrime, and these effects must have been known or reasonably apparent to the\n\n\n                                          65\n\fdefendant. He also contends events occurring years before or after the crime are\nnot admissible in aggravation under section 190.3, factor (a). We have routinely\nrejected these claims (see, e.g., People v. Tully, supra, 54 Cal.4th at pp. 1031-\n1032; People v. Zamudio (2008) 43 Cal.4th 327, 364) and do so again. The\nPeople are entitled to present a complete history of the murder victim‘s life and\nmay also present testimony from loved ones who, sometimes vividly, describe the\nimpact of their loss. (People v. Garcia (2011) 52 Cal.4th 706, 751.)\n       Nor was the testimony here so emotional as to invite an irrational response.\nThe witnesses appropriately described the person Beeson was and the traumatic\nimpact of her death on the family. We have consistently observed that the\nemotional trauma suffered by close friends and relatives is a permissible subject of\nvictim impact testimony. (E.g., People v. Zamudio, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 368;\nPeople v. Boyette, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 445.) Both witnesses testified to the\ndevastating effect of the murder on Beeson‘s father, but neither speculated that the\nmurder in some way caused his death. (See People v. Booker, supra, 51 Cal.4th at\np. 193.) Lisa Beeson‘s testimony about her father stroking the box of her sister‘s\nashes, and about her own visits to the gravesites, was poignant but not so\nemotional as to provoke an irrational juror response. ―Emotional testimony is not\nnecessarily inflammatory.‖ (People v. Brady, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 575; see\nBooker, at p. 193.) Moreover, we have repeatedly held that evidence related to a\nmurder victim‘s funeral is relevant and admissible. (See People v. Garcia, supra,\n52 Cal.4th at p. 752; Booker, at pp. 192-193.)\n       Finally, defendant complains the victim impact evidence created a risk that\nthe jury‘s penalty decision would be swayed by improper comparisons between\nhis character and Beeson‘s. He asserts this risk is particularly acute in cross-racial\ncrimes, where jurors are likely to empathize with a White victim. We rejected\nsimilar arguments in People v. Kelly, supra, 42 Cal.4th at page 799. Here, too, the\nclaims lack merit. Nothing in the victim impact evidence or argument, or\nelsewhere in the record, even remotely encouraged the jury to consider race in\n\n\n                                          66\n\freaching a penalty verdict. (See ibid.) Defendant complains the prosecutor‘s\nclosing argument expressly contrasted the backgrounds of Beeson and defendant.\nIn fact, the prosecutor only fleetingly mentioned that defendant and Beeson were\nabout the same age in the context of discussing defendant‘s criminal\nsophistication. He remarked on the absence of defendant‘s family at the trial but\ndid not invite the jury to compare this lack of involvement with Beeson‘s family.\nIn fact, it was defense counsel who argued, ―we have a clear contrast here‖\nbetween ―the loving support that Erika Beeson‘s family gave Erika‖ and\ndefendant‘s family, who not only failed to come to court but failed to support him\nwhen he struggled with ADHD as a child.\n                     iii.   Videotape Montage in Closing Argument\n       During closing argument, the prosecutor played an 18-minute videotape\ndepicting several photographs of Beeson throughout her life and, briefly, in death.\nThe audio track consisted of recorded excerpts from Iva Mosley‘s interview and\nthe defendants‘ police statements. All of the visual and auditory material in the\nvideotape had previously been admitted in evidence. There was no accompanying\nmusic. After watching the videotape and hearing arguments from counsel, the\ncourt ruled that it could be played as a demonstrative aid during closing argument\nbut would not be admitted into evidence.\n       We have addressed the admissibility of victim impact videotapes\nfrequently, cautioning that courts should not permit evidentiary presentations with\noverly dramatic or emotional elements, stirring music, or irrelevant images. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Prince (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1179, 1289; see also People v. Sandoval\n(2015) 62 Cal.4th 394, 440-442; People v. Kelly, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 798.)\nHowever, unlike many other videotapes we have considered, here every image and\nsound presented in the videotape had already been admitted in evidence. The\nprosecutor did not seek to introduce new evidence through the videotape. Instead,\nhe used the content of admitted items of evidence to make his points as a matter of\nargument. As in People v. Bramit (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1221, 1241, ―the videotape\n\n\n                                         67\n\fwas simply ‗a repackaging of the evidence‘ ‖ and was a permissible exercise of\nadvocacy.\n       Defendant complains that the juxtaposition of victim images with excerpts\nfrom the confessions was misleading or inflammatory. The trial court rejected\nthese assertions. We have viewed the videotape and agree that the presentation\nwas not prejudicial. In People v. Wash (1993) 6 Cal.4th 215, 256, the prosecutor\ndisplayed slides of the crime scene and victims during opening statement while\nsimultaneously playing audio portions of the defendant‘s confession. Over\ndefendant‘s objection that the presentation was inflammatory, we concluded the\nprosecutor had committed no misconduct because the slides and recordings were\nlater admitted in evidence and their use as demonstrative aids during argument\nwas appropriate. (Id. at pp. 256-257.) The same is true here. The jury had\npreviously received all of the videotape‘s images and sounds during trial. While\nthe juxtaposition of confessions with images of the murdered victim may have\nbeen evocative, the videotape contained no ― ‗irrelevant or inflammatory\nmaterial‘ ‖ that could have ― ‗divert[ed] the jury‘s attention from its proper role or\ninvite[d] an irrational, purely subjective response.‘ ‖ (People v. Prince, supra, 40\nCal.4th at pp. 1289-1290.) Moreover, because defense counsel were the last to\npresent arguments, they were free to comment on the prosecutor‘s presentation or\noffer rebuttal.\n       2.         Issues Related to Factor (b) Evidence\n       Section 190.3, factor (b) permits the jury to consider a defendant‘s criminal\nactivity involving the use, threat, or attempt to use force or violence in deciding\nwhether to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole.\nDefendant raises several challenges to the factor (b) evidence admitted in his\npenalty trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                           68\n\f                 a.   Harassment of Julia P.\n                      i.     Sufficiency of Evidence\n       Before trial, the prosecutor moved to admit evidence that defendant had\nsexually assaulted Julia P. In a tape-recorded statement, Julia alleged that\ndefendant had exposed himself to her and requested oral sex, then displayed a gun\nand attempted to rape her. The defense challenged the truth of these claims,\nnoting Julia did not file a police report and had not mentioned the incident in\nmultiple conversations with the police about defendant. The court ruled the\nevidence admissible, noting the delayed report went to the weight of the evidence\nand could be explored on cross-examination. In addition, while the alleged\nconduct was violent and threatening, the court ruled it was not so inflammatory as\nto require an additional hearing.\n       At the penalty phase, Julia described three incidents. Once, when she was\nsitting under a hair dryer, defendant approached with his pants down. He\nforcefully touched her breasts and neck, exposed his penis, and asked for oral sex.\nAnother time, she was lying on a couch watching television with friends.\nDefendant suddenly pushed her down, straddled her, pinned her wrists, and tried\nto pull her pants down. When she resisted, defendant ordered his younger brother\nto remove her pants. The brother refused, telling defendant to leave her alone. On\na third occasion, Julia went into her friend‘s bathroom to escape defendant when\nhe was pestering her to have sex. Defendant followed her in, shut the door behind\nhim, and turned off the light. He pulled a gun and held the barrel near his chin.\nEventually the friend‘s mother came to the door, and defendant let her leave.\nSometime later, to end the harassment, Julia did allow defendant to engage in\nintercourse.23\n\n\n\n23       Julia also described two factor (b) incidents related to Patterson. In the\nfirst, she saw Patterson repeatedly slap and kick his girlfriend on a street corner.\nIn the second, she was lying on a couch and Patterson touched her sexually.\n\n\n                                          69\n\f       Defendant now claims this evidence was insufficient to demonstrate he\nused or threatened to use force or violence. To the contrary, Julia P.‘s testimony\nclearly establishes that defendant used force when he groped her under the hair\ndryer and pinned her to the couch by her wrists. In the third incident, defendant\nprevented her from leaving the bathroom and brandished a firearm. These acts\nviolated several penal statutes. They were sufficient to be admissible as\naggravating evidence. (§ 190.3, factor (b).)\n                     ii.    Impeachment with False Claims of Rape\n       Defendant also complains the court erred in precluding him from cross-\nexamining Julia about two false claims of rape. Counsel asked whether Julia had\ntold her friend Nicole that she had sex with Nicole‘s boyfriend, ―Pie,‖ because he\nforced himself on her. Julia answered, ―no,‖ and the prosecutor objected when\ncounsel tried to inquire further. The court sustained the objection under Evidence\nCode section 352, finding any probative value of this evidence would be\nsubstantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, undue consumption of time, and\nconfusion of the issues. Defense counsel asserted the evidence was relevant as a\nfalse accusation of rape, but when pressed for a more specific offer of proof he\nconceded he had not been able to locate Nicole or her boyfriend. The court ruled\nthat no further questioning on the subject would be permitted until defendant was\nprepared to produce either of these witnesses.\n       During the chambers conference, defense counsel mentioned he also\nwanted to introduce evidence that Julia told ―various people‖ she had had sex with\nher friend‘s grandfather, Zeke. Counsel wanted to ask her about these statements\nand ―hopefully the witness will testify truthfully that she lied.‖ The prosecutor\nobjected that this offer of proof did not even involve a false claim of rape, but only\nsexual activity. Remarking that the offer of proof was ―very vague‖ and the\nquestioning sought appeared to be ―a fishing expedition,‖ the court ruled that this\nline of questioning would be prohibited unless the defense satisfied Evidence\n\n\n\n                                         70\n\fCode section 782.24 In response, the defense requested a continuance, which was\ndenied. The court observed that the defense had prior notice of these issues and\ncould recall Julia once it had made the proper showing.\n       Evidence may be excluded under Evidence Code section 352 ―if its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission\nwill (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of\nundue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.‖ An exercise\nof discretion under Evidence Code section 352 will be affirmed unless it was\narbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd and the ruling resulted in a miscarriage of\njustice. (People v. Rodriguez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 1, 9-10.) The trial court\nreasonably exercised its discretion in prohibiting further cross-examination on the\nwitness‘s sexual activity.\n       A prior accusation of rape is relevant to the complaining witness‘s\ncredibility, but only if the accusation is shown to be false. (People v. Tidwell\n(2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 1447, 1457.) In People v. Bittaker (1989) 48 Cal.3d 1046,\n1097, after a witness testified the defendant threatened her with a gun when she\nrefused his advances, the defendant sought to impeach with evidence that the\nwitness had falsely accused two other men of sexual molestation. The trial court\nsustained an Evidence Code section 352 objection, and we affirmed. We\nexplained: ―The value of the evidence as impeachment depends upon proof that\nthe prior charges were false. This would in effect force the parties to present\nevidence concerning two long-past sexual incidents which never reached the point\nof formal charges. Such a proceeding would consume considerable time, and\ndivert the attention of the jury from the case at hand.‖ (Bittaker, at p. 1097.)\n       The same is true here. Julia denied accusing Pie of rape. For this line of\nquestioning to have any relevance, then, the defense would have had to establish\n\n24     This provision requires a written motion and sworn offer of proof, and a\nhearing, before a complaining witness‘s sexual activity may be used to attack\ncredibility. (Evid. Code, § 782.)\n\n\n                                          71\n\fboth that the accusation was made and that it was false. (See People v. Tidwell,\nsupra, 163 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1457-1458.) The trial court reasonably concluded\nthis inquiry would consume undue amounts of time. Further, it appears that\ncounsel could not establish adequate foundation in light of his admission that he\nhad not located Pie or the person to whom Julia allegedly complained.\nDefendant‘s second proffered impeachment was even further afield. As the\nprosecutor observed, this alleged statement was not a claim of rape, but merely\nthat the witness had sex with someone. It could conceivably have been relevant if\nthe statement was false, but counsel merely ―hope[d]‖ this was the case and did\nnot have ready proof. The court acted well within its discretion in preventing this\nfishing expedition from diverting undue time and attention from the trial.\n       Nor did the court abuse its discretion in denying a continuance. A midtrial\ncontinuance may be granted only for good cause. ―A showing of good cause\nrequires a demonstration that counsel and the defendant have prepared for trial\nwith due diligence. [Citations.]‖ (People v. Jenkins (2000) 22 Cal.4th 900, 1037;\nsee § 1050, subd. (e).) The record demonstrates that defense counsel had been\naware of Julia‘s allegations for at least six months. Yet they gathered no further\nevidence to support their argument that she had made false accusations against\nother men. Given counsel‘s unsuccessful attempt to locate the key witnesses, the\ntrial court acted well within its discretion in concluding an additional continuance\nwith no proffered basis to expect success was unjustified. We note that the court\nleft open an opportunity for the matter to be revisited later if counsel made an\nappropriate showing. No such showing was attempted.\n                     iii.   Hearsay Statements\n       On cross-examination, the defense stressed Julia‘s failure to tell the police\nabout defendant‘s harassing conduct until shortly before trial and her spotty\nmemory as to what she told the police at various times. In an attempt to\nrehabilitate her, the prosecutor asked about a tape-recorded statement she made\nwhile in the hospital after Patterson‘s attack. When asked if she remembered\n\n\n                                         72\n\ftelling officers how she learned defendant had murdered Beeson, Julia said she\noverheard someone named Charles say to her friend Lakeisha, ― ‗your cousin‘s\ncrazy for killing that white girl.‘ ‖ The court allowed the statement but instructed\nthe jury it could not be considered for the truth of the matter asserted but only for\nits bearing on the witness‘s ability to recall the day in question. Defendant raised\nanother hearsay objection when Julia testified that Lakeisha told her defendant and\nPatterson had killed Beeson because ― ‗they were trying to rob her, and she\nwouldn‘t cooperate so they killed her.‘ ‖ The court overruled this objection as\nwell and again told the jury the statement could not be considered for its truth.\n       Defendant now complains the court violated his due process right to a fair\npenalty hearing by admitting ―highly inflammatory evidence.‖ He complains the\nprobative value of the evidence was slight because there was no serious dispute\nabout Julia‘s ability to recall the day in question, or the reasons why she failed to\ntell the police about defendant‘s assaultive conduct. The record belies this\nassertion. Defense cross-examination repeatedly challenged Julia‘s memory of\ndetails. Moreover, the statements were only prejudicial insofar as they implicated\ndefendant in Beeson‘s murder. But they were admitted at the penalty phase of\ntrial, after the jury had already convicted him. Accordingly, the statements\nconcerned a crime that was no longer in dispute. Because defendant‘s authorities\nall concern the admission of hearsay statements at the guilt phase, they are\ninapposite to the question of prejudice here. Finally, to the extent defendant‘s\nreply brief suggests the statements violated Crawford v. Washington (2004) 541\nU.S. 36, the claim fails. (See id. at p. 59.) The trial court carefully reminded\njurors that the statements could not be considered for their truth. As nonhearsay,\nthe statements fall outside the Crawford rule.\n              b.     Violent Acts Committed as a Juvenile\n       Over defendant‘s objection that they were too remote, the court admitted as\nfactor (b) evidence testimony regarding several acts he committed as a juvenile.\n(See People v. Anderson (2001) 25 Cal.4th 543, 586.) Defendant now challenges\n\n\n                                          73\n\fboth the direct admission of these juvenile offenses and his expert‘s testimony on\ncross-examination about additional incidents. The evidence was properly\nadmitted.\n                      i.     Background\n         When defendant was 12 years old, he and a companion approached a\nwoman who had arrived home late at night and was sitting in her parked van.\nDefendant ordered her to open the door and give them her money. When she did\nnot comply, he struck the van‘s windows with a pole, cracking the glass.\nDefendant‘s companion pointed a gun at her and threatened to shoot her. The\nvictim started the ignition and drove off, swerving as she heard gunshots.\n         Berkeley police officers detained defendant at age 13 after he appeared to\nthrow something into bushes. During a pat search, they found a lump of rock\ncocaine. Defendant struggled and tried to run but was eventually handcuffed.\n         When he was 14, defendant led police on a high-speed car chase through\ncity streets for over 30 minutes. He eventually hit a patrol car and submitted to\narrest. When read his Miranda warnings, defendant said, ―I shouldn‘t have run. I\nshould have got out of my car and started shooting at you.‖ He then criticized the\nofficer‘s gun and bragged that he had been shooting a .357 Magnum revolver\nearlier that night. Defendant said he threw away the gun and some drugs during\nthe chase. A .357 Magnum revolver was found later that night in an area of the\nchase.\n         At age 16, defendant was written up three times for being threatening and\ndisrespectful to Juanita Ream, a teaching assistant at CYA. He called her a\n―coward‖ and a ―bald-hair bitch‖ and had to be removed from the classroom by\nsecurity. He was verbally abusive with the CYA officer and youth counselor who\ntried to talk with him, refused to cooperate in a search, and had to be physically\nrestrained.\n         When defendant was 17, a CYA officer overheard him tell his roommate:\n― ‗You are going to be my pussy. You are going to give it to me. I‘ll make you\n\n\n                                          74\n\fsubmit.‘ ‖ The roommate was lying on the bottom bunk and defendant was\nleaning over him. Defendant held a weapon fashioned from a toothbrush pointed\nat his roommate‘s throat. When defendant was removed from the room, he\nbecame physically combative and threatened to harm the officer. Later that year,\ndefendant assaulted a smaller boy as they left the CYA showers. He chased the\nboy down the hall until two officers subdued him with Mace.\n       The prosecutor mentioned several additional incidents in cross-examining\ndefendant‘s expert, Dr. Jamie Candelaria-Greene, about material she read in\ndefendant‘s juvenile records and discipline reports. For example, defendant‘s\nmother reported that he played with matches and at age eight had attempted to set\nfire to a neighbor‘s home. From age 10 to 13 defendant lived in a group home,\nwhere he had three fist fights with peers and threatened staff on three occasions.\nDr. Candelaria-Greene denied seeing reports about armed robberies or auto thefts\nduring this period but did see a juvenile hall report that he had threatened a judge.\nShe also saw reports of defendant‘s violence against his mother and sister. The\ncourt instructed the jury that information referred to in these juvenile reports was\nnot admitted for truth but only to show the basis of the expert‘s opinions.\n                     ii.     Analysis\n       Juvenile criminal activity involving force or threatened violence is\nadmissible in aggravation under factor (b). (See, e.g., People v. Bivert (2011) 52\nCal.4th 96, 122; People v. Taylor, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 653; People v. Lewis\n(2001) 26 Cal.4th 334, 378.) ―We also have repeatedly held that the admission of\nsuch evidence passes constitutional muster. [Citations.]‖ (People v. Lee (2011)\n51 Cal.4th 620, 649.) These conclusions were not altered by the high court‘s\ndecision in Roper v. Simmons (2005) 543 U.S. 551 barring execution of those who\ncommitted capital crimes when under age 18. Roper concerned the Eighth\nAmendment standard for imposing punishment, not the admissibility of evidence.\n―It says nothing about the propriety of permitting a capital jury, trying an adult, to\n\n\n\n                                          75\n\fconsider evidence of violent offenses committed when the defendant was a\njuvenile.‖ (People v. Bramit, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 1239.)\n       Defendant urges us to reconsider our holdings based on the Supreme\nCourt‘s extension of Roper v. Simmons in Miller v. Alabama (2012) 567 U.S. __\n[132 S.Ct. 2455] to sentences of life imprisonment without parole. Yet there too\nthe focus was on Eighth Amendment standards for punishing juvenile misconduct.\nHere, the question is what evidence may be considered when determining\npunishment for an adult‘s crime. The high court has never suggested that, in\ndeciding that question, the jury may not consider qualifying criminal conduct the\ndefendant committed as a juvenile. Even if defendant is correct that Roper and\nMiller treat juvenile misconduct as less blameworthy than adult misconduct,\nevidence of forceful or violent conduct is nevertheless relevant to penalty phase\nquestions about character and future dangerousness. (See People v. Bivert, supra,\n52 Cal.4th at p. 123.) Arguments about the offender‘s youth and immaturity go to\nthe weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. 25\n       Defendant also complains that the admission of his juvenile misconduct is\ninconsistent with section 26, which presumes that children under age 14 are\nincapable of committing a crime. However, the presumption of incapacity can be\nrebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the minor knew the wrongfulness\nof his act. (People v. Lewis, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 378.) Because defendant did\nnot raise this objection below, the prosecutor did not present evidence and the trial\ncourt did not make findings on in this regard. To the extent defendant now argues\nthere was insufficient foundation of his capacity, the claim has not been preserved\nfor review. (See People v. Partida (2005) 37 Cal.4th 428, 434-435.)\n\n25      The same is true for defendant‘s assertion that it is ―unseemly‖ to base a\ndeath sentence on juvenile misconduct he committed while under the state‘s\nsupervision. Defendant spent much of his youth in group homes and CYA\nbecause he was a violent, repeat offender. He was free to present evidence\ncriticizing the services he received, but defendant‘s residence in state custody does\nnot make his violent and threatening conduct as a juvenile any less admissible.\n\n\n                                          76\n\f              c.     Nonviolent Incidents\n       Factor (b) evidence ―must violate a penal statute and must be directed\nagainst a person or persons, not against property.‖ (People v. Kirkpatrick (1994) 7\nCal.4th 988, 1013; see People v. Boyd (1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 778 (Boyd).) The\ntrial court conducted a lengthy pretrial hearing to determine if there was\nsubstantial evidence to prove the required elements of each factor (b) crime the\nprosecution sought to introduce. (See People v. Phillips (1985) 41 Cal.3d 29, 72\nfn. 25.) The court admitted some incidents and excluded others. Defendant now\nclaims some incidents the court allowed were not sufficiently violent or\nthreatening to be admissible. The decision to admit factor (b) evidence is within\nthe trial court‘s discretion, and no abuse of discretion will be found if substantial\nevidence was presented establishing the crimes. (Ibid.; see People v. Tuilaepa\n(1992) 4 Cal.4th 569, 587.)\n                     i.       Insults of CYA Teaching Assistant\n       First, defendant argues that the incident in which he called the CYA\nteaching assistant a ―coward‖ and ―bald-hair bitch‖ (see ante, at pp. 74-75) did not\nviolate a criminal statute or constitute an imminent threat. The evidence belies his\nclaim. Ream testified that defendant was walking around the classroom, calling\nher a bitch, and saying he did not have to listen to her. He seemed to be inciting\nthe other students against her. She felt threatened and called security to have him\nremoved. Defendant was verbally abusive to the officer who removed him and the\ncounselor who tried to talk to him. He repeatedly called them cowards and\nchallenged each to ―settle things one-on-one.‖ He became physically agitated and\nhad to be placed in a restraint hold. Ream reported the incident on a disciplinary\nform. When defendant returned to her class afterward, he walked straight to Ream\nand said, ―see, your write-up means nothing. I can do whatever.‖ Ream testified\nshe felt threatened during the encounter.\n       Defendant argues this evidence was inadmissible because there was no\nevidence he intended to threaten Ream or induced a reasonable belief that any\n\n\n                                            77\n\fthreats could be carried out. (See People v. Tuilaepa, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 580;\nBoyd, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 777.) However, Ream repeatedly testified that she\nfelt threatened, both by defendant‘s insulting words and his menacing behavior.\nShe could have reasonably understood his statement that her disciplinary write-up\nmeant nothing and he could ―do whatever‖ as a threat of physical retaliation for\nher call to security. The crime of unlawful threats can be established even if the\ndefendant had no present ability to act on the threat (People v. Harris (2008) 43\nCal.4th 1269, 1311), and the recipient need not perceive any immediate danger of\nthe threat being carried out (People v. Iboa (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 111, 121).\n       Moreover, even if defendant‘s verbal abuse of Ream did not rise to the\nlevel of criminal threats, evidence about the classroom encounter provided\nimportant context for testimony about his removal from the classroom, during\nwhich he forcibly struggled and made explicit threats against the security officer\nand counselor to ―settle things one-on-one.‖ Defendant does not dispute that\nevidence of this behavior was properly admitted. ― ‗[W]hen the prosecution has\nevidence of conduct by the defendant that [is admissible under section 190.3,\nfactor (b)], evidence of the surrounding circumstances is admissible to give\ncontext to the episode, even though the surrounding circumstances include other\ncriminal activity that would not be admissible by itself. [Citation.]‘ ‖ (People v.\nWallace (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1032, 1081.) In People v. Thomas (2011) 51 Cal.4th\n449, 505, evidence that the defendant had called a witness‘s son ―names like\n‗punk‘ and ‗sissy‘ ‖ was properly admitted as a surrounding circumstance of a\nfactor (b) crime. The same is true here.\n                     ii.    Threatening Statements to Deputies\n       Next, defendant challenges the admission of several factor (b) incidents\narising from his clashes with CYA deputies. All of the evidence was properly\nadmitted.\n       Deputy Tammy Wyatt reported defendant for passing hot water to another\ninmate, a rules violation. Angry about his limited access to hot water, defendant\n\n\n                                           78\n\fwarned a deputy that anyone who tried to enter his cell would be assaulted. When\nDeputy Wyatt brought him a food tray that week, he shoved it back at her.\nDefendant was interviewed about the disciplinary report and stated that ―if he\nwanted to get a write-up, he could get one for a much more severe incident.‖ He\nthen repeated there would be ―trouble‖ if deputies entered his cell. When the\ninterview ended and defendant‘s restraints were removed, he refused to step into\nthe pod. Instead, he turned to Deputy Wyatt and told her she had ―better not come\nup to his cell.‖ Contrary to defendant‘s claim, this remark could only have been\nintended, and understood, as a threat. Defendant was visibly angry with Deputy\nWyatt, had recently tried to hit her with a tray, and had repeatedly threatened to\nphysically assault any deputy who visited his cell. Defendant‘s warning to Wyatt\nclearly implied that defendant planned to assault her if she came to a place where\nhe was unrestrained.\n       Defendant made a similar threat to Deputy William Humphries when the\ndeputy had to tell him repeatedly to end a telephone call and return to his cell.\nDefendant yelled, ―You better check your attitude. You came in here with attitude\ntoday. You don‘t know who you are dealing with. I‘ll be here everyday,\nHumphries.‖ When the deputy began writing up a discipline report, defendant\nadded, ―I don‘t care if you are writing me up. . . . I don‘t care where I get sent.\nYou need to check your stuff. You still have to come in my room.‖ Although\ndefendant now minimizes this incident as mere ―mouthing off,‖ his words clearly\nimplied a threat to assault Deputy Humphries when the opportunity arose, and the\ndeputy understood the statements as threatening.\n       Defendant also challenges the admissibility of Humphries‘s testimony that\nthis incident occurred when defendant was in an administrative segregation unit\nfor high-profile or violent inmates. Rather than object, defense counsel chose to\ncross examine the deputy on procedures in the segregated unit. Absent an\nobjection, defendant‘s current challenge to the testimony is forfeited. (See People\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\fv. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 434-435.)26 In any event, as defendant‘s reply\nbrief concedes, this evidence was relevant context for Deputy Humphries‘s\nperception of defendant‘s statements as a threat.\n       Finally, defendant argues a deputy impermissibly testified that he had a\nreputation for violence. (See People v. Gonzalez (1990) 51 Cal.3d 1179, 1233.)\nDeputy Charles Foster testified briefly about a factor (b) incident involving\nPatterson. In cross-examination, defendant‘s attorney solicited the deputy‘s views\nabout defendant‘s demeanor in prison. Deputy Foster recalled having no real\nproblem with defendant, whom he considered no different than most other\ninmates. On redirect, the prosecutor asked whether defendant had a reputation in\nthe sheriff‘s department as being excessively violent toward staff. The court\nallowed the question, finding that counsel‘s cross-examination had opened the\ndoor to inquiry about defendant‘s character. Foster answered ―yes‖ and confirmed\nhearing about defendant‘s reputation over many years from many different\ndeputies.\n       Evidence offered in rebuttal to defense mitigation evidence need not relate\nto any specific aggravating factor under section 190.3. (Coffman and Marlow,\nsupra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 109.) We have repeatedly held that impeachment is\npermissible in the penalty phase when a defense witness offers testimony bearing\non the defendant‘s character. (People v. Payton (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1050, 1066;\nPeople v. Wagner (1975) 13 Cal.3d 612, 619.) Defense counsel elicited testimony\nfrom Deputy Foster suggesting defendant was no more violent than other inmates.\nThe People were entitled to rebut that suggestion with evidence that,\nnotwithstanding Deputy Foster‘s view, defendant was known to be an especially\n\n\n26      Defendant also did not object when Patterson‘s attorney elicited testimony\nfrom Deputy Judith Miller-Thrower that defendant‘s administrative segregation\nstatus required that he be transported in chains, even inside the jail. His present\nchallenge to this testimony was therefore not preserved. (People v. Zamudio,\nsupra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 354; People v. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 434-435.)\n\n\n                                         80\n\fviolent inmate. ―A defendant has no right to mislead the jury through one-sided\ncharacter testimony during either the guilt or penalty trial. We do not believe that\ndefendant was entitled to elicit testimony suggesting that he was [nonviolent], and\nat the same time to preclude the People from introducing contrary evidence.‖\n(People v. Siripongs (1988) 45 Cal.3d 548, 578.)\n                     iii.   Defendant’s Statement to Parole Officer\n       Parole Officer Craig Jackson testified about defendant‘s good behavior\nleading up to his release from CYA. During his last year there, defendant had no\nserious disciplinary infractions, had a job, attended classes in victim awareness\nand anger management, and expressed understanding of the seriousness of his\nconduct. Defendant‘s maturity level increased. He demonstrated insight into the\nreasons for his actions and understood how he could avoid violence in the future.\nIn the context of this testimony, Officer Jackson related that defendant told him\n― ‗he often reacted aggressively in order to gain stature among his peers and to\nmake himself feel good.‘ ‖ Defendant now argues this statement was inadmissible\nunder factor (b). We disagree. The statement reflected defendant‘s insight into\nwhy he had committed the many factor (b) offenses presented over the preceding\ndays. It was relevant context for these offenses and admissible as a surrounding\ncircumstance. (See People v. Wallace, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) It was also\nrelevant as a projection of defendant‘s state of mind with respect to the Beeson\nmurder, and thus admissible as a circumstance of this crime under section 190.3,\nfactor (a). (See People v. Nelson (2011) 51 Cal.4th 198, 224.) Finally,\n―[e]vidence of statements from defendant‘s own mouth demonstrating his attitude\ntoward his victims was highly probative‖ on the issue of future dangerousness.\n(People v. Payton, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 1063.)\n       3.     Expert Testimony on Antisocial Personality Disorder and Future\n              Dangerousness\n       Defendant contends the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to cross-\nexamine his expert witness about antisocial personality disorder and future\n\n\n                                         81\n\fdangerousness. Given the scope of the expert‘s direct examination, these topics\nwere properly raised for impeachment.\n       The defense called Jamie Candelaria-Greene, Ph.D., an expert in learning\ndisabilities and special education. At the outset of her testimony, the court read a\nstandard instruction explaining that an expert‘s opinions should be assessed in\nlight of the expert‘s qualifications and the supporting facts and reasons. Dr.\nCandelaria-Greene had reviewed defendant‘s school, medical, probation, and\nCYA records but had not met with defendant before the trial. Based on her record\nreview, she testified that defendant suffered from ADHD. Defendant had never\nreceived medication or counseling for that condition.\n       Defense counsel specifically asked if the expert was aware of studies\nexamining the effects of giving prisoners ADHD medication, such as Ritalin. She\ndescribed ―an excellent study‖ in which Colorado adult prisoners who showed\nclassic signs of ADHD were given Ritalin and counseling. After six months, their\nrecidivism rate ―plummeted‖ from the nationwide average of 50 to 60 percent\ndown to 10 percent. Those still in prison were better able to participate in hobbies\nand vocational education, ―but most of all, there was a greater degree of safety\nassociated with . . . the prisoners and those around‖ them. Defense counsel also\nasked her about the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV). She confirmed\nshe was familiar with the DSM-IV and explained that it is used for diagnosing\npsychiatric conditions, including ADHD.\n       On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked about the DSM-IV\nrequirements for diagnosing antisocial personality disorder. The expert eventually\nagreed that defendant had been repeatedly diagnosed with a conduct disorder and\nfit the other DSM-IV requirements for antisocial personality disorder. She did not\nactually give her own diagnosis that defendant had this disorder. Much of her\ntestimony was based on hypothetical questions, and she repeatedly protested that\nshe was not a psychologist. Defendant objected that Dr. Candelaria-Greene was\nnot qualified to testify about the contents of the DSM-IV. The court found the\n\n\n                                         82\n\fquestioning proper because the expert testified on direct examination that she had\nrelied on the DSM-IV in reaching her conclusions. At defendant‘s request,\nhowever, the court gave a limiting instruction explaining that any reports\nreferenced or read during the expert‘s testimony were not admitted for truth but\nonly to show the basis of her opinions.\n       The prosecutor also asked about defendant‘s history of violent incidents in\nschool and CYA. The expert agreed that, without a change in environmental\nconditions, past violence is the best predictor of future dangerousness. In\nparticular, she testified that defendant‘s potential for future violence was high\ngiven his past behavior. Defendant objected at sidebar that the subject of future\ndangerousness was beyond her expertise. The court overruled this objection,\nobserving that the ―linchpin‖ of her direct examination testimony was that\ndefendant would be safe around others in prison if he were treated with Ritalin and\ncounseling. Having raised the subject of defendant‘s future violence in prison, the\ncourt ruled the defense could not insulate it from cross-examination. (See People\nv. Gates (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1168, 1211, disapproved on another ground in People v.\nWilliams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 459.) When the court later described its ruling on\nthe record, defendant‘s attorney clarified his objection. He said, ―There is no\nquestion that we raised it and that it was proper to discuss future dangerousness.‖\nInstead, he meant to object that questions about material in psychiatric reports\nwere beyond her area of expertise.\n       This concession fatally undermines defendant‘s challenge to the cross-\nexamination on future dangerousness. (People v. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th at\npp. 434-435.) In any event, the claim lacks merit. ― ‗While the prosecution is\nprohibited from offering expert testimony predicting future dangerousness in its\ncase-in-chief [citation], it may explore the issue on cross-examination or in\nrebuttal if defendant offers expert testimony predicting good prison behavior in the\nfuture. [Citations.]‖ (People v. Jones, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1260.) Defendant\nraised the issue when he elicited testimony that ADHD prisoners treated with\n\n\n                                          83\n\fmedication and counseling exhibited ―a greater degree of safety‖ than was\notherwise expected of them. Having chosen to raise this subject, the defense could\nnot reasonably insulate it from cross-examination. (People v. Gates, supra, 43\nCal.3d at p. 1211.)\n       Defendant‘s challenge to cross-examination based on the DSM-IV is\nsimilarly unavailing. We rejected this same claim in People v. Seaton (2001) 26\nCal.4th 598, 679-680. There, after a defense expert testified that the defendant\nsuffered an anxiety disorder and an atypical personality disorder, the prosecutor\nused the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to demonstrate on cross-examination\nthat defendant met the requirements for a diagnosis of antisocial personality\ndisorder. (Id. at p. 679.) We held this questioning was within the bounds of\nappropriate impeachment. (Id. at pp. 679-680; see People v. Mills, supra, 48\nCal.4th at p. 207 [―Because the defense experts relied on the DSM-IV to reach\ntheir opinions, the prosecutor was permitted to explore their familiarity with the\nDSM-IV on cross-examination‖].) Defendant attempts to distinguish Seaton and\nMills because those cases involved no dispute about the expert‘s qualification to\nrender a psychiatric opinion. He argues Dr. Candelaria-Greene was not qualified\nto diagnose antisocial personality disorder. However, defendant himself offered\nher expert diagnosis of ADHD based on the criteria in the DSM-IV. ―When, as\nhere, a mental health expert offers a diagnosis, this opens the door to rebuttal\ntestimony questioning that diagnosis or suggesting an alternative diagnosis.\n[Citation.]‖ (People v. Smith (2005) 35 Cal.4th 334, 359; see People v. Daniels\n(1991) 52 Cal.3d 815, 883.)\n       We have never held that cross-examination must be confined to questions\nabout the precise diagnosis an expert offers. Nor do our cases require that\nprosecutors present alternate diagnoses through rebuttal testimony, instead of\ncross-examination. Either way, the evidence is permissible as impeachment of the\nexpert‘s opinion. (See People v. Daniels, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 884.) Finally, it\nwould be anomalous to hold that deficiencies in an expert‘s qualifications\n\n\n                                         84\n\fsomehow shield her opinions from vigorous testing on cross-examination. Indeed,\nthose deficiencies were themselves an appropriate topic of cross-examination.\n(Evid. Code, § 721, subd. (a).)27\n       4.     Prosecutorial Misconduct\n       Defendant claims the prosecutor committed several acts of misconduct,\nviolating his rights to a fair trial and penalty determination. ―Improper comments\nby a prosecutor require reversal of a resulting conviction when those comments so\ninfect a trial with unfairness that they create a denial of due process. [Citations.]\nConduct by a prosecutor that does not reach that level nevertheless constitutes\nmisconduct under state law, but only if it involves the use of deceptive or\nreprehensible methods to persuade the court or jury. [Citation.]‖ (People v.\nWatkins (2012) 55 Cal.4th 999, 1031.) None of the challenged incidents\nconstitutes prejudicial misconduct.\n              a.     Epithets\n       Defendant complains the prosecutor committed misconduct when he used\ntwo epithets. In opening statement, the prosecutor referred to defendant and\nPatterson as ―evil men.‖ Defendant objected the next day. The court sustained the\nobjection and directed the prosecutor not to use that characterization in the\nremainder of his opening statement. The second epithet occurred during the cross-\nexamination of Dr. Candelaria-Greene. The prosecutor asked a hypothetical\nquestion about assessing an unwilling subject, whom he referred to as a ―violent\njerk.‖ The court sustained defense counsel‘s objection and told the prosecutor to\nrephrase the question. The prosecutor then described in detail all the personality\n\n27     In his reply brief, defendant argues the court in its gatekeeper role has a\nduty to vet proffered expert opinions. (See Evid. Code, §§ 801-802; Sargon\nEnterprises, Inc. v. University of Southern California (2012) 55 Cal.4th 747, 769.)\nOnce again, defendant ignores that the challenged testimony was elicited on cross-\nexamination. The prosecutor did not ―proffer‖ Dr. Candelaria-Greene‘s opinion.\nRather, he impeached the opinions she offered on direct examination by\ndemonstrating that the records she reviewed supported an alternative diagnosis.\nWe need not further discuss defendant‘s analysis of the Sargon precedent.\n\n\n                                          85\n\fattributes he was referring to with the shorthand ―jerk.‖ The defense raised no\nfurther objection.\n       For a prosecutor‘s remarks to constitute misconduct, it must appear\nreasonably likely in the context of the whole argument and instructions that ― ‗the\njury understood or applied the complained-of comments in an improper or\nerroneous manner.‘ ‖ (People v. Centeno (2014) 60 Cal.4th 659, 667.) To the\nextent defendant‘s objections were preserved, the mild and fleeting descriptions\nhere do not rise to the level of misconduct. In People v. Zambrano (2007) 41\nCal.4th 1082, 1172, the prosecutor repeatedly called the defendant ― ‗evil‘ ‖ in\nclosing argument. We found no misconduct, noting that several more derogatory\nepithets have been found within the range of permissible argument. (Ibid.; see\ne.g., People v. Friend (2009) 47 Cal.4th 1, 84 [defendant called an ― ‗insidious\nlittle bastard‘ ‖]; People v. Thomas (1992) 2 Cal.4th 489, 537 [defendant called a\n― ‗perverted murderous cancer‘ ‖].) Similarly, in People v. Farnam, supra, 28\nCal.4th at page 168, we concluded opening statement descriptions of the defendant\nas ― ‗monstrous,‘ ‖ ― ‗cold-blooded,‘ ‖ and a ― ‗predator‘ ‖ were fair comment on\nwhat the prosecutor expected the evidence would show.\n       Moreover, the jury was instructed that opening statements are not evidence\nbut merely reflect counsel‘s prediction of what the evidence will show. With\nrespect to the hypothetical question that insinuated defendant was a ―jerk,‖ the\njury was also instructed that questions of counsel are not evidence. Considering\nthese admonitions, and the ample evidence of the murder‘s brutality and\ndefendant‘s callous behavior afterward, it is not reasonably likely that the\nprosecutor‘s description of him as ―evil‖ or a ―violent jerk‖ improperly inflamed\nthe jury. (See People v. Friend, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 84.)\n              b.     Closing Argument\n       Defendant claims the prosecutor committed misconduct three times in\nclosing argument by referencing facts not in evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         86\n\f       First, the prosecutor challenged Dr. Candelaria-Greene‘s credibility by\nobserving that her opinions contradicted those of many experts whose reports she\nhad reviewed. The experts who had evaluated defendant in person all concluded\nhis potential for future violence was high. In contrast, the prosecutor argued, Dr.\nCandelaria-Greene ―wouldn‘t even sit down with him face-to-face. Now[,]\nwhether that‘s a [sleight]-of-hand legal strategy or she didn‘t want to be in the\nsame room with him, don‘t know. But she wouldn‘t even sit in the same room\nwith him.‖\n       Defendant did not object to this statement and therefore forfeited a claim of\nmisconduct. ―As a general rule a defendant may not complain on appeal of\nprosecutorial misconduct unless in a timely fashion—and on the same ground—\nthe defendant made an assignment of misconduct and requested that the jury be\nadmonished to disregard the impropriety.‖ (People v. Samayoa (1997) 15 Cal.4th\n795, 841.)\n       The claim also fails on the merits. Defendant complains that the\nprosecutor‘s remarks about why Dr. Candelaria-Greene may have failed to meet\nwith defendant were pure speculation. But the challenged remarks were not\nphrased as assertions. By expressly stating that he did not know why the expert\nfailed to meet with defendant, the prosecutor conceded the reasons he was offering\nwere merely reasonable possibilities. His point was that no conceivable reason\njustified offering an opinion without an in-person evaluation. In context, it is not\nreasonably likely the jury would have misunderstood his comments as asserting a\ndefinitive reason for the lack of a face-to-face meeting.\n       Second, defendant contends the prosecutor implicitly attacked his character\nwhen he argued: ―Where are the family members? They‘re here in the\ncommunity; they‘re local; they‘re around. Where are they? Why didn‘t they\ncome in here and tell you something?‖ Because defendant did not object to these\nremarks, he forfeited any claim of error. (People v. Clark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 960.) Moreover, we have held that argument about the absence of a defendant‘s\n\n\n                                         87\n\ffamily members from trial does not constitute misconduct, but permissible\ncomment on the defendant‘s failure to call logical witnesses. (People v.\nZambrano, supra, 41 Cal.4th at pp. 1173-1174.) The argument here was within\nappropriate bounds.\n       Third, defendant complains the prosecutor‘s closing argument exaggerated\nthe pleasures of prison life. After describing the trauma Beeson‘s family endured,\nthe prosecutor compared the defendants‘ life in custody: ―They go on. They have\ntheir life in jail, their card games, their basketball games. . . . [¶] There‘s a social\nlife, their jobs, schools, educational opportunities.‖ Defense counsel objected at\nsidebar that no evidence had been presented on the conditions in state prison. The\ncourt sustained the objection but allowed the prosecutor to argue about evidence\nthat was presented on the conditions in CYA and county jail. When argument\nresumed, the prosecutor stated: ―You‘ve heard from evidence what life is like in\njail and what life is like in the California Youth Authority. You get to play sports,\nbasketball, card games, make home-made alcohol; there‘s marijuana, cookies, and\nenchiladas, canteen privileges. There are . . . telephones, there are letters, there are\nvisits. There‘s sex. You‘ve heard evidence that a full life exists behind bars.\nMaybe not the life . . . you would like to think of, but . . . if you get yourself a life\nsentence out of this trial, you get to have that institutional life, and you‘ve heard\nevidence about jail and about the California Youth Authority, and that includes all\nthose things, things to look forward to. Most of the same things that we all have in\nour lives now, although they‘re in a different form.‖ He then stressed that\ndefendants had taken all of these joys of life from Beeson and destroyed her\nfamily.\n       Although defendant objected, and his objection was sustained, he did not\nask the court to admonish the jury to disregard the prosecutor‘s argument.\nAccordingly, he forfeited this challenge on appeal. (People v. Redd (2010) 48\nCal.4th 691, 753.) In any event, it was unlikely the jury would have\nmisunderstood the prosecutor‘s initial argument to be about state prison\n\n\n                                           88\n\fconditions. After the sidebar, he repeatedly referenced specific evidence the jury\nhad heard about conditions in both CYA and county jail. Moreover, defense\ncounsel‘s final argument dispelled any prejudice that may have arisen. While not\npermitted to discuss any specific prison where defendant might be sent,\ndefendant‘s attorney argued that the prosecutor‘s ―country club theory‖ of prison\nlife ―never gives us any detail about such things as lack of freedom, lack of choice,\neven lack of basic privacy. With the toilet and wash basin in the cell, people have\nlikened it to living their entire lives in a bathroom.‖ He also described the small\nsize of the cell and the fact that defendant would have little contact with his family\nor the outside world.\n       Separately, defendant claims the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to\nargue that there was no evidence of an emotional disturbance. Killing while under\nthe influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance may be considered in\nmitigation under section 190.3, factor (d). In the course of discussing all\nmitigation factors, the prosecutor simply pointed out that no evidence had been\npresented in support of factor (d). Defendant does not dispute the truth of this\npoint but claims the argument implicitly suggested jurors could consider absence\nof the mitigating factor as a factor in aggravation. It is true that ―the absence of\nthis mitigating factor is not itself aggravating.‖ (People v. Riel (2000) 22 Cal.4th\n1153, 1223; see People v. Davenport (1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 289-290.) However,\nthe prosecutor never invited the jury to draw this improper inference. On the\ncontrary, after arguing that no mitigating evidence had been presented regarding\ndefendant, the prosecutor stated: ―I want to be absolutely clear. I‘ve talked to you\nabout evidence has to be used in categories . . . . I‘ve talked to you about\naggravating factors. There is not an aggravating factor that in any way says lack\nof mitigation. So the fact that there‘s no mitigation for Norman Patterson, that is\nnot an aggravating factor. Okay. It‘s important that you apply this evidence\nproperly. . . . [¶] So the absence of mitigation is not an aggravating factor.‖ This\nargument was appropriate and the court did not err in allowing it.\n\n\n                                          89\n\f              c.     Rebuttal Argument\n       Defendant raises three complaints of misconduct in the prosecutor‘s\nrebuttal argument. Each of these claims was forfeited by lack of an objection and,\non the merits, fails to establish prejudicial misconduct.\n       First, defendant contends the prosecutor attacked the integrity of defense\ncounsel by pointing out their positions throughout the trial. He reminded jurors\nthat at the guilt phase defense counsel had argued defendant was innocent and had\nfalsely confessed. The prosecutor then observed, ―Now you are being told by the\nsame attorney for the same defendant, oh, well, he did do it. Okay. You guys are\nright. We tried to fool you last time.‖ Still speaking in the role of defense\ncounsel, the prosecutor said, ―It‘s as though it is whatever we can say to try and\nfool you and beat you. Whatever we can say to try and trick you into making a\nmistake as a jury, to get you to make the wrong decision that will favor the\ndefendants. [¶] We will say anything to you, anything whatsoever.‖ The\nprosecutor then briefly explained the concept of lingering doubt and stressed that it\nshould not apply because, in saying they did not contest the guilt phase verdict, the\ndefendants‘ lawyers were acknowledging their clients‘ guilt. He continued: ―So,\nto the extent that you heard arguments to the contrary at the end of the guilt phase,\nyou were being intentionally misled.‖ The prosecutor then urged jurors to be\nskeptical of defense counsel‘s penalty phase arguments, contending they would\nsay anything to persuade the jury to return the more lenient sentence.\n       Defendant failed to raise a timely objection to this argument and therefore\nforfeited his claim of misconduct. (People v. Gionis (1995) 9 Cal.4th 1196, 1215.)\nOn the merits, the remarks did not result in prejudicial error.\n       Personal attacks on the integrity of opposing counsel can constitute\nmisconduct. (People v. Espinoza (1992) 3 Cal.4th 806, 820.) ―It is generally\nimproper for the prosecutor to accuse defense counsel of fabricating a defense\n[citations], or to imply that counsel is free to deceive the jury [citation]. Such\nattacks on counsel‘s credibility risk focusing the jury‘s attention on irrelevant\n\n\n                                          90\n\fmatters and diverting the prosecution from its proper role of commenting on the\nevidence and drawing reasonable inferences therefrom.‖ (People v. Bemore\n(2000) 22 Cal.4th 809, 846.) However, ―the prosecutor has wide latitude in\ndescribing the deficiencies in opposing counsel‘s tactics and factual account.‖\n(Ibid.)\n          The prosecutor‘s remarks here highlight the inconsistency in defense\ncounsel‘s positions about the truth of the confession. Although counsel nominally\naccepted the jury‘s verdict that defendant gave a true confession, he argued the\npolice had promised defendant he could avoid the death penalty by confessing and\ntold the jury, ―You, in fact, are the only ones who can give Grayland the benefit of\nhis bargain . . . .‖ We have upheld prosecutorial arguments suggesting defense\ncounsel‘s ―job‖ is to confuse the jury and say anything necessary to obtain a\nfavorable verdict. (See People v. Gionis, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1216-1217;\nPeople v. Bell (1989) 49 Cal.3d 502, 538.) Although the remarks here were\nsomewhat harsher, in that the prosecutor characterized counsel‘s arguments as\nintentionally misleading, he did not claim defense counsel had fabricated a defense\nor deceived the jury about the evidence they were to consider. (See People v.\nClark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 961.) In any event, even if the comments were\nunfair to defense counsel, they ―did not comprise a pattern of egregious\nmisbehavior making the trial fundamentally unfair.‖ (People v. Espinoza, supra, 3\nCal.4th at p. 820.) Nor was it reasonably possible they affected the verdict. (See\nPeople v. Peoples (2016) 62 Cal.4th 718, 804; People v. Abilez (2007) 41 Cal.4th\n472, 525-526.) Even though the remarks were directed against all of the defense\nlawyers,28 the jury reached different verdicts for defendant and Patterson.\n          Next, defendant claims the prosecutor improperly asked jurors to place\nthemselves in the victim‘s position and argued the facts of other cases.\n\n\n28    Defendant and Patterson were each represented by two attorneys\nthroughout the trial.\n\n\n                                          91\n\fDefendant‘s attorney had argued Beeson‘s death was merely an impulsive murder\nand not ―the worst of the worst,‖ such as a terrorist bombing, sniper killing, or one\ninvolving kidnapping or sexual assault. In response, the prosecutor asked the jury\nto imagine the experience of someone murdered by a bomb or a sniper. Those\nvictims are instantaneously killed and ―never knew what hit them.‖ Then he asked\nthe jury to think about everything Beeson experienced: being held down on the\nfloor, hit in the face with a shotgun, ―having a belt put around your neck . . . .\nhaving two men holding you down on the floor with their knees and each one has\nan end on that belt and they are pulling and yanking . . . . [¶] Think about fighting\nfor your life because you want to live.‖ He then argued Beeson suffered more\nthan the 167 people who died instantly in the Oklahoma City bombing. After the\ncourt sustained an objection to argument about other cases, the prosecutor\nrephrased his point only slightly, stating, ―She suffered more than a hundred\nvictims suffered in a bomb blast . . . .‖ Finally, he asked the jury to think about\nhow painful the stabbing must have been and how frightened Beeson must have\nfelt.\n        Defendant now argues it was misconduct for the prosecutor to suggest that\njurors adopt Beeson‘s position. Because he did not object below, however, the\ntrial court had no opportunity to consider the objection, admonish the jury, or\ncurtail argument along these lines. (See People v. Bemore, supra, 22 Cal.4th at\npp. 845-846.) A failure to object and request an admonition will be excused only\nif an objection would have been futile or an admonition would not have cured the\nharm. (People v. Cole (2004) 33 Cal.4th 1158, 1201.) Defendant has shown\nneither; therefore the objection is forfeited on appeal. (People v. Redd, supra, 48\nCal.4th at p. 753.)\n        The claim also fails on the merits. Although it is inappropriate at the guilt\nphase for a prosecutor to appeal to sympathy by inviting the jury to view the case\nthrough the victim‘s eyes (People v. Leonard (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1370, 1406-1407),\nsuch appeals are entirely appropriate at the penalty phase. (People v. Wash, supra,\n\n\n                                          92\n\f6 Cal.4th at p. 263.) The prosecutor encouraged jurors to think closely about the\nsuffering Beeson endured during defendants‘ long and brutal attack in response to\ndefense counsel‘s minimization of the murder as a ―rash, impulsive killing with\nweapons at hand.‖ ― ‗To the extent that the argument was inviting the jurors to put\nthemselves in the shoes of the victim, we have found such an appeal appropriate at\nthe penalty phase because there ―the jury decides a question the resolution of\nwhich turns not only on the facts, but on the jury‘s moral assessment of those facts\nas they reflect on whether defendant should be put to death. . . . In this process,\none of the most significant considerations is the nature of the underlying crime.\n[Citation.] Hence assessment of the offense from the victim‘s viewpoint would\nappear germane to the task of sentencing.‖ ‘ ‖ (Id. at pp. 263-264; see People v.\nLewis (1990) 50 Cal.3d 262, 283-284.) Nor did the prosecutor‘s argument\nencourage the jury to subordinate their reason to emotion. (See Wash, at p. 264.)\n       Finally, defendant complains the prosecutor ignored the court‘s ruling when\nhe revised his comparison to the Oklahoma City bombing to describe a generic\nbombing with ―a hundred‖ victims. Defendant did not renew his objection, thus\nforfeiting his claim on appeal. (People v. Redd, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 753.) In\nany event, this brief reference to bombing victims did not rise to the level of\nmisconduct. Although the precise crime the prosecutor had in mind was clear\nfrom his previous statement, he technically complied with the court‘s ruling by\nrephrasing his remark to refer to a generic bombing. No misconduct occurred.\n              d.     Cumulative Prejudice\n       Defendant argues that even if individual acts of prosecutorial misconduct\nwere not prejudicial, the incidents considered together were so cumulatively\nprejudicial as to require reversal. Although we observed that some statements in\nthe prosecutor‘s rebuttal argument bordered on misconduct, they did not render the\ntrial unfair or prejudice defendant. None of the other challenged statements\nconstituted misconduct. Accordingly, there was no prejudice to accumulate.\n\n\n\n\n                                         93\n\f       5.     Refusal to Modify Death Sentence\n       Defendant claims the court erred in denying his automatic motion to\nmodify the death verdict. (§ 190.4, subd. (e).) In ruling on such a motion, ―the\ntrial court must reweigh independently the evidence of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances and then determine whether, in its independent judgment, the\nweight of the evidence supports the jury‘s verdict. [Citations.] The trial court\nmust ‗consider, take into account, and be guided by‘ the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances referred to in section 190.3.‖ (People v. Crittenden,\nsupra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 150.) ―On appeal, we review the trial court‘s ruling\nindependently, but it is not our role to redetermine the penalty in the first instance.\n[Citations.]‖ (People v. Gamache (2010) 48 Cal.4th 347, 403.)\n       Defendant complains the court ―either minimized the mitigating factors or\nignored them, while at the same time exaggerating the aggravating factors and\ngiving them undue weight.‖ The assertion is meritless. The court‘s extensive\nruling, spanning 46 pages of reporter‘s transcript, meticulously examines all the\nevidence presented on each relevant sentencing factor. The court discussed the\nevidence in an even-handed manner. It independently and reasonably concluded\nthat aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances and the\njury‘s verdict was supported by ―the overwhelming weight of the evidence.‖\n       Defendant finds fault with only one specific sentence in this voluminous\nrecord. He notes that, when describing the facts leading up to the murder, the\ncourt stated that defendant ―coveted a gun to use in committing robberies, perhaps\nin committing murders.‖ Defendant asserts this statement included improper\nspeculation because there was no evidence he wanted a gun to commit murder.\nThe evidence was undisputed that defendant sought a gun to commit robberies.\nThe court qualified its statement about murders by noting that ―perhaps‖ defendant\nwanted the gun for this purpose as well, and this was a reasonable inference to be\ndrawn from testimony that defendant was not opposed to killing bystanders during\nrobberies. This brief inference from the evidence does not undermine the court‘s\n\n\n                                          94\n\fcareful, independent, thorough review of the evidence, which we conclude is\namply supported by the record.\n       6.     Cumulative Error\n       Defendant claims that even if the alleged errors were individually harmless,\nthey were cumulatively prejudicial. We found that stationing a deputy at the\nwitness stand during defendant‘s testimony unsupported by case-specific reasons\nwas error, but harmless. In addition, while noting the claim was not preserved, we\nalso found harmless any assumed misconduct arising from the prosecutor‘s\nrebuttal argument. There are no additional errors, assumed or otherwise, to\naccumulate.\n       7.     Imposition of Death Penalty for Felony Murder\n       Defendant was eligible for the death penalty because the jury found that he\nmurdered Beeson in the course of a robbery. ―The felony-based special\ncircumstances do not require that the defendant intend to kill. It is sufficient if the\ndefendant is the actual killer or either intends to kill or ‗with reckless indifference\nto human life and as a major participant, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces,\nsolicits, requests, or assists in the commission‘ of the felony. [Citations.]‖\n(People v. Rountree (2013) 56 Cal.4th 823, 854.)\n       Defendant now argues capital punishment for felony murder violates the\nEighth Amendment and international law. We have long held that the death\npenalty is constitutional when, as here, the defendant is the actual killer. (See,\ne.g., People v. Watkins, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 1033-1034; People v. Taylor,\nsupra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 661.) Furthermore, ―[i]mposition of the death penalty\nabsent a finding of a culpable mental state for an actual killer does not violate\ninternational law because international law does not prohibit a sentence of death\nrendered in accordance with state and federal constitutional and statutory\nrequirements.‖ (People v. Chism (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1266, 1333.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          95\n\f       8.     Delay in Processing Death Penalty Appeals\n       Defendant was sentenced to death in June 2003. Almost nine years later,\nafter delays in the appointment of appellate counsel and correction of the record,\nhe filed his opening brief on appeal. Defendant argues the delay in processing his\nappeal violates international norms as well his constitutional rights to due process,\nequal protection, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. We have\nconsistently rejected this claim, explaining that ―the automatic appeal process\nfollowing judgments of death is a constitutional safeguard, not a constitutional\ndefect [citations], because it assures careful review of the defendant‘s conviction\nand sentence [citation].‖ (People v. Anderson, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 606.)\nMoreover, while we remain sensitive to the evolution of Eighth Amendment\ndoctrine, we recently found no factual basis for concluding that systemic delays\nrender California‘s capital punishment scheme arbitrary and capricious. (People v.\nSeumanu (2015) 61 Cal.4th 1293, 1368-1375.) The record here is likewise\ninsufficient to support such a claim.\n       9.     Constitutionality of Death Penalty Law\n       Defendant raises several challenges to the constitutionality of California‘s\ncapital sentencing scheme, all of which this court has previously rejected.\nDefendant presents the claims to preserve them for federal review, but he does not\npersuade us to reconsider any of these settled decisions. Once again, we hold as\nfollows:\n       Section 190.2 adequately narrows the category of death-eligible defendants\nand is not impermissibly overbroad under the requirements of the Fifth, Sixth,\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. (People v.\nWhalen (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1, 90; People v. Jones (2012) 54 Cal.4th 1, 85.) The\nvarious special circumstances are not unduly numerous or expansive. (People v.\nLinton (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1146, 1214; People v. Jennings (2010) 50 Cal.4th 616,\n688; People v. Stanley (1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 842-843.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         96\n\f        Section 190.3, factor (a), which directs the jury to consider circumstances\nof the crime, does not allow arbitrary and capricious sentencing in violation of the\nFifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments. (People v. Linton, supra, 56\nCal.4th at pp. 1214-1215.) ― ‗Defendant‘s argument that a seemingly inconsistent\nrange of circumstances can be culled from death penalty decisions proves too\nmuch. What this reflects is that each case is judged on its facts, each defendant on\nthe particulars of his offense. Contrary to defendant‘s position, a statutory scheme\nwould violate constitutional limits if it did not allow such individualized\nassessment of the crimes but instead mandated death in specified circumstances.‘\n(People v. Brown (2004) 33 Cal.4th 382, 401.)‖ (People v. Jennings, supra, 50\nCal.4th at pp. 688–689; see also Tuilaepa v. California (1994) 512 U.S. 967, 976\n[§190.3, factor (a) not unconstitutionally vague].)\n        The use of unadjudicated criminal activity as an aggravating factor does not\nviolate due process or the right to a jury trial, nor must the jury make a unanimous\nfinding on this or any other evidence admitted under factor (b). (People v.\nWhalen, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 91; People v. Ward (2005) 36 Cal.4th 186, 221-\n222.)\n        There is no constitutional requirement that the jury unanimously find\nbeyond a reasonable doubt the existence of aggravating factors, that aggravating\nfactors outweigh mitigating factors, or that death is the appropriate penalty.\n(People v. Whalen, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 90; People v. Clark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 1007; People v. Blair (2005) 36 Cal.4th 686, 753.) ―The high court‘s decisions\ninterpreting the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial (Ring v. Arizona (2002) 536\nU.S. 584; Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466) do not require otherwise.\n[Citations.]‖ (Clark, at p. 1007; see People v. Prieto (2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 275.)\nNor does any constitutional provision require an instruction on the reasonable\ndoubt standard for determining penalty at a capital trial. (People v. Linton, supra,\n56 Cal.4th at pp. 1215-1216; Blair, at p. 753.) On the contrary, trial courts should\nnot instruct on any burden of proof or persuasion at the penalty phase because\n\n\n                                         97\n\fsentencing is an inherently moral and normative function, and not a factual one\namenable to burden of proof calculations. (People v. Lee, supra, 51 Cal.4th at\npp. 655-656; People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 724; People v. Lenart (2004)\n32 Cal.4th 1107, 1136-1137; see Kansas v. Carr (2016) 577 U.S. __ [136 S.Ct.\n633, 642] [penalty phase evaluation of mitigating circumstances is not susceptible\nto a standard of proof].)\n       Because nothing in the penalty phase instructions would mislead a jury into\nbelieving mitigating factors had to be found unanimously, a specific instruction to\nthis effect was not required. (People v. Boyette, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 466;\nPeople v. Weaver (2001) 26 Cal.4th 876, 988.) ―Nor is an instruction on the\nabsence of a burden of proof constitutionally required. [Citation.]‖ (People v.\nBrasure (2008) 42 Cal.4th 1037, 1067.) The federal Constitution does not require\nthat the court designate which factors are aggravating or mitigating, or instruct the\njury that certain factors are relevant only in mitigation. (People v. Linton, supra,\n56 Cal.4th at p. 1216; People v. Carpenter (1999) 21 Cal.4th 1016, 1064.)\n       The lack of written findings by the jury during the penalty phase does not\nviolate the federal Constitution or deprive a capital defendant of meaningful\nappellate review. (People v. Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1216; People v.\nWhalen, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 90-91.) Intercase proportionality review,\ncomparing defendant‘s case to other murder cases to assess relative culpability, is\nnot required by the due process, equal protection, fair trial, or cruel and unusual\npunishment clauses of the federal Constitution. (Whalen, at p. 91; People v. Cook\n(2006) 39 Cal.4th 566, 619.) Nor does the death penalty statute violate equal\nprotection by providing capital defendants with different procedural safeguards\nthan those given to noncapital defendants. (People v. Williams (2008) 43 Cal.4th\n584, 650; People v. Clark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Finally, California‘s use\nof the death penalty does not violate international norms or evolving standards of\ndecency in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. (Linton, at\np. 1217; Whalen, at p. 92; Clark, at p. 1008.)\n\n\n                                         98\n\f                                 DISPOSITION\n     The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                               CORRIGAN, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C. J.\nWERDEGAR, J.\nCHIN, J.\nLIU, J.\nCUÉLLAR, J.\nKRUGER, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                     99\n\f                     CONCURRING OPINION BY LIU, J.\n       Today‘s opinion restates two aspects of our Batson/Wheeler jurisprudence\nthat merit reexamination in an appropriate case. (Batson v. Kentucky (1986) 476\nU.S. 79 (Batson); People v. Wheeler (1978) 22 Cal.3d 258 (Wheeler).)\n       First, with respect to comparative juror analysis, the court says: ―Pretext is\nestablished . . . when the compared jurors have expressed ‗a substantially similar\ncombination of responses,‘ in all material respects, to the jurors excused. (People\nv. DeHoyos [(2013) 57 Cal.4th 79, 107], italics added.)‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at\np. 37.) This statement appears in tension with how the United States Supreme\nCourt has conducted comparative juror analysis in three significant cases. (See\nFoster v. Chatman (2016) 578 U.S. __, __–__ [136 S.Ct. 1737, 1750–1754];\nSnyder v. Louisiana (2008) 552 U.S. 472, 483–484; Miller-El v. Dretke (2005)\n545 U.S. 231, 241–249.) In all three cases, the prosecutor gave more than one\nreason for each contested strike, and the high court, even when conducting\ncomparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal, drew inferences of\ndiscrimination by comparing struck and seated jurors with respect to one or more\nof the stated reasons considered individually. The high court has not required ― ‗a\nsubstantially similar combination of responses,‘ in all material respects‖ (maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 37), in order to find comparisons between excused and seated\njurors on a particular characteristic to be probative of discrimination. Indeed, the\ndissent in Miller-El argued that ― ‗ ―[s]imilarly situated‖ does not mean matching\nany one of several reasons the prosecution gave for striking a potential juror — it\nmeans matching all of them‘ ‖ (Miller-El, at p. 291 (dis. opn. of Thomas, J.)), but\n\fthe high court expressly rejected that view (id. at p. 247, fn. 6). On this point, as\nwith earlier aspects of our case law on comparative juror analysis, our approach\nappears out of step with controlling authority and ripe for reconsideration. (Cf.\nPeople v. Lenix (2008) 44 Cal.4th 602, 622 [abandoning, in light of Snyder and\nMiller-El, our rule in People v. Johnson (2003) 30 Cal.4th 1302, 1324–1325, that a\nreviewing court should not conduct comparative juror analysis for the first time on\nappeal].)\n       Second, today‘s opinion includes dicta restating that a trial court, in ruling\non a Batson motion, may ―take into account ‗the court‘s own experiences as a\nlawyer and bench officer in the community, and even the common practices of the\nadvocate and the office that employs him or her. (See Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d\nat p. 281.)‘ ‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 26.) To the extent this statement authorizes\ntrial judges to rely on personal knowledge of the prosecutor or experience with the\nprosecutor‘s office, I believe it may go too far. We have almost never relied on\nsuch a basis for upholding a trial court‘s Batson ruling (one minor exception is\nPeople v. DeHoyos, supra, 57 Cal.4th 79, 115), and there is good reason not to do\nso.\n       Adkins v. Warden (11th Cir. 2013) 710 F.3d 1241 (Adkins) is instructive.\nThe prosecutor in that case said he struck a black juror because the juror was a\nsingle man. A few weeks later, the trial court discovered the juror was married.\nThe prosecutor submitted an affidavit explaining that he did not learn until ― ‗long\nafter the trial and upon reading the transcript‘ ‖ that the juror was actually married.\n(Id. at p. 1245.) The trial court relied on its ―own personal experience with the\nprosecutor in other cases‖ to conclude that this explanation was credible: ―This\nCourt having worked with District Attorney Davis on many other cases in the past,\nfinds that he has never intentionally misrepresented any fact to this Court to gain\nan advantage in a criminal proceeding. He has many times admitted facts which\n\n                                           2\n\fwere to the detriment of his cases and accepted the consequences of facts that were\nagainst his case. This Court has never found District Attorney Davis to\npurposefully exclude blacks from juries in cases prosecuted by him. The Court\nfinds his statement as to mistaken belief as to the marital status of jury [sic] Morris\nto be credible.‖ (Id. at p. 1246 & fn. 3.)\n       The Eleventh Circuit rejected this approach. In addition to finding that the\ntrial court erred in relying on the prosecutor‘s declaration because the defendant\nhad no opportunity to rebut it, the appellate court disapproved of the trial court‘s\n―reli[ance] . . . on non-record evidence which Mr. Adkins did not have an\nopportunity to rebut, such as the trial court‘s personal experience with and opinion\nabout the reputation of the prosecutor.‖ (Adkins, supra, 710 F.3d at p. 1254.)\n―[T]here was no evidence presented during the Batson hearing about the\nprosecutor‘s reputation, other than assertions of good faith by the prosecutor.\nNeither was there evidence of the prosecutor‘s use of peremptory strikes against\nblacks in other criminal proceedings. It was therefore not reasonable for the trial\ncourt to interject non-record facts into its Batson analysis. Importantly, as with the\nprosecutor‘s affidavit itself, Mr. Adkins did not have notice or an opportunity to\nbe heard on these matters.‖ (Id. at p. 1254, fn. 11.)\n       The Seventh Circuit has similarly rejected a trial court‘s reliance on such\npersonal knowledge. (See Coulter v. McCann (7th Cir. 2007) 484 F.3d 459, 465\n[―The Miller-El [v. Dretke, supra, 545 U.S. 231] Court also had before it evidence\nthat the local prosecutor‘s office had used a particular process to manipulate the\nracial composition of the jury in the past. [Citation.] This is different, we note,\nfrom a judge‘s personal testimonial to the character of the state‘s attorney in a\nparticular case, which seems to be what happened here. At no point in Batson,\nMiller-El [v. Cockrell (2003) 537 U.S. 322], or Miller-El [v. Dretke] did the Court\nendorse anything like this. We realize that judges need to make credibility\n\n                                             3\n\fdeterminations, but it is very troubling to base such decisions on personal\nrelationships outside of the courtroom.‖].)\n        Winbush does not question our precedent on the two points above, and they\ndo not figure into our reasoning in this case. I therefore join today‘s opinion, with\nopenness to reconsidering these aspects of our Batson jurisprudence in a future\ncase.\n\n\n                                                  LIU, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fSee next page for addresses and telephone numbers for counsel who argued in Supreme Court.\n\nName of Opinion People v.

The victim was beaten, stabbed, and ultimately strangled to death while\nher boyfriend was out Christmas shopping. The jury convicted defendant of\nmurder in the course of a robbery, with personal use of a deadly weapon.1 It fixed\nthe penalty at death. We affirm.\n                                I. BACKGROUND\nA.      Guilt Phase\n        1.      Events Before the Murder\n        In December 1995, 20-year-old Erika Beeson lived with 21-year-old Mario\nBotello in an Oakland apartment. The building had a security gate, and visitors\nhad to be ―buzzed in‖ to enter. Botello sold small amounts of marijuana, mostly to\n\n\n1     Penal Code sections 187, 190.2, subdivision (a)(17)(A), and former section\n12022, subdivision (b). All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless\notherwise stated.\n\n\n                          SEE CONCURRING OPINION\n\fpeople he knew. He grew up in South Berkeley and had been childhood friends\nwith Norman Patterson. He was 14 when he first met defendant.\n       Defendant was arrested at age 14 for driving a stolen car and spent the next\nfour years in custody at the California Youth Authority (CYA).2 On December\n12, 1995, at the age of 19, he was released on parole subject to electronic\nmonitoring. Defendant soon began contacting friends, including Patterson. By\nthat time, Patterson‘s sister had married defendant‘s brother.\n       During the weeks before defendant‘s release, Patterson and Botello had\nspent time together. On December 20, about a week after defendant came home,\nPatterson took defendant to visit Botello‘s apartment. Botello, Patterson, and\ndefendant spent the visit talking and smoking marijuana. Beeson was home but\ndid not join the conversation. At one point, defendant noticed a shotgun in the\nroom. He asked if Botello could get him a gun, explaining he wanted to rob some\ndrug dealers. The conversation made Botello uncomfortable. He did not want to\nhelp defendant, who was acting aggressively. Botello gave defendant $40 and\ntalked about helping him find a job, but defendant did not appear grateful.\nDefendant and Patterson left after about an hour.\n       During the next two days, defendant called Botello five or six times asking\nfor help obtaining a large-caliber gun. Defendant said he wanted to rob some drug\ndealers in Hayward and asked if Botello knew others he could rob. In one\nconversation, defendant asked if Botello loved his girlfriend. Botello thought the\nquestion was odd but did not consider it a threat. He tried to put defendant off\npolitely, hoping he would drop the subject of guns. Nevertheless, defendant\ninsisted Botello find him a firearm by the end of the week.\n       December 22 was the day of the murder. Around noon or 1:00 p.m., Maceo\nSmith brought defendant to the house he shared with his girlfriend, Iva Mosely.\n\n\n2      CYA is now the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, Division of\nJuvenile Facilities. (Welf. & Inst. Code, § 1000.)\n\n\n                                         2\n\fSmith had long known defendant but had not seen him in four years. Among other\nthings, the two men discussed committing a robbery together later that night.\nThey called Botello to ask about the gun and announced they would be at his\napartment in about 20 minutes. Botello and Smith were close friends. Botello left\nhome immediately, however, to avoid encountering defendant. He asked Beeson\nto say he would be back later.\n        After defendant and Smith left, Mosely called Beeson to warn her they\nwere coming. The women were friends and had shared their view that defendant\nwas ―weird.‖ Beeson was still speaking with Mosely when defendant and Smith\narrived, around 3:00 p.m. They climbed over the security gate and knocked on the\napartment door. Beeson opened the door a crack and told them Botello was not\nhome.\n        Defendant was angry that Botello had left and suggested robbing Botello.\nSmith refused to participate. Later that evening, defendant called Smith\nrepeatedly. Smith avoided the calls. He and Mosely went to a movie, returning\nhome shortly after 9:00 p.m.\n        Various witnesses established the following timeline. Around 3:45 p.m.,\nBotello went Christmas shopping with his friend Grace Sumisaki. He called\nBeeson between 5:00 and 6:00 p.m. Beeson also spoke to her mother around 6:00\np.m. Two other friends stopped by the apartment in the same time frame. Another\nfriend tried calling Beeson around 8:00 or 9:00 that evening, but the line was busy.\n        Botello‘s uncle, Andrew Williams, called around 7:35 p.m. and spoke\nbriefly to Beeson. Williams arrived at Beeson and Botello‘s apartment between\n7:45 and 8:00 p.m. Another young man was ringing the security buzzer, but he\nsoon left. Williams rang the buzzer for about 10 minutes. No one answered. He\nthen went to a friend‘s house and called the apartment about 10 times between\n8:15 and 9:15 p.m. Each time, the line was busy.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f       2.     The Murder\n       Around 8:00 p.m., defendant and Patterson went to Botello‘s apartment,\nintending to rob him. Beeson buzzed them through the security gate and met them\nat the apartment door. Patterson said he wanted to buy some marijuana. Beeson\nhesitated when she saw defendant but then let them both inside.\n       Defendant told Patterson to put the couple‘s puppies in a bedroom.\nPatterson returned with Botello‘s shotgun and picked up some containers of\nmarijuana lying nearby. Defendant searched the bedroom and took $300.\nDefendant became irritated because Beeson did not seem to be taking the robbery\nseriously. He removed his belt and forced Beeson to the floor. Both he and\nPatterson choked her. Beeson struggled throughout but remained conscious.\nAfter a few minutes, at defendant‘s direction, Patterson brought him a butcher\nknife from the kitchen. Defendant stabbed Beeson repeatedly in the face,\nshoulder, and neck. He and Patterson left immediately afterward. Defendant took\nthe knife with him. Patterson drove to Aquatic Park in Berkeley, where defendant\nthrew the knife in the lagoon.\n       Defendant and Patterson picked up Smith shortly after he returned home\nfrom the movies. The trio went out drinking. Smith noticed defendant now had\nmoney to spend.\n       3.     Investigation\n              a.     Discovery of the Crime Scene\n       Knowing her boyfriend would be out, Beeson invited two friends to come\nover. Jennifer Onweller called around 8:00 p.m. to tell Beeson that she and Amy\nKekki were on their way. The line was busy, which worried Onweller because she\nknew Beeson had call waiting. After several tries, Onweller called the operator\nand confirmed the phone was off the hook.\n       Onweller and Kekki arrived at Beeson‘s apartment around 9:30 p.m. and\nfound the security gate propped open. The apartment door was locked, and no one\nresponded when they knocked. The lights and television were on, but the\n\n\n                                        4\n\ftelevision was tuned to a sports channel, which was unusual for Beeson. The\nbedroom door was shut, and they could not see Beeson or the dogs inside.\nOnweller and Kekki then walked around the corner to a park to see if Beeson had\ntaken her dogs for a walk. Unsuccessful, they returned to the apartment, and\nOnweller began writing a note. As she did so, Botello arrived. He found the door\nlocked and could hear the dogs barking. Not having a key with him, he removed a\nscreen and opened a window to enter.\n       The apartment had been ransacked. Beeson lay on the living room floor,\ncovered in blood. She was not breathing. A wadded-up strip of masking tape and\npieces of a gold rope necklace lay on the floor near her. The robbers had left a roll\nof masking tape nearby on the floor. Onweller found the telephone, which had\nbeen knocked off the hook, and called 911. Botello spoke with the dispatcher.\nSounding ―frantic‖ and ―terrified,‖ Botello insisted an ambulance be sent\nimmediately. Police and an ambulance arrived, but Beeson had expired.\n       An autopsy revealed Beeson died from ―[a]sphyxiation due to strangulation\nand multiple stab wounds.‖ She had multiple scrapes and bruises on her arms,\nlegs, back, and face, including a bruise on her nose matching the size and shape of\nBotello‘s shotgun barrel. A ligature mark circling her neck could have been made\nby a belt. She also had nine stab wounds on her face and neck.\n              b.     Investigation and Arrests\n       Botello‘s shotgun, some marijuana, a piece of stereo equipment, and $300\nin cash had been stolen. Botello told police he suspected defendant, Smith, and\nPatterson were responsible.\n       On December 26, the police discovered that defendant‘s electronic\nmonitoring ankle bracelet had been disabled from 7:04 p.m. on the night of the\nmurder through Christmas Day. They conducted a brief parole search and\nadjusted defendant‘s bracelet but were not ready to question him about Beeson‘s\nmurder. They did question Smith, however. Smith gave them an unusually\nprecise, ―minute-by-minute‖ alibi for the night of the murder. As the investigation\n\n\n                                          5\n\fcontinued, a number of witnesses reported that defendant was bragging about the\nmurder.\n       On April 4, 1996, defendant and an accomplice were arrested for robbing a\ngas station. Defendant initially gave the police two false names. Questioned\nabout the murder, defendant admitted he had met Beeson twice at Botello‘s\napartment but denied ever speaking with her. About a week after this interview,\ndefendant pled guilty to the gas station robbery and remained in custody.\n       While defendant was in jail, Julia P. called the police anonymously to\nreport that she had heard defendant telling his cousin about the murder. Julia\nknew defendant‘s cousin, Lakeisha Lovely, and Patterson‘s girlfriend, Latonya\nWilson. According to the caller, defendant said he had broken off his ankle\nbracelet, then robbed and killed a young Caucasian girl in her home. When Julia\nheard ―Mario‘s girlfriend‖ had been stabbed, she was confused about why\ndefendant would have stabbed her since ―he always [had] guns on him‖ now.\n       On the evening of April 30, 1996, Patterson robbed a gas station and was\narrested early the next morning. On the ride to the police station, he asked the\nofficer sitting next to him, ―You all didn‘t come get me about a murder?‖ The\nofficer responded, ―Not unless you want to talk to me about one.‖ They both\nlaughed, and Patterson said, ―Naw, I don‘t think so.‖ In a search of Patterson‘s\nhome, police recovered the shotgun and stereo equipment stolen from Botello‘s\napartment.\n              c.     Confessions of Defendant and Patterson\n       At the police station, Patterson waived his Miranda3 rights and eventually\nconfessed to the robbery. Because the shotgun was found at his home, the police\nthen took him to the homicide division. Patterson first claimed he had bought the\nshotgun from a ―dope fiend‖ he knew as Gichi Dan. When questioned specifically\n\n\n\n3      Miranda v. Arizona (1966) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miranda).\n\n\n                                         6\n\fabout the Beeson murder several hours later, however, Patterson admitted his\ninvolvement.\n       Patterson told the police that defendant needed money and wanted to rob\nBotello. Patterson kept making excuses, but defendant bullied him into going\nalong. After Beeson let them into the apartment, Patterson put the dogs in a back\nroom. When he returned to the living room, defendant was on top of Beeson,\nchoking her with his belt. Defendant continued to struggle with Beeson and\nordered him to retrieve the shotgun and marijuana. At one point, defendant hit\nBeeson in the head with the shotgun barrel. Patterson initially said that defendant\ntook a butcher knife from the kitchen but later admitted that he had retrieved the\nweapon. Patterson described how defendant assaulted Beeson but denied ever\nstabbing her himself. Afterward, defendant took the knife and told Patterson to\ndrive him to Aquatic Park. There, defendant left the car and returned without the\nknife. Defendant wanted Patterson to keep the shotgun at his house because he\nfeared a parole search of his own home. They drove to Maceo Smith‘s house, and\ndefendant told Patterson not to worry because they would have an alibi. Patterson\nlater heard that defendant was bragging about the killing.\n       Shortly after Patterson‘s statement, officers interviewed defendant.\nDefendant waived his Miranda rights and initially denied any involvement. He\nwas confident and self-assured during the questioning. However, after police told\nhim they had evidence against him, showed him pictures of Patterson in custody,\nand played the first five minutes of Patterson‘s taped confession, defendant\nadmitted the crimes.4 The police secretly recorded his initial statements, and\ndefendant later gave a formal taped confession. He also admitted the murder in a\nrecorded phone call to his mother.\n\n\n\n4       The circumstances and content of defendant‘s interview are discussed in\ndetail in connection with his claim that the statements were coerced. (See\nDiscussion, pt. A.3, post, at pp. 44-48.)\n\n\n                                         7\n\f              d.      Other Events Before Trial\n       About two weeks later, acting on an anonymous tip, the police interviewed\ncounty jail inmate Tyrone Freeman. Freeman had shared a holding cell with\ndefendant on May 8, 1996. Defendant told Freeman that he was in jail on a\nmurder charge and ―might have partially confessed.‖ He said he and his brother-\nin-law ―Nate‖ were committing a robbery but the girl was not cooperating. After\nsending ―Nate‖ to search the house, defendant said he pistol-whipped the girl,\nchoked her with his belt, and finally stabbed her with a knife he saw lying on the\ncounter. Defendant said he planned to blame the whole crime on ―Nate.‖ He\nwould explain that he was tired when he talked to the police and did not remember\nconfessing.\n       Patterson was released on bail in July 1997. A little over a year later, in\nSeptember 1998, Patterson called Julia P. and asked her to come out and smoke\nmarijuana. He said nothing about Julia‘s anonymous phone call to the police, and\nshe did not think he was aware of it. They drove to a park and Patterson asked,\n―Was that you on that tape?‖ Scared, Julia denied making the call. Patterson then\ndemanded that Julia have oral sex and punched her in the face when she refused.\nHe beat her severely, knocking out two teeth, breaking her nose, and causing her\neyes to swell shut. He also choked her, saying ―[t]hat was you on that tape,‖ and\nthreatening to kill her. He said, ―I‘m going to do you just like we did that bitch.‖\nThe assault ended when witnesses heard Julia screaming. In 1999, Patterson was\nconvicted of several charges arising from the incident.\n       4.     Trial\n       Defendant and Patterson were tried together for murder with special\ncircumstance allegations. Emphasizing that no physical evidence linked them to\nthe murder, the defense argued the prosecution‘s case was based entirely on street\nrumors and coerced confessions.\n       Defendant testified, denying any involvement. He admitted he and Smith\nwent to Botello‘s apartment the afternoon of the murder but denied going back\n\n\n                                          8\n\flater. Defendant testified he left his grandmother‘s house around 7:00 p.m. and\ntook a bus to his aunt‘s home in South Berkeley. Around 10:00 p.m., he and\nPatterson drank and smoked marijuana with Smith and another friend. Defendant\nclaimed the police had coerced his confession. They threatened him with the\ndeath penalty, said they had his fingerprints on Botello‘s shotgun, and played him\nthe entire recording of Patterson‘s statement. Defendant said he confessed\nbecause the officers told him it would help him avoid the death penalty. He\nobtained details of the crime from Patterson‘s statement and things the officers\ntold him. Defendant explained that he lied on the phone call to his mother because\nthe officers were standing nearby and he wanted to keep his deal to avoid the\ndeath penalty.\n       Codefendant Patterson also testified that he had nothing to do with\nBeeson‘s killing. He said he did not visit Botello‘s apartment on the night of the\nmurder and did not see defendant until 10:15 or 10:30 p.m. Patterson claimed he\ngave a false confession because police officers had assaulted him and threatened\nthe death penalty.\n       Defendant‘s aunt testified that defendant sometimes visited her home, but\nshe could not recall the specific date or time of any visit. Botello‘s landlord\ntestified that he saw a lot of traffic in and out of the apartment and suspected drug\nactivity.\n       The jury returned guilty verdicts against both defendants on all charges and\nfound the special circumstance allegations true.\nB.     Penalty Phase\n       1.     Prosecution Evidence\n       The prosecution presented victim impact testimony from Beeson‘s mother\nand sister.5 Melitta Beeson shared memories of her daughter and described her\n\n5       Because defendant challenges the admission of victim impact evidence, this\nevidence will be described in greater detail in connection with his claims. (See\npost, at pp. 65-67.)\n\n\n                                          9\n\fclose relationship with her father. Fred Beeson was ―totally devastated‖ by the\nmurder and died six months later. Lisa Beeson testified about her sister‘s\nmemorial service and the family‘s difficulty coping with the murder. She also\ndescribed her ritual of bringing flowers to the graves of her father and sister.\n       The prosecution offered evidence under section 190.3, factor (b) (factor (b))\nof other instances in which defendant committed or threatened violence. Seven\nincidents predated the murder. They involved physical and sexual assaults on\nother youths and altercations with police and CYA staff members. These\nincidents are discussed in detail in connection with defendant‘s claim that the\ncourt erred in admitting acts he committed as a juvenile. (See post, at pp. 74-75.)\nFour incidents occurred between defendant‘s release from CYA in December 1995\nand his robbery arrest in April 1996. The prosecution also presented evidence that\ndefendant sexually assaulted Julia P. three times. Details about these incidents are\ndiscussed in connection with defendant‘s claims of error relating to her testimony.\n(See post, at pp. 69-74.) In addition, the gas station clerk who was robbed testified\nthat defendant and his accomplice wore ski masks and threatened to shoot if she\ndid not cooperate.\n       The prosecution also presented factor (b) evidence about several jail\nincidents. Twice while awaiting trial, defendant attacked a fellow inmate. On\nFebruary 6, 1998, defendant slipped out of his restraints and charged an inmate\nboarding a prison bus. After a deputy forced defendant to back away, defendant\ntold the inmate, ―That is what you get for calling me PC.‖6 Another time,\ndefendant charged an inmate being escorted back to his cell. Defendant punched\nthe inmate, wrestling him and two deputies to the floor. The inmate did not\nprovoke the attack. He was in waist chains and ―virtually defenseless‖ when\n\n\n\n\n6     ―PC‖ is a derogatory term referring to the classification for pedophiles,\ninformants, and prisoners with low status.\n\n\n                                          10\n\fdefendant charged him. Defendant defied commands to stop and continued the\nbeating until subdued.\n       Defendant also attacked prison guards on several occasions. For example,7\non March 1, 1997, defendant was in the shower during a lockdown and given two\nminutes to finish. After the water was turned off, he complained he needed more\ntime and angrily refused to comply with the lockdown. When a deputy tried to\ntake him to an isolation cell, defendant punched the deputy two or three times in\nthe face, breaking his nose. On another occasion, defendant refused to cooperate\nwith procedures for a security check. He punched a deputy in the face, breaking\nhis glasses.\n       2.      Defense Evidence\n       A defense investigator testified about interviews with two prisoners who\nsaw defendant‘s altercation with the deputy in the showers. Both said the deputy\nstruck first. Although defendant was shivering, the deputy threatened to send him\nto the ―cold room,‖ then began hitting him and spraying him with pepper spray.\nThe prisoners said defendant was not combative but was simply asking to rinse\noff.\n       In addition, the defense offered expert testimony from Jamie Candelaria-\nGreene, Ph.D., that defendant suffered from learning disabilities and attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). On cross-examination, she conceded\ndefendant had been diagnosed with a conduct disorder and met the diagnostic\ncriteria for antisocial personality disorder.\n       The jury sentenced Patterson to life imprisonment without possibility of\nparole but sentenced defendant to death. Defendant‘s appeal is automatic.\n(§ 1239, subdivision (b).)\n\n\n\n7       Additional incidents will be discussed in connection with defendant‘s claim\nthat the court erred in admitting evidence of misconduct not involving actual or\nthreatened violence.

Pitchess Rulings\n       The trial court ruled on several motions filed pursuant to Pitchess v.\nSuperior Court (1974) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1246483\"><a href=\"/opinion/1246483/pitchess-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n       Defendant sought to discover any complaints against Sergeants Olivas and\nMcKenna for incidents of aggression, use of excessive force, dishonesty, or\nimproper interrogation tactics. Based on defendant‘s showing, the court reviewed\nthe records for promises of leniency or other improper interrogation tactics. It\nfound no discoverable information. The court also reviewed Oakland Police\nDepartment personnel files in response to Patterson‘s Pitchess motion and found\nno discoverable information about inappropriate interview tactics. The defense\nreceived the officers‘ training records but no additional discovery through Pitchess\nproceedings.\n       Defendant also sought Pitchess discovery on four CYA officers and seven\nAlameda County Sheriff‘s deputies. After litigation over the required foundation,\nthe court reviewed all but two of the files.8 The court ordered release of nearly all\nof the CYA files, subject to a limited protective order. It also ordered discovery of\nsome sheriff‘s department records, including the dates of incidents and names and\naddresses of individuals involved.\n       When a defendant shows good cause for the discovery of information in an\nofficer‘s personnel records, the trial court must examine the records in camera to\ndetermine if any information should be disclosed. (Evid. Code, § 1045; People v.\nMooc (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621789\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621789/people-v-mooc/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1226.) The court may not disclose complaints over\nfive years old, conclusions drawn during an investigation, or facts so remote or\nirrelevant that their disclosure would be of little benefit. (Evid. Code, § 1045,\n\n\n8      The court found insufficient cause to review the records of two sheriff‘s\ndeputies. Defendant has not challenged this ruling on appeal.\n\n\n                                         12\n\fsubd. (b); Mooc, at pp. 1226-1227, 1232.) Pitchess rulings are reviewed for abuse\nof discretion. (People v.

The trial court made a detailed record of all the\nmaterials it found discoverable. Our review confirms that all discoverable\nmaterials were properly released. There was no Pitchess error.\n       2.     Jury Selection Issues\n              a.      Cause Challenge Rulings\n       Defendant contends the court erred in denying two of his challenges for\ncause and in granting one prosecution challenge without adequate voir dire. Each\nchallenge involved the panelist‘s personal views on the death penalty.\n       A cause challenge lies only if a panelist‘s death penalty views ―would\n‗ ―prevent or substantially impair‖ ‘ the performance of the juror‘s duties as\ndefined by the court‘s instructions and the juror‘s oath.‖ (People v. Cunningham\n(2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">926</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 975; see Wainwright v.

[Citations.]‖ (People v. Holt (1997)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 651.) Defendant‘s first two claims were not preserved for appeal.\nThe record amply supports the court‘s ruling on the third.\n                      i.     Denial of Defense Challenges\n       Defendant unsuccessfully challenged two prospective jurors for cause. He\nargued Prospective Juror E.T. was not qualified to serve because voir dire\nresponses indicated he would vote for the death penalty in any case involving an\nintentional killing during a robbery. Defendant raised a different challenge to\nProspective Juror G.M. He maintained G.M. could not be fair because, as a young\n\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\fWhite woman similar in appearance to Beeson, she would identify too closely\nwith the murder victim. The court denied both challenges.\n       Weeks later, voir dire concluded and actual selection began. Prospective\nJuror E.T. was seated early in the process. Neither side exercised a peremptory\nchallenge, and he served as Juror No. 12. Several panelists cycled through the\nNo. 9 seat. Eventually, Prospective Juror G.M. was seated in this position.\nImmediately afterward, the prosecution and defense declined to exercise any\nfurther peremptory challenges. Patterson‘s attorney declared, ―The defense is very\nsatisfied with the jury.‖ As a result, Prospective Juror G.M. served as Juror No. 9.\n       Defendant now complains the court erred in denying his cause challenges\nto Juror Nos. 9 and 12. To preserve such a claim, a defendant must exercise a\nperemptory challenge and remove the prospective juror in question, exhaust all\navailable peremptory challenges, and express ―dissatisfaction with the jury as\npresently constituted.‖ (People v. Mills (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186.) None of\nthese requirements was satisfied.\n       Defendant did not peremptorily challenge either Juror No. 9 or No. 12, nor\ndid he exhaust his challenges. Counsel for defendant and Patterson were given 30\nchallenges to exercise jointly in selecting the 12 trial jurors. When counsel\naccepted the jury panel as constituted, the defense had 25 challenges remaining.\nIndeed, the defense ―passed,‖ indicating its satisfaction with the panel, four times\nafter Prospective Juror E.T. was seated. Finally, rather than expressing\ndissatisfaction, counsel assured the court the defense was ―very satisfied‖ with the\npanel chosen.9 The court confirmed this satisfaction was shared by both\ndefendants, and confirmed again, during an in-chambers discussion, that all parties\nagreed the 12 jurors currently sitting would serve as the trial jury.\n\n\n9      Although it was Patterson‘s attorney who expressed this satisfaction, the\ndefendants agreed to make joint decisions about peremptory challenges and jury\nselection. The court was initially reluctant to proceed in this fashion but was\npersuaded to do so by defendant‘s counsel.\n\n\n                                          14\n\f       These facts establish forfeiture. When defendant accepted the jury, he had\nsufficient challenges remaining to repopulate the panel twice over yet declined to\nexcuse E.T. or G.M. Using additional challenges would not have depleted the\nvenire. Such a large pool of qualified jurors remained after the panel was selected\nthat the court decided to seat six alternate jurors and allowed 12 peremptory\nchallenges per side in their selection. Counsel was well aware this decision would\nforfeit defendant‘s ability to dispute the rulings on appeal.10\n       Relying on United States v. Martinez-Salazar (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118333\"><a href=\"/opinion/118333/united-states-v-martinez-salazar/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">304</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\ndefendant contends his claim is preserved. He argues Martinez-Salazar allows\ncriminal defendants to risk leaving a biased individual on the jury then bring a\nSixth Amendment challenge on appeal. Defendant misreads the case. In\nMartinez-Salazar, the high court was interpreting federal law, specifically rule 24\nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (18 U.S.C.), when it concluded a\ndefendant need not excuse a prospective juror in order to preserve a claim of error\nin the denial of a cause challenge. (Martinez-Salazar, at pp. 314-315; see People\nv. Hillhouse (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599164\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599164/people-v-hillhouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487.) That rule is not binding on the states.\n(See Martinez–Salazar, at pp. 313-314.) Indeed, the high court has held there is\n―nothing arbitrary or irrational‖ about a state law requirement that the defendant\nuse peremptory challenges to cure a trial court‘s assertedly erroneous refusals to\ndismiss jurors for cause. (Ross v. Oklahoma (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112119\"><a href=\"/opinion/112119/ross-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 90.) Such a\nrequirement reasonably ―subordinates the absolute freedom to use a peremptory\nchallenge as one wishes to the goal of empaneling an impartial jury.‖ (Ibid.)\n       Accordingly, defendant‘s claims are not cognizable on appeal. (People v.\nThomas (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935; People v. Hillhouse, supra, 27 Cal.4th at\n\n\n10     Before jury selection, Patterson‘s attorney sought a ruling that all cause\nchallenges would be deemed cognizable on appeal, even if the defense did not\nexhaust its peremptory challenges. The court denied the motion, noting such a\nruling would be contrary to precedent of this court and the United States Supreme\nCourt.\n\n\n                                          15\n\fp. 487; People v. Williams (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667.) We decline defendant‘s\ninvitation to revisit these rules or find his failure to satisfy them was justified.\n(See Thomas, at p. 935.) Defendant‘s attempt to derive an alternative standard of\nforfeiture from People v. Yeoman (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and People v.

In those cases, the defendant used a\nperemptory challenge to excuse the objectionable juror and exhausted all\nchallenges. (Yeoman, at p. 114; Boyette, at p. 416.) Defendant failed to do either.\n                      ii.    Excusal of Prospective Juror E.I.\n       Next, defendant claims the court erred in excusing Prospective Juror E.I.,\nboth because voir dire was inadequate and because her views on the death penalty\nwould not have substantially impaired her ability to serve.\n       E.I.‘s questionnaire responses indicated she was ―[m]oderately in favor‖ of\nthe death penalty. She explained, ―it is acceptable punishment for certain crimes\nbut,‖ because of the ―heavy responsibility‖ in imposing it, the defendant ―had\nbetter be guilty and the jury had better be sure.‖ She said she had been opposed to\ncapital punishment in college but ―became for it again‖ after learning about some\nhorrific crimes. She agreed that California should have a death penalty because\n―[s]ome crimes are so serious that there are no second chances for the person who\ncommitted them. Why spend huge amounts of money on imprisoning these\npeople.‖ Asked whether she would always vote for death if the victim was\nintentionally killed for the purpose of a robbery by defendants with substantial\ncriminal histories, E.I. responded that an ―intentional‖ killing warranted the death\npenalty but she did not agree it was ―always‖ appropriate.\n       In voir dire, when asked if she could realistically consider both sentencing\noptions, E.I. stated that, while both were possible, ―it would have to be really,\nreally aggravating circumstances for me to choose the death penalty over life in\nprison, because that is the most serious thing you can do.‖ When the court probed\nfurther, E.I. said she probably would have voted for the death penalty in notorious\ncases involving serial murder or ―incredibly violent‖ murders like decapitation.\n\n\n                                           16\n\fThe court responded with a general description of the facts here: ―In this case the\nallegation is one person has been killed. There aren‘t a number of victims like the\nYosemite case or Ted Bundy. One victim. [¶] There was no mutilation involved,\nsuch as cutting the head off of the victim, things of this nature. That did not occur.\n[¶] There was no sexual assault involved in the commission of the murder.‖ Given\nthese features of the case, the court asked whether the death penalty would be a\nrealistic sentencing option for E.I. She responded, ―It doesn‘t seem to be the kind\nof case where I would vote for the death penalty.‖ The court indicated it was\ninclined to excuse the juror but allowed the attorneys to question her first.\n       The prosecutor added that the victim had been ―involved in marijuana\ndealing‖ and described the murder as a kind of ―drug deal gone bad,‖ after which\nthe victim was strangled, stabbed and robbed. E.I. responded that she had not\nheard anything about the case to make the death penalty a possible sentencing\noption. She noted, ―I would have to hear something really different to make the\npeople so incredibly dangerous and deranged that it would have to be death as\nopposed to life in prison.‖ The murder of a single victim would have to be\nextremely violent for her to vote for the death penalty. In an effort to rehabilitate\nthe juror, Patterson‘s attorney gave her more details about the case: The victim\nwas a 20-year-old woman, and two men entered her apartment with the intention\nof robbing her. They did rob her, and also ―stabbed her repeatedly‖ and ―[c]hoked\nher with a belt and killed her.‖ He stressed, ―There is no question that it was an\nintentional murder.‖ E.I. said she would not automatically find the death penalty\nappropriate for an intentional killing, nor would she automatically vote for life\nimprisonment without parole in all cases not involving serial murder. She stated,\n―I do believe in the death penalty in most cases, but for the most part, life in prison\nwill handle it.‖ When asked about hypothetical cases, E.I. stated, ―I can‘t say that\nI absolutely wouldn‘t, wouldn‘t vote for the death penalty. But, you know, I—it\nwould definitely have to really be some reason for me to do that.‖\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\f       After a brief chambers conference, defendant‘s attorney examined E.I. He\nexplained in some detail that penalty would be decided after a second trial in\nwhich the parties presented aggravating and mitigating evidence. Following this\nlengthy explanation, counsel said, ―All I‘m asking you, [is] would you wait and\nlisten to the evidence in the second phase, and can you conceive that depending on\nwhat the aggravation is that you might return a verdict of death?‖ E.I. responded,\n―I don‘t want to send anybody to death.‖ Counsel asked if she was saying she\nwould not vote for death. She said, ―I‘m beginning to think more and more—as\nI‘m more and more on the spot, I don‘t want to live with my conscience.‖ When\ncounsel asked again, ―Are you telling me that you would not want to return a\nverdict of death,‖ E.I. answered, ―No.‖\n       The court dismissed E.I. for cause, remarking it had formed a ―definite\nimpression‖ from the courtroom voir dire that E.I.‘s views on capital punishment\nwould substantially impair her ability to serve. E.I. clearly described the types of\ncases in which she would consider voting for death, i.e., those involving multiple\nkillings or mutilation, circumstances not present in this case. Moreover, it\nappeared that, over the course of her questioning, E.I.‘s views had become\n―crystalized that she could never return a verdict of death.‖\n       ―A prospective juror may be excluded for cause without compromising a\ndefendant‘s right to trial by an impartial jury if the juror‘s views on capital\npunishment ‗would ―prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties\nas a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.‖ ‘ (Wainwright v.

[Citations.]‖ (People v.

Defendant complains the court ignored questionnaire responses\nshowing support for the death penalty in favor of E.I.‘s ambiguous statements in\nvoir dire that did not clearly show she was unqualified to serve. Defendant\nmischaracterizes the record and misconstrues our standard of review.\n       Even if a prospective juror‘s questionnaire responses express a willingness\nto consider the death penalty, an excusal for cause is appropriate if oral\nquestioning establishes that the juror‘s views on capital punishment would, in fact,\nsubstantially impair her ability to return a death sentence. (See, e.g., People v.\nVirgil, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 1244.) Here, E.I.‘s questionnaire responses showed\nmoderate support for capital punishment, noting it was appropriate for ―some\ncrimes.‖ However, she clarified her beliefs during voir dire, consistently\nexpressing the view that only the most violent kinds of killings warrant death.\nDefendant characterizes these responses as ambiguous because E.I. left room for\n\n\n12     Defendant argues this deference is inconsistent with Gray v.

However, in each instance, she\nemphasized that the murder would have to be particularly brutal. ― ‗The real\nquestion is ― ‗ ―whether the juror‘s views about capital punishment would prevent\nor impair the juror‘s ability to return a verdict of death in the case before the\njuror.‖ ‘ ‖ ‘ [Citations.]‖ (People v.

Yet, two defense lawyers\nexpanded on those descriptions and on the process for determining penalty.\nPatterson‘s attorney stressed that the victim was only 20 years old and was killed\nin her own apartment by two men who intended to rob her. They choked and\nstabbed her repeatedly in what he stressed was unquestionably an intentional\nkilling. With that preface, he asked whether such a murder could be sufficient to\nsupport a death verdict. Once again, E.I. hedged in responding, stating only that\nan intentional killing would ―sort of ma[ke] that more of a possibility,‖ but\nconsistently emphasized that she would be able to vote for death only in extreme\ncases.\n         We determined similar views supported a removal for cause in a previous\ndeath penalty case involving the same trial judge. (People v. Martinez (2009) 47\nCal.4th 399.)13 In Martinez, a prospective juror stated that a crime would have to\nbe ― ‗particularly heinous‘ ‖ or involve other circumstances like recidivism to\nwarrant the death penalty. (Id. at p. 428.) The prospective juror in Martinez\nconceded there was a possibility she could vote for death, depending on the facts,\nbut ― ‗it would have to be something that would push me beyond the way I\nnormally feel about the death penalty.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 429.) We concluded these\n\n13    We repeatedly commented on the careful and thoughtful voir dire Judge\nHorner conducted in Martinez. (People v. Martinez, supra, 47 Cal.4th at pp. 433,\n437.) The thoroughness of his voir dire in this case is similarly commendable.\n\n\n                                          20\n\fstatements reserving the possibility of a death verdict did not necessarily mean the\njuror was qualified: ―The trial court was justified in concluding that the\nprospective juror‘s responses, rather than suggesting she could set aside her own\npersonal views, constituted merely a grudging acknowledgment that those views\nmight include some narrow exception—or at least an abstract possibility she\nwould consider the statutory penalty of death. But the mere theoretical possibility\nthat a prospective juror might be able to reach a verdict of death in some case does\nnot necessarily render the dismissal of the juror an abuse of discretion.\n[Citations.] Excusal for cause is not limited to a juror who ‗ ―zealously opposes or\nsupports the death penalty in every case.‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖ (Id. at p. 432.) Echoing\nthe dissent in Martinez, defendant argues the dismissal was improper because E.I.\nwas not asked whether serial killings and murders involving mutilation were the\nonly types of cases in which she could consider the death penalty. (See id. at\np. 461 (conc. & dis. opn. of Moreno, J.).) However, a court is certainly capable of\ndiscerning bias without hearing a prospective juror‘s speculation about all the\npotential circumstances that might support death. E.I. did not limit her discussion\nto serial killings or mutilations but consistently made clear that, in her view, only\nan especially violent murder could warrant punishment by death.\n       Defendant also complains the court did not allow adequate voir dire\nbecause it prevented defense counsel from telling E.I. about aggravating evidence\nthat would likely be introduced at the penalty phase. We have repeatedly\ncautioned that death-qualification voir dire ―must not be so abstract that it fails to\nidentify jurors whose death penalty views would prevent or substantially impair\ntheir performance as jurors‖ but also ―must not be so specific as to require\nprejudgment based on a summary of potential [aggravating and mitigating]\nevidence. (People v. Cash[, supra,] 28 Cal.4th [at pp.] 721-722.)‖ (People v.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fLeon (2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586.)14 The trial court has considerable discretion in\nstriking this balance. (Leon, at p. 586; People v. Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at\np. 722.) The ruling here was well within that ample scope. The attorneys had\nalready given E.I. a detailed preview of how and why the murder was committed.\nThe court reasonably concluded that voir dire questions describing particular\nevidence likely to be offered in aggravation would come too close to requiring E.I.\nto prejudge penalty. A defendant has no right to ask prospective jurors to predict\nhow they would decide penalty based on a summary of aggravating or mitigating\nevidence. (People v. Carasi (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2640086\"><a href=\"/opinion/2640086/people-v-carasi/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1326-1327 (Carasi); People\nv.

In any event, the aggravating evidence\nhere, which primarily consisted of violent outbursts while defendant was in\ncustody, was not nearly as shocking as Beeson‘s murder. A description of this\nevidence would not have caused a reasonable juror to change her views about the\nappropriateness of death as a penalty.\n       Moreover, E.I.‘s response to defense counsel‘s final questioning removed\nany doubt about her inability to serve. Defendant‘s attorney explained that if the\ncase reached a penalty phase, the parties would present aggravating and mitigating\nevidence about the crime and the backgrounds of the offenders and the victim. He\nthen asked whether E.I. could simply wait to hear that evidence and, if the\naggravating evidence was appropriate, consider possibly returning a verdict of\n\n\n14     In supplemental briefing, defendant argues People v. Leon supports reversal\nbecause E.I.‘s questionnaire responses indicated she could consider a death\nsentence, and she only changed her mind due to the prosecutor‘s ―misleading‖ voir\ndire. What happened here is precisely the opposite of the situation that led to\nreversal in Leon. There, three jurors‘ questionnaires stated unequivocally that they\ncould set aside their opinions about the death penalty and apply the law. (People\nv. Leon, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 590-591.) Thus, they were presumptively\nqualified to serve. (Id. at p. 592.) Because the court‘s cursory voir dire was not\nsufficient to undermine this presumption, the record did not support their dismissal\nfor cause. (Id. at pp. 592-593.) By contrast, the probing and thorough voir dire\nhere amply supports E.I.‘s dismissal.\n\n\n                                         22\n\fdeath. E.I. responded that she had thought more about the issue and realized she\ncould not live with her conscience if she sent anyone to death. She gave this\nanswer when proceedings resumed after an in-chambers conference. As the court\nobserved, E.I.‘s views had apparently ―crystalized‖ over the course of her\nquestioning and perhaps during the break.15. Her candid admission that she could\nnot vote for death under any circumstances revealed views that would ― ‗prevent\nor substantially impair‘ ‖ her ability to perform as a capital juror. (Wainwright v.\nWitt, supra, 469 U.S. at p. 424.)\n       A refinement of views often occurs during voir dire. When panel members\nare sent to a courtroom, they learn for the first time that they have been called for a\ncapital case. Then, appropriately, their opinions are probed in depth. These\nquestions touch on matters of conscience, morality, social policy, and individual\nability that panelists may never have considered in practical detail. The process\nencourages panelists to think deeply and seriously about their views. It falls to the\ndiscerning trial judge to carefully evaluate each panelist‘s state of mind on these\nweighty issues. The able trial court did so here. There was no error.\n              b.     Batson/Wheeler Rulings\n       Defendant, who is African-American, complains he was deprived of his\nconstitutional rights to equal protection and a representative jury because the\nprosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude African-Americans from\n\n\n15     For this reason, defendant‘s reliance on People v. Heard (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">946</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> and People v.

In those cases, we\ndetermined cause dismissals were not supported by substantial evidence. One\nprospective juror‘s voir dire responses ―indicated he was prepared to follow the\nlaw and had no predisposition one way or the other as to imposition of the death\npenalty.‖ (Heard, at p. 967.) A second ― ‗had no strong feelings on the death\npenalty‘ ‖ (Pearson, at p. 330) but was ― ‗positive‘ ‖ she could vote to impose it in\nan appropriate case (id. at p. 331). These views stand in sharp contrast to E.I.‘s\npredisposition to vote against death in all but the most egregious cases, and her\nultimate conclusion that her conscience would prevent her from ever voting for\ndeath.\n\n\n                                          23\n\fthe jury.

Background\n       Because defendant makes several statistical arguments, we discuss the jury\nselection procedures in some detail. The process, which the court conducted with\nmeticulous attention, lasted from the middle of November 2002 until the\nbeginning of March 2003. Twelve panels of 90 individuals each were called and\ncompleted a 41-page questionnaire. After some panelists were excused by\nstipulation or for hardship, the rest returned in small groups over several weeks for\nindividual sequestered voir dire. (See Hovey v. Superior Court (1980) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1407576\"><a href=\"/opinion/1407576/hovey-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80.) This process produced a pool of 73 qualified jurors: 49 Caucasians (67.12\npercent); 10 Asian or Pacific Islanders (13.70 percent); four African-Americans\n(5.48 percent); three mixed-race16 individuals (4.11 percent); four Hispanics (5.48\npercent); and three (4.11 percent) whose race is not reflected in the questionnaires.\n       Jurors were called into the jury box in random order for the parties to\nexercise peremptory challenges. Each side had 30 challenges, with 12 additional\nchallenges to use for the alternates. Defendant and Patterson agreed to exercise\ntheir challenges jointly. The prosecutor exercised 10 peremptory challenges in\nselecting the trial jury and eight in selecting the alternates. Three of these\nchallenges were made against African-American panelists. After each, the defense\njointly asserted a Batson/Wheeler motion. The court held a hearing and issued a\ndetailed ruling denying the motions.\n       Including alternates, the jury was composed of 11 women and seven men,\nranging in age from 24 to 61 years old. All major cities in the county were\nrepresented except Fremont, Pleasanton, and Berkeley. Thirteen of the jurors were\nCaucasian, three were Hispanic, and two were Asian.\n\n\n16    These jurors identified as Puerto Rican/Hawaiian, Asian/Hispanic, and\nCaucasian/Latino.\n\n\n                                          24\n\f                      ii.    Analysis of Individual Challenges\n       Both state and federal Constitutions prohibit the use of peremptory\nchallenges to remove prospective jurors based on their race or membership in a\ncognizable group. (Batson, supra, 476 U.S. at p. 89; Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d at\npp. 276-277.) A three-step inquiry governs the analysis of Batson/Wheeler claims.\n―First, the trial court must determine whether the defendant has made a prima facie\nshowing that the prosecutor exercised a peremptory challenge based on race.\nSecond, if the showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to demonstrate\nthat the challenges were exercised for a race-neutral reason. Third, the court\ndetermines whether the defendant has proven purposeful discrimination. The\nultimate burden of persuasion regarding racial motivation rests with, and never\nshifts from, the opponent of the strike. [Citation.]‖ (People v.

At step two of the analysis, the prosecutor ―must provide a\n‗ ―clear and reasonably specific‖ explanation of his ―legitimate reasons‖ for\nexercising the challenges.‘ [Citation.] ‗The justification need not support a\nchallenge for cause, and even a ―trivial‖ reason, if genuine and neutral, will\nsuffice.‘ [Citation.] A prospective juror may be excused based upon facial\nexpressions, gestures, hunches, and even for arbitrary or idiosyncratic reasons.‖\n(People v. Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.) However, ―race-based decisions are\nnot constitutionally tolerable.‖ (Id. at p. 621; accord, Rice v. Collins (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145690\"><a href=\"/opinion/145690/rice-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">333</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 338.)\n       The People do not dispute the trial court‘s finding that a prima facie case\nhad been established. Accordingly, we focus on the third Batson/Wheeler prong\nand examine whether the African-American panelists were excused due to\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\fintentional discrimination.

Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613, fn. 8.)\n       ―At the third stage of the Wheeler/Batson inquiry, ‗the issue comes down to\nwhether the trial court finds the prosecutor‘s race-neutral explanations to be\ncredible. Credibility can be measured by, among other factors, the prosecutor‘s\ndemeanor; by how reasonable, or how improbable, the explanations are; and by\nwhether the proffered rationale has some basis in accepted trial strategy.‘ (Miller-\nEl [v. Cockrell (2003)] 537 U.S. [322,] 339.)‖ (People v. Lenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th\nat p. 613, fn. omitted.)

This\nassessment may also take into account ―the court‘s own experiences as a lawyer\nand bench officer in the community, and even the common practices of the\nadvocate and the office that employs him or her. (See Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d\nat p. 281.)‖ (Lenix, at p. 613.)\n       ―We review a trial court‘s determination regarding the sufficiency of a\nprosecutor‘s justifications for exercising peremptory challenges ‗ ―with great\nrestraint.‖ ‘ [Citation.] We presume that a prosecutor uses peremptory challenges\nin a constitutional manner and give great deference to the trial court‘s ability to\ndistinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses.

Burgener, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 864.)\n       Here, in making its ―sincere and reasoned‖ evaluation, the court carefully\nexamined each of the prosecutor‘s explanations after independent review of the\nvoir dire transcripts and its own notes about the jurors‘ demeanor. (See People v.\nWilliams (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283-284.) The court clearly understood its duty\nto scrutinize the prosecutor‘s reasons to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham\n\n\n                                          26\n\fexcuses contrived to hide discrimination.

It issued an unusually detailed, careful ruling, referring to\nspecific portions of voir dire and citing numerous authorities. Accordingly, its\ndecision is entitled to deference and must be upheld if it is supported by\nsubstantial evidence. (People v. Lomax (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2512057\"><a href=\"/opinion/2512057/people-v-lomax/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">530</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571; People v.\nLenix, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 613.)\n                             a)     Prospective Juror E.T.\n       The prosecutor used his second peremptory challenge to excuse Prospective\nJuror E.T., a retired credit manager from Oakland married to a retired federal\nimmigration agent. She stated in the questionnaire that she had been arrested for\nobstruction of justice but did not explain her answer. During voir dire, she\nexplained that she and a police officer ―kind of got into a thing‖ when she was\nhelping her sister leave her husband. She said the officer pushed her and ―made\nsome kind of remarks.‖ She retaliated, and ―[i]t escalated from that.‖ She was\narrested but the charges were dropped.\n       In the questionnaire, E.T. described her general opinion about the death\npenalty as neutral but also stated, ―If you take a life be prepared to give up your\nlife.‖ In voir dire, she said she had ―mixed feelings‖ about capital punishment.\nShe explained that, according to the Bible, ―only God is supposed to be able to\nreally take somebody‘s life,‖ and ―[i]t‘s not our place‖ to kill someone; however,\nshe also believed people shouldn‘t be allowed to murder others.\n       The prosecutor cited these mixed feelings about the death penalty as one\nreason for striking E.T. Another reason, related to the first, was a concern that\nE.T.‘s religious beliefs would make it difficult for her to impose the death penalty.\nThe prosecutor said it raised ―a huge red flag‖ if a potential juror stated that only\nGod can take a life. He explained that, ―as a prosecutor in a death penalty case,\nevery single juror that makes [that] answer [has to be excused] either by cause or\nby peremptory challenge or I‘m not doing my job.‖ He noted no one sitting on the\njury had given such an answer.\n\n\n                                          27\n\f       The prosecutor also cited E.T.‘s attitude toward law enforcement. Before\nvoir dire, he had obtained the police report related to E.T.‘s obstruction of justice\ncharge. The report, which was provided to the defense, revealed a different kind\nof encounter than E.T. described. A uniformed police officer responded to a\nresidence to serve a felony arrest warrant on a person inside. E.T. blocked his\nentry. Even after the officer physically moved her aside, E.T. continued to place\nherself in the officer‘s way until the subject of the warrant was able to escape.\nThe prosecutor believed the incident showed E.T. was unfriendly toward law\nenforcement, and this attitude was especially problematic because the credibility\nof Oakland police officers would be a crucial issue in the case.\n       The prosecutor also observed that Patterson‘s attorney questioned E.T. only\nbriefly and defendant‘s attorney asked no questions at all. Their approach raised\nthe concern that E.T. would favor the defense.\n       The court found each of the prosecutor‘s reasons supported by the record\nand expressive of his true motives in excusing E.T. Substantial evidence supports\nthese findings. E.T. expressed mixed feelings about capital punishment. A juror‘s\nreluctance to impose the death penalty has long been considered a legitimate, race-\nneutral basis for excusal in a capital case. (E.g., People v. Lomax, supra, 49\nCal.4th at p. 572; People v. Gutierrez (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1123; People v.\nPride (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 230; People v.

The court observed that\nno other juror had expressed such a strongly held view. We have repeatedly\nupheld peremptory challenges to jurors whose reservations about the death penalty\nare religious in nature. (E.g., People v. Cash, supra, 28 Cal.4th at p. 725; People\nv.

After reading her arrest report for interfering\nwith a police officer, the court concluded E.T. had committed substantial unlawful\nconduct, which she minimized during voir dire. A juror‘s prior arrest is an\naccepted race-neutral reason for peremptory challenge. (People v. Lomax, supra,\n49 Cal.4th at p. 575.) For similar reasons, a juror‘s negative experience with law\nenforcement can also be a valid basis for exclusion. (People v. Gutierrez, supra,\n28 Cal.4th at pp. 1124-1125; see People v. Farnam (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138;\nPeople v.

Ervin (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2615557\"><a href=\"/opinion/2615557/people-v-ervin/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 75. While this reason might\nnot be sufficient in isolation to support a challenge, the absence of any significant\nquestioning by defense counsel is relevant and may legitimately support a\nprosecutor‘s feeling that the panelist would favor the defense. (See ibid.)\n                             b)     Prospective Juror B.C.\n       The prosecutor used his sixth peremptory challenge to excuse B.C., a 54-\nyear-old receptionist from Oakland. B.C. disclosed in the questionnaire that her\ndaughter had been raped two years earlier by a ―high-profile‖ person who was not\nconvicted. She favored strengthening the justice system to give victims justice. In\nvoir dire, B.C. explained that her daughter‘s rapist was a professional basketball\nplayer. The case was investigated by the Alameda Police Department but was\neventually ―dropped.‖\n       B.C. had previously served as the foreperson in a criminal case. In her\nquestionnaire, she stated that the case resulted in a verdict; however, in voir dire,\nshe reported that the jury hung on one count. They found the defendant guilty of\nattempted robbery and being a felon in possession of a firearm but could not reach\na verdict on an attempted murder charge.\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\f       B.C. also expressed the view that minorities are not treated fairly by the\njustice system, explaining that minorities were usually unable to pay for the same\nquality of legal representation available to White defendants. In voir dire, B.C.\nsaid she thought people who can afford a private attorney ―have a better chance in\ncourt‖ than those represented by a public defender, citing the O.J. Simpson case as\nan example. Patterson‘s attorney then told B.C. that in addition to retained\nlawyers and public defenders, some defendants are represented by private lawyers\nwho donate their time. The court remarked after B.C. left the courtroom that this\ncolloquy was misleading. It appeared to give the juror the impression that these\ndefense counsel were donating their time, which was not true. The court noted\nthat the problem had only arisen with B.C. but admonished counsel, ―Don‘t do that\nagain.‖\n       The prosecutor gave several reasons for striking B.C. He mentioned her\nexperience as the foreperson of a hung jury. He gave examples of other panelists\nhe had excused specifically because they had served on hung juries. B.C. was the\nforeperson of a jury that could not agree on the most difficult charge, attempted\nmurder. However, even though the jury hung on one count, B.C. found the\nexperience satisfying and nonstressful. From these answers, the prosecutor\ndeduced that, ―rather than dig in[and] work her way through to a verdict, which\nwould have been a more difficult thing to do,‖ B.C. joined with other jurors and\n―agreed to take the easy way out[,] to simply agree not to agree.‖ He noted that\njurors here would be confronted with a difficult decision if the case reached a\npenalty phase, and he did not want someone on the jury who previously ―took the\neasier way out‖ when she was leading deliberations. The prosecutor also feared\nB.C. would be elected foreperson, because of her experience in that role, ―and\nwhen she was a foreperson before, she led the jury to a hang on the difficult\ncharge.‖\n       The prosecutor also struck B.C. because of her views on the criminal justice\nsystem. She expressed concern in both the questionnaire and voir dire about the\n\n\n                                         30\n\fquality of representation received by people who could not afford private lawyers.\nAfter this discussion, Patterson‘s attorney made comments that gave B.C. the clear\nimpression that he was working on the case for free. The impression that defense\ncounsel were working for free was damaging because B.C. seemed to have a ―full-\nfledged belief that if an African-American defendant can‘t pay his lawyers in the\nway that O.J. did, [he‘s] not getting a fair shake.‖ B.C.‘s views on money in the\ncriminal justice system were highlighted by her assertion that the police or district\nattorney‘s office failed to pursue charges against the professional basketball player\nwho had raped her daughter. The prosecutor summarized: ―So here‘s a juror\nwho‘s been in this situation before as a foreperson, who was willing to take the\neasy way out of a hung jury on a difficult count, who has very strongly held views\nexpressed in her questionnaire and her oral voir dire that money gets you good\nrepresentation, and she has concerns about that in African-American context. . . .\nAnd then we have a defense attorney who stands up and misleads her, leaves her\nwith the impression that he‘s working for free along with the other lawyers here.\nThat‘s a race-neutral reason, your honor. That‘s a situation where that juror was\npoisoned.‖\n       The court found that these reasons reflected the truth of why the prosecutor\nexcused B.C. Again, the court‘s careful findings are amply supported by the\nrecord.\n       The court found B.C.‘s prior service as the foreperson of a criminal jury\nthat hung on the most serious charge justified the use of a peremptory strike. As\nthe court observed, many cases have held service on a hung jury to be an\nappropriate, race-neutral reason for excusing a juror, and this reason alone could\nhave justified the excusal of B.C. (E.g., People v.

In many of her\nanswers, B.C. expressed ―real fears‖ that an indigent defendant would suffer a\nsignificant disadvantage and only people who can pay for private lawyers will\nreceive a good defense. ―A prospective juror‘s distrust of the criminal justice\nsystem is a race-neutral basis for excusal. (People v. Turner, supra, 8 Cal.4th at\npp. 170-171.)‖ (People v. Clark (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 907; see People v. Pride,\nsupra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 230.) Further, the court believed defense counsel‘s\nstatements about private attorneys donating their time created the irrevocable\nimpression that the defense lawyers in this case were working for free. The\nprosecutor was justifiably concerned that B.C. would feel sympathy for the\ndefendants because she would believe they were not receiving adequate\nrepresentation. Finally, the court observed that B.C.‘s views on the disparity of\nrepresentation available to the wealthy were probably reinforced by the fact that\nher daughter‘s rapist, a high-profile and presumably wealthy person, avoided\nprosecution. Skepticism about the fairness of the criminal justice system to\nindigents and racial minorities has also been recognized as a valid race-neutral\nground for excusing a juror. (E.g., People v. Vines (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">830</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 850-\n852; People v.

T.W., a 57-year-\nold maintenance supervisor from Oakland, answered ―yes‖ to questionnaire items\nasking if he knew anyone who had been investigated or charged with a crime or if\nanyone in his family had been arrested or convicted of a crime. When asked to\nexplain these answers, however, he simply drew question marks. In response to a\nquestion about particular types of crimes that upset him, T.W. said, ―Innocent\npeople going to jail.‖ He stated, ―I think the system is unfair to Black[s]‖ when\nasked about the effectiveness of the criminal justice system and checked ―no‖\n\n\n                                         32\n\fwhen asked if the system treats minorities fairly. Expounding on this answer, he\nwrote: ―So much to say[.] The history of slavery go[es] to[o] deep in this\ncountry.‖ Asked if he would like to see changes to the justice system, T.W.\nresponded ―no‖ and explained, ―It [is] the people I want to see changed.‖ T.W.\nsaid he was ―neutral‖ on the death penalty and thought it appropriate in some\ncases. When asked if his views on the death penalty had changed, however, he\nanswered ―yes‖ and commented ―because of the number of Black[s] on death\nrow.‖\n        The trial court explored some of these responses during T.W.‘s voir dire.\nAsked about his comment that innocent people are going to jail, T.W. said, ―We\nseem to be hearing a lot of it lately‖ and recalled hearing that another state had\nreleased many prisoners from death row for this reason. He also mentioned he\nwas upset by the Riders scandal, a highly publicized case involving allegations of\nserious misconduct by four Oakland police officers. He affirmed that he held a\nstrong view ―that African-Americans have not been and are not now being treated\nfairly‖ in the criminal justice system. When asked about his comment that it was\n―the people‖ in the justice system he wanted to see changed, he told the court,\n―Well, I guess I‘m talking about White people,‖ although he conceded that\n―probably a lot of Black people‘s minds are made up as well, and maybe they‘re\nnot capable of making decisions based on facts.‖ Asked to explain his comments\nabout race and capital punishment, T.W. said Black people have not been treated\nfairly in the judicial system and are disproportionately represented on death row.\n        On the subject of whether he could vote to impose the death penalty on an\nAfrican-American defendant, T.W. stated that sentencing someone to death would\nbe ―a very difficult decision‖ regardless of the defendant‘s race. He told the\nprosecutor that he could conceivably impose the death penalty for the murder of a\nsingle adult, but the facts would have to be ―pretty heinous‖ and ―ugly.‖ He also\nsaid ―it seem[ed] unlikely‖ that he could vote for death for two defendants if only\none person had been murdered.\n\n\n                                          33\n\f       Finally, the prosecutor asked if T.W. himself had any experience with being\narrested or taken to jail. He answered that around 20 years earlier, after having too\nmuch to drink, he was arrested during an altercation with a cab driver. Although\nthe police took him to jail, T.W. stated that he had ―probably‖ been treated\nappropriately. Neither of the attorneys conducting voir dire for the defense asked\nT.W. any questions.\n       After this voir dire, the prosecutor challenged T.W. for cause. In the\nquestionnaire, which had been signed under penalty of perjury, T.W. stated that he\nhad not been arrested for any crime and had never ―visited or been incarcerated in,\nany jail, prison, or juvenile detention facility.‖ The prosecutor argued T.W.‘s\nprompt and detailed voir dire answers indicated he clearly remembered his\nprevious arrest and trip to jail. His failure to disclose these facts in the\nquestionnaire could not be attributed to faulty memory. The prosecutor was also\n―deeply concerned‖ about the juror‘s views on race. He remarked that T.W. was\nvery candid about his view that African-Americans are treated unfairly in the\ncriminal justice system and disproportionately placed on death row.\n       The court denied the cause challenge but said it was ―not totally\nsatisfied . . . that this man is a totally impartial juror.‖ The court understood the\nprosecutor‘s concern about having T.W. on the jury, noting it would stretch\ncredulity to assume that T.W.‘s views on racism and African-Americans on death\nrow would not enter into his deliberations and judgment. However, it could not\nconclude as a matter of law that T.W. was too biased to serve.\n       The prosecutor repeated these reasons in explaining why he used a\nperemptory challenge to excuse T.W. He noted the juror had markedly negative\nviews about the police and had mentioned a recent scandal involving Oakland\npolice officers in particular. Because T.W. said he thought the Oakland Police\nDepartment was ―a whole lot better now than it had been‖ despite the egregious\nmisconduct alleged in the case, the prosecutor concluded he held a negative view\nof the department. The prosecutor‘s case depended heavily on the credibility of\n\n\n                                           34\n\fOakland police officers, and he did not believe T.W. would fairly consider their\ntestimony. Negative views about the Oakland police were also evident in T.W.‘s\ndescription of his arrest. The prosecutor argued that T.W.‘s failure to disclose this\nincident in the questionnaire reflected a lack of honesty that was an independent,\nrace-neutral ground for excusal. The prosecutor also cited T.W.‘s reluctance to\nimpose the death penalty and his clear belief that the criminal justice system is\nracist. The prosecutor also observed that defense counsel did not ask the juror a\nsingle question, which suggested their belief that T.W. leaned heavily in their\nfavor.\n         Before ruling on the Batson/Wheeler motion, the court reviewed the\ntranscript of voir dire and the cause challenge hearing as well as its own notes\nabout the juror. Remarking that perhaps the cause challenge should have been\ngranted after all, the court concluded the prosecutor had ample reasons for striking\nT.W. and his race-neutral justifications were sincere. When a prospective juror‘s\nhostility to law enforcement and the criminal justice system is not sufficient to\nsupport a dismissal for cause, it may well justify a prosecutor‘s peremptory\nchallenge. (See, e.g., People v. Williams, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 287.) The court\nnoted T.W. had been arrested by the same police department that investigated the\nmurder. T.W.‘s own arrest was a valid race-neutral reason for excusal. (See\nPeople v. Box (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2589798\"><a href=\"/opinion/2589798/people-v-box/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1186, 1189.) Moreover, the juror‘s failure\nto disclose his arrest in the questionnaire could reflect a lack of candor, a\nlegitimate concern for the prosecutor. (See, e.g., People v. DeHoyos, supra, 57\nCal.4th at p. 114; People v. Booker (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2369367\"><a href=\"/opinion/2369367/people-v-booker/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166-167; People v.\nAyala, supra, 24 Cal.4th at p. 266.) T.W. also expressed a very low opinion of the\nOakland Police Department. Even if T.W. truly believed the department had\nimproved in recent years, the relevant events took place seven years earlier.\nMoreover, T.W. strongly believed that nonwhite defendants cannot receive a fair\ntrial. A prospective juror‘s views that the criminal justice system is biased, and\nthat the death penalty has been disproportionately imposed against minorities, can\n\n\n                                          35\n\fvalidly support a peremptory strike. (Williams, at p. 285; People v. Vines, supra,\n51 Cal.4th at pp. 850-851.) Based on this record, the trial court reasonably\nconcluded T.W.‘s mind was already made up against the prosecution.\n                     iii.   Comparative Analysis\n       As part of our assessment of the court‘s factual findings, we also consider\ncomparisons between African-American panelists the prosecutor challenged with\npanelists of other races who were allowed to serve. (People v. DeHoyos, supra, 57\nCal.4th at p. 103.) ―The rationale for comparative juror analysis is that a side-by-\nside comparison of a prospective juror struck by the prosecutor with a prospective\njuror accepted by the prosecutor may provide relevant circumstantial evidence of\npurposeful discrimination by the prosecutor. [Citations.]‖ (Id. at p. 109.) ―If a\nprosecutor‘s proffered reason for striking a black panelist applies just as well to an\notherwise-similar nonblack who is permitted to serve, that is evidence tending to\nprove purposeful discrimination to be considered at Batson‘s third step.‖ (Miller-\nEl v. Dretke (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799976\"><a href=\"/opinion/799976/miller-el-v-dretke/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 241.) ―At the same time, ‗we are mindful that\ncomparative juror analysis on a cold appellate record has inherent limitations.‘\n[Citation.] In addition to the difficulty of assessing tone, expression and gesture\nfrom the written transcript of voir dire, we attempt to keep in mind the fluid\ncharacter of the jury selection process and the complexity of the balance involved.\n‗Two panelists might give a similar answer on a given point. Yet the risk posed\nby one panelist might be offset by other answers, behavior, attitudes or\nexperiences that make one juror, on balance, more or less desirable. These\nrealities, and the complexity of human nature, make a formulaic comparison of\nisolated responses an exceptionally poor medium to overturn a trial court‘s factual\nfinding.‘ [Citation.]‖ (People v. Taylor (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1801839\"><a href=\"/opinion/1801839/people-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 887.)\n       Defendant urges this court to conduct a comparative analysis of the excused\npanelists with all 18 of the seated trial jurors and alternates. However, defendant\nhimself compares the excused panelists with only five of the trial jurors and one\nalternate. He makes no contention that comparison with any of the other 12 jurors\n\n\n                                         36\n\fhas probative value. Accordingly, we limit our analysis to the six seated jurors\ndefendant has specifically discussed. (See People v. Lomax, supra, 49 Cal.4th at\np. 572.)17\n       Defendant does not explicitly compare the excused panelists with jurors\nwho were seated. Rather, he argues two of the prosecutor‘s reasons for dismissing\nthe panelists were pretextual because Caucasian jurors who expressed similar\nviews were not excused. Pretext is established, however, when the compared\njurors have expressed ―a substantially similar combination of responses,‖ in all\nmaterial respects, to the jurors excused. (People v. DeHoyos, supra, 57 Cal.4th at\np. 107, italics added.) Although jurors need not be completely identical for a\ncomparison to be probative (see Miller-El v. Dretke, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 247,\nfn. 6), ―they must be materially similar in the respects significant to the\nprosecutor‘s stated basis for the challenge.‖ (DeHoyos, at p. 107.)\n       Defendant raised a comparative analysis argument in the trial court, and the\nprosecutor responded by explaining why he accepted some jurors who expressed\nbeliefs similar to those he struck. The trial court accepted the prosecutor‘s\nreasons, and we too conclude they do not support an inference of discriminatory\nmotive.\n       Like B.C. and T.W., three seated jurors and one alternate expressed the\nview that the criminal justice system is unfair to minorities. However, the\nprosecutor adequately explained why each of the seated jurors was stronger for the\nprosecution than those excused.\n       Juror No. 5, a Puerto Rican financial advisor, checked ―no‖ on the\nquestionnaire when asked if the criminal justice system treats minorities fairly and\nexplained, ―Empirical data has proven this fact.‖ However, based on this juror‘s\ndemeanor and questionnaire responses, the prosecutor viewed him as ―a\n\n\n17     In any event, we have examined the responses of the remaining jurors and\nfind nothing that casts doubt on the trial court‘s findings.\n\n\n                                          37\n\fconservative person‖ with ―strong beliefs in the need for people to take personal\nresponsibility for their actions.‖ The prosecutor explained that he accepted Juror\nNo. 5 because of his strong support for the death penalty. For example, he stated\nthat he would vote in favor of the death penalty on a ballot initiative because\n―[c]ertain crimes need to be dealt with [by] the death of the convicted.‖ Even\nmore important, when asked in voir dire whether death or a life sentence would be\nharder to impose, Juror No. 5 indicated they would be equally difficult. The\nprosecutor explained that in his experience, a juror who perceives either penalty to\nbe a difficult choice is likely to be ―very favorably disposed towards imposing the\ndeath penalty.‖18\n       Juror No. 6, a registered nurse, stated that the criminal justice system treats\nminorities fairly ―not at all times, but usually.‖ However, this juror had life\nexperience the prosecutor reasonably believed would favor his side. Three years\nearlier, the 13-year-old niece of the juror‘s husband was murdered by a serial\nkiller. The killer was then on death row in Texas. When asked about her views on\nthe death penalty, Juror No. 6 said she knew that California had over 600 people\non death row but had executed only three people in the past 10 years. She hoped\nthe state would either start carrying out the sentences or change the law.\nNonetheless, she viewed the death penalty as a strong symbolic statement that\ncould hopefully deter similar crimes. The prosecutor described Juror No. 6‘s voir\ndire as ―perhaps the most articulate recitation of a variety of kinds of reasons for\nvoting for the death penalty as any juror [he had] ever come across.‖ He found her\nto be ―a remarkably strong juror‖ for the prosecution.\n\n\n18     Although the prosecutor justified his challenges to E.T. and T.W., in part,\nbecause the defense had failed to question them in voir dire, defense counsel also\nasked no questions of Juror No. 5. The prosecutor observed that Juror No. 5 was\nthe only juror he had accepted whom defense counsel did not question. He\nbelieved Juror No. 5 leaned toward the prosecution, however, observing that he\nand the defense ―probably have a pretty big disagreement about where that juror\nsits.‖\n\n\n                                          38\n\f       Juror No. 11 was a fire department captain. He placed an ―x‖ on the\nquestionnaire in between ―yes‖ and ―no‖ when asked if the justice system treats\nminorities fairly. He explained, ―I have seen newspaper and news accounts that\naddress this. I do believe that ethnicity is an issue in the criminal justice system.\nHowever, I have no strong personal opinion.‖ The prosecutor recalled that he\nliked Juror No. 11 because he seemed focused on the issue of remorse. He stated\nin the questionnaire that the death penalty was appropriate only for cases involving\nextreme acts for which the defendant showed no remorse. Noting that both\ndefendants had committed significant postmurder violence, including attempts to\nintimidate a witness, the prosecutor predicted he would ―do pretty well on [the\nremorse] issue‖ with this juror. Also, like Juror No. 5, Juror No. 11 said in voir\ndire that both death and life imprisonment are severe penalties, and he would not\nhave more difficulty imposing either one.\n       Some seated jurors also made statements similar to B.C.‘s comments that\nmoney is necessary to buy a good defense. However, their sentiments on this\nissue were generally milder, or qualified. The prosecutor reasonably viewed them\nas stronger jurors for his side.\n       Juror No. 8 referred to the influence of wealth obliquely when she\ncommented in the questionnaire that the O.J. Simpson trial had made her\n―somewhat skeptical‖ of the effectiveness of the criminal justice system. The\nprosecutor was impressed with her prior jury service in a murder trial, however.\nJuror No. 8 and one other juror believed the defendant was guilty of the greater\noffense, but the rest of the jury believed only the lesser offense had been proven.\nAware that the verdict had to be unanimous, after much deliberation she and the\nother juror switched sides, convicting the defendant of the lesser offense. Juror\nNo. 8 commented that they later learned, after talking with the judge, that they\n―had given the wrong verdict.‖ From Juror No. 8‘s description of this experience,\nthe prosecutor saw her as someone ―who made great strides to reach a unanimous\nverdict.‖ As for the fact that Juror No. 8 had talked herself into voting not guilty\n\n\n                                          39\n\fon a murder charge, only to find out later that she had made a mistake, the\nprosecutor believed she would see this case as ―an opportunity to redo her jury\nservice‖ and would not make the same mistake again.\n       Juror No. 10, a supervisor of a grocery store meat department, stated in her\nquestionnaire that the criminal justice system is ―very effective if you have plenty\nof money & an excellent attorney.‖ She also checked ―yes‖ when asked whether\nminorities are treated unfairly in the criminal justice system. The prosecutor\nexplained that he liked jurors who are supervisors because they often have to make\nhard decisions in their job. Because Juror No. 10 was a butcher, he felt she would\nnot be overwhelmed by gory evidence in the case. The prosecutor also noted two\nways in which Juror No. 10 shared similarities with victim Beeson: She had a\nhistory of drug abuse, and her husband had strangled her during an argument. In\naddition, when asked in the general portion of the questionnaire if she would like\nto see any changes to the criminal justice system, Juror No. 10 volunteered that\nshe wanted to ―narrow the appeals down on death penalty cases.‖ She repeated in\nvoir dire that if there was no doubt of a defendant‘s guilt, she did not see the need\nto spend money and court time on lengthy appeals. In light of these answers, the\nprosecutor believed she was a strong juror.\n       Like Juror No. 10, Alternate Juror No. 16 expressed doubts about the\nfairness of the justice system to minorities and the indigent. She stated in the\nquestionnaire that the criminal justice system is ―generally effective – but access\n(financially) to effective attorneys can be beneficial.‖ When asked if minorities\nare fairly treated, she answered, ―For the most part yes[,] but as in all aspects of\nlife some people can be judged (unfairly) based on their race or ethnicity.‖ The\nprosecutor did not recall details of Alternate Juror No. 16‘s questionnaire or voir\ndire except that she was strongly in favor of the death penalty and that her brother-\nin-law was a judge in Kern County. Although she circled the questionnaire\nresponse stating she was ―moderately in favor‖ of the death penalty, rather than\n―strongly in favor,‖ we do not agree with defendant‘s assertion that the prosecutor\n\n\n                                          40\n\fmischaracterized the juror‘s views in a manner that evidences discriminatory\npretext. (See Miller-El v. Dretke, supra, 545 U.S. at pp. 244-246; Cook v.\nLaMarque (9th Cir. 2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405650\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405650/cook-v-lamarque/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 818.) Moreover, we find reasonable the\nprosecutor‘s reliance on the fact that Alternate Juror No. 16 was related to a sitting\njudge as an explanation for why the prosecutor chose not to challenge her.\n       The prosecutor gave reasonable explanations for why he viewed each of\nthese seated jurors as more favorable than excused panelists E.T., B.C., and T.W.\nComparative analysis does not suggest that the prosecutor‘s reasons for striking\nthese panelists were pretexts for unlawful discrimination.\n                     iv.    Statistical Arguments\n       Apart from individual and comparative juror analyses designed to ferret out\npretext, defendant insists discrimination must have occurred because it was\nstatistically improbable that no African-Americans would serve on a jury in\nAlameda County. He notes that while African-Americans comprised only about 6\npercent of the panel, the prosecutor used 30 percent of his peremptory challenges\nagainst them, excusing 100 percent of the African-American panelists called into\nthe jury box.\n       In regard to whether a prima facie case of discrimination has been\nestablished under Batson‘s first step, we have observed that the excusal of all\nmembers of a particular group may suggest impropriety. (People v. Pearson,\nsupra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 422; People v. Crittenden (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2614001\"><a href=\"/opinion/2614001/people-v-crittenden/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119.)\nStatistical evidence about the underrepresentation of certain groups in the venire\nmay also be relevant to this prima facie showing. (See Johnson v. California,\nsupra, 545 U.S. at pp. 169-170 & fn. 5.) Here, however, the trial court found a\nprima facie case had been established and proceeded to the second and third steps\nof the Batson/Wheeler inquiry. The existence of a prima facie case is therefore not\nin dispute. The only dispute here concerns whether the court properly found that\nthe inference of discrimination was rebutted by the race-neutral justifications\ngiven for the strikes. (See Johnson, at p. 168.)\n\n\n                                         41\n\f       We are aware of no case holding that statistical evidence about the\nunderrepresentation of particular groups on a venire, or jury panel, can be\nsufficient to undermine a trial court‘s considered findings at the third step of a\nBatson/Wheeler analysis. By the third step, the court has already found that\nexclusion of jurors from a particular group requires explanation. (See Johnson v.\nCalifornia, supra, 545 U.S. at p. 173.) The question at the third step is not\nwhether the defendant can plausibly urge systematic exclusion, but whether any\nparticular panelist was, in fact, excused due to group bias. (See People v. Avila\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2515784\"><a href=\"/opinion/2515784/people-v-avila/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 549.) Defendant argues the Supreme Court‘s discussion of\nthe percentage of African-American panel members struck in Miller-El v. Dretke,\nsupra, 545 U.S. at pages 240 to 241, supports the relevance of statistics to third\nstep inquiries. The high court did discuss these facts as relevant background.\nHowever, its conclusion that at least two panelists were dismissed because of\nmanifest racial prejudice was not based solely on statistics but also on a close\nanalysis of the voir dire responses of dismissed panelists and seated jurors, the use\nof racially discriminatory practices such as ―shuffling‖ the jury panels, disparities\nin the prosecutor‘s questioning of African-American panelists, and a systemic\npolicy of the district attorney‘s office to exclude African-Americans from juries.\n(Id. at pp. 241-264.) While statistical facts may retain some relevance at Batson‘s\nthird step as part of the universe of evidence bearing on the plausibility of asserted\njustifications for a strike (see id. at pp. 251-252), no case has suggested such facts\nalone could be sufficient to establish pretext.\n       Defendant complains that his jury consisted of eight Caucasians, two\nAsians and two Latinos, whereas, ―if race were not an issue . . . one would have\nexpected five white jurors, three Asian jurors, two Latinos, [and] two blacks.‖\nHowever, we have long held that ―no litigant has the right to a jury that mirrors the\ndemographic composition of the population, or necessarily includes members of\nhis own group, or indeed is composed of any particular individuals.‖ (Wheeler,\nsupra, 22 Cal.3d at p. 277.) Nor does the Sixth Amendment demand such a\n\n\n                                          42\n\fprecise correlation between the demographics of the community and a particular\njury. ―Although a defendant has a right to a jury drawn from a fair cross-section\nof the community as a means of ensuring his or her right to an impartial jury, he or\nshe has no right to a jury that reflects the racial composition of the community.\n[Citations.]‖ (People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 119-120.) As the\nSupreme Court has explained, ―[t]he Sixth Amendment requirement of a fair cross\nsection on the venire is a means of assuring, not a representative jury (which the\nConstitution does not demand), but an impartial one (which it does).‖ (Holland v.\nIllinois (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112358\"><a href=\"/opinion/112358/holland-v-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">474</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480.)\n         Finally, to the extent defendant‘s statistical arguments urge that the venire\nwas not representative, the claim has not been preserved for appeal. Defendant\nneither objected to the panel nor moved to quash the venire. (See People v. Lewis\n(2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623326\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623326/people-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">610</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 634.) Nor has he attempted to support the claim by\nshowing that the jury selection process in Alameda County results in the\nsystematic exclusion of African-Americans. (See Duren v.

Admission of Defendant’s Confessions\n         Defendant sought to exclude his recorded statements about Beeson‘s\nmurder. The confessions were made after full Miranda warnings (see Miranda,\nsupra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">), but defendant argued they were involuntary because they\nwere induced by ―the intentional application of psychological pressure‖ and a\npromise of leniency to avoid the death penalty. After a lengthy hearing, the court\nfound all of the statements admissible. Defendant renews his arguments, claiming\nreversible error. Substantial evidence supports the factual findings below. We\nindependently conclude as a legal matter that the statements were voluntarily\ngiven.\n                a.     Background\n         On May 1, 1996, police officers questioned Patterson about the murder\nafter they found Botello‘s shotgun in his home. Patterson initially denied specific\n\n\n                                           43\n\fknowledge but ultimately admitted his involvement and identified defendant as the\nmurderer. The police then advised Patterson of his Miranda rights again and took\na recorded statement. Patterson‘s interview concluded shortly before 1:00 a.m.\n       A day later, officers brought defendant to the police department. He was\nplaced in a homicide interview room without handcuffs at 10:15 a.m. About an\nhour later, Sergeants Enoch Olivas and John McKenna began the interview.\nDefendant was immediately advised of his Miranda rights and waived them, both\norally and in writing. The officers used no physical force during the interview and\nmade no threats or promises to induce cooperation. Altogether, defendant spoke\nto the police from 11:07 a.m. until 2:00 a.m. the next morning, when he finished\ngiving his final recorded statement about the crimes. This interview was\nconducted in relatively short sessions, with lengthy breaks between. Defendant\nwas given food, drink, and access to a bathroom.\n       During the first session, defendant discussed how he knew Botello and\nPatterson. After 50 minutes of questioning, officers took an hour-long break and\ndefendant had lunch. Questioning resumed for another hour and 15 minutes.\nDefendant talked more about Patterson and how he knew Maceo Smith. He\nspeculated that a power outage at his grandmother‘s house was the reason his\nankle monitoring bracelet did not transmit a signal during some days in December.\nAt the end of the session, Sergeant Olivas said he had evidence that defendant was\ninvolved in Beeson‘s murder. He did not mention Patterson‘s interview or\ndisclose other details. Defendant denied any involvement. The third interview\nsession began after a 40-minute break and lasted a little over an hour. Defendant\nacknowledged visiting Botello‘s apartment and, contrary to his earlier statements,\nnow admitted he had noticed Botello‘s shotgun. The officers brought defendant\nanother meal during a 45-minute break.\n       The fourth interview session lasted about an hour and a half. Sergeant\nOlivas showed defendant photographs that depicted Patterson in custody and\nplayed the first four or five minutes of Patterson‘s taped confession. Olivas\n\n\n                                         44\n\ftestified that the portion he played did not include details about the murder, nor\ndid he supply defendant with any details from Patterson‘s account about how the\nmurder had been committed. Nevertheless, defendant‘s countenance changed\nnoticeably. Whereas he had displayed confidence, smirking and saying the\nofficers ―didn‘t have anything on him,‖ defendant now dropped his head. He\nmouthed, ―that motherfucker,‖ and said, ―the streets made me bitter.‖ After more\nquestioning, defendant admitted he went to Botello‘s apartment to commit a\nrobbery but said, ―I didn‘t plan it the way it happened.‖ He explained that Beeson\n―didn‘t take the robbery seriously.‖ The officers took a 10-minute break.\n       When the interview resumed for another hour-long session, defendant made\nadditional statements which Sergeant Olivas wrote down verbatim. Defendant\nsaid: ― ‗I admit I was there‘ ‖; ― ‗If I get the death penalty, I get it‘ ‖; ― ‗Once I got\nthere, it all went sour‘ ‖; ― ‗I have to play it out‘ ‖; and ― ‗I‘m fucked.‘ ‖ Sergeants\nOlivas and McKenna both testified that they never mentioned the death penalty or\nany possible punishments. Defendant was the first to mention the penalty. His\nremark was unsolicited and not responsive. The officers did not acknowledge the\nremark or discuss penalties with defendant in any way. They took a 90-minute\nbreak after this session and set up equipment for the next interview session to be\nsurreptitiously recorded. Sergeant Olivas believed defendant would soon start\ndescribing details about the murder, and he did not want to inhibit this disclosure\nby openly recording.\n       The next interview session began again shortly after 9:00 p.m. Before the\nquestioning started, defendant remarked, ― ‗I‘m going to get what I‘m going to\nget.‘ ‖ The officers then showed defendant photographs of Beeson and began\nrecording. Defendant then confessed to robbing and murdering Beeson. He gave\nmany details about the chronology, including what he and Patterson each did to\nBeeson, the items they stole, and how they disposed of the knife. Specifically, he\nsaid Patterson hit Beeson with the barrel of Botello‘s shotgun and she began\nmaking a lot of noise. Defendant gave his belt to Patterson and told him to choke\n\n\n                                           45\n\fher into unconsciousness. When Patterson was unsuccessful, defendant grabbed\nan end of the belt, and they choked her together for several minutes. Because\nBeeson was still conscious and they worried about her making noise, defendant\ntook a knife from the kitchen and stabbed her repeatedly in the shoulder and back\nof the neck. When they left, he thought Beeson was probably dead. Defendant\nwas very animated in retelling the events, even acting out for the officers how he\nand Patterson had choked their victim and where on the neck he had stabbed her.\nAt the end of this interview session, defendant said, ―Man, I get this off my chest,\nman.‖\n        During a short break, the officers brought recording equipment into the\ninterview room. Defendant waived his Miranda rights again and gave a formal\ntaped statement. He again blamed Patterson for hitting Beeson with the shotgun\nand starting to choke her, but he admitted he grabbed the belt and choked Beeson\nalso. Defendant also took full responsibility for the stabbing, although he said he\nonly meant to quiet Beeson down so that he and Patterson could leave. When he\nrealized the wounds could kill her, and it looked like she was suffering, defendant\nsaid he stabbed her one final time ―[t]o finish it off.‖ Sergeant Olivas testified\nthat, throughout the interview, he never talked with defendant about the\npunishment for murder or circumstances that would implicate the death penalty.\n        After giving the recorded statement, defendant asked to call his mother. He\nwas allowed to do so but was warned that all telephone calls were monitored.\nAfter the recording equipment was installed, defendant called and told his mother\nthat he and Patterson had murdered a woman. He explained he had confessed to\nthe police because he heard a taped statement in which Patterson was trying to\nminimize his own responsibility. Defendant said he told the police the truth\nbecause he thought they would seek the death penalty against him, whereas\nPatterson would get a reduced sentence. He thought he would probably spend the\nrest of his life in prison.\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\f       Later that night, defendant gave two more recorded statements to a deputy\ndistrict attorney. The first described the robbery and murder in full detail. The\nsecond was an Aranda statement recounting the events of that evening without\nmention of Patterson‘s involvement.19 Each of these statements was preceded by\nMiranda warnings followed by defendant‘s repeated waivers.\n       Defendant testified that he was not harmed or threatened during the\ninterview, and his physical needs were provided for. The interview‘s tone was\ncordial and respectful at the start but turned accusatory when Sergeant McKenna\nshowed him a photograph of Botello‘s shotgun. McKenna said defendant‘s\nfingerprints were found on the gun and the police had learned defendant was\npressuring and threatening Botello before the murder. Defendant claimed\nMcKenna said ―I might as well help myself, defend myself right now, or else they\nwould have to assume the worst and I would get the death penalty.‖ The officers\nplayed him the entire tape of Patterson‘s confession. Afterward, defendant asked\nwhat could happen if he gave additional information. Sergeant McKenna\nresponded that talking could help ―clear‖ him of the death penalty if the murder\nwas unintentional or accidental. Defendant testified that he changed his story\nbecause, with Patterson‘s statement and his fingerprints on the gun, the case\nagainst him appeared strong, and he did not want to risk the death penalty. He\nasked what would happen if he admitted more knowledge of the murder and said\nMcKenna promised to call a friend at the district attorney‘s office. Then\ndefendant ―wouldn‘t have to worry about the death penalty if they [kept] their end\nof the bargain.‖ Defendant believed the officers ―had all the power‖ and could\nremove the case from death penalty consideration if he cooperated.\n       Sociology professor Richard Ofshe, Ph.D., testified as an expert on\ninfluence and police interrogation. Based on the interview tapes and transcripts\nand defendant‘s own recollection about unrecorded portions of the interview,\n\n\n19     See People v. Aranda (1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1160583\"><a href=\"/opinion/1160583/people-v-aranda/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n                                         47\n\fOfshe concluded the police used psychologically coercive tactics to secure\ndefendant‘s confession. Specifically, in the professor‘s opinion, defendant‘s\nstatements in the phone call to his mother indicated he believed he was avoiding\nthe death penalty and securing a lighter sentence by admitting involvement.\nAlthough these statements did not prove capital punishment was threatened, they\ndid suggest the subject came up during questioning. Ofshe also testified that\ndefendant‘s confession was ―contaminat[ed]‖ because it came after defendant\nheard the recording of Patterson‘s statement. He explained, ―contamination can\ngive someone information necessary to tell a story that fits the crime facts even if\nthey weren‘t there.‖ Ofshe discounted testimony that the tape was played for only\nfive minutes because Patterson did not implicate defendant until later in his\nstatement. Finally, Ofshe believed defendant‘s unpersuasive claim that the murder\nwas accidental was an attempt to obtain leniency.\n       On cross-examination, Ofshe conceded that generally accepted procedure\ndid not require the police to record all phases of defendant‘s interview.\nEncouraging defendant to feel angry with Patterson was not a psychologically\ncoercive tactic. Nor was it inappropriate for the police to play defendant a portion\nof Patterson‘s recorded confession. Ofshe conceded the police did not appear to\nhave used any psychologically coercive tactics during the recorded portions of\ndefendant‘s interview.\n       After examining all relevant circumstances in a lengthy, thoughtful ruling,\nthe court determined beyond a reasonable doubt that all of defendant‘s statements\nwere voluntary. The court found both police officers credible based on the criteria\nset forth in CALJIC No. 2.20 and concluded both gave truthful accounts of\ndefendant‘s interviews. Indeed, with regard to personal demeanor, the court\nobserved that ―one would be hard-pressed to find a more mild-mannered,\nin[]offensive, unantagonistic, soft-spoken, nonconfrontational, pleasant man than\nSergeant Olivas.‖ Nothing about the content of defendant‘s statements or his tone\nof voice on the recordings suggested he was speaking under physical or\n\n\n                                         48\n\fpsychological duress. Nor did defendant say anything in the recordings to suggest\nthat any deal had been offered regarding his penalty. Based on the officers‘\nunequivocal testimony and the absence of any contrary suggestion in defendant‘s\nrecorded statements, the court found that no threats or deals had been made about\nthe death penalty. Defendant told his mother he believed he could avoid the death\npenalty by cooperating with the police, ―telling them the truth,‖ but he never\nattributed this belief to anything the officers said to him. Defendant was\nextraordinarily experienced with the criminal justice system, had been interrogated\nby law enforcement and juvenile justice authorities many times before, and would\nnot have been easily intimidated or coerced by the questioning here. Finally, the\ncourt rejected Dr. Ofshe‘s testimony as heavily biased and based on unsupported\nhypothetical scenarios, such as death penalty threats made during a suspect‘s trips\nto the bathroom. All of defendant‘s statements were admitted at trial.\n              b.      Analysis\n       State and federal constitutional principles prohibit a conviction based on an\ninvoluntary confession.

To be considered involuntary, a\nconfession must have resulted from coercive police conduct rather than outside\ninfluences. (Colorado v.

(People v. Carrington, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 169;\nSchneckloth v.

Relevant factors include:\n― ‗ ―the crucial element of police coercion [citation]; the length of the interrogation\n[citation]; its location [citation]; its continuity‖ as well as ―the defendant‘s\n\n\n                                           49\n\fmaturity [citation]; education [citation]; physical condition [citation]; and mental\nhealth.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Massie, supra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 576.) No single factor is\ndispositive. (People v.

Voluntariness is a legal\nquestion subject to independent review; a trial court‘s related factual findings are\nupheld if supported by substantial evidence. (People v. Carrington, supra, 47\nCal.4th at p. 169; People v. Holloway (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2508855\"><a href=\"/opinion/2508855/people-v-holloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 114; People v. Massie,\nsupra, 19 Cal.4th at p. 576.) When the evidence conflicts, the reviewing court\nmust accept the version of events most favorable to the People as long as it finds\nsupport in the record. (People v. Tully (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 993; People v.\nThompson (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1138459\"><a href=\"/opinion/1138459/people-v-thompson/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">134</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166.)\n       Defendant‘s primary argument is that police officers improperly coerced his\nconfession by mentioning the death penalty and either explicitly or implicitly\npromising he would receive a lighter sentence if he confessed. Although\nconfessions procured by threats of prosecution for a capital crime have been held\ninadmissible (see People v. Thompson, supra, 50 Cal.3d at p. 169), mere\n―[r]eference to the death penalty does not necessarily render a statement\ninvoluntary.‖ (People v. Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 443.) A constitutional\nviolation arises ―only where the confession results directly from the threat [capital]\npunishment will be imposed if the suspect is uncooperative, coupled with a\n‗promise [of] leniency in exchange for the suspect‘s cooperation‘ [citation].‖\n(People v. Holloway, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 116.)\n       There was a square conflict in the evidence concerning whether defendant\nwas threatened or promised leniency. The court‘s resolution of this factual\nquestion rested heavily on credibility assessments. Sergeants Olivas and\nMcKenna both denied mentioning the death penalty or discussing the subject of\npunishment during defendant‘s interviews. They testified that defendant made an\nunsolicited remark about the death penalty in an unrecorded session but that they\ndid not respond or even acknowledge the remark. Although defendant made\n\n\n                                         50\n\fstatements to his mother suggesting a belief he would not get the death penalty if\nhe confessed, nothing in the transcript of the call, or elsewhere in the record,\nreveals the source of this misunderstanding. The trial court expressly found the\nofficers‘ testimony credible. It found defendant‘s contrary account, and his\nexpert‘s inferences based on that account, unbelievable. Substantial evidence\nsupports these findings. We independently conclude defendant‘s statements were\nnot coerced by express or implied promises of leniency. (See People v. Tully,\nsupra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 993; People v. Boyette, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 412.)\n       This conclusion is not undermined by defendant‘s complaint that he was\nyoung and ―had a limited educational background.‖ Despite his youth, defendant\nhad extensive experience with the criminal justice system, beginning in his early\nteens. He testified that he knew his Miranda rights. In his phone call to his\nmother he was even able to explain the difference between Three Strikes and\nindeterminate sentencing for murder. The record also belies defendant‘s claim\nthat the police deceived him by claiming they had his fingerprints on Botello‘s\nshotgun, playing all of Patterson‘s taped confession, or suggesting that the murder\nwas accidental. None of these assertions was corroborated. The trial court\nreasonably rejected defendant‘s testimony.\n       Defendant also now claims the length of his interrogation rendered it\ninvoluntary. Below, defendant expressly disclaimed any challenge based on\ndeprivation of physical needs. Assuming he did not thereby forfeit his present\ncomplaint about interrogation conditions, the claim fails on the merits. Defendant\nmisleadingly asserts that he was interrogated continuously for over 16 hours,\npunctuated only by psychologically coercive ―periods of isolation.‖ In fact, as\ndefendant‘s trial counsel observed, defendant was in custody and interviewed for\nonly about six hours before he confessed to murdering Beeson. The officers\nprovided defendant with meals and access to the restroom. The questioning was\ninterspersed with numerous breaks. Indeed, the trial court observed that the\nsessions between breaks were shorter than those at court. Although defendant was\n\n\n                                          51\n\fleft alone in the interview room, these relatively brief periods of solitude did not\nrender the interview coercive, or the resulting statements involuntary. The police\nwere under no obligation to provide defendant with entertainment or diversion.\nThese periods gave him an opportunity to consider his situation, evaluate his\noptions, and change his mind if he chose to do so. The trial court reasonably\ndetermined that the interview sessions were not unduly protracted and all of\ndefendant‘s personal needs were appropriately met. There is no evidence the\npolice ― ‗exploited any ―slowly mounting fatigue‖ ‘ ‖ to coerce a confession.\n(People v. Williams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 446.) Defendant‘s claim of\ninvoluntariness on this ground fails as well.\n       The cases on which defendant relies are readily distinguishable. In People\nv. Neal (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2588587\"><a href=\"/opinion/2588587/people-v-neal/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80-82, the police deliberately continued questioning\nafter the defendant clearly and repeatedly invoked his right to counsel. This\nflagrant violation of Miranda weighed heavily in our conclusion that the\ninterrogation was coercive. (Neal, at p. 81.) Neal was also jailed overnight\nbetween interviews without food, drink, or access to a toilet. (Id. at p. 84.) Here\ndefendant‘s personal needs were accommodated and the officers carefully adhered\nto Miranda, obtaining multiple waivers. (Cf. People v. Williams, supra, 49\nCal.4th at pp. 447-448 [distinguishing Neal on these grounds].) Taylor v. Maddox\n(9th Cir. 2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786028\"><a href=\"/opinion/786028/leif-taylor-v-thomas-m-maddox-interim-director-george-galaza-cal-terhune/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is neither binding nor apposite. In that habeas\nproceeding, the Ninth Circuit found a voluntariness determination unreasonable\nbecause state courts had ignored highly probative testimony supporting the\ndefendant‘s account of his interrogation. (Id. at pp. 1005-1007.) The same cannot\nbe said here; indeed, the trial court‘s careful examination of the evidence is\nespecially notable. Spanning more than 57 pages of the reporter‘s transcript, the\ncourt‘s discussion covered all relevant evidence in extensive detail.\n       4.     Denial of Severance\n       Before trial, defendant moved to sever his case from Patterson‘s, arguing\ntheir antagonistic defenses would undermine verdict reliability and the\n\n\n                                          52\n\fintroduction of Patterson‘s statements would violate defendant‘s right of\nconfrontation. In lengthy hearings, the court and counsel reviewed each line of\nPatterson‘s statement to the police and removed all references that arguably\ninculpated defendant. Having thoroughly and carefully redacted Patterson‘s\nstatement, the court concluded its admission in a joint trial would not prejudice\ndefendant.20 The court ruled that defendant‘s claim of antagonistic defenses was\ninsufficient for severance, citing numerous United States Supreme Court and\nCalifornia cases. (See, e.g., Zafiro v. United States (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112812\"><a href=\"/opinion/112812/zafiro-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537-538;\nPeople v. Jackson, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 1208.)\n       Defendant renewed his motion for severance at various points during the\ntrial when questioning or argument by Patterson‘s counsel suggested defendant\nbore primary responsibility. These motions were consistently denied. On appeal,\ndefendant again claims he was prejudiced by Patterson‘s defense. He focuses on\nthe testimony of two witnesses.\n       At the guilt phase, evidence was admitted that Julia P. anonymously called\nthe police to report information about the murder. Julia told the police she had\noverheard defendant telling a cousin he had robbed Beeson, and people were\nsaying defendant had either shot or stabbed Beeson when she refused to cooperate.\nA recording of this phone call was played at trial. The evidence was offered as\nproof of Patterson‘s motive for and consciousness of guilt in the assault. The\ncourt admonished the jury that it was being admitted against Patterson only.\nNevertheless, defendant complains the evidence was not probative unless the jury\nfound his confession to be true, and he argues the phone call would not have been\nadmitted at all in a separate trial.\n       Defendant also complains Patterson ―abandoned his defense of innocence‖\nby offering the preliminary hearing testimony of Tyrone Freeman. Freeman had\ntestified that, while they were in custody, defendant said he had murdered a girl\n\n\n20     This issue became moot because Patterson ultimately testified.\n\n\n                                         53\n\fduring a robbery with his brother-in-law ―Nate.‖ The testimony implicated\nPatterson, who was romantically involved with defendant‘s sister. It also\nsuggested defendant was responsible for the actual killing. Defendant now\ncomplains he was prejudiced because the prosecutor elected not to offer\nFreeman‘s testimony.\n       The Legislature has established a strong preference for joint trials. (People\nv. Souza (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109.) Section 1098 states, in relevant part: ―When\ntwo or more defendants are jointly charged with any public offense, whether\nfelony or misdemeanor, they must be tried jointly, unless the court order separate\ntrials.‖ ―Joint trials are favored because they ‗promote [economy and] efficiency‘\nand ‗ ―serve the interests of justice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of\ninconsistent verdicts.‖ ‘ (Zafiro v. United States[, supra,] 506 U.S. [at pp.] 537,\n[539].)‖ (People v. Coffman and Marlow (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623595\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623595/people-v-coffman/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (Coffman and\nMarlow).) We review the denial of a severance motion for abuse of discretion,\nbased on the facts as they appeared at the time of the court‘s ruling. (Id. at p. 41;\nSouza, at p. 109.) ―Even if a trial court abuses its discretion in failing to grant\nseverance, reversal is required only upon a showing that, to a reasonable\nprobability, the defendant would have received a more favorable result in a\nseparate trial. [Citation.]‖ (Coffman and Marlow, at p. 41.)\n       ―When defendants are charged with having committed ‗common crimes\ninvolving common events and victims,‘ as here, the court is presented with a\n‗ ―classic case‖ ‘ for a joint trial. (People v. Keenan (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405837\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405837/people-v-keenan/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 499-\n500.)‖ (Coffman and Marlow, supra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 40.) Defendant and\nPatterson were charged with Beeson‘s first degree murder and faced special\ncircumstance allegations. The evidence against both was strong. Their common\nmotivation to shift blame to each other did not by itself compel severance.\n(People v. Letner and Tobin (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630926\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630926/people-v-letner-and-tobin/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 150 (Letner and Tobin); People\nv. Jackson, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 1208.) ― ‗If the fact of conflicting or\nantagonistic defenses alone required separate trials, it would negate the legislative\n\n\n                                          54\n\fpreference for joint trials and separate trials ―would appear to be mandatory in\nalmost every case.‖ ‘ [Citation.]‖ (Letner and Tobin, at p. 150.) Instead,\nantagonistic defenses support severance ―only where the acceptance of one party‘s\ndefense precludes the other party‘s acquittal.‖ (Carasi, supra, 44 Cal.4th at\np. 1296; Coffman and Marlow, at p. 41.) If the moving party‘s guilt can be\nestablished by sufficient independent evidence, ―it is not the conflict alone that\ndemonstrates . . . guilt,‖ and severance is not required. (Coffman and Marlow, at\np. 41; see Letner and Tobin, at p. 150; Carasi, at p. 1298.)\n       Defendant‘s arguments for severance fail. The defenses he and Patterson\noffered at trial were largely consistent. Both testified that they were not present at\nthe murder but were tricked into confessing. They each disavowed their own\ninculpatory statements. (See Carasi, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1297.) Rather than\nundermining defendant, Patterson‘s testimony actually supported his claim that the\npolice had coerced him into making a false confession. Indeed, it was defendant,\nnot the prosecutor, who introduced Patterson‘s confession. Defendant relied on\nthe tape to explain how he could have confessed to a murder he later claimed to\nknow nothing about.\n       Even if the jury disbelieved their trial testimony and focused on the police\nstatements, these versions were not sufficiently antagonistic to require severance.\nDefendant and Patterson each admitted to robbing Beeson, leaving her for dead,\nand disposing of the weapon. The only material inconsistency concerned the\ndegree to which each participated in the murderous acts. ― ‗That each was\ninvolved in the incident was undisputed, however . . . . [T]his was not a case in\nwhich only one defendant could be guilty. The prosecution did not charge both\nand leave it to the defendants to convince the jury that the other was [the guilty]\nperson.‘ ‖ (People v. Jackson, supra, 13 Cal.4th at p. 1209.)\n       Significant independent evidence established defendant‘s guilt. As the trial\ncourt observed in denying his severance motion, ―overwhelming‖ proof of\ndefendant‘s guilt came from evidence ―out of his own mouth.‖ He confessed to\n\n\n                                          55\n\fBeeson‘s murder repeatedly to the police, prosecutors, and his own mother. These\nconfessions, coupled with testimony from others establishing motive and a\ntimeline for the night of the murder, provided ample proof of defendant‘s guilt\napart from Patterson‘s statements. Severance was not required. (Letner and\nTobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 150; Carasi, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1298.)\n       Defendant‘s complaints about specific evidence do not persuade us\notherwise. Although Julia‘s phone call might not have been admitted in a separate\ntrial, it was not admitted against defendant in this trial. The jury was admonished\nthat the evidence was offered only against Patterson. We presume it followed this\ninstruction. (See Letner and Tobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 152; People v. Boyette,\nsupra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 436.) Nor does defendant have cause to complain about the\nadmission of Tyrone Freeman‘s preliminary hearing testimony describing\ndefendant‘s jailhouse confession. This evidence would have been admissible\nagainst defendant in a separate trial. The mere fact that damaging testimony is\npresented by codefendant‘s counsel instead of the prosecutor does not deprive a\ndefendant of constitutional or statutory rights. (People v. Jackson, supra, 13\nCal.4th at p. 1208.)\n       Defendant‘s additional complaints of prejudice at the penalty phase are\nunpersuasive. Defendant complains he was denied his right to individualized\nsentencing because Patterson‘s counsel portrayed him as the more culpable party.\nHowever, this argument would eviscerate the statutory preference for joint trials in\nall capital cases. (See People v. Hardy (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2618245\"><a href=\"/opinion/2618245/people-v-hardy/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168.) There is no\nindication that the jury was unable or unwilling to assess penalty independently, or\nthat it ―engaged in improper comparative evaluations‖ of defendant and Patterson.\n(People v. Taylor (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2631807\"><a href=\"/opinion/2631807/people-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1155</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1174.) The jury was told to decide the\nquestion of penalty separately as to each defendant, and we must presume it\nfollowed this instruction. (Letner and Tobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 152.)\n\n\n\n\n                                         56\n\fB.     Guilt Phase Issues\n       1.     Admission of Victim Photographs\n       Defendant sought to exclude several photographs taken at the crime scene\nand just before Beeson‘s autopsy. He argued the crime scene photos were\ngruesome, because they showed a large amount of blood, and misleading, because\nthe scene had been altered. Paramedics had removed some of Beeson‘s clothing\nwhile attempting to revive her. Defendant worried her seminude body would\nsuggest a sexual component to the murder. He also objected that photographs of\nBeeson‘s nude body on the autopsy table were unnecessarily graphic and largely\ncumulative of the pathologist‘s testimony. The prosecutor argued the autopsy\nphotographs were relevant to show Beeson had sustained bruising and other\ninjuries all over her body, not just to her head and neck. Photos of her blood-\nsoaked clothing and of blood at the crime scene illustrated the brutality of the\nmurder and contradicted defendant‘s self-serving statement that he had merely\ntried to put Beeson to sleep. Although the paramedics‘ intervention had changed\nsome aspects of the crime scene, the prosecutor maintained these photos were still\nrelevant to corroborate testimony about the placement of Beeson‘s body and other\nitems in the room.\n       The court weighed the probative value and risk of undue prejudice for each\nitem offered, ultimately excluding four photographs. Defendant now claims those\nadmitted were unduly prejudicial under Evidence Code section 352 and their\nadmission violated his federal constitutional rights to due process and a fair trial.\n       The admission of victim photographs lies within the broad discretion of the\ntrial court. Its decision will not be disturbed unless the photographs‘ probative\nvalue is clearly outweighed by their prejudicial effect. (People v. Heard, supra,\n31 Cal.4th at p. 975; People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 133-134.) The\ncourt carefully balanced probative value and potential prejudice for each\nphotograph and admitted only those it found appropriate. This decision was well\nwithin the court‘s discretion. Proper admission vitiates defendant‘s constitutional\n\n\n                                          57\n\fclaim. (See People v. Thomas, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 935; People v. Riggs (2008)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2584893\"><a href=\"/opinion/2584893/people-v-riggs/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 304.)\n       Defendant‘s claim of prejudice rests largely on the fact that several photos\ndepict Beeson‘s nude body. Crime scene photos with Beeson‘s shirt removed are\nmisleading, he argues, and ―subliminally‖ suggest a sexual aspect to the murder.\nDefendant contends this risk of undue prejudice was exacerbated by racial\nundertones: ―A photograph of a naked, young white woman is the kind that tends\nto evoke an emotional bias against a defendant, particularly a young black man.‖\nThe trial court properly determined any risk of prejudice was outweighed by the\nphotographs‘ probative value.\n       The crime scene photos were the only ones depicting the location of\nBeeson‘s body in the room and her blood-soaked clothing. They corroborated the\ntestimony of Botello and police witnesses and would help the jury understand and\nevaluate testimony about how Beeson was found. (See People v. Pollock (2004)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621639\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621639/people-v-pollock/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1171.) Although unpleasant, they are not particularly gruesome\nor sexually graphic. Four of the photos show Beeson‘s body on its side, facing\naway from the camera. She is wearing only underwear and lying on a blood-\nsoaked shirt with defibrillator pads attached to her chest. Two photos focus on the\nwounds to the back of her head and neck. These photographs were not so\ngruesome as to impermissibly sway the jury, which would hear testimony detailing\nall facts relating to the crime scene and victim. (See People v. Scheid (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20.) Nor could nudity in the photos have misled the jury into thinking\nthere was a sexual component to the murder. As the trial court observed,\nwitnesses explained how medical interventions altered the original crime scene.\nBotello and the first police officer at the scene testified that Beeson was clothed\nwhen they found her. Witnesses repeatedly explained that her clothing had been\nremoved by paramedics. Forensics experts confirmed there was no evidence of\nany sexual activity. Finally, the prosecutor assured the jury in opening statement\n\n\n\n                                         58\n\fthat ―[t]here was no rape here,‖ and defendant points to no questioning or\nargument raising that insinuation.\n       Nor were the autopsy photos impermissibly cumulative because there was\nno dispute about the cause of death. We have rejected this argument on many\noccasions. (See People v. Riggs, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 304; People v. Scheid,\nsupra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 19; People v. Crittenden, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 134-135.)\nThe photographs were properly admitted to illustrate the testimony of the\npathologist and to corroborate other evidence, including statements in both\ndefendants‘ confessions. (See People v. Thomas, supra, 54 Cal.4th at p. 935;\nRiggs, at p. 304.)\n       2.     Presence of Courtroom Deputy During Defendant’s Testimony\n\n       Defendant contends his federal due process rights were violated when the\ncourt stationed a deputy near the witness stand during his testimony. Any error\nwas harmless.\n       When defendant testified at a pretrial hearing, a bailiff sat near the witness\nstand. Defendant‘s attorney observed that, while this arrangement was fine for the\npretrial hearing, he would strongly object if a bailiff accompanied defendant to the\nstand during trial. Treating defendant differently from other witnesses in this way\nwould communicate to the jury that defendant was especially dangerous. The\ncourt responded that its practice, like that of other judges in the county, was that\n―defendants with the charges we have before us‖ were accompanied to the witness\nstand by a bailiff. The court disagreed that the bailiff‘s presence communicated\nanything to the jury and noted that the bailiff was positioned about the same\ndistance from defendant at the witness stand as he was when defendant was seated\nat counsel table. At a break, the court took measurements and moved the bailiff‘s\nchair farther from the witness stand to ensure that these distances would be\nidentical. Having done so, the court ruled that it would ―continue the practice of\nhaving any in-custody witness accompanied by a bailiff.‖ He emphasized that this\n\n\n                                          59\n\frule would apply to any witness in custody, whether called by the prosecution or\ndefense and regardless of the charge for which the witness was incarcerated. Both\ndefendant and Patterson testified during the guilt phase and were the only in-\ncustody witnesses to do so.\n       Decisions about courtroom security measures are typically reviewed for\nabuse of discretion unless they ―carry an inordinate risk of infringing upon a\ncriminal defendant‘s right to a fair trial.‖ (People v. Stevens (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387480\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387480/people-v-stevens/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 632.) In Stevens, we held that stationing a deputy at the witness stand near a\ntestifying defendant is not an ―inherently prejudicial‖ practice that can only be\njustified by a showing of manifest need. (Id. at p. 638; see also Holbrook v. Flynn\n(1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111619\"><a href=\"/opinion/111619/holbrook-v-flynn/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 567-569.) However, we also observed that ―the trial court\nmust exercise its own discretion in ordering such a procedure and may not simply\ndefer to a generic policy.‖ (Stevens, at p. 644.) We urged trial courts to give\nreasons on the record and explain why the need for this security measure\noutweighed potential prejudice to the defendant. (Id. at p. 642.) ―Although not a\nmodel of clarity,‖ the trial court‘s discussion there of safety concerns, the need to\nprevent distractions or escape, and juror notes expressing concern about the\ndefendant‘s agitated demeanor, all indicated the court had exercised its own\njudgment based on case-specific considerations. (Id. at p. 643.)\n       The record was quite different in People v. Hernandez (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">733</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. There, the trial ―court asserted that it had seen a deputy at the witness stand\n‗in every trial I‘ve ever done . . . because of security,‘ and noted that a bailiff was\n‗supposed‘ to sit behind ‗all defendants‘ who testify, ‗even in a petty theft‘ case.\nDespite a direct request from defense counsel, the court refused to make an\nindividualized finding that defendant‘s behavior warranted this heightened\nsecurity measure. Instead, the court responded that this defendant ‗deserve [d]‘ to\nhave a deputy stationed at the witness stand for the same basic security reasons\n‗every defendant deserve[d]‘ to have this procedure employed.‖ (Id. at p. 743.)\nOn the whole, these remarks revealed that the court ruled pursuant to a standard\n\n\n                                           60\n\fpolicy and not based on specific facts about the defendant or the particular case.\n(Ibid.) The court briefly mentioned some specific factors, such as the defendant‘s\nextensive criminal record and the violent nature of his offense. However, its\nremarks were, at most, post hoc justifications for adhering to a generic policy.\n(Ibid.) This reliance on a standard policy was an abuse of discretion but reversal\nwas not required because the error was harmless under People v. Watson (1956)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. (Hernandez, at pp. 744, 746.)\n       Here, the court devoted considerable time and attention to the issue. It\ndiscussed California cases addressing the use of physical restraints and other\ncourtroom security measures and concluded the posting of deputies in the\ncourtroom was within the court‘s broad discretion. It also obtained measurements\nand repositioned seating to ensure that the bailiff would not obstruct jurors‘ views\nof defendant and would sit the same distance away from him as when defendant\nwas at counsel table. While the court‘s legal research and its careful measures to\navoid prejudice are commendable, its analysis did not focus on case-specific\nreasons justifying the security measure.21 On the contrary, the court emphasized\nthat its order for posting a bailiff at the witness stand applied to any in-custody\nwitness called by either side. Although many facts could have justified the order,\ngiven the nature of the present crimes and defendant‘s long record of violence\nwhile in custody (see post, at pp. 74-77), we do not examine the record for such\ncase-specific reasons when it is clear that the court‘s order was based on a\nstanding practice. (See People v. Hernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 744.)\n       However, the error was clearly harmless. Two or three bailiffs were\nstationed in the courtroom throughout the trial, and only one sat near defendant at\nthe witness stand. As the trial court took pains to ensure, the deputy sat three feet\naway from defendant, maintaining precisely the same distance from the witness\n\n\n21    We note that the trial occurred in 2003, well before our decisions in Stevens\nand Hernandez.\n\n\n                                          61\n\fchair as from defendant‘s usual position at counsel table. Nothing in the record\nsuggests the bailiff treated defendant with anything other than courtesy and\nrespect. (See People v. Hernandez, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 746.) Moreover, the\nevidence against defendant was strong, much of it coming from his own detailed\nstatements to the police and his mother. Given the compelling evidence of guilt, it\nis not reasonably probable defendant would have obtained a more favorable result\nabsent the error. (See id. at pp. 745-746, 748; People v. Watson, supra, 46 Cal.2d\nat p. 837.) Nor is there a reasonable possibility that this security measure affected\nthe penalty phase verdict.22\nC.       Penalty Phase Issues\n         1.    Victim Impact Evidence\n         Defendant raises several challenges to victim impact evidence. None has\nmerit.\n               a.     Background\n         The prosecution and defense filed motions in connection with victim\nimpact evidence. After a lengthy hearing, the court rejected defendant‘s argument\nthat victim impact testimony be restricted to family members who were personally\npresent at the murder or would foreseeably be affected by the crime. However, the\ncourt precluded testimony from two of Beeson‘s friends under Evidence Code\nsection 352, finding it would likely be duplicative of other evidence.\n         The prosecution offered testimony from Beeson‘s mother and sister.\nMelitta Beeson described her daughter as loyal, fearless, and artistic, with an\ninfectious sense of humor. Beeson struggled with a learning disability and\n\n\n22     Defendant argues prejudice under Chapman v. California (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107359\"><a href=\"/opinion/107359/chapman-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 23. However, the failure to state reasons for stationing a deputy at the witness\nstand is not a federal constitutional error, and People v. Watson furnishes the\nappropriate test for judging harmlessness. (See People v. Hernandez, supra, 51\nCal.4th at pp. 745-746.) In regard to the penalty phase, the error was also\nharmless under the ―reasonable possibility‖ test. (See People v. Brown (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405930\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405930/people-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 447-448.)\n\n\n                                         62\n\fattended many schools. She was a rebellious teenager who often drank and stayed\nout late; however, she had matured in the year before her death and was starting to\nplan for the future. Beeson was very close to her father. Fred Beeson received the\ncall that she was dead, and he had to identify the body. He was ―totally\ndevastated‖ by the murder and died six months later.\n       Lisa Beeson was close to her younger sister. She had just finished her\npenultimate semester of law school at Tulane and was out of the country when she\nlearned Beeson had been killed. She came home to parents who were profoundly\naffected. Her father was depressed but also obsessed with trying to discover what\nhad happened. Lisa withdrew from law school and moved home. She arranged a\nmemorial service for her sister that many people attended. She also arranged a\ncremation and went with her father to bury the remains. As they drove to the\nmortuary, Lisa saw her father in the backseat stroking the top of the box\ncontaining Beeson‘s ashes. Her father and sister were now buried next to each\nother. Lisa described making identical bouquets, tied together with a ribbon, and\nplacing them on the graves each time she visited. The family no longer celebrated\nholidays or birthdays. Lisa remained angry and hurt over her sister‘s murder.\n       After reviewing numerous photographs and documents offered by the\nprosecution, the court excluded roughly half under Evidence Code section 352. It\nadmitted a notebook containing 53 photographs taken throughout Beeson‘s life, a\nreport card, a group of letters, and a Christmas list Beeson gave her mother shortly\nbefore the murder. During closing argument, the court allowed the prosecutor to\nplay an 18-minute video montage displaying photographs of Beeson from the\nnotebook, crime scene, and autopsy, and the audio confessions of defendant and\nPatterson. The soundtrack consisted of taped excerpts from Iva Mosely‘s police\ninterview along with both defendants‘ confessions.\n\n\n\n\n                                        63\n\f              b.      Analysis\n                      i.     Attendance of Family Members at Trial\n       Before addressing the substance of this evidence, defendant claims the\ncourt erred in permitting Beeson‘s sister and mother to both attend the guilt phase\nand testify as victim impact witnesses. Defense counsel observed these family\nmembers silently crying at points during the trial and argued they should be\nexcluded from the courtroom. The court denied the request, noting that it had paid\nclose attention to the audience and had observed nothing remotely prejudicial.\nThere had been no outbursts or vocal demonstrations, nor any other violations of\ncourtroom decorum.\n       This ruling was an appropriate exercise of the court‘s discretion.\nImmediate family members of a murder victim have the right to attend trial subject\nto ―overriding interests,‖ such as the defendant‘s right to a fair trial. (§ 1102.6,\nsubds. (b)(1), (c).) A spectator‘s behavior is grounds for reversal only if it is ― ‗of\nsuch a character as to prejudice the defendant or influence the verdict,‘ ‖ and the\ntrial court has broad discretion in determining whether spectator conduct is\nprejudicial. (People v. Myles (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1215; People v.

We found no error in Myles when a murder\nvictim‘s wife nodded in agreement with prosecution witnesses, cried openly in\ncourt, and was consoled by support persons. (Myles, at pp. 1215-1216.) The\nmodest displays of emotion here were even less likely to prejudice defendant‘s\nright to a fair trial. The trial court closely observed the proceedings and was in the\nbest position to evaluate the impact of family members‘ conduct on the jury. (See\nibid.) We defer to its informed conclusion that silent tears from Beeson‘s mother\nand sister were not prejudicial.\n       Nor is there merit to defendant‘s unsupported claim that family members\nwho observe the guilt phase of trial may not testify as victim impact witnesses.\nHis proposal would severely curtail family members‘ statutory right to attend trial\nand the scope of permissible victim impact evidence. Preserving a fair trial for the\n\n\n                                          64\n\fdefendant does not require such an extreme limitation on the court‘s discretion and\nthe universe of victim impact evidence.\n                     ii.    Volume and Content of Victim Impact Evidence\n       Next, defendant raises several challenges to the victim impact evidence\nadmitted. He argues the evidence was excessive and the content was so\nemotionally charged as to be a memorial service for the victim. He specifically\nobjects to testimony about Beeson‘s funeral and family visits to her grave.\nFinally, he complains the victim impact evidence supported ―an invidious\ncomparison between the societal worth‖ of the deceased and defendant.\n       ―Unless it invites a purely irrational response, evidence of the effect of a\ncapital murder on the loved ones of the victim is relevant and admissible under\nsection 190.3, factor (a), as a circumstance of the crime. [Citation.]‖ (People v.\nBooker, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 190.) Moreover, the federal Constitution prohibits\nvictim impact evidence only if it is ―so unduly prejudicial‖ as to render the trial\n―fundamentally unfair.‖ (Payne v. Tennessee (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112643\"><a href=\"/opinion/112643/payne-v-tennessee/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 825; see\nPeople v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at pp. 466-467.)\n       This victim impact evidence was well within these guidelines and typical in\nboth volume and content to evidence we have routinely deemed acceptable. (See,\ne.g., People v. Pearson, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 467; People v. Kelly (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2637243\"><a href=\"/opinion/2637243/people-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">763</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793.) Testimony from two family members is not excessive. (People\nv. Booker, supra, 51 Cal.4th at p. 194.) In Pearson, we upheld the admission of\nvictim impact testimony from three family members and six close friends.\n(Pearson, at pp. 464-467.) In People v. Brady (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387577\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387577/people-v-brady/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 573, 576-\n577, we concluded testimony from a slain police officer‘s four sisters, fiancée, two\nfellow officers, police chief, and treating physician was not unfairly excessive.\n       Defendant argues that, to be consistent with Payne v. Tennessee, victim\nimpact evidence must be limited to testimony from a single witness describing the\nmurder‘s effect on a family member who was present at or immediately after the\ncrime, and these effects must have been known or reasonably apparent to the\n\n\n                                          65\n\fdefendant. He also contends events occurring years before or after the crime are\nnot admissible in aggravation under section 190.3, factor (a). We have routinely\nrejected these claims (see, e.g., People v. Tully, supra, 54 Cal.4th at pp. 1031-\n1032; People v. Zamudio (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2634388\"><a href=\"/opinion/2634388/people-v-zamudio/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364) and do so again. The\nPeople are entitled to present a complete history of the murder victim‘s life and\nmay also present testimony from loved ones who, sometimes vividly, describe the\nimpact of their loss. (People v. Garcia (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844248\"><a href=\"/opinion/844248/people-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 751.)\n       Nor was the testimony here so emotional as to invite an irrational response.\nThe witnesses appropriately described the person Beeson was and the traumatic\nimpact of her death on the family. We have consistently observed that the\nemotional trauma suffered by close friends and relatives is a permissible subject of\nvictim impact testimony. (E.g., People v. Zamudio, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 368;\nPeople v. Boyette, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 445.) Both witnesses testified to the\ndevastating effect of the murder on Beeson‘s father, but neither speculated that the\nmurder in some way caused his death. (See People v. Booker, supra, 51 Cal.4th at\np. 193.) Lisa Beeson‘s testimony about her father stroking the box of her sister‘s\nashes, and about her own visits to the gravesites, was poignant but not so\nemotional as to provoke an irrational juror response. ―Emotional testimony is not\nnecessarily inflammatory.‖ (People v. Brady, supra, 50 Cal.4th at p. 575; see\nBooker, at p. 193.) Moreover, we have repeatedly held that evidence related to a\nmurder victim‘s funeral is relevant and admissible. (See People v. Garcia, supra,\n52 Cal.4th at p. 752; Booker, at pp. 192-193.)\n       Finally, defendant complains the victim impact evidence created a risk that\nthe jury‘s penalty decision would be swayed by improper comparisons between\nhis character and Beeson‘s. He asserts this risk is particularly acute in cross-racial\ncrimes, where jurors are likely to empathize with a White victim. We rejected\nsimilar arguments in People v. Kelly, supra, 42 Cal.4th at page 799. Here, too, the\nclaims lack merit. Nothing in the victim impact evidence or argument, or\nelsewhere in the record, even remotely encouraged the jury to consider race in\n\n\n                                          66\n\freaching a penalty verdict. (See ibid.) Defendant complains the prosecutor‘s\nclosing argument expressly contrasted the backgrounds of Beeson and defendant.\nIn fact, the prosecutor only fleetingly mentioned that defendant and Beeson were\nabout the same age in the context of discussing defendant‘s criminal\nsophistication. He remarked on the absence of defendant‘s family at the trial but\ndid not invite the jury to compare this lack of involvement with Beeson‘s family.\nIn fact, it was defense counsel who argued, ―we have a clear contrast here‖\nbetween ―the loving support that Erika Beeson‘s family gave Erika‖ and\ndefendant‘s family, who not only failed to come to court but failed to support him\nwhen he struggled with ADHD as a child.\n                     iii.   Videotape Montage in Closing Argument\n       During closing argument, the prosecutor played an 18-minute videotape\ndepicting several photographs of Beeson throughout her life and, briefly, in death.\nThe audio track consisted of recorded excerpts from Iva Mosley‘s interview and\nthe defendants‘ police statements. All of the visual and auditory material in the\nvideotape had previously been admitted in evidence. There was no accompanying\nmusic. After watching the videotape and hearing arguments from counsel, the\ncourt ruled that it could be played as a demonstrative aid during closing argument\nbut would not be admitted into evidence.\n       We have addressed the admissibility of victim impact videotapes\nfrequently, cautioning that courts should not permit evidentiary presentations with\noverly dramatic or emotional elements, stirring music, or irrelevant images. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Prince (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289; see also People v. Sandoval\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 440-442; People v. Kelly, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 798.)\nHowever, unlike many other videotapes we have considered, here every image and\nsound presented in the videotape had already been admitted in evidence. The\nprosecutor did not seek to introduce new evidence through the videotape. Instead,\nhe used the content of admitted items of evidence to make his points as a matter of\nargument. As in People v. Bramit (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2573928\"><a href=\"/opinion/2573928/people-v-bramit/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1241, ―the videotape\n\n\n                                         67\n\fwas simply ‗a repackaging of the evidence‘ ‖ and was a permissible exercise of\nadvocacy.\n       Defendant complains that the juxtaposition of victim images with excerpts\nfrom the confessions was misleading or inflammatory. The trial court rejected\nthese assertions. We have viewed the videotape and agree that the presentation\nwas not prejudicial. In People v. Wash (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1158185\"><a href=\"/opinion/1158185/people-v-wash/\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256, the prosecutor\ndisplayed slides of the crime scene and victims during opening statement while\nsimultaneously playing audio portions of the defendant‘s confession. Over\ndefendant‘s objection that the presentation was inflammatory, we concluded the\nprosecutor had committed no misconduct because the slides and recordings were\nlater admitted in evidence and their use as demonstrative aids during argument\nwas appropriate. (Id. at pp. 256-257.) The same is true here. The jury had\npreviously received all of the videotape‘s images and sounds during trial. While\nthe juxtaposition of confessions with images of the murdered victim may have\nbeen evocative, the videotape contained no ― ‗irrelevant or inflammatory\nmaterial‘ ‖ that could have ― ‗divert[ed] the jury‘s attention from its proper role or\ninvite[d] an irrational, purely subjective response.‘ ‖ (People v. Prince, supra, 40\nCal.4th at pp. 1289-1290.) Moreover, because defense counsel were the last to\npresent arguments, they were free to comment on the prosecutor‘s presentation or\noffer rebuttal.\n       2.         Issues Related to Factor (b) Evidence\n       Section 190.3, factor (b) permits the jury to consider a defendant‘s criminal\nactivity involving the use, threat, or attempt to use force or violence in deciding\nwhether to impose the death penalty or life imprisonment without parole.\nDefendant raises several challenges to the factor (b) evidence admitted in his\npenalty trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                           68\n\f                 a.   Harassment of Julia P.\n                      i.     Sufficiency of Evidence\n       Before trial, the prosecutor moved to admit evidence that defendant had\nsexually assaulted Julia P. In a tape-recorded statement, Julia alleged that\ndefendant had exposed himself to her and requested oral sex, then displayed a gun\nand attempted to rape her. The defense challenged the truth of these claims,\nnoting Julia did not file a police report and had not mentioned the incident in\nmultiple conversations with the police about defendant. The court ruled the\nevidence admissible, noting the delayed report went to the weight of the evidence\nand could be explored on cross-examination. In addition, while the alleged\nconduct was violent and threatening, the court ruled it was not so inflammatory as\nto require an additional hearing.\n       At the penalty phase, Julia described three incidents. Once, when she was\nsitting under a hair dryer, defendant approached with his pants down. He\nforcefully touched her breasts and neck, exposed his penis, and asked for oral sex.\nAnother time, she was lying on a couch watching television with friends.\nDefendant suddenly pushed her down, straddled her, pinned her wrists, and tried\nto pull her pants down. When she resisted, defendant ordered his younger brother\nto remove her pants. The brother refused, telling defendant to leave her alone. On\na third occasion, Julia went into her friend‘s bathroom to escape defendant when\nhe was pestering her to have sex. Defendant followed her in, shut the door behind\nhim, and turned off the light. He pulled a gun and held the barrel near his chin.\nEventually the friend‘s mother came to the door, and defendant let her leave.\nSometime later, to end the harassment, Julia did allow defendant to engage in\nintercourse.23\n\n\n\n23       Julia also described two factor (b) incidents related to Patterson. In the\nfirst, she saw Patterson repeatedly slap and kick his girlfriend on a street corner.\nIn the second, she was lying on a couch and Patterson touched her sexually.\n\n\n                                          69\n\f       Defendant now claims this evidence was insufficient to demonstrate he\nused or threatened to use force or violence. To the contrary, Julia P.‘s testimony\nclearly establishes that defendant used force when he groped her under the hair\ndryer and pinned her to the couch by her wrists. In the third incident, defendant\nprevented her from leaving the bathroom and brandished a firearm. These acts\nviolated several penal statutes. They were sufficient to be admissible as\naggravating evidence. (§ 190.3, factor (b).)\n                     ii.    Impeachment with False Claims of Rape\n       Defendant also complains the court erred in precluding him from cross-\nexamining Julia about two false claims of rape. Counsel asked whether Julia had\ntold her friend Nicole that she had sex with Nicole‘s boyfriend, ―Pie,‖ because he\nforced himself on her. Julia answered, ―no,‖ and the prosecutor objected when\ncounsel tried to inquire further. The court sustained the objection under Evidence\nCode section 352, finding any probative value of this evidence would be\nsubstantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect, undue consumption of time, and\nconfusion of the issues. Defense counsel asserted the evidence was relevant as a\nfalse accusation of rape, but when pressed for a more specific offer of proof he\nconceded he had not been able to locate Nicole or her boyfriend. The court ruled\nthat no further questioning on the subject would be permitted until defendant was\nprepared to produce either of these witnesses.\n       During the chambers conference, defense counsel mentioned he also\nwanted to introduce evidence that Julia told ―various people‖ she had had sex with\nher friend‘s grandfather, Zeke. Counsel wanted to ask her about these statements\nand ―hopefully the witness will testify truthfully that she lied.‖ The prosecutor\nobjected that this offer of proof did not even involve a false claim of rape, but only\nsexual activity. Remarking that the offer of proof was ―very vague‖ and the\nquestioning sought appeared to be ―a fishing expedition,‖ the court ruled that this\nline of questioning would be prohibited unless the defense satisfied Evidence\n\n\n\n                                         70\n\fCode section 782.24 In response, the defense requested a continuance, which was\ndenied. The court observed that the defense had prior notice of these issues and\ncould recall Julia once it had made the proper showing.\n       Evidence may be excluded under Evidence Code section 352 ―if its\nprobative value is substantially outweighed by the probability that its admission\nwill (a) necessitate undue consumption of time or (b) create substantial danger of\nundue prejudice, of confusing the issues, or of misleading the jury.‖ An exercise\nof discretion under Evidence Code section 352 will be affirmed unless it was\narbitrary, capricious, or patently absurd and the ruling resulted in a miscarriage of\njustice. (People v. Rodriguez (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1420107\"><a href=\"/opinion/1420107/people-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9-10.) The trial court\nreasonably exercised its discretion in prohibiting further cross-examination on the\nwitness‘s sexual activity.\n       A prior accusation of rape is relevant to the complaining witness‘s\ncredibility, but only if the accusation is shown to be false. (People v. Tidwell\n(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1447</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1457.) In People v. Bittaker (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1179588\"><a href=\"/opinion/1179588/people-v-bittaker/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1046</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1097, after a witness testified the defendant threatened her with a gun when she\nrefused his advances, the defendant sought to impeach with evidence that the\nwitness had falsely accused two other men of sexual molestation. The trial court\nsustained an Evidence Code section 352 objection, and we affirmed. We\nexplained: ―The value of the evidence as impeachment depends upon proof that\nthe prior charges were false. This would in effect force the parties to present\nevidence concerning two long-past sexual incidents which never reached the point\nof formal charges. Such a proceeding would consume considerable time, and\ndivert the attention of the jury from the case at hand.‖ (Bittaker, at p. 1097.)\n       The same is true here. Julia denied accusing Pie of rape. For this line of\nquestioning to have any relevance, then, the defense would have had to establish\n\n24     This provision requires a written motion and sworn offer of proof, and a\nhearing, before a complaining witness‘s sexual activity may be used to attack\ncredibility. (Evid. Code, § 782.)\n\n\n                                          71\n\fboth that the accusation was made and that it was false. (See People v. Tidwell,\nsupra, 163 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1457-1458.) The trial court reasonably concluded\nthis inquiry would consume undue amounts of time. Further, it appears that\ncounsel could not establish adequate foundation in light of his admission that he\nhad not located Pie or the person to whom Julia allegedly complained.\nDefendant‘s second proffered impeachment was even further afield. As the\nprosecutor observed, this alleged statement was not a claim of rape, but merely\nthat the witness had sex with someone. It could conceivably have been relevant if\nthe statement was false, but counsel merely ―hope[d]‖ this was the case and did\nnot have ready proof. The court acted well within its discretion in preventing this\nfishing expedition from diverting undue time and attention from the trial.\n       Nor did the court abuse its discretion in denying a continuance. A midtrial\ncontinuance may be granted only for good cause. ―A showing of good cause\nrequires a demonstration that counsel and the defendant have prepared for trial\nwith due diligence. [Citations.]‖ (People v. Jenkins (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195356\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195356/people-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1037;\nsee § 1050, subd. (e).) The record demonstrates that defense counsel had been\naware of Julia‘s allegations for at least six months. Yet they gathered no further\nevidence to support their argument that she had made false accusations against\nother men. Given counsel‘s unsuccessful attempt to locate the key witnesses, the\ntrial court acted well within its discretion in concluding an additional continuance\nwith no proffered basis to expect success was unjustified. We note that the court\nleft open an opportunity for the matter to be revisited later if counsel made an\nappropriate showing. No such showing was attempted.\n                     iii.   Hearsay Statements\n       On cross-examination, the defense stressed Julia‘s failure to tell the police\nabout defendant‘s harassing conduct until shortly before trial and her spotty\nmemory as to what she told the police at various times. In an attempt to\nrehabilitate her, the prosecutor asked about a tape-recorded statement she made\nwhile in the hospital after Patterson‘s attack. When asked if she remembered\n\n\n                                         72\n\ftelling officers how she learned defendant had murdered Beeson, Julia said she\noverheard someone named Charles say to her friend Lakeisha, ― ‗your cousin‘s\ncrazy for killing that white girl.‘ ‖ The court allowed the statement but instructed\nthe jury it could not be considered for the truth of the matter asserted but only for\nits bearing on the witness‘s ability to recall the day in question. Defendant raised\nanother hearsay objection when Julia testified that Lakeisha told her defendant and\nPatterson had killed Beeson because ― ‗they were trying to rob her, and she\nwouldn‘t cooperate so they killed her.‘ ‖ The court overruled this objection as\nwell and again told the jury the statement could not be considered for its truth.\n       Defendant now complains the court violated his due process right to a fair\npenalty hearing by admitting ―highly inflammatory evidence.‖ He complains the\nprobative value of the evidence was slight because there was no serious dispute\nabout Julia‘s ability to recall the day in question, or the reasons why she failed to\ntell the police about defendant‘s assaultive conduct. The record belies this\nassertion. Defense cross-examination repeatedly challenged Julia‘s memory of\ndetails. Moreover, the statements were only prejudicial insofar as they implicated\ndefendant in Beeson‘s murder. But they were admitted at the penalty phase of\ntrial, after the jury had already convicted him. Accordingly, the statements\nconcerned a crime that was no longer in dispute. Because defendant‘s authorities\nall concern the admission of hearsay statements at the guilt phase, they are\ninapposite to the question of prejudice here. Finally, to the extent defendant‘s\nreply brief suggests the statements violated Crawford v. Washington (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"134724\"><a href=\"/opinion/134724/crawford-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the claim fails. (See id. at p. 59.) The trial court carefully reminded\njurors that the statements could not be considered for their truth. As nonhearsay,\nthe statements fall outside the Crawford rule.\n              b.     Violent Acts Committed as a Juvenile\n       Over defendant‘s objection that they were too remote, the court admitted as\nfactor (b) evidence testimony regarding several acts he committed as a juvenile.\n(See People v. Anderson (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623304\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623304/people-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 586.) Defendant now challenges\n\n\n                                          73\n\fboth the direct admission of these juvenile offenses and his expert‘s testimony on\ncross-examination about additional incidents. The evidence was properly\nadmitted.\n                      i.     Background\n         When defendant was 12 years old, he and a companion approached a\nwoman who had arrived home late at night and was sitting in her parked van.\nDefendant ordered her to open the door and give them her money. When she did\nnot comply, he struck the van‘s windows with a pole, cracking the glass.\nDefendant‘s companion pointed a gun at her and threatened to shoot her. The\nvictim started the ignition and drove off, swerving as she heard gunshots.\n         Berkeley police officers detained defendant at age 13 after he appeared to\nthrow something into bushes. During a pat search, they found a lump of rock\ncocaine. Defendant struggled and tried to run but was eventually handcuffed.\n         When he was 14, defendant led police on a high-speed car chase through\ncity streets for over 30 minutes. He eventually hit a patrol car and submitted to\narrest. When read his Miranda warnings, defendant said, ―I shouldn‘t have run. I\nshould have got out of my car and started shooting at you.‖ He then criticized the\nofficer‘s gun and bragged that he had been shooting a .357 Magnum revolver\nearlier that night. Defendant said he threw away the gun and some drugs during\nthe chase. A .357 Magnum revolver was found later that night in an area of the\nchase.\n         At age 16, defendant was written up three times for being threatening and\ndisrespectful to Juanita Ream, a teaching assistant at CYA. He called her a\n―coward‖ and a ―bald-hair bitch‖ and had to be removed from the classroom by\nsecurity. He was verbally abusive with the CYA officer and youth counselor who\ntried to talk with him, refused to cooperate in a search, and had to be physically\nrestrained.\n         When defendant was 17, a CYA officer overheard him tell his roommate:\n― ‗You are going to be my pussy. You are going to give it to me. I‘ll make you\n\n\n                                          74\n\fsubmit.‘ ‖ The roommate was lying on the bottom bunk and defendant was\nleaning over him. Defendant held a weapon fashioned from a toothbrush pointed\nat his roommate‘s throat. When defendant was removed from the room, he\nbecame physically combative and threatened to harm the officer. Later that year,\ndefendant assaulted a smaller boy as they left the CYA showers. He chased the\nboy down the hall until two officers subdued him with Mace.\n       The prosecutor mentioned several additional incidents in cross-examining\ndefendant‘s expert, Dr. Jamie Candelaria-Greene, about material she read in\ndefendant‘s juvenile records and discipline reports. For example, defendant‘s\nmother reported that he played with matches and at age eight had attempted to set\nfire to a neighbor‘s home. From age 10 to 13 defendant lived in a group home,\nwhere he had three fist fights with peers and threatened staff on three occasions.\nDr. Candelaria-Greene denied seeing reports about armed robberies or auto thefts\nduring this period but did see a juvenile hall report that he had threatened a judge.\nShe also saw reports of defendant‘s violence against his mother and sister. The\ncourt instructed the jury that information referred to in these juvenile reports was\nnot admitted for truth but only to show the basis of the expert‘s opinions.\n                     ii.     Analysis\n       Juvenile criminal activity involving force or threatened violence is\nadmissible in aggravation under factor (b). (See, e.g., People v.

Bramit, supra, 46 Cal.4th at p. 1239.)\n       Defendant urges us to reconsider our holdings based on the Supreme\nCourt‘s extension of Roper v. Simmons in Miller v. Alabama (2012) 567 U.S. __\n[</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959737\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959737/miller-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">] to sentences of life imprisonment without parole. Yet there too\nthe focus was on Eighth Amendment standards for punishing juvenile misconduct.\nHere, the question is what evidence may be considered when determining\npunishment for an adult‘s crime. The high court has never suggested that, in\ndeciding that question, the jury may not consider qualifying criminal conduct the\ndefendant committed as a juvenile. Even if defendant is correct that Roper and\nMiller treat juvenile misconduct as less blameworthy than adult misconduct,\nevidence of forceful or violent conduct is nevertheless relevant to penalty phase\nquestions about character and future dangerousness. (See People v. Bivert, supra,\n52 Cal.4th at p. 123.) Arguments about the offender‘s youth and immaturity go to\nthe weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. 25\n       Defendant also complains that the admission of his juvenile misconduct is\ninconsistent with section 26, which presumes that children under age 14 are\nincapable of committing a crime. However, the presumption of incapacity can be\nrebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the minor knew the wrongfulness\nof his act. (People v. Lewis, supra, 26 Cal.4th at p. 378.) Because defendant did\nnot raise this objection below, the prosecutor did not present evidence and the trial\ncourt did not make findings on in this regard. To the extent defendant now argues\nthere was insufficient foundation of his capacity, the claim has not been preserved\nfor review. (See People v. Partida (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2576438\"><a href=\"/opinion/2576438/people-v-partida/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">428</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 434-435.)\n\n25      The same is true for defendant‘s assertion that it is ―unseemly‖ to base a\ndeath sentence on juvenile misconduct he committed while under the state‘s\nsupervision. Defendant spent much of his youth in group homes and CYA\nbecause he was a violent, repeat offender. He was free to present evidence\ncriticizing the services he received, but defendant‘s residence in state custody does\nnot make his violent and threatening conduct as a juvenile any less admissible.\n\n\n                                          76\n\f              c.     Nonviolent Incidents\n       Factor (b) evidence ―must violate a penal statute and must be directed\nagainst a person or persons, not against property.‖ (People v. Kirkpatrick (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1013; see People v.

The\ntrial court conducted a lengthy pretrial hearing to determine if there was\nsubstantial evidence to prove the required elements of each factor (b) crime the\nprosecution sought to introduce. (See People v. Phillips (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1354747\"><a href=\"/opinion/1354747/people-v-phillips/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72\nfn. 25.) The court admitted some incidents and excluded others. Defendant now\nclaims some incidents the court allowed were not sufficiently violent or\nthreatening to be admissible. The decision to admit factor (b) evidence is within\nthe trial court‘s discretion, and no abuse of discretion will be found if substantial\nevidence was presented establishing the crimes. (Ibid.; see People v. Tuilaepa\n(1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1205179\"><a href=\"/opinion/1205179/people-v-tuilaepa/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587.)\n                     i.       Insults of CYA Teaching Assistant\n       First, defendant argues that the incident in which he called the CYA\nteaching assistant a ―coward‖ and ―bald-hair bitch‖ (see ante, at pp. 74-75) did not\nviolate a criminal statute or constitute an imminent threat. The evidence belies his\nclaim. Ream testified that defendant was walking around the classroom, calling\nher a bitch, and saying he did not have to listen to her. He seemed to be inciting\nthe other students against her. She felt threatened and called security to have him\nremoved. Defendant was verbally abusive to the officer who removed him and the\ncounselor who tried to talk to him. He repeatedly called them cowards and\nchallenged each to ―settle things one-on-one.‖ He became physically agitated and\nhad to be placed in a restraint hold. Ream reported the incident on a disciplinary\nform. When defendant returned to her class afterward, he walked straight to Ream\nand said, ―see, your write-up means nothing. I can do whatever.‖ Ream testified\nshe felt threatened during the encounter.\n       Defendant argues this evidence was inadmissible because there was no\nevidence he intended to threaten Ream or induced a reasonable belief that any\n\n\n                                            77\n\fthreats could be carried out. (See People v. Tuilaepa, supra, 4 Cal.4th at p. 580;\nBoyd, supra, 38 Cal.3d at p. 777.) However, Ream repeatedly testified that she\nfelt threatened, both by defendant‘s insulting words and his menacing behavior.\nShe could have reasonably understood his statement that her disciplinary write-up\nmeant nothing and he could ―do whatever‖ as a threat of physical retaliation for\nher call to security. The crime of unlawful threats can be established even if the\ndefendant had no present ability to act on the threat (People v. Harris (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1269</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1311), and the recipient need not perceive any immediate danger of\nthe threat being carried out (People v. Iboa (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 121).\n       Moreover, even if defendant‘s verbal abuse of Ream did not rise to the\nlevel of criminal threats, evidence about the classroom encounter provided\nimportant context for testimony about his removal from the classroom, during\nwhich he forcibly struggled and made explicit threats against the security officer\nand counselor to ―settle things one-on-one.‖ Defendant does not dispute that\nevidence of this behavior was properly admitted. ― ‗[W]hen the prosecution has\nevidence of conduct by the defendant that [is admissible under section 190.3,\nfactor (b)], evidence of the surrounding circumstances is admissible to give\ncontext to the episode, even though the surrounding circumstances include other\ncriminal activity that would not be admissible by itself. [Citation.]‘ ‖ (People v.\nWallace (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1081.)

Thomas (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">449</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505, evidence that the defendant had called a witness‘s son ―names like\n‗punk‘ and ‗sissy‘ ‖ was properly admitted as a surrounding circumstance of a\nfactor (b) crime. The same is true here.\n                     ii.    Threatening Statements to Deputies\n       Next, defendant challenges the admission of several factor (b) incidents\narising from his clashes with CYA deputies. All of the evidence was properly\nadmitted.\n       Deputy Tammy Wyatt reported defendant for passing hot water to another\ninmate, a rules violation. Angry about his limited access to hot water, defendant\n\n\n                                           78\n\fwarned a deputy that anyone who tried to enter his cell would be assaulted. When\nDeputy Wyatt brought him a food tray that week, he shoved it back at her.\nDefendant was interviewed about the disciplinary report and stated that ―if he\nwanted to get a write-up, he could get one for a much more severe incident.‖ He\nthen repeated there would be ―trouble‖ if deputies entered his cell. When the\ninterview ended and defendant‘s restraints were removed, he refused to step into\nthe pod. Instead, he turned to Deputy Wyatt and told her she had ―better not come\nup to his cell.‖ Contrary to defendant‘s claim, this remark could only have been\nintended, and understood, as a threat. Defendant was visibly angry with Deputy\nWyatt, had recently tried to hit her with a tray, and had repeatedly threatened to\nphysically assault any deputy who visited his cell. Defendant‘s warning to Wyatt\nclearly implied that defendant planned to assault her if she came to a place where\nhe was unrestrained.\n       Defendant made a similar threat to Deputy William Humphries when the\ndeputy had to tell him repeatedly to end a telephone call and return to his cell.\nDefendant yelled, ―You better check your attitude. You came in here with attitude\ntoday. You don‘t know who you are dealing with. I‘ll be here everyday,\nHumphries.‖ When the deputy began writing up a discipline report, defendant\nadded, ―I don‘t care if you are writing me up. . . . I don‘t care where I get sent.\nYou need to check your stuff. You still have to come in my room.‖ Although\ndefendant now minimizes this incident as mere ―mouthing off,‖ his words clearly\nimplied a threat to assault Deputy Humphries when the opportunity arose, and the\ndeputy understood the statements as threatening.\n       Defendant also challenges the admissibility of Humphries‘s testimony that\nthis incident occurred when defendant was in an administrative segregation unit\nfor high-profile or violent inmates. Rather than object, defense counsel chose to\ncross examine the deputy on procedures in the segregated unit. Absent an\nobjection, defendant‘s current challenge to the testimony is forfeited. (See People\n\n\n\n                                          79\n\fv. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 434-435.)26 In any event, as defendant‘s reply\nbrief concedes, this evidence was relevant context for Deputy Humphries‘s\nperception of defendant‘s statements as a threat.\n       Finally, defendant argues a deputy impermissibly testified that he had a\nreputation for violence. (See People v. Gonzalez (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2612406\"><a href=\"/opinion/2612406/people-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1233.)\nDeputy Charles Foster testified briefly about a factor (b) incident involving\nPatterson. In cross-examination, defendant‘s attorney solicited the deputy‘s views\nabout defendant‘s demeanor in prison. Deputy Foster recalled having no real\nproblem with defendant, whom he considered no different than most other\ninmates. On redirect, the prosecutor asked whether defendant had a reputation in\nthe sheriff‘s department as being excessively violent toward staff. The court\nallowed the question, finding that counsel‘s cross-examination had opened the\ndoor to inquiry about defendant‘s character. Foster answered ―yes‖ and confirmed\nhearing about defendant‘s reputation over many years from many different\ndeputies.\n       Evidence offered in rebuttal to defense mitigation evidence need not relate\nto any specific aggravating factor under section 190.3. (Coffman and Marlow,\nsupra, 34 Cal.4th at p. 109.) We have repeatedly held that impeachment is\npermissible in the penalty phase when a defense witness offers testimony bearing\non the defendant‘s character. (People v. Payton (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1066;\nPeople v.

Defense counsel elicited testimony\nfrom Deputy Foster suggesting defendant was no more violent than other inmates.\nThe People were entitled to rebut that suggestion with evidence that,\nnotwithstanding Deputy Foster‘s view, defendant was known to be an especially\n\n\n26      Defendant also did not object when Patterson‘s attorney elicited testimony\nfrom Deputy Judith Miller-Thrower that defendant‘s administrative segregation\nstatus required that he be transported in chains, even inside the jail. His present\nchallenge to this testimony was therefore not preserved. (People v. Zamudio,\nsupra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 354; People v. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th at pp. 434-435.)\n\n\n                                         80\n\fviolent inmate. ―A defendant has no right to mislead the jury through one-sided\ncharacter testimony during either the guilt or penalty trial. We do not believe that\ndefendant was entitled to elicit testimony suggesting that he was [nonviolent], and\nat the same time to preclude the People from introducing contrary evidence.‖\n(People v. Siripongs (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1172106\"><a href=\"/opinion/1172106/people-v-siripongs/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578.)\n                     iii.   Defendant’s Statement to Parole Officer\n       Parole Officer Craig Jackson testified about defendant‘s good behavior\nleading up to his release from CYA. During his last year there, defendant had no\nserious disciplinary infractions, had a job, attended classes in victim awareness\nand anger management, and expressed understanding of the seriousness of his\nconduct. Defendant‘s maturity level increased. He demonstrated insight into the\nreasons for his actions and understood how he could avoid violence in the future.\nIn the context of this testimony, Officer Jackson related that defendant told him\n― ‗he often reacted aggressively in order to gain stature among his peers and to\nmake himself feel good.‘ ‖ Defendant now argues this statement was inadmissible\nunder factor (b). We disagree. The statement reflected defendant‘s insight into\nwhy he had committed the many factor (b) offenses presented over the preceding\ndays. It was relevant context for these offenses and admissible as a surrounding\ncircumstance. (See People v. Wallace, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1081.) It was also\nrelevant as a projection of defendant‘s state of mind with respect to the Beeson\nmurder, and thus admissible as a circumstance of this crime under section 190.3,\nfactor (a). (See People v. Nelson (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2357828\"><a href=\"/opinion/2357828/people-v-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">198</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224.) Finally,\n―[e]vidence of statements from defendant‘s own mouth demonstrating his attitude\ntoward his victims was highly probative‖ on the issue of future dangerousness.\n(People v. Payton, supra, 3 Cal.4th at p. 1063.)\n       3.     Expert Testimony on Antisocial Personality Disorder and Future\n              Dangerousness\n       Defendant contends the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to cross-\nexamine his expert witness about antisocial personality disorder and future\n\n\n                                         81\n\fdangerousness. Given the scope of the expert‘s direct examination, these topics\nwere properly raised for impeachment.\n       The defense called Jamie Candelaria-Greene, Ph.D., an expert in learning\ndisabilities and special education. At the outset of her testimony, the court read a\nstandard instruction explaining that an expert‘s opinions should be assessed in\nlight of the expert‘s qualifications and the supporting facts and reasons. Dr.\nCandelaria-Greene had reviewed defendant‘s school, medical, probation, and\nCYA records but had not met with defendant before the trial. Based on her record\nreview, she testified that defendant suffered from ADHD. Defendant had never\nreceived medication or counseling for that condition.\n       Defense counsel specifically asked if the expert was aware of studies\nexamining the effects of giving prisoners ADHD medication, such as Ritalin. She\ndescribed ―an excellent study‖ in which Colorado adult prisoners who showed\nclassic signs of ADHD were given Ritalin and counseling. After six months, their\nrecidivism rate ―plummeted‖ from the nationwide average of 50 to 60 percent\ndown to 10 percent. Those still in prison were better able to participate in hobbies\nand vocational education, ―but most of all, there was a greater degree of safety\nassociated with . . . the prisoners and those around‖ them. Defense counsel also\nasked her about the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV). She confirmed\nshe was familiar with the DSM-IV and explained that it is used for diagnosing\npsychiatric conditions, including ADHD.\n       On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked about the DSM-IV\nrequirements for diagnosing antisocial personality disorder. The expert eventually\nagreed that defendant had been repeatedly diagnosed with a conduct disorder and\nfit the other DSM-IV requirements for antisocial personality disorder. She did not\nactually give her own diagnosis that defendant had this disorder. Much of her\ntestimony was based on hypothetical questions, and she repeatedly protested that\nshe was not a psychologist. Defendant objected that Dr. Candelaria-Greene was\nnot qualified to testify about the contents of the DSM-IV. The court found the\n\n\n                                         82\n\fquestioning proper because the expert testified on direct examination that she had\nrelied on the DSM-IV in reaching her conclusions. At defendant‘s request,\nhowever, the court gave a limiting instruction explaining that any reports\nreferenced or read during the expert‘s testimony were not admitted for truth but\nonly to show the basis of her opinions.\n       The prosecutor also asked about defendant‘s history of violent incidents in\nschool and CYA. The expert agreed that, without a change in environmental\nconditions, past violence is the best predictor of future dangerousness. In\nparticular, she testified that defendant‘s potential for future violence was high\ngiven his past behavior. Defendant objected at sidebar that the subject of future\ndangerousness was beyond her expertise. The court overruled this objection,\nobserving that the ―linchpin‖ of her direct examination testimony was that\ndefendant would be safe around others in prison if he were treated with Ritalin and\ncounseling. Having raised the subject of defendant‘s future violence in prison, the\ncourt ruled the defense could not insulate it from cross-examination. (See People\nv. Gates (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2604134\"><a href=\"/opinion/2604134/people-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1211, disapproved on another ground in People v.\nWilliams, supra, 49 Cal.4th at p. 459.) When the court later described its ruling on\nthe record, defendant‘s attorney clarified his objection. He said, ―There is no\nquestion that we raised it and that it was proper to discuss future dangerousness.‖\nInstead, he meant to object that questions about material in psychiatric reports\nwere beyond her area of expertise.\n       This concession fatally undermines defendant‘s challenge to the cross-\nexamination on future dangerousness. (People v. Partida, supra, 37 Cal.4th at\npp. 434-435.) In any event, the claim lacks merit. ― ‗While the prosecution is\nprohibited from offering expert testimony predicting future dangerousness in its\ncase-in-chief [citation], it may explore the issue on cross-examination or in\nrebuttal if defendant offers expert testimony predicting good prison behavior in the\nfuture. [Citations.]‖ (People v. Jones, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 1260.) Defendant\nraised the issue when he elicited testimony that ADHD prisoners treated with\n\n\n                                          83\n\fmedication and counseling exhibited ―a greater degree of safety‖ than was\notherwise expected of them. Having chosen to raise this subject, the defense could\nnot reasonably insulate it from cross-examination. (People v. Gates, supra, 43\nCal.3d at p. 1211.)\n       Defendant‘s challenge to cross-examination based on the DSM-IV is\nsimilarly unavailing. We rejected this same claim in People v. Seaton (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2524966\"><a href=\"/opinion/2524966/people-v-seaton/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 679-680. There, after a defense expert testified that the defendant\nsuffered an anxiety disorder and an atypical personality disorder, the prosecutor\nused the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to demonstrate on cross-examination\nthat defendant met the requirements for a diagnosis of antisocial personality\ndisorder. (Id. at p. 679.) We held this questioning was within the bounds of\nappropriate impeachment. (Id. at pp. 679-680; see People v. Mills, supra, 48\nCal.4th at p. 207 [―Because the defense experts relied on the DSM-IV to reach\ntheir opinions, the prosecutor was permitted to explore their familiarity with the\nDSM-IV on cross-examination‖].) Defendant attempts to distinguish Seaton and\nMills because those cases involved no dispute about the expert‘s qualification to\nrender a psychiatric opinion. He argues Dr. Candelaria-Greene was not qualified\nto diagnose antisocial personality disorder. However, defendant himself offered\nher expert diagnosis of ADHD based on the criteria in the DSM-IV. ―When, as\nhere, a mental health expert offers a diagnosis, this opens the door to rebuttal\ntestimony questioning that diagnosis or suggesting an alternative diagnosis.\n[Citation.]‖ (People v. Smith (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">35</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">334</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 359; see People v.

Nor do our cases require that\nprosecutors present alternate diagnoses through rebuttal testimony, instead of\ncross-examination. Either way, the evidence is permissible as impeachment of the\nexpert‘s opinion. (See People v. Daniels, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 884.) Finally, it\nwould be anomalous to hold that deficiencies in an expert‘s qualifications\n\n\n                                         84\n\fsomehow shield her opinions from vigorous testing on cross-examination. Indeed,\nthose deficiencies were themselves an appropriate topic of cross-examination.\n(Evid. Code, § 721, subd. (a).)27\n       4.     Prosecutorial Misconduct\n       Defendant claims the prosecutor committed several acts of misconduct,\nviolating his rights to a fair trial and penalty determination. ―Improper comments\nby a prosecutor require reversal of a resulting conviction when those comments so\ninfect a trial with unfairness that they create a denial of due process. [Citations.]\nConduct by a prosecutor that does not reach that level nevertheless constitutes\nmisconduct under state law, but only if it involves the use of deceptive or\nreprehensible methods to persuade the court or jury. [Citation.]‖ (People v.\nWatkins (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1031.) None of the challenged incidents\nconstitutes prejudicial misconduct.\n              a.     Epithets\n       Defendant complains the prosecutor committed misconduct when he used\ntwo epithets. In opening statement, the prosecutor referred to defendant and\nPatterson as ―evil men.‖ Defendant objected the next day. The court sustained the\nobjection and directed the prosecutor not to use that characterization in the\nremainder of his opening statement. The second epithet occurred during the cross-\nexamination of Dr. Candelaria-Greene. The prosecutor asked a hypothetical\nquestion about assessing an unwilling subject, whom he referred to as a ―violent\njerk.‖ The court sustained defense counsel‘s objection and told the prosecutor to\nrephrase the question. The prosecutor then described in detail all the personality\n\n27     In his reply brief, defendant argues the court in its gatekeeper role has a\nduty to vet proffered expert opinions. (See Evid. Code, §§ 801-802; Sargon\nEnterprises, Inc. v. University of Southern California (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 769.)\nOnce again, defendant ignores that the challenged testimony was elicited on cross-\nexamination. The prosecutor did not ―proffer‖ Dr. Candelaria-Greene‘s opinion.\nRather, he impeached the opinions she offered on direct examination by\ndemonstrating that the records she reviewed supported an alternative diagnosis.\nWe need not further discuss defendant‘s analysis of the Sargon precedent.\n\n\n                                          85\n\fattributes he was referring to with the shorthand ―jerk.‖ The defense raised no\nfurther objection.\n       For a prosecutor‘s remarks to constitute misconduct, it must appear\nreasonably likely in the context of the whole argument and instructions that ― ‗the\njury understood or applied the complained-of comments in an improper or\nerroneous manner.‘ ‖ (People v. Centeno (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">659</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 667.) To the\nextent defendant‘s objections were preserved, the mild and fleeting descriptions\nhere do not rise to the level of misconduct. In People v. Zambrano (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2517801\"><a href=\"/opinion/2517801/people-v-zambrano/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1172, the prosecutor repeatedly called the defendant ― ‗evil‘ ‖ in\nclosing argument. We found no misconduct, noting that several more derogatory\nepithets have been found within the range of permissible argument. (Ibid.; see\ne.g., People v. Friend (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84 [defendant called an ― ‗insidious\nlittle bastard‘ ‖]; People v. Thomas (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1171490\"><a href=\"/opinion/1171490/people-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">489</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 537 [defendant called a\n― ‗perverted murderous cancer‘ ‖].) Similarly, in People v. Farnam, supra, 28\nCal.4th at page 168, we concluded opening statement descriptions of the defendant\nas ― ‗monstrous,‘ ‖ ― ‗cold-blooded,‘ ‖ and a ― ‗predator‘ ‖ were fair comment on\nwhat the prosecutor expected the evidence would show.\n       Moreover, the jury was instructed that opening statements are not evidence\nbut merely reflect counsel‘s prediction of what the evidence will show. With\nrespect to the hypothetical question that insinuated defendant was a ―jerk,‖ the\njury was also instructed that questions of counsel are not evidence. Considering\nthese admonitions, and the ample evidence of the murder‘s brutality and\ndefendant‘s callous behavior afterward, it is not reasonably likely that the\nprosecutor‘s description of him as ―evil‖ or a ―violent jerk‖ improperly inflamed\nthe jury. (See People v. Friend, supra, 47 Cal.4th at p. 84.)\n              b.     Closing Argument\n       Defendant claims the prosecutor committed misconduct three times in\nclosing argument by referencing facts not in evidence.\n\n\n\n\n                                         86\n\f       First, the prosecutor challenged Dr. Candelaria-Greene‘s credibility by\nobserving that her opinions contradicted those of many experts whose reports she\nhad reviewed. The experts who had evaluated defendant in person all concluded\nhis potential for future violence was high. In contrast, the prosecutor argued, Dr.\nCandelaria-Greene ―wouldn‘t even sit down with him face-to-face. Now[,]\nwhether that‘s a [sleight]-of-hand legal strategy or she didn‘t want to be in the\nsame room with him, don‘t know. But she wouldn‘t even sit in the same room\nwith him.‖\n       Defendant did not object to this statement and therefore forfeited a claim of\nmisconduct. ―As a general rule a defendant may not complain on appeal of\nprosecutorial misconduct unless in a timely fashion—and on the same ground—\nthe defendant made an assignment of misconduct and requested that the jury be\nadmonished to disregard the impropriety.‖ (People v. Samayoa (1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">795</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 841.)\n       The claim also fails on the merits. Defendant complains that the\nprosecutor‘s remarks about why Dr. Candelaria-Greene may have failed to meet\nwith defendant were pure speculation. But the challenged remarks were not\nphrased as assertions. By expressly stating that he did not know why the expert\nfailed to meet with defendant, the prosecutor conceded the reasons he was offering\nwere merely reasonable possibilities. His point was that no conceivable reason\njustified offering an opinion without an in-person evaluation. In context, it is not\nreasonably likely the jury would have misunderstood his comments as asserting a\ndefinitive reason for the lack of a face-to-face meeting.\n       Second, defendant contends the prosecutor implicitly attacked his character\nwhen he argued: ―Where are the family members? They‘re here in the\ncommunity; they‘re local; they‘re around. Where are they? Why didn‘t they\ncome in here and tell you something?‖ Because defendant did not object to these\nremarks, he forfeited any claim of error. (People v. Clark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at\np. 960.) Moreover, we have held that argument about the absence of a defendant‘s\n\n\n                                         87\n\ffamily members from trial does not constitute misconduct, but permissible\ncomment on the defendant‘s failure to call logical witnesses. (People v.\nZambrano, supra, 41 Cal.4th at pp. 1173-1174.) The argument here was within\nappropriate bounds.\n       Third, defendant complains the prosecutor‘s closing argument exaggerated\nthe pleasures of prison life. After describing the trauma Beeson‘s family endured,\nthe prosecutor compared the defendants‘ life in custody: ―They go on. They have\ntheir life in jail, their card games, their basketball games. . . . [¶] There‘s a social\nlife, their jobs, schools, educational opportunities.‖ Defense counsel objected at\nsidebar that no evidence had been presented on the conditions in state prison. The\ncourt sustained the objection but allowed the prosecutor to argue about evidence\nthat was presented on the conditions in CYA and county jail. When argument\nresumed, the prosecutor stated: ―You‘ve heard from evidence what life is like in\njail and what life is like in the California Youth Authority. You get to play sports,\nbasketball, card games, make home-made alcohol; there‘s marijuana, cookies, and\nenchiladas, canteen privileges. There are . . . telephones, there are letters, there are\nvisits. There‘s sex. You‘ve heard evidence that a full life exists behind bars.\nMaybe not the life . . . you would like to think of, but . . . if you get yourself a life\nsentence out of this trial, you get to have that institutional life, and you‘ve heard\nevidence about jail and about the California Youth Authority, and that includes all\nthose things, things to look forward to. Most of the same things that we all have in\nour lives now, although they‘re in a different form.‖ He then stressed that\ndefendants had taken all of these joys of life from Beeson and destroyed her\nfamily.\n       Although defendant objected, and his objection was sustained, he did not\nask the court to admonish the jury to disregard the prosecutor‘s argument.\nAccordingly, he forfeited this challenge on appeal. (People v. Redd (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2387024\"><a href=\"/opinion/2387024/people-v-redd/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 753.) In any event, it was unlikely the jury would have\nmisunderstood the prosecutor‘s initial argument to be about state prison\n\n\n                                           88\n\fconditions. After the sidebar, he repeatedly referenced specific evidence the jury\nhad heard about conditions in both CYA and county jail. Moreover, defense\ncounsel‘s final argument dispelled any prejudice that may have arisen. While not\npermitted to discuss any specific prison where defendant might be sent,\ndefendant‘s attorney argued that the prosecutor‘s ―country club theory‖ of prison\nlife ―never gives us any detail about such things as lack of freedom, lack of choice,\neven lack of basic privacy. With the toilet and wash basin in the cell, people have\nlikened it to living their entire lives in a bathroom.‖ He also described the small\nsize of the cell and the fact that defendant would have little contact with his family\nor the outside world.\n       Separately, defendant claims the court erred in allowing the prosecutor to\nargue that there was no evidence of an emotional disturbance. Killing while under\nthe influence of an extreme mental or emotional disturbance may be considered in\nmitigation under section 190.3, factor (d). In the course of discussing all\nmitigation factors, the prosecutor simply pointed out that no evidence had been\npresented in support of factor (d). Defendant does not dispute the truth of this\npoint but claims the argument implicitly suggested jurors could consider absence\nof the mitigating factor as a factor in aggravation. It is true that ―the absence of\nthis mitigating factor is not itself aggravating.‖ (People v. Riel (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1153</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1223; see People v. Davenport (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1206767\"><a href=\"/opinion/1206767/people-v-davenport/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">247</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 289-290.) However,\nthe prosecutor never invited the jury to draw this improper inference. On the\ncontrary, after arguing that no mitigating evidence had been presented regarding\ndefendant, the prosecutor stated: ―I want to be absolutely clear. I‘ve talked to you\nabout evidence has to be used in categories . . . . I‘ve talked to you about\naggravating factors. There is not an aggravating factor that in any way says lack\nof mitigation. So the fact that there‘s no mitigation for Norman Patterson, that is\nnot an aggravating factor. Okay. It‘s important that you apply this evidence\nproperly. . . . [¶] So the absence of mitigation is not an aggravating factor.‖ This\nargument was appropriate and the court did not err in allowing it.\n\n\n                                          89\n\f              c.     Rebuttal Argument\n       Defendant raises three complaints of misconduct in the prosecutor‘s\nrebuttal argument. Each of these claims was forfeited by lack of an objection and,\non the merits, fails to establish prejudicial misconduct.\n       First, defendant contends the prosecutor attacked the integrity of defense\ncounsel by pointing out their positions throughout the trial. He reminded jurors\nthat at the guilt phase defense counsel had argued defendant was innocent and had\nfalsely confessed. The prosecutor then observed, ―Now you are being told by the\nsame attorney for the same defendant, oh, well, he did do it. Okay. You guys are\nright. We tried to fool you last time.‖ Still speaking in the role of defense\ncounsel, the prosecutor said, ―It‘s as though it is whatever we can say to try and\nfool you and beat you. Whatever we can say to try and trick you into making a\nmistake as a jury, to get you to make the wrong decision that will favor the\ndefendants. [¶] We will say anything to you, anything whatsoever.‖ The\nprosecutor then briefly explained the concept of lingering doubt and stressed that it\nshould not apply because, in saying they did not contest the guilt phase verdict, the\ndefendants‘ lawyers were acknowledging their clients‘ guilt. He continued: ―So,\nto the extent that you heard arguments to the contrary at the end of the guilt phase,\nyou were being intentionally misled.‖ The prosecutor then urged jurors to be\nskeptical of defense counsel‘s penalty phase arguments, contending they would\nsay anything to persuade the jury to return the more lenient sentence.\n       Defendant failed to raise a timely objection to this argument and therefore\nforfeited his claim of misconduct. (People v. Gionis (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1163476\"><a href=\"/opinion/1163476/people-v-gionis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1215.)\nOn the merits, the remarks did not result in prejudicial error.\n       Personal attacks on the integrity of opposing counsel can constitute\nmisconduct. (People v. Espinoza (1992) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1155625\"><a href=\"/opinion/1155625/people-v-espinoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 820.) ―It is generally\nimproper for the prosecutor to accuse defense counsel of fabricating a defense\n[citations], or to imply that counsel is free to deceive the jury [citation]. Such\nattacks on counsel‘s credibility risk focusing the jury‘s attention on irrelevant\n\n\n                                          90\n\fmatters and diverting the prosecution from its proper role of commenting on the\nevidence and drawing reasonable inferences therefrom.‖ (People v. Bemore\n(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1316209\"><a href=\"/opinion/1316209/people-v-bemore/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">809</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 846.) However, ―the prosecutor has wide latitude in\ndescribing the deficiencies in opposing counsel‘s tactics and factual account.‖\n(Ibid.)\n          The prosecutor‘s remarks here highlight the inconsistency in defense\ncounsel‘s positions about the truth of the confession. Although counsel nominally\naccepted the jury‘s verdict that defendant gave a true confession, he argued the\npolice had promised defendant he could avoid the death penalty by confessing and\ntold the jury, ―You, in fact, are the only ones who can give Grayland the benefit of\nhis bargain . . . .‖ We have upheld prosecutorial arguments suggesting defense\ncounsel‘s ―job‖ is to confuse the jury and say anything necessary to obtain a\nfavorable verdict. (See People v. Gionis, supra, 9 Cal.4th at pp. 1216-1217;\nPeople v. Bell (1989) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1298608\"><a href=\"/opinion/1298608/people-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538.) Although the remarks here were\nsomewhat harsher, in that the prosecutor characterized counsel‘s arguments as\nintentionally misleading, he did not claim defense counsel had fabricated a defense\nor deceived the jury about the evidence they were to consider. (See People v.\nClark, supra, 52 Cal.4th at p. 961.) In any event, even if the comments were\nunfair to defense counsel, they ―did not comprise a pattern of egregious\nmisbehavior making the trial fundamentally unfair.‖ (People v. Espinoza, supra, 3\nCal.4th at p. 820.) Nor was it reasonably possible they affected the verdict. (See\nPeople v. Peoples (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 804; People v. Abilez (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2599854\"><a href=\"/opinion/2599854/people-v-abilez/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 525-526.) Even though the remarks were directed against all of the defense\nlawyers,28 the jury reached different verdicts for defendant and Patterson.\n          Next, defendant claims the prosecutor improperly asked jurors to place\nthemselves in the victim‘s position and argued the facts of other cases.\n\n\n28    Defendant and Patterson were each represented by two attorneys\nthroughout the trial.\n\n\n                                          91\n\fDefendant‘s attorney had argued Beeson‘s death was merely an impulsive murder\nand not ―the worst of the worst,‖ such as a terrorist bombing, sniper killing, or one\ninvolving kidnapping or sexual assault. In response, the prosecutor asked the jury\nto imagine the experience of someone murdered by a bomb or a sniper. Those\nvictims are instantaneously killed and ―never knew what hit them.‖ Then he asked\nthe jury to think about everything Beeson experienced: being held down on the\nfloor, hit in the face with a shotgun, ―having a belt put around your neck . . . .\nhaving two men holding you down on the floor with their knees and each one has\nan end on that belt and they are pulling and yanking . . . . [¶] Think about fighting\nfor your life because you want to live.‖ He then argued Beeson suffered more\nthan the 167 people who died instantly in the Oklahoma City bombing. After the\ncourt sustained an objection to argument about other cases, the prosecutor\nrephrased his point only slightly, stating, ―She suffered more than a hundred\nvictims suffered in a bomb blast . . . .‖ Finally, he asked the jury to think about\nhow painful the stabbing must have been and how frightened Beeson must have\nfelt.\n        Defendant now argues it was misconduct for the prosecutor to suggest that\njurors adopt Beeson‘s position. Because he did not object below, however, the\ntrial court had no opportunity to consider the objection, admonish the jury, or\ncurtail argument along these lines. (See People v. Bemore, supra, 22 Cal.4th at\npp. 845-846.) A failure to object and request an admonition will be excused only\nif an objection would have been futile or an admonition would not have cured the\nharm. (People v. Cole (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2590164\"><a href=\"/opinion/2590164/people-v-cole/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1158</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201.) Defendant has shown\nneither; therefore the objection is forfeited on appeal. (People v. Redd, supra, 48\nCal.4th at p. 753.)\n        The claim also fails on the merits. Although it is inappropriate at the guilt\nphase for a prosecutor to appeal to sympathy by inviting the jury to view the case\nthrough the victim‘s eyes (People v. Leonard (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632907/people-v-leonard/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1406-1407),\nsuch appeals are entirely appropriate at the penalty phase. (People v. Wash, supra,\n\n\n                                          92\n\f6 Cal.4th at p. 263.) The prosecutor encouraged jurors to think closely about the\nsuffering Beeson endured during defendants‘ long and brutal attack in response to\ndefense counsel‘s minimization of the murder as a ―rash, impulsive killing with\nweapons at hand.‖ ― ‗To the extent that the argument was inviting the jurors to put\nthemselves in the shoes of the victim, we have found such an appeal appropriate at\nthe penalty phase because there ―the jury decides a question the resolution of\nwhich turns not only on the facts, but on the jury‘s moral assessment of those facts\nas they reflect on whether defendant should be put to death. . . . In this process,\none of the most significant considerations is the nature of the underlying crime.\n[Citation.] Hence assessment of the offense from the victim‘s viewpoint would\nappear germane to the task of sentencing.‖ ‘ ‖ (Id. at pp. 263-264; see People v.\nLewis (1990) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2611109\"><a href=\"/opinion/2611109/people-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 283-284.) Nor did the prosecutor‘s argument\nencourage the jury to subordinate their reason to emotion. (See Wash, at p. 264.)\n       Finally, defendant complains the prosecutor ignored the court‘s ruling when\nhe revised his comparison to the Oklahoma City bombing to describe a generic\nbombing with ―a hundred‖ victims. Defendant did not renew his objection, thus\nforfeiting his claim on appeal. (People v. Redd, supra, 48 Cal.4th at p. 753.) In\nany event, this brief reference to bombing victims did not rise to the level of\nmisconduct. Although the precise crime the prosecutor had in mind was clear\nfrom his previous statement, he technically complied with the court‘s ruling by\nrephrasing his remark to refer to a generic bombing. No misconduct occurred.\n              d.     Cumulative Prejudice\n       Defendant argues that even if individual acts of prosecutorial misconduct\nwere not prejudicial, the incidents considered together were so cumulatively\nprejudicial as to require reversal. Although we observed that some statements in\nthe prosecutor‘s rebuttal argument bordered on misconduct, they did not render the\ntrial unfair or prejudice defendant. None of the other challenged statements\nconstituted misconduct. Accordingly, there was no prejudice to accumulate.\n\n\n\n\n                                         93\n\f       5.     Refusal to Modify Death Sentence\n       Defendant claims the court erred in denying his automatic motion to\nmodify the death verdict. (§ 190.4, subd. (e).) In ruling on such a motion, ―the\ntrial court must reweigh independently the evidence of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances and then determine whether, in its independent judgment, the\nweight of the evidence supports the jury‘s verdict. [Citations.] The trial court\nmust ‗consider, take into account, and be guided by‘ the aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances referred to in section 190.3.‖ (People v. Crittenden,\nsupra, 9 Cal.4th at p. 150.) ―On appeal, we review the trial court‘s ruling\nindependently, but it is not our role to redetermine the penalty in the first instance.\n[Citations.]‖ (People v. Gamache (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2523859\"><a href=\"/opinion/2523859/people-v-gamache/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 403.)\n       Defendant complains the court ―either minimized the mitigating factors or\nignored them, while at the same time exaggerating the aggravating factors and\ngiving them undue weight.‖ The assertion is meritless. The court‘s extensive\nruling, spanning 46 pages of reporter‘s transcript, meticulously examines all the\nevidence presented on each relevant sentencing factor. The court discussed the\nevidence in an even-handed manner. It independently and reasonably concluded\nthat aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating circumstances and the\njury‘s verdict was supported by ―the overwhelming weight of the evidence.‖\n       Defendant finds fault with only one specific sentence in this voluminous\nrecord. He notes that, when describing the facts leading up to the murder, the\ncourt stated that defendant ―coveted a gun to use in committing robberies, perhaps\nin committing murders.‖ Defendant asserts this statement included improper\nspeculation because there was no evidence he wanted a gun to commit murder.\nThe evidence was undisputed that defendant sought a gun to commit robberies.\nThe court qualified its statement about murders by noting that ―perhaps‖ defendant\nwanted the gun for this purpose as well, and this was a reasonable inference to be\ndrawn from testimony that defendant was not opposed to killing bystanders during\nrobberies. This brief inference from the evidence does not undermine the court‘s\n\n\n                                          94\n\fcareful, independent, thorough review of the evidence, which we conclude is\namply supported by the record.\n       6.     Cumulative Error\n       Defendant claims that even if the alleged errors were individually harmless,\nthey were cumulatively prejudicial. We found that stationing a deputy at the\nwitness stand during defendant‘s testimony unsupported by case-specific reasons\nwas error, but harmless. In addition, while noting the claim was not preserved, we\nalso found harmless any assumed misconduct arising from the prosecutor‘s\nrebuttal argument. There are no additional errors, assumed or otherwise, to\naccumulate.\n       7.     Imposition of Death Penalty for Felony Murder\n       Defendant was eligible for the death penalty because the jury found that he\nmurdered Beeson in the course of a robbery. ―The felony-based special\ncircumstances do not require that the defendant intend to kill.

Delay in Processing Death Penalty Appeals\n       Defendant was sentenced to death in June 2003. Almost nine years later,\nafter delays in the appointment of appellate counsel and correction of the record,\nhe filed his opening brief on appeal. Defendant argues the delay in processing his\nappeal violates international norms as well his constitutional rights to due process,\nequal protection, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment. We have\nconsistently rejected this claim, explaining that ―the automatic appeal process\nfollowing judgments of death is a constitutional safeguard, not a constitutional\ndefect [citations], because it assures careful review of the defendant‘s conviction\nand sentence [citation].‖ (People v. Anderson, supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 606.)\nMoreover, while we remain sensitive to the evolution of Eighth Amendment\ndoctrine, we recently found no factual basis for concluding that systemic delays\nrender California‘s capital punishment scheme arbitrary and capricious.

Once again, we hold as\nfollows:\n       Section 190.2 adequately narrows the category of death-eligible defendants\nand is not impermissibly overbroad under the requirements of the Fifth, Sixth,\nEighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.

(Batson v. Kentucky (1986) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Batson); People v.

(People\nv. DeHoyos [(2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 107], italics added.)‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at\np. 37.) This statement appears in tension with how the United States Supreme\nCourt has conducted comparative juror analysis in three significant cases. (See\nFoster v. Chatman (2016) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">578</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\"></span></span><pre class=\"inline\">__, __–__ [</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In all three cases, the prosecutor gave more than one\nreason for each contested strike, and the high court, even when conducting\ncomparative juror analysis for the first time on appeal, drew inferences of\ndiscrimination by comparing struck and seated jurors with respect to one or more\nof the stated reasons considered individually. The high court has not required ― ‗a\nsubstantially similar combination of responses,‘ in all material respects‖ (maj.\nopn., ante, at p. 37), in order to find comparisons between excused and seated\njurors on a particular characteristic to be probative of discrimination. Indeed, the\ndissent in Miller-El argued that ― ‗ ―[s]imilarly situated‖ does not mean matching\nany one of several reasons the prosecution gave for striking a potential juror — it\nmeans matching all of them‘ ‖ (Miller-El, at p. 291 (dis. opn. of Thomas, J.)), but\n\fthe high court expressly rejected that view (id. at p. 247, fn. 6). On this point, as\nwith earlier aspects of our case law on comparative juror analysis, our approach\nappears out of step with controlling authority and ripe for reconsideration. (Cf.\nPeople v. Lenix (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 622 [abandoning, in light of Snyder and\nMiller-El, our rule in People v.

(See Wheeler, supra, 22 Cal.3d\nat p. 281.)‘ ‖ (Maj. opn., ante, at p. 26.) To the extent this statement authorizes\ntrial judges to rely on personal knowledge of the prosecutor or experience with the\nprosecutor‘s office, I believe it may go too far. We have almost never relied on\nsuch a basis for upholding a trial court‘s Batson ruling (one minor exception is\nPeople v. DeHoyos, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115), and there is good reason not to do\nso.\n       Adkins v.

A few weeks later, the trial court discovered the juror was married.\nThe prosecutor submitted an affidavit explaining that he did not learn until ― ‗long\nafter the trial and upon reading the transcript‘ ‖ that the juror was actually married.\n(Id. at p. 1245.) The trial court relied on its ―own personal experience with the\nprosecutor in other cases‖ to conclude that this explanation was credible: ―This\nCourt having worked with District Attorney Davis on many other cases in the past,\nfinds that he has never intentionally misrepresented any fact to this Court to gain\nan advantage in a criminal proceeding. He has many times admitted facts which\n\n                                           2\n\fwere to the detriment of his cases and accepted the consequences of facts that were\nagainst his case. This Court has never found District Attorney Davis to\npurposefully exclude blacks from juries in cases prosecuted by him. The Court\nfinds his statement as to mistaken belief as to the marital status of jury [sic] Morris\nto be credible.‖ (Id. at p. 1246 & fn. 3.)\n       The Eleventh Circuit rejected this approach. In addition to finding that the\ntrial court erred in relying on the prosecutor‘s declaration because the defendant\nhad no opportunity to rebut it, the appellate court disapproved of the trial court‘s\n―reli[ance] . . . on non-record evidence which Mr. Adkins did not have an\nopportunity to rebut, such as the trial court‘s personal experience with and opinion\nabout the reputation of the prosecutor.‖ (Adkins, supra, 710 F.3d at p. 1254.)\n―[T]here was no evidence presented during the Batson hearing about the\nprosecutor‘s reputation, other than assertions of good faith by the prosecutor.\nNeither was there evidence of the prosecutor‘s use of peremptory strikes against\nblacks in other criminal proceedings. It was therefore not reasonable for the trial\ncourt to interject non-record facts into its Batson analysis. Importantly, as with the\nprosecutor‘s affidavit itself, Mr. Adkins did not have notice or an opportunity to\nbe heard on these matters.‖ (Id. at p. 1254, fn. 11.)\n       The Seventh Circuit has similarly rejected a trial court‘s reliance on such\npersonal knowledge.
