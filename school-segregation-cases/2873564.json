They raise a host of contentions on appeal, including\n\n\n                                   5\n\fprimarily a challenge to the District Court’s jury instruction regarding\nthe Hobbs Act’s requirement that the covered misconduct have\naffected commerce. We find none of Appellants’ contentions\nsufficient to support overturning their convictions. We will, however,\nvacate their sentences in light of the United States Supreme Court’s\nrecent decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), and\nremand to the District Court for resentencing in accordance with that\ndecision.\n\n                                   I.\n\n        Appellants Thomas Urban, Joseph J. O’Malley, Joseph R.\nLeone, Gerald S. Mulderig, Fred Tursi, James F. Smith, William C.\nJackson and Stephen M. Rachuba were plumbing inspectors\nemployed by the Construction Services Department (“CSD”), a\ndivision of the Department of Licenses and Inspections (“L&I\nDepartment”) of the City of Philadelphia. The L&I Department is a\nregulatory agency charged with construction inspections and business\nregulatory affairs. The CSD is responsible for issuing all construction\npermits and performing construction inspections. Appellants were\ntasked with performing the plumbing component of these inspections,\nand were expected to enforce the city plumbing code in order, among\nother things, to ensure the safety of the city drinking water.\nAppellants were assigned to districts. Plumbers were required to call\nthe offices of the district in which their job was located to set up an\nappointment with an inspector. Appellants had discretion to decide\nwhen to perform the inspection. In performing inspections and\nenforcing the plumbing code, Appellants had the power to cite\nviolations of the code, issue stop work orders on projects, and revoke\nthe license of any plumber who failed to comply with the code.\n\n      In the late 1990s, law enforcement became aware that\nplumbing inspectors were accepting monetary payments from\n\n\n                                   6\n\fplumbers whose work they inspected, or claimed to have inspected.\nIn the course of its investigation into this practice, the FBI\ninterviewed several confidential sources – designated as CS1, CS2\nand CS3, respectively – who had worked as plumbing inspectors\nalongside Appellants, or as plumbers whose work Appellants had\ninspected. An affidavit executed by an FBI agent, filed by the\ngovernment in support of a request to install hidden cameras in city\nvehicles which would be used by suspected plumbing inspectors,\ndetailed statements given by these confidential sources. CS1, a\nformer plumbing inspector from 1992 to 1997, stated that 70%-80%\nof the plumbing contractors whose work he inspected during that time\nperiod “provided him with a cash ‘tip’ of $5 to $20 in return for his\ninspection and for allowing the contractor to work without\ninterference.” CS1 stated that he made an additional $3,000 to\n$6,000 per year from these “tips,” and that acceptance of “tips” was\ncommonplace among the L&I Department’s plumbing inspectors.\nCS1 believed that plumbing inspectors, including specifically many\nof the Appellants, “regularly accept[ed] ‘tips’ while working in their\nofficial capacity as City inspectors[.]”\n\n        CS2, a small plumbing contractor who had allegedly\ninteracted with plumbing inspectors through a third party, stated that\nhe provided money used to pay a plumbing inspector named “Tursi”\nin 1999 and on at least ten prior occasions. CS3, a large general\nplumbing contractor who worked with several plumbing\nsubcontractors, stated that he was told by his subcontractors that\npayments were made to an inspector named “O’Donnell” and his\nreplacement named “Smith.” The affidavit also stated that the affiant\nhad interviewed a “cooperating witness” who had “made consensual\nrecordings of L&I plumbing inspector Fred Tursi allegedly extorting\nmoney from him.” This cooperating witness advised that he had\ngiven $50 to his plumbers to give to Tursi to “keep him off their\nbacks.”\n\n\n                                  7\n\f        On the strength of this information, the government sought\nand obtained from the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania an order authorizing the installation of\nhidden video cameras in two city vehicles which would be used by\ncertain of the Appellants while on official city business. Video\ncaptured by these cameras apparently showed Appellants Jackson,\nLeone, O’Malley, Rachuba and Smith accepting cash on numerous\noccasions from plumbers during the course of conducting inspections;\nin many instances, Appellants apparently accepted cash payments\nwithout performing any inspection at all.\n\n        On March 19, 2002, a grand jury in the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania returned an indictment of 13 plumbing inspectors,\nincluding Appellants, charging them with a violation of RICO, 18\nU.S.C. § 1962, and multiple counts of Hobbs Act extortion, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951. A five-week trial ensued in early\nSeptember 2002. At trial, the government presented evidence\nshowing that multiple plumbers made numerous monetary payments\nof varying sizes to each of the Appellants. Plumbers testified that\nthey paid inspectors anywhere from $5 to $200 per inspection. There\nwas ample evidence at trial that plumbers paid inspectors in order to\nensure timely and favorable inspections,1 and to prevent unfavorable\ntreatment or harassment by inspectors. One plumber testified that\n“We felt like if you didn’t do what was, what had been going on for\nyears, you certainly would not see, you may not see an inspector\n\n       1\n         Numerous plumbers testified that because of labor and\nequipment costs, any idle time between the completion of a project\nand the performance of an inspection harmed their business. It was\ntherefore essential that plumbing inspectors arrive as soon as a project\nwas completed, and that they perform the inspection of that project as\nrapidly as possible so that the plumbers could move on to their next\nproject.\n\n                                   8\n\fshowing up when you want him[,]” while another testified that he\npaid inspectors because “[y]ou didn’t want to get on the bad side of\nthe inspector.” Other plumbers testified that they paid inspectors\nbecause they could not afford to find out if they would be treated\ndifferently by the inspectors if they did not pay. Plumber Richard\nClements testified that failing to tip could result in an inspector who\nwould “give me a hard time, or I wouldn’t get the prompt service.”\nYet another plumber testified that when Appellant Tursi asked him\nfor a larger tip than offered, he complied because “I felt as though\nthere would be some kind of problem if I didn’t do it.”\n\n         The government presented substantial evidence demonstrating\nthat Appellants knew that it was improper to accept monetary\npayments from plumbers whose work they were inspecting, thus\nundermining Appellants’ view that they were voluntarily (and\ntherefore properly) accepting “tips.” Each Appellant was required, at\nthe time of hiring, to sign an ethics statement acknowledging that he\nwas not permitted to accept “any offer, any gift, favor or service that\nmight tend to influence” him in the discharge of his duties. Every\ninspector hired between 1980 and 2000 – including all of the\nAppellants – was told that it was against city policy for employees to\ntake any cash in any amount at any time. An ethics directive from the\nMayor of Philadelphia permitted City employees to accept up to $100\nin gifts per year from any one source, but expressly disallowed their\nacceptance of cash in any amount.\n\n        Evidence of how Appellants accepted the plumbers’ payments\nreinforced the government’s contention that Appellants knew the\npayments were improper. Plumbers concealed the payments to\nAppellants in the pages of their work permit or by folding it up and\ntransferring the money in what was commonly referred to as a “green\nhandshake.” In a conversation taped by a cooperating witness and\nplayed for the jury, Appellant Mulderig explained that “every time\n\n\n                                  9\n\fthey hand me a permit I, I used to fold it over like that and then put\nit in my pocket, you know what I mean. ... when I would go to like\nBoston Market or something for lunch I would go in the men’s room\nand take it out and put it in my, you know, take the money out of\nthere and put it in my pocket.” Moreover, video taken by the hidden\ncameras in the city vehicles apparently revealed numerous instances\nof Appellants surreptitiously receiving the payments and endeavoring\nto keep the payments hidden.\n\n        In support of the Hobbs Act’s requirement that any\nextortionate conduct have an effect on commerce, the government\npresented evidence that each Appellant accepted tips from plumbers\nwho purchased supplies made out-of-state, i.e., outside of\nPennsylvania. Many of these same plumbers, however, testified that\nthe payments they made to Appellants did not affect their ability to\nmake out-of-state purchases.\n\n       On October 18, 2002, the jury convicted all Appellants except\nWilliam Jackson of the RICO charges, and all Appellants of the\nHobbs Act extortion charges. The District Court imposed varying\nsentences on Appellants, ranging from twelve months of home\nconfinement to thirty-four months’ imprisonment, as well as fines,\nassessments and probation. These eight, timely, consolidated appeals\nfollowed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n        The District Court properly exercised subject matter\njurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction\nover the judgments of conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and\nover the sentences pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742. Appellants raise a\nnumber of challenges to their convictions which we will address\nseriatim.\n\n\n                                 10\n\fA.     Appellants’ challenges to the jury instructions’ formulation of\n       the Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce requirement and the\n       sufficiency of the government’s evidence of such effect.\n\n        Appellants’ primary arguments on appeal challenge the\nformulation of the Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce element in the\nDistrict Court’s jury instructions, as well as the sufficiency of the\nevidence adduced by the government to prove such effect. The\nHobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), provides:\n\n       Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\n       affects commerce or the movement of any article or\n       commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or\n       attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or\n       threatens physical violence to any person or property\n       in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in\n       violation of this section shall be fined under this title\n       or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).\n\n       In pertinent part, the District Court instructed the jury as\nfollows on the Hobbs Act charges:\n\n       You do not even have to find that there was an actual\n       effect on commerce. All that is necessary to prove\n       this element is that the natural consequences of the\n       extortion – of the money payment, potentially caused\n       an effect on interstate commerce to any degree,\n       however minimal or slight. Payment from a business\n       engaged in interstate commerce satisfies the\n       requirement of an effect on interstate commerce. If\n       the resources of a business are expended or\n\n\n                                  11\n\f        diminished as a result of the payment of money, then\n        interstate commerce is affected by such payment and\n        may reduce the assets available for purchase of goods,\n        services or other things originating in other states.\n\n        Under this instruction, the jury could convict even if it did not\nfind that Appellants’ extortionate acts actually affected commerce, so\nlong as it concluded that the “natural consequences” of the\nextortionate acts “potentially caused” just a “minimal” effect on\ninterstate commerce. The jury was instructed to find this standard\nsatisfied upon proof of a “[p]ayment” made by plumbers “engaged in\ninterstate commerce,” which payment “diminished” the plumbers’\n“resources,” i.e., by proof of a “depletion of assets.”\n\n        Appellants explicitly challenge the jury instruction’s statement\nthat proof of a “potential” effect on commerce is sufficient to prove\nthe effect on commerce element under the Hobbs Act, and implicitly\nchallenge the jury instruction’s statement of the depletion of assets\ntheory. In Appellants’ view, the reference to “potential” effect is\nflawed because the Hobbs Act speaks in action verbs – “obstructs,\ndelays or affects commerce” – and conduct which merely has the\n“potential” to affect commerce does not actually obstruct, delay or\naffect commerce. Appellants also argue that after a series of Supreme\nCourt decisions between 1995 and 2000 construing the Commerce\nClause, it would be constitutionally doubtful to interpret the Hobbs\nAct as applying to conduct which merely potentially affects\ncommerce. Appellants further contend that the so-called “depletion\nof assets” theory – whereby proof that a Hobbs Act violation depletes\nthe assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce conclusively\nestablishes the effect on commerce requirement – was incorrectly\napplied here in light of the plumbers’ testimony that the payments\nthey made to Appellants did not in fact affect their ability to engage\nin interstate commerce. We read this latter contention as a challenge\n\n\n                                   12\n\fto both the jury instruction’s formulation of the depletion of assets\ntheory, and to the sufficiency of the government’s evidence of effect\non commerce by way of the depletion of assets theory.\n\n        To the extent that Appellants challenge the District Court’s\ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act in formulating its jury instructions, or\nthe fidelity of its interpretation and instructions to the United States\nConstitution, we exercise plenary review. United States v. Singletary,\n268 F.3d 196, 198-99 (3d Cir. 2001) (citations omitted); Gibbs v.\nCross, 160 F.3d 962, 964 (3d Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). In\nreviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we “must\ndetermine whether, viewing the evidence most favorably to the\ngovernment, there is substantial evidence to support the jury’s guilty\nverdict.” United States v. Idowu, 157 F.3d 265, 268 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We “will sustain the\nverdict if ‘any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\nelements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.’ Thus, ‘a claim of\ninsufficiency of the evidence places a very heavy burden on an\nappellant.’” United States v. Dent, 149 F.3d 180, 187 (3d Cir. 1998)\n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n         A comprehensive review of our Hobbs Act precedent over the\npast thirty years compels us to reject Appellants’ challenges regarding\nthe Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce requirement and the depletion\nof assets theory of proving such an effect. We begin with United\nStates v. Mazzei, 521 F.2d 639 (3d Cir. 1975) (en banc). Mazzei, a\nPennsylvania state senator, engineered lease transactions between\nstate agencies and a private entity, B.M.I., Inc., and extorted payments\nfrom B.M.I. in connection with the transactions. He was convicted\nof two counts of Hobbs Act extortion. Mazzei argued on appeal that\nthe government had failed to satisfy the Hobbs Act’s effect on\ncommerce requirement because although B.M.I. was deemed to be\nengaged in interstate commerce, the lease transactions which\n\n\n                                  13\n\fconstituted the unlawful extortionate acts were local and did not\nthemselves affect interstate commerce. We rejected this argument,\naccepting instead the government’s contention that depletion of assets\nof an entity engaged in interstate commerce was enough, as “[t]his\nposition accord[ed] with our previous holdings that where the\nresources of an interstate business are depleted or diminished ‘in any\nmanner’ by extortionate payments, the consequent impairment of\nability to conduct an interstate business is sufficient to bring the\nextortion within the play of the Hobbs Act.” Mazzei, 521 F.2d at 642\n(citing United States v. Addonizio, 451 F.2d 49 (3d Cir. 1972); United\nStates v. Provenzano, 334 F.2d 678 (3d Cir. 1964)). We found that\nthe facts easily satisfied this standard. B.M.I.’s subsidiaries\n“purchase[d] materials in a number of states for use in manufacturing\nproducts sold in almost every state[,]” id., and the payments the\nsubsidiaries made diminished “funds available to B.M.I. for use in [ ]\ninterstate activities ... and its interstate business must to this extent be\ncurtailed.” Id. We “conclude[d] that the Hobbs Act may\nconstitutionally be construed to reach the indirect burdens placed on\ninterstate commerce by the extortionate activities alleged in this case\nand that such a construction of the statute accords with Congressional\nintent to proscribe extortion which ‘in any way or degree obstructs,\ndelays, or affects commerce.’” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n        In United States v. Cerilli, 603 F.2d 415 (3d Cir. 1979), we\nconsidered appeals of substantive and conspiracy convictions under\nthe Hobbs Act. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (the\n“Department”) leased equipment from private owners in order to\nperform snow removal, general road maintenance and repair\nresponsibilities. Defendants were Department employees who had\naccepted bribes from such private owners in exchange for leasing\ntheir equipment. The government established at trial “that all the\nlessors had bought fuel for their equipment that had travelled in\ninterstate commerce[,]” and that most of the lessors “had purchased\n\n\n                                    14\n\fequipment and/or supplies that had travelled in interstate commerce.”\nCerilli, 603 F.2d at 423.\n\n         On appeal, defendants argued that the evidence of interstate\ncommerce was insufficient to support their Hobbs Act convictions.\nWe disagreed, reiterating that “where the resources of an interstate\nbusiness are depleted or diminished in any manner by extortionate\npayments, the consequent impairment of ability to conduct an\ninterstate business is sufficient to bring the extortion within the play\nof the Hobbs Act.” Id. at 424 (quoting Mazzei, 521 F.2d at 642)\n(other citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We continued\nthat “[a]ll that is required to bring an extortion within the statute is\nproof of a reasonably probable effect on commerce, however\nminimal, as result of the extortion.” Id. (citations omitted). As in\nMazzei, we found that the government’s proof of depletion of assets\nof entities who purchased goods in interstate commerce satisfied this\nstandard. Id.\n\n        We then considered and rejected defendants’ argument in\nCerilli that the depletion of assets theory “should only be applied\nwhere the victim of the extortion is itself an interstate business.” Id.\nWe concluded that such a limited view of the Hobbs Act’s scope\nwould be “inconsistent with Congress’ purpose ‘to use all the\nconstitutional power Congress has to punish interference with\ninterstate commerce... .’” Id. (quoting Stirone v. United States, 361\nU.S. 212, 215 (1960)). We acknowledged that “the effect on\ninterstate commerce proven here is certainly not very large,” but made\nclear that “the Hobbs Act does not proscribe only those extortions\nthat have a large effect on commerce.” Id. We therefore affirmed the\nfollowing jury instruction given by the district court:\n\n       I instruct you instead that you may find interstate\n       commerce with the meaning of these instructions if\n\n\n                                  15\n\f       you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim\n       purchased goods in interstate commerce and that the\n       money was extorted from him; then, as a matter of\n       law, commerce was affected.\n\nId. at 424 n.11. Thus, Cerilli clearly endorsed the depletion of assets\ntheory under the Hobbs Act as formulated by the District Court here.2\n\n        Just last year, in United States v. Haywood, 363 F.3d 200 (3d\nCir. 2004), we reaffirmed our adherence to the depletion of assets\ntheory of proving a Hobbs Act effect on commerce, and announced\nthat proof of a “potential” effect is all that is required under the\nHobbs Act. Haywood had been convicted of a substantive Hobbs Act\nviolation for robbing a Virgin Islands tavern. A witness testified that\nthe defendant and his accomplice stole “approximately $40 to $60 in\nbills and approximately $10 in coins.” Haywood, 363 F.3d at 202.\nA Virgin Islands detective testified at trial that the tavern sold\nHeineken and Miller beer, both of which were shipped in “from the\nmainland United States.” Id. at 210. On appeal, Haywood contended\n“that the government did not produce sufficient evidence to show that\nthe bar purchased goods or services from outside the Virgin Islands.”\n\n       2\n         We reaffirmed Cerilli’s endorsement of the depletion of\nassets theory in United States v. Jannotti, 673 F.2d 578 (3d Cir. 1982)\n(en banc). There, we reinstated defendants’ Hobbs Act conspiracy\nconvictions following the district court’s grant of their motion for\njudgment of acquittal. In pertinent part, we observed that “[i]n\nsubstantive Hobbs Act convictions, the requisite nexus to interstate\ncommerce has been found in the depletion of assets theory, because\nthe payment of an extortion demand may reduce the assets available\nfor the purchase of goods originating in other states.” Jannotti, 673\nF.2d at 592-93 (citing Cerilli, 603 F.2d at 424) (other citation\nomitted).\n\n                                  16\n\fId. Haywood primarily contested the foundation of the detective’s\ntestimony concerning effect on commerce, arguing that the\ngovernment was required to adduce independent evidence such as an\ninvoice in order to prove that the tavern purchased supplies\noriginating in mainland United States. We rejected this argument.\nMore germanely, we also rejected Haywood’s contention “that there\nis no evidence to support the exercise of federal jurisdiction over\nwhat is really a territorial crime.” Id. at 211 n.7. Earlier in the\nopinion, in laying out the controlling Hobbs Act principles, we stated\nthat “[i]f the defendants’ conduct produces any interference with or\neffect upon interstate commerce, whether slight, subtle or even\npotential, it is sufficient to uphold a prosecution under [§ 1951].” Id.\nat 209-10 (citation omitted). We further noted that “[a] jury may infer\nthat interstate commerce was affected to some minimal degree from\na showing that the business assets were depleted.” Id. at 210 (citation\nomitted). Applying these principles, we found it “clear that interstate\ncommerce was affected, however minimally, because the bar sold\nHeineken and Miller beer that came from outside the Virgin\nIslands[,]” id. at 211 n.7, and because “the bar’s assets were depleted”\nby the robbery. Id.\n\n       There thus appears to be little doubt that our precedent\nsupports the District Court’s use of “potential” effect and its\nformulation of the depletion of assets theory in the jury instructions.3\n\n       3\n         Our view on these related issues in the context of substantive\nHobbs Act cases is in accord with the weight of authority in our sister\ncircuits. The majority of our sister circuits have endorsed the\n“potential” effect reading of the Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce\nrequirement. See United States v. Rivera Rangel, 396 F.3d 476, 482-\n83 (1st Cir. 2005) (“The Hobbs Act ... has ... been held to reach even\nthose effects which are merely potential or subtle.”) (quoting United\nStates v. Hathaway, 534 F.2d 386, 396 (1st Cir. 1976)); United States\n\n                                  17\n\fv. Lynch, 367 F.3d 1148, 1155 (9th Cir. 2004) (“interstate nexus\nrequirement is satisfied ‘by proof of a probable or potential impact’\non interstate commerce”) (citation omitted); United States v. Curtis,\n344 F.3d 1057, 1070 (10th Cir. 2003) (“We have repeatedly\ninterpreted the ‘broad language’ of the Hobbs Act to mean that for the\nGovernment to obtain a conviction under the Act, the evidence need\nshow only a potential or de minimis effect on interstate commerce.”)\n(citations omitted); United States v. Silverio, 335 F.3d 183, 186 (2d\nCir. 2003) (“effect upon interstate commerce, whether slight, subtle\nor even potential, [ ] is sufficient to uphold a prosecution under the\nHobbs Act.”) (citations omitted); United States v. Peterson, 236 F.3d\n848, 852 (7th Cir. 2001) (a “minimal potential effect on commerce is\nall that need be proven to support a conviction [under the Hobbs\nAct].”) (quoting United States v. Stillo, 57 F.3d 553, 558 n.2 (7th Cir.\n1995)); United States v. Brantley, 777 F.2d 159, 162 (4th Cir. 1985)\n(“jurisdictional predicate [of Hobbs Act] ... may be shown by proof\nof probabilities without evidence that any particular commercial\nmovements were affected.”); but see United States v. Williams, 308\nF.3d 833, 838 (8th Cir. 2002) (“the [Hobbs Act’s] plain language\nrequires an actual effect on interstate commerce, not just a probable\nor potential impact.”); United States v. Carcione, 272 F.3d 1297,\n1301 n.5 (11th Cir. 2001) (“A substantive violation of the Hobbs Act\nrequires an actual, de minimis affect on commerce.”) (citation\nomitted). It is unclear where the Sixth Circuit stands. Compare\nUnited States v. Wang, 222 F.3d 234, 237 (6th Cir. 2000) (“There is\nno requirement that there be an actual effect on interstate\ncommerce--only a realistic probability that [an offense] will have an\neffect on interstate commerce.”) (citation and internal quotation\nmarks omitted) with United States v. DiCarlantonio, 870 F.2d 1058,\n1061 (6th Cir. 1989) (“a substantive Hobbs Act violation requires an\nactual effect on interstate commerce”).\n\n\n                                  18\n\fAppellants counter with several arguments, none of which alter our\nview. First, Appellants invoke a trilogy of Supreme Court Commerce\n\n\n        There appears to be no disagreement among our sister circuits\nas to the propriety of the depletion of assets theory as a means of\nestablishing the Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce requirement. See,\ne.g., Curtis, 344 F.3d at 1070 (“Simply proving that a robbery\ndepleted the assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce will\nsuffice.”) (citation omitted); United States v. Williams, 342 F.3d 350,\n354-55 (4th Cir. 2003) (“Commerce is sufficiently affected under the\nHobbs Act where a robbery depletes the assets of a business that is\nengaged in interstate commerce.”) (citation omitted); United States\nv. Jamison, 299 F.3d 114, 120 (2d Cir. 2002) (“a robbery or extortion\nthat depletes the assets of a business operating in interstate commerce\nwill satisfy the jurisdictional requirement of the Hobbs Act by a\nminimal showing of effect on commerce.”) (citations omitted);\nUnited States v. Turner, 272 F.3d 380, 386-87 & n.2 (6th Cir. 2001);\nUnited States v. Diaz, 248 F.3d 1065, 1084-85 (11th Cir. 2001)\n(“Robberies or extortions perpetrated upon individuals are\nprosecutable under the Hobbs Act when ... the crime depletes the\nassets of an individual who is directly engaged in interstate\ncommerce”) (citations omitted); United States v. Bailey, 227 F.3d\n792, 798 (7th Cir. 2000) (under depletion of assets theory, “the\ngovernment shows that commerce is affected when an enterprise,\nwhich either is actively engaged in interstate commerce or\ncustomarily purchases items in interstate commerce, has its assets\ndepleted through extortion, thereby curtailing the victim’s potential\nas a purchaser of such goods.”) (citations and internal quotation\nmarks omitted); United States v. Hebert, 131 F.3d 514, 521 (5th Cir.\n1997) (defining required “effect on interstate commerce [for Hobbs\nAct purposes] as a depletion of the assets of a business that purchases\nout-of-state goods and supplies.”) (citations omitted); United States\nv. Bucci, 839 F.2d 825, 830 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n                                  19\n\fClause cases beginning with United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549\n(1995), and proceeding to United States v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598\n(2000) and Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848 (2000). Appellants\nargue that construing the Hobbs Act to require only proof of a\npotential effect would be constitutionally doubtful in light of this\ntrilogy of cases, thus compelling a strict construction of the Act as\nrequiring proof of an “actual effect” in order to avoid constitutional\ndoubt. But Appellants do not clearly articulate what would be\nconstitutionally doubtful about interpreting the Hobbs Act to require\nonly proof of a potential effect on commerce. We surmise that after\nthe Lopez-Morrison-Jones trilogy, the purported constitutional\ndoubtfulness of such a construction stems from those decisions’\nholdings that Congress may only regulate activities “having a\nsubstantial relation to interstate commerce .... i.e. those activities that\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce.... .” Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558-\n59. But we have already rejected the argument that Lopez and its\nprogeny require proof of a “substantial effect” on commerce in an\nindividual case in order to show a Hobbs Act violation. See United\nStates v. Clausen, 328 F.3d 708, 711 (3d Cir. 2003). In Clausen, we\nfollowed the lead of other circuits, including the Fifth Circuit, which\nhad held that after Lopez, “legislation concerning an intrastate activity\nwill be upheld if Congress could rationally have concluded that the\nactivity, in isolation or in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate\ncommerce.” See United States v. Robinson, 119 F.3d 1205, 1211 (5th\nCir. 1997); see also United States v. Bolton, 68 F.3d 396, 399 (10th\nCir. 1995) (“Lopez did not ... require the government to show that\nindividual instances of the regulated activity substantially affect\ncommerce to pass constitutional muster under the Commerce Clause.\nRather, the Court recognized that if a statute regulates an activity\nwhich, through repetition, in aggregate has a substantial affect on\ninterstate commerce, ... ‘the de minimis character of individual\ninstances arising under that statute is of no consequence.’”) (citing\nLopez, 514 U.S. at 558-59) (internal citations omitted) (ellipses\n\n\n                                    20\n\fadded) (emphasis omitted). With respect to the Hobbs Act\nspecifically, we stated in Clausen “‘that the cumulative result of many\nHobbs Act violations is a substantial effect upon interstate\ncommerce,’ and that substantial effect empowers Congress to regulate\npursuant to the Commerce Clause.” Clausen, 328 F.3d at 711\n(quoting Robinson, 119 F.3d at 1215)). Importantly, we held that\n“[i]n any individual case, proof of a de minimis effect on interstate\ncommerce is all that is required.” Id. (citations omitted). And, as we\nannounced recently in Haywood, such a “de minimis effect” in an\nindividual Hobbs Act case need only be “potential.” See Haywood,\n363 F.3d at 209-10 (citation omitted).\n\n        Appellants also suggest that contrary to our reading of\nJannotti, we held there that proof of an actual effect on commerce\nwas required under the Hobbs Act. We disagree. Appellants rely on\nour statement in Jannotti that “[a] substantive violation of the Hobbs\nAct generally is supported by proof of an actual effect on commerce.”\n673 F.2d at 591 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). But saying that\ncertain evidence “generally” supports a violation is not the same as\nsaying that only that evidence supports a violation.\n\n        Finally, Appellants contend that the jury instruction’s\nformulation of the depletion of assets theory created a mandatory\npresumption which improperly precluded the jury from considering\nevidence that commerce was not in fact affected by the plumbers’\npayments. As the precedent above makes clear, however, proof of\nextortion payments by a person or entity engaged in interstate\ncommerce is all the government needs to prove in order to satisfy the\nHobbs Act’s effect on commerce requirement, and the jury instruction\nfaithfully expressed this principle. It is conceivable that, as many of\nthe plumbers testified, the payments the plumbers made did not\nactually result in a reduction in their engagement in interstate\ncommerce – for example, the plumbers may have absorbed the cost\n\n\n                                  21\n\fof those payments by cutting their profits or by reducing their labor\nforce. But as we have repeatedly noted, the government need only\nprove that Hobbs Act extortion potentially affected commerce. Our\n“potential” effect reading of the Hobbs Act explains our continued\nadherence to the depletion of assets theory, because it is beyond cavil\nthat the depletion of assets of a person engaged in interstate\ncommerce has at least a “potential” effect on that person’s\nengagement in interstate commerce. Indeed, had the District Court\ninstructed the jury that, notwithstanding proof of depletion of assets\nof plumbers engaged in interstate commerce, it could nonetheless\nacquit if it credited those plumbers’ conclusory testimony that their\npayments to Appellants did not affect their ability to purchase\nsupplies made out-of-state, it would have misstated the law of this\nCircuit – extortion which depletes the assets of persons or businesses\nengaged in interstate commerce is, as a matter of law, a Hobbs Act\nviolation.\n\n        The above discussion leaves little work left to do in\naddressing Appellants’ argument that the government’s evidence of\ndepletion of assets of plumbers engaged in interstate commerce was\ninsufficient. The jury instruction’s formulation of the depletion of\nassets theory accords with our precedent. Appellants do not dispute\nthat there was ample evidence that Appellants took payments from\nvarious plumbers, and that each Appellant took payments from\nplumbers who were engaged in interstate commerce, i.e., who\npurchased supplies made out-of-state. This evidence is more than\nsufficient to establish the Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce\nrequirement. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court’s\ninstruction that proof of a “potential” effect on commerce via the\ndepletion of assets theory was correct, and that the government’s\nevidence was sufficient to support Appellants’ Hobbs Act convictions\npursuant to that instruction.\n\n\n\n                                  22\n\fB.      Appellants’ challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence that\n        they committed extortion “under color of official right”\n        within the meaning of the Hobbs Act.\n\n        Appellants (except for Leone) also challenge their Hobbs Act\nconvictions on grounds that the government’s evidence that they\ncommitted their extortion “under color of official right” was\ninsufficient. As noted, in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,\nwe “must determine whether, viewing the evidence most favorably to\nthe government, there is substantial evidence to support the jury’s\nguilty verdict.” Idowu, 157 F.3d at 268. We “will sustain the verdict\nif ‘any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\nof the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.’ Thus, ‘a claim of\ninsufficiency of the evidence places a very heavy burden on an\nappellant.’” Dent, 149 F.3d at 187.\n\n        The Hobbs Act defines “extortion” as “the obtaining of\nproperty from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of\nactual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.” 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). “Thus, the statute supports two\nclasses of extortion: extortion induced by ‘wrongful use of force’ and\nextortion ‘under color of official right.’” United States v. Antico, 275\nF.3d 245, 255 (3d Cir. 2001). Here, the government pursued the\n“under color of official right” theory of Hobbs Act extortion. In order\nto prove Hobbs Act extortion “under color of official right,” “the\nGovernment need only show that a public official has obtained a\npayment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment was\nmade in return for official acts.” Evans v. United States, 504 U.S.\n255, 268 (1992). In other words, the government need not prove that\nthe public official induced the making of the payment, or that the\npublic official acted or refrained from acting as a result of payments\nmade.\n\n\n\n                                   23\n\f         The government’s evidence here was more than sufficient to\nsupport a finding of extortion “under color of official right.” It was\nestablished at trial that the plumbing code conferred discretion on\nplumbing inspectors to require plumbers to redo a project even where\nthe project was technically code-compliant. Numerous plumbers\ntestified that it was important to minimize the extent to which they\nand expensive personnel and equipment were forced to wait around\nat a job site for an inspector to come and approve the work. These\nplumbers testified that they therefore made payments to Appellants\nbecause Appellants were plumbing inspectors and possessed authority\nwhich could be exercised to the plumbers’ detriment. One plumber\nwho made payments to Appellants testified that he made the\npayments because it made “the job run that much better,” made\n“things work easier,” and made “everything go much better.”\nAnother plumber, Andrew Kromchad, testified that after an incident\nin which Appellant Urban initially refused to allow him to finish a job\nby backfilling, he, Kromchad, began making payments to avoid\n“hassle.” When Mr. Kromchad asked Appellant Urban why he\ninitially refused to permit completion of the job, Urban responded\nthat Kromchad was like his old boss; Kromchad testified that what he\nbelieved Urban meant by this was that his old boss refused to “tip”\ninspectors. Yet another plumber, Michael Brescia, testified that he\n“felt as though there would be some kind of problem” if he did not\n“tip” the inspectors.\n\n         The government also adduced evidence demonstrating that\nAppellants had knowledge that they were receiving the plumbers’\npayments in return for favorable exercise of government authority.\nAt the time of hiring, plumbing inspectors were required to sign an\nethics statement whereby they agreed not to “accept, nor offer any\ngift, favor or service that might tend to influence me in the discharge\nof my duties.” There was testimony from a city personnel manager\nthat every plumbing inspector hired between 1980 and 2000 – a time\n\n\n                                  24\n\fperiod encompassing the dates of hire of each of the Appellants – was\ninstructed that they were not permitted to take money. The personnel\nmanager testified that the prohibition on taking money was reiterated\nat subsequent integrity training sessions. Coupled with the evidence\nconcerning the prohibition on taking money was ample evidence that\nAppellants did not receive the plumbers’ payments publicly, or at\nleast openly in public. Rather, plumbers would conceal the payments\ninside the pages of a permit or would fold up cash and transfer it by\nway of a “green handshake.”\n\n        Thus, the government adduced substantial evidence that:\n(1) plumbers made payments to Appellants knowing that Appellants\nwere public officials exercising governmental authority; (2) plumbers,\nknowing of the discretion in the plumbing code and desirous of\npunctual inspections, made payments in order to assure advantageous\nexercise of that government authority by Appellants; and\n(3) Appellants knew that the plumbers’ payments were made for an\nimproper purpose, i.e., the influencing of their governmental\nauthority. This evidence squarely supports the showing required to\nprove extortion “under color of official right” as explained by the\nSupreme Court in Evans. Contentions like Appellant Urban’s that\nthere was no evidence that he “failed to perform his job as a result of\nhis being tipped and no one claimed to have tipped [him] in exchange\nfor anything,” or like Appellant Mulderig’s that Appellants were not\ninfluenced by the plumbers’ payments, even if accurate, are\nunavailing. We therefore find that Appellants have failed to meet the\nstringent standard for overturning their Hobbs Act convictions on\ngrounds of insufficient evidence of extortion “under color of official\nright.”\n\n\n\n\n                                  25\n\fC.      Appellants’ challenges to their RICO convictions.\n\n        Appellants O’Malley, Rachuba, Tursi and Urban contend that\nthe government failed to prove that they directed the affairs of an\n“enterprise” as required to support a RICO conviction. Appellants\nalso argue that the government failed to prove the existence of an\n“enterprise” for purposes of their RICO convictions because the CSD\ncannot be such an “enterprise.” We reject these contentions.\n\n        Appellants were charged with violating § 1962(c) of RICO,\nwhich provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person employed\nby or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of\nwhich affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or\nparticipate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s\naffairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of\nunlawful debt.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). “To establish a § 1962(c)\nRICO violation, the government must prove the following four\nelements: ‘(1) the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate\ncommerce; (2) that the defendant was employed by or associated with\nthe enterprise; (3) that the defendant participated, either directly or\nindirectly, in the conduct or the affairs of the enterprise; and (4) that\nhe or she participated through a pattern of racketeering activity.’”\nUnited States v. Irizarry, 341 F.3d 273, 285 (3d Cir. 2003) (quoting\nUnited States v. Console, 13 F.3d 641, 652-653 (3d Cir. 1993)).\n\n        Appellants contend that the government failed to prove that\nthey directed the affairs of the CSD or participated in its operation or\nmanagement. In order to participate, directly or indirectly, in the\nconduct of an enterprise’s affairs for purposes of § 1962(c), “one\nmust have some part in directing those affairs.” Reves v. Ernst &\nYoung, 507 U.S. 170, 179 (1993). But “one need not hold a formal\nposition within an enterprise in order to ‘participate’ in its affairs.”\nUnited States v. Parise, 159 F.3d 790, 796 (3d Cir. 1998) (citing\n\n\n                                   26\n\fReves, 507 U.S. at 179). Moreover, “the ‘operation or management’\ntest does not limit RICO liability to upper management because ‘an\nenterprise is operated not just by upper management but also by\nlower-rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction\nof upper management.’” Parise, 159 F.3d at 796 (quoting Reves, 507\nU.S. at 184) (internal quotation marks omitted). Reves thus “made\nclear that RICO liability may extend to those who do not hold a\nmanagerial position within an enterprise, but who do nonetheless\nknowingly further the illegal aims of the enterprise by carrying out the\ndirectives of those in control.” Id.\n\n        We have applied Reves to limit RICO liability under § 1962(c)\nto those instances where there is “‘a nexus between the person and the\nconduct in the affairs of an enterprise.’” Parise, 159 F.3d at 796\n(quoting University of Maryland at Baltimore v. Peat, Marwick, Main\n& Co., 996 F.2d 1534, 1539 (3d Cir. 1993)). The government’s\nevidence sufficiently established the existence of such a nexus here\nsimply by demonstrating that the City employed Appellants to\nperform plumbing inspections and related work, and that Appellants\nin fact performed that work.\n\n         Appellants also argue that the government failed to prove the\nexistence of an “enterprise.” RICO defines “enterprise” as\n“includ[ing] any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or\nother legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in\nfact although not a legal entity[.]” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). In order to\nprove the requisite “enterprise,” we require proof “(1) that the\nenterprise is an ongoing organization with some sort of framework for\nmaking or carrying out decisions; (2) that the various associates\nfunction as a continuing unit; and (3) that the enterprise be separate\nand apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.” Irizarry,\n341 F.3d at 286 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                  27\n\f        Here, the government adduced evidence establishing each of\nthe three elements of “enterprise” set forth in Irizarry. There is no\ndispute that the CSD is “an ongoing organization with some sort of\nframework for making or carrying out decisions.” In order to prove\nthe second element – “associates function[ing] as a continuing unit”\n– we have said that the government must show “that each person\nperform[ed] a role in the group consistent with the organizational\nstructure established by the first element and which furthers the\nactivities of the organization.” United States v. Riccobene, 709 F.2d\n214, 223 (3d Cir. 1982), overruled on other grounds by Griffin v.\nUnited States, 502 U.S. 46 (1991)). Again, the government offered\nsufficient evidence to support this element. There is no question that\nAppellants worked for the “enterprise,” i.e., the CSD, and they did so\non a continuous basis, daily issuing permits and performing\ninspections of plumbing projects in Philadelphia. Finally, there is no\ndispute that the CSD was distinct from Appellants’ extortionate acts.\nThe CSD is an arm of the government of the City of Philadelphia\ncreated for the purpose of issuing permits for construction projects in\nPhiladelphia and overseeing those projects to ensure their compliance\nwith code regulations. There is no contention that the CSD was\ncreated and existed for the purpose of enabling Appellants’\nextortionate acts.\n\n        Appellants suggest that an “enterprise” can only be an “illegal\norganization,” and that therefore “an employment group [like the\nCSD] created by the City is definitely not an enterprise.” This\nmisstates the law under RICO. The plain text of RICO defines\nenterprise as, inter alia, a “legal entity[.]” See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).\nAnd we have frequently found government entities to be “enterprises”\nfor RICO purposes. See, e.g., Genty v. Resolution Trust Corp., 937\nF.2d 899, 906-07 (3d Cir. 1991) (holding that township can be an\n“enterprise” for RICO purposes) (citation omitted); Averbach v. Rival\nMfg. Co., 809 F.2d 1016, 1018 (3d Cir. 1987) (noting that court can\n\n\n                                  28\n\fbe an “enterprise”); United States v. Bacheler, 611 F.2d 443, 450 (3d\nCir. 1979) (holding that Philadelphia Traffic Court can be an\n“enterprise”); United States v. Frumento, 563 F.2d 1083, 1092 (3d\nCir. 1977) (holding that the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue’s\nBureau of Cigarette and Beverage Taxes was an “enterprise”).\n\n        Finally, Appellants assert that the government failed to prove\nan agreement among Appellants to participate in an enterprise\nthrough a pattern of racketeering activities. But Appellants were\ncharged with committing substantive RICO violations under 18\nU.S.C. § 1962(c), which does not require proof of any such\nagreement. See Parise, 159 F.3d at 794 (citation omitted).\nAccordingly, we find that the government adduced sufficient\nevidence to support Appellants’ RICO convictions, and will therefore\naffirm those convictions.\n\nD.     Appellants’ challenges to the sufficiency of the indictment\n       and the District Court’s denial of their motions for a bill of\n       particulars.\n\n         Appellants Jackson, O’Malley, Rachuba and Tursi argue that\nthe indictment failed to allege sufficient information enabling them\nto prepare a defense. They also contend that given the insufficiency\nof the indictment, the District Court erred in denying their motion for\na bill of particulars. We reject these challenges.\n\n        We deal first with the sufficiency of the indictment. We\nexercise plenary review over a challenge to the sufficiency of an\nindictment. United States v. Whited, 311 F.3d 259, 262 (3d Cir.\n2002) (citation omitted). An indictment must contain “a plain,\nconcise and definite written statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). “We\nconsider an indictment sufficient if, when considered in its entirety,\n\n\n                                  29\n\fit adequately informs the defendant of the charges against her such\nthat she may prepare a defense and invoke the double jeopardy clause\nwhen appropriate.” Whited, 311 F.3d at 262 (citations omitted).\n\n        The indictment here tracked the language of the Hobbs Act,\nstating that Appellants “knowingly and unlawfully obstructed,\ndelayed and affected commerce, and the movement of articles and\ncommodities in commerce, and attempted to do so, by extortion” by\n“unlawfully obtain[ing] and attempt[ing] to obtain property and\nthings of value.” The indictment further identified in chart form the\napproximate dollar amounts of the “things of value” (the payments\ntaken by Appellants) as well as the persons and businesses who made\nthe payments. In other words, the indictment informed Appellants of\nthe statute they were charged with violating, the elements of a\nviolation of that statute, the persons or businesses victimized, and the\ntime period during which the payments were made. As such, the\nindictment more than adequately informed Appellants of the charges\nleveled against them, and enabled them to prepare their defense and,\nif applicable, invoke the double jeopardy clause.\n\n        We also disagree with Appellants’ contention that the District\nCourt erred in denying their motions for a bill of particulars. We\nreview an order denying a motion for a bill of particulars for abuse of\ndiscretion. See United States v. Eufrasio, 935 F.2d 553, 575 (3d Cir.\n1991) (citation omitted). A bill of particulars is a “formal, detailed\nstatement of the claims or charges brought by a plaintiff or a\nprosecutor[.]” Black’s Law Dictionary 177 (8th ed. 2004). The\npurpose of a bill of particulars is “to inform the defendant of the\nnature of the charges brought against him, to adequately prepare his\ndefense, to avoid surprise during the trial and to protect him against\na second prosecution for an inadequately described offense.”\nAddonizio, 451 F.2d at 63-64. Only where an indictment fails to\nperform these functions, and thereby “significantly impairs the\n\n\n                                  30\n\fdefendant’s ability to prepare his defense or is likely to lead to\nprejudicial surprise at trial[,]” United States v. Rosa, 891 F.2d 1063,\n1066 (3d Cir. 1989) (citing Addonizio, 451 F.2d at 62-63), will we\nfind that a bill of particulars should have been issued.\n\n         As discussed above, the indictment provided more than\nenough information to allow Appellants to prepare an effective trial\nstrategy. Moreover, Appellants had access through discovery to the\ndocuments and witness statements relied upon by the government in\nconstructing its case, including trial evidence reflecting the dates of\npayments to Appellants and the approximate amounts of those\npayments.4 This access to discovery further weakens the case for a\nbill of particulars here. See United States v. Giese, 597 F.2d 1170,\n1180 (9th Cir. 1979) (“Full discovery ... obviates the need for a bill\nof particulars.”). The District Court therefore did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying Appellants’ motions for a bill of particulars.\n\nE.     Appellant Leone’s challenge to the District Court’s admission\n       of videotapes produced by hidden cameras installed in city\n       vehicles.\n\n       At trial, the government entered into evidence several\nvideotapes produced by cameras hidden inside city vehicles used by\nAppellants, including Appellant Leone.          Appellant Leone\nunsuccessfully moved to suppress the videotapes, and argues on\n\n       4\n        This evidence apparently included a computer program\nprepared by the government and provided to Appellants which\nenabled Appellants to determine how many inspections each\ninspector performed for each plumber during a specific time period,\nand to identify which of the inspectors had inspected the work of\nwhich plumbers who had stated that they made payments to\ninspectors.\n\n                                  31\n\fappeal that the District Court erred in refusing to grant his\nsuppression motion. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the\nDistrict Court’s denial of Appellant Leone’s suppression motion.\n\n        In February 2000, the government sought an order from the\nDistrict Court “to utilize CTV (no audio) to videotape the activities\nof the targeted plumbing inspectors in two City of Philadelphia\nvehicles while performing their daily work routine.” The affidavit\nsubmitted by the government in support of its request contained\nstatements given by several confidential sources during interviews\nwith the FBI. These statements detailed a relatively widespread\npractice by plumbing inspectors, including Appellants, of accepting\ncash payments from plumbers whose work they inspected. On\nFebruary 18, 2000, on the basis of the government’s affidavit, the\nHonorable William H. Yohn of the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued an order authorizing the\ninterception of visual, non-verbal conduct and activities pursuant to\nRule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the All\nWrits Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. Judge Yohn found that there was\nprobable cause to believe that Appellants, among others, were\ncommitting Hobbs Act violations, and found that there was probable\ncause to believe that particular visual, non-verbal conduct and\nactivities concerning these offenses would be obtained through video\nsurveillance installed in the vehicles. Judge Yohn ordered that the\ninterception end on the earlier of (a) thirty days from the date of the\norder or (b) when intercepted conduct or activity “reveals the manner\nin which these individuals and others as yet unknown participate in\nthe specified offenses and reveals the identities of their\ncoconspirators, their methods of operation, and the nature of the\nconspiracy[.]” Judge Yohn granted several subsequent applications\nby the government to extend the order beyond the original thirty days.\n\n\n\n\n                                  32\n\f        While on official inspection duty, Appellant Leone drove one\nof the cars in which a video camera had been installed. The video\ncamera captured numerous instances of Appellant Leone taking\nmoney from plumbers that had been placed between the pages of\npermits and putting it into his pocket despite not conducting any\ninspection of the project site. Appellant Leone argues that there was\nnot probable cause supporting the order authorizing the installation\nof the video cameras because the only information supporting the\norder was not particularized as to him as required by the Fourth\nAmendment.5 He also argues that the information contained in the\ngovernment’s affidavit did not create constitutionally sufficient\nprobable cause because it was stale, i.e., too much time had elapsed\nbetween the dates referenced by the confidential sources and the\nDistrict Court’s order authorizing the installation of the video\ncameras.\n\n        Appellant Leone’s contentions fail. Neither the Fourth\nAmendment nor the federal wiretap statute, Title III of the federal\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2510-2520,6 proscribes the interception and use of audio or visual\ndata of persons not specifically named in an application seeking\njudicial authorization of such interception. See United States v.\nDonovan, 429 U.S. 413, 435 (1977) (“It is not a constitutional\n\n\n       5\n        Leone contends that the government “agrees” that he “had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy in his work vehicle.” Nothing in\nthe government’s brief undermines this statement. Thus, we will\nassume that the operation of the video cameras installed in the\nvehicles amounted to a Fourth Amendment search and seizure\nrequiring the existence of probable cause.\n       6\n        We have assumed that Title III applies to video surveillance.\nSee United States v. Williams, 124 F.3d 411, 416 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n                                 33\n\frequirement that all those likely to be overheard engaging in\nincriminating conversations be named.”); United States v. Kahn, 415\nU.S. 143, 152-53 (1974) (rejecting interpretation of Title III requiring\napplication for judicial authorization to “identify all persons, known\nor discoverable, who are committing the offense and whose\ncommunications are to be intercepted.”) (internal quotation marks\nomitted); United States v. Tehfe, 722 F.2d 1114, 1117-18 (3d Cir.\n1983).7 As the Supreme Court explained in Donovan, so long as\nelectronic interception is justified by probable cause that the facility\nor property through or at which the intercepted communication takes\nplace is the means or situs of criminal activity, “the failure to identify\nadditional persons who are likely to be overheard engaging in\nincriminating conversations could hardly invalidate an otherwise\nlawful judicial authorization.” Donovan, 429 U.S. at 435.\n\n       Our decision in Tehfe illustrates these principles. It involved\na wiretap on a phone at an address denoted “22nd Street.” The\n\n        7\n         Our sister circuits agree. See, e.g., United States v.\nKillingsworth, 117 F.3d 1159, 1165 (10th Cir. 1997) (rejecting\ncontention that recording conversations of persons unidentified in\napplication for wiretap authorization violated Title III); United States\nv. Martin, 599 F.2d 880, 884 (9th Cir. 1979), overruled on other\ngrounds by United States v. DeBright, 730 F.2d 1255 (9th Cir. 1984)\n(“There is no constitutional requirement that the persons whose\nconversations may be intercepted be named in the application.”)\n(citing Donovan, 429 U.S. at 427 n.15); United States v. Hyde, 574\nF.2d 856, 862 (5th Cir. 1978) (“[W]e have never required that a\ndefendant be named in a wiretap application or accused of using the\nsuspected telephone before evidence obtained by the wiretap can be\nused against him. One of the objects of wiretapping is to ascertain the\nfull extent of participation in criminal activity, and we need not limit\nretrospectively the pool of potential defendants.”).\n\n                                   34\n\faffidavit supporting the wiretap detailed a drug distribution ring that\nincluded defendant Tehfe as one of its principals and sought\nauthorization to tap the phone of defendant Sanchez at 22nd Street.\nThe affidavit arguably did not specifically identify Sanchez as\nbelonging to or participating in the drug ring at issue. The wiretap\nproduced information supporting Sanchez’s arrest. The district court\ngranted Sanchez’s motion to suppress that information, noting that\nthe application seeking the wiretap did not contain evidence\nspecifically linking him to the illegal drug activity. We reversed,\nexplaining in pertinent part:\n\n        When reviewing an application, courts must also bear\n        in mind that search warrants are directed, not at\n        persons, but at property where there is probable cause\n        to believe that instrumentalities or evidence of crime\n        will be found. Zurcher v. Stanford Daily, 436 U.S.\n        547, 553-560, 98 S. Ct. 1970, 1975-1978, 56 L.Ed.2d\n        525 (1978). The affidavit in support of a warrant need\n        not present information that would justify the arrest of\n        the individual in possession of or in control of the\n        property. Nor is it required that the owner be\n        suspected of having committed a crime. Property\n        owned by a person absolutely innocent of any\n        wrongdoing may nevertheless be searched under a\n        valid warrant.\n\n722 F.2d at 1117-18 (citation omitted). We then applied these Fourth\nAmendment principles in Tehfe to wiretap authorizations, focusing\nnot on the persons specifically identified as participants in the illegal\nactivity, but rather on the facility (the 22nd Street phone) employed\nto further that illegal activity. Id. at 1118.\n\n\n\n\n                                   35\n\f        The principles expounded in Tehfe apply squarely here. Just\nas there was no question that probable cause existed that the 22nd\nStreet phone line was being used for criminal purposes, there is no\nquestion here that probable cause existed that plumbing inspectors\nwere accepting cash payments from plumbers on inspection sites.\nThe Fourth Amendment and Title III require nothing more.\n\n        Appellant Leone’s staleness argument fails as well. He argues\nthat the only information supporting probable cause as to him were\nCS1’s statements concerning what he witnessed as a plumbing\ninspector from 1992-1997. In his view, this information could not\nsupport probable cause on February 18, 2000, more than two years\nafter the conclusion of the time period providing the basis for CS1’s\ntestimony. It is true that the “[a]ge of the information supporting a\nwarrant application is a factor in determining probable cause[,]”\nUnited States v. Zimmerman, 277 F.3d 426, 434 (3d Cir. 2002)\n(citations omitted), and that “[i]f too old, the information is stale, and\nprobable cause may no longer exist.” Id. (citation omitted). But\n“[a]ge alone ... does not determine staleness. ‘The determination of\nprobable cause is not merely an exercise in counting the days or even\nmonths between the facts relied on and the issuance of the warrant.’”\nUnited States v. Harvey, 2 F.3d 1318, 1322 (3d Cir. 1993) (quoting\nUnited States v. Williams, 897 F.2d 1034, 1039 (10th Cir. 1990)).\n“Rather, we must also examine the nature of the crime and the type\nof evidence.” Id. (citations omitted). Thus, where the facts adduced\nto support probable cause describe a course or pattern of ongoing and\ncontinuous criminality, the passage of time between the occurrence\nof the facts set forth in the affidavit and the submission of the\naffidavit itself loses significance. See Tehfe, 722 F.2d at 1120;\nUnited States v. Harris, 482 F.2d 1115, 1119 (3d Cir. 1973) (“where\nthe affidavit properly recites facts indicating activity of a protracted\nand continuous nature, a course of conduct, the passage of time\nbecomes less significant.”) (citation and internal quotation marks\n\n\n                                   36\n\fomitted). “[T]he liberal examination given staleness in a protracted\ncriminal conduct case ‘is even more defensible in wiretap cases than\nin ordinary warrant cases, since no tangible objects which can be\nquickly carried off are sought.’” Tehfe, 722 F.2d at 1119-20 (citation\nomitted).\n\n         When analyzed under these standards, the evidence advanced\nby the government in support of its request for authorization of the\nhidden cameras was not stale. The confidential sources cited in the\ngovernment’s affidavit depicted the acceptance of payments not only\nas a routine and continuous practice from 1992-1997, but, as\nevidenced by CS1’s statements concerning Appellant Tursi’s\nextortion in April of 1999, and payments made to inspector\nO’Donnell from April to October 1999, also as a practice that\ncontinued beyond 1997 into late 1999. In other words, there was\nevidence that the plumbing inspectors’ misconduct was an\nestablished, routine practice that had spanned numerous years and had\ncontinued at least up until just months prior to the District Court’s\ninitial authorization of the video surveillance in February of 2000.\nWe therefore conclude that the evidence of the plumbing inspectors’\ncontinuous misconduct leading up to the time of the first affidavit’s\nissuance was not stale, and therefore provided probable cause for the\nvideo surveillance.\n\nF.     Appellant Rachuba’s challenge to the District Court’s denial\n       of his motion to sever his trial from the trial of the other\n       Appellants.\n\n        Appellant Rachuba contends that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion in refusing to sever his trial from that of the other\nAppellants because the evidence against certain of the other\nAppellants “was voluminous and more aggressive in nature” than that\nmarshaled against him, and “created an unavoidable spillover effect\n\n\n                                 37\n\fcontinually prejudicing Rachuba and denying him a fair trial.” We\ndisagree.\n\n         We begin with the fundamental principle that the federal\nsystem prefers “joint trials of defendants who are indicted together [\n]” because joint trials “promote efficiency and serve the interests of\njustice by avoiding the scandal and inequity of inconsistent verdicts.”\nZafiro v. United States, 506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993). For this reason,\nthe choice of whether to sever is reserved “to the sound discretion of\nthe district courts.” Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 541. We therefore review a\nDistrict Court’s denial of a motion for severance for abuse of\ndiscretion. United States v. Hart, 273 F.3d 363, 369 (3d Cir. 2001).\n“[A] district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if\nthere is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific\ntrial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making\na reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.” Zafiro, 506 U.S. at\n539.\n\n         Defendants seeking to sever bear a “heavy burden,” Console,\n13 F.3d at 655, and must demonstrate not only abuse of discretion in\ndenying severance, id., but also that the denial of severance would\nlead to “clear and substantial prejudice resulting in a manifestly unfair\ntrial.” United States v. Palma-Ruedas, 121 F.3d 841, 854 (3d Cir.\n1997), rev’d on other grounds by United States v. Rodriguez-Moreno,\n526 U.S. 275 (1999). “[D]efendants are not entitled to severance\nmerely because they may have a better chance of acquittal in separate\ntrials.” Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 540. “Mere allegations of prejudice are\nnot enough.” United States v. Reicherter, 647 F.2d 397, 400 (3d Cir.\n1981).\n\n       Appellant Rachuba has failed to meet his burden. His\nargument boils down to the contention that the evidence of payments\naccepted by other Appellants enhanced his own guilt in the view of\n\n\n                                   38\n\fthe jury. We have long held, however, that “‘[a] defendant is not\nentitled to severance merely because the evidence against a\nco-defendant is more damaging than that against him.’” United\nStates v. Adams, 759 F.2d 1099, 1112 (3d Cir. 1985) (quoting United\nStates v. Dansker, 537 F.2d 40, 62 (3d Cir. 1976)). See also Console,\n13 F.3d at 655 (“Prejudice should not be found in a joint trial just\nbecause all evidence adduced is not germane to all counts against\neach defendant or some evidence adduced is more damaging to one\ndefendant than others.”) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted). Rather, “[s]ome exacerbating circumstances, such as the\njury’s inability to ‘compartmentalize’ the evidence, are required.”\nAdams, 759 F.2d at 1112-13 (quoting Dansker, 537 F.2d at 62). The\njury here was fully capable of compartmentalizing the evidence\nagainst the various Appellants. The jury had at its disposal a chart\nwhich specified which of the Appellants accepted bribes from which\nplumbers, thus enabling it to effectively segregate the evidence\nadduced against Rachuba from that adduced against the other\nAppellants. Moreover, the District Court expressly instructed the jury\nto compartmentalize the evidence, stating in its instructions that “the\nfact that you may find a defendant guilty or not guilty of one of the\noffenses should not control your verdict as to any of the other\noffenses charged,” and that “you must give separate and individual\nconsideration to each charge against each defendant.” We presume\nthat the jury follows such instructions, see Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 540,\nand regard such instructions as persuasive evidence that refusals to\nsever did not prejudice the defendant. See, e.g., United States v.\nVoigt, 89 F.3d 1050, 1096 (3d Cir. 1996) (finding that similar\nlimiting instructions “reinforce[d]” its affirmance of the district\ncourt’s denial of motion to sever) (citations omitted).8 For these\n\n       8\n        The case before us closely resembles United States v. Garner,\n837 F.2d 1404 (7th Cir. 1987). There, City of Chicago sewage\ninspectors had been charged with accepting bribes from private\n\n                                  39\n\freasons, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its\ndiscretion in denying Appellant Rachuba’s motion for severance.\n\nG.     Appellant Rachuba’s contention that the District Court erred\n       in refusing to grant a mistrial due to jurors’ inadvertent\n       exposure to media.\n\n        Appellant Rachuba contends that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion when it refused to grant a mistrial because jurors were\ninadvertently exposed to a New York Times article discussing a\nfederal bribery case involving New York City plumbing inspectors,\nas well as a Philadelphia Inquirer article reporting about guilty\nverdicts handed down in a contemporaneous, though unrelated,\ncorruption trial in the same federal courthouse. The New York Times\narticle had been attached to a memorandum entered into evidence\nduring the testimony of the L&I Department’s Administrative\nServices Director, Richard Feldgus. The memorandum, issued by\nL&I Department Commissioner Bennet Levin in 1993, addressed\n\n\ncontractors in violation of RICO and the Hobbs Act. The inspectors\nwere convicted following a joint trial and appealed, among others, the\nDistrict Court’s refusal to sever their trials. The Seventh Circuit\naffirmed the District Court’s refusal to sever. The court noted that,\nas here, the evidence adduced against the sewage inspectors consisted\nalmost entirely of testimony by contractors concerning the identity of\nthose inspectors they bribed. 837 F.2d at 1414. As such, though the\namount of evidence was large, it was not complex, and thus “the jury\nwas able to ‘segregate the evidence into separate intellectual boxes’\nand to ‘compartmentalize the evidence against the defendants.’” Id.\n(quoting United States v. Cavale, 688 F.2d 1098, 1106, 1108 (7th Cir.\n1982)). Furthermore, as here, “the jury was instructed carefully to\ngive the defendants separate consideration, and to ignore the evidence\nagainst the other defendants.” Id.\n\n                                 40\n\fcorruption in city government and warned city employees not to take\nany additional money beyond their city remuneration. The\ngovernment asked Feldgus during his testimony to read from the\nmemorandum. Defense counsel objected to the government’s\nanticipated introduction of the article, and the District Court sustained\nthe objection, precluding the article’s admission. The District Court\nfurther instructed the jury not to read the article and ordered the\ngovernment to remove the article from the jury evidence books. The\nDistrict Court refused to dismiss any of the jurors following a voir\ndire during which it questioned them about the extent to which they\nhad read the New York Times article.\n\n         On the day the Philadelphia Inquirer article was printed,\nAppellant Leone’s counsel, joined by, among others, Appellant\nRachuba’s counsel, moved for a mistrial because he believed at least\nsome of the jurors had read the article. As with the New York Times\narticle, the District Court conducted a voir dire of the jurors during\nwhich it asked them whether they had read about or discussed any\nother federal case reported in the news and, at least as to one juror\nwho had specifically read the Inquirer article, whether having read or\nheard any such report would affect his impartiality. Following the\nvoir dire, the District Court denied the motion for a mistrial based on\nexposure to the Inquirer article.\n\n        “We review a district court’s order which denies a new trial\nbased on alleged prejudicial information for abuse of discretion.”\nWaldorf v. Shuta, 3 F.3d 705, 710 (3d Cir. 1993) (citing Gov’t of\nVirgin Islands v. Lima, 774 F.2d 1245, 1250 (3d Cir. 1985)). “A new\ntrial is warranted if the defendant likely suffered ‘substantial\nprejudice’ as a result of the jury’s exposure to the extraneous\ninformation.” United States v. Lloyd, 269 F.3d 228, 238 (3d Cir.\n2001) (quoting United States v. Gilsenan, 949 F.2d 90, 95 (3d Cir.\n1991)). “In examining for prejudice, we must conduct ‘an objective\n\n\n                                   41\n\fanalysis by considering the probable effect of the allegedly prejudicial\ninformation on a hypothetical average juror.’” Lloyd, 269 F.3d at 238\n(quoting Gilsenan, 949 F.2d at 95 (internal citations omitted)). We\nlook to see whether the allegedly prejudicial information influenced\nthe jury “when it deliberated and delivered its verdict, as we are\nconcerned with the information’s effect on the verdict rather than the\ninformation in the abstract.” Gilsenan, 949 F.2d at 96. The party\nseeking the new trial bears the burden of demonstrating a likelihood\nof prejudice. Waldorf, 3 F.3d at 710. “We independently review the\nrecord to determine if that party has met that burden.” Lloyd, 269\nF.3d at 238 (citing Gilsenan, 949 F.2d at 95).9\n\n        In determining prejudice, we have often looked at numerous\nfactors, including the “extent of the jury’s exposure to the extraneous\ninformation[,]” Lloyd, 269 F.3d at 240 (citations omitted), the “time\nat which the jury receives the extraneous information[,]” id., “the\nlength of the jury’s deliberations and the structure of its verdict[,]” id.\n\n        9\n          As we explained in Lloyd, unlike many other circuits, we do\nnot mechanically apply a presumption of prejudice every time a jury\nis exposed to extraneous information. See Lloyd, 269 F.3d at 238.\nRather, while we tend to apply the presumption of prejudice where a\njuror is directly contacted by third-parties, Lloyd, 269 F.3d at 238\n(citing cases), “we tend not to apply the presumption to circumstances\nin which the extraneous information at issue is a media report, such\nas a television story or newspaper article.” Id. at 239 (citing cases).\nIt is true that even in the case of media exposure, we will apply the\npresumption of prejudice where “the publicity that occurs is [ ]\nfundamentally prejudicial... .” Waldorf, 3 F.3d at 710 n.6. But no\nsuch presumption applies “[w]here the improper publicity is of a less\nserious nature... .” Id. (citation omitted). We find that the articles at\nissue here are not “fundamentally prejudicial,” and therefore do not\napply any presumption of prejudice.\n\n                                    42\n\fat 241, and the existence of instructions from the court that the jury\nshould consider only evidence developed in the case. Id. The District\nCourt’s voir dire of the jurors revealed that their exposure to the two\narticles was limited to nonexistent. Eleven of the sixteen jurors\nresponded that they had not read the New York Times article, one\njuror responded that he had the read the entire article, and the\nremaining jurors responded that they had either just looked at the\npicture on the first page of the article or glanced at the article’s\ncontents. Only two of the jurors said that they had read the Inquirer\narticle. The District Court’s voir dire of the jurors reveals that the\nexposure of the jurors to the article was limited to non-existent, thus\nsupporting the absence of prejudice.\n\n        Second, the jury was exposed to the New York Times article\non the third day of a seventeen-day trial, approximately four weeks\nbefore it would deliberate. This length of time between exposure and\ndeliberation dilutes any prejudice resulting from that article. See\nGilsenan, 949 F.2d at 96 (finding relevant to its conclusion that no\nprejudice ensued the fact that the allegedly prejudicial information\n“was received at the outset of the trial and was followed by a mass of\nevidence delivered over a 24-day, six-week period.”).\n\n        Third, as in Gilsenan, the jury here delivered a “fractured\nverdict showing that it carefully delineated among the offenses and\nbetween the appellants[,]” id., thus further supporting the absence of\nprejudice resulting from the two articles. The jury convicted\nAppellant Jackson of Hobbs Act extortion but acquitted him on the\nRICO charge. Moreover, while the jury convicted Appellants of\nseveral Hobbs Act extortion counts, it acquitted them on several\nothers, particularly significant in this context given the multiple\ndefendants and high number of individual counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                  43\n\f        Finally, the District Court specifically instructed the jury that\nit should consider only evidence presented at trial, that it must\ndisregard any evidence as to which an evidentiary objection was\nsustained, and, specifically, that it must ignore the New York Times\narticle. This, also, militates against a finding of prejudice. See\nGilsenan, 949 F.2d at 96 (deeming relevant to finding of no prejudice\nthe fact that the “jury was instructed to decide the case on the basis\nonly of the evidence and not extrinsic information”) (citation\nomitted).\n\n        In light of the limited exposure of the jurors to the articles, the\nearly juncture of the trial at which any exposure to the New York\nTimes article took place, the length of time intervening between\nexposure to the New York Times article and deliberation, the\nfractured verdict, and the District Court’s instructions admonishing\nthe jury not to consider stricken evidence generally, and the New\nYork Times article specifically, we find that Appellant Rachuba has\nfailed to carry his burden of establishing prejudice, and that the\nDistrict Court therefore did not abuse its discretion in refusing to\ngrant his motion for a new trial on this basis.\n\nH.      Appellants’ challenges regarding certain jury instructions\n        given and not given.\n\n         Appellants Jackson, O’Malley, Rachuba and Tursi challenge\nthe propriety of the District Court’s refusal to incorporate numerous\njury instructions proposed by those Appellants. Appellant Leone\nchallenges the District Court’s instruction relating to the Hobbs Act\ncharge against him, arguing that the instruction precluded his defense\nthat the payments he accepted were gratuities, not bribes. We reject\nall of these asserted points of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                    44\n\f        Where the challenge to a jury instruction is a challenge to the\ninstruction’s “statement of the legal standard, we exercise plenary\nreview.” United States v. Zehrbach, 47 F.3d 1252, 1260 (3d Cir.\n1995) (citations omitted). Otherwise, we review challenges to jury\ninstructions for abuse of discretion. Id. at 1264 (citations omitted).\nIn so doing, we consider “whether, viewed in light of the evidence,\nthe charge as a whole fairly and adequately submits the issues in the\ncase to the jury.” Id. (quoting Bennis v. Gable, 823 F.2d 723, 727 (3d\nCir. 1987)). Refusal to give a proposed instruction is reversible error\n“only if the omitted instruction is correct, is not substantially covered\nby other instructions, and is so important that its omission prejudiced\nthe defendant.” United States v. Davis, 183 F.3d 231, 250 (3d Cir.\n1999) (citing United States v. Smith, 789 F.2d 196 (3d Cir. 1986)).\n\n        Appellants Jackson, O’Malley, Rachuba and Tursi argue that\nthe District Court erred in refusing to give sixteen instructions which\nAppellants proposed. We address each of these proposed instructions\nin turn. Appellants requested that the following be charged with\nrespect to the RICO charge:\n\n        In order to find a defendant guilty, your focus is on the\n        agreement to participate in the enterprise through a\n        pattern of racketeering activity, not on the agreement\n        to conduct individual predicate acts.\n\nAppellants also requested a charge that they must have “knowingly\nagree[d] to participate in the enterprise.” None of this language was\nappropriate because it speaks to RICO conspiracy, but the\ngovernment had not charged Appellants with RICO conspiracy under\n18 U.S.C. § 1962(d); as discussed above, it charged Appellants with\nsubstantive RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), and the\ngovernment need not prove any agreement in order to prove a\n§ 1962(c) violation. See Irizarry, 341 F.3d at 285 (listing four\n\n\n                                   45\n\felements of § 1962(c) violation). The language used to express the\n§ 1962(c) charge was fully accurate.\n\n        Next, Appellants contend that the District Court should have\nissued the following charge:\n\n       The Hobbs Act requires that the defendant induce\n       victims to part with their property; that they do so\n       through the use of fear, and that they adversely affect\n       interstate commerce.\n\nThis language is taken almost verbatim from our decision in\nAddonizio, 451 F.2d 49, 59 (3d Cir. 1972). But as the government\npoints out, the theory of Hobbs Act extortion in Addonizio was\nextortion based on fear of economic injury. See United States v.\nKenny, 462 F.2d 1205, 1229 (3d Cir. 1972) (noting that in Addonizio,\n“the case was submitted to the jury only on a use of fear theory.”). As\nwe explained above, the Hobbs Act criminalizes two separate classes\nof extortionate conduct: “extortion induced by ‘wrongful use of force’\nand extortion ‘under color of official right.’” Antico, 275 F.3d at 255.\nHere, the government advanced a theory of Hobbs Act extortion\nunder the latter class, i.e., extortion “under color of official right.”\nWe have made clear that the “under color of official right” class of\nHobbs Act extortion does not “require proof of threat, fear, or\nduress.” Kenny, 462 F.2d at 1229 (citations omitted); see also\nMazzei, 521 F.2d at 645 (“A violation of the [Hobbs Act] may be\nmade out by showing that a public official through the wrongful use\nof office obtains property not due him or his office, even though his\nacts are not accompanied by the use of ‘force, violence or fear.’”)\n(citation omitted). Thus, the District Court’s refusal to accept\nAppellants’ “fear” instruction was entirely appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n                                  46\n\f        Appellants requested a number of instructions pertaining to\nthe effect on commerce element under the Hobbs Act. They first\nrequested a charge that there must be a “substantial” connection to\ninterstate commerce. But we expressly rejected this language in\nClausen, where we held that “proof of a de minimis effect on\ninterstate commerce is all that is required” to establish the Hobbs\nAct’s effect on commerce requirement. See Clausen, 328 F.3d at 711\n(citation omitted). Appellants also requested several instructions\npurporting to describe the depletion of assets theory of proving the\neffect on commerce element. While much of the suggested language\nin these requested instructions was accurate, the charge actually given\nby the District Court10 accurately expressed the depletion of assets\ntheory, thus precluding any finding of reversible error in the failure\nto give Appellants’ alternative formulations.\n\n        Appellants requested two instructions purporting to define\n“extortion” under the Hobbs Act. The first stated that “[w]hen\ncontributions are made to public officials, the government must prove\nthat the payments are made only in return for an explicit promise or\nundertaking by the official to perform or not perform an official act.”\nThe second stated that in order to prove Hobbs Act extortion, the\ngovernment had to “prove that the public official knew that he was\n\n       10\n            Specifically, the District Court charged:\n                  Payment from a business engaged in interstate\n                  commerce satisfies the requirement of an\n                  effect on interstate commerce. If the resources\n                  of a business are expended or diminished as a\n                  result of the payment of money, then interstate\n                  commerce is affected by such payment and\n                  may reduce the assets available for purchase\n                  of goods, services, or other things originating\n                  in other states.\n\n                                    47\n\fbeing offered payment in exchange for a specific requested exercise\nof his official power.” The District Court correctly refused both, as\nthey misstate the law. See Evans, 504 U.S. at 268 (“the [g]overnment\nneed only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which\nhe was not entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for\nofficial acts”); United States v. Bradley, 173 F.3d 225, 231 (3d Cir.\n1999) (stating that “a conclusion that in a Hobbs Act case the\ngovernment has to demonstrate that the public official made an\nexpress promise to perform a particular act and that ‘knowing winks\nand nods’ are not sufficient would frustrate the [Hobbs A]ct’s\neffect.”) (quoting Evans, 504 U.S. at 274 (Kennedy, J., concurring)).\nAt the same time, the language actually employed by the District\nCourt was, once again, completely aligned with the law of this\nCircuit. The District Court charged the jury that “an explicit promise\nto perform the official acts in return for payment is not required,”\nlanguage virtually identical to the instruction we approved in Bradley.\nSee Bradley, 173 F.3d at 231 (“the government does not have to\nprove that there was an express promise on the part of the public\nofficial to perform a particular act at the time of the payment”)\n(quoting instruction). The District Court further charged that\n“[e]xtortion occurs if the official knows that the payment or benefit\nis motivated by a hope that it will influence him in the exercise of his\noffice, or influence any action that he takes because of his official\nposition, and if, knowing this, he accepts or agrees to accept the\npayment or benefit.” This, also, comports with our jurisprudence.\nSee Antico, 275 F.3d at 256-58.\n\n        Appellants requested three final instructions relating to the\nHobbs Act charge. First, they asked the District Court to charge that\n“mere voluntary payment of money does not constitute extortion.” It\nis true that purely voluntary payments do not rise to the level of\nHobbs Act extortion. But this proposed instruction added nothing to\nthe fully accurate and complete instruction given by the District Court\n\n\n                                  48\n\fdefining Hobbs Act extortion, some of which was discussed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. See also App. 3177a (District\nCourt’s instruction further charging jury that “the use of one’s office\nto obtain money or services not due is extortion.”). The District\nCourt’s instructions sufficiently described Hobbs Act extortion under\ncolor of official right, and their failure to include the “voluntary\npayments” language proposed by Appellants was therefore not error.\n\n         Appellants then asked the District Court to charge that “[t]he\nprosecution is required to prove that a defendant who accepts money\nwrongfully used his office to induce the payments he received[,]” and\nprove “that a public official did something, under color of his public\noffice, to cause the giving of benefits.” However, inducement is not\nan element of Hobbs Act extortion where the defendant is a public\nofficial. See Antico, 275 F.3d at 256 (“the word ‘induced’ is a part of\nthe definition of the offense by the private individual, but not the\noffense by the public official.... The statute merely requires of the\npublic official that he obtain ‘property from another, with his consent,\n... under color of official right.’”) (quoting Evans, 504 U.S. at 265)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Nor is the\ngovernment required to prove that the public official defendant\nactually “did something” to cause the payment, not only because, as\njust explained, proof of inducement by the public is not required, but\nalso because proof of an explicit quid pro quo is not required. Id. at\n259 (so long as public official knows “that payments or other\nconsideration were extended to him to secure unwarranted favorable\ntreatment in his official capacity, he is guilty of Hobbs Act extortion\nunder color of official right without the need to prove that the official\naction (or inaction) occurred.”).\n\n         The final Hobbs Act instruction proposed by Appellants was\nthat “in order to find the defendants guilty of extortion, you must find\nthat gifts given and received were of significant value.” There is no\n\n\n                                   49\n\fsupport in our precedent for the requirement that payments made be\n“significant” in value. In fact, under Clausen, the government need\nonly prove a de minimis effect on commerce; by necessary\nimplication, insignificant payments having only a de minimis effect\non commerce are therefore sufficient.\n\n         Appellants contend that the District Court erred in refusing to\ngive two proposed instructions pertaining to the RICO charge. The\nfirst charged the jury that the prosecution must prove “[s]ome type of\norganizational structure” in order to establish the existence of a RICO\n“enterprise.” RICO and our precedent merely require proof of an\n“enterprise,” and the District Court set forth how RICO and our\nprecedent defines such an “enterprise.” There is no independent\nrequirement that the government prove any particular type of\n“organizational structure” within the “enterprise.” The second\nproposed instruction charged that “[a]n enterprise must be comprised\nof defendants only[],” citing as support United States v. Nabors, 45\nF.3d 238 (8th Cir. 1995). But Nabors does not support the proposed\ncharge. Nabors held that a RICO “enterprise” may be comprised only\nof defendants, not that it must be comprised of defendants only. See\nNabors, 45 F.3d at 240-41 (citation omitted). The operative inquiry\nis whether the alleged “enterprise” is distinct from the alleged\n“pattern of activity in which it engages” – so long as it is distinct, and\notherwise meets the broad statutory definition of “enterprise,” it may\nbe comprised only of defendants, or of defendants and non-\ndefendants.\n\n         Appellants O’Malley and Leone make two final arguments\nwith respect to jury instructions. Following Appellant O’Malley’s\ntestimony at trial, his counsel asked that the District Court charge the\njury that “[a]s a jury, you may not infer defendant’s [i.e., O’Malley’s]\nguilt from any disbelief of his testimony.” The government contends\nthat this requested charge misstates the law. Indeed, there is no\n\n\n                                   50\n\fquestion “that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party’s\ndishonesty about a material fact as ‘affirmative evidence of guilt.’”\nReeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147\n(2000) (quoting Wright v. West, 505 U.S. 277, 296 (1992)) (other\ncitations omitted); see also Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613,\n620-21 (1896) (stating that there could be no “question that, if the\njury were satisfied, from the evidence, that false statements in the\ncase were made by defendant, or on his behalf, at his instigation, they\nhad the right, not only to take such statements into consideration, in\nconnection with all the other circumstances of the case, in\ndetermining whether or not defendant’s conduct had been\nsatisfactorily explained by him upon the theory of his innocence, but\nalso to regard false statements in explanation or defense, made or\nprocured to be made, as in themselves tending to show guilt.”);\nUnited States v. Jocic, 207 F.3d 889, 893 (7th Cir. 2000) (“When a\ndefendant decides to testify and deny the charges against him and the\nfinder of fact thinks he is lying, his untruthful testimony becomes\nevidence of guilt to add to the other evidence.”) (citing United States\nv. Zafiro, 945 F.2d 881, 888 (7th Cir. 1991)). If the suggested charge\nhad said that the jury “may not infer defendant’s guilt solely from any\ndisbelief of his testimony[,]” this would at least have been a correct\nstatement of the law, for “discredited testimony is not considered a\nsufficient basis for drawing a contrary conclusion.” Bose Corp. v.\nConsumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 512 (1984)\n(citing Moore v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 340 U.S. 573, 575\n(1951)) (emphasis added); see also United States v. Reed, 297 F.3d\n787, 789 (8th Cir. 2002) (“the government may not rely solely on the\njury’s disbelief of a defendant’s denials to meet its burden of proof.”)\n(citations omitted); United States v. Aulicino, 44 F.3d 1102, 1114-15\n(2d Cir. 1995) (“a verdict of guilt cannot properly be based solely on\nthe defendant’s denial of the charges and the jury’s disbelief of his\ntestimony.”). But this was not the language employed in the proposed\n\n\n\n                                  51\n\fcharge. The proposed charge was incorrect as a matter of law, and\nthe District Court was right not to include it.\n\n         Appellant Leone contends that the Hobbs Act charge, by\nstating that “[p]assive acceptance of a benefit by a public official is\nsufficient basis for this type of extortion[,]” had the effect of\n“improperly eliminat[ing] the possibility that a public official may\nreceive an unsolicited gratuity that does not constitute a Hobbs Act\nviolation.” Read in isolation, the “passive acceptance” language does\ngive us some pause. In reviewing the legal accuracy of jury\ninstructions, however, we read the instructions as a whole and in\ncontext. See United States v. Coyle, 63 F.3d 1239, 1245 (3d Cir.\n1995). Doing so here reveals that the Hobbs Act instructions as a\nwhole did not allow for the possibility that Appellant Leone was\nconvicted on proof that he accepted an unsolicited, voluntary\npayment. The Hobbs Act charge required the government to prove\nthat Appellants accepted payment “knowing that the payment was\nmade in return for taking, withholding, or influencing official acts.”\nThe Hobbs Act charge also provided that “[e]xtortion occurs if the\nofficial knows that the payment or benefit is motivated by a hope that\nit will influence him in the exercise of his office, or influence any\naction that he takes because of his official position, and if knowing\nthis, he accepts or agrees to accept the payment or benefit.” These\naspects of the Hobbs Act charge accurately describe Hobbs Act\nextortion, and adequately informed the jury notwithstanding Leone’s\ncontention.\n\n\n\n\n                                  52\n\fI.     United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n\n        Most of the Appellants have challenged their sentences under\nUnited States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).11 Having determined\nthat these sentencing challenges are best addressed by the District\nCourt in the first instance, we vacate Appellants’ sentences and\nremand for resentencing in accordance with Booker.\n\n                                III.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgments of\nconviction as to each of the Appellants, but vacate the judgments of\nsentence of each of the Appellants12 and remand to the District Court\nfor resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          Appellants O’Malley and Tursi also argue that the District\nCourt committed a sentencing error in fixing their base offense level\nunder the sentencing guidelines for the RICO convictions. Because\nwe are vacating O’Malley’s and Tursi’s sentences and remanding to\nthe District Court for resentencing under Booker, we will not address\nthis particular challenge to their sentences here.\n       12\n         We will vacate the sentences of Appellants Jackson,\nRachuba and Tursi even though they have not expressly indicated that\nthey wish to challenge their sentences under Booker.\n\n                                 53\n\f",

They raise a host of contentions on appeal, including\n\n\n                                   5\n\fprimarily a challenge to the District Court’s jury instruction regarding\nthe Hobbs Act’s requirement that the covered misconduct have\naffected commerce. We find none of Appellants’ contentions\nsufficient to support overturning their convictions. We will, however,\nvacate their sentences in light of the United States Supreme Court’s\nrecent decision in United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), and\nremand to the District Court for resentencing in accordance with that\ndecision.\n\n                                   I.\n\n        Appellants Thomas Urban, Joseph J. O’Malley, Joseph R.\nLeone, Gerald S. Mulderig, Fred Tursi, James F. Smith, William C.\nJackson and Stephen M. Rachuba were plumbing inspectors\nemployed by the Construction Services Department (“CSD”), a\ndivision of the Department of Licenses and Inspections (“L&I\nDepartment”) of the City of Philadelphia. The L&I Department is a\nregulatory agency charged with construction inspections and business\nregulatory affairs. The CSD is responsible for issuing all construction\npermits and performing construction inspections. Appellants were\ntasked with performing the plumbing component of these inspections,\nand were expected to enforce the city plumbing code in order, among\nother things, to ensure the safety of the city drinking water.\nAppellants were assigned to districts. Plumbers were required to call\nthe offices of the district in which their job was located to set up an\nappointment with an inspector. Appellants had discretion to decide\nwhen to perform the inspection. In performing inspections and\nenforcing the plumbing code, Appellants had the power to cite\nviolations of the code, issue stop work orders on projects, and revoke\nthe license of any plumber who failed to comply with the code.\n\n      In the late 1990s, law enforcement became aware that\nplumbing inspectors were accepting monetary payments from\n\n\n                                   6\n\fplumbers whose work they inspected, or claimed to have inspected.\nIn the course of its investigation into this practice, the FBI\ninterviewed several confidential sources – designated as CS1, CS2\nand CS3, respectively – who had worked as plumbing inspectors\nalongside Appellants, or as plumbers whose work Appellants had\ninspected. An affidavit executed by an FBI agent, filed by the\ngovernment in support of a request to install hidden cameras in city\nvehicles which would be used by suspected plumbing inspectors,\ndetailed statements given by these confidential sources. CS1, a\nformer plumbing inspector from 1992 to 1997, stated that 70%-80%\nof the plumbing contractors whose work he inspected during that time\nperiod “provided him with a cash ‘tip’ of $5 to $20 in return for his\ninspection and for allowing the contractor to work without\ninterference.” CS1 stated that he made an additional $3,000 to\n$6,000 per year from these “tips,” and that acceptance of “tips” was\ncommonplace among the L&I Department’s plumbing inspectors.\nCS1 believed that plumbing inspectors, including specifically many\nof the Appellants, “regularly accept[ed] ‘tips’ while working in their\nofficial capacity as City inspectors[.]”\n\n        CS2, a small plumbing contractor who had allegedly\ninteracted with plumbing inspectors through a third party, stated that\nhe provided money used to pay a plumbing inspector named “Tursi”\nin 1999 and on at least ten prior occasions. CS3, a large general\nplumbing contractor who worked with several plumbing\nsubcontractors, stated that he was told by his subcontractors that\npayments were made to an inspector named “O’Donnell” and his\nreplacement named “Smith.” The affidavit also stated that the affiant\nhad interviewed a “cooperating witness” who had “made consensual\nrecordings of L&I plumbing inspector Fred Tursi allegedly extorting\nmoney from him.” This cooperating witness advised that he had\ngiven $50 to his plumbers to give to Tursi to “keep him off their\nbacks.”\n\n\n                                  7\n\f        On the strength of this information, the government sought\nand obtained from the United States District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania an order authorizing the installation of\nhidden video cameras in two city vehicles which would be used by\ncertain of the Appellants while on official city business. Video\ncaptured by these cameras apparently showed Appellants Jackson,\nLeone, O’Malley, Rachuba and Smith accepting cash on numerous\noccasions from plumbers during the course of conducting inspections;\nin many instances, Appellants apparently accepted cash payments\nwithout performing any inspection at all.\n\n        On March 19, 2002, a grand jury in the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania returned an indictment of 13 plumbing inspectors,\nincluding Appellants, charging them with a violation of RICO, 18\nU.S.C. § 1962, and multiple counts of Hobbs Act extortion, in\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 1951. A five-week trial ensued in early\nSeptember 2002. At trial, the government presented evidence\nshowing that multiple plumbers made numerous monetary payments\nof varying sizes to each of the Appellants. Plumbers testified that\nthey paid inspectors anywhere from $5 to $200 per inspection. There\nwas ample evidence at trial that plumbers paid inspectors in order to\nensure timely and favorable inspections,1 and to prevent unfavorable\ntreatment or harassment by inspectors. One plumber testified that\n“We felt like if you didn’t do what was, what had been going on for\nyears, you certainly would not see, you may not see an inspector\n\n       1\n         Numerous plumbers testified that because of labor and\nequipment costs, any idle time between the completion of a project\nand the performance of an inspection harmed their business. It was\ntherefore essential that plumbing inspectors arrive as soon as a project\nwas completed, and that they perform the inspection of that project as\nrapidly as possible so that the plumbers could move on to their next\nproject.\n\n                                   8\n\fshowing up when you want him[,]” while another testified that he\npaid inspectors because “[y]ou didn’t want to get on the bad side of\nthe inspector.” Other plumbers testified that they paid inspectors\nbecause they could not afford to find out if they would be treated\ndifferently by the inspectors if they did not pay. Plumber Richard\nClements testified that failing to tip could result in an inspector who\nwould “give me a hard time, or I wouldn’t get the prompt service.”\nYet another plumber testified that when Appellant Tursi asked him\nfor a larger tip than offered, he complied because “I felt as though\nthere would be some kind of problem if I didn’t do it.”\n\n         The government presented substantial evidence demonstrating\nthat Appellants knew that it was improper to accept monetary\npayments from plumbers whose work they were inspecting, thus\nundermining Appellants’ view that they were voluntarily (and\ntherefore properly) accepting “tips.” Each Appellant was required, at\nthe time of hiring, to sign an ethics statement acknowledging that he\nwas not permitted to accept “any offer, any gift, favor or service that\nmight tend to influence” him in the discharge of his duties. Every\ninspector hired between 1980 and 2000 – including all of the\nAppellants – was told that it was against city policy for employees to\ntake any cash in any amount at any time. An ethics directive from the\nMayor of Philadelphia permitted City employees to accept up to $100\nin gifts per year from any one source, but expressly disallowed their\nacceptance of cash in any amount.\n\n        Evidence of how Appellants accepted the plumbers’ payments\nreinforced the government’s contention that Appellants knew the\npayments were improper. Plumbers concealed the payments to\nAppellants in the pages of their work permit or by folding it up and\ntransferring the money in what was commonly referred to as a “green\nhandshake.” In a conversation taped by a cooperating witness and\nplayed for the jury, Appellant Mulderig explained that “every time\n\n\n                                  9\n\fthey hand me a permit I, I used to fold it over like that and then put\nit in my pocket, you know what I mean. ... when I would go to like\nBoston Market or something for lunch I would go in the men’s room\nand take it out and put it in my, you know, take the money out of\nthere and put it in my pocket.” Moreover, video taken by the hidden\ncameras in the city vehicles apparently revealed numerous instances\nof Appellants surreptitiously receiving the payments and endeavoring\nto keep the payments hidden.\n\n        In support of the Hobbs Act’s requirement that any\nextortionate conduct have an effect on commerce, the government\npresented evidence that each Appellant accepted tips from plumbers\nwho purchased supplies made out-of-state, i.e., outside of\nPennsylvania. Many of these same plumbers, however, testified that\nthe payments they made to Appellants did not affect their ability to\nmake out-of-state purchases.\n\n       On October 18, 2002, the jury convicted all Appellants except\nWilliam Jackson of the RICO charges, and all Appellants of the\nHobbs Act extortion charges. The District Court imposed varying\nsentences on Appellants, ranging from twelve months of home\nconfinement to thirty-four months’ imprisonment, as well as fines,\nassessments and probation. These eight, timely, consolidated appeals\nfollowed.\n\n                                 II.\n\n        The District Court properly exercised subject matter\njurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. § 3231. We have appellate jurisdiction\nover the judgments of conviction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and\nover the sentences pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3742. Appellants raise a\nnumber of challenges to their convictions which we will address\nseriatim.\n\n\n                                 10\n\fA.     Appellants’ challenges to the jury instructions’ formulation of\n       the Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce requirement and the\n       sufficiency of the government’s evidence of such effect.\n\n        Appellants’ primary arguments on appeal challenge the\nformulation of the Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce element in the\nDistrict Court’s jury instructions, as well as the sufficiency of the\nevidence adduced by the government to prove such effect. The\nHobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a), provides:\n\n       Whoever in any way or degree obstructs, delays, or\n       affects commerce or the movement of any article or\n       commodity in commerce, by robbery or extortion or\n       attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or\n       threatens physical violence to any person or property\n       in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in\n       violation of this section shall be fined under this title\n       or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1951(a).\n\n       In pertinent part, the District Court instructed the jury as\nfollows on the Hobbs Act charges:\n\n       You do not even have to find that there was an actual\n       effect on commerce. All that is necessary to prove\n       this element is that the natural consequences of the\n       extortion – of the money payment, potentially caused\n       an effect on interstate commerce to any degree,\n       however minimal or slight. Payment from a business\n       engaged in interstate commerce satisfies the\n       requirement of an effect on interstate commerce. If\n       the resources of a business are expended or\n\n\n                                  11\n\f        diminished as a result of the payment of money, then\n        interstate commerce is affected by such payment and\n        may reduce the assets available for purchase of goods,\n        services or other things originating in other states.\n\n        Under this instruction, the jury could convict even if it did not\nfind that Appellants’ extortionate acts actually affected commerce, so\nlong as it concluded that the “natural consequences” of the\nextortionate acts “potentially caused” just a “minimal” effect on\ninterstate commerce. The jury was instructed to find this standard\nsatisfied upon proof of a “[p]ayment” made by plumbers “engaged in\ninterstate commerce,” which payment “diminished” the plumbers’\n“resources,” i.e., by proof of a “depletion of assets.”\n\n        Appellants explicitly challenge the jury instruction’s statement\nthat proof of a “potential” effect on commerce is sufficient to prove\nthe effect on commerce element under the Hobbs Act, and implicitly\nchallenge the jury instruction’s statement of the depletion of assets\ntheory. In Appellants’ view, the reference to “potential” effect is\nflawed because the Hobbs Act speaks in action verbs – “obstructs,\ndelays or affects commerce” – and conduct which merely has the\n“potential” to affect commerce does not actually obstruct, delay or\naffect commerce. Appellants also argue that after a series of Supreme\nCourt decisions between 1995 and 2000 construing the Commerce\nClause, it would be constitutionally doubtful to interpret the Hobbs\nAct as applying to conduct which merely potentially affects\ncommerce. Appellants further contend that the so-called “depletion\nof assets” theory – whereby proof that a Hobbs Act violation depletes\nthe assets of a business engaged in interstate commerce conclusively\nestablishes the effect on commerce requirement – was incorrectly\napplied here in light of the plumbers’ testimony that the payments\nthey made to Appellants did not in fact affect their ability to engage\nin interstate commerce. We read this latter contention as a challenge\n\n\n                                   12\n\fto both the jury instruction’s formulation of the depletion of assets\ntheory, and to the sufficiency of the government’s evidence of effect\non commerce by way of the depletion of assets theory.\n\n        To the extent that Appellants challenge the District Court’s\ninterpretation of the Hobbs Act in formulating its jury instructions, or\nthe fidelity of its interpretation and instructions to the United States\nConstitution, we exercise plenary review.

We begin with United\nStates v. Mazzei, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"329591\"><a href=\"/opinion/329591/united-states-v-frank-mazzei/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">639</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1975) (en banc). Mazzei, a\nPennsylvania state senator, engineered lease transactions between\nstate agencies and a private entity, B.M.I., Inc., and extorted payments\nfrom B.M.I. in connection with the transactions. He was convicted\nof two counts of Hobbs Act extortion. Mazzei argued on appeal that\nthe government had failed to satisfy the Hobbs Act’s effect on\ncommerce requirement because although B.M.I. was deemed to be\nengaged in interstate commerce, the lease transactions which\n\n\n                                  13\n\fconstituted the unlawful extortionate acts were local and did not\nthemselves affect interstate commerce. We rejected this argument,\naccepting instead the government’s contention that depletion of assets\nof an entity engaged in interstate commerce was enough, as “[t]his\nposition accord[ed] with our previous holdings that where the\nresources of an interstate business are depleted or diminished ‘in any\nmanner’ by extortionate payments, the consequent impairment of\nability to conduct an interstate business is sufficient to bring the\nextortion within the play of the Hobbs Act.” Mazzei, 521 F.2d at 642\n(citing United States v. Addonizio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"299990\"><a href=\"/opinion/299990/united-states-v-hugh-j-addonizio-in-no-19391-appeal-of-ralph-vicaro-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1972); United\nStates v.

We found that\nthe facts easily satisfied this standard. B.M.I.’s subsidiaries\n“purchase[d] materials in a number of states for use in manufacturing\nproducts sold in almost every state[,]” id., and the payments the\nsubsidiaries made diminished “funds available to B.M.I. for use in [ ]\ninterstate activities ... and its interstate business must to this extent be\ncurtailed.” Id. We “conclude[d] that the Hobbs Act may\nconstitutionally be construed to reach the indirect burdens placed on\ninterstate commerce by the extortionate activities alleged in this case\nand that such a construction of the statute accords with Congressional\nintent to proscribe extortion which ‘in any way or degree obstructs,\ndelays, or affects commerce.’” Id. (citations omitted).\n\n        In United States v. Cerilli, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368867\"><a href=\"/opinion/368867/united-states-v-egidio-cerilli-in-no-78-2105-maylan-yackovich-in-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">603</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1979), we\nconsidered appeals of substantive and conspiracy convictions under\nthe Hobbs Act. The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (the\n“Department”) leased equipment from private owners in order to\nperform snow removal, general road maintenance and repair\nresponsibilities. Defendants were Department employees who had\naccepted bribes from such private owners in exchange for leasing\ntheir equipment. The government established at trial “that all the\nlessors had bought fuel for their equipment that had travelled in\ninterstate commerce[,]” and that most of the lessors “had purchased\n\n\n                                    14\n\fequipment and/or supplies that had travelled in interstate commerce.”\nCerilli, 603 F.2d at 423.\n\n         On appeal, defendants argued that the evidence of interstate\ncommerce was insufficient to support their Hobbs Act convictions.\nWe disagreed, reiterating that “where the resources of an interstate\nbusiness are depleted or diminished in any manner by extortionate\npayments, the consequent impairment of ability to conduct an\ninterstate business is sufficient to bring the extortion within the play\nof the Hobbs Act.” Id. at 424 (quoting Mazzei, 521 F.2d at 642)\n(other citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We continued\nthat “[a]ll that is required to bring an extortion within the statute is\nproof of a reasonably probable effect on commerce, however\nminimal, as result of the extortion.” Id. (citations omitted). As in\nMazzei, we found that the government’s proof of depletion of assets\nof entities who purchased goods in interstate commerce satisfied this\nstandard. Id.\n\n        We then considered and rejected defendants’ argument in\nCerilli that the depletion of assets theory “should only be applied\nwhere the victim of the extortion is itself an interstate business.” Id.\nWe concluded that such a limited view of the Hobbs Act’s scope\nwould be “inconsistent with Congress’ purpose ‘to use all the\nconstitutional power Congress has to punish interference with\ninterstate commerce... .’” Id. (quoting Stirone v.

We acknowledged that “the effect on\ninterstate commerce proven here is certainly not very large,” but made\nclear that “the Hobbs Act does not proscribe only those extortions\nthat have a large effect on commerce.” Id. We therefore affirmed the\nfollowing jury instruction given by the district court:\n\n       I instruct you instead that you may find interstate\n       commerce with the meaning of these instructions if\n\n\n                                  15\n\f       you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim\n       purchased goods in interstate commerce and that the\n       money was extorted from him; then, as a matter of\n       law, commerce was affected.\n\nId. at 424 n.11. Thus, Cerilli clearly endorsed the depletion of assets\ntheory under the Hobbs Act as formulated by the District Court here.2\n\n        Just last year, in United States v. Haywood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785660\"><a href=\"/opinion/785660/united-states-v-ira-haywood/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d\nCir. 2004), we reaffirmed our adherence to the depletion of assets\ntheory of proving a Hobbs Act effect on commerce, and announced\nthat proof of a “potential” effect is all that is required under the\nHobbs Act. Haywood had been convicted of a substantive Hobbs Act\nviolation for robbing a Virgin Islands tavern. A witness testified that\nthe defendant and his accomplice stole “approximately $40 to $60 in\nbills and approximately $10 in coins.” Haywood, 363 F.3d at 202.\nA Virgin Islands detective testified at trial that the tavern sold\nHeineken and Miller beer, both of which were shipped in “from the\nmainland United States.” Id. at 210. On appeal, Haywood contended\n“that the government did not produce sufficient evidence to show that\nthe bar purchased goods or services from outside the Virgin Islands.”\n\n       2\n         We reaffirmed Cerilli’s endorsement of the depletion of\nassets theory in United States v. Jannotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"401021\"><a href=\"/opinion/401021/united-states-of-america-in-no-81-1020-v-jannotti-harry-p-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1982)\n(en banc). There, we reinstated defendants’ Hobbs Act conspiracy\nconvictions following the district court’s grant of their motion for\njudgment of acquittal. In pertinent part, we observed that “[i]n\nsubstantive Hobbs Act convictions, the requisite nexus to interstate\ncommerce has been found in the depletion of assets theory, because\nthe payment of an extortion demand may reduce the assets available\nfor the purchase of goods originating in other states.” Jannotti, 673\nF.2d at 592-93 (citing Cerilli, 603 F.2d at 424) (other citation\nomitted).\n\n                                  16\n\fId. Haywood primarily contested the foundation of the detective’s\ntestimony concerning effect on commerce, arguing that the\ngovernment was required to adduce independent evidence such as an\ninvoice in order to prove that the tavern purchased supplies\noriginating in mainland United States. We rejected this argument.\nMore germanely, we also rejected Haywood’s contention “that there\nis no evidence to support the exercise of federal jurisdiction over\nwhat is really a territorial crime.” Id. at 211 n.7. Earlier in the\nopinion, in laying out the controlling Hobbs Act principles, we stated\nthat “[i]f the defendants’ conduct produces any interference with or\neffect upon interstate commerce, whether slight, subtle or even\npotential, it is sufficient to uphold a prosecution under [§ 1951].” Id.\nat 209-10 (citation omitted). We further noted that “[a] jury may infer\nthat interstate commerce was affected to some minimal degree from\na showing that the business assets were depleted.” Id. at 210 (citation\nomitted). Applying these principles, we found it “clear that interstate\ncommerce was affected, however minimally, because the bar sold\nHeineken and Miller beer that came from outside the Virgin\nIslands[,]” id. at 211 n.7, and because “the bar’s assets were depleted”\nby the robbery. Id.\n\n       There thus appears to be little doubt that our precedent\nsupports the District Court’s use of “potential” effect and its\nformulation of the depletion of assets theory in the jury instructions.3\n\n       3\n         Our view on these related issues in the context of substantive\nHobbs Act cases is in accord with the weight of authority in our sister\ncircuits.

Appellants\nargue that construing the Hobbs Act to require only proof of a\npotential effect would be constitutionally doubtful in light of this\ntrilogy of cases, thus compelling a strict construction of the Act as\nrequiring proof of an “actual effect” in order to avoid constitutional\ndoubt. But Appellants do not clearly articulate what would be\nconstitutionally doubtful about interpreting the Hobbs Act to require\nonly proof of a potential effect on commerce. We surmise that after\nthe Lopez-Morrison-Jones trilogy, the purported constitutional\ndoubtfulness of such a construction stems from those decisions’\nholdings that Congress may only regulate activities “having a\nsubstantial relation to interstate commerce .... i.e. those activities that\nsubstantially affect interstate commerce.... .” Lopez, 514 U.S. at 558-\n59. But we have already rejected the argument that Lopez and its\nprogeny require proof of a “substantial effect” on commerce in an\nindividual case in order to show a Hobbs Act violation. See United\nStates v. Clausen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781899\"><a href=\"/opinion/781899/united-states-v-adam-bentley-clausen-adam-clausen-united-states-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 711 (3d Cir. 2003). In Clausen, we\nfollowed the lead of other circuits, including the Fifth Circuit, which\nhad held that after Lopez, “legislation concerning an intrastate activity\nwill be upheld if Congress could rationally have concluded that the\nactivity, in isolation or in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate\ncommerce.” See United States v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"12683\"><a href=\"/opinion/12683/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1211 (5th\nCir. 1997); see also United States v.

With respect to the Hobbs Act\nspecifically, we stated in Clausen “‘that the cumulative result of many\nHobbs Act violations is a substantial effect upon interstate\ncommerce,’ and that substantial effect empowers Congress to regulate\npursuant to the Commerce Clause.” Clausen, 328 F.3d at 711\n(quoting Robinson, 119 F.3d at 1215)). Importantly, we held that\n“[i]n any individual case, proof of a de minimis effect on interstate\ncommerce is all that is required.” Id. (citations omitted). And, as we\nannounced recently in Haywood, such a “de minimis effect” in an\nindividual Hobbs Act case need only be “potential.” See Haywood,\n363 F.3d at 209-10 (citation omitted).\n\n        Appellants also suggest that contrary to our reading of\nJannotti, we held there that proof of an actual effect on commerce\nwas required under the Hobbs Act. We disagree. Appellants rely on\nour statement in Jannotti that “[a] substantive violation of the Hobbs\nAct generally is supported by proof of an actual effect on commerce.”\n673 F.2d at 591 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). But saying that\ncertain evidence “generally” supports a violation is not the same as\nsaying that only that evidence supports a violation.\n\n        Finally, Appellants contend that the jury instruction’s\nformulation of the depletion of assets theory created a mandatory\npresumption which improperly precluded the jury from considering\nevidence that commerce was not in fact affected by the plumbers’\npayments. As the precedent above makes clear, however, proof of\nextortion payments by a person or entity engaged in interstate\ncommerce is all the government needs to prove in order to satisfy the\nHobbs Act’s effect on commerce requirement, and the jury instruction\nfaithfully expressed this principle. It is conceivable that, as many of\nthe plumbers testified, the payments the plumbers made did not\nactually result in a reduction in their engagement in interstate\ncommerce – for example, the plumbers may have absorbed the cost\n\n\n                                  21\n\fof those payments by cutting their profits or by reducing their labor\nforce. But as we have repeatedly noted, the government need only\nprove that Hobbs Act extortion potentially affected commerce. Our\n“potential” effect reading of the Hobbs Act explains our continued\nadherence to the depletion of assets theory, because it is beyond cavil\nthat the depletion of assets of a person engaged in interstate\ncommerce has at least a “potential” effect on that person’s\nengagement in interstate commerce. Indeed, had the District Court\ninstructed the jury that, notwithstanding proof of depletion of assets\nof plumbers engaged in interstate commerce, it could nonetheless\nacquit if it credited those plumbers’ conclusory testimony that their\npayments to Appellants did not affect their ability to purchase\nsupplies made out-of-state, it would have misstated the law of this\nCircuit – extortion which depletes the assets of persons or businesses\nengaged in interstate commerce is, as a matter of law, a Hobbs Act\nviolation.\n\n        The above discussion leaves little work left to do in\naddressing Appellants’ argument that the government’s evidence of\ndepletion of assets of plumbers engaged in interstate commerce was\ninsufficient. The jury instruction’s formulation of the depletion of\nassets theory accords with our precedent. Appellants do not dispute\nthat there was ample evidence that Appellants took payments from\nvarious plumbers, and that each Appellant took payments from\nplumbers who were engaged in interstate commerce, i.e., who\npurchased supplies made out-of-state. This evidence is more than\nsufficient to establish the Hobbs Act’s effect on commerce\nrequirement. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court’s\ninstruction that proof of a “potential” effect on commerce via the\ndepletion of assets theory was correct, and that the government’s\nevidence was sufficient to support Appellants’ Hobbs Act convictions\npursuant to that instruction.\n\n\n\n                                  22\n\fB.      Appellants’ challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence that\n        they committed extortion “under color of official right”\n        within the meaning of the Hobbs Act.\n\n        Appellants (except for Leone) also challenge their Hobbs Act\nconvictions on grounds that the government’s evidence that they\ncommitted their extortion “under color of official right” was\ninsufficient. As noted, in reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence,\nwe “must determine whether, viewing the evidence most favorably to\nthe government, there is substantial evidence to support the jury’s\nguilty verdict.” Idowu, 157 F.3d at 268. We “will sustain the verdict\nif ‘any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements\nof the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.’ Thus, ‘a claim of\ninsufficiency of the evidence places a very heavy burden on an\nappellant.’” Dent, 149 F.3d at 187.\n\n        The Hobbs Act defines “extortion” as “the obtaining of\nproperty from another, with his consent, induced by wrongful use of\nactual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official\nright.” 18 U.S.C. § 1951(b)(2). “Thus, the statute supports two\nclasses of extortion: extortion induced by ‘wrongful use of force’ and\nextortion ‘under color of official right.’” United States v. Antico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775966\"><a href=\"/opinion/775966/united-states-v-frank-antico/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 255 (3d Cir. 2001). Here, the government pursued the\n“under color of official right” theory of Hobbs Act extortion. In order\nto prove Hobbs Act extortion “under color of official right,” “the\nGovernment need only show that a public official has obtained a\npayment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment was\nmade in return for official acts.” Evans v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112738\"><a href=\"/opinion/112738/evans-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 268 (1992). In other words, the government need not prove that\nthe public official induced the making of the payment, or that the\npublic official acted or refrained from acting as a result of payments\nmade.\n\n\n\n                                   23\n\f         The government’s evidence here was more than sufficient to\nsupport a finding of extortion “under color of official right.” It was\nestablished at trial that the plumbing code conferred discretion on\nplumbing inspectors to require plumbers to redo a project even where\nthe project was technically code-compliant. Numerous plumbers\ntestified that it was important to minimize the extent to which they\nand expensive personnel and equipment were forced to wait around\nat a job site for an inspector to come and approve the work. These\nplumbers testified that they therefore made payments to Appellants\nbecause Appellants were plumbing inspectors and possessed authority\nwhich could be exercised to the plumbers’ detriment. One plumber\nwho made payments to Appellants testified that he made the\npayments because it made “the job run that much better,” made\n“things work easier,” and made “everything go much better.”\nAnother plumber, Andrew Kromchad, testified that after an incident\nin which Appellant Urban initially refused to allow him to finish a job\nby backfilling, he, Kromchad, began making payments to avoid\n“hassle.” When Mr. Kromchad asked Appellant Urban why he\ninitially refused to permit completion of the job, Urban responded\nthat Kromchad was like his old boss; Kromchad testified that what he\nbelieved Urban meant by this was that his old boss refused to “tip”\ninspectors. Yet another plumber, Michael Brescia, testified that he\n“felt as though there would be some kind of problem” if he did not\n“tip” the inspectors.\n\n         The government also adduced evidence demonstrating that\nAppellants had knowledge that they were receiving the plumbers’\npayments in return for favorable exercise of government authority.\nAt the time of hiring, plumbing inspectors were required to sign an\nethics statement whereby they agreed not to “accept, nor offer any\ngift, favor or service that might tend to influence me in the discharge\nof my duties.” There was testimony from a city personnel manager\nthat every plumbing inspector hired between 1980 and 2000 – a time\n\n\n                                  24\n\fperiod encompassing the dates of hire of each of the Appellants – was\ninstructed that they were not permitted to take money. The personnel\nmanager testified that the prohibition on taking money was reiterated\nat subsequent integrity training sessions. Coupled with the evidence\nconcerning the prohibition on taking money was ample evidence that\nAppellants did not receive the plumbers’ payments publicly, or at\nleast openly in public. Rather, plumbers would conceal the payments\ninside the pages of a permit or would fold up cash and transfer it by\nway of a “green handshake.”\n\n        Thus, the government adduced substantial evidence that:\n(1) plumbers made payments to Appellants knowing that Appellants\nwere public officials exercising governmental authority; (2) plumbers,\nknowing of the discretion in the plumbing code and desirous of\npunctual inspections, made payments in order to assure advantageous\nexercise of that government authority by Appellants; and\n(3) Appellants knew that the plumbers’ payments were made for an\nimproper purpose, i.e., the influencing of their governmental\nauthority. This evidence squarely supports the showing required to\nprove extortion “under color of official right” as explained by the\nSupreme Court in Evans. Contentions like Appellant Urban’s that\nthere was no evidence that he “failed to perform his job as a result of\nhis being tipped and no one claimed to have tipped [him] in exchange\nfor anything,” or like Appellant Mulderig’s that Appellants were not\ninfluenced by the plumbers’ payments, even if accurate, are\nunavailing. We therefore find that Appellants have failed to meet the\nstringent standard for overturning their Hobbs Act convictions on\ngrounds of insufficient evidence of extortion “under color of official\nright.”\n\n\n\n\n                                  25\n\fC.      Appellants’ challenges to their RICO convictions.\n\n        Appellants O’Malley, Rachuba, Tursi and Urban contend that\nthe government failed to prove that they directed the affairs of an\n“enterprise” as required to support a RICO conviction. Appellants\nalso argue that the government failed to prove the existence of an\n“enterprise” for purposes of their RICO convictions because the CSD\ncannot be such an “enterprise.” We reject these contentions.\n\n        Appellants were charged with violating § 1962(c) of RICO,\nwhich provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person employed\nby or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of\nwhich affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or\nparticipate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise’s\naffairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of\nunlawful debt.” 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c). “To establish a § 1962(c)\nRICO violation, the government must prove the following four\nelements: ‘(1) the existence of an enterprise affecting interstate\ncommerce; (2) that the defendant was employed by or associated with\nthe enterprise; (3) that the defendant participated, either directly or\nindirectly, in the conduct or the affairs of the enterprise; and (4) that\nhe or she participated through a pattern of racketeering activity.’”\nUnited States v.

Moreover, “the ‘operation or management’\ntest does not limit RICO liability to upper management because ‘an\nenterprise is operated not just by upper management but also by\nlower-rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction\nof upper management.’” Parise, 159 F.3d at 796 (quoting Reves, 507\nU.S. at 184) (internal quotation marks omitted).

The government’s\nevidence sufficiently established the existence of such a nexus here\nsimply by demonstrating that the City employed Appellants to\nperform plumbing inspections and related work, and that Appellants\nin fact performed that work.\n\n         Appellants also argue that the government failed to prove the\nexistence of an “enterprise.” RICO defines “enterprise” as\n“includ[ing] any individual, partnership, corporation, association, or\nother legal entity, and any union or group of individuals associated in\nfact although not a legal entity[.]” 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4). In order to\nprove the requisite “enterprise,” we require proof “(1) that the\nenterprise is an ongoing organization with some sort of framework for\nmaking or carrying out decisions; (2) that the various associates\nfunction as a continuing unit; and (3) that the enterprise be separate\nand apart from the pattern of activity in which it engages.” Irizarry,\n341 F.3d at 286 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n                                  27\n\f        Here, the government adduced evidence establishing each of\nthe three elements of “enterprise” set forth in Irizarry. There is no\ndispute that the CSD is “an ongoing organization with some sort of\nframework for making or carrying out decisions.” In order to prove\nthe second element – “associates function[ing] as a continuing unit”\n– we have said that the government must show “that each person\nperform[ed] a role in the group consistent with the organizational\nstructure established by the first element and which furthers the\nactivities of the organization.” United States v.

Again, the government offered\nsufficient evidence to support this element. There is no question that\nAppellants worked for the “enterprise,” i.e., the CSD, and they did so\non a continuous basis, daily issuing permits and performing\ninspections of plumbing projects in Philadelphia. Finally, there is no\ndispute that the CSD was distinct from Appellants’ extortionate acts.\nThe CSD is an arm of the government of the City of Philadelphia\ncreated for the purpose of issuing permits for construction projects in\nPhiladelphia and overseeing those projects to ensure their compliance\nwith code regulations. There is no contention that the CSD was\ncreated and existed for the purpose of enabling Appellants’\nextortionate acts.\n\n        Appellants suggest that an “enterprise” can only be an “illegal\norganization,” and that therefore “an employment group [like the\nCSD] created by the City is definitely not an enterprise.” This\nmisstates the law under RICO. The plain text of RICO defines\nenterprise as, inter alia, a “legal entity[.]” See 18 U.S.C. § 1961(4).\nAnd we have frequently found government entities to be “enterprises”\nfor RICO purposes.

But Appellants were\ncharged with committing substantive RICO violations under 18\nU.S.C. § 1962(c), which does not require proof of any such\nagreement. See Parise, 159 F.3d at 794 (citation omitted).\nAccordingly, we find that the government adduced sufficient\nevidence to support Appellants’ RICO convictions, and will therefore\naffirm those convictions.\n\nD.     Appellants’ challenges to the sufficiency of the indictment\n       and the District Court’s denial of their motions for a bill of\n       particulars.\n\n         Appellants Jackson, O’Malley, Rachuba and Tursi argue that\nthe indictment failed to allege sufficient information enabling them\nto prepare a defense. They also contend that given the insufficiency\nof the indictment, the District Court erred in denying their motion for\na bill of particulars. We reject these challenges.\n\n        We deal first with the sufficiency of the indictment. We\nexercise plenary review over a challenge to the sufficiency of an\nindictment. United States v.

An indictment must contain “a plain,\nconcise and definite written statement of the essential facts\nconstituting the offense charged.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(c)(1). “We\nconsider an indictment sufficient if, when considered in its entirety,\n\n\n                                  29\n\fit adequately informs the defendant of the charges against her such\nthat she may prepare a defense and invoke the double jeopardy clause\nwhen appropriate.” Whited, 311 F.3d at 262 (citations omitted).\n\n        The indictment here tracked the language of the Hobbs Act,\nstating that Appellants “knowingly and unlawfully obstructed,\ndelayed and affected commerce, and the movement of articles and\ncommodities in commerce, and attempted to do so, by extortion” by\n“unlawfully obtain[ing] and attempt[ing] to obtain property and\nthings of value.” The indictment further identified in chart form the\napproximate dollar amounts of the “things of value” (the payments\ntaken by Appellants) as well as the persons and businesses who made\nthe payments. In other words, the indictment informed Appellants of\nthe statute they were charged with violating, the elements of a\nviolation of that statute, the persons or businesses victimized, and the\ntime period during which the payments were made. As such, the\nindictment more than adequately informed Appellants of the charges\nleveled against them, and enabled them to prepare their defense and,\nif applicable, invoke the double jeopardy clause.\n\n        We also disagree with Appellants’ contention that the District\nCourt erred in denying their motions for a bill of particulars. We\nreview an order denying a motion for a bill of particulars for abuse of\ndiscretion. See United States v.

Moreover, Appellants had access through discovery to the\ndocuments and witness statements relied upon by the government in\nconstructing its case, including trial evidence reflecting the dates of\npayments to Appellants and the approximate amounts of those\npayments.4 This access to discovery further weakens the case for a\nbill of particulars here.

Appellant Leone’s challenge to the District Court’s admission\n       of videotapes produced by hidden cameras installed in city\n       vehicles.\n\n       At trial, the government entered into evidence several\nvideotapes produced by cameras hidden inside city vehicles used by\nAppellants, including Appellant Leone.          Appellant Leone\nunsuccessfully moved to suppress the videotapes, and argues on\n\n       4\n        This evidence apparently included a computer program\nprepared by the government and provided to Appellants which\nenabled Appellants to determine how many inspections each\ninspector performed for each plumber during a specific time period,\nand to identify which of the inspectors had inspected the work of\nwhich plumbers who had stated that they made payments to\ninspectors.\n\n                                  31\n\fappeal that the District Court erred in refusing to grant his\nsuppression motion. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm the\nDistrict Court’s denial of Appellant Leone’s suppression motion.\n\n        In February 2000, the government sought an order from the\nDistrict Court “to utilize CTV (no audio) to videotape the activities\nof the targeted plumbing inspectors in two City of Philadelphia\nvehicles while performing their daily work routine.” The affidavit\nsubmitted by the government in support of its request contained\nstatements given by several confidential sources during interviews\nwith the FBI. These statements detailed a relatively widespread\npractice by plumbing inspectors, including Appellants, of accepting\ncash payments from plumbers whose work they inspected. On\nFebruary 18, 2000, on the basis of the government’s affidavit, the\nHonorable William H. Yohn of the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of Pennsylvania issued an order authorizing the\ninterception of visual, non-verbal conduct and activities pursuant to\nRule 41(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the All\nWrits Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. Judge Yohn found that there was\nprobable cause to believe that Appellants, among others, were\ncommitting Hobbs Act violations, and found that there was probable\ncause to believe that particular visual, non-verbal conduct and\nactivities concerning these offenses would be obtained through video\nsurveillance installed in the vehicles. Judge Yohn ordered that the\ninterception end on the earlier of (a) thirty days from the date of the\norder or (b) when intercepted conduct or activity “reveals the manner\nin which these individuals and others as yet unknown participate in\nthe specified offenses and reveals the identities of their\ncoconspirators, their methods of operation, and the nature of the\nconspiracy[.]” Judge Yohn granted several subsequent applications\nby the government to extend the order beyond the original thirty days.\n\n\n\n\n                                  32\n\f        While on official inspection duty, Appellant Leone drove one\nof the cars in which a video camera had been installed. The video\ncamera captured numerous instances of Appellant Leone taking\nmoney from plumbers that had been placed between the pages of\npermits and putting it into his pocket despite not conducting any\ninspection of the project site. Appellant Leone argues that there was\nnot probable cause supporting the order authorizing the installation\nof the video cameras because the only information supporting the\norder was not particularized as to him as required by the Fourth\nAmendment.5 He also argues that the information contained in the\ngovernment’s affidavit did not create constitutionally sufficient\nprobable cause because it was stale, i.e., too much time had elapsed\nbetween the dates referenced by the confidential sources and the\nDistrict Court’s order authorizing the installation of the video\ncameras.\n\n        Appellant Leone’s contentions fail. Neither the Fourth\nAmendment nor the federal wiretap statute, Title III of the federal\nOmnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C.\n§§ 2510-2520,6 proscribes the interception and use of audio or visual\ndata of persons not specifically named in an application seeking\njudicial authorization of such interception.

He argues\nthat the only information supporting probable cause as to him were\nCS1’s statements concerning what he witnessed as a plumbing\ninspector from 1992-1997.

The confidential sources cited in the\ngovernment’s affidavit depicted the acceptance of payments not only\nas a routine and continuous practice from 1992-1997, but, as\nevidenced by CS1’s statements concerning Appellant Tursi’s\nextortion in April of 1999, and payments made to inspector\nO’Donnell from April to October 1999, also as a practice that\ncontinued beyond 1997 into late 1999. In other words, there was\nevidence that the plumbing inspectors’ misconduct was an\nestablished, routine practice that had spanned numerous years and had\ncontinued at least up until just months prior to the District Court’s\ninitial authorization of the video surveillance in February of 2000.\nWe therefore conclude that the evidence of the plumbing inspectors’\ncontinuous misconduct leading up to the time of the first affidavit’s\nissuance was not stale, and therefore provided probable cause for the\nvideo surveillance.\n\nF.

The\njury here was fully capable of compartmentalizing the evidence\nagainst the various Appellants. The jury had at its disposal a chart\nwhich specified which of the Appellants accepted bribes from which\nplumbers, thus enabling it to effectively segregate the evidence\nadduced against Rachuba from that adduced against the other\nAppellants. Moreover, the District Court expressly instructed the jury\nto compartmentalize the evidence, stating in its instructions that “the\nfact that you may find a defendant guilty or not guilty of one of the\noffenses should not control your verdict as to any of the other\noffenses charged,” and that “you must give separate and individual\nconsideration to each charge against each defendant.” We presume\nthat the jury follows such instructions, see Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 540,\nand regard such instructions as persuasive evidence that refusals to\nsever did not prejudice the defendant.

Appellant Rachuba’s contention that the District Court erred\n       in refusing to grant a mistrial due to jurors’ inadvertent\n       exposure to media.\n\n        Appellant Rachuba contends that the District Court abused its\ndiscretion when it refused to grant a mistrial because jurors were\ninadvertently exposed to a New York Times article discussing a\nfederal bribery case involving New York City plumbing inspectors,\nas well as a Philadelphia Inquirer article reporting about guilty\nverdicts handed down in a contemporaneous, though unrelated,\ncorruption trial in the same federal courthouse. The New York Times\narticle had been attached to a memorandum entered into evidence\nduring the testimony of the L&I Department’s Administrative\nServices Director, Richard Feldgus. The memorandum, issued by\nL&I Department Commissioner Bennet Levin in 1993, addressed\n\n\ncontractors in violation of RICO and the Hobbs Act. The inspectors\nwere convicted following a joint trial and appealed, among others, the\nDistrict Court’s refusal to sever their trials. The Seventh Circuit\naffirmed the District Court’s refusal to sever. The court noted that,\nas here, the evidence adduced against the sewage inspectors consisted\nalmost entirely of testimony by contractors concerning the identity of\nthose inspectors they bribed. 837 F.2d at 1414. As such, though the\namount of evidence was large, it was not complex, and thus “the jury\nwas able to ‘segregate the evidence into separate intellectual boxes’\nand to ‘compartmentalize the evidence against the defendants.’” Id.\n(quoting United States v. Cavale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"409065\"><a href=\"/opinion/409065/united-states-v-ronald-cavale-united-states-of-america-v-terrence-faul/\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1106, 1108 (7th Cir.\n1982)).

The\ngovernment asked Feldgus during his testimony to read from the\nmemorandum.

The District Court\nfurther instructed the jury not to read the article and ordered the\ngovernment to remove the article from the jury evidence books. The\nDistrict Court refused to dismiss any of the jurors following a voir\ndire during which it questioned them about the extent to which they\nhad read the New York Times article.\n\n         On the day the Philadelphia Inquirer article was printed,\nAppellant Leone’s counsel, joined by, among others, Appellant\nRachuba’s counsel, moved for a mistrial because he believed at least\nsome of the jurors had read the article. As with the New York Times\narticle, the District Court conducted a voir dire of the jurors during\nwhich it asked them whether they had read about or discussed any\nother federal case reported in the news and, at least as to one juror\nwho had specifically read the Inquirer article, whether having read or\nheard any such report would affect his impartiality. Following the\nvoir dire, the District Court denied the motion for a mistrial based on\nexposure to the Inquirer article.\n\n        “We review a district court’s order which denies a new trial\nbased on alleged prejudicial information for abuse of discretion.”\nWaldorf v.

We\nlook to see whether the allegedly prejudicial information influenced\nthe jury “when it deliberated and delivered its verdict, as we are\nconcerned with the information’s effect on the verdict rather than the\ninformation in the abstract.” Gilsenan, 949 F.2d at 96. The party\nseeking the new trial bears the burden of demonstrating a likelihood\nof prejudice. Waldorf, 3 F.3d at 710. “We independently review the\nrecord to determine if that party has met that burden.” Lloyd, 269\nF.3d at 238 (citing Gilsenan, 949 F.2d at 95).9\n\n        In determining prejudice, we have often looked at numerous\nfactors, including the “extent of the jury’s exposure to the extraneous\ninformation[,]” Lloyd, 269 F.3d at 240 (citations omitted), the “time\nat which the jury receives the extraneous information[,]” id., “the\nlength of the jury’s deliberations and the structure of its verdict[,]” id.\n\n        9\n          As we explained in Lloyd, unlike many other circuits, we do\nnot mechanically apply a presumption of prejudice every time a jury\nis exposed to extraneous information. See Lloyd, 269 F.3d at 238.\nRather, while we tend to apply the presumption of prejudice where a\njuror is directly contacted by third-parties, Lloyd, 269 F.3d at 238\n(citing cases), “we tend not to apply the presumption to circumstances\nin which the extraneous information at issue is a media report, such\nas a television story or newspaper article.” Id. at 239 (citing cases).\nIt is true that even in the case of media exposure, we will apply the\npresumption of prejudice where “the publicity that occurs is [ ]\nfundamentally prejudicial... .” Waldorf, 3 F.3d at 710 n.6. But no\nsuch presumption applies “[w]here the improper publicity is of a less\nserious nature... .” Id. (citation omitted). We find that the articles at\nissue here are not “fundamentally prejudicial,” and therefore do not\napply any presumption of prejudice.\n\n                                    42\n\fat 241, and the existence of instructions from the court that the jury\nshould consider only evidence developed in the case. Id. The District\nCourt’s voir dire of the jurors revealed that their exposure to the two\narticles was limited to nonexistent. Eleven of the sixteen jurors\nresponded that they had not read the New York Times article, one\njuror responded that he had the read the entire article, and the\nremaining jurors responded that they had either just looked at the\npicture on the first page of the article or glanced at the article’s\ncontents. Only two of the jurors said that they had read the Inquirer\narticle. The District Court’s voir dire of the jurors reveals that the\nexposure of the jurors to the article was limited to non-existent, thus\nsupporting the absence of prejudice.\n\n        Second, the jury was exposed to the New York Times article\non the third day of a seventeen-day trial, approximately four weeks\nbefore it would deliberate. This length of time between exposure and\ndeliberation dilutes any prejudice resulting from that article. See\nGilsenan, 949 F.2d at 96 (finding relevant to its conclusion that no\nprejudice ensued the fact that the allegedly prejudicial information\n“was received at the outset of the trial and was followed by a mass of\nevidence delivered over a 24-day, six-week period.”).\n\n        Third, as in Gilsenan, the jury here delivered a “fractured\nverdict showing that it carefully delineated among the offenses and\nbetween the appellants[,]” id., thus further supporting the absence of\nprejudice resulting from the two articles. The jury convicted\nAppellant Jackson of Hobbs Act extortion but acquitted him on the\nRICO charge. Moreover, while the jury convicted Appellants of\nseveral Hobbs Act extortion counts, it acquitted them on several\nothers, particularly significant in this context given the multiple\ndefendants and high number of individual counts.\n\n\n\n\n                                  43\n\f        Finally, the District Court specifically instructed the jury that\nit should consider only evidence presented at trial, that it must\ndisregard any evidence as to which an evidentiary objection was\nsustained, and, specifically, that it must ignore the New York Times\narticle. This, also, militates against a finding of prejudice. See\nGilsenan, 949 F.2d at 96 (deeming relevant to finding of no prejudice\nthe fact that the “jury was instructed to decide the case on the basis\nonly of the evidence and not extrinsic information”) (citation\nomitted).\n\n        In light of the limited exposure of the jurors to the articles, the\nearly juncture of the trial at which any exposure to the New York\nTimes article took place, the length of time intervening between\nexposure to the New York Times article and deliberation, the\nfractured verdict, and the District Court’s instructions admonishing\nthe jury not to consider stricken evidence generally, and the New\nYork Times article specifically, we find that Appellant Rachuba has\nfailed to carry his burden of establishing prejudice, and that the\nDistrict Court therefore did not abuse its discretion in refusing to\ngrant his motion for a new trial on this basis.\n\nH.      Appellants’ challenges regarding certain jury instructions\n        given and not given.\n\n         Appellants Jackson, O’Malley, Rachuba and Tursi challenge\nthe propriety of the District Court’s refusal to incorporate numerous\njury instructions proposed by those Appellants.

We address each of these proposed instructions\nin turn. Appellants requested that the following be charged with\nrespect to the RICO charge:\n\n        In order to find a defendant guilty, your focus is on the\n        agreement to participate in the enterprise through a\n        pattern of racketeering activity, not on the agreement\n        to conduct individual predicate acts.\n\nAppellants also requested a charge that they must have “knowingly\nagree[d] to participate in the enterprise.” None of this language was\nappropriate because it speaks to RICO conspiracy, but the\ngovernment had not charged Appellants with RICO conspiracy under\n18 U.S.C. § 1962(d); as discussed above, it charged Appellants with\nsubstantive RICO violations under 18 U.S.C. § 1962(c), and the\ngovernment need not prove any agreement in order to prove a\n§ 1962(c) violation. See Irizarry, 341 F.3d at 285 (listing four\n\n\n                                   45\n\felements of § 1962(c) violation). The language used to express the\n§ 1962(c) charge was fully accurate.\n\n        Next, Appellants contend that the District Court should have\nissued the following charge:\n\n       The Hobbs Act requires that the defendant induce\n       victims to part with their property; that they do so\n       through the use of fear, and that they adversely affect\n       interstate commerce.\n\nThis language is taken almost verbatim from our decision in\nAddonizio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"299990\"><a href=\"/opinion/299990/united-states-v-hugh-j-addonizio-in-no-19391-appeal-of-ralph-vicaro-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (3d Cir. 1972). But as the government\npoints out, the theory of Hobbs Act extortion in Addonizio was\nextortion based on fear of economic injury. See United States v.\nKenny, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"304341\"><a href=\"/opinion/304341/united-states-v-john-v-kenny-appeal-of-william-a-sternkopf-jr-in-no/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1229 (3d Cir. 1972) (noting that in Addonizio,\n“the case was submitted to the jury only on a use of fear theory.”). As\nwe explained above, the Hobbs Act criminalizes two separate classes\nof extortionate conduct: “extortion induced by ‘wrongful use of force’\nand extortion ‘under color of official right.’” Antico, 275 F.3d at 255.\nHere, the government advanced a theory of Hobbs Act extortion\nunder the latter class, i.e., extortion “under color of official right.”\nWe have made clear that the “under color of official right” class of\nHobbs Act extortion does not “require proof of threat, fear, or\nduress.” Kenny, 462 F.2d at 1229 (citations omitted); see also\nMazzei, 521 F.2d at 645 (“A violation of the [Hobbs Act] may be\nmade out by showing that a public official through the wrongful use\nof office obtains property not due him or his office, even though his\nacts are not accompanied by the use of ‘force, violence or fear.’”)\n(citation omitted). Thus, the District Court’s refusal to accept\nAppellants’ “fear” instruction was entirely appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n                                  46\n\f        Appellants requested a number of instructions pertaining to\nthe effect on commerce element under the Hobbs Act. They first\nrequested a charge that there must be a “substantial” connection to\ninterstate commerce. But we expressly rejected this language in\nClausen, where we held that “proof of a de minimis effect on\ninterstate commerce is all that is required” to establish the Hobbs\nAct’s effect on commerce requirement. See Clausen, 328 F.3d at 711\n(citation omitted). Appellants also requested several instructions\npurporting to describe the depletion of assets theory of proving the\neffect on commerce element. While much of the suggested language\nin these requested instructions was accurate, the charge actually given\nby the District Court10 accurately expressed the depletion of assets\ntheory, thus precluding any finding of reversible error in the failure\nto give Appellants’ alternative formulations.\n\n        Appellants requested two instructions purporting to define\n“extortion” under the Hobbs Act. The first stated that “[w]hen\ncontributions are made to public officials, the government must prove\nthat the payments are made only in return for an explicit promise or\nundertaking by the official to perform or not perform an official act.”\nThe second stated that in order to prove Hobbs Act extortion, the\ngovernment had to “prove that the public official knew that he was\n\n       10\n            Specifically, the District Court charged:\n                  Payment from a business engaged in interstate\n                  commerce satisfies the requirement of an\n                  effect on interstate commerce. If the resources\n                  of a business are expended or diminished as a\n                  result of the payment of money, then interstate\n                  commerce is affected by such payment and\n                  may reduce the assets available for purchase\n                  of goods, services, or other things originating\n                  in other states.\n\n                                    47\n\fbeing offered payment in exchange for a specific requested exercise\nof his official power.” The District Court correctly refused both, as\nthey misstate the law. See Evans, 504 U.S. at 268 (“the [g]overnment\nneed only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which\nhe was not entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for\nofficial acts”); United States v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763111\"><a href=\"/opinion/763111/united-states-v-william-f-bradley-aka-franklin-bradley-william-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231 (3d Cir.\n1999) (stating that “a conclusion that in a Hobbs Act case the\ngovernment has to demonstrate that the public official made an\nexpress promise to perform a particular act and that ‘knowing winks\nand nods’ are not sufficient would frustrate the [Hobbs A]ct’s\neffect.”) (quoting Evans, 504 U.S. at 274 (Kennedy, J., concurring)).\nAt the same time, the language actually employed by the District\nCourt was, once again, completely aligned with the law of this\nCircuit. The District Court charged the jury that “an explicit promise\nto perform the official acts in return for payment is not required,”\nlanguage virtually identical to the instruction we approved in Bradley.\nSee Bradley, 173 F.3d at 231 (“the government does not have to\nprove that there was an express promise on the part of the public\nofficial to perform a particular act at the time of the payment”)\n(quoting instruction). The District Court further charged that\n“[e]xtortion occurs if the official knows that the payment or benefit\nis motivated by a hope that it will influence him in the exercise of his\noffice, or influence any action that he takes because of his official\nposition, and if, knowing this, he accepts or agrees to accept the\npayment or benefit.” This, also, comports with our jurisprudence.\nSee Antico, 275 F.3d at 256-58.\n\n        Appellants requested three final instructions relating to the\nHobbs Act charge. First, they asked the District Court to charge that\n“mere voluntary payment of money does not constitute extortion.” It\nis true that purely voluntary payments do not rise to the level of\nHobbs Act extortion. But this proposed instruction added nothing to\nthe fully accurate and complete instruction given by the District Court\n\n\n                                  48\n\fdefining Hobbs Act extortion, some of which was discussed in the\nimmediately preceding paragraph. See also App. 3177a (District\nCourt’s instruction further charging jury that “the use of one’s office\nto obtain money or services not due is extortion.”). The District\nCourt’s instructions sufficiently described Hobbs Act extortion under\ncolor of official right, and their failure to include the “voluntary\npayments” language proposed by Appellants was therefore not error.\n\n         Appellants then asked the District Court to charge that “[t]he\nprosecution is required to prove that a defendant who accepts money\nwrongfully used his office to induce the payments he received[,]” and\nprove “that a public official did something, under color of his public\noffice, to cause the giving of benefits.” However, inducement is not\nan element of Hobbs Act extortion where the defendant is a public\nofficial. See Antico, 275 F.3d at 256 (“the word ‘induced’ is a part of\nthe definition of the offense by the private individual, but not the\noffense by the public official.... The statute merely requires of the\npublic official that he obtain ‘property from another, with his consent,\n... under color of official right.’”) (quoting Evans, 504 U.S. at 265)\n(some internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis added). Nor is the\ngovernment required to prove that the public official defendant\nactually “did something” to cause the payment, not only because, as\njust explained, proof of inducement by the public is not required, but\nalso because proof of an explicit quid pro quo is not required. Id. at\n259 (so long as public official knows “that payments or other\nconsideration were extended to him to secure unwarranted favorable\ntreatment in his official capacity, he is guilty of Hobbs Act extortion\nunder color of official right without the need to prove that the official\naction (or inaction) occurred.”).\n\n         The final Hobbs Act instruction proposed by Appellants was\nthat “in order to find the defendants guilty of extortion, you must find\nthat gifts given and received were of significant value.” There is no\n\n\n                                   49\n\fsupport in our precedent for the requirement that payments made be\n“significant” in value. In fact, under Clausen, the government need\nonly prove a de minimis effect on commerce; by necessary\nimplication, insignificant payments having only a de minimis effect\non commerce are therefore sufficient.\n\n         Appellants contend that the District Court erred in refusing to\ngive two proposed instructions pertaining to the RICO charge. The\nfirst charged the jury that the prosecution must prove “[s]ome type of\norganizational structure” in order to establish the existence of a RICO\n“enterprise.” RICO and our precedent merely require proof of an\n“enterprise,” and the District Court set forth how RICO and our\nprecedent defines such an “enterprise.” There is no independent\nrequirement that the government prove any particular type of\n“organizational structure” within the “enterprise.” The second\nproposed instruction charged that “[a]n enterprise must be comprised\nof defendants only[],” citing as support United States v. Nabors, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"686805\"><a href=\"/opinion/686805/united-states-v-charles-bruce-nabors-and-craig-scott-keltner/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1995). But Nabors does not support the proposed\ncharge. Nabors held that a RICO “enterprise” may be comprised only\nof defendants, not that it must be comprised of defendants only. See\nNabors, 45 F.3d at 240-41 (citation omitted). The operative inquiry\nis whether the alleged “enterprise” is distinct from the alleged\n“pattern of activity in which it engages” – so long as it is distinct, and\notherwise meets the broad statutory definition of “enterprise,” it may\nbe comprised only of defendants, or of defendants and non-\ndefendants.\n\n         Appellants O’Malley and Leone make two final arguments\nwith respect to jury instructions. Following Appellant O’Malley’s\ntestimony at trial, his counsel asked that the District Court charge the\njury that “[a]s a jury, you may not infer defendant’s [i.e., O’Malley’s]\nguilt from any disbelief of his testimony.” The government contends\nthat this requested charge misstates the law. Indeed, there is no\n\n\n                                   50\n\fquestion “that the factfinder is entitled to consider a party’s\ndishonesty about a material fact as ‘affirmative evidence of guilt.’”\nReeves v.

The proposed charge was incorrect as a matter of law, and\nthe District Court was right not to include it.\n\n         Appellant Leone contends that the Hobbs Act charge, by\nstating that “[p]assive acceptance of a benefit by a public official is\nsufficient basis for this type of extortion[,]” had the effect of\n“improperly eliminat[ing] the possibility that a public official may\nreceive an unsolicited gratuity that does not constitute a Hobbs Act\nviolation.” Read in isolation, the “passive acceptance” language does\ngive us some pause. In reviewing the legal accuracy of jury\ninstructions, however, we read the instructions as a whole and in\ncontext. See United States v. Coyle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702500\"><a href=\"/opinion/702500/united-states-v-michael-c-coyle/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1245 (3d Cir.\n1995). Doing so here reveals that the Hobbs Act instructions as a\nwhole did not allow for the possibility that Appellant Leone was\nconvicted on proof that he accepted an unsolicited, voluntary\npayment. The Hobbs Act charge required the government to prove\nthat Appellants accepted payment “knowing that the payment was\nmade in return for taking, withholding, or influencing official acts.”\nThe Hobbs Act charge also provided that “[e]xtortion occurs if the\nofficial knows that the payment or benefit is motivated by a hope that\nit will influence him in the exercise of his office, or influence any\naction that he takes because of his official position, and if knowing\nthis, he accepts or agrees to accept the payment or benefit.” These\naspects of the Hobbs Act charge accurately describe Hobbs Act\nextortion, and adequately informed the jury notwithstanding Leone’s\ncontention.\n\n\n\n\n                                  52\n\fI.
