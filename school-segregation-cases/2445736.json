STATE OF TENNESSEE\n\n                  Appeal from the Circuit Court for Montgomery County\n                       No. 38939     John H. Gasaway, III, Judge\n\n\n\n\n                   No. M2010-01987-CCA-R3-PD - Filed August 30, 2012\n\n\nThe capital Petitioner, William Glenn Rogers, appeals as of right from the post-conviction\ncourt’s order denying his initial and amended petitions for post-conviction relief challenging\nhis merged first degree murder conviction1 and death sentence for the killing of nine-year-old\nJacqueline Beard, as well as his convictions for especially aggravated kidnapping, rape of\na child, and two counts of criminal impersonation. The Petitioner received an effective\nsentence of forty-eight (48) years’ imprisonment for his non-capital offenses. On appeal, the\nPetitioner claims that the post-conviction court erred in denying relief because defense\ncounsel provided ineffective assistance in both the trial and appellate proceedings related to\nthese convictions and sentences and because multiple other constitutional violations call into\nquestion the validity of these convictions and sentences. After a careful and laborious review\nof the record, we affirm the denial of post-conviction relief.\n\n               Tenn. R. App. P. 3; Judgment of the Circuit Court Affirmed\n\nJ EFFREY S.

The trial court merged the felony murder convictions into the premeditated\nmurder conviction.\n\f                                         OPINION\n\n                          Factual and Procedural Background\n\n                                            Trial\n\n       The Petitioner’s convictions and sentences arose from the disappearance and murder\nof nine-year-old Jacqueline (“Jackie”) Beard. The State presented the following proof at the\nPetitioner’s trial:\n\n       On July 3, 1996, the victim, fourteen-year-old Carl Webber, and twelve-year-\n       old Jeremy Beard were playing outside the Beard children’s home when the\n       defendant approached them. The children had seen the defendant, who\n       identified himself as Tommy Robertson, drive by them earlier while they were\n       playing at a “mud hole” in Whitlow’s Hollow near the Beard children’s home.\n       The defendant offered to take the children swimming and told them he had\n       fireworks. He also told the children that he was an undercover police officer\n       and that he was looking for someone named Scott Hall. The defendant\n       appeared to be carrying a walkie-talkie, but it is unclear whether he ever\n       communicated via the walkie-talkie. The defendant left and the victim went\n       home to get her mother, Jeannie Meyer.\n\n               Jeannie Meyer returned to the “mud hole” with her daughter. Soon\n       thereafter, the defendant arrived with fireworks. The defendant told Ms.\n       Meyer that he was an undercover police officer named Thomas “Tommy”\n       Robertson. He said he was a partner of Allen Norfleet from the North\n       Precinct. He then commended Ms. Meyer on finding out who he was because\n       there are “a lot of sickos in the world.” He also advised Ms. Meyer that he\n       knew her mother-in-law, who owned a local restaurant, and her brother-in-law.\n       He inquired about taking the children swimming, and Ms. Meyer responded\n       that they were not allowed to go anywhere with anyone. Ms. Meyer then took\n       the children home, and the defendant left also. Thereafter, Ms. Meyer talked\n       to the children about strangers. At trial, Ms. Meyer testified that she told the\n       children that they should stay away from strangers, even if they thought they\n       might know them, and that they should never go near a vehicle occupied by a\n       stranger. She also told the children that people sometimes lie and are\n       untruthful about their identity and that some people carry fake police badges.\n\n             The following day, July 4, 1996, the defendant, his wife, Juanita\n       Rogers, and Mrs. Rogers’s granddaughter went to Land Between the Lakes for\n\n                                             -2-\n\fa picnic. While there, the defendant and Mrs. Rogers’ granddaughter went for\na walk. They walked a long distance down a dirt road near Dyer’s Creek.\nUpon returning from the walk, the defendant told his wife that “you could bury\na body back here and nobody would ever find it.”\n\n       At approximately 5:30 a.m. on July 8, Mrs. Rogers left for work at the\nBusy Bee restaurant, which was next door to the Rogers’ residence. Mrs.\nRogers saw her husband that morning and again before lunch. Thereafter, she\ndid not see him again until approximately 6:00 p.m. The defendant was\ndriving his wife’s white Chevrolet that day.\n\n        During the afternoon of July 8, 1996, at approximately 1:30 p.m., the\ndefendant appeared at the Meyer residence. He advised Ms. Meyer that he had\nlost his keys on July 3 and asked that they “keep an eye out” for the keys. Ms.\nMeyer responded that neither she nor the children would be in the area where\nthey had met earlier because she had a doctor’s appointment in approximately\nthirty minutes. He then told her that if they found the keys, she should call\nSergeant Brian Prentice with the county police and tell him they had found\nTommy’s keys. During the conversation, the victim and Jeremy came outside\nand stood on the porch where the adults were talking. After the conversation,\nMs. Meyer and her children went inside their home, and, according to Meyer,\nthe defendant walked down the hill in front of their home in the direction of\na nearby abandoned trailer.\n\n         Once the family was inside the home, the children began to watch\ntelevision. Soon thereafter, the victim began to ask her mother if she could go\noutside to pick blackberries to take to the doctor’s office. Ms. Meyer refused\nat first, but after more requests, she told her daughter she could go outside after\nchanging her clothes. The victim changed into a Minnie Mouse T-shirt with\nhot pink circles on the front, teal blue shorts, and a pair of new multi-colored\nleather woven sandals. Ms. Meyer told her daughter that they would be\nleaving in fifteen minutes for the doctor’s appointment and instructed her not\nto go looking for the lost keys. Ms. Meyer believed her daughter left around\n1:40 or 1:45 p.m. Ten to fifteen minutes later, Ms. Meyer went outside to get\nher to go to the doctor’s appointment. She looked for her and called for her,\nbut received no response. She and Jeremy drove to the area known as\nWhitlow’s Hollow, where they had met the man they thought was Tommy\nRobertson the week before. During their drive, they called out the victim’s\nname, but still received no response. They stopped and asked Joey Sauers,\nwhose mother and stepfather owned the property known as Whitlow’s Hollow,\n\n                                        -3-\n\fif he had seen the victim. He had not, nor had he seen a white vehicle in the\narea that day. Sauers estimated that it was approximately 2:00 p.m. when he\nmet Ms. Meyer looking for her daughter. Sauers’s mother and stepfather, Paul\nand Jackie Whitlow, began to help Ms. Meyer search for the victim. Ms.\nMeyer returned home to leave a note for her husband that they were out\nlooking for the victim. She then began knocking on the neighbors’ doors to\nsee if anyone had seen the victim or knew anyone named Thomas Robertson.\nOne neighbor, Mike Smith, saw a white vehicle with a black front end driving\nin the direction of Whitlow’s Hollow around noon or 1:00 p.m. on July 8. He\nsaw the same vehicle pass by his house again around 2:00 p.m.\n\n        During her search, Ms. Meyer saw what she believed were a set of\nfootprints up the side of a bank and down the road in front of the abandoned\ntrailer. She also saw a set of footprints that she believed looked like her\ndaughter’s near the “mud hole.” She returned home shortly after 3:00 p.m.\nHer husband was home at the time. She told him that the victim was missing\nand that the man who had identified himself as Tommy Robertson had been at\ntheir house earlier. Mr. Meyer told his wife to call 9-1-1, and he went\nsearching for the victim. The 9-1-1 call was made at 3:26 p.m. Law\nenforcement officers soon arrived, along with a K-9 unit, to search for the\nvictim.\n\n        At some point after 6:00 p.m., the defendant arrived home in muddy\npants. He told his wife he had been in a tobacco field on Dover Road.\nAccording to Mrs. Rogers, the defendant’s pants were muddy at the knees and\nlooked like they had been wiped off. Although his pants were muddy, Mrs.\nRogers noticed that his shoes were clean. She also noticed that there was a\nspot of blood on his shirt. When Mrs. Rogers questioned her husband about\nthe blood, he responded that he must have cut his finger. Mrs. Rogers had\nbeen waiting for her husband to come home because she needed her car to take\nher granddaughter to school. When she got in her car, she noticed small\nfingerprints on the passenger side windshield. Mrs. Rogers asked her husband\nif a small child had been in her car, which he denied. Mrs. Rogers explained\nthat the fingerprints or hand prints appeared to drag down the window. Mrs.\nRogers also noticed that although she had given her husband money to put\ngasoline in the car earlier that day, there was little gasoline in the car.\n\n       During the evening of July 8, Jeannie Meyer was interrogated by law\nenforcement about the disappearance of her daughter. At approximately 9:00\np.m., she went to the police station and gave a description of the man who had\n\n                                     -4-\n\fidentified himself as Tommy Robertson. Ms. Meyer acknowledged at trial that\nshe was initially a suspect in the disappearance of her daughter, which she\nbelieved was not unusual in the disappearance of children. She admitted that\nthe police report showed that her daughter disappeared around 1:00 p.m., but\nshe said the report was simply wrong. Ms. Meyer also admitted that the police\nhad questioned her about being involved in cocaine trafficking, and she\nsuspected that her phone lines were tapped following her daughter’s\ndisappearance. Ms. Meyer was not satisfied with the investigation conducted\nby the Montgomery County law enforcement officials. The family conducted\ntheir own investigation into the victim’s disappearance and brought in Billy\nHale with the National Missing Child Locate Center.\n\n        On July 9, 1996, the day following the victim’s disappearance, Mrs.\nRogers accompanied her husband to the garbage dump. Mrs. Rogers thought\nit was unusual that her husband took only one bag of trash all the way to the\ndump. According to Mrs. Rogers, the defendant took the bag of trash out of\nhis car and drove her white Chevrolet to the dump. En route, she noticed that\nher car had been cleaned from the day before, both inside and out, but the\ndefendant denied cleaning the car. He stated that the car was washed off by\nthe rain, to which Mrs. Rogers stated it could not have rained inside the car.\n\n        As a result of the official law enforcement investigation into the\nvictim’s disappearance, a composite drawing of the suspect in the victim’s\ndisappearance was printed in the newspaper. Sergeant Brian Prentice received\nthree telephone calls advising that the defendant resembled the man in the\ncomposite drawing. One of the phone calls came from Jerry Wayman. He\nsaid that he had sold the defendant a cellular telephone prior to July 8 and that\nhe and the defendant had discussed Wayman’s purchase of a scanner. Based\non the information from the telephone calls, Sergeant Cliff Smith attempted to\nlocate the defendant.\n\n        Sergeant Smith first located Mrs. Rogers, who told him that the\ndefendant was working at Midas Muffler. Sergeant Smith found the defendant\nat Midas Muffler and questioned him about his whereabouts the previous\nseveral days. The defendant told the officer that he had been to Paris Landing\nState Park on Saturday and Sunday July 6 and 7. He said he had been home\nall day Monday, July 8 with his wife. He denied that he had ever been to the\narea where the victim lived and disappeared. He later admitted that he had a\nfriend, Allen Norfleet, who was a sergeant with the Clarksville Police\nDepartment who lived in the area and that he had visited him about a month\n\n                                       -5-\n\fearlier. He denied possessing any fireworks. To corroborate his story of\nvisiting the lake, the defendant showed the officer some floats and an air\nmattress in his trunk. Sergeant Smith returned to the Rogers’s residence to\ndiscuss his investigation with Mrs. Rogers. At some point that morning, the\ndefendant called his wife. She asked him what was going on, and he told her\nthat two detectives had come to talk to him and wanted to search his car. She\nasked why they would want to do so, and he responded that he had no idea.\nDuring their conversation, she asked the defendant what he had told the\nofficers about his whereabouts on Monday, July 8. He told her that he had\nbeen with her the entire afternoon. When she disagreed with him, he stated\nshe must have her dates wrong.\n\n        Sergeant Smith returned to the defendant’s place of employment for\nfurther questioning. After talking briefly with the defendant, Sergeant Smith\nasked the defendant to accompany him to the police station. Although the\ndefendant was hesitant at first, he agreed. The defendant drove himself to the\nstation where he was questioned by Sergeant Smith, Steven Hooker, a special\nagent with the F.B.I., Bret Murray, a special agent with the F.B.I., Jeff Puckett,\na special agent with the T.B.I., and Billy Batson, an investigator with the\nMontgomery County Sheriff’s Office. Sergeant Smith presented the defendant\nwith three forms: a waiver of rights form (Miranda[ 2 ] form); a consent to\nsearch the defendant’s residence; and a consent to search the defendant’s\nvehicle. Smith read the defendant his Miranda rights, and the defendant signed\nall three forms at 11:18 a.m. on July 11, 1996.\n\n        Initially during the interview, the defendant admitted he had been in the\narea where the victim lived on the day of her disappearance, but he denied\nbeing involved in the disappearance. The defendant explained that he shot\nfireworks with three boys on July 3 in the Cumberland Heights area where the\nvictim lived. He stated that he lost a key to his shed during that time and that\nhe returned on July 8 to search for it. He admitted speaking with Jeannie\nMeyer and telling her to notify Allen Norfleet if she found the key. He denied\nthat the victim was present during that conversation. The defendant said he\nleft the Meyer residence and walked to an abandoned trailer because he had to\nuse the bathroom. He said he defecated on a curtain inside the trailer and\nthrew the curtain out the window. He said he drove to a waste management\nplant to inquire about employment but discovered that the help wanted sign\nhad been taken from the window. He said he went home and called his wife\n\n\n2\n    Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n                                           -6-\n\fto tell her that the help wanted sign was gone. He stated he was at home from\napproximately 3:30 to 4:00 p.m., when he left to drive around looking for\nwork. He said he returned home again around 5:45 p.m.\n\n        The defendant accompanied officers to his residence for a search of the\nhome. While there, the defendant agreed to submit to a polygraph test.\nFollowing the test, the defendant changed his story. He admitted that the\nvictim had been present when he spoke with Ms. Meyer on July 8. He stated\nthat after he left the trailer, he entered his car and smoked a cigarette. He said\nhe began to back up and leave when he felt a thud. He thought he had hit a\ntree, but when he got out of his car, he saw the victim underneath the car. He\nstated he did not know what to do. She had blood coming from her nose and\nwas having difficulty breathing. He found one of his old shirts in the trunk and\nused it to cover her head. He placed her in the passenger side of his car. The\ndefendant stated he drove to the bridge on Zinc Plant Road, saw there was no\ntraffic, stopped his car, and threw the victim’s body into the river. He said that\nthe victim was wearing multicolored sandals and that one of them had come\noff her foot. He grabbed the shoe and threw it also. He told the officers that\nhe had not seen her until he ran over her. He stated that he did not touch her\n“in any way sexually or abusive.” The defendant reduced this story to writing\nand signed the statement. He also signed a picture of the victim to verify that\nthe picture portrayed the person he struck. The defendant consented to a body\nsearch and was taken to the hospital where hair and blood samples were taken.\nThe defendant was placed under arrest, following which the defendant asked\nif he would be charged with vehicular homicide. The defendant called his\nwife, telling her he had confessed to vehicular homicide and would be home\nin a couple of hours.\n\n        The following day, July 12, 1996, the defendant was questioned by\nAgent Murray, who readvised him of his Miranda rights before the interview.\nThe defendant confirmed his statements of the previous day and gave a second\nwritten statement in which he admitted that the victim had been in the\npassenger seat of his vehicle on July 8. He stated that they talked for about\nfive minutes. He said she got out of his car because she said her mother had\nto go to the doctor. The defendant told Agent Murray that after the victim got\nout of his car, he ran over her.\n\n       Also on July 12, the defendant went with the investigators to the area\nwhere he said he had run over the victim. The defendant also showed\ninvestigators where he claimed to have thrown the victim’s body into the river.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fThe defendant reenacted the events of July 8 at the site visit. The defendant’s\ncourt-appointed attorney was present during the site visit.\n\n       In addition to the defendant being considered a suspect, the Meyers\nwere also initially considered suspects but were ruled out early in the\ninvestigation. Quinton Donaldson, a friend of the defendant, was also a\nsuspect. Donaldson drove a white Camaro and was in the Cumberland Heights\narea on the day of the victim’s disappearance. In fact, an officer spotted the\nCamaro parked at a residence a couple of miles away from the Meyer’s\nresidence and stopped and questioned Donaldson during the initial search for\nthe victim on July 8. Later, Donaldson gave a written statement to Agent\nPuckett in which he stated that he was the person who threw the victim’s body\ninto the river, but he ultimately recanted that statement, denying having any\ninvolvement in the victim’s disappearance.\n\n        During the search of the defendant’s white Chevrolet Celebrity,\nauthorities found a hand-held telescope, a cellular telephone power cord, and\na cigarette lighter cellular telephone charger. Later, when the vehicle was\nprocessed, they found Doral-brand cigarette butts in the ashtray and an empty\nDoral wrapper stuck over the visor. They also found a Motorola cellular\ntelephone, a can of glass cleaner, and a Tennessee map open to the Middle\nTennessee region, including the Land Between the Lakes area. A floor mat\nwas on the driver’s side of the vehicle but not on the passenger’s side. The\nvehicle was also searched for trace evidence, including glass, hair fibers, shoe\ntracks, and tire tracks. No fingerprints were found in the white Chevrolet that\nmatched either the defendant or the victim. The defendant’s 1984 blue\nOldsmobile was also vacuumed for fibers. The authorities also searched the\ndefendant’s residence where a scanner radio was found. Carpet fibers were\ntaken from the residence.\n\n        In addition to giving a statement to law enforcement officials, the\ndefendant spoke to several other people about his role in the victim’s\ndisappearance.     On July 14, 1996, the defendant’s mother, Cynthia\nSchexnayder, and his half-brother, Martin Schexnayder, traveled to Tennessee\nto meet with the defendant in jail. The defendant recounted the same story to\nhis mother that he had given the police in his written statement. He told her\nnot to worry because “all they could get him for was vehicular homicide.” He\ntold his half-brother that he had cut grass near a park and was leaving when he\nbacked over a little girl.\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f        David Ross testified that as a reporter for the Clarksville Leaf\nChronicle, he covered the victim’s disappearance and talked with investigators\nand the victim’s family. He said that in August 1996, he talked with the\ndefendant by telephone. The defendant told Mr. Ross that he told the police\nthat he had run over the victim in order for them to let him go home. The\ndefendant admitted to Mr. Ross that the victim had been in his car, but he said\nhe last saw her walking down the hill toward the woods. He denied knowing\nwhere the victim’s body was but “figured” it would be in the water\nsomewhere. He also said that he did not believe that the police were really\nlooking for her.\n\n      The defendant sent a letter addressed to Wilbur Meyer, Jeannie Meyer’s\nhusband, from jail. The letter read as follows:\n\n       Wilbur, don’t ask me why I am writing this letter because you\n       are just as hard-headed as T.B.I, F.B.I, and Montgomery County\n       police. I apologize for saying I did something I didn’t. I saw\n       them on T.V. accusing you and your wife of selling her for\n       drugs. That really pissed me and my wife off. I just had a\n       feeling that if she died, she would be in the river because of\n       dreams that I had and the configuration of the land. That’s why\n       I got on T.V. as soon as I did.\n\n       I am going to close this letter now, but if you will do a one-\n       hundred and eighty degree turn, you might find her. You are\n       wasting too much energy trying to blame me. I didn’t hurt her\n       in any way. I told the police over and over that that’s the last\n       time I saw her was in my rear view mirror by the mud hole.\n       When you do find her, you will see or she will tell you that I had\n       nothing to do with this. Sincerely, Glenn. P.S. Help me and I\n       will help you. See if you can get my wife to talk to me . . . Call\n       her and if she will talk to me, I will help you in any way that I\n       can.\n\n        He also placed several collect calls to the Meyer residence. The Meyers\ntestified that they spoke with the defendant, hoping to find the victim. The\ndefendant also left several messages for his wife in which he stated that if she\nwould talk to him, he would tell her what happened, tell her the truth. He also\nleft messages that he would tell her where the victim could be found.\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f        On November 8, 1996, Jerry Lee Brown and his son were scouting for\ndeer in the Land Between the Lakes area when they found a human skull.\nThey reported their finding to Leeman Lyons, an employee of the Forestry\nOpen Land and Wildlife. Mr. Lyons immediately called for a patrol car to go\nto the area where the skull had been found, and he also went to the area with\nthe Browns and TVA police officer Joe Bridges. The witnesses described the\narea where the skull was located as a densely wooded area approximately one-\nhalf mile from a logging road. Detective Billy Batson testified that the area in\nquestion was several hundred yards from the Cumberland River and was\napproximately 48.5 miles from the area where the victim disappeared.\n\n        TVA Investigator Greg Mathis took photographs of the crime scene\narea and found a pair of teal-colored shorts on November 8. The crime scene\nwas not processed, however, until the following day. During the search of the\narea, two sandals, a Minnie Mouse T-shirt that was turned inside out,\nadditional bones, two cigarette butts, an earring backing, a plastic tobacco\ncontainer, black plastic tape, and a hair mass were found. The tobacco\ncontainer, the Doral-brand cigarette butt, and the black tape were not found in\nthe immediate area of the remains. One cigarette butt was found near the\nskull, but it was unmarked and was older and more deteriorated than the Doral-\nbrand butt. The Doral-brand cigarette butt was found approximately one\nhundred to three hundred yards from the crime scene and was in better\ncondition, even having ashes on it.\n\n        Forensic anthropologist Dr. Murray K. Marks headed the testing of the\nskeletal remains. Dr. Marks arrived at the scene and discovered the remains\n“sandwiched between two layers of leaves,” the bottom layer from the year\nbefore and the top layer from the fall of 1996. The remains were scattered\naround the scene, which is common where a person dies in the woods and\nremains for a long period of time. Dr. Marks examined the skull and found\nthat the victim was between 7.4 and 8.7 years of age. The victim had both\nbaby and permanent teeth. The victim was a Caucasian, but he could not\ndetermine the victim’s gender. Dr. Marks concluded that the remains had been\nin the area between three and nine months. He examined the victim’s dental\nrecords from 1993, but could not make a positive identification from the\nrecords. At trial, Dr. Marks explained that the records were from 1993, and\nchildren change dramatically in three years. However, he could not rule out\nthe possibility that the remains were those of the victim. Jeannie Meyer\nidentified the shoes, T-shirt, and shorts found at the scene as her daughter’s\nclothing.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f              TBI forensic scientists examined the articles of clothing found at the\n      site, but fibers from the clothing could not be matched to fibers taken from the\n      defendant’s vehicle. TBI officials did, however, find the presence of semen\n      inside the crotch area of the shorts recovered from the site. Mark Squibb, a\n      serologist formerly with the TBI, testified at trial that he found fibers that he\n      believed were hair inside the shorts. A DNA profile could not be obtained\n      from the semen stains. Furthermore, DNA testing on the cigarette butt found\n      near the remains was inconclusive. A DNA profile was obtained from the\n      Doral-brand butt, and the defendant was excluded as a possible donor for that\n      butt.\n\n              Forensic serologist Meghan Clement tested teeth recovered from the\n      scene. Ms. Clement compared the DNA sequence derived from the teeth with\n      a blood standard submitted by Jeannie Meyer. Clement determined that there\n      was a maternal relationship between Ms. Meyer and the donor of the teeth. Dr.\n      Robert Lee, the Stewart County Medical Examiner, issued a death certificate\n      for the victim. He concluded that the cause of her death was unknown.\n\n             FBI scientist Max Michael Houck tested fiber samples vacuumed from\n      the defendant’s car and the defendant’s carpet at his residence and compared\n      them with fibers taken from the victim’s shorts. He identified light yellow\n      carpet fibers in the samples taken from the defendant’s car and residence that\n      “exhibited the same microscopic characteristics and optical properties” as\n      fibers taken from the victim’s shorts. Although he could not identify the\n      source of the fibers, the fibers appeared to have the same properties and\n      characteristics as samples taken from the living room carpet in the defendant’s\n      residence. Agent Houck testified that either the victim’s shorts had been in the\n      defendant’s living room, or the fibers had been transferred to the shorts\n      through contact. He explained that the fibers could have been transferred to\n      the defendant’s car via the defendant’s shoes or clothing and then transferred\n      to the victim’s shorts if she came into contact with the defendant’s car.\n      Additionally, FBI chemist Ronald Menold tested the fibers forwarded to him\n      by Agent Houck. He found the fibers from the victim’s shorts and the\n      vacuumings of the defendant’s car and residence to be consistent in polymeric\n      composition.\n\nState v. William Glenn Rogers, No. M2002-01798-CCA-R3-DD, 2004 WL 1462649, at *2-\n9 (Tenn. Crim. App. June 30, 2004), aff’d State v. Rogers, 188 S.W.3d 593 (Tenn. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\f       The Petitioner offered the following proof at trial in support of an alibi defense:\n\n       Edra Landon testified that while she was working at Shelby’s Riverside 66\n       service station on July 8, 1996, a man dressed in a work uniform and driving\n       a blue four-door truck entered the station to apply for a job between 4:00 and\n       4:15 p.m. She said it was a Monday. She saw the composite drawing of the\n       suspect in the victim’s disappearance and called the police to advise that he\n       had been in the service station on July 8. She admitted on cross-examination\n       that she could not be one hundred percent sure that the defendant was the man\n       who came into the store that day. She testified that only one person responded\n       to their ad for employment. Robert Landon confirmed his wife’s account. He\n       testified that the man who visited the service station was wearing blue pants\n       and a mechanics shirt. He talked to the man for approximately twenty minutes.\n       He felt pretty sure that the man who came in looking for work was the\n       defendant. Once he realized that the defendant had been in the store, he called\n       Wilbur Meyer, the victim’s stepfather, who was a friend of his. Ms. Landon’s\n       father, Eddie Kingins, also testified that he was at the store between 3:30 and\n       4:00 p.m. on July 8, 1996, and saw the defendant in the store. He also testified\n       that the defendant was driving a blue four-door pickup truck. When he saw\n       the defendant on the news two or three days later, he called his daughter.\n\nRogers, 2004 WL 1462649, at * 9. As part of his defense case, the Petitioner also “tried to\npoint out discrepancies and contradictions in the State’s evidence.” Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at\n601.\n\n        The State presented rebuttal testimony from Investigator Billy Batson who “testified\nthat the defendant had stated that he had worn blue jeans and a maroon and green tank top\nand tennis shoes on July 8, 1996.” Rogers, 2004 WL 1462649, at *9. Batson also testified\nthat “[t]he defendant had never suggested to [him] that he stopped at the service station to\ninquire about employment” and that “there was no evidence that the defendant ever owned\nor used a blue pickup truck.” Id.\n\n        Based upon the evidence presented at trial, the jury convicted the Petitioner of first\ndegree premeditated murder, first degree felony murder in the perpetration of a kidnapping,\nfirst degree felony murder in the perpetration of a rape, especially aggravated kidnapping,\nrape of a child, and two counts of criminal impersonation. Id. at *10. The trial court merged\nthe two felony murder convictions into the premeditated murder conviction and entered a\nsingle judgment order of first degree murder. The trial court entered only one judgment of\nconviction for criminal impersonation, apparently because the two convictions were based\non alternative counts.\n\n                                             -12-\n\f       During the sentencing phase of the Petitioner’s trial, the State presented evidence\nestablishing that the Petitioner had been convicted, pursuant to guilty pleas entered on April\n12, 1991, of two counts of aggravated assault in Gwinnett County, Georgia, and that the\nstatutory elements of these prior offenses involved the use of violence to a person. See id.;\nsee also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 601. The State also presented the following victim impact\ntestimony from the victim’s mother:\n\n               Jeannie Meyer testified that she lost her job as a result of her daughter’s\n       disappearance and murder and has remained unemployed since that time.\n       Additionally, her husband had taken off from work to assist in the search for\n       her daughter. She testified that her two sons, Joshua and Jeremy, had\n       experienced severe psychological trauma as a result of their sister’s death.\n       Jeremy had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,\n       and anxiety. He had also been confined to several mental hospitals, boys’\n       homes, and juvenile homes. Joshua, the oldest son, was very angry over his\n       sister’s death.\n\n               Ms. Meyer explained that she could not sleep for a long time following\n       her daughter’s disappearance and felt powerless to protect her children. In\n       addition to suffering from nightmares following her daughter’s disappearance,\n       she also felt very guilty and regretted letting her go outside. She testified that\n       her daughter was a friendly, happy, and well-liked child. Additionally, she\n       was also very talented. She could play the guitar, organ, and drums and sang\n       a solo in church every year.\n\nRogers, 2004 WL 1462649, at *10; see also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 601.\n\n       The Petitioner’s mitigation proof at sentencing consisted of the following:\n\n              The defense called Mildred Denise Rogers to testify. Ms. Rogers is the\n       defendant’s sister. She testified that she was now known as Samuale “Sam”\n       Roger, but her legal name remained Mildred Denise Rogers. She explained\n       that she and her brother grew up in Louisiana and that she was two years old\n       when her parents divorced. Her mother remarried Danny Schexnayder. Ms.\n       Rogers was not fond of her stepfather, but the defendant was always nice to\n       him. The defendant tried to gain the attention of Schexnayder, but he ignored\n       the defendant. During the marriage, Schexnayder became demanding, and\n       their mother was only affectionate to them when Schexnayder was not around.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -13-\n\f        The Schexnayders had two children together, Danny, Jr. and Martin.\nThe defendant was not allowed to play with Danny, Jr. It was following\nDanny, Jr.’s birth that Schexnayder became “physical” with the Rogers\nchildren. Ms. Rogers witnessed Schexnayder pick up the defendant, spank\nhim, and drop him to the floor. At this time, the defendant was five or six\nyears old, and he started to withdraw. Schexnayder would also hit the\ndefendant in the face. Although Ms. Rogers would yell at Schexnayder for\nhitting the defendant, their mother never intervened.\n\n        When the defendant was nine or ten, he ran away from home.\nThereafter, his mother and stepfather would chain him to his bed. On one\noccasion, the defendant was chained to his bed for a couple of days. When the\ndefendant would wet the bed, Schexnayder would take the mattress out to the\nfront yard and push the defendant’s face into it. He would chide the defendant\nby telling him that they were going to let everyone know that he wet the bed.\nOn one occasion, Schexnayder made a sign saying the defendant had wet the\nbed and made him wear it for all the neighbors to see. The defendant also\nbegan to defecate in his pants, and Schexnayder would rub the pants in the\ndefendant’s face. Mildred Rogers testified that Schexnayder began to hit the\ndefendant with anything that was within reach. She recalled that the defendant\nwould often sit on his bed, holding his knees, and rock back and forth. When\nthe defendant was fifteen, Schexnayder beat him with a pole until the\ndefendant was bloody.\n\n        Ms. Rogers testified that after the Schexnayders had children together,\nshe no longer felt that she and the defendant were a part of the family. They\nwere often deprived of food and told they could not eat because their father\nhad not sent their child support check. She remembered that on one occasion\ntheir biological father tried to visit them, but when he arrived, their mother\ncalled the police, telling them that he had not paid his support payments. As\na result, they did not get to see their father. Schexnayder threatened to kill\nthem if they told their father anything. Ms. Rogers recalled that one Christmas\ntheir father sent her a drum set and the defendant a dirt bike. Shortly\nthereafter, Schexnayder broke the drum set and sold the defendant’s dirt bike.\nThe defendant soon began stealing motorcycles in the neighborhood.\n\n       Ms. Rogers testified that she was sexually abused by Schexnayder’s\nbrother, Kenneth. She did not know if the defendant was sexually abused also,\nbut he would hide under the house when Kenneth visited. Although their\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fmother took them for counseling once, she became angry and left when the\ntherapist suggested that she needed help.\n\n       Ms. Rogers began to steal and write bad checks once she left home.\nShe had attempted suicide on several occasions and was confined to a mental\nhospital. She had been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and was\nreceiving treatment. She had also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder,\nmanic-depressive disorder, and borderline personality disorder. She had not\nbeen in any legal trouble for ten or twelve years at the time of her testimony.\n\n       Ms. Rogers testified that the defendant had gone AWOL from the Navy\nin 1980. During that time, he had a serious automobile accident. He received\nhead and eye injuries as a result of the accident. She acknowledged that\nalthough she had suffered an abusive upbringing, she had never murdered or\nraped a child.\n\n        Lazarus Rogers testified that he married the defendant’s mother,\nCynthia, when she was fifteen or sixteen and he was thirty-one or thirty-two.\nThey divorced in 1961 before the defendant was born. After the divorce,\nCynthia returned and told him she was pregnant with his child. They\nreconciled, and the defendant was born in March 1962. In September of that\nyear, they remarried. Cynthia later told him that the defendant was not his son.\nIn 1964, Cynthia left him again and took the children. In 1969, Cynthia asked\nhim for a divorce. At the time, she was living with a man she called her\nhusband and with whom she had two children. Although he had not paid child\nsupport, she had let him see the children until that time. Mr. Rogers testified\nthat the defendant called him on occasion and told him that his mother was not\ngood to him, but Mr. Rogers claimed not to know what was going on in the\nhouse.\n\n       Mr. Rogers testified that the defendant ran away to his house once. The\ndefendant told him that his stepfather tried to beat him with a coat hanger. He\nsaid that the defendant was very withdrawn and that he attempted to get a\npsychological evaluation on the defendant when he was 14.\n\n        Mr. Rogers testified that the defendant’s current wife was much older\nthan the defendant and that she was very dominant. He testified that he was\nin the restaurant on July 8 when the defendant came in. He recalled that the\ndefendant told his wife that he was going to a cabinet shop to look for work,\nand Mrs. Rogers became angry because she did not want him to go.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f        The defendant’s aunt, Peggy Ruth Page, testified that she never saw her\nsister, Cynthia, show any affection toward the defendant or his sister. She\nacknowledged that she knew there was child abuse in the Schexnayder home.\nShe further testified that on more than one occasion the defendant was chained\nto his bed. Although the defendant never told her so, she believed that he had\nbeen sexually abused.\n\n       The defendant’s cousin, Deborah Lynn Miller, testified that she was six\nyears older than the defendant. She confirmed that there was unequal\ntreatment of the Rogers children and the Schexnayder children. She testified\nthat the defendant’s stepfather often yelled at him and called him names.\nAlthough she had never witnessed abuse, she was later told that the children\nwere abused. She also testified that the defendant’s mother told her that she\ndid not love the defendant.\n\n        Two of Mildred Rogers’s friends testified. They corroborated the\nearlier witnesses’ testimony that the defendant and his sister were not given\nattention by the Schexnayders. One of the friends, Lynelle Meadows, testified\nthat she believed that both the defendant and Mildred Rogers had been\nsexually abused by their uncle Kenny.\n\n        The defendant’s elementary school principal, Victoria Meares, testified\nthat the defendant was a discipline problem. She testified that the defendant\nwould often bite other children and was called “Wolfie.” She referred the\ndefendant to a mental health clinic for counseling, but she did not know if he\never received counseling. She testified that the defendant was not able to\ninteract with other children in an appropriate way and lacked social skills.\nAlthough the defendant’s mother was nice, Ms. Meares did not believe that the\nparents gave her consistent, positive support in dealing with the defendant’s\nproblems. She never saw any signs of physical abuse, and the defendant never\nreported any abuse.\n\n       Thomas Neilson, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, was retained by the\ndefense to evaluate the defendant. Dr. Neilson spent twenty-four hours\nexamining the defendant. He also interviewed the defendant’s sister and her\ntherapist and reviewed extensive records collected by the mitigation specialist.\nDr. Neilson testified that the defendant’s life had been very unstable. His\nparents divorced when he was very young, and he changed homes very often.\nHe lived in nine different homes the first ten years of his life and attended ten\nschools, including five elementary schools. He did not have a chance to form\n\n                                      -16-\n\ffriendships. As a result of the foregoing, he experienced feelings of insecurity\nand abandonment.\n\n        Dr. Neilson testified that the defendant performed poorly in school and\nreceived bad grades for conduct. He was suspended several times for his\nconduct, including biting and hitting. Dr. Neilson surmised that although he\nreceived some group therapy and speech therapy, the defendant changed\nschools so often that the school system never had a real opportunity to respond\nto his problems.\n\n        Dr. Neilson testified that the defendant suffered physical, sexual, and\nemotional abuse. Both the defendant and his sister reported being beaten by\ntheir stepfather. Moreover, the defendant’s mother did little to protect him\nfrom the abuse. Dr. Neilson testified that both the defendant and his sister\nfeared for their lives, which had a significant effect over time. The defendant\nreported that his stepfather beat him about the head with a baseball bat, and the\ndefendant’s sister said that she had seen the stepfather hold the defendant\nagainst the wall and cut off his air until he passed out. Dr. Neilson stated that\nthe police were called to the Schexnayder’s home forty times between 1972\nand 1979. According to Dr. Neilson, the police records indicated the\nSchexnayder home was a “very chaotic home environment.”\n\n       Dr. Neilson testified that the defendant said he and his sister were\ntreated much differently than their half-brothers. The defendant said that he\nwas often punished for the acts of his half-brothers and that he and his sister\nwent unfed on several occasions. The defendant stated that he was often\nchained to his bed and that he would howl out of frustration. As a result, he\nwas given the nickname “Wolf.” Dr. Neilson also said that the defendant\nbegan to steal motorcycles in the neighborhood after his stepfather sold the dirt\nbike that his father gave him.\n\n        Dr. Neilson testified that both the defendant and his sister reported\nbeing sexually abused by their uncle. The defendant also reported that he was\nsexually and physically abused by the staff at Louisiana Training Institute in\nthe late 1970s. The defendant further claimed to have been sexually abused\nby a man who gave him a ride after he ran away from home. The defendant’s\nsister also believed that the defendant was sexually abused by a babysitter and\nsomeone who lived in the neighborhood. As a result of these instances, the\ndefendant suffered trauma. Dr. Neilson testified that trauma can have a long-\nterm, permanent effect on the way the brain functions, which can cause mood\n\n                                      -17-\n\fswings, irritability, and anger. Dr. Neilson also testified that children tend to\nimitate learned behavior, including violence and abuse of children.\n\n       As a result of a psychological evaluation, Dr. Neilson diagnosed the\ndefendant with post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder NOS (“not\notherwise specified”), dissociative disorder NOS, and personality disorder\nNOS with antisocial and borderline features, also known as mixed personality\ndisorder. Based on letters the defendant wrote to his father when he was\nyoung, Dr. Neilson believed the defendant dissociated. The defendant signed\nthe letters “William Little” and stated in the letters that he had two\npersonalities – “Billy” and “William.” Although Dr. Neilson concluded that\nthe defendant dissociates, he doubted that he had “full blown dissociative\nidentity disorder.” Dr. Neilson assigned the defendant a GAF, global\nassessment of functioning, of fifty, which is severely impaired.\n\n        On cross-examination, Dr. Neilson acknowledged that this case was his\nfirst criminal forensic case. He also admitted that in preparing his report, he\nrelied upon a lot of information supplied by a capital mitigation specialist. Dr.\nNeilson did not personally interview the defendant’s mother, stepfather,\nsiblings or wife, but relied upon the mitigation specialist’s interviews of those\npeople.\n\n        Dr. Neilson acknowledged that the defendant had spent a total of eleven\nyears in prison during his adult life, excluding his current incarceration. The\ndefendant had been incarcerated in Florida, Mississippi, and Georgia. During\nhis incarceration in Mississippi, a report noted that the defendant’s separate\npersonality, “Billy,” was not “an integrated separate personality, but rather an\nimaginary companion who gets the blame for doing antisocial things.” Dr.\nNeilson admitted that he had never seen the defendant switch personalities.\nThe defendant advised him, however, that he had asked “Billy” if he knew\nanything about the crimes against the victim, and “Billy” denied any\ninvolvement. The defendant also told Dr. Neilson that he had not committed\nthe crimes against the victim and that he had been pressured into giving a false\nconfession. Although Dr. Neilson did not believe that the defendant’s\ndissociative disorder was directly related to the crimes against the victim, he\nsaid it indicated the severity of the defendant’s abuse and trauma.\n\n        Dr. Neilson testified that the defendant fell within the normal range of\nintellectual functioning, had no intercranial abnormalities, had logical and\ncoherent thought processes, and expressed no delusional or paranoid ideas.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f        Dr. Neilson admitted that the defendant’s MMPI test results suggested that the\n        defendant exaggerated his symptoms possibly due to a cry for help or\n        malingering. Dr. Neilson did not believe that the defendant malingered, and\n        he found the MMPI test results to be invalid. Dr. Neilson admitted that part\n        of the defendant’s depression could have resulted from his incarceration and\n        the charges pending against him. Dr. Neilson further admitted that Dr. Caruso\n        . . . had not diagnosed the defendant with any of the Axis I disorders that he\n        found.\n\n                The defense also called Dr. Cecile Guin, a school social worker\n        employed by Louisiana State University, to testify as an expert in the field of\n        social work and Louisiana’s conditions of confinement. Dr. Guin prepared the\n        response on behalf of the State of Louisiana to a federal investigation\n        regarding the treatment of children in state institutions. While the defendant\n        was at Louisiana Training Institute (LTI) in 1978, there was severe abuse of\n        the inmates. In fact, eight guards were terminated and three guards were\n        indicted for beating three juveniles. She testified that children were chained\n        to their beds, hit with belt buckles, hung on clothes-lines, and “popped” in the\n        ear. In addition to officer-inmate violence, there was also inmate-inmate\n        violence.\n\n                Dr. Guin testified that the Louisiana juvenile facilities were essentially\n        racially segregated in 1978 but that the defendant, a Caucasian, had been put\n        into the facility housing African-Americans with the most serious offenses.\n        The institution did not provide adequate counseling or treatment programs\n        during the time the defendant was there. The defendant told Dr. Guin that he\n        had watched other inmates be abused and that he was unable to sleep at night\n        because of fear. He told Dr. Guin that people had attempted to abuse him\n        sexually in the facility, but he denied ever being raped or sexually abused.\n\n               Dr. Guin admitted on cross-examination that the defendant was at LTI\n        for only eleven days before the beating of the three inmates, which spurred the\n        investigation into the facility. Following that time, the facility was watched\n        very closely.\n\n               Dr. Keith Caruso, a forensic psychiatrist, testified . . . [3 ] [that he]\n        interviewed the defendant, his sister, his father, his estranged wife, and his\n\n\n\n        3\n         In its opinion disposing of the Petitioner’s direct appeal, this Court erroneously identified Dr.\nCaruso as a State witness rather than a defense witness.\n                                                  -19-\n\fhigh school principal. He also reviewed the defendant’s prison records, school\nrecords, medical records, mental health records, military records, police\nreports, and witness statements. Dr. Caruso diagnosed the defendant with anti-\nsocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Dr. Caruso\ntestified that people with borderline personality disorder are sensitive to\nabandonment with a tendency to feel empty. He testified that the defendant\nfelt abandoned by his biological father and rejected when his sister left home.\nHe said the defendant felt rejected when his first marriage ended and feared his\nmarriage to Mrs. Rogers was in jeopardy. At the time of the crimes in this\ncase, the defendant was in an abandonment crisis. Not only was the defendant\nfearful of his marriage ending, he was fearful that he was going to lose the\nrenewed relationship he had built with his biological father. According to Dr.\nCaruso, Mrs. Rogers, the defendant’s current wife, was a mother figure to him.\nAt the time of the crimes, the defendant was symbolically being abandoned by\nboth his mother and father again. Dr. Caruso theorized that the murder of the\nvictim was a response to feeling so abandoned, which caused the defendant to\nact out in ways that had been modeled for him.\n\n       Dr. Caruso did not diagnose the defendant with post-traumatic stress\ndisorder because he did not exhibit all of the symptoms. Also, Dr. Caruso did\nnot believe that psychotic or dissociative symptoms played a role in the crimes\ncommitted in this case.\n\n         Dr. Mark Cunningham, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testified\nregarding a violence risk assessment he performed on the defendant. He\ntestified that if the defendant were sentenced to life imprisonment, he would\nbe a capital offender in the general prison population and would be a long term\ninmate. The defendant was thirty-seven years old, and his age would\nsubstantially reduce his risk level compared to other inmates. Further, the\ndefendant did not have a history of assaultive behavior while in prison, but he\ndid have a history of minor disciplinary problems. He also had a history of\nthreatening to retaliate against other inmates who threatened him. Dr.\nCunningham concluded that the defendant had an eight to seventeen percent\nchance of committing a violent act of a serious nature while in prison. He\nadmitted on cross-examination that the defendant would be a “significant risk”\nif left in the community. He agreed that if the defendant were in prison until\na very old age, he would not likely commit future violent crimes. Dr.\nCunningham also admitted that the defendant had previously escaped from\nprison, which he considered as a factor against the defendant. However, Dr.\nCunningham did not believe that the defendant’s prior prison escape, his prior\n\n                                      -20-\n\f       criminal record, or his history of incarceration was a good predictor of violent\n       conduct in prison.\n\nRogers, 2004 WL 1462649, at *10-15; see also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 601-03.\n\n        The State presented rebuttal testimony at sentencing from the Petitioner’s current\nwife, Juanita Rogers, and his ex-wife, Lisa Sanders. Through the testimony of Juanita\nRogers, the State introduced a letter that the Petitioner had written to her while incarcerated\nprior to trial in which he “told her that he would not plead guilty to something that he had not\ndone and stated, ‘If I do get time, they will either kill me trying to escape or I’ll kill myself.’”\nRogers, 188 S.W.3d at 603. Juanita Rogers and Sanders also both testified that the Petitioner\nnever had mentioned to them that he had been physically or sexually abused as a child. Id.\nFinally, the State presented rebuttal testimony from its own mental health expert, Dr. William\nBernet, “who diagnosed the defendant with dissociative disorder, pedophilia, malingering,\nand anti-social disorder.” Rogers, 2004 WL 1462649, at *16; see also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d\nat 604. The substance of Dr. Bernet’s testimony was as follows:\n\n       Dr. Bernet testified that he believed the defendant was malingering his\n       dissociative disorder in order to make it seem worse than it was. Dr. Bernet\n       did not believe that the defendant was under extreme mental or emotional\n       distress at the time of the crimes in this case, and he did not believe that a\n       connection existed between the defendant’s dissociative disorder and the\n       crimes committed against the victim. Dr. Bernet also stated that no direct\n       connection existed between the defendant’s difficult childhood and the crimes\n       against the victim. According to him, the two factors that played a role in the\n       defendant committing the crimes against the victim were the defendant’s anti-\n       social personality disorder and pedophilia.\n\nRogers, 2004 WL 1462649, at *16.\n\n       Based upon the proof presented during the sentencing phase, the jury found that the\nfollowing four aggravating circumstances had been proven by the State beyond a reasonable\ndoubt: (1) that the murder was committed against a person less than twelve years of age and\nthe defendant was eighteen years of age or older; (2) that the defendant previously had been\nconvicted of one or more felonies, other than the present charge, whose statutory elements\ninvolved the use of violence to a person; (3) that the murder was committed for the purpose\nof avoiding, interfering with, or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution of the defendant\nor another; and (4) that the murder was knowingly committed, solicited, directed, or aided\nby the defendant, while the defendant had a substantial role in committing or attempting to\ncommit, or was fleeing after having a substantial role in committing or attempting to commit,\n\n                                               -21-\n\fany rape or kidnapping. Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 604; see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-\n204(i)(1), (2), (6) and (7) (Supp. 1996). The jury also concluded that these statutory\naggravating circumstances outweighed any mitigating circumstances presented by the\ndefense beyond a reasonable doubt and sentenced the Petitioner to death for the murder of\nJackie Beard. Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 604; see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-13-204(g)(1)(B).\nOn direct review, this Court affirmed the Petitioner’s convictions and sentences, including\nhis sentence of death, as did the supreme court upon automatic review. See Rogers, 2004\nWL 1462649, at *1; Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 598.\n\n                              Post-Conviction Proceedings\n\n       On November 2, 2006, the Petitioner filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief\nchallenging his convictions and sentences. Upon consideration of the pro se petition, the\npost-conviction court appointed the Office of the Post-Conviction Defender (OPCD) as\ncounsel of record for the Petitioner but later removed the OPCD as counsel based upon a\ndemonstrated, actual conflict of interest. After the post-conviction court appointed new\ncounsel for the Petitioner, an amended petition was filed on March 21, 2008.\n\n        Following the filing of the State’s answer to the petition and amended petition,\ncounsel for the Petitioner filed a motion for DNA testing asking that the post-conviction\ncourt order new forensic DNA analysis of the four (4) swatches of fabric cut from the shorts\nfound near the victim’s remains to determine if DNA could now be obtained from the semen\nstains and compared to the Petitioner’s DNA sequence. The post-conviction court granted\nthis motion and ordered that “Y-STR” DNA testing, which was not available at the time of\ntrial and which tests specifically for the presence of male DNA, be conducted on the clothing\nswatches to determine if the Petitioner’s DNA sequence was present.\n\n        A second amended petition for post-conviction relief was filed on May 26, 2009,\nraising the claims as framed and argued by counsel in this appeal. After the State filed its\nanswer to the second amended petition, the post-conviction court held an evidentiary hearing\non March 30 and 31, 2010. On the second day of the hearing, counsel for the Petitioner\nintroduced as an exhibit an order signed by the post-conviction court incorporating into the\nrecord of these post-conviction proceedings “the entire record on appeal” from the\nPetitioner’s direct appeal proceedings in both this Court and the supreme court. During the\nhearing, the Petitioner presented testimony from the following witnesses: Assistant District\nPublic Defender Charles Bloodworth, one of the attorneys who represented the Petitioner at\nthe trial level; Jerome Converse, lead counsel for the Petitioner at trial; Dr. Pamela Auble,\na forensic psychologist; and Meghan Clement, the forensic biologist with Laboratory\nCorporation of America (“Lab Corp.”) who testified as an expert for the State at the\nPetitioner’s trial and who later performed the Y-STR DNA testing ordered by the post-\n\n                                            -22-\n\fconviction court. The State presented testimony from the following witnesses at the hearing:\nAssistant District Public Defender Collier Goodlett, an attorney who initially represented the\nPetitioner prior to trial; Ronald L. Lax, the owner of Inquisitor, Inc., the private investigation\nfirm hired by Converse to investigate the Petitioner’s case for the defense prior to trial; Billy\nBatson, the lead investigator for the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department on the\nPetitioner’s case; and Mark Squibb, the forensic biologist who performed the initial\nserological analysis of the victim’s shorts when he worked for the Tennessee Bureau of\nInvestigation (TBI) crime lab prior to the Petitioner’s trial.\n\n        Charles Bloodworth testified that he had been an Assistant District Public Defender\nfor approximately twenty (20) years. He was appointed to represent the Petitioner in 1996,\nat around the time of the Petitioner’s arraignment. Bloodworth had never tried a capital case\nprior to this appointment and was not yet “capital-qualified.” Bloodworth testified that he\nrepresented the Petitioner “for about four or five months,” a period which included the initial\nphases of discovery. He met with the Petitioner several times at the jail and discussed with\nthe Petitioner the discovery provided by the State.\n\n        Bloodworth testified that he had some difficulty receiving discovery from the State\nin this case. He explained that “there was zero discovery furnished at arraignment, nothing\nbut a copy of the indictment,” and that “[i]t was at least thirty and probably more like forty-\nfive to sixty days before [the defense] received the first piece of paper from the District\nAttorney’s Office that could amount to discovery.” Bloodworth testified about the problems\nhe had with discovery during his representation of the Petitioner:\n\n               We had a series of discovery conferences but most of those consisted\n       of a meeting at the District Attorney’s Office where then District Attorney,\n       Lance Baker, would produce, for example, a cardboard box of photographs\n       and in the presence of a court reporter, one-by-one present me a photograph\n       and I would acknowledge receipt of it. It was not discovery in the sense of\n       here is a cardboard box full of evidence, we intend to present. Here’s witness\n       statements and so on. It was a very slow drawn out, one-by-one, page-by-\n       page, with the court reporter writing down what I was getting, [a] process of\n       stalling and delay.\n\nBloodworth later learned that the Petitioner had been making telephone calls from the jail to\nthe victim’s family. The District Attorney’s Office found out about the calls and “gave the\nfamily either a tape recorder or instructions on how to get a tape record” and “record [the\nPetitioner’s] telephone calls to the family.” Bloodworth testified that he later learned that\nthe Petitioner also had made at least one telephone call from the jail to the local newspaper.\nBloodworth stated that he believed the State “knew that eventually they were going to have\n\n                                              -23-\n\fto disclose” to defense counsel the Petitioner’s statements to the victim’s family and the local\nnewspaper and that, as soon as they did, defense counsel would “clamp down” on the\nPetitioner and “cut off his phone privileges.” Bloodworth testified that he believed “there\nwas a deliberate effort to delay letting [him] know that [the Petitioner] was making telephone\ncalls to the victim’s family and [that] those telephone calls were being recorded.”\nBloodworth stated that discovery by the State “was stalled out” to allow for the phone calls\nto continue as long as possible. He testified that describing the State’s “stalling tactics” with\nregard to discovery as being “prosecutorial misconduct” would be appropriate given that they\nwere dragging out discovery as long as possible in order to avoid informing defense counsel\nabout the Petitioner’s uncounseled and recorded telephone calls. Bloodworth testified that\nhe told the Petitioner during one of their last meetings not to make any more telephone calls\nto the newspaper or the victim’s family.\n\n       Bloodworth also testified on direct examination that, when it was apparent that\ndiscovery was not forthcoming, he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. Bloodworth\nexplained:\n\n       One week I would go over and be given five pieces of paper. The next week\n       I would go over and be given twenty photographs of cigarette butts. What is\n       this for? Well, we’ll get to it later and so eventually I got frustrated and just\n       filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to comply with discovery\n       and other things.\n\nHowever, Bloodworth testified that the State’s failure to provide discovery was only part of\nthe motivation behind the motion, the other being “a lack of speedy trial.” In the motion,\nfiled on June 17, 1997, and a copy of which was introduced into evidence at the post-\nconviction hearing, Bloodworth alleged under oath that the Petitioner had been arrested on\nJuly 12, 1996, that he had entered a plea of not guilty and demanded a speedy trial at his\narraignment on October 15, 1996, and that the State had since that time failed to comply with\ndefense counsel’s demands for discovery. Bloodworth recalled that, at the hearing on the\nmotion, the trial court treated it as a motion to dismiss the indictment based upon a speedy\ntrial violation. In the order denying the motion, a copy of which also was introduced into\nevidence at the post-conviction hearing, the trial court focused exclusively upon the alleged\nspeedy trial violation and determined that no such violation had occurred after analyzing the\nfactors set forth in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), and adopted by the Tennessee\nSupreme Court in State v. Bishop, 493 S.W.2d 81 (Tenn. 1973). The order denying the\nmotion to dismiss recites the following procedural history regarding the “broken series of\nhearings” held on the motion:\n\n\n\n\n                                              -24-\n\f              A hearing began on July 18, 1997 during which the parties moved to\n       close the proceedings due to what was characterized as highly prejudicial\n       material. No proof was presented during the closed session; however, defense\n       counsel, Charles S. Bloodworth[,] and assistant attorney general Lance Baker\n       made their respective arguments concerning the motions. Several media\n       sources filed motions to open the proceedings. On July 26, 1997, the Court\n       conducted a hearing on the closure motion and held that further proceedings\n       must remain open to the media. Further proof and argument were offered on\n       September 11, 1997.\n\n      When asked at the post-conviction hearing whether he intended the motion to be\nprimarily about a speedy trial violation, Bloodworth responded:\n\n       Clearly, the speedy trial in – it was stalling on the part of the State because the\n       body had not been found and I wanted to get to trial if I could, before the body\n       had been found. I said we can’t go to trial until we get discovery and check\n       out what you have, what evidence of death, if any, is there? [The Petitioner]\n       had made some inconsistent statements as to perhaps running over the child,\n       in the car, backing up on the hilltop. We went out and looked at the scene and\n       walked the area, so I was trying to bring the case to a conclusion within a – to\n       trial by a jury within six months or seven months of his arrest. Hopefully, to\n       be blunt about it, before the body was found and that did not happen.\n\nOn cross-examination, Bloodworth admitted that the Petitioner had given a statement early\non in the investigation to the effect that he had run over the victim, that there had been blood\ncoming out of her mouth and nose, and that while she was still breathing he threw her off a\nbridge into the Cumberland River. Bloodworth also admitted on cross-examination that the\ntime between the Petitioner’s arrest and the discovery of the victim’s body was “what would\nnormally be a short period of time in a homicide case” to prepare for trial.\n\n       Bloodworth testified that as soon as the victim’s body was discovered, and it was\napparent “the State was almost certainly going to file capital,” the State became more\nforthcoming in the discovery process. At that point, the State no longer required a court\nreporter to be there to record the delivery to defense counsel of each document of discovery.\nInstead, the State gave Bloodworth “bundles of paper” that he would then sign for. On cross-\nexamination, Bloodworth admitted that the discovery ultimately provided by the State\ncomprised “three or four or five cardboard boxes, so-called Banker’s boxes full of\ndocuments.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              -25-\n\f       Bloodworth testified that his representation of the Petitioner ceased at the direction\nof the District Public Defender because continuing the representation would have hampered\nBloodworth’s ability to represent other clients for which the Public Defender was court-\nappointed counsel. Because the District Public Defender knew Jerry Converse to be an\nexperienced attorney who had done capital cases, he pulled Bloodworth off the case and\nasked that Converse be appointed to represent the Petitioner. Converse was appointed and\nBloodworth thereupon ceased working on the case and turned his file over to Converse.\n\n       Jerry Converse, a Robertson County attorney, was appointed to represent the\nPetitioner in “late 1996 or early 1997.” At the time of the post-conviction hearing, Converse\nhad been licensed to practice law for “[a] little over twenty years.” He testified that, during\nthe time he represented the Petitioner, he did a lot of criminal work and that as he has gotten\nolder his practice has gradually focused more on civil litigation. Before being appointed to\nrepresent the Petitioner, Converse had handled “several murder trials,” including at least one\ncapital case that he could recall. However, he testified that he had never seen and was not\nfamiliar with the 1989 American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and\nPerformance in Death Penalty Cases at the time of the Petitioner’s trial, a copy of which was\nintroduced into evidence at the hearing. On cross-examination, Converse testified that he\nhad “never, ever worked on a case as hard as [he] did on this one,” and had not worked as\nhard on a case since.\n\n        Converse testified that he was co-counsel on the case for a time with Assistant District\nPublic Defender Charles Bloodworth. Converse became lead counsel upon his appointment\nbecause Bloodworth was not qualified to be lead counsel. Some time later Bloodworth\nwithdrew from the case and Larry Warner, a private attorney out of Crossville, was appointed\nas second-chair counsel.4 Warner stayed on the case as co-counsel through the conclusion\nof the trial. According to Converse, his knowledge of the case probably exceeded Warner’s\nsimply by virtue of the length of time Converse had been on the case relative to Warner.\nConverse and Warner hired the investigative firm of Inquisitor, Inc., owned by Ronald Lax,\nto provide assistance in the investigation for both the guilt and penalty phases. They also\nutilized the assistance of David Keefe and Kelly Gleason, who now works for the OCPD, to\n“bounc[e] ideas off,” and Converse testified that these individuals were a “big help” on the\ncase. In fact, Converse recalled that these attorneys actually drafted a motion for Converse’s\nsignature that was filed in the Petitioner’s case. However, Converse could not recall which\nmotion.\n\n        Converse testified that there was no clear division of labor between him and Warner\nprior to trial, but that as trial approached they decided that each attorney would handle certain\n\n\n       4\n           Larry Warner is now a judge for the General Sessions Court for Cumberland County.\n                                                  -26-\n\ftasks and examine certain witnesses. Converse explained that their division of labor “was\nnot kind of what was traditional at the time” in terms of one attorney handling the guilt phase\nand the other attorney handling the penalty phase. Instead, they “both worked on both\nphases.”\n\n        A copy of the indictment charging the Petitioner with the crimes for which he\nultimately was convicted in this case was introduced into evidence during Converse’s\ntestimony, as were copies of the certified fee claims from Converse and Warner submitted\nto the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) for their representation of the Petitioner.\nWhen shown copies of the certified fee claims, Converse admitted that the first date upon\nwhich he billed for any activity on the case was November 3, 1997. He also admitted that\nthe first date denoted in the billing records for a meeting between him and the Petitioner was\nMarch 13, 1998, at the jail facility in Montgomery County. However, Converse testified that\nthese records did not correspond to his recollection that he was involved in the case prior to\nNovember of 1997. Converse stated that he was “sure” that he met with the Petitioner before\nMarch of 1998 because it is his “custom to go see the client pretty quick after [he is]\nappointed.” However, Converse admitted that he had no “independent recollection” of the\ndate upon which he first met with the Petitioner. Converse stated that his practice at the time\nwas to try to record accurately all time he spent on a case for billing purposes, but that\nsometimes he would forget to write time entries down for a particular case if he was away\nfrom the office when working on that case. Converse testified, though, that a meeting with\nthe Petitioner would have been significant enough in terms of recording the time spent for\nit for him not to forget to bill for it. Converse testified that fairly early in the course of the\nrepresentation, after he first met with the Petitioner at the Montgomery County Jail, he had\nhim moved to the Robertson County Jail both to have easier access to the Petitioner and to\nkeep the Petitioner away from the media in Montgomery County.\n\n       Converse testified that he knew that the discovery process in the case “started out\nrather adversarial” between the prosecution and Bloodworth. However, after Converse\n“came on board,” he had “a good working relationship” with the State relative to the\ndiscovery process. He denied that the State withheld anything from the defense or acted in\nbad faith during discovery. In fact, “it was almost the opposite effect.” Converse explained:\n\n       It was very much open file . . . . I felt like they handed over everything. I\n       think he was so afraid that he would leave something out, he would just give\n       me everything, probably stuff I wasn’t even entitled to.\n\nConverse received “quite a few” photographs from the State, some of which were identified\nand introduced during his testimony at the post-conviction hearing. They consisted of\nphotographs of the “mud hole” discussed in the testimony presented at trial as well as\n\n                                              -27-\n\fphotographs of both the exteriors and interiors of the white Chevrolet Celebrity vehicle\nbelonging to the Petitioner and the inoperable blue Oldsmobile Omega belonging to the\nPetitioner. Converse explained that the Petitioner’s white Celebrity was similar to a white\ncar driven by Quinton Donaldson, the friend of the Petitioner’s who was considered a suspect\nby law enforcement early in the investigation of the case.\n\n       Converse recalled that Assistant District Public Defender Collier Goodlett had been\ninvolved in the Petitioner’s case as counsel around the time of the Petitioner’s arrest.\nGoodlett had gone “out to a bridge over the Cumberland River out here with [the Petitioner]\nand the police . . . for the purpose of [the Petitioner] showing the police where he had\nclaimed to have thrown the body of the victim off of the bridge.” Converse’s knowledge of\nthis event came from documents produced by the State during discovery. When asked\nwhether he ever talked to Goodlett about the bridge trip, Converse stated: “I’m sure I did way\nback then.”\n\n        Converse was asked to identify the motion to suppress signed and filed by him in the\nPetitioner’s case and a copy of said pleading was introduced into evidence at the hearing.\nHowever, he was asked no questions about the motion during his direct examination. On\ncross-examination, Converse stated that he did not believe the Petitioner’s initial statement\nto law enforcement – to the effect that he ran over the victim and then threw her in the\nCumberland River – was coerced. Converse also made clear on cross-examination that,\nduring their pretrial work on the case, the defense had referred the Petitioner’s initial\nstatements to Dr. Richard Ofshe, a sociologist from California whose research focused\nlargely on police interrogation techniques, to determine whether the Petitioner’s statements\nmight have been false and given solely for the purpose of garnering publicity. However,\nafter reviewing the statements, Dr. Ofshe could not conclude that the Petitioner’s statements\nwere false.\n\n        Converse also was asked during his direct examination to identify the motion to\nprohibit the death qualification of prospective jurors signed and filed by him in the\nPetitioner’s case, and a copy of that pleading was introduced into evidence at the hearing.\nHowever, Converse had no specific recollection of having drafted the motion and believed\nthat its substance came out of a capital case motions bank available to him at the time. He\nfurther testified that there was no particular reason why he filed it other than because it was\none of motions “that you are supposed to file in a capital case.”\n\n       Converse recalled that “this case stayed in the news for quite some time,” partly due\nto the State but also because the Petitioner himself kept it “in the media.” Converse\nexplained that he “had to get a gag order basically against my own client to keep him from\ntalking to the press” because that was something he “could not tolerate.” Converse also\n\n                                             -28-\n\ftestified that “the victim’s family kept it in the press quite a bit as well” but stated that he\nprobably would have done “the same thing in that situation.” Converse also testified that\nduring the same period of time the Petitioner’s case was in the news, there were two or three\nother cases involving the disappearance of little girls that the media would mention all\ntogether when something happened in one of the cases.\n\n        Converse recalled that the Petitioner’s trial occurred in January of 2000, and that it\nlasted approximately between two to two and a half weeks. The process of jury selection was\nthat a pool of prospective jurors was created through individual voir dire and then group voir\ndire followed. The juror questionnaires utilized in the case were prepared as a group effort\nby the prosecution and defense attorneys. Converse recalled reviewing those questionnaires\nupon their completion; however, he could not recall taking any notes as he reviewed the\nquestionnaires.\n\n        Converse testified that he was not involved in the individual voir dire process and that\nWarner primarily handled all jury selection issues with the assistance of a jury selection\nconsultant hired by the defense. In fact, when presented during his testimony with what were\nidentified as copies of the jury questionnaires completed by the twelve jurors who sat on the\nPetitioner’s case, Converse stated that he had no independent recollection of the documents.\nHe acknowledged that they appeared to be consistent with completed questionnaires in the\nPetitioner’s case. Converse also admitted that his fee claims from the Petitioner’s case\nincluded only two time entries associated with the jury questionnaires: for time spent making\ncopies of the questionnaires and for distributing some late questionnaires.\n\n        Converse testified that he did “not sit[] in during individual voir dire” and was not\ninvolved in any of the challenges that occurred at that stage of the jury selection process.\nConverse stated that he likely spoke to Warner regarding the progress of individual voir dire\nat the time, but that he could not recall any of the specifics of their conversations. When\nasked for the defense strategy on selecting jurors, Converse replied:\n\n              I don’t remember having any specific input on the type of jurors overall\n       that we were looking for. I think that that was something that I relied upon\n       Mr. Warner and the jury selection expert to do. I don’t recall that I was\n       involved in that aspect of it personally.\n\nConverse defended his deference to Warner by pointing out that Warner “had a pretty good\npedigree so to speak as far as capital cases in East Tennessee and Middle Tennessee,” that\nWarner “knew what he was doing,” and that Warner “wasn’t somebody right out of law\nschool or something to that effect.” Converse stated that he had never handled a capital voir\ndire in his career.\n\n                                              -29-\n\f        Converse conceded during his testimony that it might have raised “somewhat of a red\nflag” with him if he had known that some of the jurors seated in the case had indicated on\ntheir questionnaires that they automatically would impose a death sentence in a case\ninvolving the death of a child, particularly given that one of the aggravators noticed by the\nState in the Petitioner’s case was that the murder was committed against a person less than\ntwelve years of age by a defendant eighteen years of age or older. Converse further conceded\nthat asking prospective jurors about their ability to consider a defendant’s upbringing and\nmental health issues in determining the appropriate sentence would have been useful during\njury selection given the mitigation proof pursued by the defense in this case. However, when\nasked if he had any conversations with Warner about what kind of jurors they were looking\nfor with respect to the potential mitigation proof, Converse responded: “I don’t recall any\nspecific discussion, but I can’t say they didn’t occur. I don’t recall. I think they would have\noccurred, but I don’t recall specifically.”\n\n       Converse also did not recall being involved in the group voir dire portion of jury\nselection until he reviewed the transcript in preparation for the post-conviction hearing. In\nfact, when presented during his testimony with what were identified as copies of the\nperemptory challenge sheets from the Petitioner’s case, Converse stated that he could not\nconfirm that the documents were the challenge sheets because he could not recall having seen\nthe presented documents before. Converse identified the signature of Larry Warner on the\nchallenge sheets purporting to come from the defense. Converse also testified that he knew\nthat Warner had not exercised all of his available peremptory challenges. When asked\nwhether that presented a problem for appellate purposes, Converse stated that Warner “may\nhave been satisfied with the jury that he had at that point.” Converse explained:\n\n       I recall a conversation where he said he hadn’t used them all, but he was\n       satisfied with what he had as far as the jurors went and I remember saying\n       something to the effect of well, if you are satisfied, just because you use some\n       more challenges, doesn’t mean that you are going to end up with a better jury.\n       I mean, he could very well have gotten some people on there and run out of\n       challenges and not been able to get them off, so I don’t think we took the\n       approach that we had to use all the challenges. I do recall us having a\n       conversation about that, yes.\n\n        Converse admitted that the prosecution’s theory in this case was that the victim was\ntaken from her home in Montgomery County, that she was raped at some point, and that her\nremains were later found in Stewart County. When asked to describe the theory of defense\nat the guilt phase of the Petitioner’s trial, Converse responded:\n\n\n\n\n                                             -30-\n\f       The theory at the guilt/innocence phase was to hopefully create enough doubt\n       to keep Mr. Rogers from receiving the death penalty. In other words, I had a\n       pretty good idea a guilty verdict was coming. We had a dead eight-year old\n       child or nine-year old child and a fairly conservative area. We had all kinds\n       of circumstantial evidence and we had a defendant [who] was not very – I\n       thought would be very sympathetic to a jury. So I had an idea it was coming.\n       My thought was during the guilt/innocence phase to perhaps create enough\n       doubt that it would carry over to the sentencing phase, kind of lingering doubt\n       type of defense.\n\n       ....\n\n               Just looking at it realistically in my mind – there were some bad facts\n       in this case and numerous people that were involved in the case besides me,\n       other attorneys and stuff that I would consult – all saw it the same way, that I\n       mean – it was a case that would be very difficult to win on a guilty or not\n       guilty type of thing and we would throw the rape out altogether on the\n       abduction of the child from that particular area, obviously would be\n       kidnapping and the fact that the child was deceased almost automatically was\n       a felony murder. The circumstances of the case – were if he were found guilty,\n       there were two or three aggravators that kicked in right away on the capital\n       side, so I mean there – there was some pretty tough cards dealt to us on the\n       guilt phase. I mean – we did the best that we could with him under the\n       circumstances, but speaking just for myself and probably for Mr. Warner, we\n       probably had a pretty good idea that we were going to be pretty hot and heavy\n       into [the] sentencing phase afterwards.\n\nConverse testified the defense team considered the possibility of the Petitioner’s testifying\nat both phases of the trial but concluded that his testimony “would have been a disaster.”\nHowever, Converse could not recall why they reached that conclusion.\n\n       Converse testified that he did not believe at the time, nor has he ever thought, that the\nState presented sufficient evidence establishing that the victim was raped. Converse\nadmitted that the only proof presented by the State in support of the victim’s having been\nraped was the evidence concerning “semen or sperm” having been found on the victim’s\nshorts that were discovered in Stewart County. However, Converse stated that the State\nnever established at trial “who emitted that fluid.” Converse also conceded that the only\npossible proof of the rape occurring in Montgomery County was that the victim was wearing\nthe shorts that were found near her body while she was still in Montgomery County.\nConverse testified that he is “certain” he considered filing a motion to sever the rape charge\n\n                                              -31-\n\ffrom the remaining charges, but that he could not recall in his mind the specific strategy for\nnot doing so. On cross-examination, he stated that the facts underlying all the charges in this\ncase were “a series of events that started in one county and ended in another” and that his\nopinion was that venue “probably could have been in either” county.\n\n        Converse testified that members of the defense team drove the distance between\nwhere the victim was abducted near her home and the location where her remains were found\nand determined that it would have taken between forty-five minutes to an hour to make the\ntrip by car. Converse explained that they did this because the time and location given by\nEdra Landon, a defense witness at trial, about when she saw the Petitioner at a gas station on\nthe afternoon the victim disappeared was not consistent with the time it would have taken the\nPetitioner to abduct the victim and dump her body where it was later found. A memorandum\nprepared by an employee of Inquisitor, Inc. regarding Landon’s statement to the defense\ninvestigator that she had seen the Petitioner at 4:00 p.m. at the Phillips 66 gas station on\nRiverside Drive on the afternoon of July 8, 1996, was identified by Converse and introduced\ninto evidence at the hearing below. Converse stated that this memorandum was available to\ndefense counsel prior to trial. When asked whether there was time for a rape of the victim to\nhave occurred in Montgomery County based upon the timeline established by Landon’s\nstatement, Converse replied: “I guess it could have occurred in fifteen minutes.”\n\n        Upon being shown a 1996 article in a French Canadian forensic science journal\ndetailing the transfer of sperm on one article of clothing to other clothes washed together in\na washing machine, Converse testified that, had he known about the article, “it probably\nwould have been something we certainly would have considered using” because there were\nother males living in the household with the victim at the time of her death, including her\nolder brother, Jeremy Beard. When asked whether he recalled doing “any independent\nresearch” leading up to the Petitioner’s trial “on potential semen evidence” like that discussed\nin the Canadian article, Converse responded that he had, yet he admitted to not having found\nthe particular 1996 article presented to him at the hearing. Converse testified that, once the\nDNA test results came back as inconclusive regarding the Petitioner’s being linked to the\nsperm found in the victim’s shorts, he “wasn’t as concerned about [the sperm evidence] at\nthat point.” Converse also testified on cross-examination that he was not sure he “could have\ngotten a jury to swallow” the theory posited in the Canadian article regarding washing\nmachine sperm transfer.\n\n        Converse testified that he recalled talking to Meghan Clement prior to trial regarding\nthe forensic work she did on the case. However, he had no specific recollection of having\ntalked to Mark Squibb prior to trial regarding his forensic work on the case. When presented\nduring his testimony with what was identified as a copy of Squibb’s “bench notes” regarding\nthe forensic testing he performed on the case, Converse stated that he had no idea what the\n\n                                              -32-\n\fnotations “AP spray” or “p30” meant in the notes. Converse also recalled reviewing the\nreports from the FBI concerning that agency’s forensic testing of soil samples taken from the\nPetitioner’s car for comparison with soil samples taken from the area where the victim’s body\nwas found. Converse acknowledged that the results of the reports – i.e., that the soil samples\ndid not match – certainly did not hurt the Petitioner’s defense.\n\n       Converse also identified during his testimony various documents he had seen during\nhis preparations for the Petitioner’s trial, including: the written report prepared by Dr.\nMarks, the forensic anthropologist who testified at the Petitioner’s trial; the TBI request for\nforensic examination of the Petitioner’s 1987 white four-door Chevrolet Celebrity vehicle\nto determine whether blood, hair, fibers and fingerprints were present in the vehicle; the\nwritten report prepared by the TBI concerning the results of its microanalysis of hair and\ncarpet fibers; the written TBI report prepared by Mark Squibb concerning the results of his\nserological testing; and the written TBI report concerning the results of a polygraph\nexamination of Quinton Donaldson indicating that he had been deceptive when asked\nquestions in the fall of 1996 about the victim’s disappearance and death. However, Converse\nwas asked no further questions during his direct examination about any of these documents.\n\n       On cross-examination, Converse recalled that the sperm heads found by Squibb during\nhis analysis were located in the crotch area of the victim’s shorts. Converse also testified on\ncross-examination that there was a lot of information and evidence in the case that “never\neven made it into the trial” because the prosecution agreed early on to “just admit what [was]\nnecessary to get the job done and not bring in all of these other things that may or may not\ngive the [d]efense a basis to appeal.” For example, Converse explained that the defense hired\nan expert to look at the carpet fiber evidence. However, her analysis uncovered evidence not\nnoticed by the State’s experts “that would have been a shot to the head for us, . . . a killer\nshot.” He explained:\n\n               There was some question about the fibers from [the Petitioner’s] living\n       room floor carpet being consistent with some fibers found on the victim or the\n       victim’s clothing[.] And she said year – I remember her looking at that but\n       something that was – nobody else took any further than here, but there were\n       some stains on that particular fiber – grease or dirt or something on that same\n       fiber that matched up.\n\nConverse testified that, upon hearing this, he told the expert “thank you,” “[d]on’t write that\ndown,” and “have a nice day.”\n\n      Converse testified that part of the defense theory at trial was that the source of the\nsemen found in the victim’s shorts was possibly the victim’s older brother or Quinton\n\n                                             -33-\n\fDonaldson, a friend of the Petitioner’s who was considered a suspect by law enforcement\nearly in the investigation. Converse stated that, in order to support the possibility that the\nvictim’s older brother was the source, the defense attempted to get before the jury some\nDepartment of Children’s Services (DCS)/Department of Human Services (DHS) records in\nwhich there was a statement from Jeremy Beard “to the effect that his father – natural father,\nhad taught him – something about taught him how to have sex with his sister or something\nto that effect.” Converse testified that the statements were made “to some sort of case\nworker or something along that line.” Converse admitted that the defense tried to get these\nrecords introduced into evidence at the Petitioner’s trial, but that the trial court ruled that they\nwere inadmissible. Converse also testified that the trial court’s decision not to allow the\nrecords to be presented to the jury was raised as an issue in the Petitioner’s direct appeal.\nHowever, Converse admitted that there was a problem with the appellate issue because the\nrecords had never been made part of an offer of proof at trial.\n\n        Post-conviction counsel then introduced under seal through Converse excerpts from\nthe DCS/DHS record on Jeremy Beard that defense counsel attempted to have introduced\nduring the Petitioner’s trial. A review of these documents makes clear that they are from\ntreatment Beard received in 1997, after the victim’s death. These records contain statements\nfrom Jeannie Meyer, the victim’s and Jeremy’s mother, indicating that Jeremy Beard “was\nclose to his sister,” that Jeannie Meyer divorced the children’s biological father after “the\nDHS investigated physical abuse reported by the children,” and that Jeremy’s medical file\nindicated that his biological father taught him “how to have sex with his sister and that his\ndad watched while he had sex with his sister (who died 8 months ago).” The records contain\nthe following excerpts from a February 1997 psychological evaluation of Jeremy:\n\n       Jeremy maintained that he experiences guilt related to his sister’s death, “I\n       didn’t go over that day,” “I didn’t go with her” (he did not explain the actual\n       events that led up to his sister’s death, but he is apparently referring to him not\n       being with her and being unable to prevent the murder). He said that if he had\n       went with his sister, he could have possibly prevented her death, but when\n       asked how he could have done that, he replied “I don’t know.” As one might\n       expect, Jeremy is experiencing extensive difficulty trusting others and is\n       particularly suspicious of others’ motives.\n\n               Information contained within Jeremy’s medical file suggested that he\n       has allegedly sexually acted-out with his sister and others. Jeremy was asked\n       if he has ever sexually acted-out to which he responded (after a long pause),\n       “I don’t know.” . . . When asked if he ever sexually acted-out with Jackie\n       (sister), he said “No”; when asked if he can be trusted, he replied “Yeah.”\n\n\n\n                                               -34-\n\f       Jeremy was asked if he has experienced sexual abuse to which he answered\n       “No.”\n\nThe records also contain the following excerpts from a psychological evaluation of Jeremy\nin March of 1997:\n\n       According to Mrs. Meyer, Jeremy has disclosed to the family therapist, Vonda\n       St. Amant, that Mr. Beard taught Jeremy “how to have sex with his little sister,\n       Jackie.” It has not been determined if any inappropriate activity occurred\n       between Jeremy and Jackie, although it is suspected based on what Jeremy\n       disclosed. Mrs. Meyer continued to say that on one other occasion, Jeremy\n       told her his father physically and sexually abused him. Jeremy refuses to\n       discuss this issue any further when it is brought into the open.\n\n        Converse testified that Dr. Keith Caruso, the defense psychiatrist who testified at\nsentencing, was one of the witnesses “handled” primarily by attorney Warner at trial.\nConverse had no “independent recollection of Dr. Caruso at all in the sentencing hearing.”\nConverse also could not say what the defense team was “thinking at the time, one way or the\nother” regarding any particular reason why they chose Dr. Caruso to testify at sentencing.\nHowever, on cross-examination, after reviewing Dr. Caruso’s written report, Converse\ntestified that it was “certainly . . . very possible” that the defense put Dr. Caruso on the stand\nin order to get before the jury the following conclusions contained within his written report:\n\n       [A]t the time of the alleged offenses, the defendant was in a state of extreme\n       emotional disturbance brought on by his sensitivity to abandonment and his\n       fears that the two most significant persons in his life were on the verge of\n       rejecting him.\n\n              Should the jury determine that the defendant is guilty, it appears that his\n       crimes were committed in response to this extreme emotional disturbance. In\n       this scenario, it is likely that the defendant acted in a manner that had\n       previously been enacted on him: he victimized a child sexually and violently.\n\nConverse also testified on cross-examination that Dr. William Bernet had “brought up\npedophilia” as a possible motivating factor for the Petitioner’s crimes, a conclusion ruled out\nby Dr. Caruso’s statement in his report that “gratifying pedophilic desires with a child” failed\nto explain the Petitioner’s behavior at the time of the crime. Converse also recalled on cross-\nexamination that he remembered consulting with a neurologist to assist with the defense, but\nthat he could not recall whether they actually retained the services of such an expert for\npurposes of the trial.\n\n                                               -35-\n\f       Converse also recalled that the defense utilized Dr. Cecile Guin, a social worker\nemployed by Louisiana State University (LSU), who had researched the conditions of\nLouisiana’s juvenile justice facilities at the time the Petitioner was housed in such a facility.\nConverse remembered that there had been “some limitation” on Dr. Guin’s testimony in that\n“there was an objection on the State’s part that there was no proof [the Petitioner] had\nactually been exposed to some of the specific acts that Dr. [Guin] was attempting to testify\nto.” Converse testified that Dr. Guin was his responsibility primarily as a witness and that\nhe had made the decision to use her as a witness. However, he could not recall whether he\nquestioned her at trial.\n\n       Converse testified that he was co-counsel on the Petitioner’s direct appeal with Brock\nMehler, who handled most of the work on the case at that point. Converse testified that he\nprepared the initial motion for new trial, but Mehler primarily drafted the amended motion\nfor new trial. Converse described his involvement in the Petitioner’s direct appeal as\nfollows:\n\n       My involvement in the appeal was very – I mean, I was listed as co-counsel,\n       but that was Mr. [Mehler’s] specialty and I answered questions for him and\n       you know, helped fill in some of the blanks, things of that nature, but\n       primarily, he wrote the appeal and prepared for the appeal.\n\n        Dr. Pamela Auble, admitted as an expert in neuropsychology and clinical and general\npsychology, testified that, at post-conviction counsel’s request, she evaluated statements the\nPetitioner gave to law enforcement in order to determine whether his statement had been\ncoerced. She prepared a report, dated March 29, 2010, which was admitted into evidence.\nShe explained that, in conjunction with performing her evaluation, she reviewed “all the\nrecords that were relevant to the statement that were available,” interviewed the Petitioner,\nand administered some standardized testing to the Petitioner. She also reviewed some\nprevious testing and evaluations that had been performed by others. Her eventual\ndetermination was that his statement to the police “was coerced and unreliable.” As stated\nin her report,\n\n              From the test results that were obtained on this evaluation and on the\n       1998 evaluation, [the Petitioner] wants other people to see him as a good\n       person, tending to minimize his own personality flaws. He also tends to be\n       compliant with the demands of people in authority . . . . In addition, [the\n       Petitioner] suffers from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder from his horrific\n       childhood. In his childhood, he was trained to admit to wrongdoing by his\n       stepfather even though he had not committed the offenses because the\n       punishments would be even more severe if he did not “confess” to the\n\n                                              -36-\n\f       wrongdoing. A recent study . . . reported that people who have been exposed\n       to past traumatic experiences such as abuse or victimization are more likely to\n       give false statements during interrogation.\n\nAdditional factors that led to her conclusion included the “Reid technique” of interrogation\nthat was used on the Petitioner; his being told repeatedly by the polygraph administrator that\nhe was lying; the ten-hour period during which the interrogation was conducted; that the\nPetitioner “did not receive food and he apparently did not go to the bathroom” during the ten-\nhour period; and the Petitioner’s claim that law enforcement suggested to him “that he would\nbe charged with vehicular homicide instead of first-degree murder if he just said that he ran\nover this child and did not mean to.” As to the Reid interrogation technique, her report set\nforth the following:\n\n              The purpose of police interrogation is to elicit statements from\n       defendants that describe their role in the alleged offense. The Reid technique\n       is the most commonly employed strategy to accomplish this goal . . . . The\n       Reid technique can be reduced to three processes: 1. Isolation in an\n       interrogation room; 2. Confrontation or maximization in which the suspect is\n       accused of the crime, presented with evidence, and blocked from denial; 3.\n       Minimization in which the crime is morally justified and sympathy is feigned.\n\nDr. Auble testified that the Reid technique risks unreliable and untrustworthy statements.\nShe added that she had been available to conduct this evaluation during the time preceding\nthe Petitioner’s trial, but that she had not been contacted by the Petitioner’s lawyers.\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Auble acknowledged that she was aware that the defense\nhad contacted an expert prior to trial about the Petitioner’s statements and that the expert had\nconcluded that the Petitioner’s statements were not a “false confession.” She asserted,\nhowever, that “a false confession and a coerced confession are actually two different things”\nand that a coerced confession could be true but “makes you believe it is less trustworthy.”\nShe also testified on cross-examination that, in her opinion, the Petitioner “basically\nunderstood the Miranda warnings.” He, however, has “trouble with compliance with\nauthority . . . where he doesn’t really understand his right to remain silent.”\n\n       Meghan Clement testified that she worked for Lab Corp. as the technical director in\nthe forensic identity testing department. She was tendered and accepted without objection\nas an expert in serology and DNA forensics. Clement testified that she was originally\ncontacted by the State in this case in early 1998. She was provided with samples for testing,\nincluding stains from a pair of pants. She was provided with four pieces of fabric, designated\non the submittal form as “three semen stains and a possible semen stain.” DNA tests were\n\n                                              -37-\n\frequested on the samples. Only one of the samples produced a small amount of DNA, which\nwas not sufficient to compare to any known reference sample.\n\n       In December 1999, she received a request for mitochondrial DNA testing, a different\ntype of test. She stated, “we often had very good luck in getting mitochondrial DNA\nsequences where we couldn’t get nuclear DNA profiles.” However, the new testing did not\nproduce “any sequence information that could be compared to any known reference sample.”\n\n        In 2008, she received a request to do additional testing on the Petitioner’s behalf. This\ntest was the Y chromosome test, and it was performed on the extract that had originally been\nobtained from the fabric samples. The remaining extract had been frozen and was available\nfor further testing. The new testing resulted in a “zero quantitation.” The cloth samples were\nsubsequently returned to Lab Corp. They again tried to extract DNA and develop a Y\nchromosome profile but were unsuccessful.\n\n       In addition to trying to extract DNA from the cloth samples in 2009, Clement also\nperformed a “presumptive test for acid phosphatase as well as a test for the presence of P30,\nwhich is an antigen found in seminal fluid and those revealed negative results.” The\nlaboratory also examined the cloth samples microscopically, but did not find spermatazoa\npresent.\n\n        Clement also examined microscopically three slides that had been prepared by Mark\nSquibb in conjunction with trial preparation. Clement “determined that there were very few\nvisible sperm heads that were identified on the slides.”\n\n        When asked whether the presence of sperm necessarily implied the presence of semen,\nClement explained that tests had been performed demonstrating that sperm heads could be\ntransferred among items of clothing during a washing machine cycle. Accordingly, a finding\nof spermatazoa did not necessarily imply the presence of semen. Clement also explained that\na positive acid phosphatase test did not necessarily indicate the presence of semen. Rather,\na weak positive test could be caused by other factors.\n\n       The State called Collier Goodlett, who testified that he had been practicing law for\napproximately thirty years at the time of the hearing. He practiced with the Public\nDefender’s office in the nineteenth judicial district and also worked there at the time of the\nvictim’s disappearance. He began representing the Petitioner “either at the Sessions level or\nperhaps . . . shortly thereafter.” He accompanied the Petitioner to the scene where the\nPetitioner had claimed to have run over the victim and to the bridge from which the\nPetitioner initially claimed to have thrown the victim’s body. Also present were Agent\n\n\n\n                                              -38-\n\fMurray, Investigator Batson, the District Attorney, “and other officers.” Goodlett testified\nabout the visit:\n\n       I don’t recall any conversations that occurred out on the bridge. We ultimately\n       did go down to the area where [the victim] lived. As you drive up to it, there\n       was a trailer I think off to the left, that was where she lived. There was a sort\n       of muddy pond and then there was an area back off to the left as you approach,\n       where supposedly he had stopped or had been parked, I don’t recall? It is not\n       inconsistent with my practice that once a defendant begins to start talking in\n       my view far too much, that I will subtly tell them they need to be quiet. But\n       that’s basically all I recall. I don’t recall talking to any particular person out\n       there, other than being with the officers, sort of following them around.\n\nGoodlett explained that they visited the two scenes because the Petitioner “had wanted to go\nout there and basically demonstrate the events.” The Petitioner’s explanation to the State’s\nagents was consistent with what the Petitioner had told Goodlett. Goodlett added that, at this\npoint in his career, he would not have permitted his client to engage in that manner with the\nState.\n\n       On cross-examination, Goodlett acknowledged that the trip to the bridge occurred on\nthe same day that the Petitioner appeared in general sessions court. He stated that he would\nnot recommend that his client speak to police officers and that, in general, he wanted to\nreview discovery and ascertain the basis for the State’s case before making a\nrecommendation to his client about further proceedings. He also reiterated that, in retrospect,\n“I would not have ever let [the Petitioner] get in that car and go with them.” On redirect, he\nacknowledged that, regarding the scene visits, he did what the Petitioner wanted done.\n\n       The State also called Ronald R. Lax, who testified that he is a private investigator\nworking for the company Inquisitor. He was employed by attorney Warner to work on the\nPetitioner’s case prior to trial. In October 1999, he consulted with Dr. Richard Ofshe in\nCalifornia, a sociologist with expertise “in false confessions and in recovered memory.” The\nconsultation regarded the Petitioner’s statement. Following the consultation, the defense\nteam decided not to call Dr. Ofshe as a witness because his testimony would not have been\nhelpful.\n\n       Lax worked with five other Inquisitor employees in the investigation for the\nPetitioner. The bill for the company’s services was “about thirty-three thousand” dollars.\n\n       The State next called Billy Batson, an investigator with the Montgomery County\nSheriff’s Department, who testified that he was the lead investigator in the Petitioner’s case.\n\n                                             -39-\n\fHe denied that the Petitioner’s statements had been coerced and explained that the Petitioner\nhad requested the polygraph. No one in law enforcement suggested to the Petitioner that he\nmight have committed “just a vehicular homicide,” and no one suggested to the Petitioner\nthat he might have run over the victim accidentally. Rather, the Petitioner asked law\nenforcement if he was going to be charged with vehicular homicide after the polygraph.\n\n        On cross-examination, Investigator Batson explained that, when the Petitioner asked\nif he was going to be charged with vehicular homicide, the charges of first degree murder had\nalready been decided upon. In response to the Petitioner’s question, however, he was told\nthat the charges would be explained to him at a later time.\n\n        The State’s last witness was Mark Squibb, the laboratory supervisor for the trace and\nDNA sections of the Miami Valley Regional Crime Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, and the\nDNA Technical Leader for the DNA section. Squibb testified that he was formerly a forensic\nDNA analyst at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (“TBI”) laboratory in Nashville,\nTennessee. While employed by the TBI, he performed the original laboratory work on the\nshorts found with the victim’s remains. He performed an “AP spray” test to the crotch of the\nshorts and obtained a “weak positive” result. He explained that the result was a “weak”\npositive because of the longer period of time it took for the testing substance to reach the\ncolor purple. He took four cuttings from the area testing “weak positive.” He examined\nextractions from the cuttings microscopically and found “rare sperm heads” on three of the\nsamples. Based on the weak positive AP (acid phosphatase) test and the sperm heads in the\ncrotch area of the shorts, he concluded that there was semen on the shorts.\n\n       Squibb acknowledged that there was also a lot of dirt, discoloration, and debris in the\nextractions. He also acknowledged that the AP spray test may result in a false positive and\nthat vaginal fluid can also produce a positive result. He further acknowledged being aware\nof studies “which pertain to the persistence of sperm as well as semen in washing.”\nNevertheless, he testified that he stood by his trial testimony.\n\n        On cross-examination, Squibb acknowledged that “rare” sperm heads meant that “very\nfew,” or less than ten, heads were found in the area being microscopically examined. He also\nacknowledged that he ran a P30 test on the shorts, which tests for an antigen produced by the\nmale prostate gland and which is present in semen. The P30 test result was negative for the\nantigen, meaning “either it wasn’t there or it did not reach the level in which [the] test could\ndetect it.”\n\n      After the parties submitted annotated versions of the second amended petition and\nanswer as well as post-hearing briefs, the post-conviction court entered a 194-page order on\n\n\n\n                                              -40-\n\fAugust 26, 2010, denying the Petitioner’s initial and amended petitions for post-conviction\nrelief.\n\n                                     Standard of Review\n\n       Relief under the Post-Conviction Procedure Act of 1995, Tenn. Code Ann. §§ 40-30-\n101 through -122 (2006), is only warranted when a petitioner establishes that his or her\n“conviction or sentence is void or voidable because of the abridgment of any right guaranteed\nby the Constitution of Tennessee or the Constitution of the United States.” Id. § 40-30-103.\nTo prevail on a post-conviction claim of a constitutional violation, the petitioner must prove\nhis or her allegations of fact by “clear and convincing evidence.” Id. § 40-30-110(f).\n“Evidence is clear and convincing when there is no serious or substantial doubt about the\ncorrectness of the conclusions drawn from the evidence.” Hicks v. State, 983 S.W.2d 240,\n245 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1998).\n\n       Once the post-conviction court has ruled upon a petition, its findings of fact are\nconclusive on appeal unless the evidence in the record preponderates against them. Pylant\nv. State, 263 S.W.3d 854, 867 (Tenn. 2008); Sexton v. State, 151 S.W.3d 525, 531 (Tenn.\nCrim. App. 2004). We will defer to the post-conviction court’s findings with respect to the\nwitnesses’ credibility, the weight and value of their testimony, and the resolution of factual\nissues presented by the evidence. Momon v. State, 18 S.W.3d 152, 156 (Tenn. 1999). With\nrespect to issues raising mixed questions of law and fact, however, including claims of\nineffective assistance of counsel, our review is de novo with no presumption of correctness.\nSee Pylant, 263 S.W.3d at 867-68; Sexton, 151 S.W.3d at 531.\n\n                                            Analysis\n\n                            I. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n         The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I, section 9 of the\nTennessee Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant the right to representation by counsel\nat trial. See U.S. Const. amend. VI; Tenn. Const. Art. I, § 9; see also State v. Burns, 6\nS.W.3d 453, 461 (Tenn. 1999); Baxter v. Rose, 523 S.W.2d 930, 936 (Tenn. 1975). Indeed,\nthe Sixth Amendment right to counsel is so fundamental and essential to a fair trial that the\nFourteenth Amendment renders it obligatory upon the States. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372\nU.S. 335, 342-45 (1963).\n\n       Both the United States Supreme Court and the Tennessee Supreme Court have\nrecognized that this right is to “reasonably effective” assistance, which is assistance that falls\n“within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.” Strickland v.\n\n                                              -41-\n\fWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); see also Baxter, 523 S.W.2d at 936. The deprivation\nof effective assistance of counsel at trial presents a claim cognizable under Tennessee’s Post-\nConviction Procedure Act. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-103; Pylant, 263 S.W.3d at 868.\n“The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel’s conduct\nso undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied\non as having produced a just result.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686. See also, e.g., Felts v.\nState, 354 S.W.3d 266, 276 (Tenn. 2011).\n\n       A petitioner’s claim that his or her attorneys provided constitutionally deficient\nassistance is governed by the following two-prong test:\n\n       First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This\n       requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not\n       functioning as the “counsel” guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth\n       Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance\n       prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so\n       serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.\n\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 687; see also Carpenter v. State, 126 S.W.3d 879, 886 (Tenn. 2004)\n(“To determine whether appellate counsel was constitutionally effective, we use the two-\nprong test set forth in [Strickland] — the same test that is applied to claims of ineffective\nassistance of trial counsel asserted under the Sixth Amendment to the United Constitution.”).\nStated simply, a petitioner must prove both that counsel’s performance was constitutionally\ndeficient, and that the deficiency actually prejudiced the defense. See Burns, 6 S.W.3d at\n461; Goad v. State, 938 S.W.2d 363, 369 (Tenn. 1996). A petitioner’s “failure to prove\neither deficiency or prejudice provides a sufficient basis to deny relief.” Goad, 938 S.W.2d\nat 370. Indeed, “[i]f it is easier to dispose of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of lack\nof sufficient prejudice, . . . that course should be followed.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697.\n\n        To establish the first prong of deficient performance, the petitioner must demonstrate\nthat counsel “‘made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the “counsel”\nguaranteed by the Sixth Amendment.’” Felts, 354 S.W.3d at 276 (quoting Strickland, 466\nU.S. at 687). That is, the petitioner must demonstrate that his lawyer’s “acts or omissions\nwere so serious as to fall below an objective standard of ‘reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.’” Vaughn v. State, 202 S.W.3d 106, 116 (Tenn. 2006) (quoting\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 688). See also Kimmelman v. Morrison, 477 U.S. 365, 386 (1986);\nKing v. State, 989 S.W.2d 319, 330 (Tenn. 1999); Baxter, 523 S.W.2d at 936. In order to\nsatisfy this prong of the test, the petitioner “must identify the acts or omissions of counsel\nthat are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.” Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 690. Upon reviewing the identified acts or omissions, the reviewing court must\n\n                                               -42-\n\fthen “make every effort to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the\ncircumstances of counsel’s conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from the perspective of\ncounsel at that time.” Howell v. State, 185 S.W.3d 319, 326 (Tenn. 2006) (citing Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 689). Additionally, a reviewing court “must be highly deferential and ‘must\nindulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable\nprofessional assistance.’” State v. Honeycutt, 54 S.W.3d 762, 767 (Tenn. 2001) (quoting\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 689). “[T]hat is, the [petitioner] must overcome the presumption\nthat, under the circumstances, the challenged action ‘might be considered sound trial\nstrategy.’” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689 (emphasis added); see also Felts, 354 S.W.3d at 277.\n\n        We will not deem counsel to have been ineffective merely because a different strategy\nor procedure might have produced a more favorable result. Rhoden v. State, 816 S.W.2d 56,\n60 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). We recognize, however, that “deference to tactical choices only\napplies if the choices are informed ones based upon adequate preparation.” Cooper v. State,\n847 S.W.2d 521, 528 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1992) (citing Hellard v. State, 629 S.W.2d 4, 9\n(Tenn. 1982)). Finally, we note that criminal defendants are “not entitled to perfect\nrepresentation, only constitutionally adequate representation.” Denton v. State, 945 S.W.2d\n793, 796 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996). Therefore, “in considering claims of ineffective\nassistance of counsel, ‘[w]e address not what is prudent or appropriate, but only what is\nconstitutionally compelled.’” Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S. 776, 794 (1987) (quoting United\nStates v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 665 n.38 (1984)). Notwithstanding, we recognize that “[o]ur\nduty to search for constitutional [deficiencies] with painstaking care is never more exacting\nthan it is in a capital case.” Id. at 785.\n\n         The prejudice prong of the Strickland test requires the petitioner to establish that\n“there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of\nthe proceeding would have been different.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694; see also King, 989\nS.W.2d at 330. “A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\nin the outcome.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694. In evaluating whether a petitioner has satisfied\nthis prong of the test, a court must ask “whether counsel’s deficient performance renders the\nresult of the trial unreliable or the proceeding fundamentally unfair.” Lockhart v. Fretwell,\n506 U.S. 364, 372 (1993) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687). In other words, a petitioner\nmust establish that the deficiency of counsel was of such a degree that it deprived him of a\nfair trial and called into question the reliability of the outcome. Pylant, 263 S.W.3d at 869.\n“A reasonable probability of being found guilty of a lesser charge . . . satisfies the second\nprong of Strickland.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                             -43-\n\f                                       A. Jury Selection\n\n        In his first issue on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nin denying his claims that his trial lawyers (individually and collectively, “Trial Counsel”)\nprovided constitutionally ineffective assistance during the jury selection process. The\nPetitioner alleges numerous deficiencies on Trial Counsel’s part during the jury selection\nprocess, which he summarizes in his brief to this Court as (1) failing to conduct an adequate\nvoir dire; (2) failing to object to the trial court’s voir dire process and juror excusals; (3)\nfailing to meaningfully exercise peremptory challenges; (4) failing to utilize both defense\nlawyers during voir dire; and (5) failing “to object, preserve, raise, and appeal the voir dire\nissues stated herein.” The post-conviction court determined that the Petitioner failed to carry\nhis burden of proving that he suffered prejudice as a result of Trial Counsel’s performance\nduring jury selection. We agree with the post-conviction court’s conclusion and hold that the\nPetitioner is entitled to no relief on the basis of Trial Counsel’s performance during jury\nselection.\n\n        Jury selection implicates an accused’s state and federal constitutional rights to a\ncompetent, fair-minded, and unbiased jury. See Smith v. State, 357 S.W.3d 322, 347 (Tenn.\n2011) (recognizing that “[b]oth the United States and the Tennessee Constitutions guarantee\na criminal defendant the right to a trial by an impartial jury.”); see also Irvin v. Dowd, 366\nU.S. 717, 722 (1961) (“[T]he right to jury trial guarantees to the criminally accused a fair\ntrial by a panel of impartial, ‘indifferent’ jurors.”); Mahdi v. Bagley, 522 F.3d 631, 636 (6th\nCir. 2008) (“The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments guarantee a criminal defendant an\nimpartial jury in state court.”); State v. Akins, 867 S.W.2d 350, 354 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993)\n(recognizing that, under the Tennessee Constitution, every accused is guaranteed “‘a trial by\na jury free of . . . disqualification on account of some bias or partiality toward one side or the\nother of the litigation’”) (quoting Toombs v. State, 270 S.W.2d 649, 650 (Tenn. 1954)). The\nprocess of voir dire is aimed at enabling a defense lawyer (as well as a prosecutor) to purge\nthe jury of members not meeting these criteria. See United States v. Nell, 526 F.2d 1223,\n1229 (5th Cir. 1976) (“[T]he principal way this right [to an impartial jury] is implemented\nis through the system of challenges exercised during the voir dire of prospective jurors.”);\nSmith, 357 S.W.3d at 347 (recognizing that “‘[t]he ultimate goal of voir dire is to ensure that\njurors are competent, unbiased and impartial.’”) (quoting State v. Hugueley, 185 S.W.3d 356,\n390 (appx) (Tenn. 2006); see also Tenn. Code Ann. § 22-3-101 (1994) (“Parties in civil and\ncriminal cases or their attorneys shall have an absolute right to examine prospective jurors\nin such cases, notwithstanding any rule of procedure or practice of court to the contrary.”);\nTenn. R. Crim. P. 24(b)(1) (“The court may ask potential jurors appropriate questions\nregarding their qualifications to serve as jurors in the case. It shall permit the parties to ask\nquestions for the purpose of discovering bases for challenge for cause and intelligently\nexercising peremptory challenges.”). As emphasized by the United States Supreme Court,\n\n                                              -44-\n\f       The process of voir dire is designed to cull from the venire persons who\n       demonstrate that they cannot be fair to either side of the case. Clearly, the\n       extremes must be eliminated – i.e., those who, in spite of the evidence, would\n       automatically vote to convict or impose the death penalty or automatically vote\n       to acquit or impose a life sentence.\n\nMorgan v. Illinois, 504 U.S. 719, 734 n.7 (1992) (quoting Smith v. Balkcom, 660 F.2d 573,\n578 (5th Cir. 1981)).\n\n        As the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has asserted, “[a]mong the\nmost essential responsibilities of defense counsel is to protect his client’s constitutional right\nto a fair and impartial jury by using voir dire to identify and ferret out jurors who are biased\nagainst the defense.” Miller v. Francis, 269 F.3d 609, 615 (6th Cir. 2001). By posing\nappropriate questions to prospective jurors, a defense lawyer is able to exercise challenges\nin a manner that ensures the jury passes constitutional muster. See United States v. Blount,\n479 F.2d 650, 651 (6th Cir. 1973).\n\n        Despite its significance, a trial lawyer is “accorded particular deference when\nconducting voir dire” and his or her “actions during voir dire are considered to be matters\nof trial strategy.” Hughes v. United States, 258 F.3d 453, 457 (6th Cir. 2001). Also, “[a]\nstrategic decision cannot be the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance unless counsel’s\ndecision is shown to be so ill-chosen that it permeates the entire trial with obvious\nunfairness.” Id. Thus, it is imperative for a petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of\ncounsel during jury selection to demonstrate that the resulting jury was not impartial. See\nSmith, 357 S.W.3d at 348 (citing James A. Dellinger v. State, No. E2005-01485-CCA-R3-\nPD, 2007 WL 2428049, at *30 (Tenn. Crim. App. Aug. 28, 2007)). We conclude that the\nPetitioner has failed to make such a demonstration in this case.\n\n       In Smith, the Tennessee Supreme Court recently dealt with a post-conviction claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel during voir dire in another capital case. Smith, 357\nS.W.3d at 346-49. The petitioner claimed that he was due a new trial because his lawyer did\nnot ask the jurors during voir dire about their past experiences as a victim of crime or with\na victim of crime. Id. at 346. One of the jurors who sat on the petitioner’s trial testified at\nthe post-conviction hearing that, shortly before the trial, his daughter’s boyfriend had been\nmurdered. Id. The juror also testified that “the impact of [the victim’s] death on his own\nfamily had been great.” Id. at 347.\n\n       First noting that the “‘proper fields of inquiry [during voir dire] include the juror’s\noccupation, habits, acquaintanceships, associations and other factors, including his [or her]\nexperiences, which will indicate his [or her] freedom from bias,’” id. (quoting State v.\n\n                                              -45-\n\fOnidas, 635 S.W.2d 516, 517 (Tenn. 1982)), the Smith court then emphasized that “potential\nbias arises if a juror has been involved in a crime or incident similar to the one at trial.” Id.\n(citing Ricketts v. Carter, 918 S.W.2d 419, 422 (Tenn. 1996); Durham v. State, 188 S.W.2d\n555, 558 (Tenn. 1945)). Accordingly, the court held, “questions to cull the jury for persons\nwho might be biased due to their past experiences with the criminal justice system are a\ncritical part of a competent voir dire in criminal cases,” and “the failure to ask the\nprospective jurors about their past experiences as victims or associates of victims is\nobjectively unreasonable.” Id. at 347-48 (citing Hughes, 258 F.3d at 460). Clearly, then, it\nis possible for defense counsel to be deemed deficient in their performance during voir dire\nbased on a failure to ask critical questions aimed at revealing bias against the defense,\n“absent a showing that counsel had a strategic reason for not asking the question.” Id. at 347.\nWe also note as significant, however, that the record in Smith reflected that, not only did the\npetitioner’s lawyer fail to ask these critical questions, but neither did the trial court or the\nprosecution. Id. at 346.\n\n        However, even if a petitioner is successful at demonstrating deficient performance\nduring voir dire, as was the petitioner in Smith, relief will not be granted unless the petitioner\nalso demonstrates “that the deficiency resulted in having a juror seated who was actually\nbiased.” Smith, 357 S.W.3d at 348 (citing James A. Dellinger, 2007 WL 2428049, at *30);\nsee also Goeders v. Hundley, 59 F.3d 73, 75 (8th Cir. 1995). Recently, considering a claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel during jury selection, the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit clarified that\n\n               [b]ias may be actual or implied. Actual bias is bias in fact – the\n       existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not\n       act with impartiality. The doctrine of presumed or implied, as opposed to\n       actual, bias provides that, in certain “extreme” or “exceptional” cases, courts\n       should employ a conclusive presumption that a juror is biased. We may\n       presume bias only where the relationship between a prospective juror and\n       some aspect of the litigation is such that it is highly unlikely that the average\n       person could remain impartial in his deliberations under the circumstances.\n       Examples of such a relationship are that the juror is an actual employee of the\n       prosecuting agency, that the juror is a close relative of one of the participants\n       in the trial or the criminal transaction, or that the juror was a witness or\n       somehow involved in the criminal transaction.\n\nTreesh v. Bagley, 612 F.3d 424, 437 (6th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                              -46-\n\f         The Smith court denied the petitioner’s claim for relief on the basis of trial counsel’s\ndeficient performance during jury selection because the petitioner had “introduced no\nevidence of actual bias or partiality.” Smith, 357 S.W.3d at 348. Indeed, the subject juror\nin the Smith case testified at the post-conviction hearing that he “recalled telling the trial\njudge in response to questioning that there was no reason he could not give [the petitioner]\na fair trial.” Id. The Tennessee Supreme Court categorically rejected the petitioner’s claim\nthat bias should be presumed under the circumstances, holding that it had “never presumed\nbias absent either an affirmative statement of bias, willful concealment of bias, or failure to\ndisclose information that would call into question the juror’s bias, and we decline to do so\nnow.” Id. Because the petitioner failed to adduce proof that his jury contained a biased\njuror, the court held that he was “not prejudiced by counsel’s failure to ask the . . .\nprospective jurors whether they or anyone close to them had ever been the victim of a crime,”\nand denied relief on this basis. Id. at 348-49.\n\n        In this case, the Petitioner adduced no testimony at the post-conviction hearing\nestablishing juror bias. The Petitioner attempts to rely on responses to the jury questionnaire,\nparticularly the response by some of his jurors that the death penalty “should be automatic\nfor anyone who is convicted of murdering a child.” The questionnaires were simply\npreliminary tools to foster appropriate voir dire, however, and were not designed as\nmechanisms to eliminate potential jurors solely on the basis of answers given without the\nbenefit of legal instruction from a trial judge. See State v. Sexton, 368 S.W.3d 371, 392-95\n(Tenn. 2012). In Sexton, our supreme court recognized that excluding jurors on the basis of\na response to a single question in a jury questionnaire was “not permissible.” Id. at 392-93.\nInstead, “[p]rior to disqualification of a prospective juror, the trial court should develop a\nprocess designed to definitively ascertain whether the juror is predisposed to a certain result\n[in a capital sentencing trial] regardless of the law.” Id. at 393. And, in conjunction with\nimplementing such a process,\n\n       [o]nly a definitive answer that the prospective juror would either always vote\n       for the death penalty or never vote for the death penalty regardless of the\n       instructions of the trial court is the kind of predisposition which might\n       “prevent or substantially impair the performance of [their] duties” as jurors and\n       result in disqualification.\n\nId. (quoting Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424 (1985)). In sum, our supreme court has\ncautioned that,\n\n       eliminating prospective jurors based solely on an answer to one written\n       question may result in the exclusion of those who are entirely capable of\n       rendering a proper verdict, and, if a defendant is found guilty in a capital case,\n\n                                              -47-\n\f       imposing a sentence based on the law and the facts. Thus, trial courts must\n       consider all of a juror’s answers on a questionnaire, rather than giving just one\n       answer dispositive weight, and should permit counsel to examine prospective\n       jurors who provide inconsistent responses to pertinent questions.\n\nId. at 395.\n\n       Thus, absent other proof adduced at the post-conviction hearing, a petitioner claiming\na biased jury must rely upon the transcript of the voir dire. See Holder v. Palmer, 588 F.3d\n328, 339 (6th Cir. 2009) (where defendant is alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in jury\nselection, defendant “must show through a review of voir dire testimony that a ‘fair trial was\nimpossible’”) (quoting Ritchie v. Rogers, 313 F.3d 948, 952 (6th Cir. 2002)). Our close\nreview of the voir dire in this case belies the Petitioner’s claim of a constitutionally infirm\njury.\n\n        First, although the Petitioner claims in his brief to this Court that Trial Counsel was\nineffective by failing “to adequately voir dire prospective jurors regarding their respective\nbeliefs on capital punishment and the impact of pretrial publicity,” the trial record reveals\nthat the trial court questioned each of the jurors individually about pretrial publicity and their\ncommitment to consider each of the three potential sentences should the Petitioner be found\nguilty of first degree murder. The prosecutor asked further questions of each juror\nindividually about their commitment to consider each of the three potential punishments upon\nconviction. Moreover, Trial Counsel also asked questions in these areas. Unlike defense\ncounsel in Smith, then, Trial Counsel in this case had adequate information upon which to\ndetermine whether further questioning was necessary on these points and whether to exercise\nchallenges on these bases.\n\n        Moreover, our review of the voir dire of each of the twelve jurors who decided the\nPetitioner’s case reflects that each juror met the constitutional standard of fairness and\nimpartiality, i.e., each could lay aside any prior opinion about the case he or she may have\nheld and render a verdict based on the evidence adduced in court. See Patton v. Yount, 467\nU.S. 1025, 1037 n.12 (1984) (citing Irwin, 366 U.S. at 723); see also Wainwright, 469 U.S.\nat 424 (recognizing that the “proper standard for determining when a prospective juror may\nbe excluded for cause because of his or her views on capital punishment . . . is whether the\njuror’s views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror\nin accordance with his instructions and his oath”) (internal quotation marks omitted). “A\nqualified juror need not be ‘totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved.’” Miller v.\nWebb, 385 F.3d 666, 673 (6th Cir. 2004) (quoting Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 800\n(1975). “Rather, ‘[i]t is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and\nrender a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.’” Id. (quoting Irwin, 366 U.S. at\n\n                                              -48-\n\f723). While the Petitioner asserts that jurors Richardson, Brown, Shuffield, Spangenberger,\nBaggett, and Milliken had each “provided written or oral statements showing obvious bias\nregarding imposition of the death penalty and the impact of cases with child victims,” the\nrecord of the actual voir dire demonstrates that each of these jurors was ably rehabilitated\nthrough explanations of the relevant law applicable to the imposition of the death penalty in\nTennessee.\n\n       Richardson, who indicated on her jury questionnaire that she thought the death penalty\nshould be automatic for anyone convicted of murdering a child, told the trial court that she\nhad formed no opinion about guilt or punishment and that she could keep an open mind and\nbe fair to both the Petitioner and the State. She also stated that she would be open to\nconsidering all three of the possible punishments should the Petitioner be convicted. When\nthe prosecutor asked if she could set aside her earlier opinion that the death penalty should\nbe automatic for the murder of children on being told by the trial judge that that was not the\nlaw in Tennessee, she answered affirmatively. She reiterated that she could consider all three\npossible punishments.\n\n       Brown, who also indicated on the questionnaire her belief that the death penalty\nshould be automatic for the murder of children, likewise told the trial court that she had not\nformed an opinion about the case and would follow the law regarding the three possible\npenalties upon conviction of first degree murder. When the prosecutor explained that\nTennessee law did not provide for the death penalty solely on the basis that a child was\nmurdered, Brown stated that she would follow the law and consider all possible punishments.\n\n       Shuffield, who also indicated on the questionnaire his belief that the death penalty\nshould be automatic for the murder of children, told the prosecutor that he could set this\nopinion aside and follow the law requiring that all three possible punishments be considered.\nHe indicated to defense counsel that he would not automatically vote for the death penalty\njust because the victim was a child.\n\n       Spangenberger, who also indicated on the questionnaire his belief that the death\npenalty should be automatic for the murder of children, stated that he would follow the law\nrequiring that all three punishments be considered. He stated that he had not formed any\nopinion about the case and noted that there were circumstances in which each of the three\npunishments would be appropriate.\n\n      Baggett, who also indicated on the questionnaire his belief that the death penalty\nshould be automatic for the murder of children, stated during questioning that he would\napproach the case with an open mind and decide it solely on the evidence and the law. He\n\n\n\n                                             -49-\n\fasserted that he would consider all three possible punishments and that he would set aside\nany personal feelings and follow the law.\n\n       Milliken stated during voir dire that she thought a case in which a life had been taken\nshould carry the death penalty. After being told by the prosecutor that Tennessee law did not\nprovide for the automatic imposition of the death penalty upon a first degree murder\nconviction, Milliken stated that she understood and that she could follow the law. She\naffirmed that she could be fair and impartial.\n\n        Trial Counsel challenged none of these jurors for cause. Moreover, the trial court did\nnot excuse any of these jurors for cause on its own motion. See David Robert Ruderman v.\nRyan, No. CV-09-0887-PHX-GMS, 2010 WL 2757282, at *5 (D. Ariz. July 13, 2010)\n(recognizing that, “[i]n cases where neither counsel requests that the juror be dismissed for\ncause, a trial court has a duty to dismiss the juror sua sponte where ‘the evidence of partiality\nbefore the [trial] court’ is highly ‘indicative of impermissible juror bias.’”) (quoting United\nStates v. Mitchell, 568 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir. 2009)). Obviously, neither Trial Counsel\nnor the trial court was concerned that any of these jurors was biased against the defense, and\nthe record before us does not demonstrate that any of these jurors was biased, either in fact\nor impliedly. Moreover, a trial court’s assessment of a “juror’s ability to adhere to [his or]\nher oath . . ., based upon not only the answers to questions posed by counsel but also\nnonverbal responses, is owed deference.” State v. Odom, 336 S.W.3d 541, 559 (Tenn. 2011)\n(citing Uttecht v. Brown, 551 U.S. 1, 9 (2007)). Also, where “the record shows that jurors\nwere duly elected, empaneled, tried, and sworn, it is presumed that they were fair and\nimpartial jurors, since the trial judge has the exclusive right to pass on their selection.”\nLetner v. State, 512 S.W.2d 643, 649 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1974). “To overthrow this\npresumption of competency, a clear case must be made out against it.” Id. We also note that\nthe Tennessee Supreme Court has already determined that the Petitioner’s jury was not\nprejudiced by pretrial publicity. See Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 622 (appx). The Petitioner has\nfailed to demonstrate that he is entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n       The Petitioner also argues that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to ask any of\nthe jurors about “any mitigation concepts.” While we acknowledge that Trial Counsel did\nnot pursue this line of inquiry during voir dire, this Court has recognized that “[t]he failure\nto make certain inquiries to determine how receptive the jury would be to specific mitigation\nfactors during voir dire does not necessarily constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.”\nSteven Ray Thacker v. State, No. W2010-01637-CCA-R3-PD, 2012 WL 1020227, at *53\n(Tenn. Crim. App. Mar. 23, 2012) (citing State v. Goodwin, 703 N.E.2d 1251, 1257 (Ohio\n1999)). In Thacker, rejecting a similar argument, this Court noted that the jurors had been\n“questioned as to their ability to follow the law” and that “[t]he trial court instructed the jury\nof the applicable legal burdens and on mitigating circumstances.” Id. This Court\n\n                                              -50-\n\femphasized that, “‘where a juror is not legally disqualified or there is no inherent prejudice,\nthe burden is on the [petitioner] to show that a juror is in some way biased or prejudiced.’”\nId. (quoting State v. Caughron, 855 S.W.2d 526, 539 (Tenn. 1993)). Because the petitioner\nhad “offered no evidence to establish that the jury ultimately empaneled was biased or\nunfair,” this Court denied relief. Id.; see also Christa Gail Pike v. State, No. E2009-00016-\nCCA-R3-PD, 2011 WL 1544207, at *59 (Tenn. Crim. App. Apr. 25, 2011), perm. app.\ndenied (Tenn. Nov. 15, 2011) (affirming trial court’s denial of post-conviction relief where\npetitioner claimed trial counsel was ineffective in failing to inform the jury during voir dire\nthat the petitioner’s youth was a statutory mitigating factor, in failing to discuss mitigation\nthemes of mental illness, psychology, and mental health experts, and in failing to question\nthe venirepersons about their beliefs on interracial dating and Satanism). The same result,\nfor the same reasons, applies in this case.\n\n       The Petitioner also makes numerous assertions regarding Trial Counsel’s performance\nduring voir dire with respect to venirepersons who were not eventually seated on the\nPetitioner’s jury. However, the obvious corollary to the prerequisite that a post-conviction\npetitioner alleging ineffective assistance of counsel during jury selection must prove that the\neventual jury was biased, is that the trial lawyer’s performance with respect to jurors who\nwere not ultimately seated on the jury is irrelevant.\n\n        Therefore, we emphasize that a post-conviction petitioner raising this issue must focus\nthe proof and argument on the jurors who actually sat and passed judgment on the petitioner.\nIn this case, the Petitioner makes numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during\njury selection by pointing to Trial Counsel’s questions (or lack thereof) and/or challenges (or\nlack thereof) to venirepersons who eventually were eliminated from the jury pool. Trial\nCounsel’s voir dire and challenges as to these venirepersons are simply irrelevant to the\nPetitioner’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Petitioner cannot prove that he\nwas judged by a constitutionally infirm jury by reference to persons who were not on the jury.\nAccordingly, we need not address the Petitioner’s specific claims in this case arising from\nTrial Counsel’s performance regarding potential jurors who did not actually sit in judgment\nof the Petitioner at trial.\n\n        The Petitioner also claims that Trial Counsel “wholly abandoned his role as an\nadvocate, and failed to act as an adversary during the voir dire process” such that this Court\nshould consider his performance ineffective per se. The Petitioner relies on United States\nv. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648 (1984), for this proposition. We, however, disagree that Cronic\nsupports his position. Cronic makes clear that there are exceptional circumstances “that are\nso likely to prejudice the accused” that a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nis presumed. Id. at 658. Such exceptional circumstances include “the complete denial of\ncounsel” during “a critical stage of [the] trial,” id. at 659; the complete failure by counsel “to\n\n                                              -51-\n\fsubject the prosecution’s case to meaningful adversarial testing,” id.; the denial of the right\nto cross-examination, id.; and where “counsel labors under an actual conflict of interest,” id.\nat 662 n.31. The instant case does not present any such exceptional circumstances. Contrary\nto the Petitioner’s claims, Trial Counsel actively participated during voir dire, even to the\nextent of utilizing the services of a jury consultant. The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on\nthis basis.\n\n        To the extent that the Petitioner claims that Trial Counsel was ineffective because only\none of them participated in the jury selection process, allegedly in violation of Tennessee\nSupreme Court Rule 13, section 3, we agree with the State that the cited rule does not require\nthe participation of both attorneys in all decisions related to the representation. Rule 13,\nsection 3(b)(1) simply states that the trial court “shall appoint two attorneys to represent a\ndefendant at trial in a capital case.” Moreover, as noted earlier, post-conviction relief is\nwarranted only when a petitioner establishes that his or her “conviction or sentence is void\nor voidable because of the abridgment of any right guaranteed by the Constitution of\nTennessee or the Constitution of the United States.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-103. As\nsuch, any violation of Rule 13 arising from any failure on attorney Converse’s part to\nparticipate in the jury selection process would not entitle the Petitioner to post-conviction\nrelief.\n\n        Finally, we reject the Petitioner’s claim that Trial Counsel “were further ineffective\nin their failure to object, preserve, raise, and appeal the voir dire issues” set forth in his brief.\nWe have determined that the Petitioner suffered no prejudice from Trial Counsel’s\nperformance during jury selection because he has failed to demonstrate that a biased jury\nresulted. According to the Tennessee Supreme Court:\n\n               If a claim of ineffective assistance of [appellate] counsel is based on the\n       failure to raise a particular issue, . . . then the reviewing court must determine\n       the merits of the issue. Obviously, if an issue has no merit or is weak, then\n       appellate counsel’s performance will not be deficient if counsel fails to raise\n       it. Likewise, unless the omitted issue has some merit, the petitioner suffers no\n       prejudice from appellate counsel’s failure to raise this issue on appeal. When\n       an omitted issue is without merit, the petitioner cannot prevail on an\n       ineffective assistance of [appellate] counsel claim.\n\nCarpenter, 126 S.W.3d at 887-88 (citation omitted). We have determined that the\nPetitioner’s jury passed constitutional muster. An appeal on any of the issues raised by the\nPetitioner regarding jury selection would therefore have been fruitless. See State v. Howell,\n868 S.W.2d 238, 248 (Tenn. 1993) (whether or not the trial court should have excluded\nchallenged jurors for cause, any possible error was harmless unless the jury who actually\n\n                                                -52-\n\fheard the case was not fair and impartial); see also State v. Schmeiderer, 319 S.W.3d 607,\n633 (Tenn. 2010) (“The failure to correctly excuse a juror for cause is grounds for reversal\nonly if the defendant exhausts all of his peremptory challenges and an incompetent juror is\nforced upon him.”). Accordingly, the Petitioner is entitled to no relief on this basis.\n\n        Although we have determined that the Petitioner is not entitled to relief on the basis\nof Trial Counsel’s performance during jury selection because he has failed to demonstrate\nthe prejudice prong of his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we choose also to address\nhis assertion that, “[i]nasmuch as ‘trial strategy’ is the state’s defense to a claim of ineffective\nassistance articulated in a petition for post-conviction relief, the burden of proving strategy\nis on the [State], not on the [P]etitioner.” (Emphasis added.) Not surprisingly, perhaps, the\nPetitioner cites us to no authority for this novel assertion, and we expressly reject the\nPetitioner’s assertion on this point. It is well-established that a trial lawyer is presumed to\nhave represented his or her client pursuant to sound trial strategy. See Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 689. Accordingly, “[j]udicial scrutiny of [an attorney’s] performance is highly\ndeferential,” Combs v. Coyle, 205 F.3d 269, 278 (6th Cir. 2000) (emphasis added), and a\npetitioner alleging deficient performance bears the heavy burden of proving that his or her\nlawyer’s performance was not within the realm of competent trial strategy. See Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 689; Tracy F. Leonard v. State, No. M2006-00654-CCA-R3-PC, 2007 WL\n1946662, at *20 (Tenn. Crim. App. July 5, 2007). Thus, the fact that the State did not call\nattorney Warner to the stand to explain his performance during jury selection does not accrue\nto the Petitioner’s benefit.\n\n        Nor do we agree with the Petitioner that this Court’s decision in Timothy Terell\nMcKinney v. State, No. W2006-02132-CCA-R3-PD, 2010 WL 796939 (Tenn. Crim. App.\nMar. 9, 2010), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Aug. 25, 2010), supports his argument. In\nMcKinney, the capital post-conviction petitioner alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at\ntrial but was unable to adduce testimony from one of his trial lawyers at the post-conviction\nhearing because the trial lawyer was ill. See id. at *29. The petitioner nevertheless adduced\nproof through other sources that his trial lawyers failed to utilize significant and substantial\nevidence at trial that they “knew of or should have known of” and which was damaging to\nthe State’s case, thereby “fail[ing] to subject the prosecution’s case adequately to the\nadversarial process.” Id. at *36. Noting that the evidence against the petitioner at trial “was\nnot overwhelming,” id., this Court concluded that trial counsel’s demonstrated deficiencies\n“undermined confidence in the outcome of the trial.” Id. at 37. Therefore, this Court\ngranted relief. Id. at *56.\n\n       In McKinney, this Court determined that relief was appropriate based upon the\nextensive testimony presented at the post-conviction hearing from one of the petitioner’s trial\nattorneys, the owner of the private investigation firm and one of his employees who were\n\n                                               -53-\n\fhired by counsel to assist the defense, and numerous lay witnesses who testified at the post-\nconviction hearing but not at trial on the subject of whether others may have had motive for\nthe crime and whether the eyewitness descriptions of the perpetrator matched the petitioner.\nSee id. at *5-18. In fact, the attorney who testified at the post-conviction hearing in\nMcKinney stated that the defense theory in that case was that “the victim was shot and that\nthere was very little evidence as to who committed this crime, so the defense for the\n[defendant] was mistaken identity or that essentially that he was not the person who\ncommitted this crime.” Id. at *12. In other words, the combination of all the proof presented\nat the post-conviction hearing, including one of the defense lawyer’s testimony, negated the\npresumption that the identified deficiencies on counsel’s part were the result of trial strategy.\nWith regard to the claimed deficiency attributable only to the attorney who did not testify at\nthe post-conviction hearing in McKinney, this Court noted that no proof had been presented\n“as to the basis of [that attorney’s] decision,” and that, “[a]bsent such proof, this Court will\nnot conclude that counsel blindly refused to engage in the adversarial process.” Id. at *29.\nIn sum, McKinney clearly is distinguishable from this case and does not control the outcome\nof this post-conviction proceeding.\n\n        In his reply brief, the Petitioner reiterates this approach, arguing that his burden is\nlimited to proving “by clear and convincing evidence the fact of counsel’s alleged error” and\nthat the post-conviction court must thereupon determine whether the “alleged error” fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness. Notably, the rest of the Petitioner’s argument\nreveals his interpretation that, by simply proving that trial counsel committed or omitted\nsome action during trial preparations and/or at trial and by then labeling same an “error,” the\nburden then shifts to the State to demonstrate that the alleged “error” was reasonable trial\nstrategy. Again, this is not the law. A post-conviction petitioner must establish both that the\naction was taken (commission) or not (omission) and that the same was erroneous within the\ncontext of the proceeding. We acknowledge that a very few commissions or omissions by\ntrial counsel can be “objectively unreasonable” on their face. See, e.g., Smith, 357 S.W.3d\nat 347-48. Such errors are rare, however, and the Petitioner has identified no such errors\nduring the voir dire of his trial. Therefore, we hold that the post-conviction court committed\nno error in its application of the burden of proof in this case.\n\n        In summary, the Petitioner has failed to establish that any of the jurors who actually\nsat on his case were biased, partial, or incompetent. The record before this Court, including\nboth the record from the Petitioner’s trial and the record of the post-conviction proceeding,\nsimply does not establish that Trial Counsel’s performance during jury selection led to a\nconstitutionally infirm jury. Accordingly, we hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish\nthat Trial Counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during jury selection, and he is\nentitled to no relief on this basis.\n\n\n\n                                              -54-\n\f                                   B. Pretrial Investigation\n\n        In his second issue on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nin denying his claims that Trial Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance with\nregard to their duty to conduct an adequate pretrial investigation concerning (1) the\ncircumstantial evidence of the Petitioner’s guilt and (2) the expert testimony they obtained\nfor use during their case for mitigation at the penalty phase. Specifically, the Petitioner\nalleges that Trial Counsel: (1) failed to investigate adequately the serological evidence\nobtained from the victim’s shorts in order to undermine the State’s position that the victim\nhad been raped at or near the time of her death; (2) failed to appreciate the exculpatory\nsignificance of the pretrial forensic report indicating that none of the soil recovered from the\nPetitioner’s cars or clothing matched soil samples recovered from the location where the\nvictim’s body was found; (3) failed to review adequately the pretrial forensic reports from\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concerning the carpet fiber evidence and develop\ncrucial discrepancies in the evidence that would have undercut the State’s position at trial\nthat fibers consistent with carpet in the Petitioner’s house were found in his car and on the\nvictim’s shorts; (4) failed to investigate adequately the time it would have taken the Petitioner\nto travel the distances necessary to commit the crime and dispose of the victim’s body such\nthat an alibi defense would have been successful; (5) failed to investigate and obtain\nevidence indicating that the Petitioner was coerced into making his statements to law\nenforcement; and (6) failed to review adequately the report prepared by Dr. Keith Caruso and\nthe prejudicial effect Dr. Caruso’s testimony would have on their case for mitigation at\nsentencing.\n\n                          1. Investigation of Serological Evidence\n\n         The State’s proof at trial that the Petitioner raped the victim was entirely\ncircumstantial and based on Squibb’s testimony. Our review of the trial record reveals that\nSquibb’s entire testimony covers only thirty pages of transcript. On direct examination,\nSquibb explained that, when testing an item for the presence of semen, he first performed “an\ninitial test.” If this preliminary screening test yielded a positive result, he then performed “a\nconfirmatory test.” Squibb did not explain the background or details of either of these tests.\nWhen asked about testing the victim’s shorts for semen, Squibb testified that he “found that\nsemen was present on the shorts.” He clarified that three areas in the crotch portion of the\nshorts yielded “positive semen stains” while a fourth area “was inconclusive for semen.” He\nalso explained that, when he received the shorts, they “were very brittle and fell apart\neas[ily].” The following colloquy between the prosecutor and Squibb ensued:\n\n       Q: And in reviewing your – reports, you refer to semen fluid and sperm, is\n       there a difference between those?\n\n                                              -55-\n\f        A: Sperm is a component of semen fluid.\n\n        Q: Were both found on these shorts?\n\n        A: The presence of sperm indicates that semen was also present since sperm\n        is a component of semen.\n\nSquibb’s “reports” were not admitted into evidence.5 Squibb testified that he also tested the\nshorts for blood but his tests “failed to indicate the presence of blood.”\n\n       In addition to testing the victim’s shorts, Squibb tested the victim’s sandals and shirt\nfor blood and semen. The tests were “inconclusive for the presence of blood” and “failed to\nindicate the presence of semen.”\n\n       When asked on direct examination whether the semen on the shorts was human,\nSquibb responded, “I could not tell. It appeared to be human sperm; however, there are other\nspecies which are very close to it, but I did not see any difference between the sperm that I\nviewed as opposed to a human sperm.”\n\n        On cross-examination, Squibb stated that he did not attempt to generate a DNA profile\nfrom the semen stains on the shorts. He also explained the differences between the three\nareas of the shorts that he concluded contained semen stains and the fourth “inconclusive”\narea: “There was some possible sperm heads [in the fourth area], they were not what I would\ncall a ‘sperm head,’ so I left it as an inconclusive. The other [three areas], I had sperm head\npresent so I called it sperm and therefore, semen is present.” Squibb also acknowledged that\nhe tested the Petitioner’s white Chevrolet car for semen and blood and that the tests “failed\nto indicate the presence of blood and semen.”\n\n        On redirect, Squibb clarified that he tested the inside of the shorts. He also clarified\nthe difference between presumptive and confirmatory tests for semen:\n\n               The presumptive test is acid phosphatase, and that is like quick\n        screening of an exhibit to kind of concentrate on possible semen stains,\n        assuming there is a positive area. If it is negative, then no further testing will\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Trial Exhibit 112, admitted during Squibb’s testimony, is a single sheet of paper containing\nhandwritten notes and two diagrams of a pair of shorts. Squibb referred to this document as “a copy of a\nwork sheet that [he] generated in the lab.” At the post-conviction hearing, a copy of Squibb’s “Official\nSerology Report” was admitted into evidence as an exhibit.\n                                                 -56-\n\f       be performed on the exhibit. But if I get a positive reaction, I can then come\n       in on that localized area and further test, do my confirmatory tests.\n\nSquibb added that, on the four areas of the shorts that he tested for semen, the presumptive\ntests were all positive. The confirmatory test was positive on only three of the four areas.\n\n        Squibb was not asked to describe what the “confirmatory test” consisted of or how it\nwas conducted. Nor was he asked any detailed questions about the science underlying any\nof the tests or the level of reliability associated with any of the tests.\n\n        Meghan Clement testified at trial that she tested the cuttings from the shorts for DNA\nbut was unable to obtain a sequence. Therefore, she was unable to compare any DNA on the\nshorts to the Petitioner’s DNA sample. She explained that there were four possible reasons\nfor the inability to obtain a DNA sequence: (1) the DNA was “too degraded”; (2) there was\nan insufficient quantity of DNA on the cuttings; (3) the samples contained “a mixture of\nmore than one DNA . . . so we couldn’t get a clean sequence”; and (4) there may have been\n“chemical inhibitors from environmental insults such as dirt.” On cross-examination,\nClement acknowledged that, if her inability to obtain a DNA sequence was due to a mixture\nof sources, it was possible that there were “two donors of semen.”\n\n       In denying relief on the Petitioner’s claim that Trial Counsel was ineffective in cross-\nexamining these witnesses and failing to adduce proof that the sperm heads found on the\nshorts could have been the result of laundering, the post-conviction court relied on the\nfollowing analysis:\n\n               The testimony of Ms. Clement and Mr. Squibb at the [post-conviction]\n       hearing reveals certain deficiencies in Mr. Warner’s cross-examination of\n       those witnesses at trial. Mr. Squibb’s testing produced evidence favorable to\n       the petitioner, but counsel did not present some of this evidence to the jury.\n       For instance, the jury did not hear there were very few (or “rare,” the term used\n       by the TBI lab to denote fewer than ten) sperm heads found on the microscopic\n       slides developed from the victim’s shorts. Mr. Squibb was also not asked\n       about his testing for semen in great detail; the jury heard no information about\n       the mechanics of the acid phosphatase test (color changes, timing, etc.) or that\n       Mr. Squibb’s acid phosphatase test yielded a “weak” positive result. The jury\n       heard nothing about the P30 antigen as it related to seminal fluid or that Mr.\n       Squibb’s testing yielded negative results for P30. The jury also did not hear\n       that very little DNA was derived from the stains taken from the victim’s shorts.\n       Perhaps most relevant, counsel for the petitioner did not present evidence\n       attacking Mr. Squibb’s conclusion that the presence of sperm cells necessarily\n\n                                             -57-\n\f       indicated the presence of semen. Given Ms. Clement’s testimony and the\n       publication of the washing machine study in the Canadian forensic journal –\n       an article published some four years before the trial in the instant case – such\n       evidence was available to counsel.\n\n              However, although counsel rendered deficient performance in not\n       presenting this evidence to the jury, this deficiency did not prejudice the\n       petitioner. Counsel were still able to present to the jury that the DNA and\n       serology evidence in this case was largely inconclusive. For instance, Mr.\n       Squibb testified that no blood was found in the victim’s shorts and that no\n       blood or semen were found on the victim’s shirt or inside the petitioner’s car.\n       Ms. Clement testified that no DNA sequence could be generated from the\n       victim’s shorts – thus, what little DNA evidence that existed could not be\n       connected conclusively to the petitioner. Mr. Squibb also testified that while\n       the sperm cells “appeared” to be human, he could not conclude that the sperm\n       cells were not animal in nature.\n\n               The petitioner’s attack on the evidence supporting the rape-related\n       offenses in this case was multi-faceted. Counsel argued that the petitioner did\n       not have enough time to commit the offenses, that there was no evidence that\n       he committed these offenses in Montgomery County, and that there was no\n       evidence conclusively establishing that he was the person who committed any\n       sexual offenses against the victim. Although the petitioner’s case could have\n       been strengthened by the inclusion of the scientific and technical evidence\n       produced at the [post-conviction] hearing, counsel still presented ample\n       evidence attacking the entirely circumstantial evidence regarding the rape-\n       related offenses. Despite this evidence, the jury still chose to convict the\n       petitioner; even if counsel had presented the additional evidence to the jury,\n       there is not a reasonable probability that the jury’s verdict in this case would\n       have been different.\n\nWe agree with the post-conviction court’s analysis. Certainly, Trial Counsel should have\ndone a more thorough job attacking Squibb’s testimony. However, the fact remains that\nSquibb found sperm heads on the fabric samples taken from the crotch area of the victim’s\nshorts. Clement agreed at the post-conviction hearing with Squibb’s finding of sperm heads.\nThe victim’s mother testified at trial that the victim had put the shorts on right before leaving\nher house and disappearing. While Clement’s testimony at the post-conviction hearing\nestablished that it is possible for sperm heads to arrive on clothing while being laundered in\na washing machine, she also testified that the experiments in which such transfer occurred\ninvolved washing new clothing with “a pair of underwear worn by someone who had\n\n                                              -58-\n\fconsensual relations.” Thus, proof of these experiments would not have been relevant at trial\nunless the defense had also been able to establish at least some probability that the victim’s\nshorts had been washed with an item containing semen. No such probability was established\nat the post-conviction hearing. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Trial Counsel’s\nperformance in his cross-examination of Squibb prejudiced the Petitioner.\n\n        In sum, Trial Counsel should have attacked the State’s proof regarding the\nsemen/sperm issue with more vigor. The Petitioner, however, has not established that the\njury’s verdicts are unreliable as a result of this failure because there has been no showing that\nthe defense would have been able to eliminate or completely discredit the State’s proof that\nsperm heads were found in the crotch area of the victim’s shorts. That proof, together with\nthe substantial proof at trial that the Petitioner was the last person to see the victim alive,\nleaves us confident in the jury’s verdict. Accordingly, the Petitioner is not entitled to relief\non this basis.\n\n       The Petitioner also asserts that Trial Counsel was ineffective in not challenging the\nadmissibility of the DNA testing and in not pursuing the theory that the DNA testing was\ninconclusive “because the substance was not human biological material.” This issue is\nwithout merit. As noted by the post-conviction court, “[t]he inconclusive nature of the DNA\nevidence went to the evidence’s weight, not its admissibility.” Moreover, Trial Counsel\nemphasized through Squibb the possibility that the sperm heads were not human. The\nPetitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                           2. Failure to Investigate Soil Evidence\n\n       The Petitioner claims that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to adduce\n“exculpatory soil evidence which excluded [him] as having been present at the crime scene\nat Land Between the Lakes where the [victim’s] remains were found.” This assertion is\nbased upon an FBI Report of Examination prepared by Bruce W. Hall on July 15, 1997, and\nwhich states, in toto, the following “Results of Examinations”:\n\n              Among the soil samples collected from where the victim was last seen,\n       specimens K1 through K5, specimen K3 is characteristic of soil recovered\n       from the subject’s vehicle, specimen Q1. Soil representing the road associated\n       with the body recovery site, specimen K15 through K18, although seeming\n       similar to the soil recovered from the subject’s vehicle, is dissimilar. Soil\n       recovered from the subject’s shirt, shoes and sandals, specimens Q13, Q14,\n       Q15 and Q27 respectively, is likewise dissimilar and cannot be associated with\n       any of the aforementioned known soil samples as well as those collected from\n       where the victim was found, specimens K12 through K14.\n\n                                              -59-\n\fAlthough this report is certainly intriguing, the Petitioner cannot ask either a post-conviction\ncourt or an appellate court to draw from it the conclusion that it excluded the Petitioner as\nthe person who deposited the victim’s body where it was found in Land Between the Lakes.\nThe Petitioner called no one at the post-conviction hearing to testify about this report or to\nexplain its conclusions and/or other data necessary for interpreting the significance of the\nresults.\n\n       Thus, again, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Trial\nCounsel’s “failure” to utilize this information at trial. As noted by the State in its brief to this\nCourt, the soil samples collected by law enforcement personnel from the Petitioner’s car were\ncollected after the car had been cleaned, according to the Petitioner’s wife’s testimony. The\nState therefore had a ready explanation had Trial Counsel elicited the lack of a match\nbetween the soil samples collected from the area in which the victim was found and the soil\nsamples collected from the Petitioner’s car. Also, absent proof that the Petitioner’s clothing\nfrom which additional soil samples were collected was the same unwashed clothing that the\nPetitioner was wearing during the afternoon of July 8, 1996, the lack of a match would have\nbeen irrelevant. In this regard, we note that a typed report by the FBI, made an exhibit to the\npost-conviction hearing, relates that, on July 11, 1996, during the search of the Petitioner’s\nresidence, the Petitioner’s wife “provided . . . clothing she believes was worn by [the\nPetitioner] on July 8, 1996. A red ‘Nike’ T-shirt was recovered from the dryer. [The\nPetitioner’s wife] advised the T-shirt had been washed and dried. [The Petitioner’s wife]\nprovided a pair of blue jeans from the washer. The blue jeans were still wet from being\nwashed.” Therefore, Trial Counsel’s “failure” to adduce the proof about the soil samples\ndoes not render the jury’s verdicts unreliable. The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this\nissue.\n\n                                       3. Fiber Evidence\n\n        The Petitioner contends that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to exploit\ndiscrepancies in some of the State’s proof regarding fibers found on the victim’s clothing and\nin the Petitioner’s cars and home. The Petitioner asserts in his brief to this Court that “[t]hese\ndiscrepancies were not utilized in cross-examination of any of the State’s witnesses, and the\njury was left with the State’s unchallenged yet dubious story of ‘fiber transfer’ which tied\n[the victim] to [the Petitioner’s] car.”\n\n        To the contrary, testimony by the State’s own witnesses during both direct and cross-\nexamination established discrepancies in the fiber evidence and created questions about the\nfiber transfer. TBI Agent Linda Littlejohn testified at trial that the fibers she found on the\nvictim’s clothing did not match the fibers from the carpet and seat standards taken from the\nPetitioner’s cars. FBI scientist Max Michael Houck testified that fibers found in vacuumings\n\n                                               -60-\n\ffrom the Petitioner’s two vehicles and on the victim’s shorts “exhibited the same microscopic\ncharacteristics and optical properties as the known fibers from the [Petitioner’s] living room\ncarpet.” Trial Counsel conducted a thorough cross-examination of Houck, eliciting\ntestimony that established that the fibers on the victim’s shorts could have resulted from a\ntransfer that involved neither the victim’s presence in the Petitioner’s living room or in either\nof his cars. Trial Counsel also attacked the reliability and validity of the asserted\nconsistencies by pointing out that the fibers from the Petitioner’s living room carpet were not\nobtained until mid-1997. Trial Counsel also obtained Houck’s admission that a fiber\nexamination “is not like a fingerprint or a six probe DNA match.” FBI chemist Ronald\nMenold testified that the fibers “were consistent with each other in polymeric composition\nand that that composition was consistent with polyethylene carasylate (phonetic), which is\na sub-class of a polyester fiber.” Trial Counsel also conducted a thorough cross-examination\nof this witness, eliciting, among other things, Menold’s admission that the FBI’s Handbook\nof Forensic Science stated that such consistency was “not positive evidence but good\ncircumstantial evidence.”\n\n       The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate how the absence of further attacks on the\nState’s fiber proof renders the jury’s verdicts unreliable. We note, in particular, that the\nPetitioner admitted to law enforcement officers that the victim had been in his car. The\nPetitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                      4. Alibi Evidence\n\n        The Petitioner claims that Trial Counsel performed inadequately in presenting proof\nthat it was physically impossible for him to have committed the crimes of which he was\nconvicted between the time that the victim disappeared and the time that witnesses saw him\nat the Phillips 66 on Riverside Drive in Clarksville. At the post-conviction hearing, the\nPetitioner adduced proof that it took two hours and forty-four minutes to travel from the\nvictim’s home to Land Between the Lakes, walk the distance to and from the area where the\nvictim’s body was found, and return to the Phillips 66. The proof at trial demonstrated that\nthe victim was kidnapped at approximately 1:40 p.m. and that, according to the defense\ntheory, the Petitioner was seen at 4:00 that same day at the Phillips 66: a period of only two\nhours and twenty minutes. The Petitioner asserts that Trial Counsel did not establish this\nsignificant time discrepancy at trial.\n\n       The post-conviction court denied relief because similar proof was adduced at trial\nthrough Investigator Batson and Trial Counsel utilized that proof to argue to the jury that\nthere was not sufficient time for the Petitioner to have committed the crimes. We agree with\nthe post-conviction court that Trial Counsel was not ineffective in this regard. This defense\ntheory depended upon the jury’s accepting the testimony of the alibi witnesses, testimony\n\n                                              -61-\n\fwhich the jury rejected, as was its prerogative. The State’s theory, based on the Petitioner’s\nwife’s testimony, was that the Petitioner was not seen back in Clarksville until 6:00 that\nevening, providing him with ample time to commit the crimes. The jury clearly accredited\nthe State’s theory over the Petitioner’s. Trial Counsel was not ineffective in this regard, and\nthe Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                 5. Psychological Evidence\n\n        The Petitioner contends that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate and\nsubsequently adduce expert proof at the motion to suppress his statement that his statement\nwas coerced, involuntary, and unreliable. In support of this contention, the Petitioner points\nto Dr. Auble’s testimony at the post-conviction hearing, observing that Dr. Auble would have\nbeen available to evaluate the Petitioner and testify at the suppression hearing. The Petitioner\nasserts in his brief to this Court that, “[h]ad Dr. Auble’s testimony been presented, his\nstatement would have been suppressed[,]” “excluded . . . due to its extreme unreliability, or\nits impact on the jury would have been minimized by Dr. Auble’s testimony.” The post-\nconviction court ruled as follows on this issue:\n\n       [T]he substance of Dr. Auble’s [post-conviction] hearing testimony was that\n       the petitioner confessed to running over the victim with his car because the\n       police led him to believe that he would be charged with a lesser offense (i.e.,\n       vehicular homicide as opposed to first degree murder) if he confessed to\n       running over the victim with his car. However, this assertion is inconsistent\n       with the testimony from the suppression hearing, and at the [post-conviction]\n       hearing Mr. Batson testified that the police did not induce the petitioner to\n       confess by promising he would be charged with a lesser offense. Rather, Mr.\n       Batson testified that as the police took the petitioner back to the criminal\n       justice center after visiting the hospital, the petitioner asked, without\n       prompting, “Will I be charged with vehicular homicide?” Mr. Batson testified\n       that he then told the petitioner that he would explain the charges to [him]. Mr.\n       Batson also said that before this statement, none of the law enforcement agents\n       suggested that the petitioner had run over the victim with his car.\n\n              In light of the evidence, the court concludes that to any extent that\n       counsel may have been ineffective for not arguing that the petitioner’s\n       statement was coerced or otherwise involuntary, and for not presenting expert\n       witness testimony in support of this assertion, such actions did not prejudice\n       the petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -62-\n\fIn essence, the post-conviction court made a finding of credibility in favor of Investigator\nBatson and against Dr. Auble. The evidence does not preponderate against this finding.\nTherefore, we may not overturn it. See Wallace v. State, 121 S.W.3d 652, 656 (Tenn. 2003);\nState v. Dyron Norm Yokley, No. E2009-02646-CCA-R3CD, 2011 WL 2120096, at *26\n(Tenn. Crim. App. May 20, 2011), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Sept. 21, 2011) (recognizing that\nthis Court “is not at liberty to reevaluate matters of witness credibility unless the evidence\npreponderates against the trial court’s findings”). The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on\nthis basis.\n\n                                6. Mitigation Expert’s Report\n\n        Finally, the Petitioner contends that Trial Counsel “failed to adequately investigate\nits own expert’s opinion, resulting in the introduction of evidence which supported the\nState’s case for the death penalty.” The Petitioner refers to Dr. Keith Caruso’s testimony and\nreport presented by the defense during the sentencing phase of his trial, particularly Dr.\nCaruso’s testimony, “I think [the Petitioner] hasn’t been able to admit to himself that he did\nthese things yet, so it is difficult to say whether or not – I don’t see that he entirely lacks\nremorse. I don’t see him as being very far long [sic] in the pattern of remorse or feeling sorry\nfor what he has done yet.” The Petitioner argues that Dr. Caruso impliedly endorsed the\njury’s finding of guilt, “thereby crippling any residual doubt argument as a mitigating factor.”\nHe asserts, “Surely it cannot be disputed that a careful reading of Dr. Caruso’s report,\nparticularly in light of the far more favorable report of Dr. Neilson . . . , would cause a lawyer\nexercising reasonable professional judgment to decline to present Dr. Caruso as an expert.”\n\n        To prove the prejudice prong of ineffective assistance of counsel during the capital\nsentencing phase of the petitioner’s trial, the petitioner must establish that “there is a\nreasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that\nthe balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 695. In determining whether defense counsel was ineffective in its investigation\nof and/or presentation of mitigating evidence, the reviewing court must “analyze[] the nature\nand extent of the mitigating evidence that was available but not presented,” determine\n“whether substantially similar mitigating evidence was presented to the jury during either the\nguilt or penalty phase of the proceedings,” and consider “whether there was such strong\nevidence of aggravating factors that the mitigating evidence would not have affected the\njury’s determination.” Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 371. When the petitioner argues, as here, that\nprejudicial “mitigation” evidence was presented, we construe the first of these factors as\nreferring to the nature and extent of the allegedly prejudicial evidence presented and the third\nfactor as referring to whether the evidence of the applicable aggravating factors was so\nstrong that the absence of the allegedly prejudicial mitigating evidence would not have\naffected the jury’s verdict.\n\n                                              -63-\n\f        After reviewing the trial testimony of both Dr. Caruso and Dr. Neilson, who also\ntestified in mitigation for the Petitioner at trial, the post-conviction court found that\n\n       Dr. Caruso’s assessment of the petitioner [was not] significantly less favorable\n       to the petitioner than Dr. Neilson’s assessment. Although Dr. Caruso did not\n       diagnose the petitioner with the same (or as many) disorders as did Dr.\n       Neilson, Dr. Caruso testified that the petitioner’ actions were affected by –\n       although if not caused by – the extreme emotional distress resulting from the\n       petitioner’s upbringing.\n\n               Furthermore, the evidence of the four aggravating circumstances was\n       substantial, so even if Dr. Caruso’s testimony had not been presented to the\n       jury, Dr. Neilson’s testimony, standing alone, would not have affected the\n       jury’s sentencing decision.\n\nWe agree with the post-conviction court on this issue. Moreover, while the Petitioner has\ncouched this contention in terms of inadequate investigation, the real thrust of his complaint\nis that Trial Counsel made a poor tactical decision in calling Dr. Caruso to testify. The\nrecord, however, does not support the conclusion that Trial Counsel’s strategic choice in this\nregard fell so far below the level of reasonable performance as to constitute deficient\nperformance. For instance, we note that Converse testified that one of the reasons the\ndefense called Dr. Caruso was to counteract the State’s claim that the Petitioner suffered\nfrom pedophilia. The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                      C. Pretrial Motions\n\n        In his third issue on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nin denying his claims that Trial Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance with\nregard to the filing of certain necessary pretrial motions. Specifically, the Petitioner alleges\nthat Trial Counsel: (1) failed to support adequately with proper citation to legal authority or\nevidence the motion to dismiss, which was construed by the trial court as a motion to dismiss\nbased upon a violation of the Petitioner’s right to a speedy trial; (2) failed to assert adequately\nas a basis for the motion to dismiss the prosecutorial misconduct by the State in not providing\ndiscovery to the defense in a timely fashion; (3) failed to file a motion for a bill of particulars\nasking the State to provide the date, time and location of each offense alleged in the\nindictment; (4) failed to file a pretrial motion seeking exclusion of testimony from the\nPetitioner’s wife, Juanita Rogers, concerning certain privileged marital communications; (5)\nfailed to present a constitutionally adequate motion to suppress the Petitioner’s statements\nto law enforcement; (6) failed to challenge Montgomery County as the proper venue for the\n\n\n\n                                               -64-\n\fhomicide and rape charges; and (7) failed to seek severance of the rape of a child offense\nfrom the remaining counts charged in the indictment.\n\n        The post-conviction court denied the claims related to Trial Counsel’s failure to file\na motion for a bill of particulars and failure to file a pretrial motion seeking exclusion of the\nPetitioner’s wife’s testimony at trial on grounds that the Petitioner failed to adduce proof as\nto why Trial Counsel did not pursue these motions, leaving it to speculate as to Trial\nCounsel’s performance.6 The record supports the post-conviction court’s findings on this\nissue. Accordingly, the Petitioner has failed to prove these claims, and they properly were\ndenied. See Gdongaley P. Berry v. State, No. M2010-01136-CCA-R3-PD, 2011 WL\n5326280, at *8 (Tenn. Crim. App. Nov. 4, 2011), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Feb. 16, 2010)\n(rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where petitioner did not question his\nattorneys about the claimed deficiencies, leaving the court to speculate as to their\nperformance). We address the remaining claims on this issue below.\n\n                               1. The Bloodworth Motion to Dismiss\n\n        As the State asserts in its brief, the Petitioner failed to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence that Trial Counsel performed deficiently with regard to the motion to dismiss filed\nby Charles Bloodworth. Although the Petitioner presented testimony at the post-conviction\nhearing regarding Bloodworth’s reasons for filing the motion and the sequence of events\nleading up to its filing, the record is silent as to the arguments and evidence actually\npresented by Bloodworth at the hearings on the motion. This is so because the record from\nthe Petitioner’s direct appeal, which was incorporated by reference into the post-conviction\nrecord, does not contain the transcripts from the three separate hearings held in 1997 on the\nmotion and referred to by the trial court in the order denying the motion to dismiss. The post-\nconviction court properly concluded that the Petitioner’s failure to include these transcripts\nin the record “limited” its “ability to review the issue.”7 Moreover, this Court is precluded\nfrom considering an issue when the record is incomplete and does not contain a transcript of\nthe proceedings relevant to the issue presented for review. State v. Roberts, 755 S.W.2d 833,\n836 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1988). As such, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the\npost-conviction court erred in denying his claims that Bloodworth provided ineffective\n\n\n\n\n        6\n         The post-conviction court also determined that Mrs. Rogers’ testimony was not subject to exclusion\nunder the marital communications privilege.\n        7\n          After reviewing the motion and the trial court’s order, the post-conviction court also concluded that\nthe Petitioner had failed to establish “that the trial court would have granted the petitioner’s motion to\ndismiss had Mr. Bloodworth raised different arguments in the motion.”\n                                                     -65-\n\fassistance with regard to the arguments and proof presented in support of the motion to\ndismiss.\n\n                       2. Failure to File Adequate Motion to Suppress\n\n       Prior to trial, Trial Counsel filed a motion to suppress the Petitioner’s statements to\nlaw enforcement. After a hearing, at which several witnesses testified, the trial court denied\nthe motion. The Petitioner maintains that counsel was ineffective in presenting the motion,\nasserting in his brief to this Court that Trial Counsel failed to argue that the Petitioner had\nbeen subjected to custodial interrogation prior to receiving his Miranda warnings, thereby\nrendering inadmissible the statements he gave after receiving the Miranda warnings. See\nMissouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 613-14, 617 (2004); State v. Dailey, 273 S.W.3d 94, 107-\n110 (Tenn. 2009). Therefore, to prevail on this claim, the Petitioner must establish that he\nwas “in custody” prior to having received the Miranda warnings.\n\n        In State v. Anderson, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that the test for determining\nwhether a suspect is in custody and entitled to Miranda warnings is “whether, under the\ntotality of the circumstances, a reasonable person in the suspect’s position would consider\nhimself or herself deprived of freedom of movement to a degree associated with a formal\narrest.” 937 S.W.2d 851, 855 (Tenn. 1996). See also Berkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420,\n441-42 (1984). The Anderson court set forth the following non-exclusive list of factors\nrelevant to this “objective assessment”:\n\n       the time and location of the interrogation; the duration and character of the\n       questioning; the officer’s tone of voice and general demeanor; the suspect’s\n       method of transportation to the place of questioning; the number of police\n       officers present; any limitation on movement or other form of restraint\n       imposed on the suspect during the interrogation; any interactions between the\n       officer and the suspect, including the words spoken by the officer to the\n       suspect, and the suspect’s verbal or nonverbal responses; the extent to which\n       the suspect is confronted with the law enforcement officer’s suspicions of guilt\n       or evidence of guilt; and finally, the extent to which the suspect is made aware\n       that he or she is free to refrain from answering questions or to end the\n       interview at will.\n\nAnderson, 937 S.W.2d at 855. The Anderson court stressed that the determination of\nwhether a suspect is in custody for Miranda purposes is a “very fact specific inquiry.” Id.\n\n        During the post-conviction hearing, the Petitioner adduced no testimony relevant to\nthis issue from any of the participants in the Petitioner’s initial questioning. Thus, we are left\n\n                                              -66-\n\fwith only the testimony adduced during the hearing on the motion to suppress from which\nto glean the Petitioner’s custodial status prior to the time he was given his Miranda warnings.\n\n        Sergeant Clifton Smith of the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department testified that\nhe initially approached the Petitioner at the Petitioner’s job site. Sgt. Smith then left and\nspoke with the Petitioner’s wife. After this conversation, Sgt. Smith returned to the\nPetitioner’s job site and asked the Petitioner if he was willing to accompany Sgt. Smith to the\nCriminal Justice Center for an interview. The Petitioner answered affirmatively and followed\nSgt. Smith to the Criminal Justice Center in the Petitioner’s own vehicle. When they arrived,\nthe Petitioner accompanied Sgt. Smith into the building. The Petitioner was not placed in\nhandcuffs, nor was he placed under arrest. The men entered an interview room and the\nPetitioner took a seat. Sgt. Smith testified that Investigator Billy Batson and FBI Special\nAgent Brett Murray were also in the room. By this time it was approximately 10:45 in the\nmorning. Special Agent Brett Murray began to question the Petitioner about his possible\ninvolvement in the victim’s disappearance. Sgt. Smith testified that, at this point in time, the\nPetitioner was not the only suspect in the case. During the interview, the Petitioner “said that\nhe was the one that we were looking for,” apparently referring to a composite drawing that\nhad been composed. At that point, 11:18 that morning, Sgt. Smith issued Miranda warnings\nto the Petitioner.\n\n       We have closely reviewed the record of the hearing on the motion to suppress. The\nPetitioner simply has failed to establish that he was “in custody” prior to receiving his\nMiranda warnings such that Trial Counsel should have raised this issue in the hearing on the\nmotion to suppress. Although the Petitioner attempts to rely on Dailey, that case is\ndistinguishable on the facts. In Dailey, as in this case, the suspect drove himself to the police\nstation upon an officer’s request. Once there, he was taken to an interview room and\ninterrogated. The interrogation was videotaped and, upon reviewing the tape, the Tennessee\nSupreme Court was able to determine the following:\n\n       The interview took place in a small interrogation room located in a secured\n       portion of the building. The initial phase of the interview was not prolonged.\n       The character of the questioning was accusatory and demanding, aimed at\n       convincing the Defendant that the police already had sufficient evidence to\n       convict him of murdering the victim and that he had to give them an\n       explanation. Det. Roland’s and Sgt. Postiglione’s tone of voice and general\n       demeanor were conversational; however, at least one of the officers was\n       armed. Two officers questioned him. The Defendant’s movements were\n       restrained to the extent that he was placed in the back corner of a small room\n       with one door, the door was closed, and a police officer was sitting between\n       the Defendant and the closed door. The interactions between the Defendant\n\n                                              -67-\n\f       and the officers consisted of a few prefatory comments about the Defendant’s\n       practice of homeschooling followed by increasingly focused accusations and\n       questions about the Defendant’s involvement in the victim’s death. Only a few\n       minutes into the interrogation, Det. Roland told the Defendant that if he went\n       “strictly on the evidence, [he had] to charge [the Defendant] with first degree\n       murder.” The Defendant’s initial responses ran the gamut from unequivocal\n       denials to challenges to statements of “I don’t know what to say.” Eventually,\n       after having been repeatedly told that the officers knew the Defendant was\n       involved in the victim’s death and just needed the details as to why, and that\n       the police already had sufficient evidence to convict him of first degree\n       murder, the Defendant confessed to killing the victim. The officers never\n       informed the Defendant that he was free to refrain from answering questions\n       or that he was free to end the interview until after they had extracted a\n       confession from him.\n\n              This full recitation of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the\n       Defendant’s initial questioning convinces us that a reasonable person in the\n       Defendant’s position would have considered himself or herself “deprived of\n       freedom of movement to a degree associated with a formal arrest,” at least by\n       the point at which Det. Roland stated, “if I go strictly on the evidence, I have\n       to charge you with first degree murder.”\n\nDailey, 273 S.W.3d at 103-04 (footnote omitted). The only similarities in the two cases is\nthat the Petitioner drove himself to the police station and was questioned there by more than\none officer in a room. Unlike the situation in Dailey, however, the record does not establish\nthat, prior to being issued Miranda warnings, the Petitioner was taken to a room in a secured\narea of the building; that the door was closed; that the Petitioner was physically blocked from\nleaving the room; or that he was threatened with prosecution and told that there was already\nenough evidence to charge him with a serious felony. In short, the record in this case does\nnot establish that a reasonable person in the Petitioner’s position would have considered\nhimself deprived of freedom of movement to a degree associated with a formal arrest prior\nto the time he was issued Miranda warnings. Accordingly, the Petitioner has failed to\nestablish that Trial Counsel was deficient in failing to make this argument in support of the\nmotion to suppress the Petitioner’s statements. The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this\nbasis.\n\n      The Petitioner also asserts that Trial Counsel should have moved to suppress the\nevidence arising out of his visit to Potter’s Lane and the bridge with law enforcement while\naccompanied by Goodlett, arguing that Goodlett’s cooperation in this trip and reenactment\nprovided a basis for suppression under the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel. The\n\n                                              -68-\n\fPetitioner has cited us to no authority for the suppression of evidence on the basis of\nineffective assistance of counsel during the gathering of said evidence. Therefore, this issue\nhas been waived. See Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b).\n\n       3. Failure to Challenge Venue and Failure to Seek Severance of Rape Charge\n\n       As the State asserts in its brief, even assuming that Trial Counsel’s performance was\nconstitutionally deficient with regard to their failure to file a motion challenging Montgomery\nCounty as the proper venue for the homicide and rape charges and their failure to file a\nmotion seeking severance of the rape charge from the remaining offenses charged in the\nindictment, the Petitioner did not prove resulting prejudice. As the post-conviction court\nconcluded in the order denying relief, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to\nestablish venue in Montgomery County as to all offenses.\n\n       In denying the Petitioner’s claim regarding Trial Counsel’s failure to challenge venue,\nthe post-conviction court stated:\n\n       [T]he evidence established that the [Petitioner] left the area of the victim’s\n       home around 2:00 p.m. the day the victim was last seen alive. The [Petitioner]\n       admitted to law enforcement officers that he was the last person to see the\n       victim alive – in Montgomery County – and that the last known location of the\n       victim before her remains were found was the [P]etitioner’s car. This evidence\n       was sufficient for the jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n       [Petitioner] formed his intent to kill the victim – i.e., premeditation, an element\n       of premeditated first degree murder – in Montgomery County, even if the\n       victim’s remains were found in another county.\n\n               Regarding the charge for felony murder in perpetration of kidnapping,\n       the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the [P]etitioner abducted\n       the victim in the vicinity of her Montgomery County home and that the victim\n       was still alive when the [P]etitioner put her in his truck [sic]. Thus, venue was\n       proper for that felony murder count.\n\n              Regarding the charges for felony murder in perpetration of a rape and\n       child rape, the evidence of the [P]etitioner’s sexual offenses was wholly\n       circumstantial – the victim changed into clean shorts shortly before she\n       disappeared, semen stains were found in the victim’s shorts, and the shirt the\n       victim was wearing when her remains were discovered was turned inside out,\n       which was consistent with being removed from her body by a human. Because\n       the jury is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, and\n\n                                              -69-\n\f       because venue may be established by circumstantial evidence, the Court finds\n       that it was reasonable for the jury to find that venue was proper in\n       Montgomery County[.]\n\n              Venue is a jury question, and the evidence in this case regarding venue\n       was sufficient to present the venue question to the jury on all counts.\n       Furthermore, the evidence produced at trial was sufficient to establish venue\n       in Montgomery County as to all offenses, including the homicide and rape\n       charges. Thus, counsel’s decision not to assert that the offenses occurred\n       elsewhere did not prejudice the [P]etitioner.\n\n       The evidence presented at the Petitioner’s trial supports the post-conviction court’s\nfindings in this regard. Although the prosecutor took the position during closing argument\nthat the rape occurred in Stewart County, the proof at trial was equally amenable to the\nconclusion that the Petitioner raped and killed the victim while they were still somewhere in\nMontgomery County and that he then transported her body to Stewart County for disposal.\nCertainly, it would have been easier to conceal a deceased child during the long drive\nbetween the scene of the abduction and the area where the victim’s remains were found than\nto keep a live abducted child subdued so as not to attract attention.\n\n       The law on venue also supports the post-conviction court’s conclusion that venue in\nMontgomery County as to the homicide and rape charges was established by the evidence\npresented at trial. As our supreme court explained in State v. Young, 196 S.W.3d 85, 101-\n102 (Tenn. 2006):\n\n               Our Constitution provides that an accused must be tried in the county\n       in which the crime was committed. Tenn. Const. art. I, § 9; see also Tenn. R.\n       Crim. P. 18(a) (“Except as otherwise provided by statute or by these rules,\n       offenses shall be prosecuted in the county where the offense was committed.”).\n       “Proof of venue is necessary to establish the jurisdiction of the court, but it is\n       not an element of any offense and need only be proved by a preponderance of\n       the evidence.” State v. Hutcherson, 790 S.W.2d 532, 535 (Tenn. 1990); see\n       also Tenn. Code Ann. § 39-11-201(e) (“No person may be convicted of an\n       offense unless venue is proven by a preponderance of the evidence.”). Venue\n       is a question for the jury, State v. Hamsley, 672 S.W.2d 437, 439 (Tenn. Crim.\n       App. 1984), and may be proven by circumstantial evidence. State v. Bennett,\n       549 S.W.2d 949, 950 (Tenn.1977). In determining venue, the jury is entitled\n       to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence. State v. Johnson, 673\n       S.W.2d 877, 882 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1984). Importantly, where different\n\n\n\n                                             -70-\n\f       elements of the same offense are committed in different counties, “the offense\n       may be prosecuted in either county.” Tenn. R. Crim. P. 18(b).\n\nId.; see also State v. Davis, 872 S.W.2d 950, 952-53 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1993).\n\n        The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis. In concluding that the Petitioner\nhad failed to establish resulting prejudice from any deficiency on Trial Counsel’s part in\nfailing to seek severance of the rape charge from the remaining offenses charged in the\n\nindictment, the post-conviction court stated:\n\n       The [P]etitioner does not argue that evidence regarding the rape would have\n       been inadmissible in trials on the other counts, and vice versa; clearly the\n       offenses with which the [P]etitioner was charged were “based on the same\n       conduct or ar[o]se from the same criminal episode” such that joinder of the\n       offenses would have been mandatory under Rule 8(a) of the Tennessee Rules\n       of Criminal Procedure. The [P]etitioner argues that severance would have\n       been necessary under Rule 14(b)(2) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal\n       Procedure because severance would have been “appropriate to promote a fair\n       determination of the [Petitioner’s] guilt or innocence of each offense,” but the\n       Court disagrees with the [P]etitioner’s assertion. The trial court properly\n       instructed the jury that for each offense, it could return a guilty verdict only if\n       it found by a preponderance of the evidence that the given offenses occurred\n       in Montgomery County. There is no evidence in the record to support that the\n       jury was confused regarding the trial court’s instructions.\n\nWe agree with the post-conviction court’s conclusion on this issue and hold that the\nPetitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                    D. Trial Performance\n\n        In his fourth issue on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nin denying his claims that Trial Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance\nduring the course of trial. Specifically, the Petitioner alleges that Trial Counsel: (1) failed\nto object to the trial court’s statement to prospective jurors during jury selection to the effect\nthat a finding of not guilty as to the murder counts would result in no sentencing hearing; (2)\nfailed to object to the victim impact testimony presented by the State at sentencing as unduly\nprejudicial; (3) failed to object to and move for a mistrial based upon the State’s tactic of\nposing speaking objections in the presence of the jury; (4) failed to object to and move for\na mistrial based upon the State’s asking leading questions of its own witnesses; (5) failed to\n\n                                               -71-\n\fobject to and move for a mistrial based upon the State’s mischaracterization of the\nPetitioner’s statement to law enforcement as a “confession to murder”; (6) failed to object\nto the State’s presenting improper evidence from the nurse who drew Petitioner’s blood for\nforensic testing prior to trial concerning the Petitioner’s demeanor as being “upbeat” and\n“joking”; (7) conceded the Petitioner’s involvement in the crimes during closing argument\nat sentencing; (8) failed to object with sufficient legal argument to the admissibility of the\npedophilia propensity testimony presented by Dr. William Bernet; (9) failed to proffer as an\nexhibit during the jury-out hearing at trial the DCS records documenting that the victim’s\nbrother, Jeremy Beard, had told psychologists approximately six to twelve months after the\nvictim’s disappearance that his biological father had some years earlier “taught him to have\nsex with his sister”; (10) failed to utilize the DCS records pertaining to Jeremy Beard during\ncross-examination of the victim’s mother, Jeannie Meyer, at sentencing when she attributed\nJeremy’s mental health problems entirely to the victim’s disappearance and death; and (11)\nfailed to object to certain irrelevant and inconclusive evidence and testimony introduced by\nthe State at trial.\n\n        The post-conviction court denied all but one of these claims, in part, because the\nPetitioner failed to question attorney Converse regarding these claims and thereby present\nany evidence in support of these claims. The record supports the post-conviction court’s\nfindings in this regard. Converse did not testify at the post-conviction hearing about any of\nthe specific acts or omissions identified in this issue and alleged by the Petitioner in support\nof his claims that Trial Counsel’s trial performance amounted to ineffective assistance. We\nrecognize that Converse was questioned generally at the hearing regarding his belief in the\noverwhelming guilt of the Petitioner and about Dr. William Bernet’s conclusion that the\nPetitioner had pedophilic tendencies. However, the Petitioner never asked Converse why he\nconceded the Petitioner’s involvement in the crimes during closing argument at sentencing\nand never asked Converse to elaborate on his thought process regarding the objection he\nmade to Dr. Bernet’s pedophilia propensity testimony at sentencing. In short, the Petitioner\nhas failed to overcome the strong presumption that Trial Counsel’s performance as to these\nmatters was the result of a strategic or tactical decision and has therefore failed to establish\ndeficient performance as to these allegations. See Gdongalay P. Berry, 2011 WL 5326280,\nat *8.\n\n       With regard to Trial Counsel’s alleged failure to proffer the DCS records as an exhibit\nduring the jury-out hearing at trial, the post-conviction court determined that Trial Counsel\nhad made an offer of proof in the form of testimony from the victim’s mother concerning the\nsubstance of the statements attributable to Jeremy Beard as reflected in the DCS records. As\nsuch, the post-conviction court concluded that the Petitioner could not prove prejudice to the\noutcome of his case resulting from the asserted deficiency in Trial Counsel’s performance\nin not proffering the DCS records containing the same statements from Jeremy Beard.\n\n                                              -72-\n\f        The record supports the post-conviction court’s conclusion in this regard. As the\nsupreme court noted in its opinion in the Petitioner’s direct appeal, the Petitioner proffered\ntestimony from Jeannie Meyer during a jury-out hearing concerning the statements Jeremy\nBeard had made to her, which in turn she had reported to medical personnel as reflected in\nthe DCS records. See Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 609 n.5. Therefore, when the supreme court\nconcluded on direct appeal that evidence from Jeremy Beard confirming that he had made\nthe statements “would not establish that Jeremy had actually had sex with the victim versus\nsimply reporting that he had,” id. at 613, the supreme court had before it the proffer of\nJeannie Meyer’s testimony concerning the substance of the statements, see id. at 609 n.5,\neven though it declined to consider as having been improperly included in the record on\nappeal the DCS records which also included the statement. See id. at 611. As such, as the\npost-conviction court concluded, there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the\nPetitioner’s direct appeal would have been different had the records themselves been\nproffered. Accordingly, this entire issue is without merit.\n\n                      E and F. Jury Instructions and Appellate Issues\n\n       In his fifth and sixth issues on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction\ncourt erred in denying his claims that Trial Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective\nassistance by failing to object to various jury instructions given by the trial court during the\nPetitioner’s trial and by failing to raise various issues on appeal during the Petitioner’s direct\nappellate proceedings. Once again, the post-conviction court denied these claims, in part,\nbecause the Petitioner failed to present any testimony in support of the claims at the post-\nconviction hearing. As the State argues in its brief, the record supports the post-conviction\ncourt’s findings in this regard.\n\n        During his testimony at the post-conviction hearing, Converse did not address any of\nthe specific acts or omissions the Petitioner refers to in his briefs to this Court on these\nissues. Indeed, Converse was asked no questions during the post-conviction hearing about\nany of the jury instructions given in the Petitioner’s trial. With regard to the Petitioner’s\ndirect appeal, Converse testified that Brock Mehler, his co-counsel on the appeal, handled\nmost of the work, including the drafting of the amended motion for new trial. Converse\ntestified no further about the Petitioner’s direct appeal. Mehler did not testify at the post-\nconviction hearing. The Tennessee Supreme Court has made clear that, when a petitioner\nalleges ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, factors for consideration include (1)\nwhether appellate counsel testified at the post-conviction hearing “as to his appeal strategy\nand, if so, were the justifications reasonable?”; (2) whether the petitioner and appellate\ncounsel met and discussed possible issues; (3) whether the record establishes that appellate\ncounsel reviewed all of the relevant facts; and (4) whether appellate counsel’s decision to\nomit an issue was “an unreasonable one which only an incompetent attorney would adopt.”\n\n                                              -73-\n\fCarpenter, 126 S.W.3d at 888. The Petitioner failed to adduce proof at the post-conviction\nhearing on these factors. Accordingly, and once again despite his arguments to the contrary,\nthe Petitioner failed to prove any of the claims forming the basis of this issue on appeal. See\nGdongalay P. Berry, 2011 WL 5326280, at *8 (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel where petitioner did not question his attorneys about the claimed deficiencies,\nleaving the court to speculate as to their performance). Therefore, the Petitioner is entitled\nto no relief on his fifth and sixth issues.\n\n  II. Constitutional Errors at Trial and Constitutional Challenges to the Death Penalty\n\n        In his seventh, eighth, and ninth issues on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-\nconviction court erred in denying his various constitutional challenges to his trial in general\nand his death sentence in particular. Specifically, the Petitioner claims that: (1) Tennessee’s\nstatutorily mandated system of comparative proportionality review violates a capital\ndefendant’s right to due process of law in general and violated his right to due process of law\nas applied in his case; (2) his right to a fair trial was denied as a result of having only one\nattorney participate in individual voir dire in violation of the requirements of Rule 13, section\n3 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Tennessee; (3) his death sentence constitutes cruel\nand unusual punishment because it unconstitutionally impinges upon his fundamental right\nto life and because Tennessee’s available methods of execution by lethal injection and\nelectrocution are not consistent with the “evolving standards of decency that mark the\nprogress of a maturing society” from which the Eighth Amendment draws its meaning, Trop\nv. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion); and (4) the State engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct throughout the course of the trial.8\n\n        The post-conviction court denied all of the claims, except the claim involving the\nconstitutional challenge to proportionality review, on grounds that they were waived for post-\nconviction purposes in that they were not raised on direct appeal, were not based upon\nconstitutional rights not recognized at the time of the Petitioner’s trial, and were not claims\nthe Petitioner was prevented from raising due to state action in violation of the federal or\nstate constitutions. We agree with this conclusion. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-106(g).\n\n\n\n\n        8\n          The Petitioner also includes in this claim that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to object to\nimproper remarks by the prosecution during opening statements and closing arguments. The post-conviction\ncourt determined that the prosecution did make some improper comments, to which Trial Counsel did not\nobject. The post-conviction court concluded that Trial Counsel’s performance was deficient in this regard\nbut that the Petitioner had failed to establish prejudice. We agree with the post-conviction court’s\ndeterminations in this regard.\n                                                     -74-\n\f       The post-conviction court also denied the Petitioner’s constitutional challenge to\nproportionality review on grounds that it had been raised on direct appeal and, therefore, was\n“previously determined.” We also agree with this conclusion. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-\n30-106(h); see also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 631 (appx). The post-conviction court\nalternatively determined that the Petitioner’s cruel and unusual punishment claim and his\nchallenge to the constitutionality of proportionality review were without merit. We also\nagree with these conclusions as they are consistent with settled precedent. See Baze v. Rees,\n553 U.S. 35 (2008); Workman v. Bredesen, 486 F.3d 896, 905-09 (6th Cir. 2007); State v.\nKiser, 284 S.W.3d 227, 294 (Tenn. 2009) (appx); Abdur’Rahman v. Bredesen, 181 S.W.3d\n292, 306-09 (Tenn. 2005).\n\n                                    III. Cumulative Error\n\n        In his tenth issue on appeal, the Petitioner contends that he is entitled to relief from\nhis convictions and sentences due to cumulative error. However, there is no record citation\ncontained within the argument for this issue indicating that the Petitioner raised a cumulative\nerror claim below. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(A) (requiring argument to contain\n“citations to the authorities and appropriate references to the record”) (emphasis added). As\nsuch, even though the State does not argue waiver in response to this issue, we have\nconcluded that the issue is waived. See Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b) (“Issues which are not\nsupported by argument, citation to authorities, or appropriate references to the record will\nbe treated as waived in this court.” ) (Emphasis added); see also State v. Schaller, 975\nS.W.2d 313, 318 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997). Even if this Court chose to address the merits\nof the cumulative error claim, this Court would conclude that this issue is without merit.\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the post-conviction court denying the\nPetitioner’s initial and amended petitions for post-conviction relief challenging his\nconvictions and sentences arising out of the disappearance and murder of nine-year-old\nJacqueline Beard is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     _________________________________\n                                                     JEFFREY S.

The Petitioner received an effective\nsentence of forty-eight (48) years’ imprisonment for his non-capital offenses.

The State presented the following proof at the\nPetitioner’s trial:\n\n       On July 3, 1996, the victim, fourteen-year-old Carl Webber, and twelve-year-\n       old Jeremy Beard were playing outside the Beard children’s home when the\n       defendant approached them. The children had seen the defendant, who\n       identified himself as Tommy Robertson, drive by them earlier while they were\n       playing at a “mud hole” in Whitlow’s Hollow near the Beard children’s home.\n       The defendant offered to take the children swimming and told them he had\n       fireworks. He also told the children that he was an undercover police officer\n       and that he was looking for someone named Scott Hall. The defendant\n       appeared to be carrying a walkie-talkie, but it is unclear whether he ever\n       communicated via the walkie-talkie. The defendant left and the victim went\n       home to get her mother, Jeannie Meyer.\n\n               Jeannie Meyer returned to the “mud hole” with her daughter. Soon\n       thereafter, the defendant arrived with fireworks. The defendant told Ms.\n       Meyer that he was an undercover police officer named Thomas “Tommy”\n       Robertson. He said he was a partner of Allen Norfleet from the North\n       Precinct. He then commended Ms. Meyer on finding out who he was because\n       there are “a lot of sickos in the world.” He also advised Ms. Meyer that he\n       knew her mother-in-law, who owned a local restaurant, and her brother-in-law.\n       He inquired about taking the children swimming, and Ms. Meyer responded\n       that they were not allowed to go anywhere with anyone. Ms. Meyer then took\n       the children home, and the defendant left also. Thereafter, Ms. Meyer talked\n       to the children about strangers. At trial, Ms. Meyer testified that she told the\n       children that they should stay away from strangers, even if they thought they\n       might know them, and that they should never go near a vehicle occupied by a\n       stranger. She also told the children that people sometimes lie and are\n       untruthful about their identity and that some people carry fake police badges.\n\n             The following day, July 4, 1996, the defendant, his wife, Juanita\n       Rogers, and Mrs. Rogers’s granddaughter went to Land Between the Lakes for\n\n                                             -2-\n\fa picnic. While there, the defendant and Mrs. Rogers’ granddaughter went for\na walk. They walked a long distance down a dirt road near Dyer’s Creek.\nUpon returning from the walk, the defendant told his wife that “you could bury\na body back here and nobody would ever find it.”\n\n       At approximately 5:30 a.m. on July 8, Mrs. Rogers left for work at the\nBusy Bee restaurant, which was next door to the Rogers’ residence. Mrs.\nRogers saw her husband that morning and again before lunch. Thereafter, she\ndid not see him again until approximately 6:00 p.m. The defendant was\ndriving his wife’s white Chevrolet that day.\n\n        During the afternoon of July 8, 1996, at approximately 1:30 p.m., the\ndefendant appeared at the Meyer residence. He advised Ms. Meyer that he had\nlost his keys on July 3 and asked that they “keep an eye out” for the keys. Ms.\nMeyer responded that neither she nor the children would be in the area where\nthey had met earlier because she had a doctor’s appointment in approximately\nthirty minutes. He then told her that if they found the keys, she should call\nSergeant Brian Prentice with the county police and tell him they had found\nTommy’s keys. During the conversation, the victim and Jeremy came outside\nand stood on the porch where the adults were talking. After the conversation,\nMs. Meyer and her children went inside their home, and, according to Meyer,\nthe defendant walked down the hill in front of their home in the direction of\na nearby abandoned trailer.\n\n         Once the family was inside the home, the children began to watch\ntelevision. Soon thereafter, the victim began to ask her mother if she could go\noutside to pick blackberries to take to the doctor’s office. Ms. Meyer refused\nat first, but after more requests, she told her daughter she could go outside after\nchanging her clothes. The victim changed into a Minnie Mouse T-shirt with\nhot pink circles on the front, teal blue shorts, and a pair of new multi-colored\nleather woven sandals. Ms. Meyer told her daughter that they would be\nleaving in fifteen minutes for the doctor’s appointment and instructed her not\nto go looking for the lost keys. Ms. Meyer believed her daughter left around\n1:40 or 1:45 p.m. Ten to fifteen minutes later, Ms. Meyer went outside to get\nher to go to the doctor’s appointment. She looked for her and called for her,\nbut received no response. She and Jeremy drove to the area known as\nWhitlow’s Hollow, where they had met the man they thought was Tommy\nRobertson the week before. During their drive, they called out the victim’s\nname, but still received no response. They stopped and asked Joey Sauers,\nwhose mother and stepfather owned the property known as Whitlow’s Hollow,\n\n                                        -3-\n\fif he had seen the victim. He had not, nor had he seen a white vehicle in the\narea that day. Sauers estimated that it was approximately 2:00 p.m. when he\nmet Ms. Meyer looking for her daughter. Sauers’s mother and stepfather, Paul\nand Jackie Whitlow, began to help Ms. Meyer search for the victim. Ms.\nMeyer returned home to leave a note for her husband that they were out\nlooking for the victim. She then began knocking on the neighbors’ doors to\nsee if anyone had seen the victim or knew anyone named Thomas Robertson.\nOne neighbor, Mike Smith, saw a white vehicle with a black front end driving\nin the direction of Whitlow’s Hollow around noon or 1:00 p.m. on July 8. He\nsaw the same vehicle pass by his house again around 2:00 p.m.\n\n        During her search, Ms. Meyer saw what she believed were a set of\nfootprints up the side of a bank and down the road in front of the abandoned\ntrailer. She also saw a set of footprints that she believed looked like her\ndaughter’s near the “mud hole.” She returned home shortly after 3:00 p.m.\nHer husband was home at the time. She told him that the victim was missing\nand that the man who had identified himself as Tommy Robertson had been at\ntheir house earlier. Mr. Meyer told his wife to call 9-1-1, and he went\nsearching for the victim. The 9-1-1 call was made at 3:26 p.m. Law\nenforcement officers soon arrived, along with a K-9 unit, to search for the\nvictim.\n\n        At some point after 6:00 p.m., the defendant arrived home in muddy\npants. He told his wife he had been in a tobacco field on Dover Road.\nAccording to Mrs. Rogers, the defendant’s pants were muddy at the knees and\nlooked like they had been wiped off. Although his pants were muddy, Mrs.\nRogers noticed that his shoes were clean. She also noticed that there was a\nspot of blood on his shirt. When Mrs. Rogers questioned her husband about\nthe blood, he responded that he must have cut his finger. Mrs. Rogers had\nbeen waiting for her husband to come home because she needed her car to take\nher granddaughter to school. When she got in her car, she noticed small\nfingerprints on the passenger side windshield. Mrs. Rogers asked her husband\nif a small child had been in her car, which he denied. Mrs. Rogers explained\nthat the fingerprints or hand prints appeared to drag down the window. Mrs.\nRogers also noticed that although she had given her husband money to put\ngasoline in the car earlier that day, there was little gasoline in the car.\n\n       During the evening of July 8, Jeannie Meyer was interrogated by law\nenforcement about the disappearance of her daughter. At approximately 9:00\np.m., she went to the police station and gave a description of the man who had\n\n                                     -4-\n\fidentified himself as Tommy Robertson. Ms. Meyer acknowledged at trial that\nshe was initially a suspect in the disappearance of her daughter, which she\nbelieved was not unusual in the disappearance of children. She admitted that\nthe police report showed that her daughter disappeared around 1:00 p.m., but\nshe said the report was simply wrong. Ms. Meyer also admitted that the police\nhad questioned her about being involved in cocaine trafficking, and she\nsuspected that her phone lines were tapped following her daughter’s\ndisappearance. Ms. Meyer was not satisfied with the investigation conducted\nby the Montgomery County law enforcement officials. The family conducted\ntheir own investigation into the victim’s disappearance and brought in Billy\nHale with the National Missing Child Locate Center.\n\n        On July 9, 1996, the day following the victim’s disappearance, Mrs.\nRogers accompanied her husband to the garbage dump. Mrs. Rogers thought\nit was unusual that her husband took only one bag of trash all the way to the\ndump. According to Mrs. Rogers, the defendant took the bag of trash out of\nhis car and drove her white Chevrolet to the dump. En route, she noticed that\nher car had been cleaned from the day before, both inside and out, but the\ndefendant denied cleaning the car. He stated that the car was washed off by\nthe rain, to which Mrs. Rogers stated it could not have rained inside the car.\n\n        As a result of the official law enforcement investigation into the\nvictim’s disappearance, a composite drawing of the suspect in the victim’s\ndisappearance was printed in the newspaper. Sergeant Brian Prentice received\nthree telephone calls advising that the defendant resembled the man in the\ncomposite drawing. One of the phone calls came from Jerry Wayman. He\nsaid that he had sold the defendant a cellular telephone prior to July 8 and that\nhe and the defendant had discussed Wayman’s purchase of a scanner. Based\non the information from the telephone calls, Sergeant Cliff Smith attempted to\nlocate the defendant.\n\n        Sergeant Smith first located Mrs. Rogers, who told him that the\ndefendant was working at Midas Muffler. Sergeant Smith found the defendant\nat Midas Muffler and questioned him about his whereabouts the previous\nseveral days. The defendant told the officer that he had been to Paris Landing\nState Park on Saturday and Sunday July 6 and 7. He said he had been home\nall day Monday, July 8 with his wife. He denied that he had ever been to the\narea where the victim lived and disappeared. He later admitted that he had a\nfriend, Allen Norfleet, who was a sergeant with the Clarksville Police\nDepartment who lived in the area and that he had visited him about a month\n\n                                       -5-\n\fearlier. He denied possessing any fireworks. To corroborate his story of\nvisiting the lake, the defendant showed the officer some floats and an air\nmattress in his trunk. Sergeant Smith returned to the Rogers’s residence to\ndiscuss his investigation with Mrs. Rogers. At some point that morning, the\ndefendant called his wife. She asked him what was going on, and he told her\nthat two detectives had come to talk to him and wanted to search his car. She\nasked why they would want to do so, and he responded that he had no idea.\nDuring their conversation, she asked the defendant what he had told the\nofficers about his whereabouts on Monday, July 8. He told her that he had\nbeen with her the entire afternoon. When she disagreed with him, he stated\nshe must have her dates wrong.\n\n        Sergeant Smith returned to the defendant’s place of employment for\nfurther questioning. After talking briefly with the defendant, Sergeant Smith\nasked the defendant to accompany him to the police station. Although the\ndefendant was hesitant at first, he agreed. The defendant drove himself to the\nstation where he was questioned by Sergeant Smith, Steven Hooker, a special\nagent with the F.B.I., Bret Murray, a special agent with the F.B.I., Jeff Puckett,\na special agent with the T.B.I., and Billy Batson, an investigator with the\nMontgomery County Sheriff’s Office. Sergeant Smith presented the defendant\nwith three forms: a waiver of rights form (Miranda[ 2 ] form); a consent to\nsearch the defendant’s residence; and a consent to search the defendant’s\nvehicle. Smith read the defendant his Miranda rights, and the defendant signed\nall three forms at 11:18 a.m. on July 11, 1996.\n\n        Initially during the interview, the defendant admitted he had been in the\narea where the victim lived on the day of her disappearance, but he denied\nbeing involved in the disappearance. The defendant explained that he shot\nfireworks with three boys on July 3 in the Cumberland Heights area where the\nvictim lived. He stated that he lost a key to his shed during that time and that\nhe returned on July 8 to search for it. He admitted speaking with Jeannie\nMeyer and telling her to notify Allen Norfleet if she found the key. He denied\nthat the victim was present during that conversation. The defendant said he\nleft the Meyer residence and walked to an abandoned trailer because he had to\nuse the bathroom. He said he defecated on a curtain inside the trailer and\nthrew the curtain out the window. He said he drove to a waste management\nplant to inquire about employment but discovered that the help wanted sign\nhad been taken from the window. He said he went home and called his wife\n\n\n2\n    Miranda v.

He stated he was at home from\napproximately 3:30 to 4:00 p.m., when he left to drive around looking for\nwork. He said he returned home again around 5:45 p.m.\n\n        The defendant accompanied officers to his residence for a search of the\nhome. While there, the defendant agreed to submit to a polygraph test.\nFollowing the test, the defendant changed his story. He admitted that the\nvictim had been present when he spoke with Ms. Meyer on July 8. He stated\nthat after he left the trailer, he entered his car and smoked a cigarette. He said\nhe began to back up and leave when he felt a thud. He thought he had hit a\ntree, but when he got out of his car, he saw the victim underneath the car. He\nstated he did not know what to do. She had blood coming from her nose and\nwas having difficulty breathing. He found one of his old shirts in the trunk and\nused it to cover her head. He placed her in the passenger side of his car. The\ndefendant stated he drove to the bridge on Zinc Plant Road, saw there was no\ntraffic, stopped his car, and threw the victim’s body into the river. He said that\nthe victim was wearing multicolored sandals and that one of them had come\noff her foot. He grabbed the shoe and threw it also. He told the officers that\nhe had not seen her until he ran over her. He stated that he did not touch her\n“in any way sexually or abusive.” The defendant reduced this story to writing\nand signed the statement. He also signed a picture of the victim to verify that\nthe picture portrayed the person he struck. The defendant consented to a body\nsearch and was taken to the hospital where hair and blood samples were taken.\nThe defendant was placed under arrest, following which the defendant asked\nif he would be charged with vehicular homicide. The defendant called his\nwife, telling her he had confessed to vehicular homicide and would be home\nin a couple of hours.\n\n        The following day, July 12, 1996, the defendant was questioned by\nAgent Murray, who readvised him of his Miranda rights before the interview.\nThe defendant confirmed his statements of the previous day and gave a second\nwritten statement in which he admitted that the victim had been in the\npassenger seat of his vehicle on July 8. He stated that they talked for about\nfive minutes. He said she got out of his car because she said her mother had\nto go to the doctor. The defendant told Agent Murray that after the victim got\nout of his car, he ran over her.\n\n       Also on July 12, the defendant went with the investigators to the area\nwhere he said he had run over the victim. The defendant also showed\ninvestigators where he claimed to have thrown the victim’s body into the river.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fThe defendant reenacted the events of July 8 at the site visit. The defendant’s\ncourt-appointed attorney was present during the site visit.\n\n       In addition to the defendant being considered a suspect, the Meyers\nwere also initially considered suspects but were ruled out early in the\ninvestigation. Quinton Donaldson, a friend of the defendant, was also a\nsuspect. Donaldson drove a white Camaro and was in the Cumberland Heights\narea on the day of the victim’s disappearance. In fact, an officer spotted the\nCamaro parked at a residence a couple of miles away from the Meyer’s\nresidence and stopped and questioned Donaldson during the initial search for\nthe victim on July 8. Later, Donaldson gave a written statement to Agent\nPuckett in which he stated that he was the person who threw the victim’s body\ninto the river, but he ultimately recanted that statement, denying having any\ninvolvement in the victim’s disappearance.\n\n        During the search of the defendant’s white Chevrolet Celebrity,\nauthorities found a hand-held telescope, a cellular telephone power cord, and\na cigarette lighter cellular telephone charger. Later, when the vehicle was\nprocessed, they found Doral-brand cigarette butts in the ashtray and an empty\nDoral wrapper stuck over the visor. They also found a Motorola cellular\ntelephone, a can of glass cleaner, and a Tennessee map open to the Middle\nTennessee region, including the Land Between the Lakes area. A floor mat\nwas on the driver’s side of the vehicle but not on the passenger’s side. The\nvehicle was also searched for trace evidence, including glass, hair fibers, shoe\ntracks, and tire tracks. No fingerprints were found in the white Chevrolet that\nmatched either the defendant or the victim. The defendant’s 1984 blue\nOldsmobile was also vacuumed for fibers. The authorities also searched the\ndefendant’s residence where a scanner radio was found. Carpet fibers were\ntaken from the residence.\n\n        In addition to giving a statement to law enforcement officials, the\ndefendant spoke to several other people about his role in the victim’s\ndisappearance.     On July 14, 1996, the defendant’s mother, Cynthia\nSchexnayder, and his half-brother, Martin Schexnayder, traveled to Tennessee\nto meet with the defendant in jail. The defendant recounted the same story to\nhis mother that he had given the police in his written statement. He told her\nnot to worry because “all they could get him for was vehicular homicide.” He\ntold his half-brother that he had cut grass near a park and was leaving when he\nbacked over a little girl.\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f        David Ross testified that as a reporter for the Clarksville Leaf\nChronicle, he covered the victim’s disappearance and talked with investigators\nand the victim’s family. He said that in August 1996, he talked with the\ndefendant by telephone. The defendant told Mr. Ross that he told the police\nthat he had run over the victim in order for them to let him go home. The\ndefendant admitted to Mr. Ross that the victim had been in his car, but he said\nhe last saw her walking down the hill toward the woods. He denied knowing\nwhere the victim’s body was but “figured” it would be in the water\nsomewhere. He also said that he did not believe that the police were really\nlooking for her.\n\n      The defendant sent a letter addressed to Wilbur Meyer, Jeannie Meyer’s\nhusband, from jail. The letter read as follows:\n\n       Wilbur, don’t ask me why I am writing this letter because you\n       are just as hard-headed as T.B.I, F.B.I, and Montgomery County\n       police. I apologize for saying I did something I didn’t. I saw\n       them on T.V. accusing you and your wife of selling her for\n       drugs. That really pissed me and my wife off. I just had a\n       feeling that if she died, she would be in the river because of\n       dreams that I had and the configuration of the land. That’s why\n       I got on T.V. as soon as I did.\n\n       I am going to close this letter now, but if you will do a one-\n       hundred and eighty degree turn, you might find her. You are\n       wasting too much energy trying to blame me. I didn’t hurt her\n       in any way. I told the police over and over that that’s the last\n       time I saw her was in my rear view mirror by the mud hole.\n       When you do find her, you will see or she will tell you that I had\n       nothing to do with this. Sincerely, Glenn. P.S. Help me and I\n       will help you. See if you can get my wife to talk to me . . . Call\n       her and if she will talk to me, I will help you in any way that I\n       can.\n\n        He also placed several collect calls to the Meyer residence. The Meyers\ntestified that they spoke with the defendant, hoping to find the victim. The\ndefendant also left several messages for his wife in which he stated that if she\nwould talk to him, he would tell her what happened, tell her the truth. He also\nleft messages that he would tell her where the victim could be found.\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f        On November 8, 1996, Jerry Lee Brown and his son were scouting for\ndeer in the Land Between the Lakes area when they found a human skull.\nThey reported their finding to Leeman Lyons, an employee of the Forestry\nOpen Land and Wildlife. Mr. Lyons immediately called for a patrol car to go\nto the area where the skull had been found, and he also went to the area with\nthe Browns and TVA police officer Joe Bridges. The witnesses described the\narea where the skull was located as a densely wooded area approximately one-\nhalf mile from a logging road. Detective Billy Batson testified that the area in\nquestion was several hundred yards from the Cumberland River and was\napproximately 48.5 miles from the area where the victim disappeared.\n\n        TVA Investigator Greg Mathis took photographs of the crime scene\narea and found a pair of teal-colored shorts on November 8. The crime scene\nwas not processed, however, until the following day. During the search of the\narea, two sandals, a Minnie Mouse T-shirt that was turned inside out,\nadditional bones, two cigarette butts, an earring backing, a plastic tobacco\ncontainer, black plastic tape, and a hair mass were found. The tobacco\ncontainer, the Doral-brand cigarette butt, and the black tape were not found in\nthe immediate area of the remains. One cigarette butt was found near the\nskull, but it was unmarked and was older and more deteriorated than the Doral-\nbrand butt. The Doral-brand cigarette butt was found approximately one\nhundred to three hundred yards from the crime scene and was in better\ncondition, even having ashes on it.\n\n        Forensic anthropologist Dr. Murray K. Marks headed the testing of the\nskeletal remains. Dr. Marks arrived at the scene and discovered the remains\n“sandwiched between two layers of leaves,” the bottom layer from the year\nbefore and the top layer from the fall of 1996. The remains were scattered\naround the scene, which is common where a person dies in the woods and\nremains for a long period of time. Dr. Marks examined the skull and found\nthat the victim was between 7.4 and 8.7 years of age. The victim had both\nbaby and permanent teeth. The victim was a Caucasian, but he could not\ndetermine the victim’s gender. Dr. Marks concluded that the remains had been\nin the area between three and nine months. He examined the victim’s dental\nrecords from 1993, but could not make a positive identification from the\nrecords. At trial, Dr. Marks explained that the records were from 1993, and\nchildren change dramatically in three years. However, he could not rule out\nthe possibility that the remains were those of the victim. Jeannie Meyer\nidentified the shoes, T-shirt, and shorts found at the scene as her daughter’s\nclothing.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f              TBI forensic scientists examined the articles of clothing found at the\n      site, but fibers from the clothing could not be matched to fibers taken from the\n      defendant’s vehicle. TBI officials did, however, find the presence of semen\n      inside the crotch area of the shorts recovered from the site. Mark Squibb, a\n      serologist formerly with the TBI, testified at trial that he found fibers that he\n      believed were hair inside the shorts. A DNA profile could not be obtained\n      from the semen stains. Furthermore, DNA testing on the cigarette butt found\n      near the remains was inconclusive. A DNA profile was obtained from the\n      Doral-brand butt, and the defendant was excluded as a possible donor for that\n      butt.\n\n              Forensic serologist Meghan Clement tested teeth recovered from the\n      scene. Ms. Clement compared the DNA sequence derived from the teeth with\n      a blood standard submitted by Jeannie Meyer. Clement determined that there\n      was a maternal relationship between Ms. Meyer and the donor of the teeth. Dr.\n      Robert Lee, the Stewart County Medical Examiner, issued a death certificate\n      for the victim. He concluded that the cause of her death was unknown.\n\n             FBI scientist Max Michael Houck tested fiber samples vacuumed from\n      the defendant’s car and the defendant’s carpet at his residence and compared\n      them with fibers taken from the victim’s shorts. He identified light yellow\n      carpet fibers in the samples taken from the defendant’s car and residence that\n      “exhibited the same microscopic characteristics and optical properties” as\n      fibers taken from the victim’s shorts. Although he could not identify the\n      source of the fibers, the fibers appeared to have the same properties and\n      characteristics as samples taken from the living room carpet in the defendant’s\n      residence. Agent Houck testified that either the victim’s shorts had been in the\n      defendant’s living room, or the fibers had been transferred to the shorts\n      through contact. He explained that the fibers could have been transferred to\n      the defendant’s car via the defendant’s shoes or clothing and then transferred\n      to the victim’s shorts if she came into contact with the defendant’s car.\n      Additionally, FBI chemist Ronald Menold tested the fibers forwarded to him\n      by Agent Houck. He found the fibers from the victim’s shorts and the\n      vacuumings of the defendant’s car and residence to be consistent in polymeric\n      composition.\n\nState v.

She saw the composite drawing of the\n       suspect in the victim’s disappearance and called the police to advise that he\n       had been in the service station on July 8. She admitted on cross-examination\n       that she could not be one hundred percent sure that the defendant was the man\n       who came into the store that day. She testified that only one person responded\n       to their ad for employment. Robert Landon confirmed his wife’s account. He\n       testified that the man who visited the service station was wearing blue pants\n       and a mechanics shirt. He talked to the man for approximately twenty minutes.\n       He felt pretty sure that the man who came in looking for work was the\n       defendant. Once he realized that the defendant had been in the store, he called\n       Wilbur Meyer, the victim’s stepfather, who was a friend of his. Ms. Landon’s\n       father, Eddie Kingins, also testified that he was at the store between 3:30 and\n       4:00 p.m. on July 8, 1996, and saw the defendant in the store. He also testified\n       that the defendant was driving a blue four-door pickup truck. When he saw\n       the defendant on the news two or three days later, he called his daughter.\n\nRogers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1462649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at * 9. As part of his defense case, the Petitioner also “tried to\npoint out discrepancies and contradictions in the State’s evidence.” Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at\n601.\n\n        The State presented rebuttal testimony from Investigator Billy Batson who “testified\nthat the defendant had stated that he had worn blue jeans and a maroon and green tank top\nand tennis shoes on July 8, 1996.” Rogers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1462649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9. Batson also testified\nthat “[t]he defendant had never suggested to [him] that he stopped at the service station to\ninquire about employment” and that “there was no evidence that the defendant ever owned\nor used a blue pickup truck.” Id.\n\n        Based upon the evidence presented at trial, the jury convicted the Petitioner of first\ndegree premeditated murder, first degree felony murder in the perpetration of a kidnapping,\nfirst degree felony murder in the perpetration of a rape, especially aggravated kidnapping,\nrape of a child, and two counts of criminal impersonation. Id. at *10. The trial court merged\nthe two felony murder convictions into the premeditated murder conviction and entered a\nsingle judgment order of first degree murder. The trial court entered only one judgment of\nconviction for criminal impersonation, apparently because the two convictions were based\non alternative counts.\n\n                                             -12-\n\f       During the sentencing phase of the Petitioner’s trial, the State presented evidence\nestablishing that the Petitioner had been convicted, pursuant to guilty pleas entered on April\n12, 1991, of two counts of aggravated assault in Gwinnett County, Georgia, and that the\nstatutory elements of these prior offenses involved the use of violence to a person. See id.;\nsee also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 601. The State also presented the following victim impact\ntestimony from the victim’s mother:\n\n               Jeannie Meyer testified that she lost her job as a result of her daughter’s\n       disappearance and murder and has remained unemployed since that time.\n       Additionally, her husband had taken off from work to assist in the search for\n       her daughter. She testified that her two sons, Joshua and Jeremy, had\n       experienced severe psychological trauma as a result of their sister’s death.\n       Jeremy had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression,\n       and anxiety. He had also been confined to several mental hospitals, boys’\n       homes, and juvenile homes. Joshua, the oldest son, was very angry over his\n       sister’s death.\n\n               Ms. Meyer explained that she could not sleep for a long time following\n       her daughter’s disappearance and felt powerless to protect her children. In\n       addition to suffering from nightmares following her daughter’s disappearance,\n       she also felt very guilty and regretted letting her go outside. She testified that\n       her daughter was a friendly, happy, and well-liked child. Additionally, she\n       was also very talented. She could play the guitar, organ, and drums and sang\n       a solo in church every year.\n\nRogers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1462649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10; see also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 601.\n\n       The Petitioner’s mitigation proof at sentencing consisted of the following:\n\n              The defense called Mildred Denise Rogers to testify. Ms. Rogers is the\n       defendant’s sister. She testified that she was now known as Samuale “Sam”\n       Roger, but her legal name remained Mildred Denise Rogers. She explained\n       that she and her brother grew up in Louisiana and that she was two years old\n       when her parents divorced. Her mother remarried Danny Schexnayder. Ms.\n       Rogers was not fond of her stepfather, but the defendant was always nice to\n       him. The defendant tried to gain the attention of Schexnayder, but he ignored\n       the defendant. During the marriage, Schexnayder became demanding, and\n       their mother was only affectionate to them when Schexnayder was not around.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -13-\n\f        The Schexnayders had two children together, Danny, Jr. and Martin.\nThe defendant was not allowed to play with Danny, Jr. It was following\nDanny, Jr.’s birth that Schexnayder became “physical” with the Rogers\nchildren. Ms. Rogers witnessed Schexnayder pick up the defendant, spank\nhim, and drop him to the floor. At this time, the defendant was five or six\nyears old, and he started to withdraw. Schexnayder would also hit the\ndefendant in the face. Although Ms. Rogers would yell at Schexnayder for\nhitting the defendant, their mother never intervened.\n\n        When the defendant was nine or ten, he ran away from home.\nThereafter, his mother and stepfather would chain him to his bed. On one\noccasion, the defendant was chained to his bed for a couple of days. When the\ndefendant would wet the bed, Schexnayder would take the mattress out to the\nfront yard and push the defendant’s face into it. He would chide the defendant\nby telling him that they were going to let everyone know that he wet the bed.\nOn one occasion, Schexnayder made a sign saying the defendant had wet the\nbed and made him wear it for all the neighbors to see. The defendant also\nbegan to defecate in his pants, and Schexnayder would rub the pants in the\ndefendant’s face. Mildred Rogers testified that Schexnayder began to hit the\ndefendant with anything that was within reach. She recalled that the defendant\nwould often sit on his bed, holding his knees, and rock back and forth. When\nthe defendant was fifteen, Schexnayder beat him with a pole until the\ndefendant was bloody.\n\n        Ms. Rogers testified that after the Schexnayders had children together,\nshe no longer felt that she and the defendant were a part of the family. They\nwere often deprived of food and told they could not eat because their father\nhad not sent their child support check. She remembered that on one occasion\ntheir biological father tried to visit them, but when he arrived, their mother\ncalled the police, telling them that he had not paid his support payments. As\na result, they did not get to see their father. Schexnayder threatened to kill\nthem if they told their father anything. Ms. Rogers recalled that one Christmas\ntheir father sent her a drum set and the defendant a dirt bike. Shortly\nthereafter, Schexnayder broke the drum set and sold the defendant’s dirt bike.\nThe defendant soon began stealing motorcycles in the neighborhood.\n\n       Ms. Rogers testified that she was sexually abused by Schexnayder’s\nbrother, Kenneth. She did not know if the defendant was sexually abused also,\nbut he would hide under the house when Kenneth visited. Although their\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fmother took them for counseling once, she became angry and left when the\ntherapist suggested that she needed help.\n\n       Ms. Rogers began to steal and write bad checks once she left home.\nShe had attempted suicide on several occasions and was confined to a mental\nhospital. She had been diagnosed with multiple personality disorder and was\nreceiving treatment. She had also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder,\nmanic-depressive disorder, and borderline personality disorder. She had not\nbeen in any legal trouble for ten or twelve years at the time of her testimony.\n\n       Ms. Rogers testified that the defendant had gone AWOL from the Navy\nin 1980. During that time, he had a serious automobile accident. He received\nhead and eye injuries as a result of the accident. She acknowledged that\nalthough she had suffered an abusive upbringing, she had never murdered or\nraped a child.\n\n        Lazarus Rogers testified that he married the defendant’s mother,\nCynthia, when she was fifteen or sixteen and he was thirty-one or thirty-two.\nThey divorced in 1961 before the defendant was born. After the divorce,\nCynthia returned and told him she was pregnant with his child. They\nreconciled, and the defendant was born in March 1962. In September of that\nyear, they remarried. Cynthia later told him that the defendant was not his son.\nIn 1964, Cynthia left him again and took the children. In 1969, Cynthia asked\nhim for a divorce. At the time, she was living with a man she called her\nhusband and with whom she had two children. Although he had not paid child\nsupport, she had let him see the children until that time. Mr. Rogers testified\nthat the defendant called him on occasion and told him that his mother was not\ngood to him, but Mr. Rogers claimed not to know what was going on in the\nhouse.\n\n       Mr. Rogers testified that the defendant ran away to his house once. The\ndefendant told him that his stepfather tried to beat him with a coat hanger. He\nsaid that the defendant was very withdrawn and that he attempted to get a\npsychological evaluation on the defendant when he was 14.\n\n        Mr. Rogers testified that the defendant’s current wife was much older\nthan the defendant and that she was very dominant. He testified that he was\nin the restaurant on July 8 when the defendant came in. He recalled that the\ndefendant told his wife that he was going to a cabinet shop to look for work,\nand Mrs. Rogers became angry because she did not want him to go.\n\n                                      -15-\n\f        The defendant’s aunt, Peggy Ruth Page, testified that she never saw her\nsister, Cynthia, show any affection toward the defendant or his sister. She\nacknowledged that she knew there was child abuse in the Schexnayder home.\nShe further testified that on more than one occasion the defendant was chained\nto his bed. Although the defendant never told her so, she believed that he had\nbeen sexually abused.\n\n       The defendant’s cousin, Deborah Lynn Miller, testified that she was six\nyears older than the defendant. She confirmed that there was unequal\ntreatment of the Rogers children and the Schexnayder children. She testified\nthat the defendant’s stepfather often yelled at him and called him names.\nAlthough she had never witnessed abuse, she was later told that the children\nwere abused. She also testified that the defendant’s mother told her that she\ndid not love the defendant.\n\n        Two of Mildred Rogers’s friends testified. They corroborated the\nearlier witnesses’ testimony that the defendant and his sister were not given\nattention by the Schexnayders. One of the friends, Lynelle Meadows, testified\nthat she believed that both the defendant and Mildred Rogers had been\nsexually abused by their uncle Kenny.\n\n        The defendant’s elementary school principal, Victoria Meares, testified\nthat the defendant was a discipline problem. She testified that the defendant\nwould often bite other children and was called “Wolfie.” She referred the\ndefendant to a mental health clinic for counseling, but she did not know if he\never received counseling. She testified that the defendant was not able to\ninteract with other children in an appropriate way and lacked social skills.\nAlthough the defendant’s mother was nice, Ms. Meares did not believe that the\nparents gave her consistent, positive support in dealing with the defendant’s\nproblems. She never saw any signs of physical abuse, and the defendant never\nreported any abuse.\n\n       Thomas Neilson, Ph.D., a clinical psychologist, was retained by the\ndefense to evaluate the defendant. Dr. Neilson spent twenty-four hours\nexamining the defendant. He also interviewed the defendant’s sister and her\ntherapist and reviewed extensive records collected by the mitigation specialist.\nDr. Neilson testified that the defendant’s life had been very unstable. His\nparents divorced when he was very young, and he changed homes very often.\nHe lived in nine different homes the first ten years of his life and attended ten\nschools, including five elementary schools. He did not have a chance to form\n\n                                      -16-\n\ffriendships. As a result of the foregoing, he experienced feelings of insecurity\nand abandonment.\n\n        Dr. Neilson testified that the defendant performed poorly in school and\nreceived bad grades for conduct. He was suspended several times for his\nconduct, including biting and hitting. Dr. Neilson surmised that although he\nreceived some group therapy and speech therapy, the defendant changed\nschools so often that the school system never had a real opportunity to respond\nto his problems.\n\n        Dr. Neilson testified that the defendant suffered physical, sexual, and\nemotional abuse. Both the defendant and his sister reported being beaten by\ntheir stepfather. Moreover, the defendant’s mother did little to protect him\nfrom the abuse. Dr. Neilson testified that both the defendant and his sister\nfeared for their lives, which had a significant effect over time. The defendant\nreported that his stepfather beat him about the head with a baseball bat, and the\ndefendant’s sister said that she had seen the stepfather hold the defendant\nagainst the wall and cut off his air until he passed out. Dr. Neilson stated that\nthe police were called to the Schexnayder’s home forty times between 1972\nand 1979. According to Dr. Neilson, the police records indicated the\nSchexnayder home was a “very chaotic home environment.”\n\n       Dr. Neilson testified that the defendant said he and his sister were\ntreated much differently than their half-brothers. The defendant said that he\nwas often punished for the acts of his half-brothers and that he and his sister\nwent unfed on several occasions. The defendant stated that he was often\nchained to his bed and that he would howl out of frustration. As a result, he\nwas given the nickname “Wolf.” Dr. Neilson also said that the defendant\nbegan to steal motorcycles in the neighborhood after his stepfather sold the dirt\nbike that his father gave him.\n\n        Dr. Neilson testified that both the defendant and his sister reported\nbeing sexually abused by their uncle. The defendant also reported that he was\nsexually and physically abused by the staff at Louisiana Training Institute in\nthe late 1970s. The defendant further claimed to have been sexually abused\nby a man who gave him a ride after he ran away from home. The defendant’s\nsister also believed that the defendant was sexually abused by a babysitter and\nsomeone who lived in the neighborhood. As a result of these instances, the\ndefendant suffered trauma. Dr. Neilson testified that trauma can have a long-\nterm, permanent effect on the way the brain functions, which can cause mood\n\n                                      -17-\n\fswings, irritability, and anger. Dr. Neilson also testified that children tend to\nimitate learned behavior, including violence and abuse of children.\n\n       As a result of a psychological evaluation, Dr. Neilson diagnosed the\ndefendant with post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder NOS (“not\notherwise specified”), dissociative disorder NOS, and personality disorder\nNOS with antisocial and borderline features, also known as mixed personality\ndisorder. Based on letters the defendant wrote to his father when he was\nyoung, Dr. Neilson believed the defendant dissociated. The defendant signed\nthe letters “William Little” and stated in the letters that he had two\npersonalities – “Billy” and “William.” Although Dr. Neilson concluded that\nthe defendant dissociates, he doubted that he had “full blown dissociative\nidentity disorder.” Dr. Neilson assigned the defendant a GAF, global\nassessment of functioning, of fifty, which is severely impaired.\n\n        On cross-examination, Dr. Neilson acknowledged that this case was his\nfirst criminal forensic case. He also admitted that in preparing his report, he\nrelied upon a lot of information supplied by a capital mitigation specialist. Dr.\nNeilson did not personally interview the defendant’s mother, stepfather,\nsiblings or wife, but relied upon the mitigation specialist’s interviews of those\npeople.\n\n        Dr. Neilson acknowledged that the defendant had spent a total of eleven\nyears in prison during his adult life, excluding his current incarceration. The\ndefendant had been incarcerated in Florida, Mississippi, and Georgia. During\nhis incarceration in Mississippi, a report noted that the defendant’s separate\npersonality, “Billy,” was not “an integrated separate personality, but rather an\nimaginary companion who gets the blame for doing antisocial things.” Dr.\nNeilson admitted that he had never seen the defendant switch personalities.\nThe defendant advised him, however, that he had asked “Billy” if he knew\nanything about the crimes against the victim, and “Billy” denied any\ninvolvement. The defendant also told Dr. Neilson that he had not committed\nthe crimes against the victim and that he had been pressured into giving a false\nconfession. Although Dr. Neilson did not believe that the defendant’s\ndissociative disorder was directly related to the crimes against the victim, he\nsaid it indicated the severity of the defendant’s abuse and trauma.\n\n        Dr. Neilson testified that the defendant fell within the normal range of\nintellectual functioning, had no intercranial abnormalities, had logical and\ncoherent thought processes, and expressed no delusional or paranoid ideas.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f        Dr. Neilson admitted that the defendant’s MMPI test results suggested that the\n        defendant exaggerated his symptoms possibly due to a cry for help or\n        malingering. Dr. Neilson did not believe that the defendant malingered, and\n        he found the MMPI test results to be invalid. Dr. Neilson admitted that part\n        of the defendant’s depression could have resulted from his incarceration and\n        the charges pending against him. Dr. Neilson further admitted that Dr. Caruso\n        . . . had not diagnosed the defendant with any of the Axis I disorders that he\n        found.\n\n                The defense also called Dr. Cecile Guin, a school social worker\n        employed by Louisiana State University, to testify as an expert in the field of\n        social work and Louisiana’s conditions of confinement. Dr. Guin prepared the\n        response on behalf of the State of Louisiana to a federal investigation\n        regarding the treatment of children in state institutions. While the defendant\n        was at Louisiana Training Institute (LTI) in 1978, there was severe abuse of\n        the inmates. In fact, eight guards were terminated and three guards were\n        indicted for beating three juveniles. She testified that children were chained\n        to their beds, hit with belt buckles, hung on clothes-lines, and “popped” in the\n        ear. In addition to officer-inmate violence, there was also inmate-inmate\n        violence.\n\n                Dr. Guin testified that the Louisiana juvenile facilities were essentially\n        racially segregated in 1978 but that the defendant, a Caucasian, had been put\n        into the facility housing African-Americans with the most serious offenses.\n        The institution did not provide adequate counseling or treatment programs\n        during the time the defendant was there. The defendant told Dr. Guin that he\n        had watched other inmates be abused and that he was unable to sleep at night\n        because of fear. He told Dr. Guin that people had attempted to abuse him\n        sexually in the facility, but he denied ever being raped or sexually abused.\n\n               Dr. Guin admitted on cross-examination that the defendant was at LTI\n        for only eleven days before the beating of the three inmates, which spurred the\n        investigation into the facility. Following that time, the facility was watched\n        very closely.\n\n               Dr. Keith Caruso, a forensic psychiatrist, testified . . . [3 ] [that he]\n        interviewed the defendant, his sister, his father, his estranged wife, and his\n\n\n\n        3\n         In its opinion disposing of the Petitioner’s direct appeal, this Court erroneously identified Dr.\nCaruso as a State witness rather than a defense witness.\n                                                  -19-\n\fhigh school principal. He also reviewed the defendant’s prison records, school\nrecords, medical records, mental health records, military records, police\nreports, and witness statements. Dr. Caruso diagnosed the defendant with anti-\nsocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder. Dr. Caruso\ntestified that people with borderline personality disorder are sensitive to\nabandonment with a tendency to feel empty. He testified that the defendant\nfelt abandoned by his biological father and rejected when his sister left home.\nHe said the defendant felt rejected when his first marriage ended and feared his\nmarriage to Mrs. Rogers was in jeopardy. At the time of the crimes in this\ncase, the defendant was in an abandonment crisis. Not only was the defendant\nfearful of his marriage ending, he was fearful that he was going to lose the\nrenewed relationship he had built with his biological father. According to Dr.\nCaruso, Mrs. Rogers, the defendant’s current wife, was a mother figure to him.\nAt the time of the crimes, the defendant was symbolically being abandoned by\nboth his mother and father again. Dr. Caruso theorized that the murder of the\nvictim was a response to feeling so abandoned, which caused the defendant to\nact out in ways that had been modeled for him.\n\n       Dr. Caruso did not diagnose the defendant with post-traumatic stress\ndisorder because he did not exhibit all of the symptoms. Also, Dr. Caruso did\nnot believe that psychotic or dissociative symptoms played a role in the crimes\ncommitted in this case.\n\n         Dr. Mark Cunningham, a clinical and forensic psychologist, testified\nregarding a violence risk assessment he performed on the defendant. He\ntestified that if the defendant were sentenced to life imprisonment, he would\nbe a capital offender in the general prison population and would be a long term\ninmate. The defendant was thirty-seven years old, and his age would\nsubstantially reduce his risk level compared to other inmates. Further, the\ndefendant did not have a history of assaultive behavior while in prison, but he\ndid have a history of minor disciplinary problems. He also had a history of\nthreatening to retaliate against other inmates who threatened him. Dr.\nCunningham concluded that the defendant had an eight to seventeen percent\nchance of committing a violent act of a serious nature while in prison. He\nadmitted on cross-examination that the defendant would be a “significant risk”\nif left in the community. He agreed that if the defendant were in prison until\na very old age, he would not likely commit future violent crimes. Dr.\nCunningham also admitted that the defendant had previously escaped from\nprison, which he considered as a factor against the defendant. However, Dr.\nCunningham did not believe that the defendant’s prior prison escape, his prior\n\n                                      -20-\n\f       criminal record, or his history of incarceration was a good predictor of violent\n       conduct in prison.\n\nRogers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1462649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10-15; see also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 601-03.\n\n        The State presented rebuttal testimony at sentencing from the Petitioner’s current\nwife, Juanita Rogers, and his ex-wife, Lisa Sanders. Through the testimony of Juanita\nRogers, the State introduced a letter that the Petitioner had written to her while incarcerated\nprior to trial in which he “told her that he would not plead guilty to something that he had not\ndone and stated, ‘If I do get time, they will either kill me trying to escape or I’ll kill myself.’”\nRogers, 188 S.W.3d at 603. Juanita Rogers and Sanders also both testified that the Petitioner\nnever had mentioned to them that he had been physically or sexually abused as a child. Id.\nFinally, the State presented rebuttal testimony from its own mental health expert, Dr. William\nBernet, “who diagnosed the defendant with dissociative disorder, pedophilia, malingering,\nand anti-social disorder.” Rogers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1462649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16; see also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d\nat 604. The substance of Dr. Bernet’s testimony was as follows:\n\n       Dr. Bernet testified that he believed the defendant was malingering his\n       dissociative disorder in order to make it seem worse than it was. Dr. Bernet\n       did not believe that the defendant was under extreme mental or emotional\n       distress at the time of the crimes in this case, and he did not believe that a\n       connection existed between the defendant’s dissociative disorder and the\n       crimes committed against the victim. Dr. Bernet also stated that no direct\n       connection existed between the defendant’s difficult childhood and the crimes\n       against the victim. According to him, the two factors that played a role in the\n       defendant committing the crimes against the victim were the defendant’s anti-\n       social personality disorder and pedophilia.\n\nRogers, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1462649</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16.\n\n       Based upon the proof presented during the sentencing phase, the jury found that the\nfollowing four aggravating circumstances had been proven by the State beyond a reasonable\ndoubt: (1) that the murder was committed against a person less than twelve years of age and\nthe defendant was eighteen years of age or older; (2) that the defendant previously had been\nconvicted of one or more felonies, other than the present charge, whose statutory elements\ninvolved the use of violence to a person; (3) that the murder was committed for the purpose\nof avoiding, interfering with, or preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution of the defendant\nor another; and (4) that the murder was knowingly committed, solicited, directed, or aided\nby the defendant, while the defendant had a substantial role in committing or attempting to\ncommit, or was fleeing after having a substantial role in committing or attempting to commit,\n\n                                               -21-\n\fany rape or kidnapping.

Upon consideration of the pro se petition, the\npost-conviction court appointed the Office of the Post-Conviction Defender (OPCD) as\ncounsel of record for the Petitioner but later removed the OPCD as counsel based upon a\ndemonstrated, actual conflict of interest. After the post-conviction court appointed new\ncounsel for the Petitioner, an amended petition was filed on March 21, 2008.\n\n        Following the filing of the State’s answer to the petition and amended petition,\ncounsel for the Petitioner filed a motion for DNA testing asking that the post-conviction\ncourt order new forensic DNA analysis of the four (4) swatches of fabric cut from the shorts\nfound near the victim’s remains to determine if DNA could now be obtained from the semen\nstains and compared to the Petitioner’s DNA sequence. The post-conviction court granted\nthis motion and ordered that “Y-STR” DNA testing, which was not available at the time of\ntrial and which tests specifically for the presence of male DNA, be conducted on the clothing\nswatches to determine if the Petitioner’s DNA sequence was present.\n\n        A second amended petition for post-conviction relief was filed on May 26, 2009,\nraising the claims as framed and argued by counsel in this appeal. After the State filed its\nanswer to the second amended petition, the post-conviction court held an evidentiary hearing\non March 30 and 31, 2010. On the second day of the hearing, counsel for the Petitioner\nintroduced as an exhibit an order signed by the post-conviction court incorporating into the\nrecord of these post-conviction proceedings “the entire record on appeal” from the\nPetitioner’s direct appeal proceedings in both this Court and the supreme court. During the\nhearing, the Petitioner presented testimony from the following witnesses: Assistant District\nPublic Defender Charles Bloodworth, one of the attorneys who represented the Petitioner at\nthe trial level; Jerome Converse, lead counsel for the Petitioner at trial; Dr. Pamela Auble,\na forensic psychologist; and Meghan Clement, the forensic biologist with Laboratory\nCorporation of America (“Lab Corp.”) who testified as an expert for the State at the\nPetitioner’s trial and who later performed the Y-STR DNA testing ordered by the post-\n\n                                            -22-\n\fconviction court. The State presented testimony from the following witnesses at the hearing:\nAssistant District Public Defender Collier Goodlett, an attorney who initially represented the\nPetitioner prior to trial; Ronald L. Lax, the owner of Inquisitor, Inc., the private investigation\nfirm hired by Converse to investigate the Petitioner’s case for the defense prior to trial; Billy\nBatson, the lead investigator for the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department on the\nPetitioner’s case; and Mark Squibb, the forensic biologist who performed the initial\nserological analysis of the victim’s shorts when he worked for the Tennessee Bureau of\nInvestigation (TBI) crime lab prior to the Petitioner’s trial.\n\n        Charles Bloodworth testified that he had been an Assistant District Public Defender\nfor approximately twenty (20) years. He was appointed to represent the Petitioner in 1996,\nat around the time of the Petitioner’s arraignment. Bloodworth had never tried a capital case\nprior to this appointment and was not yet “capital-qualified.” Bloodworth testified that he\nrepresented the Petitioner “for about four or five months,” a period which included the initial\nphases of discovery. He met with the Petitioner several times at the jail and discussed with\nthe Petitioner the discovery provided by the State.\n\n        Bloodworth testified that he had some difficulty receiving discovery from the State\nin this case. He explained that “there was zero discovery furnished at arraignment, nothing\nbut a copy of the indictment,” and that “[i]t was at least thirty and probably more like forty-\nfive to sixty days before [the defense] received the first piece of paper from the District\nAttorney’s Office that could amount to discovery.” Bloodworth testified about the problems\nhe had with discovery during his representation of the Petitioner:\n\n               We had a series of discovery conferences but most of those consisted\n       of a meeting at the District Attorney’s Office where then District Attorney,\n       Lance Baker, would produce, for example, a cardboard box of photographs\n       and in the presence of a court reporter, one-by-one present me a photograph\n       and I would acknowledge receipt of it. It was not discovery in the sense of\n       here is a cardboard box full of evidence, we intend to present. Here’s witness\n       statements and so on. It was a very slow drawn out, one-by-one, page-by-\n       page, with the court reporter writing down what I was getting, [a] process of\n       stalling and delay.\n\nBloodworth later learned that the Petitioner had been making telephone calls from the jail to\nthe victim’s family. The District Attorney’s Office found out about the calls and “gave the\nfamily either a tape recorder or instructions on how to get a tape record” and “record [the\nPetitioner’s] telephone calls to the family.” Bloodworth testified that he later learned that\nthe Petitioner also had made at least one telephone call from the jail to the local newspaper.\nBloodworth stated that he believed the State “knew that eventually they were going to have\n\n                                              -23-\n\fto disclose” to defense counsel the Petitioner’s statements to the victim’s family and the local\nnewspaper and that, as soon as they did, defense counsel would “clamp down” on the\nPetitioner and “cut off his phone privileges.” Bloodworth testified that he believed “there\nwas a deliberate effort to delay letting [him] know that [the Petitioner] was making telephone\ncalls to the victim’s family and [that] those telephone calls were being recorded.”\nBloodworth stated that discovery by the State “was stalled out” to allow for the phone calls\nto continue as long as possible. He testified that describing the State’s “stalling tactics” with\nregard to discovery as being “prosecutorial misconduct” would be appropriate given that they\nwere dragging out discovery as long as possible in order to avoid informing defense counsel\nabout the Petitioner’s uncounseled and recorded telephone calls. Bloodworth testified that\nhe told the Petitioner during one of their last meetings not to make any more telephone calls\nto the newspaper or the victim’s family.\n\n       Bloodworth also testified on direct examination that, when it was apparent that\ndiscovery was not forthcoming, he filed a motion to dismiss the indictment. Bloodworth\nexplained:\n\n       One week I would go over and be given five pieces of paper. The next week\n       I would go over and be given twenty photographs of cigarette butts. What is\n       this for? Well, we’ll get to it later and so eventually I got frustrated and just\n       filed a motion to dismiss the indictment for failure to comply with discovery\n       and other things.\n\nHowever, Bloodworth testified that the State’s failure to provide discovery was only part of\nthe motivation behind the motion, the other being “a lack of speedy trial.” In the motion,\nfiled on June 17, 1997, and a copy of which was introduced into evidence at the post-\nconviction hearing, Bloodworth alleged under oath that the Petitioner had been arrested on\nJuly 12, 1996, that he had entered a plea of not guilty and demanded a speedy trial at his\narraignment on October 15, 1996, and that the State had since that time failed to comply with\ndefense counsel’s demands for discovery. Bloodworth recalled that, at the hearing on the\nmotion, the trial court treated it as a motion to dismiss the indictment based upon a speedy\ntrial violation. In the order denying the motion, a copy of which also was introduced into\nevidence at the post-conviction hearing, the trial court focused exclusively upon the alleged\nspeedy trial violation and determined that no such violation had occurred after analyzing the\nfactors set forth in Barker v. Wingo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), and adopted by the Tennessee\nSupreme Court in State v. Bishop, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2456151\"><a href=\"/opinion/2456151/state-v-bishop/\"><span class=\"volume\">493</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. 1973). The order denying the\nmotion to dismiss recites the following procedural history regarding the “broken series of\nhearings” held on the motion:\n\n\n\n\n                                              -24-\n\f              A hearing began on July 18, 1997 during which the parties moved to\n       close the proceedings due to what was characterized as highly prejudicial\n       material. No proof was presented during the closed session; however, defense\n       counsel, Charles S. Bloodworth[,] and assistant attorney general Lance Baker\n       made their respective arguments concerning the motions. Several media\n       sources filed motions to open the proceedings. On July 26, 1997, the Court\n       conducted a hearing on the closure motion and held that further proceedings\n       must remain open to the media. Further proof and argument were offered on\n       September 11, 1997.\n\n      When asked at the post-conviction hearing whether he intended the motion to be\nprimarily about a speedy trial violation, Bloodworth responded:\n\n       Clearly, the speedy trial in – it was stalling on the part of the State because the\n       body had not been found and I wanted to get to trial if I could, before the body\n       had been found. I said we can’t go to trial until we get discovery and check\n       out what you have, what evidence of death, if any, is there? [The Petitioner]\n       had made some inconsistent statements as to perhaps running over the child,\n       in the car, backing up on the hilltop. We went out and looked at the scene and\n       walked the area, so I was trying to bring the case to a conclusion within a – to\n       trial by a jury within six months or seven months of his arrest. Hopefully, to\n       be blunt about it, before the body was found and that did not happen.\n\nOn cross-examination, Bloodworth admitted that the Petitioner had given a statement early\non in the investigation to the effect that he had run over the victim, that there had been blood\ncoming out of her mouth and nose, and that while she was still breathing he threw her off a\nbridge into the Cumberland River. Bloodworth also admitted on cross-examination that the\ntime between the Petitioner’s arrest and the discovery of the victim’s body was “what would\nnormally be a short period of time in a homicide case” to prepare for trial.\n\n       Bloodworth testified that as soon as the victim’s body was discovered, and it was\napparent “the State was almost certainly going to file capital,” the State became more\nforthcoming in the discovery process. At that point, the State no longer required a court\nreporter to be there to record the delivery to defense counsel of each document of discovery.\nInstead, the State gave Bloodworth “bundles of paper” that he would then sign for. On cross-\nexamination, Bloodworth admitted that the discovery ultimately provided by the State\ncomprised “three or four or five cardboard boxes, so-called Banker’s boxes full of\ndocuments.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              -25-\n\f       Bloodworth testified that his representation of the Petitioner ceased at the direction\nof the District Public Defender because continuing the representation would have hampered\nBloodworth’s ability to represent other clients for which the Public Defender was court-\nappointed counsel. Because the District Public Defender knew Jerry Converse to be an\nexperienced attorney who had done capital cases, he pulled Bloodworth off the case and\nasked that Converse be appointed to represent the Petitioner. Converse was appointed and\nBloodworth thereupon ceased working on the case and turned his file over to Converse.\n\n       Jerry Converse, a Robertson County attorney, was appointed to represent the\nPetitioner in “late 1996 or early 1997.” At the time of the post-conviction hearing, Converse\nhad been licensed to practice law for “[a] little over twenty years.” He testified that, during\nthe time he represented the Petitioner, he did a lot of criminal work and that as he has gotten\nolder his practice has gradually focused more on civil litigation. Before being appointed to\nrepresent the Petitioner, Converse had handled “several murder trials,” including at least one\ncapital case that he could recall. However, he testified that he had never seen and was not\nfamiliar with the 1989 American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and\nPerformance in Death Penalty Cases at the time of the Petitioner’s trial, a copy of which was\nintroduced into evidence at the hearing. On cross-examination, Converse testified that he\nhad “never, ever worked on a case as hard as [he] did on this one,” and had not worked as\nhard on a case since.\n\n        Converse testified that he was co-counsel on the case for a time with Assistant District\nPublic Defender Charles Bloodworth. Converse became lead counsel upon his appointment\nbecause Bloodworth was not qualified to be lead counsel. Some time later Bloodworth\nwithdrew from the case and Larry Warner, a private attorney out of Crossville, was appointed\nas second-chair counsel.4 Warner stayed on the case as co-counsel through the conclusion\nof the trial. According to Converse, his knowledge of the case probably exceeded Warner’s\nsimply by virtue of the length of time Converse had been on the case relative to Warner.\nConverse and Warner hired the investigative firm of Inquisitor, Inc., owned by Ronald Lax,\nto provide assistance in the investigation for both the guilt and penalty phases. They also\nutilized the assistance of David Keefe and Kelly Gleason, who now works for the OCPD, to\n“bounc[e] ideas off,” and Converse testified that these individuals were a “big help” on the\ncase. In fact, Converse recalled that these attorneys actually drafted a motion for Converse’s\nsignature that was filed in the Petitioner’s case. However, Converse could not recall which\nmotion.\n\n        Converse testified that there was no clear division of labor between him and Warner\nprior to trial, but that as trial approached they decided that each attorney would handle certain\n\n\n       4\n           Larry Warner is now a judge for the General Sessions Court for Cumberland County.\n                                                  -26-\n\ftasks and examine certain witnesses. Converse explained that their division of labor “was\nnot kind of what was traditional at the time” in terms of one attorney handling the guilt phase\nand the other attorney handling the penalty phase. Instead, they “both worked on both\nphases.”\n\n        A copy of the indictment charging the Petitioner with the crimes for which he\nultimately was convicted in this case was introduced into evidence during Converse’s\ntestimony, as were copies of the certified fee claims from Converse and Warner submitted\nto the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) for their representation of the Petitioner.\nWhen shown copies of the certified fee claims, Converse admitted that the first date upon\nwhich he billed for any activity on the case was November 3, 1997. He also admitted that\nthe first date denoted in the billing records for a meeting between him and the Petitioner was\nMarch 13, 1998, at the jail facility in Montgomery County. However, Converse testified that\nthese records did not correspond to his recollection that he was involved in the case prior to\nNovember of 1997. Converse stated that he was “sure” that he met with the Petitioner before\nMarch of 1998 because it is his “custom to go see the client pretty quick after [he is]\nappointed.” However, Converse admitted that he had no “independent recollection” of the\ndate upon which he first met with the Petitioner. Converse stated that his practice at the time\nwas to try to record accurately all time he spent on a case for billing purposes, but that\nsometimes he would forget to write time entries down for a particular case if he was away\nfrom the office when working on that case. Converse testified, though, that a meeting with\nthe Petitioner would have been significant enough in terms of recording the time spent for\nit for him not to forget to bill for it. Converse testified that fairly early in the course of the\nrepresentation, after he first met with the Petitioner at the Montgomery County Jail, he had\nhim moved to the Robertson County Jail both to have easier access to the Petitioner and to\nkeep the Petitioner away from the media in Montgomery County.\n\n       Converse testified that he knew that the discovery process in the case “started out\nrather adversarial” between the prosecution and Bloodworth. However, after Converse\n“came on board,” he had “a good working relationship” with the State relative to the\ndiscovery process. He denied that the State withheld anything from the defense or acted in\nbad faith during discovery. In fact, “it was almost the opposite effect.” Converse explained:\n\n       It was very much open file . . . . I felt like they handed over everything. I\n       think he was so afraid that he would leave something out, he would just give\n       me everything, probably stuff I wasn’t even entitled to.\n\nConverse received “quite a few” photographs from the State, some of which were identified\nand introduced during his testimony at the post-conviction hearing. They consisted of\nphotographs of the “mud hole” discussed in the testimony presented at trial as well as\n\n                                              -27-\n\fphotographs of both the exteriors and interiors of the white Chevrolet Celebrity vehicle\nbelonging to the Petitioner and the inoperable blue Oldsmobile Omega belonging to the\nPetitioner. Converse explained that the Petitioner’s white Celebrity was similar to a white\ncar driven by Quinton Donaldson, the friend of the Petitioner’s who was considered a suspect\nby law enforcement early in the investigation of the case.\n\n       Converse recalled that Assistant District Public Defender Collier Goodlett had been\ninvolved in the Petitioner’s case as counsel around the time of the Petitioner’s arrest.\nGoodlett had gone “out to a bridge over the Cumberland River out here with [the Petitioner]\nand the police . . . for the purpose of [the Petitioner] showing the police where he had\nclaimed to have thrown the body of the victim off of the bridge.” Converse’s knowledge of\nthis event came from documents produced by the State during discovery. When asked\nwhether he ever talked to Goodlett about the bridge trip, Converse stated: “I’m sure I did way\nback then.”\n\n        Converse was asked to identify the motion to suppress signed and filed by him in the\nPetitioner’s case and a copy of said pleading was introduced into evidence at the hearing.\nHowever, he was asked no questions about the motion during his direct examination. On\ncross-examination, Converse stated that he did not believe the Petitioner’s initial statement\nto law enforcement – to the effect that he ran over the victim and then threw her in the\nCumberland River – was coerced. Converse also made clear on cross-examination that,\nduring their pretrial work on the case, the defense had referred the Petitioner’s initial\nstatements to Dr. Richard Ofshe, a sociologist from California whose research focused\nlargely on police interrogation techniques, to determine whether the Petitioner’s statements\nmight have been false and given solely for the purpose of garnering publicity. However,\nafter reviewing the statements, Dr. Ofshe could not conclude that the Petitioner’s statements\nwere false.\n\n        Converse also was asked during his direct examination to identify the motion to\nprohibit the death qualification of prospective jurors signed and filed by him in the\nPetitioner’s case, and a copy of that pleading was introduced into evidence at the hearing.\nHowever, Converse had no specific recollection of having drafted the motion and believed\nthat its substance came out of a capital case motions bank available to him at the time. He\nfurther testified that there was no particular reason why he filed it other than because it was\none of motions “that you are supposed to file in a capital case.”\n\n       Converse recalled that “this case stayed in the news for quite some time,” partly due\nto the State but also because the Petitioner himself kept it “in the media.” Converse\nexplained that he “had to get a gag order basically against my own client to keep him from\ntalking to the press” because that was something he “could not tolerate.” Converse also\n\n                                             -28-\n\ftestified that “the victim’s family kept it in the press quite a bit as well” but stated that he\nprobably would have done “the same thing in that situation.” Converse also testified that\nduring the same period of time the Petitioner’s case was in the news, there were two or three\nother cases involving the disappearance of little girls that the media would mention all\ntogether when something happened in one of the cases.\n\n        Converse recalled that the Petitioner’s trial occurred in January of 2000, and that it\nlasted approximately between two to two and a half weeks. The process of jury selection was\nthat a pool of prospective jurors was created through individual voir dire and then group voir\ndire followed. The juror questionnaires utilized in the case were prepared as a group effort\nby the prosecution and defense attorneys. Converse recalled reviewing those questionnaires\nupon their completion; however, he could not recall taking any notes as he reviewed the\nquestionnaires.\n\n        Converse testified that he was not involved in the individual voir dire process and that\nWarner primarily handled all jury selection issues with the assistance of a jury selection\nconsultant hired by the defense. In fact, when presented during his testimony with what were\nidentified as copies of the jury questionnaires completed by the twelve jurors who sat on the\nPetitioner’s case, Converse stated that he had no independent recollection of the documents.\nHe acknowledged that they appeared to be consistent with completed questionnaires in the\nPetitioner’s case. Converse also admitted that his fee claims from the Petitioner’s case\nincluded only two time entries associated with the jury questionnaires: for time spent making\ncopies of the questionnaires and for distributing some late questionnaires.\n\n        Converse testified that he did “not sit[] in during individual voir dire” and was not\ninvolved in any of the challenges that occurred at that stage of the jury selection process.\nConverse stated that he likely spoke to Warner regarding the progress of individual voir dire\nat the time, but that he could not recall any of the specifics of their conversations. When\nasked for the defense strategy on selecting jurors, Converse replied:\n\n              I don’t remember having any specific input on the type of jurors overall\n       that we were looking for. I think that that was something that I relied upon\n       Mr. Warner and the jury selection expert to do. I don’t recall that I was\n       involved in that aspect of it personally.\n\nConverse defended his deference to Warner by pointing out that Warner “had a pretty good\npedigree so to speak as far as capital cases in East Tennessee and Middle Tennessee,” that\nWarner “knew what he was doing,” and that Warner “wasn’t somebody right out of law\nschool or something to that effect.” Converse stated that he had never handled a capital voir\ndire in his career.\n\n                                              -29-\n\f        Converse conceded during his testimony that it might have raised “somewhat of a red\nflag” with him if he had known that some of the jurors seated in the case had indicated on\ntheir questionnaires that they automatically would impose a death sentence in a case\ninvolving the death of a child, particularly given that one of the aggravators noticed by the\nState in the Petitioner’s case was that the murder was committed against a person less than\ntwelve years of age by a defendant eighteen years of age or older. Converse further conceded\nthat asking prospective jurors about their ability to consider a defendant’s upbringing and\nmental health issues in determining the appropriate sentence would have been useful during\njury selection given the mitigation proof pursued by the defense in this case. However, when\nasked if he had any conversations with Warner about what kind of jurors they were looking\nfor with respect to the potential mitigation proof, Converse responded: “I don’t recall any\nspecific discussion, but I can’t say they didn’t occur. I don’t recall. I think they would have\noccurred, but I don’t recall specifically.”\n\n       Converse also did not recall being involved in the group voir dire portion of jury\nselection until he reviewed the transcript in preparation for the post-conviction hearing. In\nfact, when presented during his testimony with what were identified as copies of the\nperemptory challenge sheets from the Petitioner’s case, Converse stated that he could not\nconfirm that the documents were the challenge sheets because he could not recall having seen\nthe presented documents before. Converse identified the signature of Larry Warner on the\nchallenge sheets purporting to come from the defense. Converse also testified that he knew\nthat Warner had not exercised all of his available peremptory challenges. When asked\nwhether that presented a problem for appellate purposes, Converse stated that Warner “may\nhave been satisfied with the jury that he had at that point.” Converse explained:\n\n       I recall a conversation where he said he hadn’t used them all, but he was\n       satisfied with what he had as far as the jurors went and I remember saying\n       something to the effect of well, if you are satisfied, just because you use some\n       more challenges, doesn’t mean that you are going to end up with a better jury.\n       I mean, he could very well have gotten some people on there and run out of\n       challenges and not been able to get them off, so I don’t think we took the\n       approach that we had to use all the challenges. I do recall us having a\n       conversation about that, yes.\n\n        Converse admitted that the prosecution’s theory in this case was that the victim was\ntaken from her home in Montgomery County, that she was raped at some point, and that her\nremains were later found in Stewart County. When asked to describe the theory of defense\nat the guilt phase of the Petitioner’s trial, Converse responded:\n\n\n\n\n                                             -30-\n\f       The theory at the guilt/innocence phase was to hopefully create enough doubt\n       to keep Mr. Rogers from receiving the death penalty. In other words, I had a\n       pretty good idea a guilty verdict was coming. We had a dead eight-year old\n       child or nine-year old child and a fairly conservative area. We had all kinds\n       of circumstantial evidence and we had a defendant [who] was not very – I\n       thought would be very sympathetic to a jury. So I had an idea it was coming.\n       My thought was during the guilt/innocence phase to perhaps create enough\n       doubt that it would carry over to the sentencing phase, kind of lingering doubt\n       type of defense.\n\n       ....\n\n               Just looking at it realistically in my mind – there were some bad facts\n       in this case and numerous people that were involved in the case besides me,\n       other attorneys and stuff that I would consult – all saw it the same way, that I\n       mean – it was a case that would be very difficult to win on a guilty or not\n       guilty type of thing and we would throw the rape out altogether on the\n       abduction of the child from that particular area, obviously would be\n       kidnapping and the fact that the child was deceased almost automatically was\n       a felony murder. The circumstances of the case – were if he were found guilty,\n       there were two or three aggravators that kicked in right away on the capital\n       side, so I mean there – there was some pretty tough cards dealt to us on the\n       guilt phase. I mean – we did the best that we could with him under the\n       circumstances, but speaking just for myself and probably for Mr. Warner, we\n       probably had a pretty good idea that we were going to be pretty hot and heavy\n       into [the] sentencing phase afterwards.\n\nConverse testified the defense team considered the possibility of the Petitioner’s testifying\nat both phases of the trial but concluded that his testimony “would have been a disaster.”\nHowever, Converse could not recall why they reached that conclusion.\n\n       Converse testified that he did not believe at the time, nor has he ever thought, that the\nState presented sufficient evidence establishing that the victim was raped. Converse\nadmitted that the only proof presented by the State in support of the victim’s having been\nraped was the evidence concerning “semen or sperm” having been found on the victim’s\nshorts that were discovered in Stewart County. However, Converse stated that the State\nnever established at trial “who emitted that fluid.” Converse also conceded that the only\npossible proof of the rape occurring in Montgomery County was that the victim was wearing\nthe shorts that were found near her body while she was still in Montgomery County.\nConverse testified that he is “certain” he considered filing a motion to sever the rape charge\n\n                                              -31-\n\ffrom the remaining charges, but that he could not recall in his mind the specific strategy for\nnot doing so. On cross-examination, he stated that the facts underlying all the charges in this\ncase were “a series of events that started in one county and ended in another” and that his\nopinion was that venue “probably could have been in either” county.\n\n        Converse testified that members of the defense team drove the distance between\nwhere the victim was abducted near her home and the location where her remains were found\nand determined that it would have taken between forty-five minutes to an hour to make the\ntrip by car. Converse explained that they did this because the time and location given by\nEdra Landon, a defense witness at trial, about when she saw the Petitioner at a gas station on\nthe afternoon the victim disappeared was not consistent with the time it would have taken the\nPetitioner to abduct the victim and dump her body where it was later found. A memorandum\nprepared by an employee of Inquisitor, Inc. regarding Landon’s statement to the defense\ninvestigator that she had seen the Petitioner at 4:00 p.m. at the Phillips 66 gas station on\nRiverside Drive on the afternoon of July 8, 1996, was identified by Converse and introduced\ninto evidence at the hearing below. Converse stated that this memorandum was available to\ndefense counsel prior to trial. When asked whether there was time for a rape of the victim to\nhave occurred in Montgomery County based upon the timeline established by Landon’s\nstatement, Converse replied: “I guess it could have occurred in fifteen minutes.”\n\n        Upon being shown a 1996 article in a French Canadian forensic science journal\ndetailing the transfer of sperm on one article of clothing to other clothes washed together in\na washing machine, Converse testified that, had he known about the article, “it probably\nwould have been something we certainly would have considered using” because there were\nother males living in the household with the victim at the time of her death, including her\nolder brother, Jeremy Beard. When asked whether he recalled doing “any independent\nresearch” leading up to the Petitioner’s trial “on potential semen evidence” like that discussed\nin the Canadian article, Converse responded that he had, yet he admitted to not having found\nthe particular 1996 article presented to him at the hearing. Converse testified that, once the\nDNA test results came back as inconclusive regarding the Petitioner’s being linked to the\nsperm found in the victim’s shorts, he “wasn’t as concerned about [the sperm evidence] at\nthat point.” Converse also testified on cross-examination that he was not sure he “could have\ngotten a jury to swallow” the theory posited in the Canadian article regarding washing\nmachine sperm transfer.\n\n        Converse testified that he recalled talking to Meghan Clement prior to trial regarding\nthe forensic work she did on the case. However, he had no specific recollection of having\ntalked to Mark Squibb prior to trial regarding his forensic work on the case. When presented\nduring his testimony with what was identified as a copy of Squibb’s “bench notes” regarding\nthe forensic testing he performed on the case, Converse stated that he had no idea what the\n\n                                              -32-\n\fnotations “AP spray” or “p30” meant in the notes. Converse also recalled reviewing the\nreports from the FBI concerning that agency’s forensic testing of soil samples taken from the\nPetitioner’s car for comparison with soil samples taken from the area where the victim’s body\nwas found. Converse acknowledged that the results of the reports – i.e., that the soil samples\ndid not match – certainly did not hurt the Petitioner’s defense.\n\n       Converse also identified during his testimony various documents he had seen during\nhis preparations for the Petitioner’s trial, including: the written report prepared by Dr.\nMarks, the forensic anthropologist who testified at the Petitioner’s trial; the TBI request for\nforensic examination of the Petitioner’s 1987 white four-door Chevrolet Celebrity vehicle\nto determine whether blood, hair, fibers and fingerprints were present in the vehicle; the\nwritten report prepared by the TBI concerning the results of its microanalysis of hair and\ncarpet fibers; the written TBI report prepared by Mark Squibb concerning the results of his\nserological testing; and the written TBI report concerning the results of a polygraph\nexamination of Quinton Donaldson indicating that he had been deceptive when asked\nquestions in the fall of 1996 about the victim’s disappearance and death. However, Converse\nwas asked no further questions during his direct examination about any of these documents.\n\n       On cross-examination, Converse recalled that the sperm heads found by Squibb during\nhis analysis were located in the crotch area of the victim’s shorts. Converse also testified on\ncross-examination that there was a lot of information and evidence in the case that “never\neven made it into the trial” because the prosecution agreed early on to “just admit what [was]\nnecessary to get the job done and not bring in all of these other things that may or may not\ngive the [d]efense a basis to appeal.” For example, Converse explained that the defense hired\nan expert to look at the carpet fiber evidence. However, her analysis uncovered evidence not\nnoticed by the State’s experts “that would have been a shot to the head for us, . . . a killer\nshot.” He explained:\n\n               There was some question about the fibers from [the Petitioner’s] living\n       room floor carpet being consistent with some fibers found on the victim or the\n       victim’s clothing[.] And she said year – I remember her looking at that but\n       something that was – nobody else took any further than here, but there were\n       some stains on that particular fiber – grease or dirt or something on that same\n       fiber that matched up.\n\nConverse testified that, upon hearing this, he told the expert “thank you,” “[d]on’t write that\ndown,” and “have a nice day.”\n\n      Converse testified that part of the defense theory at trial was that the source of the\nsemen found in the victim’s shorts was possibly the victim’s older brother or Quinton\n\n                                             -33-\n\fDonaldson, a friend of the Petitioner’s who was considered a suspect by law enforcement\nearly in the investigation. Converse stated that, in order to support the possibility that the\nvictim’s older brother was the source, the defense attempted to get before the jury some\nDepartment of Children’s Services (DCS)/Department of Human Services (DHS) records in\nwhich there was a statement from Jeremy Beard “to the effect that his father – natural father,\nhad taught him – something about taught him how to have sex with his sister or something\nto that effect.” Converse testified that the statements were made “to some sort of case\nworker or something along that line.” Converse admitted that the defense tried to get these\nrecords introduced into evidence at the Petitioner’s trial, but that the trial court ruled that they\nwere inadmissible. Converse also testified that the trial court’s decision not to allow the\nrecords to be presented to the jury was raised as an issue in the Petitioner’s direct appeal.\nHowever, Converse admitted that there was a problem with the appellate issue because the\nrecords had never been made part of an offer of proof at trial.\n\n        Post-conviction counsel then introduced under seal through Converse excerpts from\nthe DCS/DHS record on Jeremy Beard that defense counsel attempted to have introduced\nduring the Petitioner’s trial. A review of these documents makes clear that they are from\ntreatment Beard received in 1997, after the victim’s death. These records contain statements\nfrom Jeannie Meyer, the victim’s and Jeremy’s mother, indicating that Jeremy Beard “was\nclose to his sister,” that Jeannie Meyer divorced the children’s biological father after “the\nDHS investigated physical abuse reported by the children,” and that Jeremy’s medical file\nindicated that his biological father taught him “how to have sex with his sister and that his\ndad watched while he had sex with his sister (who died 8 months ago).” The records contain\nthe following excerpts from a February 1997 psychological evaluation of Jeremy:\n\n       Jeremy maintained that he experiences guilt related to his sister’s death, “I\n       didn’t go over that day,” “I didn’t go with her” (he did not explain the actual\n       events that led up to his sister’s death, but he is apparently referring to him not\n       being with her and being unable to prevent the murder). He said that if he had\n       went with his sister, he could have possibly prevented her death, but when\n       asked how he could have done that, he replied “I don’t know.” As one might\n       expect, Jeremy is experiencing extensive difficulty trusting others and is\n       particularly suspicious of others’ motives.\n\n               Information contained within Jeremy’s medical file suggested that he\n       has allegedly sexually acted-out with his sister and others. Jeremy was asked\n       if he has ever sexually acted-out to which he responded (after a long pause),\n       “I don’t know.” . . . When asked if he ever sexually acted-out with Jackie\n       (sister), he said “No”; when asked if he can be trusted, he replied “Yeah.”\n\n\n\n                                               -34-\n\f       Jeremy was asked if he has experienced sexual abuse to which he answered\n       “No.”\n\nThe records also contain the following excerpts from a psychological evaluation of Jeremy\nin March of 1997:\n\n       According to Mrs. Meyer, Jeremy has disclosed to the family therapist, Vonda\n       St. Amant, that Mr. Beard taught Jeremy “how to have sex with his little sister,\n       Jackie.” It has not been determined if any inappropriate activity occurred\n       between Jeremy and Jackie, although it is suspected based on what Jeremy\n       disclosed. Mrs. Meyer continued to say that on one other occasion, Jeremy\n       told her his father physically and sexually abused him. Jeremy refuses to\n       discuss this issue any further when it is brought into the open.\n\n        Converse testified that Dr. Keith Caruso, the defense psychiatrist who testified at\nsentencing, was one of the witnesses “handled” primarily by attorney Warner at trial.\nConverse had no “independent recollection of Dr. Caruso at all in the sentencing hearing.”\nConverse also could not say what the defense team was “thinking at the time, one way or the\nother” regarding any particular reason why they chose Dr. Caruso to testify at sentencing.\nHowever, on cross-examination, after reviewing Dr. Caruso’s written report, Converse\ntestified that it was “certainly . . . very possible” that the defense put Dr. Caruso on the stand\nin order to get before the jury the following conclusions contained within his written report:\n\n       [A]t the time of the alleged offenses, the defendant was in a state of extreme\n       emotional disturbance brought on by his sensitivity to abandonment and his\n       fears that the two most significant persons in his life were on the verge of\n       rejecting him.\n\n              Should the jury determine that the defendant is guilty, it appears that his\n       crimes were committed in response to this extreme emotional disturbance. In\n       this scenario, it is likely that the defendant acted in a manner that had\n       previously been enacted on him: he victimized a child sexually and violently.\n\nConverse also testified on cross-examination that Dr. William Bernet had “brought up\npedophilia” as a possible motivating factor for the Petitioner’s crimes, a conclusion ruled out\nby Dr. Caruso’s statement in his report that “gratifying pedophilic desires with a child” failed\nto explain the Petitioner’s behavior at the time of the crime. Converse also recalled on cross-\nexamination that he remembered consulting with a neurologist to assist with the defense, but\nthat he could not recall whether they actually retained the services of such an expert for\npurposes of the trial.\n\n                                               -35-\n\f       Converse also recalled that the defense utilized Dr. Cecile Guin, a social worker\nemployed by Louisiana State University (LSU), who had researched the conditions of\nLouisiana’s juvenile justice facilities at the time the Petitioner was housed in such a facility.\nConverse remembered that there had been “some limitation” on Dr. Guin’s testimony in that\n“there was an objection on the State’s part that there was no proof [the Petitioner] had\nactually been exposed to some of the specific acts that Dr. [Guin] was attempting to testify\nto.” Converse testified that Dr. Guin was his responsibility primarily as a witness and that\nhe had made the decision to use her as a witness. However, he could not recall whether he\nquestioned her at trial.\n\n       Converse testified that he was co-counsel on the Petitioner’s direct appeal with Brock\nMehler, who handled most of the work on the case at that point. Converse testified that he\nprepared the initial motion for new trial, but Mehler primarily drafted the amended motion\nfor new trial. Converse described his involvement in the Petitioner’s direct appeal as\nfollows:\n\n       My involvement in the appeal was very – I mean, I was listed as co-counsel,\n       but that was Mr. [Mehler’s] specialty and I answered questions for him and\n       you know, helped fill in some of the blanks, things of that nature, but\n       primarily, he wrote the appeal and prepared for the appeal.\n\n        Dr. Pamela Auble, admitted as an expert in neuropsychology and clinical and general\npsychology, testified that, at post-conviction counsel’s request, she evaluated statements the\nPetitioner gave to law enforcement in order to determine whether his statement had been\ncoerced. She prepared a report, dated March 29, 2010, which was admitted into evidence.\nShe explained that, in conjunction with performing her evaluation, she reviewed “all the\nrecords that were relevant to the statement that were available,” interviewed the Petitioner,\nand administered some standardized testing to the Petitioner. She also reviewed some\nprevious testing and evaluations that had been performed by others. Her eventual\ndetermination was that his statement to the police “was coerced and unreliable.” As stated\nin her report,\n\n              From the test results that were obtained on this evaluation and on the\n       1998 evaluation, [the Petitioner] wants other people to see him as a good\n       person, tending to minimize his own personality flaws. He also tends to be\n       compliant with the demands of people in authority . . . . In addition, [the\n       Petitioner] suffers from chronic post-traumatic stress disorder from his horrific\n       childhood. In his childhood, he was trained to admit to wrongdoing by his\n       stepfather even though he had not committed the offenses because the\n       punishments would be even more severe if he did not “confess” to the\n\n                                              -36-\n\f       wrongdoing. A recent study . . . reported that people who have been exposed\n       to past traumatic experiences such as abuse or victimization are more likely to\n       give false statements during interrogation.\n\nAdditional factors that led to her conclusion included the “Reid technique” of interrogation\nthat was used on the Petitioner; his being told repeatedly by the polygraph administrator that\nhe was lying; the ten-hour period during which the interrogation was conducted; that the\nPetitioner “did not receive food and he apparently did not go to the bathroom” during the ten-\nhour period; and the Petitioner’s claim that law enforcement suggested to him “that he would\nbe charged with vehicular homicide instead of first-degree murder if he just said that he ran\nover this child and did not mean to.” As to the Reid interrogation technique, her report set\nforth the following:\n\n              The purpose of police interrogation is to elicit statements from\n       defendants that describe their role in the alleged offense. The Reid technique\n       is the most commonly employed strategy to accomplish this goal . . . . The\n       Reid technique can be reduced to three processes: 1. Isolation in an\n       interrogation room; 2. Confrontation or maximization in which the suspect is\n       accused of the crime, presented with evidence, and blocked from denial; 3.\n       Minimization in which the crime is morally justified and sympathy is feigned.\n\nDr. Auble testified that the Reid technique risks unreliable and untrustworthy statements.\nShe added that she had been available to conduct this evaluation during the time preceding\nthe Petitioner’s trial, but that she had not been contacted by the Petitioner’s lawyers.\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Auble acknowledged that she was aware that the defense\nhad contacted an expert prior to trial about the Petitioner’s statements and that the expert had\nconcluded that the Petitioner’s statements were not a “false confession.” She asserted,\nhowever, that “a false confession and a coerced confession are actually two different things”\nand that a coerced confession could be true but “makes you believe it is less trustworthy.”\nShe also testified on cross-examination that, in her opinion, the Petitioner “basically\nunderstood the Miranda warnings.” He, however, has “trouble with compliance with\nauthority . . . where he doesn’t really understand his right to remain silent.”\n\n       Meghan Clement testified that she worked for Lab Corp. as the technical director in\nthe forensic identity testing department. She was tendered and accepted without objection\nas an expert in serology and DNA forensics. Clement testified that she was originally\ncontacted by the State in this case in early 1998. She was provided with samples for testing,\nincluding stains from a pair of pants. She was provided with four pieces of fabric, designated\non the submittal form as “three semen stains and a possible semen stain.” DNA tests were\n\n                                              -37-\n\frequested on the samples. Only one of the samples produced a small amount of DNA, which\nwas not sufficient to compare to any known reference sample.\n\n       In December 1999, she received a request for mitochondrial DNA testing, a different\ntype of test. She stated, “we often had very good luck in getting mitochondrial DNA\nsequences where we couldn’t get nuclear DNA profiles.” However, the new testing did not\nproduce “any sequence information that could be compared to any known reference sample.”\n\n        In 2008, she received a request to do additional testing on the Petitioner’s behalf. This\ntest was the Y chromosome test, and it was performed on the extract that had originally been\nobtained from the fabric samples. The remaining extract had been frozen and was available\nfor further testing. The new testing resulted in a “zero quantitation.” The cloth samples were\nsubsequently returned to Lab Corp. They again tried to extract DNA and develop a Y\nchromosome profile but were unsuccessful.\n\n       In addition to trying to extract DNA from the cloth samples in 2009, Clement also\nperformed a “presumptive test for acid phosphatase as well as a test for the presence of P30,\nwhich is an antigen found in seminal fluid and those revealed negative results.” The\nlaboratory also examined the cloth samples microscopically, but did not find spermatazoa\npresent.\n\n        Clement also examined microscopically three slides that had been prepared by Mark\nSquibb in conjunction with trial preparation. Clement “determined that there were very few\nvisible sperm heads that were identified on the slides.”\n\n        When asked whether the presence of sperm necessarily implied the presence of semen,\nClement explained that tests had been performed demonstrating that sperm heads could be\ntransferred among items of clothing during a washing machine cycle. Accordingly, a finding\nof spermatazoa did not necessarily imply the presence of semen. Clement also explained that\na positive acid phosphatase test did not necessarily indicate the presence of semen. Rather,\na weak positive test could be caused by other factors.\n\n       The State called Collier Goodlett, who testified that he had been practicing law for\napproximately thirty years at the time of the hearing. He practiced with the Public\nDefender’s office in the nineteenth judicial district and also worked there at the time of the\nvictim’s disappearance. He began representing the Petitioner “either at the Sessions level or\nperhaps . . . shortly thereafter.” He accompanied the Petitioner to the scene where the\nPetitioner had claimed to have run over the victim and to the bridge from which the\nPetitioner initially claimed to have thrown the victim’s body. Also present were Agent\n\n\n\n                                              -38-\n\fMurray, Investigator Batson, the District Attorney, “and other officers.” Goodlett testified\nabout the visit:\n\n       I don’t recall any conversations that occurred out on the bridge. We ultimately\n       did go down to the area where [the victim] lived. As you drive up to it, there\n       was a trailer I think off to the left, that was where she lived. There was a sort\n       of muddy pond and then there was an area back off to the left as you approach,\n       where supposedly he had stopped or had been parked, I don’t recall? It is not\n       inconsistent with my practice that once a defendant begins to start talking in\n       my view far too much, that I will subtly tell them they need to be quiet. But\n       that’s basically all I recall. I don’t recall talking to any particular person out\n       there, other than being with the officers, sort of following them around.\n\nGoodlett explained that they visited the two scenes because the Petitioner “had wanted to go\nout there and basically demonstrate the events.” The Petitioner’s explanation to the State’s\nagents was consistent with what the Petitioner had told Goodlett. Goodlett added that, at this\npoint in his career, he would not have permitted his client to engage in that manner with the\nState.\n\n       On cross-examination, Goodlett acknowledged that the trip to the bridge occurred on\nthe same day that the Petitioner appeared in general sessions court. He stated that he would\nnot recommend that his client speak to police officers and that, in general, he wanted to\nreview discovery and ascertain the basis for the State’s case before making a\nrecommendation to his client about further proceedings. He also reiterated that, in retrospect,\n“I would not have ever let [the Petitioner] get in that car and go with them.” On redirect, he\nacknowledged that, regarding the scene visits, he did what the Petitioner wanted done.\n\n       The State also called Ronald R. Lax, who testified that he is a private investigator\nworking for the company Inquisitor. He was employed by attorney Warner to work on the\nPetitioner’s case prior to trial. In October 1999, he consulted with Dr. Richard Ofshe in\nCalifornia, a sociologist with expertise “in false confessions and in recovered memory.” The\nconsultation regarded the Petitioner’s statement. Following the consultation, the defense\nteam decided not to call Dr. Ofshe as a witness because his testimony would not have been\nhelpful.\n\n       Lax worked with five other Inquisitor employees in the investigation for the\nPetitioner. The bill for the company’s services was “about thirty-three thousand” dollars.\n\n       The State next called Billy Batson, an investigator with the Montgomery County\nSheriff’s Department, who testified that he was the lead investigator in the Petitioner’s case.\n\n                                             -39-\n\fHe denied that the Petitioner’s statements had been coerced and explained that the Petitioner\nhad requested the polygraph. No one in law enforcement suggested to the Petitioner that he\nmight have committed “just a vehicular homicide,” and no one suggested to the Petitioner\nthat he might have run over the victim accidentally. Rather, the Petitioner asked law\nenforcement if he was going to be charged with vehicular homicide after the polygraph.\n\n        On cross-examination, Investigator Batson explained that, when the Petitioner asked\nif he was going to be charged with vehicular homicide, the charges of first degree murder had\nalready been decided upon. In response to the Petitioner’s question, however, he was told\nthat the charges would be explained to him at a later time.\n\n        The State’s last witness was Mark Squibb, the laboratory supervisor for the trace and\nDNA sections of the Miami Valley Regional Crime Laboratory in Dayton, Ohio, and the\nDNA Technical Leader for the DNA section. Squibb testified that he was formerly a forensic\nDNA analyst at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (“TBI”) laboratory in Nashville,\nTennessee. While employed by the TBI, he performed the original laboratory work on the\nshorts found with the victim’s remains. He performed an “AP spray” test to the crotch of the\nshorts and obtained a “weak positive” result. He explained that the result was a “weak”\npositive because of the longer period of time it took for the testing substance to reach the\ncolor purple. He took four cuttings from the area testing “weak positive.” He examined\nextractions from the cuttings microscopically and found “rare sperm heads” on three of the\nsamples. Based on the weak positive AP (acid phosphatase) test and the sperm heads in the\ncrotch area of the shorts, he concluded that there was semen on the shorts.\n\n       Squibb acknowledged that there was also a lot of dirt, discoloration, and debris in the\nextractions. He also acknowledged that the AP spray test may result in a false positive and\nthat vaginal fluid can also produce a positive result. He further acknowledged being aware\nof studies “which pertain to the persistence of sperm as well as semen in washing.”\nNevertheless, he testified that he stood by his trial testimony.\n\n        On cross-examination, Squibb acknowledged that “rare” sperm heads meant that “very\nfew,” or less than ten, heads were found in the area being microscopically examined. He also\nacknowledged that he ran a P30 test on the shorts, which tests for an antigen produced by the\nmale prostate gland and which is present in semen.

The\nPetitioner alleges numerous deficiencies on Trial Counsel’s part during the jury selection\nprocess, which he summarizes in his brief to this Court as (1) failing to conduct an adequate\nvoir dire; (2) failing to object to the trial court’s voir dire process and juror excusals; (3)\nfailing to meaningfully exercise peremptory challenges; (4) failing to utilize both defense\nlawyers during voir dire; and (5) failing “to object, preserve, raise, and appeal the voir dire\nissues stated herein.” The post-conviction court determined that the Petitioner failed to carry\nhis burden of proving that he suffered prejudice as a result of Trial Counsel’s performance\nduring jury selection.

Accordingly, the court held, “questions to cull the jury for persons\nwho might be biased due to their past experiences with the criminal justice system are a\ncritical part of a competent voir dire in criminal cases,” and “the failure to ask the\nprospective jurors about their past experiences as victims or associates of victims is\nobjectively unreasonable.” Id. at 347-48 (citing Hughes, 258 F.3d at 460). Clearly, then, it\nis possible for defense counsel to be deemed deficient in their performance during voir dire\nbased on a failure to ask critical questions aimed at revealing bias against the defense,\n“absent a showing that counsel had a strategic reason for not asking the question.” Id. at 347.\nWe also note as significant, however, that the record in Smith reflected that, not only did the\npetitioner’s lawyer fail to ask these critical questions, but neither did the trial court or the\nprosecution. Id. at 346.\n\n        However, even if a petitioner is successful at demonstrating deficient performance\nduring voir dire, as was the petitioner in Smith, relief will not be granted unless the petitioner\nalso demonstrates “that the deficiency resulted in having a juror seated who was actually\nbiased.” Smith, 357 S.W.3d at 348 (citing James A.

Recently, considering a claim\nof ineffective assistance of counsel during jury selection, the United States Court of Appeals\nfor the Sixth Circuit clarified that\n\n               [b]ias may be actual or implied. Actual bias is bias in fact – the\n       existence of a state of mind that leads to an inference that the person will not\n       act with impartiality. The doctrine of presumed or implied, as opposed to\n       actual, bias provides that, in certain “extreme” or “exceptional” cases, courts\n       should employ a conclusive presumption that a juror is biased. We may\n       presume bias only where the relationship between a prospective juror and\n       some aspect of the litigation is such that it is highly unlikely that the average\n       person could remain impartial in his deliberations under the circumstances.\n       Examples of such a relationship are that the juror is an actual employee of the\n       prosecuting agency, that the juror is a close relative of one of the participants\n       in the trial or the criminal transaction, or that the juror was a witness or\n       somehow involved in the criminal transaction.\n\nTreesh v. Bagley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150480\"><a href=\"/opinion/150480/treesh-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">612</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 437 (6th Cir. 2010) (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                              -46-\n\f         The Smith court denied the petitioner’s claim for relief on the basis of trial counsel’s\ndeficient performance during jury selection because the petitioner had “introduced no\nevidence of actual bias or partiality.” Smith, 357 S.W.3d at 348. Indeed, the subject juror\nin the Smith case testified at the post-conviction hearing that he “recalled telling the trial\njudge in response to questioning that there was no reason he could not give [the petitioner]\na fair trial.” Id. The Tennessee Supreme Court categorically rejected the petitioner’s claim\nthat bias should be presumed under the circumstances, holding that it had “never presumed\nbias absent either an affirmative statement of bias, willful concealment of bias, or failure to\ndisclose information that would call into question the juror’s bias, and we decline to do so\nnow.” Id. Because the petitioner failed to adduce proof that his jury contained a biased\njuror, the court held that he was “not prejudiced by counsel’s failure to ask the . . .\nprospective jurors whether they or anyone close to them had ever been the victim of a crime,”\nand denied relief on this basis. Id. at 348-49.\n\n        In this case, the Petitioner adduced no testimony at the post-conviction hearing\nestablishing juror bias. The Petitioner attempts to rely on responses to the jury questionnaire,\nparticularly the response by some of his jurors that the death penalty “should be automatic\nfor anyone who is convicted of murdering a child.” The questionnaires were simply\npreliminary tools to foster appropriate voir dire, however, and were not designed as\nmechanisms to eliminate potential jurors solely on the basis of answers given without the\nbenefit of legal instruction from a trial judge. See State v. Sexton, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 392-95\n(Tenn. 2012). In Sexton, our supreme court recognized that excluding jurors on the basis of\na response to a single question in a jury questionnaire was “not permissible.” Id. at 392-93.\nInstead, “[p]rior to disqualification of a prospective juror, the trial court should develop a\nprocess designed to definitively ascertain whether the juror is predisposed to a certain result\n[in a capital sentencing trial] regardless of the law.” Id. at 393. And, in conjunction with\nimplementing such a process,\n\n       [o]nly a definitive answer that the prospective juror would either always vote\n       for the death penalty or never vote for the death penalty regardless of the\n       instructions of the trial court is the kind of predisposition which might\n       “prevent or substantially impair the performance of [their] duties” as jurors and\n       result in disqualification.\n\nId. (quoting Wainwright v. Witt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111303\"><a href=\"/opinion/111303/wainwright-v-witt/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">412</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424 (1985)). In sum, our supreme court has\ncautioned that,\n\n       eliminating prospective jurors based solely on an answer to one written\n       question may result in the exclusion of those who are entirely capable of\n       rendering a proper verdict, and, if a defendant is found guilty in a capital case,\n\n                                              -47-\n\f       imposing a sentence based on the law and the facts. Thus, trial courts must\n       consider all of a juror’s answers on a questionnaire, rather than giving just one\n       answer dispositive weight, and should permit counsel to examine prospective\n       jurors who provide inconsistent responses to pertinent questions.\n\nId. at 395.\n\n       Thus, absent other proof adduced at the post-conviction hearing, a petitioner claiming\na biased jury must rely upon the transcript of the voir dire. See Holder v. Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1309452\"><a href=\"/opinion/1309452/holder-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">588</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">328</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 339 (6th Cir. 2009) (where defendant is alleging ineffective assistance of counsel in jury\nselection, defendant “must show through a review of voir dire testimony that a ‘fair trial was\nimpossible’”) (quoting Ritchie v.

Our close\nreview of the voir dire in this case belies the Petitioner’s claim of a constitutionally infirm\njury.\n\n        First, although the Petitioner claims in his brief to this Court that Trial Counsel was\nineffective by failing “to adequately voir dire prospective jurors regarding their respective\nbeliefs on capital punishment and the impact of pretrial publicity,” the trial record reveals\nthat the trial court questioned each of the jurors individually about pretrial publicity and their\ncommitment to consider each of the three potential sentences should the Petitioner be found\nguilty of first degree murder. The prosecutor asked further questions of each juror\nindividually about their commitment to consider each of the three potential punishments upon\nconviction. Moreover, Trial Counsel also asked questions in these areas. Unlike defense\ncounsel in Smith, then, Trial Counsel in this case had adequate information upon which to\ndetermine whether further questioning was necessary on these points and whether to exercise\nchallenges on these bases.\n\n        Moreover, our review of the voir dire of each of the twelve jurors who decided the\nPetitioner’s case reflects that each juror met the constitutional standard of fairness and\nimpartiality, i.e., each could lay aside any prior opinion about the case he or she may have\nheld and render a verdict based on the evidence adduced in court.

While the Petitioner asserts that jurors Richardson, Brown, Shuffield, Spangenberger,\nBaggett, and Milliken had each “provided written or oral statements showing obvious bias\nregarding imposition of the death penalty and the impact of cases with child victims,” the\nrecord of the actual voir dire demonstrates that each of these jurors was ably rehabilitated\nthrough explanations of the relevant law applicable to the imposition of the death penalty in\nTennessee.\n\n       Richardson, who indicated on her jury questionnaire that she thought the death penalty\nshould be automatic for anyone convicted of murdering a child, told the trial court that she\nhad formed no opinion about guilt or punishment and that she could keep an open mind and\nbe fair to both the Petitioner and the State. She also stated that she would be open to\nconsidering all three of the possible punishments should the Petitioner be convicted. When\nthe prosecutor asked if she could set aside her earlier opinion that the death penalty should\nbe automatic for the murder of children on being told by the trial judge that that was not the\nlaw in Tennessee, she answered affirmatively. She reiterated that she could consider all three\npossible punishments.\n\n       Brown, who also indicated on the questionnaire her belief that the death penalty\nshould be automatic for the murder of children, likewise told the trial court that she had not\nformed an opinion about the case and would follow the law regarding the three possible\npenalties upon conviction of first degree murder. When the prosecutor explained that\nTennessee law did not provide for the death penalty solely on the basis that a child was\nmurdered, Brown stated that she would follow the law and consider all possible punishments.\n\n       Shuffield, who also indicated on the questionnaire his belief that the death penalty\nshould be automatic for the murder of children, told the prosecutor that he could set this\nopinion aside and follow the law requiring that all three possible punishments be considered.\nHe indicated to defense counsel that he would not automatically vote for the death penalty\njust because the victim was a child.\n\n       Spangenberger, who also indicated on the questionnaire his belief that the death\npenalty should be automatic for the murder of children, stated that he would follow the law\nrequiring that all three punishments be considered. He stated that he had not formed any\nopinion about the case and noted that there were circumstances in which each of the three\npunishments would be appropriate.\n\n      Baggett, who also indicated on the questionnaire his belief that the death penalty\nshould be automatic for the murder of children, stated during questioning that he would\napproach the case with an open mind and decide it solely on the evidence and the law. He\n\n\n\n                                             -49-\n\fasserted that he would consider all three possible punishments and that he would set aside\nany personal feelings and follow the law.\n\n       Milliken stated during voir dire that she thought a case in which a life had been taken\nshould carry the death penalty. After being told by the prosecutor that Tennessee law did not\nprovide for the automatic imposition of the death penalty upon a first degree murder\nconviction, Milliken stated that she understood and that she could follow the law. She\naffirmed that she could be fair and impartial.\n\n        Trial Counsel challenged none of these jurors for cause. Moreover, the trial court did\nnot excuse any of these jurors for cause on its own motion. See David Robert Ruderman v.\nRyan, No. CV-09-0887-PHX-GMS, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2757282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5 (D.

Obviously, neither Trial Counsel\nnor the trial court was concerned that any of these jurors was biased against the defense, and\nthe record before us does not demonstrate that any of these jurors was biased, either in fact\nor impliedly.

Nov. 15, 2011) (affirming trial court’s denial of post-conviction relief where\npetitioner claimed trial counsel was ineffective in failing to inform the jury during voir dire\nthat the petitioner’s youth was a statutory mitigating factor, in failing to discuss mitigation\nthemes of mental illness, psychology, and mental health experts, and in failing to question\nthe venirepersons about their beliefs on interracial dating and Satanism). The same result,\nfor the same reasons, applies in this case.\n\n       The Petitioner also makes numerous assertions regarding Trial Counsel’s performance\nduring voir dire with respect to venirepersons who were not eventually seated on the\nPetitioner’s jury. However, the obvious corollary to the prerequisite that a post-conviction\npetitioner alleging ineffective assistance of counsel during jury selection must prove that the\neventual jury was biased, is that the trial lawyer’s performance with respect to jurors who\nwere not ultimately seated on the jury is irrelevant.\n\n        Therefore, we emphasize that a post-conviction petitioner raising this issue must focus\nthe proof and argument on the jurors who actually sat and passed judgment on the petitioner.\nIn this case, the Petitioner makes numerous claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during\njury selection by pointing to Trial Counsel’s questions (or lack thereof) and/or challenges (or\nlack thereof) to venirepersons who eventually were eliminated from the jury pool. Trial\nCounsel’s voir dire and challenges as to these venirepersons are simply irrelevant to the\nPetitioner’s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. The Petitioner cannot prove that he\nwas judged by a constitutionally infirm jury by reference to persons who were not on the jury.\nAccordingly, we need not address the Petitioner’s specific claims in this case arising from\nTrial Counsel’s performance regarding potential jurors who did not actually sit in judgment\nof the Petitioner at trial.\n\n        The Petitioner also claims that Trial Counsel “wholly abandoned his role as an\nadvocate, and failed to act as an adversary during the voir dire process” such that this Court\nshould consider his performance ineffective per se. The Petitioner relies on United States\nv. Cronic, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111169\"><a href=\"/opinion/111169/united-states-v-cronic/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">648</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984), for this proposition. We, however, disagree that Cronic\nsupports his position. Cronic makes clear that there are exceptional circumstances “that are\nso likely to prejudice the accused” that a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\nis presumed. Id. at 658. Such exceptional circumstances include “the complete denial of\ncounsel” during “a critical stage of [the] trial,” id. at 659; the complete failure by counsel “to\n\n                                              -51-\n\fsubject the prosecution’s case to meaningful adversarial testing,” id.; the denial of the right\nto cross-examination, id.; and where “counsel labors under an actual conflict of interest,” id.\nat 662 n.31. The instant case does not present any such exceptional circumstances. Contrary\nto the Petitioner’s claims, Trial Counsel actively participated during voir dire, even to the\nextent of utilizing the services of a jury consultant. The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on\nthis basis.\n\n        To the extent that the Petitioner claims that Trial Counsel was ineffective because only\none of them participated in the jury selection process, allegedly in violation of Tennessee\nSupreme Court Rule 13, section 3, we agree with the State that the cited rule does not require\nthe participation of both attorneys in all decisions related to the representation. Rule 13,\nsection 3(b)(1) simply states that the trial court “shall appoint two attorneys to represent a\ndefendant at trial in a capital case.” Moreover, as noted earlier, post-conviction relief is\nwarranted only when a petitioner establishes that his or her “conviction or sentence is void\nor voidable because of the abridgment of any right guaranteed by the Constitution of\nTennessee or the Constitution of the United States.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-103. As\nsuch, any violation of Rule 13 arising from any failure on attorney Converse’s part to\nparticipate in the jury selection process would not entitle the Petitioner to post-conviction\nrelief.\n\n        Finally, we reject the Petitioner’s claim that Trial Counsel “were further ineffective\nin their failure to object, preserve, raise, and appeal the voir dire issues” set forth in his brief.\nWe have determined that the Petitioner suffered no prejudice from Trial Counsel’s\nperformance during jury selection because he has failed to demonstrate that a biased jury\nresulted. According to the Tennessee Supreme Court:\n\n               If a claim of ineffective assistance of [appellate] counsel is based on the\n       failure to raise a particular issue, . . . then the reviewing court must determine\n       the merits of the issue. Obviously, if an issue has no merit or is weak, then\n       appellate counsel’s performance will not be deficient if counsel fails to raise\n       it. Likewise, unless the omitted issue has some merit, the petitioner suffers no\n       prejudice from appellate counsel’s failure to raise this issue on appeal. When\n       an omitted issue is without merit, the petitioner cannot prevail on an\n       ineffective assistance of [appellate] counsel claim.\n\nCarpenter, 126 S.W.3d at 887-88 (citation omitted). We have determined that the\nPetitioner’s jury passed constitutional muster. An appeal on any of the issues raised by the\nPetitioner regarding jury selection would therefore have been fruitless.

Crim. App. July 5, 2007). Thus, the fact that the State did not call\nattorney Warner to the stand to explain his performance during jury selection does not accrue\nto the Petitioner’s benefit.\n\n        Nor do we agree with the Petitioner that this Court’s decision in Timothy Terell\nMcKinney v. State, No. W2006-02132-CCA-R3-PD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">796939</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tenn. Crim. App.\nMar. 9, 2010), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Aug. 25, 2010), supports his argument. In\nMcKinney, the capital post-conviction petitioner alleged ineffective assistance of counsel at\ntrial but was unable to adduce testimony from one of his trial lawyers at the post-conviction\nhearing because the trial lawyer was ill. See id. at *29. The petitioner nevertheless adduced\nproof through other sources that his trial lawyers failed to utilize significant and substantial\nevidence at trial that they “knew of or should have known of” and which was damaging to\nthe State’s case, thereby “fail[ing] to subject the prosecution’s case adequately to the\nadversarial process.” Id. at *36. Noting that the evidence against the petitioner at trial “was\nnot overwhelming,” id., this Court concluded that trial counsel’s demonstrated deficiencies\n“undermined confidence in the outcome of the trial.” Id. at 37. Therefore, this Court\ngranted relief. Id. at *56.\n\n       In McKinney, this Court determined that relief was appropriate based upon the\nextensive testimony presented at the post-conviction hearing from one of the petitioner’s trial\nattorneys, the owner of the private investigation firm and one of his employees who were\n\n                                               -53-\n\fhired by counsel to assist the defense, and numerous lay witnesses who testified at the post-\nconviction hearing but not at trial on the subject of whether others may have had motive for\nthe crime and whether the eyewitness descriptions of the perpetrator matched the petitioner.\nSee id. at *5-18. In fact, the attorney who testified at the post-conviction hearing in\nMcKinney stated that the defense theory in that case was that “the victim was shot and that\nthere was very little evidence as to who committed this crime, so the defense for the\n[defendant] was mistaken identity or that essentially that he was not the person who\ncommitted this crime.” Id. at *12. In other words, the combination of all the proof presented\nat the post-conviction hearing, including one of the defense lawyer’s testimony, negated the\npresumption that the identified deficiencies on counsel’s part were the result of trial strategy.\nWith regard to the claimed deficiency attributable only to the attorney who did not testify at\nthe post-conviction hearing in McKinney, this Court noted that no proof had been presented\n“as to the basis of [that attorney’s] decision,” and that, “[a]bsent such proof, this Court will\nnot conclude that counsel blindly refused to engage in the adversarial process.” Id. at *29.\nIn sum, McKinney clearly is distinguishable from this case and does not control the outcome\nof this post-conviction proceeding.\n\n        In his reply brief, the Petitioner reiterates this approach, arguing that his burden is\nlimited to proving “by clear and convincing evidence the fact of counsel’s alleged error” and\nthat the post-conviction court must thereupon determine whether the “alleged error” fell\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness. Notably, the rest of the Petitioner’s argument\nreveals his interpretation that, by simply proving that trial counsel committed or omitted\nsome action during trial preparations and/or at trial and by then labeling same an “error,” the\nburden then shifts to the State to demonstrate that the alleged “error” was reasonable trial\nstrategy. Again, this is not the law. A post-conviction petitioner must establish both that the\naction was taken (commission) or not (omission) and that the same was erroneous within the\ncontext of the proceeding. We acknowledge that a very few commissions or omissions by\ntrial counsel can be “objectively unreasonable” on their face. See, e.g., Smith, 357 S.W.3d\nat 347-48. Such errors are rare, however, and the Petitioner has identified no such errors\nduring the voir dire of his trial. Therefore, we hold that the post-conviction court committed\nno error in its application of the burden of proof in this case.\n\n        In summary, the Petitioner has failed to establish that any of the jurors who actually\nsat on his case were biased, partial, or incompetent. The record before this Court, including\nboth the record from the Petitioner’s trial and the record of the post-conviction proceeding,\nsimply does not establish that Trial Counsel’s performance during jury selection led to a\nconstitutionally infirm jury. Accordingly, we hold that the Petitioner has failed to establish\nthat Trial Counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel during jury selection, and he is\nentitled to no relief on this basis.\n\n\n\n                                              -54-\n\f                                   B. Pretrial Investigation\n\n        In his second issue on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nin denying his claims that Trial Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance with\nregard to their duty to conduct an adequate pretrial investigation concerning (1) the\ncircumstantial evidence of the Petitioner’s guilt and (2) the expert testimony they obtained\nfor use during their case for mitigation at the penalty phase. Specifically, the Petitioner\nalleges that Trial Counsel: (1) failed to investigate adequately the serological evidence\nobtained from the victim’s shorts in order to undermine the State’s position that the victim\nhad been raped at or near the time of her death; (2) failed to appreciate the exculpatory\nsignificance of the pretrial forensic report indicating that none of the soil recovered from the\nPetitioner’s cars or clothing matched soil samples recovered from the location where the\nvictim’s body was found; (3) failed to review adequately the pretrial forensic reports from\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) concerning the carpet fiber evidence and develop\ncrucial discrepancies in the evidence that would have undercut the State’s position at trial\nthat fibers consistent with carpet in the Petitioner’s house were found in his car and on the\nvictim’s shorts; (4) failed to investigate adequately the time it would have taken the Petitioner\nto travel the distances necessary to commit the crime and dispose of the victim’s body such\nthat an alibi defense would have been successful; (5) failed to investigate and obtain\nevidence indicating that the Petitioner was coerced into making his statements to law\nenforcement; and (6) failed to review adequately the report prepared by Dr. Keith Caruso and\nthe prejudicial effect Dr. Caruso’s testimony would have on their case for mitigation at\nsentencing.\n\n                          1. Investigation of Serological Evidence\n\n         The State’s proof at trial that the Petitioner raped the victim was entirely\ncircumstantial and based on Squibb’s testimony. Our review of the trial record reveals that\nSquibb’s entire testimony covers only thirty pages of transcript. On direct examination,\nSquibb explained that, when testing an item for the presence of semen, he first performed “an\ninitial test.” If this preliminary screening test yielded a positive result, he then performed “a\nconfirmatory test.” Squibb did not explain the background or details of either of these tests.\nWhen asked about testing the victim’s shorts for semen, Squibb testified that he “found that\nsemen was present on the shorts.” He clarified that three areas in the crotch portion of the\nshorts yielded “positive semen stains” while a fourth area “was inconclusive for semen.” He\nalso explained that, when he received the shorts, they “were very brittle and fell apart\neas[ily].” The following colloquy between the prosecutor and Squibb ensued:\n\n       Q: And in reviewing your – reports, you refer to semen fluid and sperm, is\n       there a difference between those?\n\n                                              -55-\n\f        A: Sperm is a component of semen fluid.\n\n        Q: Were both found on these shorts?\n\n        A: The presence of sperm indicates that semen was also present since sperm\n        is a component of semen.\n\nSquibb’s “reports” were not admitted into evidence.5 Squibb testified that he also tested the\nshorts for blood but his tests “failed to indicate the presence of blood.”\n\n       In addition to testing the victim’s shorts, Squibb tested the victim’s sandals and shirt\nfor blood and semen. The tests were “inconclusive for the presence of blood” and “failed to\nindicate the presence of semen.”\n\n       When asked on direct examination whether the semen on the shorts was human,\nSquibb responded, “I could not tell. It appeared to be human sperm; however, there are other\nspecies which are very close to it, but I did not see any difference between the sperm that I\nviewed as opposed to a human sperm.”\n\n        On cross-examination, Squibb stated that he did not attempt to generate a DNA profile\nfrom the semen stains on the shorts. He also explained the differences between the three\nareas of the shorts that he concluded contained semen stains and the fourth “inconclusive”\narea: “There was some possible sperm heads [in the fourth area], they were not what I would\ncall a ‘sperm head,’ so I left it as an inconclusive. The other [three areas], I had sperm head\npresent so I called it sperm and therefore, semen is present.” Squibb also acknowledged that\nhe tested the Petitioner’s white Chevrolet car for semen and blood and that the tests “failed\nto indicate the presence of blood and semen.”\n\n        On redirect, Squibb clarified that he tested the inside of the shorts. He also clarified\nthe difference between presumptive and confirmatory tests for semen:\n\n               The presumptive test is acid phosphatase, and that is like quick\n        screening of an exhibit to kind of concentrate on possible semen stains,\n        assuming there is a positive area. If it is negative, then no further testing will\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         Trial Exhibit 112, admitted during Squibb’s testimony, is a single sheet of paper containing\nhandwritten notes and two diagrams of a pair of shorts. Squibb referred to this document as “a copy of a\nwork sheet that [he] generated in the lab.” At the post-conviction hearing, a copy of Squibb’s “Official\nSerology Report” was admitted into evidence as an exhibit.\n                                                 -56-\n\f       be performed on the exhibit. But if I get a positive reaction, I can then come\n       in on that localized area and further test, do my confirmatory tests.\n\nSquibb added that, on the four areas of the shorts that he tested for semen, the presumptive\ntests were all positive. The confirmatory test was positive on only three of the four areas.\n\n        Squibb was not asked to describe what the “confirmatory test” consisted of or how it\nwas conducted. Nor was he asked any detailed questions about the science underlying any\nof the tests or the level of reliability associated with any of the tests.\n\n        Meghan Clement testified at trial that she tested the cuttings from the shorts for DNA\nbut was unable to obtain a sequence. Therefore, she was unable to compare any DNA on the\nshorts to the Petitioner’s DNA sample. She explained that there were four possible reasons\nfor the inability to obtain a DNA sequence: (1) the DNA was “too degraded”; (2) there was\nan insufficient quantity of DNA on the cuttings; (3) the samples contained “a mixture of\nmore than one DNA . . . so we couldn’t get a clean sequence”; and (4) there may have been\n“chemical inhibitors from environmental insults such as dirt.” On cross-examination,\nClement acknowledged that, if her inability to obtain a DNA sequence was due to a mixture\nof sources, it was possible that there were “two donors of semen.”\n\n       In denying relief on the Petitioner’s claim that Trial Counsel was ineffective in cross-\nexamining these witnesses and failing to adduce proof that the sperm heads found on the\nshorts could have been the result of laundering, the post-conviction court relied on the\nfollowing analysis:\n\n               The testimony of Ms. Clement and Mr. Squibb at the [post-conviction]\n       hearing reveals certain deficiencies in Mr. Warner’s cross-examination of\n       those witnesses at trial. Mr. Squibb’s testing produced evidence favorable to\n       the petitioner, but counsel did not present some of this evidence to the jury.\n       For instance, the jury did not hear there were very few (or “rare,” the term used\n       by the TBI lab to denote fewer than ten) sperm heads found on the microscopic\n       slides developed from the victim’s shorts. Mr. Squibb was also not asked\n       about his testing for semen in great detail; the jury heard no information about\n       the mechanics of the acid phosphatase test (color changes, timing, etc.) or that\n       Mr. Squibb’s acid phosphatase test yielded a “weak” positive result. The jury\n       heard nothing about the P30 antigen as it related to seminal fluid or that Mr.\n       Squibb’s testing yielded negative results for P30. The jury also did not hear\n       that very little DNA was derived from the stains taken from the victim’s shorts.\n       Perhaps most relevant, counsel for the petitioner did not present evidence\n       attacking Mr. Squibb’s conclusion that the presence of sperm cells necessarily\n\n                                             -57-\n\f       indicated the presence of semen. Given Ms. Clement’s testimony and the\n       publication of the washing machine study in the Canadian forensic journal –\n       an article published some four years before the trial in the instant case – such\n       evidence was available to counsel.\n\n              However, although counsel rendered deficient performance in not\n       presenting this evidence to the jury, this deficiency did not prejudice the\n       petitioner. Counsel were still able to present to the jury that the DNA and\n       serology evidence in this case was largely inconclusive. For instance, Mr.\n       Squibb testified that no blood was found in the victim’s shorts and that no\n       blood or semen were found on the victim’s shirt or inside the petitioner’s car.\n       Ms. Clement testified that no DNA sequence could be generated from the\n       victim’s shorts – thus, what little DNA evidence that existed could not be\n       connected conclusively to the petitioner. Mr. Squibb also testified that while\n       the sperm cells “appeared” to be human, he could not conclude that the sperm\n       cells were not animal in nature.\n\n               The petitioner’s attack on the evidence supporting the rape-related\n       offenses in this case was multi-faceted. Counsel argued that the petitioner did\n       not have enough time to commit the offenses, that there was no evidence that\n       he committed these offenses in Montgomery County, and that there was no\n       evidence conclusively establishing that he was the person who committed any\n       sexual offenses against the victim. Although the petitioner’s case could have\n       been strengthened by the inclusion of the scientific and technical evidence\n       produced at the [post-conviction] hearing, counsel still presented ample\n       evidence attacking the entirely circumstantial evidence regarding the rape-\n       related offenses. Despite this evidence, the jury still chose to convict the\n       petitioner; even if counsel had presented the additional evidence to the jury,\n       there is not a reasonable probability that the jury’s verdict in this case would\n       have been different.\n\nWe agree with the post-conviction court’s analysis. Certainly, Trial Counsel should have\ndone a more thorough job attacking Squibb’s testimony. However, the fact remains that\nSquibb found sperm heads on the fabric samples taken from the crotch area of the victim’s\nshorts. Clement agreed at the post-conviction hearing with Squibb’s finding of sperm heads.\nThe victim’s mother testified at trial that the victim had put the shorts on right before leaving\nher house and disappearing. While Clement’s testimony at the post-conviction hearing\nestablished that it is possible for sperm heads to arrive on clothing while being laundered in\na washing machine, she also testified that the experiments in which such transfer occurred\ninvolved washing new clothing with “a pair of underwear worn by someone who had\n\n                                              -58-\n\fconsensual relations.” Thus, proof of these experiments would not have been relevant at trial\nunless the defense had also been able to establish at least some probability that the victim’s\nshorts had been washed with an item containing semen. No such probability was established\nat the post-conviction hearing. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Trial Counsel’s\nperformance in his cross-examination of Squibb prejudiced the Petitioner.\n\n        In sum, Trial Counsel should have attacked the State’s proof regarding the\nsemen/sperm issue with more vigor. The Petitioner, however, has not established that the\njury’s verdicts are unreliable as a result of this failure because there has been no showing that\nthe defense would have been able to eliminate or completely discredit the State’s proof that\nsperm heads were found in the crotch area of the victim’s shorts. That proof, together with\nthe substantial proof at trial that the Petitioner was the last person to see the victim alive,\nleaves us confident in the jury’s verdict. Accordingly, the Petitioner is not entitled to relief\non this basis.\n\n       The Petitioner also asserts that Trial Counsel was ineffective in not challenging the\nadmissibility of the DNA testing and in not pursuing the theory that the DNA testing was\ninconclusive “because the substance was not human biological material.” This issue is\nwithout merit. As noted by the post-conviction court, “[t]he inconclusive nature of the DNA\nevidence went to the evidence’s weight, not its admissibility.” Moreover, Trial Counsel\nemphasized through Squibb the possibility that the sperm heads were not human. The\nPetitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                           2. Failure to Investigate Soil Evidence\n\n       The Petitioner claims that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to adduce\n“exculpatory soil evidence which excluded [him] as having been present at the crime scene\nat Land Between the Lakes where the [victim’s] remains were found.” This assertion is\nbased upon an FBI Report of Examination prepared by Bruce W. Hall on July 15, 1997, and\nwhich states, in toto, the following “Results of Examinations”:\n\n              Among the soil samples collected from where the victim was last seen,\n       specimens K1 through K5, specimen K3 is characteristic of soil recovered\n       from the subject’s vehicle, specimen Q1. Soil representing the road associated\n       with the body recovery site, specimen K15 through K18, although seeming\n       similar to the soil recovered from the subject’s vehicle, is dissimilar. Soil\n       recovered from the subject’s shirt, shoes and sandals, specimens Q13, Q14,\n       Q15 and Q27 respectively, is likewise dissimilar and cannot be associated with\n       any of the aforementioned known soil samples as well as those collected from\n       where the victim was found, specimens K12 through K14.\n\n                                              -59-\n\fAlthough this report is certainly intriguing, the Petitioner cannot ask either a post-conviction\ncourt or an appellate court to draw from it the conclusion that it excluded the Petitioner as\nthe person who deposited the victim’s body where it was found in Land Between the Lakes.\nThe Petitioner called no one at the post-conviction hearing to testify about this report or to\nexplain its conclusions and/or other data necessary for interpreting the significance of the\nresults.\n\n       Thus, again, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Trial\nCounsel’s “failure” to utilize this information at trial. As noted by the State in its brief to this\nCourt, the soil samples collected by law enforcement personnel from the Petitioner’s car were\ncollected after the car had been cleaned, according to the Petitioner’s wife’s testimony. The\nState therefore had a ready explanation had Trial Counsel elicited the lack of a match\nbetween the soil samples collected from the area in which the victim was found and the soil\nsamples collected from the Petitioner’s car. Also, absent proof that the Petitioner’s clothing\nfrom which additional soil samples were collected was the same unwashed clothing that the\nPetitioner was wearing during the afternoon of July 8, 1996, the lack of a match would have\nbeen irrelevant. In this regard, we note that a typed report by the FBI, made an exhibit to the\npost-conviction hearing, relates that, on July 11, 1996, during the search of the Petitioner’s\nresidence, the Petitioner’s wife “provided . . . clothing she believes was worn by [the\nPetitioner] on July 8, 1996. A red ‘Nike’ T-shirt was recovered from the dryer. [The\nPetitioner’s wife] advised the T-shirt had been washed and dried. [The Petitioner’s wife]\nprovided a pair of blue jeans from the washer. The blue jeans were still wet from being\nwashed.” Therefore, Trial Counsel’s “failure” to adduce the proof about the soil samples\ndoes not render the jury’s verdicts unreliable. The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this\nissue.\n\n                                       3. Fiber Evidence\n\n        The Petitioner contends that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to exploit\ndiscrepancies in some of the State’s proof regarding fibers found on the victim’s clothing and\nin the Petitioner’s cars and home. The Petitioner asserts in his brief to this Court that “[t]hese\ndiscrepancies were not utilized in cross-examination of any of the State’s witnesses, and the\njury was left with the State’s unchallenged yet dubious story of ‘fiber transfer’ which tied\n[the victim] to [the Petitioner’s] car.”\n\n        To the contrary, testimony by the State’s own witnesses during both direct and cross-\nexamination established discrepancies in the fiber evidence and created questions about the\nfiber transfer. TBI Agent Linda Littlejohn testified at trial that the fibers she found on the\nvictim’s clothing did not match the fibers from the carpet and seat standards taken from the\nPetitioner’s cars. FBI scientist Max Michael Houck testified that fibers found in vacuumings\n\n                                               -60-\n\ffrom the Petitioner’s two vehicles and on the victim’s shorts “exhibited the same microscopic\ncharacteristics and optical properties as the known fibers from the [Petitioner’s] living room\ncarpet.” Trial Counsel conducted a thorough cross-examination of Houck, eliciting\ntestimony that established that the fibers on the victim’s shorts could have resulted from a\ntransfer that involved neither the victim’s presence in the Petitioner’s living room or in either\nof his cars. Trial Counsel also attacked the reliability and validity of the asserted\nconsistencies by pointing out that the fibers from the Petitioner’s living room carpet were not\nobtained until mid-1997. Trial Counsel also obtained Houck’s admission that a fiber\nexamination “is not like a fingerprint or a six probe DNA match.” FBI chemist Ronald\nMenold testified that the fibers “were consistent with each other in polymeric composition\nand that that composition was consistent with polyethylene carasylate (phonetic), which is\na sub-class of a polyester fiber.” Trial Counsel also conducted a thorough cross-examination\nof this witness, eliciting, among other things, Menold’s admission that the FBI’s Handbook\nof Forensic Science stated that such consistency was “not positive evidence but good\ncircumstantial evidence.”\n\n       The Petitioner has failed to demonstrate how the absence of further attacks on the\nState’s fiber proof renders the jury’s verdicts unreliable. We note, in particular, that the\nPetitioner admitted to law enforcement officers that the victim had been in his car. The\nPetitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                      4. Alibi Evidence\n\n        The Petitioner claims that Trial Counsel performed inadequately in presenting proof\nthat it was physically impossible for him to have committed the crimes of which he was\nconvicted between the time that the victim disappeared and the time that witnesses saw him\nat the Phillips 66 on Riverside Drive in Clarksville. At the post-conviction hearing, the\nPetitioner adduced proof that it took two hours and forty-four minutes to travel from the\nvictim’s home to Land Between the Lakes, walk the distance to and from the area where the\nvictim’s body was found, and return to the Phillips 66. The proof at trial demonstrated that\nthe victim was kidnapped at approximately 1:40 p.m. and that, according to the defense\ntheory, the Petitioner was seen at 4:00 that same day at the Phillips 66: a period of only two\nhours and twenty minutes. The Petitioner asserts that Trial Counsel did not establish this\nsignificant time discrepancy at trial.\n\n       The post-conviction court denied relief because similar proof was adduced at trial\nthrough Investigator Batson and Trial Counsel utilized that proof to argue to the jury that\nthere was not sufficient time for the Petitioner to have committed the crimes. We agree with\nthe post-conviction court that Trial Counsel was not ineffective in this regard. This defense\ntheory depended upon the jury’s accepting the testimony of the alibi witnesses, testimony\n\n                                              -61-\n\fwhich the jury rejected, as was its prerogative. The State’s theory, based on the Petitioner’s\nwife’s testimony, was that the Petitioner was not seen back in Clarksville until 6:00 that\nevening, providing him with ample time to commit the crimes. The jury clearly accredited\nthe State’s theory over the Petitioner’s. Trial Counsel was not ineffective in this regard, and\nthe Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                 5. Psychological Evidence\n\n        The Petitioner contends that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to investigate and\nsubsequently adduce expert proof at the motion to suppress his statement that his statement\nwas coerced, involuntary, and unreliable. In support of this contention, the Petitioner points\nto Dr. Auble’s testimony at the post-conviction hearing, observing that Dr. Auble would have\nbeen available to evaluate the Petitioner and testify at the suppression hearing. The Petitioner\nasserts in his brief to this Court that, “[h]ad Dr. Auble’s testimony been presented, his\nstatement would have been suppressed[,]” “excluded . . . due to its extreme unreliability, or\nits impact on the jury would have been minimized by Dr. Auble’s testimony.” The post-\nconviction court ruled as follows on this issue:\n\n       [T]he substance of Dr. Auble’s [post-conviction] hearing testimony was that\n       the petitioner confessed to running over the victim with his car because the\n       police led him to believe that he would be charged with a lesser offense (i.e.,\n       vehicular homicide as opposed to first degree murder) if he confessed to\n       running over the victim with his car. However, this assertion is inconsistent\n       with the testimony from the suppression hearing, and at the [post-conviction]\n       hearing Mr. Batson testified that the police did not induce the petitioner to\n       confess by promising he would be charged with a lesser offense. Rather, Mr.\n       Batson testified that as the police took the petitioner back to the criminal\n       justice center after visiting the hospital, the petitioner asked, without\n       prompting, “Will I be charged with vehicular homicide?” Mr. Batson testified\n       that he then told the petitioner that he would explain the charges to [him]. Mr.\n       Batson also said that before this statement, none of the law enforcement agents\n       suggested that the petitioner had run over the victim with his car.\n\n              In light of the evidence, the court concludes that to any extent that\n       counsel may have been ineffective for not arguing that the petitioner’s\n       statement was coerced or otherwise involuntary, and for not presenting expert\n       witness testimony in support of this assertion, such actions did not prejudice\n       the petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n                                              -62-\n\fIn essence, the post-conviction court made a finding of credibility in favor of Investigator\nBatson and against Dr. Auble. The evidence does not preponderate against this finding.\nTherefore, we may not overturn it. See Wallace v.

Crim. App. May 20, 2011), perm. app. denied (Tenn. Sept. 21, 2011) (recognizing that\nthis Court “is not at liberty to reevaluate matters of witness credibility unless the evidence\npreponderates against the trial court’s findings”). The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on\nthis basis.\n\n                                6. Mitigation Expert’s Report\n\n        Finally, the Petitioner contends that Trial Counsel “failed to adequately investigate\nits own expert’s opinion, resulting in the introduction of evidence which supported the\nState’s case for the death penalty.” The Petitioner refers to Dr. Keith Caruso’s testimony and\nreport presented by the defense during the sentencing phase of his trial, particularly Dr.\nCaruso’s testimony, “I think [the Petitioner] hasn’t been able to admit to himself that he did\nthese things yet, so it is difficult to say whether or not – I don’t see that he entirely lacks\nremorse. I don’t see him as being very far long [sic] in the pattern of remorse or feeling sorry\nfor what he has done yet.” The Petitioner argues that Dr. Caruso impliedly endorsed the\njury’s finding of guilt, “thereby crippling any residual doubt argument as a mitigating factor.”\nHe asserts, “Surely it cannot be disputed that a careful reading of Dr. Caruso’s report,\nparticularly in light of the far more favorable report of Dr. Neilson . . . , would cause a lawyer\nexercising reasonable professional judgment to decline to present Dr. Caruso as an expert.”\n\n        To prove the prejudice prong of ineffective assistance of counsel during the capital\nsentencing phase of the petitioner’s trial, the petitioner must establish that “there is a\nreasonable probability that, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that\nthe balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.” Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 695. In determining whether defense counsel was ineffective in its investigation\nof and/or presentation of mitigating evidence, the reviewing court must “analyze[] the nature\nand extent of the mitigating evidence that was available but not presented,” determine\n“whether substantially similar mitigating evidence was presented to the jury during either the\nguilt or penalty phase of the proceedings,” and consider “whether there was such strong\nevidence of aggravating factors that the mitigating evidence would not have affected the\njury’s determination.” Goad, 938 S.W.2d at 371. When the petitioner argues, as here, that\nprejudicial “mitigation” evidence was presented, we construe the first of these factors as\nreferring to the nature and extent of the allegedly prejudicial evidence presented and the third\nfactor as referring to whether the evidence of the applicable aggravating factors was so\nstrong that the absence of the allegedly prejudicial mitigating evidence would not have\naffected the jury’s verdict.\n\n                                              -63-\n\f        After reviewing the trial testimony of both Dr. Caruso and Dr. Neilson, who also\ntestified in mitigation for the Petitioner at trial, the post-conviction court found that\n\n       Dr. Caruso’s assessment of the petitioner [was not] significantly less favorable\n       to the petitioner than Dr. Neilson’s assessment. Although Dr. Caruso did not\n       diagnose the petitioner with the same (or as many) disorders as did Dr.\n       Neilson, Dr. Caruso testified that the petitioner’ actions were affected by –\n       although if not caused by – the extreme emotional distress resulting from the\n       petitioner’s upbringing.\n\n               Furthermore, the evidence of the four aggravating circumstances was\n       substantial, so even if Dr. Caruso’s testimony had not been presented to the\n       jury, Dr. Neilson’s testimony, standing alone, would not have affected the\n       jury’s sentencing decision.\n\nWe agree with the post-conviction court on this issue. Moreover, while the Petitioner has\ncouched this contention in terms of inadequate investigation, the real thrust of his complaint\nis that Trial Counsel made a poor tactical decision in calling Dr. Caruso to testify. The\nrecord, however, does not support the conclusion that Trial Counsel’s strategic choice in this\nregard fell so far below the level of reasonable performance as to constitute deficient\nperformance. For instance, we note that Converse testified that one of the reasons the\ndefense called Dr. Caruso was to counteract the State’s claim that the Petitioner suffered\nfrom pedophilia. The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                      C. Pretrial Motions\n\n        In his third issue on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nin denying his claims that Trial Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance with\nregard to the filing of certain necessary pretrial motions. Specifically, the Petitioner alleges\nthat Trial Counsel: (1) failed to support adequately with proper citation to legal authority or\nevidence the motion to dismiss, which was construed by the trial court as a motion to dismiss\nbased upon a violation of the Petitioner’s right to a speedy trial; (2) failed to assert adequately\nas a basis for the motion to dismiss the prosecutorial misconduct by the State in not providing\ndiscovery to the defense in a timely fashion; (3) failed to file a motion for a bill of particulars\nasking the State to provide the date, time and location of each offense alleged in the\nindictment; (4) failed to file a pretrial motion seeking exclusion of testimony from the\nPetitioner’s wife, Juanita Rogers, concerning certain privileged marital communications; (5)\nfailed to present a constitutionally adequate motion to suppress the Petitioner’s statements\nto law enforcement; (6) failed to challenge Montgomery County as the proper venue for the\n\n\n\n                                               -64-\n\fhomicide and rape charges; and (7) failed to seek severance of the rape of a child offense\nfrom the remaining counts charged in the indictment.\n\n        The post-conviction court denied the claims related to Trial Counsel’s failure to file\na motion for a bill of particulars and failure to file a pretrial motion seeking exclusion of the\nPetitioner’s wife’s testimony at trial on grounds that the Petitioner failed to adduce proof as\nto why Trial Counsel did not pursue these motions, leaving it to speculate as to Trial\nCounsel’s performance.6 The record supports the post-conviction court’s findings on this\nissue. Accordingly, the Petitioner has failed to prove these claims, and they properly were\ndenied. See Gdongaley P. Berry v. State, No. M2010-01136-CCA-R3-PD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">5326280</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (Tenn.

Feb. 16, 2010)\n(rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of counsel where petitioner did not question his\nattorneys about the claimed deficiencies, leaving the court to speculate as to their\nperformance). We address the remaining claims on this issue below.\n\n                               1. The Bloodworth Motion to Dismiss\n\n        As the State asserts in its brief, the Petitioner failed to prove by clear and convincing\nevidence that Trial Counsel performed deficiently with regard to the motion to dismiss filed\nby Charles Bloodworth. Although the Petitioner presented testimony at the post-conviction\nhearing regarding Bloodworth’s reasons for filing the motion and the sequence of events\nleading up to its filing, the record is silent as to the arguments and evidence actually\npresented by Bloodworth at the hearings on the motion. This is so because the record from\nthe Petitioner’s direct appeal, which was incorporated by reference into the post-conviction\nrecord, does not contain the transcripts from the three separate hearings held in 1997 on the\nmotion and referred to by the trial court in the order denying the motion to dismiss. The post-\nconviction court properly concluded that the Petitioner’s failure to include these transcripts\nin the record “limited” its “ability to review the issue.”7 Moreover, this Court is precluded\nfrom considering an issue when the record is incomplete and does not contain a transcript of\nthe proceedings relevant to the issue presented for review. State v. Roberts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2406068\"><a href=\"/opinion/2406068/state-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n836 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1988). As such, the Petitioner has failed to demonstrate that the\npost-conviction court erred in denying his claims that Bloodworth provided ineffective\n\n\n\n\n        6\n         The post-conviction court also determined that Mrs. Rogers’ testimony was not subject to exclusion\nunder the marital communications privilege.\n        7\n          After reviewing the motion and the trial court’s order, the post-conviction court also concluded that\nthe Petitioner had failed to establish “that the trial court would have granted the petitioner’s motion to\ndismiss had Mr. Bloodworth raised different arguments in the motion.”\n                                                     -65-\n\fassistance with regard to the arguments and proof presented in support of the motion to\ndismiss.\n\n                       2. Failure to File Adequate Motion to Suppress\n\n       Prior to trial, Trial Counsel filed a motion to suppress the Petitioner’s statements to\nlaw enforcement. After a hearing, at which several witnesses testified, the trial court denied\nthe motion. The Petitioner maintains that counsel was ineffective in presenting the motion,\nasserting in his brief to this Court that Trial Counsel failed to argue that the Petitioner had\nbeen subjected to custodial interrogation prior to receiving his Miranda warnings, thereby\nrendering inadmissible the statements he gave after receiving the Miranda warnings. See\nMissouri v. Seibert, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137002\"><a href=\"/opinion/137002/missouri-v-seibert/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 613-14, 617 (2004); State v.

Therefore, to prevail on this claim, the Petitioner must establish that he\nwas “in custody” prior to having received the Miranda warnings.\n\n        In State v. Anderson, the Tennessee Supreme Court held that the test for determining\nwhether a suspect is in custody and entitled to Miranda warnings is “whether, under the\ntotality of the circumstances, a reasonable person in the suspect’s position would consider\nhimself or herself deprived of freedom of movement to a degree associated with a formal\narrest.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1743236\"><a href=\"/opinion/1743236/state-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">937</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 855 (Tenn. 1996).

The Anderson court set forth the following non-exclusive list of factors\nrelevant to this “objective assessment”:\n\n       the time and location of the interrogation; the duration and character of the\n       questioning; the officer’s tone of voice and general demeanor; the suspect’s\n       method of transportation to the place of questioning; the number of police\n       officers present; any limitation on movement or other form of restraint\n       imposed on the suspect during the interrogation; any interactions between the\n       officer and the suspect, including the words spoken by the officer to the\n       suspect, and the suspect’s verbal or nonverbal responses; the extent to which\n       the suspect is confronted with the law enforcement officer’s suspicions of guilt\n       or evidence of guilt; and finally, the extent to which the suspect is made aware\n       that he or she is free to refrain from answering questions or to end the\n       interview at will.\n\nAnderson, 937 S.W.2d at 855. The Anderson court stressed that the determination of\nwhether a suspect is in custody for Miranda purposes is a “very fact specific inquiry.” Id.\n\n        During the post-conviction hearing, the Petitioner adduced no testimony relevant to\nthis issue from any of the participants in the Petitioner’s initial questioning. Thus, we are left\n\n                                              -66-\n\fwith only the testimony adduced during the hearing on the motion to suppress from which\nto glean the Petitioner’s custodial status prior to the time he was given his Miranda warnings.\n\n        Sergeant Clifton Smith of the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Department testified that\nhe initially approached the Petitioner at the Petitioner’s job site. Sgt. Smith then left and\nspoke with the Petitioner’s wife. After this conversation, Sgt. Smith returned to the\nPetitioner’s job site and asked the Petitioner if he was willing to accompany Sgt. Smith to the\nCriminal Justice Center for an interview. The Petitioner answered affirmatively and followed\nSgt. Smith to the Criminal Justice Center in the Petitioner’s own vehicle. When they arrived,\nthe Petitioner accompanied Sgt. Smith into the building. The Petitioner was not placed in\nhandcuffs, nor was he placed under arrest. The men entered an interview room and the\nPetitioner took a seat. Sgt. Smith testified that Investigator Billy Batson and FBI Special\nAgent Brett Murray were also in the room. By this time it was approximately 10:45 in the\nmorning. Special Agent Brett Murray began to question the Petitioner about his possible\ninvolvement in the victim’s disappearance. Sgt. Smith testified that, at this point in time, the\nPetitioner was not the only suspect in the case. During the interview, the Petitioner “said that\nhe was the one that we were looking for,” apparently referring to a composite drawing that\nhad been composed. At that point, 11:18 that morning, Sgt. Smith issued Miranda warnings\nto the Petitioner.\n\n       We have closely reviewed the record of the hearing on the motion to suppress. The\nPetitioner simply has failed to establish that he was “in custody” prior to receiving his\nMiranda warnings such that Trial Counsel should have raised this issue in the hearing on the\nmotion to suppress. Although the Petitioner attempts to rely on Dailey, that case is\ndistinguishable on the facts. In Dailey, as in this case, the suspect drove himself to the police\nstation upon an officer’s request. Once there, he was taken to an interview room and\ninterrogated. The interrogation was videotaped and, upon reviewing the tape, the Tennessee\nSupreme Court was able to determine the following:\n\n       The interview took place in a small interrogation room located in a secured\n       portion of the building. The initial phase of the interview was not prolonged.\n       The character of the questioning was accusatory and demanding, aimed at\n       convincing the Defendant that the police already had sufficient evidence to\n       convict him of murdering the victim and that he had to give them an\n       explanation. Det. Roland’s and Sgt. Postiglione’s tone of voice and general\n       demeanor were conversational; however, at least one of the officers was\n       armed. Two officers questioned him. The Defendant’s movements were\n       restrained to the extent that he was placed in the back corner of a small room\n       with one door, the door was closed, and a police officer was sitting between\n       the Defendant and the closed door. The interactions between the Defendant\n\n                                              -67-\n\f       and the officers consisted of a few prefatory comments about the Defendant’s\n       practice of homeschooling followed by increasingly focused accusations and\n       questions about the Defendant’s involvement in the victim’s death. Only a few\n       minutes into the interrogation, Det. Roland told the Defendant that if he went\n       “strictly on the evidence, [he had] to charge [the Defendant] with first degree\n       murder.” The Defendant’s initial responses ran the gamut from unequivocal\n       denials to challenges to statements of “I don’t know what to say.” Eventually,\n       after having been repeatedly told that the officers knew the Defendant was\n       involved in the victim’s death and just needed the details as to why, and that\n       the police already had sufficient evidence to convict him of first degree\n       murder, the Defendant confessed to killing the victim. The officers never\n       informed the Defendant that he was free to refrain from answering questions\n       or that he was free to end the interview until after they had extracted a\n       confession from him.\n\n              This full recitation of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the\n       Defendant’s initial questioning convinces us that a reasonable person in the\n       Defendant’s position would have considered himself or herself “deprived of\n       freedom of movement to a degree associated with a formal arrest,” at least by\n       the point at which Det. Roland stated, “if I go strictly on the evidence, I have\n       to charge you with first degree murder.”\n\nDailey, 273 S.W.3d at 103-04 (footnote omitted). The only similarities in the two cases is\nthat the Petitioner drove himself to the police station and was questioned there by more than\none officer in a room. Unlike the situation in Dailey, however, the record does not establish\nthat, prior to being issued Miranda warnings, the Petitioner was taken to a room in a secured\narea of the building; that the door was closed; that the Petitioner was physically blocked from\nleaving the room; or that he was threatened with prosecution and told that there was already\nenough evidence to charge him with a serious felony. In short, the record in this case does\nnot establish that a reasonable person in the Petitioner’s position would have considered\nhimself deprived of freedom of movement to a degree associated with a formal arrest prior\nto the time he was issued Miranda warnings. Accordingly, the Petitioner has failed to\nestablish that Trial Counsel was deficient in failing to make this argument in support of the\nmotion to suppress the Petitioner’s statements. The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this\nbasis.\n\n      The Petitioner also asserts that Trial Counsel should have moved to suppress the\nevidence arising out of his visit to Potter’s Lane and the bridge with law enforcement while\naccompanied by Goodlett, arguing that Goodlett’s cooperation in this trip and reenactment\nprovided a basis for suppression under the Sixth Amendment’s right to counsel. The\n\n                                              -68-\n\fPetitioner has cited us to no authority for the suppression of evidence on the basis of\nineffective assistance of counsel during the gathering of said evidence. Therefore, this issue\nhas been waived. See Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b).\n\n       3. Failure to Challenge Venue and Failure to Seek Severance of Rape Charge\n\n       As the State asserts in its brief, even assuming that Trial Counsel’s performance was\nconstitutionally deficient with regard to their failure to file a motion challenging Montgomery\nCounty as the proper venue for the homicide and rape charges and their failure to file a\nmotion seeking severance of the rape charge from the remaining offenses charged in the\nindictment, the Petitioner did not prove resulting prejudice. As the post-conviction court\nconcluded in the order denying relief, the evidence presented at trial was sufficient to\nestablish venue in Montgomery County as to all offenses.\n\n       In denying the Petitioner’s claim regarding Trial Counsel’s failure to challenge venue,\nthe post-conviction court stated:\n\n       [T]he evidence established that the [Petitioner] left the area of the victim’s\n       home around 2:00 p.m. the day the victim was last seen alive. The [Petitioner]\n       admitted to law enforcement officers that he was the last person to see the\n       victim alive – in Montgomery County – and that the last known location of the\n       victim before her remains were found was the [P]etitioner’s car. This evidence\n       was sufficient for the jury to find by a preponderance of the evidence that the\n       [Petitioner] formed his intent to kill the victim – i.e., premeditation, an element\n       of premeditated first degree murder – in Montgomery County, even if the\n       victim’s remains were found in another county.\n\n               Regarding the charge for felony murder in perpetration of kidnapping,\n       the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the [P]etitioner abducted\n       the victim in the vicinity of her Montgomery County home and that the victim\n       was still alive when the [P]etitioner put her in his truck [sic]. Thus, venue was\n       proper for that felony murder count.\n\n              Regarding the charges for felony murder in perpetration of a rape and\n       child rape, the evidence of the [P]etitioner’s sexual offenses was wholly\n       circumstantial – the victim changed into clean shorts shortly before she\n       disappeared, semen stains were found in the victim’s shorts, and the shirt the\n       victim was wearing when her remains were discovered was turned inside out,\n       which was consistent with being removed from her body by a human. Because\n       the jury is permitted to draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, and\n\n                                              -69-\n\f       because venue may be established by circumstantial evidence, the Court finds\n       that it was reasonable for the jury to find that venue was proper in\n       Montgomery County[.]\n\n              Venue is a jury question, and the evidence in this case regarding venue\n       was sufficient to present the venue question to the jury on all counts.\n       Furthermore, the evidence produced at trial was sufficient to establish venue\n       in Montgomery County as to all offenses, including the homicide and rape\n       charges. Thus, counsel’s decision not to assert that the offenses occurred\n       elsewhere did not prejudice the [P]etitioner.\n\n       The evidence presented at the Petitioner’s trial supports the post-conviction court’s\nfindings in this regard. Although the prosecutor took the position during closing argument\nthat the rape occurred in Stewart County, the proof at trial was equally amenable to the\nconclusion that the Petitioner raped and killed the victim while they were still somewhere in\nMontgomery County and that he then transported her body to Stewart County for disposal.\nCertainly, it would have been easier to conceal a deceased child during the long drive\nbetween the scene of the abduction and the area where the victim’s remains were found than\nto keep a live abducted child subdued so as not to attract attention.\n\n       The law on venue also supports the post-conviction court’s conclusion that venue in\nMontgomery County as to the homicide and rape charges was established by the evidence\npresented at trial.

Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1057985\"><a href=\"/opinion/1057985/state-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101-\n102 (Tenn. 2006):\n\n               Our Constitution provides that an accused must be tried in the county\n       in which the crime was committed.

Crim. App. 1993).\n\n        The Petitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis. In concluding that the Petitioner\nhad failed to establish resulting prejudice from any deficiency on Trial Counsel’s part in\nfailing to seek severance of the rape charge from the remaining offenses charged in the\n\nindictment, the post-conviction court stated:\n\n       The [P]etitioner does not argue that evidence regarding the rape would have\n       been inadmissible in trials on the other counts, and vice versa; clearly the\n       offenses with which the [P]etitioner was charged were “based on the same\n       conduct or ar[o]se from the same criminal episode” such that joinder of the\n       offenses would have been mandatory under Rule 8(a) of the Tennessee Rules\n       of Criminal Procedure. The [P]etitioner argues that severance would have\n       been necessary under Rule 14(b)(2) of the Tennessee Rules of Criminal\n       Procedure because severance would have been “appropriate to promote a fair\n       determination of the [Petitioner’s] guilt or innocence of each offense,” but the\n       Court disagrees with the [P]etitioner’s assertion. The trial court properly\n       instructed the jury that for each offense, it could return a guilty verdict only if\n       it found by a preponderance of the evidence that the given offenses occurred\n       in Montgomery County. There is no evidence in the record to support that the\n       jury was confused regarding the trial court’s instructions.\n\nWe agree with the post-conviction court’s conclusion on this issue and hold that the\nPetitioner is not entitled to relief on this basis.\n\n                                    D. Trial Performance\n\n        In his fourth issue on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction court erred\nin denying his claims that Trial Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance\nduring the course of trial. Specifically, the Petitioner alleges that Trial Counsel: (1) failed\nto object to the trial court’s statement to prospective jurors during jury selection to the effect\nthat a finding of not guilty as to the murder counts would result in no sentencing hearing; (2)\nfailed to object to the victim impact testimony presented by the State at sentencing as unduly\nprejudicial; (3) failed to object to and move for a mistrial based upon the State’s tactic of\nposing speaking objections in the presence of the jury; (4) failed to object to and move for\na mistrial based upon the State’s asking leading questions of its own witnesses; (5) failed to\n\n                                               -71-\n\fobject to and move for a mistrial based upon the State’s mischaracterization of the\nPetitioner’s statement to law enforcement as a “confession to murder”; (6) failed to object\nto the State’s presenting improper evidence from the nurse who drew Petitioner’s blood for\nforensic testing prior to trial concerning the Petitioner’s demeanor as being “upbeat” and\n“joking”; (7) conceded the Petitioner’s involvement in the crimes during closing argument\nat sentencing; (8) failed to object with sufficient legal argument to the admissibility of the\npedophilia propensity testimony presented by Dr. William Bernet; (9) failed to proffer as an\nexhibit during the jury-out hearing at trial the DCS records documenting that the victim’s\nbrother, Jeremy Beard, had told psychologists approximately six to twelve months after the\nvictim’s disappearance that his biological father had some years earlier “taught him to have\nsex with his sister”; (10) failed to utilize the DCS records pertaining to Jeremy Beard during\ncross-examination of the victim’s mother, Jeannie Meyer, at sentencing when she attributed\nJeremy’s mental health problems entirely to the victim’s disappearance and death; and (11)\nfailed to object to certain irrelevant and inconclusive evidence and testimony introduced by\nthe State at trial.\n\n        The post-conviction court denied all but one of these claims, in part, because the\nPetitioner failed to question attorney Converse regarding these claims and thereby present\nany evidence in support of these claims. The record supports the post-conviction court’s\nfindings in this regard. Converse did not testify at the post-conviction hearing about any of\nthe specific acts or omissions identified in this issue and alleged by the Petitioner in support\nof his claims that Trial Counsel’s trial performance amounted to ineffective assistance. We\nrecognize that Converse was questioned generally at the hearing regarding his belief in the\noverwhelming guilt of the Petitioner and about Dr. William Bernet’s conclusion that the\nPetitioner had pedophilic tendencies. However, the Petitioner never asked Converse why he\nconceded the Petitioner’s involvement in the crimes during closing argument at sentencing\nand never asked Converse to elaborate on his thought process regarding the objection he\nmade to Dr. Bernet’s pedophilia propensity testimony at sentencing. In short, the Petitioner\nhas failed to overcome the strong presumption that Trial Counsel’s performance as to these\nmatters was the result of a strategic or tactical decision and has therefore failed to establish\ndeficient performance as to these allegations. See Gdongalay P. Berry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5326280</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nat *8.\n\n       With regard to Trial Counsel’s alleged failure to proffer the DCS records as an exhibit\nduring the jury-out hearing at trial, the post-conviction court determined that Trial Counsel\nhad made an offer of proof in the form of testimony from the victim’s mother concerning the\nsubstance of the statements attributable to Jeremy Beard as reflected in the DCS records. As\nsuch, the post-conviction court concluded that the Petitioner could not prove prejudice to the\noutcome of his case resulting from the asserted deficiency in Trial Counsel’s performance\nin not proffering the DCS records containing the same statements from Jeremy Beard.\n\n                                              -72-\n\f        The record supports the post-conviction court’s conclusion in this regard. As the\nsupreme court noted in its opinion in the Petitioner’s direct appeal, the Petitioner proffered\ntestimony from Jeannie Meyer during a jury-out hearing concerning the statements Jeremy\nBeard had made to her, which in turn she had reported to medical personnel as reflected in\nthe DCS records. See Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 609 n.5. Therefore, when the supreme court\nconcluded on direct appeal that evidence from Jeremy Beard confirming that he had made\nthe statements “would not establish that Jeremy had actually had sex with the victim versus\nsimply reporting that he had,” id. at 613, the supreme court had before it the proffer of\nJeannie Meyer’s testimony concerning the substance of the statements, see id. at 609 n.5,\neven though it declined to consider as having been improperly included in the record on\nappeal the DCS records which also included the statement. See id. at 611. As such, as the\npost-conviction court concluded, there is no reasonable probability that the outcome of the\nPetitioner’s direct appeal would have been different had the records themselves been\nproffered. Accordingly, this entire issue is without merit.\n\n                      E and F. Jury Instructions and Appellate Issues\n\n       In his fifth and sixth issues on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-conviction\ncourt erred in denying his claims that Trial Counsel provided constitutionally ineffective\nassistance by failing to object to various jury instructions given by the trial court during the\nPetitioner’s trial and by failing to raise various issues on appeal during the Petitioner’s direct\nappellate proceedings. Once again, the post-conviction court denied these claims, in part,\nbecause the Petitioner failed to present any testimony in support of the claims at the post-\nconviction hearing. As the State argues in its brief, the record supports the post-conviction\ncourt’s findings in this regard.\n\n        During his testimony at the post-conviction hearing, Converse did not address any of\nthe specific acts or omissions the Petitioner refers to in his briefs to this Court on these\nissues. Indeed, Converse was asked no questions during the post-conviction hearing about\nany of the jury instructions given in the Petitioner’s trial. With regard to the Petitioner’s\ndirect appeal, Converse testified that Brock Mehler, his co-counsel on the appeal, handled\nmost of the work, including the drafting of the amended motion for new trial. Converse\ntestified no further about the Petitioner’s direct appeal. Mehler did not testify at the post-\nconviction hearing. The Tennessee Supreme Court has made clear that, when a petitioner\nalleges ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, factors for consideration include (1)\nwhether appellate counsel testified at the post-conviction hearing “as to his appeal strategy\nand, if so, were the justifications reasonable?”; (2) whether the petitioner and appellate\ncounsel met and discussed possible issues; (3) whether the record establishes that appellate\ncounsel reviewed all of the relevant facts; and (4) whether appellate counsel’s decision to\nomit an issue was “an unreasonable one which only an incompetent attorney would adopt.”\n\n                                              -73-\n\fCarpenter, 126 S.W.3d at 888. The Petitioner failed to adduce proof at the post-conviction\nhearing on these factors. Accordingly, and once again despite his arguments to the contrary,\nthe Petitioner failed to prove any of the claims forming the basis of this issue on appeal. See\nGdongalay P. Berry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5326280</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *8 (rejecting claim of ineffective assistance of\ncounsel where petitioner did not question his attorneys about the claimed deficiencies,\nleaving the court to speculate as to their performance). Therefore, the Petitioner is entitled\nto no relief on his fifth and sixth issues.\n\n  II. Constitutional Errors at Trial and Constitutional Challenges to the Death Penalty\n\n        In his seventh, eighth, and ninth issues on appeal, the Petitioner argues that the post-\nconviction court erred in denying his various constitutional challenges to his trial in general\nand his death sentence in particular. Specifically, the Petitioner claims that: (1) Tennessee’s\nstatutorily mandated system of comparative proportionality review violates a capital\ndefendant’s right to due process of law in general and violated his right to due process of law\nas applied in his case; (2) his right to a fair trial was denied as a result of having only one\nattorney participate in individual voir dire in violation of the requirements of Rule 13, section\n3 of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Tennessee; (3) his death sentence constitutes cruel\nand unusual punishment because it unconstitutionally impinges upon his fundamental right\nto life and because Tennessee’s available methods of execution by lethal injection and\nelectrocution are not consistent with the “evolving standards of decency that mark the\nprogress of a maturing society” from which the Eighth Amendment draws its meaning, Trop\nv. Dulles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105659\"><a href=\"/opinion/105659/trop-v-dulles/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">86</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion); and (4) the State engaged in\nprosecutorial misconduct throughout the course of the trial.8\n\n        The post-conviction court denied all of the claims, except the claim involving the\nconstitutional challenge to proportionality review, on grounds that they were waived for post-\nconviction purposes in that they were not raised on direct appeal, were not based upon\nconstitutional rights not recognized at the time of the Petitioner’s trial, and were not claims\nthe Petitioner was prevented from raising due to state action in violation of the federal or\nstate constitutions. We agree with this conclusion. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-106(g).\n\n\n\n\n        8\n          The Petitioner also includes in this claim that Trial Counsel was ineffective in failing to object to\nimproper remarks by the prosecution during opening statements and closing arguments. The post-conviction\ncourt determined that the prosecution did make some improper comments, to which Trial Counsel did not\nobject. The post-conviction court concluded that Trial Counsel’s performance was deficient in this regard\nbut that the Petitioner had failed to establish prejudice. We agree with the post-conviction court’s\ndeterminations in this regard.\n                                                     -74-\n\f       The post-conviction court also denied the Petitioner’s constitutional challenge to\nproportionality review on grounds that it had been raised on direct appeal and, therefore, was\n“previously determined.” We also agree with this conclusion. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-\n30-106(h); see also Rogers, 188 S.W.3d at 631 (appx). The post-conviction court\nalternatively determined that the Petitioner’s cruel and unusual punishment claim and his\nchallenge to the constitutionality of proportionality review were without merit. We also\nagree with these conclusions as they are consistent with settled precedent. See Baze v. Rees,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145817\"><a href=\"/opinion/145817/baze-v-rees/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008); Workman v.

Cumulative Error\n\n        In his tenth issue on appeal, the Petitioner contends that he is entitled to relief from\nhis convictions and sentences due to cumulative error. However, there is no record citation\ncontained within the argument for this issue indicating that the Petitioner raised a cumulative\nerror claim below. See Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7)(A) (requiring argument to contain\n“citations to the authorities and appropriate references to the record”) (emphasis added). As\nsuch, even though the State does not argue waiver in response to this issue, we have\nconcluded that the issue is waived. See Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b) (“Issues which are not\nsupported by argument, citation to authorities, or appropriate references to the record will\nbe treated as waived in this court.” ) (Emphasis added); see also State v. Schaller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428604\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428604/state-v-schaller/\"><span class=\"volume\">975</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318 (Tenn.

Even if this Court chose to address the merits\nof the cumulative error claim, this Court would conclude that this issue is without merit.\n\n                                         Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the post-conviction court denying the\nPetitioner’s initial and amended petitions for post-conviction relief challenging his\nconvictions and sentences arising out of the disappearance and murder of nine-year-old\nJacqueline Beard is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                     _________________________________\n                                                     JEFFREY S.
