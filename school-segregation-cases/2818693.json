An administrative hearing officer<br><br>          ruled for the parents.   Finding that the program  offered by the<br><br>          school  district for  those years  was a free  appropriate public<br><br>          education  as envisioned  by the  relevant statute,  the district<br><br>          court reversed the administrative decision.  We affirm.<br><br>               In light of the evidentiary support for the district court's<br><br>          factual   findings  concerning   the   appropriateness   of   the<br><br>          educational  program offered  by the  school, we  cannot say  the<br><br>          court  committed clear error.  In  addition, although the parents<br><br>          may not have  waived their claims  of procedural violations,  the<br><br>          shortcomings they allege do not entitle them to relief.<br><br>               The Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act  (the Act),<br><br>          20  U.S.C.   1400 et  seq., requires that  to qualify for federal<br>                            __  ___<br><br>          financial  assistance, participating  states must  adopt policies<br><br>          assuring  all students  with disabilities  the right  to a  \"free<br><br>          appropriate public education.\"   20 U.S.C.   1412(1).   The state<br><br>          must  assure  that,  to  the  maximum  extent  appropriate,  this<br><br>          education will  be provided in the  least restrictive environment<br><br>          with children who are not disabled.  20 U.S.C.   1412(5)(B).  The<br><br>                                          2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          Act  requires  the  state   to  establish  and  maintain  certain<br><br>          procedures \"to  assure that children with  disabilities and their<br><br>          parents or guardians  are guaranteed  procedural safeguards  with<br><br>          respect to the provision of a free appropriate public education.\"<br><br>          20 U.S.C.   1415(a).<br><br>               Schools  are required to develop an individualized education<br><br>          program  (IEP) for  each child with  a disability.   An  IEP is a<br><br>          program  of  instruction  and  related  services  that  has  been<br><br>          specially designed to  meet the unique  needs of the child.   The<br><br>          IEP document contains information concerning  the child's present<br><br>          levels of performance; a statement of annual goals and short term<br><br>          instructional objectives; a statement of the specific educational<br><br>          services to be provided, and the extent to which this can be done<br><br>          in the  regular educational programs; and  objective criteria for<br><br>          measuring the student's progress.  <br><br>               The  IEP  is  developed  by  a team  including  a  qualified<br><br>          representative of the local  educational agency, the teacher, the<br><br>          parents or  guardian, and,  where appropriate,  the student.   20<br><br>          U.S.C.    1401(a)(20).  Thereafter,  the IEP must  be reviewed at<br><br>          least  annually  and  revised  when   necessary.    20  U.S.C.   <br><br>          1414(a)(5).    Parents  who  disagree  with  a  proposed IEP  are<br><br>          entitled  to an  impartial  due process  hearing.   20  U.S.C.   <br><br>          1415(b)(2).    Any  party  aggrieved  by  the   decision  of  the<br><br>          administrative  hearing officer  can  appeal to  either state  or<br><br>          federal court.  20 U.S.C.   1415(e).  An IEP is appropriate under<br><br>          the Act if it provides instruction and support services which are<br><br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          reasonably  calculated  to  confer educational  benefits  to  the<br><br>          student.

Hershman, 701 F.2d 223, 226-27 (1st Cir. 1983).  <br>          ______________________<br><br>               Michael   Dobrowolski,  the  son   of  Frances  and  Charles<br><br>          Dobrowolski, was born on November 12, 1974.  While Michael was in<br><br>          second  grade in  Derry,  New Hampshire,  he  was found  to  have<br><br>          certain learning disabilities.  Derry Cooperative School District<br><br>          furnished IEPs  for the  1983-84 and 1984-85  school years,  when<br><br>          Michael was in  the third and fourth grades.   Both of these IEPs<br><br>          were accepted by  the Dobrowolskis.   Derry had  proposed a  more<br><br>          intensive  IEP for  the  fifth grade  which  was not  implemented<br><br>          because  the family left the  district and moved  to Hampton, New<br><br>          Hampshire.  <br><br>               The Hampton  School District received from  the Derry School<br><br>          District Michael's report cards and the proposed fifth grade IEP.<br><br>          In addition, representatives of Hampton met with Mrs. Dobrowolski<br><br>          prior  to the beginning of the  1985-86 school year and knew that<br><br>          Michael was  a special education student.   At the  start of that<br><br>          term, however, Hampton had not yet offered an IEP.   As a result,<br><br>          Michael started  the fifth  grade in  mainstream classes  with no<br><br>          special educational program.  Several weeks later, on October 17,<br><br>          1985, an IEP was developed for Michael.  That plan placed Michael<br><br>          in  mainstream classes for  all subjects,  and made  the resource<br><br>          room available for up to three hours per week, as needed.  <br><br>               Michael did not make much use of the resource room the first<br><br>          semester.  His grades plummeted in the ensuing semesters.  As his<br><br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          grades fell,  Michael's time in the resource  room was increased,<br><br>          reaching four hours per week by March 1986. <br><br>               During the summer of 1986, the Dobrowolskis enrolled Michael<br><br>          at  the Learning Skills Academy,  a private special education day<br><br>          school, where he was tutored in math,  social communication, peer<br><br>          relation  skills,   and  reading.      Michael  apparently   made<br><br>          significant progress there, and it appears  that this contrast to<br><br>          his performance at  Hampton led the Dobrowolskis to  question the<br><br>          wisdom of Michael's continued enrollment in the public school.<br><br>               In  August 1986,  Mrs.  Dobrowolski  was  told by  Mrs.  Lee<br><br>          Cooper,  Hampton's director of  special education, that Michael's<br><br>          IEP  for sixth  grade could  be the  same as  that for  the fifth<br><br>          grade, since federal  law does  not require more  than an  annual<br><br>          review of  an IEP, and the  fifth grade IEP had  been modified in<br><br>          March  1986.   Mrs. Cooper  also told  Mrs. Dobrowolski  that the<br><br>          district nonetheless would review  Michael's IEP during the first<br><br>          week  of  school.   On  September  2,  however, Mrs.  Dobrowolski<br><br>          informed  Hampton that  she  unilaterally had  decided to  enroll<br><br>          Michael at Learning Skills Academy.  <br><br>               Meetings were held  on September 4, 1986,  and September 11,<br><br>          1986.  The IEP developed as  a result of these meetings  provided<br><br>          for another increase in resource room time.  It also provided for<br><br>          modifications  in Michael's  mainstream  academic  classes.   The<br><br>          modifications  included  preferential  seating, teacher  cues  to<br><br>          Michael  to  pay  attention,  guidance  to  assist  him  in  time<br><br>          management, and short term goals with frequent checkups.  <br><br><br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>               The  Dobrowolskis disagreed  with this IEP,  as well  as the<br><br>          revisions  presented  at  meetings   in  October,  November,  and<br><br>          December  of 1986.    The Dobrowolskis  requested  a due  process<br><br>          hearing in  January  1987.   That  request  was  later  withdrawn<br><br>          without  prejudice.   The Dobrowolskis  refiled their  request in<br><br>          September  1987, contesting both the 1986-87 IEP and the IEP that<br><br>          had  been prepared for the 1987-88 school year.  Michael remained<br><br>          at the  Learning  Skills Academy  during  the sixth  and  seventh<br><br>          grades.  The parents sought reimbursement for the cost of tuition<br><br>          at and transportation to the private school.  Their challenge was<br><br>          based on claims of both  substantive and procedural violations of<br><br>          the Act.<br><br>               A  due  process  hearing was  held  before  a  State of  New<br><br>          Hampshire hearing officer  in February  and March of  1988.   The<br><br>          hearing officer found that the IEPs Hampton offered for the 1986-<br><br>          87  and  1987-88 school  years were  inappropriate.   Finding the<br><br>          program provided at the  Learning Skills Academy appropriate, the<br><br>          hearing officer ordered Hampton to reimburse the Dobrowolskis for<br><br>          their  expenses.    The  hearing  officer  did  not  address  the<br><br>          Dobrowolskis'  claims of procedural violations.  Hampton appealed<br><br>          the administrative  decision to the United  States District Court<br><br>          for the District  of New Hampshire.   After a short bench  trial,<br><br>          the district court overturned  the hearing officer's decision and<br><br>          entered judgment for Hampton.   <br><br>               The  district  court  found  that  the  September  1986  IEP<br><br>          contrasted sharply  with the  one developed in  October 1985  and<br><br><br>                                          6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          modified in  March 1986, and that  the individualized instruction<br><br>          offered  by this  IEP \"likely  would have  yielded more  positive<br><br>          academic results than did the previous IEPs.\"  The district court<br><br>          further found that the IEP proposed for 1987-88 was substantially<br><br>          similar  to the  1986-87 IEP.   The  court acknowledged  that due<br><br>          weight  must be accorded the decision of the hearing officer, but<br><br>          found that reversal of  the administrative decision was warranted<br><br>          because the preponderance of the evidence indicated that the IEPs<br><br>          for  the  1986-87  and  1987-88  school  years  offered  programs<br><br>          reasonably calculated to yield  educational benefits in the least<br><br>          restrictive environment.  <br><br>                                  Trial-Level Review<br>                                  Trial-Level Review<br><br>               The  Act provides that, in reviewing the decision of a state<br><br>          hearing officer, the district court \"shall receive the records of<br><br>          the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at<br><br>          the  request  of  a  party,  and,  basing  its  decision  on  the<br><br>          preponderance of  the evidence,  shall grant such  relief as  the<br><br>          court determines is appropriate.\"   20 U.S.C.   1415(e)(2).

The<br><br>          court properly  articulated the governing legal  issue as whether<br><br>          the IEPs \"guarantee  some 'reasonable probability of  educational<br><br>          benefit  with sufficient supportive  services at  public expense'<br><br>          ...  in the least restrictive  environment.\"  The  program at the<br><br>          Learning  Skills Academy may have  provided Michael with a better<br><br>          education than that offered by the public school.

Our task, therefore, is  to determine<br><br>          whether the  district court  committed clear error  in concluding<br><br>          that the IEPs Hampton offered were appropriate.<br><br>               The Dobrowolskis  assert that the district  court's judgment<br><br>          is invalid due to certain erroneous findings of fact.  Our  focus<br><br>          is  on  whether  the   evidence  supports  the  district  court's<br><br>          conclusion that Hampton's IEPs for the 1986-87 and 1987-88 school<br><br>          years were  reasonably calculated to  confer educational benefits<br><br><br>                                          9<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          in the least  restrictive environment.

Thus, the specific factual findings of the<br><br>          district court  are to be set  aside only if, upon  review of the<br><br>          entire  record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction<br><br>          that a mistake has been committed.<br><br>               Our  review  of the  record as  a  whole indicates  that the<br><br>          district  court  did  not  commit clear  error.    The  following<br><br>          evidence presented to the  district court supports its conclusion<br><br>          that  the IEPs Hampton offered for the 1986-87 and 1987-88 school<br><br>          years were appropriate:<br><br>               First, there  was evidence of Michael's  progress at Hampton<br><br>          during the first quarter of fifth grade.  This was achieved  with<br><br>          minimal   resource    room   support   and    minimal   classroom<br><br>          modifications.<br><br><br><br><br>                                          10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>               Second, there  was evidence  that Michael's  problems during<br><br>          the remainder of fifth grade centered around inattention, lack of<br><br>          motivation, and failure to complete homework assignments.<br><br>               Third, the IEPs  Hampton offered for  the sixth and  seventh<br><br>          grades offered more services than the IEPs  which governed during<br><br>          the  fifth grade,  and addressed  the attention,  motivation, and<br><br>          homework issues.<br><br>               Fourth,  school district  witnesses testified  that children<br><br>          with disabilities similar  to or more severe  than Michael's have<br><br>          made educational  progress at Hampton in programs  similar to the<br><br>          programs offered to Michael in the 1986-87 and 1987-88 IEPs.<br><br>               Fifth,  that  testimony  was  corroborated  by  professional<br><br>          literature   indicating  that  children  with  mild  to  moderate<br><br>          learning  disabilities  generally  make as  much  educational and<br><br>          emotional  progress  in  mainstream or  mainstream/resource  room<br><br>          programs,  with  adequate support,  as  in  full time  segregated<br><br>          classes or private schools devoted to children with disabilities.<br><br>               Finally, evidence was introduced to show that the IEPs which<br><br>          Hampton offered Michael for the 1986-87 and 1987-88 school  years<br><br>          reflected  an  established method  for  controlling an  attention<br><br>          deficit disorder without medication.  <br><br>               In light of the  foregoing evidence, we cannot say  that the<br><br>          district court committed clear error in concluding  that the IEPs<br><br>          Hampton offered were appropriate.   The specific factual findings<br><br>          to which the Dobrowolskis attempt to assign error either were not<br><br>          clearly  erroneous or were  not integral to  the court's ultimate<br><br><br>                                          11<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the IEPs.

The district court<br><br>          disposed  of   the   Dobrowolskis'  allegations   of   procedural<br><br>          violations as follows:<br><br>               Defendants  allege  that   Hampton  failed  to   follow<br>               procedures  required by the  Act.   However, defendants<br>               have  provided  no  examples   or  proof  of  any  such<br>               violations and the court will not sua sponte search the<br>                                                 __________<br>               record  for procedural  errors.   Hence, this  argument<br>               will not be addressed.<br><br>               Claims   of   procedural   errors  not   presented   to  the<br><br>          administrative  hearing officer  are not  preserved for  judicial<br><br>          review by the trial court.

It<br><br>          is  true  that the  Dobrowolskis did  not  stress their  claim of<br><br>          procedural noncompliance  to the  district court, and  that their<br><br>          trial brief did  not provide any specific  examples of procedural<br><br>          violations, but the pleadings before the district court contained<br><br>          more  than the  \"barest inference\"  of their  claim.

Their trial<br><br>          brief  directed  the  court's   attention  to  pleadings  in  the<br><br>          administrative   record  which   recited  their   contentions  of<br><br>          procedural noncompliance  in detail.

A number of the Dobrowolskis' claims refer to actions of<br><br>          Hampton that occurred well before the 1986-87  and 1987-88 school<br><br>          years, such as their  mishandling of Michael's records and  their<br><br>          failure to provide needed services in the fall  of 1985.  Because<br><br>          these  alleged  procedural  violations  occurred  outside  of the<br><br><br>                                          14<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          relevant time frame,  they cannot provide  the basis for  setting<br><br>          aside the IEPs at issue.<br><br>               Those  flaws argued by the Dobrowolskis  that do address the<br><br>          1986-87  and  1987-88 IEPs  also  fail  to  provide  grounds  for<br><br>          reversal.   Although the IEPs may  have been written by  a single<br><br>          member of Michael's IEP team, the record indicates that they were<br><br>          developed  through  a  team  effort  which  included  input  from<br><br>          Michael's parents and former teachers.  It is permissible for one<br><br>          person to draft the IEP as long as the parents are not denied the<br><br>          opportunity  to participate, and the members of the IEP team have<br><br>          an opportunity to discuss and amend the IEP.

We reject the<br><br>          Dobrowolskis'  contention that  the district  court actually  did<br><br>          something other than that which it said it was doing.<br><br>                         Admission of Deposition Transcripts<br>                         Admission of Deposition Transcripts<br><br>               Although the Dobrowolskis arguably are correct in contending<br><br>          that  the district  court committed  error when it  admitted into<br><br>          evidence the discovery  depositions of Dr.  Clara Maslow and  Dr.<br><br>          George  Storm, we  need not  decide the  point because  the trial<br><br>          court ultimately disregarded this evidence.   In its trial brief,<br><br>          Hampton relied  on the trial deposition  transcripts to criticize<br><br>          the reports of Maslow and Storm, the Dobrowolskis' experts, which<br><br>          had been  admitted in the  administrative hearing.   The district<br><br>          court responded to those arguments in a footnote which reads:<br><br>               The School District has criticized the Storm and Maslow<br>               reports and claims their  evaluations were faulty.  The<br>               court  finds  these  criticisms  immaterial  given  the<br>               relatively little  weight assigned to  [the reports] by<br>               the hearing  officer.   Furthermore, even  assuming the<br>               complete accuracy of those reports, the court finds the<br>               IEPs offered by Hampton were appropriate.<br><br>          This  is  the only  reference the  court  made to  the deposition<br><br>          transcripts.  It  is clear  from the court's  statement that  the<br><br>          deposition   transcripts   were   unnecessary   to   the  court's<br><br>          determination concerning  the appropriateness  of the IEPs.   Any<br><br>          error committed in the admission of the transcripts was harmless.<br><br>          See Puerto Rico Ports Auth. v.

An administrative hearing officer<br><br>          ruled for the parents.   Finding that the program  offered by the<br><br>          school  district for  those years  was a free  appropriate public<br><br>          education  as envisioned  by the  relevant statute,  the district<br><br>          court reversed the administrative decision.

In  addition, although the parents<br><br>          may not have  waived their claims  of procedural violations,  the<br><br>          shortcomings they allege do not entitle them to relief.<br><br>               The Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act  (the Act),<br><br>          20  U.S.C.   1400 et  seq., requires that  to qualify for federal<br>                            __  ___<br><br>          financial  assistance, participating  states must  adopt policies<br><br>          assuring  all students  with disabilities  the right  to a  \"free<br><br>          appropriate public education.\"   20 U.S.C.   1412(1).

An  IEP is a<br><br>          program  of  instruction  and  related  services  that  has  been<br><br>          specially designed to  meet the unique  needs of the child.   The<br><br>          IEP document contains information concerning  the child's present<br><br>          levels of performance; a statement of annual goals and short term<br><br>          instructional objectives; a statement of the specific educational<br><br>          services to be provided, and the extent to which this can be done<br><br>          in the  regular educational programs; and  objective criteria for<br><br>          measuring the student's progress.  <br><br>               The  IEP  is  developed  by  a team  including  a  qualified<br><br>          representative of the local  educational agency, the teacher, the<br><br>          parents or  guardian, and,  where appropriate,  the student.   20<br><br>          U.S.C.    1401(a)(20).  Thereafter,  the IEP must  be reviewed at<br><br>          least  annually  and  revised  when   necessary.    20  U.S.C.   <br><br>          1414(a)(5).    Parents  who  disagree  with  a  proposed IEP  are<br><br>          entitled  to an  impartial  due process  hearing.   20  U.S.C.   <br><br>          1415(b)(2).    Any  party  aggrieved  by  the   decision  of  the<br><br>          administrative  hearing officer  can  appeal to  either state  or<br><br>          federal court.  20 U.S.C.   1415(e).  An IEP is appropriate under<br><br>          the Act if it provides instruction and support services which are<br><br><br>                                          3<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          reasonably  calculated  to  confer educational  benefits  to  the<br><br>          student.

While Michael was in<br><br>          second  grade in  Derry,  New Hampshire,  he  was found  to  have<br><br>          certain learning disabilities.  Derry Cooperative School District<br><br>          furnished IEPs  for the  1983-84 and 1984-85  school years,  when<br><br>          Michael was in  the third and fourth grades.   Both of these IEPs<br><br>          were accepted by  the Dobrowolskis.   Derry had  proposed a  more<br><br>          intensive  IEP for  the  fifth grade  which  was not  implemented<br><br>          because  the family left the  district and moved  to Hampton, New<br><br>          Hampshire.  <br><br>               The Hampton  School District received from  the Derry School<br><br>          District Michael's report cards and the proposed fifth grade IEP.<br><br>          In addition, representatives of Hampton met with Mrs. Dobrowolski<br><br>          prior  to the beginning of the  1985-86 school year and knew that<br><br>          Michael was  a special education student.   At the  start of that<br><br>          term, however, Hampton had not yet offered an IEP.   As a result,<br><br>          Michael started  the fifth  grade in  mainstream classes  with no<br><br>          special educational program.  Several weeks later, on October 17,<br><br>          1985, an IEP was developed for Michael.  That plan placed Michael<br><br>          in  mainstream classes for  all subjects,  and made  the resource<br><br>          room available for up to three hours per week, as needed.  <br><br>               Michael did not make much use of the resource room the first<br><br>          semester.  His grades plummeted in the ensuing semesters.  As his<br><br><br>                                          4<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          grades fell,  Michael's time in the resource  room was increased,<br><br>          reaching four hours per week by March 1986. <br><br>               During the summer of 1986, the Dobrowolskis enrolled Michael<br><br>          at  the Learning Skills Academy,  a private special education day<br><br>          school, where he was tutored in math,  social communication, peer<br><br>          relation  skills,   and  reading.      Michael  apparently   made<br><br>          significant progress there, and it appears  that this contrast to<br><br>          his performance at  Hampton led the Dobrowolskis to  question the<br><br>          wisdom of Michael's continued enrollment in the public school.<br><br>               In  August 1986,  Mrs.  Dobrowolski  was  told by  Mrs.  Lee<br><br>          Cooper,  Hampton's director of  special education, that Michael's<br><br>          IEP  for sixth  grade could  be the  same as  that for  the fifth<br><br>          grade, since federal  law does  not require more  than an  annual<br><br>          review of  an IEP, and the  fifth grade IEP had  been modified in<br><br>          March  1986.   Mrs. Cooper  also told  Mrs. Dobrowolski  that the<br><br>          district nonetheless would review  Michael's IEP during the first<br><br>          week  of  school.   On  September  2,  however, Mrs.  Dobrowolski<br><br>          informed  Hampton that  she  unilaterally had  decided to  enroll<br><br>          Michael at Learning Skills Academy.  <br><br>               Meetings were held  on September 4, 1986,  and September 11,<br><br>          1986.  The IEP developed as  a result of these meetings  provided<br><br>          for another increase in resource room time.  It also provided for<br><br>          modifications  in Michael's  mainstream  academic  classes.   The<br><br>          modifications  included  preferential  seating, teacher  cues  to<br><br>          Michael  to  pay  attention,  guidance  to  assist  him  in  time<br><br>          management, and short term goals with frequent checkups.  <br><br><br>                                          5<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>               The  Dobrowolskis disagreed  with this IEP,  as well  as the<br><br>          revisions  presented  at  meetings   in  October,  November,  and<br><br>          December  of 1986.    The Dobrowolskis  requested  a due  process<br><br>          hearing in  January  1987.   That  request  was  later  withdrawn<br><br>          without  prejudice.   The Dobrowolskis  refiled their  request in<br><br>          September  1987, contesting both the 1986-87 IEP and the IEP that<br><br>          had  been prepared for the 1987-88 school year.  Michael remained<br><br>          at the  Learning  Skills Academy  during  the sixth  and  seventh<br><br>          grades.  The parents sought reimbursement for the cost of tuition<br><br>          at and transportation to the private school.  Their challenge was<br><br>          based on claims of both  substantive and procedural violations of<br><br>          the Act.<br><br>               A  due  process  hearing was  held  before  a  State of  New<br><br>          Hampshire hearing officer  in February  and March of  1988.   The<br><br>          hearing officer found that the IEPs Hampton offered for the 1986-<br><br>          87  and  1987-88 school  years were  inappropriate.   Finding the<br><br>          program provided at the  Learning Skills Academy appropriate, the<br><br>          hearing officer ordered Hampton to reimburse the Dobrowolskis for<br><br>          their  expenses.    The  hearing  officer  did  not  address  the<br><br>          Dobrowolskis'  claims of procedural violations.  Hampton appealed<br><br>          the administrative  decision to the United  States District Court<br><br>          for the District  of New Hampshire.   After a short bench  trial,<br><br>          the district court overturned  the hearing officer's decision and<br><br>          entered judgment for Hampton.   <br><br>               The  district  court  found  that  the  September  1986  IEP<br><br>          contrasted sharply  with the  one developed in  October 1985  and<br><br><br>                                          6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          modified in  March 1986, and that  the individualized instruction<br><br>          offered  by this  IEP \"likely  would have  yielded more  positive<br><br>          academic results than did the previous IEPs.\"  The district court<br><br>          further found that the IEP proposed for 1987-88 was substantially<br><br>          similar  to the  1986-87 IEP.   The  court acknowledged  that due<br><br>          weight  must be accorded the decision of the hearing officer, but<br><br>          found that reversal of  the administrative decision was warranted<br><br>          because the preponderance of the evidence indicated that the IEPs<br><br>          for  the  1986-87  and  1987-88  school  years  offered  programs<br><br>          reasonably calculated to yield  educational benefits in the least<br><br>          restrictive environment.  <br><br>                                  Trial-Level Review<br>                                  Trial-Level Review<br><br>               The  Act provides that, in reviewing the decision of a state<br><br>          hearing officer, the district court \"shall receive the records of<br><br>          the administrative proceedings, shall hear additional evidence at<br><br>          the  request  of  a  party,  and,  basing  its  decision  on  the<br><br>          preponderance of  the evidence,  shall grant such  relief as  the<br><br>          court determines is appropriate.\"   20 U.S.C.   1415(e)(2).

The<br><br>          court properly  articulated the governing legal  issue as whether<br><br>          the IEPs \"guarantee  some 'reasonable probability of  educational<br><br>          benefit  with sufficient supportive  services at  public expense'<br><br>          ...  in the least restrictive  environment.\"  The  program at the<br><br>          Learning  Skills Academy may have  provided Michael with a better<br><br>          education than that offered by the public school.  As long as the<br><br>          IEPs proposed  by Hampton  met the  minimum  federal standard  of<br><br>          appropriateness,  however,  the  Act   does  not  require  school<br><br>          districts to  reimburse parents  who choose a  superior placement<br><br>          for their  child.

Our  focus<br><br>          is  on  whether  the   evidence  supports  the  district  court's<br><br>          conclusion that Hampton's IEPs for the 1986-87 and 1987-88 school<br><br>          years were  reasonably calculated to  confer educational benefits<br><br><br>                                          9<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          in the least  restrictive environment.   If the district  court's<br><br>          ultimate conclusion regarding the  appropriateness of the IEPs is<br><br>          not  clearly erroneous, we will not reverse that judgment even if<br><br>          there were technical  errors that do  not affect the  substantial<br><br>          rights of the parties.

Thus, the specific factual findings of the<br><br>          district court  are to be set  aside only if, upon  review of the<br><br>          entire  record, we are left with the definite and firm conviction<br><br>          that a mistake has been committed.<br><br>               Our  review  of the  record as  a  whole indicates  that the<br><br>          district  court  did  not  commit clear  error.    The  following<br><br>          evidence presented to the  district court supports its conclusion<br><br>          that  the IEPs Hampton offered for the 1986-87 and 1987-88 school<br><br>          years were appropriate:<br><br>               First, there  was evidence of Michael's  progress at Hampton<br><br>          during the first quarter of fifth grade.  This was achieved  with<br><br>          minimal   resource    room   support   and    minimal   classroom<br><br>          modifications.<br><br><br><br><br>                                          10<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>               Second, there  was evidence  that Michael's  problems during<br><br>          the remainder of fifth grade centered around inattention, lack of<br><br>          motivation, and failure to complete homework assignments.<br><br>               Third, the IEPs  Hampton offered for  the sixth and  seventh<br><br>          grades offered more services than the IEPs  which governed during<br><br>          the  fifth grade,  and addressed  the attention,  motivation, and<br><br>          homework issues.<br><br>               Fourth,  school district  witnesses testified  that children<br><br>          with disabilities similar  to or more severe  than Michael's have<br><br>          made educational  progress at Hampton in programs  similar to the<br><br>          programs offered to Michael in the 1986-87 and 1987-88 IEPs.<br><br>               Fifth,  that  testimony  was  corroborated  by  professional<br><br>          literature   indicating  that  children  with  mild  to  moderate<br><br>          learning  disabilities  generally  make as  much  educational and<br><br>          emotional  progress  in  mainstream or  mainstream/resource  room<br><br>          programs,  with  adequate support,  as  in  full time  segregated<br><br>          classes or private schools devoted to children with disabilities.<br><br>               Finally, evidence was introduced to show that the IEPs which<br><br>          Hampton offered Michael for the 1986-87 and 1987-88 school  years<br><br>          reflected  an  established method  for  controlling an  attention<br><br>          deficit disorder without medication.  <br><br>               In light of the  foregoing evidence, we cannot say  that the<br><br>          district court committed clear error in concluding  that the IEPs<br><br>          Hampton offered were appropriate.   The specific factual findings<br><br>          to which the Dobrowolskis attempt to assign error either were not<br><br>          clearly  erroneous or were  not integral to  the court's ultimate<br><br><br>                                          11<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the IEPs.

The district court<br><br>          disposed  of   the   Dobrowolskis'  allegations   of   procedural<br><br>          violations as follows:<br><br>               Defendants  allege  that   Hampton  failed  to   follow<br>               procedures  required by the  Act.   However, defendants<br>               have  provided  no  examples   or  proof  of  any  such<br>               violations and the court will not sua sponte search the<br>                                                 __________<br>               record  for procedural  errors.

Their trial<br><br>          brief  directed  the  court's   attention  to  pleadings  in  the<br><br>          administrative   record  which   recited  their   contentions  of<br><br>          procedural noncompliance  in detail.

The procedural flaws alleged<br><br>          by the Dobrowolskis did not  render the challenged IEPs  invalid.<br><br>          An  IEP will be set aside for procedural violations only if there<br><br>          is \"some  rational basis to believe  that procedural inadequacies<br><br>          compromised  the  pupil's  right  to  an  appropriate  education,<br><br>          seriously hampered the parents' opportunity to participate in the<br><br>          formulation  process,  or  caused  a  deprivation  of educational<br><br>          benefits.\"  Roland  M. v.

A number of the Dobrowolskis' claims refer to actions of<br><br>          Hampton that occurred well before the 1986-87  and 1987-88 school<br><br>          years, such as their  mishandling of Michael's records and  their<br><br>          failure to provide needed services in the fall  of 1985.  Because<br><br>          these  alleged  procedural  violations  occurred  outside  of the<br><br><br>                                          14<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          relevant time frame,  they cannot provide  the basis for  setting<br><br>          aside the IEPs at issue.<br><br>               Those  flaws argued by the Dobrowolskis  that do address the<br><br>          1986-87  and  1987-88 IEPs  also  fail  to  provide  grounds  for<br><br>          reversal.   Although the IEPs may  have been written by  a single<br><br>          member of Michael's IEP team, the record indicates that they were<br><br>          developed  through  a  team  effort  which  included  input  from<br><br>          Michael's parents and former teachers.  It is permissible for one<br><br>          person to draft the IEP as long as the parents are not denied the<br><br>          opportunity  to participate, and the members of the IEP team have<br><br>          an opportunity to discuss and amend the IEP.  Roland M., 910 F.2d<br>                                                        _________<br><br>          at 994; see also 34 C.F.R. Part 300 App.C,   55.  <br>                  ________<br><br>               The  Dobrowolskis'  also argue  that  reversal is  warranted<br><br>          because   Hampton  had  determined   Michael's  placement  before<br><br>          developing his IEP, in violation of regulations promulgated under<br><br>          the Act which require a student's  placement to be \"based on\" the<br><br>          IEP.   34 C.F.R.  300.552(a)(2).  This argument must fail because<br><br>          the procedural inadequacy alleged did not result in a deprivation<br><br>          of Michael's right to an appropriate education or of the parents'<br><br>          right to  participate in the IEP process.   In summary, any error<br><br>          committed by  the  district  court  in refusing  to  address  the<br><br>          Dobrowolskis' claims of procedural violations was harmless.<br><br>                                   Burden of Proof<br>                                   Burden of Proof<br><br>               The  burden of proof at trial was  on the school district as<br><br>          the party challenging the hearing officer's decision.  See Roland<br>                                                                 ___ ______<br><br>          M., 910 F.2d at 991.  The district court specifically stated that<br>          __<br><br><br>                                          15<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>          it was placing the burden on the school district.   We reject the<br><br>          Dobrowolskis'  contention that  the district  court actually  did<br><br>          something other than that which it said it was doing.<br><br>                         Admission of Deposition Transcripts<br>                         Admission of Deposition Transcripts<br><br>               Although the Dobrowolskis arguably are correct in contending<br><br>          that  the district  court committed  error when it  admitted into<br><br>          evidence the discovery  depositions of Dr.  Clara Maslow and  Dr.<br><br>          George  Storm, we  need not  decide the  point because  the trial<br><br>          court ultimately disregarded this evidence.   In its trial brief,<br><br>          Hampton relied  on the trial deposition  transcripts to criticize<br><br>          the reports of Maslow and Storm, the Dobrowolskis' experts, which<br><br>          had been  admitted in the  administrative hearing.   The district<br><br>          court responded to those arguments in a footnote which reads:<br><br>               The School District has criticized the Storm and Maslow<br>               reports and claims their  evaluations were faulty.  The<br>               court  finds  these  criticisms  immaterial  given  the<br>               relatively little  weight assigned to  [the reports] by<br>               the hearing  officer.   Furthermore, even  assuming the<br>               complete accuracy of those reports, the court finds the<br>               IEPs offered by Hampton were appropriate.<br><br>          This  is  the only  reference the  court  made to  the deposition<br><br>          transcripts.  It  is clear  from the court's  statement that  the<br><br>          deposition   transcripts   were   unnecessary   to   the  court's<br><br>          determination concerning  the appropriateness  of the IEPs.   Any<br><br>          error committed in the admission of the transcripts was harmless.<br><br>          See Puerto Rico Ports Auth. v.
