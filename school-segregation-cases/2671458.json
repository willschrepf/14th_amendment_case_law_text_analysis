Because the concerns that spurred the\noriginal bar remain as important today as when the statute was\nenacted, and because the statute is closely drawn to avoid\nunnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms, we reject the\nplaintiffs’ challenge.\n\n                                 I\n\n       The statute at issue, 52 U.S.C. § 30119(a)(1), makes it\nunlawful for any person “who enters into any contract with the\nUnited States . . . directly or indirectly to make any contribution\n. . . to any political party, committee, or candidate for public\noffice or to any person for any political purpose.” This\nprohibition applies “between the commencement of negotiations\n. . . and . . . the completion of performance” of the contract. Id.\nThe Federal Election Commission (FEC) has construed the\nsection not to apply “in connection with State or local\nelections.” 11 C.F.R. § 115.2(a).\n\f                                 3\n\n     The plaintiffs are three individuals who hold or have held\nfederal contracts. The first two, Lawrence Brown and Jan\nMiller, spent much of their careers as full-time employees of the\nU.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Each\nwent back to work at USAID under a personal services contract\nafter retirement. The third plaintiff, Wendy Wagner, is a law\nprofessor. In 2011, the Administrative Conference of the United\nStates (ACUS) hired Wagner under a consulting contract to\nprepare a report about science and regulation.\n\n     All three plaintiffs wanted to make campaign contributions\nduring the 2012 federal elections, but each was barred from\ndoing so by § 30119. On October 19, 2011, they filed suit\nagainst the FEC in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia, challenging the statute’s constitutionality.\nThe plaintiffs contend that § 30119 violates their rights under\nboth the First Amendment and the equal protection component\nof the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.\n\n     The plaintiffs have been careful to frame their challenge\nnarrowly. First, they challenge the constitutionality of § 30119\n“only as it applies to plaintiffs and other individual contractors,”\nnot as it applies to contractors that are corporations or other\nkinds of entities. Pls. Br. 1. Second, they do not challenge the\nstatute as the FEC might seek to apply it to a contractor’s\nindependent expenditures on electoral advocacy, as opposed to\nhis or her contributions to candidates, parties, or political action\ncommittees (PACs). Id. at 40 n.5 (stating that the “[p]laintiffs\nhave no interest in making independent expenditures”); Oral\nArg. Recording 26:59-27:06 (same). Nor do they challenge the\nlaw as the Commission might seek to apply it to donations to\nPACs that themselves make only independent expenditures,\ncommonly known as “Super PACs.” Oral Arg. Recording\n25:59-26:33 (“Super PACs . . . . are not at issue here; none of\nmy clients wants to make a contribution to them or anything like\n\f                                 4\n\nthem.”); id. 26:59-27:06 (same). In short, the plaintiffs\nchallenge § 30119 only insofar as it bans campaign\ncontributions by individual contractors to candidates, parties, or\ntraditional PACs that make contributions to candidates and\nparties.\n\n     After considering the merits of this challenge, the district\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of the FEC. Wagner\nv. FEC, 901 F. Supp. 2d 101, 113 (D.D.C. 2012). On appeal, a\npanel of this court held, sua sponte, that the district court lacked\njurisdiction to reach the merits of the constitutional claims\nbecause the special judicial review provision of the Federal\nElection Campaign Act (FECA) “grants exclusive merits\njurisdiction to the en banc court of appeals.” Wagner v. FEC,\n717 F.3d 1007, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citing 2 U.S.C. § 437h,\nnow codified at 52 U.S.C. § 30110). The panel therefore\nremanded the case to the district court to make appropriate\nfindings of fact, and then to certify those facts and the relevant\nconstitutional questions to this court sitting en banc. Id. at 1017.\n\n      The case has now returned to us. But time does not stand\nstill, and some important facts have shifted in the years since\nthis litigation began. The plaintiffs advise us that both Wagner\nand Brown have now completed their federal contracts and\nhence are once again free to make campaign contributions. See\nBrown Supp. Mootness Decl. ¶ 3; Second Wagner Supp. Decl.\n¶ 2. Brown, at least, has already done so. See Brown Supp.\nMootness Decl. ¶ 3. Accordingly, Wagner’s and Brown’s\nclaims are moot. See, e.g., Arizonans for Official English v.\nArizona, 520 U.S. 43, 67-72 (1997) (holding that the plaintiff’s\ndeparture from her position as a state employee mooted her First\n\f                                   5\n\nAmendment challenge to a law regulating the speech of state\nemployees).1\n\n     Miller’s contract is ongoing, however, and his constitutional\nclaims therefore remain alive. But the mootness of the other\nplaintiffs’ claims matters because Miller’s injury is notably\nnarrower than theirs. Whereas Wagner and Brown alleged that\nthey wanted to support a variety of political “causes,” and that\nthey had given to “PACs” or “political committees” in the past,\nMiller tells us only that he wants to contribute to “candidates\nrunning for federal offices and/or their political parties.”\nCompare Wagner Decl. ¶ 6, and Brown Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8, with\nMiller Decl. ¶ 7. Miller thus has standing to challenge the\nstatute only as it applies to contributions to candidates and\nparties. See Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008)\n(“[S]tanding is not dispensed in gross. Rather, a plaintiff must\ndemonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press . . . .”\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n\n     1\n       Although Wagner’s ACUS contract is her first, she says that she\n“expect[s]” to “be offered other similar opportunities in the future”\nbecause her area of expertise “is a very important topic for federal\nregulatory agencies.” Wagner Decl. ¶ 4. Brown also plans to seek\nfuture work with the federal government, “either as an employee or as\na contractor,” and therefore “may or may not be subject to” § 30119\nat some future point. Brown Supp. Mootness Decl. ¶ 4. These\npossibilities are too speculative to sustain a concrete interest in this\nlitigation. See Munsell v. Dep’t of Agric., 509 F.3d 572, 582-83 (D.C.\nCir. 2007) (holding “that a live controversy is not maintained by\nspeculation that claimant might reenter a business that it has left”\n(citing City News & Novelty, Inc. v. City of Waukesha, 531 U.S. 278,\n283-84 (2001))). Neither Brown nor Wagner has argued that his or\nher injury, though capable of repetition, will evade review unless we\nmake an exception to the ordinary rule of mootness. Cf. Spencer v.\nKemna, 523 U.S. 1, 17 (1998) (explaining the situations in which that\nexception applies).\n\f                                  6\n\n     Our limited jurisdiction therefore narrows the plaintiffs’\nalready-narrow challenge even further: the only issue properly\nbefore us is the application of § 30119 to contributions by an\nindividual contractor to a federal candidate or political party. In\nParts II through V, we address the plaintiffs’ First Amendment\narguments. In Part VI, we consider their equal protection\narguments.2\n\n                                  II\n\n     Since Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court has instructed us\nto review different kinds of campaign finance regulations with\ndifferent degrees of scrutiny. 424 U.S. 1, 19-25, 44-45 (1976);\nsee McCutcheon v. FEC, 134 S. Ct. 1434, 1444 (2014) (plurality\nopinion); McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 134-38 (2003),\noverruled in part on other grounds by Citizens United v. FEC,\n558 U.S. 310 (2010). Laws that limit a person’s independent\nexpenditures on electoral advocacy are subject to strict scrutiny.\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at 44-\n45). Under that standard, “the Government may regulate\nprotected speech only if such regulation promotes a compelling\ninterest and is the least restrictive means to further the\narticulated interest.” Id.; see, e.g., Citizens United, 558 U.S. at\n339-41.\n\n     Laws that regulate campaign contributions, however, are\nsubject to “a lesser but still ‘rigorous standard of review,’”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n29), because “contributions lie closer to the edges than to the\ncore of political expression,” FEC v. Beaumont, 539 U.S. 146,\n\n\n     2\n      We continue to describe the arguments as those of the\n“plaintiffs,” notwithstanding that only a single plaintiff’s arguments\nremain alive, because the plaintiffs presented their arguments\ncollectively in a single set of briefs and oral arguments.\n\f                                  7\n\n161 (2003). “Under that standard, ‘[e]ven a significant\ninterference with protected rights of political association may be\nsustained if the State demonstrates a sufficiently important\ninterest and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary\nabridgment of associational freedoms.’” McCutcheon, 134 S.\nCt. at 1444 (emphasis added) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25);\nsee Beaumont, 539 U.S. at 161-62; SpeechNow.org v. FEC, 599\nF.3d 686, 692 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (en banc).\n\n     The Supreme Court has repeatedly applied this “closely\ndrawn” standard to challenges to campaign contribution\nrestrictions.3 And it has repeatedly (and recently) declined\ninvitations “to revisit Buckley’s distinction between contributions\nand expenditures and the corollary distinction in the applicable\nstandards of review,” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1445.4 So, too,\nhave we. See, e.g., SpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696.\n\n\n     3\n      See, e.g., McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1446-62 (aggregate\ncontribution limits); Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 246-63 (2006)\n(plurality opinion) (state contribution limits); McConnell, 540 U.S. at\n231-32 (2003) (ban on contributions by minors); Beaumont, 539 U.S.\nat 161-63 (2003) (ban on corporate contributions); FEC v. Colo.\nRepublican Fed. Campaign Comm., 533 U.S. 431, 456-65 (2001)\n(limits on party expenditures that are coordinated with candidates);\nNixon v. Shrink Mo. Gov’t PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 386-95 (2000) (state\ncontribution limits); Cal. Med. Ass’n v. FEC, 453 U.S. 182, 196-99\n(1981) (plurality opinion) (limits on contributions to multicandidate\ncommittees).\n     4\n       See, e.g., Shrink Mo. Gov’t PAC, 528 U.S. at 406-10 (Kennedy,\nJ., dissenting); Colo. Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC, 518\nU.S. 604, 635-640 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment and\ndissenting in part); see also SpeechNow.org, 599 F.3d at 696 (noting\nthat the “Citizens United Court avoided ‘reconsider[ing] whether\ncontribution limits should be subjected to rigorous First Amendment\nscrutiny’” (quoting Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 359)).\n\f                                 8\n\n     The plaintiffs argue that we should nonetheless apply strict\nscrutiny here because § 30119 does not merely limit\ncontributions, but bans them entirely. As the plaintiffs\nrecognize, however, the Supreme Court expressly rejected this\nargument in FEC v. Beaumont, concluding that both limits and\nbans on contributions are subject to the same “closely drawn”\nstandard. 539 U.S. at 161-63. “This argument,” the Court said,\n“overlooks the basic premise we have followed in setting First\nAmendment standards for reviewing political financial\nrestrictions: the level of scrutiny is based on the importance of\nthe ‘political activity at issue’ to effective speech or political\nassociation.” Id. at 161 (quoting FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life,\nInc., 479 U.S. 238, 259 (1986)). “It is not that the difference\nbetween a ban and a limit is to be ignored; it is just that the time\nto consider it is when applying scrutiny at the level selected, not\nin selecting the standard of review itself.” Id. at 162. Indeed,\nalthough the plaintiffs insist that “[t]he closest case” to this one\nis McConnell v. FEC, which struck down a ban on contributions\nby persons under the age of eighteen, Pls. Br. 39, McConnell\nitself applied the “closely drawn” test, citing Beaumont. See\nMcConnell, 540 U.S. at 231-32.\n\n     The plaintiffs further maintain that Citizens United v. FEC\n“casts doubt” on Beaumont. Pls. Br. 40. We do not see the\nbasis for that claim. The plaintiffs correctly note that Citizens\nUnited “applied strict scrutiny to the ban on for-profit corporate\nindependent expenditures.” Id. But the reason for applying\nstrict scrutiny was not that the case involved a ban, but that it\ninvolved independent expenditures rather than contributions.\nSee 558 U.S. at 359. Accordingly, the “closely drawn” standard\nremains the appropriate one for review of a ban on campaign\ncontributions. See Republican Nat’l Comm. v. FEC, 698 F.\nSupp. 2d 150, 156 (D.D.C.), summ. aff’d, 561 U.S. 1040 (2010);\nYamada v. Snipes, No. 12-17845, 2015 WL 2384944, at *19 &\nn.17 (9th Cir. May 20, 2015); Preston v. Leake, 660 F.3d 726,\n\f                                 9\n\n734-35 (4th Cir. 2011); Green Party of Conn. v. Garfield, 616\nF.3d 189, 199 (2d Cir. 2010).\n\n     There is one respect, however, in which the “closely drawn”\nstandard may not be a perfect fit for this case. But that\nconsideration would cut in favor of a more, rather than less,\ndeferential standard of review. Section 30119 is a restriction on\nFirst Amendment activity aimed only at those who choose to\nwork for the federal government. To be sure, citizens do not\ncheck their First Amendment rights at the agency door.5\nNonetheless, the Court has “consistently given greater deference\nto government predictions of harm used to justify restriction of\nemployee speech than to predictions of harm used to justify\nrestrictions on the speech of the public at large.” Bd. of Cnty.\nComm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 676 (1996) (internal\nquotation marks omitted); see, e.g., U.S. Civil Serv. Comm’n v.\nNat’l Ass’n of Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. 548, 566-67 (1973);\nUnited Pub. Workers of Am. v. Mitchell, 330 U.S. 75, 99 (1947).\nIn so doing, the Court has held that the government may\n“maintain a statutory restriction on employee speech” if it is\n“able to satisfy a balancing test of the Pickering form.” United\nStates v. Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union (NTEU), 513 U.S. 454,\n467 (1995) (referring to Pickering v. Bd. of Educ. of Twp. High\nSch. Dist. 205, 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968)).6\n\n    5\n      See Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. 668, 674 (1996)\n(noting that the Court’s “precedents have long since rejected Justice\nHolmes’ famous dictum, that a policeman ‘may have a constitutional\nright to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be a\npoliceman’” (quoting McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford, 29 N.E.\n517, 517 (Mass. 1892))).\n    6\n     Under the Pickering test, a court must “‘arrive at a balance\nbetween the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting\nupon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an\nemployer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it\n\f                               10\n\n     Although the plaintiffs are contractors rather than\nemployees, they acknowledge that their positions are often\nindistinguishable from those of employees. Pls. Br. 17, 19; see\nMiller Decl. ¶¶ 6-7 (stating that “the nature of the work\nperformed by an individual rarely varied depending on whether\nthe person was an employee or a contractor,” and that “in almost\nevery respect” his relationship to his agency and supervisor is\n“identical” to that of an employee); see also District Court\nFindings of Fact ¶ 13 [hereinafter D. Ct. Findings]. In fact, two\nof the plaintiffs “are retired employees from the same agency\nwhere they [were hired as] contractual consultants [to] do much\nthe same work they previously did.” Pls. Br. 35-36. The\nplaintiffs further acknowledge, in light of the case law described\nabove, that Congress has greater latitude to restrict the\nexpression of both employees and government contractors than\nit does with respect to the general public. See Oral Arg.\nRecording 6:00-08, 14:21-33. Indeed, the Court has expressly\nextended the Pickering balancing test to cases involving\ngovernment contractors. See Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 684-85\n(holding that there is no “difference of constitutional magnitude\nbetween independent contractors and employees” in the context\nof a speech-retaliation claim, and “that the same form of\n[Pickering] balancing analysis should apply to each” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)); see also O’Hare Truck\nServ., Inc. v. City of Northlake, 518 U.S. 712, 719-20 (1996).\n\n     To resolve this case, we need not precisely parse the way in\nwhich the “closely drawn” standard intersects with or differs\nfrom the Pickering balancing test. It will suffice for us to\nproceed under the rubric of the former, since it is -- if anything\n-- the less deferential standard. In doing so, however, we will\ntake into account the considerations that the Supreme Court has\n\n\nperforms through its employees.’” NTEU, 513 U.S. at 465-66\n(quoting Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568).\n\f                                11\n\nindicated are particularly relevant in evaluating restrictions the\ngovernment imposes in its role as employer. We therefore now\nproceed to examine whether, with respect to § 30119, the\ngovernment has “‘demonstrate[d] a sufficiently important\ninterest and employ[ed] means closely drawn to avoid\nunnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.’”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n25).\n\n                                III\n\n     Our initial responsibility under the “closely drawn” standard\nis to determine whether the government has advanced a\n“sufficiently important interest” in support of § 30119. The\nFEC argues that there are two such interests, each of which has\nbeen accepted by the Supreme Court as sufficient to warrant\nappropriate restrictions on First Amendment rights. We briefly\naddress the sufficiency of each of those interests in the abstract,\nbefore turning to whether they are properly invoked in light of\nthe particular problems that § 30119 addresses.\n\n                                A\n\n    The two interests asserted by the government are: (1)\nprotection against quid pro quo corruption and its appearance,\nand (2) protection against interference with merit-based public\nadministration.\n\n     The first interest is the most significant, as the Supreme\nCourt has repeatedly held that “the Government’s interest in\npreventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance [is]\n‘sufficiently important’” to justify the regulation of campaign\ncontributions. McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1445 (quoting\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27). In fact, the Court has “stated that\nthe same interest may properly be labeled ‘compelling,’ so that\n\f                                12\n\nthe interest would satisfy even strict scrutiny.” Id. at 1445\n(citing FEC v. Nat’l Conservative Political Action Comm., 470\nU.S. 480, 496-97 (1985)). As the Court has explained, “[t]hat\nLatin phrase captures the notion of a direct exchange of an\nofficial act for money,” id. at 1441, and such exchanges\nundermine “the integrity of our system of representative\ndemocracy,” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27. “Of almost equal\nconcern [is] . . . the appearance of corruption,” which threatens\n“‘confidence in the system of representative Government.’” Id.\nat 27 (quoting Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 565). Therefore, if\nthe FEC shows that § 30119 furthers the interest in combating\nquid pro quo corruption or its appearance, that will suffice to\nclear the “closely drawn” standard’s first hurdle.7\n\n     The second interest is also significant, and in combination\nwith the first makes this case even stronger for the FEC.\nAlthough the Supreme Court has identified no congressional\nobjective beyond protection against quid pro quo corruption and\nits appearance that warrants imposing campaign finance\nrestrictions on the citizenry at large, see McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct.\nat 1450; Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 359, it has “upheld a\nnarrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the\ndisadvantage of certain persons, . . . . based on an interest in\nallowing governmental entities to perform their functions,”\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 341 (citing, inter alia, Letter\nCarriers, 413 U.S. at 557). That narrow class of approved\nspeech restrictions includes the Hatch Act’s limits on political\nactivities by federal employees, which, as the Court put it in\nCitizens United, rest on the principle that “‘[f]ederal service\nshould depend upon meritorious performance rather than\npolitical service.’” 558 U.S. at 341 (quoting Letter Carriers,\n413 U.S. at 557).\n\n\n    7\n      Throughout this opinion, when we use the terms “corruption” or\nits “appearance,” we refer to the quid pro quo variety.\n\f                                 13\n\n     The Court’s cases indicate that this interest in protecting\nmerit-based public administration has two distinct but mutually\nreinforcing components. The first is that the Government\n“operate effectively and fairly,” Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at\n564, which in turn comprises a series of interrelated concerns.\nThe “‘interest of the [government], as an employer, in\npromoting the efficiency of the public services it performs\nthrough its employees,’” id. (emphasis added) (quoting\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568), is perhaps best captured by the\nCourt’s rationale for upholding the original 1876 employee\ncontribution ban: “If . . . a refusal [to make political\ncontributions] may lead to putting good men out of the service,\nliberal payments may be made the ground for keeping poor ones\nin.” Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. 371, 375 (1882). The related\ninterest in operating fairly is the “great end of Government -- the\nimpartial execution of the laws.” Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at\n565. “It seems fundamental,” the Court has said, that “those\nworking for [Government] agencies, should administer the law\nin accordance with the will of Congress, rather than in\naccordance with their own or the will of a political party.” Id.\nat 564-65. In this regard, “it is not only important that the\nGovernment and its employees in fact avoid practicing political\njustice, but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be\navoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative\nGovernment is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.” Id. at\n565.\n\n     The flip side of the interest in governmental efficiency and\nfairness is the employees’ interest in being “sufficiently free\nfrom improper influence” or coercion, which the government\nmay also vindicate on their behalf. Id. As the Court has\nexplained, it upheld the Hatch Act’s restrictions on “political\ncampaigning” by federal employees in part because, in the\nCourt’s “judgment[,] . . . congressional subordination of those\nactivities was permissible to safeguard the core interests of\n\f                                  14\n\nindividual belief and association.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S.\n347, 371 (1976). See NTEU, 513 U.S. at 471 (explaining that\n“the Hatch Act aimed to protect employees’ rights, notably their\nright to free expression, rather than to restrict those rights”);\nLetter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 566 (identifying an interest, “as\nimportant as any other,” in “mak[ing] sure that Government\nemployees would be free from pressure and from express or tacit\ninvitation to . . . perform political chores in order to curry favor\nwith their superiors”); Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. at 374\n(identifying “the protection of those in the public service against\nunjust exactions” as an independently sufficient basis for\nupholding the 1876 statute restricting contributions by federal\nemployees).\n\n     The Supreme Court has repeatedly credited these\n“obviously important interests sought to be served by . . .\nlimitations on partisan political activities,” Letter Carriers, 413\nU.S. at 564, for over a century.8 And there is no reason why\nthey should not be heard in support of restrictions on contractors\nas well as regular employees. Cf. NASA v. Nelson, 562 U.S.\n134, 150 (2011) (rejecting the respondents’ argument that,\n“because they are contract employees and not civil servants, the\nGovernment’s broad authority in managing its affairs should\napply with diminished force”); Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 676-79\n(noting that, under the Pickering balancing test, “‘[t]he\ngovernment’s interest in achieving its goals as effectively and\nefficiently as possible is elevated . . . to a significant one when\nit acts as employer,’” and holding that Pickering applies to\nclaims by independent contractors that they were terminated for\n\n\n\n     8\n     See, e.g., Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 341; NTEU, 513 U.S. at\n471; Elrod, 427 U.S. at 370; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27; Letter Carriers,\n413 U.S. at 557; Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 98; Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. at\n374-75.\n\f                               15\n\ntheir speech (quoting Waters v. Churchill, 511 U.S. 661, 675\n(1994) (plurality opinion))).\n\n     We now proceed to examine whether these two Court-\napproved justifications for limitations on campaign activities --\nto protect against quid pro quo corruption and its appearance,\nand to protect merit-based administration -- are furthered by the\ncontractor contribution statute.\n\n                                B\n\n     We begin with the historical pedigree of § 30119, which\nstretches back to the 1870s. That history demonstrates that\nCongress did indeed aim to protect the two interests articulated\nby the FEC, and that its concerns on both fronts were well\nwarranted.\n\n     1. Congress began to tackle problems related to the political\nactivity of those who work for the government in the late 19th\ncentury. See generally Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 555-60. It\nstarted by prohibiting most federal employees “from requesting,\ngiving to, or receiving from, any other . . . employee of the\nGovernment, any money or property . . . for political purposes.”\nAct of Aug. 15, 1876, ch. 287, § 6, 19 Stat. 143, 169. In\nupholding that early statute as “within the just scope of\nlegislative power,” the Supreme Court declared that its “evident\npurpose” was “to promote efficiency and integrity in the\ndischarge of official duties” and “to protect the classes of . . .\nemployees provided for from being compelled to make\ncontributions for [political] purposes through fear of dismissal\nif they refused.” Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. at 373-74.\n\n    The 1876 statute was limited to employees of the Executive\nBranch. In the 1883 Pendleton Act, Congress took the next step,\nmaking it a crime for its own members, among others, to “solicit\n\f                                 16\n\nor receive” political contributions from federal workers, ch. 27,\n§ 11, 22 Stat. 403, 406, and for those workers to “give or hand\nover” such contributions, id. § 14, 22 Stat. at 407.9 The\nPendleton Act further declared that “no person in the public\nservice is for that reason under any obligations to contribute to\nany political fund.” Id. § 2, 22 Stat. at 404. And it “authorized\nthe President to promulgate rules to carry the Act into effect and\ncreated the Civil Service Commission as the agency or\nadministrator of the Act.” Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 558.\n\n     In 1925, Congress broadened the ban to include solicitation\nand receipt by congressional challengers as well as incumbents,\nwhile continuing to tweak the range of forbidden donors. See\nFederal Corrupt Practices Act, 1925, ch. 368, sec. 312, § 118, 43\nStat. 1070, 1073. When Congressman Harry Wurzbach was\nsubsequently indicted for receiving contributions from federal\nemployees, the Supreme Court again upheld the statute as a\nproper exercise of Congress’ powers. United States v.\nWurzbach, 280 U.S. 396 (1930); see Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 98.\n\n    Alongside these early bans on campaign contributions,\nCongress and the Executive Branch incrementally expanded the\nscope of the nascent civil service system, imposing limitations\non political activity by employees and implementing merit-\nbased hiring rules. See Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 557-60.\n\n\n     9\n      Because the Pendleton Act prohibited accepting contributions\nfrom “any person receiving any salary or compensation from moneys\nderived from the Treasury of the United States,” id. § 11, 22 Stat. at\n406, it textually encompassed contributions from the various\ngovernment contractors of the era -- ranging from experts hired to\nsurvey Indian lands, see Contract for Surveying Public Lands, 10 Op.\nAtt’y Gen. 261, 261 (1862), to a contractor hired to make copies of\npatent drawings for the Commissioner of Patents, see Letting\nContracts--Advertisement, 15 Op. Att’y Gen. 538 (1876).\n\f                                17\n\nThose efforts culminated in the Hatch Act of 1939, which aimed\nto consolidate civil service reforms and “to combat\ndemonstrated ill effects of Government employees’ partisan\npolitical activities.” NTEU, 513 U.S. at 471. As the Court has\nexplained, Congress’ purpose was to protect merit-based\nadministration, including ensuring governmental efficiency and\nfairness and shielding government personnel from political\ncoercion. See Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 564-66.\n\n    The Hatch Act was particularly aimed at certain notorious\nabuses that occurred during the 1936 and 1938 election\ncampaigns. See id. at 559-60. Responding to reports that\nworkers paid by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) had\nbeen coerced to contribute to the Democratic Party, for\nexample,10 the Hatch Act criminalized accepting political\ncontributions from anyone known to be receiving\n“compensation, employment, or other benefit” from work relief\nfunds. Hatch Act, ch. 410, §§ 5, 8, 53 Stat. 1147, 1148.\n\n     The Act imposed other restrictions on political activity by\ngovernment employees as well, including barring them from\n“tak[ing] any active part in political management or in political\ncampaigns.” Id. § 9(a), 53 Stat. at 1148. In subsequently\nupholding those restrictions against a First Amendment\nchallenge, the Supreme Court noted that they were “not\ndissimilar in purpose from the statutes against political\n\n\n    10\n      See, e.g., 84 CONG. REC. 9598 (1939) (statement of Rep.\nTaylor) (reporting that WPA workers had been required to place $3 to\n$5 out of their $30 monthly pay under a Democratic donkey\npaperweight on their supervisor’s desk); see also REPORT OF THE\nSPECIAL COMM. TO INVESTIGATE SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN\nEXPENDITURES AND USE OF GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS IN 1938, S. REP.\nNO. 76-1, pt. 1, at 8-33, 39 (1939) (recounting WPA abuses and\nrecommending reforms).\n\f                               18\n\ncontributions of money.” Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 98. Congress,\nthe Court said, “recognizes danger to the [civil] service in that\npolitical rather than official effort may earn advancement and to\nthe public in that governmental favor may be channeled through\npolitical connections.” Id. Twenty-six years later, the Court\nagain rejected a First Amendment challenge to the same\nrestrictions. See Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 551.\n\n     Although the 1939 Hatch Act focused on public employees\nand recipients of work relief, exploitation of government\ncontractors drew congressional interest as well. Arguing that the\noriginal bill “does not go far enough,” Congressman J. Will\nTaylor pointed to the coercion of contractors in the “‘celebrated’\nDemocratic campaign book” scandal as a prime example of\n“political immorality and skullduggery that should not be\ntolerated.” 84 CONG. REC. 9598-99 (1939). Representative\nTaylor recounted that, at the behest of the Democratic National\nCommittee, party representatives paid visits to government\ncontractors, reminding each one “of the business he had received\nfrom the Government” and explaining that the contractor was\nexpected to buy a number of the party’s souvenir convention\nbooks -- at $250 each -- “in proportion to the amount of\nGovernment business he had enjoyed.” Id. In addition, “large\nconcerns, which directly or indirectly, benefitted from\nGovernment business, were . . . by sinister methods, convinced\nof the importance of taking advertising space in the book.” Id.;\nsee also 81 CONG. REC. 6429-30 (1937) (statement of Rep.\nTaylor) (citing newspaper report regarding solicitation of\ncontractors in Tennessee). Taylor urged that the bill “should be\namended to include rackets of this character.” 84 CONG. REC.\n9599 (1939).\n\f                                 19\n\n     The next year, as the scandal surrounding the campaign\nbooks persisted,11 Congress took up that task in a package of\namendments to the Hatch Act. Denouncing contracting abuses\nas “[t]he greatest source of corruption in American politics\ntoday,” Senator Harry Byrd argued for a broad amendment that\nwould “prevent those who are making money out of\ngovernmental contracts from making contributions to any\npolitical party,” and thereby “prevent them from making\ncontributions which may be considered in some instances as\nbribery in order to secure governmental contracts for\nthemselves.” 86 CONG. REC. 2982 (1940). Thus, in addition to\nspecifically banning the purchase of goods (such as the\ncampaign books) from political parties, see Act of July 19, 1940,\nch. 640, sec. 4, § 13(c), 54 Stat. 767, 770-71, Congress enacted\nthe general contractor contribution ban that is now before us, id.\n§ 5(a), 54 Stat. at 772.\n\n     The statute that Congress passed in 1940 has retained its\nessential features since that time. Then, as now, it barred any\nperson or firm negotiating or performing a federal contract from\ncontributing “to any political party, committee, or candidate for\npublic office or to any person for any political purpose or use.”\nId. (codified as amended at 52 U.S.C. § 30119(a)(1)).\n\n     2. Just as the Hatch Act was spurred by outrage over\nmisconduct in the 1936 and 1938 elections, “deeply disturbing\nexamples” of corruption “surfacing after the 1972 election” led\nto the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) Amendments of\n\n\n     11\n      See, e.g., 86 CONG. REC. 9362 (1940) (statement of Rep.\nKnutson) (recounting advertising rates for the 1940 Democratic\ncampaign book and speculating that “all of this space will be taken by\nGovernment contractors,” who would be “solicit[ed] . . . at the point\nof a gun”); see also Editorial, That Convention Book, N.Y. TIMES,\nMar. 13, 1940, at 22.\n\f                                 20\n\n1974. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27 & n.28 (citing Buckley v. Valeo,\n519 F.2d 821, 839-840 & nn. 36-38 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (en banc)).\nParticularly important for our purposes, those “disturbing\nexamples” included a variety of efforts to channel government\ncontracts to President Nixon’s political supporters and to exact\ncontributions from existing contractors, both of which figured\nprominently in the Senate Watergate Committee’s report. See,\ne.g., FINAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMM. ON PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES, S. REP. NO. 93-981, at 368 (1974)\n[hereinafter WATERGATE REPORT] (describing the so-called\n“Responsiveness Program,” pursuant to which agencies were to\nensure that “[t]he letting of Government grants, contracts, and\nloans” was directed at “meet[ing] reelection needs”); id. at 412\n(recounting evidence that “campaign officials were participating\nin the selection process for the awards of GSA architectural and\nengineering design contracts”); id. at 1210 & n.85 (separate\nviews of Sen. Weicker) (recounting “evidence of quid pro quos\nfor the contracts from” four cabinet departments and six\nagencies).12\n\n    As the Watergate Committee recognized, much of the\nconduct that it exposed squarely implicated the contractor\ncontribution statute (then 18 U.S.C. § 611). See WATERGATE\nREPORT at 440. The Committee reported that the 1972 election\n\n\n    12\n       See also WATERGATE REPORT at 440 (“There is evidence that\nplans were laid for Government officials and others to solicit\ncampaign contributions from minority recipients of Federal grants,\nloans, and contracts. Moreover, the committee has obtained evidence\nthat these plans were in part consummated.”); id. at 384-85\n(recounting testimony that a contract was awarded to a Nixon\nfundraiser “based solely on political motivations” and “‘rammed down\nthe throats’ of Department officials”). In the passage of our Buckley\nopinion later relied upon by the Supreme Court, this court leaned\nheavily on the Watergate Report. See 519 F.2d at 839 nn.35-36, 38.\n\f                               21\n\ngave rise to the first indictments of contributors under that\nstatute, resulting in guilty pleas and then-maximum fines. Id. at\n486-89. “In view of the abuses discovered,” it recommended\nthat Congress take care not to “lessen the penalties” or otherwise\n“weaken[] . . . the law in this area.” Id. at 444. The Committee\nfurther concluded that the statutory scheme was “deficient in\nfailing to provide a civil penalty,” which made it difficult to\naddress “nonflagrant cases,” and recommended that the new\nFederal Election Commission be given primary civil\nenforcement jurisdiction with respect to, inter alia, the\ncontractor contribution statute. Id. at 566-67.\n\n     A few months after the Watergate Committee made its\nrecommendations, Congress increased the maximum fine for\nviolations of the contractor contribution statute from $5,000 to\n$25,000, see FECA Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-443,\n§ 101(e)(2), 88 Stat. 1263, 1267, and authorized the\nCommission to initiate civil enforcement actions for violations\nof that provision, see id. sec. 208(a), § 314(a)(7), 88 Stat. at\n1285.13 It also strengthened enforcement of the longstanding\nbans on campaign contributions by corporations and labor\nunions. See id. § 101(e)(1), 88 Stat. at 1267; see also Beaumont,\n539 U.S. at 152-53 (recounting the history of those bans). And,\nas is well known, the 1974 amendments also imposed generally\napplicable ceilings on campaign contributions.               See\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1445; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 7.\nFECA’s “primary purpose,” the Court has said, “was to limit\nquid pro quo corruption and its appearance.” McCutcheon, 134\nS. Ct. at 1444 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27).\n\n\n\n\n    13\n      That monetary penalty has since been superseded by FECA’s\nown penalty scheme. See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(a)(5)-(6) (civil\npenalties); id. § 30109(d) (criminal penalties).\n\f                                 22\n\n     Finally, in 1976, Congress incorporated the contractor\ncontribution ban into FECA itself. See FECA Amendments of\n1976, Pub. L. No. 94-283, sec. 112(2), § 322, 90 Stat. 475,\n492-93. Over the subsequent decades, both FECA and the civil\nservice laws have been further amended. Those amendments\nlifted most restrictions on campaign contributions by federal\nemployees.14 At the same time, however, they retained some of\nthe more direct limits on government employees’ political\nactivities, including barring most federal employees from\nsoliciting or accepting political contributions, running for office\nin partisan elections, and hosting political fundraisers. See 5\nU.S.C. §§ 7323(a), 7324(a). The Civil Service Reform Act of\n1978 also afforded federal employees protection against\n“prohibited personnel practices,” 5 U.S.C. § 2302, including\ndiscrimination on the basis of political affiliation and coercion\nto make political contributions, id. § 2302(b)(1)(E), (b)(3), and\nallowed them to seek redress through the Office of Special\nCounsel and the Merit Systems Protection Board, 5 U.S.C.\n§§ 1214-15, 1221. Congress has left the contractor contribution\nban in place, however, without change. See 52 U.S.C. § 30119.\n\n     3. As we have recounted, Congress enacted § 30119 in the\naftermath of a national scandal involving a pay-to-play scheme\nfor federal contracts. The statute was itself the outgrowth of a\ndecades-long congressional effort to prevent corruption and\nensure the merit-based administration of the national\ngovernment. And it was followed by subsequent scandals that\nled to further legislative refinements, again motivated by\nconcerns over corruption and merit protection.\n\n\n\n    14\n      See, e.g., Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. No.\n103-94, sec. 2(a), § 7323, 107 Stat. 1001, 1002 (1993) (codified at 5\nU.S.C. § 7323); id. § 4(b), 107 Stat. at 1005 (codified at 18 U.S.C.\n§ 603(c)).\n\f                                   23\n\n     This historical pedigree is significant. As the Court said in\nBeaumont, “[j]udicial deference is particularly warranted where,\nas here, we deal with a congressional judgment that has\nremained essentially unchanged throughout a century of ‘careful\nlegislative adjustment.’” 539 U.S. at 162 n.9 (quoting FEC v.\nNat’l Right to Work Comm., 459 U.S. 197, 209 (1982)).\nMoreover, as we discuss in Part V below, the lineage of the\nstatute makes clear that its objects are the legitimate and\nimportant purposes that the Commission claims they are.\n\n                                   C\n\n     More recent evidence confirms that human nature has not\nchanged since corrupt quid pro quos and other attacks on merit-\nbased administration first spurred the development of the present\nlegislative scheme. Of course, we would not expect to find --\nand we cannot demand -- continuing evidence of large-scale\nquid pro quo corruption or coercion involving federal contractor\ncontributions because such contributions have been banned\nsince 1940. As the Supreme Court has recognized, “no data can\nbe marshaled to capture perfectly the counterfactual world in\nwhich” an existing campaign finance restriction “do[es] not\nexist.” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1457.15 Instead, “‘the\nquestion is whether experience under the present law confirms\na serious threat of abuse.’” Id. (quoting FEC v. Colo.\nRepublican Fed. Campaign Comm., 533 U.S. 431, 457 (2001)).\n\n\n\n     15\n       See Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. 191, 208 (1992) (plurality\nopinion) (“The fact that these laws have been in effect for a long\nperiod of time also makes it difficult for the States to put on witnesses\nwho can testify as to what would happen without them.”); FEC v.\nColo. Republican Fed. Campaign Comm., 533 U.S. 431, 457 (2001)\n(noting the “difficulty of mustering evidence to support long-enforced\nstatutes” because “there is no recent experience” without them).\n\f                                  24\n\nThe experience of states with and without similar laws is also\nrelevant. See id. at 1451 n.7; Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 357.\n\n     Unfortunately, as was the case with the coordinated\nexpenditure limits at issue in Colorado Republican, “[d]espite\nyears of enforcement of the challenged” contractor contribution\nban, “substantial evidence demonstrates” that individuals and\nfirms continue to “test the limits of the current law[s],” 533 U.S.\nat 457 -- at both the federal and state levels. This experience\nreadily confirms that the government’s fear of the consequences\nof removing the current ban is not unwarranted.\n\n     1. We begin with Congress itself, where a number of\ncorruption scandals point to the danger that contributions from\ngovernment contractors would pose. Indeed, although the\nplaintiffs contend that Members of Congress are insulated from\nthe contracting process, see infra Part III.D.1, many significant\ncongressional corruption cases involve quid pro quo agreements\nregarding contracts. In 2005, for example, Representative\nRandy “Duke” Cunningham pled guilty to accepting millions of\ndollars in bribes in exchange for influencing Defense\nDepartment contract awards. See Plea Agreement at 4-6, ECF\nNo. 40 ex. 2, United States v. Cunningham, No. 3:05-cr-2137\n(S.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2005). Mitchell Wade, the defense\ncontractor who pled guilty to bribing Cunningham, admitted to\nmaking illegal “straw” contributions to two other Members of\nCongress as well, both of whom he targeted for their perceived\n“ability to request appropriations funding that would benefit” his\ncompany. Statement of Offenses at 12, United States v. Wade,\nNo. 1:06-cr-49 (D.D.C. Feb. 24, 2006).16\n\n\n     16\n      Wade and the contracting corporation later agreed to pay a $1\nmillion civil penalty for violating, inter alia, § 30119 (then 2 U.S.C.\n§ 441c). Conciliation Agreement at 6-7, In re MZM, Inc. and Mitchell\nWade, Matter Under Review 5666 (FEC, Oct. 30, 2007).\n\f                               25\n\n     In 2006, Representative Bob Ney similarly pled guilty to a\nseries of quid pro quos with the lobbyist Jack Abramoff,\nincluding steering a “multi-million dollar” contract for a House\nof Representatives infrastructure project to one of Abramoff’s\nclients. See Factual Basis for Plea at 6, United States v. Ney,\nNo. 1:06-cr-272 (D.D.C. Sept. 15, 2006). And in 1981, Senator\nHarrison Williams was convicted on bribery and corruption\ncharges for crimes exposed in the FBI’s Abscam investigation.\nWilliams “agreed to use his position as a United States Senator\nto obtain government contracts” for titanium to be produced by\na mine financed by fictional Arab businessmen. United States\nv. Williams, 529 F. Supp. 1085, 1091 (E.D.N.Y. 1981), aff’d,\n705 F.2d 603 (2d Cir. 1983).\n\n     One might argue from this record that the general ban on\ncontractor contributions is unnecessary prophylaxis: after all,\ncongressmen who enter into quid pro quo agreements go to jail\nanyway. But as the Supreme Court has explained, “laws making\ncriminal the giving and taking of bribes deal with only the most\nblatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence\ngovernmental action.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27-28. Although\nthe criminal cases certainly confirm the appetite for corruption\nin contracting -- and the availability of channels for carrying it\nout -- corruption and its appearance are no doubt more\nwidespread in the contracting process than our criminal dockets\nreflect.\n\n    The Executive Branch is also an obvious site of potential\ncorruption in the contracting process, since its agencies are the\nones that ultimately award contracts. This was a key focus of\ncongressional concern during the Watergate hearings. See supra\nPart III.B.2; see also, e.g., WATERGATE REPORT at 409\n(describing a consultant who “was made to feel that his\ncontinued success in obtaining Government contracts would, in\nsignificant degree, be dependent on his contributing to the\n\f                                  26\n\nPresident’s reelection”).17 Many more recent instances of\ncorruption or its appearance in the agency contracting process\nare collected in the Defense Department’s aptly named\nEncyclopedia of Ethical Failure. See generally DEP’T OF\nDEFENSE, OFFICE OF GEN. COUNSEL, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF\nETHICAL FAILURE 4-58, 77-78, 82, 84-88, 132-46 (updated\n2014).\n\n     2. Further evidence comes from the states, many of which\nhave enacted pay-to-play laws in response to their own recent\nexperiences. At least seventeen states now limit or prohibit\ncampaign contributions from some or all state contractors or\nlicensees.18 The fact that many states have such laws shows that\n\n     17\n       Another notorious pay-to-play contracting scheme of the\nWatergate era involved Vice President Spiro Agnew. In 1973, a\nfederal investigation uncovered evidence that Agnew had accepted\nbribes (including campaign contributions) in exchange for\ninfrastructure contracts while serving as Baltimore County Executive\nand Governor of Maryland -- and that he had continued to request\npayments from contractors as Vice President, “stat[ing] expressly that\nhe hoped to be able to be helpful . . . with respect to the awarding of\nFederal engineering contracts.” Exposition of the Evidence at 3-4,\nUnited States v.

The Attorney General agreed\nthat Agnew could plead nolo contendere to a single count of tax\nevasion if he resigned his office, which he did. See Transcript of Plea\nHearing at 7-8, United States v. Agnew, No. 73-0535 (D. Md. Oct. 10,\n1973), available at http://research.archives.gov/description/279170.\n     18\n       The laws of Hawaii and West Virginia most closely track the\ntext and design of § 30119. See HAW. REV. STAT. § 11-355; W. VA.\nCODE § 3-8-12(d). Other states have tailored their restrictions\ndifferently -- often more broadly than the federal model in some\nrespects, such as by sweeping in the individual principals of\ncontracting firms, and more narrowly in others, such as by targeting\n\f                                 27\n\nthe federal statute is no outlier. Moreover, the corruption\nscandals that prompted the adoption of those laws further\ndemonstrate the dangers that § 30119 helps stave off at the\nfederal level.19\n\n     New Jersey’s law, for example, was enacted in the\naftermath of a state investigation finding that a $392 million\ncontract for a failed project went to a firm that had made\nextensive campaign contributions to state candidates and\npolitical committees. See STATE OF N.J. COMM’N OF\nINVESTIGATION, N.J. ENHANCED MOTOR VEHICLE INSPECTION\nCONTRACT 1-2, 62-65 (2002). Similarly, Illinois’ law was\npassed after former Governor George Ryan was convicted of\nracketeering charges based on his efforts, as Secretary of State,\nto steer state contracts to friendly firms in exchange for financial\nsupport for his gubernatorial campaign.

This court upheld that rule against First\nAmendment challenge in Blount v. SEC, 61 F.3d 938 (D.C. Cir. 1995).\n\f                               28\n\nWarner, 498 F.3d 666, 675 (7th Cir. 2007); see Ray Long,\nIllinois Senate Overrides Blagojevich’s Veto, Enacts ‘Pay-to-\nPlay’ Ethics Law, CHI. TRIB., Sept. 23, 2008, at 1. The law’s\npassage prompted Ryan’s successor, Governor Rod Blagojevich,\nto redouble his efforts to solicit contributions from state\ncontractors before the new rules took effect. See Mike McIntire\n& Jeff Zeleny, Obama’s Intervention for Ethics Bill Indirectly\nLed to Case Against Governor, N.Y. TIMES, Dec. 10, 2008, at\nA32. Those efforts in turn drew the interest of federal\nprosecutors, and Blagojevich was ultimately convicted of\nvarious forms of pay-to-play corruption, including attempting to\nextort campaign contributions from the chief executive of a\nhospital in exchange for raising Medicaid reimbursement rates,\nas well as offenses in connection with his effort to sell a U.S.\nSenate seat. See Jury Verdict, United States v. Blagojevich, No.\n1:08-cr-888 (N.D. Ill. June 27, 2011).\n\n     In 2005, Connecticut passed a Campaign Finance Reform\nAct that prohibited “campaign contributions by state contractors,\nlobbyists, and their families.” Green Party, 616 F.3d at 192. In\nupholding the contractor contribution ban, the Second Circuit\nnoted that it was passed “in response to several corruption\nscandals in Connecticut,” which together had “helped earn the\nstate the nickname ‘Corrupticut.’” Id. at 193 (quoting Green\nParty of Conn. v. Garfield, 616 F.3d 213, 218-19 (2d Cir. 2010))\n(internal quotation marks omitted). As the court detailed:\n\n         The most widely publicized of the scandals involved\n         Connecticut’s former governor, John Rowland. In\n         2004, Rowland was accused of accepting over\n         $100,000 worth of gifts and services from state\n         contractors . . . . Rowland accepted the gifts, it was\n         alleged, in exchange for assisting the contractors in\n         securing lucrative state contracts. Rowland resigned\n         amidst the allegations, and in 2005 pleaded guilty --\n\f                                  29\n\n          along with two aides and several contractors -- to\n          federal charges in connection with the scandal.\n\nId. (quoting Green Party, 616 F.3d at 218-19). In light of that\nexperience, the court found “sufficient evidence” of “actual\ncorruption stemming from contractor contributions,” as well as\n“a manifest need to curtail the appearance of corruption created\nby contractor contributions.” Id. at 200.\n\n     Later, the Second Circuit also upheld New York City’s law\nlimiting contributions by entities “doing business with” the City.\nOgnibene v. Parkes, 671 F.3d 174 (2d Cir. 2011). In so doing,\nthe court noted that there were “actual pay-to-play scandals in\nNew York City in the 1980s,” id. at 188-89, and that there were\n“several recent scandals . . . specifically involv[ing] pay-to-play\ncampaign donations” in New York State, id. at 190 n.15.20\n\n     We could go on. The FEC has assembled an impressive, if\ndismaying, account of pay-to-play contracting scandals, not only\nin the above states, but also in New Mexico, Hawaii, Ohio,\nCalifornia, and elsewhere. See FEC’s Proposed Findings of\n\n\n\n\n     20\n       The plaintiffs point out that, in Lavin v. Husted, the Sixth\nCircuit overturned an Ohio statute that made it a crime for candidates\nfor attorney general or county prosecutor to accept contributions from\nMedicaid providers. 689 F.3d 543 (6th Cir. 2012). The court did so\nbecause, inter alia, the defendant Secretary of State “concede[d] that\nhe ha[d] no evidence at all in support of his theory that [the statute]\nprevent[ed] actual or perceived corruption among prosecutors in\nOhio.” Id. at 547 (emphasis added). As we discuss in the text, that is\nemphatically not the situation here. See also id. (distinguishing Green\nParty on the ground that there the state did have evidence “to\ndemonstrate how its ban on contributions from contractors would help\nbring such scandals to an end”).\n\f                                  30\n\nFact, J.A. 298-313.21 But we think that the evidence canvassed\n\n     21\n       See also, e.g., Yamada, 2015 WL 2384944, at *20 (upholding\nHawaii contractor contribution ban “in light of past ‘pay to play’\nscandals and the widespread appearance of corruption that existed at\nthe time” the ban was passed in 2005); United States v.

The plaintiffs contend that changes in government\ncontracting practices since the 1940s -- especially the advent of\nformalized competitive bidding -- render the current system\n“immune from political interference” in the majority of cases.\nPls. Br. 11. Thus, they maintain, “even if a pay-to-play rationale\nmight have made [the statute] defensible in 1940, the vast\nchanges in federal procurement since then have made it\nindefensible on that basis today.” Id. at 13. We are\nunpersuaded.\n\n    First, the facts that we have recounted above speak for\nthemselves. See supra Part III.C.1. If contracting were truly\nimmune from political interference, for example, Rep.\nCunningham could not have “pressure[d] and influence[d]\nUnited States Department of Defense personnel to award and\nexecute government contracts.” Plea Agreement at 6, United\n\n\nof the contractors’ campaign cash was donated to lawmakers within\na year of their contracts getting approved,” often “months and weeks\nahead of when the contracts were voted on” or even the same day as\nthe vote).\n\f                               32\n\nStates v. Cunningham, No. 3:05-cr-2137 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 28,\n2005). Nor would the myriad of other instances of corruption\nand self-dealing in the contract bidding process have occurred.\nSee generally DEP’T OF DEFENSE, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ETHICAL\nFAILURE 4-58, 77-78, 82, 84-88, 132-46. Moreover, those facts\nare hardly surprising. Although agencies do rely on specialized\ncontracting officers to help ensure independence, contracting\nofficers in turn rely on information about needs and objectives\nprovided by the “customer” agency, which may include input\nfrom political appointees. See D. Ct. Findings ¶ 23 (citing\nSchooner Dep. 110-16). And Members of Congress have many\nopportunities of their own to intercede on behalf of their\nconstituents. See, e.g., MORTON ROSENBERG & JACK H.\nMASKELL, CONG . RESEARCH SERV ., CONGRESSIONAL\nINTERVENTION IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS: LEGAL AND\nETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS 80 (2003); H.R. REP. NO. 113-666,\nat 4 (2014).\n\n     Second, most contracts held by individuals to provide\npersonal services on a regular basis, such as those held by\nplaintiffs Brown and Miller, “‘are not . . . . subject to full and\nopen competition and the full range of rights and responsibilities\nthat follow.’” D. Ct. Findings ¶ 24 (quoting Schooner Dep. 89);\nsee 48 C.F.R. § 13.003(d). Nor is full-blown competitive\nbidding required for contracts with values below the “simplified\nacquisition threshold” -- set at $150,000 in most cases, 48\nC.F.R. § 2.101. See 41 U.S.C. § 1901; 48 C.F.R. § 13.003(a).\nInstead, “‘the government can call two or three people on the\nphone and operate in a very informal manner.’” D. Ct. Findings\n¶ 24 (quoting Schooner Dep. 107-08). Wagner’s contract, for\nexample, was arranged under the simplified acquisition\nprocedures. Id. She was proactively approached by a staff\nmember at ACUS, and then discussed the arrangement with\nACUS’s Chairman, who is appointed by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate. Wagner Decl. ¶ 3. In short, because\n\f                                  33\n\nthe plaintiffs challenge § 30119 as it applies to individual\ncontractors, the competitive bidding regime does little to help\ntheir case.\n\n     Finally, perhaps the most relevant change in government\ncontracting over the past several decades has been the enormous\nincrease in the government’s reliance on contractors to do work\npreviously performed by employees. See Schooner Dep. 35-36,\ncited in D. Ct. Findings ¶ 22.22 If anything, that shift has only\nstrengthened the original rationales for the contractor\ncontribution ban by increasing the number of potential targets of\ncorruption and coercion -- targets who do not have the merit\nsystem protections available to government employees. See 5\nU.S.C. §§ 1214-15, 2301(b)(1)-(2); infra Part V.B.23\n\n     22\n       See also Test. of John K. Needham, Director, Acquisition &\nSourcing Management, Gov’t Accountability Office, S. Hrg. 111-626,\nat 3 (2010) (“[I]t is now commonplace for agencies to use contractors\nto perform activities historically performed by government\nemployees.”); Presidential Memorandum for the Heads of Executive\nDepartments and Agencies on Government Contracting, Mar. 4, 2009\n(noting that spending on government contracts had more than doubled\nsince 2001 and that the line between traditional public functions and\ncontracting functions “has been blurred and inadequately defined”);\nPAUL C. LIGHT, RESEARCH BRIEF: THE NEW TRUE SIZE OF\nGOVERNMENT 1 (2006) (noting that the Bush Administration “has\noverseen the most significant increase in recent history in the largely\nhidden workforce of contractors and grantees who work for the federal\ngovernment”).\n     23\n       Increased reliance on individual contractors -- particularly\nretirees such as Brown and Miller -- also raises a concern that some\nformer federal employees may unwittingly violate § 30119 because\nthey are unaware that they have become subject to a different set of\nrestrictions as contractors. However, as FEC counsel advised the\ncourt, there is no criminal violation unless the individual knows his or\nher conduct violates the law. Oral Arg. Recording 1:01:19-1:02:19;\n\f                                   34\n\n     2. The plaintiffs also question whether there is sufficient\nevidence of corruption or coercion specifically with respect to\nindividual contractors, as compared to those organized as\ncorporations or other kinds of firms. It is true that most of the\nexamples set forth in Parts III.B and III.C above involve firms.24\nWe see no reason, however, to believe that the motivations for\ncorruption and coercion exhibited in those examples are\ninapplicable in the case of individual contractors. Consider Sam\nHarris, a consultant who told the Watergate Committee that “he\nwas made to feel that his continued success in obtaining\nGovernment contracts would, in significant degree, be\ndependent on his contributing to the President’s reelection.”\nWATERGATE REPORT at 409. There is no basis for thinking that\nHarris would have been less vulnerable to such coercion if,\ninstead of doing business as Sam Harris & Associates, id., he\nhad contracted with the government in his personal capacity.\nWe are also mindful that less direct evidence is required when,\nas here, the government acts to prevent offenses that “are\nsuccessful precisely because they are difficult to detect.”\nBurson, 504 U.S. at 208 (upholding restriction of campaign\n\n\nsee 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A) (imposing criminal penalties on those\nwho “knowingly and willfully” violate FECA); Bryan v. United\nStates, 524 U.S. 184, 191-92 (1998) (“[I]n order to establish a ‘willful’\nviolation of a statute, the Government must prove that the defendant\nacted with knowledge that his conduct was unlawful.” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n     24\n      But see, e.g., 84 CONG. REC. 9598, 9610 (1939) (statements of\nReps. Taylor and Michener) (detailing the coercion of WPA-paid\nworkers to contribute to the Democratic Party that led to passage of\nthe Hatch Act); WATERGATE REPORT at 413 (describing how federal\nemployees were pressured to help meet a “management objective” by\ncontributing to a Republican Party fundraiser); id. 429 (describing\nevidence that contributions were solicited from Veterans’\nAdministration employees).\n\f                               35\n\nspeech near voting places as warranted to prevent “[v]oter\nintimidation and election fraud,” notwithstanding limited record\nevidence). “[N]o smoking gun is needed where . . . the conflict\nof interest is apparent, the likelihood of stealth great, and the\nlegislative purpose prophylactic.” Blount v. SEC, 61 F.3d 938,\n945 (D.C. Cir. 1995).\n\n     Moreover, the trend we identified above, toward a larger\nfederal workforce outside the protection of the civil service\nsystem, necessarily poses an increased threat of both corruption\nand coercion. If anything, past experience suggests that such\nworkers are particularly vulnerable to tacit (or not so tacit)\ndemands for political tributes. See, e.g., Rutan v. Republican\nParty of Ill., 497 U.S. 62, 66 (1990) (describing state\ngovernment promotion decisions predicated on “whether the\napplicant has provided financial or other support to the\nRepublican Party and its candidates”); Elrod, 427 U.S. at 355\n(describing Cook County patronage system in which, “[i]n order\nto maintain their jobs, respondents were required to . . .\ncontribute a portion of their wages to the [Democratic] Party”);\nsee also Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 671 (describing an individual\nwhose contract for hauling trash allegedly was terminated in\nretaliation for political criticism). A coercive patronage system\ncan thrive on even small contributions from a large group of\nworkers beholden to those in power -- which is what the\ngrowing ranks of individual contractors staffing federal agencies\noffer. As the Court explained in Elrod v. Burns, “[a]s\ngovernment employment . . . becomes more pervasive, the\ngreater the dependence on it becomes, and therefore the greater\nbecomes the power to starve political opposition by\ncommanding partisan support, financial and otherwise.” 427\nU.S. at 356; see Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 565-66 (explaining\nthat “perhaps the immediate occasion for enactment of the Hatch\nAct in 1939 . . . was the conviction that the rapidly expanding\n\f                                36\n\nGovernment work force should not be employed to build a\npowerful, invincible, and perhaps corrupt political machine”).\n\n                                E\n\n     Our historical review makes clear that the two Court-\napproved justifications for limitations on campaign activities --\nto protect against quid pro quo corruption and its appearance,\nand to protect merit-based public administration -- were the\njustifications that lay behind the contractor contribution statute.\nLikewise, our national experience supports Congress’ fear that\npolitical contributions by government contractors can corrupt\nand interfere with merit-based administration.\n\n     The Supreme Court has instructed that the “quantum of\nempirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny\nof legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty\nand plausibility of the justification raised.” Nixon v. Shrink Mo.\nGov’t PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 391 (2000). There is nothing novel\nor implausible about the notion that contractors may make\npolitical contributions as a quid pro quo for government\ncontracts, that officials may steer government contracts in return\nfor such contributions, and that the making of contributions and\nthe awarding of contracts to contributors fosters the appearance\nof such quid pro quo corruption. Nor is there anything novel or\nimplausible about the idea that contractors may be coerced to\nmake contributions to play in that game, or that more qualified\ncontractors may decline to play at all if the game is rigged. To\nthe contrary, the empirical record is more than sufficient to\nsatisfy the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate for review of\nthe legislative judgments that support § 30119.\n\n     In sum, the interests supporting the contractor contribution\nstatute are legally sufficient, and the dangers it seeks to combat\nare real and supported by the historical and factual record.\n\f                                37\n\nAccordingly, we now turn to the remainder of the “closely\ndrawn” test.\n\n                                IV\n\n     Even if a contribution ban serves sufficiently important\ninterests, to satisfy the First Amendment it still must employ\n“‘means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of\nassociational freedoms.’” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25). Clearing this hurdle\n“require[s] ‘a fit that is not necessarily perfect, but reasonable;\nthat represents not necessarily the single best disposition but one\nwhose scope is in proportion to the interest served[;] . . . that\nemploys not necessarily the least restrictive means but . . . a\nmeans narrowly tailored to achieve the desired objective.’” Id.\nat 1456-57 (quoting Bd. of Trs. v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 480\n(1989)). The plaintiffs contend that § 30119 fails this test\nbecause it is overinclusive in several respects, which we\nconsider in turn.\n\n                                 A\n\n     The plaintiffs first maintain that the statute is overinclusive\nbecause Congress banned their contributions entirely, rather than\nsimply resting on the contribution limits generally applicable to\nall citizens, see 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a), or on some more modest\nlimits. Such a contribution ban, applicable to a particular\ncategory of persons, is not unique. Federal law has long\nprohibited all federal campaign contributions by corporations\nand labor unions. See 52 U.S.C. § 30118(a); Beaumont, 539\nU.S. at 161-63. Several states have their own bans on certain\ncontributions by classes of individuals or firms that do business\n\f                                38\n\nwith the government.25 And every judge on this court -- indeed,\non every lower federal court -- is likewise banned from making\npolitical contributions. See CODE OF CONDUCT FOR UNITED\nSTATES JUDGES, Canon 5(A)(3). So, too, are judicial employees.\nSee CODE OF CONDUCT FOR JUDICIAL EMPLOYEES § 310.10(a);\nid. § 320, Canon 5(A). See also Bluman v. FEC, 800 F. Supp.\n2d 281 (D.D.C. 2011) (three-judge court) (upholding ban on\ncontributions by foreign nationals, 52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)), summ.\naff’d, 132 S. Ct. 1087 (2012).\n\n     We do not dispute that the total ban on federal contributions\nby contractors is a significant restriction. But the point of the\n“closely drawn” test is that “‘[e]ven a significant interference\nwith protected rights of political association may be sustained if\nthe State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and\nemploys means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment\nof associational freedoms.’” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25). And we conclude that the\nban at issue here is permissible in the circumstances that we\naddress in this opinion: a regulation that bars only campaign\ncontributions and that is imposed only on government\ncontractors. As we have discussed, the Court has held that\ncampaign contributions constitute a form of expressive activity\nless central to the First Amendment than other kinds of political\nactivity and expenditures. See, e.g., id. at 1444; Beaumont, 539\nU.S. at 161; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25. And as we have also\ndiscussed, we owe “‘greater deference to government\npredictions of harm used to justify restriction of employee\nspeech than to predictions of harm used to justify restrictions on\nthe speech of the public at large.’” Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 676\n\n\n    25\n      See, e.g., CONN. GEN. STAT. § 9-612(f)(1)-(2); HAW. REV. STAT.\n§ 11-355; 30 ILL. COMP. STAT. 500/50-37; IND. CODE §§ 4-30-3-19.7;\nLA. REV. STAT. ANN. § 18:1505.2(L); MICH. COMP. LAWS § 432.207b;\nW. VA. CODE § 3-8-12(d).\n\f                               39\n\n(quoting Waters, 511 U.S. at 673); see Letter Carriers, 413 U.S.\nat 566-67; Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568.             Under these\ncircumstances, we conclude that Congress’ decision to impose\na contribution ban during the period of contract negotiation and\nperformance is closely drawn for two reasons.\n\n     First, the contracting context greatly sharpens the risk of\ncorruption and its appearance. Unlike the corruption risk when\na contribution is made by a member of the general public, in the\ncase of contracting there is a very specific quo for which the\ncontribution may serve as the quid: the grant or retention of the\ncontract. Indeed, if there is an area that can be described as the\n“heartland” of such concerns, the contracting process is it. Cf.\nGreen Party, 616 F.3d at 202 (explaining that Connecticut’s ban\non contractor contributions “is, without question, ‘closely\ndrawn’ to meet the state’s interest in combating corruption and\nthe appearance of corruption” because such contributions “lie at\nthe heart of the corruption problem in Connecticut”); see also\nYamada, 2015 WL 2384944, at *20. The long historical\nexperience described in Parts III.B and III.C makes clear that\nthis is not just a question of risk, but of reality.\n\n     Moreover, because of that sharpened focus, the appearance\nproblem is also greater: a contribution made while negotiating\nor performing a contract looks like a quid pro quo, whether or\nnot it truly is. As the sponsor of the 1940 contractor\ncontribution ban explained to his Senate colleagues, the ban was\nneeded because contractor contributions “may be considered in\nsome instances as bribery in order to secure governmental\ncontracts,” 86 CONG. REC. 2982 (1940) (statement of Sen.\nByrd). See Green Party, 616 F.3d at 205 (upholding\nConnecticut’s ban because, inter alia, “[e]ven if small contractor\ncontributions would have been unlikely to influence state\nofficials, those contributions could have still given rise to the\nappearance that contractors are able to exert improper influence\n\f                                40\n\non state officials”); cf. Preston, 660 F.3d at 736 (upholding\nNorth Carolina’s ban on lobbyists’ contributions because it\nrested on “a legitimate legislative judgment” that “a complete\nban was necessary as a prophylactic to prevent not only actual\ncorruption but also the appearance of corruption in future state\npolitical campaigns”).\n\n     Second, the contracting context also greatly sharpens the\nrisk of interference with merit-based public administration.\nBecause a contractor’s need for government contracts is\ngenerally more focused than a member of the general public’s\nneed for other official acts, his or her susceptibility to coercion\nis concomitantly greater. And coercing a contractor to\ncontribute, even if limited by a contribution ceiling, is still\ncoercion.\n\n     In sum, we conclude that a flat prohibition is closely drawn\nto the important goals that § 30119 serves. Cf. Williams-Yulee\nv. Fla. Bar, 135 S. Ct. 1656, 1672 (2015) (“Although the Court\nhas held that contribution limits advance the interest in\npreventing quid pro quo corruption and its appearance in\npolitical elections, we have never held that adopting contribution\nlimits precludes a State from pursuing its compelling interests\nthrough additional means.”).\n\n                                 B\n\n     The plaintiffs also argue that § 30119 is overinclusive\nbecause it bans contributions not only to candidates for\nPresident and Congress, but also to political parties, which,\n“[u]nlike elected officials who might have the theoretical power\nto influence a contract, . . . plainly have no ability to affect the\naward of any contract.” Pls. Br. 51. But the Democratic\ncampaign book scandal of the 1930s gave Congress sufficient\nreason to target contributions to parties: it was the Democratic\n\f                               41\n\nNational Committee whose agents reportedly told government\ncontractors that the continuation of their contracts hinged on\ntheir financial support of the party. See 84 CONG. REC. 9598-99\n(1939). Indeed, the 1876 law concerning federal employees was\nalso “aimed at the suppression of the practice which has\nprevailed among party organizations of soliciting contributions\nfor party purposes from their office-holding members, or\nexacting them by a moral coercion.” United States v. Curtis, 12\nF. 824, 838 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1882) (emphasis added). Likewise\nthe Watergate Committee’s report on the 1972 election included\nevidence that federal employees were pressured to contribute to\nthe Republican Party. WATERGATE REPORT at 413. Nor did the\nrole of contributions to political parties in influencing\ngovernment employment wane as the 20th century progressed.\nSee, e.g., Elrod, 427 U.S. at 351-52 (1976); Branti v. Finkel, 445\nU.S. 507, 510-11 (1980); Rutan, 497 U.S. at 66 (1990).\n\n     More recently, in upholding FECA’s restrictions on soft-\nmoney contributions to political parties, the Supreme Court\nnoted that “‘[t]here is no meaningful separation between the\nnational party committees and the public officials who control\nthem.’” McConnell, 540 U.S. at 155 (quoting expert report cited\nin McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 468-69 (D.D.C.\n2003)). As a three-judge court in this district noted, “the\n[McConnell] Court suggested that federal officeholders and\ncandidates may value contributions to their national parties --\nregardless of how those contributions ultimately may be used --\nin much the same way they value contributions to their own\ncampaigns.” Republican Nat’l Comm., 698 F. Supp. 2d at 159,\n\f                                42\n\nsumm. aff’d, 561 U.S. 1040 (2010).26 Congress did not sweep\ntoo broadly by designing § 30119 to address that fact.\n\n                                 C\n\n    In addition to those we have just considered, the plaintiffs\npropose a miscellany of further ways in which Congress could\nmake § 30119 less restrictive. We address only the more\nsubstantial of these.\n\n     First, the plaintiffs propose that the ban should at least\nexclude sole-source contracts for experts like plaintiff Wagner,\nparticularly when it is the government that initiates the contact,\n“because the requirements to enter them are sufficiently\nrigorous” to address the risk of corruption. Pls. Br. 53 n.9. But\nthe plaintiffs do not explain what those requirements are, or why\nthey provide the requisite assurances. Cf. KATE M. MANUEL,\nCONG . R ESEARCH SERV ., COMPETITION IN FEDERAL\nCONTRACTING: AN OVERVIEW OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS 1\n(2011) (noting “high-profile incidents of alleged misconduct by\ncontractors or agency officials involving noncompetitive\ncontracts”). Moreover, this argument appears contrary to the\nplaintiffs’ principal contention, that it is the rise of competitive\nbidding -- not the private placement of sole-source contracts --\nthat has eliminated the risk of pay-to-play. See supra Part\nIII.D.1. In any event, because Wagner’s claims are moot, this\nargument need not detain us.\n\n\n\n\n    26\n      See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 155 (explaining that the “close\nconnection and alignment of interests” between parties and federal\nofficeholders are likely to create the risk of “actual or apparent”\ncorruption); Emily’s List v. FEC, 581 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\f                                   43\n\n    Second, the plaintiffs argue that § 30119 unnecessarily bars\ncontractors from contributing to ideological PACs that, in turn,\ncontribute to candidates. Whether or not this argument has\nmerit,27 it suffers from a similar problem: the one plaintiff\nwhose claim is not moot lacks standing to challenge limitations\non contributions to PACs. See supra Part I.\n\n     Third, the plaintiffs suggest that the statute would be more\nclosely drawn if it applied only to large contracts, pointing out\nthat Colorado and New York City enacted pay-to-play laws\nlimited to contracts worth more than $100,000. See Pls. Br.\n52-53. Although such a dollar limit would of course reduce the\nnumber of covered contractors, the plaintiffs do not explain why\n§ 30119 is not closely drawn to the interests it serves in the\nabsence of such a limit, or why a dollar limit would draw it more\nclosely to those interests. Perhaps quid pro quos and coercion\nare more likely when larger contracts are involved because,\nsince more money is at stake, the parties are more willing to risk\ndetection and prosecution. Or perhaps such abuses are just as\nlikely when smaller contracts are involved because the relative\nvalue to the small contractor is high and the risk of detection is\ncomparatively low. Because the plaintiffs have advanced no\nargument on this point, there is no need for us to speculate\nfurther. We do note, however, that the historical record provides\nsupport for legislative concern that corrupt and coercive\npatronage regimes can take root even when relatively small\namounts of money are at stake. See supra Parts III.B.1-2,\nIII.D.2., IV.A. And we also note again that a contribution ban\nneed not be a perfect fit to be constitutional, see McCutcheon,\n\n\n     27\n       The Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on contributions to\nmulticandidate committees as a necessary means to avoid\ncircumvention of other limits. Cal. Med. Ass’n, 453 U.S. at 197-99\n(plurality opinion); see id. at 203 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment); Emily’s List, 581 F.3d at 11-12.\n\f                                   44\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1456-57, and that courts give substantial deference\nto the government’s predictions of harm concerning its own\nemployees and contractors, see Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 676.\n\n     Finally, the plaintiffs maintain that Congress should have\nrested on the criminal statutes that directly ban quid pro quos\nand coercion,28 rather than also banning political contributions.\nBut the Supreme Court has repeatedly dispatched this argument.\nAs McConnell explained, “[i]n Buckley, we expressly rejected\nthe argument that antibribery laws provided a less restrictive\nalternative to FECA’s contribution limits, noting that such laws\n‘deal[t] with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those\nwith money to influence governmental action.’” 540 U.S. at 143\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 28); see Citizens United, 558 U.S.\nat 356-57 (noting that, although quid pro quo arrangements\n“would be covered by bribery laws” if proven, the Court has\nviewed “restrictions on direct contributions a[s] preventative”\nand has sustained them “in order to ensure against the reality or\nappearance of corruption”). And what is true of the antibribery\nlaws is equally true of the anticoercion provisions. See Letter\nCarriers, 413 U.S. at 566 (“It may be urged that prohibitions\nagainst coercion are sufficient protection; but for many years the\njoint judgment of the Executive and Congress has been that to\nprotect the rights of federal employees with respect to their jobs\nand their political acts and beliefs it is not enough merely to\nforbid one employee to attempt to influence or coerce\nanother.”).\n\n\n\n\n     28\n       See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 201 (proscribing bribes and gratuities); id.\n§ 601 (proscribing causing or attempting to cause persons to make\npolitical contributions by denying or threatening to deny them work\nin or for the federal government).\n\f                                   45\n\n                                    D\n\n     Because the operative question in the plaintiffs’\noverinclusiveness challenge is whether § 30119 avoids\n“unnecessary abridgment” of First Amendment rights, it is also\nimportant to consider how much the statute leaves untouched.\nCampaign contributions are banned, but other forms of political\nengagement are left entirely unrestricted. The plaintiffs are free\nto volunteer for candidates, parties, or political committees; to\nspeak in their favor; and to host fundraisers and solicit\ncontributions from others. See 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(B)\n(enumerating activities to which the term “contribution” does\nnot extend). And even the contribution ban itself is limited to\nthe period between commencement of negotiations and\ncompletion of contract performance. Id. § 30119(a)(1).\n\n     The plaintiffs insist that the fact that the statute preserves\nother avenues of political communication is irrelevant to First\nAmendment analysis. Pls. Br. 61. But that argument is\nincorrect. As the Court recognized in McCutcheon v. FEC, “in\nthe context of [upholding the] base contribution limits, Buckley\nobserved that a supporter could vindicate his associational\ninterests by personally volunteering his time and energy on\nbehalf of a candidate.” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1449 (citing\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 22, 28).29 The availability of other avenues\n\n\n     29\n       See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 22 (noting that FECA’s contribution\nceilings “limit one important means of associating with a candidate or\ncommittee, but leave the contributor free to become a member of any\npolitical association and to assist personally in the association’s efforts\non behalf of candidates”); see also Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1670\n(upholding Florida’s ban on solicitation of campaign funds by judicial\ncandidates, emphasizing that the ban restricts only “a narrow slice of\nspeech” because it “leaves judicial candidates free to discuss any issue\nwith any person at any time”).\n\f                               46\n\nof political communication can thus be relevant, although it is of\ncourse not dispositive.\n\n     In Blount v. SEC, for example, this court upheld a rule\nrestricting political contributions by municipal finance\nprofessionals to state and local officials from whom they hoped\nto secure underwriting contracts. 61 F.3d 938. We found the\nrule to be “closely drawn,” in part because it “restrict[ed] a\nnarrow range of their activities for a relatively short period of\ntime,” and those subject to the rule were “not in any way\nrestricted from engaging in the vast majority of political\nactivities.” Id. at 947-48. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit upheld\na lobbyist contribution ban in part because it “serve[d] only as\na channeling device, cutting off the avenue of association and\nexpression that is most likely to lead to corruption but allowing\nnumerous other avenues of association and expression.”\nPreston, 660 F.3d at 734. So, too, here.\n\n                                E\n\n     We conclude that the ban on contractor contributions is\nclosely drawn to the government’s interests in preventing\ncorruption and its appearance, and in protecting against\ninterference with merit-based administration. It strikes at the\ndangers Congress most feared while preserving contractors’\nfreedom to engage in many other forms of political expression.\nWe do not discount the possibility that Congress could have\nnarrowed its aim even further, targeting only certain specific\nkinds of government contracting or doing so only during\nspecific periods. But as the Court has made clear, “most\nproblems arise in greater and lesser gradations, and the First\nAmendment does not confine a State to addressing evils in their\nmost acute form.” Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1671.\n\f                                   47\n\n                                   V\n\n     What we have said thus far establishes that § 30119’s ban\non contractor contributions serves sufficiently important\ninterests and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary\nabridgment of protected expression. The plaintiffs make one\nfurther First Amendment argument: not only is § 30119\noverinclusive because it restricts too much speech, but it is also\nunderinclusive because it permits too much speech. That is, it\nfails to ban contributions by three categories of individuals or\nentities that might implicate the same interests.\n\n     The first category proffered for comparison by the plaintiffs\nconsists of entities and individuals associated with firms that\nhave government contracts: PACs established by contracting\ncorporations; officers, employees, and shareholders of\ncontracting corporations; and individuals who control limited\nliability companies (LLCs) that contract with the federal\ngovernment. The second category is composed of federal\nemployees. The final category comprises individuals who seek\nother government benefits or positions, particularly grants and\nloans, admission to the military academies, and\nambassadorships.30\n\n    We begin with some general principles relevant to\nevaluating a claim that a statute violates the First Amendment\nbecause it is “underinclusive.” To put it most bluntly: “The First\n\n\n     30\n        The plaintiffs’ opening brief proffers only the third category as\nan example of First Amendment underinclusiveness, discussing the\nfirst two as part of their equal protection challenge. Pls. Br. 23, 55-59.\nIn their reply brief, the plaintiffs identify all three categories as\nsupporting their First Amendment argument. Reply Br. 26-28.\nBecause the issues are intertwined, see infra Part VI, we consider all\nthree categories here.\n\f                                48\n\nAmendment does not require the government to curtail as much\nspeech as may conceivably serve its goals.” Blount, 61 F.3d at\n946. Or, as the Supreme Court recently said in Williams-Yulee\nv. Florida Bar, in which it upheld, under strict scrutiny,\nFlorida’s ban on solicitation of campaign funds by judicial\ncandidates:\n\n         [T]he First Amendment imposes no freestanding\n         “underinclusiveness limitation.” A State need not\n         address all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop;\n         policymakers may focus on their most pressing\n         concerns. We have accordingly upheld laws -- even\n         under strict scrutiny -- that conceivably could have\n         restricted even greater amounts of speech in service of\n         their stated interests.\n\n135 S. Ct. at 1668 (quoting R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 387\n(1992)). Of course, in the instant case we do not apply strict\nscrutiny, but rather the more forgiving “closely drawn” standard.\nAnd a statute that does not go as far as it might to cut off\ncampaign contributions can hardly be said to constitute an\n“unnecessary abridgment” of the freedom to make such\ncontributions, McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444.\n\n     This is not to say that underinclusiveness plays no role in\nFirst Amendment analysis. As the Court explained in Williams-\nYulee, a law’s underinclusiveness raises “a red flag” that may\nindicate a different kind of problem. 135 S. Ct. at 1668. For\nexample, it may raise “‘doubts about whether the government is\nin fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a\nparticular speaker or viewpoint.’” Id. (quoting Brown v. Entm’t\nMerchants Ass’n, 131 S. Ct. 2729, 2740 (2011)). The “textbook\nillustration of that principle,” the Court explained, is the Lukumi\nBabalu Aye case, in which it struck down a city’s ban on ritual\nanimal sacrifices because the city’s failure to ban secular\n\f                                   49\n\nkillings indicated that the ban’s object was not (as it asserted)\nanimal welfare but rather the suppression of particular religious\nbeliefs. Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1668 (citing Church of\nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 543-47\n(1993)).31 Indeed, underinclusiveness may call into question\nwhether “the proffered state interest actually underlies the law,”\nBlount, 61 F.3d at 938 (internal quotation marks omitted), even\nwhen the true interest is not invidious. See Republican Party of\nMinn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 780 (2002) (finding a restriction\non speech by judicial candidates “so woefully underinclusive as\nto render belief in [its asserted] purpose a challenge to the\ncredulous”).32\n\n\n\n\n     31\n         See also City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 512 U.S. 43, 51 (1994) (noting\nthat “a regulation of speech may be impermissibly underinclusive” if\nit represents an attempt “to give one side of a debatable public\nquestion an advantage in expressing its views to the people,” or “to\nselect the permissible subjects for public debate and thereby to control\n. . . the search for political truth” (internal quotation marks omitted));\nFirst Nat’l Bank of Bos. v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 793 (1978) (finding\nan underinclusiveness problem where “[t]he fact that a particular kind\nof ballot question [was] singled out for special treatment . . .\nsuggest[ed] . . . that the legislature may have been concerned with\nsilencing corporations on a particular subject”).\n     32\n       See also Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 362 (concluding that, “if\nCongress had been seeking to protect dissenting shareholders” as the\ngovernment claimed, it would not have banned corporate speech “in\nonly certain media” for only a specific period before an election);\nFlorida Star v. B.J.F., 491 U.S. 524, 540 (1989) (invalidating statute\nbarring publication of victims’ identities in part because its “facial\nunderinclusiveness . . . raises serious doubts about whether Florida is,\nin fact, serving, with this statute, the significant interests which [it]\ninvokes in support of affirmance”).\n\f                                50\n\n     But the plaintiffs do not challenge § 30119 on these\ngrounds. They do not contend, for example, that Congress’ true\ninterest was to favor corporate affiliates, federal employees, or\ngovernment grantees over individual contractors, see Oral Arg.\nRecording 18:20-19:03, which would require us to undertake\ncloser analysis of the basis for such disparate treatment. To the\ncontrary, they agree that the interests that motivated and have\nsustained § 30119 are the anticorruption goals the government\ninvokes today. See id. 22:05-45. Moreover, it is plain that the\nstatute “applies evenhandedly to all [government contractors],\nregardless of their viewpoint,” Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at\n1668, and regardless of their form of organization, see 52 U.S.C.\n§ 30119(a)(1) (barring the “person” who enters into the contract\nfrom making the contribution); id. § 30101(11) (defining\n“person” to “include[] an individual, partnership, committee,\nassociation, corporation, labor organization, or any other\norganization or group of persons”). And nothing in the statute’s\nhistory even hints at any purpose to disfavor individual\ncontractors as against the categories proffered by the plaintiffs.\n\n     In Williams-Yulee, the Court noted that\n“[u]nderinclusiveness can also reveal that a law does not\nactually advance a compelling interest.” 135 S. Ct. at 1668. See\nalso Blount, 61 F.3d at 946 (noting that a rule may be “struck for\nunderinclusiveness . . . if it cannot ‘fairly be said to advance any\ngenuinely substantial governmental interest’” (quoting FCC v.\nLeague of Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 396 (1984))). As an\nexample of that kind of case, the Court cited the facts of Smith\nv. Daily Mail, where the Court struck down a state statute\nbanning newspapers from disclosing the names of juvenile\ndefendants because, inter alia, the statutory purpose -- protecting\nthe anonymity of juvenile offenders -- was entirely vitiated by\nthe statute’s failure to bar electronic media from making the\nsame disclosures. Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1668 (citing\n\f                                  51\n\nSmith v. Daily Mail Publ’g Co., 443 U.S. 97, 104-105 (1979)).33\nBut here, the record reflects that § 30119 does advance, albeit\nimperfectly, the government’s important interests in protecting\nagainst quid pro quo corruption and its appearance, and in\nprotecting merit-based public administration.\n\n     With these general principles in mind, we now briefly\nexamine each of the categories of underinclusiveness to which\nthe plaintiffs draw our attention.\n\n                                  A\n\n     The plaintiffs’ first category includes entities and\nindividuals associated with corporations that have government\ncontracts. Like the plaintiffs, corporations that contract with\nfederal agencies cannot make contributions in federal elections.\nSee 52 U.S.C. §§ 30119(a), 30101(11).34 At the same time, it is\ntrue that corporate contractors (like other corporations) are\npermitted to form PACs -- separate segregated funds that can\n\n\n     33\n        Cf. Reed v. Town of Gilbert, No. 13-502, 2015 WL 2473374, at\n*11 (U.S. June 18, 2015) (holding that a town’s content-based sign\nregulation failed strict scrutiny because “[t]he Town cannot claim that\nplacing strict limits on temporary directional signs is necessary to\nbeautify the Town while at the same time allowing unlimited numbers\nof other types of signs that create the same problem”); Sanjour v. EPA,\n56 F.3d 85, 95 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (en banc) (“Because the government\nhas . . . not even attempted to regulate a broad category of behavior\n. . . giving rise to precisely the harm that supposedly motivated it to\nadopt the [challenged] regulations, we have trouble taking the\ngovernment’s avowed interest to heart.”).\n     34\n      The ban on corporate contractor contributions is a consequence\nnot only of § 30119, but also of 52 U.S.C. § 30118, which bans\ncontributions by any corporation in a federal election. See Beaumont,\n539 U.S. 146 (upholding the ban on corporate contributions).\n\f                                52\n\nmake campaign contributions with non-treasury funds solicited\nfrom shareholders, certain personnel, and their families. See 52\nU.S.C. § 30119(b); id. § 30118(b). Officers, employees, and\nshareholders of corporate contractors are also free to make direct\ncontributions “from their personal assets.” 11 C.F.R. § 115.6.\nAnd it may be that individuals who control LLCs that contract\nwith the federal government can make contributions as well.\nBut none of these allowances fatally undermines the statutory\nregime.\n\n      1. A corporation is a separate legal entity from a PAC. See\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 337; Mass. Citizens for Life, 479\nU.S. at 252-56. As a consequence, the Supreme Court has said\nthat the political expression of a PAC is not equivalent to that of\nits associated corporation. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 337\n(“A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the\nPAC exemption from [FECA’s] expenditure ban does not allow\ncorporations to speak.” (citation omitted)). Congress’ decision\nto permit contributions by PACs associated with contracting\ncorporations is therefore not inconsistent with its decision to\nprohibit contributions by contractors themselves.\n\n     In Williams-Yulee, the Court considered a similar\nunderinclusiveness challenge to Florida’s ban on personal\nsolicitation of campaign funds by judicial candidates. That ban\n“allow[ed] a judge’s campaign committee to solicit money,”\nwhich the petitioner argued “reduces public confidence in the\nintegrity of the judiciary just as much as a judge’s personal\nsolicitation.” 135 S. Ct. at 1668. The Court was not moved.\n“However similar the two solicitations may be in substance,” the\nCourt said, “a State may conclude that they present markedly\ndifferent appearances to the public. Florida’s choice to allow\nsolicitation by campaign committees does not undermine its\ndecision to ban solicitation by judges.” Id. at 1669. The same\ncan be said of Congress’ choice to permit contributions by\n\f                                53\n\npolitical committees associated with corporate contractors, while\nbanning contributions by contractors themselves.\n\n    2. Respecting the corporate form, and therefore according\nseparate treatment to shareholders and other individuals\nassociated with corporations, is also constitutional. In Blount,\nwe considered and rejected a similar underinclusiveness\nchallenge to the SEC’s pay-to-play rule, which, while restricting\ncontributions by municipal securities professionals, did not\nextend the restriction to the chief executives of banks with\nmunicipal securities departments. “[A] regulation is not fatally\nunderinclusive,” we said, “simply because an alternative\nregulation, which would restrict more speech or the speech of\nmore people, could be more effective.” Blount, 61 F.3d at 946.\n\n     In upholding the SEC’s rule, Blount also noted the SEC’s\nexplanation that this “loophole,” like others in the rule, reflected\nthe Commission’s sensitivity to First Amendment concerns\nabout overinclusiveness. Id. at 947. Here, too, Congress could\nreasonably have concluded that banning contributions by all\nthose associated with corporate contractors would go too far at\ntoo great a First Amendment cost.\n\n     3. The plaintiffs further argue that, while they contract\ndirectly with the federal government for their services and so are\nbarred from making contributions, they or other individuals\ncould instead establish an LLC to formally contract with the\ngovernment and receive payment for their work. Then, because\nthe FEC has ruled that the contractor contribution ban does not\napply to an entity’s “employees, officers, or members,” 11\nC.F.R. § 115.6, the plaintiffs maintain that such individuals\nwould remain free to make contributions. The availability of\nthis LLC loophole, they say, vitiates the statutory purpose.\n\f                                  54\n\n     Although the FEC’s briefs accepted the plaintiffs’\ndescription of the regulatory treatment of individuals who\nestablish LLCs, the agency submitted a post-argument letter\nclarifying that the Commission itself “has not addressed the\napplication of FECA’s contractor contribution prohibition to\ncontributions made by an individual who is the sole member of\nan LLC that is a federal contractor.” FEC Post-Argument Letter\nat 6 (Nov. 24, 2014) (emphasis omitted).35 Perhaps for that\nreason, there is no evidence in the record that anyone has ever\nused an LLC as a loophole to permit him or her to make an\nindividual campaign contribution.36\n\n     The plaintiffs’ own evidence highlights the not insignificant\ncosts involved in both establishing and operating as an LLC.\nSee Tiemann Decl. ¶ 3, cited in D. Ct. Findings ¶ 19. Moreover,\nat oral argument, plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged that “persons\nlike Mr. Miller and Mr. Brown almost certainly could not have\n[contracted] through [an] LLC” -- both because the agency may\nnot have allowed it, and because of the “substantial sacrifice”\nthey would have incurred by forgoing various benefits that come\nwith employment-like contracts. Oral Arg. Recording 23:13-58.\nIn short, in the absence of any evidence of circumvention-by-\nLLC, the failure to plug this speculative loophole is hardly a\n\n     35\n     The statute, of course, does not mention LLCs, which first\nemerged in the late 1970s. See Treatment of Limited Liability\nCompanies Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, 64 Fed. Reg.\n37397, 37398 (July 12, 1999).\n     36\n       One witness opined that, at least with respect to consulting-type\ncontracts, client agencies are indifferent between contracting with an\nLLC and contracting with an individual. See Schooner Decl. ¶ 8, cited\nin D. Ct. Findings ¶ 20. The witness did not say how many such\narrangements there are, or that any individuals using LLCs had\nactually made campaign contributions. Id.; see also Lubbers Decl. ¶ 8,\ncited in D. Ct. Findings ¶ 20.\n\f                                   55\n\nbasis for invalidating the statute. Cf. Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct.\nat 1670 (“Even under strict scrutiny, ‘[t]he First Amendment\ndoes not require States to regulate for problems that do not\nexist.’” (quoting Burson, 504 U.S. at 207)).\n\n                                    B\n\n     The second category proffered by the plaintiffs as evidence\nof § 30119’s underinclusiveness is composed of federal\nemployees who, unlike federal contractors, are generally not\nbarred from making campaign contributions. See 5 C.F.R.\n§ 734.208(a). As with the other categories, there is no ground\nfor concluding that Congress chose to invidiously discriminate\nagainst contractors in favor of employees. And while federal\nemployees are permitted to make contributions, they are subject\nto other restrictions (pursuant to the Hatch Act) and enjoy other\nprotections (pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act) that do\nnot apply to contractors.37\n\n\n\n\n     37\n       The Hatch Act bars most federal employees from, inter alia,\nsoliciting or accepting political contributions, running for office in a\npartisan election, hosting a political fundraiser, or engaging in political\nactivity while on duty or in a federal building. See 5 U.S.C.\n§§ 7323(a), 7324(a); 5 C.F.R. §§ 734.302-.306. Employees of more\nthan a dozen specific agencies, as well as others who hold certain\nsenior or adjudicative positions, are more broadly prohibited from\n“tak[ing] an active part in . . . political campaigns.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 7323(b)(2)(A). Under the Civil Service Reform Act, covered\nemployees are protected against “prohibited personnel practices,”\nincluding discrimination on the basis of political affiliation and\ncoercion to make political contributions. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(a)(1),\n(b)(1)(E), (b)(3). Aggrieved employees who have been subjected to\nsuch practices can seek redress through the Office of Special Counsel\nand the Merit Systems Protection Board. 5 U.S.C. §§ 1214-15, 1221.\n\f                                   56\n\n     Congress could reasonably have thought that the difference\nin status of the two kinds of workers warrants this difference in\ntreatment. Because regular employees do not generally need\nnew contracts or renewals with the frequency required by\noutside contractors, permitting them to make contributions\ncarries less risk of corruption or its appearance: employees have\nless to gain from making contributions and less to lose from not\nmaking them.38 It is true, as the plaintiffs note, that employees\nhave other concerns that could make them susceptible to\ncoercion, including the desire for promotion or the fear of\ntermination. But Congress has provided them with merit system\nprotections that guard against that risk. See supra note 37. We\nsee no basis for overturning Congress’ decision about how to\ncalibrate these different restrictions.39\n\n                                   C\n\n     Finally, the plaintiffs’ comparison of contractors to a\nmiscellany of other individuals who seek government benefits\nor positions -- particularly grants and loans, admission to the\nmilitary academies, and ambassadorships -- is equally\n\n\n     38\n         Cf. 86 CONG. REC. 2580 (1940) (statement of Sen. Brown)\n(“[T]he Government clerk, if he is not under civil service, is interested\nin keeping in power the party that is in power and that gave him a job.\n. . . I can apply the same principle . . . . to contractors who are doing\nbusiness with the Government of the United States.” (emphasis\nadded)).\n     39\n       Cf. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 607 n.5 (1973)\n(rejecting equal protection challenge to Oklahoma statute “singling out\nclassified service employees for restrictions on partisan political\nexpression while leaving unclassified personnel free from such\nrestrictions” because “the legislature must have some leeway in\ndetermining which of its employment positions require restrictions on\npartisan political activities and which may be left unregulated”).\n\f                                57\n\nunavailing. Once again, there is no basis for a claim that\nCongress invidiously discriminated against contractors and in\nfavor of others. Nor is there any reason to believe that\npermitting contributions by these other individuals defeats\n§ 30119’s purpose of protecting against corruption and\ninterference with merit-based administration. Congress is surely\nnot prohibited from fighting such problems in one sector unless\nit fights them in all. As the Supreme Court has said, “‘a\nlegislature need not strike at all evils at the same time.’”\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 105 (quoting Katzenbach v. Morgan, 384\nU.S. 641, 657 (1966)). Rather, “reform may take one step at a\ntime, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems\nmost acute to the legislative mind.” Id. (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted); see Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at\n1668.\n\n                                D\n\n     We conclude that the contractor contribution ban is not\nfatally underinclusive. There is no doubt that “the proffered\nstate interest actually underlies the law,” and that it can “fairly\nbe said” that the statute “advance[s] a[] genuinely substantial\ngovernmental interest.” Blount, 61 F.3d at 946 (citations and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiffs may well be\nright that the ban would be even more effective if it swept in\nmore potential contributors. But § 30119 “aims squarely at the\nconduct most likely to undermine” the important interests that\nunderlie it, and “[w]e will not punish [Congress] for leaving\nopen more, rather than fewer, avenues of expression, especially\nwhen there is no indication that the selective restriction of\nspeech reflects a pretextual motive.” Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct.\nat 1668-70.\n\n    Accordingly, and in light of the analysis of the preceding\nParts, we reject the plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenge.\n\f                                 58\n\n                                 VI\n\n     In addition to their First Amendment claim, the plaintiffs\nchallenge § 30119 under the equal protection component of the\nFifth Amendment. Equal protection is violated, they maintain,\nbecause the statute subjects individual contractors like\nthemselves to a ban that it does not apply to two categories of\nsimilarly situated persons: (1) entities and individuals associated\nwith firms that have government contracts (i.e., PACs of\ncontracting corporations; officers, employees, and shareholders\nof contracting corporations; and individuals who control\ncontracting LLCs); and (2) individuals who are regular\nemployees rather than contractors.\n\n     If this argument sounds familiar, it should. It is the same\nargument that we have just considered, and rejected, when\nclothed in the garb of a First Amendment claim that § 30119 is\ntoo underinclusive to satisfy the “closely drawn” standard.40\nNow dressing their argument as an equal protection claim, the\nplaintiffs insist that we must evaluate it under strict scrutiny.\nThat is so, they say, because “the right to make a political\ncontribution is a fundamental right protected by the First\nAmendment,” and because “strict scrutiny is required when a\nlaw . . . ‘impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or\nimplicitly protected by the Constitution.’” Pls. Br. 25 (quoting\nSan Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 17\n(1973)).\n\n     We reject this doctrinal gambit, which would require strict\nscrutiny notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s determination that\nthe “closely drawn” standard is the appropriate one under the\n\n\n     40\n       As noted above, the plaintiffs’ underinclusiveness argument\nincluded a third category as well: individuals seeking a miscellany of\nother government benefits or positions. See supra note 30.\n\f                                59\n\nFirst Amendment. Although the Court has on occasion applied\nstrict scrutiny in examining equal protection challenges in cases\ninvolving First Amendment rights, it has done so only when a\nFirst Amendment analysis would itself have required such\nscrutiny.41 There is consequently no case in which the Supreme\nCourt has employed strict scrutiny to analyze a contribution\nrestriction under equal protection principles. Indeed, the\nplaintiffs acknowledge that they know of no case in any court\n“in which an equal-protection challenge to contribution limits\nsucceeded where a First Amendment one did not.” Wagner, 901\nF. Supp. 2d at 112. This will not be the first.\n\n     As we explained in Ruggiero v. FCC, “[a]lthough equal\nprotection analysis focuses upon the validity of the classification\nrather than the speech restriction, ‘the critical questions asked\nare the same.’ We believe that the same level of scrutiny . . . is\ntherefore appropriate in both contexts.” 317 F.3d 239, 247 (D.C.\nCir. 2003) (en banc) (quoting Cmty.-Serv. Broad. of Mid-Am.,\nInc. v. FCC, 593 F.2d 1102 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (en banc)).42 That\nhas been this court’s consistent view. See, e.g., Int’l Ass’n of\nMachinists v. FEC, 678 F.2d 1092, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (en\nbanc) (observing that “the nature and quality of the legislative\naction at issue determine the intensity of judicial review of\nintertwined equal protection, First Amendment claims”); see\n\n\n\n    41\n       See Austin v. Mich. Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652, 655,\n666 (1990) (applying strict scrutiny in determining whether\nrestrictions on independent expenditures by corporations but not\nunincorporated associations passed muster under the Equal Protection\nClause), overruled on other grounds by Citizens United, 558 U.S. at\n365.\n    42\n       In Ruggiero, that level of scrutiny was “heightened rational\nbasis.” 317 F.3d at 247.\n\f                                   60\n\nalso Reform Party of Allegheny Cnty. v. Allegheny Cnty. Dep’t\nof Elections, 174 F.3d 305, 314 (3d Cir. 1999) (en banc).\n\n     It is certainly true that the Court “has occasionally fused the\nFirst Amendment into the Equal Protection Clause” in\nconcluding that “content-based discrimination” is not a\nlegitimate government interest because it “violates the First\nAmendment.” R.A.V., 505 U.S. at 384 n.4.43 And it is likewise\ntrue that the Court has sometimes examined campaign finance\nclassifications to determine whether they are invidious in the\ncontext of a First Amendment analysis, see Williams-Yulee, 135\nS. Ct. at 1668-70, and sometimes in the context of an equal\nprotection analysis, see Buckley, 424 U.S. at 31-33, 105 &\nn.143. But in a case like this one, in which there is no doubt that\nthe interests invoked in support of the challenged legislative\nclassification are legitimate, and no doubt that the classification\nwas designed to vindicate those interests rather than disfavor a\nparticular speaker or viewpoint, the challengers “can fare no\nbetter under the Equal Protection Clause than under the First\nAmendment itself.” City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc.,\n475 U.S. 41, 55 n.4 (1986).44 For the reasons discussed in the\n\n\n     43\n       See City of Ladue, 512 U.S. at 51 n.9 (observing that regulatory\ndistinctions based on the content of speech “may fall afoul of the\nEqual Protection Clause”); Police Dep’t of Chi. v. Mosley, 408 U.S.\n92, 95 (1972) (observing that “the equal protection claim . . . is closely\nintertwined with First Amendment interests” when a classification\ndiscriminates on the basis of the content of speech); see also Carey v.\nBrown, 447 U.S. 455, 463 n.7 (1980) (describing Mosley as a\n“pronouncement that the First and Fourteenth Amendments forbid\ndiscrimination in the regulation of expression on the basis of the\ncontent of that expression” (emphasis added)).\n     44\n      Cf.

First, there is no\ndispute regarding the legitimacy or importance of the interests\nthat support the contractor contribution ban. In § 30119,\nCongress was plainly not attempting “to reduce the amount of\nmoney in politics, or to restrict the political participation of\nsome in order to enhance the relative influence of others.”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1441 (citing, e.g., Ariz. Free Enter.\nClub’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 131 S. Ct. 2806, 2825-26\n(2011)). Nor did it create a mechanism “to level the playing\nfield, or to level electoral opportunities, or to equaliz[e] the\nfinancial resources of candidates.” Id. at 1450 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Nor did it “‘disfavor[] a particular\nspeaker or viewpoint,’” Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1668\n(quoting Brown, 131 S. Ct. at 2740), or favor incumbents over\nchallengers, cf. Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 249, 253\n(2006) (plurality opinion). To the contrary, the interests\nsupporting the statute are ones that the Supreme Court has long\napproved -- indeed, endorsed -- as legitimate and important\ngrounds for restricting campaign contributions and certain\nrelated associational freedoms.\n\n    Second, the contractor contribution ban rests on not one but\ntwo such interests. The ban is not only supported by the\n“compelling” interest in protecting against quid pro quo\ncorruption and its appearance, McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444-\n45, commonly at issue in campaign finance cases. It is also\nsupported by the “obviously important interest[]” in protecting\n\n\nviolated the First Amendment as impermissibly underinclusive).\n\f                               62\n\nmerit-based public administration, Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at\n564, commonly at issue in cases involving limits on partisan\nactivities by government employees.\n\n     The long historical experience recounted in Part III further\nmakes clear that these important concerns supporting § 30119\nare neither theoretical nor antiquated, but rather are grounded in\nunhappy experience stretching to the present day. And for the\nreasons set forth in Parts IV through VI, we also conclude that\nthe statute employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary\nabridgement of associational freedoms, and does not deprive the\nplaintiffs of equal protection of the laws. Accordingly, we\nuphold the statute against all of the plaintiffs’ constitutional\nchallenges.\n\n                                                     So ordered.\n\f",

Because the concerns that spurred the\noriginal bar remain as important today as when the statute was\nenacted, and because the statute is closely drawn to avoid\nunnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms, we reject the\nplaintiffs’ challenge.\n\n                                 I\n\n       The statute at issue, 52 U.S.C. § 30119(a)(1), makes it\nunlawful for any person “who enters into any contract with the\nUnited States . . . directly or indirectly to make any contribution\n. . . to any political party, committee, or candidate for public\noffice or to any person for any political purpose.” This\nprohibition applies “between the commencement of negotiations\n. . . and . . . the completion of performance” of the contract. Id.\nThe Federal Election Commission (FEC) has construed the\nsection not to apply “in connection with State or local\nelections.” 11 C.F.R. § 115.2(a).\n\f                                 3\n\n     The plaintiffs are three individuals who hold or have held\nfederal contracts. The first two, Lawrence Brown and Jan\nMiller, spent much of their careers as full-time employees of the\nU.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Each\nwent back to work at USAID under a personal services contract\nafter retirement. The third plaintiff, Wendy Wagner, is a law\nprofessor. In 2011, the Administrative Conference of the United\nStates (ACUS) hired Wagner under a consulting contract to\nprepare a report about science and regulation.\n\n     All three plaintiffs wanted to make campaign contributions\nduring the 2012 federal elections, but each was barred from\ndoing so by § 30119. On October 19, 2011, they filed suit\nagainst the FEC in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Columbia, challenging the statute’s constitutionality.\nThe plaintiffs contend that § 30119 violates their rights under\nboth the First Amendment and the equal protection component\nof the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause.\n\n     The plaintiffs have been careful to frame their challenge\nnarrowly. First, they challenge the constitutionality of § 30119\n“only as it applies to plaintiffs and other individual contractors,”\nnot as it applies to contractors that are corporations or other\nkinds of entities. Pls. Br. 1. Second, they do not challenge the\nstatute as the FEC might seek to apply it to a contractor’s\nindependent expenditures on electoral advocacy, as opposed to\nhis or her contributions to candidates, parties, or political action\ncommittees (PACs). Id. at 40 n.5 (stating that the “[p]laintiffs\nhave no interest in making independent expenditures”); Oral\nArg. Recording 26:59-27:06 (same). Nor do they challenge the\nlaw as the Commission might seek to apply it to donations to\nPACs that themselves make only independent expenditures,\ncommonly known as “Super PACs.” Oral Arg. Recording\n25:59-26:33 (“Super PACs . . . . are not at issue here; none of\nmy clients wants to make a contribution to them or anything like\n\f                                 4\n\nthem.”); id. 26:59-27:06 (same). In short, the plaintiffs\nchallenge § 30119 only insofar as it bans campaign\ncontributions by individual contractors to candidates, parties, or\ntraditional PACs that make contributions to candidates and\nparties.\n\n     After considering the merits of this challenge, the district\ncourt granted summary judgment in favor of the FEC. Wagner\nv. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (D.D.C. 2012). On appeal, a\npanel of this court held, sua sponte, that the district court lacked\njurisdiction to reach the merits of the constitutional claims\nbecause the special judicial review provision of the Federal\nElection Campaign Act (FECA) “grants exclusive merits\njurisdiction to the en banc court of appeals.” Wagner v. FEC,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">717</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1007</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1011 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citing 2 U.S.C. § 437h,\nnow codified at 52 U.S.C. § 30110). The panel therefore\nremanded the case to the district court to make appropriate\nfindings of fact, and then to certify those facts and the relevant\nconstitutional questions to this court sitting en banc. Id. at 1017.\n\n      The case has now returned to us. But time does not stand\nstill, and some important facts have shifted in the years since\nthis litigation began. The plaintiffs advise us that both Wagner\nand Brown have now completed their federal contracts and\nhence are once again free to make campaign contributions. See\nBrown Supp. Mootness Decl. ¶ 3; Second Wagner Supp. Decl.\n¶ 2. Brown, at least, has already done so. See Brown Supp.\nMootness Decl. ¶ 3. Accordingly, Wagner’s and Brown’s\nclaims are moot. See, e.g., Arizonans for Official English v.\nArizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118093\"><a href=\"/opinion/118093/arizonans-for-official-english-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 67-72 (1997) (holding that the plaintiff’s\ndeparture from her position as a state employee mooted her First\n\f                                   5\n\nAmendment challenge to a law regulating the speech of state\nemployees).1\n\n     Miller’s contract is ongoing, however, and his constitutional\nclaims therefore remain alive. But the mootness of the other\nplaintiffs’ claims matters because Miller’s injury is notably\nnarrower than theirs. Whereas Wagner and Brown alleged that\nthey wanted to support a variety of political “causes,” and that\nthey had given to “PACs” or “political committees” in the past,\nMiller tells us only that he wants to contribute to “candidates\nrunning for federal offices and/or their political parties.”\nCompare Wagner Decl. ¶ 6, and Brown Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8, with\nMiller Decl. ¶ 7.

Brown also plans to seek\nfuture work with the federal government, “either as an employee or as\na contractor,” and therefore “may or may not be subject to” § 30119\nat some future point.

It will suffice for us to\nproceed under the rubric of the former, since it is -- if anything\n-- the less deferential standard. In doing so, however, we will\ntake into account the considerations that the Supreme Court has\n\n\nperforms through its employees.’” NTEU, 513 U.S. at 465-66\n(quoting Pickering, 391 U.S. at 568).\n\f                                11\n\nindicated are particularly relevant in evaluating restrictions the\ngovernment imposes in its role as employer. We therefore now\nproceed to examine whether, with respect to § 30119, the\ngovernment has “‘demonstrate[d] a sufficiently important\ninterest and employ[ed] means closely drawn to avoid\nunnecessary abridgment of associational freedoms.’”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at\n25).\n\n                                III\n\n     Our initial responsibility under the “closely drawn” standard\nis to determine whether the government has advanced a\n“sufficiently important interest” in support of § 30119. The\nFEC argues that there are two such interests, each of which has\nbeen accepted by the Supreme Court as sufficient to warrant\nappropriate restrictions on First Amendment rights. We briefly\naddress the sufficiency of each of those interests in the abstract,\nbefore turning to whether they are properly invoked in light of\nthe particular problems that § 30119 addresses.\n\n                                A\n\n    The two interests asserted by the government are: (1)\nprotection against quid pro quo corruption and its appearance,\nand (2) protection against interference with merit-based public\nadministration.\n\n     The first interest is the most significant, as the Supreme\nCourt has repeatedly held that “the Government’s interest in\npreventing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance [is]\n‘sufficiently important’” to justify the regulation of campaign\ncontributions. McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1445 (quoting\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27). In fact, the Court has “stated that\nthe same interest may properly be labeled ‘compelling,’ so that\n\f                                12\n\nthe interest would satisfy even strict scrutiny.” Id. at 1445\n(citing FEC v. Nat’l Conservative Political Action Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111370\"><a href=\"/opinion/111370/federal-election-commn-v-national-conservative-political-action-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 496-97 (1985)). As the Court has explained, “[t]hat\nLatin phrase captures the notion of a direct exchange of an\nofficial act for money,” id. at 1441, and such exchanges\nundermine “the integrity of our system of representative\ndemocracy,” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27. “Of almost equal\nconcern [is] . . . the appearance of corruption,” which threatens\n“‘confidence in the system of representative Government.’” Id.\nat 27 (quoting Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 565). Therefore, if\nthe FEC shows that § 30119 furthers the interest in combating\nquid pro quo corruption or its appearance, that will suffice to\nclear the “closely drawn” standard’s first hurdle.7\n\n     The second interest is also significant, and in combination\nwith the first makes this case even stronger for the FEC.\nAlthough the Supreme Court has identified no congressional\nobjective beyond protection against quid pro quo corruption and\nits appearance that warrants imposing campaign finance\nrestrictions on the citizenry at large, see McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct.\nat 1450; Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 359, it has “upheld a\nnarrow class of speech restrictions that operate to the\ndisadvantage of certain persons, . . . . based on an interest in\nallowing governmental entities to perform their functions,”\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 341 (citing, inter alia, Letter\nCarriers, 413 U.S. at 557). That narrow class of approved\nspeech restrictions includes the Hatch Act’s limits on political\nactivities by federal employees, which, as the Court put it in\nCitizens United, rest on the principle that “‘[f]ederal service\nshould depend upon meritorious performance rather than\npolitical service.’” 558 U.S. at 341 (quoting Letter Carriers,\n413 U.S. at 557).\n\n\n    7\n      Throughout this opinion, when we use the terms “corruption” or\nits “appearance,” we refer to the quid pro quo variety.\n\f                                 13\n\n     The Court’s cases indicate that this interest in protecting\nmerit-based public administration has two distinct but mutually\nreinforcing components. The first is that the Government\n“operate effectively and fairly,” Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at\n564, which in turn comprises a series of interrelated concerns.\nThe “‘interest of the [government], as an employer, in\npromoting the efficiency of the public services it performs\nthrough its employees,’” id. (emphasis added) (quoting\nPickering, 391 U.S. at 568), is perhaps best captured by the\nCourt’s rationale for upholding the original 1876 employee\ncontribution ban: “If . . . a refusal [to make political\ncontributions] may lead to putting good men out of the service,\nliberal payments may be made the ground for keeping poor ones\nin.” Ex parte Curtis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"90682\"><a href=\"/opinion/90682/ex-parte-curtis/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 375 (1882). The related\ninterest in operating fairly is the “great end of Government -- the\nimpartial execution of the laws.” Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at\n565. “It seems fundamental,” the Court has said, that “those\nworking for [Government] agencies, should administer the law\nin accordance with the will of Congress, rather than in\naccordance with their own or the will of a political party.” Id.\nat 564-65. In this regard, “it is not only important that the\nGovernment and its employees in fact avoid practicing political\njustice, but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be\navoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative\nGovernment is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.” Id. at\n565.\n\n     The flip side of the interest in governmental efficiency and\nfairness is the employees’ interest in being “sufficiently free\nfrom improper influence” or coercion, which the government\nmay also vindicate on their behalf. Id. As the Court has\nexplained, it upheld the Hatch Act’s restrictions on “political\ncampaigning” by federal employees in part because, in the\nCourt’s “judgment[,] . . . congressional subordination of those\nactivities was permissible to safeguard the core interests of\n\f                                  14\n\nindividual belief and association.” Elrod v.

That history demonstrates that\nCongress did indeed aim to protect the two interests articulated\nby the FEC, and that its concerns on both fronts were well\nwarranted.\n\n     1. Congress began to tackle problems related to the political\nactivity of those who work for the government in the late 19th\ncentury. See generally Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 555-60. It\nstarted by prohibiting most federal employees “from requesting,\ngiving to, or receiving from, any other . . . employee of the\nGovernment, any money or property . . . for political purposes.”\nAct of Aug. 15, 1876, ch. 287, § 6, 19 Stat. 143, 169. In\nupholding that early statute as “within the just scope of\nlegislative power,” the Supreme Court declared that its “evident\npurpose” was “to promote efficiency and integrity in the\ndischarge of official duties” and “to protect the classes of . . .\nemployees provided for from being compelled to make\ncontributions for [political] purposes through fear of dismissal\nif they refused.” Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. at 373-74.\n\n    The 1876 statute was limited to employees of the Executive\nBranch. In the 1883 Pendleton Act, Congress took the next step,\nmaking it a crime for its own members, among others, to “solicit\n\f                                 16\n\nor receive” political contributions from federal workers, ch. 27,\n§ 11, 22 Stat. 403, 406, and for those workers to “give or hand\nover” such contributions, id. § 14, 22 Stat. at 407.9 The\nPendleton Act further declared that “no person in the public\nservice is for that reason under any obligations to contribute to\nany political fund.” Id. § 2, 22 Stat. at 404. And it “authorized\nthe President to promulgate rules to carry the Act into effect and\ncreated the Civil Service Commission as the agency or\nadministrator of the Act.” Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 558.\n\n     In 1925, Congress broadened the ban to include solicitation\nand receipt by congressional challengers as well as incumbents,\nwhile continuing to tweak the range of forbidden donors. See\nFederal Corrupt Practices Act, 1925, ch. 368, sec. 312, § 118, 43\nStat. 1070, 1073. When Congressman Harry Wurzbach was\nsubsequently indicted for receiving contributions from federal\nemployees, the Supreme Court again upheld the statute as a\nproper exercise of Congress’ powers. United States v.\nWurzbach, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"101505\"><a href=\"/opinion/101505/united-states-v-wurzbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1930); see Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 98.\n\n    Alongside these early bans on campaign contributions,\nCongress and the Executive Branch incrementally expanded the\nscope of the nascent civil service system, imposing limitations\non political activity by employees and implementing merit-\nbased hiring rules. See Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 557-60.\n\n\n     9\n      Because the Pendleton Act prohibited accepting contributions\nfrom “any person receiving any salary or compensation from moneys\nderived from the Treasury of the United States,” id. § 11, 22 Stat. at\n406, it textually encompassed contributions from the various\ngovernment contractors of the era -- ranging from experts hired to\nsurvey Indian lands, see Contract for Surveying Public Lands, 10 Op.\nAtt’y Gen. 261, 261 (1862), to a contractor hired to make copies of\npatent drawings for the Commissioner of Patents, see Letting\nContracts--Advertisement, 15 Op. Att’y Gen. 538 (1876).\n\f                                17\n\nThose efforts culminated in the Hatch Act of 1939, which aimed\nto consolidate civil service reforms and “to combat\ndemonstrated ill effects of Government employees’ partisan\npolitical activities.” NTEU, 513 U.S. at 471. As the Court has\nexplained, Congress’ purpose was to protect merit-based\nadministration, including ensuring governmental efficiency and\nfairness and shielding government personnel from political\ncoercion. See Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 564-66.\n\n    The Hatch Act was particularly aimed at certain notorious\nabuses that occurred during the 1936 and 1938 election\ncampaigns. See id. at 559-60. Responding to reports that\nworkers paid by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) had\nbeen coerced to contribute to the Democratic Party, for\nexample,10 the Hatch Act criminalized accepting political\ncontributions from anyone known to be receiving\n“compensation, employment, or other benefit” from work relief\nfunds. Hatch Act, ch. 410, §§ 5, 8, 53 Stat. 1147, 1148.\n\n     The Act imposed other restrictions on political activity by\ngovernment employees as well, including barring them from\n“tak[ing] any active part in political management or in political\ncampaigns.” Id. § 9(a), 53 Stat. at 1148. In subsequently\nupholding those restrictions against a First Amendment\nchallenge, the Supreme Court noted that they were “not\ndissimilar in purpose from the statutes against political\n\n\n    10\n      See, e.g., 84 CONG. REC. 9598 (1939) (statement of Rep.\nTaylor) (reporting that WPA workers had been required to place $3 to\n$5 out of their $30 monthly pay under a Democratic donkey\npaperweight on their supervisor’s desk); see also REPORT OF THE\nSPECIAL COMM. TO INVESTIGATE SENATORIAL CAMPAIGN\nEXPENDITURES AND USE OF GOVERNMENTAL FUNDS IN 1938, S. REP.\nNO. 76-1, pt. 1, at 8-33, 39 (1939) (recounting WPA abuses and\nrecommending reforms).\n\f                               18\n\ncontributions of money.” Mitchell, 330 U.S. at 98. Congress,\nthe Court said, “recognizes danger to the [civil] service in that\npolitical rather than official effort may earn advancement and to\nthe public in that governmental favor may be channeled through\npolitical connections.” Id. Twenty-six years later, the Court\nagain rejected a First Amendment challenge to the same\nrestrictions. See Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 551.\n\n     Although the 1939 Hatch Act focused on public employees\nand recipients of work relief, exploitation of government\ncontractors drew congressional interest as well. Arguing that the\noriginal bill “does not go far enough,” Congressman J. Will\nTaylor pointed to the coercion of contractors in the “‘celebrated’\nDemocratic campaign book” scandal as a prime example of\n“political immorality and skullduggery that should not be\ntolerated.” 84 CONG. REC. 9598-99 (1939). Representative\nTaylor recounted that, at the behest of the Democratic National\nCommittee, party representatives paid visits to government\ncontractors, reminding each one “of the business he had received\nfrom the Government” and explaining that the contractor was\nexpected to buy a number of the party’s souvenir convention\nbooks -- at $250 each -- “in proportion to the amount of\nGovernment business he had enjoyed.” Id. In addition, “large\nconcerns, which directly or indirectly, benefitted from\nGovernment business, were . . . by sinister methods, convinced\nof the importance of taking advertising space in the book.” Id.;\nsee also 81 CONG. REC. 6429-30 (1937) (statement of Rep.\nTaylor) (citing newspaper report regarding solicitation of\ncontractors in Tennessee). Taylor urged that the bill “should be\namended to include rackets of this character.” 84 CONG. REC.\n9599 (1939).\n\f                                 19\n\n     The next year, as the scandal surrounding the campaign\nbooks persisted,11 Congress took up that task in a package of\namendments to the Hatch Act. Denouncing contracting abuses\nas “[t]he greatest source of corruption in American politics\ntoday,” Senator Harry Byrd argued for a broad amendment that\nwould “prevent those who are making money out of\ngovernmental contracts from making contributions to any\npolitical party,” and thereby “prevent them from making\ncontributions which may be considered in some instances as\nbribery in order to secure governmental contracts for\nthemselves.” 86 CONG. REC. 2982 (1940). Thus, in addition to\nspecifically banning the purchase of goods (such as the\ncampaign books) from political parties, see Act of July 19, 1940,\nch. 640, sec. 4, § 13(c), 54 Stat. 767, 770-71, Congress enacted\nthe general contractor contribution ban that is now before us, id.\n§ 5(a), 54 Stat. at 772.\n\n     The statute that Congress passed in 1940 has retained its\nessential features since that time. Then, as now, it barred any\nperson or firm negotiating or performing a federal contract from\ncontributing “to any political party, committee, or candidate for\npublic office or to any person for any political purpose or use.”\nId. (codified as amended at 52 U.S.C. § 30119(a)(1)).\n\n     2. Just as the Hatch Act was spurred by outrage over\nmisconduct in the 1936 and 1938 elections, “deeply disturbing\nexamples” of corruption “surfacing after the 1972 election” led\nto the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) Amendments of\n\n\n     11\n      See, e.g., 86 CONG. REC. 9362 (1940) (statement of Rep.\nKnutson) (recounting advertising rates for the 1940 Democratic\ncampaign book and speculating that “all of this space will be taken by\nGovernment contractors,” who would be “solicit[ed] . . . at the point\nof a gun”); see also Editorial, That Convention Book, N.Y. TIMES,\nMar. 13, 1940, at 22.\n\f                                 20\n\n1974. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27 & n.28 (citing Buckley v. Valeo,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"328884\"><a href=\"/opinion/328884/james-l-buckley-united-states-senator-from-the-state-of-new-york-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 839-840 & nn. 36-38 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (en banc)).\nParticularly important for our purposes, those “disturbing\nexamples” included a variety of efforts to channel government\ncontracts to President Nixon’s political supporters and to exact\ncontributions from existing contractors, both of which figured\nprominently in the Senate Watergate Committee’s report. See,\ne.g., FINAL REPORT OF THE SELECT COMM. ON PRESIDENTIAL\nCAMPAIGN ACTIVITIES, S. REP. NO. 93-981, at 368 (1974)\n[hereinafter WATERGATE REPORT] (describing the so-called\n“Responsiveness Program,” pursuant to which agencies were to\nensure that “[t]he letting of Government grants, contracts, and\nloans” was directed at “meet[ing] reelection needs”); id. at 412\n(recounting evidence that “campaign officials were participating\nin the selection process for the awards of GSA architectural and\nengineering design contracts”); id. at 1210 & n.85 (separate\nviews of Sen. Weicker) (recounting “evidence of quid pro quos\nfor the contracts from” four cabinet departments and six\nagencies).12\n\n    As the Watergate Committee recognized, much of the\nconduct that it exposed squarely implicated the contractor\ncontribution statute (then 18 U.S.C. § 611). See WATERGATE\nREPORT at 440. The Committee reported that the 1972 election\n\n\n    12\n       See also WATERGATE REPORT at 440 (“There is evidence that\nplans were laid for Government officials and others to solicit\ncampaign contributions from minority recipients of Federal grants,\nloans, and contracts. Moreover, the committee has obtained evidence\nthat these plans were in part consummated.”); id. at 384-85\n(recounting testimony that a contract was awarded to a Nixon\nfundraiser “based solely on political motivations” and “‘rammed down\nthe throats’ of Department officials”). In the passage of our Buckley\nopinion later relied upon by the Supreme Court, this court leaned\nheavily on the Watergate Report. See 519 F.2d at 839 nn.35-36, 38.\n\f                               21\n\ngave rise to the first indictments of contributors under that\nstatute, resulting in guilty pleas and then-maximum fines. Id. at\n486-89. “In view of the abuses discovered,” it recommended\nthat Congress take care not to “lessen the penalties” or otherwise\n“weaken[] . . . the law in this area.” Id. at 444. The Committee\nfurther concluded that the statutory scheme was “deficient in\nfailing to provide a civil penalty,” which made it difficult to\naddress “nonflagrant cases,” and recommended that the new\nFederal Election Commission be given primary civil\nenforcement jurisdiction with respect to, inter alia, the\ncontractor contribution statute. Id. at 566-67.\n\n     A few months after the Watergate Committee made its\nrecommendations, Congress increased the maximum fine for\nviolations of the contractor contribution statute from $5,000 to\n$25,000, see FECA Amendments of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-443,\n§ 101(e)(2), 88 Stat. 1263, 1267, and authorized the\nCommission to initiate civil enforcement actions for violations\nof that provision, see id. sec. 208(a), § 314(a)(7), 88 Stat. at\n1285.13 It also strengthened enforcement of the longstanding\nbans on campaign contributions by corporations and labor\nunions. See id. § 101(e)(1), 88 Stat. at 1267; see also Beaumont,\n539 U.S. at 152-53 (recounting the history of those bans). And,\nas is well known, the 1974 amendments also imposed generally\napplicable ceilings on campaign contributions.               See\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1445; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 7.\nFECA’s “primary purpose,” the Court has said, “was to limit\nquid pro quo corruption and its appearance.” McCutcheon, 134\nS. Ct. at 1444 (citing Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27).\n\n\n\n\n    13\n      That monetary penalty has since been superseded by FECA’s\nown penalty scheme. See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(a)(5)-(6) (civil\npenalties); id. § 30109(d) (criminal penalties).\n\f                                 22\n\n     Finally, in 1976, Congress incorporated the contractor\ncontribution ban into FECA itself. See FECA Amendments of\n1976, Pub. L. No. 94-283, sec. 112(2), § 322, 90 Stat. 475,\n492-93. Over the subsequent decades, both FECA and the civil\nservice laws have been further amended. Those amendments\nlifted most restrictions on campaign contributions by federal\nemployees.14 At the same time, however, they retained some of\nthe more direct limits on government employees’ political\nactivities, including barring most federal employees from\nsoliciting or accepting political contributions, running for office\nin partisan elections, and hosting political fundraisers. See 5\nU.S.C. §§ 7323(a), 7324(a). The Civil Service Reform Act of\n1978 also afforded federal employees protection against\n“prohibited personnel practices,” 5 U.S.C. § 2302, including\ndiscrimination on the basis of political affiliation and coercion\nto make political contributions, id. § 2302(b)(1)(E), (b)(3), and\nallowed them to seek redress through the Office of Special\nCounsel and the Merit Systems Protection Board, 5 U.S.C.\n§§ 1214-15, 1221. Congress has left the contractor contribution\nban in place, however, without change. See 52 U.S.C. § 30119.\n\n     3. As we have recounted, Congress enacted § 30119 in the\naftermath of a national scandal involving a pay-to-play scheme\nfor federal contracts. The statute was itself the outgrowth of a\ndecades-long congressional effort to prevent corruption and\nensure the merit-based administration of the national\ngovernment. And it was followed by subsequent scandals that\nled to further legislative refinements, again motivated by\nconcerns over corruption and merit protection.\n\n\n\n    14\n      See, e.g., Hatch Act Reform Amendments of 1993, Pub. L. No.\n103-94, sec. 2(a), § 7323, 107 Stat. 1001, 1002 (1993) (codified at 5\nU.S.C. § 7323); id. § 4(b), 107 Stat. at 1005 (codified at 18 U.S.C.\n§ 603(c)).\n\f                                   23\n\n     This historical pedigree is significant. As the Court said in\nBeaumont, “[j]udicial deference is particularly warranted where,\nas here, we deal with a congressional judgment that has\nremained essentially unchanged throughout a century of ‘careful\nlegislative adjustment.’” 539 U.S. at 162 n.9 (quoting FEC v.\nNat’l Right to Work Comm., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110819\"><a href=\"/opinion/110819/fec-v-national-right-to-work-committee/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209 (1982)).\nMoreover, as we discuss in Part V below, the lineage of the\nstatute makes clear that its objects are the legitimate and\nimportant purposes that the Commission claims they are.\n\n                                   C\n\n     More recent evidence confirms that human nature has not\nchanged since corrupt quid pro quos and other attacks on merit-\nbased administration first spurred the development of the present\nlegislative scheme. Of course, we would not expect to find --\nand we cannot demand -- continuing evidence of large-scale\nquid pro quo corruption or coercion involving federal contractor\ncontributions because such contributions have been banned\nsince 1940. As the Supreme Court has recognized, “no data can\nbe marshaled to capture perfectly the counterfactual world in\nwhich” an existing campaign finance restriction “do[es] not\nexist.” McCutcheon, 134 S.

See id. at 1451 n.7; Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 357.\n\n     Unfortunately, as was the case with the coordinated\nexpenditure limits at issue in Colorado Republican, “[d]espite\nyears of enforcement of the challenged” contractor contribution\nban, “substantial evidence demonstrates” that individuals and\nfirms continue to “test the limits of the current law[s],” 533 U.S.\nat 457 -- at both the federal and state levels. This experience\nreadily confirms that the government’s fear of the consequences\nof removing the current ban is not unwarranted.\n\n     1. We begin with Congress itself, where a number of\ncorruption scandals point to the danger that contributions from\ngovernment contractors would pose. Indeed, although the\nplaintiffs contend that Members of Congress are insulated from\nthe contracting process, see infra Part III.D.1, many significant\ncongressional corruption cases involve quid pro quo agreements\nregarding contracts. In 2005, for example, Representative\nRandy “Duke” Cunningham pled guilty to accepting millions of\ndollars in bribes in exchange for influencing Defense\nDepartment contract awards. See Plea Agreement at 4-6, ECF\nNo. 40 ex. 2, United States v. Cunningham, No. 3:05-cr-2137\n(S.D. Cal. Nov. 28, 2005). Mitchell Wade, the defense\ncontractor who pled guilty to bribing Cunningham, admitted to\nmaking illegal “straw” contributions to two other Members of\nCongress as well, both of whom he targeted for their perceived\n“ability to request appropriations funding that would benefit” his\ncompany. Statement of Offenses at 12, United States v. Wade,\nNo. 1:06-cr-49 (D.D.C. Feb. 24, 2006).16\n\n\n     16\n      Wade and the contracting corporation later agreed to pay a $1\nmillion civil penalty for violating, inter alia, § 30119 (then 2 U.S.C.\n§ 441c). Conciliation Agreement at 6-7, In re MZM, Inc. and Mitchell\nWade, Matter Under Review 5666 (FEC, Oct. 30, 2007).\n\f                               25\n\n     In 2006, Representative Bob Ney similarly pled guilty to a\nseries of quid pro quos with the lobbyist Jack Abramoff,\nincluding steering a “multi-million dollar” contract for a House\nof Representatives infrastructure project to one of Abramoff’s\nclients. See Factual Basis for Plea at 6, United States v. Ney,\nNo. 1:06-cr-272 (D.D.C. Sept. 15, 2006). And in 1981, Senator\nHarrison Williams was convicted on bribery and corruption\ncharges for crimes exposed in the FBI’s Abscam investigation.\nWilliams “agreed to use his position as a United States Senator\nto obtain government contracts” for titanium to be produced by\na mine financed by fictional Arab businessmen.

But as the Supreme Court has explained, “laws making\ncriminal the giving and taking of bribes deal with only the most\nblatant and specific attempts of those with money to influence\ngovernmental action.” Buckley, 424 U.S. at 27-28. Although\nthe criminal cases certainly confirm the appetite for corruption\nin contracting -- and the availability of channels for carrying it\nout -- corruption and its appearance are no doubt more\nwidespread in the contracting process than our criminal dockets\nreflect.\n\n    The Executive Branch is also an obvious site of potential\ncorruption in the contracting process, since its agencies are the\nones that ultimately award contracts. This was a key focus of\ncongressional concern during the Watergate hearings. See supra\nPart III.B.2; see also, e.g., WATERGATE REPORT at 409\n(describing a consultant who “was made to feel that his\ncontinued success in obtaining Government contracts would, in\nsignificant degree, be dependent on his contributing to the\n\f                                  26\n\nPresident’s reelection”).17 Many more recent instances of\ncorruption or its appearance in the agency contracting process\nare collected in the Defense Department’s aptly named\nEncyclopedia of Ethical Failure. See generally DEP’T OF\nDEFENSE, OFFICE OF GEN. COUNSEL, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF\nETHICAL FAILURE 4-58, 77-78, 82, 84-88, 132-46 (updated\n2014).\n\n     2. Further evidence comes from the states, many of which\nhave enacted pay-to-play laws in response to their own recent\nexperiences. At least seventeen states now limit or prohibit\ncampaign contributions from some or all state contractors or\nlicensees.18 The fact that many states have such laws shows that\n\n     17\n       Another notorious pay-to-play contracting scheme of the\nWatergate era involved Vice President Spiro Agnew. In 1973, a\nfederal investigation uncovered evidence that Agnew had accepted\nbribes (including campaign contributions) in exchange for\ninfrastructure contracts while serving as Baltimore County Executive\nand Governor of Maryland -- and that he had continued to request\npayments from contractors as Vice President, “stat[ing] expressly that\nhe hoped to be able to be helpful . . . with respect to the awarding of\nFederal engineering contracts.” Exposition of the Evidence at 3-4,\nUnited States v. Agnew, No. 73-0535 (D. Md. Oct. 10, 1973),\nreprinted in FBI Records: Spiro Agnew, Part 16, at 130,\nhttp://vault.fbi.gov/Spiro%20Agnew. The Attorney General agreed\nthat Agnew could plead nolo contendere to a single count of tax\nevasion if he resigned his office, which he did. See Transcript of Plea\nHearing at 7-8, United States v. Agnew, No. 73-0535 (D. Md. Oct. 10,\n1973), available at http://research.archives.gov/description/279170.\n     18\n       The laws of Hawaii and West Virginia most closely track the\ntext and design of § 30119. See HAW. REV. STAT. § 11-355; W. VA.\nCODE § 3-8-12(d). Other states have tailored their restrictions\ndifferently -- often more broadly than the federal model in some\nrespects, such as by sweeping in the individual principals of\ncontracting firms, and more narrowly in others, such as by targeting\n\f                                 27\n\nthe federal statute is no outlier. Moreover, the corruption\nscandals that prompted the adoption of those laws further\ndemonstrate the dangers that § 30119 helps stave off at the\nfederal level.19\n\n     New Jersey’s law, for example, was enacted in the\naftermath of a state investigation finding that a $392 million\ncontract for a failed project went to a firm that had made\nextensive campaign contributions to state candidates and\npolitical committees. See STATE OF N.J. COMM’N OF\nINVESTIGATION, N.J. ENHANCED MOTOR VEHICLE INSPECTION\nCONTRACT 1-2, 62-65 (2002). Similarly, Illinois’ law was\npassed after former Governor George Ryan was convicted of\nracketeering charges based on his efforts, as Secretary of State,\nto steer state contracts to friendly firms in exchange for financial\nsupport for his gubernatorial campaign.

Rowland accepted the gifts, it was\n         alleged, in exchange for assisting the contractors in\n         securing lucrative state contracts. Rowland resigned\n         amidst the allegations, and in 2005 pleaded guilty --\n\f                                  29\n\n          along with two aides and several contractors -- to\n          federal charges in connection with the scandal.\n\nId. (quoting Green Party, 616 F.3d at 218-19). In light of that\nexperience, the court found “sufficient evidence” of “actual\ncorruption stemming from contractor contributions,” as well as\n“a manifest need to curtail the appearance of corruption created\nby contractor contributions.” Id. at 200.\n\n     Later, the Second Circuit also upheld New York City’s law\nlimiting contributions by entities “doing business with” the City.\nOgnibene v.

Thus, they maintain, “even if a pay-to-play rationale\nmight have made [the statute] defensible in 1940, the vast\nchanges in federal procurement since then have made it\nindefensible on that basis today.” Id. at 13. We are\nunpersuaded.\n\n    First, the facts that we have recounted above speak for\nthemselves. See supra Part III.C.1. If contracting were truly\nimmune from political interference, for example, Rep.\nCunningham could not have “pressure[d] and influence[d]\nUnited States Department of Defense personnel to award and\nexecute government contracts.” Plea Agreement at 6, United\n\n\nof the contractors’ campaign cash was donated to lawmakers within\na year of their contracts getting approved,” often “months and weeks\nahead of when the contracts were voted on” or even the same day as\nthe vote).\n\f                               32\n\nStates v.

Nor would the myriad of other instances of corruption\nand self-dealing in the contract bidding process have occurred.\nSee generally DEP’T OF DEFENSE, ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ETHICAL\nFAILURE 4-58, 77-78, 82, 84-88, 132-46. Moreover, those facts\nare hardly surprising. Although agencies do rely on specialized\ncontracting officers to help ensure independence, contracting\nofficers in turn rely on information about needs and objectives\nprovided by the “customer” agency, which may include input\nfrom political appointees. See D. Ct. Findings ¶ 23 (citing\nSchooner Dep. 110-16). And Members of Congress have many\nopportunities of their own to intercede on behalf of their\nconstituents.

Findings\n¶ 24 (quoting Schooner Dep. 107-08). Wagner’s contract, for\nexample, was arranged under the simplified acquisition\nprocedures. Id. She was proactively approached by a staff\nmember at ACUS, and then discussed the arrangement with\nACUS’s Chairman, who is appointed by the President and\nconfirmed by the Senate. Wagner Decl. ¶ 3. In short, because\n\f                                  33\n\nthe plaintiffs challenge § 30119 as it applies to individual\ncontractors, the competitive bidding regime does little to help\ntheir case.\n\n     Finally, perhaps the most relevant change in government\ncontracting over the past several decades has been the enormous\nincrease in the government’s reliance on contractors to do work\npreviously performed by employees. See Schooner Dep. 35-36,\ncited in D. Ct. Findings ¶ 22.22 If anything, that shift has only\nstrengthened the original rationales for the contractor\ncontribution ban by increasing the number of potential targets of\ncorruption and coercion -- targets who do not have the merit\nsystem protections available to government employees.

However, as FEC counsel advised the\ncourt, there is no criminal violation unless the individual knows his or\nher conduct violates the law. Oral Arg.

The plaintiffs also question whether there is sufficient\nevidence of corruption or coercion specifically with respect to\nindividual contractors, as compared to those organized as\ncorporations or other kinds of firms. It is true that most of the\nexamples set forth in Parts III.B and III.C above involve firms.24\nWe see no reason, however, to believe that the motivations for\ncorruption and coercion exhibited in those examples are\ninapplicable in the case of individual contractors. Consider Sam\nHarris, a consultant who told the Watergate Committee that “he\nwas made to feel that his continued success in obtaining\nGovernment contracts would, in significant degree, be\ndependent on his contributing to the President’s reelection.”\nWATERGATE REPORT at 409. There is no basis for thinking that\nHarris would have been less vulnerable to such coercion if,\ninstead of doing business as Sam Harris & Associates, id., he\nhad contracted with the government in his personal capacity.\nWe are also mindful that less direct evidence is required when,\nas here, the government acts to prevent offenses that “are\nsuccessful precisely because they are difficult to detect.”\nBurson, 504 U.S. at 208 (upholding restriction of campaign\n\n\nsee 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1)(A) (imposing criminal penalties on those\nwho “knowingly and willfully” violate FECA); Bryan v.

A coercive patronage system\ncan thrive on even small contributions from a large group of\nworkers beholden to those in power -- which is what the\ngrowing ranks of individual contractors staffing federal agencies\noffer. As the Court explained in Elrod v. Burns, “[a]s\ngovernment employment . . . becomes more pervasive, the\ngreater the dependence on it becomes, and therefore the greater\nbecomes the power to starve political opposition by\ncommanding partisan support, financial and otherwise.” 427\nU.S. at 356; see Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at 565-66 (explaining\nthat “perhaps the immediate occasion for enactment of the Hatch\nAct in 1939 . . . was the conviction that the rapidly expanding\n\f                                36\n\nGovernment work force should not be employed to build a\npowerful, invincible, and perhaps corrupt political machine”).\n\n                                E\n\n     Our historical review makes clear that the two Court-\napproved justifications for limitations on campaign activities --\nto protect against quid pro quo corruption and its appearance,\nand to protect merit-based public administration -- were the\njustifications that lay behind the contractor contribution statute.\nLikewise, our national experience supports Congress’ fear that\npolitical contributions by government contractors can corrupt\nand interfere with merit-based administration.\n\n     The Supreme Court has instructed that the “quantum of\nempirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny\nof legislative judgments will vary up or down with the novelty\nand plausibility of the justification raised.” Nixon v.

There is nothing novel\nor implausible about the notion that contractors may make\npolitical contributions as a quid pro quo for government\ncontracts, that officials may steer government contracts in return\nfor such contributions, and that the making of contributions and\nthe awarding of contracts to contributors fosters the appearance\nof such quid pro quo corruption. Nor is there anything novel or\nimplausible about the idea that contractors may be coerced to\nmake contributions to play in that game, or that more qualified\ncontractors may decline to play at all if the game is rigged. To\nthe contrary, the empirical record is more than sufficient to\nsatisfy the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate for review of\nthe legislative judgments that support § 30119.\n\n     In sum, the interests supporting the contractor contribution\nstatute are legally sufficient, and the dangers it seeks to combat\nare real and supported by the historical and factual record.\n\f                                37\n\nAccordingly, we now turn to the remainder of the “closely\ndrawn” test.\n\n                                IV\n\n     Even if a contribution ban serves sufficiently important\ninterests, to satisfy the First Amendment it still must employ\n“‘means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment of\nassociational freedoms.’” McCutcheon, 134 S.

The plaintiffs contend that § 30119 fails this test\nbecause it is overinclusive in several respects, which we\nconsider in turn.\n\n                                 A\n\n     The plaintiffs first maintain that the statute is overinclusive\nbecause Congress banned their contributions entirely, rather than\nsimply resting on the contribution limits generally applicable to\nall citizens, see 52 U.S.C. § 30116(a), or on some more modest\nlimits. Such a contribution ban, applicable to a particular\ncategory of persons, is not unique. Federal law has long\nprohibited all federal campaign contributions by corporations\nand labor unions. See 52 U.S.C. § 30118(a); Beaumont, 539\nU.S. at 161-63. Several states have their own bans on certain\ncontributions by classes of individuals or firms that do business\n\f                                38\n\nwith the government.25 And every judge on this court -- indeed,\non every lower federal court -- is likewise banned from making\npolitical contributions. See CODE OF CONDUCT FOR UNITED\nSTATES JUDGES, Canon 5(A)(3). So, too, are judicial employees.\nSee CODE OF CONDUCT FOR JUDICIAL EMPLOYEES § 310.10(a);\nid. § 320, Canon 5(A). See also Bluman v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012).\n\n     We do not dispute that the total ban on federal contributions\nby contractors is a significant restriction. But the point of the\n“closely drawn” test is that “‘[e]ven a significant interference\nwith protected rights of political association may be sustained if\nthe State demonstrates a sufficiently important interest and\nemploys means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary abridgment\nof associational freedoms.’” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25). And we conclude that the\nban at issue here is permissible in the circumstances that we\naddress in this opinion: a regulation that bars only campaign\ncontributions and that is imposed only on government\ncontractors. As we have discussed, the Court has held that\ncampaign contributions constitute a form of expressive activity\nless central to the First Amendment than other kinds of political\nactivity and expenditures. See, e.g., id. at 1444; Beaumont, 539\nU.S. at 161; Buckley, 424 U.S. at 25. And as we have also\ndiscussed, we owe “‘greater deference to government\npredictions of harm used to justify restriction of employee\nspeech than to predictions of harm used to justify restrictions on\nthe speech of the public at large.’” Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 676\n\n\n    25\n      See, e.g., CONN.

Under these\ncircumstances, we conclude that Congress’ decision to impose\na contribution ban during the period of contract negotiation and\nperformance is closely drawn for two reasons.\n\n     First, the contracting context greatly sharpens the risk of\ncorruption and its appearance. Unlike the corruption risk when\na contribution is made by a member of the general public, in the\ncase of contracting there is a very specific quo for which the\ncontribution may serve as the quid: the grant or retention of the\ncontract. Indeed, if there is an area that can be described as the\n“heartland” of such concerns, the contracting process is it. Cf.\nGreen Party, 616 F.3d at 202 (explaining that Connecticut’s ban\non contractor contributions “is, without question, ‘closely\ndrawn’ to meet the state’s interest in combating corruption and\nthe appearance of corruption” because such contributions “lie at\nthe heart of the corruption problem in Connecticut”); see also\nYamada, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2015</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2384944</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20. The long historical\nexperience described in Parts III.B and III.C makes clear that\nthis is not just a question of risk, but of reality.\n\n     Moreover, because of that sharpened focus, the appearance\nproblem is also greater: a contribution made while negotiating\nor performing a contract looks like a quid pro quo, whether or\nnot it truly is. As the sponsor of the 1940 contractor\ncontribution ban explained to his Senate colleagues, the ban was\nneeded because contractor contributions “may be considered in\nsome instances as bribery in order to secure governmental\ncontracts,” 86 CONG. REC. 2982 (1940) (statement of Sen.\nByrd). See Green Party, 616 F.3d at 205 (upholding\nConnecticut’s ban because, inter alia, “[e]ven if small contractor\ncontributions would have been unlikely to influence state\nofficials, those contributions could have still given rise to the\nappearance that contractors are able to exert improper influence\n\f                                40\n\non state officials”); cf. Preston, 660 F.3d at 736 (upholding\nNorth Carolina’s ban on lobbyists’ contributions because it\nrested on “a legitimate legislative judgment” that “a complete\nban was necessary as a prophylactic to prevent not only actual\ncorruption but also the appearance of corruption in future state\npolitical campaigns”).\n\n     Second, the contracting context also greatly sharpens the\nrisk of interference with merit-based public administration.\nBecause a contractor’s need for government contracts is\ngenerally more focused than a member of the general public’s\nneed for other official acts, his or her susceptibility to coercion\nis concomitantly greater. And coercing a contractor to\ncontribute, even if limited by a contribution ceiling, is still\ncoercion.\n\n     In sum, we conclude that a flat prohibition is closely drawn\nto the important goals that § 30119 serves.

Bar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2797290\"><a href=\"/opinion/2797290/williams-yulee-v-florida-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Br. 51. But the Democratic\ncampaign book scandal of the 1930s gave Congress sufficient\nreason to target contributions to parties: it was the Democratic\n\f                               41\n\nNational Committee whose agents reportedly told government\ncontractors that the continuation of their contracts hinged on\ntheir financial support of the party. See 84 CONG. REC. 9598-99\n(1939). Indeed, the 1876 law concerning federal employees was\nalso “aimed at the suppression of the practice which has\nprevailed among party organizations of soliciting contributions\nfor party purposes from their office-holding members, or\nexacting them by a moral coercion.” United States v.

Likewise\nthe Watergate Committee’s report on the 1972 election included\nevidence that federal employees were pressured to contribute to\nthe Republican Party. WATERGATE REPORT at 413. Nor did the\nrole of contributions to political parties in influencing\ngovernment employment wane as the 20th century progressed.\nSee, e.g., Elrod, 427 U.S. at 351-52 (1976); Branti v.

We address only the more\nsubstantial of these.\n\n     First, the plaintiffs propose that the ban should at least\nexclude sole-source contracts for experts like plaintiff Wagner,\nparticularly when it is the government that initiates the contact,\n“because the requirements to enter them are sufficiently\nrigorous” to address the risk of corruption. Pls. Br. 53 n.9. But\nthe plaintiffs do not explain what those requirements are, or why\nthey provide the requisite assurances. Cf. KATE M. MANUEL,\nCONG . R ESEARCH SERV ., COMPETITION IN FEDERAL\nCONTRACTING: AN OVERVIEW OF THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS 1\n(2011) (noting “high-profile incidents of alleged misconduct by\ncontractors or agency officials involving noncompetitive\ncontracts”). Moreover, this argument appears contrary to the\nplaintiffs’ principal contention, that it is the rise of competitive\nbidding -- not the private placement of sole-source contracts --\nthat has eliminated the risk of pay-to-play. See supra Part\nIII.D.1. In any event, because Wagner’s claims are moot, this\nargument need not detain us.\n\n\n\n\n    26\n      See McConnell, 540 U.S. at 155 (explaining that the “close\nconnection and alignment of interests” between parties and federal\nofficeholders are likely to create the risk of “actual or apparent”\ncorruption); Emily’s List v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187454\"><a href=\"/opinion/187454/emilys-list-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">581</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2009).\n\f                                   43\n\n    Second, the plaintiffs argue that § 30119 unnecessarily bars\ncontractors from contributing to ideological PACs that, in turn,\ncontribute to candidates. Whether or not this argument has\nmerit,27 it suffers from a similar problem: the one plaintiff\nwhose claim is not moot lacks standing to challenge limitations\non contributions to PACs. See supra Part I.\n\n     Third, the plaintiffs suggest that the statute would be more\nclosely drawn if it applied only to large contracts, pointing out\nthat Colorado and New York City enacted pay-to-play laws\nlimited to contracts worth more than $100,000. See Pls. Br.\n52-53. Although such a dollar limit would of course reduce the\nnumber of covered contractors, the plaintiffs do not explain why\n§ 30119 is not closely drawn to the interests it serves in the\nabsence of such a limit, or why a dollar limit would draw it more\nclosely to those interests. Perhaps quid pro quos and coercion\nare more likely when larger contracts are involved because,\nsince more money is at stake, the parties are more willing to risk\ndetection and prosecution. Or perhaps such abuses are just as\nlikely when smaller contracts are involved because the relative\nvalue to the small contractor is high and the risk of detection is\ncomparatively low. Because the plaintiffs have advanced no\nargument on this point, there is no need for us to speculate\nfurther. We do note, however, that the historical record provides\nsupport for legislative concern that corrupt and coercive\npatronage regimes can take root even when relatively small\namounts of money are at stake. See supra Parts III.B.1-2,\nIII.D.2., IV.A. And we also note again that a contribution ban\nneed not be a perfect fit to be constitutional, see McCutcheon,\n\n\n     27\n       The Supreme Court has upheld restrictions on contributions to\nmulticandidate committees as a necessary means to avoid\ncircumvention of other limits. Cal. Med. Ass’n, 453 U.S. at 197-99\n(plurality opinion); see id. at 203 (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and\nconcurring in the judgment); Emily’s List, 581 F.3d at 11-12.\n\f                                   44\n\n134 S. Ct. at 1456-57, and that courts give substantial deference\nto the government’s predictions of harm concerning its own\nemployees and contractors, see Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 676.\n\n     Finally, the plaintiffs maintain that Congress should have\nrested on the criminal statutes that directly ban quid pro quos\nand coercion,28 rather than also banning political contributions.\nBut the Supreme Court has repeatedly dispatched this argument.\nAs McConnell explained, “[i]n Buckley, we expressly rejected\nthe argument that antibribery laws provided a less restrictive\nalternative to FECA’s contribution limits, noting that such laws\n‘deal[t] with only the most blatant and specific attempts of those\nwith money to influence governmental action.’” 540 U.S. at 143\n(quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 28); see Citizens United, 558 U.S.\nat 356-57 (noting that, although quid pro quo arrangements\n“would be covered by bribery laws” if proven, the Court has\nviewed “restrictions on direct contributions a[s] preventative”\nand has sustained them “in order to ensure against the reality or\nappearance of corruption”). And what is true of the antibribery\nlaws is equally true of the anticoercion provisions. See Letter\nCarriers, 413 U.S. at 566 (“It may be urged that prohibitions\nagainst coercion are sufficient protection; but for many years the\njoint judgment of the Executive and Congress has been that to\nprotect the rights of federal employees with respect to their jobs\nand their political acts and beliefs it is not enough merely to\nforbid one employee to attempt to influence or coerce\nanother.”).\n\n\n\n\n     28\n       See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 201 (proscribing bribes and gratuities); id.\n§ 601 (proscribing causing or attempting to cause persons to make\npolitical contributions by denying or threatening to deny them work\nin or for the federal government).\n\f                                   45\n\n                                    D\n\n     Because the operative question in the plaintiffs’\noverinclusiveness challenge is whether § 30119 avoids\n“unnecessary abridgment” of First Amendment rights, it is also\nimportant to consider how much the statute leaves untouched.\nCampaign contributions are banned, but other forms of political\nengagement are left entirely unrestricted. The plaintiffs are free\nto volunteer for candidates, parties, or political committees; to\nspeak in their favor; and to host fundraisers and solicit\ncontributions from others. See 52 U.S.C. § 30101(8)(B)\n(enumerating activities to which the term “contribution” does\nnot extend). And even the contribution ban itself is limited to\nthe period between commencement of negotiations and\ncompletion of contract performance. Id. § 30119(a)(1).\n\n     The plaintiffs insist that the fact that the statute preserves\nother avenues of political communication is irrelevant to First\nAmendment analysis. Pls. Br. 61. But that argument is\nincorrect. As the Court recognized in McCutcheon v. FEC, “in\nthe context of [upholding the] base contribution limits, Buckley\nobserved that a supporter could vindicate his associational\ninterests by personally volunteering his time and energy on\nbehalf of a candidate.” McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1449 (citing\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 22, 28).29 The availability of other avenues\n\n\n     29\n       See Buckley, 424 U.S. at 22 (noting that FECA’s contribution\nceilings “limit one important means of associating with a candidate or\ncommittee, but leave the contributor free to become a member of any\npolitical association and to assist personally in the association’s efforts\non behalf of candidates”); see also Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1670\n(upholding Florida’s ban on solicitation of campaign funds by judicial\ncandidates, emphasizing that the ban restricts only “a narrow slice of\nspeech” because it “leaves judicial candidates free to discuss any issue\nwith any person at any time”).\n\f                               46\n\nof political communication can thus be relevant, although it is of\ncourse not dispositive.\n\n     In Blount v. SEC, for example, this court upheld a rule\nrestricting political contributions by municipal finance\nprofessionals to state and local officials from whom they hoped\nto secure underwriting contracts. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701259\"><a href=\"/opinion/701259/william-b-blount-v-securities-and-exchange-commission-municipal/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">938</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. We found the\nrule to be “closely drawn,” in part because it “restrict[ed] a\nnarrow range of their activities for a relatively short period of\ntime,” and those subject to the rule were “not in any way\nrestricted from engaging in the vast majority of political\nactivities.” Id. at 947-48. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit upheld\na lobbyist contribution ban in part because it “serve[d] only as\na channeling device, cutting off the avenue of association and\nexpression that is most likely to lead to corruption but allowing\nnumerous other avenues of association and expression.”\nPreston, 660 F.3d at 734. So, too, here.\n\n                                E\n\n     We conclude that the ban on contractor contributions is\nclosely drawn to the government’s interests in preventing\ncorruption and its appearance, and in protecting against\ninterference with merit-based administration. It strikes at the\ndangers Congress most feared while preserving contractors’\nfreedom to engage in many other forms of political expression.\nWe do not discount the possibility that Congress could have\nnarrowed its aim even further, targeting only certain specific\nkinds of government contracting or doing so only during\nspecific periods. But as the Court has made clear, “most\nproblems arise in greater and lesser gradations, and the First\nAmendment does not confine a State to addressing evils in their\nmost acute form.” Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1671.\n\f                                   47\n\n                                   V\n\n     What we have said thus far establishes that § 30119’s ban\non contractor contributions serves sufficiently important\ninterests and employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary\nabridgment of protected expression. The plaintiffs make one\nfurther First Amendment argument: not only is § 30119\noverinclusive because it restricts too much speech, but it is also\nunderinclusive because it permits too much speech. That is, it\nfails to ban contributions by three categories of individuals or\nentities that might implicate the same interests.\n\n     The first category proffered for comparison by the plaintiffs\nconsists of entities and individuals associated with firms that\nhave government contracts: PACs established by contracting\ncorporations; officers, employees, and shareholders of\ncontracting corporations; and individuals who control limited\nliability companies (LLCs) that contract with the federal\ngovernment. The second category is composed of federal\nemployees. The final category comprises individuals who seek\nother government benefits or positions, particularly grants and\nloans, admission to the military academies, and\nambassadorships.30\n\n    We begin with some general principles relevant to\nevaluating a claim that a statute violates the First Amendment\nbecause it is “underinclusive.” To put it most bluntly: “The First\n\n\n     30\n        The plaintiffs’ opening brief proffers only the third category as\nan example of First Amendment underinclusiveness, discussing the\nfirst two as part of their equal protection challenge. Pls. Br. 23, 55-59.\nIn their reply brief, the plaintiffs identify all three categories as\nsupporting their First Amendment argument. Reply Br. 26-28.\nBecause the issues are intertwined, see infra Part VI, we consider all\nthree categories here.\n\f                                48\n\nAmendment does not require the government to curtail as much\nspeech as may conceivably serve its goals.” Blount, 61 F.3d at\n946. Or, as the Supreme Court recently said in Williams-Yulee\nv. Florida Bar, in which it upheld, under strict scrutiny,\nFlorida’s ban on solicitation of campaign funds by judicial\ncandidates:\n\n         [T]he First Amendment imposes no freestanding\n         “underinclusiveness limitation.” A State need not\n         address all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop;\n         policymakers may focus on their most pressing\n         concerns. We have accordingly upheld laws -- even\n         under strict scrutiny -- that conceivably could have\n         restricted even greater amounts of speech in service of\n         their stated interests.\n\n135 S. Ct. at 1668 (quoting R.A.V. v. St. Paul, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112774\"><a href=\"/opinion/112774/rav-v-st-paul/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">377</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 387\n(1992)). Of course, in the instant case we do not apply strict\nscrutiny, but rather the more forgiving “closely drawn” standard.\nAnd a statute that does not go as far as it might to cut off\ncampaign contributions can hardly be said to constitute an\n“unnecessary abridgment” of the freedom to make such\ncontributions, McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444.\n\n     This is not to say that underinclusiveness plays no role in\nFirst Amendment analysis. As the Court explained in Williams-\nYulee, a law’s underinclusiveness raises “a red flag” that may\nindicate a different kind of problem. 135 S. Ct. at 1668. For\nexample, it may raise “‘doubts about whether the government is\nin fact pursuing the interest it invokes, rather than disfavoring a\nparticular speaker or viewpoint.’” Id. (quoting Brown v.

To the\ncontrary, they agree that the interests that motivated and have\nsustained § 30119 are the anticorruption goals the government\ninvokes today. See id. 22:05-45.

See Beaumont,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130151\"><a href=\"/opinion/130151/federal-election-commn-v-beaumont/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (upholding the ban on corporate contributions).\n\f                                52\n\nmake campaign contributions with non-treasury funds solicited\nfrom shareholders, certain personnel, and their families. See 52\nU.S.C. § 30119(b); id. § 30118(b). Officers, employees, and\nshareholders of corporate contractors are also free to make direct\ncontributions “from their personal assets.” 11 C.F.R. § 115.6.\nAnd it may be that individuals who control LLCs that contract\nwith the federal government can make contributions as well.\nBut none of these allowances fatally undermines the statutory\nregime.\n\n      1. A corporation is a separate legal entity from a PAC. See\nCitizens United, 558 U.S. at 337; Mass. Citizens for Life, 479\nU.S. at 252-56. As a consequence, the Supreme Court has said\nthat the political expression of a PAC is not equivalent to that of\nits associated corporation. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 337\n(“A PAC is a separate association from the corporation. So the\nPAC exemption from [FECA’s] expenditure ban does not allow\ncorporations to speak.” (citation omitted)). Congress’ decision\nto permit contributions by PACs associated with contracting\ncorporations is therefore not inconsistent with its decision to\nprohibit contributions by contractors themselves.\n\n     In Williams-Yulee, the Court considered a similar\nunderinclusiveness challenge to Florida’s ban on personal\nsolicitation of campaign funds by judicial candidates. That ban\n“allow[ed] a judge’s campaign committee to solicit money,”\nwhich the petitioner argued “reduces public confidence in the\nintegrity of the judiciary just as much as a judge’s personal\nsolicitation.” 135 S. Ct. at 1668. The Court was not moved.\n“However similar the two solicitations may be in substance,” the\nCourt said, “a State may conclude that they present markedly\ndifferent appearances to the public. Florida’s choice to allow\nsolicitation by campaign committees does not undermine its\ndecision to ban solicitation by judges.” Id. at 1669. The same\ncan be said of Congress’ choice to permit contributions by\n\f                                53\n\npolitical committees associated with corporate contractors, while\nbanning contributions by contractors themselves.\n\n    2. Respecting the corporate form, and therefore according\nseparate treatment to shareholders and other individuals\nassociated with corporations, is also constitutional. In Blount,\nwe considered and rejected a similar underinclusiveness\nchallenge to the SEC’s pay-to-play rule, which, while restricting\ncontributions by municipal securities professionals, did not\nextend the restriction to the chief executives of banks with\nmunicipal securities departments. “[A] regulation is not fatally\nunderinclusive,” we said, “simply because an alternative\nregulation, which would restrict more speech or the speech of\nmore people, could be more effective.” Blount, 61 F.3d at 946.\n\n     In upholding the SEC’s rule, Blount also noted the SEC’s\nexplanation that this “loophole,” like others in the rule, reflected\nthe Commission’s sensitivity to First Amendment concerns\nabout overinclusiveness. Id. at 947. Here, too, Congress could\nreasonably have concluded that banning contributions by all\nthose associated with corporate contractors would go too far at\ntoo great a First Amendment cost.\n\n     3. The plaintiffs further argue that, while they contract\ndirectly with the federal government for their services and so are\nbarred from making contributions, they or other individuals\ncould instead establish an LLC to formally contract with the\ngovernment and receive payment for their work. Then, because\nthe FEC has ruled that the contractor contribution ban does not\napply to an entity’s “employees, officers, or members,” 11\nC.F.R. § 115.6, the plaintiffs maintain that such individuals\nwould remain free to make contributions. The availability of\nthis LLC loophole, they say, vitiates the statutory purpose.\n\f                                  54\n\n     Although the FEC’s briefs accepted the plaintiffs’\ndescription of the regulatory treatment of individuals who\nestablish LLCs, the agency submitted a post-argument letter\nclarifying that the Commission itself “has not addressed the\napplication of FECA’s contractor contribution prohibition to\ncontributions made by an individual who is the sole member of\nan LLC that is a federal contractor.” FEC Post-Argument Letter\nat 6 (Nov. 24, 2014) (emphasis omitted).35 Perhaps for that\nreason, there is no evidence in the record that anyone has ever\nused an LLC as a loophole to permit him or her to make an\nindividual campaign contribution.36\n\n     The plaintiffs’ own evidence highlights the not insignificant\ncosts involved in both establishing and operating as an LLC.\nSee Tiemann Decl. ¶ 3, cited in D. Ct. Findings ¶ 19. Moreover,\nat oral argument, plaintiffs’ counsel acknowledged that “persons\nlike Mr. Miller and Mr. Brown almost certainly could not have\n[contracted] through [an] LLC” -- both because the agency may\nnot have allowed it, and because of the “substantial sacrifice”\nthey would have incurred by forgoing various benefits that come\nwith employment-like contracts. Oral Arg. Recording 23:13-58.\nIn short, in the absence of any evidence of circumvention-by-\nLLC, the failure to plug this speculative loophole is hardly a\n\n     35\n     The statute, of course, does not mention LLCs, which first\nemerged in the late 1970s. See Treatment of Limited Liability\nCompanies Under the Federal Election Campaign Act, 64 Fed. Reg.\n37397, 37398 (July 12, 1999).\n     36\n       One witness opined that, at least with respect to consulting-type\ncontracts, client agencies are indifferent between contracting with an\nLLC and contracting with an individual. See Schooner Decl. ¶ 8, cited\nin D. Ct. Findings ¶ 20. The witness did not say how many such\narrangements there are, or that any individuals using LLCs had\nactually made campaign contributions. Id.; see also Lubbers Decl. ¶ 8,\ncited in D. Ct. Findings ¶ 20.\n\f                                   55\n\nbasis for invalidating the statute. Cf. Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct.\nat 1670 (“Even under strict scrutiny, ‘[t]he First Amendment\ndoes not require States to regulate for problems that do not\nexist.’” (quoting Burson, 504 U.S. at 207)).\n\n                                    B\n\n     The second category proffered by the plaintiffs as evidence\nof § 30119’s underinclusiveness is composed of federal\nemployees who, unlike federal contractors, are generally not\nbarred from making campaign contributions. See 5 C.F.R.\n§ 734.208(a). As with the other categories, there is no ground\nfor concluding that Congress chose to invidiously discriminate\nagainst contractors in favor of employees. And while federal\nemployees are permitted to make contributions, they are subject\nto other restrictions (pursuant to the Hatch Act) and enjoy other\nprotections (pursuant to the Civil Service Reform Act) that do\nnot apply to contractors.37\n\n\n\n\n     37\n       The Hatch Act bars most federal employees from, inter alia,\nsoliciting or accepting political contributions, running for office in a\npartisan election, hosting a political fundraiser, or engaging in political\nactivity while on duty or in a federal building. See 5 U.S.C.\n§§ 7323(a), 7324(a); 5 C.F.R. §§ 734.302-.306. Employees of more\nthan a dozen specific agencies, as well as others who hold certain\nsenior or adjudicative positions, are more broadly prohibited from\n“tak[ing] an active part in . . . political campaigns.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 7323(b)(2)(A). Under the Civil Service Reform Act, covered\nemployees are protected against “prohibited personnel practices,”\nincluding discrimination on the basis of political affiliation and\ncoercion to make political contributions. 5 U.S.C. § 2302(a)(1),\n(b)(1)(E), (b)(3). Aggrieved employees who have been subjected to\nsuch practices can seek redress through the Office of Special Counsel\nand the Merit Systems Protection Board. 5 U.S.C. §§ 1214-15, 1221.\n\f                                   56\n\n     Congress could reasonably have thought that the difference\nin status of the two kinds of workers warrants this difference in\ntreatment. Because regular employees do not generally need\nnew contracts or renewals with the frequency required by\noutside contractors, permitting them to make contributions\ncarries less risk of corruption or its appearance: employees have\nless to gain from making contributions and less to lose from not\nmaking them.38 It is true, as the plaintiffs note, that employees\nhave other concerns that could make them susceptible to\ncoercion, including the desire for promotion or the fear of\ntermination. But Congress has provided them with merit system\nprotections that guard against that risk. See supra note 37. We\nsee no basis for overturning Congress’ decision about how to\ncalibrate these different restrictions.39\n\n                                   C\n\n     Finally, the plaintiffs’ comparison of contractors to a\nmiscellany of other individuals who seek government benefits\nor positions -- particularly grants and loans, admission to the\nmilitary academies, and ambassadorships -- is equally\n\n\n     38\n         Cf. 86 CONG. REC. 2580 (1940) (statement of Sen. Brown)\n(“[T]he Government clerk, if he is not under civil service, is interested\nin keeping in power the party that is in power and that gave him a job.\n. . . I can apply the same principle . . . . to contractors who are doing\nbusiness with the Government of the United States.” (emphasis\nadded)).\n     39\n       Cf. Broadrick v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108858\"><a href=\"/opinion/108858/broadrick-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 n.5 (1973)\n(rejecting equal protection challenge to Oklahoma statute “singling out\nclassified service employees for restrictions on partisan political\nexpression while leaving unclassified personnel free from such\nrestrictions” because “the legislature must have some leeway in\ndetermining which of its employment positions require restrictions on\npartisan political activities and which may be left unregulated”).\n\f                                57\n\nunavailing. Once again, there is no basis for a claim that\nCongress invidiously discriminated against contractors and in\nfavor of others. Nor is there any reason to believe that\npermitting contributions by these other individuals defeats\n§ 30119’s purpose of protecting against corruption and\ninterference with merit-based administration. Congress is surely\nnot prohibited from fighting such problems in one sector unless\nit fights them in all. As the Supreme Court has said, “‘a\nlegislature need not strike at all evils at the same time.’”\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 105 (quoting Katzenbach v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107256\"><a href=\"/opinion/107256/katzenbach-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 657 (1966)). Rather, “reform may take one step at a\ntime, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems\nmost acute to the legislative mind.” Id. (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted); see Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at\n1668.\n\n                                D\n\n     We conclude that the contractor contribution ban is not\nfatally underinclusive. There is no doubt that “the proffered\nstate interest actually underlies the law,” and that it can “fairly\nbe said” that the statute “advance[s] a[] genuinely substantial\ngovernmental interest.” Blount, 61 F.3d at 946 (citations and\ninternal quotation marks omitted). The plaintiffs may well be\nright that the ban would be even more effective if it swept in\nmore potential contributors. But § 30119 “aims squarely at the\nconduct most likely to undermine” the important interests that\nunderlie it, and “[w]e will not punish [Congress] for leaving\nopen more, rather than fewer, avenues of expression, especially\nwhen there is no indication that the selective restriction of\nspeech reflects a pretextual motive.” Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct.\nat 1668-70.\n\n    Accordingly, and in light of the analysis of the preceding\nParts, we reject the plaintiffs’ First Amendment challenge.\n\f                                 58\n\n                                 VI\n\n     In addition to their First Amendment claim, the plaintiffs\nchallenge § 30119 under the equal protection component of the\nFifth Amendment. Equal protection is violated, they maintain,\nbecause the statute subjects individual contractors like\nthemselves to a ban that it does not apply to two categories of\nsimilarly situated persons: (1) entities and individuals associated\nwith firms that have government contracts (i.e., PACs of\ncontracting corporations; officers, employees, and shareholders\nof contracting corporations; and individuals who control\ncontracting LLCs); and (2) individuals who are regular\nemployees rather than contractors.\n\n     If this argument sounds familiar, it should. It is the same\nargument that we have just considered, and rejected, when\nclothed in the garb of a First Amendment claim that § 30119 is\ntoo underinclusive to satisfy the “closely drawn” standard.40\nNow dressing their argument as an equal protection claim, the\nplaintiffs insist that we must evaluate it under strict scrutiny.\nThat is so, they say, because “the right to make a political\ncontribution is a fundamental right protected by the First\nAmendment,” and because “strict scrutiny is required when a\nlaw . . . ‘impinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or\nimplicitly protected by the Constitution.’” Pls. Br. 25 (quoting\nSan Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17\n(1973)).\n\n     We reject this doctrinal gambit, which would require strict\nscrutiny notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s determination that\nthe “closely drawn” standard is the appropriate one under the\n\n\n     40\n       As noted above, the plaintiffs’ underinclusiveness argument\nincluded a third category as well: individuals seeking a miscellany of\nother government benefits or positions.

Although the Court has on occasion applied\nstrict scrutiny in examining equal protection challenges in cases\ninvolving First Amendment rights, it has done so only when a\nFirst Amendment analysis would itself have required such\nscrutiny.41 There is consequently no case in which the Supreme\nCourt has employed strict scrutiny to analyze a contribution\nrestriction under equal protection principles. Indeed, the\nplaintiffs acknowledge that they know of no case in any court\n“in which an equal-protection challenge to contribution limits\nsucceeded where a First Amendment one did not.” Wagner, 901\nF. Supp. 2d at 112. This will not be the first.\n\n     As we explained in Ruggiero v. FCC, “[a]lthough equal\nprotection analysis focuses upon the validity of the classification\nrather than the speech restriction, ‘the critical questions asked\nare the same.’ We believe that the same level of scrutiny . . . is\ntherefore appropriate in both contexts.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185831\"><a href=\"/opinion/185831/ruggiero-greg-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">317</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">239</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (D.C.\nCir. 2003) (en banc) (quoting Cmty.-Serv.

First, there is no\ndispute regarding the legitimacy or importance of the interests\nthat support the contractor contribution ban. In § 30119,\nCongress was plainly not attempting “to reduce the amount of\nmoney in politics, or to restrict the political participation of\nsome in order to enhance the relative influence of others.”\nMcCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1441 (citing, e.g., Ariz. Free Enter.\nClub’s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"219735\"><a href=\"/opinion/219735/arizona-free-enterprise-clubs-freedom-club-pac-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nor did it create a mechanism “to level the playing\nfield, or to level electoral opportunities, or to equaliz[e] the\nfinancial resources of candidates.” Id. at 1450 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Nor did it “‘disfavor[] a particular\nspeaker or viewpoint,’” Williams-Yulee, 135 S. Ct. at 1668\n(quoting Brown, 131 S. Ct. at 2740), or favor incumbents over\nchallengers, cf. Randall v.

To the contrary, the interests\nsupporting the statute are ones that the Supreme Court has long\napproved -- indeed, endorsed -- as legitimate and important\ngrounds for restricting campaign contributions and certain\nrelated associational freedoms.\n\n    Second, the contractor contribution ban rests on not one but\ntwo such interests. The ban is not only supported by the\n“compelling” interest in protecting against quid pro quo\ncorruption and its appearance, McCutcheon, 134 S. Ct. at 1444-\n45, commonly at issue in campaign finance cases. It is also\nsupported by the “obviously important interest[]” in protecting\n\n\nviolated the First Amendment as impermissibly underinclusive).\n\f                               62\n\nmerit-based public administration, Letter Carriers, 413 U.S. at\n564, commonly at issue in cases involving limits on partisan\nactivities by government employees.\n\n     The long historical experience recounted in Part III further\nmakes clear that these important concerns supporting § 30119\nare neither theoretical nor antiquated, but rather are grounded in\nunhappy experience stretching to the present day. And for the\nreasons set forth in Parts IV through VI, we also conclude that\nthe statute employs means closely drawn to avoid unnecessary\nabridgement of associational freedoms, and does not deprive the\nplaintiffs of equal protection of the laws. Accordingly, we\nuphold the statute against all of the plaintiffs’ constitutional\nchallenges.\n\n                                                     So ordered.\n\f</pre>",
