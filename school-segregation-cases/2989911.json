The district court, on the City’s motion, set aside that verdict and ordered a\n          new trial on the ground that the jury’s verdict in favor of TAG on its disparate impact claim\n          was inconsistent with the jury’s verdict against TAG on its perpetuation of segregation claim.\n          Following a second trial held in August 2012, a new jury returned a verdict in favor of the\n          City on both of TAG’s claims, and the district court entered judgment accordingly. TAG\n          now appeals the district court’s decision to order a new trial. On cross-appeal, the City\n          challenges two pretrial orders denying its motions to dismiss TAG from the case for lack of\n          standing and to preclude the testimony of TAG’s expert witnesses.\n\n\n          *   The Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to amend the caption accordingly.\n\n          **The Honorable Kiyo A.

Because\nany purported inconsistencies in the July 2010 jury verdict do not rise to the level of a\nfundamental error, we further hold that the district court committed a reversible error when\nit granted the City’s motion for a new trial on that ground. The City’s challenges to TAG’s\nstanding and the admission of its expert witness testimony are without merit. We therefore\nreinstate the July 2010 jury verdict to the extent it found the City liable on TAG’s disparate\nimpact claim. We further hold, however, that the July 2010 jury’s compensatory damages\naward was impermissibly speculative to the extent it awarded damages in the amount of\n$900,000 for a lost “developer’s fee” for which TAG had never applied. We therefore\nremand with instructions that the district court hold a new trial solely on the issue of\ndamages unless TAG agrees to accept remittitur of the July 2010 jury’s $1 million damages\naward to $100,000.\n\n       VACATED in part; REVERSED in part; REMANDED for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        REED N.

As envisioned, some 20% of the rental units in Spring Run Village were to be\n\ndesignated “workforce affordable,” meaning that they would be rented at affordable rates to\n\nlow-to-moderate income households. Before TAG could break ground on the project, the\n\nCity of Saratoga Springs rezoned the underlying property to preclude the construction of\n\nhigh-density developments. TAG and Gail Anderson filed suit, arguing that the City’s\n\n\n\t                                                  2\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                \t                                                \t\nzoning policies perpetuated racial segregation and had a disparate impact on African\n\nAmericans and families with children, thereby violating the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42\n\nU.S.C. § 3604. In July 2010, in the Northern District of New York, a jury returned a verdict\n\nin favor of TAG only as to its disparate impact claim. The district court (Sharpe, J.) granted\n\nthe City’s motion for a new trial, nearly one year later, on the ground that the jury’s verdict\n\nfor TAG on its disparate impact claim was irreconcilable with its verdict against TAG on its\n\nperpetuation of segregation claim. The district court further stated that if its decision to\n\norder a new trial did not withstand appeal, it would order a conditional remittitur of the\n\njury’s $1,000,000 damages award to $81,000 because the evidence of harm to TAG’s\n\nbusiness reputation and loss of a developer’s fee was impermissibly speculative. In 2012, a\n\nsecond jury returned a verdict in favor of the City on both of TAG’s claims. TAG and the\n\nCity both appealed the resulting judgment.\n\n        On appeal, TAG primarily attacks the district court’s decision to order a new trial,\n\narguing that the City waived any challenge to inconsistencies in the 2010 verdict by failing to\n\nraise its objection before the jury was discharged. It also challenges the propriety of the\n\ndistrict court’s alternative ruling as to remittitur. The City argues on cross-appeal that TAG\n\nlacks standing to bring its FHA claims and that the district court erred when it denied its\n\nmotion to preclude the testimony of TAG’s two expert witnesses. For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we: (1) VACATE the district court’s judgments entered on August 10, 2012, August\n\n30, 2012, and January 15, 2013; (2) REVERSE the district court’s June 21, 2011\n\nmemorandum decision and order to the extent it directed a new trial on TAG’s disparate\n\nimpact and perpetuation of segregation claims; (3) REINSTATE the July 2, 2010 jury verdict\n\n\n\t                                                3\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Saratoga Springs & its Affordable Housing Shortage\n\n                Saratoga Springs is a city of approximately 26,000 year-round residents located some\n\nforty miles north of Albany, New York. The City relies heavily on seasonal tourism, and\n\nmuch of its history has been “linked to the affluent and powerful” who continue to visit the\n\nCity to enjoy its renowned horse racing track, performing arts center, and curative baths.\n\nJ.A. 1542. Despite the seasonal influx of tourists, however, the City’s year-round residents\n\nhave long faced a well-documented shortage of affordable housing. In 2000, for example,\n\nover 40% of the City’s total households were of low-to-moderate income, meaning that they\n\nearned less than 80% of the area’s median income. Yet only half of those households\n\nresided in affordable housing units.1 The shortage was especially hard on large low-to-\n\nmoderate income families, 80% of whom could not find affordable housing. In 1999, 2000,\n\nand 2004, the City identified “affordability,” and particularly “the shortage of affordable\n\nrental units,” as one of its most urgent housing needs. J.A. 1544, 1548–49, 1615. Saratoga\n\nSprings also experienced a concentration of low-to-moderate income residents in certain\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n1 The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development defines an\n“affordable” housing unit as one that costs no more than 30% of the total annual household\nincome. See HUD.gov, Glossary of HUD Terms, http://www.huduser.org/portal/glossary/\nglossary_a.html (last visited September 17, 2015).\n\n\t                                                                        4\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                                    \t                               \t\nareas of the City, particularly in the downtown neighborhoods of Westside and Northside,\n\nwhere most of the City’s high-density subsidized rental housing opportunities were located.2\n\n                Despite its acknowledged affordable housing shortage, the City’s land use policies\n\noverwhelmingly favored the construction of “upscale single-family detached housing.” J.A.\n\n1330, 1342. Between 1990 and 2004, for instance, 94% of the permits issued for new\n\nresidential units were for single-family homes that the City acknowledged were prohibitively\n\nexpensive for use as affordable housing. J.A. 1542–43, 1614. Of the mere 152 new\n\nresidential units located in multi-family buildings approved by the City during this fourteen-\n\nyear period, 85% were also prohibitively expensive for use as affordable housing options. Id.\n\nIn official reports submitted to the City Council and to the United States Department of\n\nHousing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the City repeatedly acknowledged that its land\n\nuse zoning polices were among the factors that presented “hurdles” and “obstacles” to the\n\ndevelopment of affordable housing. J.A. 1354, 1549. To alleviate this problem, the City’s\n\nAffordable Housing Task Force recommended in 2003 that the City conduct a\n\n“comprehensive review of [its] existing zoning regulations” to allow for “more housing\n\ndevelopment and greater density where appropriate.” J.A. 1353–54.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n2 According to the City’s 2000 Consolidated Plan submitted to the United States Department\nof Housing and Urban Development, these neighborhoods were comprised of three Census\ntracts—610, 611, and 612. Three “block groups” within these Census tracts were largely\nmade up of low-to-moderate income residents. The same three block groups also contained\na concentration of the City’s minority residents. While these residents comprised only 5.5%\nof the City’s overall population, the populations of the three block groups were, respectively,\n31.2%, 51.6%, and 71.8% non-white.\n\n\t                                                                    5\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                \t                                              \t\nII.     TAG’s Proposed Development Project & the City’s Zoning Changes\n\n        TAG is a for-profit commercial real estate development company based in Albany,\n\nNew York; it is owned by Gail Anderson and her three children—Susan Anderson Touhey,\n\nWillard Anderson, and Gregory Anderson. In 2002, the company began pursuing plans to\n\ndevelop a 44-acre residential project called Spring Run Village on an undeveloped tract of\n\nland owned by Gail Anderson on the outskirts of the City. The proposed development,\n\nbilled as a “Village within the City,” was to contain 250 to 300 housing units spread between\n\ncondominiums, townhouse-style apartments, and small buildings with multiple apartments.\n\nOne of TAG’s stated goals in developing Spring Run Village was to help alleviate the City’s\n\naffordable housing shortage. To that end, at least 20% the rental housing units were to be\n\ndesignated “workforce affordable,” meaning they would be rented at affordable rates only to\n\nlow-to-moderate income households. Until it began planning Spring Run Village, TAG had\n\nnever before been involved with any residential or affordable housing development projects.\n\n        Gail Anderson’s property was located within a City zoning district known as the\n\nSouthern Weibel Avenue District (the “SWAD”). The SWAD originally was designated as a\n\n“high impact area,” which allowed for the development of high-density commercial and\n\nresidential projects like Spring Run Village. In 2001, however, the City Council adopted a\n\nnew comprehensive zoning plan that established a “unified set of policies for guiding the\n\nphysical development of the City of Saratoga Springs.” J.A. 1533. This new plan reflected a\n\n“City-in-the-Country” vision that called for a “city with an intensively developed urban core\n\n. . . with well-defined urban edges and an outlying area comprised of open lands, a landscape\n\nor rural character and low density residential development.” Id. The comprehensive plan\n\n\n\t                                                6\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                \t                                           \t\nproposed that the SWAD be redesignated as part of the City’s new Conservation\n\nDevelopment District, which would limit the permissible density of residential development\n\nin the area. Consistent with this plan, the City Council voted in May 2003 to rezone the\n\nSWAD as a low-density “rural-residential” area, which permitted no more than one structure\n\nper every two acres. A New York state court set aside that decision in May 2004 on the\n\nground that the rezoning did not comply with New York State’s Environmental Quality\n\nReview Act (“SEQRA”).\n\n        Following the New York state court’s decision, TAG moved forward with its plans\n\nfor Spring Run Village, retaining an architect and consulting with an affordable housing\n\nexpert. In the fall of 2004, Gail Anderson and TAG filed with the City Planning Board a\n\nnumber of applications for special use permits that would allow TAG to construct the\n\ndevelopment consistent with the SWAD’s original zoning. While the Planning Board\n\nconsidered these applications, the City received a favorable environmental report that\n\nbrought it into compliance with SEQRA and permitted the SWAD rezoning. On February\n\n1, 2005, the day before the Planning Board was scheduled to vote on TAG’s special use\n\npermit, the City Council again voted to reclassify the SWAD zoning as low-density “rural-\n\nresidential,” thus precluding development of Spring Run Village. The Planning Board\n\nthereafter determined that TAG’s special use permit application “had to be considered\n\nwithdrawn” because the proposal was “no longer consistent with the new zoning.” J.A.\n\n1531.\n\n\n\n\n\t                                                7\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                            \t\nIII.       Pretrial Proceedings & 2010 Trial\n\n           TAG and Gail Anderson filed this action in October 2005, claiming that the City’s\n\nFebruary 2005 rezoning and denial of the special use permit violated the Fair Housing Act.\n\nPointing to the City’s affordable housing shortage, which was especially hard on large\n\nfamilies, and to the clustering of minorities in the few downtown areas with high-density\n\nsubsidized housing, the plaintiffs alleged that African-Americans and families with children\n\nwere in disproportionate need of the affordable rental housing contemplated in the Spring\n\nRun Village proposal. Plaintiffs therefore asserted that precluding completion of the\n\nproposed development perpetuated racial segregation in Saratoga Springs and had a\n\ndisproportionate impact on African-Americans and families with children. They further\n\nalleged that the City’s actions resulted from widespread community opposition to the\n\naffordable housing component of Spring Run Village based on the type of residents it would\n\nattract.\n\n           The City responded that even if its zoning decisions disproportionately affected\n\nAfrican-Americans or families with children, the City did not violate the FHA because the\n\nFebruary 2005 rezoning was undertaken for the legitimate, bona fide governmental purpose\n\nof bringing the zoning code into compliance with the City’s 2001 Comprehensive Plan. In a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the City unsuccessfully sought to have TAG dismissed from\n\nthe case for lack of standing, arguing that the company could not demonstrate any injury\n\nbecause it had never contracted with Gail Anderson to purchase the land where Spring Run\n\nVillage was to be built.\n\n\n\n\n\t                                                 8\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Expert Reports & Testimony\n\n                In an April 2010 pretrial motion in limine, the City sought to preclude the reports and\n\ntestimony of the plaintiffs’ two expert witnesses, Dr. Allan Parnell and Dr. Stephen Raphael.\n\nThe district court denied the City’s motion in June 2010, and the case proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial that lasted nine days during which both experts testified.\n\n                B.              Evidence as to Damages\n\n                At trial, the plaintiffs introduced evidence concerning three categories of damages:\n\n(1) costs incurred by TAG in developing and seeking approval for Spring Run Village; (2) a\n\nlost “developer’s fee” of $900,000; and (3) harm to TAG’s business reputation. As to the\n\nfirst category, TAG officer Willard Anderson testified that the company spent a total of\n\n$81,000 on consultants, architects, studies, and application fees in connection with its Spring\n\nRun Village proposal. Trial Tr. 213–16, 264.3 He also testified that when the City made its\n\nJanuary 2005 zoning decision, TAG had been in the process of determining how to apply for\n\nlow income housing tax credits from the New York State Division of Housing and\n\nCommunity Renewal, and that TAG anticipated receiving a $900,000 “developer’s fee” as a\n\nresult of that process. Trial Tr. 184, 186–87, 442. Concerning the harm to TAG’s business\n\nreputation, Willard Anderson and his brother, Gregory, testified that during the fall of 2004,\n\nvarious City officials vilified TAG in the press, referred to the Andersons as “school yard\n\nbullies,” and publically alleged that the affordable housing component of Spring Run Village\n\nwas a “smoke screen.” Trial Tr. 137, 272–73, 301–02, 1277–79.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n3   Citations to “Trial Tr.” refer to the transcript of the 2010 trial.\n\n\t                                                                    9\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Jury Instructions & Verdict\n\n        At the end of the plaintiffs’ case in chief, and again following the close of the\n\nevidence, the City moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 50 on the ground that the plaintiffs’ evidence was insufficient to sustain their\n\nclaims. The court reserved decision on both occasions. At the end of the case, the district\n\ncourt instructed the jury on the elements of the plaintiffs’ claims and the City’s\n\ncorresponding defenses. Beginning with the plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim, the court\n\nexplained:\n\n                 To establish . . . a claim [of disparate impact discrimination], the\n        plaintiff is not required to show that the defendant intended to discriminate . .\n        . . Rather, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\n        the defendant’s conduct actually or predictably had a substantial and\n        discriminatory impact on African-Americans or families with children. . . .\n                 I turn now to a defense to the [disparate impact claim] that w[as] raised\n        by Saratoga Springs. . . . [W]hen it comes to this defense, this is something\n        Saratoga needs to prove. If you find that Saratoga Springs’ conduct had a\n        substantial discriminatory impact on African-Americans or families with\n        children, then you must decide whether Saratoga Springs has proved by a\n        preponderance of the evidence that its conduct furthered a legitimate, bona\n        fide governmental interest and that no alternative action would have served\n        that interest with a less discriminatory impact. This acts as a defense to\n        liability for disparate impact discrimination, and so Saratoga Springs has the\n        burden to prove that it is entitled to this defense.\n                 In summary, Ms. Anderson and The Anderson Group must each prove\n        by a preponderance of the evidence that Saratoga Springs’ conduct had a\n        substantial discriminatory impact on African-Americans or families with\n        children. If you the jury are satisfied that Ms. Anderson and The Anderson\n        Group has [sic] proved their claims of disparate impact discrimination, then\n        and only then may you consider whether Saratoga Springs’ conduct furthered\n        a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest, and that no alternative action\n        would have served that interest with a less discriminatory impact. . . .\n                 Let me turn to the . . . claim for perpetuation of segregation. Th[is] . . .\n        claim . . . operates like a claim based on disparate impact, except that it\n        addresses harm done to the community in general rather than harm done to a\n        particular protected group.\n\n\n\t                                                10\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                                 \t\n                In order to establish a claim for a perpetuation of segregation in\n        violation of the Fair Housing Act, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance\n        of the evidence that the City of Saratoga Springs actually or predictably\n        perpetuated, continued or maintained a segregation of African-Americans\n        from predominantly white areas. . . .\n                If you should find the affirmative defense that I just described for you\n        as to the [disparate impact] claim applies in exactly the same way on this claim,\n        so – rather than repeat it to you, I’m just going to summarize\t it for you – if\n        you find that the plaintiffs have satisfied their burden of proof on the\n        [perpetuation of segregation] claim, then you would consider whether Saratoga\n        Springs has proved the defense I’ve already defined for you. If you were\n        satisfied that it had, then Saratoga Springs would not be liable . . . .\n\nTrial Tr. 2049–53.\n\n        As to damages, the district court instructed the jury that it was permitted to award\n\ncompensatory damages for “any cost or expenses [TAG] . . . incurred as a result of the\n\n[City’s] discriminatory conduct,” including “financial losses, loss of business reputation and\n\ngood will and loss of opportunity,” as well as “reasonable compensation for emotional\n\ndistress and humiliation.” Trial Tr. 2054. The court cautioned, however, that the jurors\n\n“should not award compensatory damages for speculative injuries but only for those injuries\n\nthat the plaintiff has actually suffered” and that “[h]arm to a plaintiff which is not the\n\nproximate result of unlawful conduct does not entitle . . . it to damages.” Trial Tr. 2055.\n\n        After instructing the jury to begin its deliberations, the district court sent the jury a\n\nverdict form to which neither party lodged an objection. Trial Tr. 2063. The jury ultimately\n\nreturned a verdict on July 2, 2010 in which it concluded that TAG (but not Gail Anderson)\n\nhad proven both that the City “engaged in disparate impact discrimination against African\n\nAmericans or families with children” and “engaged in the perpetuation of segregation against\n\nAfrican Americans.” S.A. 6, 8. The jury found, however, that the City was liable only as to\n\nthe disparate impact claim because, as to the perpetuation of segregation claim, the City had\n\n\t                                                11\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Id.\n\nThe jury awarded $1 million in compensatory damages.4 S.A. 10.\n\n                After the court finished reading the jury’s verdict, it asked the City whether it would\n\nlike to have the jury polled. Trial Tr. 2083. The City responded affirmatively and, after the\n\njurors confirmed that the court’s reading of the verdict form was correct, the following\n\ncolloquy took place:\n\n                THE COURT:                                      Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your service.\n                                                                Thank you very much.

S.A. 13.\n\nIV.             The City’s Post-Trial Motion\n\n                On July 22, 2010, the City submitted a letter that it asked the court to construe as\n\nmotions brought pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 50 and 59.

City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                               \t\nreiterated its position that TAG lacked standing and argued that the trial evidence was\n\ninsufficient to sustain the jury verdict on the disparate impact claim. It further contended\n\nthat it was entitled to a new trial because it was not possible to harmonize the jury’s finding\n\nthat the City had met its burden on its governmental interest justification as to the\n\nperpetuation of segregation claim but not as to the disparate impact claim. Finally, it argued\n\nthat the trial evidence did not support the jury’s $1 million damages award and, therefore,\n\nremittitur was appropriate.\n\n        By order entered on June 21, 2011, the district court granted the City’s motion to the\n\nextent it requested a new trial. S.A. 14. Although the court rejected the City’s standing and\n\nsufficiency of the evidence arguments, it agreed that the jury’s verdict was inconsistent and\n\nincapable of harmonization. Id. at 29–30. To reach this conclusion, the court rejected\n\nTAG’s argument that the City waived any inconsistency challenge by failing to raise it before\n\nthe jury was discharged. Id. at 28–29 & n.8. In the alternative, the court stated that even if\n\nthe verdict was salvageable, the $1 million damages award was excessive and unsupported by\n\nthe evidence. Id. at 19–22. The “credible evidence” at trial, the court explained, supported\n\ndamages of only $81,000 – TAG’s actual costs – because TAG’s entitlement to the $900,000\n\ndeveloper’s fee was based on “pure speculation” and the record contained “nothing more\n\nthan passing references to and conjecture about” the harm to TAG’s business reputation. Id.\n\nat 20–21. The court therefore declared that if its inconsistent verdict ruling “fail[ed] to\n\nwithstand scrutiny,” it would propose a remittitur, “pursuant to which [the City’s] motion for\n\na new trial would be denied on the condition that [TAG] accept[ed] a reduced damages\n\namount of $81,000.” Id. at 22.\n\n\n\t                                                13\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

In August 2012, the second jury returned a verdict in\n\nfavor of the City on both. The district court entered judgment on August 10, 2012, which\n\nTAG timely appealed.5 The City cross-appealed, specifying that it sought to challenge the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of its pretrial motions that challenged TAG’s standing and sought to\n\npreclude the testimony of the plaintiffs’ two expert witnesses.\n\nVI.             Arguments on Appeal\n\n                 TAG contends that the district court improperly entertained the City’s objection to\n\nthe inconsistency of the 2010 jury verdict because the City waived that objection by not\n\nraising it before the jury was discharged. It also challenges the district court’s alternative\n\nconclusion as to remittitur of the 2010 jury’s $1 million compensatory damages award and\n\nraises a number of issues relating to the 2012 trial. Finally, it requests that we reassign the\n\ncase to a different district court judge upon remand. On cross appeal, the City renews its\n\nargument that TAG lacks standing and contends that the district court should have\n\nprecluded the reports and trial testimony of the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses.\n\n                                                                     DISCUSSION\n\nI.              TAG’s Standing\n\n                We first consider the City’s argument that TAG lacks standing to bring its FHA\n\nclaims because standing is a “threshold matter we must resolve before reaching the merits.”\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n5TAG also timely appealed successive judgments entered on August 30, 2012 and January\n13, 2013.\n\n\t                                                                        14\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Town of Huntington, 316 F.3d 357, 361 (2d Cir. 2003). The\n\nFHA makes it unlawful “[t]o refuse to sell or rent . . . or otherwise make unavailable or deny,\n\na dwelling to any person because of race . . . [or] familial status.” 42 U.S.C. § 3604(a). The\n\nAct permits any “aggrieved person” to bring a suit challenging such discriminatory housing\n\npractices. Id. § 3613(a)(1)(A). The term “aggrieved person” is broadly defined to include\n\nany individual or corporation that “claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing\n\npractice” or “believes that [it] will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is\n\nabout to occur.” Id. § 3602(d), (i). “This FHA definition of ‘aggrieved person’ extends as\n\nbroadly as permitted by Article III of the Constitution.” Olsen v. Stark Homes, Inc., 759 F.3d\n\n140, 158 (2d Cir. 2014). As such, there are no prudential barriers to a plaintiff’s standing\n\nunder the FHA, Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 372 (1982), and, to maintain suit\n\na plaintiff is required only to demonstrate an “injury in fact within the meaning of Article\n\nIII” by showing that it suffered “distinct and palpable injuries that are fairly traceable to [the\n\ndefendant’s] actions,” LeBlanc-Sternberg v. Fletcher, 67 F.3d 412, 425 (2d Cir. 1995) (quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n        “We review legal questions relating to standing de novo and factual findings for clear\n\nerror.” Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 221 F.3d 376, 382 (2d Cir. 2000).\n\n        The City argues that TAG does not have standing because it lacked an ownership or\n\ncontractual interest in the land where Spring Run Village was to be built and, therefore,\n\nTAG is indistinguishable from any other corporation or contractor that “had a future\n\ninterest in the prospective profits” that the Spring Run Village proposal might have\n\nprovided. It is true that in many of the FHA zoning cases that have found valid developer\n\n\n\t                                                15\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

See, e.g., Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S.\n\n252, 256 (1977) (99-year lease with contingent contract to purchase); Toll Bros., Inc. v.

Town of Huntington, 689 F.2d 391, 392, 394–95 (2d\n\nCir. 1982). We do not believe, however, that such possessory or contractual interests are an\n\nabsolute requirement for developer standing under the FHA. Rather, as framed by the\n\nSupreme Court, the “essence of the standing question, in its constitutional dimension, is\n\nwhether the plaintiff has . . . such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to\n\nwarrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction and to justify exercise of the court’s\n\nremedial powers on his behalf.” Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 260–61 (internal\n\nquotation marks and alteration omitted).\n\n        The Supreme Court’s decision in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975), is instructive.\n\nThat case involved a challenge to an exclusionary zoning ordinance brought by numerous\n\nplaintiffs, including an association of “firms engaged in the development and construction of\n\nresidential housing” in the area. 422 U.S. at 514–15. The association alleged that the\n\nchallenged zoning restrictions deprived a number of its members of “substantial business\n\nopportunities and profits.” Id. The Court found these allegations insufficient to establish\n\ninjury-in-fact because the association had not identified any “specific project . . . that [was]\n\nprecluded by the ordinance” and had not alleged that any of its members had “applied . . .\n\nfor a building permit or a variance with respect to any current project.” Id. at 516. The\n\nCourt observed, however, that a member of a second non-profit corporation that had\n\n\n\t                                                16\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                  \t                                                    \t\napplied for a zoning variance to construct a moderate-income housing project “possibly\n\nwould have had standing” but for the fact that the application had been submitted many\n\nyears before and there was no indication that the project remained viable at the time the\n\naction commenced. Id. at 516–17.\n\n        Several facts in this case set TAG apart from the developers in Warth, the most\n\nrelevant being that TAG developed a detailed proposal for a “specific project,” was denied a\n\nspecial use permit to construct that project, and asserted an injury that was not limited to\n\nfuture or prospective profits. The City does not dispute that TAG introduced evidence\n\ndemonstrating that it expended $81,000 on architects, consulting firms, land use studies, and\n\napplication fees in connection with the Spring Run Village proposal. Trial Tr. 213–16, 264.\n\nNor does it contest TAG’s evidence that the City’s February 2005 zoning decision, which led\n\nto the denial of TAG’s special use permit application, rendered the development of Spring\n\nRun Village impossible. Trial Tr. 135–36. TAG’s actual expenditures made to develop the\n\nspecific Spring Run Village proposal, which became worthless upon the City’s February 2005\n\nzoning decision and permit denial, are economic losses that constitute concrete and\n\nparticularized injuries for standing purposes. See Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 262\n\n(identifying the expenditure of “thousands of dollars on the plans for [a development] and\n\non the studies submitted to the Village in support of the petition for rezoning” as valid\n\neconomic injuries supporting standing). We have held, moreover, that the denial of an\n\nentity’s special use permit application, such as those jointly submitted by TAG and Gail\n\nAnderson in this case, is an injury sufficient in itself to confer standing.

We turn now to the merits.\n\nII.     Inconsistent Verdict\n\n        In its 2010 post-trial motion, the City argued that it was entitled to a new trial because\n\nthe jury’s verdict for TAG on its disparate impact claim was inconsistent with its verdict for\n\nthe City on TAG’s perpetuation of segregation claim. As noted, this purported\n\ninconsistency arose from the jury’s differing findings about whether the City had proven that\n\nits actions were in furtherance of a legitimate governmental interest and that no alternative\n\nactions would have served that interest with less discriminatory effect. TAG argues on\n\nappeal that the City waived its inconsistent verdict argument by failing to lodge it before the\n\ncourt excused the jury. We agree.\n\n        “It is well established that a party waives its objection to any inconsistency in a jury\n\nverdict if it fails to object to the verdict prior to the excusing of the jury.” Kosmynka v. Polaris\n\nIndus., Inc., 462 F.3d 74, 83 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Cash v. Cnty. of Erie, 654 F.3d 324, 342 (2d\n\n\n\t                                                18\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                                 \t\nCir. 2011). The timely objection requirement is “not merely a technicality” – it serves “to\n\ngive the court and the opposing party the opportunity to correct an error in the conduct of\n\nthe trial.” Kosmynka, 462 F.3d at 83. “We review de novo the district court’s interpretation of\n\nthe legal standard for waiver.” Jarvis v. Ford Motor Co., 283 F.3d 33, 59 (2d Cir. 2002)\n\n(discussing the standard for waiver under Fed. R. Civ. P. 51).\n\n        Here, it is undisputed that the City did not object on inconsistency grounds before\n\nthe district court discharged the jury. The district court nonetheless “declined to find\n\nwaiver” under the circumstances. S.A. 28. The court first rationalized that the “complicated\n\nand unique nature of th[e] case and the questions presented made it entirely reasonable . . .\n\nfor Saratoga not to immediately voice an objection.” S.A. 28. We can locate no support in\n\nour case law for the proposition that a litigant’s duty to object to a perceived error turns on\n\nthe complexity of the issues at play. Indeed, it seems to us that it is all the more essential in\n\ncomplicated cases for a litigant to timely notify the court of a perceived verdict inconsistency\n\nso as to permit an opportunity for correction of the error while the jury remains empanelled,\n\nthereby possibly heading off a second lengthy trial such as the one that occurred in this case.\n\nSee Kosmynka, 462 F.3d at 83―84 (purpose of the timely objection requirement is to “expos[e]\n\nthe inconsistency before the jury is dismissed, so that the court has available to it the option\n\nof re-submitting the questions to the jury after some further instruction”). We also do not\n\nfind the questions posed on the verdict form, see App’x, or the court’s oral recitation of the\n\n\n\n\n\t                                                19\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Even\n\nassuming, however, that there was some confusion, we have applied the waiver doctrine\n\nwhen “the jury returns an ambiguous verdict and counsel fails to seize the opportunity to\n\nraise an appropriate objection.” U.S. Football League v. Nat’l Football League, 842 F.2d 1335,\n\n1367 (2d Cir. 1988).\n\n                The district court also explained that because it “anticipat[ed]” that the City would\n\n“raise a challenge to the verdict in its Rules 50 and 59 motion papers,” it “reserved on all\n\nremaining issues, discharged the jury, and deferred the entry of judgment.” S.A. 28. This\n\nstatement is contradicted by the record, which indicates that the court entered judgment in\n\nfavor of TAG on July 6, 2010, four days after the jury rendered its verdict and eighteen days\n\nbefore the City filed its Rules 50 and 59 motion papers. N.D.N.Y. No. 05-cv-1369, ECF\n\nNo. 238. Although the City at the end of the trial renewed its Rule 50 motion for judgment\n\nas a matter of law and the district court stated, immediately after polling the jury, that it was\n\n“sure Saratoga Springs wants to bring a motion under Rule 50,” the City’s Rule 50\n\napplication was limited to the sufficiency of the plaintiffs’ evidence and made no reference to\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n6                      Question three: Has The Anderson Group proved by a preponderance\n                of the evidence that Saratoga Springs engaged in disparate impact\n                discrimination against African-Americans or families with children?

Trial Tr. at 1526–30, 1877, 2084. We have also rejected\n\nthe argument that a litigant may rely on a motion for judgment as a matter of law to preserve\n\nan inconsistency argument. See, e.g., Fabri v. United Techs. Int’l, Inc., 387 F.3d 109, 121 n.2 (2d\n\nCir. 2004); see also Tolbert v. Queens Coll., 242 F.3d 58, 74 (2d Cir. 2001) (correct remedy for an\n\ninconsistent jury verdict is not “to enter judgment as a matter of law but rather to order a\n\nnew trial”). In short, by raising its inconsistency argument for the first time in its post-trial\n\nmotion papers filed long after the jury was excused, the City waived its objection. See DiBella\n\nv. Hopkins, 403 F.3d 102, 117 (2d Cir. 2005).\n\n        On appeal, the City offers two additional reasons why we should overlook its failure\n\nto timely object. It first contends that the district court’s speedy dismissal of the jury\n\nprevented it from voicing an objection without interrupting the district judge. City Br. at\n\n24–25. We note, however, that the City had an opportunity to raise an inconsistency\n\nobjection immediately after the district court finished reading the jury’s verdict and before\n\nthe jury was polled. Trial Tr. at 2083. This is precisely how the defendant in Kosmynka\n\npreserved a similar objection for appeal. See Kosmynka, 462 F.3d at 82–83. Counsel for the\n\nCity also could have brought the matter to the district court’s attention as the jurors were\n\nexiting the courtroom, when there remained time for them to be recalled by the court. And\n\nwhile we understand and appreciate counsel’s hesitancy to incur the judge’s displeasure, we\n\nagree with our sister circuits that counsel’s duty to preserve issues trumps any discomfort\n\ncounsel may experience in voicing a timely objection. See Flynn v. AK Peters, Ltd., 377 F.3d\n\n13, 25 (1st Cir. 2004) (“Whatever discomfort counsel may have felt about objecting without\n\n\n\n\n\t                                                21\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Cir. 1961) (per curiam) (same).\n\n        The City next argues that a timely objection would have been futile because, even if\n\nmade, the nature of the inconsistency was such that it was not curable if resubmitted to the\n\njury. City Br. at 26–27. The City’s fundamental position is that the jury could not have\n\npermissibly concluded that it met its burden on its governmental interest justification with\n\nrespect to the perpetuation of segregation claim, but not with respect to the disparate impact\n\nclaim. The jury’s error, the City contends, arose not from its application of improper\n\ninstructions or use of a faulty verdict sheet, but rather from the jury’s abuse of its authority\n\nor its failure to apply proper instructions. Id. at 27. The City thus posits that, due to the\n\nnature of the error, resubmitting the verdict questionnaire to the jury would have been\n\nfruitless because it simply would have returned the same answers. Id.\n\n        There are several problems with the City’s position. First, it ignores our teaching that\n\na district court, properly alerted to a potential verdict inconsistency, may attempt to correct\n\nthat error by resubmitting the matter to the jury after providing “some further instruction.”\n\nKosmynka, 462 F.3d at 83–84. If, as the City contends, the jurors were required to answer the\n\ngovernmental interest justification consistently for all of TAG’s claims, then the district\n\ncourt could have provided such an instruction before resubmitting the matter to the jury,\n\nwhich may well have resulted in a different outcome.\n\n        This observation, however, brings up an even more fundamental defect in the City’s\n\nposition. Although the City proclaims there to be no error in either the district court’s\n\ninstructions or the verdict sheet, both the instructions and the sheet asked the jury to\n\n\n\t                                                22\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                                     \t                                     \t\ndetermine whether the City had met its burden on its governmental interest justification as\n\nto each of TAG’s claims separately. While the district court instructed the jurors that the\n\nCity’s governmental interest argument “applies in exactly the same way” as to each of TAG’s\n\nclaims, it at no point informed the jurors that they were required to have consistent\n\noutcomes. Trial Tr. at 2052–53. The verdict sheet, for its part, implied that different\n\noutcomes were possible by asking whether the City had met its governmental interest burden\n\nas a sub-question following each of TAG’s separately numbered claims. See App’x. At\n\nbottom, therefore, the City’s argument that the jury was required to reach consistent\n\noutcomes as to each of the governmental justification queries is, in reality, a challenge to the\n\ncontent of district court’s instructions or to the composition of the verdict sheet. As such\n\nchallenges must be raised before the jury retires to deliberate, the City waived them as well.\n\nSee Jarvis, 283 F.3d at 56–57 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 51).7\n\n                As a final matter, the City argues that the district court properly reached the merits of\n\nits inconsistent verdict argument because the 2010 verdict constituted “fundamental error.”\n\nSee Fabri, 387 F.3d at 121 (forfeited objection to a jury instruction or a verdict sheet may be\n\nentertained only if it is demonstrated that the alleged errors are “fundamental”).\n\n“Fundamental error is more egregious than the plain error that can excuse a procedural\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n7Although the City refers to the district court’s verdict sheet as a “special verdict\nquestionnaire,” it is evident that the jury verdict in this case was a general verdict because it\nasked the jury to “apply legal principles and assign liability.” Jarvis, 283 F.3d at 56; see also\nLavoie v. Pac. Press & Shear Co., 975 F.2d 48, 52–53 (2d Cir. 1992) (explaining the differences\nbetween general and special verdicts).\n\n\t                                                                    23\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

City Br. at\n\n23–24. Whether these disparate findings amount to fundamental error requires an\n\nassessment of our jurisprudence governing TAG’s FHA claims, which stems from our\n\nopinion in Huntington Branch, N.A.A.C.P. v. Town of Huntington, 844 F.2d 926 (2d Cir. 1988).\n\nIn that case, we recognized that an FHA violation could be established through a showing\n\nthat a facially neutral rule or policy had a discriminatory effect on a protected class. See id. at\n\n934–35; accord Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct.\n\n2507 (2015). We further explained that the discriminatory effect of a rule could arise in “two\n\ncontexts: adverse impact on a particular minority group [or] harm to the community\n\ngenerally by the perpetuation of segregation.” 844 F.2d at 937. Should a plaintiff make out\n\na “prima facie showing of discriminatory effect,” the burden then shifts to the defendant to\n\nprove “bona fide and legitimate justifications for its action with no less discriminatory\n\nalternative available.” Id. at 939.\n\n        Based on the statement in Huntington Branch that adverse impact and perpetuation of\n\nsegregation are both subspecies of a discriminatory effect claim, the City argues, and the\n\ndistrict court held, that a determination that the City’s actions were justified by a legitimate\n\ngovernment interest necessarily precludes both claims. S.A. 17; City Br. at 27–30. Huntington\n\nBranch, however, dealt only with allegations of discriminatory effect on a protected minority\n\ngroup and not, as here, allegations of discriminatory effect both on a protected minority\n\n\n\t                                                24\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                                 \t\ngroup and on families with children; it did not concern whether, or under what\n\ncircumstances, an asserted governmental interest justification that was sufficient to defeat\n\nliability as to one type of discriminatory effect also sufficed to defeat liability on the other.\n\nHuntington Branch therefore leaves open the possibility that a rule or policy may be invalidated\n\non the ground that the legitimate governmental interest served can be achieved by\n\nalternatives with less discriminatory effect on families with children, even though that same\n\nlegitimate governmental interest cannot be achieved by alternatives with less segregating\n\neffect on the community. When conducting plain error review, moreover, we typically will\n\nnot find fundamental error if “the operative legal question is unsettled.” Fabri, 387 F.3d at\n\n122 (quotation marks omitted). Because we had no reason to explore in Huntington Branch\n\nthe precise question at issue here, any error in the jury verdict, if there was one, is not\n\nfundamental.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the City waived its argument regarding the\n\ninconsistency of the jury verdict; the district court should not have reached the merits of that\n\nargument, and it therefore erred when it ordered a new trial on that ground.\n\nIII.    Expert Witness Testimony\n\n        On cross-appeal, the City argues that the district court should not have admitted the\n\nexpert testimony of Dr. Parnell and Dr. Raphael because neither expert: (1) identified or\n\nanalyzed a facially neutral policy of the City; (2) examined the City’s zoning code; (3) offered\n\nproof by statistical analysis that the zoning code had a predictable discriminatory effect on\n\nhousing opportunities; (4) offered proof “that a predictable effect on housing opportunities\n\nwas directed at an identifiable person or group of people protected by the FHA; or\n\n\n\t                                                25\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                                \t\n(5) offered proof of a causal connection between the City’s zoning code and any “adverse\n\neffect on housing opportunities.” City Br. at 75–86. These arguments are markedly\n\ndifferent from those pressed by the City in its April 2010 pretrial motion in limine, which\n\nsought to preclude the reports and testimony of the plaintiffs’ experts on the grounds that:\n\n(1) Dr. Parnell failed to exclude from his pool of eligible African-Americans those\n\nindividuals whose incomes were so low that they could not afford Spring Run Village’s\n\naffordable rents; (2) Dr. Parnell’s opinion was impermissibly speculative because it was not\n\nbased on data suggesting that African-Americans and families with children actually would\n\nhave applied for the available affordable housing; (3) Dr. Parnell failed to consider the effect\n\nof the Spring Run Village project as a whole, including the non-affordable components; and\n\n(4) Dr. Raphael’s report was irrelevant and not helpful to the jury.\n\n        It is well settled that arguments not presented to the district court are considered\n\nwaived and generally will not be considered for the first time on appeal. In re Nortel Networks\n\nCorp. Sec. Litig., 539 F.3d 129, 132 (2d Cir. 2008). Although this waiver doctrine is “entirely\n\nprudential” and, therefore, “we may exercise our discretion to consider waived arguments\n\nwhere necessary to avoid a manifest injustice,” id., we see no reason to do so in this case.\n\nThe City has offered no explanation for its failure to present to the district court the new\n\nexpert witness arguments it now advances on appeal, and the vast majority of these new\n\narguments do not challenge the admissibility of the expert testimony but rather the weight or\n\nsufficiency of that evidence. See, e.g., Boucher v. U.S. Suzuki Motor Corp., 73 F.3d 18, 21 (2d\n\nCir. 1996) (“[C]ontentions that the [expert’s] assumptions are unfounded go to the weight,\n\nnot the admissibility, of the testimony.” (quotation marks omitted)); In re Joint E. & S. Dist.\n\n\n\t                                                26\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

We turn now to the district\n\ncourt’s alternative suggestion that, if its new trial ruling failed to withstand review, it would\n\nreduce the jury’s $1,000,000 damages award to $81,000 unless TAG opted for a new trial\n\nlimited solely to the issue of damages.\n\nIV.          Remittitur\n\n             TAG argues that if we reinstate the 2010 jury verdict, we also should “reinstate” the\n\njury’s $1 million compensatory damages award because the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in ordering remittitur.

We therefore do not consider whether the evidence presented\nin this case was sufficient to make out a prima facie FHA disparate impact claim—including\nthe City’s contention, set forth in its Fed.

ISG Lackawanna, Inc., 774 F.3d 140,\n\n162 (2d Cir. 2014), we note that, in this case, the district court did not actually order\n\nremittitur—it simply “propose[d]” that course of action should its decision to order a new\n\ntrial not withstand scrutiny. S.A. at 35. We have independent authority, however, to order a\n\nnew trial on the issue of damages unless the plaintiff agrees to remittitur. See Stampf, 761\n\nF.3d at 207–08.\n\n        Remittitur is appropriate in two situations: “(1) where the court can identify an error\n\nthat caused the jury to include in the verdict a quantifiable amount that should be stricken,\n\nand (2) more generally, where the award is ‘intrinsically excessive’ in the sense of being\n\ngreater than the amount a reasonable jury could have awarded, although the surplus cannot\n\nbe ascribed to a particular, quantifiable error.” Kirsch v.

In this case, we identify one “specific error” in the jury’s damages award. Kirsch,\n\n148 F.3d at 165. TAG, as noted, introduced evidence at trial concerning three “categories”\n\nof damages: its actual costs, a lost opportunity to obtain a $900,000 “developer’s fee,” and\n\nharm to its business reputation. As discussed below, our detailed assessment of the trial\n\nevidence bearing on damages convinces us that the jury’s inclusion in its award of $900,000\n\nfor the lost developer’s fee was impermissibly speculative. See Stampf, 761 F.3d at 208\n\n(refusing to sustain a portion of the jury’s award for future emotional distress when, based\n\non the evidence presented, “the jury could only speculate” as to the emotional distress the\n\nplaintiff might suffer).

The Supreme Court has recognized that a claim for\n\ndamages brought pursuant to the FHA “sounds basically in tort—the statute merely defines\n\na new legal duty, and authorizes courts to compensate a plaintiff for the injury caused by the\n\ndefendant’s wrongful breach.” Curtis v. Loether, 415 U.S. 189, 195 (1974); see Meyer v. Holley,\n\n537 U.S. 280, 285 (2003) (“This Court has noted that an action brought for compensation by\n\na victim of housing discrimination is, in effect, a tort action.”). As a result, general tort\n\nprinciples govern the award and calculation of damages in FHA cases. See Meyer, 537 U.S. at\n\n285 (“[T]he [Supreme] Court has assumed that, when Congress creates a tort action, it\n\nlegislates against a legal background of ordinary tort-related . . . rules and consequently\n\nintends its legislation to incorporate those rules.”); Samaritan Inns v. District of Columbia, 114\n\nF.3d 1227, 1234 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (analogizing to general tort principles with respect to an\n\nFHA claim for damages brought by a developer).\n\n        Under general tort principles, compensatory damages are designed to place the\n\nplaintiff in a position substantially equivalent to the one that he would have enjoyed had no\n\ntort been committed. See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 903, cmt. a (1977); see also Harris\n\nv. Standard Accident & Ins. Co., 297 F.2d 627, 631–32 (2d Cir. 1961) (law of torts generally\n\n“attempts to put the plaintiff in a position as nearly as possible equivalent to his position\n\n\n\t                                                29\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Because compensatory damages are “intended to redress the concrete loss\n\nthat the plaintiff has suffered by reason of the defendant’s wrongful conduct,” Cooper\n\nIndustries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424, 432 (2001), courts will not permit\n\nrecovery when the connection between the claimed loss and the tortious act is speculative or\n\nuncertain, see Restatement (Second) Torts § 912, cmt. a (“[T]he recovery of damages for a\n\nparticular harm is dependent upon proof that the harm occurred as the result of the tortious\n\nconduct, and normally the plaintiff can recover damages for the harm only by proving this\n\nwith the same degree of certainty as that required in proving the existence of the cause of\n\naction.”); accord Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451, 466–67 (2006) (Thomas, J.,\n\nconcurring) (“[T]o recover, a plaintiff must show . . . that the specific pecuniary advantages,\n\nthe loss of which is alleged as damages, would have resulted, and, therefore, that the act\n\ncomplained of prevented them.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n        The seminal case on the issue of speculative damages is Story Parchment Co. v. Patterson\n\nParchment Paper Co., 282 U.S. 555 (1931). There, the Supreme Court articulated a “clear\n\ndistinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish the fact that [a plaintiff] had\n\nsustained some damage, and the measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix the\n\namount.” Id. at 562. As to the former, a plaintiff may not recover when “it is uncertain\n\nwhether such damages resulted necessarily and immediately from the breach complained of.”\n\nId. at 562–63 (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the plaintiff bears the\n\nburden of showing that the claimed damages are the “certain result of the wrong.” Id. at\n\n562. Once the plaintiff meets this burden, the defendant then bears the risk of uncertainty\n\nas to the amount of damages. See id. at 563 (When the tort “is of such a nature as to\n\n\n\t                                                30\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

TAG argues\n\nthat Willard Anderson’s “uncontroverted testimony” during the 2010 trial established that it\n\n“would have received $900,000 in developer’s fees if it had been able to develop the [Spring\n\nRun Village]” and that the City’s conduct caused it to lose the opportunity to earn those fees.\n\nTAG Reply at 16, 19. Willard Anderson, who was responsible for securing financing for\n\nSpring Run Village, testified that most of the financing for the project would have come\n\nfrom “conventional” sources but that financing the affordable housing portion of the\n\nproject was “somewhat complicated.” Trial Tr. 184. As a result, TAG had been speaking\n\nwith a consultant named Chris Betts “to determine what [it] need[ed] to apply for low-\n\nincome tax credits.” Trial Tr. 184, 186–87. According to Anderson, Betts “anticipated” that\n\nTAG would receive a $900,000 developer’s fee from the New York Division of Housing and\n\nCommunity Renewal (“DHCR”) as “part of th[e] tax credit process.” Trial Tr. 442.\n\n        Anderson knew that the DHCR used a “competitive process” to award the tax\n\ncredits, but beyond that had only a limited understanding of the contours of that process.\n\n\n\t                                                31\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                                 \t\nTrial Tr. 185, 442. It was his “understanding,” based on his conversations with Betts and\n\nthe DHCR personnel, that TAG had a “good chance of being funded within the next two\n\ncycles.” Trial Tr. 369–70. Although he did not know what percentage of applicants\n\nsucceeded in being awarded tax credits or have any statistics on the “ratio between\n\napplications . . . and the actual awarding of tax credits,” Anderson knew that there were “not\n\nan awful lot of these [affordable housing] projects” in Saratoga County and that DHCR was\n\n“excited about doing a project with Saratoga County.” Trial Tr. 370. As of December 2004,\n\nTAG had not formally retained Betts as a consultant or entered into an agreement with Gail\n\nAnderson to purchase the land where Spring Run Village was to be located. Trial Tr. 318,\n\n368–69, 443. It also had not applied for the tax credits because it was “in the process of\n\nhiring somebody to do a market study, which is one of the requirements under that\n\nprogram.” Trial Tr. 443.\n\n        Even fully crediting Anderson’s testimony, and viewing that testimony in the light\n\nmost favorable to TAG, the company failed to demonstrate that the lost fee was the “certain\n\nresult” of the City’s actions. Our decision in Casella v. Equifax Credit Information Services, 56\n\nF.3d 469 (2d Cir. 1995), which addressed a comparably speculative claim for lost opportunity\n\ndamages, is illustrative. In that case, the appellant claimed that he “lost the opportunity to\n\ntake advantage of low mortgage interest rates and low housing prices prevailing during the\n\nperiod” when the defendant’s erroneous report affected his credit score. See id. at 475. In\n\nsupport of this claim, the appellant introduced evidence that he was “actively seeking to\n\npurchase a home” and “had sufficient resources” to obtain a mortgage during the relevant\n\nperiod. Id. He did not, however, actually apply for a mortgage or make an offer to purchase\n\n\n\t                                                32\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                    \t                                                 \t\na home during this time. Id. We held that “in the absence of any evidence that appellant\n\nmade an offer to purchase property or applied for a home mortgage, the ‘lost opportunity’\n\ndamages he alleged were too speculative.” Id. So too here. Although TAG introduced\n\nevidence that it was actively preparing to apply for the tax credits under which it may have\n\nreceived the developer’s fee, its failure actually to apply for those credits or even contract for\n\nthe purchase of Gail Anderson’s land is fatal to its recovery of damages for the “lost\n\nopportunity” to obtain the developer’s fee.\n\n        A survey of similar claims for lost opportunity damages bears out our conclusion.\n\nThe closest analog we could discover to TAG’s claim that it lost the opportunity to receive\n\nthe fruits of competitive process are claims brought by contractors seeking damages for lost\n\nopportunities to bid on future contracts-claims, which are generally disfavored absent some\n\nevidence that the contracts would in fact have been awarded had the plaintiffs been able to\n\nbid. Compare Matson Plastering Co. v. Plasterers & Shophands Local No. 66, 852 F.2d 1200, 1203\n\n(9th Cir. 1988) (stating that “courts that have considered the issue of lost profits resulting\n\nfrom the lost opportunity to bid on subsequent contracts have found proof of damages too\n\nspeculative and uncertain”), and Collier v. Hoisting & Portable Engineers Local Union No. 101, 761\n\nF.3d 600, 603 (10th Cir. 1985) (“[T]he proof of damages [for the lost opportunity to bid on\n\nfuture jobs] was speculative at best in the absence of any effort on the part of plaintiff to\n\nobtain any jobs.”), with Fid. Interior Constr., Inc. v. Southeastern Carpenters Reg’l Council of the\n\nUnited Bhd. of Carpenters and Joiners of Am., 675 F.3d 1250, 1265 (11th Cir. 2012) (holding that\n\nthe plaintiff proved the fact that it was damaged by the lost opportunity to bid on future\n\ncontracts by introducing evidence that contractors “would have continued to award [the\n\n\n\t                                                   33\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Similarly, although Anderson testified in\n\nthis case that there was a “good chance” TAG would have been awarded the developer’s fee,\n\ncourts in FHA cases have declined to rely on similar nonspecific predictions to award\n\ndamages. See, e.g., Silver Stage Partners, LTD v. City of Desert Hot Springs, 251 F.3d 814, 823–24\n\n(9th Cir. 2001) (upholding a district court decision that damages based on an expert’s\n\npredicted future change in the applicable tax rate were “too speculative”). Finally, the single\n\nFHA case we could locate in which a developer claimed it was injured by the lost\n\nopportunity to be considered for an award of discretionary government subsidies rejected\n\nthat claim as “too speculative to serve as a basis for monetary relief.” Atkins v. Robinson, 545\n\nF. Supp. 852, 889 (E.D. Va. 1982), aff’d 733 F.2d 318 (4th Cir. 1984).\n\n        B.      Remaining Damages\n\n        Although the jury’s award of $900,000 for the lost developer’s fee cannot be\n\nsustained, we do not believe that a further reduction of the remaining $100,000\n\ncompensatory damages award is appropriate. See Shu-Tao Lin v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 742\n\nF.2d 45, 49 (2d Cir. 1984) (“Crucial to the practice of remittitur . . . is the requirement that\n\nthe court confine its role to the removal of the excess portion of the verdict so that the\n\ndamage calculation leaves in the judgment a portion of what the jury awarded.” (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)). Absent the developer’s fee, the remaining two components of\n\nthe jury’s award consisted of the $81,000 in actual costs TAG expended in preparing its\n\nSpring Run Village proposal and compensation for the harm TAG suffered to its business\n\nreputation. The district court found, and we agree, that TAG is clearly entitled to the award\n\nof $81,000 for its actual costs. We disagree with the district court, however, that the award\n\n\n\t                                                34\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                                \t\nshould consist of only that amount because “the record contains nothing more than passing\n\nreferences to and conjecture about [TAG’s] reputation.” S.A. 33.\n\n        Regarding the harm to its business representation, TAG introduced evidence at trial\n\nthat throughout the fall of 2004, various City officials vilified TAG in the press, referred to\n\nthe Andersons as “school yard bullies,” and publically alleged that the affordable housing\n\ncomponent of Spring Run Village was a “smoke screen.” Trial Tr. 137, 272–73, 301–02,\n\n322, 1277–79. A comprehensive review of the full trial reveals that the City did not oppose\n\nor rebut any of this evidence. Although the City now argues that TAG failed to prove harm\n\nto its business reputation because it did not offer evidence of lost business opportunities,\n\nTAG Br. at 38–39, the City has not cited any case holding that such evidence is necessary to\n\nrecover harm to business reputation under the FHA. Rather, the City appears to rely on\n\nNew York state law, under which damages due to harm to business reputation generally are\n\nnot recoverable in a breach of contract action without specific proof of lost business\n\nopportunities as a result of diminished reputation. See, e.g., Smith v. Positive Prods., 419 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 437, 453 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); Kidder, Peabody & Co., Inc. v. IAG Int’l Acceptance Grp., 28\n\nF. Supp. 2d 126, 128, 131 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).\n\n        Under the FHA, however, there is no similar requirement governing the type of\n\nevidence needed to permit recovery for lost profits. Indeed, the district court instructed the\n\njury that it was permitted to award compensatory damages for “any cost or expenses [TAG]\n\n. . . incurred as a result of the [City’s] discriminatory conduct,” including “financial losses,\n\nloss of business reputation and good will and loss of opportunity.” Trial Tr. 2054 (emphasis\n\nadded). The court did not instruct the jury as to the type of evidence required to support an\n\n\n\t                                                35\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                                     \t                                   \t\naward of those damages, and the City did not object to the content of the court’s\n\ninstructions. Thus, the jury was entitled to credit TAG’s uncontested and unrebutted\n\nevidence concerning the harm to its business reputation. Because TAG met its burden of\n\nintroducing evidence that the City’s actions harmed its business reputation, any risk of\n\nuncertainty as to the amount of those damages falls on the City. See Story Parchment, 282 U.S.\n\nat 563; Ismail v. Cohen, 899 F.2d 183, 186 (2d Cir. 1990) (“It is well settled that calculation of\n\ndamages is the province of the jury.”).\n\n                For all of these reasons, we sustain that portion of the jury’s compensatory damages\n\naward consisting of $100,000 for TAG’s actual costs and harm to its business reputation, and\n\nwe excise only that portion of the award consisting of $900,000 for the lost developer’s fee.\n\nWe remand with instructions that the district court grant a new trial limited only to the issue\n\nof damages unless TAG agrees to a remittitur reducing its award to $100,000.9\n\nV.              Reassignment on Remand\n\n                As a final matter, TAG requests that we reassign the case to a different district court\n\njudge on remand based on a number of comments made by the assigned judge during the\n\n2010 trial. We look to the following factors when considering whether to reassign a case on\n\nremand: “(1) whether the original judge would reasonably be expected upon remand to have\n\nsubstantial difficulty in putting out of his or her mind previously-expressed views or findings\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n9 TAG argues that in any new trial it should be permitted to seek damages for lost rentals\nand sales revenue, which the district court precluded it from doing during the 2010 trial\nbecause of TAG’s discovery violations concerning this evidence. TAG Br. at 44. We\nexpress no opinion on this issue and leave it for the district court to consider in the first\ninstance should TAG opt to proceed with the new trial rather than accepting the $100,000\naward.\n\n\t                                                                    36\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

The vast majority of the judge’s comments merely expressed\n\nexasperation at wasted time and contained no indication of bias. We also note that the\n\ndistrict judge issued numerous rulings in TAG’s favor during the course of the lengthy\n\nlitigation. Given the relatively benign nature of the judge’s comments, reassigning the case\n\nnow, after two full trials and with the possibility of a third on TAG’s damages, would entail\n\nwaste and duplication of effort far disproportionate to any gain, which is virtually non-\n\nexistent.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n          To summarize, we:\n\n    (1) VACATE the district court’s judgments entered on August 10, 2012, August 30, 2012,\n\nand January 15, 2013;\n\n(2) REVERSE the district court’s June 21, 2011 memorandum decision and order to the\n\nextent it directed a new trial on TAG’s disparate impact and perpetuation of segregation\n\nclaims;\n\n(3) REINSTATE the July 2, 2010 jury verdict to the extent it found the City liable on TAG’s\n\ndisparate impact claim; and\n\n\n\n\n\t                                                37\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

The district court, on the City’s motion, set aside that verdict and ordered a\n          new trial on the ground that the jury’s verdict in favor of TAG on its disparate impact claim\n          was inconsistent with the jury’s verdict against TAG on its perpetuation of segregation claim.\n          Following a second trial held in August 2012, a new jury returned a verdict in favor of the\n          City on both of TAG’s claims, and the district court entered judgment accordingly. TAG\n          now appeals the district court’s decision to order a new trial. On cross-appeal, the City\n          challenges two pretrial orders denying its motions to dismiss TAG from the case for lack of\n          standing and to preclude the testimony of TAG’s expert witnesses.\n\n\n          *   The Clerk of Court is respectfully requested to amend the caption accordingly.\n\n          **The Honorable Kiyo A. Matsumoto, United States District Judge for the Eastern District\n          of New York, sitting by designation.\n\n                                                             1\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Because\nany purported inconsistencies in the July 2010 jury verdict do not rise to the level of a\nfundamental error, we further hold that the district court committed a reversible error when\nit granted the City’s motion for a new trial on that ground. The City’s challenges to TAG’s\nstanding and the admission of its expert witness testimony are without merit. We therefore\nreinstate the July 2010 jury verdict to the extent it found the City liable on TAG’s disparate\nimpact claim. We further hold, however, that the July 2010 jury’s compensatory damages\naward was impermissibly speculative to the extent it awarded damages in the amount of\n$900,000 for a lost “developer’s fee” for which TAG had never applied. We therefore\nremand with instructions that the district court hold a new trial solely on the issue of\ndamages unless TAG agrees to accept remittitur of the July 2010 jury’s $1 million damages\naward to $100,000.\n\n       VACATED in part; REVERSED in part; REMANDED for further proceedings\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                                        REED N.

As envisioned, some 20% of the rental units in Spring Run Village were to be\n\ndesignated “workforce affordable,” meaning that they would be rented at affordable rates to\n\nlow-to-moderate income households. Before TAG could break ground on the project, the\n\nCity of Saratoga Springs rezoned the underlying property to preclude the construction of\n\nhigh-density developments. TAG and Gail Anderson filed suit, arguing that the City’s\n\n\n\t                                                  2\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                \t                                                \t\nzoning policies perpetuated racial segregation and had a disparate impact on African\n\nAmericans and families with children, thereby violating the Fair Housing Act (“FHA”), 42\n\nU.S.C. § 3604. In July 2010, in the Northern District of New York, a jury returned a verdict\n\nin favor of TAG only as to its disparate impact claim. The district court (Sharpe, J.) granted\n\nthe City’s motion for a new trial, nearly one year later, on the ground that the jury’s verdict\n\nfor TAG on its disparate impact claim was irreconcilable with its verdict against TAG on its\n\nperpetuation of segregation claim. The district court further stated that if its decision to\n\norder a new trial did not withstand appeal, it would order a conditional remittitur of the\n\njury’s $1,000,000 damages award to $81,000 because the evidence of harm to TAG’s\n\nbusiness reputation and loss of a developer’s fee was impermissibly speculative. In 2012, a\n\nsecond jury returned a verdict in favor of the City on both of TAG’s claims. TAG and the\n\nCity both appealed the resulting judgment.\n\n        On appeal, TAG primarily attacks the district court’s decision to order a new trial,\n\narguing that the City waived any challenge to inconsistencies in the 2010 verdict by failing to\n\nraise its objection before the jury was discharged. It also challenges the propriety of the\n\ndistrict court’s alternative ruling as to remittitur. The City argues on cross-appeal that TAG\n\nlacks standing to bring its FHA claims and that the district court erred when it denied its\n\nmotion to preclude the testimony of TAG’s two expert witnesses. For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we: (1) VACATE the district court’s judgments entered on August 10, 2012, August\n\n30, 2012, and January 15, 2013; (2) REVERSE the district court’s June 21, 2011\n\nmemorandum decision and order to the extent it directed a new trial on TAG’s disparate\n\nimpact and perpetuation of segregation claims; (3) REINSTATE the July 2, 2010 jury verdict\n\n\n\t                                                3\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Saratoga Springs & its Affordable Housing Shortage\n\n                Saratoga Springs is a city of approximately 26,000 year-round residents located some\n\nforty miles north of Albany, New York. The City relies heavily on seasonal tourism, and\n\nmuch of its history has been “linked to the affluent and powerful” who continue to visit the\n\nCity to enjoy its renowned horse racing track, performing arts center, and curative baths.\n\nJ.A. 1542. Despite the seasonal influx of tourists, however, the City’s year-round residents\n\nhave long faced a well-documented shortage of affordable housing. In 2000, for example,\n\nover 40% of the City’s total households were of low-to-moderate income, meaning that they\n\nearned less than 80% of the area’s median income. Yet only half of those households\n\nresided in affordable housing units.1 The shortage was especially hard on large low-to-\n\nmoderate income families, 80% of whom could not find affordable housing. In 1999, 2000,\n\nand 2004, the City identified “affordability,” and particularly “the shortage of affordable\n\nrental units,” as one of its most urgent housing needs. J.A. 1544, 1548–49, 1615. Saratoga\n\nSprings also experienced a concentration of low-to-moderate income residents in certain\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n1 The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development defines an\n“affordable” housing unit as one that costs no more than 30% of the total annual household\nincome. See HUD.gov, Glossary of HUD Terms, http://www.huduser.org/portal/glossary/\nglossary_a.html (last visited September 17, 2015).\n\n\t                                                                        4\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                                    \t                               \t\nareas of the City, particularly in the downtown neighborhoods of Westside and Northside,\n\nwhere most of the City’s high-density subsidized rental housing opportunities were located.2\n\n                Despite its acknowledged affordable housing shortage, the City’s land use policies\n\noverwhelmingly favored the construction of “upscale single-family detached housing.” J.A.\n\n1330, 1342. Between 1990 and 2004, for instance, 94% of the permits issued for new\n\nresidential units were for single-family homes that the City acknowledged were prohibitively\n\nexpensive for use as affordable housing. J.A. 1542–43, 1614. Of the mere 152 new\n\nresidential units located in multi-family buildings approved by the City during this fourteen-\n\nyear period, 85% were also prohibitively expensive for use as affordable housing options. Id.\n\nIn official reports submitted to the City Council and to the United States Department of\n\nHousing and Urban Development (“HUD”), the City repeatedly acknowledged that its land\n\nuse zoning polices were among the factors that presented “hurdles” and “obstacles” to the\n\ndevelopment of affordable housing. J.A. 1354, 1549. To alleviate this problem, the City’s\n\nAffordable Housing Task Force recommended in 2003 that the City conduct a\n\n“comprehensive review of [its] existing zoning regulations” to allow for “more housing\n\ndevelopment and greater density where appropriate.” J.A. 1353–54.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n2 According to the City’s 2000 Consolidated Plan submitted to the United States Department\nof Housing and Urban Development, these neighborhoods were comprised of three Census\ntracts—610, 611, and 612. Three “block groups” within these Census tracts were largely\nmade up of low-to-moderate income residents. The same three block groups also contained\na concentration of the City’s minority residents. While these residents comprised only 5.5%\nof the City’s overall population, the populations of the three block groups were, respectively,\n31.2%, 51.6%, and 71.8% non-white.\n\n\t                                                                    5\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                \t                                              \t\nII.     TAG’s Proposed Development Project & the City’s Zoning Changes\n\n        TAG is a for-profit commercial real estate development company based in Albany,\n\nNew York; it is owned by Gail Anderson and her three children—Susan Anderson Touhey,\n\nWillard Anderson, and Gregory Anderson. In 2002, the company began pursuing plans to\n\ndevelop a 44-acre residential project called Spring Run Village on an undeveloped tract of\n\nland owned by Gail Anderson on the outskirts of the City. The proposed development,\n\nbilled as a “Village within the City,” was to contain 250 to 300 housing units spread between\n\ncondominiums, townhouse-style apartments, and small buildings with multiple apartments.\n\nOne of TAG’s stated goals in developing Spring Run Village was to help alleviate the City’s\n\naffordable housing shortage. To that end, at least 20% the rental housing units were to be\n\ndesignated “workforce affordable,” meaning they would be rented at affordable rates only to\n\nlow-to-moderate income households. Until it began planning Spring Run Village, TAG had\n\nnever before been involved with any residential or affordable housing development projects.\n\n        Gail Anderson’s property was located within a City zoning district known as the\n\nSouthern Weibel Avenue District (the “SWAD”). The SWAD originally was designated as a\n\n“high impact area,” which allowed for the development of high-density commercial and\n\nresidential projects like Spring Run Village. In 2001, however, the City Council adopted a\n\nnew comprehensive zoning plan that established a “unified set of policies for guiding the\n\nphysical development of the City of Saratoga Springs.” J.A. 1533. This new plan reflected a\n\n“City-in-the-Country” vision that called for a “city with an intensively developed urban core\n\n. . . with well-defined urban edges and an outlying area comprised of open lands, a landscape\n\nor rural character and low density residential development.” Id. The comprehensive plan\n\n\n\t                                                6\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                \t                                           \t\nproposed that the SWAD be redesignated as part of the City’s new Conservation\n\nDevelopment District, which would limit the permissible density of residential development\n\nin the area. Consistent with this plan, the City Council voted in May 2003 to rezone the\n\nSWAD as a low-density “rural-residential” area, which permitted no more than one structure\n\nper every two acres. A New York state court set aside that decision in May 2004 on the\n\nground that the rezoning did not comply with New York State’s Environmental Quality\n\nReview Act (“SEQRA”).\n\n        Following the New York state court’s decision, TAG moved forward with its plans\n\nfor Spring Run Village, retaining an architect and consulting with an affordable housing\n\nexpert. In the fall of 2004, Gail Anderson and TAG filed with the City Planning Board a\n\nnumber of applications for special use permits that would allow TAG to construct the\n\ndevelopment consistent with the SWAD’s original zoning. While the Planning Board\n\nconsidered these applications, the City received a favorable environmental report that\n\nbrought it into compliance with SEQRA and permitted the SWAD rezoning. On February\n\n1, 2005, the day before the Planning Board was scheduled to vote on TAG’s special use\n\npermit, the City Council again voted to reclassify the SWAD zoning as low-density “rural-\n\nresidential,” thus precluding development of Spring Run Village. The Planning Board\n\nthereafter determined that TAG’s special use permit application “had to be considered\n\nwithdrawn” because the proposal was “no longer consistent with the new zoning.” J.A.\n\n1531.\n\n\n\n\n\t                                                7\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Pretrial Proceedings & 2010 Trial\n\n           TAG and Gail Anderson filed this action in October 2005, claiming that the City’s\n\nFebruary 2005 rezoning and denial of the special use permit violated the Fair Housing Act.\n\nPointing to the City’s affordable housing shortage, which was especially hard on large\n\nfamilies, and to the clustering of minorities in the few downtown areas with high-density\n\nsubsidized housing, the plaintiffs alleged that African-Americans and families with children\n\nwere in disproportionate need of the affordable rental housing contemplated in the Spring\n\nRun Village proposal. Plaintiffs therefore asserted that precluding completion of the\n\nproposed development perpetuated racial segregation in Saratoga Springs and had a\n\ndisproportionate impact on African-Americans and families with children. They further\n\nalleged that the City’s actions resulted from widespread community opposition to the\n\naffordable housing component of Spring Run Village based on the type of residents it would\n\nattract.\n\n           The City responded that even if its zoning decisions disproportionately affected\n\nAfrican-Americans or families with children, the City did not violate the FHA because the\n\nFebruary 2005 rezoning was undertaken for the legitimate, bona fide governmental purpose\n\nof bringing the zoning code into compliance with the City’s 2001 Comprehensive Plan. In a\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the City unsuccessfully sought to have TAG dismissed from\n\nthe case for lack of standing, arguing that the company could not demonstrate any injury\n\nbecause it had never contracted with Gail Anderson to purchase the land where Spring Run\n\nVillage was to be built.\n\n\n\n\n\t                                                 8\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Expert Reports & Testimony\n\n                In an April 2010 pretrial motion in limine, the City sought to preclude the reports and\n\ntestimony of the plaintiffs’ two expert witnesses, Dr. Allan Parnell and Dr. Stephen Raphael.\n\nThe district court denied the City’s motion in June 2010, and the case proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial that lasted nine days during which both experts testified.\n\n                B.              Evidence as to Damages\n\n                At trial, the plaintiffs introduced evidence concerning three categories of damages:\n\n(1) costs incurred by TAG in developing and seeking approval for Spring Run Village; (2) a\n\nlost “developer’s fee” of $900,000; and (3) harm to TAG’s business reputation. As to the\n\nfirst category, TAG officer Willard Anderson testified that the company spent a total of\n\n$81,000 on consultants, architects, studies, and application fees in connection with its Spring\n\nRun Village proposal. Trial Tr. 213–16, 264.3 He also testified that when the City made its\n\nJanuary 2005 zoning decision, TAG had been in the process of determining how to apply for\n\nlow income housing tax credits from the New York State Division of Housing and\n\nCommunity Renewal, and that TAG anticipated receiving a $900,000 “developer’s fee” as a\n\nresult of that process. Trial Tr. 184, 186–87, 442. Concerning the harm to TAG’s business\n\nreputation, Willard Anderson and his brother, Gregory, testified that during the fall of 2004,\n\nvarious City officials vilified TAG in the press, referred to the Andersons as “school yard\n\nbullies,” and publically alleged that the affordable housing component of Spring Run Village\n\nwas a “smoke screen.” Trial Tr. 137, 272–73, 301–02, 1277–79.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n3   Citations to “Trial Tr.” refer to the transcript of the 2010 trial.\n\n\t                                                                    9\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Jury Instructions & Verdict\n\n        At the end of the plaintiffs’ case in chief, and again following the close of the\n\nevidence, the City moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 50 on the ground that the plaintiffs’ evidence was insufficient to sustain their\n\nclaims. The court reserved decision on both occasions. At the end of the case, the district\n\ncourt instructed the jury on the elements of the plaintiffs’ claims and the City’s\n\ncorresponding defenses. Beginning with the plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim, the court\n\nexplained:\n\n                 To establish . . . a claim [of disparate impact discrimination], the\n        plaintiff is not required to show that the defendant intended to discriminate . .\n        . . Rather, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that\n        the defendant’s conduct actually or predictably had a substantial and\n        discriminatory impact on African-Americans or families with children. . . .\n                 I turn now to a defense to the [disparate impact claim] that w[as] raised\n        by Saratoga Springs. . . . [W]hen it comes to this defense, this is something\n        Saratoga needs to prove. If you find that Saratoga Springs’ conduct had a\n        substantial discriminatory impact on African-Americans or families with\n        children, then you must decide whether Saratoga Springs has proved by a\n        preponderance of the evidence that its conduct furthered a legitimate, bona\n        fide governmental interest and that no alternative action would have served\n        that interest with a less discriminatory impact. This acts as a defense to\n        liability for disparate impact discrimination, and so Saratoga Springs has the\n        burden to prove that it is entitled to this defense.\n                 In summary, Ms. Anderson and The Anderson Group must each prove\n        by a preponderance of the evidence that Saratoga Springs’ conduct had a\n        substantial discriminatory impact on African-Americans or families with\n        children. If you the jury are satisfied that Ms. Anderson and The Anderson\n        Group has [sic] proved their claims of disparate impact discrimination, then\n        and only then may you consider whether Saratoga Springs’ conduct furthered\n        a legitimate, bona fide governmental interest, and that no alternative action\n        would have served that interest with a less discriminatory impact. . . .\n                 Let me turn to the . . . claim for perpetuation of segregation. Th[is] . . .\n        claim . . . operates like a claim based on disparate impact, except that it\n        addresses harm done to the community in general rather than harm done to a\n        particular protected group.\n\n\n\t                                                10\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

If you were\n        satisfied that it had, then Saratoga Springs would not be liable . . . .\n\nTrial Tr. 2049–53.\n\n        As to damages, the district court instructed the jury that it was permitted to award\n\ncompensatory damages for “any cost or expenses [TAG] . . . incurred as a result of the\n\n[City’s] discriminatory conduct,” including “financial losses, loss of business reputation and\n\ngood will and loss of opportunity,” as well as “reasonable compensation for emotional\n\ndistress and humiliation.” Trial Tr. 2054. The court cautioned, however, that the jurors\n\n“should not award compensatory damages for speculative injuries but only for those injuries\n\nthat the plaintiff has actually suffered” and that “[h]arm to a plaintiff which is not the\n\nproximate result of unlawful conduct does not entitle . . . it to damages.” Trial Tr. 2055.\n\n        After instructing the jury to begin its deliberations, the district court sent the jury a\n\nverdict form to which neither party lodged an objection. Trial Tr. 2063. The jury ultimately\n\nreturned a verdict on July 2, 2010 in which it concluded that TAG (but not Gail Anderson)\n\nhad proven both that the City “engaged in disparate impact discrimination against African\n\nAmericans or families with children” and “engaged in the perpetuation of segregation against\n\nAfrican Americans.” S.A. 6, 8. The jury found, however, that the City was liable only as to\n\nthe disparate impact claim because, as to the perpetuation of segregation claim, the City had\n\n\t                                                11\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Trial Tr. 2083. The City responded affirmatively and, after the\n\njurors confirmed that the court’s reading of the verdict form was correct, the following\n\ncolloquy took place:\n\n                THE COURT:                                      Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your service.\n                                                                Thank you very much.

The City’s Post-Trial Motion\n\n                On July 22, 2010, the City submitted a letter that it asked the court to construe as\n\nmotions brought pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 50 and 59.

City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                               \t\nreiterated its position that TAG lacked standing and argued that the trial evidence was\n\ninsufficient to sustain the jury verdict on the disparate impact claim. It further contended\n\nthat it was entitled to a new trial because it was not possible to harmonize the jury’s finding\n\nthat the City had met its burden on its governmental interest justification as to the\n\nperpetuation of segregation claim but not as to the disparate impact claim. Finally, it argued\n\nthat the trial evidence did not support the jury’s $1 million damages award and, therefore,\n\nremittitur was appropriate.\n\n        By order entered on June 21, 2011, the district court granted the City’s motion to the\n\nextent it requested a new trial. S.A. 14. Although the court rejected the City’s standing and\n\nsufficiency of the evidence arguments, it agreed that the jury’s verdict was inconsistent and\n\nincapable of harmonization. Id. at 29–30. To reach this conclusion, the court rejected\n\nTAG’s argument that the City waived any inconsistency challenge by failing to raise it before\n\nthe jury was discharged. Id. at 28–29 & n.8. In the alternative, the court stated that even if\n\nthe verdict was salvageable, the $1 million damages award was excessive and unsupported by\n\nthe evidence. Id. at 19–22. The “credible evidence” at trial, the court explained, supported\n\ndamages of only $81,000 – TAG’s actual costs – because TAG’s entitlement to the $900,000\n\ndeveloper’s fee was based on “pure speculation” and the record contained “nothing more\n\nthan passing references to and conjecture about” the harm to TAG’s business reputation. Id.\n\nat 20–21. The court therefore declared that if its inconsistent verdict ruling “fail[ed] to\n\nwithstand scrutiny,” it would propose a remittitur, “pursuant to which [the City’s] motion for\n\na new trial would be denied on the condition that [TAG] accept[ed] a reduced damages\n\namount of $81,000.” Id. at 22.\n\n\n\t                                                13\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

In August 2012, the second jury returned a verdict in\n\nfavor of the City on both. The district court entered judgment on August 10, 2012, which\n\nTAG timely appealed.5 The City cross-appealed, specifying that it sought to challenge the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of its pretrial motions that challenged TAG’s standing and sought to\n\npreclude the testimony of the plaintiffs’ two expert witnesses.\n\nVI.             Arguments on Appeal\n\n                 TAG contends that the district court improperly entertained the City’s objection to\n\nthe inconsistency of the 2010 jury verdict because the City waived that objection by not\n\nraising it before the jury was discharged. It also challenges the district court’s alternative\n\nconclusion as to remittitur of the 2010 jury’s $1 million compensatory damages award and\n\nraises a number of issues relating to the 2012 trial. Finally, it requests that we reassign the\n\ncase to a different district court judge upon remand. On cross appeal, the City renews its\n\nargument that TAG lacks standing and contends that the district court should have\n\nprecluded the reports and trial testimony of the plaintiffs’ expert witnesses.\n\n                                                                     DISCUSSION\n\nI.

The association alleged that the\n\nchallenged zoning restrictions deprived a number of its members of “substantial business\n\nopportunities and profits.” Id. The Court found these allegations insufficient to establish\n\ninjury-in-fact because the association had not identified any “specific project . . . that [was]\n\nprecluded by the ordinance” and had not alleged that any of its members had “applied . . .\n\nfor a building permit or a variance with respect to any current project.” Id. at 516. The\n\nCourt observed, however, that a member of a second non-profit corporation that had\n\n\n\t                                                16\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Id. at 516–17.\n\n        Several facts in this case set TAG apart from the developers in Warth, the most\n\nrelevant being that TAG developed a detailed proposal for a “specific project,” was denied a\n\nspecial use permit to construct that project, and asserted an injury that was not limited to\n\nfuture or prospective profits. The City does not dispute that TAG introduced evidence\n\ndemonstrating that it expended $81,000 on architects, consulting firms, land use studies, and\n\napplication fees in connection with the Spring Run Village proposal. Trial Tr. 213–16, 264.\n\nNor does it contest TAG’s evidence that the City’s February 2005 zoning decision, which led\n\nto the denial of TAG’s special use permit application, rendered the development of Spring\n\nRun Village impossible. Trial Tr. 135–36. TAG’s actual expenditures made to develop the\n\nspecific Spring Run Village proposal, which became worthless upon the City’s February 2005\n\nzoning decision and permit denial, are economic losses that constitute concrete and\n\nparticularized injuries for standing purposes. See Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 262\n\n(identifying the expenditure of “thousands of dollars on the plans for [a development] and\n\non the studies submitted to the Village in support of the petition for rezoning” as valid\n\neconomic injuries supporting standing).

Inconsistent Verdict\n\n        In its 2010 post-trial motion, the City argued that it was entitled to a new trial because\n\nthe jury’s verdict for TAG on its disparate impact claim was inconsistent with its verdict for\n\nthe City on TAG’s perpetuation of segregation claim. As noted, this purported\n\ninconsistency arose from the jury’s differing findings about whether the City had proven that\n\nits actions were in furtherance of a legitimate governmental interest and that no alternative\n\nactions would have served that interest with less discriminatory effect. TAG argues on\n\nappeal that the City waived its inconsistent verdict argument by failing to lodge it before the\n\ncourt excused the jury. We agree.\n\n        “It is well established that a party waives its objection to any inconsistency in a jury\n\nverdict if it fails to object to the verdict prior to the excusing of the jury.” Kosmynka v.

The district court nonetheless “declined to find\n\nwaiver” under the circumstances. S.A. 28. The court first rationalized that the “complicated\n\nand unique nature of th[e] case and the questions presented made it entirely reasonable . . .\n\nfor Saratoga not to immediately voice an objection.” S.A. 28. We can locate no support in\n\nour case law for the proposition that a litigant’s duty to object to a perceived error turns on\n\nthe complexity of the issues at play. Indeed, it seems to us that it is all the more essential in\n\ncomplicated cases for a litigant to timely notify the court of a perceived verdict inconsistency\n\nso as to permit an opportunity for correction of the error while the jury remains empanelled,\n\nthereby possibly heading off a second lengthy trial such as the one that occurred in this case.\n\nSee Kosmynka, 462 F.3d at 83―84 (purpose of the timely objection requirement is to “expos[e]\n\nthe inconsistency before the jury is dismissed, so that the court has available to it the option\n\nof re-submitting the questions to the jury after some further instruction”).

It first contends that the district court’s speedy dismissal of the jury\n\nprevented it from voicing an objection without interrupting the district judge. City Br. at\n\n24–25. We note, however, that the City had an opportunity to raise an inconsistency\n\nobjection immediately after the district court finished reading the jury’s verdict and before\n\nthe jury was polled. Trial Tr. at 2083. This is precisely how the defendant in Kosmynka\n\npreserved a similar objection for appeal. See Kosmynka, 462 F.3d at 82–83. Counsel for the\n\nCity also could have brought the matter to the district court’s attention as the jurors were\n\nexiting the courtroom, when there remained time for them to be recalled by the court. And\n\nwhile we understand and appreciate counsel’s hesitancy to incur the judge’s displeasure, we\n\nagree with our sister circuits that counsel’s duty to preserve issues trumps any discomfort\n\ncounsel may experience in voicing a timely objection.

City Br. at 26–27. The City’s fundamental position is that the jury could not have\n\npermissibly concluded that it met its burden on its governmental interest justification with\n\nrespect to the perpetuation of segregation claim, but not with respect to the disparate impact\n\nclaim. The jury’s error, the City contends, arose not from its application of improper\n\ninstructions or use of a faulty verdict sheet, but rather from the jury’s abuse of its authority\n\nor its failure to apply proper instructions. Id. at 27. The City thus posits that, due to the\n\nnature of the error, resubmitting the verdict questionnaire to the jury would have been\n\nfruitless because it simply would have returned the same answers. Id.\n\n        There are several problems with the City’s position. First, it ignores our teaching that\n\na district court, properly alerted to a potential verdict inconsistency, may attempt to correct\n\nthat error by resubmitting the matter to the jury after providing “some further instruction.”\n\nKosmynka, 462 F.3d at 83–84. If, as the City contends, the jurors were required to answer the\n\ngovernmental interest justification consistently for all of TAG’s claims, then the district\n\ncourt could have provided such an instruction before resubmitting the matter to the jury,\n\nwhich may well have resulted in a different outcome.\n\n        This observation, however, brings up an even more fundamental defect in the City’s\n\nposition. Although the City proclaims there to be no error in either the district court’s\n\ninstructions or the verdict sheet, both the instructions and the sheet asked the jury to\n\n\n\t                                                22\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                                     \t                                     \t\ndetermine whether the City had met its burden on its governmental interest justification as\n\nto each of TAG’s claims separately. While the district court instructed the jurors that the\n\nCity’s governmental interest argument “applies in exactly the same way” as to each of TAG’s\n\nclaims, it at no point informed the jurors that they were required to have consistent\n\noutcomes. Trial Tr. at 2052–53. The verdict sheet, for its part, implied that different\n\noutcomes were possible by asking whether the City had met its governmental interest burden\n\nas a sub-question following each of TAG’s separately numbered claims. See App’x. At\n\nbottom, therefore, the City’s argument that the jury was required to reach consistent\n\noutcomes as to each of the governmental justification queries is, in reality, a challenge to the\n\ncontent of district court’s instructions or to the composition of the verdict sheet. As such\n\nchallenges must be raised before the jury retires to deliberate, the City waived them as well.\n\nSee Jarvis, 283 F.3d at 56–57 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 51).7\n\n                As a final matter, the City argues that the district court properly reached the merits of\n\nits inconsistent verdict argument because the 2010 verdict constituted “fundamental error.”\n\nSee Fabri, 387 F.3d at 121 (forfeited objection to a jury instruction or a verdict sheet may be\n\nentertained only if it is demonstrated that the alleged errors are “fundamental”).\n\n“Fundamental error is more egregious than the plain error that can excuse a procedural\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\n7Although the City refers to the district court’s verdict sheet as a “special verdict\nquestionnaire,” it is evident that the jury verdict in this case was a general verdict because it\nasked the jury to “apply legal principles and assign liability.” Jarvis, 283 F.3d at 56; see also\nLavoie v.

See id. at\n\n934–35; accord Texas Dep’t of Hous. & Cmty. Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959750\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959750/texas-dept-of-housing-and-community-affairs-v-inclusive-communities/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2015). We further explained that the discriminatory effect of a rule could arise in “two\n\ncontexts: adverse impact on a particular minority group [or] harm to the community\n\ngenerally by the perpetuation of segregation.” 844 F.2d at 937. Should a plaintiff make out\n\na “prima facie showing of discriminatory effect,” the burden then shifts to the defendant to\n\nprove “bona fide and legitimate justifications for its action with no less discriminatory\n\nalternative available.” Id. at 939.\n\n        Based on the statement in Huntington Branch that adverse impact and perpetuation of\n\nsegregation are both subspecies of a discriminatory effect claim, the City argues, and the\n\ndistrict court held, that a determination that the City’s actions were justified by a legitimate\n\ngovernment interest necessarily precludes both claims. S.A. 17; City Br. at 27–30. Huntington\n\nBranch, however, dealt only with allegations of discriminatory effect on a protected minority\n\ngroup and not, as here, allegations of discriminatory effect both on a protected minority\n\n\n\t                                                24\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v. City of Saratoga Springs\n\t                                                 \t                                                 \t\ngroup and on families with children; it did not concern whether, or under what\n\ncircumstances, an asserted governmental interest justification that was sufficient to defeat\n\nliability as to one type of discriminatory effect also sufficed to defeat liability on the other.\n\nHuntington Branch therefore leaves open the possibility that a rule or policy may be invalidated\n\non the ground that the legitimate governmental interest served can be achieved by\n\nalternatives with less discriminatory effect on families with children, even though that same\n\nlegitimate governmental interest cannot be achieved by alternatives with less segregating\n\neffect on the community. When conducting plain error review, moreover, we typically will\n\nnot find fundamental error if “the operative legal question is unsettled.” Fabri, 387 F.3d at\n\n122 (quotation marks omitted). Because we had no reason to explore in Huntington Branch\n\nthe precise question at issue here, any error in the jury verdict, if there was one, is not\n\nfundamental.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the City waived its argument regarding the\n\ninconsistency of the jury verdict; the district court should not have reached the merits of that\n\nargument, and it therefore erred when it ordered a new trial on that ground.\n\nIII.    Expert Witness Testimony\n\n        On cross-appeal, the City argues that the district court should not have admitted the\n\nexpert testimony of Dr. Parnell and Dr. Raphael because neither expert: (1) identified or\n\nanalyzed a facially neutral policy of the City; (2) examined the City’s zoning code; (3) offered\n\nproof by statistical analysis that the zoning code had a predictable discriminatory effect on\n\nhousing opportunities; (4) offered proof “that a predictable effect on housing opportunities\n\nwas directed at an identifiable person or group of people protected by the FHA; or\n\n\n\t                                                25\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

These arguments are markedly\n\ndifferent from those pressed by the City in its April 2010 pretrial motion in limine, which\n\nsought to preclude the reports and testimony of the plaintiffs’ experts on the grounds that:\n\n(1) Dr. Parnell failed to exclude from his pool of eligible African-Americans those\n\nindividuals whose incomes were so low that they could not afford Spring Run Village’s\n\naffordable rents; (2) Dr. Parnell’s opinion was impermissibly speculative because it was not\n\nbased on data suggesting that African-Americans and families with children actually would\n\nhave applied for the available affordable housing; (3) Dr. Parnell failed to consider the effect\n\nof the Spring Run Village project as a whole, including the non-affordable components; and\n\n(4) Dr. Raphael’s report was irrelevant and not helpful to the jury.\n\n        It is well settled that arguments not presented to the district court are considered\n\nwaived and generally will not be considered for the first time on appeal.

Willard Anderson, who was responsible for securing financing for\n\nSpring Run Village, testified that most of the financing for the project would have come\n\nfrom “conventional” sources but that financing the affordable housing portion of the\n\nproject was “somewhat complicated.” Trial Tr. 184. As a result, TAG had been speaking\n\nwith a consultant named Chris Betts “to determine what [it] need[ed] to apply for low-\n\nincome tax credits.” Trial Tr. 184, 186–87. According to Anderson, Betts “anticipated” that\n\nTAG would receive a $900,000 developer’s fee from the New York Division of Housing and\n\nCommunity Renewal (“DHCR”) as “part of th[e] tax credit process.” Trial Tr. 442.\n\n        Anderson knew that the DHCR used a “competitive process” to award the tax\n\ncredits, but beyond that had only a limited understanding of the contours of that process.\n\n\n\t                                                31\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Although he did not know what percentage of applicants\n\nsucceeded in being awarded tax credits or have any statistics on the “ratio between\n\napplications . . . and the actual awarding of tax credits,” Anderson knew that there were “not\n\nan awful lot of these [affordable housing] projects” in Saratoga County and that DHCR was\n\n“excited about doing a project with Saratoga County.” Trial Tr. 370.

It also had not applied for the tax credits because it was “in the process of\n\nhiring somebody to do a market study, which is one of the requirements under that\n\nprogram.” Trial Tr. 443.\n\n        Even fully crediting Anderson’s testimony, and viewing that testimony in the light\n\nmost favorable to TAG, the company failed to demonstrate that the lost fee was the “certain\n\nresult” of the City’s actions.

In that case, the appellant claimed that he “lost the opportunity to\n\ntake advantage of low mortgage interest rates and low housing prices prevailing during the\n\nperiod” when the defendant’s erroneous report affected his credit score. See id. at 475. In\n\nsupport of this claim, the appellant introduced evidence that he was “actively seeking to\n\npurchase a home” and “had sufficient resources” to obtain a mortgage during the relevant\n\nperiod. Id. He did not, however, actually apply for a mortgage or make an offer to purchase\n\n\n\t                                                32\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

We held that “in the absence of any evidence that appellant\n\nmade an offer to purchase property or applied for a home mortgage, the ‘lost opportunity’\n\ndamages he alleged were too speculative.” Id. So too here. Although TAG introduced\n\nevidence that it was actively preparing to apply for the tax credits under which it may have\n\nreceived the developer’s fee, its failure actually to apply for those credits or even contract for\n\nthe purchase of Gail Anderson’s land is fatal to its recovery of damages for the “lost\n\nopportunity” to obtain the developer’s fee.\n\n        A survey of similar claims for lost opportunity damages bears out our conclusion.\n\nThe closest analog we could discover to TAG’s claim that it lost the opportunity to receive\n\nthe fruits of competitive process are claims brought by contractors seeking damages for lost\n\nopportunities to bid on future contracts-claims, which are generally disfavored absent some\n\nevidence that the contracts would in fact have been awarded had the plaintiffs been able to\n\nbid.

Similarly, although Anderson testified in\n\nthis case that there was a “good chance” TAG would have been awarded the developer’s fee,\n\ncourts in FHA cases have declined to rely on similar nonspecific predictions to award\n\ndamages.

See Shu-Tao Lin v.

Absent the developer’s fee, the remaining two components of\n\nthe jury’s award consisted of the $81,000 in actual costs TAG expended in preparing its\n\nSpring Run Village proposal and compensation for the harm TAG suffered to its business\n\nreputation. The district court found, and we agree, that TAG is clearly entitled to the award\n\nof $81,000 for its actual costs. We disagree with the district court, however, that the award\n\n\n\t                                                34\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

A comprehensive review of the full trial reveals that the City did not oppose\n\nor rebut any of this evidence. Although the City now argues that TAG failed to prove harm\n\nto its business reputation because it did not offer evidence of lost business opportunities,\n\nTAG Br. at 38–39, the City has not cited any case holding that such evidence is necessary to\n\nrecover harm to business reputation under the FHA. Rather, the City appears to rely on\n\nNew York state law, under which damages due to harm to business reputation generally are\n\nnot recoverable in a breach of contract action without specific proof of lost business\n\nopportunities as a result of diminished reputation. See, e.g., Smith v. Positive Prods., 419 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 437, 453 (S.D.N.Y. 2005); Kidder, Peabody & Co., Inc. v. IAG Int’l Acceptance Grp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 128, 131 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).\n\n        Under the FHA, however, there is no similar requirement governing the type of\n\nevidence needed to permit recovery for lost profits. Indeed, the district court instructed the\n\njury that it was permitted to award compensatory damages for “any cost or expenses [TAG]\n\n. . . incurred as a result of the [City’s] discriminatory conduct,” including “financial losses,\n\nloss of business reputation and good will and loss of opportunity.” Trial Tr. 2054 (emphasis\n\nadded). The court did not instruct the jury as to the type of evidence required to support an\n\n\n\t                                                35\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.

Thus, the jury was entitled to credit TAG’s uncontested and unrebutted\n\nevidence concerning the harm to its business reputation. Because TAG met its burden of\n\nintroducing evidence that the City’s actions harmed its business reputation, any risk of\n\nuncertainty as to the amount of those damages falls on the City.

Having reviewed all of the comments of which TAG complains, we hold that they do\n\nnot warrant reassignment.

Given the relatively benign nature of the judge’s comments, reassigning the case\n\nnow, after two full trials and with the possibility of a third on TAG’s damages, would entail\n\nwaste and duplication of effort far disproportionate to any gain, which is virtually non-\n\nexistent.\n\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n          To summarize, we:\n\n    (1) VACATE the district court’s judgments entered on August 10, 2012, August 30, 2012,\n\nand January 15, 2013;\n\n(2) REVERSE the district court’s June 21, 2011 memorandum decision and order to the\n\nextent it directed a new trial on TAG’s disparate impact and perpetuation of segregation\n\nclaims;\n\n(3) REINSTATE the July 2, 2010 jury verdict to the extent it found the City liable on TAG’s\n\ndisparate impact claim; and\n\n\n\n\n\t                                                37\n\t\n\f12-3775-cv(L)\nThe Anderson Group v.
