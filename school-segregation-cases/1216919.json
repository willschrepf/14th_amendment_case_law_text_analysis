The affected inmates were split along racial lines into four\n\nseparate cells, some with as many as seven inmates per cell, where they were kept\n\nfor two weeks. One of the cells had broken plumbing, the inmates were not\n\nallowed to shower or otherwise maintain personal hygiene, and Fischer and the\n\nother inmates were forced to sleep on the floor and on other inmates’ bunks with\n\nsoiled bed linens. Another ill effect of the “hostile environment” that “erupted” in\n\nFischer’s cell was a fight that broke out in which Fischer was injured “by being\n\nstruck.” Also, Fischer was hit with “bodily fluids” because of all the “urine\n\nthrowing and . . . spitting” that took place during the inmates’ close confinement\n\n(once even in front of Officer Mays and another officer).\n\n                                          2\n\f      Throughout the lockdown, Officers Mays, Holland, and Pooser repeatedly\n\nmisled the inmates as to when they would be returned to their regular cells and\n\ndenied Fischer’s requests to speak with their superiors about the situation. So, on\n\nApril 26, 2003, Fischer lodged a written grievance. But instead of ending the\n\nlockdown and segregation, Sergeant Lafayette and 15 to 20 other officers\n\nretaliated. They conducted a “shakedown” during which Fischer “and others\n\nreceived pepper spray” after hearing Sergeant Lafayette at one point tell the other\n\nofficers to “make sure [the inmates] get something in their face.” Several other\n\ninmates were beaten.\n\n      The next day, after being returned to a locked down and segregated state,\n\nFischer filed another written grievance, this time to Captain Ellegood, the Jail’s\n\n“facility commander.” This, too, was ignored and in fact remained unaddressed as\n\nof November 2003, when Fischer filed his “second amended complaint.”\n\n      As a result of what he calls “this whole ordeal,” Fischer says that he endured\n\n“fear, stress, and suffering.” And although he has abandoned the issue on appeal,\n\nFischer also claimed in his sworn complaint that, in retaliation for his written\n\ngrievances and for bringing this lawsuit, Jail employees deprived him of\n\nmedication for his mental and physical conditions, including his “Bi-Polar, Manic\n\nDepressive state.” The resulting mood swings landed Fischer in “altercations” in\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fwhich he suffered a “broken nose and other [unspecified] injuries.”\n\n      On the basis of these allegations, Fischer sued the defendants, in both their\n\nofficial and individual capacities, claiming “racial discrimination, segregation,\n\nharassment, and cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment.” He\n\nalso claimed violations of his rights under the First Amendment, and “any other\n\nviolations or laws that I have missed.”\n\n      After the defendants filed answers, Fischer filed a motion for appointed\n\ncounsel, which the district court denied, and the defendants ultimately moved for\n\nsummary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of all\n\ndefendants, as to all claims. Fischer timely appealed.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      Summary judgment is appropriate if the record reveals no genuine issue of\n\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56. A district court’s order granting summary judgment is\n\nreviewed de novo, “viewing all evidence, and drawing all reasonable inferences, in\n\nfavor of the non-moving party.” Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., 408 F.3d 763,\n\n767 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\n      We review the denial of a motion for appointed counsel for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Bass v. Perrin, 170 F.3d 1312, 1319 (11th Cir. 1999).\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f                                             III.\n\n       On appeal, Fischer raises five issues warranting discussion.1 We address\n\neach of these issues, though in an order somewhat different from the order he\n\npresents them in his brief.\n\n                                              A.\n\n       First, we consider Fischer’s only argument bearing on the district court’s\n\ngrant of summary judgment to the Jail employees in their official capacities. In\n\nreaching its result, the district court reasoned that Fischer’s evidence failed to\n\nidentify a practice, policy, or custom of the Lee County Jail that was a “moving\n\nforce of injury” to him. Fischer argues simply that he “did list all of the customs,\n\npolicies, procedures, and rules and regulations violated [by] the defendants\n\nactions” by attaching to his complaint his formal grievance to Captain Ellegood.\n\nGiven our obligation to view pro se pleadings liberally, Estelle v. Gamble, 429\n\nU.S. 97, 106, 97 S. Ct. 285, 292 (1976), he argues that there is a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact on this point.\n\n       An official-capacity suit is, “in all respects other than name, to be treated as\n\n\n       1\n          In addition to the five issues we address in this opinion, Fischer also repeatedly\nsuggests that the district court violated his Seventh Amendment right to trial by jury when it\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the defendants. We have rejected this line of reasoning in\nthe past and therefore see no reason to discuss the argument again here. See Garvie v. City of\nFort Walton Beach, Fla., 366 F.3d 1186, 1190 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                               5\n\fa suit against the entity [of which the defendant is an agent].” Kentucky v.\n\nGraham, 473 U.S. 159, 166, 105 S. Ct. 3099, 3105 (1985). To prevail under §\n\n1983 against that entity, a plaintiff must show that the entity itself was the “moving\n\nforce” behind his constitutional deprivation, and the only way to do that is by\n\nidentifying a “‘policy or custom’ [of the entity that] played a part in the violation\n\nof federal law.” Id.\n\n      In light of these principles, the district court correctly granted summary\n\njudgment on the official-capacity claims. Fischer did in fact identify a policy of\n\nthe Lee County Jail in the formal grievance he submitted to Captain Ellegood. The\n\ngrievance cited the “Inmate Rules and Regulations” as providing two showers a\n\nweek for those inmates in disciplinary confinement and daily showers for all other\n\ninmates. But the claim Fischer made in his formal grievance and in his § 1983\n\ncomplaint (and that he makes again before us) is not that this policy was\n\nconstitutionally deficient, but that individual agents of the Lee County Jail violated\n\nit. We will take up this particular alleged policy violation when we examine the\n\nrelevant Eighth Amendment claim against the defendants in their individual\n\ncapacities, but for present purposes there is no question that Fischer has failed to\n\npresent evidence of any Lee County policy or custom that “played a part” in the\n\ndeprivation of his rights. In other words, he has shown no evidence that the county\n\n\n                                           6\n\fitself (as opposed to individual officers) violated his rights.\n\n                                           B.\n\n      Second, we address Fischer’s Eighth Amendment excessive-force claim,\n\nwhich is based on the pepper spray incident. In granting summary judgment on\n\nthis claim, the district court cited the absence of evidence “that the . . . spray was\n\nused for any other purpose . . . than to restore order,” or that Fischer incurred any\n\ninjury from the spray. Fischer does not mention the injury issue in his brief, but\n\ninstead says that he has presented evidence in the form of his sworn complaint that\n\nthe spraying was “wanton and deliberate and not necessary as no situation or threat\n\nof safety ever existed.” This, he says, means that summary judgment was\n\nimproper.\n\n       To establish a claim for excessive force in violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment, a plaintiff must show (1) that the force was “sadistically and\n\nmaliciously applied for the very purpose of causing harm,” Johnson v. Breeden,\n\n280 F.3d 1308, 1321 (11th Cir. 2002), and (2) that more than a de minimis injury\n\nresulted. See id.\n\n      Even assuming that Fischer presented sufficient evidence of an injury\n\n(which we doubt), summary judgment is due to be affirmed on the excessive force\n\nclaim because nothing in the record suggests the officers used the pepper spray\n\n                                            7\n\fwith the malicious intention of causing harm to Fischer. In support of their\n\nsummary judgment motions, the defendants produced two “OC Spray Compliance\n\nForms” and the affidavit of Sergeant Lafayette, all of which indicated that officers\n\nsprayed inmates Delamos and Armstrong for refusing to follow orders to face the\n\nwall during the shakedown. Given this evidence, the burden shifted to Fischer to\n\npresent “evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for [him],” Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 2512 (1986), on the issue\n\nof the defendants’ subjective intentions when they sprayed the inmates.\n\n       Fischer did not carry this burden. In his sworn complaint, Fischer baldly\n\nasserted that the officers sprayed him and the others as part of a “shakedown” that\n\nwas in retaliation for his written grievance of April 26, 2003. He also baldly\n\nasserted that the spraying was “unwarranted and cannot be justified therefore being\n\nclassified as an Improper and Excessive Use of Force.” Neither of these statements\n\namount to evidence of what the defendants intended. The same is true for mere\n\npromises of “affidavits and live testimony” (as Fischer made in his response to the\n\ndefendants’ motions for summary judgment) or “eight witnesses” (as he made in\n\nhis brief here).\n\n       The only sworn statement Fischer has provided in the course of this\n\nlitigation approaching relevance to the “malicious and sadistic” standard is the\n\n\n                                          8\n\fsingle sentence in his complaint that: “During this shakedown Sergeant Lafayette\n\ninstructed the Officers to ‘make sure they get something in their face’ . . . .” The\n\nproblem, however, is that this statement doesn’t actually bear on whether Lafayette\n\nor the “Officers” “sadistically and maliciously applied [the spray] for the very\n\npurpose of causing harm.” Johnson, 280 F.3d at 1321. It certainly does not shed\n\nlight on any of the five factors we use to determine whether force was used\n\n“sadistically and maliciously”: “(1) the extent of injury; (2) the need for\n\napplication of force; (3) the relationship between that need and the amount of force\n\nused; (4) any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response; and (5) the\n\nextent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably perceived by\n\nthe responsible officials on the basis of facts known to them.” Campbell v. Sikes,\n\n169 F.3d 1353, 1375 (11th Cir. 1999) (quotations and citations omitted). Summary\n\njudgment was therefore appropriate on Fischer’s excessive force claim.\n\n                                                C.\n\n       The third issue we consider also involves an Eighth Amendment claim, but\n\nthis one deals with the overcrowded and unsanitary conditions Fischer allegedly\n\nendured during the lockdown.2 The district court concluded that the conditions\n\n       2\n          Fischer’s Eighth Amendment claim may in actuality be a Fourteenth Amendment\nclaim: If he was a pre-trial detainee during the relevant events (as opposed to a convict serving a\nprison sentence), Fischer was protected not by the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and\nunusual punishment, but by the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process. See Hamm v.\n\n                                                 9\n\fFischer experienced were not “so extreme as to have posed an ‘unreasonable risk\n\nof serious damage’ to [Fischer’s] health or safety.” On appeal, Fischer argues that\n\na genuine issue exists as to this material fact in light of his interrogatory responses\n\nand the formal grievance he attached to his complaint.\n\n       To establish an Eighth Amendment claim based on prison conditions, an\n\ninmate must meet both an objective component, which requires that the conditions\n\nbe “sufficiently serious,” and a subjective component, which requires that the\n\nofficials acted with “deliberate indifference to prisoner health or safety.” Jordan v.\n\nDoe, 38 F.3d 1559, 1564 (11th Cir. 1994) (quotation marks omitted). To meet the\n\nobjective standard, “only those deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure\n\nof life’s necessities are sufficiently grave to form the basis of an Eighth\n\nAmendment violation.” Hudson v. McMillan, 503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S. Ct. 995, 1000\n\n(1992) (quotation marks omitted).\n\n       In applying this standard to the present case, we note that 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1997e(a) limits our review of Fischer’s conditions-of-confinement claim to only\n\nthose conditions he included in the formal grievance he submitted to Captain\n\nEllegood. See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (“No action shall be brought with respect to\n\n\nDeKalb County, 774 F.2d 1567, 1572 (11th Cir. 1985). We are unsure of Fischer’s status during\nthe events at issue in this case, but that uncertainty is of no consequence. The “minimum\nstandard” of ensuring inmates with the “basic necessities” is the same regardless of the\nconstitutional provision. Id. at 1574.\n\n                                             10\n\fprison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other federal law, by a\n\nprisoner confined in any jail . . . until such administrative remedies as are available\n\nare exhausted.”). Filed on the fifth day of the lockdown, the grievance mentioned\n\nthese four conditions: (1) “Some cells had as low as four inmates in them while\n\nother cells had as many as seven;” (2) “inmates were not only forced to sleep on\n\nbare cement floors but also on other inmates mattresses and linen” (which had not\n\nbeen washed after others’ use of those linens); (3) the inmates were deprived of\n\ntheir daily showers; and (4) the inmates’ laundry had not been done. Fischer does\n\nnot mention the laundry issue in his brief, so we deem any claim as to it\n\nabandoned. See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, 881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n.6\n\n(11th Cir. 1989).\n\n      When viewed through the applicable procedural filters, it is clear that even a\n\nliberal reading of Fischer’s sworn statements reveals no constitutional violation as\n\nto the three conditions we have before us (the overcrowding, sleeping, and shower\n\nconditions). For example, undisputed evidence shows that each jail cell could hold\n\nat least four inmates, meaning that the affected cells were never even at double\n\ncapacity during the lockdown. Even double capacity, the Supreme Court has held,\n\ndoes not violate the constitution absent “deprivations of essential food, medical\n\ncare, or sanitation.” Rhodes v. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337, 347–48, 101 S. Ct. 2392,\n\n\n                                           11\n\f2400 (1981). Furthermore, Fischer has given us no reason to believe that sleeping\n\non the floor or on unwashed bed linens or being denied showers amounts to either\n\na deprivation of “essential . . . sanitation” (which would be relevant as to Fischer’s\n\novercrowding claim) or an Eighth Amendment violation in their own right—at\n\nleast not when the duration is only five days. See, e.g., Hamilton v. Lyons, 74 F.3d\n\n99, 106–07 (5th Cir. 1996) (no constitutional violation where inmate was denied\n\nsheets and showers (among other things) for a three-day period); Hamm, 774 F.2d\n\nat 1575 (no constitutional violation where inmate had to temporarily sleep on a\n\nmattress on a floor or on a table). In other words, we agree with the district court\n\nthat Fischer failed to provide evidence of conditions that were sufficiently\n\n“extreme” as to “pose[] an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health\n\nor safety.” Chandler v. Crosby, 379 F.3d 1278, 1289 (11th Cir. 2004). Summary\n\njudgment on Fischer’s conditions-of-confinement claim was therefore appropriate.\n\n                                           D.\n\n      Next, we consider Fischer’s claim of “racial discrimination” stemming from\n\nthe racial segregation of inmates during the lockdown. The district court construed\n\nthis claim as an equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, applied\n\nstrict scrutiny, and found that the segregation was narrowly tailored to serve the\n\ncompelling interest of jail safety and security. In his brief, Fischer argues that the\n\n\n                                           12\n\fthreat of violence justifying the lockdown was not racial in nature, and that as a\n\nresult the racial segregation did not actually separate the alleged aggressor inmates\n\nfrom those who complained of the threats.\n\n      We view Fischer’s “racial discrimination” claim as an equal protection claim\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus apply strict scrutiny. See Johnson v.\n\nCalifornia, 543 U.S. 499, 506, 125 S. Ct. 1141, 1147 (2005) (holding that strict\n\nscrutiny is the appropriate standard of review for racial classifications even in the\n\nprison context). “Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of proving\n\nthat racial classifications are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling\n\ngovernmental interests.” Id. at 505, 125 S. Ct. at 1146 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Here, the defendants met their burden of showing that the racial segregation\n\nserved a “compelling governmental interest” by presenting the affidavit of\n\nSergeant Reis, in which he explained that he ordered the racial separation after\n\nreceiving an inmate’s complaint that the white inmates in Fischer’s cell block\n\nfeared violence from the black inmates in that block. Fischer has maintained\n\nthroughout this litigation that no threat of racial violence ever existed. But even if\n\nFischer is correct about that, he has not refuted Sergeant Reis’ explanation of what\n\nmotivated the decision to segregate. The reason was prison safety (even if\n\nSergeant Reis was mistaken about the true nature of the threat), and prison safety is\n\n\n                                          13\n\fclearly a “compelling interest” under Supreme Court precedent. See id. at 514, 125\n\nS. Ct. at 1151.\n\n      Likewise, the defendants met their burden of showing that the racial\n\nsegregation was narrowly tailored to neutralize the threat of racial violence.\n\nAlthough the defendants presented a log entry and the affidavits of two officers\n\nshowing that the segregation lasted from April 23 to April 27, the sworn statement\n\nin Fischer’s complaint that it lasted two weeks creates a genuine issue of fact as to\n\nthe segregation’s duration. The problem for Fischer is that this factual issue,\n\nthough genuine, is not material. Indeed, the defendants also submitted the affidavit\n\nof Captain Ellegood, in which he explained that one of the Jail’s classification\n\nsupervisors conducted a thorough investigation during the lockdown, and that the\n\nsegregation ceased “immediately” after she determined that the racial threat no\n\nlonger existed. Fischer, on the other hand, has pointed to no evidence suggesting\n\nthat the segregation continued after Jail officials thought the threat of racial\n\nviolence had passed. He thus has not identified a genuine issue on the material\n\nquestion of whether the segregation was narrowly tailored to secure the safety of\n\ninmates and employees at the Jail.\n\n                                           E.\n\n      Finally, we examine Fischer’s contention that the district court violated his\n\n                                           14\n\fSixth Amendment rights by failing to grant his request for appointed counsel. This\n\ncontention has no merit. Notwithstanding Fischer’s suggestion to the contrary, a\n\nplaintiff has no constitutional right to appointed counsel in a civil case. Bass, 170\n\nF.3d at 1320. Rather, a district court has broad discretion in deciding whether to\n\nappoint counsel, and should do so “only in exceptional circumstances.” Id.\n\nFischer stresses that he is inexperienced in the law, but as we have held before the\n\nmere fact that a lawyer’s assistance would be helpful does not amount to an\n\n“exceptional circumstance” where, as here, the core facts of the case are pretty\n\nmuch undisputed and the legal claims are straightforward. See id. The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Fischer’s motion for appointed\n\ncounsel.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f",

The affected inmates were split along racial lines into four\n\nseparate cells, some with as many as seven inmates per cell, where they were kept\n\nfor two weeks. One of the cells had broken plumbing, the inmates were not\n\nallowed to shower or otherwise maintain personal hygiene, and Fischer and the\n\nother inmates were forced to sleep on the floor and on other inmates’ bunks with\n\nsoiled bed linens. Another ill effect of the “hostile environment” that “erupted” in\n\nFischer’s cell was a fight that broke out in which Fischer was injured “by being\n\nstruck.” Also, Fischer was hit with “bodily fluids” because of all the “urine\n\nthrowing and . . . spitting” that took place during the inmates’ close confinement\n\n(once even in front of Officer Mays and another officer).\n\n                                          2\n\f      Throughout the lockdown, Officers Mays, Holland, and Pooser repeatedly\n\nmisled the inmates as to when they would be returned to their regular cells and\n\ndenied Fischer’s requests to speak with their superiors about the situation. So, on\n\nApril 26, 2003, Fischer lodged a written grievance. But instead of ending the\n\nlockdown and segregation, Sergeant Lafayette and 15 to 20 other officers\n\nretaliated. They conducted a “shakedown” during which Fischer “and others\n\nreceived pepper spray” after hearing Sergeant Lafayette at one point tell the other\n\nofficers to “make sure [the inmates] get something in their face.” Several other\n\ninmates were beaten.\n\n      The next day, after being returned to a locked down and segregated state,\n\nFischer filed another written grievance, this time to Captain Ellegood, the Jail’s\n\n“facility commander.” This, too, was ignored and in fact remained unaddressed as\n\nof November 2003, when Fischer filed his “second amended complaint.”\n\n      As a result of what he calls “this whole ordeal,” Fischer says that he endured\n\n“fear, stress, and suffering.” And although he has abandoned the issue on appeal,\n\nFischer also claimed in his sworn complaint that, in retaliation for his written\n\ngrievances and for bringing this lawsuit, Jail employees deprived him of\n\nmedication for his mental and physical conditions, including his “Bi-Polar, Manic\n\nDepressive state.” The resulting mood swings landed Fischer in “altercations” in\n\n\n\n                                           3\n\fwhich he suffered a “broken nose and other [unspecified] injuries.”\n\n      On the basis of these allegations, Fischer sued the defendants, in both their\n\nofficial and individual capacities, claiming “racial discrimination, segregation,\n\nharassment, and cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment.” He\n\nalso claimed violations of his rights under the First Amendment, and “any other\n\nviolations or laws that I have missed.”\n\n      After the defendants filed answers, Fischer filed a motion for appointed\n\ncounsel, which the district court denied, and the defendants ultimately moved for\n\nsummary judgment. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of all\n\ndefendants, as to all claims. Fischer timely appealed.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      Summary judgment is appropriate if the record reveals no genuine issue of\n\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.

In\n\nreaching its result, the district court reasoned that Fischer’s evidence failed to\n\nidentify a practice, policy, or custom of the Lee County Jail that was a “moving\n\nforce of injury” to him. Fischer argues simply that he “did list all of the customs,\n\npolicies, procedures, and rules and regulations violated [by] the defendants\n\nactions” by attaching to his complaint his formal grievance to Captain Ellegood.\n\nGiven our obligation to view pro se pleadings liberally, Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 106, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We have rejected this line of reasoning in\nthe past and therefore see no reason to discuss the argument again here. See Garvie v. City of\nFort Walton Beach, Fla., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76552\"><a href=\"/opinion/76552/william-h-garvie-v-city-of-fort-walton-beach/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1190 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n                                               5\n\fa suit against the entity [of which the defendant is an agent].” Kentucky v.\n\nGraham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111500\"><a href=\"/opinion/111500/kentucky-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 166, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111500\"><a href=\"/opinion/111500/kentucky-v-graham/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3099</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3105 (1985). To prevail under §\n\n1983 against that entity, a plaintiff must show that the entity itself was the “moving\n\nforce” behind his constitutional deprivation, and the only way to do that is by\n\nidentifying a “‘policy or custom’ [of the entity that] played a part in the violation\n\nof federal law.” Id.\n\n      In light of these principles, the district court correctly granted summary\n\njudgment on the official-capacity claims. Fischer did in fact identify a policy of\n\nthe Lee County Jail in the formal grievance he submitted to Captain Ellegood. The\n\ngrievance cited the “Inmate Rules and Regulations” as providing two showers a\n\nweek for those inmates in disciplinary confinement and daily showers for all other\n\ninmates. But the claim Fischer made in his formal grievance and in his § 1983\n\ncomplaint (and that he makes again before us) is not that this policy was\n\nconstitutionally deficient, but that individual agents of the Lee County Jail violated\n\nit. We will take up this particular alleged policy violation when we examine the\n\nrelevant Eighth Amendment claim against the defendants in their individual\n\ncapacities, but for present purposes there is no question that Fischer has failed to\n\npresent evidence of any Lee County policy or custom that “played a part” in the\n\ndeprivation of his rights. In other words, he has shown no evidence that the county\n\n\n                                           6\n\fitself (as opposed to individual officers) violated his rights.\n\n                                           B.\n\n      Second, we address Fischer’s Eighth Amendment excessive-force claim,\n\nwhich is based on the pepper spray incident. In granting summary judgment on\n\nthis claim, the district court cited the absence of evidence “that the . . . spray was\n\nused for any other purpose . . . than to restore order,” or that Fischer incurred any\n\ninjury from the spray. Fischer does not mention the injury issue in his brief, but\n\ninstead says that he has presented evidence in the form of his sworn complaint that\n\nthe spraying was “wanton and deliberate and not necessary as no situation or threat\n\nof safety ever existed.” This, he says, means that summary judgment was\n\nimproper.\n\n       To establish a claim for excessive force in violation of the Eighth\n\nAmendment, a plaintiff must show (1) that the force was “sadistically and\n\nmaliciously applied for the very purpose of causing harm,” Johnson v. Breeden,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75710\"><a href=\"/opinion/75710/ernest-d-johnson-v-brian-breeden/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1308</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1321 (11th Cir. 2002), and (2) that more than a de minimis injury\n\nresulted. See id.\n\n      Even assuming that Fischer presented sufficient evidence of an injury\n\n(which we doubt), summary judgment is due to be affirmed on the excessive force\n\nclaim because nothing in the record suggests the officers used the pepper spray\n\n                                            7\n\fwith the malicious intention of causing harm to Fischer. In support of their\n\nsummary judgment motions, the defendants produced two “OC Spray Compliance\n\nForms” and the affidavit of Sergeant Lafayette, all of which indicated that officers\n\nsprayed inmates Delamos and Armstrong for refusing to follow orders to face the\n\nwall during the shakedown. Given this evidence, the burden shifted to Fischer to\n\npresent “evidence on which the jury could reasonably find for [him],” Anderson v.\n\nLiberty Lobby, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 252, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111719\"><a href=\"/opinion/111719/anderson-v-liberty-lobby/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2505</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2512 (1986), on the issue\n\nof the defendants’ subjective intentions when they sprayed the inmates.\n\n       Fischer did not carry this burden. In his sworn complaint, Fischer baldly\n\nasserted that the officers sprayed him and the others as part of a “shakedown” that\n\nwas in retaliation for his written grievance of April 26, 2003. He also baldly\n\nasserted that the spraying was “unwarranted and cannot be justified therefore being\n\nclassified as an Improper and Excessive Use of Force.” Neither of these statements\n\namount to evidence of what the defendants intended. The same is true for mere\n\npromises of “affidavits and live testimony” (as Fischer made in his response to the\n\ndefendants’ motions for summary judgment) or “eight witnesses” (as he made in\n\nhis brief here).\n\n       The only sworn statement Fischer has provided in the course of this\n\nlitigation approaching relevance to the “malicious and sadistic” standard is the\n\n\n                                          8\n\fsingle sentence in his complaint that: “During this shakedown Sergeant Lafayette\n\ninstructed the Officers to ‘make sure they get something in their face’ . . . .” The\n\nproblem, however, is that this statement doesn’t actually bear on whether Lafayette\n\nor the “Officers” “sadistically and maliciously applied [the spray] for the very\n\npurpose of causing harm.” Johnson, 280 F.3d at 1321. It certainly does not shed\n\nlight on any of the five factors we use to determine whether force was used\n\n“sadistically and maliciously”: “(1) the extent of injury; (2) the need for\n\napplication of force; (3) the relationship between that need and the amount of force\n\nused; (4) any efforts made to temper the severity of a forceful response; and (5) the\n\nextent of the threat to the safety of staff and inmates, as reasonably perceived by\n\nthe responsible officials on the basis of facts known to them.” Campbell v. Sikes,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1353</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1375 (11th Cir. 1999) (quotations and citations omitted). Summary\n\njudgment was therefore appropriate on Fischer’s excessive force claim.\n\n                                                C.\n\n       The third issue we consider also involves an Eighth Amendment claim, but\n\nthis one deals with the overcrowded and unsanitary conditions Fischer allegedly\n\nendured during the lockdown.2 The district court concluded that the conditions\n\n       2\n          Fischer’s Eighth Amendment claim may in actuality be a Fourteenth Amendment\nclaim: If he was a pre-trial detainee during the relevant events (as opposed to a convict serving a\nprison sentence), Fischer was protected not by the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and\nunusual punishment, but by the Fourteenth Amendment’s right to due process. See Hamm v.\n\n                                                 9\n\fFischer experienced were not “so extreme as to have posed an ‘unreasonable risk\n\nof serious damage’ to [Fischer’s] health or safety.” On appeal, Fischer argues that\n\na genuine issue exists as to this material fact in light of his interrogatory responses\n\nand the formal grievance he attached to his complaint.\n\n       To establish an Eighth Amendment claim based on prison conditions, an\n\ninmate must meet both an objective component, which requires that the conditions\n\nbe “sufficiently serious,” and a subjective component, which requires that the\n\nofficials acted with “deliberate indifference to prisoner health or safety.” Jordan v.\n\nDoe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681325\"><a href=\"/opinion/681325/robert-allen-jordan-v-john-doe-chief-us-marshal-david-adkins-lydia/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1564 (11th Cir. 1994) (quotation marks omitted).

See 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a) (“No action shall be brought with respect to\n\n\nDeKalb County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"459883\"><a href=\"/opinion/459883/george-hamm-v-dekalb-county-and-pat-jarvis-sheriff/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1567</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1572 (11th Cir. 1985). We are unsure of Fischer’s status during\nthe events at issue in this case, but that uncertainty is of no consequence. The “minimum\nstandard” of ensuring inmates with the “basic necessities” is the same regardless of the\nconstitutional provision.

Filed on the fifth day of the lockdown, the grievance mentioned\n\nthese four conditions: (1) “Some cells had as low as four inmates in them while\n\nother cells had as many as seven;” (2) “inmates were not only forced to sleep on\n\nbare cement floors but also on other inmates mattresses and linen” (which had not\n\nbeen washed after others’ use of those linens); (3) the inmates were deprived of\n\ntheir daily showers; and (4) the inmates’ laundry had not been done. Fischer does\n\nnot mention the laundry issue in his brief, so we deem any claim as to it\n\nabandoned. See Greenbriar, Ltd. v. City of Alabaster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527572\"><a href=\"/opinion/527572/greenbriar-ltd-and-mary-roensch-cross-appellants-v-city-of-alabaster/\"><span class=\"volume\">881</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1573 n.6\n\n(11th Cir. 1989).\n\n      When viewed through the applicable procedural filters, it is clear that even a\n\nliberal reading of Fischer’s sworn statements reveals no constitutional violation as\n\nto the three conditions we have before us (the overcrowding, sleeping, and shower\n\nconditions). For example, undisputed evidence shows that each jail cell could hold\n\nat least four inmates, meaning that the affected cells were never even at double\n\ncapacity during the lockdown. Even double capacity, the Supreme Court has held,\n\ndoes not violate the constitution absent “deprivations of essential food, medical\n\ncare, or sanitation.” Rhodes v.

Furthermore, Fischer has given us no reason to believe that sleeping\n\non the floor or on unwashed bed linens or being denied showers amounts to either\n\na deprivation of “essential . . . sanitation” (which would be relevant as to Fischer’s\n\novercrowding claim) or an Eighth Amendment violation in their own right—at\n\nleast not when the duration is only five days. See, e.g., Hamilton v.

In other words, we agree with the district court\n\nthat Fischer failed to provide evidence of conditions that were sufficiently\n\n“extreme” as to “pose[] an unreasonable risk of serious damage to his future health\n\nor safety.” Chandler v. Crosby, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76715\"><a href=\"/opinion/76715/jim-e-chandler-v-james-crosby/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1278</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1289 (11th Cir. 2004). Summary\n\njudgment on Fischer’s conditions-of-confinement claim was therefore appropriate.\n\n                                           D.\n\n      Next, we consider Fischer’s claim of “racial discrimination” stemming from\n\nthe racial segregation of inmates during the lockdown. The district court construed\n\nthis claim as an equal protection claim under the Fourteenth Amendment, applied\n\nstrict scrutiny, and found that the segregation was narrowly tailored to serve the\n\ncompelling interest of jail safety and security. In his brief, Fischer argues that the\n\n\n                                           12\n\fthreat of violence justifying the lockdown was not racial in nature, and that as a\n\nresult the racial segregation did not actually separate the alleged aggressor inmates\n\nfrom those who complained of the threats.\n\n      We view Fischer’s “racial discrimination” claim as an equal protection claim\n\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus apply strict scrutiny. See Johnson v.\n\nCalifornia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1147 (2005) (holding that strict\n\nscrutiny is the appropriate standard of review for racial classifications even in the\n\nprison context). “Under strict scrutiny, the government has the burden of proving\n\nthat racial classifications are narrowly tailored measures that further compelling\n\ngovernmental interests.” Id. at 505, 125 S. Ct. at 1146 (quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Here, the defendants met their burden of showing that the racial segregation\n\nserved a “compelling governmental interest” by presenting the affidavit of\n\nSergeant Reis, in which he explained that he ordered the racial separation after\n\nreceiving an inmate’s complaint that the white inmates in Fischer’s cell block\n\nfeared violence from the black inmates in that block. Fischer has maintained\n\nthroughout this litigation that no threat of racial violence ever existed. But even if\n\nFischer is correct about that, he has not refuted Sergeant Reis’ explanation of what\n\nmotivated the decision to segregate. The reason was prison safety (even if\n\nSergeant Reis was mistaken about the true nature of the threat), and prison safety is\n\n\n                                          13\n\fclearly a “compelling interest” under Supreme Court precedent. See id. at 514, 125\n\nS. Ct. at 1151.\n\n      Likewise, the defendants met their burden of showing that the racial\n\nsegregation was narrowly tailored to neutralize the threat of racial violence.\n\nAlthough the defendants presented a log entry and the affidavits of two officers\n\nshowing that the segregation lasted from April 23 to April 27, the sworn statement\n\nin Fischer’s complaint that it lasted two weeks creates a genuine issue of fact as to\n\nthe segregation’s duration. The problem for Fischer is that this factual issue,\n\nthough genuine, is not material. Indeed, the defendants also submitted the affidavit\n\nof Captain Ellegood, in which he explained that one of the Jail’s classification\n\nsupervisors conducted a thorough investigation during the lockdown, and that the\n\nsegregation ceased “immediately” after she determined that the racial threat no\n\nlonger existed. Fischer, on the other hand, has pointed to no evidence suggesting\n\nthat the segregation continued after Jail officials thought the threat of racial\n\nviolence had passed. He thus has not identified a genuine issue on the material\n\nquestion of whether the segregation was narrowly tailored to secure the safety of\n\ninmates and employees at the Jail.\n\n                                           E.\n\n      Finally, we examine Fischer’s contention that the district court violated his\n\n                                           14\n\fSixth Amendment rights by failing to grant his request for appointed counsel. This\n\ncontention has no merit. Notwithstanding Fischer’s suggestion to the contrary, a\n\nplaintiff has no constitutional right to appointed counsel in a civil case. Bass, 170\n\nF.3d at 1320. Rather, a district court has broad discretion in deciding whether to\n\nappoint counsel, and should do so “only in exceptional circumstances.” Id.\n\nFischer stresses that he is inexperienced in the law, but as we have held before the\n\nmere fact that a lawyer’s assistance would be helpful does not amount to an\n\n“exceptional circumstance” where, as here, the core facts of the case are pretty\n\nmuch undisputed and the legal claims are straightforward. See id. The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Fischer’s motion for appointed\n\ncounsel.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\f</pre>",
