Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we affirm Mr. Clark’s\n\nconviction.\n\n                      I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      This case arises from a classic pump-and-dump scheme that was\n\norchestrated principally by Mr. Clark’s co-defendant, George David Gordon. In a\n\nseparate opinion, we recently affirmed Mr. Gordon’s convictions and sentence.\n\nSee United States v. Gordon, 710 F.3d 1124 (10th Cir. 2013). In doing so, we set\n\nforth in considerable detail the relevant factual and procedural background related\n\nto the government’s prosecution of the pump-and-dump scheme. See id. at\n\n1128–33. Consequently, we will not fully reiterate that discussion here. Instead,\n\nwe offer at the outset a factual and procedural overview, and then in connection\n\nwith the resolution of Mr. Clark’s specific legal challenges, we explicate\n\nnecessary additional facts. 1\n\n\n      1\n             In Gordon, we quoted in part the indictment’s description of the\ngeneral nature of a pump-and-dump scheme, 710 F.3d at 1128 n.2; it is also useful\nto do so here:\n\n              A pump and dump scheme involves the artificial manipulation of\n              the price and volume of a particular stock in order to later sell\n              that stock at an artificially inflated price. Generally, the\n              perpetrators of a pump and dump scheme obtain control over a\n              substantial portion of free trading shares of the company. Free\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      In summary, the government alleged that Messrs. Gordon and Clark and\n\nother co-conspirators manipulated the shares of several “penny-stock” companies\n\nby using false and backdated documents to make those shares publicly tradeable,\n\nengaged in coordinated trading among themselves to create the false appearance\n\nof an active market for the shares, and promoted the shares through misleading\n\npromotional campaigns. See, e.g., id. at 1128 & n.2. The shares were sold to\n\n      1\n          (...continued)\n                trading shares are shares of stock that the owner can trade\n                without restriction on a national exchange, e.g., the New York\n                Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, or are traded in the over-the-\n                counter market via the Pink Sheets. To obtain the free trading\n                shares, the perpetrators may orchestrate a reverse merger, which\n                occurs when a privately held company with no publicly traded\n                stock merges with a publicly listed shell company that has no\n                assets or revenue but has stock available for public trading,\n                resulting in a public company. The pump usually involves\n                artificially inflating a company’s stock price by engaging in\n                coordinated trading of the stock in order to create the appearance\n                of a more active market for that stock. The pump also usually\n                involves disseminating false and misleading promotional\n                materials—unsolicited advertisements touting a particular stock\n                and encouraging others to purchase the stock, which are often\n                sent to millions of recipients by fax or email “blasts.” After\n                pumping the stock, the perpetrators dump their shares, meaning\n                they sell large volumes of the shares that they own and control to\n                unsuspecting investors. The dumping often occurs soon after the\n                dissemination of the promotional materials touting the particular\n                company. The perpetrators of a pump and dump scheme will\n                often “park” their shares by depositing or transferring them into\n                different accounts, including nominees’ accounts, and then trade\n                the manipulated stock using the different accounts in order to\n                conceal their trading activity.\n\n\nR., Vol. I, at 55–56 (Indictment, filed Jan. 15, 2009).\n\n                                            -3-\n\funsuspecting buyers after their prices had surged, and the conspirators laundered\n\nthe proceeds through an array of bank accounts and nominees. The conspirators\n\nsubsequently covered up their misconduct in interactions with the Securities and\n\nExchange Commission (“SEC”).\n\nA.    Investigation and Pretrial Proceedings\n\n      The conduct in this case can be traced back to 2004 when Mr. Gordon\n\nbegan dealing with Mark Lindberg and Joshua Lankford, two Dallas stock\n\npromoters—both co-conspirators—and collaboratively targeting with them\n\nvarious companies for the fraudulent scheme’s purposes. Through a sequence of\n\ntransactions, the conspirators established and fraudulently promoted the stock of\n\nthree companies: National Storm Management (“National Storm”), Deep Rock Oil\n\n& Gas (“Deep Rock”), and Global Beverage Company (“Global Beverage”). See\n\nid. at 1129–32.\n\n      In 2004, SEC official Samuel Draddy began looking into an unrelated Pink\n\nSheet 2 company that had “unusual trading surrounding its stock and appeared to\n\nbe the subject of a promotional campaign.” R., Vol. VIII, at 1753 (Test. of\n\nSamuel Draddy, dated Apr. 15, 2010). This led to further investigation of other\n\n\n      2\n             “The Pink Sheets are a daily publication of the National Quotation\nBureau (NQB), a private company. Printed on pink paper, the pink sheets list\npenny stocks, their marketmakers, and their price.” United States v. Sneed, 34\nF.3d 1570, 1575 n.7 (10th Cir. 1994); see also Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1130\n(describing the Pink Sheet system and noting that Pink Sheet companies are “not\nrequired to file periodic reports with the SEC”).\n\n                                        -4-\n\f“similarly-situated [stock] issuers” with unusual trading patterns and promotional\n\ncampaigns. Id.\n\n      After taking a deeper look, investigators noticed that the companies under\n\nconsideration evinced similar patterns where “the people involved owned shells,\n\n[that] were publicly-traded issuers that had no legitimate business purpose, . . .\n\n[and] [t]hey would . . . get private companies to reverse-merge into these shells so\n\nthey could get publicly traded.” Id. at 1754; see also id., Vol. I, at 55 (noting in\n\nthe instant indictment that “[t]o obtain the free trading shares, the perpetrators\n\nmay orchestrate a reverse merger, which occurs when a privately held company\n\nwith no publicly traded stock merges with a publicly listed shell company that has\n\nno assets or revenue but has stock available for public trading, resulting in a\n\npublic company”). Based on this discovery, the investigators turned their\n\nattention to the activities of the companies involved in this case. During that\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Clark testified before the SEC. He made various statements,\n\nincluding an allegedly false denial that he controlled nominee entities involved in\n\nthe Deep Rock trading scheme.\n\n      In July 2007, approximately eighteen months prior to the commencement of\n\ncriminal proceedings against Mr. Clark, the government placed a caveat on his\n\nresidence. See generally Black’s Law Dictionary 252 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\n\n“caveat” as “[a] warning or proviso”). No notice was given to Mr. Clark at that\n\ntime, and he was not aware of the caveat until July 2008 “when he was attempting\n\n                                          -5-\n\fto obtain funds to retain counsel.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 2. The government\n\ntemporarily lifted the caveat in June 2009 to allow Mr. Clark to renew an existing\n\nloan on his home, and reimposed it in July 2009. The government then\n\ncompletely lifted the caveat in October 2009.\n\n      On January 15, 2009, the grand jury returned a twenty-four-count\n\nindictment against the members of the conspiracy, including Mr. Clark. Mr.\n\nClark was named in Counts 1–21: specifically, conspiracy (Count 1), in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 371; wire fraud (Counts 2–10), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343\n\nand 2(a); securities fraud (Counts 11–15), in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b),\n\n78ff, 17 C.F.R. § 2401.10b-5, and 18 U.S.C. § 2(a); and money laundering\n\n(Counts 16–21), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1957(a) and 2(a).\n\nB.    Trial\n\n      At trial, 3 the government called witnesses to summarize the details of the\n\nconspiracy, including Mr. Lindberg and Richard Singer (another co-conspirator);\n\nboth men had pleaded guilty to criminal offenses related to the conspiracy. SEC\n\nInvestigator Draddy testified about the promotional campaigns and Mr. Clark’s\n\ntestimony before the SEC. Other witnesses were called to summarize\n\n\n\n      3\n              The district court ordered a continuance under the Speedy Trial Act\nand set the trial date for January 19, 2010. The presiding judge later recused\nhimself in late 2009, and Judge James Payne was assigned to the case. Judge\nPayne then reset the trial date to March 29, 2010. The trial ultimately began on\nApril 5, 2010.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fdocumentary evidence. Mr. Clark unsuccessfully moved to sever his trial from\n\nMr. Gordon’s due to the alleged potential for a prejudicial spillover of evidence\n\nthat was admitted concerning both Mr. Gordon and the other co-conspirators. Mr.\n\nClark ultimately was convicted of fourteen of the twenty-one counts for which he\n\nwas indicted. He was sentenced to 151 months’ imprisonment. 4\n\n                                   II. Discussion\n\n      Mr. Clark asserts numerous grounds of error. He claims that the pretrial\n\nplacement of the caveat on his property violated his constitutional rights and that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to convict him. He further contests the district\n\ncourt’s refusal to appoint an additional or a substitute defense counsel who was\n\nwell versed in complex securities matters and the court’s failure to sever his trial\n\nfrom Mr. Gordon’s. He also contends that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act\n\nwere violated by the roughly fourteen-month delay between the filing of the\n\nindictment and commencement of trial. We address each contention but discern\n\n\n      4\n             The government seeks to supplement the record under seal with\nmultiple sentencing documents that are not included in the parties’ appendices.\nMost of these documents are interim versions of Mr. Gordon’s pre-sentence\ninvestigation report and the district court’s Statement of Reasons for imposing\nsentence in his case. One document in particular relates to Mr. Clark’s appeal: an\naddendum to his pre-sentence report. We already have resolved the motion as it\npertains to Mr. Gordon’s case, granting it in part. See Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1160\nn.35. Mr. Clark does not object to supplementing the record with his pre-sentence\naddendum. With this in mind, we grant in part the motion with respect to the\naddendum. The rest of the motion does not directly implicate Mr. Clark or our\nresolution of his appeal and, therefore, we deny the remainder of the motion as\nmoot.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fno reversible error.\n\nA.    Constitutional Challenges Arising from the Government’s Caveat\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that “[t]he government violated [his] constitutional rights\n\nto due process and a fair trial” in its pre-indictment decision to place a caveat on\n\nhis home, without notice. Aplt. Opening Br. at 6. By the time the government\n\nlifted the caveat on Mr. Clark’s home, he claims that he had no income because of\n\nthe government’s other post-indictment restrictions on his business\n\nactivities—viz., restrictions concerning his ability to liquidate various stock\n\nholdings. Therefore, Mr. Clark allegedly was unable to pay for chosen counsel\n\nand unable to secure a loan against his house for the same purpose. 5\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that the government acted wrongfully in imposing the\n\ncaveat on his house. He reasons that his house was not forfeitable property. 6 As\n\n      5\n             Mr. Clark contends that the October 2009 release of the caveat was\ndone “with the express condition that no new funds could be advanced on the\nhome.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 6. The government counters that Mr. Clark is\n“wrong” and that the condition of which he speaks applied to the earlier,\ntemporary release in June 2009, not the release in October 2009, which was\nunconditional. See Aplee. Br. at 46. The government’s position is supported by\nthe record (indeed, by a motion filed by Mr. Clark’s attorneys in the district\ncourt). See R., Vol. I, 178 (Am. Mot. & Br. to Withdraw as Counsel, filed Nov.\n18, 2009) (“On October 2, 2009, the Government lifted the caveat on Mr. Clark’s\nhome.”).\n      6\n              “The key to whether property is forfeitable is whether it is ‘involved\nin’ or ‘traceable to’ the offense.” United States v. Bornfield, 145 F.3d 1123, 1135\n(10th Cir. 1998) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1)). Mr. Clark contends that, at\nmost, his house was “substitute property” that was off-limits to the government\nunless and until he was convicted, citing our decision in United States v. Jarvis,\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         -8-\n\fa consequence, once the caveat was imposed, he contends, the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment, as interpreted in our decision in United States v.\n\nJones, 160 F.3d 641 (10th Cir. 1998), required a post-restraint, pretrial hearing on\n\nwhether the house was in fact forfeitable property—a hearing that Mr. Clark says\n\nhe was wrongfully denied.\n\n\n\n      6\n       (...continued)\n499 F.3d 1196 (10th Cir. 2007). In resolving Mr. Gordon’s appeal, we had\noccasion to explicate the concept of substitute property and the contours of\nJarvis’s holding regarding it. We stated:\n\n             [I]n order for the government to forfeit substitute property, it\n             must establish that through “any act or omission of the\n             defendant” one of five things has occurred—for example,\n             forfeitable property cannot be located through the exercise of due\n             diligence, or such property has been placed beyond the\n             jurisdiction of the court. 21 U.S.C. § 853(p)(1). Furthermore,\n             we reasoned in Jarvis that because the government has no pre-\n             conviction interest in substitute property, it may not impose pre-\n             trial restraints on a defendant’s substitute property.\n\n\nGordon, 710 F.3d at 1136 n.14. In contrast, as we further noted in Gordon:\n\n             Assets that are properly forfeitable are not the defendant’s\n             rightful property. As ill-gotten gains, they are another person’s\n             money. Indeed, these assets may belong to the government by\n             virtue of the relation-back provision of 21 U.S.C. § 853(c), which\n             by operation of law vests title to forfeitable property in the\n             government upon the commission of the act giving rise to\n             forfeiture.\n\n\nId. at 1135 n.13 (quoting Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491\nU.S. 617, 625–26 (1989), and Jarvis, 499 F.3d at 1203) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n                                         -9-\n\f      “We review de novo the extent of constitutional rights . . . .” Jones, 160\n\nF.3d at 645; see United States v. Rivas-Macias, 537 F.3d 1271, 1276 (10th Cir.\n\n2008). However, when a defendant does not properly raise a challenge in the\n\ndistrict court, and “there is no suggestion of a knowing, voluntary failure to raise\n\nthe [claim],” it is forfeited and our “rigorous plain-error standard governs our\n\nreview.” United States v. Cooper, 654 F.3d 1104, 1117 (10th Cir. 2011). Under\n\nthis rigorous standard, a defendant must demonstrate: “(1) an error, (2) that is\n\nplain, which means clear or obvious under current law, and (3) that affects\n\nsubstantial rights. If he satisfies these criteria, this Court may exercise discretion\n\nto correct the error if [4] it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.” Id. (alteration in original) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Goode, 483 F.3d 676, 681 (10th Cir. 2007)) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n      Jones was decided in the post-indictment, pretrial context. See 160 F.3d at\n\n645 (“[W]e next address whether due process nevertheless requires a pre-trial\n\nhearing at which defendants may challenge the grand jury’s findings.”). There,\n\nwe concluded that “[t]he procedural aspect of the Fifth Amendment Due Process\n\nClause,” id., provides a defendant with some ability to “test the [government’s]\n\nforfeiture allegations,” id. at 646. Pertinently, we reasoned that the “private\n\ninterests” at stake when access to property is impeded—specifically, the Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel of choice and the payment of living\n\n                                          -10-\n\fexpenses—together with the “risk of an erroneous deprivation through [pretrial\n\nrestraint procedures,]” weighed in favor of a post-restraint, pretrial adversarial\n\nhearing “at which the government must establish probable cause to believe that\n\nthe restrained assets are traceable to the underlying offense.” Id. at 646–47.\n\n      We noted, however, that “[d]ue process does not automatically require”\n\nsuch a hearing. Id. at 647. A hearing should be held “only upon a properly\n\nsupported motion by a defendant,” wherein he must (1) “demonstrate to the\n\ncourt’s satisfaction that []he has no assets, other than those restrained, with which\n\nto retain private counsel and provide for [him]self and [his] family”; and (2)\n\n“make a prima facie showing of a bona fide reason to believe the grand jury erred\n\nin determining that the restrained assets” are forfeitable property. Id.; see also\n\nUnited States v. Kaley, 579 F.3d 1246, 1254–55 (11th Cir. 2009) (conducting a\n\nsimilar inquiry).\n\n      In this case, the government imposed a caveat under Oklahoma law on Mr.\n\nClark’s house roughly eighteen months prior to his indictment, but Mr. Clark was\n\nnever provided notice or a subsequent hearing. We assume without deciding that\n\nan Oklahoma caveat constitutes a pretrial restraint of assets sufficient to trigger a\n\ndefendant’s procedural due process rights under Jones. 7 Cf. Jarvis, 499 F.3d at\n\n\n      7\n              To be sure, it is not clear that common law, public impediments like\ncaveats (or lis pendens) are functionally equivalent to the type of restraints\ntriggering our inquiry in Jones. For instance, in Jones, the government obtained a\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         -11-\n\f1198–1200 (implying that a New Mexico lis pendens may constitute a\n\n“restraint”). However, even if it does, Mr. Clark faces a formidable—and,\n\nultimately, insurmountable—obstacle in pursuing this claim: Mr. Clark did not\n\nproperly seek a hearing prior to trial to vindicate his interests related to the\n\nimposition of the caveat, much less make an adequate showing for a hearing\n\nunder Jones’s standards. 8\n\n      7\n        (...continued)\nrestraining order under 21 U.S.C. § 853(e)(1)(A) to freeze assets named in the\nindictment. See 160 F.3d at 643. Furthermore, on a continuum of constraints,\ncommon law impediments—like a lis pendens or caveat—plainly do not amount\nto a full scale seizure of the underlying property, where the defendant has no\nresidual control over it. Cf. United States v. James Daniel Good Real Prop., 510\nU.S. 43, 62 (1993) (holding that due process requires the government to “afford\nnotice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before seizing real property\nsubject to civil forfeiture”). However, we are content to assume without deciding\nthat the placement of the Oklahoma caveat implicates our dictates in Jones—viz.,\nthat it constitutes a “restraint” presenting the right to a post-restraint, pretrial\nhearing. But cf. Stefan D. Cassella, Asset Forfeiture Law in the United States\n§ 17-8, at 526 & n.77 (2007) (collecting cases and noting that the “[t]he filing of\na lis pendens is not a restraint within the meaning of § 853(e)”).\n      8\n              We recognize that Mr. Clark contends that he did seek a Jones\nhearing. But he did not properly do so, if at all. In his opening brief, he claims\nthat “[a] post-restraint, pretrial hearing was requested by co-defendant David\nGordon (Dkt. 79) and incorporated by reference by Clark (Dkt. 78).” Aplt.\nOpening Br. at 8. The document to which Mr. Clark refers (i.e., the district\ncourt’s document 78) is his attorneys’ first motion to withdraw, or in the\nalternative, to sever or continue the trial. See R., Vol. I, at 171 (Mot. & Br. to\nWithdraw as Counsel, filed Nov. 17, 2009). There, his attorneys complained to\nthe court that the caveat on Mr. Clark’s home was “a proximate cause of Mr.\nClark’s inability to raise sufficient funds for his defense in this case.” Id. While\nthe motion noted that the government imposed the caveat without notice, see id.,\nnowhere in the document was a hearing requested, and it certainly did not make\nthe showing for a hearing mandated by Jones. As for the purported incorporation\n                                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                          -12-\n\f      8\n         (...continued)\nby reference, this document does not even reference Mr. Gordon’s hearing\nrequest. The incorporation by reference that Mr. Clark presumably seeks to direct\nus to is actually found on the third page of his amended motion to withdraw, or in\nthe alternative, to sever or continue the trial. Specifically, the motion states, “The\nGovernment’s heavy hand in the imposition of caveats is not restricted to its\nactions in respect of Mr. Clark. See motion of co-defendant David Gordon filed\nin this case November 17, 2009.” Id. at 179 (Am. Mot. & Br. to Withdraw as\nCounsel, filed Nov. 18, 2009). That is it. Nothing more. And Mr. Clark’s\ncounsel confirmed in oral argument that this is the extent of his purported\nincorporation by reference. See Oral Arg. at 21:15–22:35. However, in the\ndocument that Mr. Clark references, Mr. Gordon sought at least three forms of\nrelief, including an evidentiary hearing before the district court, citing Jones as\nsupportive authority. See R., Vol. X, at 29–31 (Def. David Gordon’s Mot. to\nDismiss, filed Nov. 17, 2009). Mr. Clark’s single, vague, and enigmatic sentence\nreferencing the whole document should not be deemed sufficient to have captured\nMr. Gordon’s specific Jones argument and placed it before the district court.\nIndeed, the sentence does not even amount to a bare-bones “me too” form of\nargument adoption (which would be questionable in itself here because it would\nnot offer a particularized showing regarding Mr. Clark’s circumstances). More\nspecifically, the sentence does not even mention a hearing request, or for that\nmatter any other specifics that might be found in Mr. Gordon’s filing.\n\n       Significantly, our independent examination of the district court’s\ndocuments suggests that the magistrate judge remarkably did manage to divine in\nMr. Clark’s filings a request for an evidentiary hearing “apparently to examine\nthe Government’s conduct in this and other cases relating to pretrial restraints on\na criminal defendant’s assets,” id, Vol. I, at 347 (Order, dated Dec. 9, 2009), and\ndenied relief. However, Mr. Clark is not well-postured on appeal to avail himself\nof the benefits of the magistrate judge’s impressive industriousness. Not only\ndoes Mr. Clark not discuss the magistrate judge’s order in connection with his due\nprocess/Jones challenge, he also fails (in his opening brief or otherwise) to\nfashion an argument for why this challenge should be deemed preserved for\nreview, based upon the magistrate judge’s decision to rule on his purported\nhearing request. And we certainly will not attempt to craft an argument of this\nsort for him. Accordingly, any such preservation argument is waived. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Bader, 678 F.3d 858, 894 (10th Cir. 2012) (noting that defendant\n“devotes only a single sentence to [his] argument” in his opening brief and “[t]hat\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                        -13-\n\f      Consequently, for this reason (and possibly another, see supra note 8), Mr.\n\nClark may have waived his due process challenge. Cf. Sandoval v. City of\n\nBoulder, 388 F.3d 1312, 1329 (10th Cir. 2004) (“Sandoval has waived any\n\nargument that she was denied due process by failing to request the hearing to\n\nwhich she now claims she was entitled.”); cf. also Kaley, 579 F.3d at 1261 n.5\n\n(Tjoflat, J., specially concurring) (discussing a prior Eleventh Circuit decision in\n\nwhich the “defendants had waived their challenge to the constitutionality of . . .\n\nex parte restraints [on property] by not presenting it to the district court”).\n\nHowever, going to great lengths to ensure that Mr. Clark receives his full day in\n\n\n      8\n        (...continued)\nis not enough”). Furthermore, even if Mr. Clark had referenced the magistrate\njudge’s order and attempted before us to make a preservation argument based\nupon it with respect to his due process/Jones challenge, he would have another\nproblem: he did not file an objection to the magistrate judge’s denial of his\npurported request for a hearing. See R., Vol. I, at 348–51 (Objection to\nMagistrate’s Order, dated Dec. 15, 2009) (failing to address the hearing ruling).\nTherefore, under our firm waiver rule, appellate review of the hearing denial\nwould be barred. See, e.g., Morales-Fernandez v. INS, 418 F.3d 1116, 1119 (10th\nCir. 2005); In re Carpenter, 205 F.3d 1249, 1253 (10th Cir. 2000). When all is\nsaid and done, then, the best that Mr. Clark could ever hope for is plain-error\nreview of his due process claim—that is, his claim predicated on the district\ncourt’s purported failure to give him the opportunity to have a Jones hearing\nregarding the government’s imposition of a caveat. Going to great lengths to\nensure that, to the extent reasonably feasible and consistent with the adversary\nprocess, Mr. Clark has his day in court, as noted infra, we afford him this best-\ncase, plain-error scenario. Cf. Abernathy v. Wandes, 713 F.3d 538, 552 (10th Cir.\n2013) (noting that “the decision regarding what issues are appropriate to entertain\non appeal in instances of lack of preservation is discretionary” and proceeding to\nconsider petitioner’s argument “even though [it was] not obliged to do so” where\n“certain factors militate[d] in favor of considering [the argument at issue], but\nonly under the demanding plain-error standard”).\n\n                                          -14-\n\fcourt, we assume that Mr. Clark’s failure to properly seek a post-restraint, pretrial\n\nhearing under Jones amounted to a forfeiture. Even affording him this best-case\n\nscenario, Mr. Clark’s circumstances are rather grim: in order to prevail, he must\n\n“successfully run the gauntlet created by our rigorous plain-error standard of\n\nreview.” United States v. McGehee, 672 F.3d 860, 876 (10th Cir. 2012). This he\n\ncannot do. Mr. Clark cannot even establish the first prong of the plain-error test;\n\nin other words, he cannot demonstrate that the district court committed error at\n\nall.\n\n         Mr. Clark learned about the caveat in July 2008—a year after it had been\n\nimposed and six months prior to his indictment. But he never properly asked the\n\ndistrict court for a post-restraint hearing regarding the caveat under our decision\n\nin Jones. That is, he never filed the motion that Jones requires, never properly\n\nalerted the district court to his desire for a Jones hearing, and nowhere sought to\n\ndemonstrate that he could satisfy the test that Jones sets forth. Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court had no reason to conclude that Mr. Clark’s interests were in\n\njeopardy and required protection through a hearing. See Jones, 160 F.3d at 647\n\n(“[A] post-restraint, pretrial hearing [is required] only upon a properly supported\n\nmotion by a defendant. Due process does not automatically require a hearing\n\n. . . .”).\n\n         The procedures required by our decision in Jones are in place to protect a\n\ndefendant from an intrusion upon his property interest without due process. See\n\n                                          -15-\n\fid. at 645–46 (“[A] restraining order issued under section 853(e)(1)(A) deprives\n\none of property even though the assets named in the indictment are only frozen\n\nand may eventually be returned.”); cf. 21 U.S.C. § 853(e)(1). A defendant cannot\n\nsuccessfully establish that a district court’s decision deprived him of the\n\naffirmative protections inherent in a Jones hearing when the defendant has not\n\nproperly alerted the court to the need for such a hearing. Cf. Kirkland v. St. Vrain\n\nValley Sch. Dist. No. Re-1J, 464 F.3d 1182, 1195 (10th Cir. 2006) (“Although\n\n[the plaintiff] could have immediately filed a grievance challenging his\n\nsuspension, he chose not to do so. In light of that, he cannot now allege that the\n\nindividual Defendants deprived him of post-suspension due process.”); Luellen v.\n\nCity of E. Chicago, 350 F.3d 604, 616 (7th Cir. 2003) (noting that because “[the\n\nlitigant] was provided with the opportunity for additional procedures to vindicate\n\nhis rights but did not avail himself of those opportunities, . . . the requirements of\n\ndue process were satisfied”). Accordingly, we conclude that Mr. Clark has not\n\nsatisfied the first prong of the plain-error test—viz., he has not shown that the\n\ndistrict court erred at all.\n\n       Mr. Clark suggests that he had no opportunity to lodge a challenge to the\n\ncaveat because he was not given adequate notice of its placement. However, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that Mr. Clark had notice of the caveat by July 2008, nearly\n\ntwo years before trial. Mr. Clark has not established that the government’s failure\n\nto give notice of placement of the caveat in 2007 affected his ability to vindicate\n\n                                         -16-\n\fhis interests in a timely fashion so as to facilitate retaining counsel.\n\nConsequently, we reject his due process claim—predicated upon the notion that\n\nthe district court wrongly failed to afford him a post-restraint, pretrial hearing in\n\norder to contest the caveat.\n\n      Finally, we note that Mr. Clark claims in passing that the placement of the\n\ncaveat “deprived [him] of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial,” and\n\n“violated [his] right to counsel.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 11–12. We reject these\n\narguments. First, we interpret Mr. Clark’s claim that he was denied a fair trial\n\nunder the Sixth Amendment as a duplicative pulsation of his arguments under\n\nJones. He provides nothing in his brief that would suggest that the argument\n\nsupports a separate averment of error on appeal.\n\n      Second, we also reject Mr. Clark’s claim that the government’s conduct\n\nimpermissibly infringed on his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice. Mr.\n\nClark failed to raise this claim in a legally cognizable manner before the district\n\ncourt. To be sure, in the amended motion to withdraw of Mr. Clark’s trial\n\ncounsel, counsel did suggest that the government’s conduct violated Mr. Clark’s\n\nSixth Amendment right to counsel. And, in positing a possible “solution” to the\n\ndilemma, Mr. Clark’s attorney set forth a number of hypothetical resolutions,\n\nincluding “dismissal of the charges against Mr. Clark at least for all of the\n\nreasons set forth in the David Gordon motion.” R., Vol. I, at 179.\n\n      However, the motion of Mr. Clark containing this comment was geared\n\n                                          -17-\n\fprimarily toward seeking either withdrawal of counsel because of Mr. Clark’s\n\nfailure to pay legal fees, or remedies so that Mr. Clark could obtain the necessary\n\nincome to compensate current counsel, i.e, severance or a continuance of trial.\n\nSee id. at 177 (seeking “withdraw[al],” “severance,” or “continuance”). This\n\nsingle, unadorned statement alluding to a separate, potential Sixth Amendment\n\nright-to-counsel claim could not reasonably alert the district court to such a claim,\n\nat least in the form that the claim is presented here. Indeed, both the magistrate\n\njudge (in resolving the motion) and the government (in responding) expressly\n\ndeclined to speculate on the contours of Mr. Clark’s allegations. See, e.g., id., at\n\n344 n.1 (“The Court declines to address this one-sentence unsupported suggestion\n\nthat the charges should be dismissed.”).\n\n      In sum, the district court was not afforded the “opportunity to consider the\n\nquestion.” United States v. Norman T, 129 F.3d 1099, 1106 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nConsequently, we review it only for plain error, as we did Mr. Clark’s due\n\nprocess claim. See United States v. Lamirand, 669 F.3d 1091, 1098 n. 7 (10th\n\nCir. 2012).\n\n      Under plain-error review, at the very least, Mr. Clark’s claim fails under\n\nthe third prong. In making his skeletal right-to-counsel argument, like (his co-\n\ndefendant) Mr. Gordon, Mr. Clark relies on the district court and Second Circuit\n\ndecisions in the Stein criminal case. See United States v. Stein, 541 F.3d 130 (2d\n\nCir. 2008); United States v. Stein, 435 F. Supp. 2d 330 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); see also\n\n                                         -18-\n\fGordon, 710 F.3d at 1137 (noting that Mr. Gordon “heavily relies” on Stein).\n\nSimilar to the fate of Mr. Gordon’s argument, Mr. Clark’s right-to-counsel\n\nargument fails under the third prong for two principal reasons. First, Mr. Clark\n\n“has not demonstrated that he was denied access to funds to pay for his defense in\n\nany substantial sense; certainly, he has not demonstrated a magnitude of financial\n\ndeprivation anywhere close to that experienced by the Stein defendants.” Gordon,\n\n710 F.3d at 1138.\n\n      In this regard, it is significant that the district court found $225,214.81 of\n\nequity in Mr. Clark’s house—the property subject to the government’s caveat—to\n\nbe forfeitable property because certain “payments for remodeling and the\n\nmortgage” were proceeds “traceable . . . to the conspiracy.” R., Vol. VI, at 1047\n\n(Order for Criminal Forfeiture, filed Sep. 15, 2010). That finding has support in\n\nthe record. See id., Vol. II, at 45 (Aff. of William Robert Taylor, filed June 25,\n\n2010) (stating that a “significant amount” of the proceeds of stock sales directly\n\nat issue in the case “were paid directly out of [Mr. Clark’s] brokerage account for\n\nresidence related expenses”). And it significantly undercuts any suggestion that\n\nMr. Clark’s substantial rights were affected by any district court error in\n\naddressing the government’s caveat on his home.\n\n      In particular, nothing in the Constitution “requires Congress to permit a\n\ndefendant to use assets adjudged to be forfeitable to pay . . . legal fees.” United\n\nStates v. Monsanto, 491 U.S. 600, 614 (1989); see Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U.S. at\n\n                                         -19-\n\f632 (rejecting the “claim of a Sixth Amendment right of criminal defendants to\n\nuse assets that are the Government’s—assets adjudged forfeitable . . . —to pay\n\nattorneys’ fees”). And, in his threadbare argument, Mr. Clark has not attempted\n\nto demonstrate that any remaining equity in his home—beyond the amount subject\n\nto forfeiture—would have materially assisted him in employing or paying\n\ncounsel. Accordingly, in light of the district court’s forfeiture finding regarding\n\nthe home, we would be hard-pressed to conclude that Mr. Clark satisfied the third\n\nprong of plain-error review.\n\n      Second, as in Gordon, Mr. Clark’s claim of prejudice is nigh eviscerated (if\n\nnot completely so) by his ongoing, active representation throughout his trial by\n\nthe counsel that he initially retained. See 710 F.3d at 1139 (“[U]nlike Stein, it is\n\nquite significant that Mr. Gordon’s counsel remained fully and actively engaged\n\nin the case throughout the entire trial court proceedings.”). More specifically, as\n\nwe recount in further detail infra (Part II.C), even prior to his indictment, Mr.\n\nClark retained a very experienced criminal defense attorney, Allen Smallwood,\n\nand Mr. Smallwood represented Mr. Clark throughout the trial proceedings. And,\n\neven a cursory examination of the trial transcript would reveal that Mr.\n\nSmallwood advocated for Mr. Clark “in a thorough and vigorous fashion.” Id.\n\nAccordingly, for this reason as well, Mr. Clark cannot demonstrate that any error\n\nby the district court affected his substantial rights (i.e., satisfied the third prong of\n\nplain error). In sum, for the foregoing reasons, we reject Mr. Clark’s\n\n                                          -20-\n\fconstitutional challenges that stem from the government’s imposition of a caveat\n\non his home.\n\nB.    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n      Mr. Clark challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on all of his counts of\n\nconviction. Mr. Clark was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire\n\nfraud, securities fraud, and money laundering; seven counts of wire fraud; five\n\ncounts of securities fraud; and one count of money laundering. The district court\n\ndenied Mr. Clark’s motion for judgment of acquittal. We conclude that Mr.\n\nClark’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges are without merit.\n\n      “In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence and denial of a motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal, this court reviews the record de novo to determine whether,\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, any rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.” United States v. Irvin, 682 F.3d 1254, 1266 (10th Cir. 2012).\n\nThe court may “not weigh conflicting evidence” in its review. Id. (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Evans, 318 F.3d 1011, 1018 (10th Cir. 2003)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). We must “consider[] the entire record, including both direct and\n\ncircumstantial evidence, together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn from\n\nit.” United States v. Mendez, 514 F.3d 1035, 1041 (10th Cir. 2008).\n\n      1.       Conspiracy\n\n      Mr. Clark first asserts that the government failed to establish that he was\n\n                                       -21-\n\finvolved in “an agreement to commit an unlawful act,” as required to support the\n\nconspiracy charge. See, e.g., United States v. Weidner, 437 F.3d 1023, 1033 (10th\n\nCir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Morehead, 959 F.2d 1489, 1500 (10th Cir.\n\n1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      The evidence need not show an express agreement to support a conspiracy\n\ncharge. See Cooper, 654 F.3d at 1115–16. “[T]he agreement requirement may be\n\nsatisfied entirely through circumstantial evidence,” id. at 1116; that is, it “may be\n\ninferred from the facts and circumstances of the case,” id. at 1115–16 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Sells, 477 F.3d 1226, 1236 (10th Cir. 2007)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). Such facts and circumstances include “the joint appearance of\n\ndefendants at transactions and negotiations furthering the conspiracy, the\n\nrelationship among co-defendants, and their mutual representations to third\n\nparties.” United States v. Dowlin, 408 F.3d 647, 657 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nFurthermore, “[i]n order to sustain a jury’s determination of guilt, the record need\n\nshow only ‘slight evidence of a particular defendant’s connection with a\n\nconspiracy that has already been established through independent evidence.’”\n\nUnited States v. Dickey, 736 F.2d 571, 583 (10th Cir. 1984) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Petersen, 611 F.2d 1313, 1317 (10th Cir. 1979)); see also United States\n\nv. Hamilton, 587 F.3d 1199, 1207 (10th Cir. 2009) (noting that “[t]he connection\n\nof the defendant to the conspiracy need only be slight, if there is sufficient\n\nevidence to establish that connection beyond a reasonable doubt” (alteration in\n\n                                         -22-\n\foriginal) (quoting United States v. Tranakos, 911 F.2d 1422, 1430 (10th\n\nCir.1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n      Based upon record evidence quite apart from Mr. Clark, it is beyond\n\nperadventure that Mr. Gordon and others were involved in a pump-and-dump\n\nconspiracy. See Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1129–32. Focusing then on Mr. Clark’s\n\nalleged role in that conspiracy, taken in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, there was ample record evidence that he was an active participant in\n\nit. Mr. Clark was installed as Global Beverage’s president because he was “in\n\nwith the plan” to manipulate the stock. See R., Vol. VIII, at 186–87 (Test. of\n\nMark Lindberg, dated Apr. 7, 2010). In that role, he approved a misleading\n\nbrochure touting Global Beverage’s financial prospects; then, only a few months\n\nlater, he filed a report with the SEC questioning whether the company could\n\ncontinue as a going concern. See id. at 2291–93 (Test. of Jarom Gregory, dated\n\nApr. 26, 2010).\n\n      Furthermore, Mr. Clark and the nominee individuals or entities operating at\n\nhis behest were engaged in the bulk of the pre-promotion trading of Deep Rock\n\nshares that was designed to signal to the market a genuine interest in the stock in\n\norder to effect an artificial inflation of its price. He later profited significantly\n\nfrom the sale of the stock. Moreover, according to the testimony of Mr. Lindberg,\n\nMr. Clark was an active member of the conspiracy. And the evidence supported\n\nthe government’s charge that Mr. Clark lied to the SEC concerning a nominee\n\n                                          -23-\n\faccount that he used to buy and sell Deep Rock stock.\n\n      In sum, this evidence demonstrates both Mr. Clark’s extensive involvement\n\nin the conspiracy’s activities and his related intent to defraud investors. See\n\nUnited States v. Jenkins, 633 F.3d 788, 804 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that there\n\nwas sufficient evidence of intent to defraud investors, relating to an alleged\n\npump-and-dump conspiracy, where the defendant “helped create . . . offshore\n\ncorporations holding [the target company’s] stock, helped to sell the stock, and\n\nhelped to move the various proceeds to accounts controlled by [other\n\nco-conspirators], and, further, . . . [disseminated] false and misleading [online\n\nposts]” regarding the stock); Dowlin, 408 F.3d at 658 (concluding that the jury\n\ncould have found that the defendant participated in a fraudulent scheme, where\n\nthe evidence suggested that she knew the purpose of the scheme and willingly\n\nparticipated); see also United States v. Whiteford, 676 F.3d 348, 357–58 (3d Cir.\n\n2012) (concluding that there was sufficient evidence of a defendant’s\n\nparticipation in a conspiracy, where he intended the conspiracy to continue so that\n\nhe could “reap personal benefits” from it); United States v. Whitney, 229 F.3d\n\n1296, 1301–02 (10th Cir. 2000) (holding that the evidence was sufficient to\n\nsustain a conspiracy conviction where the government showed, among other\n\nthings, that the defendant shared a motive to complete the conspiracy’s ultimate\n\nobject and provided false evidence to effect a cover-up).\n\n      Mr. Clark highlights the fact that, at one point, he sold Deep Rock stock\n\n                                        -24-\n\f“out of line,” which he calls “strong evidence that he was not involved in any\n\nalleged conspiracy.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 25 (quoting R., Vol. VIII, at 207–09)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). By way of background, consistent with the\n\noverall approach of the charged conspiracy, the conspirators were engaged in the\n\nmanipulation of Deep Rock’s stock price through the “coordinated trading” of its\n\nstock, and “part of the coordinated trading was to make sure that the stock [price]\n\nkept gradually going upwards.” R., Vol. VIII, at 207; see id. at 153 (noting that it\n\nwas the conspirators’ “plan for the steady, gradual growth of the stock price of\n\nDeep Rock”). Mr. Clark was detected by some of the conspirators selling Deep\n\nRock stock “out of turn” (presumably to make more short-term profits)—meaning\n\nthat he “sold more shares than what he should have and the stock actually stalled\n\nout” at a certain price, instead of continuing to gradually climb upward. Id. at\n\n207.\n\n       We conclude, however, that this fact—standing alone—does little to\n\nundercut the potency of the other evidence establishing Mr. Clark’s culpability\n\nfor the charged conspiracy. This is particularly true because Mr. Clark’s alleged\n\nact of rebellion was short-lived and pusillanimous. In this regard, the evidence\n\nshows that Mr. Clark did not continue selling out of turn; shortly after his\n\nco-conspirators learned of his conduct, Mr. Gordon, “took care of it” by\n\ncontacting Mr. Clark and getting him to “get back in line” with the conspirators’\n\nplan. Id. at 209, 211. Therefore, rather than suggesting to a rational factfinder\n\n                                        -25-\n\fthat Mr. Clark was not involved in the unlawful conspiratorial plan, this stock-\n\ntrading incident easily could have indicated that Mr. Clark’s knowing adherence\n\nto, and cooperation with, the conspiratorial plan was the rule, not the exception.\n\nSee United States v. Jackson, 482 F.2d 1167, 1173 (10th Cir. 1973) (“If the\n\nconspiracy is established and the convicted persons knowingly contributed their\n\nefforts in furtherance of it, then the convictions must stand.”); cf. United States\n\nThornburgh, 645 F.3d 1197, 1205–07 (10th Cir. 2011) (rejecting argument that\n\ndefendant withdrew from the conspiracy, where evidence showed that defendant\n\n“continued to participate in the conspiracy” but just “no longer communicated”\n\nwith one of his co-conspirators); United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d\n\n934, 963 (2d Cir. 1990) (“The goals of all the participants need not be congruent\n\nfor a single conspiracy to exist, so long as their goals are not at cross-purposes.”).\n\nIn other words, this stock-trading incident may well have reflected the obverse of\n\nMr. Clark’s suggested inference and thus militated in favor of the jury’s\n\ndetermination that Mr. Clark was guilty of the charged conspiracy. See United\n\nStates v. Rutland, 705 F.3d 1238, 1251 (10th Cir. 2013) (“A person is a member\n\nof a conspiracy if he was aware of the common purpose, willingly participated in\n\nthe conspiracy, and intended to advance the purpose of the conspiracy.”).\n\n      In sum, there was sufficient evidence for any rational factfinder to\n\ndetermine that Mr. Clark was a member of the charged pump-and-dump\n\nconspiracy. Accordingly, we reject Mr. Clark’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence\n\n                                         -26-\n\fchallenge to the conspiracy charge. 9\n\n      2.     Wire Fraud\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that the evidence on the wire fraud charge was\n\ninsufficient to support his conviction because the government failed to prove that\n\nhe intended to defraud investors through his participation in the scheme. See\n\nUnited States v. Welch, 327 F.3d 1081, 1104 (10th Cir. 2003) (explaining that the\n\nelements of wire fraud include “an intent to defraud”). However, the evidence\n\nalready set forth is more than sufficient to support a rational jury’s finding that\n\nMr. Clark had an intent to defraud. 10\n\n      Mr. Clark makes much of the fact that, in the promotional materials that\n\nwere sent to potential buyers, he had no duty to disclose his intent to sell shares.\n\nDuty or not, the promotional materials contained false and misleading\n\ninformation. See, e.g., R., Vol. VIII, at 3144–48 (Test. of Mark Lindberg, dated\n\nApr. 6, 2010). Moreover, Mr. Clark was engaged in coordinated selling to inflate\n\n\n      9\n             Similarly, we reject Mr. Clark’s hollow assertion that “the evidence\npresented at trial . . . indicates that the price of the stock in the various companies\nincreased because of market events.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 26. While there were\nother factors apart from the fraudulent conduct of Mr. Clark and his\nco-conspirators that could have affected the stock prices, the jury was not\nrequired to necessarily conclude that they did. See Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1144\nn.22; cf. Jenkins, 633 F.3d at 802 (“Materiality in securities fraud does not\ndepend on demonstration of a market reaction to the misstatements.”).\n      10\n             The magnitude of the evidence—which implicates Mr. Clark, as well\nas Mr. Gordon—is further explicated in our decision resolving the Gordon appeal.\nSee, e.g., Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1142–44.\n\n                                         -27-\n\fthe sales price of stock, id. at 207–12; and he later profited significantly, id. at\n\n174–75. Any rational trier of fact could infer easily that Mr. Clark possessed a\n\nfraudulent intent based on this evidence. See Jenkins, 633 F.3d at 804.\n\n      3.     Securities Fraud\n\n      Mr. Clark further challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the\n\nsecurities fraud counts (Counts 11–15). “Under 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), any person\n\nwho uses or employs a manipulative or deceptive device in connection with the\n\nsale of any security commits securities fraud.” Id. at 801–02. And Rule 10b-5,\n\nwhich implements § 78j(b), “forbids the making of ‘any untrue statement of a\n\nmaterial fact.’” Id. at 802 (quoting 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b)).\n\n      Mr. Clark does not allege that the evidence was insufficient on any specific\n\nelement of the securities fraud offense. Rather, he claims that the government\n\nfailed to establish securities fraud because (1) “there is always risk involved” in\n\ntrading penny stocks, (2) Mr. Clark had no duty to disclose in the promotional\n\nmaterials his intention to sell shares, and (3) the fact that he sold shares out of\n\nline with the rest of the group suggests that “he was not connected to any\n\nagreement to defraud.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 28. We reject the latter two\n\ncontentions for the reasons that we articulated supra in disposing of Mr. Clark’s\n\nchallenges to his conspiracy and wire fraud convictions.\n\n      As for the first contention, it may be quite true that trading in penny stocks\n\nis risky. See Hoxworth v. Blinder, 74 F.3d 205, 207 n.1 (10th Cir. 1996) (“‘Penny\n\n                                          -28-\n\fstocks’ are low-priced, high risk equity securities. The securities are frequently\n\ntraded outside well-established trading markets.” (emphasis added)); accord\n\nNewton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 259 F.3d 154, 175 n.14\n\n(3d Cir. 2001). However, on this record, this fact is completely irrelevant. The\n\nmagnitude of the risk accompanying an investment does not mean its investors are\n\nany less harmed by fraudulent conduct; even investors who are inclined to tolerate\n\na great deal of risk are legally entitled under the securities laws to be protected\n\nfrom fraudulent conduct that distorts their picture of the material variables\n\nassociated with the investment. See, e.g., United States v. Russo, 74 F.3d 1383,\n\n1393–95 (2d Cir. 1996) (rejecting multiple challenges to defendants’ mail fraud\n\nand securities fraud convictions, stemming from defendants’ unlawful scheme to,\n\ninter alia, manipulate the price of penny stocks). Mr. Clark and his\n\nco-conspirators engaged in manipulations of penny stock that had just such a\n\ndistorting effect. Put simply, in light of the evidence against Mr. Clark, any\n\nrational trier of fact could conclude that he, along with others in the conspiracy,\n\ncommitted securities fraud.\n\n      4.     Money Laundering\n\n      Finally, of the six counts in the indictment relating to money laundering,\n\nthe jury convicted Mr. Clark of only one—Count 18; it alleged that the defendants\n\ntransmitted $245,000 of funds derived from the conspiracy. Mr. Clark challenges\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence regarding this count, contending that there was no\n\n                                         -29-\n\fevidence that any transfer of funds forming the basis for this money laundering\n\ncharge directly involved him. The government concedes that Mr. Clark “was not\n\npersonally involved in the transaction on which his money laundering conviction\n\n. . . was based.” Aplee. Br. at 28. Instead, the government argues that Mr. Clark\n\nis liable under a Pinkerton theory.\n\n      Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.S.\n\n640, 646–48 (1946), “a defendant [may be held] responsible for the crimes of his\n\nco-conspirators, if those crimes are committed to help advance the conspiracy and\n\nare within the reasonably foreseeable scope of the conspiracy.” Irvin, 682 F.3d at\n\n1274; see also United States v. Rosalez, 711 F.3d 1194, 1206 (10th Cir. 2013)\n\n(discussing Pinkerton and noting that the Court “explained the basic notion\n\nbehind coconspirator liability” in that case). As noted, the evidence supports the\n\nreasonable inference that Mr. Clark was an active member of the fraudulent\n\npump-and-dump conspiracy. Laundering the proceeds of such a conspiracy would\n\n“help advance the conspiracy,” Irvin, 682 F.3d at 1274, in that it would facilitate\n\nthe concealment of the source of the funds. See United States v. Massey, 48 F.3d\n\n1560, 1567 n.3 (10th Cir. 1995) (“[T]he jury could reasonably conclude that the\n\nacts of mail fraud and money laundering were both in furtherance of the\n\n[fraudulent loan] conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable.”); see also United States\n\nv. Pretty, 98 F.3d 1213, 1220 (10th Cir. 1996) (holding, in the context of a\n\nbribery conspiracy, that “the jury’s inference that the intent of these [financial]\n\n                                         -30-\n\ftransactions was at least in part to conceal the source of the funds was a\n\nreasonable one”). Consequently, a reasonable factfinder could have determined\n\nthat it was reasonably foreseeable to Mr. Clark—as an active participant in the\n\npump-and-dump conspiracy—that money laundering activities would be\n\nundertaken to further the conspiracy. And, more specifically, such a factfinder\n\ncould have concluded that the fund transfer at issue in Count 18 was reasonably\n\nforeseeable to Mr. Clark and that, under a Pinkerton theory, he was accountable\n\nfor it.\n\n          Thus, we reject Mr. Clark’s suggestion that he could not be found\n\ncriminally liable for Count 18 because he did not personally participate in the\n\nmonetary transaction at issue. See United States v. Moreland, 622 F.3d 1147,\n\n1169 (9th Cir. 2010) (“Pursuant to the Pinkerton doctrine, sufficient evidence\n\nexists in this case to uphold [the defendant’s] convictions for the substantive\n\nmoney laundering charges provided that: (1) there is sufficient evidence to uphold\n\nhis conviction for conspiracy, (2) the money laundering offenses were committed\n\nin furtherance of the conspiracy while [the defendant] was a member of the\n\nconspiracy, and (3) the actions providing the basis for the substantive charges\n\nwere reasonably foreseeable to [the defendant].”); United States v. Sullivan, 522\n\nF.3d 967, 977 (9th Cir. 2008) (“Even if [the defendant] was not directly involved\n\nin the wire transfers [to conceal proceeds of an unlawful bankruptcy fraud\n\nscheme], a rational juror could have found that the transfers were reasonably\n\n                                          -31-\n\fforeseeable to him as part of the conspiracy . . . .”); see also Rosalez, 711 F.3d at\n\n1207 (holding that a defendant convicted of conspiracy to assault the victim could\n\nbe held responsible under Pinkerton for the victim’s murder, even though he was\n\nnot present during the assault, because “the murder of [the victim] was not an act\n\nthat occurred separately from the assault [i.e., the object of the conspiracy], but\n\nrather was a direct, and entirely foreseeable, result of the vicious assault carried\n\nout on him”); United States v. Silvestri, 409 F.3d 1311, 1336 (11th Cir. 2005)\n\n(“[T]he Pinkerton doctrine has been applied to money laundering conspiracy\n\ncases; a defendant who joins a money laundering conspiracy may be found\n\nsubstantively liable for money laundering offenses committed by\n\nco-conspirators.”). Accordingly, Mr. Clark’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence\n\nchallenge to Count 18 is unavailing.\n\nC.    Refusal to Appoint Attorney\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that he was denied a fair trial when the district court\n\nrejected his request under provisions of the Criminal Justice Act (“CJA”), 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3006A, to appoint substitute or additional counsel with expertise in\n\nsecurities law.\n\n      In November 2009, Mr. Clark’s attorney, Allen Smallwood, sought to\n\nwithdraw from his representation of Mr. Clark, citing Mr. Clark’s inability to pay\n\n\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fhis legal fees. 11 The district court denied Mr. Smallwood’s request, noting his\n\nextensive involvement with the case for over two years. In February 2010, Mr.\n\nSmallwood filed a motion under the CJA and asked the court to appoint an\n\nattorney with securities-law experience as either substitute counsel or co-counsel\n\nfor Mr. Clark. The district court denied the motion.\n\n      Mr. Clark argues that this denial violated his right to a fair trial. He draws\n\nour attention to two things: first, that the CJA requires that more than one\n\nattorney be appointed in an extremely difficult case; and second, that the\n\ngovernment moved successfully for a declaration under the Speedy Trial Act that\n\nthe case was “complex” and required more extensive preparation and a\n\ncontinuance of the trial, see R., Vol. I, at 103 (Unopposed Mot. of United States\n\nto Declare This Case a Complex Matter, filed Feb. 26, 2009) (referencing 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A)–(B) 12). In essence, Mr. Clark claims that he was entitled\n\n      11\n              In this same motion, three other attorneys representing Mr. Clark\nalso sought to withdraw. These attorneys were R. Thomas Seymour, Scott A.\nGraham, and Anthony L. Allen of Seymour & Graham, LLP. They entered their\nappearance as “additional counsel” for Mr. Clark on October 1, 2009. R., Vol. I,\nat 346. They did not replace Mr. Smallwood, and, at least as the district court\nsaw it, “their involvement was limited.” Id. Specifically, they were brought in\nfor two purposes: to oppose the government’s motion to revoke Mr. Clark’s\nrelease pending trial and to persuade the court to permit the liquidation of assets\nfor the purpose of paying attorneys’ fees. See id. at 152 (Entry of Appearance,\nfiled Oct. 1, 2009) (“This appearance is, at present, limited to representation of\nMr. Clark in respect of the Government’s Motion to Revoke Release and in\nrespect of the issue of payment of attorneys’ fees in the case.”).\n      12\n             The motion actually cites 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161(h)(8)(A)–(B). In 2008,\n                                                                   (continued...)\n\n                                        -33-\n\fto a securities-law expert either as a substitute for, or in addition to, Mr.\n\nSmallwood.\n\n      1.     Standard of Review\n\n      We review the district court’s denial of a motion to substitute counsel for\n\nan abuse of discretion. See United States v. Hutchinson, 573 F.3d 1011, 1024\n\n(10th Cir. 2009); United States v. Anderson, 189 F.3d 1201, 1210 (10th Cir.\n\n1999). To warrant substitution, a defendant must demonstrate “good cause, such\n\nas a conflict of interest, a complete breakdown of communication or an\n\nirreconcilable conflict which leads to an apparently unjust verdict.” Hutchinson,\n\n573 F.3d at 1024 (quoting United States v. Beers, 189 F.3d 1297, 1302 (10th Cir.\n\n1999)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see United States v. Byrum, 567 F.3d\n\n1255, 1265–66 (10th Cir. 2009) (discussing factors applicable in addressing this\n\nissue). The overriding question is whether the district court’s decision was one of\n\nthe “rationally available choices given the facts and the applicable law in the case\n\nat hand.” Hutchinson, 573 F.3d at 1024 (quoting Shook v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs,\n\n543 F.3d 597, 603 (10th Cir. 2008)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n      12\n        (...continued)\nhowever, “Congress redesignated 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(8) as 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3161(h)(7).” United States v. Hernandez-Mejia, 406 F. App’x 330, 331 n.2\n(10th Cir. 2011); see Judicial Administration and Technical Amendments Act of\n2008, Pub. L. No. 110-406, § 13, 122 Stat. 4291, 4294 (2008). We utilize the\ncurrent numbering of the applicable provisions of § 3161(h) in addressing Mr.\nClark’s contentions in this appeal.\n\n                                          -34-\n\f       “As CJA matters rarely generate published decisions,” United States v.\n\nRomero-Gallardo, 245 F.3d 1159, 1160 (10th Cir. 2001), there is little authority\n\non the standard of review applicable to a district court’s decision to deny\n\nappointment of additional, expert counsel under the CJA. Other circuits have\n\nreviewed somewhat analogous decisions for an abuse of discretion. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Ensign, 491 F.3d 1109, 1113–15 (9th Cir. 2007); United States v.\n\nReed, 658 F.2d 624, 628 (8th Cir. 1981); see also 3B Charles Alan Wright &\n\nPeter J. Henning, Federal Practice and Procedure § 737, at 113 (4th ed. 2013)\n\n(“The number of counsel to be assigned is . . . in the discretion of the appointing\n\nauthority . . . .”).\n\n       Guided by these authorities, 13 we conclude that the district court’s decision\n\nto refuse appointment of additional counsel for a defendant, like its refusal to\n\nsubstitute counsel, see Hutchinson, 573 F.3d at 1024, is reviewable only for an\n\nabuse of discretion. The abuse-of-discretion standard is appropriate because the\n\ndecision we are tasked with reviewing is at bottom a judgment call, given the\n\nfactual circumstances of the case. Where the court is tasked with evaluating the\n\nprejudice that would befall a defendant absent additional counsel, it must consider\n\na vast array of contextually specific matters related to the way the proceedings\n\n\n       13\n             Mr. Clark’s brief is silent regarding the appropriate standard of\nreview to assess the propriety of the district court’s decision on this matter,\nwhereas the government suggests that we should review for an abuse of\ndiscretion, see Aplee. Br. at 47.\n\n                                         -35-\n\fhave advanced. Consequently, there “will not necessarily be a single right\n\nanswer, but a range of possible outcomes the facts and law at issue can fairly\n\nsupport.” Big Sky Network Can., Ltd. v. Sichuan Provincial Gov’t, 533 F.3d\n\n1183, 1186 (10th Cir. 2008); see United States v. Gabaldon, 91 F.3d 91, 93–94\n\n(10th Cir. 1996) (applying an abuse-of-discretion standard to motions which\n\nrequired the district court to “examin[e] . . . the prejudicial impact of an error or\n\nerrors when viewed in the context of an entire case”). And, “rather than pick and\n\nchoose among [those outcomes] ourselves, we will defer to the district court’s\n\njudgment so long as it falls within the realm of these rationally available\n\nchoices.” Big Sky Network, 533 F.3d at 1186.\n\n      As for the scope and content of the district court’s inquiry concerning\n\nrequests to add counsel, we find instructive decisions addressing whether to\n\npermit CJA funding for “investigative, expert, and other services necessary for\n\nadequate representation,” United States v. Solon, 596 F.3d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir.\n\n2010) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(e)(1)) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf.\n\nUnited States v. Kennedy, 64 F.3d 1465, 1473–74 (10th Cir. 1995) (“An indigent\n\ndefendant is not entitled to all the assistance that a wealthier counterpart might\n\nbuy, but rather only to the basic and integral tools.”), a decision that we also\n\nreview for an abuse of discretion, see Solon, 596 F.3d at 1210 (“‘Appointing an\n\nexpert is within the discretion of the [c]ourt,’ therefore, we review the denial of a\n\nCJA funding request for an abuse of discretion.” (alteration in original) (citation\n\n                                          -36-\n\fomitted) (quoting United States v. Ready, 574 F.2d 1009, 1015 (10th Cir. 1978))).\n\nAnd in such instances, “the defendant must do more than allege that [an expert’s]\n\nservices would be helpful.” Kennedy, 64 F.3d at 1470. Rather, he “must\n\nconvince the court that the [additional] services are ‘necessary to an adequate\n\ndefense.’” Solon, 596 F.3d at 1209–10 (quoting United States v. Greschner, 802\n\nF.2d 373, 376 (10th Cir. 1986)).\n\n      We note that, unlike a defendant’s right to spend his own money ad\n\ninfinitum on counsel of his choosing, see United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548\n\nU.S. 140, 144 (2006), the right to court-appointed counsel is geared toward the\n\ngoal of ensuring constitutionally adequate representation, see United States v.\n\nFlanders, 491 F.3d 1197, 1216 (10th Cir. 2007) (citing Caplin & Drysdale, 491\n\nU.S. at 624); see also 18 U.S.C. § 3006A(a) (“Representation under each [CJA]\n\nplan shall include counsel and investigative, expert, and other services necessary\n\nfor adequate representation.” (emphases added)). Indeed, the federal judiciary’s\n\nmodel CJA plan contemplates that a defendant might request the appointment of\n\nan “additional attorney,” but suggests that such appointment is available only in\n\n“extremely difficult case[s] . . . [and] in the interest of justice.” 7A Guidelines\n\nfor Administering the CJA and Related Statutes § 230.53.20 (2013) [hereinafter\n\nCJA Guidelines]; see Romero-Gallardo, 245 F.3d at 1160 (suggesting that the\n\nguidelines “do not allow for multiple counsel” outside of limited circumstances).\n\nIn all cases, we consider whether the denial of CJA funding for an additional\n\n                                         -37-\n\fattorney impeded the defendant’s defense, not incidentally, but directly enough to\n\nundermine a constitutionally “adequate” defense. 14 See Kennedy, 64 F.3d at\n\n1470–73.\n\n      2.    Application to Mr. Clark’s Claim\n\n      Applying the abuse-of-discretion standard to the district court’s denial of\n\nMr. Smallwood’s motion for appointment of substitute or additional counsel, we\n\nconclude that the district court acted within its discretion. The record shows that\n\nMr. Smallwood is a highly experienced criminal defense attorney. Further, Mr.\n\nClark hired him even prior to the return of the indictment, while the government\n\nwas investigating the activities of Mr. Clark and his alleged co-conspirators.\n\nThus, by the time of Mr. Smallwood’s CJA motion, he had represented Mr. Clark\n\nfor approximately two-and-a-half years—ample time to become familiar with the\n\nfacts and law applicable to Mr. Clark’s case.\n\n      There is no indication of a breakdown in communication between Mr. Clark\n\nand Mr. Smallwood, nor a conflict of interest on Mr. Smallwood’s part, that\n\nwould justify substitution of counsel, see Hutchinson, 573 F.3d at 1024, even\n\nconsidering the fact that Mr. Clark could ostensibly no longer pay the balance of\n\n\n\n      14\n              We assume without deciding that Mr. Clark meets the CJA’s\nfinancial eligibility requirements for the appointment of counsel and that a\ndefendant like Mr. Clark may request the appointment of an additional attorney\nunder the CJA where, like here, he has allegedly run out of funds to pay for\nprivately retained counsel who is otherwise obliged to remain active in the case.\n\n                                        -38-\n\fhis legal fees, see United States v. O’Neil, 118 F.3d 65, 71–72 (2d Cir. 1997)\n\n(“There is little question that a defendant’s failure to pay fees may cause some\n\ndivisiveness between attorney and client, but we presume that counsel will\n\ncontinue to execute his professional and ethical duty to zealously represent his\n\nclient, notwithstanding [a] fee dispute.”).\n\n      Furthermore, in light of Mr. Smallwood’s criminal-defense experience and\n\nhis conduct in the case, the district court could quite reasonably conclude that Mr.\n\nSmallwood’s representation was sufficient for an adequate defense. In other\n\nwords, it could reasonably conclude that an additional attorney—even one more\n\nfamiliar with securities law—was not “necessary to an adequate defense.” See\n\nSolon, 596 F.3d at 1209–10 (emphasis added) (quoting Greschner, 802 F.2d at\n\n376) (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Porter, 405 F.3d 1136,\n\n1141–42 (10th Cir. 2005) (concluding that there was no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of the defendant’s motion to substitute counsel because,\n\ninter alia, there was nothing in the record demonstrating that the attorney could\n\nnot provide an adequate defense).\n\n      This is particularly true where the charges in this case, at their essence,\n\nconcerned general allegations of fraud, and did not, for instance, present the need\n\nto synthesize highly technical securities regulations. And, although the charges\n\nwere premised on voluminous, finance-related discovery, Mr. Clark has failed to\n\npoint to any problems with Mr. Smallwood’s representation that would undermine\n\n                                         -39-\n\fthe soundness of the district court’s decision to deny his motion for substitute or\n\nadditional counsel. For these reasons, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Mr. Clark’s motion for appointment of substitute or\n\nadditional counsel.\n\n      Finally, we reject as unpersuasive Mr. Clark’s facile attempt to link the\n\nconcept of a “complex” case under the Speedy Trial Act to the concept of an\n\n“extremely difficult” case contemplated by the CJA Guidelines. See CJA\n\nGuidelines § 230.53.20. The CJA Guidelines and the Speedy Trial Act serve\n\nwholly different purposes. Compare, e.g., id. § 110.10 (noting that the goal of the\n\nDefender Services program is to “ensure that the right to counsel guaranteed by\n\nthe Sixth Amendment, the [CJA], and other congressional mandates is enforced\n\non behalf of those who cannot afford to retain counsel and other necessary\n\ndefense services”), with Speedy Trial Act of 1974 § 101, 18 U.S.C. § 3161\n\n(suggesting that the Act was passed “so as to assure a speedy trial” in line with\n\nthe defendant’s Sixth Amendment right). In sum, for the reasons noted, we\n\nconclude that Mr. Clark’s appointment-of-counsel challenge fails.\n\nD.    Severance\n\n      Mr. Clark asserts that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to\n\nstand trial alone. Principally, he objects to the district court’s decision not to\n\nsever his trial from that of Mr. Gordon, his co-defendant. He reasons that the\n\nadmission of inculpatory out-of-court statements by Mr. Gordon violated Bruton\n\n                                         -40-\n\fv. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). He also challenges the district court’s\n\ndecision on three other grounds. Specifically, Mr. Clark contends that the\n\nprejudicial effects of the district court’s refusal not to allow him to stand trial\n\nalone were that (1) he was prevented from compelling Mr. Gordon to testify, (2)\n\nevidence that was relevant to the culpability of his co-defendants unfairly spilled\n\nover onto him, and (3) he was forced to stand trial with co-conspirators who were\n\nunavailable for cross-examination or confrontation. We conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not commit reversible error.\n\n      1.     Bruton Claim\n\n      Mr. Clark argues that the government—through Mr. Lindberg’s\n\ntestimony—presented evidence that Mr. Gordon often referred to Mr. Clark as\n\n“heat-resistant,” meaning that he was “somebody who would not buckle under the\n\npressure of an SEC investigation.” R., Vol. VIII, at 2974; see id. at 186. The\n\nadmission of these statements at his joint trial, reasons Mr. Clark, violated his\n\nSixth Amendment right of confrontation as explicated in Bruton.\n\n      “We review de novo the legal issue of whether the admission of the\n\nnon-testifying codefendant’s statements/confession in a joint trial violated the\n\ndefendant’s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.” United States v.\n\nSarracino, 340 F.3d 1148, 1158–59 (10th Cir. 2003) (quoting United States v.\n\nVerduzco-Martinez, 186 F.3d 1208, 1212 (10th Cir.1999)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n                                          -41-\n\f      The Confrontation Clause provides: “In all criminal prosecutions, the\n\naccused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him\n\n. . . .” U.S. Const. amend. VI. “In Bruton, the Court held that it would violate\n\nthe Confrontation Clause to allow the confession of a non-testifying co-defendant\n\nthat implicated the defendant to be used against that defendant [at their joint\n\ntrial].” United States v. Patterson, 713 F.3d 1237, 1247 (10th Cir. 2013); see\n\nUnited States v. Smalls, 605 F.3d 765, 768 n.2 (10th Cir. 2010) (“In Bruton, the\n\nCourt held that [the] defendant was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to\n\nconfrontation where his accomplice’s confession . . . was introduced at their joint\n\ntrial.”); see also Greene v. Fisher, 132 S. Ct. 38, 42–43 (2011) (noting that\n\nBruton establishes that “the Confrontation Clause forbids the prosecution to\n\nintroduce a nontestifying codefendant’s confession implicating the defendant in\n\nthe crime”).\n\n      Bruton applies “even if the jury is instructed to consider that confession\n\nonly against the codefendant.” Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 201–02\n\n(1987); see Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. 428, 458 (2000) (Scalia, J.,\n\ndissenting) (noting that Bruton “was based . . . upon the self-evident proposition\n\nthat the inability to cross-examine an available witness whose damaging\n\nout-of-court testimony is introduced violates the Confrontation Clause, combined\n\nwith the conclusion that in these circumstances a mere jury instruction can never\n\nbe relied upon to prevent the testimony from being damaging” (emphases added)).\n\n                                         -42-\n\f      We have cautioned that Bruton’s rule is “a narrow one”; it applies only\n\nwhen the co-defendant’s statement is “so inculpatory as to the defendant that the\n\npractical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.” Sarracino,\n\n340 F.3d at 1160 (quoting United States v. Rahseparian, 231 F.3d 1267, 1277\n\n(10th Cir. 2000)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see United States v. Nash,\n\n482 F.3d 1209, 1218 (10th Cir. 2007) (“[T]he rule announced in Bruton is a\n\nlimited one.”). However, Bruton provides the foundation for affirmative remedial\n\nmeasures—most notably, severance—upon a proper showing that a co-defendant’s\n\nstatement offered into evidence would inculpate the defendant. See Nash, 482\n\nF.3d at 1217–18 (discussing the Bruton process). These measures are meant to\n\navoid the extrinsic (i.e., collateral) damage to a defendant from the jury’s undue\n\nconsideration of a co-defendant’s facially inculpatory statement—a factor that the\n\njury would be highly unlikely to “disregard” and one that cannot be remedied by a\n\ncurative instruction. See Bruton, 391 U.S. at 128–29. When evidence is admitted\n\nin violation of Bruton, “we must reverse unless we can conclude beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the constitutional error was harmless.” Sarracino, 340 F.3d\n\nat 1161 (citing Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967)).\n\n      Since Bruton was decided, the Supreme Court’s Confrontation Clause\n\njurisprudence has evolved, beginning with Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36\n\n(2004), and extending through Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813 (2006), to the\n\nCourt’s more recent Confrontation Clause decisions: specifically, Melendez-Diaz\n\n                                        -43-\n\fv. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009); Michigan v. Bryant, 131 S. Ct. 1143\n\n(2011); and Bullcoming v. New Mexico, 131 S. Ct. 2705 (2011). “In Crawford,\n\nthe Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment precluded the admission of\n\nout-of-court statements that are testimonial, unless the witness is unavailable and\n\nthe defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.” Patterson,\n\n713 F.3d at 1246–47; see Crawford, 541 U.S. at 53–54; see also Bryant, 131 S.\n\nCt. at 1153 (“[Crawford] limited the Confrontation Clause’s reach to testimonial\n\nstatements and held that in order for testimonial evidence to be admissible, the\n\nSixth Amendment ‘demands what the common law required: unavailability and a\n\nprior opportunity for cross-examination.’” (quoting Crawford, 541 U.S. at 68)).\n\n      Like our sister circuits, we have recognized the need to interpret Bruton\n\n“consistent[ly] with the present state of Sixth Amendment law.” Smalls, 605 F.3d\n\nat 768 n.2; see, e.g., United States v. Figueroa-Cartagena, 612 F.3d 69, 85 (1st\n\nCir. 2010); United States v. Johnson, 581 F.3d 320, 325–26 (6th Cir. 2009);\n\nUnited States v. Avila Vargas, 570 F.3d 1004, 1008–09 (8th Cir. 2009).\n\n      Notably, Crawford made clear that the Confrontation Clause applies only if\n\na statement is “testimonial” in nature, for “[o]nly statements of this sort cause the\n\ndeclarant to be a ‘witness’ within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause.”\n\nDavis, 547 U.S. at 821 (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51). Indeed, reflecting on\n\nthe text and history of the Confrontation Clause, the Court in Crawford explained\n\nthat out-of-court testimonial statements, or the “‘bear[ing of] testimony,’” were\n\n                                         -44-\n\fthe core “evil[s] at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.” 541 U.S. at\n\n50–51 (quoting 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language\n\n(1828)); see id. at 50 (noting the Founders’ concern with the “use of ex parte\n\nexaminations as evidence against the accused”); see also Bullcoming, 131 S. Ct.\n\nat 2713 (“[F]idelity to the Confrontation Clause [does not] permit[] admission of\n\n[t]estimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial,” absent a showing that\n\n“the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior\n\nopportunity to cross-examine.” (fourth alteration in original) (quoting Crawford,\n\n541 U.S. at 59) (internal quotation marks omitted)). 15\n\n      Crawford indicates that the class of testimonial statements that fall within\n\nthe protective ambit of the Confrontation Clause includes, but is not limited to,\n\nstatements covered also by Bruton. See Crawford, 541 U.S. at 51–52 (listing as\n\nexamples of testimonial statements “extrajudicial statements . . . contained in\n\n\n      15\n             The Crawford Court also opined that the clause generally “does not\nbar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth\nof the matter asserted.” 541 U.S. at 59 n.9. In other words, as we have clarified,\n“A defendant’s confrontation rights are implicated by the admission of\ntestimonial statements against the defendant . . . only when they are admitted to\nestablish the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.” United States v.\nPablo, 696 F.3d 1280, 1287 (10th Cir. 2012); accord United States v. Walker, 673\nF.3d 649, 657–58 (7th Cir. 2012). That is, the Confrontation Clause’s scope\ngenerally extends no further than testimonial hearsay. The upshot is that the\nclause “constitute[s] an absolute bar to the admissibility of a testimonial hearsay\nstatement where the declarant was unavailable to testify at trial and the defendant\nhad no prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.” Smalls, 605 F.3d at\n774.\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\fformalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony,\n\nor confessions” (emphasis added) (quoting White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346, 365\n\n(1992) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)); see also Jones v. Basinger, 635 F.3d 1030, 1049 n.6\n\n(7th Cir. 2011) (“The use of a non-testifying accomplice’s confession . . . in\n\nseventeenth century England set in motion the series of legal reforms eventually\n\nresulting in the Confrontation Clause itself.” (citing Crawford, 541 U.S. at\n\n44–46)); cf. Smalls, 605 F.3d at 768 n.2 (noting that “the Bruton rule, like the\n\nConfrontation Clause upon which it is premised, does not apply to nontestimonial\n\nhearsay statements”). Thus, we are obliged to “view Bruton through the lens of\n\nCrawford” and, in doing so, we consider “whether the challenged statement is\n\ntestimonial.” Figueroa-Cartagena, 612 F.3d at 85.\n\n      In Smalls, based upon our synthesis of Crawford, Davis, and our own\n\nConfrontation Clause precedent, we posited two possible definitions of a\n\n“testimonial” statement: (1) “a formal declaration made by the declarant that,\n\nwhen objectively considered, indicates the primary purpose for which the\n\ndeclaration was made was that of establishing or proving some fact potentially\n\nrelevant to a criminal prosecution”; or (2) “[a] formal statement [such that] a\n\nreasonable person in the position of the declarant would objectively foresee that\n\nthe primary purpose of the statement was for use in the investigation or\n\nprosecution of a crime.” 605 F.3d at 778; cf. United States v. Solorio, 669 F.3d\n\n                                        -46-\n\f943, 953 (9th Cir. 2012) (“[S]tatements made out-of-court with a primary purpose\n\nother than possible prosecutorial use are nontestimonial.”). We did not choose in\n\nSmalls between the two definitions because we found the statement at issue in\n\nSmalls to be nontestimonial “regardless of which of the foregoing definitions we\n\napply.” 605 F.3d at 778. We employ the same approach here and conclude that\n\nthe statement at issue is not testimonial under either definition.\n\n      Mr. Clark contends that the evidence—through Mr. Lindberg’s\n\ntestimony—of Mr. Gordon’s out-of-court statements referring to Mr. Clark as\n\n“heat-resistant” violates Bruton. However, because the statement is not\n\ntestimonial, we disagree. The statement was made to Mr. Lindberg, a\n\nco-conspirator, in furtherance of the underlying conspiracy. In particular, the\n\ngroup wanted to install Mr. Clark as president of Global Beverage so that, if\n\nnecessary, he could withstand the psychological pressure of a federal\n\ninvestigation and not disclose the conspirators’ illegal endeavors. Mr. Gordon’s\n\nstatements were not made to law enforcement investigators, nor could a\n\nreasonable person in Mr. Gordon’s position have objectively foreseen that the\n\nprimary purpose for his statements was for use in the investigation or prosecution\n\nof the pump-and-dump conspiracy. See Bryant, 131 S. Ct. at 1154. Thus, we\n\nconclude that they fall outside the protective ambit of the Confrontation Clause\n\nand, by extension, Bruton.\n\n      In considering a Confrontation Clause challenge—predicated on Crawford\n\n                                         -47-\n\fand Bruton—to the admission of two statements made in the context of a\n\nnarcotics-conspiracy prosecution, we recently reached a very similar conclusion.\n\nSpecifically, in Patterson, we succinctly reasoned as follows: “The admission of\n\nthese two statements violated neither Crawford nor Bruton because both\n\nstatements were made in furtherance of a conspiracy and were therefore\n\nnontestimonial.” 713 F.3d at 1247. Likewise, our decision in United States v.\n\nTownley, 472 F.3d 1267 (10th Cir. 2007), bolsters our holding here. There,\n\nfollowing Crawford and Davis, we determined that certain out-of-court\n\nco-conspirator statements were not testimonial because “[n]one of [them] was\n\nmade at a hearing or trial or as a result of police interrogation, and no reasonable\n\nperson in the position of the[] declarants would have objectively foreseen that\n\nthese statements would be used in the investigation or prosecution of the[]\n\nconspiracy.” Townley, 472 F.3d at 1275 (citation omitted); see Melendez-Diaz,\n\n557 U.S. at 324 (suggesting that “business records or statements in furtherance of\n\na conspiracy” are “statements that by their nature [a]re not testimonial” (quoting\n\nCrawford, 541 U.S. at 56) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Bourjaily\n\nv. United States, 483 U.S. 171, 181–83 (1987) (discussing the co-conspirator\n\nexception to the hearsay rule and its relationship to the protections afforded by\n\nthe Confrontation Clause). We thus concluded in Townley that the Confrontation\n\n\n\n\n                                         -48-\n\fClause did not apply. 16 472 F.3d at 1275. For like reasons, the clause does not\n\napply here either. In sum, based upon the foregoing, we conclude that, because\n\nMr. Gordon’s statements were not testimonial, Mr. Clark’s Bruton claim must\n\nfail.\n\n        2.    Other Severance Issues\n\n        Mr. Clark makes three remaining arguments concerning the district court’s\n\nfailure to allow him to stand trial alone. Mr. Clark argues that the prejudicial\n\neffect of this decision was that (1) he was prevented from compelling Mr. Gordon\n\nto testify, (2) evidence that was relevant to the culpability of his co-defendants\n\nunfairly spilled over onto him, and (3) he was forced to stand trial with\n\nco-conspirators who were unavailable for cross-examination or confrontation. We\n\nreject each argument and conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying severance.\n\n\n\n        16\n             We also recognized that the Supreme Court’s Confrontation Clause\njurisprudence, specifically Crawford and Davis, “le[ft] longstanding interpretation\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence untouched,” and we rejected the contention that\nCrawford “somehow eviscerated Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E),”\napplicable to co-conspirator statements. Townley, 472 F.3d at 1273. “Rule\n801(d)(2)(E) provides that ‘[a] statement is not hearsay if . . . [t]he statement is\noffered against a party and is . . . a statement by a coconspirator of a party during\nthe course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.’” Id. (alterations in original)\n(quoting Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(E)). In order for a statement to be “in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy” it must be “intended to promote the conspiratorial\nobjectives.” United States v. Reyes, 798 F.2d 380, 384 (10th Cir. 1986) (quoting\nUnited States v. Hamilton, 689 F.2d 1262, 1270 (6th Cir. 1982)) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n                                        -49-\n\f             a. Standard of Review\n\n      There are two significant provisions that frequently are implicated by\n\nseverance claims. The first is Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 8(b),\n\nwhich “permits an indictment to charge two or more defendants ‘if they are\n\nalleged to have participated in the same act or transaction, or in the same series of\n\nacts or transactions, constituting an offense or offenses.’” United States v.\n\nPursley, 577 F.3d 1204, 1215 (10th Cir. 2009) (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(b)); cf.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 13 (“The court may order that separate cases be tried together as\n\nthough brought in a single indictment or information if all offenses and all\n\ndefendants could have been joined in a single indictment or information.”). Rule\n\n8(b) embodies a “preference in the federal system for joint trials of defendants\n\nwho are indicted together,” Pursley, 577 F.3d at 1215 (quoting Zafiro v. United\n\nStates, 506 U.S. 534, 537 (1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Marsh,\n\n481 U.S. at 209 (“Joint trials play a vital role in the criminal justice system\n\n. . . .”), and it is broadly construed so as “to enhance the efficiency of the judicial\n\nsystem,” United States v. Morales, 108 F.3d 1213, 1219 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nMoreover, we indulge a presumption that co-conspirators in a conspiracy trial\n\nshould be tried together. See Pursley, 577 F.3d at 1215; see also United States v.\n\nStiger, 413 F.3d 1185, 1197 (10th Cir. 2005) (“[I]n a conspiracy trial it is\n\npreferred that persons charged together be tried together.” (quoting United States\n\nv. Scott, 37 F.3d 1564, 1579 (10th Cir. 1994)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n                                         -50-\n\f      The second provision is Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14(a). It\n\nprovides that “a court ‘may’ sever the trials of more than one defendant if joinder\n\n‘appears to prejudice a defendant or the government.’” Pursley, 577 F.3d at 1215\n\n(quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a)). Prejudice for Rule 14(a) purposes means\n\n“actual prejudice.” United States v. Caldwell, 560 F.3d 1214, 1221 (10th Cir.\n\n2009). Thus, “a district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if\n\nthere is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of\n\none of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about\n\nguilt or innocence.” Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. That risk is present when the jury\n\nconsiders evidence against a defendant that is admissible only against a\n\nco-defendant, and is increased when multiple defendants are tried together “in a\n\ncomplex case” and “have markedly different degrees of culpability.” Sarracino,\n\n340 F.3d at 1165 (quoting Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). However, “neither ‘a mere allegation that defendant would have a\n\nbetter chance of acquittal in a separate trial’ nor an argument that evidence\n\nagainst one defendant would have a ‘spillover effect’ on another defendant\n\ndemonstrates prejudice.” United States v. Jones, 530 F.3d 1292, 1303 (10th Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting United States v. Small, 423 F.3d 1164, 1182 (10th Cir. 2005)).\n\n      The district court is the primary referee on severance claims, for we, as an\n\nappellate court, have only a distant view of the ring. “Rule 14 leaves the\n\ndetermination of risk of prejudice and any remedy for such prejudice to the sound\n\n                                          -51-\n\fdiscretion of the district court,” Morales, 108 F.3d at 1220, and “[a] defendant\n\nseeking to vacate a conviction based upon the denial of a motion to sever faces a\n\nsteep challenge,” Pursley, 577 F.3d at 1215; see United States v. Wardell, 591\n\nF.3d 1279, 1299 (10th Cir. 2009). “We review the district court’s denial of a\n\nmotion to sever for an abuse of discretion.” Pursley, 577 F.3d at 1215 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Hall, 473 F.3d 1295, 1302 (10th Cir. 2007)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n             b. Inability to Compel Mr. Gordon’s Testimony\n\n      Mr. Clark asserts that his inability to compel Mr. Gordon’s testimony at\n\ntheir joint trial violated his confrontation rights. He argues that, without Mr.\n\nGordon as a witness, he “did not have the opportunity to rebut [Mr.] Gordon’s\n\notherwise hearsay statement about [Mr.] Clark being ‘heat resistant,’” which was\n\n“the most significant statement” used against him. Aplt. Opening Br. at 19. He\n\nalso states that the joint trial “greatly affected” his own decision not to testify in\n\nhis defense. Id.\n\n      In this context, to determine whether the district court abused its discretion\n\nin denying a severance motion, we look to a nonexhaustive list of factors dubbed\n\nthe “McConnell factors.” See Pursley, 577 F.3d at 1215 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). These are:\n\n             1) the likelihood that the co-defendant would in fact testify at the\n             movant’s severed trial and waive his Fifth Amendment privilege;\n             2) the significance of the testimony in relation to the defendant’s\n\n                                             -52-\n\f             theory of defense; 3) the exculpatory nature and effect of such\n             testimony; 4) the likelihood that the co-defendant’s testimony\n             would be impeached; 5) the extent of prejudice caused by the\n             absence of the testimony; 6) the effect of a severance on judicial\n             administration and economy; [and] 7) the timeliness of the\n             motion.\n\nId. at 1215–16 (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. McConnell, 749\n\nF.2d 1441, 1445 (10th Cir. 1984)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Under this rubric, Mr. Clark offers nothing that would permit us to\n\nmeaningfully evaluate the district court’s severance decision. For instance, he\n\nmakes no argument concerning the likelihood that Mr. Gordon would have agreed\n\nto testify at Mr. Clark’s separate trial. Nor does he explain what the significance\n\nor exculpatory value of that testimony would have been, or articulate how he was\n\nprejudiced by the absence of such testimony.\n\n      Mr. Clark provides only the conclusory, unilluminating assertions that he\n\ncould have “rebut[ted]” Mr. Gordon’s reference to him as being “heat resistant”\n\nand that the joint trial “greatly affected” his own decision not to testify. Aplt.\n\nOpening Br. at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted). As to the latter contention,\n\nhe does not explain whether he would have actually testified, or as to what\n\nmatters his testimony would have been relevant. Cf. United States v. Lindsey, 782\n\nF.2d 116, 118 (8th Cir. 1986) (concluding that the defendant failed to show that\n\nhe was prejudiced by the district court’s failure to sever his counts of conviction,\n\neven though he argued that he would have testified at a separate trial, because he\n\n\n                                         -53-\n\ffailed to make “a convincing showing that he ha[d] both important testimony to\n\ngive concerning one count and a strong need to refrain from testifying on the\n\nother”).\n\n      Furthermore, Mr. Clark has pointed to no basis for a conclusion that Mr.\n\nGordon’s admitted comments would have been subject to an effective counter-\n\nattack in a separate trial. “[S]peculation is insufficient to require severance.”\n\nPursley, 577 F.3d at 1216; see Hall, 473 F.3d at 1302 (holding that the district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying a motion for severance where the\n\ndefendant had not shown that the exculpatory value of a co-defendant’s testimony\n\nin a separate trial could have made a material difference); United States v. Powell,\n\n982 F.2d 1422, 1433 (10th Cir. 1992) (concluding that there was no abuse of\n\ndiscretion in the district court’s denial of severance even where a co-defendant\n\nsigned an affidavit indicating that he would testify because the “testimony would\n\ntotally lack credibility” in light of “[t]he overwhelming evidence at trial” against\n\nthe co-defendant that would impeach him). With effectively nothing to go on\n\nfrom Mr. Clark, and in light of our preference for joint co-conspirator trials, see\n\nPursley, 577 F.3d at 1215, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying severance on this ground.\n\n             c. Spillover Effect of Evidence Against Co-defendants\n\n      Mr. Clark further argues that evidence introduced against his co-defendants\n\nhad a spillover effect that prejudiced his defense. He points in particular to Mr.\n\n                                         -54-\n\fLindberg’s testimony that persistently referred to “the group” but “barely\n\nmentioned” Mr. Clark. Aplt. Opening Br. at 15 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). However, Mr. Lindberg specifically described Mr. Clark’s involvement\n\nin the conspiracy at several points during his testimony. See, e.g., R., Vol. VIII,\n\nat 174–75 (noting that Mr. Clark was “one of those people” that “kept money”\n\nwhen the conspirators started dumping Deep Rock stock); id. at 186 (noting that\n\nMr. Gordon recommended installing Mr. Clark as president of the company that\n\nwas ultimately called Global Beverage because “he’s been a good soldier in the\n\npast and he’s heat-resistant”); id. at 212 (responding to a question asking whether\n\nMr. Clark sold Deep Rock stock out of turn again, after Mr. Gordon admonished\n\nhim, “I don’t believe he did”). The evidence shows that Mr. Clark was involved\n\nand cooperated with his co-defendants in, and substantially profited from, the\n\nillegal scheme. Simply put, the evidence against Mr. Clark and his co-defendants\n\nwas “overlapping and intertwined.” Morales, 108 F.3d at 1220; see United States\n\nv. Zapata, 546 F.3d 1179, 1192 (10th Cir. 2008) (concluding that there was no\n\nprejudice stemming from a risk of “spillover” evidence in a conspiracy trial\n\nbecause “there was clear and direct testimony at trial that specifically implicated\n\n[the defendant] in the conspiracy”); see also Wardell, 591 F.3d at 1300 (“[T]he\n\nnearly insuperable rule in this circuit is that a defendant cannot obtain severance\n\nsimply by showing that the evidence against a co-defendant is more damaging\n\nthan the evidence against herself.” (quoting United States v. Dazey, 403 F.3d\n\n                                        -55-\n\f1147, 1165 (10th Cir. 2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n      Finally, although Mr. Gordon was charged with three additional counts in\n\nthe twenty-four count indictment, the facts relating to the separate counts did not\n\nrender null the jury’s ability “to segregate the evidence associated with each\n\ndefendant’s individual actions.” Zapata, 546 F.3d at 1191. The district court\n\ninstructed the jury to segregate out evidence that was not directed at Mr. Clark,\n\nsee R., Vol. VIII, at 2516–17 (Jury Instructions, given Apr. 29, 2010), and Mr.\n\nClark has not articulated any reason why the jury was unable to follow the\n\ninstructions in this respect, see Zapata, 546 F.3d at 1191–92 (suggesting that the\n\ndistrict court’s instruction limited the prejudice of any “spillover” to a defendant\n\nthat might result from counts concerning his co-defendants); see also Caldwell,\n\n560 F.3d at 1213 (“We presume that the jury obey[s] [its] instructions.”).\n\n      We thus reject Mr. Clark’s claim of prejudicial spillover and conclude that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying severance on this ground.\n\n             d. Absent Co-defendants\n\n      Finally, Mr. Clark claims that conducting the trial with absent\n\nco-defendants—specifically, Dean Sheptycki, the creator of much of the\n\npromotional material, and Josh Lankford—violated his rights. Under indictment\n\nfor the pump-and-dump conspiracy, Mr. Sheptycki was apprehended in the\n\nBahamas, but the Bahamian government declined to honor the government’s\n\nextradition request, so he was not present for the trial. Also indicted,\n\n                                         -56-\n\fco-conspirator Lankford’s whereabouts were unknown at the time of trial and the\n\ngovernment classified him as a fugitive. Neither Mr. Sheptycki nor Mr. Lankford\n\nwas actually tried by the government in absentia in the case, but there was\n\nconsiderable evidence detailing their roles in the charged conspiracy. Mr. Clark\n\ncomplains that his legal rights were infringed because he was “unable to cross-\n\nexamine or otherwise confront” Mr. Lankford and Mr. Sheptycki. Aplt. Opening\n\nBr. at 18. We reject this claim.\n\n      Standing alone, Mr. Clark’s assertions do not satisfy his “‘heavy burden’ of\n\nshowing ‘real prejudice.’” Wardell, 591 F.3d at 1299 (quoting McConnell, 749\n\nF.2d at 1444). He does not explain how the absence of Messrs. Sheptycki and\n\nLankford “compromise[d] a specific trial right” of his—including his right of\n\ncross-examination under the Confrontation Clause 17—or “prevent[ed] the jury\n\nfrom making a reliable judgment about [his] guilt or innocence.” Stiger, 413 F.3d\n\nat 1197 (emphasis added) (quoting United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d 419, 434\n\n(10th Cir. 1995)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Simply pointing out that certain co-defendants were absent does not suffice.\n\nCf. United States v. Edmonson, 962 F.2d 1535, 1545 (10th Cir. 1992) (holding\n\n\n      17\n             Mr. Clark’s arguments on this issue are decidedly speculative. See,\ne.g., Aplt. Opening Br. at 18 (“[Mr.] Clark, at the very least, deserves a trial\nwhere either evidence of statements or actions that could be considered\nstatements by Lankford and/or Sheptycki are excluded.” (emphasis added)). He\npoints to no evidence offered by the government that would violate his\nconfrontation rights.\n\n                                        -57-\n\fthat absence of co-defendant tried in absentia “did not have a significant adverse\n\nimpact upon the case” and thus “it would obviously [have been] unnecessary for\n\nthe trial judge to grant a severance”); cf. also United States v. Tarango, 396 F.3d\n\n666, 674 (5th Cir. 2005) (“[A defendant is] not prejudiced simply by the fact that\n\nher co-defendant [i]s being tried in absentia.”); Murr v. United States, 200 F.3d\n\n895, 904 (6th Cir. 2000) (“Petitioner has not made the required showing of\n\nfactually specific and compelling prejudice as a result of the joint trial. He offers\n\nabsolutely no evidence in support of his claim that [the co-defendant’s] absence\n\nconstituted extreme prejudice to him in that the jury assumed that [the\n\nco-defendant’s] absence indicated that Petitioner was guilty.”). 18 We conclude\n\nthat the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying severance on this\n\nground.\n\n\n      18\n              We pause briefly to note that Mr. Clark also intimates that he was\nprejudiced because his name appeared on the jury verdict forms along with\nMessrs. Sheptycki and Lankford. See Aplt. Opening Br. at 19–20. We do not\nconstrue Mr. Clark as presenting a distinct ground of error by this suggestion, in\nthat it appears as a tangential remark in the section of his brief addressing the\nalleged prejudicial spill-over effect caused by the introduction of evidence related\nto his co-conspirators. However, even if it were an assertion of error, we would\nconclude that it is waived. When the issue of verdict forms came up before the\ndistrict court, Mr. Clark specifically requested, over the government’s insistence\nto the contrary, that Mr. Sheptycki’s and Mr. Lankford’s names remain on the\nforms. See R., Vol. VIII, at 2403–06 (Trial Tr., dated Apr. 27, 2010). Thus, Mr.\nClark would have invited any error associated with the inclusion of the two men’s\nnames on the verdict form and, consequently, waived any appellate challenge\nregarding the matter. See, e.g., United States v. Teague, 443 F.3d 1310, 1317–18\n(10th Cir. 2006) (holding that a party waives an issue for appeal when he\n“‘invites’ an error by suggesting that the court take particular action”).\n\n                                         -58-\n\fE.    Speedy Trial Act\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the\n\nindictment pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161–3174, primarily\n\nbecause the court’s March 10, 2009, ends-of-justice continuance “was\n\ninadequate.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 23.\n\n      Roughly two weeks after the indictment was unsealed, the government filed\n\nan unopposed motion to declare the case “complex” under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h) in\n\nlight of the massive pending discovery and complex legal issues presented. On\n\nMarch 10, the district court granted the motion, concluding that the “ends of\n\njustice” outweighed the public’s interest in a speedy trial. More specifically,\n\nnoting that it had considered the statutory factors and our precedent, the court\n\nstated:\n\n             The substantial volume of discovery supports the government’s\n             argument that this case is unusually complex and, with counsel\n             exercising due diligence, will require more than the 70 days\n             provided by the Act for the parties to prepare for trial. It would\n             not be reasonable to expect defense counsel to review the\n             voluminous evidence, prepare pretrial motions, and adequately\n             represent their clients at trial in less than 70 days. Failure to\n             treat this case as a complex case would deny counsel for all\n             parties time to prepare, and this consideration outweighs\n             defendant’s interest in a speedy trial.\n\n             . . . While a speedy resolution of criminal cases serves the public\n             interest, it does not benefit the public if a complex criminal case\n             is rushed and a miscarriage of justice results. Given the complex\n             nature of these proceedings, the ends-of-justice served by treating\n             this as a complex case outweigh the public’s interest in a speedy\n             trial.\n\n                                            -59-\n\fR., Vol. I, at 121 (Order Granting Unopposed Mot. of the United States to Declare\n\nThis Case a Complex Matter, filed Mar. 10, 2009). In that order, it struck the\n\ninitial trial date. Then, through entry of a minute order one week later, the court\n\nset the trial date for January 19, 2010.\n\n      After reassignment, the new district judge (i.e., Judge Payne) struck the\n\nJanuary 19 trial date. On March 17, 2010, Mr. Clark and Mr. Gordon filed a joint\n\nmotion to dismiss the indictment under the Speedy Trial Act, challenging, inter\n\nalia, the validity of the court’s ends-of-justice continuance. The district court\n\ndenied the motion, and the trial began on April 5, 2010.\n\n      “The Speedy Trial Act . . . requires that a criminal defendant’s trial\n\ncommence within 70 days after he is charged or makes an initial appearance,\n\nwhichever is later . . . .” 19 Bloate v. United States, 559 U.S. 196, 198–99 (2010);\n\naccord United States v. Loughrin, 710 F.3d 1111, 1119 (10th Cir. 2013); United\n\nStates v. Larson, 627 F.3d 1198, 1203 (10th Cir. 2010). The Act excludes\n\n“certain enumerated events” from this time period, see Bloate, 559 U.S. at 199\n\n(discussing 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)), such as “proceedings concerning the\n\ndefendant,” 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1), and time which the court determines should\n\n\n      19\n             Mr. Clark agrees that the seventy-day clock under the Act\ncommenced on the day the indictment was unsealed, because that was when he\nfirst appeared before the court. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1) (noting “the trial of a\ndefendant charged in an information or indictment . . . shall commence within\nseventy days from the filing date (and making public) of the information or\nindictment” (emphasis added)).\n\n                                           -60-\n\fbe excluded because “the ends of justice served by the granting of such\n\ncontinuance outweigh the best interests of the public and the defendant in a\n\nspeedy trial,” id. § 3161(h)(7)(A). See also Loughrin, 710 F.3d at 1119 (noting\n\nthat “not every day counts towards the seventy-day limit because of a multitude\n\nof statutory exclusions”). The Act permits exclusion of time under\n\n§ 3161(h)(7)(A) to serve the ends of justice where “the case is so unusual or so\n\ncomplex . . . that it is unreasonable to expect adequate preparation for pretrial\n\nproceedings or for the trial itself within the time limits established by [the Act].”\n\nId. § 3161(h)(7)(B)(ii).\n\n      We review the district court’s decision to grant a continuance in the “ends\n\nof justice” for an abuse of discretion. See United States v. Toombs, 574 F.3d\n\n1262, 1268 (10th Cir. 2009) (“We apply an abuse of discretion standard to a\n\ndistrict court’s decision to grant an ends-of-justice continuance.” (quoting United\n\nStates v. Gonzales, 137 F.3d 1431, 1433 (10th Cir. 1998)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted)). “At the same time, we review the district court’s compliance\n\nwith the Act de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.” Loughrin, 710 F.3d\n\nat 1117; see Toombs, 574 F.3d at 1268 (noting that we “review[] de novo . . . the\n\ndistrict court’s compliance with the legal requirements of the Speedy Trial Act”).\n\n      Mr. Clark narrowly frames his argument, challenging the district court’s\n\nMarch 10 ends-of-justice order, claiming that the order did not “set[] forth and\n\njustify[] any specific time period for the continuance,” Aplt. Opening Br. at\n\n                                         -61-\n\f22–23, and was otherwise conclusory and lacking in the detail required by the\n\nAct. We are not persuaded by Mr. Clark’s arguments.\n\n      First, Mr. Clark does not explain why the district court’s failure to specify\n\nimmediately a trial date when it entered the March 10 ends-of-justice continuance\n\norder constituted legal error, and we discern no foundation for that notion.\n\nIndeed, we have expressly held that “while it is preferable to set a specific ending\n\ndate for a continuance, . . . an open-ended continuance for a reasonable time\n\nperiod is permissible.” United States v. Spring, 80 F.3d 1450, 1458 (10th Cir.\n\n1996); see, e.g., United States v. Santiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d 11, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (“Open-ended continuances are not prohibited per se.”). In assessing\n\nwhether an open-ended continuance was terminated (i.e., delimited by a definite\n\nend date) in a reasonable time frame, courts naturally look beyond the\n\ncontinuance order itself to other documents in the record associated with it. See\n\nSpring, 80 F.3d at 1458; see also United States v. Ross, 703 F.3d 856, 877 (6th\n\nCir. 2012) (“[T]he latter order’s reference to ‘the new trial date’ was not an\n\n‘open-ended period’ but was merely a reference to the new, June 24, 2008 trial\n\ndate specified in the former order. These orders satisfy the statutory\n\nrequirements.”).\n\n      To the extent that the March 10 order created an open-ended continuance, a\n\nsurvey of the record reveals that the district court supplied a concrete end date\n\n(i.e., a trial date of January 19) in its minute order with virtually no delay—viz.,\n\n                                         -62-\n\fone week later. This week was clearly a reasonable period. See Spring, 80 F.3d\n\nat 1458 (“The new trial date was set, thereby providing a specific ending date to\n\nthe continuance, eleven days later . . . . Given the circumstances of this case, the\n\nopen-ended continuance initially granted was reasonable in length.”).\n\n        Furthermore, focusing on Mr. Clark’s challenge to the adequacy of the\n\ndistrict court’s findings, we reject Mr. Clark’s assertion that they were conclusory\n\nand insufficient under our case law. When analyzing the terms of the same order\n\nin our Gordon decision, we concluded that the district court properly struck the\n\nends-of-justice balance to justify the continuance of the trial date to January 19,\n\n2010, and that conclusion is controlling here. See 710 F.3d at 1158–59.\n\n        In sum, we find no merit in Mr. Clark’s speedy trial challenges and reject\n\nthem.\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Mr. Clark’s conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -63-\n\f",

Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      This case arises from a classic pump-and-dump scheme that was\n\norchestrated principally by Mr. Clark’s co-defendant, George David Gordon. In a\n\nseparate opinion, we recently affirmed Mr. Gordon’s convictions and sentence.\n\nSee United States v. Gordon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2013). In doing so, we set\n\nforth in considerable detail the relevant factual and procedural background related\n\nto the government’s prosecution of the pump-and-dump scheme. See id. at\n\n1128–33. Consequently, we will not fully reiterate that discussion here. Instead,\n\nwe offer at the outset a factual and procedural overview, and then in connection\n\nwith the resolution of Mr. Clark’s specific legal challenges, we explicate\n\nnecessary additional facts. 1\n\n\n      1\n             In Gordon, we quoted in part the indictment’s description of the\ngeneral nature of a pump-and-dump scheme, 710 F.3d at 1128 n.2; it is also useful\nto do so here:\n\n              A pump and dump scheme involves the artificial manipulation of\n              the price and volume of a particular stock in order to later sell\n              that stock at an artificially inflated price. Generally, the\n              perpetrators of a pump and dump scheme obtain control over a\n              substantial portion of free trading shares of the company. Free\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      In summary, the government alleged that Messrs. Gordon and Clark and\n\nother co-conspirators manipulated the shares of several “penny-stock” companies\n\nby using false and backdated documents to make those shares publicly tradeable,\n\nengaged in coordinated trading among themselves to create the false appearance\n\nof an active market for the shares, and promoted the shares through misleading\n\npromotional campaigns. See, e.g., id. at 1128 & n.2. The shares were sold to\n\n      1\n          (...continued)\n                trading shares are shares of stock that the owner can trade\n                without restriction on a national exchange, e.g., the New York\n                Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, or are traded in the over-the-\n                counter market via the Pink Sheets. To obtain the free trading\n                shares, the perpetrators may orchestrate a reverse merger, which\n                occurs when a privately held company with no publicly traded\n                stock merges with a publicly listed shell company that has no\n                assets or revenue but has stock available for public trading,\n                resulting in a public company. The pump usually involves\n                artificially inflating a company’s stock price by engaging in\n                coordinated trading of the stock in order to create the appearance\n                of a more active market for that stock. The pump also usually\n                involves disseminating false and misleading promotional\n                materials—unsolicited advertisements touting a particular stock\n                and encouraging others to purchase the stock, which are often\n                sent to millions of recipients by fax or email “blasts.” After\n                pumping the stock, the perpetrators dump their shares, meaning\n                they sell large volumes of the shares that they own and control to\n                unsuspecting investors. The dumping often occurs soon after the\n                dissemination of the promotional materials touting the particular\n                company. The perpetrators of a pump and dump scheme will\n                often “park” their shares by depositing or transferring them into\n                different accounts, including nominees’ accounts, and then trade\n                the manipulated stock using the different accounts in order to\n                conceal their trading activity.\n\n\nR., Vol. I, at 55–56 (Indictment, filed Jan. 15, 2009).\n\n                                            -3-\n\funsuspecting buyers after their prices had surged, and the conspirators laundered\n\nthe proceeds through an array of bank accounts and nominees. The conspirators\n\nsubsequently covered up their misconduct in interactions with the Securities and\n\nExchange Commission (“SEC”).\n\nA.    Investigation and Pretrial Proceedings\n\n      The conduct in this case can be traced back to 2004 when Mr. Gordon\n\nbegan dealing with Mark Lindberg and Joshua Lankford, two Dallas stock\n\npromoters—both co-conspirators—and collaboratively targeting with them\n\nvarious companies for the fraudulent scheme’s purposes. Through a sequence of\n\ntransactions, the conspirators established and fraudulently promoted the stock of\n\nthree companies: National Storm Management (“National Storm”), Deep Rock Oil\n\n& Gas (“Deep Rock”), and Global Beverage Company (“Global Beverage”). See\n\nid. at 1129–32.\n\n      In 2004, SEC official Samuel Draddy began looking into an unrelated Pink\n\nSheet 2 company that had “unusual trading surrounding its stock and appeared to\n\nbe the subject of a promotional campaign.” R., Vol. VIII, at 1753 (Test. of\n\nSamuel Draddy, dated Apr. 15, 2010). This led to further investigation of other\n\n\n      2\n             “The Pink Sheets are a daily publication of the National Quotation\nBureau (NQB), a private company. Printed on pink paper, the pink sheets list\npenny stocks, their marketmakers, and their price.” United States v. Sneed, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677822\"><a href=\"/opinion/677822/united-states-v-steven-sneed/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1575 n.7 (10th Cir. 1994); see also Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1130\n(describing the Pink Sheet system and noting that Pink Sheet companies are “not\nrequired to file periodic reports with the SEC”).\n\n                                        -4-\n\f“similarly-situated [stock] issuers” with unusual trading patterns and promotional\n\ncampaigns. Id.\n\n      After taking a deeper look, investigators noticed that the companies under\n\nconsideration evinced similar patterns where “the people involved owned shells,\n\n[that] were publicly-traded issuers that had no legitimate business purpose, . . .\n\n[and] [t]hey would . . . get private companies to reverse-merge into these shells so\n\nthey could get publicly traded.” Id. at 1754; see also id., Vol. I, at 55 (noting in\n\nthe instant indictment that “[t]o obtain the free trading shares, the perpetrators\n\nmay orchestrate a reverse merger, which occurs when a privately held company\n\nwith no publicly traded stock merges with a publicly listed shell company that has\n\nno assets or revenue but has stock available for public trading, resulting in a\n\npublic company”). Based on this discovery, the investigators turned their\n\nattention to the activities of the companies involved in this case. During that\n\ninvestigation, Mr. Clark testified before the SEC. He made various statements,\n\nincluding an allegedly false denial that he controlled nominee entities involved in\n\nthe Deep Rock trading scheme.\n\n      In July 2007, approximately eighteen months prior to the commencement of\n\ncriminal proceedings against Mr. Clark, the government placed a caveat on his\n\nresidence. See generally Black’s Law Dictionary 252 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\n\n“caveat” as “[a] warning or proviso”). No notice was given to Mr. Clark at that\n\ntime, and he was not aware of the caveat until July 2008 “when he was attempting\n\n                                          -5-\n\fto obtain funds to retain counsel.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 2. The government\n\ntemporarily lifted the caveat in June 2009 to allow Mr. Clark to renew an existing\n\nloan on his home, and reimposed it in July 2009. The government then\n\ncompletely lifted the caveat in October 2009.\n\n      On January 15, 2009, the grand jury returned a twenty-four-count\n\nindictment against the members of the conspiracy, including Mr. Clark. Mr.\n\nClark was named in Counts 1–21: specifically, conspiracy (Count 1), in violation\n\nof 18 U.S.C. § 371; wire fraud (Counts 2–10), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1343\n\nand 2(a); securities fraud (Counts 11–15), in violation of 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b),\n\n78ff, 17 C.F.R. § 2401.10b-5, and 18 U.S.C. § 2(a); and money laundering\n\n(Counts 16–21), in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1957(a) and 2(a).\n\nB.    Trial\n\n      At trial, 3 the government called witnesses to summarize the details of the\n\nconspiracy, including Mr. Lindberg and Richard Singer (another co-conspirator);\n\nboth men had pleaded guilty to criminal offenses related to the conspiracy. SEC\n\nInvestigator Draddy testified about the promotional campaigns and Mr. Clark’s\n\ntestimony before the SEC. Other witnesses were called to summarize\n\n\n\n      3\n              The district court ordered a continuance under the Speedy Trial Act\nand set the trial date for January 19, 2010. The presiding judge later recused\nhimself in late 2009, and Judge James Payne was assigned to the case. Judge\nPayne then reset the trial date to March 29, 2010. The trial ultimately began on\nApril 5, 2010.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fdocumentary evidence. Mr. Clark unsuccessfully moved to sever his trial from\n\nMr. Gordon’s due to the alleged potential for a prejudicial spillover of evidence\n\nthat was admitted concerning both Mr. Gordon and the other co-conspirators. Mr.\n\nClark ultimately was convicted of fourteen of the twenty-one counts for which he\n\nwas indicted. He was sentenced to 151 months’ imprisonment. 4\n\n                                   II. Discussion\n\n      Mr. Clark asserts numerous grounds of error. He claims that the pretrial\n\nplacement of the caveat on his property violated his constitutional rights and that\n\nthe evidence was insufficient to convict him. He further contests the district\n\ncourt’s refusal to appoint an additional or a substitute defense counsel who was\n\nwell versed in complex securities matters and the court’s failure to sever his trial\n\nfrom Mr. Gordon’s. He also contends that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act\n\nwere violated by the roughly fourteen-month delay between the filing of the\n\nindictment and commencement of trial. We address each contention but discern\n\n\n      4\n             The government seeks to supplement the record under seal with\nmultiple sentencing documents that are not included in the parties’ appendices.\nMost of these documents are interim versions of Mr. Gordon’s pre-sentence\ninvestigation report and the district court’s Statement of Reasons for imposing\nsentence in his case. One document in particular relates to Mr. Clark’s appeal: an\naddendum to his pre-sentence report. We already have resolved the motion as it\npertains to Mr. Gordon’s case, granting it in part. See Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1160\nn.35. Mr. Clark does not object to supplementing the record with his pre-sentence\naddendum. With this in mind, we grant in part the motion with respect to the\naddendum. The rest of the motion does not directly implicate Mr. Clark or our\nresolution of his appeal and, therefore, we deny the remainder of the motion as\nmoot.\n\n                                         -7-\n\fno reversible error.\n\nA.    Constitutional Challenges Arising from the Government’s Caveat\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that “[t]he government violated [his] constitutional rights\n\nto due process and a fair trial” in its pre-indictment decision to place a caveat on\n\nhis home, without notice. Aplt. Opening Br. at 6. By the time the government\n\nlifted the caveat on Mr. Clark’s home, he claims that he had no income because of\n\nthe government’s other post-indictment restrictions on his business\n\nactivities—viz., restrictions concerning his ability to liquidate various stock\n\nholdings. Therefore, Mr. Clark allegedly was unable to pay for chosen counsel\n\nand unable to secure a loan against his house for the same purpose. 5\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that the government acted wrongfully in imposing the\n\ncaveat on his house. He reasons that his house was not forfeitable property. 6 As\n\n      5\n             Mr. Clark contends that the October 2009 release of the caveat was\ndone “with the express condition that no new funds could be advanced on the\nhome.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 6. The government counters that Mr. Clark is\n“wrong” and that the condition of which he speaks applied to the earlier,\ntemporary release in June 2009, not the release in October 2009, which was\nunconditional. See Aplee. Br. at 46. The government’s position is supported by\nthe record (indeed, by a motion filed by Mr. Clark’s attorneys in the district\ncourt). See R., Vol. I, 178 (Am. Mot. & Br. to Withdraw as Counsel, filed Nov.\n18, 2009) (“On October 2, 2009, the Government lifted the caveat on Mr. Clark’s\nhome.”).\n      6\n              “The key to whether property is forfeitable is whether it is ‘involved\nin’ or ‘traceable to’ the offense.” United States v. Bornfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"156336\"><a href=\"/opinion/156336/united-states-v-bornfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1135\n(10th Cir. 1998) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1)). Mr. Clark contends that, at\nmost, his house was “substitute property” that was off-limits to the government\nunless and until he was convicted, citing our decision in United States v. Jarvis,\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         -8-\n\fa consequence, once the caveat was imposed, he contends, the Due Process\n\nClause of the Fifth Amendment, as interpreted in our decision in United States v.\n\nJones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759210\"><a href=\"/opinion/759210/united-states-v-shirley-a-jones-mega-universal-oxygen-and-home-care/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1998), required a post-restraint, pretrial hearing on\n\nwhether the house was in fact forfeitable property—a hearing that Mr. Clark says\n\nhe was wrongfully denied.\n\n\n\n      6\n       (...continued)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169682\"><a href=\"/opinion/169682/united-states-v-jarvis/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1196</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2007). In resolving Mr. Gordon’s appeal, we had\noccasion to explicate the concept of substitute property and the contours of\nJarvis’s holding regarding it. We stated:\n\n             [I]n order for the government to forfeit substitute property, it\n             must establish that through “any act or omission of the\n             defendant” one of five things has occurred—for example,\n             forfeitable property cannot be located through the exercise of due\n             diligence, or such property has been placed beyond the\n             jurisdiction of the court. 21 U.S.C. § 853(p)(1). Furthermore,\n             we reasoned in Jarvis that because the government has no pre-\n             conviction interest in substitute property, it may not impose pre-\n             trial restraints on a defendant’s substitute property.\n\n\nGordon, 710 F.3d at 1136 n.14. In contrast, as we further noted in Gordon:\n\n             Assets that are properly forfeitable are not the defendant’s\n             rightful property. As ill-gotten gains, they are another person’s\n             money. Indeed, these assets may belong to the government by\n             virtue of the relation-back provision of 21 U.S.C. § 853(c), which\n             by operation of law vests title to forfeitable property in the\n             government upon the commission of the act giving rise to\n             forfeiture.\n\n\nId. at 1135 n.13 (quoting Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v.

Under\n\nthis rigorous standard, a defendant must demonstrate: “(1) an error, (2) that is\n\nplain, which means clear or obvious under current law, and (3) that affects\n\nsubstantial rights.

Pertinently, we reasoned that the “private\n\ninterests” at stake when access to property is impeded—specifically, the Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel of choice and the payment of living\n\n                                          -10-\n\fexpenses—together with the “risk of an erroneous deprivation through [pretrial\n\nrestraint procedures,]” weighed in favor of a post-restraint, pretrial adversarial\n\nhearing “at which the government must establish probable cause to believe that\n\nthe restrained assets are traceable to the underlying offense.” Id. at 646–47.\n\n      We noted, however, that “[d]ue process does not automatically require”\n\nsuch a hearing. Id. at 647. A hearing should be held “only upon a properly\n\nsupported motion by a defendant,” wherein he must (1) “demonstrate to the\n\ncourt’s satisfaction that []he has no assets, other than those restrained, with which\n\nto retain private counsel and provide for [him]self and [his] family”; and (2)\n\n“make a prima facie showing of a bona fide reason to believe the grand jury erred\n\nin determining that the restrained assets” are forfeitable property.

Jarvis, 499 F.3d at\n\n\n      7\n              To be sure, it is not clear that common law, public impediments like\ncaveats (or lis pendens) are functionally equivalent to the type of restraints\ntriggering our inquiry in Jones. For instance, in Jones, the government obtained a\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                         -11-\n\f1198–1200 (implying that a New Mexico lis pendens may constitute a\n\n“restraint”). However, even if it does, Mr. Clark faces a formidable—and,\n\nultimately, insurmountable—obstacle in pursuing this claim: Mr. Clark did not\n\nproperly seek a hearing prior to trial to vindicate his interests related to the\n\nimposition of the caveat, much less make an adequate showing for a hearing\n\nunder Jones’s standards. 8\n\n      7\n        (...continued)\nrestraining order under 21 U.S.C. § 853(e)(1)(A) to freeze assets named in the\nindictment. See 160 F.3d at 643. Furthermore, on a continuum of constraints,\ncommon law impediments—like a lis pendens or caveat—plainly do not amount\nto a full scale seizure of the underlying property, where the defendant has no\nresidual control over it. Cf. United States v. James Daniel Good Real Prop., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112914\"><a href=\"/opinion/112914/united-states-v-james-daniel-good-real-property/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">43</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 62 (1993) (holding that due process requires the government to “afford\nnotice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard before seizing real property\nsubject to civil forfeiture”). However, we are content to assume without deciding\nthat the placement of the Oklahoma caveat implicates our dictates in Jones—viz.,\nthat it constitutes a “restraint” presenting the right to a post-restraint, pretrial\nhearing. But cf. Stefan D. Cassella, Asset Forfeiture Law in the United States\n§ 17-8, at 526 & n.77 (2007) (collecting cases and noting that the “[t]he filing of\na lis pendens is not a restraint within the meaning of § 853(e)”).\n      8\n              We recognize that Mr. Clark contends that he did seek a Jones\nhearing. But he did not properly do so, if at all. In his opening brief, he claims\nthat “[a] post-restraint, pretrial hearing was requested by co-defendant David\nGordon (Dkt. 79) and incorporated by reference by Clark (Dkt. 78).” Aplt.\nOpening Br. at 8. The document to which Mr. Clark refers (i.e., the district\ncourt’s document 78) is his attorneys’ first motion to withdraw, or in the\nalternative, to sever or continue the trial. See R., Vol. I, at 171 (Mot. & Br. to\nWithdraw as Counsel, filed Nov. 17, 2009). There, his attorneys complained to\nthe court that the caveat on Mr. Clark’s home was “a proximate cause of Mr.\nClark’s inability to raise sufficient funds for his defense in this case.” Id. While\nthe motion noted that the government imposed the caveat without notice, see id.,\nnowhere in the document was a hearing requested, and it certainly did not make\nthe showing for a hearing mandated by Jones. As for the purported incorporation\n                                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                          -12-\n\f      8\n         (...continued)\nby reference, this document does not even reference Mr. Gordon’s hearing\nrequest. The incorporation by reference that Mr. Clark presumably seeks to direct\nus to is actually found on the third page of his amended motion to withdraw, or in\nthe alternative, to sever or continue the trial. Specifically, the motion states, “The\nGovernment’s heavy hand in the imposition of caveats is not restricted to its\nactions in respect of Mr. Clark. See motion of co-defendant David Gordon filed\nin this case November 17, 2009.” Id. at 179 (Am. Mot. & Br. to Withdraw as\nCounsel, filed Nov. 18, 2009). That is it. Nothing more. And Mr. Clark’s\ncounsel confirmed in oral argument that this is the extent of his purported\nincorporation by reference. See Oral Arg. at 21:15–22:35. However, in the\ndocument that Mr. Clark references, Mr. Gordon sought at least three forms of\nrelief, including an evidentiary hearing before the district court, citing Jones as\nsupportive authority. See R., Vol. X, at 29–31 (Def. David Gordon’s Mot. to\nDismiss, filed Nov. 17, 2009). Mr. Clark’s single, vague, and enigmatic sentence\nreferencing the whole document should not be deemed sufficient to have captured\nMr. Gordon’s specific Jones argument and placed it before the district court.\nIndeed, the sentence does not even amount to a bare-bones “me too” form of\nargument adoption (which would be questionable in itself here because it would\nnot offer a particularized showing regarding Mr. Clark’s circumstances). More\nspecifically, the sentence does not even mention a hearing request, or for that\nmatter any other specifics that might be found in Mr. Gordon’s filing.\n\n       Significantly, our independent examination of the district court’s\ndocuments suggests that the magistrate judge remarkably did manage to divine in\nMr. Clark’s filings a request for an evidentiary hearing “apparently to examine\nthe Government’s conduct in this and other cases relating to pretrial restraints on\na criminal defendant’s assets,” id, Vol. I, at 347 (Order, dated Dec. 9, 2009), and\ndenied relief. However, Mr. Clark is not well-postured on appeal to avail himself\nof the benefits of the magistrate judge’s impressive industriousness. Not only\ndoes Mr. Clark not discuss the magistrate judge’s order in connection with his due\nprocess/Jones challenge, he also fails (in his opening brief or otherwise) to\nfashion an argument for why this challenge should be deemed preserved for\nreview, based upon the magistrate judge’s decision to rule on his purported\nhearing request. And we certainly will not attempt to craft an argument of this\nsort for him. Accordingly, any such preservation argument is waived. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Bader, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799257\"><a href=\"/opinion/799257/united-states-v-bader/\"><span class=\"volume\">678</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 894 (10th Cir. 2012) (noting that defendant\n“devotes only a single sentence to [his] argument” in his opening brief and “[t]hat\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\n                                        -13-\n\f      Consequently, for this reason (and possibly another, see supra note 8), Mr.\n\nClark may have waived his due process challenge.

Furthermore, even if Mr. Clark had referenced the magistrate\njudge’s order and attempted before us to make a preservation argument based\nupon it with respect to his due process/Jones challenge, he would have another\nproblem: he did not file an objection to the magistrate judge’s denial of his\npurported request for a hearing. See R., Vol. I, at 348–51 (Objection to\nMagistrate’s Order, dated Dec. 15, 2009) (failing to address the hearing ruling).\nTherefore, under our firm waiver rule, appellate review of the hearing denial\nwould be barred. See, e.g., Morales-Fernandez v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166265\"><a href=\"/opinion/166265/morales-fernandez-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1116</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1119 (10th\nCir. 2005); In re Carpenter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159315\"><a href=\"/opinion/159315/carpenter-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1249</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1253 (10th Cir. 2000). When all is\nsaid and done, then, the best that Mr. Clark could ever hope for is plain-error\nreview of his due process claim—that is, his claim predicated on the district\ncourt’s purported failure to give him the opportunity to have a Jones hearing\nregarding the government’s imposition of a caveat. Going to great lengths to\nensure that, to the extent reasonably feasible and consistent with the adversary\nprocess, Mr. Clark has his day in court, as noted infra, we afford him this best-\ncase, plain-error scenario. Cf. Abernathy v. Wandes, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">713</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">538</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552 (10th Cir.\n2013) (noting that “the decision regarding what issues are appropriate to entertain\non appeal in instances of lack of preservation is discretionary” and proceeding to\nconsider petitioner’s argument “even though [it was] not obliged to do so” where\n“certain factors militate[d] in favor of considering [the argument at issue], but\nonly under the demanding plain-error standard”).\n\n                                          -14-\n\fcourt, we assume that Mr. Clark’s failure to properly seek a post-restraint, pretrial\n\nhearing under Jones amounted to a forfeiture. Even affording him this best-case\n\nscenario, Mr. Clark’s circumstances are rather grim: in order to prevail, he must\n\n“successfully run the gauntlet created by our rigorous plain-error standard of\n\nreview.” United States v. McGehee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"623364\"><a href=\"/opinion/623364/united-states-v-mcgehee/\"><span class=\"volume\">672</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 876 (10th Cir. 2012). This he\n\ncannot do. Mr. Clark cannot even establish the first prong of the plain-error test;\n\nin other words, he cannot demonstrate that the district court committed error at\n\nall.\n\n         Mr. Clark learned about the caveat in July 2008—a year after it had been\n\nimposed and six months prior to his indictment. But he never properly asked the\n\ndistrict court for a post-restraint hearing regarding the caveat under our decision\n\nin Jones. That is, he never filed the motion that Jones requires, never properly\n\nalerted the district court to his desire for a Jones hearing, and nowhere sought to\n\ndemonstrate that he could satisfy the test that Jones sets forth. Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court had no reason to conclude that Mr. Clark’s interests were in\n\njeopardy and required protection through a hearing. See Jones, 160 F.3d at 647\n\n(“[A] post-restraint, pretrial hearing [is required] only upon a properly supported\n\nmotion by a defendant. Due process does not automatically require a hearing\n\n. . . .”).\n\n         The procedures required by our decision in Jones are in place to protect a\n\ndefendant from an intrusion upon his property interest without due process. See\n\n                                          -15-\n\fid. at 645–46 (“[A] restraining order issued under section 853(e)(1)(A) deprives\n\none of property even though the assets named in the indictment are only frozen\n\nand may eventually be returned.”); cf. 21 U.S.C. § 853(e)(1). A defendant cannot\n\nsuccessfully establish that a district court’s decision deprived him of the\n\naffirmative protections inherent in a Jones hearing when the defendant has not\n\nproperly alerted the court to the need for such a hearing.

Accordingly, we conclude that Mr. Clark has not\n\nsatisfied the first prong of the plain-error test—viz., he has not shown that the\n\ndistrict court erred at all.\n\n       Mr. Clark suggests that he had no opportunity to lodge a challenge to the\n\ncaveat because he was not given adequate notice of its placement. However, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that Mr. Clark had notice of the caveat by July 2008, nearly\n\ntwo years before trial. Mr. Clark has not established that the government’s failure\n\nto give notice of placement of the caveat in 2007 affected his ability to vindicate\n\n                                         -16-\n\fhis interests in a timely fashion so as to facilitate retaining counsel.\n\nConsequently, we reject his due process claim—predicated upon the notion that\n\nthe district court wrongly failed to afford him a post-restraint, pretrial hearing in\n\norder to contest the caveat.\n\n      Finally, we note that Mr. Clark claims in passing that the placement of the\n\ncaveat “deprived [him] of his Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial,” and\n\n“violated [his] right to counsel.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 11–12. We reject these\n\narguments. First, we interpret Mr. Clark’s claim that he was denied a fair trial\n\nunder the Sixth Amendment as a duplicative pulsation of his arguments under\n\nJones. He provides nothing in his brief that would suggest that the argument\n\nsupports a separate averment of error on appeal.\n\n      Second, we also reject Mr. Clark’s claim that the government’s conduct\n\nimpermissibly infringed on his Sixth Amendment right to counsel of choice. Mr.\n\nClark failed to raise this claim in a legally cognizable manner before the district\n\ncourt. To be sure, in the amended motion to withdraw of Mr. Clark’s trial\n\ncounsel, counsel did suggest that the government’s conduct violated Mr. Clark’s\n\nSixth Amendment right to counsel. And, in positing a possible “solution” to the\n\ndilemma, Mr. Clark’s attorney set forth a number of hypothetical resolutions,\n\nincluding “dismissal of the charges against Mr. Clark at least for all of the\n\nreasons set forth in the David Gordon motion.” R., Vol. I, at 179.\n\n      However, the motion of Mr. Clark containing this comment was geared\n\n                                          -17-\n\fprimarily toward seeking either withdrawal of counsel because of Mr. Clark’s\n\nfailure to pay legal fees, or remedies so that Mr. Clark could obtain the necessary\n\nincome to compensate current counsel, i.e, severance or a continuance of trial.\n\nSee id. at 177 (seeking “withdraw[al],” “severance,” or “continuance”). This\n\nsingle, unadorned statement alluding to a separate, potential Sixth Amendment\n\nright-to-counsel claim could not reasonably alert the district court to such a claim,\n\nat least in the form that the claim is presented here. Indeed, both the magistrate\n\njudge (in resolving the motion) and the government (in responding) expressly\n\ndeclined to speculate on the contours of Mr. Clark’s allegations. See, e.g., id., at\n\n344 n.1 (“The Court declines to address this one-sentence unsupported suggestion\n\nthat the charges should be dismissed.”).\n\n      In sum, the district court was not afforded the “opportunity to consider the\n\nquestion.” United States v. Norman T, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"155534\"><a href=\"/opinion/155534/united-states-v-norman-t/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1099</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1106 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\nConsequently, we review it only for plain error, as we did Mr. Clark’s due\n\nprocess claim. See United States v. Lamirand, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"620300\"><a href=\"/opinion/620300/united-states-v-lamirand/\"><span class=\"volume\">669</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1091</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1098 n. 7 (10th\n\nCir. 2012).\n\n      Under plain-error review, at the very least, Mr. Clark’s claim fails under\n\nthe third prong. In making his skeletal right-to-counsel argument, like (his co-\n\ndefendant) Mr. Gordon, Mr. Clark relies on the district court and Second Circuit\n\ndecisions in the Stein criminal case. See United States v. Stein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1440930\"><a href=\"/opinion/1440930/united-states-v-stein/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d\n\nCir. 2008); United States v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D.N.Y. 2006); see also\n\n                                         -18-\n\fGordon, 710 F.3d at 1137 (noting that Mr. Gordon “heavily relies” on Stein).\n\nSimilar to the fate of Mr. Gordon’s argument, Mr. Clark’s right-to-counsel\n\nargument fails under the third prong for two principal reasons. First, Mr. Clark\n\n“has not demonstrated that he was denied access to funds to pay for his defense in\n\nany substantial sense; certainly, he has not demonstrated a magnitude of financial\n\ndeprivation anywhere close to that experienced by the Stein defendants.” Gordon,\n\n710 F.3d at 1138.\n\n      In this regard, it is significant that the district court found $225,214.81 of\n\nequity in Mr. Clark’s house—the property subject to the government’s caveat—to\n\nbe forfeitable property because certain “payments for remodeling and the\n\nmortgage” were proceeds “traceable . . . to the conspiracy.” R., Vol. VI, at 1047\n\n(Order for Criminal Forfeiture, filed Sep. 15, 2010). That finding has support in\n\nthe record. See id., Vol. II, at 45 (Aff. of William Robert Taylor, filed June 25,\n\n2010) (stating that a “significant amount” of the proceeds of stock sales directly\n\nat issue in the case “were paid directly out of [Mr. Clark’s] brokerage account for\n\nresidence related expenses”). And it significantly undercuts any suggestion that\n\nMr. Clark’s substantial rights were affected by any district court error in\n\naddressing the government’s caveat on his home.\n\n      In particular, nothing in the Constitution “requires Congress to permit a\n\ndefendant to use assets adjudged to be forfeitable to pay . . . legal fees.” United\n\nStates v. Monsanto, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112310\"><a href=\"/opinion/112310/united-states-v-monsanto/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 614 (1989); see Caplin & Drysdale, 491 U.S. at\n\n                                         -19-\n\f632 (rejecting the “claim of a Sixth Amendment right of criminal defendants to\n\nuse assets that are the Government’s—assets adjudged forfeitable . . . —to pay\n\nattorneys’ fees”). And, in his threadbare argument, Mr. Clark has not attempted\n\nto demonstrate that any remaining equity in his home—beyond the amount subject\n\nto forfeiture—would have materially assisted him in employing or paying\n\ncounsel. Accordingly, in light of the district court’s forfeiture finding regarding\n\nthe home, we would be hard-pressed to conclude that Mr. Clark satisfied the third\n\nprong of plain-error review.\n\n      Second, as in Gordon, Mr. Clark’s claim of prejudice is nigh eviscerated (if\n\nnot completely so) by his ongoing, active representation throughout his trial by\n\nthe counsel that he initially retained. See 710 F.3d at 1139 (“[U]nlike Stein, it is\n\nquite significant that Mr. Gordon’s counsel remained fully and actively engaged\n\nin the case throughout the entire trial court proceedings.”). More specifically, as\n\nwe recount in further detail infra (Part II.C), even prior to his indictment, Mr.\n\nClark retained a very experienced criminal defense attorney, Allen Smallwood,\n\nand Mr. Smallwood represented Mr. Clark throughout the trial proceedings. And,\n\neven a cursory examination of the trial transcript would reveal that Mr.\n\nSmallwood advocated for Mr. Clark “in a thorough and vigorous fashion.” Id.\n\nAccordingly, for this reason as well, Mr. Clark cannot demonstrate that any error\n\nby the district court affected his substantial rights (i.e., satisfied the third prong of\n\nplain error). In sum, for the foregoing reasons, we reject Mr. Clark’s\n\n                                          -20-\n\fconstitutional challenges that stem from the government’s imposition of a caveat\n\non his home.\n\nB.    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n      Mr. Clark challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on all of his counts of\n\nconviction. Mr. Clark was convicted of one count of conspiracy to commit wire\n\nfraud, securities fraud, and money laundering; seven counts of wire fraud; five\n\ncounts of securities fraud; and one count of money laundering. The district court\n\ndenied Mr. Clark’s motion for judgment of acquittal. We conclude that Mr.\n\nClark’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenges are without merit.\n\n      “In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence and denial of a motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal, this court reviews the record de novo to determine whether,\n\nviewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, any rational\n\ntrier of fact could have found the defendant guilty of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.” United States v.

See Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1129–32. Focusing then on Mr. Clark’s\n\nalleged role in that conspiracy, taken in the light most favorable to the\n\ngovernment, there was ample record evidence that he was an active participant in\n\nit. Mr. Clark was installed as Global Beverage’s president because he was “in\n\nwith the plan” to manipulate the stock. See R., Vol. VIII, at 186–87 (Test. of\n\nMark Lindberg, dated Apr. 7, 2010). In that role, he approved a misleading\n\nbrochure touting Global Beverage’s financial prospects; then, only a few months\n\nlater, he filed a report with the SEC questioning whether the company could\n\ncontinue as a going concern. See id. at 2291–93 (Test. of Jarom Gregory, dated\n\nApr. 26, 2010).\n\n      Furthermore, Mr. Clark and the nominee individuals or entities operating at\n\nhis behest were engaged in the bulk of the pre-promotion trading of Deep Rock\n\nshares that was designed to signal to the market a genuine interest in the stock in\n\norder to effect an artificial inflation of its price. He later profited significantly\n\nfrom the sale of the stock. Moreover, according to the testimony of Mr. Lindberg,\n\nMr. Clark was an active member of the conspiracy. And the evidence supported\n\nthe government’s charge that Mr. Clark lied to the SEC concerning a nominee\n\n                                          -23-\n\faccount that he used to buy and sell Deep Rock stock.\n\n      In sum, this evidence demonstrates both Mr. Clark’s extensive involvement\n\nin the conspiracy’s activities and his related intent to defraud investors. See\n\nUnited States v. Jenkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183562\"><a href=\"/opinion/183562/united-states-v-jenkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">633</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">788</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 804 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding that there\n\nwas sufficient evidence of intent to defraud investors, relating to an alleged\n\npump-and-dump conspiracy, where the defendant “helped create . . . offshore\n\ncorporations holding [the target company’s] stock, helped to sell the stock, and\n\nhelped to move the various proceeds to accounts controlled by [other\n\nco-conspirators], and, further, . . .

Opening Br. at 25 (quoting R., Vol. VIII, at 207–09)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). By way of background, consistent with the\n\noverall approach of the charged conspiracy, the conspirators were engaged in the\n\nmanipulation of Deep Rock’s stock price through the “coordinated trading” of its\n\nstock, and “part of the coordinated trading was to make sure that the stock [price]\n\nkept gradually going upwards.” R., Vol. VIII, at 207; see id. at 153 (noting that it\n\nwas the conspirators’ “plan for the steady, gradual growth of the stock price of\n\nDeep Rock”). Mr. Clark was detected by some of the conspirators selling Deep\n\nRock stock “out of turn” (presumably to make more short-term profits)—meaning\n\nthat he “sold more shares than what he should have and the stock actually stalled\n\nout” at a certain price, instead of continuing to gradually climb upward. Id. at\n\n207.\n\n       We conclude, however, that this fact—standing alone—does little to\n\nundercut the potency of the other evidence establishing Mr. Clark’s culpability\n\nfor the charged conspiracy. This is particularly true because Mr. Clark’s alleged\n\nact of rebellion was short-lived and pusillanimous. In this regard, the evidence\n\nshows that Mr. Clark did not continue selling out of turn; shortly after his\n\nco-conspirators learned of his conduct, Mr. Gordon, “took care of it” by\n\ncontacting Mr. Clark and getting him to “get back in line” with the conspirators’\n\nplan. Id. at 209, 211. Therefore, rather than suggesting to a rational factfinder\n\n                                        -25-\n\fthat Mr. Clark was not involved in the unlawful conspiratorial plan, this stock-\n\ntrading incident easily could have indicated that Mr. Clark’s knowing adherence\n\nto, and cooperation with, the conspiratorial plan was the rule, not the exception.\n\nSee United States v. Jackson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312816\"><a href=\"/opinion/312816/united-states-v-william-herman-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1167</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1173 (10th Cir. 1973) (“If the\n\nconspiracy is established and the convicted persons knowingly contributed their\n\nefforts in furtherance of it, then the convictions must stand.”); cf.

See United\n\nStates v. Rutland, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1251 (10th Cir. 2013) (“A person is a member\n\nof a conspiracy if he was aware of the common purpose, willingly participated in\n\nthe conspiracy, and intended to advance the purpose of the conspiracy.”).\n\n      In sum, there was sufficient evidence for any rational factfinder to\n\ndetermine that Mr. Clark was a member of the charged pump-and-dump\n\nconspiracy. Accordingly, we reject Mr. Clark’s sufficiency-of-the-evidence\n\n                                         -26-\n\fchallenge to the conspiracy charge. 9\n\n      2.     Wire Fraud\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that the evidence on the wire fraud charge was\n\ninsufficient to support his conviction because the government failed to prove that\n\nhe intended to defraud investors through his participation in the scheme. See\n\nUnited States v. Welch, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163404\"><a href=\"/opinion/163404/united-states-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1081</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1104 (10th Cir. 2003) (explaining that the\n\nelements of wire fraud include “an intent to defraud”). However, the evidence\n\nalready set forth is more than sufficient to support a rational jury’s finding that\n\nMr. Clark had an intent to defraud. 10\n\n      Mr. Clark makes much of the fact that, in the promotional materials that\n\nwere sent to potential buyers, he had no duty to disclose his intent to sell shares.\n\nDuty or not, the promotional materials contained false and misleading\n\ninformation. See, e.g., R., Vol. VIII, at 3144–48 (Test. of Mark Lindberg, dated\n\nApr. 6, 2010). Moreover, Mr. Clark was engaged in coordinated selling to inflate\n\n\n      9\n             Similarly, we reject Mr. Clark’s hollow assertion that “the evidence\npresented at trial . . . indicates that the price of the stock in the various companies\nincreased because of market events.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 26. While there were\nother factors apart from the fraudulent conduct of Mr. Clark and his\nco-conspirators that could have affected the stock prices, the jury was not\nrequired to necessarily conclude that they did. See Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1144\nn.22; cf. Jenkins, 633 F.3d at 802 (“Materiality in securities fraud does not\ndepend on demonstration of a market reaction to the misstatements.”).\n      10\n             The magnitude of the evidence—which implicates Mr. Clark, as well\nas Mr. Gordon—is further explicated in our decision resolving the Gordon appeal.\nSee, e.g., Gordon, 710 F.3d at 1142–44.\n\n                                         -27-\n\fthe sales price of stock, id. at 207–12; and he later profited significantly, id. at\n\n174–75. Any rational trier of fact could infer easily that Mr. Clark possessed a\n\nfraudulent intent based on this evidence. See Jenkins, 633 F.3d at 804.\n\n      3.     Securities Fraud\n\n      Mr. Clark further challenges the sufficiency of the evidence on the\n\nsecurities fraud counts (Counts 11–15). “Under 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), any person\n\nwho uses or employs a manipulative or deceptive device in connection with the\n\nsale of any security commits securities fraud.” Id. at 801–02. And Rule 10b-5,\n\nwhich implements § 78j(b), “forbids the making of ‘any untrue statement of a\n\nmaterial fact.’” Id. at 802 (quoting 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b)).\n\n      Mr. Clark does not allege that the evidence was insufficient on any specific\n\nelement of the securities fraud offense. Rather, he claims that the government\n\nfailed to establish securities fraud because (1) “there is always risk involved” in\n\ntrading penny stocks, (2) Mr. Clark had no duty to disclose in the promotional\n\nmaterials his intention to sell shares, and (3) the fact that he sold shares out of\n\nline with the rest of the group suggests that “he was not connected to any\n\nagreement to defraud.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 28. We reject the latter two\n\ncontentions for the reasons that we articulated supra in disposing of Mr. Clark’s\n\nchallenges to his conspiracy and wire fraud convictions.\n\n      As for the first contention, it may be quite true that trading in penny stocks\n\nis risky. See Hoxworth v. Blinder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711099\"><a href=\"/opinion/711099/fed-sec-l-rep-p-99009-bankr-l-rep-p-76764-dan-h-hoxworth-named/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 207 n.1 (10th Cir. 1996) (“‘Penny\n\n                                          -28-\n\fstocks’ are low-priced, high risk equity securities. The securities are frequently\n\ntraded outside well-established trading markets.” (emphasis added)); accord\n\nNewton v.

However, on this record, this fact is completely irrelevant. The\n\nmagnitude of the risk accompanying an investment does not mean its investors are\n\nany less harmed by fraudulent conduct; even investors who are inclined to tolerate\n\na great deal of risk are legally entitled under the securities laws to be protected\n\nfrom fraudulent conduct that distorts their picture of the material variables\n\nassociated with the investment.

Mr. Clark and his\n\nco-conspirators engaged in manipulations of penny stock that had just such a\n\ndistorting effect. Put simply, in light of the evidence against Mr. Clark, any\n\nrational trier of fact could conclude that he, along with others in the conspiracy,\n\ncommitted securities fraud.\n\n      4.     Money Laundering\n\n      Finally, of the six counts in the indictment relating to money laundering,\n\nthe jury convicted Mr. Clark of only one—Count 18; it alleged that the defendants\n\ntransmitted $245,000 of funds derived from the conspiracy. Mr. Clark challenges\n\nthe sufficiency of the evidence regarding this count, contending that there was no\n\n                                         -29-\n\fevidence that any transfer of funds forming the basis for this money laundering\n\ncharge directly involved him. The government concedes that Mr. Clark “was not\n\npersonally involved in the transaction on which his money laundering conviction\n\n. . . was based.” Aplee. Br. at 28. Instead, the government argues that Mr. Clark\n\nis liable under a Pinkerton theory.\n\n      Under the Supreme Court’s decision in Pinkerton v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104316\"><a href=\"/opinion/104316/pinkerton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646–48 (1946), “a defendant [may be held] responsible for the crimes of his\n\nco-conspirators, if those crimes are committed to help advance the conspiracy and\n\nare within the reasonably foreseeable scope of the conspiracy.” Irvin, 682 F.3d at\n\n1274; see also United States v.

As noted, the evidence supports the\n\nreasonable inference that Mr. Clark was an active member of the fraudulent\n\npump-and-dump conspiracy. Laundering the proceeds of such a conspiracy would\n\n“help advance the conspiracy,” Irvin, 682 F.3d at 1274, in that it would facilitate\n\nthe concealment of the source of the funds. See United States v. Massey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691028\"><a href=\"/opinion/691028/united-states-v-von-dale-massey-sr-united-states-of-america-v-sandra/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1560</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1567 n.3 (10th Cir. 1995) (“[T]he jury could reasonably conclude that the\n\nacts of mail fraud and money laundering were both in furtherance of the\n\n[fraudulent loan] conspiracy and reasonably foreseeable.”); see also United States\n\nv.

Consequently, a reasonable factfinder could have determined\n\nthat it was reasonably foreseeable to Mr. Clark—as an active participant in the\n\npump-and-dump conspiracy—that money laundering activities would be\n\nundertaken to further the conspiracy. And, more specifically, such a factfinder\n\ncould have concluded that the fund transfer at issue in Count 18 was reasonably\n\nforeseeable to Mr. Clark and that, under a Pinkerton theory, he was accountable\n\nfor it.\n\n          Thus, we reject Mr. Clark’s suggestion that he could not be found\n\ncriminally liable for Count 18 because he did not personally participate in the\n\nmonetary transaction at issue.

Refusal to Appoint Attorney\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that he was denied a fair trial when the district court\n\nrejected his request under provisions of the Criminal Justice Act (“CJA”), 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3006A, to appoint substitute or additional counsel with expertise in\n\nsecurities law.\n\n      In November 2009, Mr. Clark’s attorney, Allen Smallwood, sought to\n\nwithdraw from his representation of Mr. Clark, citing Mr. Clark’s inability to pay\n\n\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\fhis legal fees. 11 The district court denied Mr. Smallwood’s request, noting his\n\nextensive involvement with the case for over two years. In February 2010, Mr.\n\nSmallwood filed a motion under the CJA and asked the court to appoint an\n\nattorney with securities-law experience as either substitute counsel or co-counsel\n\nfor Mr. Clark. The district court denied the motion.\n\n      Mr. Clark argues that this denial violated his right to a fair trial. He draws\n\nour attention to two things: first, that the CJA requires that more than one\n\nattorney be appointed in an extremely difficult case; and second, that the\n\ngovernment moved successfully for a declaration under the Speedy Trial Act that\n\nthe case was “complex” and required more extensive preparation and a\n\ncontinuance of the trial, see R., Vol. I, at 103 (Unopposed Mot. of United States\n\nto Declare This Case a Complex Matter, filed Feb. 26, 2009) (referencing 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A)–(B) 12). In essence, Mr. Clark claims that he was entitled\n\n      11\n              In this same motion, three other attorneys representing Mr. Clark\nalso sought to withdraw. These attorneys were R. Thomas Seymour, Scott A.\nGraham, and Anthony L. Allen of Seymour & Graham, LLP. They entered their\nappearance as “additional counsel” for Mr. Clark on October 1, 2009. R., Vol. I,\nat 346. They did not replace Mr. Smallwood, and, at least as the district court\nsaw it, “their involvement was limited.” Id. Specifically, they were brought in\nfor two purposes: to oppose the government’s motion to revoke Mr. Clark’s\nrelease pending trial and to persuade the court to permit the liquidation of assets\nfor the purpose of paying attorneys’ fees. See id. at 152 (Entry of Appearance,\nfiled Oct. 1, 2009) (“This appearance is, at present, limited to representation of\nMr. Clark in respect of the Government’s Motion to Revoke Release and in\nrespect of the issue of payment of attorneys’ fees in the case.”).\n      12\n             The motion actually cites 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161(h)(8)(A)–(B). In 2008,\n                                                                   (continued...)\n\n                                        -33-\n\fto a securities-law expert either as a substitute for, or in addition to, Mr.\n\nSmallwood.\n\n      1.

The abuse-of-discretion standard is appropriate because the\n\ndecision we are tasked with reviewing is at bottom a judgment call, given the\n\nfactual circumstances of the case. Where the court is tasked with evaluating the\n\nprejudice that would befall a defendant absent additional counsel, it must consider\n\na vast array of contextually specific matters related to the way the proceedings\n\n\n       13\n             Mr. Clark’s brief is silent regarding the appropriate standard of\nreview to assess the propriety of the district court’s decision on this matter,\nwhereas the government suggests that we should review for an abuse of\ndiscretion, see Aplee.

Indeed, the federal judiciary’s\n\nmodel CJA plan contemplates that a defendant might request the appointment of\n\nan “additional attorney,” but suggests that such appointment is available only in\n\n“extremely difficult case[s] . . .

Application to Mr. Clark’s Claim\n\n      Applying the abuse-of-discretion standard to the district court’s denial of\n\nMr. Smallwood’s motion for appointment of substitute or additional counsel, we\n\nconclude that the district court acted within its discretion. The record shows that\n\nMr. Smallwood is a highly experienced criminal defense attorney. Further, Mr.\n\nClark hired him even prior to the return of the indictment, while the government\n\nwas investigating the activities of Mr. Clark and his alleged co-conspirators.\n\nThus, by the time of Mr. Smallwood’s CJA motion, he had represented Mr. Clark\n\nfor approximately two-and-a-half years—ample time to become familiar with the\n\nfacts and law applicable to Mr. Clark’s case.\n\n      There is no indication of a breakdown in communication between Mr. Clark\n\nand Mr. Smallwood, nor a conflict of interest on Mr. Smallwood’s part, that\n\nwould justify substitution of counsel, see Hutchinson, 573 F.3d at 1024, even\n\nconsidering the fact that Mr. Clark could ostensibly no longer pay the balance of\n\n\n\n      14\n              We assume without deciding that Mr. Clark meets the CJA’s\nfinancial eligibility requirements for the appointment of counsel and that a\ndefendant like Mr. Clark may request the appointment of an additional attorney\nunder the CJA where, like here, he has allegedly run out of funds to pay for\nprivately retained counsel who is otherwise obliged to remain active in the case.\n\n                                        -38-\n\fhis legal fees, see United States v. O’Neil, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"743482\"><a href=\"/opinion/743482/united-states-v-dennis-oneil-ronald-bauer-richard-procknal-richard-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71–72 (2d Cir. 1997)\n\n(“There is little question that a defendant’s failure to pay fees may cause some\n\ndivisiveness between attorney and client, but we presume that counsel will\n\ncontinue to execute his professional and ethical duty to zealously represent his\n\nclient, notwithstanding [a] fee dispute.”).\n\n      Furthermore, in light of Mr. Smallwood’s criminal-defense experience and\n\nhis conduct in the case, the district court could quite reasonably conclude that Mr.\n\nSmallwood’s representation was sufficient for an adequate defense. In other\n\nwords, it could reasonably conclude that an additional attorney—even one more\n\nfamiliar with securities law—was not “necessary to an adequate defense.” See\n\nSolon, 596 F.3d at 1209–10 (emphasis added) (quoting Greschner, 802 F.2d at\n\n376) (internal quotation marks omitted); United States v. Porter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165799\"><a href=\"/opinion/165799/united-states-v-porter/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1141–42 (10th Cir. 2005) (concluding that there was no abuse of discretion in the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of the defendant’s motion to substitute counsel because,\n\ninter alia, there was nothing in the record demonstrating that the attorney could\n\nnot provide an adequate defense).\n\n      This is particularly true where the charges in this case, at their essence,\n\nconcerned general allegations of fraud, and did not, for instance, present the need\n\nto synthesize highly technical securities regulations. And, although the charges\n\nwere premised on voluminous, finance-related discovery, Mr. Clark has failed to\n\npoint to any problems with Mr. Smallwood’s representation that would undermine\n\n                                         -39-\n\fthe soundness of the district court’s decision to deny his motion for substitute or\n\nadditional counsel. For these reasons, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Mr. Clark’s motion for appointment of substitute or\n\nadditional counsel.\n\n      Finally, we reject as unpersuasive Mr. Clark’s facile attempt to link the\n\nconcept of a “complex” case under the Speedy Trial Act to the concept of an\n\n“extremely difficult” case contemplated by the CJA Guidelines. See CJA\n\nGuidelines § 230.53.20. The CJA Guidelines and the Speedy Trial Act serve\n\nwholly different purposes. Compare, e.g., id. § 110.10 (noting that the goal of the\n\nDefender Services program is to “ensure that the right to counsel guaranteed by\n\nthe Sixth Amendment, the [CJA], and other congressional mandates is enforced\n\non behalf of those who cannot afford to retain counsel and other necessary\n\ndefense services”), with Speedy Trial Act of 1974 § 101, 18 U.S.C. § 3161\n\n(suggesting that the Act was passed “so as to assure a speedy trial” in line with\n\nthe defendant’s Sixth Amendment right). In sum, for the reasons noted, we\n\nconclude that Mr. Clark’s appointment-of-counsel challenge fails.\n\nD.    Severance\n\n      Mr. Clark asserts that the district court erred in refusing to allow him to\n\nstand trial alone. Principally, he objects to the district court’s decision not to\n\nsever his trial from that of Mr. Gordon, his co-defendant. He reasons that the\n\nadmission of inculpatory out-of-court statements by Mr. Gordon violated Bruton\n\n                                         -40-\n\fv.

He also challenges the district court’s\n\ndecision on three other grounds. Specifically, Mr. Clark contends that the\n\nprejudicial effects of the district court’s refusal not to allow him to stand trial\n\nalone were that (1) he was prevented from compelling Mr. Gordon to testify, (2)\n\nevidence that was relevant to the culpability of his co-defendants unfairly spilled\n\nover onto him, and (3) he was forced to stand trial with co-conspirators who were\n\nunavailable for cross-examination or confrontation. We conclude that the district\n\ncourt did not commit reversible error.\n\n      1.     Bruton Claim\n\n      Mr. Clark argues that the government—through Mr. Lindberg’s\n\ntestimony—presented evidence that Mr. Gordon often referred to Mr. Clark as\n\n“heat-resistant,” meaning that he was “somebody who would not buckle under the\n\npressure of an SEC investigation.” R., Vol. VIII, at 2974; see id. at 186.

Smalls, 605 F.3d at 768 n.2 (noting that “the Bruton rule, like the\n\nConfrontation Clause upon which it is premised, does not apply to nontestimonial\n\nhearsay statements”). Thus, we are obliged to “view Bruton through the lens of\n\nCrawford” and, in doing so, we consider “whether the challenged statement is\n\ntestimonial.” Figueroa-Cartagena, 612 F.3d at 85.\n\n      In Smalls, based upon our synthesis of Crawford, Davis, and our own\n\nConfrontation Clause precedent, we posited two possible definitions of a\n\n“testimonial” statement: (1) “a formal declaration made by the declarant that,\n\nwhen objectively considered, indicates the primary purpose for which the\n\ndeclaration was made was that of establishing or proving some fact potentially\n\nrelevant to a criminal prosecution”; or (2) “[a] formal statement [such that] a\n\nreasonable person in the position of the declarant would objectively foresee that\n\nthe primary purpose of the statement was for use in the investigation or\n\nprosecution of a crime.” 605 F.3d at 778; cf. United States v.

We did not choose in\n\nSmalls between the two definitions because we found the statement at issue in\n\nSmalls to be nontestimonial “regardless of which of the foregoing definitions we\n\napply.” 605 F.3d at 778. We employ the same approach here and conclude that\n\nthe statement at issue is not testimonial under either definition.\n\n      Mr. Clark contends that the evidence—through Mr. Lindberg’s\n\ntestimony—of Mr. Gordon’s out-of-court statements referring to Mr. Clark as\n\n“heat-resistant” violates Bruton. However, because the statement is not\n\ntestimonial, we disagree. The statement was made to Mr. Lindberg, a\n\nco-conspirator, in furtherance of the underlying conspiracy. In particular, the\n\ngroup wanted to install Mr. Clark as president of Global Beverage so that, if\n\nnecessary, he could withstand the psychological pressure of a federal\n\ninvestigation and not disclose the conspirators’ illegal endeavors. Mr. Gordon’s\n\nstatements were not made to law enforcement investigators, nor could a\n\nreasonable person in Mr. Gordon’s position have objectively foreseen that the\n\nprimary purpose for his statements was for use in the investigation or prosecution\n\nof the pump-and-dump conspiracy. See Bryant, 131 S. Ct. at 1154. Thus, we\n\nconclude that they fall outside the protective ambit of the Confrontation Clause\n\nand, by extension, Bruton.\n\n      In considering a Confrontation Clause challenge—predicated on Crawford\n\n                                         -47-\n\fand Bruton—to the admission of two statements made in the context of a\n\nnarcotics-conspiracy prosecution, we recently reached a very similar conclusion.\n\nSpecifically, in Patterson, we succinctly reasoned as follows: “The admission of\n\nthese two statements violated neither Crawford nor Bruton because both\n\nstatements were made in furtherance of a conspiracy and were therefore\n\nnontestimonial.” 713 F.3d at 1247. Likewise, our decision in United States v.\n\nTownley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168605\"><a href=\"/opinion/168605/united-states-v-townley/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 2007), bolsters our holding here. There,\n\nfollowing Crawford and Davis, we determined that certain out-of-court\n\nco-conspirator statements were not testimonial because “[n]one of [them] was\n\nmade at a hearing or trial or as a result of police interrogation, and no reasonable\n\nperson in the position of the[] declarants would have objectively foreseen that\n\nthese statements would be used in the investigation or prosecution of the[]\n\nconspiracy.” Townley, 472 F.3d at 1275 (citation omitted); see Melendez-Diaz,\n\n557 U.S. at 324 (suggesting that “business records or statements in furtherance of\n\na conspiracy” are “statements that by their nature [a]re not testimonial” (quoting\n\nCrawford, 541 U.S. at 56) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Bourjaily\n\nv.

We thus concluded in Townley that the Confrontation\n\n\n\n\n                                         -48-\n\fClause did not apply. 16 472 F.3d at 1275. For like reasons, the clause does not\n\napply here either. In sum, based upon the foregoing, we conclude that, because\n\nMr. Gordon’s statements were not testimonial, Mr. Clark’s Bruton claim must\n\nfail.\n\n        2.    Other Severance Issues\n\n        Mr. Clark makes three remaining arguments concerning the district court’s\n\nfailure to allow him to stand trial alone. Mr. Clark argues that the prejudicial\n\neffect of this decision was that (1) he was prevented from compelling Mr. Gordon\n\nto testify, (2) evidence that was relevant to the culpability of his co-defendants\n\nunfairly spilled over onto him, and (3) he was forced to stand trial with\n\nco-conspirators who were unavailable for cross-examination or confrontation. We\n\nreject each argument and conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying severance.\n\n\n\n        16\n             We also recognized that the Supreme Court’s Confrontation Clause\njurisprudence, specifically Crawford and Davis, “le[ft] longstanding interpretation\nof the Federal Rules of Evidence untouched,” and we rejected the contention that\nCrawford “somehow eviscerated Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E),”\napplicable to co-conspirator statements.

Thus, “a district court should grant a severance under Rule 14 only if\n\nthere is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of\n\none of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about\n\nguilt or innocence.” Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539. That risk is present when the jury\n\nconsiders evidence against a defendant that is admissible only against a\n\nco-defendant, and is increased when multiple defendants are tried together “in a\n\ncomplex case” and “have markedly different degrees of culpability.” Sarracino,\n\n340 F.3d at 1165 (quoting Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 539) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).

Inability to Compel Mr. Gordon’s Testimony\n\n      Mr. Clark asserts that his inability to compel Mr. Gordon’s testimony at\n\ntheir joint trial violated his confrontation rights. He argues that, without Mr.\n\nGordon as a witness, he “did not have the opportunity to rebut [Mr.] Gordon’s\n\notherwise hearsay statement about [Mr.] Clark being ‘heat resistant,’” which was\n\n“the most significant statement” used against him.

These are:\n\n             1) the likelihood that the co-defendant would in fact testify at the\n             movant’s severed trial and waive his Fifth Amendment privilege;\n             2) the significance of the testimony in relation to the defendant’s\n\n                                             -52-\n\f             theory of defense; 3) the exculpatory nature and effect of such\n             testimony; 4) the likelihood that the co-defendant’s testimony\n             would be impeached; 5) the extent of prejudice caused by the\n             absence of the testimony; 6) the effect of a severance on judicial\n             administration and economy; [and] 7) the timeliness of the\n             motion.\n\nId. at 1215–16 (alteration in original) (quoting United States v.

For instance, he\n\nmakes no argument concerning the likelihood that Mr. Gordon would have agreed\n\nto testify at Mr. Clark’s separate trial. Nor does he explain what the significance\n\nor exculpatory value of that testimony would have been, or articulate how he was\n\nprejudiced by the absence of such testimony.\n\n      Mr. Clark provides only the conclusory, unilluminating assertions that he\n\ncould have “rebut[ted]” Mr. Gordon’s reference to him as being “heat resistant”\n\nand that the joint trial “greatly affected” his own decision not to testify. Aplt.\n\nOpening Br. at 19 (internal quotation marks omitted).

With effectively nothing to go on\n\nfrom Mr. Clark, and in light of our preference for joint co-conspirator trials, see\n\nPursley, 577 F.3d at 1215, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying severance on this ground.\n\n             c. Spillover Effect of Evidence Against Co-defendants\n\n      Mr. Clark further argues that evidence introduced against his co-defendants\n\nhad a spillover effect that prejudiced his defense. He points in particular to Mr.\n\n                                         -54-\n\fLindberg’s testimony that persistently referred to “the group” but “barely\n\nmentioned” Mr. Clark. Aplt. Opening Br. at 15 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). However, Mr. Lindberg specifically described Mr. Clark’s involvement\n\nin the conspiracy at several points during his testimony. See, e.g., R., Vol. VIII,\n\nat 174–75 (noting that Mr. Clark was “one of those people” that “kept money”\n\nwhen the conspirators started dumping Deep Rock stock); id. at 186 (noting that\n\nMr. Gordon recommended installing Mr. Clark as president of the company that\n\nwas ultimately called Global Beverage because “he’s been a good soldier in the\n\npast and he’s heat-resistant”); id. at 212 (responding to a question asking whether\n\nMr. Clark sold Deep Rock stock out of turn again, after Mr. Gordon admonished\n\nhim, “I don’t believe he did”). The evidence shows that Mr. Clark was involved\n\nand cooperated with his co-defendants in, and substantially profited from, the\n\nillegal scheme. Simply put, the evidence against Mr. Clark and his co-defendants\n\nwas “overlapping and intertwined.” Morales, 108 F.3d at 1220; see United States\n\nv. Zapata, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1362010\"><a href=\"/opinion/1362010/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1192 (10th Cir. 2008) (concluding that there was no\n\nprejudice stemming from a risk of “spillover” evidence in a conspiracy trial\n\nbecause “there was clear and direct testimony at trial that specifically implicated\n\n[the defendant] in the conspiracy”); see also Wardell, 591 F.3d at 1300 (“[T]he\n\nnearly insuperable rule in this circuit is that a defendant cannot obtain severance\n\nsimply by showing that the evidence against a co-defendant is more damaging\n\nthan the evidence against herself.” (quoting United States v. Dazey, 403 F.3d\n\n                                        -55-\n\f1147, 1165 (10th Cir. 2005)) (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n      Finally, although Mr. Gordon was charged with three additional counts in\n\nthe twenty-four count indictment, the facts relating to the separate counts did not\n\nrender null the jury’s ability “to segregate the evidence associated with each\n\ndefendant’s individual actions.” Zapata, 546 F.3d at 1191. The district court\n\ninstructed the jury to segregate out evidence that was not directed at Mr. Clark,\n\nsee R., Vol. VIII, at 2516–17 (Jury Instructions, given Apr. 29, 2010), and Mr.\n\nClark has not articulated any reason why the jury was unable to follow the\n\ninstructions in this respect, see Zapata, 546 F.3d at 1191–92 (suggesting that the\n\ndistrict court’s instruction limited the prejudice of any “spillover” to a defendant\n\nthat might result from counts concerning his co-defendants); see also Caldwell,\n\n560 F.3d at 1213 (“We presume that the jury obey[s] [its] instructions.”).\n\n      We thus reject Mr. Clark’s claim of prejudicial spillover and conclude that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying severance on this ground.\n\n             d. Absent Co-defendants\n\n      Finally, Mr. Clark claims that conducting the trial with absent\n\nco-defendants—specifically, Dean Sheptycki, the creator of much of the\n\npromotional material, and Josh Lankford—violated his rights. Under indictment\n\nfor the pump-and-dump conspiracy, Mr. Sheptycki was apprehended in the\n\nBahamas, but the Bahamian government declined to honor the government’s\n\nextradition request, so he was not present for the trial. Also indicted,\n\n                                         -56-\n\fco-conspirator Lankford’s whereabouts were unknown at the time of trial and the\n\ngovernment classified him as a fugitive. Neither Mr. Sheptycki nor Mr. Lankford\n\nwas actually tried by the government in absentia in the case, but there was\n\nconsiderable evidence detailing their roles in the charged conspiracy. Mr. Clark\n\ncomplains that his legal rights were infringed because he was “unable to cross-\n\nexamine or otherwise confront” Mr. Lankford and Mr. Sheptycki. Aplt. Opening\n\nBr. at 18. We reject this claim.\n\n      Standing alone, Mr. Clark’s assertions do not satisfy his “‘heavy burden’ of\n\nshowing ‘real prejudice.’” Wardell, 591 F.3d at 1299 (quoting McConnell, 749\n\nF.2d at 1444). He does not explain how the absence of Messrs. Sheptycki and\n\nLankford “compromise[d] a specific trial right” of his—including his right of\n\ncross-examination under the Confrontation Clause 17—or “prevent[ed] the jury\n\nfrom making a reliable judgment about [his] guilt or innocence.” Stiger, 413 F.3d\n\nat 1197 (emphasis added) (quoting United States v.

Sheptycki and Lankford. See Aplt. Opening Br. at 19–20. We do not\nconstrue Mr. Clark as presenting a distinct ground of error by this suggestion, in\nthat it appears as a tangential remark in the section of his brief addressing the\nalleged prejudicial spill-over effect caused by the introduction of evidence related\nto his co-conspirators. However, even if it were an assertion of error, we would\nconclude that it is waived. When the issue of verdict forms came up before the\ndistrict court, Mr. Clark specifically requested, over the government’s insistence\nto the contrary, that Mr. Sheptycki’s and Mr. Lankford’s names remain on the\nforms. See R., Vol. VIII, at 2403–06 (Trial Tr., dated Apr. 27, 2010). Thus, Mr.\nClark would have invited any error associated with the inclusion of the two men’s\nnames on the verdict form and, consequently, waived any appellate challenge\nregarding the matter. See, e.g., United States v. Teague, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167382\"><a href=\"/opinion/167382/united-states-v-teague/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1317–18\n(10th Cir. 2006) (holding that a party waives an issue for appeal when he\n“‘invites’ an error by suggesting that the court take particular action”).\n\n                                         -58-\n\fE.    Speedy Trial Act\n\n      Mr. Clark claims that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss the\n\nindictment pursuant to the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161–3174, primarily\n\nbecause the court’s March 10, 2009, ends-of-justice continuance “was\n\ninadequate.” Aplt. Opening Br. at 23.\n\n      Roughly two weeks after the indictment was unsealed, the government filed\n\nan unopposed motion to declare the case “complex” under 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h) in\n\nlight of the massive pending discovery and complex legal issues presented. On\n\nMarch 10, the district court granted the motion, concluding that the “ends of\n\njustice” outweighed the public’s interest in a speedy trial. More specifically,\n\nnoting that it had considered the statutory factors and our precedent, the court\n\nstated:\n\n             The substantial volume of discovery supports the government’s\n             argument that this case is unusually complex and, with counsel\n             exercising due diligence, will require more than the 70 days\n             provided by the Act for the parties to prepare for trial. It would\n             not be reasonable to expect defense counsel to review the\n             voluminous evidence, prepare pretrial motions, and adequately\n             represent their clients at trial in less than 70 days. Failure to\n             treat this case as a complex case would deny counsel for all\n             parties time to prepare, and this consideration outweighs\n             defendant’s interest in a speedy trial.\n\n             . . . While a speedy resolution of criminal cases serves the public\n             interest, it does not benefit the public if a complex criminal case\n             is rushed and a miscarriage of justice results. Given the complex\n             nature of these proceedings, the ends-of-justice served by treating\n             this as a complex case outweigh the public’s interest in a speedy\n             trial.\n\n                                            -59-\n\fR., Vol. I, at 121 (Order Granting Unopposed Mot. of the United States to Declare\n\nThis Case a Complex Matter, filed Mar. 10, 2009). In that order, it struck the\n\ninitial trial date. Then, through entry of a minute order one week later, the court\n\nset the trial date for January 19, 2010.\n\n      After reassignment, the new district judge (i.e., Judge Payne) struck the\n\nJanuary 19 trial date. On March 17, 2010, Mr. Clark and Mr. Gordon filed a joint\n\nmotion to dismiss the indictment under the Speedy Trial Act, challenging, inter\n\nalia, the validity of the court’s ends-of-justice continuance. The district court\n\ndenied the motion, and the trial began on April 5, 2010.\n\n      “The Speedy Trial Act . . . requires that a criminal defendant’s trial\n\ncommence within 70 days after he is charged or makes an initial appearance,\n\nwhichever is later . . . .” 19 Bloate v.

Santiago-Becerril, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197654\"><a href=\"/opinion/197654/united-states-v-santiago-becerril/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) (“Open-ended continuances are not prohibited per se.”). In assessing\n\nwhether an open-ended continuance was terminated (i.e., delimited by a definite\n\nend date) in a reasonable time frame, courts naturally look beyond the\n\ncontinuance order itself to other documents in the record associated with it. See\n\nSpring, 80 F.3d at 1458; see also United States v. Ross, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">703</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 877 (6th\n\nCir. 2012) (“[T]he latter order’s reference to ‘the new trial date’ was not an\n\n‘open-ended period’ but was merely a reference to the new, June 24, 2008 trial\n\ndate specified in the former order. These orders satisfy the statutory\n\nrequirements.”).\n\n      To the extent that the March 10 order created an open-ended continuance, a\n\nsurvey of the record reveals that the district court supplied a concrete end date\n\n(i.e., a trial date of January 19) in its minute order with virtually no delay—viz.,\n\n                                         -62-\n\fone week later. This week was clearly a reasonable period. See Spring, 80 F.3d\n\nat 1458 (“The new trial date was set, thereby providing a specific ending date to\n\nthe continuance, eleven days later . . . . Given the circumstances of this case, the\n\nopen-ended continuance initially granted was reasonable in length.”).\n\n        Furthermore, focusing on Mr. Clark’s challenge to the adequacy of the\n\ndistrict court’s findings, we reject Mr. Clark’s assertion that they were conclusory\n\nand insufficient under our case law. When analyzing the terms of the same order\n\nin our Gordon decision, we concluded that the district court properly struck the\n\nends-of-justice balance to justify the continuance of the trial date to January 19,\n\n2010, and that conclusion is controlling here. See 710 F.3d at 1158–59.\n\n        In sum, we find no merit in Mr. Clark’s speedy trial challenges and reject\n\nthem.\n\n                                   III. Conclusion\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM Mr. Clark’s conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -63-\n\f</pre>",
