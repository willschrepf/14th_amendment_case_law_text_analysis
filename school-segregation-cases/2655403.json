SCRIBNER\n\n                         OPINION\n\nMcKEOWN, Circuit Judge:\n\n    This case arises from a lockdown imposed on African\nAmerican inmates at a California state prison after violent\nincidents involving inmates and guards. Garrick Harrington\nbrought suit against prison officials under the Eighth\nAmendment for injuries he suffered related to shower\nrestrictions and under the Equal Protection Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment for the race-based classification of\nthe lockdown. A jury found against him on both claims.\n\n     We consider the interplay between the Supreme Court’s\nteaching in Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005), that\nstrict scrutiny applies to claims challenging racial\nclassifications in prison, and the line of authorities, such as\nTurner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987), that instruct courts to\ngive deference to correctional officials with respect to\nconstitutional claims involving prison regulations. We affirm\nthe judgment with respect to the Eighth Amendment\ndeliberate indifference claim. We reverse with respect to the\nequal protection claim because the jury instructions were\ninconsistent with the requirements of strict scrutiny. That\nerror, which absolved the prison officials of their obligation\nto demonstrate that the race-based action was narrowly\ntailored, violated the tenets of Johnson and was prejudicial.\n\n                       BACKGROUND\n\n    Early 2004 was a violent period at California State\nPrison–Corcoran. In February and March, multiple violent\nincidents occurred, each involving African American inmates\nassociated with gangs. Five more violent incidents occurred\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                      5\n\nover the next two months, including riots involving white\ninmates and inmates associated with certain “disruptive\ngroups,” which are groups of individuals who have formed an\nalliance and act, often aggressively, at the direction of a\nleader. Prison officials also reported receiving information of\na statewide risk that unidentified African American inmates\nwould attack prison staff.\n\n    In response, the prison instituted a lockdown on African\nAmerican inmates due “to multiple batteries on staff by\nBlacks . . . coupled with information indicating a coalition of\nBlack inmates are plotting the murder of staff,” as was\nexplained in a Program Status Report, a weekly memorandum\nissued during periods of modified programming. That\nlockdown was followed by a state of emergency lockdown\napplicable to inmates of all races. As part of the emergency\naction, the prison instituted shower restrictions that, among\nother things, allowed inmates to wear only minimal\nclothing—boxer shorts and shower shoes—and required them\nto be handcuffed while being escorted to the shower.\nEventually, the shower restrictions were lifted for all inmates\nexcept African American inmates, including Garrick\nHarrington, and members of the Northern Hispanic disruptive\ngroup. An updated Program Status Report explained that,\namongst other things, “batteries on staff by various factions\nof black inmates” were an “ongoing state-wide concern\nindicating a mindset by this ethnic group to harm staff.” Over\ntime, the shower restrictions were eased for additional groups,\nincluding older African American inmates. The state of\nemergency ended, and the prison gradually lifted the\nlockdown restrictions and returned to normal programming.\n\n    While the race-based shower restrictions were still in\nplace, Harrington—who was not involved in the violent\n\f6                HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\naltercations that led to the lockdown and was not associated\nwith a gang or disruptive group—requested that he be\npermitted to walk to the showers wearing his government-\nissued boots instead of the shower slippers, which he\ndescribed as “flimsy.” A correctional officer denied his\nrequest, then escorted Harrington, who was handcuffed and\nwearing shower slippers, to a shower on another floor, all the\nwhile following behind without assisting him. Harrington\ncame upon a pool of water and testified that he heard a\ncorrectional officer say, “It’s slippery there.” Harrington\nslipped in the water, fell, and injured his back. Despite\ntreatments, his pain continues, requiring medication.\n\n     Harrington filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nseveral prison officials, alleging claims for deliberate\nindifference in violation of the Eighth Amendment and for\nrace discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. His repeated requests\nfor the appointment of counsel were denied, an issue he raises\nagain on appeal. The case proceeded to trial, where the jury\nfound for the prison officials. Harrington challenges the\nverdict on the grounds that the jury was improperly instructed\non both of his constitutional claims.\n\n                         ANALYSIS\n\nI.     EIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIM\n\n    The Eighth Amendment claim centers on the jury\ninstructions on deliberate indifference. The court instructed\nthe jury that “[t]o establish deliberate indifference, the\nplaintiff must prove that a defendant knew that the plaintiff\nfaced a substantial risk of serious harm and disregarded that\nrisk by failing to take reasonable measures to correct it.”\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                      7\n\nBefore trial, Harrington proposed an additional “knowledge”\ninstruction that the court declined to give to the jury. After\nthe close of evidence, the court reviewed the proposed jury\ninstructions with the parties and gave them time to\nindependently review the instructions. Upon reconvening,\nthe court asked whether Harrington had any “corrections,\nadditions, deletions, modifications or objections.” Harrington\noffered one change, unrelated to the deliberate indifference\nstandard.\n\n    During jury deliberations, the jury submitted two\nquestions to the court: “What is serious risk of injury? Please\ndefine. Is the fact that the areas around all the showers are\nalways wet constituting [sic] a serious risk of injury?”\nOutside the presence of the jury, the court discussed several\ncases in detail with the parties and concluded that none of the\ncases defined “serious risk” (or, as the original instruction\nhad put it, “substantial risk”) in the context of an Eighth\nAmendment claim. Harrington then noted that caselaw\nsupports the notion that “knowledge can be demonstrated of\nthe substantial risk simply because it was obvious”; counsel\nfor the defendants pointed out in response that the jury’s\ninquiry did not pertain to knowledge. Upon the jury’s return,\nthe court gave supplemental instructions that the jury was “to\ndetermine whether any defendant acted with deliberate\nindifference to a known risk,” and that “[k]nown risk means\nthat the person who has the duty to protect from it has to have\nknowledge that there is a known hazard or known danger of\nserious harm.”\n\n    In Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994), the Supreme\nCourt outlined the standard for Eighth Amendment liability\nfor acting with “deliberate indifference” to inmate safety. At\nthe outset, the Court rejected the “invitation to adopt an\n\f8                HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nobjective test for deliberate indifference.” Id. at 837. To\nprove deliberate indifference, subjective recklessness is\nrequired, that is, an official “cannot be found liable under the\nEighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions\nof confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an\nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must\nboth be aware of facts from which the inference could be\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he\nmust also draw the inference.” Id. Constructive notice does\nnot suffice to prove the requisite knowledge, but “[w]hether\na prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial\nrisk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual\nways, including inference from circumstantial evidence.” Id.\nat 841–42.\n\n    The court’s original Eighth Amendment instruction\nessentially restates the elements of the Farmer test by\nrequiring knowledge of a “substantial risk of serious harm”\nand that a defendant “disregarded that risk.” The instruction\ndoes not mention that such knowledge may be established by\ncircumstantial evidence, as did Harrington’s additional\nproposed instruction. But the jury was not totally without\nguidance on this point. The court gave a general instruction\non the definitions of circumstantial evidence and direct\nevidence and stated, “You should consider both kinds of\nevidence. The law makes no distinction between the weight\nto be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. It is\nfor you to decide how much weight to give to any evidence.”\nThe court put no restrictions on Harrington’s ability to argue\nthat circumstantial evidence supported his claim. Harrington\nwas not entitled, as he argues here, to urge liability based on\nconstructive knowledge of the risk, a theory of liability the\nSupreme Court explicitly rejected in Farmer. Id. at 841.\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                       9\n\n    The supplemental instructions delivered after the jury’s\nquestions about the meaning of “serious risk of injury” did\nnot introduce error.        According to Harrington, the\nsupplemental instructions over-emphasized subjective\nknowledge, thereby impermissibly “heightening” the\nknowledge requirement. This argument is unpersuasive, as\nFarmer clearly requires subjective knowledge. Id. at 837.\nThe instruction stated that requirement correctly, and the\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in repeating the standard in\nresponse to the jury’s question. See Jazzabi v. Allstate Ins.\nCo., 278 F.3d 979, 982 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding that we\nreview the court’s decision whether to give a supplemental\njury instruction, and the formulation of that instruction, for\nabuse of discretion).\n\n    Harrington’s argument misapprehends the significance of\nthe obviousness of a risk in a deliberate indifference calculus.\nOur cases support the proposition that obviousness of a risk\nmay be used to prove subjective knowledge, not that liability\nmay be based on constructive knowledge. See Lemire v. Cal.\nDep’t of Corr. & Rehab., 726 F.3d 1062, 1078 (9th Cir. 2013)\n(requiring a plaintiff to demonstrate “that the risk was\nobvious or provide other circumstantial or direct evidence\nthat the prison officials were aware of the substantial risk” to\ndefeat summary judgment); Thomas v. Ponder, 611 F.3d\n1144, 1150 (9th Cir. 2010) (noting that subjective awareness\n“may be satisfied if the inmate shows that the risk posed by\nthe deprivation is obvious”). Although evidence of\nobviousness may present a disputed fact to defeat summary\njudgment, such evidence cannot be used to circumvent the\nneed for a jury instruction on Farmer’s subjective knowledge\nrequirement once a case reaches a jury.\n\f10               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nII. EQUAL PROTECTION CLAIM\n\n    The fundamental principle that prisoners are protected\nfrom race discrimination is longstanding: “Prisoners are\nprotected under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment from invidious discrimination based on race.”\nWolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 556 (1974) (citing Lee v.\nWashington, 390 U.S. 333 (1968) (per curiam)). In Johnson,\nthe Supreme Court was unequivocal that strict scrutiny is the\nproper standard of review for an equal protection challenge\nto a race-based prison policy. 543 U.S. at 515. Similarly\nwell established is the role that deference to prison officials\nplays in prison administration. Turner, 482 U.S. at 89; see\ngenerally Norwood v. Vance, 591 F.3d 1062 (9th Cir. 2010)\n(emphasizing importance of deference instruction in Eighth\nAmendment claim). The question we consider in this § 1983\ncase, in the context of the jury instructions on equal\nprotection, is the relationship between these principles when\nrace classifications collide with prison security concerns.\n\n     A. JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n    The court gave a trio of instructions related to\nHarrington’s equal protection claim. It began with an\ninstruction on “Prisoner’s Claim Regarding Denial of Equal\nProtection”:\n\n           Prisoners are protected from racial\n       discrimination by the Equal Protection Clause\n       of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n       States Constitution. On his equal protection\n       claim, the plaintiff must prove by a\n       preponderance of the evidence that\n       defendants . . . acted with an intent or purpose\n\f                   HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                          11\n\n        to discriminate against the plaintiff, or against\n        a class of which the plaintiff is a member,\n        based on his race.\n\n            Intentional discrimination means that a\n        defendant acted at least in part because of the\n        plaintiff’s race.\n\n    The court then instructed the jury that “[t]he state may\ntake race-based action when necessary to further a compelling\ngovernmental interest,” if the action is “narrowly tailored to\nserve such a governmental interest.” The court followed that\ninstruction by telling the jury that “[i]n considering whether\n[the defendants] discriminated against plaintiff because of his\nrace, you should consider that defendants had a competing\nobligation under the Eighth Amendment to ensure the safety\nof prisoners, including protecting prisoners from each other\nand/or maintaining institutional security. In considering these\nfactors, you should respect and give deference to the opinion\nof prison officials in their adoption and execution of policies\nand practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve\ndiscipline and to maintain internal security in a prison.”\n\n    Harrington challenges the latter instruction, which at trial\nwas denominated as “the Norwood instruction.”1 He argues\nthat its effect was to lessen the scrutiny that the jury applied\nto the equal protection claim. Harrington’s proposed strict\nscrutiny instructions did not mention or carve out deference.\n\n\n\n\n 1\n    In Norwood, which involved a claimed Eighth Amendment violation\nfor denial of outdoor exercise, the court endorsed an almost identical\ndeference instruction. 591 F.3d at 1066.\n\f12               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\n    After the court reviewed the Norwood instruction with the\nparties and solicited their views, Harrington told the court\nthat he was “unclear” on this instruction because “that wasn’t\nthe strict scrutiny instruction.” Through his proposed strict\nscrutiny instruction plus his response to the court on the\nNorwood instruction, the court was on notice as to\nHarrington’s position. Harrington did not waive this error.\nWe review de novo whether the instruction misstates the law.\nIf so, the error warrants reversal, unless it is harmless. Dang\nv. Cross, 422 F.3d 800, 804–05 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\n     B. JOHNSON V. CALIFORNIA, RACIAL CLASSIFICATIONS\n        AND NARROW TAILORING\n\n    The Supreme Court has recognized that “racial\nclassifications ‘threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of\ntheir membership in a racial group and to incite racial\nhostility.’” Johnson, 543 U.S. at 507 (quoting Shaw v. Reno,\n509 U.S. 630, 643 (1993)) (emphasis omitted).\nConsequently, racial classifications in prisons are\n“immediately suspect” and subject to strict scrutiny, which\nrequires the government to prove that the measures are\nnarrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.\nId. at 509 (quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642).\n\n    Johnson arose in the context of a California Department\nof Corrections “unwritten policy of racially segregating\nprisoners” each time they entered a new correctional facility.\nId. at 502. Like the lockdown and restrictions imposed here,\nthe CDC attempted to justify the practice “to prevent violence\ncaused by racial gangs.” Id.\n\n    In reaffirming the strict scrutiny standard, the Court\nreviewed its past cases, such as Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S.\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                      13\n\n333 (1968) (per curiam), applying heightened review “in\nevaluating racial segregation in prisons.” Johnson, 543 U.S.\nat 506–07. It emphasized that “strict scrutiny is no less\nimportant” where “prison officials cite racial violence as the\nreason for their policy.” Id. at 507.\n\n    Significant to our case, the prison officials in Johnson\nalleged that their judgments were entitled to the same\ndeference as the defendants in Turner. Id. at 509. The Court\nrebuffed this effort, noting that Turner did not involve a race-\nbased classification and had never been applied to racial\nclassifications. The reason is that “[t]he right not to be\ndiscriminated against based on one’s race is not susceptible\nto the logic of Turner. It is not a right that need necessarily\nbe compromised for the sake of proper prison\nadministration.” Id. at 510.\n\n    The Court went on to confirm its implicit holding in Lee:\n“The ‘necessities of prison security and discipline,’ are a\ncompelling government interest justifying only those uses of\nrace that are narrowly tailored to address those necessities.”\nJohnson, 543 U.S. at 512 (citation omitted) (quoting Lee,\n390 U.S. at 334). The bottom line is that prison security and\ndeference to prison authorities do not trump Johnson’s\nnarrow tailoring requirement.\n\n    We have not addressed previously the relationship\nbetween strict scrutiny in a race discrimination equal\nprotection claim and the principle of deference to prison\nofficials that originated in cases involving Eighth\nAmendment claims. In Norwood, we established that\n“[p]rison officials are entitled to deference whether a prisoner\nchallenges excessive force or conditions of confinement.”\n591 F.3d at 1067. In Norwood, however, only Eighth\n\f14               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nAmendment claims were before the court. Tellingly, we\n“express[ed] no view as to the race-based aspect of the\nlockdowns” that were challenged, nor did we take a position\non “any potential Equal Protection claim.” Id. at 1066 n.1.\nThis case requires us to consider precisely the questions left\nunanswered in Norwood. We now conclude that even where\ndeference is owed to prison officials as to one claim in a suit,\nsuch as an Eighth Amendment claim, the strict scrutiny\nanalysis of an equal protection claim does not\nindiscriminately incorporate that deference. Nor do the\nclaims compete.\n\n    This approach is in keeping with the Supreme Court’s\nobservations on the more deferential test that Justice Thomas\nwould have applied in Johnson: “Justice Thomas takes a\nhands-off approach to racial classifications in prisons,\nsuggesting that a ‘compelling showing [is] needed to\novercome the deference we owe to prison administrators.’\nBut such deference is fundamentally at odds with our equal\nprotection jurisprudence. We put the burden on state actors\nto demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.”\n543 U.S. at 506 n.1 (citation omitted).\n\n     The district court accurately instructed the jury on the\nelements of race discrimination and strict scrutiny. The jury\nwas told that the race-based action could be justified if it was\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.\nSo far, so good. But the follow-on instruction on deference,\nwhich was specifically pegged to the race claim, basically\npulled the rug out from under the narrow tailoring\nrequirement. The instruction pitched the two claims as\ncompeting against one another—“[i]n considering whether\ndefendants . . . discriminated against [Harrington] because of\nhis race, you should consider that defendants had a competing\n\f                  HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                      15\n\nobligation under the Eighth Amendment to ensure the safety\nof prisoners . . . .” It thus suggested that Harrington’s success\non the equal protection claim was in some way dependent on\nthe defendants’ loss on the Eighth Amendment claim. Then\nthe instruction took an even more devastating blow to the\nnarrow tailoring requirement by enshrining the “policies and\npractices” of prison officials with broad deference rather than\nputting the specific practices challenged here to the test of\nnarrow tailoring. In doing so, the court diluted the\nrequirements of strict scrutiny by introducing the notion that\nthe standard governing a race discrimination claim is in\nequipoise with the deference owed to prison officials in an\nEighth Amendment context, even though the analysis for\neach type of claim differs.\n\n    We conclude that the court erred when it instructed the\njury that the prison’s obligations under the Eighth\nAmendment compete with its obligations under the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A\nprisoner’s success on an equal protection claim is not\ndependent on whether the government met its obligations\nunder the Eighth Amendment. In light of Johnson’s clear\ndirection, the court also erred by allowing the jury to defer\ngenerally to officials when considering Harrington’s equal\nprotection claim, rather than assessing whether the challenged\nrace-based actions were narrowly tailored.\n\n    Our analysis should not be read to mean that deference\nplays no role in prisoners’ constitutional claims. Writing\nwith respect to First Amendment and right to marry\nregulations in the prison context, the Supreme Court in\nTurner explained: “Subjecting the day-to-day judgments of\nprison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny analysis would\nseriously hamper their ability to anticipate security problems\n\f16               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nand to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems\nof prison administration.” 482 U.S. at 89. In a recent Fourth\nAmendment case, the Court “confirmed the importance of\ndeference to correctional officials” in the context of\nmaintaining security and discipline in the jail. Florence v.\nBd. of Chosen Freeholders, 132 S. Ct. 1510, 1515–16 (2012)\n(citing Turner, 482 U.S. at 89). Likewise, in the Norwood\nchallenge to prison conditions relating to lockdowns and\noutdoor exercise, we reiterated the importance of deference.\n591 F.3d at 1067.\n\n     But none of these cases involved claims governed by\nstrict scrutiny, which allows deference a limited role. See\nJohnson, 543 U.S. at 509, 513 (rejecting the more deferential\nTurner test as “too lenient a standard to ferret out invidious\nuses of race”). In Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003),\nsuperseded on other grounds by Mich. Const. art I, § 26,\ndeference played a role in assessing whether the\ngovernment’s asserted interest was compelling, but not\nwhether its actions were narrowly tailored to serve that\ninterest. The Supreme Court deferred to the University of\nMichigan Law School’s expert “educational judgment that\n[attaining a diverse student body] is essential to its\neducational mission,” and thus was a compelling interest. Id.\nat 328–29. Such an interest could justify the law school’s use\nof race in admissions only if the means chosen to further that\ninterest were “specifically and narrowly framed to\naccomplish that purpose.” Id. at 333 (quoting Shaw v. Hunt,\n517 U.S. 899, 908 (1996)). Deference played no role in the\nCourt’s assessment of whether the law school’s use of race\nwas narrowly tailored. Id. at 333–43; see also Fisher v. Univ.\nof Tex. at Austin, 133 S. Ct. 2411, 2419–20 (2013) (“The\n[government] must prove that the means chosen . . . are\nnarrowly tailored to that goal. On this point, the University\n\f                    HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                            17\n\nreceives no deference.”). The jury instructions here did not\ndifferentiate how deference could properly inform the jury’s\nconsideration of the differing constitutional claims.2\n\n    Finally, we emphasize that penological interests may still\nfactor into the analysis of an equal protection claim. “The\n‘necessities of prison security and discipline,’ are a\ncompelling government interest justifying only those uses of\nrace that are narrowly tailored to address those necessities.”\nJohnson, 543 U.S. at 512 (citation omitted) (quoting Lee,\n390 U.S. at 334). Such interests properly inform whether\nthere exists a compelling interest, but they do not excuse the\nnarrow tailoring requirement.\n\n    C. PREJUDICE\n\n    Although we review the instructions as a whole, the\ninstructions here cannot be harmonized because the deference\ninstruction circles back to whether the prison discriminated\nagainst Harrington because of his race. Although one\ninstruction recites strict scrutiny, the deference instruction\nintroduces a new and different standard. Taken together, the\noverall effect of the instructions was misleading. See Dang,\n422 F.3d at 804 (stressing that instructions “must not be\nmisleading”). The evidence was never put to the correct\n\n\n   2\n     In Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709 (2005), the Supreme Court\nanalyzed statutory rights under the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a)(1)–(2). The Court\nrelied on legislative history to determine Congress’s intended role for\ndeference in assessing whether a burden to a prisoner’s religious exercise\nfurthers a “compelling governmental interest” by the “least restrictive\nmeans.” Cutter, 544 U.S. 709, 717, 722–23 (2005). As a statutory case,\nCutter does not inform our analysis of the constitutional claim presented\nhere.\n\f18                  HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\n“narrow tailoring” test because the jury was told it should\ndefer to the judgment of prison officials on this score.\n\n    The prison officials argue that any claimed instructional\nerror is harmless because the verdict form reflects that\nHarrington failed to establish that there was any racial\nclassification at all. This circular response simply skirts the\nissue. The jury answered no to the following question: “On\nPlaintiff’s equal protection claim, did any Defendant\nintentionally discriminate against Plaintiff on account of his\nrace in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.” If the\nanswer was no, the defendants argue, then that was the end of\nHarrington’s equal protection claim. But the jury gave this\nanswer after having been instructed that the strict scrutiny\nstandard governing whether the defendants acted “in violation\nof the Equal Protection Clause” could give way to the lesser\ndeference standard in evaluating the race claim. The flaw in\nthe instructions thus skewed how the jury would have\nunderstood the verdict form. The error is prejudicial. See\nWilkerson v. Wheeler, 772 F.3d 834, 838 (9th Cir. 2014)\n(requiring for an error to be harmless that it be “more\nprobable than not that the jury would have reached the same\nverdict had it been properly instructed”).3\n\nIII.     DENIAL OF COUNSEL\n\n    It is well established that “[t]he decision to appoint\ncounsel in a civil suit is one of discretion and a district court’s\ndetermination will be overturned only for abuse of that\ndiscretion.” Cano v. Taylor, 739 F.3d 1214, 1218 (9th Cir.\n\n\n  3\n     It is unnecessary to determine whether, as Harrington argues, the\n“reasonableness” defense on the verdict form constitutes reversible error\nin light of our determination that the jury instructions were infirm.\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                     19\n\n2014) (citing Palmer v. Valdez, 560 F.3d 965, 970 (9th Cir.\n2009)). The court must consider whether there is a\n“likelihood of success on the merits” and whether “the\nprisoner is unable to articulate his claims in light of the\ncomplexity of the legal issues involved.” Id. Harrington’s\nclaims were relatively straightforward equal protection and\ndeliberate indifference claims. Despite his medical issues, he\narticulated his claims well. He filed a pretrial statement,\nmotions, proposed jury instructions, and other substantive\ndocuments, and engaged with opposing counsel and the court\nthroughout years of legal proceedings. Although there were\nsome tricky legal issues regarding the instructions,\nHarrington spotted the key jury instruction issue that is the\nsubject of this opinion. Harrington served as the lead law\nlibrary clerk in prison, and the court commended him at trial\nfor presenting his case well. The court did not abuse its\ndiscretion by denying him appointed counsel.\n\n    AFFIRMED as to Harrington’s Eighth Amendment\ndeliberate indifference claim and the district court’s decision\nnot to appoint counsel. REVERSED, VACATED and\nREMANDED as to Harrington’s equal protection claim.\nEach party shall bear its own costs on appeal.\n\n\n\nO’SCANNLAIN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and\ndissenting in part:\n\n    I concur in the Court’s analysis of Harrington’s deliberate\nindifference and appointment of counsel claims and join in\nthe opinion and judgment to that extent. I must respectfully\ndissent, however, from the Court’s equal protection analysis\n\f20                   HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nand conclude that the relevant jury instruction appropriately\nincorporated deference to prison officials’ unique expertise.\n\n                                     I\n\n    In Johnson v. California, 543 U.S. 499 (2005), the\nSupreme Court overturned a Ninth Circuit decision which had\nexpressly rejected the strict scrutiny standard for equal\nprotection claims against prison officials in favor of what the\nSupreme Court referred to as the “deferential” Turner\nstandard, which asks whether the regulation was “‘reasonably\nrelated’ to ‘legitimate penological interests.’” Id. at 504, 510\n(quoting Tuner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 89 (1987)). As the\nJohnson Court emphasized throughout its opinion, the two\nstandards are fundamentally incompatible—the Turner\nstandard requires merely a reasonable relationship to\nlegitimate interests, while strict scrutiny requires “narrow[]\ntailor[ing]” to a “compelling” interest. Id. at 505 (emphasis\nadded). Thus, Johnson established that when evaluating\nequal protection claims against prison officials, strict, rather\nthan intermediate, scrutiny is the applicable test.\n\n    Our decision in Norwood v. Vance, 591 F.3d 1062 (9th\nCir. 2010), does not address—and thereby does not alter—the\nappropriate tier of scrutiny to apply when analyzing Eighth\nAmendment or equal protection claims. Rather, we instructed\nthat “[p]rison officials are entitled to deference whether a\nprisoner challenges excessive force or conditions of\nconfinement.” Id. at 1067 (emphasis added).1\n\n\n  1\n   The majority is correct in its observation that Norwood specifically\naddressed only Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claims. Maj.\nOp. at 13–14. The clear language of the opinion, however, describes the\napplication of deference in terms of the type of activity challenged, rather\n\f                     HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                             21\n\n    Here, as the majority acknowledges, the trial court\naccurately instructed the jury to apply a strict scrutiny\nanalysis to Harrington’s equal protection claim. Maj. Op. at\n14. The trial court then, as required by Norwood, instructed\nthe jury that prison officials are entitled to deference in their\nevaluation and adoption of prison policies necessary to\nmaintain prison security and discipline—the very goals\nidentified in Johnson as compelling interests that might\njustify race-based prison policies. 543 U.S. at 512.\n\n    According to the majority, this second instruction “pulled\nthe rug out from under the narrow tailoring requirement” by\nsuggesting that Harrington’s equal protection claim was\n“competing” with the prison officials’ defense on the Eighth\nAmendment claim. Maj. Op. at 14–15. Such a conclusion,\nhowever, rests on the premise that deference to state officials\nis necessarily incompatible with strict scrutiny analysis. See\nMaj. Op. at 17 (“Although one instruction recites strict\nscrutiny, the deference instruction introduces a new and\ndifferent standard.”). But the instruction’s reference to\n“competing obligation[s]” simply reflects the reality that\nprison officials are forced to balance conflicting\nconsiderations—such as individual prisoner safety and the\nsafety and security of the prison as a whole—when crafting\nprison policies.\n\n    Indeed, the Supreme Court has squarely rejected the view\nthat deference and strict scrutiny are incompatible,\n\n\nthan the alleged right violated, and thereby indicates that deference should\nbe afforded any time challenges are made regarding excessive force or\nconfinement conditions, regardless of whether the challenge alleges\ndeliberate indifference or an equal protection violation. As Harrington\nchallenges his conditions of confinement, Norwood, by its terms, applies.\n\f22               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nparticularly in situations in which a certain group of state\nofficials is likely to have specialized knowledge. For\ninstance, in Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709 (2005), the\nCourt analyzed a claim under the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n1(a)(1)–(2), which prohibits the government from imposing\na substantial burden on prisoners’ religious exercise unless\nthe burden furthers a “compelling governmental interest” by\n“the least restrictive means”—the same strict scrutiny test\napplied in the equal protection context. Id. at 712. In\nconducting its strict scrutiny analysis, the Court explained\nthat it was appropriate to defer to prison officials’ expertise\nwhen engaging in such strict scrutiny analysis. Id. at 722–23,\n725 n.13.\n\n    Similarly, in Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003),\nsuperseded on other grounds by Mich. Const. art I, § 26, the\nCourt deferred to law school officials when evaluating\nwhether the school’s race-based admissions policy withstood\nthe scrutiny analysis required for equal protection claims. Id.\nat 327–28. Specifically, the Court deferred to the officials’\nunique ability to determine whether diversity was essential to\nthe law school’s educational mission and thereby qualified as\na compelling state interest. Id. Thus, the Supreme Court has\nmade clear that strict scrutiny and deference to state officials\nare by no means incompatible, even in the equal protection\ncontext.\n\n    The majority accurately quotes the crucial passage from\nJohnson that rejects the Turner standard of review because\n“such deference is fundamentally at odds with our equal\nprotection jurisprudence.” See Maj. Op. at 14 (quoting\nJohnson, 543 U.S. at 506 n.1). But the passage must be read\nin light of the opinion as a whole. In Johnson, the Court\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                     23\n\nrejected a lenient standard of review that fails to put the\nburden on state officials to articulate a compelling reason for\nengaging in race-based action—a standard that is necessarily\nincompatible with strict scrutiny. Viewed in such context, the\npassage simply identifies the inherent conflict between the\nTurner standard and the strict scrutiny standard. Here,\nhowever, there is no such inherent conflict in applying\ndeference within the strict scrutiny framework.\n\n    Rather, such a strict scrutiny standard can, and indeed,\nunder Norwood, must, accommodate a different form of\ndeference—one that acknowledges the expertise of prison\nofficials in crafting policies to promote prison safety and\ndiscipline.\n\n                              II\n\n    Because the trial court’s jury instructions accurately\nintegrate such deference into the strict scrutiny analysis\nrequired by Johnson, I would affirm the jury’s verdict\nrejecting Harrington’s equal protection claim and would\naffirm the judgment in its entirety.\n\f",

California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137748\"><a href=\"/opinion/137748/johnson-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), that\nstrict scrutiny applies to claims challenging racial\nclassifications in prison, and the line of authorities, such as\nTurner v.

We affirm\nthe judgment with respect to the Eighth Amendment\ndeliberate indifference claim. We reverse with respect to the\nequal protection claim because the jury instructions were\ninconsistent with the requirements of strict scrutiny. That\nerror, which absolved the prison officials of their obligation\nto demonstrate that the race-based action was narrowly\ntailored, violated the tenets of Johnson and was prejudicial.\n\n                       BACKGROUND\n\n    Early 2004 was a violent period at California State\nPrison–Corcoran. In February and March, multiple violent\nincidents occurred, each involving African American inmates\nassociated with gangs. Five more violent incidents occurred\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                      5\n\nover the next two months, including riots involving white\ninmates and inmates associated with certain “disruptive\ngroups,” which are groups of individuals who have formed an\nalliance and act, often aggressively, at the direction of a\nleader. Prison officials also reported receiving information of\na statewide risk that unidentified African American inmates\nwould attack prison staff.\n\n    In response, the prison instituted a lockdown on African\nAmerican inmates due “to multiple batteries on staff by\nBlacks . . . coupled with information indicating a coalition of\nBlack inmates are plotting the murder of staff,” as was\nexplained in a Program Status Report, a weekly memorandum\nissued during periods of modified programming. That\nlockdown was followed by a state of emergency lockdown\napplicable to inmates of all races. As part of the emergency\naction, the prison instituted shower restrictions that, among\nother things, allowed inmates to wear only minimal\nclothing—boxer shorts and shower shoes—and required them\nto be handcuffed while being escorted to the shower.\nEventually, the shower restrictions were lifted for all inmates\nexcept African American inmates, including Garrick\nHarrington, and members of the Northern Hispanic disruptive\ngroup. An updated Program Status Report explained that,\namongst other things, “batteries on staff by various factions\nof black inmates” were an “ongoing state-wide concern\nindicating a mindset by this ethnic group to harm staff.” Over\ntime, the shower restrictions were eased for additional groups,\nincluding older African American inmates. The state of\nemergency ended, and the prison gradually lifted the\nlockdown restrictions and returned to normal programming.\n\n    While the race-based shower restrictions were still in\nplace, Harrington—who was not involved in the violent\n\f6                HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\naltercations that led to the lockdown and was not associated\nwith a gang or disruptive group—requested that he be\npermitted to walk to the showers wearing his government-\nissued boots instead of the shower slippers, which he\ndescribed as “flimsy.” A correctional officer denied his\nrequest, then escorted Harrington, who was handcuffed and\nwearing shower slippers, to a shower on another floor, all the\nwhile following behind without assisting him. Harrington\ncame upon a pool of water and testified that he heard a\ncorrectional officer say, “It’s slippery there.” Harrington\nslipped in the water, fell, and injured his back. Despite\ntreatments, his pain continues, requiring medication.\n\n     Harrington filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\nseveral prison officials, alleging claims for deliberate\nindifference in violation of the Eighth Amendment and for\nrace discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. His repeated requests\nfor the appointment of counsel were denied, an issue he raises\nagain on appeal. The case proceeded to trial, where the jury\nfound for the prison officials. Harrington challenges the\nverdict on the grounds that the jury was improperly instructed\non both of his constitutional claims.\n\n                         ANALYSIS\n\nI.     EIGHTH AMENDMENT CLAIM\n\n    The Eighth Amendment claim centers on the jury\ninstructions on deliberate indifference. The court instructed\nthe jury that “[t]o establish deliberate indifference, the\nplaintiff must prove that a defendant knew that the plaintiff\nfaced a substantial risk of serious harm and disregarded that\nrisk by failing to take reasonable measures to correct it.”\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                      7\n\nBefore trial, Harrington proposed an additional “knowledge”\ninstruction that the court declined to give to the jury. After\nthe close of evidence, the court reviewed the proposed jury\ninstructions with the parties and gave them time to\nindependently review the instructions. Upon reconvening,\nthe court asked whether Harrington had any “corrections,\nadditions, deletions, modifications or objections.” Harrington\noffered one change, unrelated to the deliberate indifference\nstandard.\n\n    During jury deliberations, the jury submitted two\nquestions to the court: “What is serious risk of injury? Please\ndefine. Is the fact that the areas around all the showers are\nalways wet constituting [sic] a serious risk of injury?”\nOutside the presence of the jury, the court discussed several\ncases in detail with the parties and concluded that none of the\ncases defined “serious risk” (or, as the original instruction\nhad put it, “substantial risk”) in the context of an Eighth\nAmendment claim. Harrington then noted that caselaw\nsupports the notion that “knowledge can be demonstrated of\nthe substantial risk simply because it was obvious”; counsel\nfor the defendants pointed out in response that the jury’s\ninquiry did not pertain to knowledge. Upon the jury’s return,\nthe court gave supplemental instructions that the jury was “to\ndetermine whether any defendant acted with deliberate\nindifference to a known risk,” and that “[k]nown risk means\nthat the person who has the duty to protect from it has to have\nknowledge that there is a known hazard or known danger of\nserious harm.”\n\n    In Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994), the Supreme\nCourt outlined the standard for Eighth Amendment liability\nfor acting with “deliberate indifference” to inmate safety. At\nthe outset, the Court rejected the “invitation to adopt an\n\f8                HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nobjective test for deliberate indifference.” Id. at 837. To\nprove deliberate indifference, subjective recklessness is\nrequired, that is, an official “cannot be found liable under the\nEighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions\nof confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an\nexcessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must\nboth be aware of facts from which the inference could be\ndrawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he\nmust also draw the inference.” Id. Constructive notice does\nnot suffice to prove the requisite knowledge, but “[w]hether\na prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial\nrisk is a question of fact subject to demonstration in the usual\nways, including inference from circumstantial evidence.” Id.\nat 841–42.\n\n    The court’s original Eighth Amendment instruction\nessentially restates the elements of the Farmer test by\nrequiring knowledge of a “substantial risk of serious harm”\nand that a defendant “disregarded that risk.” The instruction\ndoes not mention that such knowledge may be established by\ncircumstantial evidence, as did Harrington’s additional\nproposed instruction. But the jury was not totally without\nguidance on this point. The court gave a general instruction\non the definitions of circumstantial evidence and direct\nevidence and stated, “You should consider both kinds of\nevidence. The law makes no distinction between the weight\nto be given to either direct or circumstantial evidence. It is\nfor you to decide how much weight to give to any evidence.”\nThe court put no restrictions on Harrington’s ability to argue\nthat circumstantial evidence supported his claim.

The question we consider in this § 1983\ncase, in the context of the jury instructions on equal\nprotection, is the relationship between these principles when\nrace classifications collide with prison security concerns.\n\n     A. JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n    The court gave a trio of instructions related to\nHarrington’s equal protection claim. It began with an\ninstruction on “Prisoner’s Claim Regarding Denial of Equal\nProtection”:\n\n           Prisoners are protected from racial\n       discrimination by the Equal Protection Clause\n       of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n       States Constitution. On his equal protection\n       claim, the plaintiff must prove by a\n       preponderance of the evidence that\n       defendants . . . acted with an intent or purpose\n\f                   HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                          11\n\n        to discriminate against the plaintiff, or against\n        a class of which the plaintiff is a member,\n        based on his race.\n\n            Intentional discrimination means that a\n        defendant acted at least in part because of the\n        plaintiff’s race.\n\n    The court then instructed the jury that “[t]he state may\ntake race-based action when necessary to further a compelling\ngovernmental interest,” if the action is “narrowly tailored to\nserve such a governmental interest.” The court followed that\ninstruction by telling the jury that “[i]n considering whether\n[the defendants] discriminated against plaintiff because of his\nrace, you should consider that defendants had a competing\nobligation under the Eighth Amendment to ensure the safety\nof prisoners, including protecting prisoners from each other\nand/or maintaining institutional security. In considering these\nfactors, you should respect and give deference to the opinion\nof prison officials in their adoption and execution of policies\nand practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve\ndiscipline and to maintain internal security in a prison.”\n\n    Harrington challenges the latter instruction, which at trial\nwas denominated as “the Norwood instruction.”1 He argues\nthat its effect was to lessen the scrutiny that the jury applied\nto the equal protection claim. Harrington’s proposed strict\nscrutiny instructions did not mention or carve out deference.\n\n\n\n\n 1\n    In Norwood, which involved a claimed Eighth Amendment violation\nfor denial of outdoor exercise, the court endorsed an almost identical\ndeference instruction. 591 F.3d at 1066.\n\f12               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\n    After the court reviewed the Norwood instruction with the\nparties and solicited their views, Harrington told the court\nthat he was “unclear” on this instruction because “that wasn’t\nthe strict scrutiny instruction.” Through his proposed strict\nscrutiny instruction plus his response to the court on the\nNorwood instruction, the court was on notice as to\nHarrington’s position. Harrington did not waive this error.\nWe review de novo whether the instruction misstates the law.\nIf so, the error warrants reversal, unless it is harmless. Dang\nv.

JOHNSON V. CALIFORNIA, RACIAL CLASSIFICATIONS\n        AND NARROW TAILORING\n\n    The Supreme Court has recognized that “racial\nclassifications ‘threaten to stigmatize individuals by reason of\ntheir membership in a racial group and to incite racial\nhostility.’” Johnson, 543 U.S. at 507 (quoting Shaw v. Reno,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643 (1993)) (emphasis omitted).\nConsequently, racial classifications in prisons are\n“immediately suspect” and subject to strict scrutiny, which\nrequires the government to prove that the measures are\nnarrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.\nId. at 509 (quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 642).\n\n    Johnson arose in the context of a California Department\nof Corrections “unwritten policy of racially segregating\nprisoners” each time they entered a new correctional facility.\nId. at 502. Like the lockdown and restrictions imposed here,\nthe CDC attempted to justify the practice “to prevent violence\ncaused by racial gangs.” Id.\n\n    In reaffirming the strict scrutiny standard, the Court\nreviewed its past cases, such as Lee v. Washington, 390 U.S.\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                      13\n\n333 (1968) (per curiam), applying heightened review “in\nevaluating racial segregation in prisons.” Johnson, 543 U.S.\nat 506–07. It emphasized that “strict scrutiny is no less\nimportant” where “prison officials cite racial violence as the\nreason for their policy.” Id. at 507.\n\n    Significant to our case, the prison officials in Johnson\nalleged that their judgments were entitled to the same\ndeference as the defendants in Turner. Id. at 509. The Court\nrebuffed this effort, noting that Turner did not involve a race-\nbased classification and had never been applied to racial\nclassifications. The reason is that “[t]he right not to be\ndiscriminated against based on one’s race is not susceptible\nto the logic of Turner. It is not a right that need necessarily\nbe compromised for the sake of proper prison\nadministration.” Id. at 510.\n\n    The Court went on to confirm its implicit holding in Lee:\n“The ‘necessities of prison security and discipline,’ are a\ncompelling government interest justifying only those uses of\nrace that are narrowly tailored to address those necessities.”\nJohnson, 543 U.S. at 512 (citation omitted) (quoting Lee,\n390 U.S. at 334). The bottom line is that prison security and\ndeference to prison authorities do not trump Johnson’s\nnarrow tailoring requirement.\n\n    We have not addressed previously the relationship\nbetween strict scrutiny in a race discrimination equal\nprotection claim and the principle of deference to prison\nofficials that originated in cases involving Eighth\nAmendment claims. In Norwood, we established that\n“[p]rison officials are entitled to deference whether a prisoner\nchallenges excessive force or conditions of confinement.”\n591 F.3d at 1067. In Norwood, however, only Eighth\n\f14               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nAmendment claims were before the court. Tellingly, we\n“express[ed] no view as to the race-based aspect of the\nlockdowns” that were challenged, nor did we take a position\non “any potential Equal Protection claim.” Id. at 1066 n.1.\nThis case requires us to consider precisely the questions left\nunanswered in Norwood. We now conclude that even where\ndeference is owed to prison officials as to one claim in a suit,\nsuch as an Eighth Amendment claim, the strict scrutiny\nanalysis of an equal protection claim does not\nindiscriminately incorporate that deference. Nor do the\nclaims compete.\n\n    This approach is in keeping with the Supreme Court’s\nobservations on the more deferential test that Justice Thomas\nwould have applied in Johnson: “Justice Thomas takes a\nhands-off approach to racial classifications in prisons,\nsuggesting that a ‘compelling showing [is] needed to\novercome the deference we owe to prison administrators.’\nBut such deference is fundamentally at odds with our equal\nprotection jurisprudence. We put the burden on state actors\nto demonstrate that their race-based policies are justified.”\n543 U.S. at 506 n.1 (citation omitted).\n\n     The district court accurately instructed the jury on the\nelements of race discrimination and strict scrutiny. The jury\nwas told that the race-based action could be justified if it was\nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest.\nSo far, so good. But the follow-on instruction on deference,\nwhich was specifically pegged to the race claim, basically\npulled the rug out from under the narrow tailoring\nrequirement. The instruction pitched the two claims as\ncompeting against one another—“[i]n considering whether\ndefendants . . . discriminated against [Harrington] because of\nhis race, you should consider that defendants had a competing\n\f                  HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                      15\n\nobligation under the Eighth Amendment to ensure the safety\nof prisoners . . . .” It thus suggested that Harrington’s success\non the equal protection claim was in some way dependent on\nthe defendants’ loss on the Eighth Amendment claim. Then\nthe instruction took an even more devastating blow to the\nnarrow tailoring requirement by enshrining the “policies and\npractices” of prison officials with broad deference rather than\nputting the specific practices challenged here to the test of\nnarrow tailoring. In doing so, the court diluted the\nrequirements of strict scrutiny by introducing the notion that\nthe standard governing a race discrimination claim is in\nequipoise with the deference owed to prison officials in an\nEighth Amendment context, even though the analysis for\neach type of claim differs.\n\n    We conclude that the court erred when it instructed the\njury that the prison’s obligations under the Eighth\nAmendment compete with its obligations under the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. A\nprisoner’s success on an equal protection claim is not\ndependent on whether the government met its obligations\nunder the Eighth Amendment. In light of Johnson’s clear\ndirection, the court also erred by allowing the jury to defer\ngenerally to officials when considering Harrington’s equal\nprotection claim, rather than assessing whether the challenged\nrace-based actions were narrowly tailored.\n\n    Our analysis should not be read to mean that deference\nplays no role in prisoners’ constitutional claims. Writing\nwith respect to First Amendment and right to marry\nregulations in the prison context, the Supreme Court in\nTurner explained: “Subjecting the day-to-day judgments of\nprison officials to an inflexible strict scrutiny analysis would\nseriously hamper their ability to anticipate security problems\n\f16               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nand to adopt innovative solutions to the intractable problems\nof prison administration.” 482 U.S. at 89. In a recent Fourth\nAmendment case, the Court “confirmed the importance of\ndeference to correctional officials” in the context of\nmaintaining security and discipline in the jail.

Likewise, in the Norwood\nchallenge to prison conditions relating to lockdowns and\noutdoor exercise, we reiterated the importance of deference.\n591 F.3d at 1067.\n\n     But none of these cases involved claims governed by\nstrict scrutiny, which allows deference a limited role.

This circular response simply skirts the\nissue. The jury answered no to the following question: “On\nPlaintiff’s equal protection claim, did any Defendant\nintentionally discriminate against Plaintiff on account of his\nrace in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.” If the\nanswer was no, the defendants argue, then that was the end of\nHarrington’s equal protection claim. But the jury gave this\nanswer after having been instructed that the strict scrutiny\nstandard governing whether the defendants acted “in violation\nof the Equal Protection Clause” could give way to the lesser\ndeference standard in evaluating the race claim. The flaw in\nthe instructions thus skewed how the jury would have\nunderstood the verdict form. The error is prejudicial. See\nWilkerson v.

Although there were\nsome tricky legal issues regarding the instructions,\nHarrington spotted the key jury instruction issue that is the\nsubject of this opinion.

As the\nJohnson Court emphasized throughout its opinion, the two\nstandards are fundamentally incompatible—the Turner\nstandard requires merely a reasonable relationship to\nlegitimate interests, while strict scrutiny requires “narrow[]\ntailor[ing]” to a “compelling” interest. Id. at 505 (emphasis\nadded). Thus, Johnson established that when evaluating\nequal protection claims against prison officials, strict, rather\nthan intermediate, scrutiny is the applicable test.\n\n    Our decision in Norwood v.

Rather, we instructed\nthat “[p]rison officials are entitled to deference whether a\nprisoner challenges excessive force or conditions of\nconfinement.” Id. at 1067 (emphasis added).1\n\n\n  1\n   The majority is correct in its observation that Norwood specifically\naddressed only Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claims.

Maj. Op. at\n14. The trial court then, as required by Norwood, instructed\nthe jury that prison officials are entitled to deference in their\nevaluation and adoption of prison policies necessary to\nmaintain prison security and discipline—the very goals\nidentified in Johnson as compelling interests that might\njustify race-based prison policies. 543 U.S. at 512.\n\n    According to the majority, this second instruction “pulled\nthe rug out from under the narrow tailoring requirement” by\nsuggesting that Harrington’s equal protection claim was\n“competing” with the prison officials’ defense on the Eighth\nAmendment claim. Maj. Op. at 14–15. Such a conclusion,\nhowever, rests on the premise that deference to state officials\nis necessarily incompatible with strict scrutiny analysis. See\nMaj. Op. at 17 (“Although one instruction recites strict\nscrutiny, the deference instruction introduces a new and\ndifferent standard.”). But the instruction’s reference to\n“competing obligation[s]” simply reflects the reality that\nprison officials are forced to balance conflicting\nconsiderations—such as individual prisoner safety and the\nsafety and security of the prison as a whole—when crafting\nprison policies.\n\n    Indeed, the Supreme Court has squarely rejected the view\nthat deference and strict scrutiny are incompatible,\n\n\nthan the alleged right violated, and thereby indicates that deference should\nbe afforded any time challenges are made regarding excessive force or\nconfinement conditions, regardless of whether the challenge alleges\ndeliberate indifference or an equal protection violation. As Harrington\nchallenges his conditions of confinement, Norwood, by its terms, applies.\n\f22               HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER\n\nparticularly in situations in which a certain group of state\nofficials is likely to have specialized knowledge. For\ninstance, in Cutter v. Wilkinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142900\"><a href=\"/opinion/142900/cutter-v-wilkinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">709</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005), the\nCourt analyzed a claim under the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-\n1(a)(1)–(2), which prohibits the government from imposing\na substantial burden on prisoners’ religious exercise unless\nthe burden furthers a “compelling governmental interest” by\n“the least restrictive means”—the same strict scrutiny test\napplied in the equal protection context. Id. at 712. In\nconducting its strict scrutiny analysis, the Court explained\nthat it was appropriate to defer to prison officials’ expertise\nwhen engaging in such strict scrutiny analysis. Id. at 722–23,\n725 n.13.\n\n    Similarly, in Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003),\nsuperseded on other grounds by Mich. Const. art I, § 26, the\nCourt deferred to law school officials when evaluating\nwhether the school’s race-based admissions policy withstood\nthe scrutiny analysis required for equal protection claims. Id.\nat 327–28. Specifically, the Court deferred to the officials’\nunique ability to determine whether diversity was essential to\nthe law school’s educational mission and thereby qualified as\na compelling state interest. Id. Thus, the Supreme Court has\nmade clear that strict scrutiny and deference to state officials\nare by no means incompatible, even in the equal protection\ncontext.\n\n    The majority accurately quotes the crucial passage from\nJohnson that rejects the Turner standard of review because\n“such deference is fundamentally at odds with our equal\nprotection jurisprudence.” See Maj. Op. at 14 (quoting\nJohnson, 543 U.S. at 506 n.1). But the passage must be read\nin light of the opinion as a whole. In Johnson, the Court\n\f                 HARRINGTON V. SCRIBNER                     23\n\nrejected a lenient standard of review that fails to put the\nburden on state officials to articulate a compelling reason for\nengaging in race-based action—a standard that is necessarily\nincompatible with strict scrutiny. Viewed in such context, the\npassage simply identifies the inherent conflict between the\nTurner standard and the strict scrutiny standard. Here,\nhowever, there is no such inherent conflict in applying\ndeference within the strict scrutiny framework.\n\n    Rather, such a strict scrutiny standard can, and indeed,\nunder Norwood, must, accommodate a different form of\ndeference—one that acknowledges the expertise of prison\nofficials in crafting policies to promote prison safety and\ndiscipline.\n\n                              II\n\n    Because the trial court’s jury instructions accurately\nintegrate such deference into the strict scrutiny analysis\nrequired by Johnson, I would affirm the jury’s verdict\nrejecting Harrington’s equal protection claim and would\naffirm the judgment in its entirety.\n\f</pre>",
