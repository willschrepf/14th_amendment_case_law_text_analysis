BATCHELDER, Chief Judge. In 1992, a Tennessee jury convicted Petitioner-Appellant\r\nHenry Hodges of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. The state courts upheld the conviction\r\nand sentence on appeal and denied Hodges’s petition for post-conviction relief. Hodges then petitioned for\r\nfederal habeas relief, which the district court denied. Hodges now appeals that denial to this court. For the\r\nfollowing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Hodges’s habeas petition.\r\n\r\n                                                  FACTS\r\n\r\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court summarized the facts of this case as follows:\r\n\r\n       The defendant, Henry Eugene Hodges, entered a guilty plea and was convicted of\r\n       premeditated first-degree murder. Thereafter, the penalty phase of the trial commenced. The\r\n       State presented proof of the circumstances of the offense through the testimony of Trina\r\n       Brown, the defendant’s fifteen-year-old girlfriend. Brown testified that one week before the\r\n       murder she and the twenty-four-year-old defendant, who were living with the defendant’s\r\n       brother in Smyrna, Tennessee, decided to move to Florida. To get money for the move,\r\n       Hodges, a male homosexual prostitute, told Brown that he would rob and kill the next person\r\n       who propositioned him. Hodges discussed with Brown how the crimes would be carried out.\r\n       Hodges repeated these statements on May 14, 1990, the day of this murder.\r\n       On the night of May 14, Brown and Hodges went to Centennial Park in Nashville. When\r\n       the victim, Ronald Bassett, approached, Hodges talked with him, and they left together in\r\n       the victim’s vehicle and went to the victim’s residence at 3133A, Parthenon Avenue, across\r\n       from Centennial Park. Ten or fifteen minutes later, Hodges returned to the park on foot, and\r\n       along with Brown, drove back to the victim’s residence in his own car. Hodges told Brown\r\n       to lie down in the backseat of the car so no one could see her. When they arrived at the\r\n       victim’s residence, Hodges told Brown to wait in the car. After an unspecified period of\r\n       time, Hodges returned to the car, wearing gloves, and asked Brown to come into the house.\r\n       Brown testified that when she arrived, Bassett was lying face down on the bed in his\r\n       bedroom with a pillow over his head. Hodges had bound his feet together with duct tape and\r\n       had handcuffed his hands. While Bassett lay helplessly, Brown and the defendant ransacked\r\n       the house searching for items of value. After obtaining the personal identification number\r\n       for the victim’s automatic teller card, Brown and the defendant “took a break,” drank a coke,\r\n       and discussed whether to kill Bassett. Brown testified that she told Hodges to kill Bassett\r\n       to prevent their arrest. Hodges then went into the bedroom and, ignoring the victim’s pleas\r\n\fNo. 09-5021               Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 3\r\n\r\n\r\n     not to kill him, strangled Bassett to death with a nylon rope. Brown testified that she heard\r\n     Bassett moan and make a choking sound and that it took about five minutes for Bassett to\r\n     die.\r\n     In an attempt to remove any fingerprints, the defendant wiped off various items in the\r\n     residence. After turning the air conditioner in Bassett’s bedroom on high to prevent\r\n     discovery of the body, Hodges and Brown left the victim’s residence, taking the victim’s\r\n     automobile and several items of personal property, including jewelry, a gun, and a VCR.\r\n     After using Bassett’s automatic teller card to withdraw the twenty-four-hour maximum of\r\n     four hundred dollars from his account, the pair returned to the house of the defendant’s\r\n     brother and went to bed. The next day, having learned that the victim’s body had been\r\n     discovered, Brown and the defendant abandoned the victim’s car in rural Rutherford County\r\n     and drove to Georgia in their own car. They were eventually arrested in North Carolina.\r\n     Items of the victim’s personal property were found in their possession at this time. Also, the\r\n     defendant’s fingerprints were found on items inside Bassett’s home, and Brown had been\r\n     photographed withdrawing money with Bassett’s automatic teller card.\r\n     Testifying for the State at the sentencing hearing, Dr. Charles Harlan, the chief medical\r\n     examiner for Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County, confirmed that Bassett had died\r\n     from ligature strangulation. Dr. Harlan opined that Bassett would have remained alive and\r\n     conscious for at least three and perhaps as long as five minutes during the strangulation.\r\n     Harlan also found abrasions on the victim’s wrists consistent with handcuffs.\r\n     The State proved that the defendant had been convicted of armed robbery, attempted\r\n     kidnaping and robbery in Hamilton County in 1984. The State also established that the\r\n     defendant had been convicted of murder in Fulton County, Georgia, in July 1990. The\r\n     record reveals that the Georgia killing occurred when the defendant and Brown arrived in\r\n     Atlanta after murdering Bassett. Hodges made arrangements with a man to engage in\r\n     homosexual acts for an agreed price. Hodges accompanied the man to his motel room, but\r\n     when the man was unable to pay the agreed price, Hodges murdered him.\r\n     In mitigation, the defendant testified and also presented the testimony of his mother, his\r\n     brothers and Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a child psychiatrist. This proof showed that the defendant\r\n     was the next to youngest of his mother’s five sons. His mother and father were not married.\r\n     His father was actually married to another woman, but engaged in what one of the witnesses\r\n     described as an “irregular union” with the defendant’s mother for eighteen years. The\r\n     defendant’s father abused the defendant’s mother and was strict with the defendant’s\r\n     brothers, three of whom were the children of another man. The defendant, however, was his\r\n     father’s favorite and was spoiled. Financial difficulties forced the family to move about\r\n     frequently, and defendant’s father supported the family only sporadically.\r\n     The defense introduced proof to show that Hodges seemed normal until he was twelve years\r\n     old. At that time, he began to associate with older boys, sniff glue and gasoline, be truant\r\n     from school, and run away from home. He also engaged in sexual activities with his younger\r\n\fNo. 09-5021               Hodges v. Colson                                                         Page 4\r\n\r\n\r\n     brother and attempted sexual activities with a female cousin. He became involved with the\r\n     juvenile authorities and was confined to a juvenile facility in Chattanooga.\r\n     Through his mitigation proof, the defendant attempted to establish that a catalyst and major\r\n     contributing cause of his delinquent and later criminal behavior was his rape and sexual\r\n     abuse by a stranger when he was twelve years old. According to the defendant, he accepted\r\n     a stranger’s offer of a ride home when he was playing a short distance from his home on\r\n     Fessler’s Lane in Nashville. Rather than driving Hodges home, the stranger drove Hodges\r\n     to his home and raped him. Fearing rejection by his homophobic father and driven by guilt,\r\n     the defendant told no one of this incident until he was arrested in 1990.\r\n     Dr. Nurcombe testified that, while the defendant suffered from an antisocial personality\r\n     disorder, low self-esteem, and substance (marijuana) abuse, the killing was motivated by a\r\n     subconscious desire for revenge for the sexual abuse inflicted on him when he was twelve,\r\n     coupled with Hodges’ fear that his family might discover that he was engaged in homosexual\r\n     prostitution since Brown had told Hodge’s [sic] sister-in-law shortly before the killing that\r\n     he was a homosexual prostitute. The defense also introduced testimony that Brown\r\n     dominated and manipulated the defendant.\r\n     In rebuttal the State called Dr. James Kyser, a forensic psychiatrist, and Dr. Leonard\r\n     Morgan, a clinical psychologist. Both had examined the defendant and concluded that he\r\n     suffered from an antisocial personality disorder. They described persons with this disorder\r\n     as having “no conscience,” being “self centered,” being “notoriously dishonest and\r\n     untruthful,” and having “very little regard for the feelings of others and . . . willing to use\r\n     any means to get what they want, no matter who it hurts.” While acknowledging the\r\n     complicated factors involved in antisocial personality disorders, the State’s experts\r\n     discounted the singular importance of the one incident of alleged sexual abuse in causing the\r\n     defendant’s actions. Dr. Morgan concluded that the defendant “was in complete control of\r\n     his behavior” and not suffering from mental illness or emotional disturbance.\r\n     Based on the evidence presented, the jury determined that the State had proven the existence\r\n     of three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) “[t]he defendant was\r\n     previously convicted of one or more felonies, other than the present charge whose statutory\r\n     elements involve the use of violence to the person;” (2) “[t]he murder was especially\r\n     heinous, atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse beyond that\r\n     necessary to produce death;” and (3) “[t]he murder was committed while the defendant was\r\n     engaged in committing, or was an accomplice in the commission of, or attempting to\r\n     commit, or fleeing after committing a robbery.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39–13–204(i)(2); (i)(5)\r\n     and (i)(7) (1991 Repl.). In addition, the jury found that the aggravating circumstances\r\n     outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and, as a result,\r\n     sentenced the defendant to death by electrocution. The trial court entered a judgment in\r\n     accordance with the jury’s verdict and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. After\r\n     reviewing the record and considering the errors alleged by the defendant, we affirm the\r\n     judgment of the trial court and Court of Criminal Appeals.\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 5\r\n\r\n\r\nTennessee v. Hodges, 944 S.W.2d 346, 349–51 (Tenn. 1997) (footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\n                                       PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n       Hodges was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to death in January 1992. The\r\nTennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his conviction and sentence in 1995. Tennessee v. Hodges,\r\nNo. 01-C-01-9212-CR00382, 1995 WL 301443 (Tenn. Crim. App. May 18, 1995). The Tennessee Supreme\r\nCourt affirmed in 1997. Hodges, 944 S.W.2d 346.\r\n\r\n       Hodges filed a petition for post-conviction relief in December 1997, and the trial court denied relief\r\nin February 1999. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed that decision in 2000. Hodges v.\r\nTennessee, No. M1999-00516-CCA-R3-PD, 2000 WL 1562865 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 20, 2000). The\r\nTennessee Supreme Court denied an application for permission to appeal in March 2001.\r\n\r\n       Hodges filed a petition to proceed in forma pauperis in federal district court in May 2001, a\r\nprovisional petition for a writ of habeas corpus in July 2001, and an amended petition in March 2002.\r\nHodges raised 32 claims and subclaims in his amended habeas petition. The district court granted some of\r\nHodges’s discovery requests, denied others, and denied Hodges’s request for an evidentiary hearing. In\r\nMarch 2008, the district court denied Hodges’s habeas petition. Hodges applied for a Certificate of\r\nAppealability (“COA”), and the district court granted a COA as to all claims.\r\n\r\n                                       STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       This court reviews de novo a district court’s legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact,\r\nand reviews its factual findings for clear error. Lucas v. O’Dea, 179 F.3d 412, 416 (6th Cir. 1999). Under\r\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”), a district court may not grant a habeas\r\npetition with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the state courts unless the\r\nadjudication resulted in a decision that: (1) was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\r\nclearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court; or (2) was based on an unreasonable\r\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state courts. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). Under\r\nthe “contrary to” clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion\r\nopposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law, or if the state court decides a case\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                         Page 6\r\n\r\n\r\ndifferently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. Williams v. Taylor,\r\n529 U.S. 362, 412–13 (2000). Under the “unreasonable application” clause, a federal habeas court may\r\ngrant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court’s\r\ndecisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the petitioner’s case. Id. To obtain habeas\r\nrelief, “a state prisoner must show that the state court’s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court\r\nwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law\r\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770, 786–87 (2011).\r\n\r\n       To analyze whether a state court decision is contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly\r\nestablished Supreme Court precedent, courts look only to the holdings of the Supreme Court’s decisions as\r\nof the time of the relevant state court decision. Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 71–72 (2003). Courts\r\nconsider lower court decisions to the extent they shed light on the analysis of Supreme Court holdings to\r\ndetermine whether a legal principle had been clearly established. Hill v. Hofbauer, 337 F.3d 706, 716 (6th\r\nCir. 2003). Finally, the state court’s factual findings are presumed correct unless rebutted by the habeas\r\npetitioner by clear and convincing evidence. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1); McAdoo v. Elo, 365 F.3d 487,\r\n493–94 (6th Cir. 2004).\r\n\r\n                                                ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       Before this court, Hodges raises four issues: (1) whether the state courts reasonably applied federal\r\nlaw in determining that certain restrictions imposed on voir dire by the trial court did not interfere with\r\nHodges’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial trial; (2) whether the district court properly denied\r\nHodges’s requests for discovery, an evidentiary hearing, and habeas relief on a claim of juror misconduct;\r\n(3) whether the state courts reasonably applied federal law in determining that Hodges’s trial counsel were\r\nnot ineffective for advising Hodges to plead guilty to murder and aggravated robbery; and (4) whether the\r\ndistrict court properly denied an evidentiary hearing and habeas relief on Hodges’s claims of incompetency\r\nat trial and ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. Hodges failed to brief the remaining claims for\r\nwhich the district court granted a COA and, therefore, has waived them. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9)(A);\r\nLandrum v. Mitchell, 625 F.3d 905, 913 (6th Cir. 2010).\r\n\f     No. 09-5021               Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 7\r\n\r\n\r\nI.        Restrictions on Voir Dire\r\n\r\n          Hodges alleges that he was denied his right to a fair and impartial jury when the trial court refused\r\nto allow his attorneys to ask prospective jurors whether they could consider a life sentence for a defendant\r\nwith a prior conviction for murder. Specifically, defense counsel repeatedly attempted to ask the following\r\nquestion or a variation thereof: “Could you impose a life sentence for somebody who has been convicted\r\nof first degree murder twice?” The trial court repeatedly sustained the prosecution’s objections to the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n          Hodges raised this claim on direct appeal. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals rejected it,\r\nfinding that each juror was asked and allowed to answer questions about whether he could follow the law,\r\nconsider a life sentence, and weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Hodges, 1995 WL\r\n301443, at *8. The court also found that a prospective juror could not answer the question “without\r\nknowing more about the facts surrounding the case,” and that the question impermissibly sought “to obtain\r\na pledge from the prospective juror.” Id. The district court found that the state court’s decision was not an\r\nunreasonable application of federal law, agreeing with the state appellate court that Hodges’s questions\r\nimproperly sought to commit the jurors to an opinion before hearing all of the evidence.\r\n\r\n          The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a trial by an impartial jury. Morgan v.\r\nIllinois, 504 U.S. 719, 726–27 (1992). An adequate voir dire to identify unqualified jurors is integral to that\r\nright. Id. at 729; Dennis v. Mitchell, 354 F.3d 511, 523–24 (6th Cir. 2003). A state court’s refusal to pose\r\n“constitutionally compelled” questions merits habeas relief. Mu’Min v. Virginia, 500 U.S. 415, 425–26\r\n(1991). Questions are constitutionally compelled only if “the trial court’s failure to ask these questions\r\n. . . render[s] the defendant’s trial fundamentally unfair.” Id.\r\n\r\n          Hodges relies primarily on Morgan in support of his position. In Morgan, the trial court did not\r\npermit defense counsel to ask prospective jurors the following question: “If you found [the defendant]\r\nguilty, would you automatically vote to impose the death penalty no matter what the facts are?” Morgan,\r\n504 U.S. at 723. The Supreme Court held that general questions about following the law were not enough\r\nand that it was error to exclude a more specific question tailored to identify jurors “who would always\r\nimpose death following conviction [of a capital offense].” Id. at 733, 735 (emphasis in original).\r\n\f No. 09-5021                      Hodges v. Colson                                                                         Page 8\r\n\r\n\r\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’ determination that the trial court’s restrictions on voir\r\ndire were permissible was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law. The trial court\r\nallowed defense counsel to ask the Morgan question, i.e., whether there was an aggravating circumstance\r\nthat would cause her automatically to impose the death penalty. In fact, the trial court went beyond that and\r\nalso allowed defense counsel to ask prospective jurors whether they could impose a life sentence on a\r\ndefendant who had a prior conviction for a violent felony.1 Only when defense counsel sought to get even\r\nmore specific—asking whether a prospective juror could impose a life sentence on a defendant who had a\r\nprior first-degree murder conviction—did the trial court restrict questioning.\r\n\r\n       This circuit has held that voir dire questions about how a potential juror would vote if given specific\r\nexamples of aggravating or mitigating evidence are not constitutionally compelled under Morgan. In\r\nDennis, 354 F.3d at 523, the petitioner alleged that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by\r\nrefusing to permit him to ask prospective jurors about specific mitigating factors, including age, lack of prior\r\ncriminal history, and environment. We held that the Ohio Supreme Court’s conclusion that the trial court\r\nallowed adequate questioning was “not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the record”\r\nand was not “contrary to United States Supreme Court precedent.” Id. at 525. We noted that the trial court\r\nhad allowed the petitioner’s counsel to ask prospective jurors about mitigating factors in general: whether\r\nor not they could consider mitigating factors and return a life sentence; whether they could follow the law;\r\nand whether any of the jury panel had strong feelings about psychological evidence concerning upbringing,\r\ndiscipline, and lack of discipline. Id. at 524–26.\r\n\r\n       Similarly, in Bedford v. Collins, 567 F.3d 225 (6th Cir. 2009), we rejected the petitioner’s claim that\r\nthe trial court improperly limited the scope of voir dire by prohibiting counsel from asking questions that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   1\r\n                      In one instance, defense counsel asked if a prospective juror could consider mitigating evidence\r\n          for a defendant who had been previously convicted of a violent felony (as opposed to a previous conviction\r\n          for first-degree murder). The juror answered “[p]robably not” and was subsequently excluded for cause.\r\n          Hodges claims the exclusion of this juror “proves the fundamental unfairness of the trial court’s restrictions\r\n          [on voir dire].” Pet.’s Br. at 69. We disagree for at least two reasons. First, the question posed to that\r\n          juror contemplated a conviction for any violent felony, which is different from a question asking about a\r\n          specific violent felony actually at issue in the trial (e.g., first-degree murder). Second, the trial court’s\r\n          exclusion of that juror on the basis of her answer to that specific question does nothing whatsoever to\r\n          suggest that the trial court was constitutionally compelled to allow the excluded questions, which focused\r\n          on first-degree murder, not violent felonies in general. Accordingly, despite Hodges’s vehement\r\n          arguments to the contrary, the exclusion of that juror does not provide compelling support for his position.\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                         Page 9\r\n\r\n\r\nsought to elicit prospective jurors’ views on the petitioner’s specific case. We noted that the trial court\r\n“drew the line at questions that sought to elicit the jurors’ views on [the petitioner’s] specific case—but\r\nmany judges understandably (and properly) would do the same thing to prevent the lawyers from\r\npreviewing their case through voir dire.” Id. at 232 (emphasis added). Ultimately we concluded that the\r\nrestrictions on voir dire “did not render the process fundamentally unfair. [The restrictions] reflect instead\r\na reasonable effort to enable adequate exploration of juror biases (on the one hand) while preventing counsel\r\nfrom extracting commitments from individual jurors as to the way they would vote (on the other).” Id.\r\n(citing Dennis, 354 F.3d at 523–25).\r\n\r\n       Other circuits agree that Morgan does not compel a trial court to allow questions about how a\r\npotential juror would vote if given specific examples of aggravating or mitigating evidence. See Richmond\r\nv. Polk, 375 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2004); United States v. McVeigh, 153 F.3d 1166, 1207 (10th Cir. 1998)\r\n(“When a defendant seeks to ask a juror to speculate or precommit on how that juror might vote based on\r\nany particular facts, the question strays beyond the purpose and protection of Morgan.”). In Richmond, the\r\nFourth Circuit addressed a claim functionally identical to the one presented here by Hodges. There, the\r\ndefendant sought to ask potential jurors “if . . . knowing that [the defendant] had a previous first-degree\r\nmurder conviction, they could still consider mitigating circumstances . . . in determining what their ultimate\r\nrecommendation as to life or death is going to be.” Richmond, 375 F.3d at 316. The trial court denied\r\ncounsel’s request to ask the question “on the basis that it was a ‘stakeout’ question aimed at determining\r\nwhat prospective jurors would do if presented with a certain state of evidence.” Id. The North Carolina\r\nSupreme Court agreed and affirmed. Id. at 329–30. The Fourth Circuit held that the North Carolina\r\nSupreme Court’s decision “was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Morgan.” Id. at 330\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). It reasoned:\r\n\r\n       Morgan does not require that a capital defendant be allowed to determine at voir dire what\r\n       a prospective juror’s sentencing decision will be if presented with a specific state of evidence\r\n       or circumstances. Rather, Morgan requires that a capital defendant be afforded an adequate\r\n       opportunity at voir dire to identify prospective jurors who, even prior to the State’s case in\r\n       chief, have predetermined to impose the death penalty.\r\n\r\nId. (internal quotation marks and formatting omitted).\r\n\f  No. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 10\r\n\r\n\r\n       We agree with the Fourth Circuit’s reasoning in Richmond, and we hereby reaffirm our own holdings\r\nin Dennis and Bedford. Trial courts have “a great deal” of discretion in conducting voir dire. Morgan, 504\r\nU.S. at 729. Morgan simply does not require a trial court to permit defense counsel to ask prospective jurors\r\nhow they would vote assuming the existence of particular mitigating or aggravating circumstances, which\r\nis essentially what defense counsel sought to do here. Morgan allows for the identification and exclusion\r\nof jurors who are biased for or against the death penalty before being presented with any evidence and\r\nwould always vote in accordance with their biases without regard to the particular facts of the particular\r\ncase. Id. at 733 (“Were voir dire not available to lay bare the foundation of petitioner’s challenge for cause\r\nagainst those prospective jurors who would always impose death following conviction, his right not to be\r\ntried by such jurors would be rendered . . . nugatory.”) (emphasis in original)). When defense counsel asks\r\nquestions about the specific aggravating and/or mitigating factors actually at issue in a case, defense counsel\r\nis no longer attempting to identify members of the venire who would always vote for the death penalty;\r\nrather, defense counsel is attempting to preview how prospective jurors will vote given the specific facts\r\nof the individual case, and Morgan does not require a trial court to allow such previews.\r\n\r\n       Here, defense counsel was permitted to ask the Morgan question and was even permitted to go\r\nbeyond that and ask questions such as whether a juror could impose a life sentence on a defendant with\r\nprevious violent-felony convictions. That was easily sufficient to comply with Morgan’s requirement that\r\na capital defendant be allowed to identify prospective jurors who would “always” vote for death. See id.\r\nThe trial court excluded only questions concerning specific aggravating factors actually at issue in the case\r\n(namely, a previous conviction for first-degree murder). Accordingly, the decision of the Tennessee Court\r\nof Criminal Appeals affirming the trial court’s restrictions on voir dire was neither contrary to nor an\r\nunreasonable application of federal law, and Hodges is not entitled to habeas relief on this claim.\r\n\r\nII.    Juror Misconduct\r\n\r\n       Hodges claims that his death sentence violates his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights\r\nbecause juror Leroy Thompson engaged in misconduct by allegedly misinforming the trial court that he\r\nwould be able to sit on the jury but then voting for the death penalty only because he was in pain due to\r\narthritis and wanted to end deliberations. Hodges included Thompson’s alleged misconduct as a ground for\r\n\f No. 09-5021                     Hodges v. Colson                                                                     Page 11\r\n\r\n\r\nhis request for an evidentiary hearing. Hodges concedes that he never raised this matter in the state courts\r\nand that it is therefore procedurally defaulted, but he contends that he can establish cause and prejudice to\r\nexcuse the procedural default.\r\n\r\n       Whether a petitioner’s federal habeas claim is barred by procedural default is a question that we\r\nreview de novo.2 Abela v. Martin, 380 F.3d 915, 922 (6th Cir. 2004). “[S]tate prisoners must give the state\r\ncourts one full opportunity to resolve any constitutional issues by invoking one complete round of the\r\nState’s established appellate review process.” O’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999). When a\r\npetitioner has failed to present the grounds to the state courts and no state remedy remains available, his\r\ngrounds are procedurally defaulted. Id. at 847–48. “[T]he exhaustion doctrine requires the petitioner to\r\npresent the same claim under the same theory to the state courts before raising it on federal habeas review.”\r\nHicks v. Straub, 377 F.3d 538, 552–53 (6th Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). The petitioner\r\nwill not be allowed to present claims never before presented in the state courts unless he can show cause\r\nto excuse his failure to present the claims and actual prejudice to his defense at trial or on appeal. Coleman\r\nv. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991). The only exception is if review is needed to prevent a fundamental\r\nmiscarriage of justice, such as when the petitioner submits new evidence showing that a constitutional\r\nviolation has probably resulted in a conviction of one who is actually innocent. Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.S.\r\n478, 495–96 (1986).\r\n\r\n       Hodges concedes that he never presented this particular claim to the state courts. He did challenge\r\nThompson for cause on the basis that Thompson was incompetent and unable to understand the proceedings,\r\nbut he never “presente[ed] the same claim under the same theory to the state courts” that he presents here.\r\nSee Hicks, 377 F.3d at 553.\r\n\r\n       Hodges no longer has any state court remedies to exhaust. Under Tennessee’s post-conviction law,\r\na prisoner challenging a conviction may file only one petition attacking a single judgment. Tenn. Code Ann.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  2\r\n                   We recognize that the district court did not discuss whether this claim was procedurally\r\n         defaulted because it found that Leroy Thompson did not serve on the jury. That finding was clearly\r\n         erroneous; Leroy Thompson’s name appears on the verdict form. The district court’s failure to discuss\r\n         procedural default of this claim does not prohibit this court from considering it, cf. Elzy v. United States,\r\n         205 F.3d 882, 886 (6th Cir. 2000) (“we nonetheless may raise [the issue of procedural default] sua\r\n         sponte”), particularly in light of the fact that the State argued that the claim was procedurally defaulted in\r\n         both the district court and in this court.\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 12\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 40-30-102(c). A prisoner may file a motion to reopen his first post-conviction petition only if his claim\r\nstems from a newly established constitutional right that applies retroactively, relies on scientific evidence\r\nthat he is actually innocent, or involves a sentence enhanced because of a previous conviction that has been\r\ndeclared invalid. Fletcher v. Tennessee, 951 S.W.2d 378, 380–81 (Tenn. 1997) (citing Tenn. Code Ann.\r\n§ 40-30-217(a) (1996 Supp.)). Hodges’s juror misconduct claim does not fall within any of these\r\nexceptions. Because he failed to present the claim to the state courts and no state court remedies remain\r\navailable, the claim is procedurally defaulted. See O’Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 848.\r\n\r\n       At the district court, Hodges argued that various causes could excuse his procedural default,\r\nincluding ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel,\r\nreliance on Thompson’s responses in voir dire, and Hodges’s inability to locate Thompson before the post-\r\nconviction evidentiary hearing. Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute cause for a procedural\r\ndefault. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at 492. However, “an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim asserted as\r\ncause for the procedural default of another claim can itself be procedurally defaulted.” Edwards v.\r\nCarpenter, 529 U.S. 446, 453 (2000). In post-conviction proceedings, Hodges raised a claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of appellate counsel regarding Thompson’s competence. He did not claim that appellate counsel\r\nwere ineffective for failing to raise the claim that Thompson engaged in misconduct. Accordingly, Hodges\r\ncannot rely on ineffective assistance of counsel to establish cause to excuse his procedural default.\r\n\r\n       Nor can Hodges rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to establish cause to excuse\r\nhis default, even if this holding is not so clear-cut as it once would have been. Historically, the federal\r\ncourts have held that there is no constitutional right to an attorney in post-conviction proceedings, and that\r\nineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel therefore cannot establish cause for procedural default.\r\nSee Carpenter, 529 U.S. at 450–53; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 752; Landrum, 625 F.3d at 919. But the Supreme\r\nCourt recently held in Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012), that there is a “narrow exception” to\r\nColeman: “Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial review collateral proceedings may establish cause for\r\na procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.” Id. at 1315 (emphasis added). This\r\n“equitable”—as opposed to constitutional—exception is premised on Coleman itself, a case in which the\r\nCourt declined to address the situation in which “state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can\r\npresent a challenge to his conviction.” Coleman, 501 U.S. at 755. The Martinez Court held that in such\r\n\f No. 09-5021                    Hodges v. Colson                                                                     Page 13\r\n\r\n\r\nsituations ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel may be raised as cause to excuse procedural\r\ndefault because “the collateral proceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner’s direct appeal as\r\nto the ineffective assistance claim.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1317.\r\n\r\n       The Court in Martinez purported to craft a narrow exception3 to Coleman. We will assume that the\r\nSupreme Court meant exactly what it wrote:                   “Coleman held that an attorney’s negligence in a\r\npostconviction proceeding does not establish cause, and this remains true except as to initial-review\r\ncollateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.” Id. at 1316 (emphasis added).\r\nThe Supreme Court further insisted:\r\n\r\n       The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances recognized here. The\r\n       holding in this case does not concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings,\r\n       including appeals from initial-review collateral proceedings, second or successive collateral\r\n       proceedings, and petitions for discretionary review in a State’s appellate courts. It does not\r\n       extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond the first occasion the State allows a\r\n       prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial, even though that initial-review\r\n       collateral proceeding may be deficient for other reasons. In addition, the limited nature of\r\n       the qualification to Coleman adopted here reflects the importance of the right to the effective\r\n       assistance of trial counsel and Arizona’s decision to bar defendants from raising\r\n       ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal. Our holding here addresses only the\r\n       constitutional claims presented in this case, where the State barred the defendant from\r\n       raising the claims on direct appeal.\r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted; emphases added).\r\n\r\n       We will address Hodges’s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a different section, but\r\nhere he claims ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel as cause to excuse default of his claim of\r\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to raise the juror misconduct issue on direct appeal.\r\nUnder Martinez’s unambiguous holding our previous understanding of Coleman in this regard is still the\r\nlaw—ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel cannot supply cause for procedural default of a claim\r\nof ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See, e.g., Landrum, 625 F.3d at 919. Moreover, 28 U.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  3\r\n                    We are reminded of one jurist’s statement, made in a different context, that “[e]xceptions to\r\n         categorical rules, once created, are difficult to cabin; the logic of the new rule, like water, finds its own\r\n         level, and it’s hard to keep it from covering far more than anticipated.” United States v. Alvarez, 638 F.3d\r\n         666, 667 (9th Cir. 2011) (Kozinsky, C.J., concurring).\r\n\f No. 09-5021                  Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 14\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2254(i) bars a claim of ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel as a separate ground for relief,\r\nsee Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1320, and Hodges has not presented any evidence to justify review of his claim\r\nin order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, Hodges cannot rely on statements made by Thompson at voir dire or difficulties in\r\nlocating Thompson during state post-conviction proceedings to establish cause. Thompson discussed his\r\npain-causing arthritis at voir dire on January 27, 1992. The verdict form is dated January 30, 1992. Hodges\r\nfiled his petition for state post-conviction relief on December 11, 1997. He first attempted to locate\r\nThompson in or around June 1998. Hodges gives no explanation whatsoever as to why nearly six-and-a-half\r\nyears elapsed between his conviction and his first attempt to locate Thompson. Moreover, Hodges gives\r\nno explanation as to why or how he was able to locate Thompson for the federal habeas proceeding but not\r\nfor the state post-conviction proceeding.\r\n\r\n       “[T]he existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can\r\nshow that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel’s efforts to comply with the State’s\r\nprocedural rule.” Carrier, 477 U.S. at 479. For nearly six-and-a-half years, Hodges was aware that\r\nThompson had arthritis and may have been in pain during jury deliberations but failed to seek him out. The\r\nfact that Hodges did not even attempt to locate Thompson until it was nearly too late, and then could not\r\nfind him in time to present his testimony to the state court, is not an objective factor external to the defense\r\nsufficient to establish cause to excuse procedural default.\r\n\r\n       Finally, Hodges has not presented any evidence that review of this claim is necessary in order to\r\nprevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See id. at 495–96. This exception has been applied only when\r\na habeas petitioner has demonstrated that he is actually innocent. See Carter v. Mitchell, 443 F.3d 517, 538\r\n(6th Cir. 2006) (citing Carrier, 477 U.S. at 496). Hodges has not presented new evidence of his innocence\r\nnor has he even argued that he is actually innocent.\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, Hodges is unable to establish the cause necessary to excuse his procedural default of\r\nthis claim. It was therefore appropriate for the district court to deny both an evidentiary hearing and habeas\r\nrelief on this claim because the claim is barred.\r\n\f  No. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 15\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Plea Phase\r\n\r\n       Hodges argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by advising him to plead guilty; that\r\nbecause of their deficient performance, his guilty plea was neither knowing, voluntary, nor intelligent; and\r\nthat he was prejudiced by his counsel’s performance. Hodges claims that his lawyers mistakenly believed\r\nthat his pleading guilty would prohibit the state from introducing any evidence relating to the facts of the\r\nmurder; that his lawyers forgot that if he pled guilty to the aggravated robbery charge, Hodges would\r\nimmediately become death eligible; and that he would not have pled guilty if his lawyers had given him\r\naccurate information.\r\n\r\n       Hodges failed to appeal the plea-invalidity claim to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, and\r\nreferred to it only in the final page of his brief without citing to the record or any legal authority. The\r\nTennessee Court of Criminal Appeals considered the issue waived and declined to address it, relying on\r\nTenn. Crim. App. R. 10(b) and Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7). See Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at *32. To the\r\nextent that it is a separate claim, the plea-invalidity claim is procedurally defaulted. See Middlebrooks v.\r\nBell, 619 F.3d 526, 535–36 (6th Cir. 2010). Hodges cannot rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction\r\ncounsel to excuse the default; neither has he presented any evidence to justify review of his claim in order\r\nto prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96. Accordingly, the plea-\r\ninvalidity claim is barred, and this court will review only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\r\n\r\n       Hodges raised the ineffective assistance claim in his state post-conviction petition. The trial court\r\nheld an evidentiary hearing and took testimony from Hodges’s trial counsel. Hodges v. Tennessee, No.\r\nM1999-00516-CCA-R3-PD, 2000 WL 1562865, at *18 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 20, 2000). The Court of\r\nCriminal Appeals summarized the evidence presented as follows:\r\n\r\n       At the post-conviction hearing, Dawson [defense counsel at trial] testified that the decision\r\n       to enter a guilty plea was made the weekend prior to trial when it was determined that “there\r\n       was no way we were going to convince anybody that Mr. Hodges didn't kill the victim in this\r\n       matter.” He explained that, at that time, the defense team believed that by entering a plea\r\n       during the guilt phase of the trial, they would gain credibility with the jury for the sentencing\r\n       phase. The defense team also hoped to surprise the State by entering the plea. In essence,\r\n       the defense team intended to disrupt the bifurcated nature of the trial, thereby precluding the\r\n       State from introducing evidence during the penalty phase which the State had planned to\r\n       introduce at the guilt phase. Notwithstanding this reasoning, Dawson admitted that,\r\n\f  No. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 16\r\n\r\n\r\n       although the proof was overwhelming, in hindsight, they should have proceeded to trial so\r\n       that they could have begun introduction of their mitigation theories. Michael Terry [defense\r\n       counsel at trial] corroborated Dawson's testimony regarding the appellant's guilty plea. He\r\n       explained that the plea was supposed to be “a demonstration of remorse for the jury.”\r\n       However, he agrees that the decision was a mistake and that they should have at a least\r\n       “pitched a fight.” [Hodges] did not testify at the post-conviction hearing.\r\n\r\nId. The trial court held that counsel made an informed tactical decision to advise Hodges to plead guilty.\r\nId.\r\n\r\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed that decision. It cited Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S.\r\n52 (1985), for the proposition that the two-prong standard from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668\r\n(1984), applies to ineffective assistance of counsel claims arising out of guilty plea proceedings. Hodges,\r\n2000 WL 1562865, at *19–20. The court concluded that the advice to plead guilty was not “outside the\r\nrange of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.” Id. at *20. The court noted the\r\noverwhelming evidence of guilt, the reasonable hope of obtaining leniency, the reasonable belief that the\r\njury would view the guilty plea as an expression of remorse, and the elimination of the presentation to the\r\njury of all of the evidence available of Hodges’s guilt. Id. at *19.\r\n\r\n       The district court held that the state court’s conclusion that Hodges’s counsel made a strategic\r\ndecision to advise him to plead guilty was not unreasonable. The court noted that Hodges’s counsel had\r\ndone substantial work on the case before advising him to plead guilty; that counsel were experienced, aware\r\nof the state’s proof and the elements of the offenses charged; had the aid of three experts; and were impaired\r\nby Hodges’s public statements admitting to several murders. The district court also found that Hodges did\r\nnot establish prejudice because Hodges did not testify at his post-conviction hearing and thus did not say\r\nthat he would not have pled guilty but for the advice of counsel.\r\n\r\n       After a careful review of the record, we agree with the district court. The state court’s determination\r\nthat defense counsel’s performance was not deficient was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\r\n\f No. 09-5021                   Hodges v. Colson                                                               Page 17\r\n\r\n\r\nfederal law. Moreover, even if we were to find deficient performance, Hodges has failed to show that he\r\nwas prejudiced by the performance.4\r\n\r\n       To establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Hodges must show that (1) his counsel’s\r\nperformance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Strickland, 466 U.S.\r\nat 687–88. An attorney’s performance is deficient if it is objectively unreasonable under prevailing\r\nprofessional norms. Id. at 688. “[A] court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls\r\nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the\r\npresumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.”\r\nId. at 689. The test for prejudice is whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\r\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. Id. at 694. To show\r\nprejudice in the guilty-plea context, a defendant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\r\nfor counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.”\r\nHill, 474 U.S. at 59. “[W]here the alleged error of counsel is a failure to advise the defendant of a potential\r\naffirmative defense to the crime charged, the resolution of the ‘prejudice’ inquiry will depend largely on\r\nwhether the affirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.” Id.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court has recently noted that “[e]stablishing that a state court’s application of\r\nStrickland was unreasonable under § 2254(d) is all the more difficult.” Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct.\r\n770, 788 (2011). “The standards created by Strickland and § 2254(d) are both highly deferential, and when\r\nthe two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\r\nTherefore, “[w]hen § 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel’s actions were reasonable. The\r\nquestion is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential\r\nstandard.” Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 4\r\n                   We note that two recent Supreme Court cases—Lafler v. Cooper, 132 S. Ct. 1376 (2012), and\r\n         Missouri v. Frye, 132 S. Ct. 1399 (2012)—recognizing a Sixth Amendment right to effective\r\n         representation during plea-deal negotiations are not implicated here. The record does not reflect that\r\n         Hodges was offered any plea deal, so the existing legal standard under Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52\r\n         (1985), and its progeny remains the law.\r\n\f No. 09-5021                  Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 18\r\n\r\n\r\n       A.       Performance\r\n\r\n       Using the “doubly” deferential standards of § 2254(d) and Strickland, we conclude that the state\r\ncourt’s determination that defense counsel’s performance was not deficient was neither contrary to nor an\r\nunreasonable application of federal law. Trial counsel advised Hodges to plead guilty because of the\r\noverwhelming evidence of his guilt, to give the defense credibility, to limit the proof the prosecution could\r\npresent, and to show Hodges’s remorse.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court has explicitly approved using the American Bar Association (“ABA”)\r\nGuidelines on attorney performance in effect at the time of a defendant’s trial as “guides to determining\r\nwhat is reasonable” performance by counsel. See, e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, 130 S. Ct. 1473, 1482 (2010).\r\nHowever, “ABA Guidelines are not ‘inexorable commands’; rather, they are ‘only guides to what\r\nreasonableness means, not its definition.’” Post v. Bradshaw, 621 F.3d 406, 418 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting\r\nBobby v. Van Hook, 130 S. Ct. 13, 17 (2009)) (some internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n       The ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of Hodges’s trial contemplated negotiated guilty pleas only\r\nwhere the defendant is assured of a sentence less than death. ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and\r\nPerformance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (“ABA Guidelines”), § 11.6.1 (1989). “If no written\r\nguarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be\r\nextremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client’s trial rights.” Id. § 11.6.3 cmt.\r\n\r\n       Courts also find that a defendant has little to gain from pleading guilty in a capital case, even when\r\nthe evidence of guilt is overwhelming. “[P]leading guilty [in a capital case] without a guarantee that the\r\nprosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.” Florida v. Nixon,\r\n543 U.S. 175, 191 n.6 (2004) (citing ABA Guidelines § 10.9.2 cmt. (rev.ed. 2003)). The Nixon Court noted\r\nthat pleading guilty “increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during\r\nthe sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors’ minds as they\r\ndeliberate on the sentence.” Id. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that “counsel cannot be deemed\r\nineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless\r\ncharade.” Id. at 192 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 19\r\n\r\n\r\n       This court has also recently decided a similar, but distinguishable, case. In Post, 621 F.3d at 415–18,\r\na pre-Richter case, we addressed whether trial counsel’s advice to enter a no-contest plea and to submit the\r\npenalty phase to a three-judge panel rather than a jury was objectively reasonable under Strickland. Using\r\nde novo review, we concluded that the defendant’s weak mitigation case made the decision reasonable,\r\nnoting that “[the defendant’s] counsel were between a rock and a hard place in determining the best way\r\nto spare him a death sentence, given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, his numerous confessions, and\r\nhis refusal to plead guilty.” Id. at 418. We held that although the no-contest plea resulted in the defendant’s\r\nbeing “sentenced by judges, not jurors, and by three persons rather than twelve,” the strategy was\r\nprofessionally reasonable because the sentencing judges could have viewed the no-contest plea as a\r\nmitigating factor (although ultimately they did not). Id. at 417.\r\n\r\n       Trial counsel’s advice to plead guilty here was questionable. Defense counsel hoped that Hodges’s\r\npleading guilty would accomplish the following: (1) gain credibility with the jury, (2) demonstrate\r\nHodges’s remorse, (3) limit the evidence presented to the jury, and (4) surprise the prosecution and thereby\r\nlimit the effectiveness of its penalty case. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals noted that although\r\nthe goals of counsel were reasonable, Hodges “ultimately gained nothing by pleading guilty.” Hodges, 2000\r\nWL 1562865, at *20. For example, despite counsel’s attempt to limit the evidence presented to the jury,\r\na vast majority of what they hoped to keep out was allowed in. Trina Brown testified that Hodges planned\r\nto rob and kill the next person who propositioned him, and that he discussed how to carry out the crimes.\r\nShe also told the jury that Hodges bound the victim’s hands and feet and that, after she and Hodges\r\nransacked the victim’s apartment, Hodges strangled the victim, who was begging for his life. Hodges, 944\r\nS.W.2d at 349. Police officers testified that the victim’s belongings were found in Hodges’s possession\r\nwhen he was arrested, that Hodges’s fingerprints were found in the victim’s home, and that Brown was\r\nphotographed using the victim’s ATM card. Id. at 350.\r\n\r\n       Defense counsel did successfully limit the prosecution’s cross-examination of Hodges; the State was\r\npermitted to ask questions only about his personal history, and not about the circumstances of the offense.\r\nId. at 350 n.6. However, the same result could have been achieved by putting on a reasonable doubt defense\r\nand having Hodges testify only during the sentencing hearing. This is also true of defense counsel’s goals\r\nof gaining credibility with the jury and showing remorse.\r\n\f No. 09-5021                  Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 20\r\n\r\n\r\n       Moreover, defense attorney Dawson testified in the state post-conviction proceeding that the defense\r\nteam “never sat down and did an analysis of what are the benefits of going to trial, what are the deficits and\r\nwhere did that lead us.” He also testified that when the defense team advised Hodges to plead guilty, he had\r\n“totally forgotten” about the third count of the indictment, aggravated robbery; a conviction on that count\r\nconstituted an aggravating factor for purposes of the penalty phase.\r\n\r\n       However, trial counsel also acknowledged that the evidence of Hodges’s guilt was overwhelming.\r\nAs counsel explained during the state post-conviction proceeding, despite their advice that he should not\r\nspeak with reporters, Hodges participated in a pre-trial television series in which he gave interviews\r\n“describing himself as a serial killer.” Attorney Dawson described the difficulties that arose from\r\nrepresenting such a client: “We had a client that was confessing to the public on eight murders. And he had\r\nwritten to the court; he had written to the prosecutor, a confession to the case that we had to try. It looked\r\npretty dismal.” Trial counsel summarized the evidence against Hodges: Hodges made inculpatory\r\nstatements to police, prosecutors, the trial court, and television reporters; his fingerprints were at the scene\r\nof the crime; he had items from the victim’s house with him when he was arrested; Trina Brown gave a\r\nstatement implicating him; there were photos of Brown using the victim’s bank card; and Brown’s\r\nfingerprints were on the victim’s card.\r\n\r\n       The defense team talked to Hodges about the decision to plead guilty and reviewed the guilty plea\r\nform with him.      Hodges thanked his attorneys for their work and never complained about their\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n       If it were our task to determine whether trial counsel’s performance was deficient because they\r\nadvised Hodges to plead guilty, the decision would be a more difficult one. The ABA Guidelines at the time\r\nof the plea contemplated guilty pleas in capital cases only in exchange for a guarantee from the prosecution\r\nnot to seek the death penalty.       Here, no such exchange was made, and Hodges gained little—if\r\nanything—from his plea.\r\n\r\n       However, the “ABA Guidelines are not inexorable commands,” Post, 621 F.3d at 418 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted), and our task is not to determine whether trial counsel’s performance was\r\ndeficient. Rather, we must determine “whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied\r\n\f  No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 21\r\n\r\n\r\nStrickland’s deferential standard.” Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788 (emphasis added). And here, as identified by\r\nthe Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, there is a reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s\r\ndeferential standard. Although not directly on point, the considerations in this case are similar to those\r\nfaced by this court in Post: “[C]ounsel were between a rock and a hard place in determining the best way\r\nto spare [the defendant] a death sentence, given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, [and] his numerous\r\nconfessions.” 621 F.3d at 418. And in Post, we found that counsel’s actions were reasonable under a de\r\nnovo standard of review, id., which is far less stringent than the “doubly” deferential standard that we must\r\napply here, see Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788. Although there is some evidence that counsel here failed to\r\nappreciate fully the impact of their decision, that is not material to the issue before us: whether there is “any\r\nreasonable argument” that counsel’s recommendation to plead guilty satisfies Strickland. As the Supreme\r\nCourt has stated, “[C]ounsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor\r\nand his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.” Nixon, 543 U.S. at 192.\r\n\r\n        Ultimately, the state court that addressed this issue concluded that, “[a]lthough defense counsel’s\r\nstrategy for avoiding the death penalty was thwarted, the decision to pursue that particular strategy cannot\r\nbe deemed incompetent.” Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at *20. Under the doubly deferential standard\r\nimposed by § 2254(d) and Strickland, we simply cannot say that conclusion is contrary to or involves an\r\nunreasonable application of federal law.\r\n\r\n        B.      Prejudice\r\n\r\n        Even if we did find that the state court’s decision on trial counsel’s performance was unreasonable,\r\nwe could not grant relief because Hodges has failed to establish prejudice. As noted above, to show\r\nprejudice in the guilty-plea context, a defendant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\r\nfor counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.”\r\nHill, 474 U.S. at 59.\r\n\r\n          Because the state courts found that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient, the state courts\r\n  did not address the prejudice prong of the Strickland inquiry. We have previously held that where a\r\n  state court addresses only the performance prong of the Strickland inquiry, this court will review the\r\n  prejudice prong de novo. See Morales v. Mitchell, 507 F.3d 916, 935 (6th Cir. 2007). Despite the\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                      Hodges v. Colson                                                                    Page 22\r\n\r\n\r\nSupreme Court’s holding in Richter to the contrary, the Sixth Circuit has continued to review the\r\nprejudice prong de novo where, as here, the state court reviewed only the performance prong. See\r\nRayner v. Mills, 685 F.3d 631, 636-639 (6th Cir. 2012).5 Thus, we apply de novo review to the\r\nprejudice prong here.\r\n\r\n       In Hill, 474 U.S. at 59, the Supreme Court held that in the context of a challenge to a guilty plea,\r\nto establish prejudice a defendant need only show that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for the\r\ncounsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.” The Court\r\nwent on to give two examples. First, it noted that where the alleged error involves failure to investigate\r\nor discover exculpatory information, “the determination of whether the error ‘prejudiced’ the defendant\r\n. . . will depend in large part on a prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the\r\noutcome of a trial.” Id. Second, it noted that where the alleged error involves a failure to advise the\r\ndefendant of possible affirmative defenses, “the resolution of the ‘prejudice’ inquiry will depend largely\r\non whether the affirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.” Id. It is therefore clear that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 5\r\n                     In Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 784, the Supreme Court stated,\r\n                 Where a state court’s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas\r\n                 petitioner’s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the\r\n                 state court to deny relief. This is so whether or not the state court reveals which of the\r\n                 elements in a multipart claim it found insufficient, for § 2254(d) applies when a\r\n                 “claim,” not a component of one, has been adjudicated.\r\n        (emphasis added). Rayner places undue emphasis on the “unaccompanied by an explanation” language\r\n        of the first sentence’s opening clause, but disregards entirely the second sentence, which requires that the\r\n        habeas petitioner’s burden of showing that there was no reasonable basis for the state court’s denial of\r\n        relief applies “whether or not the state court reveals which of the elements of a multipart claim it found\r\n        insufficient. . . .” As the Court went on to say, “[w]hen a federal claim has been presented to a state court\r\n        and the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the\r\n        merits in the absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.” Richter at\r\n        784–85. Whether the decision is accompanied by an explanation or not accompanied by an explanation,\r\n        whether any provided explanation states which elements it found insufficient or not, the statute provides\r\n        an unequivocal rule: “§ 2254(d) applies when a ‘claim,’ not a component of one, has been adjudicated.”\r\n                  Rayner also leaves this court with the following peculiar rule: if the state court fails to given an\r\n        explanation as to either prong, then full AEDPA deference is due to both prongs; but if the state court\r\n        gives an explanation of one prong, then we do not give deference to the other. In other words, the more\r\n        information the state court provides, the less deference we grant it. This is contrary not only to the\r\n        language of the statute, which speaks of “claims” not components of claims, but also contrary to the spirit\r\n        of § 2254(d), which is designed to give more deference to a state court judgment on the merits.\r\n                  Moreover, as a matter of logic, a finding that counsel’s performance was not deficient implicitly,\r\n        but unequivocally, encompasses a finding that the performance did not prejudice the defendant. Indeed,\r\n        it would be nonsensical to argue that a performance deemed to be constitutionally sufficient nevertheless\r\n        prejudiced the defendant. It must be assumed that a state court’s decision that performance was not\r\n        deficient includes a decision that the performance was not prejudicial.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                   Hodges v. Colson                                                                    Page 23\r\n\r\n\r\nin determining whether a defendant has shown prejudice, a court must predict whether correction of the\r\ndeficient performance might have enabled the defendant to succeed at trial. “[T]hese predictions of the\r\noutcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be made objectively, without regard for the\r\nidiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.” Id. at 59–60.\r\n\r\n       This court has previously noted that “testimony, though self-serving, may be enough by itself\r\nto satisfy the prejudice prong.” Miller v. Straub, 299 F.3d 570, 581 (6th Cir. 2002). In Miller, the\r\ndefendants testified at a hearing that they entered their guilty pleas with hesitation and would not have\r\npled guilty but for counsel’s advice. Id. The court also noted that one of the defendants presented, in\r\nthe form of testimony from his trial counsel, “additional evidence that, with competent assistance, he\r\nwould have pled not guilty.” Id. at 582. Trial counsel testified that the defendant “pled guilty only\r\nreluctantly,” and the court concluded that “the fact that [trial counsel] had to prevail upon [the\r\ndefendant] to plead guilty tends to corroborate [the defendant’s] testimony that he would have pled not\r\nguilty.” Id. The court concluded that the defendants’ “testimony, along with reasonable inferences from\r\nthe facts and circumstances of this case,” established prejudice under Hill. Id. at 583.\r\n\r\n       In Hodges’s case, we cannot conclude that Hodges has established a reasonable probability that,\r\nbut for counsel’s advice, he would not have pled guilty. In fact, the only evidence concerning this issue\r\nappears in Hodges’s Verified Amended Petition for Post Conviction Relief filed on March 24, 1998.\r\nThere, notably, Hodges did not say that had he had better advice he would not have pled guilty. Rather,\r\nhis statement was:\r\n\r\n       Had trial counsel performed the above investigations and informed Petitioner of the\r\n       result of those investigations, and had counsel timely communicated with Petitioner and\r\n       given him the above advice, a reasonable probability exists that Petitioner would not\r\n       have pleaded guilty to all counts in the indictment, but, rather, would have insisted on\r\n       going to trial.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the document, Hodges’s signature appears, verifying that the “foregoing allegations of fact\r\nare true and correct to the best of [his] information and belief.”6\r\n\r\n\r\n                6\r\n                We note that the verification oath and signature is required of all post-conviction petitions filed\r\n       in Tennessee. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-204(e) (1997).\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 24\r\n\r\n\r\n        In contrast to the defendants in Miller, Hodges has never personally testified about his decision\r\nto plead guilty and whether he would have pled not guilty but for the advice of counsel. Moreover,\r\nunlike in Miller, where “reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances” of the case suggested\r\nthat the defendants would not have pled guilty but for advice of counsel, no such inferences exist here.\r\nTo the contrary, any inferences that can be made make it clear that Hodges would have pled guilty\r\nregardless of what his counsel recommended. Leading up to trial, Hodges embraced his guilt. For\r\ninstance, against the advice of counsel, he participated in a pre-trial television series in which he gave\r\ninterviews “describing himself as a serial killer.” Hodges also implicated himself in letters to the court\r\nand prosecutor. Those simply are not the actions of a defendant hoping to avoid a guilty plea, nor do\r\nthey help establish a reasonable probability that Hodges would have pled not guilty if so advised by\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n        Furthermore, Hill instructs us to examine how competent counsel might have influenced the\r\noutcome of a hypothetical trial, see 474 U.S. at 59–60, and there is virtually no chance that Hodges\r\ncould have avoided convictions by proceeding to trial. As has been discussed repeatedly, the evidence\r\nagainst Hodges was overwhelming, and he only made the situation worse by corresponding with\r\nreporters, the court, and the prosecutor against the advice of his counsel. Similarly, we have no evidence\r\nor reason to believe that the penalty phase of trial would have proceeded differently had there first been\r\na full guilt phase.\r\n\r\n        A self-serving statement, couched in exactly the terms of the Supreme Court’s standard, and filed\r\nas a required part of Hodges’s verified petition for post-conviction relief, cannot establish a reasonable\r\nprobability that Hodges would have pled not guilty but for the advice of counsel, where all objective\r\nevidence points unequivocally to the contrary. Hodges is not entitled to relief on his claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel at the plea phase.\r\n\r\nIV.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Sentencing Phase & Incompetency at Trial\r\n\r\n        Hodges argues that the district court erred when it denied him an evidentiary hearing on his\r\nclaims that he was incompetent at trial and that his trial counsel were ineffective at sentencing. He also\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 25\r\n\r\n\r\nargues that the district court erred when it denied his competency and ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nclaims on the merits.\r\n\r\n        Hodges failed to present his claim of incompetency at trial to the state courts, and he no longer\r\nhas any state court remedies to exhaust. See Fletcher v. Tennessee, 951 S.W.2d 378, 380–81 (Tenn.\r\n1997) (citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-217(a) (1996 Supp.)). The claim is therefore procedurally\r\ndefaulted.\r\n\r\n        Hodges argues that substantive competency claims cannot be procedurally defaulted, citing cases\r\nfrom the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits. See Battle v. United States, 419 F.3d 1292, 1298 (11th Cir.\r\n2005); Walker v. Gibson, 228 F.3d 1217, 1229 (10th Cir. 2000); Adams v. Wainwright, 764 F.2d 1356,\r\n1359 (11th Cir. 1985). However, neither the Supreme Court nor this court has adopted such a rule, and\r\nwe decline to do so here. As the Ninth Circuit noted in LaFlamme v. Hubbard, No. 97-16973, 2000 WL\r\n757525, at *2 (9th Cir. Mar. 16, 2000), those courts that have held that substantive competency claims\r\ncannot be procedurally defaulted appear to have conflated the distinct concepts of waiver and procedural\r\ndefault. Although it is true that substantive competency claims cannot be waived, Pate v. Robinson, 383\r\nU.S. 375, 384 (1966) (“it is contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet\r\nknowingly or intelligently ‘waive’ his right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial”), they\r\ncan be procedurally defaulted. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that, “unlike waiver, the procedural\r\ndefault rule does not rely on the petitioner’s voluntary abandonment of a known right, but only on the\r\nfact that the claim was rejected by the state court on independent and adequate state grounds.”\r\nLaFlamme, 2000 WL 757525, at *2 (internal quotation marks and formatting omitted). We hereby hold\r\nthat substantive competency claims are subject to the same rules of procedural default as all other claims\r\nthat may be presented on habeas.\r\n\r\n        Hodges also cannot rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to excuse the\r\ndefault. Hodges did not default an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim; he defaulted his claim\r\nthat he was not competent to stand trial. Accordingly, Martinez v. Ryan, 132 S. Ct. 1309 (2012) and\r\nTrevino v. Thaler, 133 S. Ct. 1911 (2013) are inapplicable and the Coleman rule still applies. Because\r\nHodges has not presented any evidence to justify review of his claim in order to prevent a fundamental\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 26\r\n\r\n\r\nmiscarriage of justice, see Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96, the substantive competency claim is barred, and\r\nwe will review the ineffective assistance claim only to the extent that it concerns failure to investigate\r\nand present additional mitigating evidence.\r\n\r\n       In his state post-conviction petition, Hodges claimed that trial counsel were ineffective for failing\r\nto investigate and present additional mitigating evidence. According to Hodges, his counsel should have\r\nobtained prison records that showed he told a doctor that he was raped as a boy and should have\r\ninterviewed additional people who were familiar with his background. Hodges also asserted that trial\r\ncounsel failed to investigate evidence concerning the causes, effects, and treatment of substance abuse;\r\nfailed to adequately prepare him for his testimony; and failed to make effective use of experts. Hodges\r\nrequested, and the trial court granted, $15,000 for mitigation investigation; but the trial court denied\r\nHodges’s request for additional funds to hire a drug and alcohol specialist, a mitigation specialist, and\r\na fingerprint expert. At the evidentiary hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Hodges’s trial\r\ncounsel, a clinical sociologist who helped prepare Hodges’s mitigation case, the Tennessee District\r\nPublic Defender’s Conference chief counsel, and a mitigation specialist retained for the post-conviction\r\nproceeding. Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at *4–*12. The trial court denied Hodges’s petition.\r\n\r\n       The appellate court affirmed, finding that Hodges had not presented any evidence in post-\r\nconviction proceedings that was substantially different from the proof introduced at the penalty phase.\r\nId. at *27. The court found that the experts presented at the penalty phase, with one exception, were in\r\npossession of the same records about Hodges used by the post-conviction mitigation specialist, and that\r\nadditional evidence from further mitigation investigation would have been cumulative to the evidence\r\nobtained by trial counsel before sentencing. Id. It stated, “[g]iven the records presently before this\r\ncourt, we conclude that trial counsel adequately investigated the appellant’s background and presented\r\na case in mitigation that was supported by the information introduced.” Id. The appellate court also\r\nheld that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Hodges the additional funds he requested\r\nbecause his post-conviction counsel were capable of presenting the available mitigation information\r\nwithout expert assistance. Id. at *29.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 27\r\n\r\n\r\n       A.      Evidentiary Hearing\r\n\r\n       “This court reviews a district court’s decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing for an\r\nabuse of discretion.” Vroman v. Brigano, 346 F.3d 598, 606 (6th Cir. 2003).\r\n\r\n       Generally, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2) governs whether a district court should hold an evidentiary\r\nhearing in a habeas proceeding. Section 2254(e)(2) states that, with a few exceptions, “[i]f the applicant\r\nhas failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an\r\nevidentiary hearing on the claim.” Hodges does not argue that one of the exceptions applies; instead,\r\nhe argues that he did not fail to develop the factual basis of his claim and is therefore entitled to an\r\nevidentiary hearing.\r\n\r\n       We need not decide whether Hodges developed the factual basis of his claim in state court\r\nbecause the Supreme Court’s decision in Cullen v. Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. 1388 (2011), prohibits us from\r\nconsidering new evidence in this case. The Court held that “review under § 2254(d)(1) is limited to the\r\nrecord that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.” Id. at 1398. It reasoned\r\nthat the language of the statute is “backward-looking” and “requires an examination of the state-court\r\ndecision at the time it was made. It follows that the record under review is limited to the record in\r\nexistence at that same time i.e., the record before the state court.” Id. The Court also noted that its\r\nholding did not “render[] § 2254(e)(2) superfluous” because it “continues to have force where\r\n§ 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief.” Id. at 1400–01.\r\n\r\n       Hodges’s ineffective assistance claim was brought under § 2254(d)(1), and it was adjudicated\r\non the merits by the state courts. Pinholster therefore applies. It was a reasonable exercise of the\r\ndistrict court’s discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing on the claim, because any evidence introduced\r\nwould be “irrelevant” and “have no bearing on § 2254(d)(1) review” in any event. See id. at 1400.\r\n\r\n       B.      Ineffective Assistance\r\n\r\n       To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, Hodges must show\r\nboth that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the\r\ndefense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. With respect to performance, “counsel should be strongly\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 28\r\n\r\n\r\npresumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of\r\nreasonable professional judgment.” Pinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1403. An attorney’s failure to reasonably\r\ninvestigate the defendant’s background and present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can\r\nconstitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 521–22 (2003). However,\r\n“Strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no\r\nmatter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.” Id. at 533. The court\r\nmust consider not only the evidence known to counsel, but also whether that evidence “would lead a\r\nreasonable attorney to investigate further.” Id. at 527. “[I]f a habeas claim does not involve a failure\r\nto investigate but, rather, petitioner’s dissatisfaction with the degree of his attorney’s investigation, the\r\npresumption of reasonableness imposed by Strickland will be hard to overcome.” Campbell v. Coyle,\r\n260 F.3d 531, 552 (6th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]here is no prejudice when\r\nthe new mitigating evidence ‘would barely have altered the sentencing profile presented’ to the\r\ndecisionmaker.” Sears v. Upton, 130 S. Ct. 3259, 3266 (2010) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 700).\r\n\r\n        “Establishing that a state court’s application of Strickland was unreasonable under § 2254(d) is\r\nall the more difficult.” Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788. “The standards created by Strickland and § 2254(d)\r\nare both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.” Id. (internal\r\nquotation marks and citations omitted). Therefore, “[w]hen § 2254(d) applies, the question is not\r\nwhether counsel’s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument\r\nthat counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.” Id.\r\n\r\n        The state court record supports the conclusion that Hodges’s trial counsel reasonably\r\ninvestigated Hodges’s background and presented mitigating evidence. The Tennessee Supreme Court\r\nsummarized the mitigation evidence presented at sentencing as follows:\r\n\r\n        In mitigation, the defendant testified and also presented the testimony of his mother, his\r\n        brothers and Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a child psychiatrist. This proof showed that the\r\n        defendant was the next to youngest of his mother’s five sons. His mother and father\r\n        were not married. His father was actually married to another woman, but engaged in\r\n        what one of the witnesses described as an “irregular union” with the defendant’s mother\r\n        for eighteen years. The defendant’s father abused the defendant’s mother and was strict\r\n        with the defendant’s brothers, three of whom were the children of another man. The\r\n        defendant, however, was his father’s favorite and was spoiled. Financial difficulties\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 29\r\n\r\n\r\n       forced the family to move about frequently, and defendant’s father supported the family\r\n       only sporadically.\r\n       The defense introduced proof to show that Hodges seemed normal until he was twelve\r\n       years old. At that time, he began to associate with older boys, sniff glue and gasoline,\r\n       be truant from school, and run away from home. He also engaged in sexual activities\r\n       with his younger brother and attempted sexual activities with a female cousin. He\r\n       became involved with the juvenile authorities and was confined to a juvenile facility in\r\n       Chattanooga.\r\n       Through his mitigation proof, the defendant attempted to establish that a catalyst and\r\n       major contributing cause of his delinquent and later criminal behavior was his rape and\r\n       sexual abuse by a stranger when he was twelve years old. According to the defendant,\r\n       he accepted a stranger’s offer of a ride home when he was playing a short distance from\r\n       his home on Fessler’s Lane in Nashville. Rather than driving Hodges home, the stranger\r\n       drove Hodges to his home and raped him. Fearing rejection by his homophobic father\r\n       and driven by guilt, the defendant told no one of this incident until he was arrested in\r\n       1990.\r\n       Dr. Nurcombe testified that, while the defendant suffered from an antisocial personality\r\n       disorder, low self-esteem, and substance (marijuana) abuse, the killing was motivated\r\n       by a subconscious desire for revenge for the sexual abuse inflicted on him when he was\r\n       twelve, coupled with Hodges’ fear that his family might discover that he was engaged\r\n       in homosexual prostitution since Brown had told Hodge’s [sic] sister-in-law shortly\r\n       before the killing that he was a homosexual prostitute. The defense also introduced\r\n       testimony that Brown dominated and manipulated the defendant.\r\n       In rebuttal the State called Dr. James Kyser, a forensic psychiatrist, and Dr. Leonard\r\n       Morgan, a clinical psychologist. Both had examined the defendant and concluded that\r\n       he suffered from an antisocial personality disorder. They described persons with this\r\n       disorder as having “no conscience,” being “self centered,” being “notoriously dishonest\r\n       and untruthful,” and having “very little regard for the feelings of others and . . . willing\r\n       to use any means to get what they want, no matter who it hurts.” While acknowledging\r\n       the complicated factors involved in antisocial personality disorders, the State’s experts\r\n       discounted the singular importance of the one incident of alleged sexual abuse in causing\r\n       the defendant’s actions. Dr. Morgan concluded that the defendant “was in complete\r\n       control of his behavior” and not suffering from mental illness or emotional disturbance.\r\n\r\nHodges, 944 S.W.2d at 350–51. Because Hodges alleges that his trial counsel’s mitigation case\r\noverlooked significant aspects of his background, the mitigation testimony merits more detailed\r\nattention.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 30\r\n\r\n\r\n       Dr. Nurcombe, head of child psychiatry at Vanderbilt Medical School, testified that he\r\nspecialized in juvenile delinquency and the effects of sexual abuse, and that he had examined at least\r\n500 children. To assess Hodges, Dr. Nurcombe reviewed his school records, legal records, mental\r\nhealth records, and the results of an investigation by a private investigation group concerning his family\r\nbackground. He also interviewed Hodges for a total of nine hours on three occasions, and had a one-\r\nhour phone interview with him. The mental health records available to Dr. Nurcombe included five\r\npsychological tests from the age of twelve to late adolescence. He found no evidence that Hodges was\r\ninsane, but he did say that Hodges was not mentally healthy. He also said that Hodges suffered from\r\nan antisocial personality disorder, low self-esteem, and substance abuse.\r\n\r\n       In addition to Dr. Nurcombe, Hodges’s counsel presented six other witnesses at sentencing:\r\nHodges’s mother, three of his brothers, a neighbor, and Hodges himself. The testimony generally\r\nshowed that Hodges had a difficult childhood in a low-income, dysfunctional family and that his\r\nbehavior significantly worsened at the age of twelve, around the time he claims to have been raped.\r\nHowever, Hodges himself admitted that his parents treated him well, and that his mother took him for\r\nmental health treatment many times.\r\n\r\n       At the state post-conviction proceeding, Hodges presented additional testimony. He presented\r\nthe testimony of his trial counsel, each of whom explained that they did not sufficiently prepare for the\r\nsentencing phase of trial. He also presented the evidence of Dr. Ann Charvet, a clinical sociologist, who\r\nexplained that she did not think the mitigation information she had compiled was used properly by the\r\ndefense team, but was unable to suggest any specific information that Dr. Nurcombe or other witnesses\r\nfailed to present to the jury. He presented the testimony of David Keefe, chief counsel of the Tennessee\r\nDistrict Public Defender’s Conference, who had reviewed Hodges’s counsel’s representation and\r\nconcluded that it was deficient. Hodges, 2000 WL 1562865, at *10. And he presented the evidence of\r\nmitigation specialist Julie Hackenmiller, who holds a masters degree in forensic psychology. She\r\ndiscussed mitigation themes that were not developed at trial.\r\n\r\n       Although the evidence presented at the post-conviction proceeding shows that trial counsel’s\r\nperformance was not perfect, in light of the substantial and competent evidence produced at the penalty\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 31\r\n\r\n\r\nphase of Hodges’s trial, Hodges has not shown that the Tennessee state court’s decision that trial\r\ncounsel’s performance was not deficient was unreasonable. The burden of proof is on Hodges,\r\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1398, and under the “doubly deferential” standards imposed by § 2254(d) and\r\nStrickland, id. at 1403, Hodges has not carried that burden. Here, Hodges’s counsel retained a\r\nmitigation specialist and several experts. Defense counsel obtained most of Hodges’s available school,\r\nmedical, and juvenile records. Dr. Nurcombe used those records and his interviews with Hodges to\r\ndiagnose him, testify at length about his background, and link his homosexual rape at age twelve and\r\nhis exposure as a homosexual prostitute to his crime. The testimony of Hodges’s family members was\r\nconsistent with Dr. Nurcombe’s testimony and conclusions. And in post-conviction proceedings,\r\nHodges identified little information not considered by Dr. Nurcombe.\r\n\r\n        The circumstances of this case are similar to those considered by the Supreme Court in Bobby\r\nv. Van Hook, 130 S. Ct. 13 (2009). There, the petitioner claimed that his counsel were ineffective\r\nbecause their mitigation investigation was insufficient. Id. at 18. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding\r\nthat although the petitioner was tried less than three months after his indictment, trial counsel spoke with\r\nhis parents, an aunt, and a family friend; consulted with two expert witnesses; contacted the Veterans\r\nAdministration and sought medical records; and enlisted a mitigation specialist. Id. Trial counsel also\r\npresented evidence that the petitioner began drinking and using drugs as a child, witnessed his father\r\nabuse his mother, had violent fantasies, attempted suicide five times, suffered from borderline\r\npersonality disorder, consumed drugs and alcohol on the day of the crime, and may have been motivated\r\nby a “homosexual panic.” Id. at 18–19. The Supreme Court rejected the petitioner’s argument that his\r\ncounsel could have found more mitigating evidence by interviewing other members of his extended\r\nfamily and a psychiatrist who once treated his mother:\r\n\r\n        [T]here comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can reasonably be\r\n        expected to be only cumulative, and search for it distractive from more important\r\n        duties. . . . [I]t was not unreasonable for [the petitioner’s] counsel not to identify and\r\n        interview every other living family member or every therapist who once treated his\r\n        parents.\r\n\r\nId. at 19.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                          Page 32\r\n\r\n\r\n       Here, given the mitigation evidence Hodges’s counsel gathered from his family and Dr.\r\nNurcombe’s review of his background, it was reasonable for counsel not to identify and interview more\r\ndistant family members or review their mental health. And to the extent that Hodges argues that counsel\r\nwere ineffective for relying on Dr. Nurcombe, see Pet.’s Br. at 15 (describing Nurcombe as “a Court TV\r\npundant [sic]”), 112 (Nurcombe “fail[ed] to conduct the sort of thorough personal history that is\r\nnecessary to come to an accurate diagnosis”), his argument fails because Hodges has not shown that trial\r\ncounsel had good reason to believe Dr. Nurcombe was incompetent, or, for that matter, that he was\r\nincompetent.7 See Fautenberry v. Mitchell, 515 F.3d 614, 625 (6th Cir. 2008) (“[The petitioner] has not\r\nshown that counsel had good reason to believe that [the expert] was incompetent, and we conclude that\r\nit was objectively reasonable for counsel to rely upon the doctor’s opinions and conclusions.” (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted)); Lundgren v. Mitchell, 440 F.3d 754, 772 (6th Cir. 2006) (counsel’s reliance\r\non mental health experts was reasonable because petitioner presented no evidence that they were not\r\ncompetent); Clark v. Mitchell, 425 F.3d 270, 286 (6th Cir. 2005) (counsel reasonably relied on the\r\nopinions of a psychologist and psychiatrist in not seeking additional testing).\r\n\r\n       Where, as here, trial counsel puts on a reasonable mitigation case and presents nearly all of the\r\nsame information as presented by the petitioner’s post-conviction experts, we cannot find deficient\r\nperformance. And we certainly cannot find that the state court’s decision that trial counsels’\r\nperformance was not deficient was unreasonable. “As Strickland made clear, our role on habeas review\r\nis not to nitpick gratuitously counsel’s performance. After all, the constitutional right at issue here is\r\nultimately the right to a fair trial, not to perfect representation.” Smith v. Mitchell, 348 F.3d 177, 206\r\n(6th Cir. 2003) (citing Strickland, 466 U.S. at 684).\r\n\r\n       Because we find that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient, we need not address whether\r\nHodges was prejudiced by that performance. Hodges is not entitled to habeas relief on this claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               7\r\n                Indeed, we believe that the record shows that Dr. Nurcombe’s theory and testimony were\r\n       competent.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021             Hodges v.

Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984),\r\nI respectfully dissent from Part III of the majority opinion.\r\n\r\n       A. Performance\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court has explicitly approved using ABA Guidelines on attorney performance in\r\neffect at the time of a defendant’s trial as “guides to determining what is reasonable” performance by\r\ncounsel. Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.S. 356, 130 S. Ct. 1473, 1482 (2010); Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S.\r\n374, 387 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003); see also Bobby v. Van Hook, 558 U.S. 4,\r\n7 (2009) (per curiam). “ABA Guidelines are not ‘inexorable commands’; rather, they are ‘only guides\r\nto what reasonableness means, not its definition.’” Post v. Bradshaw, 621 F.3d 406, 418 (6th Cir. 2010)\r\n(quoting Bobby, 130 S. Ct. at 17) (some internal quotation marks omitted)). As discussed by the\r\nmajority, the 1989 ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty\r\nCases,1 which were in effect at the time of Hodges’s 1992 trial, disapprove entering a guilty plea in a\r\ncapital case without the prosecution’s agreement not to seek the death penalty in exchange for the guilty\r\nplea. The Guidelines state that “[i]t is suggested that [pleading a client guilty and then putting on a\r\ncontested penalty hearing] is an effective strategy only when the attorney knows without any doubt that\r\nno death sentence will result. Any other ‘strategy’ for entering a guilty plea is ill-advised and should\r\nbe abandoned.” ABA Guidelines § 11.6.2 cmt. n.2 ) (emphasis in original) (quoting Dept. of Public\r\nAdvocacy, KENTUCKY PUBLIC ADVOCATE DEATH PENALTY MANUAL, 328–33 (1983)).\r\nFurther, “[i]f no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of\r\nguilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client’s trial rights.” Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n                1\r\n                 ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in\r\n        D e a t h     P e n a l t y       C a s e s      ( 1 9 8 9 ) ,     a v a i l a b l e        a t :\r\n        http://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/migrated/DeathPenalty/RepresentationProject/PublicDoc\r\n        uments/1989Guidelines.authcheckdam.pdf\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 35\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11.6.3 cmt.; see also id. § 11.6.2 cmt. (“Counsel should insist that no plea to an offense for which the\r\ndeath penalty can be imposed will be considered without a written guarantee, binding on the court or\r\nother final sentencer, that death will not be imposed.”).\r\n\r\n       “[I]n a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in\r\ndetermining how best to proceed.” Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 192 (2004). Donald Dawson, one\r\nof Hodges’s trial attorneys, testified in the post-conviction proceeding in state trial court that the\r\ndecision to have Hodges plead guilty was made during the weekend prior to trial when the attorneys “sat\r\ndown and pretty much saw the guilt-innocence phase as hopeless.” J.A. at 1745. The attorneys were\r\n“trying to figure out what was the way to limit the jurors[’] bad feelings about us [a]nd [we] thought that\r\nby pleading guilty, we could give the defense some credibility.” Id. at 1746; see also id. (“[W]e\r\n[thought we] could get the jury to sort of be thankful to us that we didn’t make them sit through a guilt-\r\ninnocence phase and we wouldn’t lose our own credibility by arguing the guilt or innocence and we\r\nwould have a better chance to get a life verdict.”).\r\n\r\n       On its face, this appears to be the sort of strategic trial decision owed deference under Strickland.\r\nHowever, Dawson also testified that the defense team did “[n]ot adequately” think through the decision\r\nto plead guilty: “we never sat down and did an analysis of what are the benefits of going to trial, what\r\nare the deficits and where did that lead us.” Id. Dawson testified that at the time of trial, the defense\r\nteam had not read available literature setting out standards for adequate representation in capital cases.\r\nId. at 1747. In particular, the attorneys were unfamiliar with “the advantages of putting [on] a defense\r\n[in the guilt phase] consistent with your mitigation theory.” Id. They also failed to appreciate the\r\nadvantages of “hav[ing] the jury . . . have a chance to look at your client longer and find him guilty[,]\r\n[a]nd then decide [‘]now that we find him guilty, let’s see . . . [w]hat is the proper sentencing[’].” This\r\nwould allow the jury to not view the penalty phase as its only opportunity to pass judgment on the\r\ndefendant’s actions. Id. at 1748; see also id. at 1841–43 (post-conviction hearing testimony of Michael\r\nTerry). The attorneys conducted no legal research into proper considerations in deciding whether to\r\nplead guilty, and did not weigh the possible benefits of putting on a case at the guilt phase of trial. Id.\r\nat 1748–1751; see also id. at 1839 (testimony of Michael Terry).\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 36\r\n\r\n\r\n       Dawson also testified that nearly all of the evidence that he and the other attorneys hoped to keep\r\nout by pleading guilty came in anyway at the sentencing phase, as should have been clear from an\r\nanalysis of Tennessee law. Id. at 1752–53. Finally, Dawson stated that when he advised Hodges to\r\nplead guilty, the attorneys had “totally forgotten” about the third count of the indictment, aggravated\r\nrobbery, a conviction of which constituted an aggravating factor for purposes of the penalty phase. Id.\r\nat 1756–57. In fact, Dawson did not “recall having talked to Mr. Hodges at all about pleading to the\r\nrobbery.” Id. at 1757. Both Dawson and co-trial-counsel Michael Terry stated that pleading guilty was\r\na mistake. Id. at 1755, 1762–63, 1842. Terry stated that he “would not plead a capital defendant guilty\r\nagain in any case.” Id. at 1842.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, in the post-conviction hearing, the court heard testimony from David Keefe, chief\r\ncounsel for the capital division of the Tennessee District Public Defender’s Conference, who examined\r\nthe conduct of Hodges’s trial counsel at the request of Hodges’s post-conviction attorneys. Keefe\r\ntestified that he “believed the decision to plead guilty was wrong and hastily made. He opined that, by\r\npleading guilty, the defense team confused the jury and lost an array of appellate issues.” Hodges, 2000\r\nWL 1562865, at *10. Thus, although the decision to plead guilty was indeed a “strategic” decision\r\ndesigned to curry favor with the jury and limit the prosecution’s presentation of evidence, it was not\r\nintelligently made based on a weighing of the advantages and disadvantages of going to trial in the guilt\r\nphase, and was made without reference to secondary authorities providing standards for representation\r\nin death penalty cases. Further, the strategy was ill-designed to achieve one of its primary aims:\r\nlimiting presentation of damaging evidence about the crime. Therefore, advising Hodges to plead guilty\r\nwas inconsistent with the prevailing standard of competent representation in death penalty cases.\r\n\r\n       Post v. Bradshaw, 621 F.3d 406 (6th Cir. 2010), discussed by the majority, is distinguishable.\r\nIn Post, the defendant “refused to plead guilty, despite the State’s offer of a life sentence in return for\r\na guilty plea.” Id. at 417. The case addressed the question whether the decision to enter a no-contest\r\nplea and to submit the penalty phase to a three-judge panel rather than a jury was objectively reasonable.\r\nThe court concluded that the defendant’s weak mitigation evidence made the attorneys’ decision to\r\nforgo the right to a penalty-phase jury reasonable. Id. The Post court thus stated that “Post’s counsel\r\nwere between a rock and a hard place in determining the best way to spare him a death sentence, given\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 37\r\n\r\n\r\nthe overwhelming evidence of his guilt, his numerous confessions, and his refusal to plead guilty.” Id.\r\nat 418. Although these considerations are similar to those facing Hodges’s attorneys, the Post decision\r\ndoes not suggest that defense counsel failed to appreciate the import of their decision. Indeed, the\r\nopinion indicates that counsel weighed the pros and cons of pleading no contest and putting the case\r\nbefore a three-judge panel instead of a jury. Id. Further, part of the rationale advanced by the Post court\r\nin justifying counsel’s decision was that “[b]y pleading no contest, [Post] would ‘avoid[ ] the ordeal’\r\nof a guilt phase and have his sentence ‘determined without the sentencing court hearing all of the\r\nadverse testimony that would be produced at trial.’” Id. at 417 (quoting ABA Standards for Criminal\r\nJustice 4–6.1 cmt. (2d ed. 1980) (“The Defense Function”) (emphasis and third bracket added by Post)).\r\nAlthough Hodges’s defense team intended their decision to plead guilty to have the same effect, in\r\nreality nearly all of the testimony that would have been introduced at trial was introduced during the\r\npenalty phase. The miscalculation was not a matter of a sound decision turning out to be a mistake in\r\nhindsight. Rather, the decision had no legal support and was clearly a mistake in the first place.\r\nHodges’s attorneys hoped that pleading guilty would be a beneficial strategy, but had little sound\r\nreasoning behind this belief. See Post, 621 F.3d at 428 (Cole, J., dissenting) (“I believe that the\r\nConstitution requires attorneys to make strategic judgments based on something more concrete than\r\nunsubstantiated hope, especially when their client’s life hangs in the balance.”).\r\n\r\n       Nixon is also distinguishable. In Nixon, defense counsel was faced with overwhelming evidence\r\nof Nixon’s guilt. After a failed attempt to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for the prosecutor\r\ndropping the death penalty, defense counsel “concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt,\r\nthereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.” Nixon, 543 U.S. at 181.\r\nInstead of advising his client to enter a guilty plea, however, defense counsel decided to proceed to the\r\nguilt phase of trial, but to concede Nixon’s guilt to the jury. In opening statement, defense counsel\r\n“acknowledged Nixon’s guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.” Id. at 182. The\r\nprosecution introduced extensive evidence of Nixon’s guilt during the guilt phase. Defense counsel\r\n“cross-examined [the prosecution’s] witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification,\r\n. . . and he did not present a defense case.” Id. at 183. He also objected to some evidence as unduly\r\nprejudicial. “In his closing argument, [defense counsel] again conceded Nixon’s guilt, and reminded\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                  Hodges v. Colson                                                         Page 38\r\n\r\n\r\nthe jury of the importance of the penalty phase.” Id. (internal citation omitted). The jury found Nixon\r\nguilty, and the case proceeded to the penalty phase, at which defense counsel presented testimony of a\r\nnumber of witnesses. Id. at 183–84. Importantly, “[t]he State presented little evidence during the\r\npenalty phase, simply incorporating its guilt-phase evidence by reference.” Id. at 184.\r\n\r\n         The Nixon Court did not address the issue presented here. In fact, counsel in Nixon did exactly\r\nwhat Hodges’s counsel now concede they should have done. In approving of Nixon’s attorney’s\r\nstrategic decision, the Court discussed the downside to pleading guilty in lieu of going to trial at the guilt\r\nphase:\r\n\r\n         As [defense counsel] determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the\r\n         prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.\r\n         See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death\r\n         Penalty Cases § 10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913,\r\n         1045 (2003) (“If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed\r\n         following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a\r\n         waiver of the client’s trial rights.”). Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it\r\n         increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during\r\n         the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors’\r\n         minds as they deliberate on the sentence. See [Gary] Goodpaster, [The Trial for Life:\r\n         Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases], 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 299, 331[,]\r\n         558–59, 560–61 [(1983)].\r\n\r\n543 U.S. at 191 n.6 (citation altered). Had Hodges’s counsel acted as Nixon’s did by proceeding to trial\r\nand acknowledging guilt rather than pleading guilty, there would have been no constitutionally deficient\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n         Addressing Hodges’s Strickland claim, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals reasoned:\r\n\r\n         Although it is true that the appellant ultimately gained nothing by pleading guilty, the\r\n         record persuasively demonstrates that the appellant had little to gain by insisting upon\r\n         a trial. It is undisputed that the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming and\r\n         that his chances of acquittal were virtually non-existent. Indeed, in advising the\r\n         appellant, defense counsel was faced with two options: plead not guilty to the indictment\r\n         and face a full trial; or plead guilty to the indictment and face limited evidence in a\r\n         sentencing hearing with an opportunity to trade on his acceptance of his guilt and\r\n         remorse. Confronted with the overwhelming evidence of the appellant’s guilt, defense\r\n         counsel advised the appellant to plead guilty in the reasonable hope of obtaining leniency\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 39\r\n\r\n\r\n       during the sentencing phase. Defense counsel reasonably believed that the jury would\r\n       view the appellant’s guilty plea as an expression of remorse warranting a less severe\r\n       sentence than that imposed upon a defendant who protests his innocence in the face of\r\n       overwhelming evidence of guilt. Moreover, by pleading guilty, the appellant eliminated\r\n       the presentation to the jury of all of the evidence available to establish the appellant’s\r\n       guilt of the murder. The hard callous facts behind the offenses, in essence, were\r\n       desensitized by avoiding the guilt phase. The absence of an in-depth recitation of facts\r\n       enabled the appellant to seek some sympathy from the jury in the face of mitigating\r\n       evidence.\r\n\r\nHodges v. State, 2000 WL 1562865, at *20 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000). The court reasonably pointed to\r\nHodges’s counsels’ “hope of obtaining leniency during the sentencing phase” as a legitimate\r\njustification for pleading guilty. Id. However, the other reasons advanced in support of counsels’\r\ndecision lack support in the record. Most of the evidence of the circumstances of the murder was\r\nallowed in the penalty phase, and the “hard callous facts behind the offense” were not “desensitized by\r\navoiding the guilt phase.” Rather, those newly-presented facts were fresh in jurors’ minds when they\r\ndeliberated over imposition of the death penalty. As Gary Goodpaster observed:\r\n\r\n       [G]oing through a guilt phase trial helps to segregate and distance from the sentencer the\r\n       prosecution’s strongest case against the defendant. Were defendant simply to admit guilt\r\n       and go straight to the penalty phase trial, the prosecution at that time would undoubtedly\r\n       present much of what it otherwise would have presented during the guilt phase.\r\n\r\nGoodpaster, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. at 331. Hodges’s counsel did not consider the ramifications of pleading\r\nguilty rather than proceeding to the guilt phase of the trial. Much of the evidence they hoped to exclude\r\nwas admissible under Tennessee law. Counsel admitted forgetting about the aggravated robbery charge,\r\nitself an aggravating factor once Hodges pleaded guilty. Although I am mindful of the deference due\r\nto the state court under AEDPA, I must conclude that the decision that counsel met minimum\r\nconstitutional standards involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                     Hodges v. Colson                                                                      Page 40\r\n\r\n\r\n        B. Prejudice\r\n\r\n        In order to demonstrate prejudice, “the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability\r\nthat, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to\r\ntrial.” Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 59 (1985).2\r\n\r\n        The majority is correct that Hodges himself has never stated that, but for his counsel’s deficient\r\nadvice, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. Additionally,\r\nHodges’s habeas petition alleged that counsel’s advice to plead guilty constituted ineffective assistance,\r\nbut did not specifically state that, had counsel advised him otherwise, he would not have pleaded guilty.\r\nHodges’s brief on appeal states simply that “where Mr. Hodges had nothing to gain by pleading guilty,\r\nhe certainly would not have entered a guilty plea if his lawyers had given him accurate information –\r\nin fact, had Mr. Hodges’s lawyers done their research, they wouldn’t have advised Mr. Hodges to plead\r\nguilty at all.” (Opening Br. of Appellant 83.) However, this is not the typical guilty plea case.\r\n\r\n        As the majority correctly notes, Hodges was not protesting his innocence leading up to trial.\r\nRather, he had admitted his guilt in one or more television interviews and in letters to the prosecution\r\nand the trial court (against the advice of counsel). See J.A. at 1704, 1786 (testimony of Donald\r\nDawson). This certainly suggests that Hodges was ready to plead guilty, and that he would have been\r\nconvicted had he pleaded not guilty. That, however, does not settle the issue. The issue here is not\r\nwhether counsel were competent in their assessment and advice regarding the likelihood of conviction\r\nat trial, but rather in advising that there were significant benefits to forgoing trial. See Griffin v. United\r\nStates, 330 F.3d 733, 737 (6th Cir. 2003) (noting that it is “easier to show prejudice in the guilty plea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 2\r\n                  I do not join in the majority’s characterization of Rayner v. Mills, 685 F.3d 631 (6th Cir. 2012),\r\n        as contrary to the Supreme Court’s holding in Harrington v. Richter, 131 S. Ct. 770 (2011). The majority\r\n        does not address Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510 (2003), and Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374 (2005),\r\n        which Richter did not purport to overrule. In Wiggins, the Supreme Court stated that its “review [was] not\r\n        circumscribed by a state court conclusion with respect to prejudice, as neither of the state courts below\r\n        reached this prong of the Strickland analysis.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534; see Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 390\r\n        (“Because the state courts found the representation adequate, they never reached the issue of prejudice, . . .\r\n        and so we examine this element of the Strickland claim de novo[.]”). Although there is obvious tension\r\n        between Wiggins, Rompilla, and Richter, the panel’s opinion in Rayner resolved this tension, see Rayner,\r\n        685 F.3d 638–39, and its decision is consistent with decisions of our sister circuits. See Ferrell v. Hall, 640\r\n        F.3d 1199, 1224 (11th Cir. 2011); Sussman v. Jenkins, 642 F.3d 532, 533–34 (7th Cir. 2011) (Ripple, J.,\r\n        in chambers).\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 41\r\n\r\n\r\ncontext” than in other contexts “because the claimant need only show a reasonable probability that he\r\nwould have pleaded differently”).\r\n\r\n       In Hill, the Court stated that “where the alleged error of counsel is a failure to investigate or\r\ndiscover potentially exculpatory evidence, the determination whether the error ‘prejudiced’ the\r\ndefendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go to trial will depend on the likelihood that\r\ndiscovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea.” 474\r\nU.S. at 59. Hodges’s claim here is not that counsel failed to investigate or discover potentially\r\nexculpatory evidence that would have led him to change his plea, so this language from Hill is not\r\nsquarely on point. Hodges’s claim is, however, that counsel failed to adequately consider the benefits\r\nof going to trial, and based their decision to advise him to plead guilty on an erroneous understanding\r\nof the consequences of a guilty plea at sentencing and insufficient legal research and investigation into\r\nthe proper conduct of a capital case. This parallels the reasoning of Hill. Hodges’s two primary trial\r\nattorneys both testified that had they been aware of the proper standards for death penalty representation\r\nand had they accurately considered the drawbacks to pleading guilty, they would have advised Hodges\r\nto go to trial. J.A. at 1755, 1842. Thus, there is compelling evidence that counsel would have “changed\r\n[their] recommendation as to the plea.” Hill, 474 U.S. at 59.\r\n\r\n       The ultimate question under Strickland and Hill is whether the defendant has “established the\r\nreasonable probability that he would not have entered his plea but for his counsel’s deficiency.” Premo\r\nv. Moore, 131 S. Ct. 733, 744 (2011) (emphasis added). Although Hodges has not stated under oath that\r\nhe would not have pleaded guilty if his counsel had advised against it, counsel’s testimony that they\r\nwould have advised him against pleading guilty establishes the requisite “reasonable probability” of a\r\ndifferent outcome. This is not a case where the decision to plead guilty or not guilty was based on the\r\nlikelihood of conviction versus acquittal. Rather, the choice was made on the likely effect of the choice\r\non the outcome of the penalty phase, and it is clear that counsel’s advice in this regard was\r\nconstitutionally ineffective. Had Hodges’s counsel advised him to plead not guilty, there is no reason\r\nto think he would not have heeded their advice. His conduct during the penalty phase, including taking\r\nthe stand to provide testimony about his background in order to establish mitigating factors,\r\ndemonstrates that he preferred a sentence of life imprisonment over death. Had his counsel informed\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 42\r\n\r\n\r\nhim that the better strategy for achieving this outcome was to plead not guilty and go to trial in the guilt\r\nphase, there is more than a reasonable probability that Hodges would have taken their advice.\r\n\r\n         In sum, although the Supreme Court recently cautioned that “hindsight cannot suffice for relief\r\nwhen counsel’s choices [to advise the defendant to plead guilty] were reasonable and legitimate based\r\non predictions of how the trial would proceed,” and that “[t]here is a most substantial burden on the\r\nclaimant to show ineffective assistance” in that situation, Premo, 131 S. Ct. at 745, counsels’ choices\r\nhere were based on unreasonable predictions about how the penalty phase would proceed, particularly\r\nabout how pleading guilty would affect the prosecution’s ability to present damaging evidence about\r\nthe details of the crime, and a complete failure to consider the benefits of going through the guilt phase.\r\nFurther, Hodges has made an adequate showing of prejudice.\r\n\r\n         Because I conclude that the state court unreasonably applied Strickland, I respectfully dissent\r\nfrom Part III of the majority’s opinion and would grant Hodges’s petition for habeas corpus on this\r\nissue.\r\n\f",

BATCHELDER, Chief Judge. In 1992, a Tennessee jury convicted Petitioner-Appellant\r\nHenry Hodges of first-degree murder and sentenced him to death. The state courts upheld the conviction\r\nand sentence on appeal and denied Hodges’s petition for post-conviction relief. Hodges then petitioned for\r\nfederal habeas relief, which the district court denied. Hodges now appeals that denial to this court. For the\r\nfollowing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Hodges’s habeas petition.\r\n\r\n                                                  FACTS\r\n\r\n       The Tennessee Supreme Court summarized the facts of this case as follows:\r\n\r\n       The defendant, Henry Eugene Hodges, entered a guilty plea and was convicted of\r\n       premeditated first-degree murder. Thereafter, the penalty phase of the trial commenced. The\r\n       State presented proof of the circumstances of the offense through the testimony of Trina\r\n       Brown, the defendant’s fifteen-year-old girlfriend. Brown testified that one week before the\r\n       murder she and the twenty-four-year-old defendant, who were living with the defendant’s\r\n       brother in Smyrna, Tennessee, decided to move to Florida. To get money for the move,\r\n       Hodges, a male homosexual prostitute, told Brown that he would rob and kill the next person\r\n       who propositioned him. Hodges discussed with Brown how the crimes would be carried out.\r\n       Hodges repeated these statements on May 14, 1990, the day of this murder.\r\n       On the night of May 14, Brown and Hodges went to Centennial Park in Nashville. When\r\n       the victim, Ronald Bassett, approached, Hodges talked with him, and they left together in\r\n       the victim’s vehicle and went to the victim’s residence at 3133A, Parthenon Avenue, across\r\n       from Centennial Park. Ten or fifteen minutes later, Hodges returned to the park on foot, and\r\n       along with Brown, drove back to the victim’s residence in his own car. Hodges told Brown\r\n       to lie down in the backseat of the car so no one could see her. When they arrived at the\r\n       victim’s residence, Hodges told Brown to wait in the car. After an unspecified period of\r\n       time, Hodges returned to the car, wearing gloves, and asked Brown to come into the house.\r\n       Brown testified that when she arrived, Bassett was lying face down on the bed in his\r\n       bedroom with a pillow over his head. Hodges had bound his feet together with duct tape and\r\n       had handcuffed his hands. While Bassett lay helplessly, Brown and the defendant ransacked\r\n       the house searching for items of value. After obtaining the personal identification number\r\n       for the victim’s automatic teller card, Brown and the defendant “took a break,” drank a coke,\r\n       and discussed whether to kill Bassett. Brown testified that she told Hodges to kill Bassett\r\n       to prevent their arrest. Hodges then went into the bedroom and, ignoring the victim’s pleas\r\n\fNo. 09-5021               Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 3\r\n\r\n\r\n     not to kill him, strangled Bassett to death with a nylon rope. Brown testified that she heard\r\n     Bassett moan and make a choking sound and that it took about five minutes for Bassett to\r\n     die.\r\n     In an attempt to remove any fingerprints, the defendant wiped off various items in the\r\n     residence. After turning the air conditioner in Bassett’s bedroom on high to prevent\r\n     discovery of the body, Hodges and Brown left the victim’s residence, taking the victim’s\r\n     automobile and several items of personal property, including jewelry, a gun, and a VCR.\r\n     After using Bassett’s automatic teller card to withdraw the twenty-four-hour maximum of\r\n     four hundred dollars from his account, the pair returned to the house of the defendant’s\r\n     brother and went to bed. The next day, having learned that the victim’s body had been\r\n     discovered, Brown and the defendant abandoned the victim’s car in rural Rutherford County\r\n     and drove to Georgia in their own car. They were eventually arrested in North Carolina.\r\n     Items of the victim’s personal property were found in their possession at this time. Also, the\r\n     defendant’s fingerprints were found on items inside Bassett’s home, and Brown had been\r\n     photographed withdrawing money with Bassett’s automatic teller card.\r\n     Testifying for the State at the sentencing hearing, Dr. Charles Harlan, the chief medical\r\n     examiner for Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County, confirmed that Bassett had died\r\n     from ligature strangulation. Dr. Harlan opined that Bassett would have remained alive and\r\n     conscious for at least three and perhaps as long as five minutes during the strangulation.\r\n     Harlan also found abrasions on the victim’s wrists consistent with handcuffs.\r\n     The State proved that the defendant had been convicted of armed robbery, attempted\r\n     kidnaping and robbery in Hamilton County in 1984. The State also established that the\r\n     defendant had been convicted of murder in Fulton County, Georgia, in July 1990. The\r\n     record reveals that the Georgia killing occurred when the defendant and Brown arrived in\r\n     Atlanta after murdering Bassett. Hodges made arrangements with a man to engage in\r\n     homosexual acts for an agreed price. Hodges accompanied the man to his motel room, but\r\n     when the man was unable to pay the agreed price, Hodges murdered him.\r\n     In mitigation, the defendant testified and also presented the testimony of his mother, his\r\n     brothers and Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a child psychiatrist. This proof showed that the defendant\r\n     was the next to youngest of his mother’s five sons. His mother and father were not married.\r\n     His father was actually married to another woman, but engaged in what one of the witnesses\r\n     described as an “irregular union” with the defendant’s mother for eighteen years. The\r\n     defendant’s father abused the defendant’s mother and was strict with the defendant’s\r\n     brothers, three of whom were the children of another man. The defendant, however, was his\r\n     father’s favorite and was spoiled. Financial difficulties forced the family to move about\r\n     frequently, and defendant’s father supported the family only sporadically.\r\n     The defense introduced proof to show that Hodges seemed normal until he was twelve years\r\n     old. At that time, he began to associate with older boys, sniff glue and gasoline, be truant\r\n     from school, and run away from home. He also engaged in sexual activities with his younger\r\n\fNo. 09-5021               Hodges v. Colson                                                         Page 4\r\n\r\n\r\n     brother and attempted sexual activities with a female cousin. He became involved with the\r\n     juvenile authorities and was confined to a juvenile facility in Chattanooga.\r\n     Through his mitigation proof, the defendant attempted to establish that a catalyst and major\r\n     contributing cause of his delinquent and later criminal behavior was his rape and sexual\r\n     abuse by a stranger when he was twelve years old. According to the defendant, he accepted\r\n     a stranger’s offer of a ride home when he was playing a short distance from his home on\r\n     Fessler’s Lane in Nashville. Rather than driving Hodges home, the stranger drove Hodges\r\n     to his home and raped him. Fearing rejection by his homophobic father and driven by guilt,\r\n     the defendant told no one of this incident until he was arrested in 1990.\r\n     Dr. Nurcombe testified that, while the defendant suffered from an antisocial personality\r\n     disorder, low self-esteem, and substance (marijuana) abuse, the killing was motivated by a\r\n     subconscious desire for revenge for the sexual abuse inflicted on him when he was twelve,\r\n     coupled with Hodges’ fear that his family might discover that he was engaged in homosexual\r\n     prostitution since Brown had told Hodge’s [sic] sister-in-law shortly before the killing that\r\n     he was a homosexual prostitute. The defense also introduced testimony that Brown\r\n     dominated and manipulated the defendant.\r\n     In rebuttal the State called Dr. James Kyser, a forensic psychiatrist, and Dr. Leonard\r\n     Morgan, a clinical psychologist. Both had examined the defendant and concluded that he\r\n     suffered from an antisocial personality disorder. They described persons with this disorder\r\n     as having “no conscience,” being “self centered,” being “notoriously dishonest and\r\n     untruthful,” and having “very little regard for the feelings of others and . . . willing to use\r\n     any means to get what they want, no matter who it hurts.” While acknowledging the\r\n     complicated factors involved in antisocial personality disorders, the State’s experts\r\n     discounted the singular importance of the one incident of alleged sexual abuse in causing the\r\n     defendant’s actions. Dr. Morgan concluded that the defendant “was in complete control of\r\n     his behavior” and not suffering from mental illness or emotional disturbance.\r\n     Based on the evidence presented, the jury determined that the State had proven the existence\r\n     of three aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) “[t]he defendant was\r\n     previously convicted of one or more felonies, other than the present charge whose statutory\r\n     elements involve the use of violence to the person;” (2) “[t]he murder was especially\r\n     heinous, atrocious or cruel in that it involved torture or serious physical abuse beyond that\r\n     necessary to produce death;” and (3) “[t]he murder was committed while the defendant was\r\n     engaged in committing, or was an accomplice in the commission of, or attempting to\r\n     commit, or fleeing after committing a robbery.” Tenn. Code Ann. § 39–13–204(i)(2); (i)(5)\r\n     and (i)(7) (1991 Repl.). In addition, the jury found that the aggravating circumstances\r\n     outweighed the mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt and, as a result,\r\n     sentenced the defendant to death by electrocution. The trial court entered a judgment in\r\n     accordance with the jury’s verdict and the Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed. After\r\n     reviewing the record and considering the errors alleged by the defendant, we affirm the\r\n     judgment of the trial court and Court of Criminal Appeals.\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v.

The\r\nTennessee Supreme Court denied an application for permission to appeal in March 2001.\r\n\r\n       Hodges filed a petition to proceed in forma pauperis in federal district court in May 2001, a\r\nprovisional petition for a writ of habeas corpus in July 2001, and an amended petition in March 2002.\r\nHodges raised 32 claims and subclaims in his amended habeas petition. The district court granted some of\r\nHodges’s discovery requests, denied others, and denied Hodges’s request for an evidentiary hearing. In\r\nMarch 2008, the district court denied Hodges’s habeas petition. Hodges applied for a Certificate of\r\nAppealability (“COA”), and the district court granted a COA as to all claims.\r\n\r\n                                       STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       This court reviews de novo a district court’s legal conclusions and mixed questions of law and fact,\r\nand reviews its factual findings for clear error.

Under\r\nthe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (“AEDPA”), a district court may not grant a habeas\r\npetition with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in the state courts unless the\r\nadjudication resulted in a decision that: (1) was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of,\r\nclearly established federal law as determined by the Supreme Court; or (2) was based on an unreasonable\r\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented to the state courts. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). Under\r\nthe “contrary to” clause, a federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court arrives at a conclusion\r\nopposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law, or if the state court decides a case\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v.

Under the “unreasonable application” clause, a federal habeas court may\r\ngrant the writ if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court’s\r\ndecisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the petitioner’s case. Id. To obtain habeas\r\nrelief, “a state prisoner must show that the state court’s ruling on the claim being presented in federal court\r\nwas so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law\r\nbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.” Harrington v.

Hodges failed to brief the remaining claims for\r\nwhich the district court granted a COA and, therefore, has waived them. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(9)(A);\r\nLandrum v.

Restrictions on Voir Dire\r\n\r\n          Hodges alleges that he was denied his right to a fair and impartial jury when the trial court refused\r\nto allow his attorneys to ask prospective jurors whether they could consider a life sentence for a defendant\r\nwith a prior conviction for murder. Specifically, defense counsel repeatedly attempted to ask the following\r\nquestion or a variation thereof: “Could you impose a life sentence for somebody who has been convicted\r\nof first degree murder twice?” The trial court repeatedly sustained the prosecution’s objections to the\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n          Hodges raised this claim on direct appeal. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals rejected it,\r\nfinding that each juror was asked and allowed to answer questions about whether he could follow the law,\r\nconsider a life sentence, and weigh the aggravating and mitigating circumstances.

The court also found that a prospective juror could not answer the question “without\r\nknowing more about the facts surrounding the case,” and that the question impermissibly sought “to obtain\r\na pledge from the prospective juror.” Id. The district court found that the state court’s decision was not an\r\nunreasonable application of federal law, agreeing with the state appellate court that Hodges’s questions\r\nimproperly sought to commit the jurors to an opinion before hearing all of the evidence.\r\n\r\n          The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant a trial by an impartial jury.

Questions are constitutionally compelled only if “the trial court’s failure to ask these questions\r\n. . . render[s] the defendant’s trial fundamentally unfair.” Id.\r\n\r\n          Hodges relies primarily on Morgan in support of his position. In Morgan, the trial court did not\r\npermit defense counsel to ask prospective jurors the following question: “If you found [the defendant]\r\nguilty, would you automatically vote to impose the death penalty no matter what the facts are?” Morgan,\r\n504 U.S. at 723. The Supreme Court held that general questions about following the law were not enough\r\nand that it was error to exclude a more specific question tailored to identify jurors “who would always\r\nimpose death following conviction [of a capital offense].” Id. at 733, 735 (emphasis in original).\r\n\f No. 09-5021                      Hodges v. Colson                                                                         Page 8\r\n\r\n\r\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals’ determination that the trial court’s restrictions on voir\r\ndire were permissible was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of federal law. The trial court\r\nallowed defense counsel to ask the Morgan question, i.e., whether there was an aggravating circumstance\r\nthat would cause her automatically to impose the death penalty. In fact, the trial court went beyond that and\r\nalso allowed defense counsel to ask prospective jurors whether they could impose a life sentence on a\r\ndefendant who had a prior conviction for a violent felony.1 Only when defense counsel sought to get even\r\nmore specific—asking whether a prospective juror could impose a life sentence on a defendant who had a\r\nprior first-degree murder conviction—did the trial court restrict questioning.\r\n\r\n       This circuit has held that voir dire questions about how a potential juror would vote if given specific\r\nexamples of aggravating or mitigating evidence are not constitutionally compelled under Morgan. In\r\nDennis, 354 F.3d at 523, the petitioner alleged that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by\r\nrefusing to permit him to ask prospective jurors about specific mitigating factors, including age, lack of prior\r\ncriminal history, and environment. We held that the Ohio Supreme Court’s conclusion that the trial court\r\nallowed adequate questioning was “not an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the record”\r\nand was not “contrary to United States Supreme Court precedent.” Id. at 525. We noted that the trial court\r\nhad allowed the petitioner’s counsel to ask prospective jurors about mitigating factors in general: whether\r\nor not they could consider mitigating factors and return a life sentence; whether they could follow the law;\r\nand whether any of the jury panel had strong feelings about psychological evidence concerning upbringing,\r\ndiscipline, and lack of discipline. Id. at 524–26.\r\n\r\n       Similarly, in Bedford v. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1208711\"><a href=\"/opinion/1208711/bedford-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">225</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2009), we rejected the petitioner’s claim that\r\nthe trial court improperly limited the scope of voir dire by prohibiting counsel from asking questions that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   1\r\n                      In one instance, defense counsel asked if a prospective juror could consider mitigating evidence\r\n          for a defendant who had been previously convicted of a violent felony (as opposed to a previous conviction\r\n          for first-degree murder). The juror answered “[p]robably not” and was subsequently excluded for cause.\r\n          Hodges claims the exclusion of this juror “proves the fundamental unfairness of the trial court’s restrictions\r\n          [on voir dire].” Pet.’s Br. at 69. We disagree for at least two reasons. First, the question posed to that\r\n          juror contemplated a conviction for any violent felony, which is different from a question asking about a\r\n          specific violent felony actually at issue in the trial (e.g., first-degree murder). Second, the trial court’s\r\n          exclusion of that juror on the basis of her answer to that specific question does nothing whatsoever to\r\n          suggest that the trial court was constitutionally compelled to allow the excluded questions, which focused\r\n          on first-degree murder, not violent felonies in general. Accordingly, despite Hodges’s vehement\r\n          arguments to the contrary, the exclusion of that juror does not provide compelling support for his position.\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                         Page 9\r\n\r\n\r\nsought to elicit prospective jurors’ views on the petitioner’s specific case. We noted that the trial court\r\n“drew the line at questions that sought to elicit the jurors’ views on [the petitioner’s] specific case—but\r\nmany judges understandably (and properly) would do the same thing to prevent the lawyers from\r\npreviewing their case through voir dire.” Id. at 232 (emphasis added). Ultimately we concluded that the\r\nrestrictions on voir dire “did not render the process fundamentally unfair. [The restrictions] reflect instead\r\na reasonable effort to enable adequate exploration of juror biases (on the one hand) while preventing counsel\r\nfrom extracting commitments from individual jurors as to the way they would vote (on the other).” Id.\r\n(citing Dennis, 354 F.3d at 523–25).\r\n\r\n       Other circuits agree that Morgan does not compel a trial court to allow questions about how a\r\npotential juror would vote if given specific examples of aggravating or mitigating evidence.

In Richmond, the\r\nFourth Circuit addressed a claim functionally identical to the one presented here by Hodges. There, the\r\ndefendant sought to ask potential jurors “if . . . knowing that [the defendant] had a previous first-degree\r\nmurder conviction, they could still consider mitigating circumstances . . . in determining what their ultimate\r\nrecommendation as to life or death is going to be.” Richmond, 375 F.3d at 316. The trial court denied\r\ncounsel’s request to ask the question “on the basis that it was a ‘stakeout’ question aimed at determining\r\nwhat prospective jurors would do if presented with a certain state of evidence.” Id. The North Carolina\r\nSupreme Court agreed and affirmed. Id. at 329–30. The Fourth Circuit held that the North Carolina\r\nSupreme Court’s decision “was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of Morgan.” Id. at 330\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). It reasoned:\r\n\r\n       Morgan does not require that a capital defendant be allowed to determine at voir dire what\r\n       a prospective juror’s sentencing decision will be if presented with a specific state of evidence\r\n       or circumstances. Rather, Morgan requires that a capital defendant be afforded an adequate\r\n       opportunity at voir dire to identify prospective jurors who, even prior to the State’s case in\r\n       chief, have predetermined to impose the death penalty.\r\n\r\nId. (internal quotation marks and formatting omitted).\r\n\f  No. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 10\r\n\r\n\r\n       We agree with the Fourth Circuit’s reasoning in Richmond, and we hereby reaffirm our own holdings\r\nin Dennis and Bedford. Trial courts have “a great deal” of discretion in conducting voir dire. Morgan, 504\r\nU.S. at 729. Morgan simply does not require a trial court to permit defense counsel to ask prospective jurors\r\nhow they would vote assuming the existence of particular mitigating or aggravating circumstances, which\r\nis essentially what defense counsel sought to do here. Morgan allows for the identification and exclusion\r\nof jurors who are biased for or against the death penalty before being presented with any evidence and\r\nwould always vote in accordance with their biases without regard to the particular facts of the particular\r\ncase. Id. at 733 (“Were voir dire not available to lay bare the foundation of petitioner’s challenge for cause\r\nagainst those prospective jurors who would always impose death following conviction, his right not to be\r\ntried by such jurors would be rendered . . . nugatory.”) (emphasis in original)). When defense counsel asks\r\nquestions about the specific aggravating and/or mitigating factors actually at issue in a case, defense counsel\r\nis no longer attempting to identify members of the venire who would always vote for the death penalty;\r\nrather, defense counsel is attempting to preview how prospective jurors will vote given the specific facts\r\nof the individual case, and Morgan does not require a trial court to allow such previews.\r\n\r\n       Here, defense counsel was permitted to ask the Morgan question and was even permitted to go\r\nbeyond that and ask questions such as whether a juror could impose a life sentence on a defendant with\r\nprevious violent-felony convictions. That was easily sufficient to comply with Morgan’s requirement that\r\na capital defendant be allowed to identify prospective jurors who would “always” vote for death. See id.\r\nThe trial court excluded only questions concerning specific aggravating factors actually at issue in the case\r\n(namely, a previous conviction for first-degree murder). Accordingly, the decision of the Tennessee Court\r\nof Criminal Appeals affirming the trial court’s restrictions on voir dire was neither contrary to nor an\r\nunreasonable application of federal law, and Hodges is not entitled to habeas relief on this claim.\r\n\r\nII.    Juror Misconduct\r\n\r\n       Hodges claims that his death sentence violates his Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights\r\nbecause juror Leroy Thompson engaged in misconduct by allegedly misinforming the trial court that he\r\nwould be able to sit on the jury but then voting for the death penalty only because he was in pain due to\r\narthritis and wanted to end deliberations. Hodges included Thompson’s alleged misconduct as a ground for\r\n\f No. 09-5021                     Hodges v. Colson                                                                     Page 11\r\n\r\n\r\nhis request for an evidentiary hearing. Hodges concedes that he never raised this matter in the state courts\r\nand that it is therefore procedurally defaulted, but he contends that he can establish cause and prejudice to\r\nexcuse the procedural default.\r\n\r\n       Whether a petitioner’s federal habeas claim is barred by procedural default is a question that we\r\nreview de novo.2 Abela v.

That finding was clearly\r\n         erroneous; Leroy Thompson’s name appears on the verdict form.

A prisoner may file a motion to reopen his first post-conviction petition only if his claim\r\nstems from a newly established constitutional right that applies retroactively, relies on scientific evidence\r\nthat he is actually innocent, or involves a sentence enhanced because of a previous conviction that has been\r\ndeclared invalid.

Code Ann.\r\n§ 40-30-217(a) (1996 Supp.)). Hodges’s juror misconduct claim does not fall within any of these\r\nexceptions. Because he failed to present the claim to the state courts and no state court remedies remain\r\navailable, the claim is procedurally defaulted. See O’Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 848.\r\n\r\n       At the district court, Hodges argued that various causes could excuse his procedural default,\r\nincluding ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel,\r\nreliance on Thompson’s responses in voir dire, and Hodges’s inability to locate Thompson before the post-\r\nconviction evidentiary hearing. Ineffective assistance of counsel can constitute cause for a procedural\r\ndefault. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at 492. However, “an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim asserted as\r\ncause for the procedural default of another claim can itself be procedurally defaulted.” Edwards v.\r\nCarpenter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118357\"><a href=\"/opinion/118357/edwards-v-carpenter/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453 (2000). In post-conviction proceedings, Hodges raised a claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of appellate counsel regarding Thompson’s competence. He did not claim that appellate counsel\r\nwere ineffective for failing to raise the claim that Thompson engaged in misconduct. Accordingly, Hodges\r\ncannot rely on ineffective assistance of counsel to establish cause to excuse his procedural default.\r\n\r\n       Nor can Hodges rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to establish cause to excuse\r\nhis default, even if this holding is not so clear-cut as it once would have been. Historically, the federal\r\ncourts have held that there is no constitutional right to an attorney in post-conviction proceedings, and that\r\nineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel therefore cannot establish cause for procedural default.\r\nSee Carpenter, 529 U.S. at 450–53; Coleman, 501 U.S. at 752; Landrum, 625 F.3d at 919. But the Supreme\r\nCourt recently held in Martinez v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2012), that there is a “narrow exception” to\r\nColeman: “Inadequate assistance of counsel at initial review collateral proceedings may establish cause for\r\na procedural default of a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.” Id. at 1315 (emphasis added). This\r\n“equitable”—as opposed to constitutional—exception is premised on Coleman itself, a case in which the\r\nCourt declined to address the situation in which “state collateral review is the first place a prisoner can\r\npresent a challenge to his conviction.” Coleman, 501 U.S. at 755. The Martinez Court held that in such\r\n\f No. 09-5021                    Hodges v. Colson                                                                     Page 13\r\n\r\n\r\nsituations ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel may be raised as cause to excuse procedural\r\ndefault because “the collateral proceeding is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner’s direct appeal as\r\nto the ineffective assistance claim.” Martinez, 132 S. Ct. at 1317.\r\n\r\n       The Court in Martinez purported to craft a narrow exception3 to Coleman. We will assume that the\r\nSupreme Court meant exactly what it wrote:                   “Coleman held that an attorney’s negligence in a\r\npostconviction proceeding does not establish cause, and this remains true except as to initial-review\r\ncollateral proceedings for claims of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial.” Id. at 1316 (emphasis added).\r\nThe Supreme Court further insisted:\r\n\r\n       The rule of Coleman governs in all but the limited circumstances recognized here. The\r\n       holding in this case does not concern attorney errors in other kinds of proceedings,\r\n       including appeals from initial-review collateral proceedings, second or successive collateral\r\n       proceedings, and petitions for discretionary review in a State’s appellate courts. It does not\r\n       extend to attorney errors in any proceeding beyond the first occasion the State allows a\r\n       prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial, even though that initial-review\r\n       collateral proceeding may be deficient for other reasons. In addition, the limited nature of\r\n       the qualification to Coleman adopted here reflects the importance of the right to the effective\r\n       assistance of trial counsel and Arizona’s decision to bar defendants from raising\r\n       ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal. Our holding here addresses only the\r\n       constitutional claims presented in this case, where the State barred the defendant from\r\n       raising the claims on direct appeal.\r\n\r\nId. (internal citations omitted; emphases added).\r\n\r\n       We will address Hodges’s claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel in a different section, but\r\nhere he claims ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel as cause to excuse default of his claim of\r\nineffective assistance of appellate counsel for failure to raise the juror misconduct issue on direct appeal.\r\nUnder Martinez’s unambiguous holding our previous understanding of Coleman in this regard is still the\r\nlaw—ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel cannot supply cause for procedural default of a claim\r\nof ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. See, e.g., Landrum, 625 F.3d at 919. Moreover, 28 U.S.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  3\r\n                    We are reminded of one jurist’s statement, made in a different context, that “[e]xceptions to\r\n         categorical rules, once created, are difficult to cabin; the logic of the new rule, like water, finds its own\r\n         level, and it’s hard to keep it from covering far more than anticipated.” United States v.

Ct. at 1320, and Hodges has not presented any evidence to justify review of his claim\r\nin order to prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, Hodges cannot rely on statements made by Thompson at voir dire or difficulties in\r\nlocating Thompson during state post-conviction proceedings to establish cause. Thompson discussed his\r\npain-causing arthritis at voir dire on January 27, 1992. The verdict form is dated January 30, 1992. Hodges\r\nfiled his petition for state post-conviction relief on December 11, 1997. He first attempted to locate\r\nThompson in or around June 1998. Hodges gives no explanation whatsoever as to why nearly six-and-a-half\r\nyears elapsed between his conviction and his first attempt to locate Thompson. Moreover, Hodges gives\r\nno explanation as to why or how he was able to locate Thompson for the federal habeas proceeding but not\r\nfor the state post-conviction proceeding.\r\n\r\n       “[T]he existence of cause for a procedural default must ordinarily turn on whether the prisoner can\r\nshow that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel’s efforts to comply with the State’s\r\nprocedural rule.” Carrier, 477 U.S. at 479. For nearly six-and-a-half years, Hodges was aware that\r\nThompson had arthritis and may have been in pain during jury deliberations but failed to seek him out. The\r\nfact that Hodges did not even attempt to locate Thompson until it was nearly too late, and then could not\r\nfind him in time to present his testimony to the state court, is not an objective factor external to the defense\r\nsufficient to establish cause to excuse procedural default.\r\n\r\n       Finally, Hodges has not presented any evidence that review of this claim is necessary in order to\r\nprevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See id. at 495–96. This exception has been applied only when\r\na habeas petitioner has demonstrated that he is actually innocent. See Carter v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793892\"><a href=\"/opinion/793892/clarence-carter-v-betty-mitchell-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 538\r\n(6th Cir. 2006) (citing Carrier, 477 U.S. at 496). Hodges has not presented new evidence of his innocence\r\nnor has he even argued that he is actually innocent.\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, Hodges is unable to establish the cause necessary to excuse his procedural default of\r\nthis claim. It was therefore appropriate for the district court to deny both an evidentiary hearing and habeas\r\nrelief on this claim because the claim is barred.\r\n\f  No. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 15\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Plea Phase\r\n\r\n       Hodges argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by advising him to plead guilty; that\r\nbecause of their deficient performance, his guilty plea was neither knowing, voluntary, nor intelligent; and\r\nthat he was prejudiced by his counsel’s performance. Hodges claims that his lawyers mistakenly believed\r\nthat his pleading guilty would prohibit the state from introducing any evidence relating to the facts of the\r\nmurder; that his lawyers forgot that if he pled guilty to the aggravated robbery charge, Hodges would\r\nimmediately become death eligible; and that he would not have pled guilty if his lawyers had given him\r\naccurate information.\r\n\r\n       Hodges failed to appeal the plea-invalidity claim to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, and\r\nreferred to it only in the final page of his brief without citing to the record or any legal authority. The\r\nTennessee Court of Criminal Appeals considered the issue waived and declined to address it, relying on\r\nTenn. Crim. App. R. 10(b) and Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7). See Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *32. To the\r\nextent that it is a separate claim, the plea-invalidity claim is procedurally defaulted. See Middlebrooks v.\r\nBell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"174527\"><a href=\"/opinion/174527/middlebrooks-v-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">619</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535–36 (6th Cir. 2010). Hodges cannot rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction\r\ncounsel to excuse the default; neither has he presented any evidence to justify review of his claim in order\r\nto prevent a fundamental miscarriage of justice. See Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96. Accordingly, the plea-\r\ninvalidity claim is barred, and this court will review only the ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\r\n\r\n       Hodges raised the ineffective assistance claim in his state post-conviction petition. The trial court\r\nheld an evidentiary hearing and took testimony from Hodges’s trial counsel. Hodges v. Tennessee, No.\r\nM1999-00516-CCA-R3-PD, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *18 (Tenn. Crim. App. Oct. 20, 2000). The Court of\r\nCriminal Appeals summarized the evidence presented as follows:\r\n\r\n       At the post-conviction hearing, Dawson [defense counsel at trial] testified that the decision\r\n       to enter a guilty plea was made the weekend prior to trial when it was determined that “there\r\n       was no way we were going to convince anybody that Mr. Hodges didn't kill the victim in this\r\n       matter.” He explained that, at that time, the defense team believed that by entering a plea\r\n       during the guilt phase of the trial, they would gain credibility with the jury for the sentencing\r\n       phase. The defense team also hoped to surprise the State by entering the plea. In essence,\r\n       the defense team intended to disrupt the bifurcated nature of the trial, thereby precluding the\r\n       State from introducing evidence during the penalty phase which the State had planned to\r\n       introduce at the guilt phase. Notwithstanding this reasoning, Dawson admitted that,\r\n\f  No. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 16\r\n\r\n\r\n       although the proof was overwhelming, in hindsight, they should have proceeded to trial so\r\n       that they could have begun introduction of their mitigation theories. Michael Terry [defense\r\n       counsel at trial] corroborated Dawson's testimony regarding the appellant's guilty plea. He\r\n       explained that the plea was supposed to be “a demonstration of remorse for the jury.”\r\n       However, he agrees that the decision was a mistake and that they should have at a least\r\n       “pitched a fight.” [Hodges] did not testify at the post-conviction hearing.\r\n\r\nId. The trial court held that counsel made an informed tactical decision to advise Hodges to plead guilty.\r\nId.\r\n\r\n       The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed that decision. It cited Hill v. Lockhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), for the proposition that the two-prong standard from Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\r\n(1984), applies to ineffective assistance of counsel claims arising out of guilty plea proceedings. Hodges,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *19–20. The court concluded that the advice to plead guilty was not “outside the\r\nrange of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.” Id. at *20. The court noted the\r\noverwhelming evidence of guilt, the reasonable hope of obtaining leniency, the reasonable belief that the\r\njury would view the guilty plea as an expression of remorse, and the elimination of the presentation to the\r\njury of all of the evidence available of Hodges’s guilt. Id. at *19.\r\n\r\n       The district court held that the state court’s conclusion that Hodges’s counsel made a strategic\r\ndecision to advise him to plead guilty was not unreasonable. The court noted that Hodges’s counsel had\r\ndone substantial work on the case before advising him to plead guilty; that counsel were experienced, aware\r\nof the state’s proof and the elements of the offenses charged; had the aid of three experts; and were impaired\r\nby Hodges’s public statements admitting to several murders. The district court also found that Hodges did\r\nnot establish prejudice because Hodges did not testify at his post-conviction hearing and thus did not say\r\nthat he would not have pled guilty but for the advice of counsel.\r\n\r\n       After a careful review of the record, we agree with the district court. The state court’s determination\r\nthat defense counsel’s performance was not deficient was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of\r\n\f No. 09-5021                   Hodges v. Colson                                                               Page 17\r\n\r\n\r\nfederal law. Moreover, even if we were to find deficient performance, Hodges has failed to show that he\r\nwas prejudiced by the performance.4\r\n\r\n       To establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel, Hodges must show that (1) his counsel’s\r\nperformance was deficient; and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. Strickland, 466 U.S.\r\nat 687–88. An attorney’s performance is deficient if it is objectively unreasonable under prevailing\r\nprofessional norms. Id. at 688. “[A] court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct falls\r\nwithin the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the\r\npresumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.”\r\nId. at 689. The test for prejudice is whether there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s\r\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceedings would have been different. Id. at 694. To show\r\nprejudice in the guilty-plea context, a defendant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\r\nfor counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.”\r\nHill, 474 U.S. at 59. “[W]here the alleged error of counsel is a failure to advise the defendant of a potential\r\naffirmative defense to the crime charged, the resolution of the ‘prejudice’ inquiry will depend largely on\r\nwhether the affirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.” Id.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court has recently noted that “[e]stablishing that a state court’s application of\r\nStrickland was unreasonable under § 2254(d) is all the more difficult.” Harrington v. Richter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182992\"><a href=\"/opinion/182992/harrington-v-richter/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\r\nTherefore, “[w]hen § 2254(d) applies, the question is not whether counsel’s actions were reasonable. The\r\nquestion is whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential\r\nstandard.” Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 4\r\n                   We note that two recent Supreme Court cases—Lafler v.

Colson                                                       Page 18\r\n\r\n\r\n       A.       Performance\r\n\r\n       Using the “doubly” deferential standards of § 2254(d) and Strickland, we conclude that the state\r\ncourt’s determination that defense counsel’s performance was not deficient was neither contrary to nor an\r\nunreasonable application of federal law. Trial counsel advised Hodges to plead guilty because of the\r\noverwhelming evidence of his guilt, to give the defense credibility, to limit the proof the prosecution could\r\npresent, and to show Hodges’s remorse.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court has explicitly approved using the American Bar Association (“ABA”)\r\nGuidelines on attorney performance in effect at the time of a defendant’s trial as “guides to determining\r\nwhat is reasonable” performance by counsel. See, e.g., Padilla v. Kentucky, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1723\"><a href=\"/opinion/1723/padilla-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Bradshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"175168\"><a href=\"/opinion/175168/post-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (6th Cir. 2010) (quoting\r\nBobby v. Van Hook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758/bobby-v-van-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (2009)) (some internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\n       The ABA Guidelines in effect at the time of Hodges’s trial contemplated negotiated guilty pleas only\r\nwhere the defendant is assured of a sentence less than death. ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and\r\nPerformance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (“ABA Guidelines”), § 11.6.1 (1989). “If no written\r\nguarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be\r\nextremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client’s trial rights.” Id. § 11.6.3 cmt.\r\n\r\n       Courts also find that a defendant has little to gain from pleading guilty in a capital case, even when\r\nthe evidence of guilt is overwhelming. “[P]leading guilty [in a capital case] without a guarantee that the\r\nprosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.” Florida v. Nixon,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137735\"><a href=\"/opinion/137735/florida-v-nixon/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 191 n.6 (2004) (citing ABA Guidelines § 10.9.2 cmt. (rev.ed. 2003)). The Nixon Court noted\r\nthat pleading guilty “increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during\r\nthe sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors’ minds as they\r\ndeliberate on the sentence.” Id. Nevertheless, the Court concluded that “counsel cannot be deemed\r\nineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in a useless\r\ncharade.” Id. at 192 (internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\f No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 19\r\n\r\n\r\n       This court has also recently decided a similar, but distinguishable, case. In Post, 621 F.3d at 415–18,\r\na pre-Richter case, we addressed whether trial counsel’s advice to enter a no-contest plea and to submit the\r\npenalty phase to a three-judge panel rather than a jury was objectively reasonable under Strickland. Using\r\nde novo review, we concluded that the defendant’s weak mitigation case made the decision reasonable,\r\nnoting that “[the defendant’s] counsel were between a rock and a hard place in determining the best way\r\nto spare him a death sentence, given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, his numerous confessions, and\r\nhis refusal to plead guilty.” Id. at 418. We held that although the no-contest plea resulted in the defendant’s\r\nbeing “sentenced by judges, not jurors, and by three persons rather than twelve,” the strategy was\r\nprofessionally reasonable because the sentencing judges could have viewed the no-contest plea as a\r\nmitigating factor (although ultimately they did not). Id. at 417.\r\n\r\n       Trial counsel’s advice to plead guilty here was questionable. Defense counsel hoped that Hodges’s\r\npleading guilty would accomplish the following: (1) gain credibility with the jury, (2) demonstrate\r\nHodges’s remorse, (3) limit the evidence presented to the jury, and (4) surprise the prosecution and thereby\r\nlimit the effectiveness of its penalty case. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals noted that although\r\nthe goals of counsel were reasonable, Hodges “ultimately gained nothing by pleading guilty.” Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20. For example, despite counsel’s attempt to limit the evidence presented to the jury,\r\na vast majority of what they hoped to keep out was allowed in. Trina Brown testified that Hodges planned\r\nto rob and kill the next person who propositioned him, and that he discussed how to carry out the crimes.\r\nShe also told the jury that Hodges bound the victim’s hands and feet and that, after she and Hodges\r\nransacked the victim’s apartment, Hodges strangled the victim, who was begging for his life. Hodges, 944\r\nS.W.2d at 349. Police officers testified that the victim’s belongings were found in Hodges’s possession\r\nwhen he was arrested, that Hodges’s fingerprints were found in the victim’s home, and that Brown was\r\nphotographed using the victim’s ATM card. Id. at 350.\r\n\r\n       Defense counsel did successfully limit the prosecution’s cross-examination of Hodges; the State was\r\npermitted to ask questions only about his personal history, and not about the circumstances of the offense.\r\nId. at 350 n.6. However, the same result could have been achieved by putting on a reasonable doubt defense\r\nand having Hodges testify only during the sentencing hearing. This is also true of defense counsel’s goals\r\nof gaining credibility with the jury and showing remorse.\r\n\f No. 09-5021                  Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 20\r\n\r\n\r\n       Moreover, defense attorney Dawson testified in the state post-conviction proceeding that the defense\r\nteam “never sat down and did an analysis of what are the benefits of going to trial, what are the deficits and\r\nwhere did that lead us.” He also testified that when the defense team advised Hodges to plead guilty, he had\r\n“totally forgotten” about the third count of the indictment, aggravated robbery; a conviction on that count\r\nconstituted an aggravating factor for purposes of the penalty phase.\r\n\r\n       However, trial counsel also acknowledged that the evidence of Hodges’s guilt was overwhelming.\r\nAs counsel explained during the state post-conviction proceeding, despite their advice that he should not\r\nspeak with reporters, Hodges participated in a pre-trial television series in which he gave interviews\r\n“describing himself as a serial killer.” Attorney Dawson described the difficulties that arose from\r\nrepresenting such a client: “We had a client that was confessing to the public on eight murders. And he had\r\nwritten to the court; he had written to the prosecutor, a confession to the case that we had to try. It looked\r\npretty dismal.” Trial counsel summarized the evidence against Hodges: Hodges made inculpatory\r\nstatements to police, prosecutors, the trial court, and television reporters; his fingerprints were at the scene\r\nof the crime; he had items from the victim’s house with him when he was arrested; Trina Brown gave a\r\nstatement implicating him; there were photos of Brown using the victim’s bank card; and Brown’s\r\nfingerprints were on the victim’s card.\r\n\r\n       The defense team talked to Hodges about the decision to plead guilty and reviewed the guilty plea\r\nform with him.      Hodges thanked his attorneys for their work and never complained about their\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n       If it were our task to determine whether trial counsel’s performance was deficient because they\r\nadvised Hodges to plead guilty, the decision would be a more difficult one. The ABA Guidelines at the time\r\nof the plea contemplated guilty pleas in capital cases only in exchange for a guarantee from the prosecution\r\nnot to seek the death penalty.       Here, no such exchange was made, and Hodges gained little—if\r\nanything—from his plea.\r\n\r\n       However, the “ABA Guidelines are not inexorable commands,” Post, 621 F.3d at 418 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted), and our task is not to determine whether trial counsel’s performance was\r\ndeficient. Rather, we must determine “whether there is any reasonable argument that counsel satisfied\r\n\f  No. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 21\r\n\r\n\r\nStrickland’s deferential standard.” Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788 (emphasis added). And here, as identified by\r\nthe Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals, there is a reasonable argument that counsel satisfied Strickland’s\r\ndeferential standard. Although not directly on point, the considerations in this case are similar to those\r\nfaced by this court in Post: “[C]ounsel were between a rock and a hard place in determining the best way\r\nto spare [the defendant] a death sentence, given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt, [and] his numerous\r\nconfessions.” 621 F.3d at 418. And in Post, we found that counsel’s actions were reasonable under a de\r\nnovo standard of review, id., which is far less stringent than the “doubly” deferential standard that we must\r\napply here, see Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788. Although there is some evidence that counsel here failed to\r\nappreciate fully the impact of their decision, that is not material to the issue before us: whether there is “any\r\nreasonable argument” that counsel’s recommendation to plead guilty satisfies Strickland. As the Supreme\r\nCourt has stated, “[C]ounsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor\r\nand his unwillingness to engage in a useless charade.” Nixon, 543 U.S. at 192.\r\n\r\n        Ultimately, the state court that addressed this issue concluded that, “[a]lthough defense counsel’s\r\nstrategy for avoiding the death penalty was thwarted, the decision to pursue that particular strategy cannot\r\nbe deemed incompetent.” Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20. Under the doubly deferential standard\r\nimposed by § 2254(d) and Strickland, we simply cannot say that conclusion is contrary to or involves an\r\nunreasonable application of federal law.\r\n\r\n        B.      Prejudice\r\n\r\n        Even if we did find that the state court’s decision on trial counsel’s performance was unreasonable,\r\nwe could not grant relief because Hodges has failed to establish prejudice. As noted above, to show\r\nprejudice in the guilty-plea context, a defendant “must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\r\nfor counsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and instead would have insisted on going to trial.”\r\nHill, 474 U.S. at 59.\r\n\r\n          Because the state courts found that trial counsel’s performance was not deficient, the state courts\r\n  did not address the prejudice prong of the Strickland inquiry. We have previously held that where a\r\n  state court addresses only the performance prong of the Strickland inquiry, this court will review the\r\n  prejudice prong de novo. See Morales v. Mitchell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1435226\"><a href=\"/opinion/1435226/morales-v-mitchell/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 935 (6th Cir. 2007). Despite the\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                      Hodges v. Colson                                                                    Page 22\r\n\r\n\r\nSupreme Court’s holding in Richter to the contrary, the Sixth Circuit has continued to review the\r\nprejudice prong de novo where, as here, the state court reviewed only the performance prong. See\r\nRayner v. Mills, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">631</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 636-639 (6th Cir. 2012).5 Thus, we apply de novo review to the\r\nprejudice prong here.\r\n\r\n       In Hill, 474 U.S. at 59, the Supreme Court held that in the context of a challenge to a guilty plea,\r\nto establish prejudice a defendant need only show that “there is a reasonable probability that, but for the\r\ncounsel’s errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.” The Court\r\nwent on to give two examples. First, it noted that where the alleged error involves failure to investigate\r\nor discover exculpatory information, “the determination of whether the error ‘prejudiced’ the defendant\r\n. . . will depend in large part on a prediction whether the evidence likely would have changed the\r\noutcome of a trial.” Id. Second, it noted that where the alleged error involves a failure to advise the\r\ndefendant of possible affirmative defenses, “the resolution of the ‘prejudice’ inquiry will depend largely\r\non whether the affirmative defense likely would have succeeded at trial.” Id. It is therefore clear that\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 5\r\n                     In Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 784, the Supreme Court stated,\r\n                 Where a state court’s decision is unaccompanied by an explanation, the habeas\r\n                 petitioner’s burden still must be met by showing there was no reasonable basis for the\r\n                 state court to deny relief. This is so whether or not the state court reveals which of the\r\n                 elements in a multipart claim it found insufficient, for § 2254(d) applies when a\r\n                 “claim,” not a component of one, has been adjudicated.\r\n        (emphasis added). Rayner places undue emphasis on the “unaccompanied by an explanation” language\r\n        of the first sentence’s opening clause, but disregards entirely the second sentence, which requires that the\r\n        habeas petitioner’s burden of showing that there was no reasonable basis for the state court’s denial of\r\n        relief applies “whether or not the state court reveals which of the elements of a multipart claim it found\r\n        insufficient. . . .” As the Court went on to say, “[w]hen a federal claim has been presented to a state court\r\n        and the state court has denied relief, it may be presumed that the state court adjudicated the claim on the\r\n        merits in the absence of any indication or state-law procedural principles to the contrary.” Richter at\r\n        784–85. Whether the decision is accompanied by an explanation or not accompanied by an explanation,\r\n        whether any provided explanation states which elements it found insufficient or not, the statute provides\r\n        an unequivocal rule: “§ 2254(d) applies when a ‘claim,’ not a component of one, has been adjudicated.”\r\n                  Rayner also leaves this court with the following peculiar rule: if the state court fails to given an\r\n        explanation as to either prong, then full AEDPA deference is due to both prongs; but if the state court\r\n        gives an explanation of one prong, then we do not give deference to the other. In other words, the more\r\n        information the state court provides, the less deference we grant it. This is contrary not only to the\r\n        language of the statute, which speaks of “claims” not components of claims, but also contrary to the spirit\r\n        of § 2254(d), which is designed to give more deference to a state court judgment on the merits.\r\n                  Moreover, as a matter of logic, a finding that counsel’s performance was not deficient implicitly,\r\n        but unequivocally, encompasses a finding that the performance did not prejudice the defendant. Indeed,\r\n        it would be nonsensical to argue that a performance deemed to be constitutionally sufficient nevertheless\r\n        prejudiced the defendant. It must be assumed that a state court’s decision that performance was not\r\n        deficient includes a decision that the performance was not prejudicial.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                   Hodges v. Colson                                                                    Page 23\r\n\r\n\r\nin determining whether a defendant has shown prejudice, a court must predict whether correction of the\r\ndeficient performance might have enabled the defendant to succeed at trial. “[T]hese predictions of the\r\noutcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be made objectively, without regard for the\r\nidiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.” Id. at 59–60.\r\n\r\n       This court has previously noted that “testimony, though self-serving, may be enough by itself\r\nto satisfy the prejudice prong.” Miller v. Straub, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778667\"><a href=\"/opinion/778667/cortez-miller-v-dennis-m-straub-warden-kermit-eldridge-haynes-v-luella/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581 (6th Cir. 2002). In Miller, the\r\ndefendants testified at a hearing that they entered their guilty pleas with hesitation and would not have\r\npled guilty but for counsel’s advice. Id. The court also noted that one of the defendants presented, in\r\nthe form of testimony from his trial counsel, “additional evidence that, with competent assistance, he\r\nwould have pled not guilty.” Id. at 582. Trial counsel testified that the defendant “pled guilty only\r\nreluctantly,” and the court concluded that “the fact that [trial counsel] had to prevail upon [the\r\ndefendant] to plead guilty tends to corroborate [the defendant’s] testimony that he would have pled not\r\nguilty.” Id. The court concluded that the defendants’ “testimony, along with reasonable inferences from\r\nthe facts and circumstances of this case,” established prejudice under Hill. Id. at 583.\r\n\r\n       In Hodges’s case, we cannot conclude that Hodges has established a reasonable probability that,\r\nbut for counsel’s advice, he would not have pled guilty. In fact, the only evidence concerning this issue\r\nappears in Hodges’s Verified Amended Petition for Post Conviction Relief filed on March 24, 1998.\r\nThere, notably, Hodges did not say that had he had better advice he would not have pled guilty. Rather,\r\nhis statement was:\r\n\r\n       Had trial counsel performed the above investigations and informed Petitioner of the\r\n       result of those investigations, and had counsel timely communicated with Petitioner and\r\n       given him the above advice, a reasonable probability exists that Petitioner would not\r\n       have pleaded guilty to all counts in the indictment, but, rather, would have insisted on\r\n       going to trial.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the document, Hodges’s signature appears, verifying that the “foregoing allegations of fact\r\nare true and correct to the best of [his] information and belief.”6\r\n\r\n\r\n                6\r\n                We note that the verification oath and signature is required of all post-conviction petitions filed\r\n       in Tennessee. See Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-204(e) (1997).\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 24\r\n\r\n\r\n        In contrast to the defendants in Miller, Hodges has never personally testified about his decision\r\nto plead guilty and whether he would have pled not guilty but for the advice of counsel. Moreover,\r\nunlike in Miller, where “reasonable inferences from the facts and circumstances” of the case suggested\r\nthat the defendants would not have pled guilty but for advice of counsel, no such inferences exist here.\r\nTo the contrary, any inferences that can be made make it clear that Hodges would have pled guilty\r\nregardless of what his counsel recommended. Leading up to trial, Hodges embraced his guilt. For\r\ninstance, against the advice of counsel, he participated in a pre-trial television series in which he gave\r\ninterviews “describing himself as a serial killer.” Hodges also implicated himself in letters to the court\r\nand prosecutor. Those simply are not the actions of a defendant hoping to avoid a guilty plea, nor do\r\nthey help establish a reasonable probability that Hodges would have pled not guilty if so advised by\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n        Furthermore, Hill instructs us to examine how competent counsel might have influenced the\r\noutcome of a hypothetical trial, see 474 U.S. at 59–60, and there is virtually no chance that Hodges\r\ncould have avoided convictions by proceeding to trial. As has been discussed repeatedly, the evidence\r\nagainst Hodges was overwhelming, and he only made the situation worse by corresponding with\r\nreporters, the court, and the prosecutor against the advice of his counsel. Similarly, we have no evidence\r\nor reason to believe that the penalty phase of trial would have proceeded differently had there first been\r\na full guilt phase.\r\n\r\n        A self-serving statement, couched in exactly the terms of the Supreme Court’s standard, and filed\r\nas a required part of Hodges’s verified petition for post-conviction relief, cannot establish a reasonable\r\nprobability that Hodges would have pled not guilty but for the advice of counsel, where all objective\r\nevidence points unequivocally to the contrary. Hodges is not entitled to relief on his claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel at the plea phase.\r\n\r\nIV.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel at Sentencing Phase & Incompetency at Trial\r\n\r\n        Hodges argues that the district court erred when it denied him an evidentiary hearing on his\r\nclaims that he was incompetent at trial and that his trial counsel were ineffective at sentencing. He also\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 25\r\n\r\n\r\nargues that the district court erred when it denied his competency and ineffective assistance of counsel\r\nclaims on the merits.\r\n\r\n        Hodges failed to present his claim of incompetency at trial to the state courts, and he no longer\r\nhas any state court remedies to exhaust. See Fletcher v. Tennessee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1060986\"><a href=\"/opinion/1060986/fletcher-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380–81 (Tenn.\r\n1997) (citing Tenn. Code Ann. § 40-30-217(a) (1996 Supp.)). The claim is therefore procedurally\r\ndefaulted.\r\n\r\n        Hodges argues that substantive competency claims cannot be procedurally defaulted, citing cases\r\nfrom the Tenth and Eleventh Circuits. See Battle v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1292</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1298 (11th Cir.\r\n2005); Walker v.

Wainwright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"453562\"><a href=\"/opinion/453562/aubrey-dennis-adams-v-louie-l-wainwright-and-jim-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1356</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\r\n1359 (11th Cir. 1985). However, neither the Supreme Court nor this court has adopted such a rule, and\r\nwe decline to do so here. As the Ninth Circuit noted in LaFlamme v. Hubbard, No. 97-16973, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">757525</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (9th Cir. Mar. 16, 2000), those courts that have held that substantive competency claims\r\ncannot be procedurally defaulted appear to have conflated the distinct concepts of waiver and procedural\r\ndefault. Although it is true that substantive competency claims cannot be waived, Pate v. Robinson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107184\"><a href=\"/opinion/107184/pate-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 384 (1966) (“it is contradictory to argue that a defendant may be incompetent, and yet\r\nknowingly or intelligently ‘waive’ his right to have the court determine his capacity to stand trial”), they\r\ncan be procedurally defaulted. We agree with the Ninth Circuit that, “unlike waiver, the procedural\r\ndefault rule does not rely on the petitioner’s voluntary abandonment of a known right, but only on the\r\nfact that the claim was rejected by the state court on independent and adequate state grounds.”\r\nLaFlamme, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">757525</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (internal quotation marks and formatting omitted). We hereby hold\r\nthat substantive competency claims are subject to the same rules of procedural default as all other claims\r\nthat may be presented on habeas.\r\n\r\n        Hodges also cannot rely on ineffective assistance of post-conviction counsel to excuse the\r\ndefault. Hodges did not default an ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim; he defaulted his claim\r\nthat he was not competent to stand trial. Accordingly, Martinez v. Ryan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"625711\"><a href=\"/opinion/625711/martinez-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1911</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013) are inapplicable and the Coleman rule still applies. Because\r\nHodges has not presented any evidence to justify review of his claim in order to prevent a fundamental\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                        Page 26\r\n\r\n\r\nmiscarriage of justice, see Carrier, 477 U.S. at 495–96, the substantive competency claim is barred, and\r\nwe will review the ineffective assistance claim only to the extent that it concerns failure to investigate\r\nand present additional mitigating evidence.\r\n\r\n       In his state post-conviction petition, Hodges claimed that trial counsel were ineffective for failing\r\nto investigate and present additional mitigating evidence. According to Hodges, his counsel should have\r\nobtained prison records that showed he told a doctor that he was raped as a boy and should have\r\ninterviewed additional people who were familiar with his background. Hodges also asserted that trial\r\ncounsel failed to investigate evidence concerning the causes, effects, and treatment of substance abuse;\r\nfailed to adequately prepare him for his testimony; and failed to make effective use of experts. Hodges\r\nrequested, and the trial court granted, $15,000 for mitigation investigation; but the trial court denied\r\nHodges’s request for additional funds to hire a drug and alcohol specialist, a mitigation specialist, and\r\na fingerprint expert. At the evidentiary hearing, the trial court heard testimony from Hodges’s trial\r\ncounsel, a clinical sociologist who helped prepare Hodges’s mitigation case, the Tennessee District\r\nPublic Defender’s Conference chief counsel, and a mitigation specialist retained for the post-conviction\r\nproceeding. Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *4–*12. The trial court denied Hodges’s petition.\r\n\r\n       The appellate court affirmed, finding that Hodges had not presented any evidence in post-\r\nconviction proceedings that was substantially different from the proof introduced at the penalty phase.\r\nId. at *27. The court found that the experts presented at the penalty phase, with one exception, were in\r\npossession of the same records about Hodges used by the post-conviction mitigation specialist, and that\r\nadditional evidence from further mitigation investigation would have been cumulative to the evidence\r\nobtained by trial counsel before sentencing. Id. It stated, “[g]iven the records presently before this\r\ncourt, we conclude that trial counsel adequately investigated the appellant’s background and presented\r\na case in mitigation that was supported by the information introduced.” Id. The appellate court also\r\nheld that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by denying Hodges the additional funds he requested\r\nbecause his post-conviction counsel were capable of presenting the available mitigation information\r\nwithout expert assistance. Id. at *29.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 27\r\n\r\n\r\n       A.      Evidentiary Hearing\r\n\r\n       “This court reviews a district court’s decision whether to hold an evidentiary hearing for an\r\nabuse of discretion.” Vroman v. Brigano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783847\"><a href=\"/opinion/783847/mark-vroman-v-anthony-brigano-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606 (6th Cir. 2003).\r\n\r\n       Generally, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(2) governs whether a district court should hold an evidentiary\r\nhearing in a habeas proceeding. Section 2254(e)(2) states that, with a few exceptions, “[i]f the applicant\r\nhas failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall not hold an\r\nevidentiary hearing on the claim.” Hodges does not argue that one of the exceptions applies; instead,\r\nhe argues that he did not fail to develop the factual basis of his claim and is therefore entitled to an\r\nevidentiary hearing.\r\n\r\n       We need not decide whether Hodges developed the factual basis of his claim in state court\r\nbecause the Supreme Court’s decision in Cullen v. Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213842\"><a href=\"/opinion/213842/cullen-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2011), prohibits us from\r\nconsidering new evidence in this case. The Court held that “review under § 2254(d)(1) is limited to the\r\nrecord that was before the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits.” Id. at 1398. It reasoned\r\nthat the language of the statute is “backward-looking” and “requires an examination of the state-court\r\ndecision at the time it was made. It follows that the record under review is limited to the record in\r\nexistence at that same time i.e., the record before the state court.” Id. The Court also noted that its\r\nholding did not “render[] § 2254(e)(2) superfluous” because it “continues to have force where\r\n§ 2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief.” Id. at 1400–01.\r\n\r\n       Hodges’s ineffective assistance claim was brought under § 2254(d)(1), and it was adjudicated\r\non the merits by the state courts. Pinholster therefore applies. It was a reasonable exercise of the\r\ndistrict court’s discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing on the claim, because any evidence introduced\r\nwould be “irrelevant” and “have no bearing on § 2254(d)(1) review” in any event. See id. at 1400.\r\n\r\n       B.      Ineffective Assistance\r\n\r\n       To prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing, Hodges must show\r\nboth that his counsel’s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the\r\ndefense. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687. With respect to performance, “counsel should be strongly\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                 Hodges v.

Ct. at 1403. An attorney’s failure to reasonably\r\ninvestigate the defendant’s background and present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can\r\nconstitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Wiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130159\"><a href=\"/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">510</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 521–22 (2003). However,\r\n“Strickland does not require counsel to investigate every conceivable line of mitigating evidence no\r\nmatter how unlikely the effort would be to assist the defendant at sentencing.” Id. at 533. The court\r\nmust consider not only the evidence known to counsel, but also whether that evidence “would lead a\r\nreasonable attorney to investigate further.” Id. at 527. “[I]f a habeas claim does not involve a failure\r\nto investigate but, rather, petitioner’s dissatisfaction with the degree of his attorney’s investigation, the\r\npresumption of reasonableness imposed by Strickland will be hard to overcome.” Campbell v. Coyle,\r\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774411\"><a href=\"/opinion/774411/jerome-campbell-v-ralph-coyle-warden/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 552 (6th Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). “[T]here is no prejudice when\r\nthe new mitigating evidence ‘would barely have altered the sentencing profile presented’ to the\r\ndecisionmaker.” Sears v. Upton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"149653\"><a href=\"/opinion/149653/sears-v-upton/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3266 (2010) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 700).\r\n\r\n        “Establishing that a state court’s application of Strickland was unreasonable under § 2254(d) is\r\nall the more difficult.” Richter, 131 S. Ct. at 788. “The standards created by Strickland and § 2254(d)\r\nare both highly deferential, and when the two apply in tandem, review is doubly so.” Id. (internal\r\nquotation marks and citations omitted). Therefore, “[w]hen § 2254(d) applies, the question is not\r\nwhether counsel’s actions were reasonable. The question is whether there is any reasonable argument\r\nthat counsel satisfied Strickland’s deferential standard.” Id.\r\n\r\n        The state court record supports the conclusion that Hodges’s trial counsel reasonably\r\ninvestigated Hodges’s background and presented mitigating evidence. The Tennessee Supreme Court\r\nsummarized the mitigation evidence presented at sentencing as follows:\r\n\r\n        In mitigation, the defendant testified and also presented the testimony of his mother, his\r\n        brothers and Dr. Barry Nurcombe, a child psychiatrist. This proof showed that the\r\n        defendant was the next to youngest of his mother’s five sons. His mother and father\r\n        were not married. His father was actually married to another woman, but engaged in\r\n        what one of the witnesses described as an “irregular union” with the defendant’s mother\r\n        for eighteen years. The defendant’s father abused the defendant’s mother and was strict\r\n        with the defendant’s brothers, three of whom were the children of another man. The\r\n        defendant, however, was his father’s favorite and was spoiled. Financial difficulties\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 29\r\n\r\n\r\n       forced the family to move about frequently, and defendant’s father supported the family\r\n       only sporadically.\r\n       The defense introduced proof to show that Hodges seemed normal until he was twelve\r\n       years old. At that time, he began to associate with older boys, sniff glue and gasoline,\r\n       be truant from school, and run away from home. He also engaged in sexual activities\r\n       with his younger brother and attempted sexual activities with a female cousin. He\r\n       became involved with the juvenile authorities and was confined to a juvenile facility in\r\n       Chattanooga.\r\n       Through his mitigation proof, the defendant attempted to establish that a catalyst and\r\n       major contributing cause of his delinquent and later criminal behavior was his rape and\r\n       sexual abuse by a stranger when he was twelve years old. According to the defendant,\r\n       he accepted a stranger’s offer of a ride home when he was playing a short distance from\r\n       his home on Fessler’s Lane in Nashville. Rather than driving Hodges home, the stranger\r\n       drove Hodges to his home and raped him. Fearing rejection by his homophobic father\r\n       and driven by guilt, the defendant told no one of this incident until he was arrested in\r\n       1990.\r\n       Dr. Nurcombe testified that, while the defendant suffered from an antisocial personality\r\n       disorder, low self-esteem, and substance (marijuana) abuse, the killing was motivated\r\n       by a subconscious desire for revenge for the sexual abuse inflicted on him when he was\r\n       twelve, coupled with Hodges’ fear that his family might discover that he was engaged\r\n       in homosexual prostitution since Brown had told Hodge’s [sic] sister-in-law shortly\r\n       before the killing that he was a homosexual prostitute. The defense also introduced\r\n       testimony that Brown dominated and manipulated the defendant.\r\n       In rebuttal the State called Dr. James Kyser, a forensic psychiatrist, and Dr. Leonard\r\n       Morgan, a clinical psychologist. Both had examined the defendant and concluded that\r\n       he suffered from an antisocial personality disorder. They described persons with this\r\n       disorder as having “no conscience,” being “self centered,” being “notoriously dishonest\r\n       and untruthful,” and having “very little regard for the feelings of others and . . . willing\r\n       to use any means to get what they want, no matter who it hurts.” While acknowledging\r\n       the complicated factors involved in antisocial personality disorders, the State’s experts\r\n       discounted the singular importance of the one incident of alleged sexual abuse in causing\r\n       the defendant’s actions. Dr. Morgan concluded that the defendant “was in complete\r\n       control of his behavior” and not suffering from mental illness or emotional disturbance.\r\n\r\nHodges, 944 S.W.2d at 350–51. Because Hodges alleges that his trial counsel’s mitigation case\r\noverlooked significant aspects of his background, the mitigation testimony merits more detailed\r\nattention.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 30\r\n\r\n\r\n       Dr. Nurcombe, head of child psychiatry at Vanderbilt Medical School, testified that he\r\nspecialized in juvenile delinquency and the effects of sexual abuse, and that he had examined at least\r\n500 children. To assess Hodges, Dr. Nurcombe reviewed his school records, legal records, mental\r\nhealth records, and the results of an investigation by a private investigation group concerning his family\r\nbackground. He also interviewed Hodges for a total of nine hours on three occasions, and had a one-\r\nhour phone interview with him. The mental health records available to Dr. Nurcombe included five\r\npsychological tests from the age of twelve to late adolescence. He found no evidence that Hodges was\r\ninsane, but he did say that Hodges was not mentally healthy. He also said that Hodges suffered from\r\nan antisocial personality disorder, low self-esteem, and substance abuse.\r\n\r\n       In addition to Dr. Nurcombe, Hodges’s counsel presented six other witnesses at sentencing:\r\nHodges’s mother, three of his brothers, a neighbor, and Hodges himself. The testimony generally\r\nshowed that Hodges had a difficult childhood in a low-income, dysfunctional family and that his\r\nbehavior significantly worsened at the age of twelve, around the time he claims to have been raped.\r\nHowever, Hodges himself admitted that his parents treated him well, and that his mother took him for\r\nmental health treatment many times.\r\n\r\n       At the state post-conviction proceeding, Hodges presented additional testimony. He presented\r\nthe testimony of his trial counsel, each of whom explained that they did not sufficiently prepare for the\r\nsentencing phase of trial. He also presented the evidence of Dr. Ann Charvet, a clinical sociologist, who\r\nexplained that she did not think the mitigation information she had compiled was used properly by the\r\ndefense team, but was unable to suggest any specific information that Dr. Nurcombe or other witnesses\r\nfailed to present to the jury. He presented the testimony of David Keefe, chief counsel of the Tennessee\r\nDistrict Public Defender’s Conference, who had reviewed Hodges’s counsel’s representation and\r\nconcluded that it was deficient. Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10. And he presented the evidence of\r\nmitigation specialist Julie Hackenmiller, who holds a masters degree in forensic psychology. She\r\ndiscussed mitigation themes that were not developed at trial.\r\n\r\n       Although the evidence presented at the post-conviction proceeding shows that trial counsel’s\r\nperformance was not perfect, in light of the substantial and competent evidence produced at the penalty\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 31\r\n\r\n\r\nphase of Hodges’s trial, Hodges has not shown that the Tennessee state court’s decision that trial\r\ncounsel’s performance was not deficient was unreasonable. The burden of proof is on Hodges,\r\nPinholster, 131 S. Ct. at 1398, and under the “doubly deferential” standards imposed by § 2254(d) and\r\nStrickland, id. at 1403, Hodges has not carried that burden. Here, Hodges’s counsel retained a\r\nmitigation specialist and several experts. Defense counsel obtained most of Hodges’s available school,\r\nmedical, and juvenile records. Dr. Nurcombe used those records and his interviews with Hodges to\r\ndiagnose him, testify at length about his background, and link his homosexual rape at age twelve and\r\nhis exposure as a homosexual prostitute to his crime. The testimony of Hodges’s family members was\r\nconsistent with Dr. Nurcombe’s testimony and conclusions. And in post-conviction proceedings,\r\nHodges identified little information not considered by Dr. Nurcombe.\r\n\r\n        The circumstances of this case are similar to those considered by the Supreme Court in Bobby\r\nv. Van Hook, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1758\"><a href=\"/opinion/1758/bobby-v-van-hook/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There, the petitioner claimed that his counsel were ineffective\r\nbecause their mitigation investigation was insufficient. Id. at 18. The Supreme Court disagreed, finding\r\nthat although the petitioner was tried less than three months after his indictment, trial counsel spoke with\r\nhis parents, an aunt, and a family friend; consulted with two expert witnesses; contacted the Veterans\r\nAdministration and sought medical records; and enlisted a mitigation specialist. Id. Trial counsel also\r\npresented evidence that the petitioner began drinking and using drugs as a child, witnessed his father\r\nabuse his mother, had violent fantasies, attempted suicide five times, suffered from borderline\r\npersonality disorder, consumed drugs and alcohol on the day of the crime, and may have been motivated\r\nby a “homosexual panic.” Id. at 18–19. The Supreme Court rejected the petitioner’s argument that his\r\ncounsel could have found more mitigating evidence by interviewing other members of his extended\r\nfamily and a psychiatrist who once treated his mother:\r\n\r\n        [T]here comes a point at which evidence from more distant relatives can reasonably be\r\n        expected to be only cumulative, and search for it distractive from more important\r\n        duties. . . .

As discussed by the\r\nmajority, the 1989 ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty\r\nCases,1 which were in effect at the time of Hodges’s 1992 trial, disapprove entering a guilty plea in a\r\ncapital case without the prosecution’s agreement not to seek the death penalty in exchange for the guilty\r\nplea. The Guidelines state that “[i]t is suggested that [pleading a client guilty and then putting on a\r\ncontested penalty hearing] is an effective strategy only when the attorney knows without any doubt that\r\nno death sentence will result.

Donald Dawson, one\r\nof Hodges’s trial attorneys, testified in the post-conviction proceeding in state trial court that the\r\ndecision to have Hodges plead guilty was made during the weekend prior to trial when the attorneys “sat\r\ndown and pretty much saw the guilt-innocence phase as hopeless.” J.A. at 1745. The attorneys were\r\n“trying to figure out what was the way to limit the jurors[’] bad feelings about us [a]nd [we] thought that\r\nby pleading guilty, we could give the defense some credibility.” Id. at 1746; see also id. (“[W]e\r\n[thought we] could get the jury to sort of be thankful to us that we didn’t make them sit through a guilt-\r\ninnocence phase and we wouldn’t lose our own credibility by arguing the guilt or innocence and we\r\nwould have a better chance to get a life verdict.”).\r\n\r\n       On its face, this appears to be the sort of strategic trial decision owed deference under Strickland.\r\nHowever, Dawson also testified that the defense team did “[n]ot adequately” think through the decision\r\nto plead guilty: “we never sat down and did an analysis of what are the benefits of going to trial, what\r\nare the deficits and where did that lead us.” Id. Dawson testified that at the time of trial, the defense\r\nteam had not read available literature setting out standards for adequate representation in capital cases.\r\nId. at 1747. In particular, the attorneys were unfamiliar with “the advantages of putting [on] a defense\r\n[in the guilt phase] consistent with your mitigation theory.” Id. They also failed to appreciate the\r\nadvantages of “hav[ing] the jury . . . have a chance to look at your client longer and find him guilty[,]\r\n[a]nd then decide [‘]now that we find him guilty, let’s see . . . [w]hat is the proper sentencing[’].” This\r\nwould allow the jury to not view the penalty phase as its only opportunity to pass judgment on the\r\ndefendant’s actions. Id. at 1748; see also id. at 1841–43 (post-conviction hearing testimony of Michael\r\nTerry). The attorneys conducted no legal research into proper considerations in deciding whether to\r\nplead guilty, and did not weigh the possible benefits of putting on a case at the guilt phase of trial. Id.\r\nat 1748–1751; see also id. at 1839 (testimony of Michael Terry).\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 36\r\n\r\n\r\n       Dawson also testified that nearly all of the evidence that he and the other attorneys hoped to keep\r\nout by pleading guilty came in anyway at the sentencing phase, as should have been clear from an\r\nanalysis of Tennessee law. Id. at 1752–53. Finally, Dawson stated that when he advised Hodges to\r\nplead guilty, the attorneys had “totally forgotten” about the third count of the indictment, aggravated\r\nrobbery, a conviction of which constituted an aggravating factor for purposes of the penalty phase. Id.\r\nat 1756–57. In fact, Dawson did not “recall having talked to Mr. Hodges at all about pleading to the\r\nrobbery.” Id. at 1757. Both Dawson and co-trial-counsel Michael Terry stated that pleading guilty was\r\na mistake. Id. at 1755, 1762–63, 1842. Terry stated that he “would not plead a capital defendant guilty\r\nagain in any case.” Id. at 1842.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, in the post-conviction hearing, the court heard testimony from David Keefe, chief\r\ncounsel for the capital division of the Tennessee District Public Defender’s Conference, who examined\r\nthe conduct of Hodges’s trial counsel at the request of Hodges’s post-conviction attorneys. Keefe\r\ntestified that he “believed the decision to plead guilty was wrong and hastily made. He opined that, by\r\npleading guilty, the defense team confused the jury and lost an array of appellate issues.” Hodges, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *10. Thus, although the decision to plead guilty was indeed a “strategic” decision\r\ndesigned to curry favor with the jury and limit the prosecution’s presentation of evidence, it was not\r\nintelligently made based on a weighing of the advantages and disadvantages of going to trial in the guilt\r\nphase, and was made without reference to secondary authorities providing standards for representation\r\nin death penalty cases. Further, the strategy was ill-designed to achieve one of its primary aims:\r\nlimiting presentation of damaging evidence about the crime. Therefore, advising Hodges to plead guilty\r\nwas inconsistent with the prevailing standard of competent representation in death penalty cases.\r\n\r\n       Post v. Bradshaw, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"175168\"><a href=\"/opinion/175168/post-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2010), discussed by the majority, is distinguishable.\r\nIn Post, the defendant “refused to plead guilty, despite the State’s offer of a life sentence in return for\r\na guilty plea.” Id. at 417. The case addressed the question whether the decision to enter a no-contest\r\nplea and to submit the penalty phase to a three-judge panel rather than a jury was objectively reasonable.\r\nThe court concluded that the defendant’s weak mitigation evidence made the attorneys’ decision to\r\nforgo the right to a penalty-phase jury reasonable. Id. The Post court thus stated that “Post’s counsel\r\nwere between a rock and a hard place in determining the best way to spare him a death sentence, given\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 37\r\n\r\n\r\nthe overwhelming evidence of his guilt, his numerous confessions, and his refusal to plead guilty.” Id.\r\nat 418. Although these considerations are similar to those facing Hodges’s attorneys, the Post decision\r\ndoes not suggest that defense counsel failed to appreciate the import of their decision. Indeed, the\r\nopinion indicates that counsel weighed the pros and cons of pleading no contest and putting the case\r\nbefore a three-judge panel instead of a jury. Id. Further, part of the rationale advanced by the Post court\r\nin justifying counsel’s decision was that “[b]y pleading no contest, [Post] would ‘avoid[ ] the ordeal’\r\nof a guilt phase and have his sentence ‘determined without the sentencing court hearing all of the\r\nadverse testimony that would be produced at trial.’” Id. at 417 (quoting ABA Standards for Criminal\r\nJustice 4–6.1 cmt. (2d ed. 1980) (“The Defense Function”) (emphasis and third bracket added by Post)).\r\nAlthough Hodges’s defense team intended their decision to plead guilty to have the same effect, in\r\nreality nearly all of the testimony that would have been introduced at trial was introduced during the\r\npenalty phase. The miscalculation was not a matter of a sound decision turning out to be a mistake in\r\nhindsight. Rather, the decision had no legal support and was clearly a mistake in the first place.\r\nHodges’s attorneys hoped that pleading guilty would be a beneficial strategy, but had little sound\r\nreasoning behind this belief. See Post, 621 F.3d at 428 (Cole, J., dissenting) (“I believe that the\r\nConstitution requires attorneys to make strategic judgments based on something more concrete than\r\nunsubstantiated hope, especially when their client’s life hangs in the balance.”).\r\n\r\n       Nixon is also distinguishable. In Nixon, defense counsel was faced with overwhelming evidence\r\nof Nixon’s guilt. After a failed attempt to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for the prosecutor\r\ndropping the death penalty, defense counsel “concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt,\r\nthereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.” Nixon, 543 U.S. at 181.\r\nInstead of advising his client to enter a guilty plea, however, defense counsel decided to proceed to the\r\nguilt phase of trial, but to concede Nixon’s guilt to the jury. In opening statement, defense counsel\r\n“acknowledged Nixon’s guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.” Id. at 182. The\r\nprosecution introduced extensive evidence of Nixon’s guilt during the guilt phase. Defense counsel\r\n“cross-examined [the prosecution’s] witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification,\r\n. . . and he did not present a defense case.” Id. at 183. He also objected to some evidence as unduly\r\nprejudicial. “In his closing argument, [defense counsel] again conceded Nixon’s guilt, and reminded\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                  Hodges v. Colson                                                         Page 38\r\n\r\n\r\nthe jury of the importance of the penalty phase.” Id. (internal citation omitted). The jury found Nixon\r\nguilty, and the case proceeded to the penalty phase, at which defense counsel presented testimony of a\r\nnumber of witnesses. Id. at 183–84. Importantly, “[t]he State presented little evidence during the\r\npenalty phase, simply incorporating its guilt-phase evidence by reference.” Id. at 184.\r\n\r\n         The Nixon Court did not address the issue presented here. In fact, counsel in Nixon did exactly\r\nwhat Hodges’s counsel now concede they should have done. In approving of Nixon’s attorney’s\r\nstrategic decision, the Court discussed the downside to pleading guilty in lieu of going to trial at the guilt\r\nphase:\r\n\r\n         As [defense counsel] determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the\r\n         prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.\r\n         See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death\r\n         Penalty Cases § 10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913,\r\n         1045 (2003) (“If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed\r\n         following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a\r\n         waiver of the client’s trial rights.”). Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it\r\n         increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during\r\n         the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors’\r\n         minds as they deliberate on the sentence. See [Gary] Goodpaster, [The Trial for Life:\r\n         Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases], 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 299, 331[,]\r\n         558–59, 560–61 [(1983)].\r\n\r\n543 U.S. at 191 n.6 (citation altered). Had Hodges’s counsel acted as Nixon’s did by proceeding to trial\r\nand acknowledging guilt rather than pleading guilty, there would have been no constitutionally deficient\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\n         Addressing Hodges’s Strickland claim, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals reasoned:\r\n\r\n         Although it is true that the appellant ultimately gained nothing by pleading guilty, the\r\n         record persuasively demonstrates that the appellant had little to gain by insisting upon\r\n         a trial. It is undisputed that the evidence against the appellant was overwhelming and\r\n         that his chances of acquittal were virtually non-existent. Indeed, in advising the\r\n         appellant, defense counsel was faced with two options: plead not guilty to the indictment\r\n         and face a full trial; or plead guilty to the indictment and face limited evidence in a\r\n         sentencing hearing with an opportunity to trade on his acceptance of his guilt and\r\n         remorse. Confronted with the overwhelming evidence of the appellant’s guilt, defense\r\n         counsel advised the appellant to plead guilty in the reasonable hope of obtaining leniency\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                Hodges v. Colson                                                      Page 39\r\n\r\n\r\n       during the sentencing phase. Defense counsel reasonably believed that the jury would\r\n       view the appellant’s guilty plea as an expression of remorse warranting a less severe\r\n       sentence than that imposed upon a defendant who protests his innocence in the face of\r\n       overwhelming evidence of guilt. Moreover, by pleading guilty, the appellant eliminated\r\n       the presentation to the jury of all of the evidence available to establish the appellant’s\r\n       guilt of the murder. The hard callous facts behind the offenses, in essence, were\r\n       desensitized by avoiding the guilt phase. The absence of an in-depth recitation of facts\r\n       enabled the appellant to seek some sympathy from the jury in the face of mitigating\r\n       evidence.\r\n\r\nHodges v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1562865</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *20 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2000). The court reasonably pointed to\r\nHodges’s counsels’ “hope of obtaining leniency during the sentencing phase” as a legitimate\r\njustification for pleading guilty. Id. However, the other reasons advanced in support of counsels’\r\ndecision lack support in the record. Most of the evidence of the circumstances of the murder was\r\nallowed in the penalty phase, and the “hard callous facts behind the offense” were not “desensitized by\r\navoiding the guilt phase.” Rather, those newly-presented facts were fresh in jurors’ minds when they\r\ndeliberated over imposition of the death penalty. As Gary Goodpaster observed:\r\n\r\n       [G]oing through a guilt phase trial helps to segregate and distance from the sentencer the\r\n       prosecution’s strongest case against the defendant. Were defendant simply to admit guilt\r\n       and go straight to the penalty phase trial, the prosecution at that time would undoubtedly\r\n       present much of what it otherwise would have presented during the guilt phase.\r\n\r\nGoodpaster, 58 N.Y.U. L. Rev. at 331. Hodges’s counsel did not consider the ramifications of pleading\r\nguilty rather than proceeding to the guilt phase of the trial. Much of the evidence they hoped to exclude\r\nwas admissible under Tennessee law. Counsel admitted forgetting about the aggravated robbery charge,\r\nitself an aggravating factor once Hodges pleaded guilty. Although I am mindful of the deference due\r\nto the state court under AEDPA, I must conclude that the decision that counsel met minimum\r\nconstitutional standards involved an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                     Hodges v. Colson                                                                      Page 40\r\n\r\n\r\n        B. Prejudice\r\n\r\n        In order to demonstrate prejudice, “the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability\r\nthat, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to\r\ntrial.” Hill v. Lockhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111539\"><a href=\"/opinion/111539/hill-v-lockhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (1985).2\r\n\r\n        The majority is correct that Hodges himself has never stated that, but for his counsel’s deficient\r\nadvice, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. Additionally,\r\nHodges’s habeas petition alleged that counsel’s advice to plead guilty constituted ineffective assistance,\r\nbut did not specifically state that, had counsel advised him otherwise, he would not have pleaded guilty.\r\nHodges’s brief on appeal states simply that “where Mr. Hodges had nothing to gain by pleading guilty,\r\nhe certainly would not have entered a guilty plea if his lawyers had given him accurate information –\r\nin fact, had Mr. Hodges’s lawyers done their research, they wouldn’t have advised Mr. Hodges to plead\r\nguilty at all.” (Opening Br. of Appellant 83.) However, this is not the typical guilty plea case.\r\n\r\n        As the majority correctly notes, Hodges was not protesting his innocence leading up to trial.\r\nRather, he had admitted his guilt in one or more television interviews and in letters to the prosecution\r\nand the trial court (against the advice of counsel). See J.A. at 1704, 1786 (testimony of Donald\r\nDawson). This certainly suggests that Hodges was ready to plead guilty, and that he would have been\r\nconvicted had he pleaded not guilty. That, however, does not settle the issue. The issue here is not\r\nwhether counsel were competent in their assessment and advice regarding the likelihood of conviction\r\nat trial, but rather in advising that there were significant benefits to forgoing trial.

United\r\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782125\"><a href=\"/opinion/782125/phillip-griffin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (6th Cir. 2003) (noting that it is “easier to show prejudice in the guilty plea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 2\r\n                  I do not join in the majority’s characterization of Rayner v.

In Wiggins, the Supreme Court stated that its “review [was] not\r\n        circumscribed by a state court conclusion with respect to prejudice, as neither of the state courts below\r\n        reached this prong of the Strickland analysis.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534; see Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 390\r\n        (“Because the state courts found the representation adequate, they never reached the issue of prejudice, . . .\r\n        and so we examine this element of the Strickland claim de novo[.]”). Although there is obvious tension\r\n        between Wiggins, Rompilla, and Richter, the panel’s opinion in Rayner resolved this tension, see Rayner,\r\n        685 F.3d 638–39, and its decision is consistent with decisions of our sister circuits. See Ferrell v. Hall, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span>\r\n        <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1199</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1224 (11th Cir. 2011); Sussman v.

Colson                                                      Page 41\r\n\r\n\r\ncontext” than in other contexts “because the claimant need only show a reasonable probability that he\r\nwould have pleaded differently”).\r\n\r\n       In Hill, the Court stated that “where the alleged error of counsel is a failure to investigate or\r\ndiscover potentially exculpatory evidence, the determination whether the error ‘prejudiced’ the\r\ndefendant by causing him to plead guilty rather than go to trial will depend on the likelihood that\r\ndiscovery of the evidence would have led counsel to change his recommendation as to the plea.” 474\r\nU.S. at 59. Hodges’s claim here is not that counsel failed to investigate or discover potentially\r\nexculpatory evidence that would have led him to change his plea, so this language from Hill is not\r\nsquarely on point. Hodges’s claim is, however, that counsel failed to adequately consider the benefits\r\nof going to trial, and based their decision to advise him to plead guilty on an erroneous understanding\r\nof the consequences of a guilty plea at sentencing and insufficient legal research and investigation into\r\nthe proper conduct of a capital case. This parallels the reasoning of Hill. Hodges’s two primary trial\r\nattorneys both testified that had they been aware of the proper standards for death penalty representation\r\nand had they accurately considered the drawbacks to pleading guilty, they would have advised Hodges\r\nto go to trial. J.A. at 1755, 1842. Thus, there is compelling evidence that counsel would have “changed\r\n[their] recommendation as to the plea.” Hill, 474 U.S. at 59.\r\n\r\n       The ultimate question under Strickland and Hill is whether the defendant has “established the\r\nreasonable probability that he would not have entered his plea but for his counsel’s deficiency.” Premo\r\nv. Moore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182991\"><a href=\"/opinion/182991/premo-v-moore/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744 (2011) (emphasis added). Although Hodges has not stated under oath that\r\nhe would not have pleaded guilty if his counsel had advised against it, counsel’s testimony that they\r\nwould have advised him against pleading guilty establishes the requisite “reasonable probability” of a\r\ndifferent outcome. This is not a case where the decision to plead guilty or not guilty was based on the\r\nlikelihood of conviction versus acquittal. Rather, the choice was made on the likely effect of the choice\r\non the outcome of the penalty phase, and it is clear that counsel’s advice in this regard was\r\nconstitutionally ineffective. Had Hodges’s counsel advised him to plead not guilty, there is no reason\r\nto think he would not have heeded their advice. His conduct during the penalty phase, including taking\r\nthe stand to provide testimony about his background in order to establish mitigating factors,\r\ndemonstrates that he preferred a sentence of life imprisonment over death. Had his counsel informed\r\n\fNo. 09-5021                 Hodges v. Colson                                                       Page 42\r\n\r\n\r\nhim that the better strategy for achieving this outcome was to plead not guilty and go to trial in the guilt\r\nphase, there is more than a reasonable probability that Hodges would have taken their advice.\r\n\r\n         In sum, although the Supreme Court recently cautioned that “hindsight cannot suffice for relief\r\nwhen counsel’s choices [to advise the defendant to plead guilty] were reasonable and legitimate based\r\non predictions of how the trial would proceed,” and that “[t]here is a most substantial burden on the\r\nclaimant to show ineffective assistance” in that situation, Premo, 131 S. Ct. at 745, counsels’ choices\r\nhere were based on unreasonable predictions about how the penalty phase would proceed, particularly\r\nabout how pleading guilty would affect the prosecution’s ability to present damaging evidence about\r\nthe details of the crime, and a complete failure to consider the benefits of going through the guilt phase.\r\nFurther, Hodges has made an adequate showing of prejudice.\r\n\r\n         Because I conclude that the state court unreasonably applied Strickland, I respectfully dissent\r\nfrom Part III of the majority’s opinion and would grant Hodges’s petition for habeas corpus on this\r\nissue.\r\n\f</pre>",
