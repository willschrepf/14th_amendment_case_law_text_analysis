Proposal 2 is a successful voter-initiated amendment to\nthe Michigan Constitution. In relevant part, it prohibits Michigan’s public colleges and\nuniversities from granting “preferential treatment to[] any individual or group on the\nbasis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin.” Mich. Const. art. I, § 26. Our task\nis to determine whether Proposal 2 is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fortunately, the slate\nis not blank. The Supreme Court has twice held that equal protection does not permit\nthe kind of political restructuring that Proposal 2 effected. See Washington v. Seattle\nSch. Dist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457 (1982); Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385 (1969).\nApplying Hunter and Seattle, we find that Proposal 2 unconstitutionally alters\nMichigan’s political structure by impermissibly burdening racial minorities.\nAccordingly, we REVERSE the district court’s grant of summary judgment for the\nDefendants-Appellees and order the court to enter summary judgment in favor of the\nPlaintiffs-Appellants. Also, we AFFIRM the district court’s decision granting the\nCantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as to Eric Russell, and AFFIRM the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/         Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 4\n1534; 09-1111              Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndistrict court’s decision denying the University Defendants’ motion to be dismissed as\nparties.\n\n                                    I. BACKGROUND\n\n           A. Factual Background\n\n           These appeals are the latest chapter in the battle over the use of race-conscious\nadmissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities. This saga began\nduring the 1960s and 1970s, when African-American and other minority students and\ncitizens first successfully lobbied for the adoption of these policies. The policies\nremained largely in place until challenges to them in the late 1990s, culminating in the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003), and Grutter v.\nBollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003), which held that “universities cannot establish quotas for\nmembers of certain racial groups” or treat their applications uniquely. Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 334. But the universities may “consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a ‘plus’\nfactor in the context of individualized consideration,” along with other relevant factors.\nId.\n\n           Following these decisions, Ward Connerly, a former University of California\nRegent who had championed a proposition in California similar to the one at issue here,\nand Jennifer Gratz, the lead plaintiff in Gratz, mobilized to place on Michigan’s\nNovember 2006 statewide ballot a proposal to amend the Michigan Constitution “to\nprohibit all sex- and race-based preferences in public education, public employment, and\npublic contracting.” Operation King’s Dream v. Connerly, 501 F.3d 584, 586 (6th Cir.\n2007). The initiative—officially designated Proposal 06-2 but commonly known as\n“Proposal 2”—was characterized as a proposal “to amend the State Constitution to ban\naffirmative action programs.” See Notice of State Proposals for November 7, 2006\nGeneral Election, http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ED-138_State_Prop_11-\n06_174276_7.pdf, at 5 (last visited June 24, 2011). Though Proposal 2 “found its way\non the ballot through methods that undermine[d] the integrity and fairness of our\ndemocratic processes,” Operation King’s Dream, 501 F.3d at 591, once there it garnered\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/        Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                Page 5\n1534; 09-1111             Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nenough support among Michigan voters to pass, on November 7, 2006, by a margin of\n58% to 42%, see Mich. Dep’t of State, 2006 Official Michigan General Election Results,\nhttp://miboecfr.nicusa.com/election/results/06GEN/90000002.html (last visited June 24,\n2011).\n\n         Proposal 2 amended the Michigan Constitution by adding the following pertinent\nprovisions to Article I—titled “Affirmative action”:\n\n         (1) The University of Michigan, Michigan State University, Wayne State\n         University, and any other public college or university, community\n         college, or school district shall not discriminate against, or grant\n         preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race,\n         sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public\n         employment, public education or public contracting.\n         (2) The state shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential\n         treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color,\n         ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment,\n         public education, or public contracting.\n         (3) For the purposes of this section “state” includes, but is not necessarily\n         limited to, the state itself, any city, county, any public college, university,\n         or community college, school district, or other political subdivision or\n         governmental instrumentality of or within the State of Michigan not\n         included in sub-section 1.\n\nMich. Const. art. I, § 26. It took effect in December 2006 and wrought two significant\nchanges to the admissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities. First,\nit forced them to modify the policies they had in place for nearly a half-century to\nremove consideration of “race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin” in admissions\ndecisions. No other admissions criteria—for example, grades, athletic ability, or family\nalumni connections—suffered the same fate. Second, Proposal 2 entrenched this\nprohibition at the state constitutional level, thus preventing the public colleges and\nuniversities or their boards from revisiting this issue without repeal or modification of\nProposal 2. We review these changes later in greater detail, and there discuss their\nsignificance.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

On\nNovember 8, 2006, the day after Proposal 2’s approval, a collection of interest groups\nand individuals, including the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and\nImmigration Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (“Coalition\nPlaintiffs”), filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan. They named as defendants then-Governor Jennifer Granholm, the Regents\nof the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, and\nthe Board of Governors of Wayne State University (“University Defendants”) and\nalleged that the provisions of Proposal 2 affecting public colleges and universities\nviolated the United States Constitution and federal statutory law. About one month later,\nthe Michigan Attorney General (“Attorney General”) filed a motion to intervene as a\ndefendant; the court granted his motion the same day.\n\n        On December 19, 2006, a group of faculty members and prospective and current\nstudents at the University of Michigan (“the Cantrell Plaintiffs”) filed a similar suit in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against then\nGovernor Granholm. Eric Russell, then an applicant to the University of Michigan Law\nSchool, and Toward A Fair Michigan (“TAFM”), a non-profit corporation formed to\nensure implementation of Proposal 2, intervened in the litigation as defendants soon\nthereafter. The district court consolidated the two cases on January 5, 2007, and the\nAttorney General was permitted to intervene in the Cantrell lawsuit as part of the\nconsolidation order. Because the Attorney General effectively replaced then-Governor\nGranholm as the representative of Michigan in this litigation, both Plaintiffs’ groups\nlater stipulated to her dismissal as a party.\n\n        On December 19, 2006, the district court issued what was, in effect, a\npreliminary injunction, postponing application of Proposal 2 to the universities’\nadmissions and financial-aid policies until July 1, 2007, the conclusion of the 2006-2007\nadmissions and financial-aid cycle. The district court’s order stemmed from a stipulation\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 7\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\namong the University Defendants, Coalition Plaintiffs, Granholm, and the Attorney\nGeneral consenting to the injunction. (Amended Order Granting Temporary Injunction\nand Dismissing Cross-Claim, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 39 (“Coal. I”).) Russell and TAFM,\nwhile awaiting approval as intervenors, opposed the Attorney General’s stipulation and\nsought a stay of the injunction from the district court. When two days had passed\nwithout a ruling on their motions, Russell and TAFM filed with us an “Emergency\nMotion for a Stay Pending Appeal.” We granted their motion. Coal. to Defend\nAffirmative Action v. Granholm (Coal. II), 473 F.3d 237, 252 (6th Cir. 2006),\napplication to vacate stay denied, 549 U.S. 1176 (2007). Meanwhile, we approved the\ndistrict court’s decision to allow solely Russell and TAFM to intervene in the Proposal\n2 litigation. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm (Coal. III), 501 F.3d 775\n(6th Cir. 2007).\n\n        On October 5, 2007, the Cantrell Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment\nas to intervening defendant Russell, arguing that he should be dismissed from the\nlitigation because he no longer represented an interest distinct from that of the Attorney\nGeneral. On October 17, 2007, the University Defendants filed a motion asking to be\ndismissed as parties. On November 30, 2007, the Attorney General filed a motion to\ndismiss for lack of standing or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment on the\nmerits as to all Plaintiffs. Russell and the Cantrell Plaintiffs likewise filed motions for\nsummary judgment the same day. On March 18, 2008, the district court issued two\norders addressing these motions.\n\n       In the first order, the court denied the University Defendants’ request to be\ndismissed as parties and the Cantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and\ngranted the Attorney General’s motion for summary judgment, rejecting the Plaintiffs’\narguments that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v.\nRegents of the Univ. of Mich. (Coal. IV), 539 F. Supp. 2d 924, 950-58 (E.D. Mich.\n2008). In the second order, the court granted the Cantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary\njudgment, dismissing Russell as an intervenor. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 8\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nRegents of the Univ. of Mich. (Coal. V), 539 F. Supp. 2d 960 (E.D. Mich. 2008). The\nCantrell Plaintiffs subsequently moved the court to reconsider the first order, but the\ncourt denied the motion. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action v. Regents of the Univ. of\nMich. (Coal. VI), 592 F. Supp. 2d 948 (E.D. Mich. 2008).\n\n       These appeals followed. The University Defendants appeal the court’s denial of\ntheir motion to be dismissed as parties. Russell appeals the court’s grant of the Cantrell\nPlaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment dismissing him as a party to the action. The\nCantrell Plaintiffs appeal the court’s grant of the Attorney General’s motion for\nsummary judgment and its denial of their motion for reconsideration. Similarly, the\nCoalition Plaintiffs appeal the court’s grant of the Attorney General’s motion for\nsummary judgment.\n\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n\n       A. Proposal 2’s Constitutionality\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause provides that no state shall “deny to any person . . .\nthe equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Plaintiffs argue that\nProposal 2 violates this provision in two distinct ways. Both Plaintiffs groups argue that\nProposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause by impermissibly restructuring the\npolitical process along racial lines (the “political process” argument), and the Coalition\nPlaintiffs contend that Proposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause also by\nimpermissibly classifying individuals on the basis of race (the “traditional” argument).\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment and denial of\na motion for reconsideration of that decision. Chen v. Dow Chem. Co., 580 F.3d 394,\n400 (6th Cir. 2009); Cockrel v. Shelby Cnty. Sch. Dist., 270 F.3d 1036, 1047 (6th Cir.\n2001). Whether a state’s constitution violates the federal constitution is a question of\nlaw, which we also review de novo. Cherry Hill Vineyards, LLC v. Lilly, 553 F.3d 423,\n431 (6th Cir. 2008).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/            Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                         Page 9\n1534; 09-1111                 Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                   1. “Political Process” Equal Protection Analysis\n\n         The Equal Protection Clause “guarantees racial minorities the right to full\nparticipation in the political life of the community. It is beyond dispute . . . that given\nracial or ethnic groups may not be denied the franchise, or precluded from entering into\nthe political process in a reliable and meaningful manner.”1 Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467.\nBut the Equal Protection Clause reaches even further, and prohibits “a political structure\nthat treats all individuals as equals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in\nsuch a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve\nbeneficial legislation.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “[T]he State\nmay no more disadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult to enact\nlegislation in its behalf than it may dilute any person’s vote or give any group a smaller\nrepresentation than another of comparable size.” Hunter, 393 U.S. at 393.\n\n         The Supreme Court’s statements in Hunter and Seattle clarify that equal\nprotection of the laws is more than a guarantee of equal treatment under the law\nsubstantively. It is also an assurance that the majority may not manipulate the channels\nof change in a manner that places unique burdens on issues of importance to racial\nminorities. In effect, the political process theory hews to the unremarkable belief that,\nwhen two competitors are running a race, one may not require the other to run twice as\nfar, or to scale obstacles not present in the first runner’s course. Ensuring the fairness\n\n\n         1\n           For this reason, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that legislative enactments that burden\nracial minorities’ ability to participate in the political process may violate the Constitution. See, e.g., White\nv. Regester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973) (invalidating “multimember” electoral districts that minimized the voting\nstrength of resident Mexican-Americans); Harman v. Forssenius, 380 U.S. 528 (1965) (holding\nunconstitutional a statute that required voters either to file an annual certificate of residence or pay a poll\ntax “born of a desire to disenfranchise the Negro”); Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339 (1960) (holding\nthat political redistricting that redefined municipal borders to exclude black residents would violate the\nEqual Protection Clause); Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944) (requiring the state Democratic party\nto admit black members in order that they be allowed to vote in the party primary election); Lane v. Wilson,\n307 U.S. 268 (1939) (holding unconstitutional a statute having the effect of requiring all black citizens to\napply for voting registration within a ten-day period or be forever barred from registering, but subjecting\nvirtually no white citizens to the same requirement); Nixon v. Herendon, 273 U.S. 536 (1927) (holding\nunconstitutional a statute prohibiting black citizens from participating in primary elections for the state\nDemocratic Party); Guinn v. United States, 238 U.S. 347 (1915) (holding unconstitutional a statute having\nthe effect of subjecting all black citizens, but virtually no white citizens, to a literacy test in order to vote\nin state elections). In all these cases, the Court invalidated procedural hurdles that impeded racial\nminorities’ political participation by either making it more difficult for these minorities to vote or diluting\ntheir voting power.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 10\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nof political processes, in particular, is essential, because an electoral minority is by\ndefinition disadvantaged in its attempts to pass legislation; and “discrete and insular\nminorities” are especially so given the unique hurdles they face. Cf. United States v.\nCarolene Prods. Co., 304 U.S. 144, 152 n.4 (1938).\n\n        Ensuring a fair political process is nowhere more important than in education.\nEducation is the bedrock of equal opportunity and “the very foundation of good\ncitizenship.” Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954). Safeguarding the\nguarantee “that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American\nsociety, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government\nobjective.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 331-32 (quoting Br. for United States as Amicus Curiae\n13).   “Moreover, universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training\nground for a large number of our Nation’s leaders. . . . [T]o cultivate a set of leaders with\nlegitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be\nvisibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity.” Id. at 332\n(citation omitted). Therefore, in the context of education, we must apply the “political\nprocess” protection with the utmost rigor given the high stakes.\n\n        Of course, the Constitution does not protect minorities from political defeat:\nPolitics necessarily produces winners and losers. We must therefore have some way to\ndifferentiate between the constitutional and the impermissible. And Hunter and Seattle\ndo just that. They provide the benchmark for when the majority has not only won, but\nalso rigged the game to reproduce its success indefinitely.\n\n                        i. Hunter and Seattle\n\n                                a. Hunter\n\n        The Supreme Court in Hunter addressed a situation where the citizens of Akron,\nOhio overturned a fair housing ordinance enacted by the City Council. 393 U.S. at 386.\nThe citizenry did more than merely repeal the ordinance, however. It amended the city\ncharter through a referendum to require the approval of a majority of the electorate\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 11\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nbefore any ordinance regulating real estate “on the basis of race, color, religion, national\norigin or ancestry”—past or future—could become effective. Id. at 387, 390 n.6. In\nother words, only ordinances based on the identified factors required approval of the\nmajority; ordinances based on any other factor required only a vote by the City Council:\n\n        In essence, the amendment changed the requirements for the adoption of\n        one type of local legislation: to enact an ordinance barring housing\n        discrimination on the basis of race or religion, proponents had to obtain\n        the approval of the City Council and of a majority of the voters citywide.\n        To enact an ordinance preventing housing discrimination on other\n        grounds, or to enact any other type of housing ordinance, proponents\n        needed the support of only the City Council.\n\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 468 (describing Hunter). The effect was not only to halt operation\nof the existing fair housing ordinance, but also to erect a barrier to any similar ordinance\nin the future. Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389.\n\n        The Court found that the disparity between the process for enacting a future fair\nhousing ordinance and that for enacting any other housing ordinance “place[d] special\nburden[s] on racial minorities within the governmental process” by making it\n“substantially more difficult to secure enactment” only of legislation that would be to\ntheir benefit. Id. at 390-91. While the enactment treated “Negro and white, Jew and\ngentile” in an identical manner, the Court found that “the reality is that the law’s impact\nfalls on the minority.” Id. at 391. That the law had been enacted via a popular\nreferendum did not save it from implementing “a real, substantial, and invidious denial\nof the equal protection of the laws.” Id. at 392-93.\n\n                                b. Seattle\n\n        In Seattle, a case identical in many respects to the one we confront here, the\nSupreme Court applied Hunter to strike down a state statute, also enacted via a\nreferendum, that prohibited racially integrative busing. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 487. Prior\nto the referendum, Seattle School District No. 1 (“District”) had implemented a school\ndesegregation plan—making extensive use of mandatory reassignments—to accelerate\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 12\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nits program of desegregation. Id. at 460-61. The District was under no obligation to\nadopt this plan: Following Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), and 349\nU.S. 294 (1955), school boards had been “charged with the affirmative duty to take\nwhatever steps might be necessary” to integrate schools that were unconstitutionally\nsegregated because of racial discrimination, Green v. Cnty. Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 437-\n38 (1968), but there had been no finding that the de facto segregation in Seattle’s schools\nwas the product of discrimination. Nonetheless, the school board implemented the plan\nto accelerate its existing program of voluntary busing, which some constituencies saw\nas insufficiently alleviating racial imbalances. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 460.\n\n        In response, Seattle residents drafted a statewide measure, Initiative 350,\nproviding in relevant part that “no school board . . . shall directly or indirectly require\nany student to attend a school other than the school which is geographically nearest or\nnext nearest the student’s place of residence.” Id. at 462 (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation mark omitted). Though the initiative was worded as a general ban on all forms\nof mandatory busing, its myriad exceptions made its real effect to eliminate school\nreassignments for racial purposes only, except where a court ordered such reassignments\nto remedy unconstitutional segregation. Id. at 462-63 (noting that Initiative 350 was\nphrased so as not to “prevent any court of competent jurisdiction from adjudicating\nconstitutional issues relating to the public schools”). Initiative 350 made it on the\nWashington ballot and passed by a substantial margin, attracting over 65% of the\nstatewide vote. Id. at 463.\n\n        The Court found that Initiative 350, like the Akron city charter amendment,\nviolated the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at 487. Relying on Hunter and the Court’s\nsummary affirmance of Lee v. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. 710 (W.D.N.Y. 1970) (three-judge\npanel), aff’d, 402 U.S. 935 (1971), the Court stated that these two cases yielded a\n“simple but central principle”: While “laws structuring political institutions or allocating\npolitical power according to neutral principles” are not subject to challenges under the\nFourteenth Amendment, “a different analysis is required when the State allocates\ngovernmental power nonneutrally, by explicitly using the racial nature of a decision to\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/        Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.            Page 13\n1534; 09-1111             Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndetermine the decisionmaking process.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 469-70 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Echoing Hunter, the Court explained that this distinct analysis is\nnecessary because such non-neutral allocations of power “place[] special burdens on\nracial minorities within the governmental process, thereby making it more difficult for\ncertain racial and religious minorities than for other members of the community to\nachieve legislation that is in their interest.” Id. at 470 (internal quotation marks, citations,\nand brackets omitted).\n\n        The Court dismissed the argument that Initiative 350 was not intended to prevent\nbusing for racially-integrative purposes, and explained why Initiative 350 violated the\n“simple but central” principle animating Hunter and Nyquist. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 471.\n\n        First, as a threshold matter, the Court concluded that desegregation of the public\nschools, like the fair housing ordinance in Hunter, “at bottom inures primarily to the\nbenefit of the minority, and is designed for that purpose.” Id. at 472. The Court\nreasoned that, while “white as well as Negro children benefit from exposure to ethnic\nand racial diversity in the classroom,” desegregation is of primary benefit to minority\nchildren because these children “can achieve their full measure of success only if they\nlearn to function in—and are fully accepted by—the larger community. Attending an\nethnically diverse school may help accomplish this goal by preparing minority children\nfor citizenship in our pluralistic society.” Id. at 472-73 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Because racial minorities therefore had reason to “consider busing for\nintegration to be ‘legislation that is in their interest,’” the “racial focus of Initiative 350\n. . . suffices to trigger application of the Hunter doctrine.” Id. at 474 (quoting Hunter,\n393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\n        Second, having concluded that Initiative 350 targeted a busing program that\n“inures primarily to the benefit of the minority,” the Court held that “the practical effect\nof Initiative 350 is to work a reallocation of power of the kind condemned in Hunter.”\nId. As the Court explained, Initiative 350, like the amendment to the city charter in\nHunter, did more than repeal the school board’s busing program:\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 14\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       The initiative removes the authority to address a racial problem—and\n       only a racial problem—from the existing decisionmaking body, in such\n       a way as to burden minority interests. Those favoring the elimination of\n       de facto school segregation now must seek relief from the state\n       legislature, or from the statewide electorate. Yet authority over all other\n       student assignment decisions, as well as over most other areas of\n       educational policy, remains vested in the local school board. . . . As in\n       Hunter, then, the community’s political mechanisms are modified to\n       place effective decisionmaking authority over a racial issue at a different\n       level of government.\n\nId. By removing authority over busing for racial purposes from the school board and\nplacing this authority at a more remote level of government, Initiative 350 required\n“those championing school integration to surmount a considerably higher hurdle than\npersons seeking comparable legislative action,” and disadvantaged “those who would\nbenefit from laws barring de facto desegregation.” Id. at 474-75 (internal quotation mark\nomitted). Accordingly, the Court held that Initiative 350, in placing “special burdens on\nracial minorities,” violated the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at 470.\n\n       In sum, Hunter and Seattle require us to apply strict scrutiny to enactments that\nchange the governmental decisionmaking process for determinations with a racial focus.\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 470; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391; cf. Carolene Prods., 304 U.S. at 153\nn.4 (arguing that more exacting judicial scrutiny is required when the majority curtails\n“the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect\nminorities”).\n\n                       ii. Application of the Hunter/Seattle Test\n\n       Hunter and Seattle thus expounded the rule that an enactment deprives minority\ngroups of equal protection of the laws when it: (1) has a racial focus, targeting a goal or\nprogram that “inures primarily to the benefit of the minority”; and (2) works a\nreallocation of political power or reordering of the decisionmaking process that places\n“special burdens” on a minority group’s ability to achieve its goals through that process.\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 470; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 15\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        Applying this rule here, we conclude that Proposal 2 targets a program that\n“inures primarily to the benefit of the minority” and reorders the political process in\nMichigan in such a way as to place “special burdens” on racial minorities.\n\n                                a. Racial Focus\n\n        The first prong of the Hunter/Seattle test requires us to determine whether\nProposal 2 has a “racial focus.” See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 473. The Court explained that\nthe question is not whether “members of the racial majority both favored and benefited\nfrom” the program or policy at issue, but whether the policy targeted by the law “at\nbottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and is designed for that purpose.”\nId. at 472.\n\n        In Seattle, the Court observed that programs—in that context, the busing of\nchildren to increase the number of integrated schools—furthering the education of\nminority children enable them “to function in—and . . . [be] fully accepted by—the\nlarger community.” Id. at 473. Such programs do so, the Court explained, through\n“preparing minority children for citizenship in our pluralistic society, while . . . teaching\nmembers of the racial majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with children of\nminority heritage.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 330-32 (“[T]he [University of Michigan] Law School’s [race-conscious]\nadmissions policy promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial\nstereotypes, and enables [students] to better understand persons of different races. . . .\n[T]he diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher\neducation must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity.” (fourth\nalteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Seattle Court then\nconcluded that Initiative 350 had a racial focus, because “it is enough that minorities\nmay consider busing for integration to be ‘legislation that is in their interest.’” Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 474 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\n        Proposal 2, like Initiative 350, has a “racial focus,” because the Michigan\nuniversities’ affirmative-action programs “inure[] primarily to the benefit of the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 16\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nminority, and [are] designed for that purpose,” for the reasons articulated by the Court\nin Seattle. See id. at 472. Just as the desegregative busing programs at issue in Seattle\nwere designed to improve racial minorities’ representation at many public schools, see\nid. at 460, race-conscious admissions policies increase racial minorities’ representation\nat institutions of higher education, see, e.g., Grutter, 539 U.S. at 316, 328-33 (describing\nthe University of Michigan Law School’s minority-student-enrollment aims); Gratz, 539\nU.S. at 253-56 (describing admissions policies at the University of Michigan regarding\nunderrepresented minority groups). Indeed, underrepresented minorities lobbied for the\nadoption of such policies at Michigan’s universities in the first place for this reason, (see\nAnderson Report, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 222 Ex. L, at 16-23), and, further, the unrebutted\nevidence in the record indicates that Proposal 2 will likely negatively impact minority\nrepresentation at Michigan’s institutions of higher education, (see Connerly Dep., Dist.\nCt. Docket No. 222 Ex. A, at 119-21; Spencer Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 203 Ex. D, at\n100-01; Wu Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 203 Ex. F, at 78; Zearfoss Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket\nNo. 205 Ex. 3, at 56-57). Ample evidence thus grounds our conclusion that race-\nconscious admissions policies “inure[] primarily to the benefit of the minority.” See\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 472.\n\n        Yet the Attorney General argues, and we previously suggested, that the now-\ndefunct Michigan admissions policies benefitted women as well, and that saves them.\nSee Coal. II, 473 F.3d at 250-51. Our prior suggestion does not bind us, see Certified\nRestoration Dry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d 535, 542 (6th Cir.\n2007), and we now reject it. The Supreme Court made it clear that even policies\nbenefitting the majority—let alone another minority—may have a “racial focus,” so that\nlens does not clarify anything. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 472. In fact, it serves only to blur\nwhat is in reality a clear test: The question is not whether the challenged law “burdens\nminority interests and minority interests alone,” Coal. II, 473 F.3d at 250, but whether\nthe law targets policies that minorities may consider in their interest, Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 472. Even a cursory examination of the cases confirms this understanding. In Hunter,\nthe ordinance likewise burdened non-racial minorities, including Catholics, Hispanics\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/        Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 17\n1534; 09-1111             Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nand numerous other groups (which, grouped together, would constitute a majority of the\nelectorate), but the Court held that the law had a racial focus. 393 U.S. at 387. The same\nwas true of the policy at issue in Nyquist, and the Court again agreed that it had a racial\nfocus. 318 F. Supp. at 716-17. Likewise, as explained above, the race-conscious\nadmissions policies stymied by Proposal 2 are in the interest of racial minorities and\ninure primarily to their benefit, so the polices have a racial focus as well.\n\n          This conclusion is not impacted by the fact that increased representation of racial\nminorities in higher education also benefits students of other groups and our nation as\na whole. Cf. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 327-33 (describing the varied benefits supporting\nMichigan’s compelling interest in increasing racial diversity at public institutions of\nhigher education). Similar benefits accrued to children at integrated public schools\nunder Seattle’s desegregative busing plan, which the Supreme Court explicitly\nrecognized: “[I]t should be . . . clear that white as well as Negro children benefit from\nexposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the classroom . . . [by] teaching members of the\nracial majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with children of minority heritage.”\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 472-73. Nonetheless, the Seattle Court found that the wider benefits\nof the busing plan did not serve to distinguish Hunter, “for we may fairly assume that\nmembers of the racial majority both favored and benefited from Akron’s fair housing\nordinance.” Id. at 472. By the same token, race-conscious admissions policies’ wider\nbenefits do not undermine the conclusion that their primary beneficiaries are racial\nminorities.\n\n          We therefore find that the race-conscious admissions policies now barred by\nProposal 2 inure primarily to the benefit of racial minorities and that Proposal 2, insofar\nas it prohibits consideration of applicants’ race in admissions decisions, has a “racial\nfocus.”\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 18\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                               b. Reordering the Political Process to Place Special\n                               Burdens on Racial Minorities\n\n       The second prong of the Hunter/Seattle test asks us to determine whether\nProposal 2 works a reallocation of political power or reordering of the political process\nthat places “special burdens” on racial minorities. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 470; Hunter,\n393 U.S. at 391.\n\n                                       1. Does Proposal 2 Reorder a “Political” Process?\n\n       The first issue within this prong is whether the Michigan admissions committees\nare “political,” as that term is used in the Hunter/Seattle test. We begin by examining\nthe word itself. “Political” has two possible meanings relevant to our discussion: “of or\nrelating to government,” Merriam-Webster, Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary: Unabridged 1755 (1993) (first definition), or “of, relating to, or involved in\nparty politics,” id. (third definition). Examining the Court’s language, we conclude that\nthe “political” requirement seeks to ensure that the process at issue relates to\ngovernment.\n\n       The political processes relevant in Hunter and Seattle were the Akron public-\nhousing structure and the Washington public schools’ student-assignment system,\nrespectively. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 390, 393. Clarifying the\n“political” nature of the latter, the Court referred to the “political process”\ninterchangeably as a “decisionmaking process” and a “governmental process,” and\nexplained that the political power allocation in question is of “governmental power.”\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 470. The Court elsewhere identified the relevant characteristics that\nmade the school boards “political”: They were “creatures of the State” and had to “give\neffect to policies announced by the state legislature.” Id. at 476. In other words, the\nboards were “political” because they were governmental entities, not necessarily\nelectoral or partisan ones. Id. Even more explicitly, the Court found that Initiative 350’s\nflaw was “us[ing] the racial nature of an issue to define the governmental\ndecisionmaking structure.” Id. at 470 (emphasis added); see also id. at 474 (“As in\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 19\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nHunter, then, the community’s political mechanisms are modified to place effective\ndecisionmaking authority over a racial issue at a different level of government.”\n(emphasis added)). Indeed, the Court noted that the political “reallocation of power of\nthe kind condemned in Hunter” is the removal of “authority . . . from the existing\ndecisionmaking body.” Id. (emphasis added); see also id. at 477 (“[I]t is irrelevant that\nthe State might have vested all decisionmaking authority in itself, so long as the political\nstructure it in fact erected imposes comparative burdens on minority interests . . . .”\n(emphasis added)). Thus, a process is “political” under Hunter and Seattle if it involves\ngovernmental decisionmaking.\n\n         The dissent disagrees. It defines a “political process” narrowly, as one “through\nwhich the people exercise their right to govern themselves,” Slip Op. at 13, or one that\nis “electoral,”2 id. at 18-19 & n.6, and suggests that a process is political only if it\ninvolves direct elections. In so doing, the dissent misapprehends the “political” nexus\nrequired in the Hunter/Seattle test. The electoral nature of a state system is relevant not\nto the political nature of a process, but to the reordering at issue. The Court’s point in\nrequiring that there be reordering of a “political process” was merely to ensure that the\nprocess was state-directed (“governmental”) and mattered (“decisionmaking”), the same\nway Title VII cases require the alleged discriminatory act to relate to a company agent\nwith relevant authority. No link to the electoral process is required to find a given\nprocess “political.”\n\n         The dissent latches on to a lone mention of an “electorate” in Seattle to argue that\nthe Hunter/Seattle political process must be an electoral, or voting-centered, political\nprocess. The statement at issue, however, was simply the Court’s quotation of the\nlanguage setting forth the school board’s authority under Washington law. See Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 478 (quoting Wash. Rev. Code § 28A.58.758(1)). And that quotation sits in\n\n         2\n           By “electoral,” the dissent must mean “of or relating to election.” See Merriam-Webster,\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary: Unabridged 731 (1993). Nothing in either definition of\n“political,” however, relates more than tangentially to an election or voting: Yes, in a democracy,\ngovernment exists because of elections, but the Court did not require there to be a “political process” for\nthe purpose of elucidating first principles. The second meaning of government—in effect, “partisan”—is\nmore related to elections, but the cases do not support (and the dissent does not advocate) such a reading.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 20\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\na section explaining the structure of Washington’s educational system generally and the\npower of the school boards specifically. See id. To argue that the key insight to the\nentire Hunter/Seattle test lies in this solitary quotation is unsupportable, especially given\nthe abundance of language to the contrary in those cases. Moreover, there is no language\nin this section of Seattle suggesting that the Court was defining what it meant by a\n“political process.”        A process thus is “political” if it involves governmental\ndecisionmaking. Nothing more is required.\n\n         This point is hammered home by the Court’s affirmance of, and subsequent\nreliance (in Seattle) on, Nyquist. In Nyquist, the Court agreed with the three-judge panel\nthat an enactment to New York’s laws unconstitutionally reordered the political process\nwhen the enactment “prohibit[ed] state education officials and appointed school boards”\nfrom performing various education-related functions “for the purpose of achieving racial\nequality in attendance.” 318 F. Supp. at 712 (emphasis added). The fact that the school\nboards at issue were not elected did not affect the Court’s decision.3 The Hunter/Seattle\ntest therefore requires simply that the process at issue involve governmental\ndecisionmaking.\n\n         Yet even using the dissent’s erroneous definition of “political” as “electoral,” the\nadmissions committees here still qualify as “political.” For in addition to possessing the\nsame character as the school boards in Seattle and Nyquist and the Akron housing\ninstitutions in Hunter, they fall squarely within Michigan’s electoral system.\n\n         The Michigan Constitution, the foundation of Michigan’s government,\nestablishes three public universities—the University of Michigan, Michigan State\nUniversity, and Wayne State University—and grants the governing board of each\nuniversity control of its respective institution. Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5; see also id.\nart. VIII, § 6 (allowing the establishment of other institutions of higher learning, such as\n\n         3\n           Likewise, the dissent’s dwelling on the term “legislation,” see Slip Op. at 13-14, misapprehends\nthat term’s usage in the Hunter/Seattle test, for the Court considered the school board policies in Seattle\nand Nyquist to constitute such “legislation,” see Seattle, 458 U.S. at 470, 474-75 & n.17; Nyquist, 318 F.\nSupp. at 718-19, and the admissions policies at Michigan’s colleges and universities are of an identical\ncharacter.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                      Page 21\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nMichigan’s other public colleges and universities, and according their governing boards\nsimilar control). At each institution, these boards and their members have slightly\ndiffering names—“Board of Trustees,” “Board of Governors,” “Board of Regents,” and\nso on—but the same role: to run, with plenary authority, their respective institution. Id.\nart. VIII, §§ 5-6; Glass v. Dudley Paper Co., 112 N.W.2d 489, 490 (Mich. 1961).\nMichigan law has confirmed this absolute authority again and again. See, e.g., Glass,\n112 N.W.2d at 490; Attorney Gen. ex rel. Cook v. Burhans, 7 N.W.2d 370, 371 (Mich.\n1942); Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Attorney Gen., 132 N.W. 1037, 1040 (Mich.\n1911); 1979-80 Mich. Op. Atty Gen. 578, 1980 WL 114008, at *1-2 (Mich. A.G. Jan.\n31, 1980).\n\n         Eight elected individuals populate each of these boards, and they hold office for\neight years. Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5; see also id. art. VIII, § 6. The boards govern the\nuniversities, including enacting the regulations that direct the university’s government\nand determining when to retain or remove the president or faculty. See Mich. Comp.\nLaws §§ 390.3-.6 (University of Michigan).4 The meetings at which the board takes\nsuch action are generally public. See id. § 390.20. Meanwhile, the bylaws, over which\nthe boards have complete authority, detail the admissions procedures.5 See Univ. of\nMich.,       Bylaws        of     the     Bd.      of    Regents         §    8.01,      available         at\n\n\n         4\n          Though the statutes and bylaws cited in this paragraph govern only the University of Michigan,\nthe boards of the other public colleges and universities in Michigan are similarly empowered. See, e.g.,\nMich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.102-.107 (Michigan State University), 390.641-.645 (Wayne State University).\n         5\n            At Michigan State University, the Provost of the University “shall be appointed by the Board\n[of Trustees],” “shall serve at the pleasure of the Board,” and “[s]hall be responsible for supervising\nprocedures and policies relating to the admission of students.” Mich. State Univ., Bd. of Trs. Bylaws, art.\n4, available at http://www.trustees.msu.edu/bylaws (last visited June 24, 2011). The Board retains the\nauthority to “determine and establish the qualifications of students for admission at any level” upon the\nrecommendation of the President, whom the Board elects and who also serves at its pleasure, id. arts. 1,\n4, as well as the more general authority to reallocate responsibility for admissions to other officers or to\nitself, see id. art. 17.\n           At Wayne State University, the President, elected by the Board, is authorized to establish specific\nadmissions standards for undergraduate and graduate degree programs after (s)he has consulted with the\nrelevant college or school and the Graduate Council, see Mich. Const. art. VIII § 5; Wayne State Univ.\nStatutes §§ 2.34.09.090, 2.34.12.350, available at http://www.bog.wayne.edu/code (last visited June 24,\n2011), and the Board may amend its regulations to alter, remove, or shift this authority as it sees fit, see\nWayne State Univ., Bd. of Governor Bylaws 10, available at http://www.bog.wayne.edu/files/bylaws.pdf\n(last visited June 24, 2011) (describing the Board’s authority to enact bylaws and regulations for the\ngovernance of the University).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/        Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 22\n1534; 09-1111             Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nhttp://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws (last visited June 24, 2011). Nothing prevents the\nboards from altering this framework for admissions decisions if they are so inclined. See\nMich. Const. art. VIII, § 5; Mich. Comp. Laws §§ 390.3-.6; Univ. of Mich., Bylaws of\nthe Bd. of Regents § 8.01, available at http://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws (last\nvisited June 24, 2011).\n\n        Attempting to argue to the contrary, the dissent claims that the admissions\ncommittees are not connected to Michigan’s electoral political system because the\ngoverning boards of the universities “have fully delegated the responsibility for\nestablishing admissions standards.” Slip Op. at 11 (emphasis added). The dissent rests\nthis argument on “the testimony of the law school deans in this case.” Id. at 14. But the\ndissent’s argument fails for two reasons. First, the testimony the dissent references does\nnot support the dissent’s claim of “full delegation” or the idea that the boards could not\ntheoretically change the policies; it merely describes the current admissions structures.\nThere is one exception to this observation, however: former-Dean Wu’s personal opinion\nthat modification of the admissions structure might “precipitate a constitutional crisis.”\n(Wu Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 203 Ex. F, at 191-92). But this opinion is inadmissible\nas both speculation and a legal conclusion (notably, with no basis in Michigan law). See\nTorres v. Cnty. of Oakland, 758 F.2d 147, 149-51 (6th Cir. 1985).\n\n        Second, and much more to the point, the structure of Michigan’s colleges and\nuniversities is a question of law, for it is set by constitution, statutes and regulations. See\nUnited States v. Dedman, 527 F.3d 577, 584-85 (6th Cir. 2008). And we would be\nremiss to rely on witness testimony to decide such questions, see Fed. R. Evid. 701;\nTorres v. Cnty. of Oakland, 758 F.2d 147, 149-51 (6th Cir. 1985); cf. Becht v. Owens\nCorning Fiberglas Corp., 196 F.3d 650, 654 (6th Cir. 1999), particularly where as here\na clear statutory structure is weighed against unfounded supposition. Still, the dissent\nprotests: “As they currently stand, the faculty admissions committees are islands unto\nthemselves, vested with the full and unreviewed authority to set admissions policy for\ntheir respective university programs.” Slip Op. at 14. The current boards’ policies,\nhowever, are besides the point. The key question is whether the boards’ current\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 23\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\npolicies—in the form of bylaws and regulations—could be altered, for example if the\npeople of Michigan elected different boards dedicated to changing the universities’\nadmissions policies. Michigan law provides a resounding “yes,” see Mich. Const. art.\nVIII, §§ 5-6; cf. Mich. State Univ., Bd. of Trs. Bylaws, art. 5 (stipulating that “[t]he\ndelegation of any authority by the Board to any committee shall not operate to relieve\nthe Board or any member thereof of any responsibility imposed by law or the State\nConstitution”), and the dissent points us to no law indicating otherwise.\n\n        Moreover, because the dissent does not question the boards’ electoral nature, the\ndissent’s argument implies another untenable proposition: that delegation of admittedly\nelectoral power to an unelected body renders the power ultimately exercised non-\nelectoral. As an initial matter, the appointed boards in Nyquist soundly rebuff this\nargument. Yet the argument cannot hold water even aside from Nyquist. Let us begin\nby dissecting the dissent’s contention in a more familiar electoral framework: the federal\nsystem. In parallel to Michigan’s university structure, the members of the National\nSecurity Council (“NSC”) are likewise unelected individuals receiving delegated\nelectoral political power, though from the President of the United States. Do we\nconsider the power they wield to be electoral? Of course. That they are a step removed\nfrom the electoral process does not mean that they are not exercising electoral political\npower. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 296 (1936) (“And the Constitution\nitself is in every real sense a law—the lawmakers being the people themselves, in whom\nunder our system all political power and sovereignty primarily resides . . . . It is by that\nlaw, and not otherwise, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary agencies which it\ncreated exercise such political authority as they have been permitted to possess.”\n(emphasis added)); see also Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 393 (1989)\n(referring to the United States Sentencing Commission’s work as of a “significantly\npolitical nature”); cf. Walsh v. Heilmann, 472 F.3d 504, 506 (7th Cir. 2006) (“Many\nunits of government delegate important decisions to middle management, and when they\ndo this they may insist that the holders of the delegated power be reliable implementers\nof the elected officials’ platforms.” (emphasis added)). If American voters do not like\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/            Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                      Page 24\n1534; 09-1111                 Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nwhat the NSC does, they may exact an electoral price against the person from whom the\nNSC receives its power: the President.6 The same is true of the admissions committees\nhere, which wield the electoral power bestowed on them—through the\nboards—ultimately by the Michigan Constitution. See Part II.A.1.ii.b.2, infra.\n\n         In sum, we find apt the Court’s rejoinder to claims similar to those the Attorney\nGeneral and the dissent make: “[T]hat a State may distribute legislative power as it\ndesires . . . furnish[es] no justification for a legislative structure which otherwise would\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 476 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 392) (first alteration added). Michigan, like “Washington[,] . . . has chosen to make\nuse of a more complex governmental structure” than direct administration by the\nlegislature, or even the university boards, of admissions decisions in university and\ncollege affairs. See id. at 476-77. However, as we have explained, the fact that the\nadmissions committees received the political power they exercise through delegation\nrather than direct election is irrelevant to the nature of that power and thus the\napplicability of the Hunter/Seattle test.\n\n         Therefore, the admissions committees are “political” because they are\ngovernmental decisionmaking bodies. And even if they had to be tied to the electoral\nsystem, they are, because the individuals delegated with principal responsibility for\nadmissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities are appointed by the\ninstitutions’ governing boards—which are either elected by the citizens of Michigan or\nappointed by elected officials—and the boards are free to reassign this responsibility as\n\n\n         6\n            Put more pointedly, it is the electoral structure that renders the power wielded electoral, not the\nnature of the person’s position. No matter how many times this power is delegated, or to whom, an elected\nofficial is ultimately responsible for it. For example, though two State Department employees may reach\ntheir posts by different paths, one hired and one appointed, both individuals’ power stems from the\nPresident, and they perform the same function: the work of the President. And a building manager working\nfor the General Services Administration (“GSA”), like a faculty member on a public university’s\nadmissions committee, is hired and performs a function existing equally in the private sector. The building\nmanager’s private counterpart does not exercise electoral power, yet the GSA employee and Michigan\nfaculty member do. The difference lies in the ultimate source of these latter two individuals’ authority:\nthe government. The fact remains that an elected official—be it the President of the United States, the\nGovernor of Michigan, or a member of one of the university boards—is accountable to the electorate for\nthe power that he delegated to the GSA, State Department, or university admissions committees, and he\ncould equally choose to delegate that power to someone else or exercise it himself. This is what it means\nfor power to be electoral.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/          Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                  Page 25\n1534; 09-1111               Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthey see fit. Thus, there is little doubt that Proposal 2 affects a “political process” under\nHunter and Seattle.\n\n                                             2. Does Proposal 2 Effect a “Reordering” of the\n                                             Political Process so as to Place Special Burdens\n                                             on Racial Minorities?\n         The next issue is whether Proposal 2 reordered the political process to place\nspecial burdens on racial minorities. We find that Proposal 2 burdens racial minorities\nfor the reasons articulated in Part II.A.1.ii.a, supra. As to whether there was a\nreordering, the Court has found that both implicit and explicit reordering violates the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 387, 390. In\nHunter, the express language of the charter amendment required any ordinance\nregulating real estate “on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry”\nto be approved by a majority of the electorate and the City Council, as opposed to solely\nthe City Council for other real-estate ordinances. 393 U.S. 387, 390.\n\n         In Seattle, however, the reordering was implicit: On its face, Initiative 350\nsimply prohibited school boards from using mandatory busing, but its practical effect\nwas that “[t]hose favoring the elimination of de facto school segregation now must seek\nrelief from the state legislature, or from the statewide electorate” through overturning\nInitiative 350. 458 U.S. at 474. Nonetheless, “authority over all other student\nassignment decisions . . . remains vested in the local school board.” Id. The Seattle\nCourt then clarified what sort of reordering contravenes the “political process” theory:\n“The evil condemned by the Hunter Court was not the particular political obstacle of\nmandatory referenda imposed by the Akron charter amendment; it was, rather, the\ncomparative structural burden placed on the achievement of minority interests.”7 Id. at\n474 n.17 (emphasis added). Thus, any “comparative structural burden,” be it local or\nstate-wide or national, satisfies the reallocation prong of the Hunter/Seattle test. Id.\n\n\n\n         7\n           The Court’s statement here rebuffs the dissent’s attempt to argue that the “relevant lawmaking\nauthority” also must be reallocated from a “local legislative body” to a “more complex government\nstructure” with a broader constituency. See Slip Op. at 7.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 26\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        We face here an enactment even more troubling than those at issue in Hunter and\nSeattle, as the hurdle Proposal 2 creates is of the highest possible order. An interested\nMichigan citizen may use any number of avenues to change the admissions policies on\nan issue unrelated to race. He may lobby the admissions committees directly, through\nwritten or in-person communication if the latter is available, or petition higher\nadministrative authorities at the university: the dean of admissions, the president or dean\nof the university, or the university’s board. See Part II.A.1.ii.b.1, supra; see also, e.g.,\nUniv. Defs. Admis., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 172 Ex. I, at 11, 14-15, 17-20; Wu Dep., Dist.\nCt. Docket No. 203 Ex. F, at 190; Zearfoss Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 205 Ex. 3, at 209-\n10. And there is no question that the admissions committees are very much accountable\nto the universities’ boards, which retain ultimate—and politically accountable—\nresponsibility over admissions policies. See Mich. Const. art. VIII, §§ 5-6.\n\n        The individual seeking this non-race-related change may also seek to affect the\nelection—through voting, campaigning, or otherwise—of any one of the eight board\nmembers whom the individual believes will champion his cause and revise the review\nof admissions determinations accordingly. These elections, though state-wide in scope,\nwould likely be much more manageable than those surrounding constitutional\namendments, which can be expensive, lengthy, and complex, (see Wilfore Decl., Dist.\nCt. Docket No. 203 Ex. C ¶¶ 10, 29-30). Only as a last resort would the effort and\nexpense of campaigning for an amendment to the Michigan Constitution be\nrequired—the only option that remains open for proponents of race-based admissions\ncriteria.\n\n        Meanwhile, a Michigan citizen seeking that Michigan universities adopt race-\nbased admissions policies must now begin by convincing the Michigan electorate to\namend the Michigan Constitution. Placing a proposed constitutional amendment\nabrogating Proposal 2 on the ballot would require either the support of two-thirds of both\nthe Michigan House of Representatives and Senate, see Mich. Const. art. XII, § 1, or the\nsignatures of a number of voters equivalent to at least ten percent of the number of votes\ncast for all candidates for governor in the preceding general election, see id. art XII, § 2.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 27\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nA majority of the voting electorate would then have to approve the amendment. See id.\nart. XII, §§ 1-2.\n\n        Only after traversing this difficult and costly process, (see Wilfore Decl., Dist.\nCt. Docket No. 203 Ex. C ¶¶ 10, 29-30), would the now-exhausted Michigan citizen\nreach the starting point of his opponent who sought a non-race-related admissions policy\nchange. By amending Michigan’s Constitution to prohibit university admissions units\nfrom utilizing race-conscious admissions policies, proponents of Proposal 2 thus\nremoved the authority to institute racially-focused policies from Michigan’s universities\nand lodged it at the most remote level of Michigan’s government, the state constitution.\n\n        In other words, as with the unconstitutional enactment in Hunter, proponents of\nrace-conscious admissions policies now have to obtain the approval of the Michigan\nelectorate and (if they are successful) the admissions units or other university powers,\nwhereas proponents of other admissions policies need only the support of the latter. See\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 468, 474 (describing Hunter).\n\n        The stark contrast between the avenues for political change available to different\nadmissions proponents following Proposal 2 illustrates why the amendment cannot be\nconstrued as a mere repeal of an existing race-related policy. Had those favoring\nabolition of race-conscious admissions successfully lobbied the universities’ admissions\nunits, just as underrepresented minorities did to have these policies adopted in the first\nplace, there would be no equal protection problem. As the Supreme Court has made\nclear, “‘the simple repeal or modification of desegregation or antidiscrimination laws,\nwithout more, never has been viewed as embodying a presumptively invalid racial\nclassification.’” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 483 (quoting Crawford v. Bd. of Educ., 458 U.S.\n527, 539 (1982)); accord Hunter, 393 U.S. at 390 n.5. Crawford brings this distinction\ninto focus, because the Court-approved political action in that case (amendment of the\nCalifornia constitution) occurred at the same level of government as the original\nenactment (a prior amendment of the California constitution), thus leaving the rules of\nthe political game unchanged. 458 U.S. at 532, 540.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 28\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       As illustrated above, however, Proposal 2 “works something more than the ‘mere\nrepeal’ of a desegregation law by the political entity that created it.” Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 483. Rather, like Initiative 350 did for any future attempt to implement race-based\nbusing (and the Akron city charter amendment did for any future attempt to enact a fair\nhousing ordinance), “by lodging decisionmaking authority over the question at a new\nand remote level of government,” Proposal 2 “burdens all future attempts” to implement\nrace-conscious admissions policies. Id.\n\n       By the same token, precisely because Proposal 2 places special burdens on a\npolitical program of particular importance to racial minorities, it is not a sufficient\nresponse to point out that these minorities remain free to repeal it. The “simple but\ncentral principle” of Hunter and Seattle is that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits\nrequiring racial minorities to surmount more formidable obstacles to achieve their\npolitical objectives than other groups face. See id. at 469-70. As the Supreme Court has\nrecognized, such special procedural barriers to minority interests discriminate against\nracial minorities just as surely as—and more insidiously than—substantive legal barriers\nchallenged under the traditional equal protection rubric. See id. at 467 (“[T]he\nFourteenth Amendment also reaches a political structure that treats all individuals as\nequals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special\nburdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)). Because less onerous avenues to effect political\nchange remain open to those advocating consideration of non-racial factors in\nadmissions decisions, Michigan cannot force those advocating for consideration of racial\nfactors to go down a more arduous road than others without violating the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\n\n       We thus conclude that Proposal 2 reorders the political process in Michigan to\nplace special burdens on minority interests.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 29\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                       iii. Proposed Permutations of the Hunter/Seattle Test\n\n                               a. Is Prohibiting “Preferential Treatment” Different From\n                               Prohibiting “Discrimination”?\n       The Attorney General asserts that Hunter and Seattle are inapplicable to Proposal\n2 because the cases govern only enactments that burden racial minorities’ ability to\nobtain protection from discrimination through the political process, whereas Proposal\n2 burdens racial minorities’ ability to obtain preferential treatment. In support of this\ndistinction, the Attorney General points to our preliminary injunction ruling, and\ndecisions of the Ninth Circuit and the district court. See Coal. II, 473 F.3d at 251; Coal.\nfor Econ. Equity, 122 F.3d at 708; Coal. IV, 539 F. Supp. 2d at 956-57. None of these\ndecisions is binding on us. See Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d at 542 (“[C]onclusions of law\nmade by a court granting [a] preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the\nmerits.” (internal quotation mark omitted)); Cross Mountain Coal. v. Ward, 93 F.3d 211,\n217 (6th Cir. 1996) (“[T]he decisions of other circuits are entitled to our respect, [but]\nthey are not binding upon us.”). And we do not find them persuasive.\n\n       We turn first to the distinction at issue and its true meaning. Differentiation\nbetween “discrimination” and “preference” in this context finds its origin in the Ninth\nCircuit. See Coal. for Econ. Equity, 122 F.3d at 707-09. The Coalition for Economic\nEquity court began by stating that “[e]ven a state law that does restructure the political\nprocess can only deny equal protection if it burden’s an individual’s right to equal\ntreatment.” Id. at 707 (emphasis added). The court then continued: “It is one thing to\nsay that individuals have equal protection rights against political obstructions to equal\ntreatment; it is quite another to say that individuals have equal protection rights against\npolitical obstructions to preferential treatment.” Id. at 708. In so positing, the Ninth\nCircuit added another element to the Hunter/Seattle test. That element, stripped of the\ncontroversial and obfuscating distinction between “discrimination” and “preference,”\nboils down to a belief that an enactment violates the Equal Protection Clause under\nHunter and Seattle only if it undermines state action that is constitutionally mandated\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                     Page 30\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n(“discrimination”), as opposed to constitutionally permissible (“preference”).8 Put\ndifferently: An enactment is unconstitutional if it transgresses a constitutionally-\nmandated action, i.e., an enactment is unconstitutional under the “political process”\nframework only if the enactment is already unconstitutional under the “traditional”\nrubric. But this reasoning defies logic. Using this rationale, the political process theory\nwould be superfluous, for an aggrieved citizen could sue to enjoin the unconstitutional\nlaw under the traditional equal protection analysis. For that very reason, the Court\ncreated the “political process” theory in the context of cases addressing state action that\nis constitutionally permissible (or “preferential” to use the Attorney General and Ninth\nCircuit’s terminology). The facts of those very cases thus prohibit this distinction.\n\n         The Court in Hunter rejected the argument that the Akron amendment’s effect\nwas moot because the amendment was invalid under the 1968 Civil Rights Act, see\nHunter, 393 U.S. at 388-89, or that traditional equal protection resolved the case, id. at\n389. Seattle even more clearly involved constitutionally-permissible state action, as\nInitiative 350 responded to a voluntary school board effort to reduce the impact of de\nfacto segregation. 458 U.S. at 460-61. The school board was under no obligation to\nundertake this effort because there had been no finding that the segregation was\nmotivated by racial discrimination—a fact that the Seattle dissent repeatedly pointed out.\nSee, e.g., id. at 491-92 (Powell, J., dissenting) (“The Court has never held that there is\nan affirmative duty to integrate the schools in the absence of a finding of unconstitutional\nsegregation. . . . Certainly there is no constitutional duty to adopt mandatory busing in\nthe absence of such a violation.”). Rather, the Board’s plan was an ameliorative measure\ndesigned to combat the effects of Seattle’s segregated housing patterns and “alleviate the\nisolation of minority students.” Id. at 460. It is inaccurate, therefore, to suggest that\nInitiative 350 made it “more difficult for minorities to obtain protection from\n\n         8\n           This must be so because there is no free-floating “right” to be free of discrimination. That right\nmust therefore find its basis in either the United States Constitution—primarily through the Equal\nProtection Clause—or a federal statute. The latter was not at issue in Coalition for Economic Equity, so\nthe Equal Protection Clause must ground the right discussed by the Ninth Circuit. Therefore, the only\npossible reading of the Ninth Circuit’s decision is that the Equal Protection Clause, through the “political\nprocess” theory, only protects action which the Equal Protection Clause, through the “traditional” theory,\nalready protects.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 31\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndiscrimination through the political process.” Coal. II, 473 F.3d at 251. Quite the\ncontrary: As the district court recognized, “[b]ecause prohibiting integration (when it is\nnot constitutionally mandated) is not tantamount to discrimination, . . . the Court in\nSeattle did not (and could not) rely on the notion that the restructuring at issue impeded\nefforts to secure equal treatment.”9 Coal. VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 951.\n\n         Similarly, in Nyquist, the New York Legislature responded to attempts to remedy\nde facto segregation “generated in large part by local housing patterns and economic\nconditions,” 318 F. Supp. at 717, by passing a law prohibiting “state education officials\nand appointed school boards from assigning students, or establishing, reorganizing or\nmaintaining school districts . . . for the purpose of achieving racial equality in\nattendance,” id. at 712. Applying Hunter, the court concluded that “by prohibiting the\nimplementation of plans designed to alleviate racial imbalance in the schools,” the\nstatute “creates a clearly racial classification, treating educational matters involving\nracial criteria differently from other educational matters and making it more difficult to\ndeal with racial imbalance in the public schools.” Id. at 718-19. In reaching this\nconclusion, the court rejected the defendants’ argument that this classification did not\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause because “in the absence of de jure segregation, the\nstate is under no obligation to take affirmative action to reduce de facto segregation.”\nId. at 719. The court reasoned that the process-based nature of the Hunter inquiry\nprecluded this distinction:\n\n\n\n         9\n           In holding that Proposal 2 nonetheless does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the district\ncourt asserted that the race-conscious admissions policies at issue here should be distinguished from the\nvoluntary desegregative busing program at issue in Seattle because, unlike race-conscious admissions\npolicies, “school desegregation programs are not inherently invidious, do not work wholly to the benefit\nof certain members of one group and correspondingly to the harm of certain members of another group,\nand do not deprive citizens of rights.” Coal. VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 951 (quoting Coal. for Econ. Equity,\n122 F.3d at 708 n.16).\n          This purported distinction is erroneous and flies in the face of the Supreme Court’s decisions in\nGrutter and Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, 551 U.S. 701 (2007).\nIn Grutter, the Supreme Court showed how narrowly-tailored race-conscious admissions programs are not\n“inherently invidious,” see 539 U.S. at 334-44, and do not work “wholly to the benefit of members of one\ngroup,” see id. at 330. The Court explained: “[T]he skills needed in today’s increasingly global\nmarketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and\nviewpoints.” Id. In Parents Involved, the Court held that voluntary school desegregation programs can\nimpose injury, depriving citizens of rights. 551 U.S. at 719.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/          Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 32\n1534; 09-1111               Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n           [T]he argument that the state has not discriminated because it has no\n           constitutional obligation to end de facto racial imbalance fails to meet the\n           issue under Hunter v. Erickson. The statute places burdens on the\n           implementation of educational policies designed to deal with race on the\n           local level. . . . The discrimination is clearly based on race alone, and the\n           distinction created in the political process, based on racial considerations,\n           operates in practice as a racial classification.\n\nId. Accordingly, the court held the law unconstitutional, a decision that the Supreme\nCourt summarily affirmed, 402 U.S. 935 (1971), and then subsequently relied on in\nSeattle.\n\n           It should be unsurprising, then, that the language of these decisions encompasses\nany legislation in the racial minorities’ interest, and thus is broader than it would be\nwere the Attorney General’s distinction valid. See, e.g., Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467 (noting\nthe Fourteenth Amendment protects against distortions of the political process that\n“place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation”\n(emphasis added)); id. at 470 (requiring searching judicial scrutiny where state action\nmakes it more difficult for racial minorities “to achieve legislation that is in their\ninterest” (emphasis added) (internal quotation mark omitted)); id. at 474 (finding it\n“enough that minorities may consider busing for integration to be legislation that is in\ntheir interest” (emphasis added) (internal quotation mark omitted)); Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 393 (“[T]he State may no more disadvantage any particular group by making it more\ndifficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it may dilute any person’s vote . . . .”\n(emphasis added)); cf. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. at 720 (holding that the state “has acted to\nmake it more difficult for racial minorities to achieve goals that are in their interest”\n(emphasis added)).\n\n           The cases’ context and reasoning, discussed above, crystallize the point of the\nHunter/Seattle doctrine. The political process theory does not serve as a duplicative\nbackstop against already unconstitutional action. Instead, it prevents the placement of\nspecial procedural obstacles on minority objectives, whatever those objectives may be.\nThe distinction urged by the Attorney General thus erroneously imposes an outcome-\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/         Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                Page 33\n1534; 09-1111              Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nbased limitation on a process-based right. Again, what matters is if racial minorities are\nforced to surmount procedural hurdles in reaching this goal over which other groups do\nnot have to leap. If racial minorities do, the disparate procedural treatment violates the\nEqual Protection Clause, regardless of the goal sought. Accordingly, whether “all\ngovernmental use of race must have a logical end point,” as the dissent asserts, Slip Op.\nat 21 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342), is irrelevant to the constitutionality of Proposal\n2 under Hunter and Seattle. The equal protection injury imposed by Proposal 2 is not\nthe Michigan electorate’s attempt to end affirmative action, but the method by which it\nsought to do so.\n\n                                   b. Does a Law Place Special Burdens on Minorities Even\n                                   When Multiple Minorities Affected by the Enactment,\n                                   Cobbled-Together, Would Constitute a Numerical\n                                   Majority?\n        As to the issue of burdening minorities, the Attorney General argues that\nProposal 2 places no special burden on racial minorities because they, together with\nwomen, constitute a numerical majority of voters and thus could theoretically repeal\nProposal 2.10 In so arguing, he points to the Hunter Court’s statement in dicta that “[t]he\nmajority needs no protection against discrimination and if it did, a referendum might be\nbothersome but no more than that.” 393 U.S. at 391.\n\n        The Attorney General’s argument is without merit. Examination of the context\nof that statement from Hunter reveals that the quotation referred to the racial majority\nat issue in that case, not the ad-hoc and theoretical numerical majority posited by the\nAttorney General. See id. And as the district court cogently stated:\n\n        The argument that racial minorities plus women constitute a majority of\n        the population, and therefore Proposal 2 does not discriminate against\n        minorities . . . borders on nonsense. The attempt to cobble together an\n        artificial coalition of women and racial minorities in an effort to construct\n        a numerical majority of citizens ignores the fact that affirmative action\n        programs generally are targeted to benefit insular groups that separately\n\n        10\n            We address this argument separately because our “racial focus” analysis does not encompass\nit fully. See Part II.A.1.ii.a, supra.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 34\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       have suffered from discriminatory practices in the past because of\n       perceived traits unique to that group alone. Lumping minority groups\n       into a contrived category does not allow any greater political influence\n       over the process of advocating for affirmative action programs to achieve\n       racial parity or otherwise render the process of changing the state\n       constitution “bothersome but no more than that.”\n\nCoal. IV, 539 F. Supp. 2d at 956 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391); cf. Growe v. Emison,\n507 U.S. 25, 41 (1989) (noting that, under the Voting Rights Act, “a court may not\npresume bloc voting within even a single minority group,” and so “it ma[kes] no sense\nfor . . . [a court to] indulge that presumption as to bloc voting within an agglomeration\nof distinct minority groups”).\n\n       Finally, as the Supreme Court has long recognized, minority groups may face\npolitical disadvantages independent of their numerical strength. See San Antonio Indep.\nSch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973) (noting that minority groups may be\n“saddled with such disabilities, or subjected to such a history of purposeful unequal\ntreatment, or relegated to such a position of political powerlessness as to command\nextraordinary protection from the majoritarian political process”); cf. Frontiero v.\nRichardson, 411 U.S. 677, 686 n.17 (1973) (observing that women are underrepresented\npolitically even though “[i]t is true, of course, that when viewed in the abstract, women\ndo not constitute a small and powerless minority”). Therefore, it is a considerable\noversimplification—and simply inaccurate—to conflate a simple numerical majority\ncomprised of members of different minority groups with a political majority for which\n“a referendum might be bothersome but no more than that.” Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391.\n\n                                 c. Does the Hunter/Seattle Test Contain an Intent\n                                 Requirement?\n       Drawing on the language from Seattle that Initiative 350 “was effectively drawn\nfor racial purposes,” and “enacted because of, not merely in spite of, its adverse effects\nupon busing for integration,” 458 U.S. at 471 (internal quotation marks omitted), the\nAttorney General also argues that a reallocation of political decisionmaking violates the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/        Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 35\n1534; 09-1111             Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nEqual Protection Clause only if the Plaintiffs can demonstrate it was motivated by\npurposeful racial discrimination.\n\n          However, “the idea that a political restructuring claim must be based on [a\nfinding of] purposeful discrimination finds no support in the [Supreme Court’s] cases.”\nCoal. IV, 539 F. Supp. 2d at 956. Indeed, in Seattle, the Court expressly rejected this\nargument. Acknowledging that “‘purposeful discrimination is the condition that offends\nthe Constitution,’” 458 U.S. at 484 (quoting Pers. Adm’r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 274\n(1979)), the Court nonetheless emphasized that “[w]e have not insisted on a\nparticularized inquiry into motivation in all equal protection cases.” Id. at 485. Rather,\n“‘[a] racial classification, regardless of purported motivation, is presumptively invalid\nand can be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.’” Id. (quoting Feeney, 442\nU.S. at 272). Legislation like that in Hunter, Seattle, and here, which restructures the\npolitical process along racial lines and places special burdens on racial minorities, thus\n“falls into an inherently suspect category,” regardless of whether purposeful racial\ndiscrimination is its demonstrated motivation. Id.\n\n                          iv. “Political Process” Conclusion\n\n          Proposal 2 thus modifies Michigan’s political process “to place special burdens\non the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” See Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 467.\n\n                          v. Strict Scrutiny\n\n          Because Proposal 2 fails the Hunter/Seattle test, it must survive strict scrutiny to\nstand. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 485. Under strict scrutiny, the Attorney General must\nprove that Proposal 2 is “necessary to further a compelling state interest.” Crawford,\n458 U.S. at 536. In Seattle, the Court did not consider whether a compelling state\ninterest might justify a state’s enactment of a racially-focused law that restructures the\npolitical process, because the government did not make the argument. Seattle, 458 U.S.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 36\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nat 485 n.28. Because the Attorney General likewise does not assert that Proposal 2\nsatisfies a compelling state interest, we need not consider this argument either.11\n\n         We therefore hold that those portions of Proposal 2 that affect Michigan’s public\ninstitutions of higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause.12\n\n                  2. “Traditional” Equal Protection Analysis\n\n         Having found that Proposal 2 deprives the Plaintiffs of equal protection of the\nlaw under a “political process” theory, we do not reach the question of whether it also\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause when assessed under the traditional framework.\n\n         B. Ancillary Matters\n\n         We now turn briefly to the ancillary questions of whether the district court\nproperly dismissed Russell and refused to dismiss the University Defendants.\n\n                  1. The University Defendants’ Non-Dismissal\n\n         The University Defendants appeal the district court’s denial of their motion to\nbe dismissed as misjoined parties under Rule 21 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\nWe review the district court’s decision for abuse of discretion and must affirm unless we\nare “left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court committed a clear error\nof judgment.” Letherer v. Alger Group, 328 F.3d 262, 266 (6th Cir. 2003) (internal\nquotation marks omitted), overruled on other grounds by Powerex Corp. v. Reliant\nEnergy Servs., 551 U.S. 224 (2007).\n\n         11\n             Further, the two “compelling interests” advanced by amicus Russell are not actually compelling\ninterests, as their rationale presumes that Proposal 2 does not suffer from any constitutional infirmity.\nMoreover, Russell does not show that Proposal 2 is necessary to further these “compelling” state interests.\n         12\n            The dissent also makes much ado of the Seattle majority’s response to Justice Powell’s\ndissenting argument that the majority’s decision would require finding unconstitutional a situation in which\na higher authority within a university attempted to alter an admissions committee’s decision to develop an\naffirmative-action plan. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 480 n.23 (responding to id. at 498 n.14 (Powell, J.,\ndissenting)). However, the hypothetical situation Justice Powell described is entirely distinguishable from\nthat at issue here, in which decisonmaking authority has been removed to the highest level of state\ngovernment, not to a higher level of authority within the university. The fact that some reorderings of\npolitical processes may be de minimis does not mean that all are. Accordingly, Justice Powell’s argument\nand the Seattle majority’s Delphic response—made in dicta in a footnote with no supporting\nexplanation—are inapposite.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/        Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.       Page 37\n1534; 09-1111             Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n          The district court concluded that the University Defendants were properly joined\nparties under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20(a) because “[i]f this Court were to find\nProposal 2 unconstitutional, affirmative action would not automatically be reinstated into\nthe admissions process. Rather, the universities would have to choose to do so on their\nown.” Coal. IV, 539 F. Supp. 2d at 941. The court therefore found that dismissal under\nRule 21 was inappropriate. The University Defendants contend, however, that they lack\nthe authority to provide Plaintiffs with the requested relief, an injunction against\nProposal 2’s enforcement, and therefore should be dismissed. In support of their\nargument, the University Defendants point us to an unpublished district court opinion.\nSee Brooks v. Glenn Cnty., No. CV288-146, 1989 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 4776 (S.D. Ga. Apr.\n25, 1989). We are not persuaded.\n\n          Rule 21 states in relevant part: “On motion or on its own, the court may at any\ntime, on just terms, add or drop a party.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. “The Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure do not define misjoinder, but the cases make clear that misjoinder of parties\noccurs when [parties] fail to satisfy the conditions for permissive joinder under Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 20(a).” Glendora v. Malone, 917 F. Supp. 224, 227 (S.D.N.Y. 1996). Rule 20(a)\nrequires that a right to relief be asserted against joined defendants. Therefore, “[a]\nmisjoinder of parties . . . frequently is declared because no relief is demanded from one\nor more of the parties joined as defendants.” Letherer, 328 F.3d at 267 (quoting 7\nCharles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 1683, at 475-76 (3d ed.\n2001)).\n\n          The discretionary language of Rule 21, coupled with our deferential standard of\nreview, presents a high hurdle for reversal of the district court’s determination. Here,\nbecause Proposal 2 is unconstitutional and university action is necessary to re-implement\naffirmative-action policies, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of the University\nDefendants’ motion.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.            Page 38\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                2. Russell’s Dismissal\n\n        Intervening defendant Russell, a law student at Wayne State University at the\ntime of oral argument, challenges the district court’s decision to dismiss him from the\ncase because he no longer satisfied the requirements for intervention. We review de\nnovo a district court’s grant of summary judgment. Chen, 580 F.3d at 400. “Summary\njudgment should be granted when the moving party can ‘show that there is no genuine\nissue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of\nlaw.’” Geiger v. Tower Auto., 579 F.3d 614, 620 (6th Cir. 2009) (quoting Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 56(c)). We also review de novo district court decisions on motions to intervene as of\nright, except for the element of timeliness, which is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\nNorthland Family Planning Clinic v. Cox, 487 F.3d 323, 344 (6th Cir. 2007).\n\n        Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a), an interested party must meet\nseveral requirements before being permitted to intervene as of right: (1) his motion to\nintervene must be timely; (2) he must have a substantial legal interest in the subject\nmatter of the case; (3) he must demonstrate that his ability to protect that interest will be\nimpaired in the absence of intervention; and (4) he must demonstrate that the parties\nalready before the court do not adequately represent his interest. See Coal. III, 501 F.3d\nat 779. An intervenor also must continue to meet these requirements throughout the\nduration of the litigation, as courts must be able to ensure that parties maintain a live\ninterest in a case. Accord Morgan v. McDonough, 726 F.2d 11, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1984)\n(affirming the dismissal of an intervening party whose legal interest had lapsed because\n“even if [the party’s original] intervention . . . were of right, . . . it would have gained no\nabsolute entitlement to continue as a party until the termination of the suit”); Rosado v.\nBridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp., 758 A.2d 916, 927 n.15 (Conn. App. Ct.\n2000) (“A court also has the authority to dismiss intervenors once their interest in the\nmatter has expired. Federal cases illustrate that intervention as of right does not grant\nabsolute entitlement to continue as a party until termination of the suit.”); see also Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 24 advisory committee’s note (“An intervention of right . . . may be subject\nto appropriate conditions or restrictions responsive among other things to the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 39\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nrequirements of efficient conduct of the proceedings.”); cf. Friends of Tims Ford v. Tenn.\nValley Auth., 585 F.3d 955, 963 n.1 (6th Cir. 2009) (declining to consider the defendant-\nintervenors’ arguments regarding plaintiff’s standing because the intervenors’ ability to\nprotect their interests was impaired only at later stages of litigation).\n\n        Here, there is no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the Attorney\nGeneral adequately represents Russell’s interests. While Russell’s burden in showing\nthat “representation of his interest ‘may be’ inadequate” is “minimal,” Trbovich v.\nUnited Mine Workers of Am., 404 U.S. 528, 538 n.10 (1972), he still must overcome “the\npresumption of adequate representation” that arises if he shares “the same ultimate\nobjective as a party to the suit,” United States v. Michigan, 424 F.3d 438, 443-44 (6th\nCir. 2005).      Although the Attorney General’s and Russell’s interests initially\ndiverged—the Attorney General agreed to a stipulation to delay the application of\nProposal 2, whereas Russell had an interest in Proposal 2’s immediate\nenforcement—their interests are now aligned. Both now share the same ultimate\nobjective: the validation of Proposal 2. The Attorney General has mounted a firm\ndefense of Proposal 2 and succeeded in convincing the district court to grant summary\njudgment in his favor. See Coal. IV, 539 F. Supp. 2d at 924. As the district court noted,\nthe Attorney General’s and Russell’s summary judgment motions “duplicate each other.”\nCoal. V, 539 F. Supp. 2d at 971. Thus, we agree with the district court’s conclusion that\n“Russell’s presence in the litigation is a mere makeweight that adds nothing of substance\nto the debate over Proposal 2’s constitutionality.” Id. Russell’s intervention in this\nlitigation is therefore no longer proper.\n\n        Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court’s grant of the Cantrell Plaintiffs’\nmotion for summary judgment regarding Russell. While Russell is hereby dismissed as\na party to this case, we nonetheless have considered his filings as we would those of\namicus curiae.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 40\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                                 III. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons above, we AFFIRM the district court’s decision granting the\nCantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment as to Eric Russell, AFFIRM the\ndistrict court’s decision denying the University Defendants’ motion to be dismissed as\nparties, and, because those provisions of Proposal 2 affecting Michigan’s public colleges\nand universities are unconstitutional as a matter of law, REVERSE the district court’s\ndecision granting the Defendants-Appellees’ motion for summary judgment and order\nthe court to enter summary judgment in favor of the Plaintiffs-Appellants.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 41\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        __________________________________________________________\n\n             CONCURRING IN PART AND DISSENTING IN PART\n        __________________________________________________________\n\n        JULIA SMITH GIBBONS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in\npart. I join the majority’s opinion with respect to the procedural issues discussed in part\nII.B.   I disagree, however, with the majority’s conclusion that Proposal 2 is\nunconstitutional under a political restructuring theory of the Equal Protection Clause.\nIn my view, Proposal 2 does not impermissibly restructure the political process in the\nstate of Michigan to burden the ability of minorities to enact beneficial legislation.\nMoreover, Proposal 2 is not unconstitutional under traditional equal protection analysis.\nI therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n                                            I.\n\n        In November 2006, the people of Michigan amended the Michigan Constitution\nto prohibit the state, including its public colleges and universities, from discriminating\nagainst or granting preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race,\nsex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public\neducation, and public contracting. Mich. Const. art. I, § 26. A primary purpose and\neffect of this amendment was to remove the ability of state colleges and universities to\nemploy then-existing race- and gender-preference admissions policies. Accordingly, the\nplaintiffs challenge the amendment as it relates to the state’s colleges and universities.\n\n        Because “[c]ontext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action\nunder the Equal Protection Clause,” Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306, 327 (2003), it\nis important to consider the legal backdrop from which the effort to amend the Michigan\nConstitution unfolded. See Hunter v. Erickson, 393 U.S. 385, 391–92 (1969) (assessing\nthe challenged referendum provision against the relevant legislative and legal\nbackground). The race-based admissions polices used by state universities in Michigan\nare familiar to the courts and the people of Michigan. See Coal. to Defend Affirmative\nAction v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237, 240 (6th Cir. 2006). The policies employed by the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 42\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nUniversity of Michigan formed the basis of the significant and highly publicized Equal\nProtection challenges in Grutter and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003). And, as\nnoted by the majority, the effort by Ward Connerly and Jennifer Gratz to mobilize for\na statewide ballot initiative occurred in direct response to the result in Grutter.\nGranholm, 473 F.3d at 240.\n\n       In Grutter, the Supreme Court concluded that diversity is a compelling state\ninterest that can justify the narrowly tailored use of race in selecting applicants for\nadmission to public universities.     539 U.S. at 325, 328.        Analyzing the highly\nindividualized, holistic approach taken by the University of Michigan Law School,\nwhich considered “all pertinent elements of diversity,” id. at 341 (quoting Regents of\nUniv. of Cal. v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265, 317 (1978) (opinion of Powell, J.)), the Court\nfound that the university had narrowly tailored its approach to the purpose of diversity\nin higher education. Id. at 333–41. In Grutter’s companion case the Court, however,\nreaffirmed that the use of racial classifications are a “highly suspect tool,” id. at 326\n(quoting Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S. 469, 493 (1989) (plurality opinion)),\nsubject to strict scrutiny because “‘[r]acial classifications are simply too pernicious to\npermit any but the most exact connection between justification and classification.’”\nGratz, 539 U.S. at 270 (quoting Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 537 (1980)\n(Stevens, J., dissenting)). The Court reiterated that “remedial race-based governmental\naction generally ‘remains subject to continuing oversight to assure that it will work the\nleast harm possible to other innocent persons competing for the benefit.’” Grutter, 539\nU.S. at 341 (quoting Bakke, 438 U.S. at 308 (opinion of Powell, J.)). Finally, the Court\nwas mindful that because “‘[a] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do\naway with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race’ . . . race-conscious\nadmissions policies must be limited in time.” Id. at 341–42 (quoting Palmore v. Sidoti,\n466 U.S. 429, 432 (1984)).\n\n       The Court also indicated that the ability to fashion a time limit on the use of race-\nconscious admissions policies is not a tool placed primarily in the hands of the courts.\nRather, it is first and foremost in the hands of states and their public universities. See\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 43\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 342 (“[T]he durational requirement can be met by sunset provisions\nin race-conscious academic polices and periodic reviews to determine whether racial\npreferences are still necessary to achieve student body diversity.”); see also id.\n(describing state-law prohibitions on the use of racial preferences in admissions in\nCalifornia, Florida, and Washington). Indeed, the Court has repeatedly confirmed that\nthe repeal or modification of race-related polices does not necessarily run afoul of the\nEqual Protection Clause. See Hunter, 393 U.S. at 390 n.5; Washington v. Seattle Sch.\nDist. No. 1, 458 U.S. 457, 483 (1982) (“[T]he simple repeal or modification of\ndesegregation or antidiscrimination laws, without more, has never been viewed as\nembodying a presumptively invalid racial classification.” (quoting Crawford v. Bd. of\nEduc., 458 U.S. 527, 539 (1982))). A state or university may conclude, for example, that\nthe use of racial preferences may no longer be necessary to further the interest in\ndiversity, that the burdens associated with those preferences are too heavy, or that the\nmeans employed no longer enjoy legitimacy in the eyes of the people. And, as was the\ncase with the California prohibition mentioned by the Court, it follows that a state or its\nelectorate may act to impose a time limit, or end the use of racial preferences outright,\nwhen its public universities have not. See Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, 122 F.3d\n692 (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n       It is from this legal backdrop that the popular effort to amend the Michigan\nConstitution to prevent the use of affirmative action in admissions developed. Taking\nit into account, we must turn to whether Michigan’s repeal of this type of racial\nclassification by constitutional amendment violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       As an initial matter, a broad view of plaintiff’s contentions provides context and\na bit of common sense about the requirements of the Constitution. Plaintiffs’ argument\nis that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits Michigan from prohibiting discrimination\nin admissions to public colleges and universities through the passage of Proposal 2.\nCalling an admissions practice a preference does not transform the practice into a\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 44\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nnondiscriminatory one; preferences do indeed permit discrimination. Yet, we know that\nthe Equal Protection Clause prevents “official conduct discriminating on the basis of\nrace.” Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976).\n\n        Grutter and Gratz represent the Supreme Court’s response to a university’s use\nof racial preferences in admissions and together develop the circumstances under which\npolicies that take race into account may be used. The burden on the university is a\ndifficult one; it may use race as a factor only when there is a compelling interest in doing\nso and when the use is narrowly tailored. Racial preferences are not favored under the\nlaw but must be exactingly justified. No constitutional jurisprudence exists that requires\ntheir use. And, as the Supreme Court has told us, “the Equal Protection Clause is not\nviolated by the mere repeal of race-related legislation or policies that were not required\nby the Federal Constitution in the first place.” Crawford, 458 U.S. at 538–39.\n\n        Within this broad constitutional landscape, plaintiffs contend that passage of\nProposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause. They base their argument on Hunter\nand Seattle. These cases, without a doubt, secure racial minorities the right to equal\nprocess within the political arena. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391.\nThey prohibit a “distortion of the political process,” Crawford, 458 U.S. at 538 n.14, by\nwhich a state “disadvantage[s] [a] particular group by making it more difficult to enact\nlegislation in its behalf,” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 476 (quotation marks and citation omitted),\nby “mak[ing] use of a more complex governmental structure,” id. at 477, or “lodging\ndecisionmaking authority over the question at a new and remote level of government,”\nid. at 483. But they do not guarantee that racial minorities will win every political battle.\nId. at 484 (“If a governmental institution is to be fair, one group cannot always be\nexpected to win . . . .” (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 394 (Harlan, J., concurring))). Nor\ndo they hold that the repeal of those policies is impermissible, although they may be\npreferred by significant numbers of racial minorities. Rather, Hunter, Seattle, and\nCrawford outline the constitutional limits on a particular type of political restructuring:\nthe enactment of comparative structural burdens on “the ability of minority groups to\nachieve beneficial legislation.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467. Because these cases do not\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 45\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nprohibit “every attempt to address a racial issue, ” id. at 485, it is important to consider\nthe limiting bounds of this type of political restructuring challenge.\n\n                                             A.\n\n        In reviewing a Hunter political process challenge, we must, of course, consider\nwhether the particular legislation or popular referendum at issue serves to impermissibly\n“distort” the state’s political processes. Crawford, 458 U.S. at 541. Seattle makes clear\nthat “the voters of the polity may express their displeasure through an established\nlegislative or referendum procedure when particular legislation arouses passionate\nopposition.” 458 U.S. at 483 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The state\nor its voters, however, may not “make[] the enactment of racially beneficial legislation\ndifficult” by “lodging decisionmaking authority over the question at a new and remote\nlevel of government.” Id. And they may “no more disadvantage any particular group\nby making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than [they] may dilute any\nperson’s vote.” Id. at 476 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 392–93). Seattle and Hunter\ntherefore protect “the ability of minorities to participate in the process of self-\ngovernment.” Id. at 480 n.23.\n\n        In Hunter, the impermissible political restructuring took the form of a more\nburdensome extra step in the City of Akron’s legislative process. The people of Akron\nhad amended their city charter by popular referendum to require that any city ordinance\nregulating real property “on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or ancestry”\nbe subject to approval by a mandatory popular referendum, while all other ordinances\nregulating real estate only required the approval of the City Council. Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 387, 390. The Hunter Court concluded that this amounted to an unconstitutional\npolitical restructuring because the charter amendment “obviously made it substantially\nmore difficult to secure enactment of ordinances” barring discrimination in real estate.\nId. at 390. Indeed, those minority voters supporting property-related anti-discrimination\nordinances would not only have to win a legislative battle in the Akron City Council, but\nthey would then have to win a public-referendum battle as well. Id. The default political\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                     Page 46\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nstructure entrenched in the mechanisms of a city council, which may allow for\nparticularized and localized electoral pressure on individual council members, was\ntherefore supplemented with the far more diffuse, and potentially onerous, political\nstructure inherent in winning popular approval of a law with a discrete set of immediate\nbeneficiaries.\n\n         In Seattle, the voters of the state effectuated a more implicit restructuring of the\nlegislative process. In the 1970s, the locally elected Seattle school board passed and\nimplemented a series of school desegregation programs aimed at alleviating the isolation\nof minority students caused by segregated housing patterns. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 459–60.\nIn 1977, local opponents of these measures, having previously failed in their attempt to\nrecall School Board members who had voted for desegregation programs, id. at 460 n.1,\norganized to end Seattle’s use of the programs at the statewide level, id. at 461–62.\nTheir statewide initiative provided that local school boards could not employ mandatory\ndesegregative busing except possibly when required as part of a judicial decree. Id. at\n462–63. In enacting this initiative, the people of Washington thus moved the locus of\npolitical authority over this particular issue from the local to the statewide level,\n“requir[ing] those championing school integration to surmount a considerably higher\nhurdle than persons seeking comparable legislative action.” Id. at 474.\n\n         In both cases where the Court found an impermissible political restructuring, the\nrelevant lawmaking authority was reallocated from a local legislative body to the “more\ncomplex government structure,” id. at 477, of the city- or state-wide general electorate,1\nthereby placing a “comparative structural burden . . . on the political achievement of\nminority interests,” id. at 475 n.17. A key consideration in analyzing a Hunter political\nstructure challenge, therefore, is whether the challenged law impacts the ability of\nminorities to secure “legislation that is their interest” as minorities. Id. at 474; see also\nid. at 475 n.17 (“Thus, in Hunter, the procedures for enacting racial legislation were\nmodified in a such a way as to place effective control in the hands of the citywide\n\n         1\n          In Seattle, Initiative 350 could also have been repealed by the state legislature after a period of\ntwo years. See 458 U.S. at 463 n.4.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Given the structural considerations inherent in this type of Equal\nProtection challenge, it is important to fully examine the particular political structures\nat work in this case to determine whether the people of Michigan have restructured the\nstate’s lawmaking process in the manner prohibited by Hunter and Seattle.\n\n                                                     i.\n\n         “The Michigan Constitution confers a unique constitutional status on [its] public\nuniversities and their governing boards.” Federated Publ’ns, Inc. v. Bd. of Trustees of\nMich. State Univ., 594 N.W.2d 491, 495–96 (Mich. 1999) (citing Mich. Const. art. VIII,\n§§ 5 and 6). The status of these boards has been described by the Michigan Supreme\nCourt as “the highest form of juristic person known to the law, a constitutional\ncorporation of independent authority, which, within the scope of its functions, is co-\nordinate with and equal to that of the legislature.” Id. at 496 n.8 (quoting Bd. of Regents\nof the Univ. of Mich. v. Auditor Gen., 132 N.W. 1037, 1039 (Mich. 1911)). Each\ngoverning board is vested with the power of “general supervision of its institutions and\nthe control and direction of all expenditures from the institution’s funds.”2 Mich. Const.\nart. VIII, § 5. With this power comes significant independence, as the state constitution\n“limit[s] the Legislature’s power” over the universities such that it “may not interfere\nwith the management and control of” the universities. Federated Publ’ns, 594 N.W.2d\nat 497 (quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the “constitutional autonomy\nof these institutions is plenary as to its educational programs, but does not insulate them\nfrom the health and safety laws of the state.” 1979-1980 Mich.

Att’y Gen. 578,\n1980 WL 114008 (1980); see also Federated Publ’ns, 594 N.W.2d at 497.\n\n\n         2\n           The Michigan Constitution divides its state public universities into two categories. The first\ncategory, detailed in Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5, consists of the University of Michigan, Michigan State\nUniversity, and Wayne State University. The second category includes “other institutions of higher\neducation established by law having authority to grant baccalaureate degrees.” Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 6.\nThis category includes, for example, Eastern Michigan University, Central Michigan University, and\nGrand Valley State University. See Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 4 (listing universities for which the state\nlegislature shall appropriate moneys). Because the Plaintiffs focus on the universities described in section\nfive, and because it is unclear from the record whether the universities described in section six employ\nrace-conscious admissions policies, the following discussion will primarily pertain to the University of\nMichigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/          Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 48\n1534; 09-1111               Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n         The constitution provides for eight-member governing boards, elected to\nstatewide office for eight-year terms.3 Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5. Elections are\ntypically staggered, with, for example, an election every two years for regents of the\nUniversity        of     Michigan.            See     About        the     Board       of    Regents,\nhttp://www.regents.umich.edu/about/ (last visited May 4, 2011); MSU Board of\nTrustees, http://www.trustees.msu.edu/about/establishment.html (last visited May 4,\n2011); About the Board of Governors, http://bog.wayne.edu/about.php (last visited May\n4, 2011).\n\n         As a preliminary matter, the majority suggests that our examination of the\npertinent political structures must end with the Michigan Constitution. The majority\nopinion concludes that we may not rely on the testimony of university officials because\nthe structure of the colleges and universities is a “question of law, for it is set by\nconstitution, statutes and regulations.” (Maj. Op. at 22.) Here, the nature of the\ndecision-making process for admissions is one of both law and fact, and the witnesses\ngave instructive testimony that was within their personal knowledge.4 Examination of\nthe record is appropriate to ascertain how the decisions at issue are in fact made.\n\n         Although these universities and their respective boards are created by the\nMichigan Constitution, the admissions policies are placed within the control of the\nboards or school authorities only within each board’s bylaws. See University of\nMichigan Board of Regents, Bylaws Chapter VIII: Admission and Registration of\nStudents, http://www.regents.umich.edu/bylaws/bylaws08.html (last visited May 4,\n2011) (vesting responsibility for the admission of students in the associate vice provost\nand executive director of undergraduate admissions at the Ann Arbor campus, in the\ndirector of admissions and orientation at the Dearborn campus, and in the director of\n\n         3\n         By contrast, the governing boards of the other state universities are appointed by the governor\nby and with the advice and consent of the state senate. Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 6.\n         4\n          Oddly, the majority characterizes this testimony as opinion testimony inadmissible under Federal\nRule of Evidence 701. To the extent the witnesses offered opinions, which were hardly the thrust of their\ntestimony, their lay opinions were perfectly admissible. Any opinions were rationally based on the\nwitnesses’ perceptions, helpful to an understanding of the testimony or a fact in issue, and not based on\nthe specialized knowledge of experts.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 49\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nundergraduate admissions at the Flint campus); Michigan State University Board of\nTrustees, Bylaws, http://www.trustees.msu.edu/bylaws/#article8 (last visited May 4,\n2011) (“The [MSU] Board encourages and supports the faculty in the development of\neducational and other programs . . . . Upon the recommendation of the President the\nBoard may determine and establish the qualifications of students for admission at any\nlevel . . . .”); Wayne State University Board of Governors, Statutes,\nhttp://bog.wayne.edu/code/2_34_09.php (last visited May 4, 2011) (“After consultation\nwith the College or School, the [Board-elected] President or his/her designee is\nauthorized to establish specific admissions standards for degree programs.”). Thus, the\nadmissions policies are not set forth by the state constitution, and it is necessary to look\nto testimony to determine where the power to set admissions policy lies.\n\n        The governing boards have fully delegated the responsibility for establishing\nadmissions standards to several program-specific administrative units within each\ninstitution, which set admissions criteria through informal processes that can include a\nfaculty vote. (DE 172, Pls.’ Russ. Mot., Ex. I (Univ. Defs.’ Resp.) Nos. 4, 7; DE 203,\nPls.’ SJ Mot., Ex. E. (Zearfoss Dep.) at 64, 213–14, Ex. F. (Wu Dep.) at 190–91.) For\nexample, as noted by the majority, the University of Michigan Law School admissions\npolicy is set exclusively by the law school faculty admissions committee, with major\nsubstantive changes occasionally voted upon by the entire law school faculty. (Maj. Op.\nat 25 (referring to the admissions committees as “the individuals delegated with principle\nresponsibility for admissions policy”); Zearfoss Dep. at 213.) Similarly, as described by\nits former dean, at the Wayne State University Law School the ultimate decision whether\nto change admissions standards rests with the faculty alone. (Wu Dep. at 190–91.)\nThus, as the Cantrell Plaintiffs readily admit, the “faculty are the primary architects of\nall the admissions criteria and protocols.” (Reply Br. at 20 n.11.)\n\n        At neither university, however, is there a system in place to review or alter\nadmissions policies at a level above a vote of the faculty. Sarah Zearfoss, the dean of\nadmissions at the University of Michigan Law School, testified that no one could change\nthe school’s admissions policy other than the faculty admissions committee or the faculty\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 50\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nitself, because “there’s no higher body” to which someone unhappy with an admissions\npolicy could advocate change. (Zearfoss Dep. at 214.) And Frank Wu, then the dean at\nWayne State University Law School, agreed that “only the faculty at the law school has\nthe authority to create and approve the admissions policy” at the school. (Wu Dep. at\n191.) Indeed, Wu testified that the admissions policy is not subject to the approval of\nthe Wayne State University Board of Governors, and, in his view, if the Board of\nGovernors attempted to alter the decision of the law school’s faculty with respect to\ncriteria for admission, “it would precipitate a constitutional crisis.” (Wu Dep. at 192.)\nEach institution’s board may superficially have “plenary authority” over its respective\ninstitution (see Maj. Op. at 21), but the ultimate authority to set admissions policy rests\nexclusively with each program-specific faculty within the universities.\n\n                                            ii.\n\n        The majority characterizes the dissent as reading Hunter and Seattle too narrowly\nby defining the political processes with which they deal as “electoral” processes. While\nthe political processes in Hunter and Seattle are electoral in the sense that they relate to\nwhat electoral methods are employed to make policy, the majority opinion, not the\ndissent, draws the line between political and electoral. The point is simply that the\nsituation here differs greatly from that of Hunter and Seattle in the ways described in this\nopinion; these program-specific faculty admissions committees are far afield from the\nlegislative bodies from which lawmaking authority was removed in Hunter and Seattle.\nThe most crucial and overarching difference, of course, is that the faculty admissions\ncommittees and individual faculty members are not politically accountable to the people\nof Michigan.\n\n        In Seattle, the court emphasized that the type of action it found objectionable was\nthe creation of comparative burdens “on minority participation in the political process.”\n458 U.S. at 480 n.23; see id. at 486 (“[M]inorities are no less powerless with the vote\nthan without it when a racial criterion is used to assign governmental power in such a\nway as to exclude particular racial groups ‘from effective participation in the political\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 51\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nproces[s].’” (quoting Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 94 (1980) (White, J., dissenting))).\nThe Seattle majority, however, did not view state university admissions committees as\na part of the “political process” in the manner of an elected school board or city council.\nA dialogue between the majority and dissent in Seattle is particularly instructive on this\npoint. In dissent, Justice Powell, critiquing the potential breadth of the majority’s\nholding, argued:\n\n        Thus, if the admissions committee of a state law school developed an\n        affirmative-action plan that came under fire, the Court apparently would\n        find it unconstitutional for any higher authority to intervene unless that\n        authority traditionally dictated admissions policies. As a constitutional\n        matter, the dean of the law school, the faculty of the university as a\n        whole, the university president, the chancellor of the university, and the\n        board of regents might be powerless to intervene despite their greater\n        authority under state law.\n\nId. at 498 n.14 (Powell, J., dissenting). The majority, however, flatly dismissed this\nconcern as a misunderstanding of the court’s decision: “It is evident, then, that the\nhorribles paraded by the dissent, post, at [footnote 14 of the dissent]—which have\nnothing to do with the ability of minorities to participate in the process of self-\ngovernment—are entirely unrelated to this case.” Id. at 480 n.23 (emphasis added).\n\n        For the Seattle majority, then, an impermissible reordering of the political\nprocess meant a reordering of the processes through which the people exercise their right\nto govern themselves. See id. at 486 (“And when the State’s allocation of power places\nunusual burdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legislation specifically designed\nto overcome the ‘special condition’ of prejudice, the governmental action seriously\n‘curtail[s] the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect\nminorities’ . . . from the ‘majoritarian political process.’” (emphasis added) (citing\nUnited States v. Carolene Prods. Co. 304 U.S. 144, 153 n.4 (1938) and San Antonio\nIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriquez, 411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973))); id. at 467 (“But the Fourteenth\nAmendment also reaches a “political structure that treats all individuals as equals . . . yet\nmore subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 52\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\non the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” (emphasis added)\n(quoting Bolden, 446 U.S. at 84)).\n\n       The evidence reveals that the academic processes at work in state university\nadmissions in Michigan are not “political processes” in the manner contemplated in\nSeattle. Unlike the Seattle School Board and the Akron City Council, the various\nuniversity admissions committees in Michigan and their faculty members are unelected.\nAs at most public universities, tenured faculty members have significant vested rights\nassociated with their employment in order to preserve academic freedom and\nindependence. The faculty members who are permitted to vote on policy matters are\ntherefore significantly insulated from political pressure by virtue of their tenure. Such\nfaculty are beholden to no constituency—student, local, or otherwise.           And, as\ndemonstrated by the testimony of the law school deans in this case, the people of\nMichigan have no ability to exert electoral pressure on the university decision makers\nto change their admissions polices. As they currently stand, the faculty admissions\ncommittees are islands unto themselves, vested with the full and unreviewed authority\nto set admissions policy for their respective university programs.\n\n       The majority opinion discounts the differences between facts here and those of\nHunter and Seattle by arguing that processes are considered “political” as long as there\nis “governmental decisionmaking.” In this argument it relies on Nyquist v. Lee, 318 F.\nSupp. 710 (W.D.N.Y. 1970), aff’d Nyquist v. Lee, 402 U.S. 935 (1971), a case from the\nWestern District of New York that was summarily affirmed by the Supreme Court and\ncited in Seattle. In Nyquist, the court found that a New York statute that “prohibit[ed]\nstate education officials and appointed school boards from assigning students, or\nestablishing, reorganizing or maintaining school districts, school zones or attendance\nunits for the purpose of achieving racial equality in attendance” unconstitutionally\nreordered the political process in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Nyquist, 318\nF. Supp. at 712, 720. The majority suggests that because appointed school boards were\npart of the political process at issue in Nyquist, the university faculty admissions\ncommittees are similarly part of the political process. (Maj. Op. at 20.) The decision in\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/         Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                 Page 53\n1534; 09-1111              Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nNyquist, however, made note of how the local boards were accountable to the\ncommunity: “Parties considering themselves aggrieved by local board actions may seek\nto have the Commissioner enforce those policies. [The New York statute], however,\nsingles out for different treatment all plans which have as their purpose the assignment\nof students in order to alleviate racial imbalance.” Id. at 719 (internal citations omitted).\nThus, even the appointed school boards were accountable to the community in a way in\nwhich the faculty admissions committees certainly are not. Again, the point is not\nselecting a label for the processes, but examining the factual similarities or dissimilarities\nof the situations.\n\n        There is no “local” university constituency as there is a local constituency for a\ncity council or city school board, i.e., the city’s voters. Rather, despite there being a\nbroad student, faculty, and staff community associated with each university, Michigan’s\nstate universities were established as state-wide institutions with a state-wide\nconstituency.5 The faculty admissions committees therefore do not “represent” any local\nconstituency at all. This is particularly important because the Seattle majority looked\nclosely at the fact that Washington’s lodging of political decisionmaking authority over\nthe busing question at the statewide level directly burdened minority interests by\n“making the enactment of racially beneficial legislation difficult, [because] the particular\nprogram might not have inspired opposition had it been promulgated through the usual\n[local] legislative processes used for comparable legislation.” 458 U.S. at 483–84. The\ncourt continued:\n\n        That phenomenon is graphically demonstrated by the circumstances of\n        this litigation. The longstanding desegregation programs in Pasco and\n        Tacoma, as well as the Seattle middle school integration plan, have\n        functioned for years without creating undue controversy. Yet they have\n        been swept away, along with the Seattle Plan, by Initiative 350. As a\n        practical matter, it seems most unlikely that proponents of desegregative\n        busing in small communities such as Tacoma or Pasco will be able to\n\n\n\n        5\n        Indeed, some students, prospective students, alumni, and faculty members at each university are\nnot members of that state-wide constituency, comprised of citizens and voters of the state of Michigan.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 54\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       obtain the statewide support now needed to permit them to desegregate\n       the schools in their communities.\n\nId. at 484 n.27. The availability of “local” decisionmaking is therefore important when\nthe political power of groups who could succeed at the local level is “diluted” in the\nstatewide decisionmaking process. The universities here, however, are statewide\ninstitutions with a statewide constituency. There is nothing local about them.\n\n       The committees are also hardly the model of accessibility and locus of effective\nlobbying assumed by the majority. While members of the public may attend faculty\nmeetings at which admissions standards are reviewed, there is no mechanism by which\na member of the public—student or not—can move the committees to amend the\nadmissions standards. (Wu Dep. at 190; Zearfoss Dep. at 209.) And, while interested\nstudents and members of the public are, with advance notice, permitted to speak at\nfaculty meetings to comment on the admissions policies, the committees are not required\nto consider these comments seriously, issue written findings addressing these concerns,\nor do more than provide a forum for interested individuals to speak. (Zearfoss Dep. at\n209–10; Wu Dep. at 190.) Rather, it appears that the main source of divergent views on\nadmissions policies is the faculty members themselves. (Zearfoss Dep. at 210.)\n\n       While the majority appears to see no reason to distinguish between these\nunelected and unresponsive program-specific faculty admissions committees and the\nlegislative bodies from which lawmaking authority was removed in Hunter and Seattle,\na consideration of political accountability in the political process is squarely grounded\nin the Seattle opinion.    In Seattle, the Court undertook a close examination of\nWashington’s system of “establish[ing] the local school board, rather than the State, as\nthe entity charged with making decisions of the type at issue,” 458 U.S. at 477:\n\n       But Washington has chosen to meet its educational responsibilities\n       primarily through “state and local officials, boards, and committees,” and\n       the responsibility to devise and tailor educational programs to suit local\n       needs has emphatically been vested in the local school boards. . . . Thus\n       “each common school district board of directors” is made “accountable\n       for the proper operation of [its] district to the local community and its\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 55\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       electorate.” To this end, each school board is “vested with the final\n       responsibility for the setting of policies ensuring quality in the content\n       and the extent of its educational program.”\n\nId. at 478 (citations omitted) (emphasis added); see also id. (noting the “disclosure and\nreporting provisions specifically designed to ensure the board’s ‘accountability’ to the\npeople of the community” (emphasis added)). It was only upon its consideration of the\nstate statutory structure’s vesting of decisionmaking in local and politically accountable\nschool boards that the Court could conclude that “placing power over desgregative\nbusing at the state level . . . restructured the Washington political process.” Id. at 480.\n\n       Taking this into account, it is difficult to conclude that, in amending their state\nconstitution to prohibit the use of racial preferences in university admissions, the people\nof Michigan modified “the community’s political mechanisms . . . to place effective\ndecisionmaking authority over a racial issue at another level of government.” Id. at 474\n(emphasis added). Michigan has not “‘burden[d] all future attempts’ to implement race-\nconscious admissions policies” “‘by lodging decisionmaking authority over the question\nat a new and remote level of government.’” (Maj. Op. at 28 (quoting Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 483).) Having no direct or indirect influence on the bodies vested with authority to\nset admissions standards—the faculty committees—the people of Michigan made a\npolitical change at the only level of government actually available to them as voters. The\nMichigan electorate, therefore, as opposed to choosing a more complex structure for\nlawmaking, employed the one method available to exert electoral pressure on the\nmechanisms of government.\n\n       The lack of a viable electoral mechanism to change university admissions\npolicies at a sub-constitutional level also means that the voters’ use of a constitutional\namendment in this instance also does not serve to create “comparative structural\nburden[s] on the political achievement of minority interests.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474\nn.17. If, as is the evidence before this court, the voters cannot exert electoral pressure\non the fully independent faculty committees, then all voters regardless of racial identity\ncompete on the same level for the political achievement of their higher-education\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 56\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ninterests: the constitutional level. That some academic decisionmaking remains at the\nfaculty-committee level after the implementation of Proposal 2 is of no moment, because\nthat decisionmaking is affirmatively not part of the state’s electoral political process.\nThe same policies that fully insulate faculty members from political opprobrium in their\nacademic pursuits also protect them from political influence on their admissions\npolicymaking. Michigan has chosen to structure its university system such that politics\nplays no part in university admissions at all levels within its constitutionally created\nuniversities. The Michigan voters have therefore not restructured the political process\nin their state by amending their state constitution; they have merely employed it.6\n\n                                                   III.\n\n         If Proposal 2 does not effectuate an invalid restructuring of Michigan’s political\nprocess, it is not necessary to reach broader questions relating to the substantive reach\nof the political restructuring doctrine. But again returning to the broader context, it is\nuseful to highlight the tension between the doctrine and recent decisional law on the\nconstitutionality of racial preferences.\n\n         Several courts have grappled with the question of whether racial preferences,\nthose policies “potentially so dangerous” that they must be subject to strict scrutiny and\n“limited in time,” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342, may be eliminated when the people of a state\namend their constitution to do away with all classifications based on race. The core\n\n\n         6\n           Even if—contrary to the evidence before the court—the people of Michigan could exercise\neffective electoral control over the board of governors at each respective state institution such that they\ncould repeal the use of racial preferences, it is not clear that a choice to make use of a constitutional\namendment in that instance would amount to the creation of a comparative political burden on the\nachievement of minority interests. Indeed, it would make use of neither a more complex or onerous\nstructure of government nor remove the locus of political power from the local to statewide level. Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 477, 480. Given the eight-year terms and staggered elections for board members, and the fact\nthat electoral change must happen at the governing board of each individual state university, the process\nof effectuating political change through the board of governors appears to be arguably a more complex\nprocess than the comparative burden of a statewide referendum. And both types of elections—the board\nmember elections and the constitutional referendum—occur at the statewide level with an electorate\ncomposed of the at-large statewide voting pool. There are therefore no inherent structural benefits or\nprotections for minority voters in one system over the other. As opposed to the multi-district Akron city\ncouncil in Hunter, for example, there is no mechanism by which minority voters could exercise bloc or\nregional voting in the board of governors system in a way that they could not in the state’s constitutional\nreferendum process. The use of the constitutional amendment mechanism, therefore, would not work to\ncreate a comparative political burden of the kind found in Hunter and Seattle.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 57\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nconstitutional question in each of these decisions is clear: should a race-based\nclassification that is presumptively invalid, but permissible under limited circumstances\nand for a finite period of time, receive the same structural protections against statewide\npopular repeal as other laws that inure to the interest of minorities?\n\n        The Ninth Circuit in Wilson answered in the negative, concluding that\nCalifornia’s Proposition 209 did not violate equal protection because “[i]mpediments to\npreferential treatment do not deny equal protection.” 122 F.3d at 708. The court relied\non an essential constitutional principle: “While the Constitution protects against\nobstructions to equal treatment, it erects obstructions to preferential treatment by its own\nterms. . . . The Equal Protection Clause, parked at our most ‘distant and remote’ level\nof government, singles out racial preferences for severe political burdens—it prohibits\nthem in all but the most compelling circumstances.” Id. The California Supreme Court\nrecently agreed with this conclusion, holding that “Seattle cannot fairly be read as\nholding that the political structure doctrine protects presumptively unconstitutional racial\npreferences, as opposed to programs intended to bring about immediate equal treatment.”\nCoral Constr., Inc. v. San Francisco, 235 P.3d 947, 960 (Cal. 2010). This logic has been\nfurther cemented by the Northern District of California, reinforcing the holding in\nWilson in light of Grutter. In Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and\nImmigrant Rights v. Schwarzenneger, No. 10-641 SC, 2010 WL 5094278 (N.D. Cal.\nDec. 8, 2010), the federal district court stated, “Grutter does not hold that the\nConstitution requires the use of race in student admission decision; rather, it holds that\nthe Constitution tolerates the use of race as one of many admission factors.” Id. at *6.\nThe court went on to note, “Grutter held that racial preferences, while not presumptively\nunconstitutional, must be limited in time. In so holding, the Supreme Court cited the\n‘race neutral alternatives’ to racial preferences used by ‘[universities], where racial\npreferences are prohibited by state law.’” Id. (citing Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342) (internal\ncitations omitted).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/          Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 58\n1534; 09-1111               Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n         These cases take the same approach as the district court in this case,7 and their\nteaching is that equal treatment is the baseline rule embodied in the Equal Protection\nClause, from which racial-preference programs are a departure. We therefore must\nreview them with utmost care. Governing precedent is clear on this point: “‘A core\npurpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally imposed\ndiscrimination based on race,’” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341–42 (quoting Palmore, 466 U.S.\nat 432), and “all governmental use of race must have a logical end point,” id. at 342.\nBecause racial preference programs are exceptional, it is not altogether clear that the\npolitical structure doctrine would invalidate Proposal 2 even if it worked a restructuring\nof the political process in Michigan. See Coral, 235 P.3d at 966 (Corrigan, J.,\nconcurring) (noting that the United States Supreme Court has “approvingly referred to\n[California’s Proposition 209] as a step in [the] direction” of ending the “governmental\nuse of race” (citing Grutter, 538 U.S. at 342)). However, because Proposal 2 itself\nworks no improper political restructuring under the circumstances before us, we need not\naddress that issue today.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n         It should also be noted that Proposal 2 is constitutional under a traditional equal\nprotection analysis. Because the majority’s holding turns on the political restructuring\nanalysis, it declines to address this issue.\n\n         “The central purpose of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment is the prevention of official conduct discriminating on the basis of race.”\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976). We apply strict scrutiny to those laws\nthat racially classify individuals, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 216\n(1995), and intermediate scrutiny to those laws that classify individuals based on gender,\nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531 (1996). Racial classifications are subject\nto strict scrutiny if (1) the law classifies on its face or (2) the law has a discriminatory\n\n         7\n          “[A]ffirmative action programs not mandated by the obligation to cure past discrimination are\nfundamentally different than laws intended to protect against discrimination.” Coal. to Defend Affirmative\nAction v. Regents of the Univ. of Mich., 539 F. Supp. 2d 924, 957 (E.D. Mich. 2008).\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 59\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nimpact and a discriminatory purpose. See Davis, 426 U.S. at 241. The district court\nconcluded that Proposal 2, which prohibits racial classifications, a fortiori does not\nclassify facially on the basis of race. Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, 539 F. Supp.\n2d at 951. Although the district court did find “sufficient evidence to establish a fact\nquestion on the disparate impact part of the test,” it did not find a discriminatory\npurpose. Id. Indeed, it stated that “the demonstration of a discriminatory purpose . . .\ndooms [the] conventional equal protection argument.” Id. Furthermore, the district\ncourt found the equal protection argument based on gender “even less compelling” due\nto the less exacting level of scrutiny. Id. at 952. I agree with the conclusions of the\ndistrict court.\n\n        Proposal 2 does not establish a facial racial classification because its text does\nnot draw distinctions on the basis of race; in fact, it prohibits them. Additionally,\nProposal 2 does not classify racially on an impact theory because it lacks a\ndiscriminatory purpose. “[A]bsent a referendum that facially discriminates racially, or\none where although facially neutral, the only possible rationale is racially motivated, a\ndistrict court cannot inquire into the electorate’s motivations in an equal protection\nclause context.” Arthur v. Toledo, 782 F.2d 565, 574 (6th Cir. 1986). Thus, no\nheightened level of scrutiny need be applied to Proposal 2, and under rational basis\nreview, Proposal 2 is easily justifiable. Proposal 2 does not violate the Equal Protection\nClause under the conventional analysis.\n\n                                             V.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, I would conclude that Proposal 2 does not violate the\nEqual Protection Clause of the United States Constitution under either a political\nrestructuring theory or traditional theory of Equal Protection. Accordingly, I would\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\f",

Proposal 2 is a successful voter-initiated amendment to\nthe Michigan Constitution. In relevant part, it prohibits Michigan’s public colleges and\nuniversities from granting “preferential treatment to[] any individual or group on the\nbasis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin.” Mich. Const. art. I, § 26. Our task\nis to determine whether Proposal 2 is constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause\nof the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Fortunately, the slate\nis not blank. The Supreme Court has twice held that equal protection does not permit\nthe kind of political restructuring that Proposal 2 effected. See Washington v. Seattle\nSch. Dist.

BACKGROUND\n\n           A. Factual Background\n\n           These appeals are the latest chapter in the battle over the use of race-conscious\nadmissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities. This saga began\nduring the 1960s and 1970s, when African-American and other minority students and\ncitizens first successfully lobbied for the adoption of these policies. The policies\nremained largely in place until challenges to them in the late 1990s, culminating in the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Gratz v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130154\"><a href=\"/opinion/130154/gratz-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), and Grutter v.\nBollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003), which held that “universities cannot establish quotas for\nmembers of certain racial groups” or treat their applications uniquely. Grutter, 539 U.S.\nat 334. But the universities may “consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a ‘plus’\nfactor in the context of individualized consideration,” along with other relevant factors.\nId.\n\n           Following these decisions, Ward Connerly, a former University of California\nRegent who had championed a proposition in California similar to the one at issue here,\nand Jennifer Gratz, the lead plaintiff in Gratz, mobilized to place on Michigan’s\nNovember 2006 statewide ballot a proposal to amend the Michigan Constitution “to\nprohibit all sex- and race-based preferences in public education, public employment, and\npublic contracting.” Operation King’s Dream v.

The initiative—officially designated Proposal 06-2 but commonly known as\n“Proposal 2”—was characterized as a proposal “to amend the State Constitution to ban\naffirmative action programs.” See Notice of State Proposals for November 7, 2006\nGeneral Election, http://www.michigan.gov/documents/sos/ED-138_State_Prop_11-\n06_174276_7.pdf, at 5 (last visited June 24, 2011).

Const. art. I, § 26. It took effect in December 2006 and wrought two significant\nchanges to the admissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities. First,\nit forced them to modify the policies they had in place for nearly a half-century to\nremove consideration of “race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin” in admissions\ndecisions. No other admissions criteria—for example, grades, athletic ability, or family\nalumni connections—suffered the same fate. Second, Proposal 2 entrenched this\nprohibition at the state constitutional level, thus preventing the public colleges and\nuniversities or their boards from revisiting this issue without repeal or modification of\nProposal 2. We review these changes later in greater detail, and there discuss their\nsignificance.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 6\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        B. Procedural Background\n\n        The litigation surrounding Proposal 2 has been lengthy and complicated. On\nNovember 8, 2006, the day after Proposal 2’s approval, a collection of interest groups\nand individuals, including the Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration and\nImmigration Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means Necessary (“Coalition\nPlaintiffs”), filed suit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nMichigan. They named as defendants then-Governor Jennifer Granholm, the Regents\nof the University of Michigan, the Board of Trustees of Michigan State University, and\nthe Board of Governors of Wayne State University (“University Defendants”) and\nalleged that the provisions of Proposal 2 affecting public colleges and universities\nviolated the United States Constitution and federal statutory law. About one month later,\nthe Michigan Attorney General (“Attorney General”) filed a motion to intervene as a\ndefendant; the court granted his motion the same day.\n\n        On December 19, 2006, a group of faculty members and prospective and current\nstudents at the University of Michigan (“the Cantrell Plaintiffs”) filed a similar suit in\nthe United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against then\nGovernor Granholm. Eric Russell, then an applicant to the University of Michigan Law\nSchool, and Toward A Fair Michigan (“TAFM”), a non-profit corporation formed to\nensure implementation of Proposal 2, intervened in the litigation as defendants soon\nthereafter. The district court consolidated the two cases on January 5, 2007, and the\nAttorney General was permitted to intervene in the Cantrell lawsuit as part of the\nconsolidation order. Because the Attorney General effectively replaced then-Governor\nGranholm as the representative of Michigan in this litigation, both Plaintiffs’ groups\nlater stipulated to her dismissal as a party.\n\n        On December 19, 2006, the district court issued what was, in effect, a\npreliminary injunction, postponing application of Proposal 2 to the universities’\nadmissions and financial-aid policies until July 1, 2007, the conclusion of the 2006-2007\nadmissions and financial-aid cycle. The district court’s order stemmed from a stipulation\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

(Amended Order Granting Temporary Injunction\nand Dismissing Cross-Claim, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 39 (“Coal. I”).) Russell and TAFM,\nwhile awaiting approval as intervenors, opposed the Attorney General’s stipulation and\nsought a stay of the injunction from the district court.

On October 17, 2007, the University Defendants filed a motion asking to be\ndismissed as parties. On November 30, 2007, the Attorney General filed a motion to\ndismiss for lack of standing or, in the alternative, a motion for summary judgment on the\nmerits as to all Plaintiffs. Russell and the Cantrell Plaintiffs likewise filed motions for\nsummary judgment the same day. On March 18, 2008, the district court issued two\norders addressing these motions.\n\n       In the first order, the court denied the University Defendants’ request to be\ndismissed as parties and the Cantrell Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment and\ngranted the Attorney General’s motion for summary judgment, rejecting the Plaintiffs’\narguments that Proposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment to the United States Constitution.

The University Defendants appeal the court’s denial of\ntheir motion to be dismissed as parties. Russell appeals the court’s grant of the Cantrell\nPlaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment dismissing him as a party to the action. The\nCantrell Plaintiffs appeal the court’s grant of the Attorney General’s motion for\nsummary judgment and its denial of their motion for reconsideration. Similarly, the\nCoalition Plaintiffs appeal the court’s grant of the Attorney General’s motion for\nsummary judgment.\n\n                                    II. ANALYSIS\n\n       A. Proposal 2’s Constitutionality\n\n       The Equal Protection Clause provides that no state shall “deny to any person . . .\nthe equal protection of the laws.” U.S. Const. amend. XIV. The Plaintiffs argue that\nProposal 2 violates this provision in two distinct ways. Both Plaintiffs groups argue that\nProposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause by impermissibly restructuring the\npolitical process along racial lines (the “political process” argument), and the Coalition\nPlaintiffs contend that Proposal 2 violates the Equal Protection Clause also by\nimpermissibly classifying individuals on the basis of race (the “traditional” argument).\n\n       We review de novo a district court’s grant of summary judgment and denial of\na motion for reconsideration of that decision.

Page 9\n1534; 09-1111                 Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                   1. “Political Process” Equal Protection Analysis\n\n         The Equal Protection Clause “guarantees racial minorities the right to full\nparticipation in the political life of the community. It is beyond dispute . . . that given\nracial or ethnic groups may not be denied the franchise, or precluded from entering into\nthe political process in a reliable and meaningful manner.”1 Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467.\nBut the Equal Protection Clause reaches even further, and prohibits “a political structure\nthat treats all individuals as equals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in\nsuch a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve\nbeneficial legislation.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “[T]he State\nmay no more disadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult to enact\nlegislation in its behalf than it may dilute any person’s vote or give any group a smaller\nrepresentation than another of comparable size.” Hunter, 393 U.S. at 393.\n\n         The Supreme Court’s statements in Hunter and Seattle clarify that equal\nprotection of the laws is more than a guarantee of equal treatment under the law\nsubstantively. It is also an assurance that the majority may not manipulate the channels\nof change in a manner that places unique burdens on issues of importance to racial\nminorities. In effect, the political process theory hews to the unremarkable belief that,\nwhen two competitors are running a race, one may not require the other to run twice as\nfar, or to scale obstacles not present in the first runner’s course. Ensuring the fairness\n\n\n         1\n           For this reason, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held that legislative enactments that burden\nracial minorities’ ability to participate in the political process may violate the Constitution.

Safeguarding the\nguarantee “that public institutions are open and available to all segments of American\nsociety, including people of all races and ethnicities, represents a paramount government\nobjective.” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 331-32 (quoting Br. for United States as Amicus Curiae\n13).   “Moreover, universities, and in particular, law schools, represent the training\nground for a large number of our Nation’s leaders. . . . [T]o cultivate a set of leaders with\nlegitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry, it is necessary that the path to leadership be\nvisibly open to talented and qualified individuals of every race and ethnicity.” Id. at 332\n(citation omitted). Therefore, in the context of education, we must apply the “political\nprocess” protection with the utmost rigor given the high stakes.\n\n        Of course, the Constitution does not protect minorities from political defeat:\nPolitics necessarily produces winners and losers. We must therefore have some way to\ndifferentiate between the constitutional and the impermissible. And Hunter and Seattle\ndo just that. They provide the benchmark for when the majority has not only won, but\nalso rigged the game to reproduce its success indefinitely.\n\n                        i. Hunter and Seattle\n\n                                a. Hunter\n\n        The Supreme Court in Hunter addressed a situation where the citizens of Akron,\nOhio overturned a fair housing ordinance enacted by the City Council. 393 U.S. at 386.\nThe citizenry did more than merely repeal the ordinance, however. It amended the city\ncharter through a referendum to require the approval of a majority of the electorate\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Id. at 387, 390 n.6. In\nother words, only ordinances based on the identified factors required approval of the\nmajority; ordinances based on any other factor required only a vote by the City Council:\n\n        In essence, the amendment changed the requirements for the adoption of\n        one type of local legislation: to enact an ordinance barring housing\n        discrimination on the basis of race or religion, proponents had to obtain\n        the approval of the City Council and of a majority of the voters citywide.\n        To enact an ordinance preventing housing discrimination on other\n        grounds, or to enact any other type of housing ordinance, proponents\n        needed the support of only the City Council.\n\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 468 (describing Hunter). The effect was not only to halt operation\nof the existing fair housing ordinance, but also to erect a barrier to any similar ordinance\nin the future. Hunter, 393 U.S. at 389.\n\n        The Court found that the disparity between the process for enacting a future fair\nhousing ordinance and that for enacting any other housing ordinance “place[d] special\nburden[s] on racial minorities within the governmental process” by making it\n“substantially more difficult to secure enactment” only of legislation that would be to\ntheir benefit. Id. at 390-91. While the enactment treated “Negro and white, Jew and\ngentile” in an identical manner, the Court found that “the reality is that the law’s impact\nfalls on the minority.” Id. at 391. That the law had been enacted via a popular\nreferendum did not save it from implementing “a real, substantial, and invidious denial\nof the equal protection of the laws.” Id. at 392-93.\n\n                                b. Seattle\n\n        In Seattle, a case identical in many respects to the one we confront here, the\nSupreme Court applied Hunter to strike down a state statute, also enacted via a\nreferendum, that prohibited racially integrative busing.

Nonetheless, the school board implemented the plan\nto accelerate its existing program of voluntary busing, which some constituencies saw\nas insufficiently alleviating racial imbalances. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 460.\n\n        In response, Seattle residents drafted a statewide measure, Initiative 350,\nproviding in relevant part that “no school board . . . shall directly or indirectly require\nany student to attend a school other than the school which is geographically nearest or\nnext nearest the student’s place of residence.” Id. at 462 (alteration in original) (internal\nquotation mark omitted). Though the initiative was worded as a general ban on all forms\nof mandatory busing, its myriad exceptions made its real effect to eliminate school\nreassignments for racial purposes only, except where a court ordered such reassignments\nto remedy unconstitutional segregation. Id. at 462-63 (noting that Initiative 350 was\nphrased so as not to “prevent any court of competent jurisdiction from adjudicating\nconstitutional issues relating to the public schools”). Initiative 350 made it on the\nWashington ballot and passed by a substantial margin, attracting over 65% of the\nstatewide vote.

Page 13\n1534; 09-1111             Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndetermine the decisionmaking process.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 469-70 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Echoing Hunter, the Court explained that this distinct analysis is\nnecessary because such non-neutral allocations of power “place[] special burdens on\nracial minorities within the governmental process, thereby making it more difficult for\ncertain racial and religious minorities than for other members of the community to\nachieve legislation that is in their interest.” Id. at 470 (internal quotation marks, citations,\nand brackets omitted).\n\n        The Court dismissed the argument that Initiative 350 was not intended to prevent\nbusing for racially-integrative purposes, and explained why Initiative 350 violated the\n“simple but central” principle animating Hunter and Nyquist. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 471.\n\n        First, as a threshold matter, the Court concluded that desegregation of the public\nschools, like the fair housing ordinance in Hunter, “at bottom inures primarily to the\nbenefit of the minority, and is designed for that purpose.” Id. at 472. The Court\nreasoned that, while “white as well as Negro children benefit from exposure to ethnic\nand racial diversity in the classroom,” desegregation is of primary benefit to minority\nchildren because these children “can achieve their full measure of success only if they\nlearn to function in—and are fully accepted by—the larger community. Attending an\nethnically diverse school may help accomplish this goal by preparing minority children\nfor citizenship in our pluralistic society.” Id. at 472-73 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). Because racial minorities therefore had reason to “consider busing for\nintegration to be ‘legislation that is in their interest,’” the “racial focus of Initiative 350\n. . . suffices to trigger application of the Hunter doctrine.” Id. at 474 (quoting Hunter,\n393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\n        Second, having concluded that Initiative 350 targeted a busing program that\n“inures primarily to the benefit of the minority,” the Court held that “the practical effect\nof Initiative 350 is to work a reallocation of power of the kind condemned in Hunter.”\nId. As the Court explained, Initiative 350, like the amendment to the city charter in\nHunter, did more than repeal the school board’s busing program:\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 14\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       The initiative removes the authority to address a racial problem—and\n       only a racial problem—from the existing decisionmaking body, in such\n       a way as to burden minority interests. Those favoring the elimination of\n       de facto school segregation now must seek relief from the state\n       legislature, or from the statewide electorate. Yet authority over all other\n       student assignment decisions, as well as over most other areas of\n       educational policy, remains vested in the local school board. . . . As in\n       Hunter, then, the community’s political mechanisms are modified to\n       place effective decisionmaking authority over a racial issue at a different\n       level of government.\n\nId. By removing authority over busing for racial purposes from the school board and\nplacing this authority at a more remote level of government, Initiative 350 required\n“those championing school integration to surmount a considerably higher hurdle than\npersons seeking comparable legislative action,” and disadvantaged “those who would\nbenefit from laws barring de facto desegregation.” Id. at 474-75 (internal quotation mark\nomitted). Accordingly, the Court held that Initiative 350, in placing “special burdens on\nracial minorities,” violated the Equal Protection Clause. Id. at 470.\n\n       In sum, Hunter and Seattle require us to apply strict scrutiny to enactments that\nchange the governmental decisionmaking process for determinations with a racial focus.\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 470; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391; cf. Carolene Prods., 304 U.S. at 153\nn.4 (arguing that more exacting judicial scrutiny is required when the majority curtails\n“the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect\nminorities”).\n\n                       ii. Application of the Hunter/Seattle Test\n\n       Hunter and Seattle thus expounded the rule that an enactment deprives minority\ngroups of equal protection of the laws when it: (1) has a racial focus, targeting a goal or\nprogram that “inures primarily to the benefit of the minority”; and (2) works a\nreallocation of political power or reordering of the decisionmaking process that places\n“special burdens” on a minority group’s ability to achieve its goals through that process.\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 470; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 15\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        Applying this rule here, we conclude that Proposal 2 targets a program that\n“inures primarily to the benefit of the minority” and reorders the political process in\nMichigan in such a way as to place “special burdens” on racial minorities.\n\n                                a. Racial Focus\n\n        The first prong of the Hunter/Seattle test requires us to determine whether\nProposal 2 has a “racial focus.” See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 473. The Court explained that\nthe question is not whether “members of the racial majority both favored and benefited\nfrom” the program or policy at issue, but whether the policy targeted by the law “at\nbottom inures primarily to the benefit of the minority, and is designed for that purpose.”\nId. at 472.\n\n        In Seattle, the Court observed that programs—in that context, the busing of\nchildren to increase the number of integrated schools—furthering the education of\nminority children enable them “to function in—and . . . [be] fully accepted by—the\nlarger community.” Id. at 473. Such programs do so, the Court explained, through\n“preparing minority children for citizenship in our pluralistic society, while . . . teaching\nmembers of the racial majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with children of\nminority heritage.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Grutter,\n539 U.S. at 330-32 (“[T]he [University of Michigan] Law School’s [race-conscious]\nadmissions policy promotes cross-racial understanding, helps to break down racial\nstereotypes, and enables [students] to better understand persons of different races. . . .\n[T]he diffusion of knowledge and opportunity through public institutions of higher\neducation must be accessible to all individuals regardless of race or ethnicity.” (fourth\nalteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Seattle Court then\nconcluded that Initiative 350 had a racial focus, because “it is enough that minorities\nmay consider busing for integration to be ‘legislation that is in their interest.’” Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 474 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 395 (Harlan, J., concurring)).\n\n        Proposal 2, like Initiative 350, has a “racial focus,” because the Michigan\nuniversities’ affirmative-action programs “inure[] primarily to the benefit of the\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 16\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nminority, and [are] designed for that purpose,” for the reasons articulated by the Court\nin Seattle. See id. at 472. Just as the desegregative busing programs at issue in Seattle\nwere designed to improve racial minorities’ representation at many public schools, see\nid. at 460, race-conscious admissions policies increase racial minorities’ representation\nat institutions of higher education, see, e.g., Grutter, 539 U.S. at 316, 328-33 (describing\nthe University of Michigan Law School’s minority-student-enrollment aims); Gratz, 539\nU.S. at 253-56 (describing admissions policies at the University of Michigan regarding\nunderrepresented minority groups). Indeed, underrepresented minorities lobbied for the\nadoption of such policies at Michigan’s universities in the first place for this reason, (see\nAnderson Report, Dist. Ct. Docket No. 222 Ex. L, at 16-23), and, further, the unrebutted\nevidence in the record indicates that Proposal 2 will likely negatively impact minority\nrepresentation at Michigan’s institutions of higher education, (see Connerly Dep., Dist.\nCt. Docket No. 222 Ex. A, at 119-21; Spencer Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 203 Ex. D, at\n100-01; Wu Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 203 Ex. F, at 78; Zearfoss Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket\nNo. 205 Ex. 3, at 56-57). Ample evidence thus grounds our conclusion that race-\nconscious admissions policies “inure[] primarily to the benefit of the minority.” See\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 472.\n\n        Yet the Attorney General argues, and we previously suggested, that the now-\ndefunct Michigan admissions policies benefitted women as well, and that saves them.\nSee Coal. II, 473 F.3d at 250-51. Our prior suggestion does not bind us, see Certified\nRestoration Dry Cleaning Network, L.L.C. v. Tenke Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194678/certified-restoration-dry-cleaning-v-tenke-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 542 (6th Cir.\n2007), and we now reject it. The Supreme Court made it clear that even policies\nbenefitting the majority—let alone another minority—may have a “racial focus,” so that\nlens does not clarify anything. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 472. In fact, it serves only to blur\nwhat is in reality a clear test: The question is not whether the challenged law “burdens\nminority interests and minority interests alone,” Coal. II, 473 F.3d at 250, but whether\nthe law targets policies that minorities may consider in their interest, Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 472. Even a cursory examination of the cases confirms this understanding. In Hunter,\nthe ordinance likewise burdened non-racial minorities, including Catholics, Hispanics\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/        Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 17\n1534; 09-1111             Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nand numerous other groups (which, grouped together, would constitute a majority of the\nelectorate), but the Court held that the law had a racial focus. 393 U.S. at 387. The same\nwas true of the policy at issue in Nyquist, and the Court again agreed that it had a racial\nfocus. 318 F. Supp. at 716-17. Likewise, as explained above, the race-conscious\nadmissions policies stymied by Proposal 2 are in the interest of racial minorities and\ninure primarily to their benefit, so the polices have a racial focus as well.\n\n          This conclusion is not impacted by the fact that increased representation of racial\nminorities in higher education also benefits students of other groups and our nation as\na whole. Cf. Grutter, 539 U.S. at 327-33 (describing the varied benefits supporting\nMichigan’s compelling interest in increasing racial diversity at public institutions of\nhigher education). Similar benefits accrued to children at integrated public schools\nunder Seattle’s desegregative busing plan, which the Supreme Court explicitly\nrecognized: “[I]t should be . . . clear that white as well as Negro children benefit from\nexposure to ethnic and racial diversity in the classroom . . . [by] teaching members of the\nracial majority to live in harmony and mutual respect with children of minority heritage.”\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 472-73. Nonetheless, the Seattle Court found that the wider benefits\nof the busing plan did not serve to distinguish Hunter, “for we may fairly assume that\nmembers of the racial majority both favored and benefited from Akron’s fair housing\nordinance.” Id. at 472. By the same token, race-conscious admissions policies’ wider\nbenefits do not undermine the conclusion that their primary beneficiaries are racial\nminorities.\n\n          We therefore find that the race-conscious admissions policies now barred by\nProposal 2 inure primarily to the benefit of racial minorities and that Proposal 2, insofar\nas it prohibits consideration of applicants’ race in admissions decisions, has a “racial\nfocus.”\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 18\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                               b. Reordering the Political Process to Place Special\n                               Burdens on Racial Minorities\n\n       The second prong of the Hunter/Seattle test asks us to determine whether\nProposal 2 works a reallocation of political power or reordering of the political process\nthat places “special burdens” on racial minorities. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 470; Hunter,\n393 U.S. at 391.\n\n                                       1. Does Proposal 2 Reorder a “Political” Process?\n\n       The first issue within this prong is whether the Michigan admissions committees\nare “political,” as that term is used in the Hunter/Seattle test. We begin by examining\nthe word itself. “Political” has two possible meanings relevant to our discussion: “of or\nrelating to government,” Merriam-Webster, Webster’s Third New International\nDictionary: Unabridged 1755 (1993) (first definition), or “of, relating to, or involved in\nparty politics,” id. (third definition). Examining the Court’s language, we conclude that\nthe “political” requirement seeks to ensure that the process at issue relates to\ngovernment.\n\n       The political processes relevant in Hunter and Seattle were the Akron public-\nhousing structure and the Washington public schools’ student-assignment system,\nrespectively. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 390, 393. Clarifying the\n“political” nature of the latter, the Court referred to the “political process”\ninterchangeably as a “decisionmaking process” and a “governmental process,” and\nexplained that the political power allocation in question is of “governmental power.”\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 470. The Court elsewhere identified the relevant characteristics that\nmade the school boards “political”: They were “creatures of the State” and had to “give\neffect to policies announced by the state legislature.” Id. at 476. In other words, the\nboards were “political” because they were governmental entities, not necessarily\nelectoral or partisan ones. Id. Even more explicitly, the Court found that Initiative 350’s\nflaw was “us[ing] the racial nature of an issue to define the governmental\ndecisionmaking structure.” Id. at 470 (emphasis added); see also id. at 474 (“As in\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 19\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nHunter, then, the community’s political mechanisms are modified to place effective\ndecisionmaking authority over a racial issue at a different level of government.”\n(emphasis added)). Indeed, the Court noted that the political “reallocation of power of\nthe kind condemned in Hunter” is the removal of “authority . . . from the existing\ndecisionmaking body.” Id. (emphasis added); see also id. at 477 (“[I]t is irrelevant that\nthe State might have vested all decisionmaking authority in itself, so long as the political\nstructure it in fact erected imposes comparative burdens on minority interests . . . .”\n(emphasis added)). Thus, a process is “political” under Hunter and Seattle if it involves\ngovernmental decisionmaking.\n\n         The dissent disagrees. It defines a “political process” narrowly, as one “through\nwhich the people exercise their right to govern themselves,” Slip Op. at 13, or one that\nis “electoral,”2 id. at 18-19 & n.6, and suggests that a process is political only if it\ninvolves direct elections. In so doing, the dissent misapprehends the “political” nexus\nrequired in the Hunter/Seattle test. The electoral nature of a state system is relevant not\nto the political nature of a process, but to the reordering at issue. The Court’s point in\nrequiring that there be reordering of a “political process” was merely to ensure that the\nprocess was state-directed (“governmental”) and mattered (“decisionmaking”), the same\nway Title VII cases require the alleged discriminatory act to relate to a company agent\nwith relevant authority. No link to the electoral process is required to find a given\nprocess “political.”\n\n         The dissent latches on to a lone mention of an “electorate” in Seattle to argue that\nthe Hunter/Seattle political process must be an electoral, or voting-centered, political\nprocess. The statement at issue, however, was simply the Court’s quotation of the\nlanguage setting forth the school board’s authority under Washington law. See Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 478 (quoting Wash. Rev. Code § 28A.58.758(1)). And that quotation sits in\n\n         2\n           By “electoral,” the dissent must mean “of or relating to election.” See Merriam-Webster,\nWebster’s Third New International Dictionary: Unabridged 731 (1993). Nothing in either definition of\n“political,” however, relates more than tangentially to an election or voting: Yes, in a democracy,\ngovernment exists because of elections, but the Court did not require there to be a “political process” for\nthe purpose of elucidating first principles. The second meaning of government—in effect, “partisan”—is\nmore related to elections, but the cases do not support (and the dissent does not advocate) such a reading.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 20\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\na section explaining the structure of Washington’s educational system generally and the\npower of the school boards specifically. See id. To argue that the key insight to the\nentire Hunter/Seattle test lies in this solitary quotation is unsupportable, especially given\nthe abundance of language to the contrary in those cases. Moreover, there is no language\nin this section of Seattle suggesting that the Court was defining what it meant by a\n“political process.”        A process thus is “political” if it involves governmental\ndecisionmaking. Nothing more is required.\n\n         This point is hammered home by the Court’s affirmance of, and subsequent\nreliance (in Seattle) on, Nyquist. In Nyquist, the Court agreed with the three-judge panel\nthat an enactment to New York’s laws unconstitutionally reordered the political process\nwhen the enactment “prohibit[ed] state education officials and appointed school boards”\nfrom performing various education-related functions “for the purpose of achieving racial\nequality in attendance.” 318 F. Supp. at 712 (emphasis added). The fact that the school\nboards at issue were not elected did not affect the Court’s decision.3 The Hunter/Seattle\ntest therefore requires simply that the process at issue involve governmental\ndecisionmaking.\n\n         Yet even using the dissent’s erroneous definition of “political” as “electoral,” the\nadmissions committees here still qualify as “political.” For in addition to possessing the\nsame character as the school boards in Seattle and Nyquist and the Akron housing\ninstitutions in Hunter, they fall squarely within Michigan’s electoral system.\n\n         The Michigan Constitution, the foundation of Michigan’s government,\nestablishes three public universities—the University of Michigan, Michigan State\nUniversity, and Wayne State University—and grants the governing board of each\nuniversity control of its respective institution. Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 5; see also id.\nart. VIII, § 6 (allowing the establishment of other institutions of higher learning, such as\n\n         3\n           Likewise, the dissent’s dwelling on the term “legislation,” see Slip Op. at 13-14, misapprehends\nthat term’s usage in the Hunter/Seattle test, for the Court considered the school board policies in Seattle\nand Nyquist to constitute such “legislation,” see Seattle, 458 U.S. at 470, 474-75 & n.17; Nyquist, 318 F.\nSupp. at 718-19, and the admissions policies at Michigan’s colleges and universities are of an identical\ncharacter.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Meanwhile, the bylaws, over which\nthe boards have complete authority, detail the admissions procedures.5 See Univ. of\nMich.,       Bylaws        of     the     Bd.      of    Regents         §    8.01,      available         at\n\n\n         4\n          Though the statutes and bylaws cited in this paragraph govern only the University of Michigan,\nthe boards of the other public colleges and universities in Michigan are similarly empowered.

The dissent rests\nthis argument on “the testimony of the law school deans in this case.” Id. at 14. But the\ndissent’s argument fails for two reasons. First, the testimony the dissent references does\nnot support the dissent’s claim of “full delegation” or the idea that the boards could not\ntheoretically change the policies; it merely describes the current admissions structures.\nThere is one exception to this observation, however: former-Dean Wu’s personal opinion\nthat modification of the admissions structure might “precipitate a constitutional crisis.”\n(Wu Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 203 Ex. F, at 191-92). But this opinion is inadmissible\nas both speculation and a legal conclusion (notably, with no basis in Michigan law). See\nTorres v. Cnty. of Oakland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"449701\"><a href=\"/opinion/449701/37-fair-emplpraccas-535-36-empl-prac-dec-p-35085-17-fed-r-evid/\"><span class=\"volume\">758</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 149-51 (6th Cir. 1985).\n\n        Second, and much more to the point, the structure of Michigan’s colleges and\nuniversities is a question of law, for it is set by constitution, statutes and regulations. See\nUnited States v. Dedman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1457672\"><a href=\"/opinion/1457672/united-states-v-dedman/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 584-85 (6th Cir. 2008).

Still, the dissent\nprotests: “As they currently stand, the faculty admissions committees are islands unto\nthemselves, vested with the full and unreviewed authority to set admissions policy for\ntheir respective university programs.” Slip Op. at 14. The current boards’ policies,\nhowever, are besides the point. The key question is whether the boards’ current\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 23\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\npolicies—in the form of bylaws and regulations—could be altered, for example if the\npeople of Michigan elected different boards dedicated to changing the universities’\nadmissions policies. Michigan law provides a resounding “yes,” see Mich. Const. art.\nVIII, §§ 5-6; cf. Mich. State Univ., Bd. of Trs. Bylaws, art. 5 (stipulating that “[t]he\ndelegation of any authority by the Board to any committee shall not operate to relieve\nthe Board or any member thereof of any responsibility imposed by law or the State\nConstitution”), and the dissent points us to no law indicating otherwise.\n\n        Moreover, because the dissent does not question the boards’ electoral nature, the\ndissent’s argument implies another untenable proposition: that delegation of admittedly\nelectoral power to an unelected body renders the power ultimately exercised non-\nelectoral. As an initial matter, the appointed boards in Nyquist soundly rebuff this\nargument. Yet the argument cannot hold water even aside from Nyquist. Let us begin\nby dissecting the dissent’s contention in a more familiar electoral framework: the federal\nsystem. In parallel to Michigan’s university structure, the members of the National\nSecurity Council (“NSC”) are likewise unelected individuals receiving delegated\nelectoral political power, though from the President of the United States. Do we\nconsider the power they wield to be electoral? Of course. That they are a step removed\nfrom the electoral process does not mean that they are not exercising electoral political\npower. See Carter v. Carter Coal Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102662\"><a href=\"/opinion/102662/carter-v-carter-coal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 296 (1936) (“And the Constitution\nitself is in every real sense a law—the lawmakers being the people themselves, in whom\nunder our system all political power and sovereignty primarily resides . . . .

Page 24\n1534; 09-1111                 Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nwhat the NSC does, they may exact an electoral price against the person from whom the\nNSC receives its power: the President.6 The same is true of the admissions committees\nhere, which wield the electoral power bestowed on them—through the\nboards—ultimately by the Michigan Constitution. See Part II.A.1.ii.b.2, infra.\n\n         In sum, we find apt the Court’s rejoinder to claims similar to those the Attorney\nGeneral and the dissent make: “[T]hat a State may distribute legislative power as it\ndesires . . . furnish[es] no justification for a legislative structure which otherwise would\nviolate the Fourteenth Amendment.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 476 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 392) (first alteration added). Michigan, like “Washington[,] . . . has chosen to make\nuse of a more complex governmental structure” than direct administration by the\nlegislature, or even the university boards, of admissions decisions in university and\ncollege affairs. See id. at 476-77. However, as we have explained, the fact that the\nadmissions committees received the political power they exercise through delegation\nrather than direct election is irrelevant to the nature of that power and thus the\napplicability of the Hunter/Seattle test.\n\n         Therefore, the admissions committees are “political” because they are\ngovernmental decisionmaking bodies. And even if they had to be tied to the electoral\nsystem, they are, because the individuals delegated with principal responsibility for\nadmissions policies at Michigan’s public colleges and universities are appointed by the\ninstitutions’ governing boards—which are either elected by the citizens of Michigan or\nappointed by elected officials—and the boards are free to reassign this responsibility as\n\n\n         6\n            Put more pointedly, it is the electoral structure that renders the power wielded electoral, not the\nnature of the person’s position. No matter how many times this power is delegated, or to whom, an elected\nofficial is ultimately responsible for it. For example, though two State Department employees may reach\ntheir posts by different paths, one hired and one appointed, both individuals’ power stems from the\nPresident, and they perform the same function: the work of the President. And a building manager working\nfor the General Services Administration (“GSA”), like a faculty member on a public university’s\nadmissions committee, is hired and performs a function existing equally in the private sector. The building\nmanager’s private counterpart does not exercise electoral power, yet the GSA employee and Michigan\nfaculty member do. The difference lies in the ultimate source of these latter two individuals’ authority:\nthe government. The fact remains that an elected official—be it the President of the United States, the\nGovernor of Michigan, or a member of one of the university boards—is accountable to the electorate for\nthe power that he delegated to the GSA, State Department, or university admissions committees, and he\ncould equally choose to delegate that power to someone else or exercise it himself. This is what it means\nfor power to be electoral.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/          Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                  Page 25\n1534; 09-1111               Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nthey see fit. Thus, there is little doubt that Proposal 2 affects a “political process” under\nHunter and Seattle.\n\n                                             2. Does Proposal 2 Effect a “Reordering” of the\n                                             Political Process so as to Place Special Burdens\n                                             on Racial Minorities?\n         The next issue is whether Proposal 2 reordered the political process to place\nspecial burdens on racial minorities. We find that Proposal 2 burdens racial minorities\nfor the reasons articulated in Part II.A.1.ii.a, supra. As to whether there was a\nreordering, the Court has found that both implicit and explicit reordering violates the\nFourteenth Amendment. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 387, 390. In\nHunter, the express language of the charter amendment required any ordinance\nregulating real estate “on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry”\nto be approved by a majority of the electorate and the City Council, as opposed to solely\nthe City Council for other real-estate ordinances. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">393</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">387</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390.\n\n         In Seattle, however, the reordering was implicit: On its face, Initiative 350\nsimply prohibited school boards from using mandatory busing, but its practical effect\nwas that “[t]hose favoring the elimination of de facto school segregation now must seek\nrelief from the state legislature, or from the statewide electorate” through overturning\nInitiative 350. 458 U.S. at 474. Nonetheless, “authority over all other student\nassignment decisions . . . remains vested in the local school board.” Id. The Seattle\nCourt then clarified what sort of reordering contravenes the “political process” theory:\n“The evil condemned by the Hunter Court was not the particular political obstacle of\nmandatory referenda imposed by the Akron charter amendment; it was, rather, the\ncomparative structural burden placed on the achievement of minority interests.”7 Id. at\n474 n.17 (emphasis added). Thus, any “comparative structural burden,” be it local or\nstate-wide or national, satisfies the reallocation prong of the Hunter/Seattle test. Id.\n\n\n\n         7\n           The Court’s statement here rebuffs the dissent’s attempt to argue that the “relevant lawmaking\nauthority” also must be reallocated from a “local legislative body” to a “more complex government\nstructure” with a broader constituency. See Slip Op. at 7.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 26\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n        We face here an enactment even more troubling than those at issue in Hunter and\nSeattle, as the hurdle Proposal 2 creates is of the highest possible order. An interested\nMichigan citizen may use any number of avenues to change the admissions policies on\nan issue unrelated to race. He may lobby the admissions committees directly, through\nwritten or in-person communication if the latter is available, or petition higher\nadministrative authorities at the university: the dean of admissions, the president or dean\nof the university, or the university’s board. See Part II.A.1.ii.b.1, supra; see also, e.g.,\nUniv. Defs. Admis., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 172 Ex. I, at 11, 14-15, 17-20; Wu Dep., Dist.\nCt. Docket No. 203 Ex. F, at 190; Zearfoss Dep., Dist. Ct. Docket No. 205 Ex. 3, at 209-\n10. And there is no question that the admissions committees are very much accountable\nto the universities’ boards, which retain ultimate—and politically accountable—\nresponsibility over admissions policies. See Mich. Const. art. VIII, §§ 5-6.\n\n        The individual seeking this non-race-related change may also seek to affect the\nelection—through voting, campaigning, or otherwise—of any one of the eight board\nmembers whom the individual believes will champion his cause and revise the review\nof admissions determinations accordingly. These elections, though state-wide in scope,\nwould likely be much more manageable than those surrounding constitutional\namendments, which can be expensive, lengthy, and complex, (see Wilfore Decl., Dist.\nCt. Docket No. 203 Ex. C ¶¶ 10, 29-30). Only as a last resort would the effort and\nexpense of campaigning for an amendment to the Michigan Constitution be\nrequired—the only option that remains open for proponents of race-based admissions\ncriteria.\n\n        Meanwhile, a Michigan citizen seeking that Michigan universities adopt race-\nbased admissions policies must now begin by convincing the Michigan electorate to\namend the Michigan Constitution. Placing a proposed constitutional amendment\nabrogating Proposal 2 on the ballot would require either the support of two-thirds of both\nthe Michigan House of Representatives and Senate, see Mich. Const. art. XII, § 1, or the\nsignatures of a number of voters equivalent to at least ten percent of the number of votes\ncast for all candidates for governor in the preceding general election, see id. art XII, § 2.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 27\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nA majority of the voting electorate would then have to approve the amendment. See id.\nart. XII, §§ 1-2.\n\n        Only after traversing this difficult and costly process, (see Wilfore Decl., Dist.\nCt. Docket No. 203 Ex. C ¶¶ 10, 29-30), would the now-exhausted Michigan citizen\nreach the starting point of his opponent who sought a non-race-related admissions policy\nchange. By amending Michigan’s Constitution to prohibit university admissions units\nfrom utilizing race-conscious admissions policies, proponents of Proposal 2 thus\nremoved the authority to institute racially-focused policies from Michigan’s universities\nand lodged it at the most remote level of Michigan’s government, the state constitution.\n\n        In other words, as with the unconstitutional enactment in Hunter, proponents of\nrace-conscious admissions policies now have to obtain the approval of the Michigan\nelectorate and (if they are successful) the admissions units or other university powers,\nwhereas proponents of other admissions policies need only the support of the latter. See\nSeattle, 458 U.S. at 468, 474 (describing Hunter).\n\n        The stark contrast between the avenues for political change available to different\nadmissions proponents following Proposal 2 illustrates why the amendment cannot be\nconstrued as a mere repeal of an existing race-related policy. Had those favoring\nabolition of race-conscious admissions successfully lobbied the universities’ admissions\nunits, just as underrepresented minorities did to have these policies adopted in the first\nplace, there would be no equal protection problem. As the Supreme Court has made\nclear, “‘the simple repeal or modification of desegregation or antidiscrimination laws,\nwithout more, never has been viewed as embodying a presumptively invalid racial\nclassification.’” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 483 (quoting Crawford v. Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110786\"><a href=\"/opinion/110786/crawford-v-board-of-ed-of-los-angeles/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 539 (1982)); accord Hunter, 393 U.S. at 390 n.5. Crawford brings this distinction\ninto focus, because the Court-approved political action in that case (amendment of the\nCalifornia constitution) occurred at the same level of government as the original\nenactment (a prior amendment of the California constitution), thus leaving the rules of\nthe political game unchanged. 458 U.S. at 532, 540.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.        Page 28\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       As illustrated above, however, Proposal 2 “works something more than the ‘mere\nrepeal’ of a desegregation law by the political entity that created it.” Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 483. Rather, like Initiative 350 did for any future attempt to implement race-based\nbusing (and the Akron city charter amendment did for any future attempt to enact a fair\nhousing ordinance), “by lodging decisionmaking authority over the question at a new\nand remote level of government,” Proposal 2 “burdens all future attempts” to implement\nrace-conscious admissions policies. Id.\n\n       By the same token, precisely because Proposal 2 places special burdens on a\npolitical program of particular importance to racial minorities, it is not a sufficient\nresponse to point out that these minorities remain free to repeal it. The “simple but\ncentral principle” of Hunter and Seattle is that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits\nrequiring racial minorities to surmount more formidable obstacles to achieve their\npolitical objectives than other groups face. See id. at 469-70. As the Supreme Court has\nrecognized, such special procedural barriers to minority interests discriminate against\nracial minorities just as surely as—and more insidiously than—substantive legal barriers\nchallenged under the traditional equal protection rubric. See id. at 467 (“[T]he\nFourteenth Amendment also reaches a political structure that treats all individuals as\nequals, yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special\nburdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted)). Because less onerous avenues to effect political\nchange remain open to those advocating consideration of non-racial factors in\nadmissions decisions, Michigan cannot force those advocating for consideration of racial\nfactors to go down a more arduous road than others without violating the Fourteenth\nAmendment.\n\n       We thus conclude that Proposal 2 reorders the political process in Michigan to\nplace special burdens on minority interests.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 29\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n                       iii. Proposed Permutations of the Hunter/Seattle Test\n\n                               a. Is Prohibiting “Preferential Treatment” Different From\n                               Prohibiting “Discrimination”?\n       The Attorney General asserts that Hunter and Seattle are inapplicable to Proposal\n2 because the cases govern only enactments that burden racial minorities’ ability to\nobtain protection from discrimination through the political process, whereas Proposal\n2 burdens racial minorities’ ability to obtain preferential treatment. In support of this\ndistinction, the Attorney General points to our preliminary injunction ruling, and\ndecisions of the Ninth Circuit and the district court. See Coal. II, 473 F.3d at 251; Coal.\nfor Econ. Equity, 122 F.3d at 708; Coal. IV, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 956-57. None of these\ndecisions is binding on us. See Tenke Corp., 511 F.3d at 542 (“[C]onclusions of law\nmade by a court granting [a] preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the\nmerits.” (internal quotation mark omitted)); Cross Mountain Coal. v. Ward, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724890\"><a href=\"/opinion/724890/cross-mountain-coal-inc-v-alvin-ward-director-office-of-workers/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">211</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n217 (6th Cir. 1996) (“[T]he decisions of other circuits are entitled to our respect, [but]\nthey are not binding upon us.”). And we do not find them persuasive.\n\n       We turn first to the distinction at issue and its true meaning. Differentiation\nbetween “discrimination” and “preference” in this context finds its origin in the Ninth\nCircuit. See Coal. for Econ. Equity, 122 F.3d at 707-09. The Coalition for Economic\nEquity court began by stating that “[e]ven a state law that does restructure the political\nprocess can only deny equal protection if it burden’s an individual’s right to equal\ntreatment.” Id. at 707 (emphasis added). The court then continued: “It is one thing to\nsay that individuals have equal protection rights against political obstructions to equal\ntreatment; it is quite another to say that individuals have equal protection rights against\npolitical obstructions to preferential treatment.” Id. at 708. In so positing, the Ninth\nCircuit added another element to the Hunter/Seattle test. That element, stripped of the\ncontroversial and obfuscating distinction between “discrimination” and “preference,”\nboils down to a belief that an enactment violates the Equal Protection Clause under\nHunter and Seattle only if it undermines state action that is constitutionally mandated\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                     Page 30\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n(“discrimination”), as opposed to constitutionally permissible (“preference”).8 Put\ndifferently: An enactment is unconstitutional if it transgresses a constitutionally-\nmandated action, i.e., an enactment is unconstitutional under the “political process”\nframework only if the enactment is already unconstitutional under the “traditional”\nrubric. But this reasoning defies logic. Using this rationale, the political process theory\nwould be superfluous, for an aggrieved citizen could sue to enjoin the unconstitutional\nlaw under the traditional equal protection analysis. For that very reason, the Court\ncreated the “political process” theory in the context of cases addressing state action that\nis constitutionally permissible (or “preferential” to use the Attorney General and Ninth\nCircuit’s terminology). The facts of those very cases thus prohibit this distinction.\n\n         The Court in Hunter rejected the argument that the Akron amendment’s effect\nwas moot because the amendment was invalid under the 1968 Civil Rights Act, see\nHunter, 393 U.S. at 388-89, or that traditional equal protection resolved the case, id. at\n389. Seattle even more clearly involved constitutionally-permissible state action, as\nInitiative 350 responded to a voluntary school board effort to reduce the impact of de\nfacto segregation. 458 U.S. at 460-61. The school board was under no obligation to\nundertake this effort because there had been no finding that the segregation was\nmotivated by racial discrimination—a fact that the Seattle dissent repeatedly pointed out.\nSee, e.g., id. at 491-92 (Powell, J., dissenting) (“The Court has never held that there is\nan affirmative duty to integrate the schools in the absence of a finding of unconstitutional\nsegregation. . . . Certainly there is no constitutional duty to adopt mandatory busing in\nthe absence of such a violation.”). Rather, the Board’s plan was an ameliorative measure\ndesigned to combat the effects of Seattle’s segregated housing patterns and “alleviate the\nisolation of minority students.” Id. at 460. It is inaccurate, therefore, to suggest that\nInitiative 350 made it “more difficult for minorities to obtain protection from\n\n         8\n           This must be so because there is no free-floating “right” to be free of discrimination. That right\nmust therefore find its basis in either the United States Constitution—primarily through the Equal\nProtection Clause—or a federal statute. The latter was not at issue in Coalition for Economic Equity, so\nthe Equal Protection Clause must ground the right discussed by the Ninth Circuit. Therefore, the only\npossible reading of the Ninth Circuit’s decision is that the Equal Protection Clause, through the “political\nprocess” theory, only protects action which the Equal Protection Clause, through the “traditional” theory,\nalready protects.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                    Page 31\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ndiscrimination through the political process.” Coal. II, 473 F.3d at 251. Quite the\ncontrary: As the district court recognized, “[b]ecause prohibiting integration (when it is\nnot constitutionally mandated) is not tantamount to discrimination, . . . the Court in\nSeattle did not (and could not) rely on the notion that the restructuring at issue impeded\nefforts to secure equal treatment.”9 Coal. VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 951.\n\n         Similarly, in Nyquist, the New York Legislature responded to attempts to remedy\nde facto segregation “generated in large part by local housing patterns and economic\nconditions,” 318 F. Supp. at 717, by passing a law prohibiting “state education officials\nand appointed school boards from assigning students, or establishing, reorganizing or\nmaintaining school districts . . . for the purpose of achieving racial equality in\nattendance,” id. at 712. Applying Hunter, the court concluded that “by prohibiting the\nimplementation of plans designed to alleviate racial imbalance in the schools,” the\nstatute “creates a clearly racial classification, treating educational matters involving\nracial criteria differently from other educational matters and making it more difficult to\ndeal with racial imbalance in the public schools.” Id. at 718-19. In reaching this\nconclusion, the court rejected the defendants’ argument that this classification did not\nviolate the Equal Protection Clause because “in the absence of de jure segregation, the\nstate is under no obligation to take affirmative action to reduce de facto segregation.”\nId. at 719. The court reasoned that the process-based nature of the Hunter inquiry\nprecluded this distinction:\n\n\n\n         9\n           In holding that Proposal 2 nonetheless does not violate the Equal Protection Clause, the district\ncourt asserted that the race-conscious admissions policies at issue here should be distinguished from the\nvoluntary desegregative busing program at issue in Seattle because, unlike race-conscious admissions\npolicies, “school desegregation programs are not inherently invidious, do not work wholly to the benefit\nof certain members of one group and correspondingly to the harm of certain members of another group,\nand do not deprive citizens of rights.” Coal. VI, 592 F. Supp. 2d at 951 (quoting Coal. for Econ. Equity,\n122 F.3d at 708 n.16).\n          This purported distinction is erroneous and flies in the face of the Supreme Court’s decisions in\nGrutter and Parents Involved in Community Schools v.

The Court explained: “[T]he skills needed in today’s increasingly global\nmarketplace can only be developed through exposure to widely diverse people, cultures, ideas, and\nviewpoints.” Id. In Parents Involved, the Court held that voluntary school desegregation programs can\nimpose injury, depriving citizens of rights. 551 U.S. at 719.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/          Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 32\n1534; 09-1111               Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n           [T]he argument that the state has not discriminated because it has no\n           constitutional obligation to end de facto racial imbalance fails to meet the\n           issue under Hunter v. Erickson. The statute places burdens on the\n           implementation of educational policies designed to deal with race on the\n           local level. . . . The discrimination is clearly based on race alone, and the\n           distinction created in the political process, based on racial considerations,\n           operates in practice as a racial classification.\n\nId. Accordingly, the court held the law unconstitutional, a decision that the Supreme\nCourt summarily affirmed, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971), and then subsequently relied on in\nSeattle.\n\n           It should be unsurprising, then, that the language of these decisions encompasses\nany legislation in the racial minorities’ interest, and thus is broader than it would be\nwere the Attorney General’s distinction valid. See, e.g., Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467 (noting\nthe Fourteenth Amendment protects against distortions of the political process that\n“place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation”\n(emphasis added)); id. at 470 (requiring searching judicial scrutiny where state action\nmakes it more difficult for racial minorities “to achieve legislation that is in their\ninterest” (emphasis added) (internal quotation mark omitted)); id. at 474 (finding it\n“enough that minorities may consider busing for integration to be legislation that is in\ntheir interest” (emphasis added) (internal quotation mark omitted)); Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 393 (“[T]he State may no more disadvantage any particular group by making it more\ndifficult to enact legislation in its behalf than it may dilute any person’s vote . . . .”\n(emphasis added)); cf. Nyquist, 318 F. Supp. at 720 (holding that the state “has acted to\nmake it more difficult for racial minorities to achieve goals that are in their interest”\n(emphasis added)).\n\n           The cases’ context and reasoning, discussed above, crystallize the point of the\nHunter/Seattle doctrine. The political process theory does not serve as a duplicative\nbackstop against already unconstitutional action. Instead, it prevents the placement of\nspecial procedural obstacles on minority objectives, whatever those objectives may be.\nThe distinction urged by the Attorney General thus erroneously imposes an outcome-\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/         Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                Page 33\n1534; 09-1111              Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nbased limitation on a process-based right. Again, what matters is if racial minorities are\nforced to surmount procedural hurdles in reaching this goal over which other groups do\nnot have to leap. If racial minorities do, the disparate procedural treatment violates the\nEqual Protection Clause, regardless of the goal sought. Accordingly, whether “all\ngovernmental use of race must have a logical end point,” as the dissent asserts, Slip Op.\nat 21 (quoting Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342), is irrelevant to the constitutionality of Proposal\n2 under Hunter and Seattle. The equal protection injury imposed by Proposal 2 is not\nthe Michigan electorate’s attempt to end affirmative action, but the method by which it\nsought to do so.\n\n                                   b. Does a Law Place Special Burdens on Minorities Even\n                                   When Multiple Minorities Affected by the Enactment,\n                                   Cobbled-Together, Would Constitute a Numerical\n                                   Majority?\n        As to the issue of burdening minorities, the Attorney General argues that\nProposal 2 places no special burden on racial minorities because they, together with\nwomen, constitute a numerical majority of voters and thus could theoretically repeal\nProposal 2.10 In so arguing, he points to the Hunter Court’s statement in dicta that “[t]he\nmajority needs no protection against discrimination and if it did, a referendum might be\nbothersome but no more than that.” 393 U.S. at 391.\n\n        The Attorney General’s argument is without merit. Examination of the context\nof that statement from Hunter reveals that the quotation referred to the racial majority\nat issue in that case, not the ad-hoc and theoretical numerical majority posited by the\nAttorney General. See id. And as the district court cogently stated:\n\n        The argument that racial minorities plus women constitute a majority of\n        the population, and therefore Proposal 2 does not discriminate against\n        minorities . . . borders on nonsense. The attempt to cobble together an\n        artificial coalition of women and racial minorities in an effort to construct\n        a numerical majority of citizens ignores the fact that affirmative action\n        programs generally are targeted to benefit insular groups that separately\n\n        10\n            We address this argument separately because our “racial focus” analysis does not encompass\nit fully. See Part II.A.1.ii.a, supra.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Lumping minority groups\n       into a contrived category does not allow any greater political influence\n       over the process of advocating for affirmative action programs to achieve\n       racial parity or otherwise render the process of changing the state\n       constitution “bothersome but no more than that.”\n\nCoal.

Indeed, in Seattle, the Court expressly rejected this\nargument. Acknowledging that “‘purposeful discrimination is the condition that offends\nthe Constitution,’” 458 U.S. at 484 (quoting Pers. Adm’r v. Feeney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110098\"><a href=\"/opinion/110098/personnel-administrator-of-mass-v-feeney/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274\n(1979)), the Court nonetheless emphasized that “[w]e have not insisted on a\nparticularized inquiry into motivation in all equal protection cases.” Id. at 485. Rather,\n“‘[a] racial classification, regardless of purported motivation, is presumptively invalid\nand can be upheld only upon an extraordinary justification.’” Id. (quoting Feeney, 442\nU.S. at 272). Legislation like that in Hunter, Seattle, and here, which restructures the\npolitical process along racial lines and places special burdens on racial minorities, thus\n“falls into an inherently suspect category,” regardless of whether purposeful racial\ndiscrimination is its demonstrated motivation. Id.\n\n                          iv. “Political Process” Conclusion\n\n          Proposal 2 thus modifies Michigan’s political process “to place special burdens\non the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.” See Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 467.\n\n                          v. Strict Scrutiny\n\n          Because Proposal 2 fails the Hunter/Seattle test, it must survive strict scrutiny to\nstand. See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 485. Under strict scrutiny, the Attorney General must\nprove that Proposal 2 is “necessary to further a compelling state interest.” Crawford,\n458 U.S. at 536. In Seattle, the Court did not consider whether a compelling state\ninterest might justify a state’s enactment of a racially-focused law that restructures the\npolitical process, because the government did not make the argument. Seattle, 458 U.S.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Because the Attorney General likewise does not assert that Proposal 2\nsatisfies a compelling state interest, we need not consider this argument either.11\n\n         We therefore hold that those portions of Proposal 2 that affect Michigan’s public\ninstitutions of higher education violate the Equal Protection Clause.12\n\n                  2. “Traditional” Equal Protection Analysis\n\n         Having found that Proposal 2 deprives the Plaintiffs of equal protection of the\nlaw under a “political process” theory, we do not reach the question of whether it also\nviolates the Equal Protection Clause when assessed under the traditional framework.\n\n         B.

See Seattle, 458 U.S. at 480 n.23 (responding to id. at 498 n.14 (Powell, J.,\ndissenting)). However, the hypothetical situation Justice Powell described is entirely distinguishable from\nthat at issue here, in which decisonmaking authority has been removed to the highest level of state\ngovernment, not to a higher level of authority within the university. The fact that some reorderings of\npolitical processes may be de minimis does not mean that all are. Accordingly, Justice Powell’s argument\nand the Seattle majority’s Delphic response—made in dicta in a footnote with no supporting\nexplanation—are inapposite.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/        Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Thus, we agree with the district court’s conclusion that\n“Russell’s presence in the litigation is a mere makeweight that adds nothing of substance\nto the debate over Proposal 2’s constitutionality.” Id.

I join the majority’s opinion with respect to the procedural issues discussed in part\nII.B.   I disagree, however, with the majority’s conclusion that Proposal 2 is\nunconstitutional under a political restructuring theory of the Equal Protection Clause.\nIn my view, Proposal 2 does not impermissibly restructure the political process in the\nstate of Michigan to burden the ability of minorities to enact beneficial legislation.\nMoreover, Proposal 2 is not unconstitutional under traditional equal protection analysis.\nI therefore respectfully dissent.\n\n                                            I.\n\n        In November 2006, the people of Michigan amended the Michigan Constitution\nto prohibit the state, including its public colleges and universities, from discriminating\nagainst or granting preferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race,\nsex, color, ethnicity, or national origin in the operation of public employment, public\neducation, and public contracting. Mich. Const. art. I, § 26. A primary purpose and\neffect of this amendment was to remove the ability of state colleges and universities to\nemploy then-existing race- and gender-preference admissions policies. Accordingly, the\nplaintiffs challenge the amendment as it relates to the state’s colleges and universities.\n\n        Because “[c]ontext matters when reviewing race-based governmental action\nunder the Equal Protection Clause,” Grutter v.

Finally, the Court\nwas mindful that because “‘[a] core purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do\naway with all governmentally imposed discrimination based on race’ . . . race-conscious\nadmissions policies must be limited in time.” Id. at 341–42 (quoting Palmore v.

See\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Indeed, the Court has repeatedly confirmed that\nthe repeal or modification of race-related polices does not necessarily run afoul of the\nEqual Protection Clause. See Hunter, 393 U.S. at 390 n.5; Washington v. Seattle Sch.\nDist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110784\"><a href=\"/opinion/110784/washington-v-seattle-school-dist-no-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 483 (1982) (“[T]he simple repeal or modification of\ndesegregation or antidiscrimination laws, without more, has never been viewed as\nembodying a presumptively invalid racial classification.” (quoting Crawford v.

A state or university may conclude, for example, that\nthe use of racial preferences may no longer be necessary to further the interest in\ndiversity, that the burdens associated with those preferences are too heavy, or that the\nmeans employed no longer enjoy legitimacy in the eyes of the people. And, as was the\ncase with the California prohibition mentioned by the Court, it follows that a state or its\nelectorate may act to impose a time limit, or end the use of racial preferences outright,\nwhen its public universities have not. See Coal. for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744846\"><a href=\"/opinion/744846/the-coalition-for-economic-equity-california-naacp-northern-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">692</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1997).\n\n       It is from this legal backdrop that the popular effort to amend the Michigan\nConstitution to prevent the use of affirmative action in admissions developed. Taking\nit into account, we must turn to whether Michigan’s repeal of this type of racial\nclassification by constitutional amendment violates the Equal Protection Clause.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       As an initial matter, a broad view of plaintiff’s contentions provides context and\na bit of common sense about the requirements of the Constitution. Plaintiffs’ argument\nis that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits Michigan from prohibiting discrimination\nin admissions to public colleges and universities through the passage of Proposal 2.\nCalling an admissions practice a preference does not transform the practice into a\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 44\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nnondiscriminatory one; preferences do indeed permit discrimination. Yet, we know that\nthe Equal Protection Clause prevents “official conduct discriminating on the basis of\nrace.” Washington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976).\n\n        Grutter and Gratz represent the Supreme Court’s response to a university’s use\nof racial preferences in admissions and together develop the circumstances under which\npolicies that take race into account may be used. The burden on the university is a\ndifficult one; it may use race as a factor only when there is a compelling interest in doing\nso and when the use is narrowly tailored. Racial preferences are not favored under the\nlaw but must be exactingly justified. No constitutional jurisprudence exists that requires\ntheir use. And, as the Supreme Court has told us, “the Equal Protection Clause is not\nviolated by the mere repeal of race-related legislation or policies that were not required\nby the Federal Constitution in the first place.” Crawford, 458 U.S. at 538–39.\n\n        Within this broad constitutional landscape, plaintiffs contend that passage of\nProposal 2 violated the Equal Protection Clause. They base their argument on Hunter\nand Seattle. These cases, without a doubt, secure racial minorities the right to equal\nprocess within the political arena. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467; Hunter, 393 U.S. at 391.\nThey prohibit a “distortion of the political process,” Crawford, 458 U.S. at 538 n.14, by\nwhich a state “disadvantage[s] [a] particular group by making it more difficult to enact\nlegislation in its behalf,” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 476 (quotation marks and citation omitted),\nby “mak[ing] use of a more complex governmental structure,” id. at 477, or “lodging\ndecisionmaking authority over the question at a new and remote level of government,”\nid. at 483. But they do not guarantee that racial minorities will win every political battle.\nId. at 484 (“If a governmental institution is to be fair, one group cannot always be\nexpected to win . . . .” (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 394 (Harlan, J., concurring))). Nor\ndo they hold that the repeal of those policies is impermissible, although they may be\npreferred by significant numbers of racial minorities. Rather, Hunter, Seattle, and\nCrawford outline the constitutional limits on a particular type of political restructuring:\nthe enactment of comparative structural burdens on “the ability of minority groups to\nachieve beneficial legislation.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 467. Because these cases do not\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.           Page 45\n1534; 09-1111            Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nprohibit “every attempt to address a racial issue, ” id. at 485, it is important to consider\nthe limiting bounds of this type of political restructuring challenge.\n\n                                             A.\n\n        In reviewing a Hunter political process challenge, we must, of course, consider\nwhether the particular legislation or popular referendum at issue serves to impermissibly\n“distort” the state’s political processes. Crawford, 458 U.S. at 541. Seattle makes clear\nthat “the voters of the polity may express their displeasure through an established\nlegislative or referendum procedure when particular legislation arouses passionate\nopposition.” 458 U.S. at 483 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The state\nor its voters, however, may not “make[] the enactment of racially beneficial legislation\ndifficult” by “lodging decisionmaking authority over the question at a new and remote\nlevel of government.” Id. And they may “no more disadvantage any particular group\nby making it more difficult to enact legislation in its behalf than [they] may dilute any\nperson’s vote.” Id. at 476 (quoting Hunter, 393 U.S. at 392–93). Seattle and Hunter\ntherefore protect “the ability of minorities to participate in the process of self-\ngovernment.” Id. at 480 n.23.\n\n        In Hunter, the impermissible political restructuring took the form of a more\nburdensome extra step in the City of Akron’s legislative process. The people of Akron\nhad amended their city charter by popular referendum to require that any city ordinance\nregulating real property “on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or ancestry”\nbe subject to approval by a mandatory popular referendum, while all other ordinances\nregulating real estate only required the approval of the City Council. Hunter, 393 U.S.\nat 387, 390. The Hunter Court concluded that this amounted to an unconstitutional\npolitical restructuring because the charter amendment “obviously made it substantially\nmore difficult to secure enactment of ordinances” barring discrimination in real estate.\nId. at 390. Indeed, those minority voters supporting property-related anti-discrimination\nordinances would not only have to win a legislative battle in the Akron City Council, but\nthey would then have to win a public-referendum battle as well. Id. The default political\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

In the 1970s, the locally elected Seattle school board passed and\nimplemented a series of school desegregation programs aimed at alleviating the isolation\nof minority students caused by segregated housing patterns. Seattle, 458 U.S. at 459–60.\nIn 1977, local opponents of these measures, having previously failed in their attempt to\nrecall School Board members who had voted for desegregation programs, id. at 460 n.1,\norganized to end Seattle’s use of the programs at the statewide level, id. at 461–62.\nTheir statewide initiative provided that local school boards could not employ mandatory\ndesegregative busing except possibly when required as part of a judicial decree. Id. at\n462–63. In enacting this initiative, the people of Washington thus moved the locus of\npolitical authority over this particular issue from the local to the statewide level,\n“requir[ing] those championing school integration to surmount a considerably higher\nhurdle than persons seeking comparable legislative action.” Id. at 474.\n\n         In both cases where the Court found an impermissible political restructuring, the\nrelevant lawmaking authority was reallocated from a local legislative body to the “more\ncomplex government structure,” id. at 477, of the city- or state-wide general electorate,1\nthereby placing a “comparative structural burden . . . on the political achievement of\nminority interests,” id. at 475 n.17. A key consideration in analyzing a Hunter political\nstructure challenge, therefore, is whether the challenged law impacts the ability of\nminorities to secure “legislation that is their interest” as minorities. Id. at 474; see also\nid. at 475 n.17 (“Thus, in Hunter, the procedures for enacting racial legislation were\nmodified in a such a way as to place effective control in the hands of the citywide\n\n         1\n          In Seattle, Initiative 350 could also have been repealed by the state legislature after a period of\ntwo years.

Given the structural considerations inherent in this type of Equal\nProtection challenge, it is important to fully examine the particular political structures\nat work in this case to determine whether the people of Michigan have restructured the\nstate’s lawmaking process in the manner prohibited by Hunter and Seattle.\n\n                                                     i.\n\n         “The Michigan Constitution confers a unique constitutional status on [its] public\nuniversities and their governing boards.” Federated Publ’ns, Inc. v.

The second category includes “other institutions of higher\neducation established by law having authority to grant baccalaureate degrees.” Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 6.\nThis category includes, for example, Eastern Michigan University, Central Michigan University, and\nGrand Valley State University. See Mich. Const. art. VIII, § 4 (listing universities for which the state\nlegislature shall appropriate moneys). Because the Plaintiffs focus on the universities described in section\nfive, and because it is unclear from the record whether the universities described in section six employ\nrace-conscious admissions policies, the following discussion will primarily pertain to the University of\nMichigan, Michigan State University, and Wayne State University.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/          Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

Const. art. VIII, § 5. Elections are\ntypically staggered, with, for example, an election every two years for regents of the\nUniversity        of     Michigan.

The majority\nopinion concludes that we may not rely on the testimony of university officials because\nthe structure of the colleges and universities is a “question of law, for it is set by\nconstitution, statutes and regulations.” (Maj. Op. at 22.) Here, the nature of the\ndecision-making process for admissions is one of both law and fact, and the witnesses\ngave instructive testimony that was within their personal knowledge.4 Examination of\nthe record is appropriate to ascertain how the decisions at issue are in fact made.\n\n         Although these universities and their respective boards are created by the\nMichigan Constitution, the admissions policies are placed within the control of the\nboards or school authorities only within each board’s bylaws.

Thus, the\nadmissions policies are not set forth by the state constitution, and it is necessary to look\nto testimony to determine where the power to set admissions policy lies.\n\n        The governing boards have fully delegated the responsibility for establishing\nadmissions standards to several program-specific administrative units within each\ninstitution, which set admissions criteria through informal processes that can include a\nfaculty vote. (DE 172, Pls.’ Russ. Mot., Ex. I (Univ. Defs.’ Resp.) Nos. 4, 7; DE 203,\nPls.’ SJ Mot., Ex. E. (Zearfoss Dep.) at 64, 213–14, Ex. F. (Wu Dep.) at 190–91.) For\nexample, as noted by the majority, the University of Michigan Law School admissions\npolicy is set exclusively by the law school faculty admissions committee, with major\nsubstantive changes occasionally voted upon by the entire law school faculty. (Maj. Op.\nat 25 (referring to the admissions committees as “the individuals delegated with principle\nresponsibility for admissions policy”); Zearfoss Dep. at 213.) Similarly, as described by\nits former dean, at the Wayne State University Law School the ultimate decision whether\nto change admissions standards rests with the faculty alone. (Wu Dep. at 190–91.)\nThus, as the Cantrell Plaintiffs readily admit, the “faculty are the primary architects of\nall the admissions criteria and protocols.” (Reply Br. at 20 n.11.)\n\n        At neither university, however, is there a system in place to review or alter\nadmissions policies at a level above a vote of the faculty. Sarah Zearfoss, the dean of\nadmissions at the University of Michigan Law School, testified that no one could change\nthe school’s admissions policy other than the faculty admissions committee or the faculty\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 50\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nitself, because “there’s no higher body” to which someone unhappy with an admissions\npolicy could advocate change. (Zearfoss Dep. at 214.) And Frank Wu, then the dean at\nWayne State University Law School, agreed that “only the faculty at the law school has\nthe authority to create and approve the admissions policy” at the school. (Wu Dep. at\n191.) Indeed, Wu testified that the admissions policy is not subject to the approval of\nthe Wayne State University Board of Governors, and, in his view, if the Board of\nGovernors attempted to alter the decision of the law school’s faculty with respect to\ncriteria for admission, “it would precipitate a constitutional crisis.” (Wu Dep. at 192.)\nEach institution’s board may superficially have “plenary authority” over its respective\ninstitution (see Maj. Op. at 21), but the ultimate authority to set admissions policy rests\nexclusively with each program-specific faculty within the universities.\n\n                                            ii.\n\n        The majority characterizes the dissent as reading Hunter and Seattle too narrowly\nby defining the political processes with which they deal as “electoral” processes. While\nthe political processes in Hunter and Seattle are electoral in the sense that they relate to\nwhat electoral methods are employed to make policy, the majority opinion, not the\ndissent, draws the line between political and electoral. The point is simply that the\nsituation here differs greatly from that of Hunter and Seattle in the ways described in this\nopinion; these program-specific faculty admissions committees are far afield from the\nlegislative bodies from which lawmaking authority was removed in Hunter and Seattle.\nThe most crucial and overarching difference, of course, is that the faculty admissions\ncommittees and individual faculty members are not politically accountable to the people\nof Michigan.\n\n        In Seattle, the court emphasized that the type of action it found objectionable was\nthe creation of comparative burdens “on minority participation in the political process.”\n458 U.S. at 480 n.23; see id. at 486 (“[M]inorities are no less powerless with the vote\nthan without it when a racial criterion is used to assign governmental power in such a\nway as to exclude particular racial groups ‘from effective participation in the political\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/       Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

In dissent, Justice Powell, critiquing the potential breadth of the majority’s\nholding, argued:\n\n        Thus, if the admissions committee of a state law school developed an\n        affirmative-action plan that came under fire, the Court apparently would\n        find it unconstitutional for any higher authority to intervene unless that\n        authority traditionally dictated admissions policies. As a constitutional\n        matter, the dean of the law school, the faculty of the university as a\n        whole, the university president, the chancellor of the university, and the\n        board of regents might be powerless to intervene despite their greater\n        authority under state law.\n\nId. at 498 n.14 (Powell, J., dissenting). The majority, however, flatly dismissed this\nconcern as a misunderstanding of the court’s decision: “It is evident, then, that the\nhorribles paraded by the dissent, post, at [footnote 14 of the dissent]—which have\nnothing to do with the ability of minorities to participate in the process of self-\ngovernment—are entirely unrelated to this case.” Id. at 480 n.23 (emphasis added).\n\n        For the Seattle majority, then, an impermissible reordering of the political\nprocess meant a reordering of the processes through which the people exercise their right\nto govern themselves. See id. at 486 (“And when the State’s allocation of power places\nunusual burdens on the ability of racial groups to enact legislation specifically designed\nto overcome the ‘special condition’ of prejudice, the governmental action seriously\n‘curtail[s] the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect\nminorities’ . . . from the ‘majoritarian political process.’” (emphasis added) (citing\nUnited States v.

Unlike the Seattle School Board and the Akron City Council, the various\nuniversity admissions committees in Michigan and their faculty members are unelected.\nAs at most public universities, tenured faculty members have significant vested rights\nassociated with their employment in order to preserve academic freedom and\nindependence. The faculty members who are permitted to vote on policy matters are\ntherefore significantly insulated from political pressure by virtue of their tenure. Such\nfaculty are beholden to no constituency—student, local, or otherwise.           And, as\ndemonstrated by the testimony of the law school deans in this case, the people of\nMichigan have no ability to exert electoral pressure on the university decision makers\nto change their admissions polices. As they currently stand, the faculty admissions\ncommittees are islands unto themselves, vested with the full and unreviewed authority\nto set admissions policy for their respective university programs.\n\n       The majority opinion discounts the differences between facts here and those of\nHunter and Seattle by arguing that processes are considered “political” as long as there\nis “governmental decisionmaking.” In this argument it relies on Nyquist v. Lee, 318 F.\nSupp. 710 (W.D.N.Y. 1970), aff’d Nyquist v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971), a case from the\nWestern District of New York that was summarily affirmed by the Supreme Court and\ncited in Seattle. In Nyquist, the court found that a New York statute that “prohibit[ed]\nstate education officials and appointed school boards from assigning students, or\nestablishing, reorganizing or maintaining school districts, school zones or attendance\nunits for the purpose of achieving racial equality in attendance” unconstitutionally\nreordered the political process in violation of the Equal Protection Clause. Nyquist, 318\nF. Supp. at 712, 720. The majority suggests that because appointed school boards were\npart of the political process at issue in Nyquist, the university faculty admissions\ncommittees are similarly part of the political process. (Maj. Op. at 20.) The decision in\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/         Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                 Page 53\n1534; 09-1111              Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nNyquist, however, made note of how the local boards were accountable to the\ncommunity: “Parties considering themselves aggrieved by local board actions may seek\nto have the Commissioner enforce those policies. [The New York statute], however,\nsingles out for different treatment all plans which have as their purpose the assignment\nof students in order to alleviate racial imbalance.” Id. at 719 (internal citations omitted).\nThus, even the appointed school boards were accountable to the community in a way in\nwhich the faculty admissions committees certainly are not. Again, the point is not\nselecting a label for the processes, but examining the factual similarities or dissimilarities\nof the situations.\n\n        There is no “local” university constituency as there is a local constituency for a\ncity council or city school board, i.e., the city’s voters. Rather, despite there being a\nbroad student, faculty, and staff community associated with each university, Michigan’s\nstate universities were established as state-wide institutions with a state-wide\nconstituency.5 The faculty admissions committees therefore do not “represent” any local\nconstituency at all. This is particularly important because the Seattle majority looked\nclosely at the fact that Washington’s lodging of political decisionmaking authority over\nthe busing question at the statewide level directly burdened minority interests by\n“making the enactment of racially beneficial legislation difficult, [because] the particular\nprogram might not have inspired opposition had it been promulgated through the usual\n[local] legislative processes used for comparable legislation.” 458 U.S. at 483–84. The\ncourt continued:\n\n        That phenomenon is graphically demonstrated by the circumstances of\n        this litigation. The longstanding desegregation programs in Pasco and\n        Tacoma, as well as the Seattle middle school integration plan, have\n        functioned for years without creating undue controversy. Yet they have\n        been swept away, along with the Seattle Plan, by Initiative 350. As a\n        practical matter, it seems most unlikely that proponents of desegregative\n        busing in small communities such as Tacoma or Pasco will be able to\n\n\n\n        5\n        Indeed, some students, prospective students, alumni, and faculty members at each university are\nnot members of that state-wide constituency, comprised of citizens and voters of the state of Michigan.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.

The availability of “local” decisionmaking is therefore important when\nthe political power of groups who could succeed at the local level is “diluted” in the\nstatewide decisionmaking process. The universities here, however, are statewide\ninstitutions with a statewide constituency. There is nothing local about them.\n\n       The committees are also hardly the model of accessibility and locus of effective\nlobbying assumed by the majority. While members of the public may attend faculty\nmeetings at which admissions standards are reviewed, there is no mechanism by which\na member of the public—student or not—can move the committees to amend the\nadmissions standards. (Wu Dep. at 190; Zearfoss Dep. at 209.) And, while interested\nstudents and members of the public are, with advance notice, permitted to speak at\nfaculty meetings to comment on the admissions policies, the committees are not required\nto consider these comments seriously, issue written findings addressing these concerns,\nor do more than provide a forum for interested individuals to speak. (Zearfoss Dep. at\n209–10; Wu Dep. at 190.) Rather, it appears that the main source of divergent views on\nadmissions policies is the faculty members themselves. (Zearfoss Dep. at 210.)\n\n       While the majority appears to see no reason to distinguish between these\nunelected and unresponsive program-specific faculty admissions committees and the\nlegislative bodies from which lawmaking authority was removed in Hunter and Seattle,\na consideration of political accountability in the political process is squarely grounded\nin the Seattle opinion.    In Seattle, the Court undertook a close examination of\nWashington’s system of “establish[ing] the local school board, rather than the State, as\nthe entity charged with making decisions of the type at issue,” 458 U.S. at 477:\n\n       But Washington has chosen to meet its educational responsibilities\n       primarily through “state and local officials, boards, and committees,” and\n       the responsibility to devise and tailor educational programs to suit local\n       needs has emphatically been vested in the local school boards. . . . Thus\n       “each common school district board of directors” is made “accountable\n       for the proper operation of [its] district to the local community and its\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.         Page 55\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\n       electorate.” To this end, each school board is “vested with the final\n       responsibility for the setting of policies ensuring quality in the content\n       and the extent of its educational program.”\n\nId. at 478 (citations omitted) (emphasis added); see also id. (noting the “disclosure and\nreporting provisions specifically designed to ensure the board’s ‘accountability’ to the\npeople of the community” (emphasis added)). It was only upon its consideration of the\nstate statutory structure’s vesting of decisionmaking in local and politically accountable\nschool boards that the Court could conclude that “placing power over desgregative\nbusing at the state level . . . restructured the Washington political process.” Id. at 480.\n\n       Taking this into account, it is difficult to conclude that, in amending their state\nconstitution to prohibit the use of racial preferences in university admissions, the people\nof Michigan modified “the community’s political mechanisms . . . to place effective\ndecisionmaking authority over a racial issue at another level of government.” Id. at 474\n(emphasis added). Michigan has not “‘burden[d] all future attempts’ to implement race-\nconscious admissions policies” “‘by lodging decisionmaking authority over the question\nat a new and remote level of government.’” (Maj. Op. at 28 (quoting Seattle, 458 U.S.\nat 483).) Having no direct or indirect influence on the bodies vested with authority to\nset admissions standards—the faculty committees—the people of Michigan made a\npolitical change at the only level of government actually available to them as voters. The\nMichigan electorate, therefore, as opposed to choosing a more complex structure for\nlawmaking, employed the one method available to exert electoral pressure on the\nmechanisms of government.\n\n       The lack of a viable electoral mechanism to change university admissions\npolicies at a sub-constitutional level also means that the voters’ use of a constitutional\namendment in this instance also does not serve to create “comparative structural\nburden[s] on the political achievement of minority interests.” Seattle, 458 U.S. at 474\nn.17. If, as is the evidence before this court, the voters cannot exert electoral pressure\non the fully independent faculty committees, then all voters regardless of racial identity\ncompete on the same level for the political achievement of their higher-education\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/           Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.                   Page 56\n1534; 09-1111                Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\ninterests: the constitutional level. That some academic decisionmaking remains at the\nfaculty-committee level after the implementation of Proposal 2 is of no moment, because\nthat decisionmaking is affirmatively not part of the state’s electoral political process.\nThe same policies that fully insulate faculty members from political opprobrium in their\nacademic pursuits also protect them from political influence on their admissions\npolicymaking. Michigan has chosen to structure its university system such that politics\nplays no part in university admissions at all levels within its constitutionally created\nuniversities. The Michigan voters have therefore not restructured the political process\nin their state by amending their state constitution; they have merely employed it.6\n\n                                                   III.\n\n         If Proposal 2 does not effectuate an invalid restructuring of Michigan’s political\nprocess, it is not necessary to reach broader questions relating to the substantive reach\nof the political restructuring doctrine. But again returning to the broader context, it is\nuseful to highlight the tension between the doctrine and recent decisional law on the\nconstitutionality of racial preferences.\n\n         Several courts have grappled with the question of whether racial preferences,\nthose policies “potentially so dangerous” that they must be subject to strict scrutiny and\n“limited in time,” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 342, may be eliminated when the people of a state\namend their constitution to do away with all classifications based on race. The core\n\n\n         6\n           Even if—contrary to the evidence before the court—the people of Michigan could exercise\neffective electoral control over the board of governors at each respective state institution such that they\ncould repeal the use of racial preferences, it is not clear that a choice to make use of a constitutional\namendment in that instance would amount to the creation of a comparative political burden on the\nachievement of minority interests. Indeed, it would make use of neither a more complex or onerous\nstructure of government nor remove the locus of political power from the local to statewide level. Seattle,\n458 U.S. at 477, 480. Given the eight-year terms and staggered elections for board members, and the fact\nthat electoral change must happen at the governing board of each individual state university, the process\nof effectuating political change through the board of governors appears to be arguably a more complex\nprocess than the comparative burden of a statewide referendum. And both types of elections—the board\nmember elections and the constitutional referendum—occur at the statewide level with an electorate\ncomposed of the at-large statewide voting pool. There are therefore no inherent structural benefits or\nprotections for minority voters in one system over the other. As opposed to the multi-district Akron city\ncouncil in Hunter, for example, there is no mechanism by which minority voters could exercise bloc or\nregional voting in the board of governors system in a way that they could not in the state’s constitutional\nreferendum process. The use of the constitutional amendment mechanism, therefore, would not work to\ncreate a comparative political burden of the kind found in Hunter and Seattle.\n\fNos. 08-1387/1389/      Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, et al. v.          Page 57\n1534; 09-1111           Regents of the Univ. of Mich., et al.\n\n\nconstitutional question in each of these decisions is clear: should a race-based\nclassification that is presumptively invalid, but permissible under limited circumstances\nand for a finite period of time, receive the same structural protections against statewide\npopular repeal as other laws that inure to the interest of minorities?\n\n        The Ninth Circuit in Wilson answered in the negative, concluding that\nCalifornia’s Proposition 209 did not violate equal protection because “[i]mpediments to\npreferential treatment do not deny equal protection.” 122 F.3d at 708. The court relied\non an essential constitutional principle: “While the Constitution protects against\nobstructions to equal treatment, it erects obstructions to preferential treatment by its own\nterms. . . . The Equal Protection Clause, parked at our most ‘distant and remote’ level\nof government, singles out racial preferences for severe political burdens—it prohibits\nthem in all but the most compelling circumstances.” Id. The California Supreme Court\nrecently agreed with this conclusion, holding that “Seattle cannot fairly be read as\nholding that the political structure doctrine protects presumptively unconstitutional racial\npreferences, as opposed to programs intended to bring about immediate equal treatment.”\nCoral Constr., Inc. v.

In so holding, the Supreme Court cited the\n‘race neutral alternatives’ to racial preferences used by ‘[universities], where racial\npreferences are prohibited by state law.’” Id.

We therefore must\nreview them with utmost care. Governing precedent is clear on this point: “‘A core\npurpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to do away with all governmentally imposed\ndiscrimination based on race,’” Grutter, 539 U.S. at 341–42 (quoting Palmore, 466 U.S.\nat 432), and “all governmental use of race must have a logical end point,” id. at 342.\nBecause racial preference programs are exceptional, it is not altogether clear that the\npolitical structure doctrine would invalidate Proposal 2 even if it worked a restructuring\nof the political process in Michigan. See Coral, 235 P.3d at 966 (Corrigan, J.,\nconcurring) (noting that the United States Supreme Court has “approvingly referred to\n[California’s Proposition 209] as a step in [the] direction” of ending the “governmental\nuse of race” (citing Grutter, 538 U.S. at 342)).

Coal. to Defend Affirmative Action, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 951. Although the district court did find “sufficient evidence to establish a fact\nquestion on the disparate impact part of the test,” it did not find a discriminatory\npurpose. Id. Indeed, it stated that “the demonstration of a discriminatory purpose . . .\ndooms [the] conventional equal protection argument.” Id. Furthermore, the district\ncourt found the equal protection argument based on gender “even less compelling” due\nto the less exacting level of scrutiny. Id. at 952. I agree with the conclusions of the\ndistrict court.\n\n        Proposal 2 does not establish a facial racial classification because its text does\nnot draw distinctions on the basis of race; in fact, it prohibits them. Additionally,\nProposal 2 does not classify racially on an impact theory because it lacks a\ndiscriminatory purpose. “[A]bsent a referendum that facially discriminates racially, or\none where although facially neutral, the only possible rationale is racially motivated, a\ndistrict court cannot inquire into the electorate’s motivations in an equal protection\nclause context.” Arthur v. Toledo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463766\"><a href=\"/opinion/463766/tony-arthur-deceased-peggy-arthur-on-her-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-all/\"><span class=\"volume\">782</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574 (6th Cir. 1986). Thus, no\nheightened level of scrutiny need be applied to Proposal 2, and under rational basis\nreview, Proposal 2 is easily justifiable. Proposal 2 does not violate the Equal Protection\nClause under the conventional analysis.\n\n                                             V.\n\n        For the foregoing reasons, I would conclude that Proposal 2 does not violate the\nEqual Protection Clause of the United States Constitution under either a political\nrestructuring theory or traditional theory of Equal Protection. Accordingly, I would\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\n\f</pre>",
