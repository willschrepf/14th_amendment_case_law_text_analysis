Publication was deferred\npending parties’ review for redaction of protected material. The court adopted\nthe parties’ suggested redaction, which is indicated by brackets, and made\nother minor editorial changes. The opinion is now prepared for release.\n\fBRUGGINK, Judge.\n\n        Before the court is a dispute involving a contract between the United\nStates, acting through the Department of State (“DOS”), and Kullman\nIndustries, Inc. (“KI”), a company now no longer in business, which at the\ntime specialized in large-scale modular construction. The contract obligated\nKI to build the United States Embassy compound in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.\nKullman Industries worked on the project for nearly three years and nearly\nbrought it to completion before the contract was terminated by DOS for\ndefault. KI went into bankruptcy, and the trustee in bankruptcy succeeded to\nits interests, although we will refer to KI rather than the trustee throughout.\n\n        KI advances three claims here: first, it challenges the agency’s\ntermination for default and seeks conversion to a termination for convenience;\nsecond, it advances a claim of approximately $4.3 million for geotechnical\nwork, which it contends was outside the terms of the contract; and it asserts a\nclaim of approximately $1 million with respect to additional security\nremediation and related mold and mildew mitigation. The government has\ncounterclaimed, asserting fraud and seeking both monetary penalties and\nforfeiture of KI’s claims. The court has jurisdiction to resolve plaintiff’s\nclaims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. §§ 7101-7109\n(2012), and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 2508 (2012), to adjudicate\ndefendant’s counterclaims.\n\n        The various affirmative and defensive claims were tried between April\nand June, 2013. The trial dealt with four issues: 1) whether a portion of the\ngeotechnical work was outside the scope of the contract; 2) whether the\ntermination for default was justified; 3) whether certain pay certifications were\nfalse; and 4) which party bore the responsibility for delays and additional costs\nassociated with construction of a secure part of the embassy. Post-trial briefs\nwere filed by both parties, and oral argument was heard on January 15, 2014,\nafter which supplemental briefs were filed. The matter is ready for final\ndisposition. For the following reasons, we find that the geotechnical work was\nwithin the scope of the contract, the termination for default was justified,\nplaintiff did not violate the Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act, although it\ndid violate the False Claims Act, and the government bears responsibility for\nthe delays and additional costs associated with the secure space. We reserve\nfor later resolution the question of damages.\n\n\n                                       2\n\f                             BACKGROUND\n\nI.     Kullman Industries\n\n        Kullman Industries was a family enterprise. The most recent President\nand CEO of KI was Robert Kullman, who featured prominently as a witness\nat trial and whose testimony we find to be credible. Mr. Kullman’s\ngrandfather founded Kullman Dining Car Company, Inc. in the 1920’s.\nKullman Dining Car Company successfully built and sold modular diners in\na way that was faster and more easily financed than traditional construction.\nThe company would fully construct the modular diner in its factory and then\ninstall it on the buyer’s property.\n\n        Over the years, that company expanded from production of small diners\nto 6,000-plus square foot restaurants. As a teenager, Robert Kullman got his\nstart in the family business by sweeping floors, painting, and working\ncarpentry jobs. After high school, Robert Kullman attended Bucknell\nUniversity. During the summers, he continued to work at Kullman Dining Car\nCompany. The day after he graduated from college, Robert Kullman joined\nthe family enterprise as Vice President.\n\n        In the 1970’s, when the market for diners began to wane, Robert\nKullman and his father jointly created Kullman Industries in an effort to\nbroaden production and grow the business. KI began using its modular\nmethod to construct bank branches, medical buildings, and schools. The\nbuildings became larger and more complicated. When cellular telephones\nwere in their infancy, KI got into market for building modular structures for\nthe telecommunications industry.\n\n       In the 1990’s, KI began working on projects for DOS. KI built the\nUnited States Embassies in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan;\nand Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Just before KI contracted to build the embassy in\nDushanbe, it was doing about $55 million dollars of business each year. Mr.\nKullman was the President and CEO of KI from the 1980’s until it was\ndissolved in bankruptcy.\n\nII.    The Dushanbe Project: Phase I\n\n       In light of its satisfactory performance of its previous contracts, the\nState Department began discussing with KI in April of 2002 the project to\n\n                                      3\n\fbuild a new embassy in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. According to the testimony of\nKI’s Chief Operating Officer, John Joseph Lefkus, III, DOS was interested in\npursuing modular construction for the Dushanbe Embassy because of the short\nperiod of time required for construction and installation when compared with\ntraditional construction and the added benefits to security when construction\nis controlled within a factory.\n\n       A.     Phase I - Design\n\n        Because of KI’s unique qualifications, on July 2, 2002, the Director and\nChief Operating Officer of DOS’s Overseas Building Operations (“OBO”),\nGeneral Charles E. Williams, agreed to use of a sole source contract with KI\nfor the Dushanbe project. The stated justification for using other than full and\nopen competition was that “Kullman Industries, Inc. offers a more direct way\nto contract, provides a superior product that meets DS[2] requirements, and, in\naddition, has greater experience in servicing the requirements of the\nDepartment.” JX 128 at 3. OBO anticipated a construction budget of\n$63,920,000.\n\n      The DOS Contracting Officer (“CO”) assigned to the Dushanbe project\nat that time was Ralph R. Sutherland. The Contracting Officer’s\nRepresentative (“COR”) was Robert H. Sanders. John Lefkus, KI’s Chief\nOperating Officer, represented KI in negotiations.\n\n        On July 12, 2002, DOS’s Office of Acquisitions issued solicitation\nSALMEC-02-C-0025 for “Phase I”3 to develop a plan for the adaptation of the\nstandard embassy design to accommodate modular construction and to\nfacilitate a cost estimate for the Dushanbe embassy. The embassy compound\nwas to include a New Office Building (“NOB”), also known as the chancery,\nthe Marine Security Guard Quarters, Warehouse, Compound Access Control\n(“CAC” or “gate house”) Building, Material Transfer Station, utility building,\npower plant, well water treatment system, septic system, and a perimeter wall\nfor the compound. The contractor would have 85 days to complete the Phase\nI design. The solicitation included over one hundred pages of contract details\n\n2\n Neither party has clarified what “DS” means. In the absence of a clear\ndefinition of this acronym, we presume it to refer to “Diplomatic Security.”\n3\n The project was divided into two phases. The first was the design phase and\nthe second phase consisted of construction.\n\n                                       4\n\fcovering everything from pricing to the Statement of Work (“SOW”) and\nreferenced additional attachments such as the Standard Embassy Design Intent\nApplication Manual (“SED manual”), the Site Utilization Plan, and a\nPreliminary Geotechnical Report. The SED manual included “the fixed design\nelements—the ‘absolutes’ that every project using the Standard Embassy\nDesign (SED) must follow.” JX 16 at 1, 4. Pursuant to the SED manual, some\nelements of the standard design were fixed while other elements could be\nadapted to fit the needs of each project.\n\n       The SED also provided specifications for a Controlled Access Area\n(“CAA”). The CAA was designed as a room within the embassy that contains\nspecial protections for information and occupants.\n\n       KI submitted its best and final offer for Phase I of the Dushanbe\ncontract on August 20, 2002. DOS accepted KI’s offer and issued the notice\nto proceed on August 22, 2002. JX 1 at 2. The contract for Phase I was not\nexecuted by Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Lefkus, however, until September 18,\n2002. On that same day, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Lefkus also executed\nModification 001 (“M001”). M001 incorporated several attachments to\nDivision 1 of the contract and rescinded “Section J,” which included the\nDushanbe Geological Overview, and replaced it with “Section J, Revision 1.”4\n\n        While KI worked on Phase I, DOS commissioned the Committee of\nArchitecture and Building within the Province of the Government of the\nRepublic of Tajikistan (“SANIIOSP”) to survey, test, and develop a report on\nthe geotechnical conditions at potential sites for the project. SANIIOSP\nproduced a report (“geotechnical report” or “SANIIOSP report”), initially in\nRussian and then translated into English, on the geotechnical conditions at the\nsite that was eventually chosen for the Dushanbe project. The geotechnical\nreport, while perhaps difficult to read, alerted the reader to what the drafters\nthought were unusual soil conditions. It reflected that the “main deformation\ncharacteristics of the dusty clay soils, which consist of the sand clay and loamy\nsoils are the properties of the settlement while putting into the water and the\n\n\n4\n  In addition, M001 provided that “[t]he contractor’s proposal for Phase II of\nthe contract shall include costs to perform requirements described in the\ndocuments” newly incorporated by M001. JX 2 at 1. The contract for Phase\nI had a firm fixed-price of $1,025,000.00. Phase II construction of the\nEmbassy was not guaranteed after the completion of Phase I.\n\n                                       5\n\ffirst settlement pressure.” JX 10 at 9. Additionally, “[t]he summary quantity\nof the possible settlement of the soils because of their own weight can reach\n54.84cm with the power of the depth of settlement 16.7m.” JX 10 at 16.\nFurthermore, the report provided the following:\n\n       The experience of the exploitation of the buildings in the\n       analogous soil conditions on the territory of Dushanbe shows\n       that the increase of the moisture content of the soils inevitably\n       takes place while the engineering development of the territory\n       because of the break down of the natural regime of the expense\n       of the different factors (natural and anthropogene). These\n       changes make [worse] the deformation and strength properties\n       of the clay soils, the properties of the settlement take place, the\n       lack of the engineering preparation of the territory can lead to\n       the deformation of the buildings. . . . [I]t is recommended to do\n       the projection taking into consideration the full water satiation\n       of the clay soils.\n\nJX 10 at 15-16. The geotechnical report therefore recommended wetting “the\nsoil thickness up to the depth of 17m . . . .” JX 10 at 18-19.\n\n       KI teamed with the Louis Berger Group (“LBG”), which specializes in\ngeotechnical engineering, to address the issues involved in developing a\nfoundation appropriate to the natural conditions of the site. According to an\nAugust 30, 2002 memo, LBG “received a copy of the Geotechnical Report\nfrom OBO on August 16, 2002.” JX 135 at 1.5 On August 30, 2002, Vassilios\nMagginas, an architect with DOS, wrote in an e-mail that he had reviewed the\nSANIIOSP report and that it was “good, confirms our previous findings, and\ncontains the basic information to be used for the project.” JX 134 at 1.\n\n       B.     Site Visit\n\n       Phase I included a visit to potential construction sites in Dushanbe,\nTajikistan. KI’s representatives, including Mike Kosinski and Bob Airrika,\ntraveled to Dushanbe on September 10, 2002, to conduct a site visit and to\n\n\n5\n  Although there was a dispute at trial as to when KI or its representatives first\nsaw the SANIIOSP Report, we find that it was available to plaintiff before it\nprovided its late-September cost estimate.\n\n                                        6\n\fexplore local resources. According to the Contractor’s Trip Report (“Trip\nReport”) authored by KI, the site visit lasted until September 14, 2002. JX 137\nat 10. The KI representatives were joined by Michael “Mike” Ross, the\nContracting Officer’s Representative and Pete Stella from the government.6\nDuring a meeting that occurred on September 10, 2002, KI attendees were\ngiven a CD-ROM disc containing the “Section-J attachments from the RFQ.”\nJX 137 at 22. Pete Stella, Reese Richardson, John Smith, Mike Kosinski and\nBob Airikka met with the Director of SANIIOSP, Saidor Rakhmatullo, who\n“indicated that much of the information available for the site was already\nincluded in the geotech report they had prepared.” JX 137 at 9. Mr.\nRakhmatullo offered to provide additional services such as soil testing,\nsurveying, and designing, but told the meeting participants that SANIIOSP did\nnot have the necessary equipment to meet the standards set by the American\nSociety for Testing and Materials (“ASTM”). According to the meeting\nminutes, OBO was satisfied with the content of the SANIIOSP report. In the\nTrip Report, KI expressed general satisfaction with the information gathered\nduring the site visit and acknowledged that “OBO provided a geotechnical\nreport for the property prior to the site visit.” JX 137 at 3-4.\n\n       C.     Negotiations\n\n       Negotiations for Phase II, the separate contract to build the embassy,\nbegan in earnest promptly after the site visit ended. The key issue was price.\nOn September 20, 2002, Ralph Sutherland wrote the following to his superiors\nwithin OBO, Leroy Wallin, the Director of the Facilities Design and\nConstruction Division, and Patricia Regalo-Warren, the Branch Chief:\n\n       The contractor cannot currently provide an accurate cost\n       proposal for construction and is reluctant to enter into a GMP\n       contract at this point. . . . Assuming that the cost [that KI\n       proposes] is not too outrageous, we will work with the\n       contractor to establish mutually acceptable terms in determining\n       the mechanics of converting the construction portion of the\n       contract into a negotiated fixed price at the (approximate) 30%\n       design stage. The contract can be structured in a manner that\n       will obligate the money (using options for other means) for the\n\n\n6\n  Although Mr. Sutherland is listed as a team member in the trip report, he\ntestified that he was not in Dushanbe for the site visit.\n\n                                      7\n\f       construction phase of the project at the time of contract award.\n\nJX 138 at 1.\n\n        As of September 24, 2002, the government estimated that the Dushanbe\nEmbassy complex could be built for approximately $58,365,000. According\nto this estimate, the “substructure” or foundations for the NOB should cost\nabout $1,200,000. “SITEWORK - (EXCLUDING PERIMETER WALLS)”\nshowed a line item value of $2,750,000. JX 139 at 7. Site work included site\npreparation, improvements, civil and mechanical utilities, and electrical\nutilities. $12,700,000 was allocated for estimated transportation costs\nassociated with moving materials and personnel to the site.\n\n        On September 25, 2002, KI submitted its “Order of Magnitude Pricing”\nto the government. Plaintiff offered Contracting Officer Ralph Sutherland a\ntotal cost estimate of $85,761,803. “Local geotech” was a $25,000 line item\nincluded in that number. Transportation of materials to the site, security\ndesign, landscaping, and furniture, however, were listed as allowances in\nspecific amounts, presumably meaning that costs in excess of those allowances\nwould be borne by DOS.\n\n        Ralph Sutherland wrote to Bob Sanders on September 25, 2002, that\nKI’s initial proposed price of $85,181,803 was $26,816,803 above the\ngovernment’s estimate. Mr. Sutherland asked that Mr. Sanders “advise OBO\nsenior management accordingly and show me the money if OBO wishes to\ncontinue pursuing the Kullman design-build SED/modular approach for the\nDushanbe NOB project.” JX 140 at 1 (emphasis in original). Mr. Sutherland\nemphasized, “I need to know how much money we have before I can\nestablish negotiation objectives and limitations and I need time to put a\npre-negotiation plan together. I do not have any funded requisitions for this\nproject at the present time.” JX 140 at 1 (emphasis in original). Mr.\nSutherland added, “John Lefkus has informed me that the prices are high\nbecause of limited time and information to put together a proposal for a project\nof this magnitude. He will be able to negotiate a realistic firm fixed price with\nus at the end of the Phase I design development (November 2002).” JX 140\nat 1.\n\n      Negotiations continued during the period September 27-30, 2002. On\nSeptember 30, 2002, Mr. Sutherland wrote to John Lefkus that KI’s September\n25 proposal was unacceptable. Mr. Sutherland explained that the estimate\n\n                                       8\n\fwas too high and asked KI to “consider a GMP [guaranteed maximum price]\noffer of $60,730,000 in a fixed price contract, without incentives.” JX 143 at\n1 (emphasis in original). Mr. Sutherland concluded the e-mail by writing, “If\nwe do not reach agreement this morning, the project may not be awarded to\nKullman because of what we can afford.” JX 143 at 1. Presumably this was\nbecause September 30 was the last day of the government’s fiscal year. Mr.\nSutherland also proposed certain deletions from the SOW.\n\n       Later that day, Mr. Lefkus responded to Mr. Sutherland’s\ncommunication. Mr. Lefkus summed up the changes in the scope of work,\nwhich included reducing the number of gate houses, reducing by 200 lineal\nmeters the perimeter wall, and reducing the size and function of the utility\nbuilding. Mr. Lefkus then lowered the proposed allowance for transportation\nto $10 million based on the following: “[f]actors which reduce project scope;”\n“[p]otential of local sourcing;” and “[r]equirement to ship only 50% of volume\nU.S. flag.” JX 145 at 1. Based on these changes, KI agreed to “entertain a\nGMP of $60,730,000.00 noting the $10 million transportation allowance.” JX\n145 at 1.\n\n       On September 30, 2002, DOS issued Modification number two\n(“M002”) to the contract and obligated available funds. The amendment was\nissued “for a guaranteed maximum price of $50.730 Mil plus an allowance of\n$10.0 Mil for transportation.” JX 149 at 5.\n\n      Shortly after Mr. Sutherland closed this deal, Mr. Sanders referred to\nMr. Sutherland as a “miracle worker.” JX 148 at 1. Mr. Sanders was replaced\nas COR by Michael (“Mike”) Ross on October 2, 2002.7\n\n\n7\n  There was a lot of turnover in the OBO employees who managed the\nDushanbe Project. The parties stipulated to the following chronology of the\nContracting Officers: from July 2002 until December 11, 2003, Ralph\nSutherland was the CO; from December 11, 2003, until June 16, 2004, Lorri\nLowther was the CO; from June 17, 2004, until July 15, 2004, Lisa Goodwine\nwas the CO; from July 15, 2004, until October 26, 2004, Brian Mulcahy was\nthe CO; and then from October 26, 2004, until the contract was terminated on\nJune 17, 2005, Lorri Lowther served a second stint as CO. The CO was\nassisted by a COR who also carried the title of Project Executive. The first\nCOR was Robert Sanders from July 2002 to October 2, 2002, then Michael\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                      9\n\f       D.     Terms of the Contract\n\n       Through M002, the terms of and attachments to the solicitation were\nmade part of the contract pursuant to which KI agreed to build the embassy.\nIn addition, it provided the following with respect to pricing:\n\n       Kullman Industries [sic] proposal of $60,730,000 dated\n       September 30, 2002[,] is hereby accepted by the Government.\n       The Contractor shall perform Phase II design, construction and\n       fabrication of the new U.S. Embassy compound in Dushanbe,\n       Tajikistan in accordance with contract number SALMEC-02-C-\n       0025, as modified heretofore. This work is to be performed for\n       a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) of $50,730,000, plus an\n       allowance of $10,000,000 for Transportation. The GMP will be\n       evaluated and a fixed price for phase II will be negotiated upon\n       completion of Phase I of this contract. A written Notice to\n       Proceed must be issued prior to performance of Phase II\n       services.\n\nJX 3 at 1. The following provisions regarding price were also included in or\nattached to the solicitation and were thereby incorporated by reference into\nM002:\n\n       B.1 PRICING\n       B.1.1 The Contract Price includes all labor, materials,\n       equipment, and services necessary to accomplish the design and\n       construction required by the Contract Documents, including\n       applicable customs duties, transportation to the site, storage,\n       premiums for insurance and bonds required by the Solicitation\n       Documents and/or the Contract Documents, permits, license,\n       and inspection fees, and all other items called for by the contract\n       or otherwise necessary for performance of the contract.

The Contractor’s geotechnical engineer shall review\n       all available geotechnical information provided in the Contract\n       package and become familiar with the soil and site conditions at\n       the project site by visiting the site. During the site visit and in\n       subsequent phases of the project, the Contractor shall examine\n       and/or verify the information provided and obtain any additional\n       information to complete the design and construction of the\n       project. The Contractor remains solely responsible and liable\n       for design sufficiency and should not depend on reports\n       provided by the USG as part of the contract documents.\n\nJX 1 at 26. Additionally, the SOW provides,\n\n       The geotechnical consultant shall be consulted during the site\n       design to provide recommendations and design for site retaining\n       structures, ground modification[] methods, pavement structural\n       design, and subsurface drainage.\n\nJX 1 at 31. The SOW continues with the following directions about the\ngeotechnical consultant’s role in the project:\n\n       The geotechnical consultant shall continue providing services\n       during construction, especially during the construction of\n       foundations, pile loading test, ground modification, retaining\n       systems, etc. to confirm the recommendations provided during\n       the design stage of the project.\n\nJX 1 at 34.\n\n        Pursuant to Section F of the contract, KI was required to submit a report\ndetailing its geotechnical investigation 57 days after the date of the first Notice\nto Proceed. Similarly, it was the contractor’s responsibility to visit “the project\nsite and verifying all pertinent site conditions.” JX 1 at 83. The contract also\nreferenced an attachment, J.3.7 “Dushanbe Geological Overview,” which\nprovided the following general description of the geotechnical conditions:\n\n                                        12\n\f       From the engineering and geotechnical standpoint, the site is\n       suitable for the proposed NOB. However, due to the geologic\n       setting of the entire city as well as the high seismicity of the\n       area, additional site development costs may be anticipated\n       including sub-grade preparation and foundations, re-grading/fill\n       of the site, and utilities.\n\n       Dushanbe is located in a region in which collapsible silt/clay\n       soils occupy the upper 15-18 meters. These soils are very\n       sensitive to moisture and require special foundation sub-grade\n       preparation. Below the silt/clay layer, alluvial sand and gravel\n       soils extend to a depth greater than 50 meters. The permanent\n       water table may exist at much shallower depths at this site. For\n       a NOB up to 3 stories in height, a mat foundation is anticipated\n       as the most likely system to support the proposed structure. For\n       heavier structures, piles may be required. Both systems are\n       commonly used in Dushanbe. Further geotechnical studies are\n       required to confirm our findings. A thorough geological\n       investigation of the site is currently in progress and will be\n       completed within the next few weeks.\n\n       According to the local Geologic and Foundation Institute, the\n       site is located in seismic zone 9 (per Soviet standards). OBO’s\n       level of seismicity defines Dushanbe as zone 4 per UBC.\n       Regardless, the seismicity level is considered very high and any\n       future structures need to be designed accordingly. As compared\n       to other locations, the site has a thicker overburden of\n       collapsible soils.\n\nJX 11 (emphasis added); see also JX 1 at 109.\n\n        The contract incorporated FAR 52.211-12, giving the government\nauthority to assess liquidate damages, which initially were set at $8,500.00 per\nday. With respect to excusable days of delay, it provided that “[t]he Contractor\nwill be allowed time, not money, for excusable delays as defined in FAR\n52.249-10.” JX 1 at 48. Excusable delays include, among other things, “(1)\nacts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the United States Government\nin either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) acts of the government of the\nhost country in its sovereign capacity, . . . (11) delays in delivery of\nGovernment furnished equipment and (12) unusually severe weather.” JX 1\n\n                                       13\n\fat 48.\n\n        Division 1 of the contract, which was included in the solicitation\npursuant to M001, contained provisions about security details, temporary\nutilities, and the schedule of values. The contract required the contractor to\ninvoice the government for periodic payment based on the percentage of work\ncompleted for each line item on a schedule of values developed by the\ncontracting officer and to include on the invoice a certification stating that the\ncontractor had paid its subcontractors and suppliers.\n\n       The security measures described in Division 1 were necessary to\nmaintain the integrity of the CAA. One of the ways to ensure the security of\nthe CAA is to limit access by “[u]ncleared personnel” unless “accompanied by\na [Construction Surveillance Technician] CST.” JX 14 at 5. In order for\nforeign nationals to be cleared for access to work on the CAA, they had to\n“submit to a background investigation and be approved by the [Site Security\nManager] SSM before access is granted to Project Site.” JX 14 at 4. If the\nforeign national’s application for access to the site was pending but not yet\napproved, the Site Security Manager (“SSM”) had discretion to permit the\nforeign national to perform limited work on site.\n\n        In addition to describing who could access the CAA during\nconstruction, and in order to maintain the integrity of the CAA once built,\nDivision 1 also set out procedures for securely producing and shipping to the\nsite the materials incorporated into the CAA.8 Once the modular panels that\nwere to be used as floors and walls were built in New Jersey and certified as\ncompliant with relevant security precautions, containers of materials or\nmodules traveled to the project site in Dushanbe, where security officers would\n“de-certify” the container. This involved the following: “1.) inspection of\ncontainer exterior and dunnage wall, 2.) removal of dunnage wall by\ncontractor, 3.) removal of all material by contractor in accordance with site\nsecurity procedures and 4.) inspection of interior of container by decertifying\nofficer.” JX 15 at 9.\n\n       Once the secure shipment was inspected it would be moved “to [a]\nsecure storage area until required for installation in CAA.” JX 14 at 16.\n\n\n8\n The details of secure shipping and production are classified and will not be\ndescribed.\n\n                                       14\n\fElsewhere the contract provided that “[t]he Government shall consider\nnoncompliance with the security regulations by the Contractor or his\nemployees, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. to be sufficient grounds for\ntermination of the contract for default.” JX 1 at 84.\n\n       The government also maintained the right, after a secure shipment was\ncomplete, “to determine whether products have been compromised and\ntherefore cannot be used in a CAA or contiguous space. Where such\ncompromise results from the Contractor’s failure to comply with security\nprocedures, the Contractor shall bear entire cost associated with rectifying\ncompromise and restoration of fundamental secure nature of product(s)\naffected.” JX 14 at 7-8. Division 1 provided, however, that “[i]n instances\nwhere authorized work must be disassembled, uncovered, or demolished to\naccommodate inspection and then reassembled, recovered, or rebuilt, resultant\ncosts of such actions shall be borne by Government where inspected work is\nfound to be in conformance with Construction Specifications and security\nrequirements.” JX 14 at 19.\n\n        Regarding utilities, Division 1 required the contractor to provide\ntemporary water, sewer, electrical power, and telecommunications, throughout\nthe course of the project. The contractor was directed to “[c]onnect to existing\nfranchised utilities for required services, where reasonably possible.” JX 12\nat 5. “At the earliest reasonable date, [the contractor should] connect with\npermanent utility lines and service connections, and remove temporary\nutilities/services; comply with the Project Director’s requests.” JX 12 at 6. In\naddition to temporary utilities, the contractor was obligated to provide\ntemporary office facilities and equipment, including computer systems.\n\n       E.     Performing Phase I\n\n         In November of 2002, KI submitted an initial design, which the\ngovernment rejected in part because the design for the foundation was\ndeficient. KI then sent LBG representatives to Dushanbe in January of 2003\nto test the soil conditions and recommend a foundation design. LBG issued a\ndraft report in late March that agreed with the SANIIOSP findings and\nrecommended the same approach contained in the earlier SANIIOSP\ngeotechnical report, i.e., attempting to compress the foundation soils by an\nextensive flooding and de-watering system.\n\n       DOS eventually approved KI’s Phase I plan to use a modular approach\n\n                                      15\n\fto constructing most of the embassy structures. The NOB, for example, was\nassembled of six sided metal boxes, approximately 10 feet wide, 10 feet high,\nand 30 feet long. Each module weighed anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000\npounds. These boxes were fabricated at KI’s New Jersey plant in a process\nthat started with constructing a six-sided steel frame, pouring concrete in the\nbase, building walls, and then adding finishes like drywall, flooring, and\ninfrastructure for utilities. Then the modules were shipped via boat and train\nto Dushanbe where they were stacked up on the foundation to constitute the\nbuilding. Once the module was hoisted into place with a crane, KI employees\nwould weld them together. The process would repeat as more stories were\nadded to the building. Over 200 modules were used in the construction of the\nDushanbe NOB.\n\nIII.     The Dushanbe Project: Phase II\n\n         A.     Continued Negotiations Over Price\n\n        Although M002 reads as if it were a complete agreement by the parties,\nKI took the position early on in contract performance, and argues in this\nlitigation, that M002 left room for the parties to revisit the contract price,\nspecifically in connection with what it would cost plaintiff to do the\npreliminary work (geotechnical) for the foundations. Mr. Lefkus testified that,\nwhen KI agreed to M002, it did so with the understanding that the parties\nwould renegotiate a firm fixed price once Phase I was complete and that KI\nwas not at risk because, even though it had agreed to perform the project for\na GMP of $60.7 million, that did not obligate KI to a specific type of\nperformance when there was no agreed upon design. Mr. Lefkus believed that\nthe sole function of M002 was to secure the funding that was available in\nfiscal year 2002, which would have otherwise lapsed on October 1, 2002. This\nis contrary to Mr. Sutherland’s understanding that under M002, the\ngovernment could require the contractor to perform the contract as written for\nthe agreed upon price.\n\n       Mr. Sutherland was willing, however, to discuss an adjustment in price.\nIn an effort to negotiate a mutually acceptable price, Mr. Sutherland met on\nMay 1, 2003, with KI representatives, including Alan Rand,9 who was newly\n\n\n9\n    Mr. Rand had proposed $69.5 million as a firm fixed price for the contract\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                       16\n\fappointed by KI as its Vice President for Federal Contracts, and who was\ngiven responsibility for overseeing the Dushanbe project. In a letter dated May\n2, 2003, Mr. Rand, wrote the following to Mr. Sutherland:\n\n       As we discussed on May 1, we will treat the unknown and\n       unforeseen geo-technical issues as a change to the base line\n       price comparison. Therefore, we have not included a price for\n       this work in the attached Final Price spreadsheet. We are,\n       however, prepared to provide OBO with a “hard” number as part\n       of a change to the base line price for this project.\n\nJX 191 at 2. Mr. Sutherland responded by referring to the agreement\nestablished in M002. He wrote the following in a May 6, 2003 e-mail to Mr.\nRand:\n\n       On September 30, 2002 we reached a mutual agreement on\n       $60,730,000 for Phase II design, construction and fabrication.\n       This consisted of a promise by KI to complete all work required\n       for a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) of $50,730,000, plus an\n       allowance of $10,000,000 for transportation. . . . While the\n       Government was willing to take the risk that transportation costs\n       could move up or down as an allowance cost, we fully expected\n       KI to perform the work at or below the guaranteed maximum\n       price as promised in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n\nJX 195 at 3.\n\n       Mike Ross, the OBO Project Executive who worked with Mr.\nSutherland on the Dushanbe project, joined the conversation by e-mailing Mr.\nRand: “When John [Lefkus] submitted his proposal on Sept. 30, he took no\nexceptions to the contract. Now, 7 months into the project, I’m not sure if\nthere is anything he doesn’t take exception to.” JX 195 at 2. Mr. Rand\nresponded to both Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Ross that “I hope that I have been\nclear with regard to the items that are not included in our price i.e. . . . geotech\n\n\n\n\n9\n (...continued)\non April 21, 2003.\n\n                                        17\n\fwork.” JX 195 at 1. On May 7, 2003, Mr. Ross wrote10 to Mr. Rand the\nfollowing:\n\n       You’re not at all clear. You’re [sic] proposal of Sept. 30, 02\n       provided a guaranteed maximum price for the construction of\n       the building and took no exceptions to the contract as you are\n       mentioning below. The only allowance you mentioned in the\n       proposal was for transportation. If the geotech work turns out\n       to be a differing site condition you will pursue it as such. Your\n       delays in completing your foundation analysis are your\n       responsibility.\n\nJX 195 at 1.\n\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Prior, Mr. Sutherland, and Mr. Ross agreed among\nthemselves to reserve $2 million in funding to be used in the event that KI\nproved that it was entitled to an equitable adjustment for differing site\nconditions. Prior to the in-person negotiations that occurred in May 2003, Mr.\nSutherland prepared a “pre-negotiation plan,” which states that “the\nGovernment will take the position that [the geotech] contingency is covered\nby the Differing Site Conditions clause of the contract” when KI requests, as\nanticipated, “$2 million for unknown geotechnical conditions.” JX 1341 at 3.\n\n        Final negotiations concerning Phase II were held on May 8, 2003, in\nArlington, VA. Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Prior, and Mr. Ross represented the\ngovernment and Mr. Lefkus, Mr. Rand, and two others attended on KI’s\nbehalf.\n\n       Following the May 2003 negotiations, Mr. Sutherland recorded that the\nparties agreed to convert the contract from a guaranteed maximum price to a\nfirm fixed price and to raise the contract price by $2 million by changing the\n$10 million transportation allowance into a $12 million fixed price item. JX\n1342 at 3. He also wrote, “The Contractor’s proposed $2 million for unknown\ngeotechnical conditions was considered by the Government to be an\nunjustified contingency and was rejected.” JX 1342 at 3 (Price Negotiation\nMemorandum). That change was later confirmed in M004, discussed below.\n\n\n10\n  Mr. Lefkus, Eduardo Gaarder, Mr. Prior, and Mr. Sutherland were copied\non this e-mail. JX 195 at 1.\n\n                                      18\n\f       The third interim notice to proceed was issued by Mr. Sutherland on\nMay 8, 2003, which authorized KI to “[p]roceed with mobilization and site\npreparation, not to exceed $1,000,000.” JX 198 at 1. Thus, the project moved\nforward as negotiations over price continued in May 2003.11\n\n       In a May 14, 2003 e-mail to employees of Greenway Enterprises, KI’s\nmain subcontractor on the Dushanbe project, Mr. Kosinski explained KI’s\nunderstanding of how the parties would address the geotechnical work in light\nof the negotiations in the following way:\n\n       We have agreed to approach the geotech remediation work as a\n       “separate issue” in terms of both cost and schedule. This will be\n       addressed later on with a change order. What this means to you\n       is that for the time being, you need to submit your schedule\n       based on the assumption that we do not have to do any of the\n       geotech prep work. . . . Based on this we will back out the\n       $874,958.00 from your contract amount for the geotech, and the\n       revised baseline schedule will show a contract completion of\n       June 24, 2004. Once the actual cost and schedule impacts are\n       confirmed, we will submit a change order to OBO for the\n       additional cost and time.\n\nJX 200 at 1.\n\n         Mr. Sutherland also understood that the geotechnical work would be the\nsubject of a possible change order, although he probably had a different\nunderstanding than KI representatives as to what that meant. As he testified\nat trial:\n\n               The government’s position was always, unless you show\n       us that there’s some sort of differing site conditions, we’re not\n       going to allow that. So we stuck with that position, and, as far\n       as the government was concerned, they were never able to prove\n       that, though – we never added it during negotiations, even\n       though Kullman would have liked to have seen an extra $2\n\n\n11\n  Chris Matise, KI’s Project Manager, arrived on site in Dushanbe on May 12,\n2003. KI submitted its detailed project schedule on May 15, 2003, which was\nlater approved by the government on May 30, 2003.\n\n                                      19\n\f       million for that contingency. That’s exactly what it was. It was\n       contingency in our eyes.\n\n              We felt, well, we should prepare for the contingency, but\n       since they haven’t yet demonstrated to us that it is a differing\n       site condition, we’re not going to put it in the contract.\n\nTr. 2216-17 (Sutherland).\n\n       The final adjustment to price was captured in M004.12 M004 made\nseveral changes to the contract. As discussed above, the original guaranteed\nmaximum price of $60,730,000 was changed to a firm fixed price of\n$62,700,000.00, which resulted in an overall increase in the total contract price\nof $1,970,000. Also, the contract completion date was extended to June 20,\n2004. Finally, the potential daily liquidated damages was decreased from\n$8,500 to $3,380.\n\n       M004 also incorporated other documents into the contract. First, it\nreferenced a May 1, 2003 classified document on the “Dushanbe Chancery\nCeiling Heights” given to KI by Mike Ross. Second, the May 29, 2003 letter\nfrom KI was also incorporated into M004. In this letter, John Lefkus\nmemorialized the following understanding:\n\n       Final [notice to proceed] to be issued by June 1st or before. This\n       references DS Certification. Contract will be adjusted if the\n       [notice to proceed] is not issued by then. Contract is extended\n       65 days for a June 20, 2004 completion. This extension takes\n       in[to] account the weeks to the [notice to proceed] and previous\n       suspension and delays.\n\nJX 5 at 5. The letter continues, “The government acknowledges that with the\nexception of a single DS condition, no other outstanding issues remain for DS\nCertification.” JX 5 at 5. KI’s letter does not mention the geotechnical issue.\n\n       Although M004 was not signed by Mr. Sutherland until August 7, 2003,\n\n\n12\n  M003, which is dated December 12, 2002, clarified that certain work had to\nbe performed by workers that had obtained security clearance at the secret\nlevel. JX 4 at 1.\n\n                                       20\n\fand Mr. Lefkus on September 16, 2003, it was given an effective date of May\n29, 2003. May 29 was also the date that KI was issued the unlimited notice to\nproceed. Plaintiff makes much of the fact that KI waited to execute M004\nuntil it submitted the differing site condition request for equitable adjustment,\nbut we attach no contractual significance to that fact.\n\n       B.     Geotechnical Work\n\n              1.      Breaking Ground: The Geotechnical Work Begins\n\n       On June 1, 2003, Catherine Wilkins arrived on site to serve as the OBO\nProject Director. There was a ground-breaking ceremony held at the site on\nJune 10, 2003. General Williams, Suzanne Conrad, Antonio Delgado, Thomas\nQuinzio, Mike Ross, Kevin Sarring, Barbara Richter, Jay Neustel, and Bob\nCult from OBO and Mr. Lefkus, Mr. Rand, and Mr. Kosinski from KI were in\nDushanbe for the ground-breaking ceremony and the pre-construction\nconference.\n\n        Even after the work began on site, the parties continued to quibble over\nhow the geotechnical work would be financed. As the newcomer, Ms. Wilkins\nwas told by KI that the geotech “work is specifically not included in [KI’s]\ncontract at this time and that they are preparing a price proposal to be\nnegotiated.” JX 219 at 1. In light of KI’s assertion, Ms. Wilkins e-mailed Mr.\nSutherland and Mr. Ross on June 18, 2003, to reaffirm that the government’s\nposition was that “the government expects the contractor to proceed with the\nconstruction, and, if they feel that the geotech work is not in their contract, to\nfile a request for equitable adjustment.” JX 219 at 1. Mr. Ross responded on\nJune 25 with the following:\n\n              The government does not accept any claim from the\n       contractor that the foundation is not in their contract. They have\n       never given us anything in writing to that effect nor have they\n       mentioned an exclusion. They have a design-build contract that\n       includes putting the building on a competent foundation.\n\n              ....\n\n              Further, it has been explained to them that any request for\n       equitable adjustment must be presented to the contracting officer\n       with a comprehensive schedule and cost analysis attached.\n\n                                       21\n\f       Otherwise we have nothing to talk about.\n\nJX 224 at 2. After receiving this message, Ms. Wilkins wrote back to Mr.\nRoss informing him that the contractor was threatening to suspend work until\nthere was a signed contract modification addressing this issue. Mr. Ross then\ne-mailed Mr. Alan with the following note:\n\n       What Catherine is telling me is NOT what we agreed. You told\n       me at site last week that you would proceed with the foundation\n       work and once you determined what, if anything, was a differing\n       site condition, you would apply for a request for equitable\n       adjustment.\n\n       As of now, the Government does NOT agree that this work is\n       not in your contract and if you delay the project and fail to prove\n       otherwise, you’re going to be on the hook for making up the lost\n       time.\n\n       I would suggest that you get rolling with the foundation work\n       and start putting together your RFEA if you believe you are\n       entitled to one.\n\nJX 224 at 1. Mr Sutherland echoed these sentiments two days later when he\ne-mailed Mr. Rand and instructed KI to “Get Going!” with the site work. JX\n225 at 1. In this e-mail, Mr. Sutherland reminded Mr. Rand of KI’s obligation\nto prosecute the work diligently. Mr. Sutherland wrote, “I have yet to see any\nevidence that there are in fact any differing site conditions relating to soils or\nany other geotech concerns. So far it’s been speculation. The contract does\nnot provide for any delay of work based on unsupported speculation.” JX 225\nat 1.\n\n       Despite the foregoing, Ms. Wilkins’ Project Director Summary for July\n2003 characterized contractor relations and customer satisfaction as “good.”\nJX 60 at 1.13 The project status was characterized as “green,” or positive, even\nthough “[c]onstruction activity in the field has been slow to get started.” JX\n\n\n13\n  In this document, Ms. Wilkins also reported that the contract completion\ndate was June 20, 2004, although the “[s]tatus of mod #4 not confirmed.” JX\n60 at 2.\n\n                                       22\n\f60 at 1. Ms. Wilkins recorded that excavation, grubbing, grading, and soil\nwetting had begun. JX 60 at 2. Joseph Allen, KI’s Site Superintendent who\nworked on the geotechnical and soil remediation efforts, recalled the\nfollowing:\n\n       [T]o remedy those [poor and collapsible] soil conditions, there\n       were some processes we had to do after we excavated to get the\n       soil prepared for the load that was going to be put on it . . . .\n\n              So it was a process of excavating, flooding the area,\n       having it hold standing water. And – and that was for, if I\n       remember correctly, I think it was for 28 days was what the\n       requirement was. And then you remove that, you excavate a\n       portion of it, compact it, test the soil.\n\nTr. 824-25. KI sent the test samples to LBG for analysis. KI repeated this\nprocess for several months with little resulting soil settlement. LBG released\na report, JX 420, in March of 2004 that concluded the soils had settled only\n2 centimeters as a result of the compaction efforts.\n\n              2.     KI Submits a Request for Equitable Adjustment and\n                     Then Signs M004\n\n       Before the results of the settlement efforts were known however, on\nJune 9, 2003, Mr. Ross sent KI the cost estimate forms to complete and submit\nalong with the request for equitable adjustment (“REA”) concerning the site\nconditions. KI submitted its differing site condition REA to Mr. Sutherland\non August 15, 2003. The REA asserted that the geological conditions were\n“extreme and differ[ent] from standards applied at the time of the initial\ncontract award/[notice to proceed] and during negotiations.” JX 22 at 3. In\nthe REA, KI requested a monetary adjustment of $3,032,915 and a time\nextension that would move substantial completion to November 15, 2004. The\ntime extension was requested because KI estimated that “an eight-week time\nperiod” was necessary for soil subsidence. JX 22 at 6. In its submission, KI\nasserted that the equitable adjustment was warranted because “during final\ncontract negotiations, all costs and schedule impact that relate to the\ngeotechnical work were specifically excluded from the negotiated price\npending issuance of the final geotechnical report, completion of the\nstructural/geotechnical design effort, and cost and schedule analysis.” JX 22\nat 3.\n\n                                      23\n\f        Mr. Lefkus signed M004 on September 16, 2003. At the time that KI\nsubmitted its REA and executed M004, the remedial geotechnical work was\nnot included in the Schedule of Values. JX 214, JX 230, JX 237, JX 250; see\nTr. 2442 (Lefkus) (“[W]e had not yet acknowledged the contractor’s obligation\nto do those [geotech] activities because they did not appear on the schedule.”).\n\n              3.     The Site Work Continues\n\n       As August 2003 came to a close, Ms. Wilkins described the project\nstatus as “yellow,” and the contractor performance as “significantly behind\nschedule.” JX 61 at 1. Ms. Wilkins recorded that “[e]xcavation was\ncompleted during the month of August at the building footprints” but “[s]oil\nwetting operations continued at the perimeter wall foundations.” JX 61 at 1.\n\n                     a.      Delay\n\n        In September 2003, Ms. Wilkins’ characterization of the project status\nchanged to red, which she testified meant that there was a serious problem\nbecause the contractor was behind schedule. KI was so far behind schedule\nat this point that Ms. Wilkins wrote, that KI was “unlikely to complete within\nthe contract performance period.” JX 62 at 1. She estimated that the job was\n20.35% complete. JX 62 at 2. Ms. Wilkins recorded that “[a]ctivity at the site\ncontinues to focus on the geotechnical work required to prepare the soil prior\nto construction of the foundations.” JX 62 at 1.\n\n                     b.      Geotech is Added to the Schedule of Values\n\n       In order to receive periodic compensation for work performed, KI\nsubmitted invoices to the agency. It billed for the percentage of work\ncompleted for each line item on a Schedule of Values (“SOV”). The SOV\nsubmitted by KI with the August 2003 invoice showed a line item of $12\nmillion for transportation and did not include a line item for geotechnical\nwork. JX 250. The September 2003 invoice is the first one submitted by KI\nthat included a line item for geotechnical work, valued at $3,032,915. This\nentry corresponded with a reduction in the transportation line item in the\nSeptember 2003 schedule of values, which became six new line items titled\n“Transport Modules from Port to Site” with a total value of approximately $8.8\nmillion. JX 270 at 15.\n\n       Although KI had initially excluded line items for geotechnical work in\n\n                                      24\n\fthe SOV,14 inclusion of these line items became the topic of discussion at the\nend of September 2003. Mr. Ross wrote the following to Mr. Rand on October\n1, 2003: “Per our meeting with Anne last week, you were going to adjust your\nschedule to reflect the geotech work. Those activities and there [sic] values\nshould then be exported to your schedule of values.” JX 119 at 897.\n\n\n14\n  The SOV originates with the contractor and is then reviewed and approved\nby the government. Tr. 209 (Farley). The contract states:\n\n       Before the first progress payment under this contract becomes\n       due, the contractor shall prepare a Detailed Estimate for\n       Progress Payments itemizing the Contract Price in the form and\n       in such detail as is required by the Contract Documents. The\n       values in the Detailed Estimate will be used as a basis for\n       determining progress payments, but will not be conclusive as to\n       the amounts due the Contractor or as to the value of changes in\n       the work. The Contractor’s overhead and profit shall be\n       prorated throughout the life of the contract.\n\nJX 1 at 60. The contract documents further prescribe:\n\n       1. The Contractor shall submit applications for progress\n       payment monthly.\n       2. Monthly Progress Payment applications shall be:\n             a) Substantiated by progress report submittals, as\n             specified.\n             b) Consistent with previous applications.\n             c) Accurately coordinated with the Schedule of\n             Values produced by the progress cost loaded\n             schedule process defined in Section 01314,\n             Project Schedules.\n             d) As directed by the Project Director,\n             coordinated with required meetings, inspections,\n             certifications, and similar actions.\n             e) Submitted subsequent to completion of\n             specified prerequisite work elements for which\n             partial payment has been requested.\n\nJX 57 at 14-15.\n\n                                     25\n\f       KI did include a new group of line items under the heading of\n“GeoTech” that totaled $3,032,915 in its September invoice. JX 270 at 12-13.\nThe bottom line contract value did not change in order to accommodate these\nnew line items. Rather, the transportation budget of $12 million was broken\ndown into smaller line items that then totaled to just short of $9 million. In\nother words, money was moved from transportation to geotechnical work,\nalthough the overall contract amount remained the same. Mr. Rand testified\nthat he discussed this change with Mr. Ross and Ms. Wilkins and obtained\ngovernment approval to move funds from the transportation line item to the\nnewly created line item for geotechnical work.\n\n       Around the same time that the geotechnical work was included within\nthe SOV, representatives from the government met with members of KI to\ndiscuss the geotechnical issues raised in the REA. JX 24 at 1 (stating the\nmeeting occurred on October 16, 2003). At this meeting, “KI/LBG\nrepresentatives confirmed that soil samples brought back to the United States\nand tested were consistent with the [SANIIOSP] report.” JX 24 at 4.\n\n        At the end of October 2003, Ms. Wilkins recorded in her Project\nDirector’s Summary that progress had been made on the geotechnical work,\nbut the soil wetting and monitoring phase was not complete. JX 63 at 1. KI\nalso prepared a monthly progress report for October which stated that the\ncontractor “continue[s] to anticipate approximately two months of field\nactivities that relate almost exclusively to the geotech effort.” JX 94 at 1. KI’s\nprediction proved true as Ms. Wilkins reported in both her November and\nDecember Project Director’s summaries that the contractor continued to flood\nand monitor the soils. JX 64 at 1, JX 65 at 1. As indicated above, after\nmonths of soil wetting, excavation, fill and drying, there was virtually no\nsettlement.\n\n                      c.     The Government Denies the REA\n\n     On November 12, 2003, Mr. Sutherland sent a letter to KI denying the\nREA. JX 24 at 1. The letter provided the following:\n\n       Section C of the contract requires the Contractor to perform\n       geotechnical services in Dushanbe. Since execution of the\n       contract, the Government has not made any changes to the\n       contract requirements regarding performance of geotechnical\n       activities. The contract does not contain any exceptions or\n\n                                       26\n\f       special provisions providing for additional consideration to\n       perform required geotechnical services. As a result of reviews,\n       evaluations, and discussions, the Government has determined\n       that the REA does not support any adjustment to the contract\n       price or performance schedule. Therefore, the REA is denied in\n       its entirety.\n\nJX 24 at 1. Additionally, Mr. Sutherland noted that KI received “Section C”\nof the contract on July 2, 2002, which included clauses C.2.8 and C.4.2.5 that\nincluded geotechnical activities within the scope of work, and that the July 12,\n2002 solicitation included attachment J.3.7, which should have put KI on\nnotice of the potential geological issues at the site. Mr. Sutherland also wrote,\n\n       The RFP and the contract contain FAR clauses 52.236-3, Site\n       Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work (APR 1984).\n       The clause states that the Contractor has investigated and\n       satisfied itself of conditions that can affect the work or its cost,\n       including ‘the confirmation and conditions of the ground.’ The\n       clause goes on, ‘. . . . The Contractor also acknowledges that it\n       has satisfied itself as to the character, quality, and quantity of\n       surface and subsurface materials or obstacles to be encountered\n       insofar as this information is reasonably ascertainable from an\n       inspection of the site, including all exploratory work done by the\n       Government . . . failure of the Contractor to take the actions\n       described and acknowledged in this paragraph will not relieve\n       the Contractor from responsibility for estimating properly the\n       difficulty and cost of performing the work without additional\n       expense to the Government . . . The Government assumes no\n       responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the\n       Contractor based on information made available by the\n       Government.’\n\nJX 24 at 3.\n\n        Mr. Sutherland noted that “KI’s decision to hold off sending a\ngeotechnical engineer to Dushanbe until January 2003 showed negligence and\nlikely contributed to delays.” JX 24 at 4. Regarding the September 30, 2002\nGMP, Mr. Sutherland wrote, “Although the final offer did include some\nmutually agreed upon conditions, it did not include any conditions regarding\ngeotechnical issues.” JX 24 at 4 (underline in original). Mr. Sutherland\n\n                                       27\n\fconcluded, “Based on field reports and observations, it is believed that\nKullman Industries failed to prosecute the geotechnical work diligently, as\nrequired by [the] contract.” JX 24 at 8. DOS architect Vassilios Magginas\nwrote in the analysis attached to Mr. Sutherland’s letter, “I do not see any\nreason why OBO has to pay for something extra for a design decision made by\n[KI] and, overall, is a requirement of the project.” JX 24 at 13.\n\n              4.     Retainage and Liquidated Damages\n\n       The government began retaining a portion of KI’s progress payments\nin April of 2003 pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 52.232-5(e)\n(2003), which provides,\n\n       (e) Retainage. If the Contracting Officer finds that satisfactory\n       progress was achieved during any period for which a progress\n       payment is to be made, the Contracting Officer shall authorize\n       payment to be made in full. However, if satisfactory progress\n       has not been made, the Contracting Officer may retain a\n       maximum of 10 percent of the amount of the payment until\n       satisfactory progress is achieved. When the work is substantially\n       complete, the Contracting Officer may retain from previously\n       withheld funds and future progress payments that amount the\n       Contracting Officer considers adequate for protection of the\n       Government and shall release to the Contractor all the remaining\n       withheld funds. Also, on completion and acceptance of each\n       separate building, public work, or other division of the contract,\n       for which the price is stated separately in the contract, payment\n       shall be made for the completed work without retention of a\n       percentage.\n\nThe government’s rationale for the initial withholding was unsatisfactory\nprogress with the design. Then, as geotechnical work threatened satisfactory\nprogress on the rest of the project, the government once again justified\nretaining a small percent of KI’s progress payments.\n\n      Mr. Rand wrote to Mr. Sutherland on December 5, 2003, describing the\nimpact of the government’s decision to retain part of KI’s progress payments:\n\n       [T]he recent lack of payment and withholding by the\n       government has created an intolerable condition . . . .\n\n                                      28\n\f      Withholdings for non-payment of applications not in terms\n      (September and earlier) is over 30% of the [sic] Kullman’s\n      undisputed earnings. I believe that the lack of payment for\n      approved undisputed work technically constitutes a breach by\n      the government. . . .\n\n      This lack of cash flow has a direct negative impact on the\n      project team and the project’s success. . . . Professional\n      consultants along with foreign and domestic subcontractors\n      struggle with large outstanding balances for work that has been\n      performed and approved.\n\n      ....\n\n      During the meeting, Mike Ross made me aware of OBO’s\n      rationale for withholding 10% of each of Kullman’s invoices.\n      His rationale is schedule related and is directly attributed to the\n      geotech work now taking place. If we were able to show a\n      geotech recovery plan related to schedule, all sums currently\n      retained would be returned to Kullman.\n\nJX 303 at 1. Throughout the contract, the government continued to\nperiodically exercise its right to withhold up to 10% of the value of KI’s\ninvoices and at no time did the government exceed its authority to collect\nretainage pursuant to the FAR. The total retention withheld by the government\nat the end of the contract was $2,187,022.\n\n       On June 18, 2004, Lisa Goodwine, the contracting officer at the time,\nsent Mr. Rand formal notice that the government intended to assess liquidated\ndamages in the amount of $3,380 per day beginning on June 21, 2004, because\nthe contract completion date was June 20, 2004.15 JX 539; see Tr. 447-48\n(Lowther). However, we find no reference to a formal assessment of\nliquidated damages, and the government has not made liquidated damages part\n\n\n15\n  The letter was actually signed by James G. Thomas, Jr., as the CO, and was\nsent by Lisa Goodwine. However, the parties stipulated that Lisa Goodwine\nwas the CO for the Dushanbe project from June 17, 2004, until July 15, 2004.\nMs. Lowther explained that Mr. Thomas was the Senior Contracting Officer\nin the division.\n\n                                      29\n\fof its counter-claim here.\n\n       C.     Security Breach & Mold Remediation\n\n        Once the foundations were in place, the construction of the Embassy\nprogressed until a problem was encountered with the CAA within the NOB.\nUnlike the other modules within the NOB, the original intent of the parties was\nthat the modules comprising the CAA would be built in segregated facilities\nin New Jersey by screened employees under DOS observation.16 What the\nparties had to accommodate, however, is that because the CAA is room within\na room (the space between the interior room and the full expanse of the CAA\naccommodates periodic inspections to verify the security of the structure), the\nCAA module needed to have a ceiling height of twelve feet. The maximum\nheight of a module that could be shipped, however, was ten feet. As one might\nexpect, some of the details about this area within the Embassy are classified.\nNot only is information regarding the CAA restricted, but strict security\nmeasures were followed throughout the project in order to preserve the\nintegrity of this space.\n\n        The security problem created by the adaptation of the Standard Embassy\nDesign (“SED”) to modular construction was anticipated during Phase I. See\nJX 174 (March 20, 2003 e-mail discussing CAA ceiling height design issues).\nMr. Lefkus, Mr. Rand, Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Ross, Eduardo Gaarder, Patricia\nRegalo-Warren, Branch Chief within OBO, and others representing either KI\nor the government met on April 1, 2003, to address the security concerns\nidentified during the design phase. Mr. Sutherland wrote a memorandum after\nthe meeting which recorded the following:\n\n       The contract is based on Standard Embassy Design (SED)\n       documents and attachments thereto. Design submittals [sic] to\n       date show the ceiling at less than the 12-foot height. The\n       Government maintains that the contract documents require a 12-\n       foot ceiling. Kullman points out that Section C of the contract\n       states “. . . (SED) shall be modified as necessary to execute\n       using off-site modular technology. . .” Kullman explained that\n\n\n16\n  The parties called the screened workers “Cleared American Workers” or\n“CAW” and the DOS employees who were tasked with observing were\nreffered to as “Construction Surveillance Technicians” or “CST.”\n\n                                      30\n\f       it would not be practical to have the 12 foot ceiling for modular\n       construction because of transportation limitations, involving\n       oceanic shipping, rail cars in Europe, high-risk areas, low\n       tunnels, and other reasons. Alternative possibilities were\n       discussed.\n\n       . . . . Pending resolution of the ceiling issue, the Contracting\n       Officer has suspended all work under the contract.\n\nJX 179 at 1. Three days after this meeting, on April 4, 2003, DOS approved\nKI’s revised Construction and Transit Security Plan. This plan was originally\ndrafted on October 30, 2002, and revised on March 6, 2003. It included the\nfollowing language:\n\n       The goal of this plan is to facilitate the project schedule by\n       limiting the program to actual CAA area(s) and implementing\n       security measures to maintain an acceptable level of protection\n       . . . . [I]t is the contractor’s understanding that the CAA area(s)\n       impact the second and third floor modules on one specific\n       portion of the NOB.\n\nJX 153 at 4. The plan went on to state that\n\n       The unique nature of modular construction lends itself to the\n       security aspects of this project. We can readily identify and\n       segregate the modules requiring special protection. Unlike\n       conventional construction, where contiguous areas are\n       connected throughout the construction process, modular\n       construction allows for the separation of modules containing\n       sensitive areas to be assembled under segregated, controlled\n       conditions. With modular construction, floor and ceiling\n       structures are not shared elements; therefore the need to control\n       vertically adjacent areas is eliminated.\n\nJX 153 at 4-5. When the government approved the Construction and Transit\nSecurity Plan, it also noted that KI had not yet submitted a Transit Security\nPlan, which presumably would describe in detail the plan to transport modules\nand materials from New Jersey where they were assembled to Dushanbe.\n\n       At trial, several witnesses testified that KI did indeed create such a plan\n\n                                       31\n\fand that the government approved it. See, e.g. Tr. 2781-83 (Algire). The\nshipping plan, however, was classified and Mr. Kullman testified that KI was\nrequired to return to the government all classified documents once it was\nterminated. Tr. 1766-67. While witnesses confirmed that the plan listed which\nmodules and materials were to be shipped securely, see Tr. 5031 (Charles\nKuehne, Senior Desk Officer for Central Asia and team leader for security\nprocedures at DOS), the details of the list are unknown to the court because\nneither party produced it. Additionally, during trial, the court asked the\ngovernment to produce the classified blue prints, shipping lists, and any other\nexhibits that might aid our resolution of this issue and the government was\nunable or unwilling to do so. This gap becomes important, as discussed below,\nbecause a dispute arose as to whether the materials for the mechanical suite on\nthe fourth floor of the NOB above the CAA had to be shipped securely.\nBecause the government was in the best position to produce the secure\nshipping list and failed to do so, we draw the inference that the fourth-floor\nfloor panels were not on the list. See Huthnance v. Dist. of Columbia, 722\nF.3d 371, 378 (D.D.C. 2013).\n\n       The ceiling height of the CAA was a topic of conversation during the\nnegotiations leading to M004. M004 incorporated a May 1, 2003 classified\ndocument on the “Dushanbe Chancery Ceiling Heights” given to KI by Mike\nRoss. The May 29, 2003 letter from KI, which was also incorporated into\nM004 provides the following:\n\n       Final [notice to proceed] to be issued by June 1st or before. This\n       references DS Certification. Contract will be adjusted if the\n       [notice to proceed] is not issued by then. Contract is extended\n       65 days for a June 20, 2004 completion. This extension takes\n       into account the weeks to the [notice to proceed] and previous\n       suspension and delays.\n\nJX 5 at 5. Finally, this letter acknowledges that, as of May 29, 2003, “DS”\ncertification was still an outstanding issue.\n\n      Mr. Rand and Mr. Lefkus once again met with Mr. Ross and others\nfrom diplomatic security on November 6, 2003, to address this issue. Mr.\nLekus recalled that\n\n       we couldn’t achieve [the necessary ceiling height] within a\n       single module, but our solution was to show them, represent\n\n                                      32\n\f       that, while the third floor module itself could not achieve that\n       space, that most of that space could be achieved with its\n       relationship with the fourth floor floor panels, which was for the\n       mechanical suite.\n\nTr. 2391. KI brought a proposed solution to this meeting in the form of a\nthree-dimensional model.17 Although the model was not produced at trial, Mr.\nLefkus described it as a shoe box with lid; “the third floor module looked like\nthe bottom of a shoe box and the fourth floor panel looked like the top of a\nshoe box.” Tr. 2393. The way in which KI proposed to solve the height issue\nwas by welding extenders on the floor of the fourth floor and then welding that\npanel on the ten foot high third floor module. This added approximately two\nfeet to the standard module. Mr. Lefkus testified that the three-dimensional\nmodel remained in the custody of the government after the meeting. Tr. 2394.\nIt was not introduced at trial.\n\n      When asked whether there was any discussion at the November 6\nmeeting about how the “lid” would be manufactured and shipped, Mr. Lefkus\nresponded,\n\n       A.     Yeah. We understood at that meeting that the third floor,\n              which was cleared space, was built securely, and the\n              fourth floor elements, which was mechanical space, was\n              not built securely.\n       Q.     Did the government understand that?\n       A.     The focus on the meeting was the clearance. I know we\n              discussed, you know, the fabrication of each spaces, so\n              I would say they did, but that was further discussed with\n              their transit security team. Every piece of the building\n              was approved for transportation. It was either sent\n              secure transportation or unsecure. So every element in\n              the building was designated for secure. If the product\n              was not built secure, you’d never send it secure\n              transportation. Conversely, if you built something in a\n              secure environment, you wouldn’t send it unsecured. So,\n\n\n17\n  Mr. Lefkus also testified that KI representatives provided “a series of plans”\nand the model to illustrate the relationship between the third and fourth floor\nin physical form. Tr. 2393.\n\n                                      33\n\f             they’re always related to each other.\n       The Court: When you say designated, by whom?\n       The Witness: It’s a process with the government to determine\n             what spaces they deem to be secure in nature. Some are\n             easy calls.\n       The Court: Spaces or mods? Spaces or elements of the\n             construction –\n       The Witness: Both, sir. It could be a module or it could be a\n             container with a product in it. So, anything that got\n             transported to the site – anything – whether it went in a\n             container, freight bulk, as a module, there was a\n             designated way that it was going to be transported.\n       The Court: Where did that designation originate?\n       The Witness: It designated through the government’s transit\n             security team and their site security by reviewing the\n             plans and determining an approach to transport the\n             project from our facility to its destination in Dushanbe.\n\nTr. 2397-98.\n\n       On December 10, 2003, Mr. Kosinski e-mailed Mr. Ross and other\ngovernment representatives with several attachments regarding general\nshipping plans. In a December 9, 2003 letter, which was the first attachment\nto Mr. Kosinski’s e-mail, he wrote that the attached “shipping plans have now\nbeen revised to include the specific details requested and direction provided\nby the USG [United States Government] during recent meetings and\ndiscussions on this topic.” JX 306 at 2. After briefly describing the shipping\nplans for the modules and some of the measures to be employed to ensure the\nsecurity of those designated secure modules, Mr. Kosinksi wrote that “[a]s\ndiscussed during our meeting on November 6th, the panelized sections for the\nNOB mechanical penthouse spaces and atrium areas do not need to travel with\nthe modules shipments and may follow alternate routing if desired.” JX 306\nat 3. The rest of the attachments described the plans to transport three\ndifferent groups of modules from New Jersey to Dushanbe.\n\n       Once DS certification was resolved, KI moved forward with\nconstruction of modules and panels in its warehouse in New Jersey. When\nmodules had to be manufactured securely, they were constructed by cleared\nAmerican workers under guard in a secure area of KI’s manufacturing plant.\nThere is no disagreement over the fact that the fourth-floor floor panels were\nnot constructed securely.\n\n\n                                     34\n\f        The next time that the subject of the panels was discussed was on July\n12, 2004, when Wayne Algire, the Site Security Manager, became concerned\nthat the fourth floor panels were not included in the secure shipments. He e-\nmailed Charles “Chick” Little, Mr. Algire’s Desk Officer and point of contact\nwithin the Washington, DC office of OBO, and Charles Kuehne, Senior Desk\nOfficer for Central Asia and team leader for security procedures at DOS, JX\n541 at 12, asking, “As there are no more secure shipments, that I am aware of,\nhow is this stuff getting here[?] . . . Is the fourth floor south wing not CAA,\njust contiguous with the CAA?” JX 541 at 13. Mr. Little responded that,\nalthough he had to reference the drawings18 before he gave a final answer, he\ncould advise that, “IF it is for the CAA, it needs to be securely purchased and\nshipped, unless it can be randomly selected at 25% or less out of the whole of\nthe exact same item. If it is for non-CAA, no restrictions.” JX 541 at 12.\n\n       Then, Ms. Wilkins added the following to the e-mail chain:\n\n       The Fourth Floor immediately above the CAA on the south wing\n       of the building has full height parapet walls. The enclosed area\n       is partially open to the sky. Those walls were not shipped\n       secure. They cannot be randomly selected from other stock as\n       they are custom. They have already shipped (non-secure) and\n       will be here within a few days. Please advise whether we should\n       allow them to be installed.\n\nJX 541 at 11. Mr. Algire agreed with Ms. Wilkins’ assessment and wrote to\nMr. Little and Ms. Wilkins, “The steel as I read the drawings is for the CAA\non the fourth floor above the CAA on the second and third floor of the CAA\nsouth wing.” JX 541 at 8.\n\n       On July 20, 2004, Mr. Little provided his answer as follows:\n\n             I have looked at the drawings for this. I have also talked\n       with Sharmeena [Salam-Haughton]. . . .\n\n              ....\n\n              This fourth floor for the South side is a “penthouse” a\n\n\n18\n  These design drawings of the CAA were also classified and not produced for\nour inspection at trial.\n\n                                      35\n\f       “mechanical penthouse”. Yes, it is covered. Why? We do this\n       sometimes. All the equipment that goes into this area is\n       procured and shipped non-secure.\n\n               This area is completely a non-CAA area. For\n       construction, this means locals with CSTs [Construction\n       Surveillance Technicians], since it is General Work area. . . .\n       Since the floor is contiguous, the the [sic] installation of the\n       floor slab itself should be by cleared Americans.\n\n               I hope this resolves the issues about the fourth floor.\n       This is rather normal for all NECs [New Embassy Compounds]\n       as far as how the area is constructed. In actuality, for NECs at\n       the same level as yours, general construction, which includes the\n       floor and ceiling slabs, can be done by locals under CST\n       surveillance, so in essence requiring Cleared Americans for\n       doing the slab is a step above what occurs on normal stick build\n       projects.\n\nJX 541 at 2.\n\n       The fourth-floor floor steel panels arrived in Dushanbe sometime\nbetween July 22 and August 20, 2004, after being constructed and shipped\nnon-securely. Once the panels arrived, KI began installing them. KI was able\nto begin installing the panels in August of 2004 because, at this time, all of the\nmodules for the South side of the NOB, the side that housed the CAA, were\nin place. JX 71 at 1 (OBO Project Director’s June 2004 Report); JX 48 at 129\n(Expert Demonstrative showing the sequence in which each module and panel\nwas set in place); Tr. 934 (Allen). Mr. Allen testified that “[t]he area had –\naround the building had been completely backfilled because we had set all the\nmodules. We wouldn’t have been able to set all the modules if we weren’t\ncompletely backfilled.” Tr. 935. We find Mr. Allen to be a credible witness.\nKI had installed 6 fourth-floor floor panels when it was ordered to stop work.\n\n        On August 20, the CO wrote to Mr. Rand to notify him that KI was\nresponsible for rectifying what he viewed as a security breach in accordance\nwith direction from OBO. The issue was framed in the following manner:\n“[T]he third floor modules were fabricated and shipped without the required\nsteel plating. Instead, the third floor ceiling steel plating was fabricated as part\nof the fourth floor modules. The fourth floor (penthouse) modules were\nfabricated and shipped, unsecured, and cannot be used as part of the third\n\n\n                                        36\n\ffloor.” JX 611 at 1. In response, KI asserted that it had followed the OBO\napproved plans for secure manufacturing and shipping. Ms. Salam-Haughton\nfollowed up on August 26, 2004, with potential mitigation strategies suggested\nby OBO.\n\n        Mitigation involved inspection of the panels; OBO sent a security team\nto conduct the inspection on site from September 17 - 28, 2004. There were\n36 panels in total, some of which were stored in the secure storage area and six\nof which were already installed in the main embassy building. In order to\ndetermine whether the panels19 had been compromised, the OBO security\nteam, with the help of KI cleared personnel, moved the panels to the inspection\narea,20 cut holes as large as 6 inches by 6 inches in the sides, top, and bottom\nof each panel so that the team could explore the interior of the panel, and then\nverified that there were no listening devices or other abnormalities. This\ninspection process “required the contractor to provide additional manpower for\ncutting holes, a heavy lift crane with operator, [and] workers to maneuver the\npanels into place.” JX 677 at 12. The OBO security team found no major\nissues or anomalies, although the team noted that there was “water in the\nmajority of roof panels.” JX 677 at 1. KI was not permitted to install the\npanels until the entire inspection was complete. Once the inspection was\ncomplete, KI was left with the work of repairing the panels. In addition, OBO\nlater insisted on the installation of additional acoustic material to protect\nagainst the possibility that the inspection had missed a listening device.\n\n       Lorri Lowther, who was returned to her former position as CO at the\nend of October 2004, gave KI written notice on November 23, 2004, to\n“immediately proceed with Phase II mitigation above the three specific areas\non the third floor.” JX 807 at 120. The parties, however, continued to seek a\nstrategy for full mitigation. On December 6, 2004, Ms. Lowther wrote the\nfollowing to Mr. Rand:\n\n       OBO agreed to four different [mitigation] options that would be\n       acceptable for Kullman to execute with the understanding that\n\n\n19\n   The panels were “3 meters x 9 meters and constructed of 6” steel tube\nframing, steel I-beam cross members dividing each panel into 9 sections, with\n6mm steel on one side and 8mm steel on the other to enclose the panels.” JX\n677 at 11.\n20\n  KI did not remove the six panels that had already been installed. They were\ninspected in place.\n\n                                      37\n\f       Kullman would propose their preferred option within the\n       following days. In discussions on December 3, 2004 with\n       Sharmeena Salam-Haughton and Eric Rumpf, we understand\n       that Kullman intends to pursue the systematic solution for Part\n       II consisting of ceiling tile, the enhanced gypboard [quiet rock]\n       and an expandable material in the voids.\n\n       This is to again advise that OBO accepts Kullman’s choice and\n       Kullman is authorized to proceed immediately with execution.\n\n       ....\n\n       This guidance is provided to Kullman Industries to mitigate\n       Kullman’s improper shipment of third floor ceiling panels. The\n       Government will not consider an equitable adjustment for either\n       time or costs . . . .\n\n       Mitigation, by definition, is not a change to the contract.\n\nJX 807 at 122-23.\n\n       Shortly after the inspections concluded, KI resumed installing the\nfourth-floor floor panels. KI finished installation of the fourth-floor floor\npanels on October 20, 2004. By the end of October, all of the modules and 12\nwall panels had been set. In November, KI installed “all remaining wall and\nfloor panels at [the] NOB.” JX 76 at 1. “[S]etting and welding steel columns\nand roof panels at NOB mechanical levels” continued into December. JX 76\nat 1. By the end of December, the roof was in place, although the roof\nmembrane was not finished, meaning that the roof was not yet fully watertight.\n\n       Joseph Allen, KI’s Site Superintendent since May 2004, testified that\nDushanbe experienced an unprecedented rainy reason, which began on\nNovember 17, 2004, and lasted into February of 2005. Because of the delay\nassociated with the CAA security concerns, KI was not able to complete the\nroof of the NOB by the time the rains began.21 As a result water infiltrated the\n\n\n21\n   Mr. Allen testified that KI was not able to get the roof installed and\nwatertight before the rains came because of the delay with the fourth-floor\nfloor panels. Once the floor panels were welded into place, KI had to install\n“wall panels that had to sit on top of those panels that made up the mechanical\n                                                                   (continued...)\n\n                                       38\n\frest of the building, which had been paneled with gypsum board. Mr. Allen\nrecalled that the building sustained water damage and subsequently mold\ndamage. He testified that KI tried “to keep up with it and replace the areas we\nknew were getting – that got damaged. But it got too extensive. It –\ntemperature was right, weather condition was right and, you know, mold just\ngrew.” Tr. 837.22 The mold issue was not unique to the NOB but also plagued\nthe other buildings being constructed at the embassy compound. See Tr. 923-\n27 (Allen) (stating that there was a minor mold problem in the gate houses and\nthat there was a mold in the Marine Security Guard Quarters).\n\n       The mold problem in the NOB grew so severe that the OBO Project\nDirector ordered KI to stop work until there was an approved mold removal\nstrategy. All of KI resources were diverted to the mold issue, and an industrial\nhygienist was brought in to assess the damage and propose a remediation\nstrategy. Mr. Allen recalled the process for removing the mold beginning with\nclosing a room and then “we’d seal off the room. So we’d seal it off. And the\nreason we did that is the industrial hygienist, when – when you pull the\nsheetrock off you can spread more mold spores.” Tr. 929. The crew bagged\nup the sheetrock that had been ripped off the walls and disposed of it off-site.\nIn order to keep track of the man hours spent on mold remediation, Mr. Allen\ncreated a spreadsheet and directed Dennis Vance, KI’s on-site Safety Manager\n\n\n21\n  (...continued)\nspace on the fourth floor.” Tr. 840. Then, KI “had to bring in all the\nmechanical equipment that went in that section into the building, and set that\nbefore we put the roof on the building.” Tr. 840 (Allen). Mr. Allen recalled\nthat it took two months to get the waterproofing “roof on even with the rain,\nwhich delayed us quite a bit.” Tr. 840. When asked if KI anticipated the\npossibility of rain or attempted to fashion a temporary roof during the rainy\nseason, Mr. Allen explained that the modules had been shipped with temporary\nroofs that had to be removed once the floor panels were installed and that KI\ntried to build a temporary roof on site but, “[i]t was like trying to tent a football\nfield.” Tr. 841-42.\n22\n  Mr. Allen contrasted the mold issue spawned by the winter rains to the\nminor amounts of mold that had been encountered in late spring 2004, which\ndeveloped during shipping. There had been a few modules that developed a\nsmall amount of mold because they had gotten wet during ocean transit. Mr.\nAllen’s team eliminated the mold in these modules by cutting out the sheet\nrock, removing the wet insulation, cleaning up the area, and replacing the\nmoldy materials with clean new materials.\n\n                                         39\n\fwho worked with the industrial hygienist, to input the hours for labor. Mold\nremediation continued throughout the spring of 2005.\n\n       On February 9, 2005, KI submitted a formal request for an equitable\nadjustment23 to cover the delay and cost of the security mitigation measures to\nWalter Cate and Robert Powell, the Division Directors in DOS’ Office of\nAcquisition Management. JX 807. In its request, KI asserted that it\n“emphatically believes that it operated within the OBO approved construction\nsecurity and transit security plans for the factory fabrication and shipment of\nthe general construction items in question.” JX 807 at 4. KI wrote the\nfollowing:\n\n       Kullman communicated its intentions regarding the secure and\n       non-secure shipment of these items with the Government\n       through multiple document revisions, product models, and in\n       meetings during the construction and transit process. At no time\n       were the steel panels identified by OBO as requiring secure\n       shipment. Additionally, each of the secure shipping plans is\n       clear as to the tentative shipping schedule, route description, and\n       a list of the items being securely shipped.\n\n       Until August 20, 2004, and despite our thorough documentation\n       of the fabrication and shipment of the modules and panelized\n       sections for the NOB, at no time was Kullman ever notified that\n       the factory fabrication or shipment plans were incorrectly\n       implemented.\n\nJX 807 at 4. Ms. Lowther eventually denied the REA on June 15, 2005, two\ndays before KI would later be terminated for default. In her letter of decision,\nMs. Lowther wrote, “I . . . disagree with your letter’s efforts to imply that OBO\nis somehow responsible for or approved the improper shipping of the third\nfloor ceiling panels.” JX 1129 at 1.\n\n       On August 18, 2010, plaintiff filed a certified claim for the additional\nsecurity work and mitigation, seeking $1,083,734.91, which includes mold\nmitigation costs for only one building: the NOB. At trial, KI reduced the\namount of the claim to $934,611.\n\n\n23\n  KI sent an initial REA for the security mitigation to the CO at the time,\nBrian Mulcahy, on September 9, 2004, which was subsequently denied by Ms.\nLowther during her second stint as CO.\n\n                                       40\n\f         D.     Finances\n\n                1.     The Audit of KI’s Geotechnical Claim\n\n       KI filed a claim on July 1, 2004, seeking $3,728,358.62 for costs\nassociated with the geotechnical work. In its claim, KI asserted various\ntheories for why it was entitled to additional compensation for the soil\nremediation efforts. First, KI reasoned that “[a]n equitable adjustment is\ndictated by the fact that the parties understood and agreed that the geotechnical\nprogram was not part of the negotiated price on May 9, 2003. . . . It is now\nunconscionable for the OBO to disingenuously assert that the negotiated price\nincluded the geotechnical programs.” JX 25 at 9. If the government did not\nunderstand KI’s position during negotiations, then KI argues that “there was\nno meeting of the minds.” JX 25 at 13. Finally, KI claimed that “the\ngovernment is obtaining the soil stabilization program without paying for it.”\nJX 25 at 14. According to KI, “the government was fully aware that Kullman\nhad not submitted and negotiated a price for the geotechnical program. In\nsimilar situations, the courts have held that the contract may be reformed in\norder to reflect the true intention of the parties . . . .” JX 25 at 14.\n\n       Faced with KI’s geotechnical claim, Ms. Lowther and John C. Sawyer,\nan attorney in the DOS Office of General Counsel, turned to the Office of\nInspector General (“OIG”). On December 1, 2004, Ms. Lowther and Mr.\nSawyer met with the OIG employees, Michelle “Mickie” Selby and August\nVan Dessel, and requested that OIG audit Kullman’s geotechnical claim\nbecause the Department of State believed that it “had paid Kullman for the\nitems that Kullman is basing its claim on.” JX 119 at 226.\n\n       Before the audit began, Robert Powell, the Division Director in the\nOffice of Acquisition Management, issued his final decision regarding KI’s\nJuly 2004 geotechnical claim on December 9, 2004.24 Mr. Powell wrote the\nfollowing with help from Lorri Lowther:\n\n         Your . . . statements make it clear that according to your claim\n         KI has not been paid for the geotechnical work which KI has\n         performed. These statements are very troubling. My staff has\n         made a thorough review of KI’s invoices to date and the\n         payments which the Government has made in response to those\n         invoices. This review indicates that KI has been paid\n\n\n24\n     KI appealed this decision on January 19, 2005. JX 119 at 990.\n\n                                       41\n\f       approximately $2,629,547.00 specifically for all geotechnical\n       work. . . . The invoices reflect that KI has billed for 100% of\n       the geotechnical work and has been paid for the billed amount\n       less contract retainage. This evidence indicates the [sic] KI\n       either believed at some point prior to raising this claim that the\n       contract provided for the cost for geotechnical work and KI was\n       properly billing for the work performed and its associated costs,\n       or KI improperly charged the government for work which was\n       not in the contract. In either case, the evidence to date is that the\n       government has already paid for all geotechnical work\n       performed . . . . My perception is that your claim for\n       $3,728,358.62 is for reimbursement for work already performed\n       and paid for. . . . Wherefore, in light of all the above facts and\n       evidence I deny your claim in its entirety.\n\nJX 26 at 9-10. Mr. Powell also pointed out that KI was required to perform its\nown geotechnical analysis and had even invoiced the government for doing so\nbefore the LBG traveled to the site in January 2003 and throughout the May\n2003 negotiations: “the Department did not once indicate that soil preparation\nwas to be taken out of the contract nor did KI claim that soil preparation was\nnot part of the their GMP Phase II proposal. . . . The only allowance mentioned\nin KI’s September 27, 2002 proposal was for transportation.” JX 26 at 4-5.\n\n        Mr. Powell’s puzzlement about the apparent conflict between the\npremise behind the REA–KI had not been paid for the additional geotechnical\nwork–with the premise behind previous progress payments–that KI had\nperformed and been paid for over $2 million in geotechnical work–is\nunderstandable. The apparent contradiction, of course, is that the contractor\nshould not have been seeking payment for work as to which it had already\nbeen paid. The contradiction is not real, however, given the explanation for\nit. As is more fully explained below in connection with how the SOV was\nused, what Mr. Powell apparently did not know is that KI, with the\nconcurrence of OBO’s Mr. Ross and Ms. Wilkins, put geotechnical work into\nthe SOV and funded it by moving money from transportation to the geotech\nline item. There seems to have been no objection by the contracting officers\nto paying invoices on this basis.\n\n       KI’s decision to budget very little for geotechnical work, of course, was\nbased on the incorrect assumption that the government had agreed in advance\nto approve a differing site condition claim for geotechnical work, up to $2\nmillion. That assumption was misguided, and as we conclude below, this\n\n\n                                        42\n\fmisunderstanding was entirely of KI’s making. Unfortunately, moreover, not\nonly did it cause KI continual financial stress throughout the contract, but it led\nto a quixotic crusade by DOS legal officers to pursue a fraud investigation of\nKI, which unnecessarily poisoned the working relationship between the\nparties.\n\n       “OIG conducted its review in Lebanon, New Jersey, from February 7\nto February 17, 2005, inclusive.” JX 119 at 55. KI provided many documents\nfor OIG to review in the course of the audit, but KI did not provide any\ninformation on its initial pricing proposal or supporting data. The auditors\nwere permitted to “identify information bearing on entitlement” to the claim.\nJX 119 at 226. As part of the audit, the OIG looked for indicators associated\nwith fraudulent claims. The auditors concluded that “[t]here was no one\nindicator present. The contractor was able to support the transactions OIG\nselected for review and we found no exceptions that would indicate fraud.”\nJX 119 at 962.\n\n     Mr. Sawyer and Ms. Lowther were privy to updates on the audit and\ncommunicated about it via e-mail. Mr. Sawyer wrote the following to Ms.\nLowther:\n\n       In reference to the audit. It appears that Kullman did bill the\n       Government for the for the [sic] Geo tech [sic] and have\n       credited it in the books. . . . Kullman put in an REA for a\n       differing site condition on the grounds that the Geotect [sic] was\n       not in the contract . . . . Subsequently Kullman billed for the\n       work as if it were in the contract and we paid the invoices. I\n       believe this counts as an action against interest on the part of\n       Kullman and acceptance of our payment constitutes payment of\n       the debt “satisfaction and accord.” For Kullman, Inc. to have\n       asked for the funds now in a[] claim before the GSBCA I think\n       constitutes a false claim.\n\nJX 811 at 2. Ms. Lowther responded,\n\n       WOW! You never want to believe that anyone could do\n       something like this, but if it had to be one of our contractors\n       then Kullman is the one who I would believe it of. You’re right\n       Kullman did first come in with the REA claiming that Geotech\n       was not part of the contract . . . . Once Kullman received the\n       denial of the REA, they started billing the government . . . .\n\n\n                                        43\n\fJX 811 at 1. We find this professed ignorance of what KI was doing to be\ninexcusable. If Ms. Lowther was genuinely surprised that KI had been given\npermission to move money from transportation to geotech, then she had not\nbeen properly briefed about events prior to her tenure as contracting officer.\n\n        A draft of the OIG audit report was issued in March of 2005. On\nMarch 11, 2005, August Van Dessel e-mailed a draft of the Kullman Claim\nReport to Fay Ropella and Alma Wolfe. JX 119 at 44. The e-mail receipt\nshows that both Ms. Ropella and Ms. Wolfe received and read the draft on this\ndate. The March 11, 2005 draft did not contain any financial figures or\nconclusions, however. Mr. Van Dessel sent another draft to Ms. Wolfe on\nMarch 21, 2005. This draft included the following assessment: “Our audit\ndetermined that Kullman had, through February 16, 2005, incurred $3,523,728\nof costs related to the claim and $11,040,1[2]3 [sic] related to transportation\ncosts.” JX 119 at 51. On April 7, 2005, Mr. Van Dessel e-mailed Mr. Lefkus\na draft of the Audit Report for review and comment.\n\n        The draft of the audit report contained in JX 119 includes changes\nproposed by KI in an e-mail dated April 11, 2005. This draft contained the\nfollowing language, which was ultimately omitted from the final report: “We\nalso determined that the claimed amounts were reasonable, allocable and\notherwise allowable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the\ncontract and with the cost principles set forth in Part 31 of the Federal\nAcquisition Regulation (FAR).” JX 119 at 59. Mr. Van Dessel also inserted\nthis sentence that was provided by KI, “The Modification of the schedule of\nvalues was a cooperative and open effort between OBO and Kullman. The\n‘shifting of funds’ in the schedule never increased the fixed lump sum contract\nand the Contractor only did this after communication and guidance.” JX 119\nat 62. Mr. Van Dessel testified that when Mr. Sawyer was informed of the\ncontents of the draft audit report, he was visibly upset and annoyed. He was\nalso annoyed that KI had been given an advanced draft of the report and been\nasked to comment on it.\n\n        On June 15, 2005, OIG held a meeting of department officials regarding\nthe review of the claim submitted by KI. Mark Duda, Karen Holcomb, Alma\nWolfe, Michelle Selby, Lorri Lowther, John Sawyer, and Dennis Gallagher\nattended this meeting. “Mr. Sawyer prefaced the discussions by thanking OIG\nfor the draft report.” JX 119 at 144. “Ms. Lowther informed all that OBO was\ntaking over the job with the expectation of building what could be done in 60\ndays.” JX 119 at 144. “Ms. Lowther stated that she was receiving calls from\n\n\n                                      44\n\fKullman subcontractors regarding them not being paid by Kullman. Ms.\nLowther was concerned due to the fact that Kullman is certifying on their\nvouchers that the subcontractors have been paid for their work.” JX 119 at\n145. “Mr. Sawyer is hoping DOJ will try the False Claim.” JX 119 at 145.\n“Mr. Sawyer stated that the OIG draft report released to Kullman for their\ncomments was being paraded through the halls of Congress and that it was\nlikely that OIG would be called into court to testify on behalf of Kullman.” JX\n119 at 145.\n\n       The Office of Inspector General’s “Report of Audit” is dated July 2005.\nIts purpose:\n\n       to determine whether amounts claimed were: (1) substantiated\n       as having been incurred; and (2) were reasonable, allocable, and\n       otherwise allowable in accordance with the terms and conditions\n       of the contract and with the cost principles set forth in Part 31 of\n       the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR). OIG extended the\n       scope of its review to include transportation costs incurred by\n       Kullman through February 9, 2005, because Kullman had\n       adjusted this item from $12 million to $8.8 million to provide\n       funding to bill for geotechnical costs.\n\nJX 118 at 3. OIG judgmentally selected and tested 82.8%, or $2,552,278, of\nthe geotechnical costs claimed and 82.4%, or $9,094,366, of transportation\ncosts. For both the geotechnical and transportation costs, OIG found adequate\nsupport for costs tested and noted no exceptions. In sum, the audit confirmed\nKI’s costs with respect to the geotechnical claim. There was nothing deceptive\nabout the claim, moreover, because KI knew that the agency was taking the\nposition that the additional geotechnical work was not part of the contract and\ncould only become part of the contract through a REA. If the claim had been\nsuccessful, monies would have been added to the contract and funds\npresumably would have been restored to the transportation budget.\n\n              2.      Kullman Industries’ Financial Practices\n\n                      a.     The Procedure for Obtaining a Progress Payment\n\n       Despite its financial problems, KI continued to work on the Dushanbe\nproject and to seek payment from the government. In order to receive a\nperiodic payment under the contract for overhead, profit, and “the value of\nlabor and materials completed and in place,” JX 1 at 61, KI would submit an\n\n\n                                       45\n\finvoice, including a certification, to DOS based on the percent of the work\ncompleted compared to the SOV.\n\n                             i.     The Schedule of Values\n\n        Much like a project budget, the SOV was a list comprised of line items\nthat each corresponded to a particular task or activity required to complete the\ncontract. Jt. Stip. ¶ 40; Tr. 1378 (Rand) (“[T]here are no subcontractors or\nsuppliers listed on our invoices to the government, only activities.”). The\ncontract price was allocated among these various line items, such that the\nestimated amounts stated for all the line items added up to the contract price.\nTogether these various line items, and dollar estimates allocated to them,\ncorresponded to the SOV. As Mr. Farley, the on-site DOS Project Director,\ntestified, “[a] schedule of values is basically a breakdown of the contract price\nor contract value into its component parts to assist in the payment process.”25\nTr. 209. Specifically, the SOV “breaks the large contract sum of $60 plus\nmillion down into digestible pieces that you can actually evaluate and assign\npercentages of completion against each of the line items in the schedule of\nvalues and arrive at a total for the month.” Tr. 209 (Farley); see JX 57 at 15.\n\n     Arriving at the monthly percent completion for each line item on the\nSOV was a collaborative process between KI and DOS.26 Mr. Kosinski, KI’s\n\n\n25\n  This understanding of the SOV is consistent with the definition in the\ncontract, which provides:\n\n       The Schedule of Values is a tabulation of cost-loaded work\n       elements or activities as defined in the Contractor’s project\n       execution schedule to include all design, construction, and all\n       other cost elements of the project. The Schedule of Values shall\n       segregate major project elements to reflect design and\n       construction costs for each major building and area of the\n       project.\n\nJX 57 at 15.\n26\n   Mr. Farley gave the following explanation of how the parties would arrive\nat the percent of work completed:\n\n       Essentially a contractor would sit down and go through the\n                                                           (continued...)\n\n                                       46\n\fon-site Project Manager, who was part of that collaborative process, explained\nthat because the SOV was an estimate made at the beginning of the job, the\nvalue of each line item did not always match what eventually was spent on\naccomplishing that task. He testified that “there weren’t direct one-for-one\ncorrelations between everything. Once we actually got to the construction\nphase, you know, the – the design was developed further along and there were\naspects of the construction work that weren’t directly identified or addressed\non the schedule of values.” Tr. 750-51 (Kosinski). One of the illustrations of\nthis lack of precision has been discussed previously, namely, that “[i]n the fall\nof 2003, DOS and Kullman agreed that the SOV would be modified to add line\nitems specific to the geotech work by reallocating $3 million from the\ntransportation line item to the new geotech line items, so that the total contract\nprice did not change.” Jt. Stip. ¶ 40.\n\n        This collaborative effort to move transportation monies into the\ngeotechnical item had the beneficial effect, at least for KI, of giving it money\nup front to cover its actual geotechnical expenses. The unfortunate collateral\neffect of doing so, however, was to camouflage a fundamental disagreement,\nnamely, whether the geotechnical work was covered by the fixed price. By\nmoving $3 million from transportation to geotechnical, KI financed its earlier\nactivities, but it merely postponed the pain of running into the cap on a fixed\n\n\n26\n (...continued)\n       schedule of values and would mark up what he felt he was\n       entitled to be paid for that month, [and] submit it to our office.\n\n       Our engineers would review the various line items as proposed\n       that concern their particular discipline, check off on them or not.\n       And then I would review it, would pass it back to the contractor.\n       The way that we would do this is through an informal discussion\n       if we had disagreements with percentages or amounts that were\n       complete or not complete.\n\n       They would submit it to us. We would review it. We would\n       then discuss and resolve any differences that we may have. It\n       would go back to the contractor, who would then submit a clean\n       copy. We would review it to make sure it agreed with the\n       agreements that we had made. I would sign it, and that would\n       be the payment.\n\nTr. 210-11.\n\n                                       47\n\fprice contract.\n\n                                ii.     The Certifications\n\n        When it submitted invoices, in addition to attaching the relevant portion\nof the SOV, KI was required27 to make certain certified representations. The\nprecise wording of that certification varied over the life of the contract, but the\ncertification relevant to the government’s fraud claim was that it “has made\nfull payment from the proceeds of prior payments,” and that it “will make\ntimely payment from the proceeds of the progress or final payment for which\nrequest is being made, to [the] subcontractors and suppliers in accordance with\n[its] contractual arrangements with them.” JX 1 a t 61.28\n\n\n27\n  The contract incorporates by reference FAR 52.232-5(c) (1997) and FAR\n52.232-27 (Prompt payment for subs). The former states that,\n\n         Along with each request for progress payment, the Contractor\n         shall furnish the following certification, or payment shall not be\n         made: (However, if the Contractor elects to delete paragraph\n         (c)(4) from the certification, the certification is still acceptable.)\n\n         I here by certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that –\n                 (1) The amounts requested are only for performance in\n         accordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the\n         contract;\n                 (2) Payments to subcontractors and suppliers have been\n         made from previous payments received under the contract, and\n         timely payments will be made from the proceeds of the payment\n         covered by this certification, in accordance with subcontract\n         agreements and the requirements of chapter 39 of Title 31,\n         United States Code;\n                 (3) This request for progress payments does not include\n         any amounts which the prime contractor intends to withhold or\n         retain from a subcontractor or supplier in accordance with the\n         terms and conditions of the subcontract; and\n                 (4) This certification is not to be construed as final\n         acceptance of a subcontractor’s performance.\n\n28\n     The form and content of the progress payment application was directed by\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                          48\n\f        KI’s initial invoices pertaining to the Dushanbe project did not include\nany certification. Then, on November 13, 2003, Eduardo Gaarder, the Chief\nof the European and Eurasian Branch of the Construction and Commissioning\nDivision of OBO, contacted Mr. Rand about KI’s pending application and\ncertification for payment. Mr. Gaarder sent Mr. Rand two example pay\napplication forms, noting in particular the importance of the certification. KI\nbegan using the following certification from one of the examples provided:\n\n       The undersigned Contractor certifies that to the best of the\n       Contractor’s knowledge, information and belief of Work\n       covered by this Application for Payment has been completed in\n       accordance with the Contract Documents, that all amounts have\n       been paid by the Contractor for Work for which previous\n       Certificated for Payment were issued and payments received\n       from the Owner, and that current payment shown herein is now\n       due.\n\nJX 288 at 2.\n\n       At the end of March 2004, Catherine Wilkins, the DOS Project\nDirector, Sharmeena Salam-Haughton, the OBO Project Executive, and Mr.\nGaarder indicated to Mr. Rand their view that the certification was not explicit\nenough regarding payments made to subcontractors and suppliers. Mr.\nGaarder e-mailed Mr. Rand with an acceptable certification, which Mr. Rand\nbegan using on KI’s subsequent pay applications. Consequently, during the\nperiod of May 2004 through April 2005, KI submitted invoices that bore the\nfollowing certification:\n\n       I hereby certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that\n       –\n       (1) The amounts requested are only for performance in\n       accordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the\n       contract[;] (2) All payments due to subcontractors and suppliers\n       from previous payments received under the contract have been\n\n\n       28\n        (...continued)\nthe Project Director. JX 1513 at 84 (Division I of the contract documents)\n(“The Project Director shall provide to the Contractor an example form,\n[which] . . . . shall delineate information required for each application [for\nprogress payment]. The Contractor shall comply with format as directed . . .\nby the Project Director.”).\n\n                                       49\n\f       made, and timely payments will be made from the proceeds of\n       the payment covered by this certification, in accordance with\n       subcontract agreements and the requirements of chapter 39 of\n       Title 31, United States Code; (3) This request for progress\n       payments does not include any amounts which the prime\n       contractor intends to withhold or retain from a subcontractor or\n       supplier in accordance with the terms and conditions of the\n       subcontract; and (4) This certification is not to be construed as\n       final acceptance of a subcontractor’s performance.\n\nJt. Stip. ¶ 42; JX 999 at 1.\n\n      Each of the invoices at issue were prepared and certified by Alan Rand.\nMr. Rand, whom the court found to be a straightforward witness, testified that\nhe understood that “[t]he certification meant that we were paying suppliers in\naccordance with the contracts with the government. And also the fact that the\nmoney coming in for the project was being spent on the project.” Tr. 1267.\nMr. Rand further explained that,\n\n       I was certifying that the money that the government was paying\n       Kullman was being used to pay its sub and suppliers, but once\n       that money ran out there may have been more subs and suppliers\n       that still needed to be paid. But that the money came in from the\n       government, that money was used to pay whatever subs and\n       suppliers could be paid. And, in fact, Kullman paid out more\n       money than they [sic] had received from the government by the\n       end of the project in May or June.\n\nTr. 1453-54. Mr. Rand admitted he was aware that, toward the end of the\nproject, KI had to juggle payments to subcontractors and suppliers and that\nBelcor, Inc. (“Belcor”), the supplier of parts related to the fuel distribution\nsystem, had not been fully paid. Despite this, Mr. Rand believed that he was\ntruthful in signing the certification because all of the money received from\neach progress payment was used to pay subcontractors and suppliers. KI was\nretaining no funds for itself, but it was doing triage in terms of paying some,\nbut not all, of the amounts owed.\n\n                      b.       KI’s Dealings with Belcor, Inc.\n\n      KI initially ordered tanks and accessories from Belcor in February of\n2004. This first order totaled $170,259, and the term for payment was “NET\n\n\n                                        50\n\f30,” which according to Mr. Bell, meant that Belcor would invoice KI for the\nitems once they were delivered and KI agreed to pay Belcor within 30 days of\nreceiving Belcor’s invoice. Delivery of the tanks and accessories was\nscheduled for June 30, 2004.\n\n       The items supplied by Belcor, including fuel tanks, day tanks, and their\naccessories, correspond with line item “STF 1074 Fab Fuel tanks, piping &\nship to port” on the SOV. JX 640 at 6; see Tr. 236 (Farley). Of the total\ncontract funds, $435,074 was designated for this line item.\n\n        Belcor sent KI the first invoice on May 5, 2004, in the amount of\n$43,475 for items delivered in accordance with the first purchase order. KI\npaid this invoice in full on July 12, 2004, which was more than 30 days from\nthe date of the invoice but before KI billed DOS for any work attributable to\nline item STF 1074. On June 29, 2004, Belcor sent KI a second invoice for\n$27,808.16 for more items requested in the first purchase order. KI paid this\nbill in full on August 23, 2004, which was again more than 30 days from the\ndate of the invoice but before KI billed DOS for any work attributable to line\nitem STF 1074. Belcor sent two more invoices to KI in the month of August:\nAugust 9, 2004, in the amount of $76,855 and August 25, 2004, in the amount\nof $22,120.90. These two invoices, together totaling $98,975.90, remained\nunpaid until January 2005.\n\n       KI first requested reimbursement for work performed under line item\nSTF 1074 through invoice No. 13220, which covered work performed on the\nproject through August 31, 2004. KI requested half of the funds from this line\nitem and received the requested amount, $217,537, as part of the periodic\npayment29 DOS approved on September 22, 2004. The parties stipulated that\nKI received the funds from invoice No. 13220 on October 14, 2004. On\nDecember 10, 2004, KI requested payment for the remainder of line item STF\n1074 as part of invoice No. 13386, which covered work performed through\nNovember 30, 2004. Invoice No. 13386 contained the certification. DOS\napproved the payment30 on December 21, 2004, but KI did not receive the\nfunds until January 6, 2005. As of January 6, 2005, KI had received the full\namount of contract funds designated in the SOV for prefabricated tanks.\n\n         On December 27, 2004, Robert B. Bell, President of Belcor, wrote the\n\n\n29\n     DOS did not withhold retainage from this payment.\n30\n     Again, DOS did not elect to withhold retainage from this payment.\n\n                                      51\n\ffollowing in a letter to KI:\n\n       Belcor, Inc. has two invoices outstanding on this project totaling\n       $98,975.90 (copies attached), both of these are now out 120\n       days with no payment received. The terms on []your PO clearly\n       state “Net 30”.\n\n       Numerous calls to Kullman by Belcor have gone unanswered.\n       No response, no call backs, no payments. Belcor, Inc. is, as you\n       know, a small business, and this lack of payment is creating\n       undo financial hardship on our company.\n\n       I would appreciate a response from Kullman Industries, but\n       more importantly, fulfilment of the contract obligations by make\n       [sic] payment.\n\nJX 721 at 1. This letter began a series of communications between Mr. Bell\nand KI employees.\n\n      Andy Linkowsky, an employee in KI’s purchasing department,\nresponded via e-mail on December 31, 2004, providing a contact telephone\nnumber and informing Mr. Bell that Mr. Rand and Stuart Frieman, the Chief\nFinancial Officer, had been made aware of Mr. Bell’s letter and that someone\nfrom KI would contact Mr. Bell within a few business days. On January 10,\n2005, Mr. Freiman sent an e-mail to Mr. Pearson, Mr. Lefkus, and Mr.\nKullman that contained the following:\n\n       As per our discussion on Saturday, we are sending Belcor 10M\n       towards the 100M we owe them. I spoke to Bob Bell of Belcor\n       this morning to discuss the same. Given that we are\n       acknowledging the debt and are sending them 10M, he remained\n       sane.\n\nJX 734. As promised, KI paid Belcor $10,000 on January 13, 2005. Although\nBelcor received this payment, Mr. Bell wrote to Ms. Lowther on January 13\nto inform her of the remaining unpaid invoices.\n\n        After making the $10,000 payment, KI requested additional supplies\nfrom Belcor. In response, Belcor provided a price estimate and indicated its\nwillingness to provide the additional items but wrote in a January 18 letter that\nfulfilling the order would be a problem because “Kullman Industries is on\n\n\n                                       52\n\fcredit hold with Belcor, Inc. due to a past due balance of $88,000.00 which is\nover 5 months past due. Without resolution of this outstanding obligation . .\n. Belcor, Inc. cannot authorize further shipments of materials.” JX 745. On\nJanuary 20, 2005, Mr. Rand e-mailed Mr. Freiman the following message:\n\n       Stu,\n\n       KI owes Belcor approximately $88,000. We need to order an\n       additional $10,000 (approximately) worth of materials. Thus,\n       our total outstanding debt with Belcor will soon be $98,000.\n\n       I spoke to Bob Bell today. He has agreed to continue to sell us\n       materials, etc. However, he is looking for some type of payment\n       plan. The $88,000 is a very large open receivable for his firm.\n\n       I have agreed to pay him $20,000 within the next seven to ten\n       days. This will reduce his debt to effectively $78,000. From\n       that point we need some general understanding of a payment\n       plan that he can expect.\n\n       Please plug the $20,000 commitment into your calculations for\n       cash flow, etc.\n\nJX 757.31\n\n       On January 21, 2005, KI issued a purchase order to Belcor for filler,\npipe, couplings, and an adhesive kit totaling $8,858.75. KI sent Belcor another\npayment of $10,000 on January 25, 2005. Two days later, KI ordered from\nBelcor another $1,878 worth of supplies, including straps for securing the\ntanks.\n\n        Daniel Jordan, a KI project manager assigned to the Dushanbe project,\ne-mailed Mr. Freiman on February 2, 2005, with a list of creditors “to be paid,”\none of which was Belcor. JX 779. Mr. Jordan wrote, “we owe [Belcor]\n$78,975.90, but pay whatever we can spare. Bob Bell has bent over backwards\nto get his material on our recent air shipment.” JX 779. Mr. Rand was copied\non this e-mail. KI paid Belcor $10,000 on February 7, 2005. The next day,\n\n\n31\n   Mr. Freiman’s response to Mr. Rand was less than enthusiastic as he\nquestioned “who authorized you to make a commitment for $ without talking\nto me.” JX 757.\n\n                                      53\n\fBelcor sent KI invoice No. 34073 in the amount of $9,475.97. On February\n23, 2005, Belcor invoiced KI another $465 and KI paid Belcor another\n$10,000. KI made a $5,000 payment to Belcor on March 22, 2005.\n\n       On April 18, 2005, Mr. Bell sent an e-mail to Mr. Linkowsky at KI\nchecking on the status of payment. KI paid Belcor another $5,000 the\nfollowing day. This was the final payment that KI would make to Belcor. The\nbalance remaining at that time was $60,869.\n\n                       c.     The Government’s Knowledge Of KI’s Position\n\n       Before KI fell behind on its payments to Belcor, it notified the\ngovernment of its financial problems, which KI attributed to difficulties with\nthe Dushanbe project. See JX 303 (KI informed the government of its\nprecarious financial position and that “subcontractors struggle with large\noutstanding balances for work that has already been performed and approved”\nas early as December 5, 2003). On April 30, 2004, Mr. Lefkus sent Ms.\nLowther a letter in response to an April 13 meeting attended by Ms. Lowther,\nMr. Lefkus, and Mr. Rand. In the letter, Mr. Lefkus lists “Contractor’s Out-\nof-Pocket” unpaid expenses for which the agency was withholding payment,\nincluding the costs for geotechnical work, two unpaid invoices, and another\ntransportation invoice, which totaled over $9.5 million. JX 475 at 2. Mr.\nLefkus also pointed out that KI faced an additional $6.5 million in “Immediate\nFuture Obligations.” JX 475 at 2. In light of these unreimbursed expenses,\nMr. Lefkus informed Ms. Lowther that “[t]he project economics simply do not\nwork for Kullman . . . . [because of] the severity of these economic issues.”\nJX 475 at 2. Mr. Lefkus conceded that “[t]he resources to float this amount of\nmoney simply do not exist.” JX 475 at 2. To address this situation, KI sought\n“a reasonable remedy where OBO can feel it maintains appropriate security\nwhile the project funding ensures robust performance.” JX 475 at 2.\n\n       In a June 2, 2004 e-mail Mr. Lefkus once again stressed the importance\nof a meeting between officials from KI and the government to discuss the cash\nflow from the Dushanbe project. Mr. Lefkus sent this e-mail to Walter Cate,\nthe Division Director in the DOS Bureau of Acquisitions and copied Mr. Rand\nand Mr. Kullman. Mr. Cate forwarded the original e-mail to Mr. Powell,\ndirecting him to set up a meeting including Ms. Lowther. Ms. Lowther\nresponded internally to Mr. Powell and Mr. Cate on June 3, 2004,32 that she\n\n\n32\n     As of June 3, 2004, KI had received the first invoice from Belcor and was\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                       54\n\fdid not believe a meeting would prove useful until KI provided “HARD\nDATA,” in writing, to “back-up their wild accusations” especially in light of\nthe fact that the contract was almost a year behind schedule, that there were\nongoing security issues, and that “[w]e have subcontractors that have not been\npaid.” JX 521 at 1.\n\n       Additionally, Ms. Lowther testified at trial that subcontractors and\nsuppliers called her and sent her letters informing her that KI had not paid for\nwork performed on, or supplies provided for, the Dushanbe project. See JX\n1495 (November 18, 2004 letter sent by Ms. Lowther to Mr. Rand informing\nhim that York International Corporation (“York”) had complained to her about\nKI’s failure to pay in full); see also JX 692 (Mr. Rand’s November 22, 2004\nresponse asserting that KI had paid York substantially more money than DOS\nhad paid KI for line items attributable to work performed by York).33\n\n       Despite these facts, Ms. Lowther maintained at trial that KI did not\nnotify DOS that it was withholding payment from Belcor. According to Ms.\nLowther, notification under the contract was a formal process. Ms. Lowther\npointed to the fact that KI formally notified her, via e-mail, of its intent to\nwithhold funds from Greenway Enterprises due to a dispute with the\nsubcontractor. Mr. Rand did,34 in fact, notify Ms. Lowther and Ms. Salam-\nHaughton in writing that KI was withholding funds from Greenway\nEnterprises because that subcontractor was being terminated for default.\n\n       As a practical matter, however, by January 13, 2005, Ms. Lowther\nclearly knew that KI had not fully paid Belcor because Mr. Bell wrote to Ms.\nLowther informing her of the situation. Ms. Lowther responded to Mr. Bell\n\n\n32\n  (...continued)\nwithin the “NET 30” period for payment. KI did not invoice the government\nfor line item STF 1074 until August 31, 2004, but paid Belcor’s two initial\ninvoices by August 23, 2004.\n33\n  Ms. Lowther testified that her role was limited to communicating with KI\nabout alleged shortfalls in payment to suppliers or subcontractors. She\ntypically did not investigate such allegations but would turn them over to her\nsupervisor and the Office of Inspector General.\n34\n  According to Mr. Rand, this notification was required under the certification\nbecause Greenway Enterprises was a major subcontractor on the project and\nKI was anticipating major shortfalls due to the issues with Greenway.\n\n                                      55\n\fin a February 3, 2005 letter by summarizing the applicable regulations, noting\nthat the “government is not privy to the information contained in any prime-\nsubcontract agreements” and was therefore not involved in the dispute,\npointing to the contract between KI and Belcor as the “key document” for\ndetermining whether KI was within its rights to withhold funds, and assuring\nMr. Bell that she would remind KI of its obligation to pay subcontractors and\nsuppliers. JX 782. On the same day, Ms. Lowther sent a letter to KI\nreminding it that “[o]fficial notification must be provided to the subcontractor\nand the Contracting Officer in order to fulfill these requirements [under the\nFAR] or else payment must be made.” JX 783 at 1. Ms. Lowther also\nforwarded to KI her response to Mr. Bell.\n\n       While KI did not respond in writing, it did attempt to address the issue\nin person. Ms. Lowther recorded the interaction in an e-mail she sent to Mr.\nSawyer:\n\n       Today was the site meeting and both Mr. Rand and I attended\n       the meeting and we were both very professional. However, in\n       the meeting they just couldn’t help themselves knowing, I was\n       in the room and they starting [sic] complaining how they\n       couldn’t pay their subcontractors because the government owed\n       them money for Geotech, Mitigation and blah, blah, blah.\n\nJX 811 at 1. After this, KI continued to submit certified invoices through the\nspring of 2005,35 and the agency continued to pay them.\n\n        After KI’s April 2005 payment of $5,000, Belcor continued pressing KI\nto satisfy the outstanding balance of $60,869. Mr. Bell called KI, he e-mailed,\nand he threatened to get DOS involved; all to no avail. Although Mr. Bell did\nnot know it at the time, during May through July of 2005, KI was winding\ndown construction on the Dushanbe project and preparing to abandon the job.\n\nIV.    Termination for Default\n\n       A.     Final Efforts\n\n       Toward the end of the contract, KI sought additional funds from the\n\n\n35\n  Invoice No. 13442 was submitted on February 1, 2005, Invoice No. 13493\nwas submitted on March 2, 2005, Invoice No. 13561 was submitted on April\n11, 2005, and Invoice No. 13647 was submitted on May 12, 2005.\n\n                                      56\n\fgovernment and from private sources to ameliorate the project deficit caused\nby the accumulation of several issues: the geotechnical work, the security and\nmold mitigation issue, and retainage.\n\n               1.    KI Petitions Ms. Lowther for Return of Retainage\n\n        KI formally petitioned Mr. Cate and Mr. Powell to return a portion of\nthe retained funds on February 18, 2005. On behalf of KI, Mr. Rand wrote,\n\n       Over the course of the past twelve months Kullman Industries\n       has been promised a reduction in the current high amount of\n       retainage held on the Dushanbe NEC project initially based\n       upon our ability to successfully transport the modules from our\n       Lebanon, NJ fabrication site to the Dushanbe NEC site. In fact,\n       we were promised a pro-rata reduction in the retainage based\n       upon successful monthly arrivals of the modules in Dushanbe.\n       Despite successfully delivering the modules to the site, the\n       retainage was never reduced. Subsequently, we were promised\n       a reduction in retainage based upon the completion and\n       submission of a ‘final’ Geotech report. Attached, please see a\n       copy of the final Geotech report.\n\n       I trust that we are now at a point where the retainage on this\n       project can be reduced to a more appropriate level given the fact\n       that Kullman Industries is approximately 87% complete with the\n       project, and to a level that more accurately reflects any\n       remaining risk that OBO deems required.\n\nJX 826 at 1.\n\n       Ms. Lowther denied this request on March 4, stating that it was the\nCO’s right under FAR 52.232-5 to retain up to 10% of the contract value when\nthe contractor had not made adequate or satisfactory progress. JX 863 at 1\n(“The promises Kullman references that were made last year to reduce the\nretainage were based on the successful transporting of the modules, significant\nprogress of work and development of an accurate completion schedule. To\ndate, Kullman has not demonstrated significant progress.”). Ms. Lowther did\nnot mention liquidated damages as a justification for withholding the\npreviously retained funds.\n\n\n\n\n                                      57\n\f              2.     KI’s Attempt to Obtain Private Funding\n\n      In February of 2005, KI began an effort to borrow approximately\n$2,000,000 from Tatonka Capital Corporation (“Tatonka”). By May 5, 2005,\nKI and Tatonka had worked out the terms of a loan.\n\n       Carol Hansen, Tatonka’s Chief Executive Officer, contacted Ms.\nLowther “for confirmation of the Dushanbe numbers.” JX 1007 at 1. After\nspeaking to Ms. Lowther, Ms. Hansen called Mr. Kullman and informed him\nthat Tatonka could not go through with the loan. According to Mr. Kullman,\nMs. Hansen told him that “Lorri told her that my money was being held for\nretainage, that there was mold litigation going on, I was never going to get\nretainage, and, you know, things weren’t in too good shape.” Tr. 1823.\nFollowing this telephone conversation, Mr. Kullman e-mailed Ms. Hansen\nwith a draft letter memorializing what she had told him about her conversation\nwith Ms. Lowther and asked her to sign and send the letter to KI if she agreed\nwith the content. Ms. Hansen agreed with the content and sent the letter on\nMay 13, 2005, which detailed her conversation with Ms. Lowther and formally\ndenied KI’s request for funding. Ms. Hansen wrote to Mr. Kullman, “While\nMs. Lowther confirmed the retainage amount you indicated, she stated that\nKullman was involved with mold litigation and that liquidated damages would\nbe assessed. While you made us aware of the geotech claim, these undisclosed\nissues prevent us from moving forward.” JX 1007 at 1.\n\n       When asked at trial about her conversation with Ms. Hansen, Ms.\nLowther maintained her position that the government was assessing liquidated\ndamages but admitted that she knew there was no litigation involving the mold\nmitigation.\n\n     After failing to secure private funding, KI wrote the following to Ms.\nLowther:\n\n       In an effort to keep the project moving despite excessive funds\n       being retained, Kullman sought financing. However, when a\n       representative of the financing institution contacted you\n       regarding the status of the project, you incorrectly stated that\n       there was mold litigation, and that you were withholding funds\n       due to that litigation. This misstatement caused the financing\n       institution to retract its offer of financing to Kullman. In\n       addition, the financing institution was advised that liquidated\n       damages were being assessed. We have no knowledge of any\n\n\n                                     58\n\f       assessment of liquidated damages. Whether it was your\n       intention or not, you certainly damaged Kullman’s financial\n       resources, which may affect the completion of the project.\n\nJX 1031 at 2 (KI’s response to the government’s cure notice).\n\n              3.     KI Meets with DOS Officials in a Final Attempt to\n                     Obtain Funding\n\n        After exhausting options for private funding, KI once again approached\nthe government in an attempt to convince it to release all or part of the money\nthat it had retained on the contract. Mr. Kullman testified that he contacted\nGeneral Williams, congressmen, senators, and even “Arlen Specter to go to\nConnie Rice who was the head of the State Department.” Tr. 1522-23.\nEventually, Mr. Kullman got in touch with Mr. Prior, the Construction and\nCommissioning Director at OBO within DOS. Mr. Prior set up a meeting that\noccurred in May of 2005. Mr. Kullman recalled the following:\n\n       So then I speak to Mr. Prior, and he’s, you know, he speaks to\n       General Williams. And he says, General Williams is upset\n       about the whole thing and he’s upset how your finance company\n       was interfered with, and there is a recording of that conversation\n       . . . . And we had a meeting. And it was in a large conference\n       room filled with the Cates of the world and all the top people\n       were there.\n\n       And I told them, I can’t finish this job. I am going to go out of\n       business. I am going to go bankrupt. I can’t pay people. And\n       they sit there – and now all these people had never heard of the\n       Geotech Report. You’re telling me that the people in that room\n       didn’t know there was a Geotech Report? Okay. Anyway I\n       walked out of that room, and what they said was they were\n       either going to figure out how they could release some retainage,\n       how to maybe find out, do something on the geotech, do\n       something in all these different items to free up some money so\n       we could finish the job. So that’s the first time I ever saw a\n       meeting where everyone wanted to get together and finish this\n       job.\n\nTr. 1524-25. Despite KI’s persistent efforts to have the government address\none of the pending requests for equitable adjustments or to release some of the\n\n\n                                      59\n\fretained funds, it was unsuccessful.\n\n       B.      The Cure Notice\n\n        Instead of responding to KI’s latest request for money, Ms. Lowther\nsent a formal cure notice to KI on May 21, 2005. JX 1027 at 1 (noting that KI\nand the government had met extensively during the previous week about the\n“current situation”). In the letter, she reminded KI that the Dushanbe Project\nwas awarded as a sole-source contract because of the project’s urgent and\ncompelling nature. She wrote, “[n]othing has changed to lessen the urgency\nof the completion of this project. . . . [T]ime is of the essence in the completion\nof this project.” JX 1027 at 1. Then, Ms. Lowther listed the following reasons\nthat KI was failing to make adequate progress:\n\n       1.      The Government understands that York International is\n               retaining necessary parts for air conditioning because of\n               lack of payment.\n       2.      The Government understands that PDI has not returned\n               to the site. PDI’s work is on the critical path to\n               completing this project.\n       3.      The Government understands that there is 60,000 lbs of\n               materials remaining at Baltimore Packing. This material\n               needs to be shipped to the site immediately.\n       4.      The Government understands that there are 6 containers\n               in Riga awaiting trans [sic] shipment to Dushanbe.\n\nJX 1027 at 1. Unless KI cured these conditions by June 17, 2005, “the\nGovernment will be forced to consider termination for default under the terms\nand conditions of the contract.” JX 1027 at 1. Although the contract\ncompletion date of June 20, 2004, had not been changed as of the date of the\ncure notice, Ms. Lowther indicated that the government expected substantial\ncompletion of the Dushanbe Project by September 1, 2005.\n\n        KI responded on the following business day May 23, 2005, with a letter\naddressing the issues raised in the cure notice. JX 1032. KI asserted that it\ncomplied with the first condition and ordered the parts requested from York\nInternational. Next, KI requested DOS’s assistance to secure PDI’s return to\nthe job site because PDI was currently occupied with another DOS project. KI\nexplained that the materials remaining in Baltimore were not delaying the\nproject even if they arrived after June 17, as scheduled. It indicated, however,\nthat it was willing to expedite the shipping if the government was willing to\n\n\n                                        60\n\fpay for the increased air freight shipping costs. Regarding the final condition,\nKI pointed out that the containers were delayed in Riga because of political\nunrest, which was beyond KI’s control.\n\n        After explaining its position on the conditions to be cured, KI reasserted\nits position on the release of funds being retained and the financial difficulties\nof the project. Finally, KI expressed the following:\n\n       Although Kullman wants to complete the Dushanbe project, it\n       may be forced by the State Department’s actions, including its\n       material breaches of the contract, to reduce its forces to an\n       appropriate economic level. This step, if taken, is not take\n       lightly or without considerable forethought. It is somewhat\n       incongruous and disconcerting that when the project is nearly\n       complete, the State Department has acted in an arbitrary and\n       capricious manner, has breached its duty of cooperation and has\n       interfered with Kullman’s ability to prosecute the work to\n       completion, including impairment of its ability to obtain\n       financing.\n\nJX 1031 at 2.\n\n       Ms. Lowther mailed and faxed a response to KI on May 24, 2005,\nwhich noted KI’s failure to affirm that it would cure all conditions by the\nstated deadlines. She also noted that KI had reduced its on-site workforce by\n50% and that an “increase in manpower remains a condition of Cure.” JX\n1035 at 3. Ms. Lowther reiterated that the project remained urgent and\ncompelling and that the government expected KI to cure and make adequate\nprogress to remain in compliance with the contract.\n\n       C.       “Winding Down”\n\n        Following its response to the cure notice, KI began to reduce its\nparticipation at the Dushanbe job site to what it considered an economically\nfeasible level. In fact, KI had been considering whether it should wind down\nits participation at the Dushanbe project site for some time prior to the cure\nnotice.\n\n        KI’s internal discussions about whether to reduce the scope of work at\nthe Dushanbe Project began in March of 2005. See JX 860 (discussing plans\nto increase the workforce with 15 additional cleared American workers, noting\n\n\n                                       61\n\fthat the lack of funding made paying current workers difficult, and concluding\nthat “[w]e may very well have reached the point where we need to pull back\nthe American staff and slow down the operation until OBO releases additional\nfunds”); Tr. 577-79 (Kosinski). Ms. Lowther recorded that “[b]eginning on\nMay 11, 2005, Kullman initiated a draw down in its workforce by cutting\napproximately 50 percent of its cleared American workers on site.” JX 1035\nat 3 (May 24, 2005 letter to KI regarding KI’s response to the cure notice).\n\n        On May 21, 2005, Mr. Kosinski discussed with Mr. Rand and Mr.\nLefkus the cost of travel “to fly everyone out of here if that’s where we end\nup.” JX 1030 at 1 (suggesting also that five individuals remain in Dushanbe\n“to wrap things up”). By the time that KI had responded to the cure notice,\nMr. Kosinski had prepared a spreadsheet of KI’s minimum monthly operating\ncosts that could be adjusted depending on “how far we want to scale back.”\nJX 1033 at 1. Mr. Kosinski recommended leaving the “Case backhoe, the\nBobcat, . . . the small compactor” and the “Lull” on site so that KI could\n“continue with at least some of the excavation and grading work even if we\ndecide to pull everything else out.” JX 1033 at 1. The plan to send a majority\nof the workforce home continued to develop over the next few days. See JX\n1038 (including a detailed travel plan), JX 1059 (stating the need to purchase\ntickets so that the workforce could travel home between the twenty-second and\ntwenty-fifth of June).\n\n        Part of KI’s internal conversation about whether and to what extent the\ncompany should diminish its forces in Dushanbe concerned an effort to predict\nhow the government would respond. Some KI decision-makers hoped that\nreducing the workforce in Dushanbe would cause the agency to take seriously\nKI’s claims regarding its dire financial situation and would lead it to grant one\nof KI’s various requests for funding. Mr. Rand was not optimistic about the\noutcome, however, and wrote the following to Mr. Lefkus: “As we get closer\nto D-day with OBO I feel that everyone should be very clear of ‘the end\ngame’. I would not put it past OBO to terminate KI for default, and then to\nhire a [general contractor] to complete.” JX 1064 at 1 (e-mail dated May 29,\n2005). He warned Mr. Lefkus that “[w]e are thinking much to [sic] logically\nand from a business sense to understand how the government works.” JX\n1064 at 2.\n\n        In June, the Dushanbe project was nearing completion as KI worked on\nthe interior and exterior finishes of the buildings and prepared to lay the curbs\nwhere the roads had been graded. Even as work continued, however, KI\nfurther developed its plan for how to move most of its workforce out of\n\n\n                                       62\n\fDushanbe. JX 1086 (June 7, 2005 e-mail with attachment “showing how\nmuch additional funding is required to pay off all our local accounts as of June\n15th”); JX 1090 (June 7, 2005 e-mail working out travel details). Mr.\nKosinski testified that while there was a possibility that KI could re-mobilize\nthe workforce if the government provided additional funding, the only people\nwho were scheduled to return to Dushanbe were himself, Fred Martinez, and\nJoseph Allen.\n\n       Despite the fact that KI planned to leave the job site in June, it kept its\nintentions concealed from subcontractors and from the government. JX 1090\nat 1 (“At some point - BUT NOT YET!!!! - we will need to notify Atlantic\nGroup to make . . . arrangements for their (5) remaining guys who are also\nscheduled to depart via Istanbul on the 22nd. Please take direction from Alan\non the appropriate time to contact the Atlantic Group - NOT YET!!!”); Tr. 596\n(Kosinski) (“[I]t seems that we didn’t want to let Atlantic Group know what\nwe were planning to do at that point. . . . Maybe it was we didn’t want them to\npull their guys out or to get concerned that we were pulling off the project.\nMaybe we didn’t want them to tip our hand to the government at that point.”).\nOne reason was that DOS had approved a $679,423.00 progress payment on\nJune 2, 2005, which KI was waiting to receive as of June 7, 2005. JX 1087 at\n1 (“Mr. Kullman confidentially explained to us that he will be collecting a\nfairly large receivable from the State Department. After receiving this\npayment, he will begin pulling his people off the State Department job.”).\n\n       Between June 1 and June 18, KI maintained only minimal labor on site.\nOn June 13, 2005, Mr. Kosinski wrote to Christine Byrnes, Alan Rand’s\nAdministrative Assistant,36 that the local workers would be laid off the next\nday. The June 13 travel plan listed departure dates for local workers and KI\nemployees between June 8 and June 25. KI began sending letters to its\nsubcontractors on June 14, 2005, asking them to cease work on the Dushanbe\nproject, remove any on-site workers or materials, and halt any plans to deploy\nmaterials or personnel. KI included in these stop work orders a sentence\nexpressing that “[w]e are hoping to work out disputes with the US State\nDepartment in order to remobilize the project. However, we do not know what\nthe outcome of these discussions will be.” JX 1114 at 1. Mr. Kullman\nattempted to contact Ms. Lowther by phone and e-mail on June 14, 2005, to\n“discuss the current situation on the project.” JX 1118 at 1. Nevertheless, Mr.\nKosinski meanwhile was destroying contract files as part of preparations to\nleave the job site. As of June 20, 2005, KI had suspended all contractor and\n\n\n36\n     Mr. Rand, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Allen were copied on this e-mail.\n\n                                       63\n\fsubcontractor activities on site.\n\n       D.     The End\n\n     On June 17, 2005, DOS terminated the contract for default. Ms.\nLowther wrote the following:\n\n       Based on our telephone conversation the afternoon of June 14,\n       2005 the Government understands that Kullman Industries is\n       demobilizing from the Dushanbe NEC project site effective\n       Monday June 13, 2005. The Government also understands that\n       Kullman has written to all of its subcontractors on the project\n       and informed them that they will not be paid and should leave\n       the project site. This information has been confirmed today by\n       the OBO representative at the site. The OBO representative at\n       site telephoned OBO Washington this morning to notify OBO\n       that your project manager has confirmed that all subcontractors\n       have been terminated and that all work on the project has\n       ceased. You are hereby notified that the Department of State\n       considers such unilateral action on the part of Kullman\n       Industries to be an intentional and inexcusable breach of\n       contract.\n\nJX 1133 at 1, JX 1135 at 1.37 Ms. Lowther testified that after “looking at\n\n\n37\n   In the CO’s June 17, 2005 Final Decision letter, she asserted that she had\n“assessed liquidated damages as a result of Kullman’s failure to complete this\nproject on time” and that KI would “be liable for any damages to the\nGovernment resulting from the Contractor’s refusal and failure to complete the\nwork within the specified time” including costs incurred to complete the work.\nJX 1133 at 2, JX 1135 at 2. There is no evidence that Ms. Lowther actually\nfollowed up with a formal assessment of liquidated damages or reprocurement\ncosts. She had previously stated in the May 24, 2005 letter, however, which\nwas in the series of communications regarding the cure notice, that the\ngovernment had notified KI in writing on June 18, 2004 that it was assessing\nliquidated damages and that “[t]o date, Kullman has incurred $1,139,060.00\nin [liquidated damages]. In addition, the June 18, 2004 letter explained that\nany retainage released would be less the amount of accumulated [liquidated\ndamages].” JX 1035 at 3; Tr. 483 (Lowther). As Ms. Lowther pointed out, the\ngovernment was within its rights under the FAR to retain roughly 4% of the\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                      64\n\feverything as a whole and with them basically leaving the job site and not\nprogressing on the contract, I felt like I had no other recourse than to terminate\nthem.” Tr. 450. When asked by the court if her decision might have been\ndifferent if she had considered KI’s assertion that its inability to pay\nsubcontractors was caused by the government’s failure to release previously\nearned but retained funds, Ms. Lowther answered, “[a]t the time of the\nTermination for Default? Without sounding cold, I would have to say [no]\nbecause they were leaving the job site and that was primarily what I was\nbasing the determination on, was lack of progress with the work.” Tr. 481.\nThus, the CO’s ultimate justification for terminating KI was that it had\nabandoned the job.\n\n       When work ceased, the Dushanbe Project was, according to the OBO\nProject Director’s Monthly Progress Report, 91.29% complete. On June 6,\n2005, Irving Fontaine, the on site Project Director recorded that KI had\nrecently completed the following activities:\n\n       [I]nstalled external window trims at NOB; completed floor tiles\n       at NOB dining; installed spandrel windows at NOB and MSGQ\n       stair towers; installed area heaters and overhead coiling doors at\n       warehouse; completed backfill at fuel diesel tanks; completed\n       wall insulation [          ] at MSGQ; completed two electrical\n       manholes; installed acoustic inclosure at water chillers;\n       completed utility shell, installed HVAC unit and duct work at\n       service CAC.\n\nJX 82 at 1 (May OBO Project Director’s Monthly Progress Report). The\nfollowing activities were ongoing:\n\n       sealing between exterio[r] stone panels, removing mold damage\n       GWB and plywood in NOB; vacuum cleaning and wet wiping\n       throughout NOB building; installing GWB and plywood\n       throughout NOB north 2nd floor; plastering and painting walls\n       at NOB south 1st floor; installing HVAC ducts at NOB 4th\n       floor; installing studs for internal spaces at service CAC sally\n       port area; installing rebar for delta barrier at service CAC . . . .\n\n\n\n37\n  (...continued)\ncontract, which in this case amounted to $2,169,521.50. FAR 52.232-5(e)\n(2003).\n\n                                       65\n\fJX 82 at 1.\n\n        There is other credible evidence, however, that the progress reports\nwere inaccurate, and that more than 9% of the work remained. Eric Rumpf,\nwho was OBO’s Branch Chief for the Europe and Eurasian Construction and\nCommissioning Division, traveled to Dushanbe to assess the project status at\nthe end of June 2005, after KI’s termination. Mr. Rumpf testified that the\nproject was not nearly complete: there was still work left to be done on the\ncentral utility building, which connected the other buildings with utilities,38\nthere was no landscaping, the roads and sidewalks were not complete, twenty\npercent of the protective perimeter wall was not finished, the buildings were\nstill missing some exterior facade, there was still work left to be done in the\ninteriors of the buildings owing to the mold mediation measures, there was still\nmold and water damage in the Marine Security Guard Quarters that required\na “major overhaul,” PDI’s work within the CAA had not concluded, and there\nwere a few windows that still needed to be installed. Tr. 81-100.\n\nV.     Bankruptcy\n\n        On October 17, 2005, KI filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Kullman recalled\nthat, “even when I did go bankrupt, every job that I was working on, those\nclients all got their buildings. . . . The only client that didn’t get a completed\nbuilding was the State Department. And why? Because I was terminated.”\nTr. 1528. During the same time frame, DOS was seeking to debar KI.\n\n      The Trustee in Bankruptcy filed her complaint here on June 16, 2006.\nThe government counterclaimed on June 19, 2007.\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\n       Trying a default termination frequently takes on the character of a\njuridical autopsy, an after-the-fact effort to determine what went wrong and\nwho was responsible. The autopsy we are called on to perform here is\nparticularly poignant, given that, at the end of the day, a successful, family\nowned business no longer exists. We have no doubt that KI undertook the\ncontract to build the embassy in Dushanbe fully capable of completing it and\n\n\n38\n   Although the internal utilities connections between buildings were not yet\nfinished, the only utility that was available on site at the time of termination\nwas water. The government had not yet fulfilled its obligation to provide\nexternal sources of electricity and telecommunications.\n\n                                       66\n\ffully intending to do so. We are also satisfied, however, that virtually all the\nproblems which arose and kept it from completing the work can be traced to\none mistake KI made early on and which continued to do mischief through the\nfollowing two years: KI’s misunderstanding of the effect of M002.\n\n        Ultimately it was KI’s self deception concerning what it had agreed to\ndo, and at what price, that launched contract performance onto a doomed\ntrajectory. As we will see below, KI bound itself to perform all the work,\nincluding the geotechnical aspects, at a fixed price. Its willingness to hazard\nthe contract was prompted by an unwarranted assumption that it could ask for\nmore money if the geotechnical aspects of the foundation proved to be\ndifficult. That mistake was then compounded by its subsequent reliance on\nerroneous advice about the difficulty of preparing the foundation, leading it to\nspend, unnecessarily as it turned out, far more than it budgeted for\ngeotechnical work. The combination of those two mistakes, neither of which\ncan be shifted to the government, put KI over budget and behind schedule\nvirtually from the beginning and ultimately accounts for the default\ntermination.\n\n       The fact, for example, that what should have been the routine, bilateral\ndevelopment of a schedule of values to trigger progress payments became\nimpossible to establish with accuracy. In order for KI to develop cash flow up\nfront, it became necessary for the parties to collude on a disingenuous\nschedule, postponing the inevitable collision of that contrived schedule with\nthe reality of more remaining work than remaining money. That, in turn,\nprompted KI’s inability to keep up with payments to its subcontractors. KI’s\nmisguided REA also triggered the government’s belief that KI was attempting\nto perpetrate a fraud. Our evaluation must begin, therefore, with the contract\nnegotiations over price and the subsequent disagreement over who was\nresponsible to pay for the geotechnical work.\n\nI.     The Geotechnical Claim\n\n       Plaintiff’s geotechnical claim is difficult for the court to classify. On\noccasions it appears to be a differing site condition claim for unusual soil\nconditions. Occasionally it is presented as a straight contract claim. I.e., that\nthe parties agreed to also pay KI whatever it took to complete the foundation\nwork. It has been presented as a species of bad faith breach of contract claim\nor an argument that the government is estopped from denying that it owes KI\nmore than the fixed price of the contract. In whatever form it is argued,\nhowever, there can be only one outcome. The claim fails because a literal\n\n\n                                       67\n\freading of the contract plainly supports defendant’s contention that plaintiff\nassumed the risk for how much the geotechnical and foundation work would\ncost when it agreed to a fixed price. The facts set out above demonstrate that\nthe contract obligated KI to perform all the work, including the foundation, at\nthat price.\n\n       The parties did not, contrary to plaintiff’s argument, reserve for a later\nday a full reckoning on the price for geotechnical work. It may well be the\ncase that Messrs. Lefkus, Rand and Kullman believed that they had negotiated\nsuch a reservation, but it does not appear in writing. In fact, the written\nevidence is that what KI representatives assumed was in effect an allowance\nfor geotechnical work was merely the agency’s recognition that, only if KI\ncould establish a differing site condition due to unusual soil condition would\nthe agency have to face additional cost. Even assuming Mr. Lefkus knew that\nMr. Sutherland had set aside up to $2,000,000 for a possible differing site\ncondition claim, he was wrong to leap to the conclusion that the agency would\nnot contest it.\n\n        Nor is there any support for KI’s argument that Mr. Sutherland or others\nin DOS knew that KI was operating under the false impression that any work\nbeyond “standard” foundations was not included in the original contract, and\nthat this reflected a cynicism bordering on bad faith. KI asserts that it signed\nM004 and performed the geotechnical work in reliance on the agency’s\npurposeful silence and misleading actions indicating that the geotechnical\nwork would be paid for through a request for equitable adjustment: “DOS\nundertook the conduct with the intention of having Kullman believe DOS was\nin agreement with Kullman’s view of the Geotech [issue] to ensure the\nexecution of Mod 4.” Pl’s. Post-Trial Br. 17.\n\n        We disagree. Plaintiff has the obligation to prove that agency\nrepresentatives affirmatively misled it. See Zacharin v. United States, 213\nF.3d 1366, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Mr. Sutherland can be charged with\nknowing that KI did not want to include geotechnical within a fixed price\ncontract, but he and others made it as plain as they could that the agency would\nnot agree to those terms. It would only hold out the possibility of entertaining\na differing site condition claim at a later date. Although Mr. Lefkus may be\na good salesman, and Mr. Kullman is unquestionably a first class manufacturer\nand businessman, both gentlemen were naive in their negotiations with Mr.\nSutherland and in not taking him at his word.\n\n       We recognize that Mr. Sutherland and other DOS contracting\n\n\n                                       68\n\femployees were eager, indeed desperate, to close the deal on a fixed price\ncontract before September 30, 2002. And they may have welcomed KI’s\nnaivete in agreeing to take on the risk that it could perform at a profit. None\nof that amounts to bad faith, however, or grounds for concluding that there was\nno meeting of the minds. Either there was a differing site condition or there\nwas not. If there was, KI would be entitled to an equitable adjustment whether\nthe agency agreed to one or not. If there was not a differing site condition,\nthen the fact that Mr. Sutherland held out the possibility of KI attempting to\nprove one does not mean that KI is entitled to an equitable adjustment without\nproving a differing site condition.\n\n        It is ironic, and indeed tragic, that the SANIIOSP report prompted\nplaintiff to invest millions in what probably was over-engineering with respect\nto the foundation work. But KI’s own experts came to the same conclusion\nand the result was investment in an elaborate watering/compaction/de-watering\nscheme, which appears to have been unnecessary. The fact that the extra work\nwas undertaken at all precludes the argument that the possibility of soil\nsubsidence was unknown to KI. The fact that it was probably unnecessary also\nmeans that there was not a differing site condition.\n\n        Nor can the government be held responsible for any possible alarmist\nlanguage in the SANIIOSP report because the contract put the burden of site\ninvestigation on plaintiff and its expert. The fact that plaintiff had little time\nto do a thorough investigation is also unavailing, as M002 was negotiated after\nKI had been given the opportunity to conduct its own investigation. If plaintiff\nhad been concerned that it was being pressed into making a premature\ndecision, it had the option of simply not agreeing to the government’s terms,\nunpalatable as that might have appeared at the time.\n\n         The fact that the schedule of values was amended to include more\nmoney for geotechnical work does not constitute a waiver by the government\nof its right to objectively assess whether there was a differing site condition.\nIt is certainly clear that the agency consented to moving money from\ntransportation to geotechnical work, but that was done to keep the project\nmoving, not by way of an agreement in advance to a differing site condition\nclaim.39 The phrase, “no good deed will go unpunished,” comes to mind.\n\n\n39\n  We therefore attach no significance to the testimony of Mr. Powell, who\nsigned the REA denial as CO. He was asked at trial whether he was aware that\nthe schedule of values had been amended to include geotechnical work or\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                       69\n\f        We will not venture to estimate the number of DOS offices that had a\nrole in the formation or administration of this contract, much less the number\nof individuals involved. So it is ironic that not enough of the many DOS\nemployees who had a role in this contract appreciated the implications of the\nshift of funds from transportation to geotechnical work. Lack of the most\nbasic communication on this score triggered a wholly unwarranted fraud\ninvestigation by DOS’ contracting office against KI. The REA, of course, was\nbased on the assertion of extra-contractual work on a differing site condition.\nThe shift of funds within the budgeted total contract amount, however, was\npredicated on the contrary assumption that the work paid for was part of the\ncontract. Plaintiff can be forgiven for ignoring the obvious inconsistency; it\nwas desperate to keep up the cash flow, and it did not hold itself out as\nknowledgeable about contracting niceties. The same cannot be said of the\nagency’s employees. Mr. Sawyer leapt to the conclusion that the inconsistency\ncould only be explained by fraud, without, apparently, ever contemplating the\nobvious implications of the contracting officer’s acquiescence to moving funds\naround. That no one with knowledge of the facts had the common sense to\nintercept this juggernaut is distressing. We hasten to point out, however, that\nthis is not the fraudulent conduct that the government still asserts, which is\ndiscussed below.\n\n       In sum, plaintiff was contractually bound to perform all the\ngeotechnical work for the original fixed price. And none of the agency’s\nconduct surrounding the geotechnical issue gave rise to a new contract or\ngrounds for revoking or supplementing the old contract, nor do they constitute\nbad faith.\n\nII.    Whether the pay certification on invoices 13386, 13442, 13493, 13561,\n       and 13647 was false.\n\n      In its counterclaims, the government asserts that KI fraudulently\nsubmitted invoices for payment which included false information.\n\n\n39\n  (...continued)\nwhether he was aware of the internal communications regarding a $2 million\ncontingency being reserved for geotechnical work. If he had been informed\nof the reserved contingency, Mr. Powell said that “[i]t would have been taken\ninto consideration.” Tr. 4680. Even if there had been a “contingency” in the\nevent an REA was advanced, payment for an equitable adjustment would\ndepend on whether there actually was a differing site condition. There was\nnot.\n\n                                      70\n\fSpecifically, the government alleges that KI falsely certified in invoices 13386,\n13442, 13493, 13561, and 13647 that\n\n       (2) All payments due to subcontractors and suppliers from\n       previous payments received under the contract have been made,\n       and timely payments will be made from the proceeds of the\n       payment covered by this certification, in accordance with\n       subcontract agreements and the requirements of chapter 39 of\n       Title 31, United States Code; [and] (3) this request for progress\n       payments does not include any amounts which the prime\n       contractor intends to withhold or retain from a subcontractor or\n       supplier in accordance with the terms and conditions of the\n       subcontract.\n\nJt. Stip. ¶ 42. The certification was false, according to the government because\nKI knew that, at least with respect to one supplier, Belcor, KI had been paid\nby the government for all that Belcor had supplied, but KI had not in fact paid\nBelcor all that it was owed. The government interprets this certification to\nmean that KI warranted that it had paid each subcontractor and supplier in full\nfor all work completed in the past and would timely pay them in full for work\ncompleted during the pay period for which it submitted each invoice.\n\n        Plaintiff argues that the certification could reasonably be interpreted as\nmeaning that KI had paid its subcontractors and suppliers as much as it could\nof the amounts due under the subcontract agreements, or, alternatively, that KI\ncould make the certification so long as it had some understanding with the\nsuppliers about paying amounts due over time. This is, in fact, the meaning\nthat Mr. Rand ascribed to the certification when he signed it.\n\n        We find the following from the facts set out earlier in this opinion.\nFirst, defendant is correct that KI certified something that was not true. Belcor\nprovided $180,236.03 worth of supplies40 which were included in line item\nSTF 1074 for $435,074. The government paid KI $217,537 (half of the value\nof the line item) on October 14, 2004, under Invoice No. 13220 and $217,537\n(the remaining half) on January 6, 2005, under Invoice No. 13386. There is\nno question that KI never fully paid Belcor for those materials despite having\nbeen reimbursed in full for the amounts billed. In certifying in subsequent\ninvoices that all payments due to subcontractors and suppliers from earlier\n\n\n40\n STF 1074 was earmarked for “Fab Fuel tanks, piping & ship to port” and\nBelcor supplied prefabricated fuel tanks and other related accessories.\n\n                                       71\n\finvoice payments have been made, Mr. Rand must have known that statement\nto be inaccurate.41\n\n        KI responds that defendant’s assertion of fraud ignores the larger\ncontext of the financial issues attributable to the Dushanbe project. The fact\nthat plaintiff was having financial difficulties does not vitiate the inaccuracy\nof the statement, however. DOS and KI did not specifically agree to waive the\nterms of the certification, and we reject the notion that Belcor agreed to a\n“payment” plan under the terms of which KI was not actually in arrears to\nBelcor.\n\n        In fairness to Mr. Rand, however, we find that he did not mean to\ndeceive the government. He says, and we believe him, that he thought it was\nperfectly appropriate to do triage with limited funds by paying whatever\nsuppliers could be paid or whichever ones could be minimally satisfied with\na partial payment. One hundred percent of the proceeds of those invoices went\nto placate suppliers, and thus he was willing to sign the certification. We\nconclude that this nuanced interpretation does not, however, overcome its clear\ninaccuracy. We remain persuaded that he should have known the statement\nwas inaccurate and should not have signed it.42\n\n       The government asserts that these facts warrant two types of fraud\ndefenses. The first is premised on the Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act,\n28 U.S.C. § 2514 (2006) (“FFCA”). Under the FFCA, a claim against the\nUnited States is forfeited if there is fraud in the proof, statement, establishment\nor allowance of it. The government argues that Mr. Rand’s certifications are\nfraudulent within the meaning of the FFCA and result in the forfeiture of KI’s\naffirmative claims.\n\n       To prevail under this statute, defendant must prove “‘by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the contractor knew that its submitted claims were\nfalse, and that [the contractor] intended to defraud the government by\nsubmitting those claims.’” Daewoo Eng’g and Const. Co. v. United States, 557\n\n\n41\n  As of June 2005, KI still owed Belcor $60,869.87 even though KI had\nreceived all of the funds for STF 1074 by January 6, 2005.\n42\n   Defendant asserts that the administrative agency’s decision to disbar KI\nbecause “Kullman’s certifications were not accurate,” JX 1249, bars the court\nfrom coming to a different finding here. We need not consider the parties’\narguments on collateral estoppel. We agree with the finding.\n\n                                        72\n\fF.3d 1332, 1341 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (quoting Commercial Contractors, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 154 F.3d 1357, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 1998)). Mere negligence or\nineptitude does not clear the government’s hurdle of establishing clear and\nconvincing evidence of intent to defraud. Veridyne, Corp. v. United States,\n105 Fed. Cl. 769, 801 (2012) (citing Miller v. United States, 550 F.2d 17, 22\n(Ct. Cl. 1977)).\n\n       The Federal Circuit recently addressed the scope of 28 U.S.C. § 2514\nin Kellogg Brown & Root Services, Inc. v. United States, 728 F.3d 1348, 1366\n(Fed. Cir. 2013). After examining the statutory context of the provision, the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that “the forfeiture statute is best understood as\na companion requirement of claims procedure rather than a catch-all anti-fraud\nprovision.” Id. It wrote, “On its face, the statute is limited to those\ncircumstances where the Government proves fraud ‘in the proof, statement,\nestablishment or allowance’ of a claim at the Court of Federal Claims, not in\nthe execution of a contract.” Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2514) (rejecting Court\nof Federal Claims decisions which had read the statute to include fraud\npracticed during contract performance).\n\n        Defendant recognizes that this interpretation makes liability under the\nFFCA problematic here. KI has taken some pains to explain the circumstances\nof the certifications in the court proceedings. No fraud is being perpetrated on\nthe court. There was certainly no effort to hide the facts or claim entitlement\nunder a literal reading of the certifications. We conclude that plaintiff’s claims\ncannot be forfeited under the FFCA.\n\n       The government also seeks a statutory penalty under the False Claims\nAct (“FCA”), which provides the following:\n\n       [A]ny person who –\n                (A) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false\n       or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;\n                (B) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used,\n       a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent\n       claim;\n                ....\n                (G) . . . is liable to the United States Government for a\n       civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000\n       . . . plus 3 times the amount of damages which the Government\n       sustains because of the act of that person.\n\n\n\n                                       73\n\f31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1) (2006). Under current regulations, the range of the fine\nis increased to $5,500 to $11,000. 28 C.F.R. § 85.3(a)(9) (2014).\n\n       To establish KI’s liability under the FCA, the government must prove\nby a preponderance of the evidence, Daewoo, 557 F.3d at 1340, that “(1) the\ncontractor presented or caused to be presented to an agent of the United States\na claim for payment; (2) the claim was false or fraudulent; [and] (3) the\ncontractor knew the claim was false or fraudulent.”43 Young-Montenay, Inc.\nv. United States, 15 F.3d 1040, 1043 (Fed. Cir. 1994). The government has\n“the burden to allege and prove that the statements were false under any\nreasonable interpretation.” United States v. Adler, 623 F.2d 1287, 1289 (8th\nCir. 1980).\n\n        While the FCA does not require proof of specific intent to defraud, it\ndoes require that the person or entity acted with knowledge. 31 U.S.C. §\n3729(b). The statute defines “knowing” or “knowingly” to “mean that a\nperson” “with actual knowledge of the information” either “acts in deliberate\nignorance of the truth or falsity of the information” or “acts in reckless\ndisregard of the truth or falsity of the information.” Id. The requisite scienter\nin a FCA claim is present in “not just those who set out to defraud the\ngovernment, but also those who ignore obvious deficiencies in a claim.” Gulf\nGroup Enters. Co. v. United States, 114 Fed. Cl. 258, 314 (2013). “An\ninnocent mistake or mere negligence,” however, is not enough to trigger FCA\nliability. Id. at 316. It is reckless when a company submits a request for\npayment that had not first been reviewed. United States v. Krizek, 111 F.3d\n934, 942 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\n       As we explain above, we find that Mr. Rand should have known that\nwhat he was certifying was false. The fact that he thought it was accurate\nunder a strained view of the circumstances does not make it any less false in\nthe sense meant by the statute.\n\n        KI contends that there could have been no reliance by the agency on the\ncertifications because the contracting officer and others were aware of KI’s\nfinancial distress. Relevant individuals within DOS plainly were aware that\n\n\n43\n   The government only seeks the statutory penalty and is not therefore\nrequired to show actual injury or damages. See Veridyne, 105 Fed. Cl. at 808\n(“To bring an FCA claim, the Government is not tasked to show that it\nincurred damages, although a showing of damages as a result of the fraudulent\nclaim is required if the Government seeks to recover damages.”).\n\n                                       74\n\fKI was in financial distress, and some had reason to know that KI was not\npaying all its suppliers. The question is whether that fact has any mitigating\nlegal effect.\n\n        The Federal Circuit has not spoken to the question of when government\nknowledge of the circumstances behind an alleged fraud vitiates the fraud. A\nnumber of other courts have spoken to the issue, however.44 The consensus of\nthose courts appears to be that the government must have full knowledge of\nthe particular fraud, which can, in some circumstances, show that the claimant\n“did not submit its claim in deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the\ntruth.” United States ex rel. Hagood v. Sonoma Cnty. Water Agency, 929 F.2d\n1416, 1421 (9th Cir. 1991).\n\n       Accepting that rationale and applying it to the present facts does not\nhelp KI. While the relevant government officials were aware that KI was in\nfinancial distress, and Ms. Lowther must have been aware of the possibility in\nJanuary of 2005 that KI was not making full payments to some suppliers and\nsubcontractors, including Belcor, we are persuaded that she did not specifically\nknow that the certifications submitted later in the Spring of 2005 were not\ncorrect with respect to Belcor. Although Mr. Lowther heard from Mr. Bell in\n\n\n44\n   See generally, “The Government Knowledge Defense To The Civil False\nClaims Act: A Misnomer By Any Other Name Does Not Sound As Sweet,” 45\nIdaho L. Rev. 41 (2008) (The vast majority of cases have determined that\ngovernment knowledge is not an absolute defense to an FCA action. . . . The\nsignificance of the government’s knowledge is determined on a case by case\nbasis.”). “The knowledge possessed by officials of the United States may be\n. . . relevant . . . [to] show that the defendant did not submit its claim in\ndeliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the truth.” United States, ex rel.\nHagood v. Sonoma County Water Agency, 929 F.2d 1416, 1421 (9th Cir.\n1991). The Ninth Circuit’s decision in Hagood has been cited and followed\nin the Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits, as well as by this court and\nnumerous other district courts. E.g., United States ex rel. Kriendler &\nKriendler v. United Techs. Corp., 985 F.2d 1148, 1156 (2d. Cir. 1993); Varljen\nv. Cleveland Gear Co., 250 F.3d 426, 430 (6th Cir. 2001); United States ex rel.\nDurcholz v. FKW, Inc., 189 F.3d 542, 544-45 (7th Cir. 1999); Shaw v. AAA\nEng’g & Drafting, Inc., 213 F.3d 519, 543 (10th Cir. 2000); Tyger Constr. Co.\nv. United States, 28 Fed. Cl. 35, 59 (1993); United States v. Fiske, 968 F.\nSupp. 1347, 1352 (E.D. Ark. 1997); X Corp. v. Doe, 816 F. Supp. 1086, 1094\n(E.D. Va. 1993).\n\n\n                                      75\n\fJanuary 2005 that KI was in arrears, Ms. Lowther did not have first hand\nknowledge of the situation. When she sent KI a letter requesting a response\nto the accusations being made by Belcor, KI never responded. Without being\ninformed of KI’s position on the issue, Ms. Lowther did not know whether KI\nwas within its rights to withhold funds pursuant to the terms of the subcontract\nor whether KI was, in fact, unjustifiably behind in its payments to Belcor. She\nperhaps could have guessed the certifications were inaccurate, but we believe\nthat for government knowledge to vitiate fraud, it must approach something\nlike specific consent or an agreed-upon interpretation of the terms of the\ncertification such that the parties agree that the certification does not mean\nwhat it otherwise appears to mean.45 Passivity or lack of inquisitiveness would\nnot vitiate the fraud.\n\n        In sum, we find that the five certifications from February through June\nwere inaccurate insofar as they asserted that Belcor had been fully paid and KI\nofficials should have known they were inaccurate. They were made with the\nintent to obtain payment from the agency and without concern as to whether\nthe agency understood the real facts. We conclude that KI is responsible for\nfive false certifications and award the government $27,500 on its counterclaim.\n\nIII.   Which party bore the responsibility for delays and additional costs\n       associated with construction of a secure part of the embassy\n\n        As explained above, the agency halted work on the NOB due to\nconcerns that portions of the CAA were being assembled from materials which\nhad not been built or shipped under secure controls. This decision was an\nartifact of the mutually agreed upon changes made to the CAA design due to\nKI’s inability to ship a module twelve feet high. The original plan called for\n\n\n45\n  See, e.g., United States ex rel. Ubl v. IIF Data Solutions, 650 F.3d 445, 453\n(4th Cir. 2011) (holding that the trial court properly admitted evidence of\nagency knowledge and approval of the contractor’s billing practices and\nstating, “[f]or example, if the government with full knowledge of the relevant\nfacts directed a contractor to file a claim that was later challenged as false, the\nfact that the contractor did what the government told it to do would go a long\nway towards establishing that the contractor did not knowingly file a claim\nknown to be false.”); United States ex rel. Becker v. Westinghouse Savannah\nRiver Co., 305 F.3d 284, 288 (4th Cir. 2002) (holding that the agency’s\ndirection to the contractor to change budgeting and reporting codes vitiated\nany FCA liability because the agency colluded with the contractor in the\nfalsehood).\n\n                                        76\n\fthe unsecure fourth floor utility space to be built of metal panels on top of the\nenclosed third floor CAA. The parties agreed to a fix that turned the third\nfloor modules at that point into five rather than six-sided boxes. The secure\nportion of the third floor was built and shipped in a secure manner, but it had\nno heavy metal roof. Because the additional two feet of space in the third floor\nwas generated by welding two feet to the fourth-floor floor panel, the lid to the\n“shoebox” was integrated into the unsecure fourth floor design.\n\n        Plaintiff asserts that DOS required KI to undertake security mitigation\nefforts that were not part of the agreed upon statement of work at its own\nexpense. It seeks compensation for extra work and material beyond the scope\nof the contract. It also contends that the delay caused the NOB to remain open\nto rain, which resulted in the need to do substantial mold remediation. KI was\nrequired to replace drywall and insulation in certain areas of the NOB. It\nargues that, if DOS had allowed Kullman to install the fourth floor panels\nwhen they first arrived on site, most, if not all, of the mold remediation effort\nat the NOB would have been unnecessary. There is no claim for mold\nremediation in any building other than the NOB.\n\n        The panels were not manufactured or shipped securely. It was only\nafter the panels arrived in Dushanbe and six had been installed that the CO\nnotified KI on August 20, 2004, that the panels could not be used because they\nhad not been shipped securely. There is no question that DOS halted work and\nordered KI to invest substantial time and money in retroactively determining\nwhether the CAA space, including the fourth-floor floor panels, was safe. The\nquestion the court must answer is whether the contract required secure\nconstruction and shipment of the floor panels of the fourth floor because they\nbecame the roof of the secure space below. If not, then the agency ordered a\nconstructive change under the contract’s changes clause.\n\n       KI prepared and DOS approved a classified list of items that were to be\nmanufactured and shipped securely. Both parties had a copy of the list. KI’s\ncopy of the list was kept in the safe and returned to the government when the\ncontract terminated. Mr. Algire, Site Security Manager in Dushanbe, had a\ncopy of the list. Thus, there can be no doubt there was a list that indicated\nwhat components were required to be shipped securely. Messrs. Algire and\nLefkus testified that the fourth-floor floor panels were not on the secure\nshipping list. This makes sense, because otherwise Mr. Algire would not have\nalerted DOS in Washington to the problem. We also draw an inference against\nthe government for its failure to produce the list at trial.\n\n\n\n                                       77\n\f         The fact that the components of the fourth floor were not on the secure\nlist is also made likely by the way modifications were made to the height of the\nCAA modules. It appears that when the parties agreed on a design to separate\nthe lower part of the CAA box modules from their tops by making the tops part\nof the fourth-floor floor panels, the need to maintain the identity of the roof\npanels with the third floor secure space was simply ignored. The government\nseeks to shift to KI the responsibility for that mistake.\n\n       The government gives the following interpretation of events:\n\n              Prior to the presentation of Kullman’s solution, the\n       fourth-floor floor panels did not form a physical barrier to the\n       NOB’s CAA space, so they were not designated as secure.\n       However, Kullman’s solution made the fourth-floor floor panels\n       serve double-duty, both as flooring panels for the fourth-floor\n       mechanical space (non-secure), and as the uppermost physical\n       barrier of the CAA space (secure).\n\n              At the November 6, 2003 meeting, Kullman did not raise\n       any issues related to the manufacture or transportation of the\n       fourth-floor floor panels in light of Kullman’s proposed\n       “shoebox” solution. During that meeting, however – and even\n       though neither party expressly discussed it with the other – both\n       Kullman and the DOS generally understood that material\n       designations as “secure” or “non-secure” were assigned prior to\n       the fabrication stage and subsequently governed the treatment of\n       the designated material at all stages of the project. However,\n       Kullman did not communicate that, as of November 2003, it had\n       already completed the (non-secure) fabrication of the fourth-\n       floor floor panels that it had now proposed to use as the\n       uppermost physical barrier for the third-floor CAA space.\n\nDef.’s Post-Trial Br. 24 (citations omitted). We find no factual support for the\nassertion that KI understood that the prior designation of the CAA box as\nsecure meant that the designation carried forward to the fourth floor redesign.\nThis argument assumes that it was KI’s responsibility to unilaterally change\nthe design, security designations, manufacturing plans, and transportation\nplans to adjust for the redesign. It was the agency which had the primary\nresponsibility for protecting itself and for establishing a security plan that the\ncontractor could follow. If DOS wanted the fourth-floor floor panels\nmanufactured and shipped securely, it should have identified the issue when\n\n\n                                       78\n\fthe modifications were being discussed. The factual recitation earlier in this\nopinion reflects the confusion within the agency itself concerning how to\ncharacterize the transition zone between the third and fourth floor.\n\n        In addition, the agency’s actions in July 2004 bear out the lack of\ndefinite orders to KI in terms of secure construction of the floor of the\nmechanical space. On July 12, 2004, Mr. Algire e-mailed Mr. Little, Mr.\nAlgire’s Desk Officer within OBO, and Charles Kuehne, team leader for\nsecurity procedures at DOS: “As there are no more secure shipments, that I\nam aware of, how is this stuff getting here[?] . . . Is the fourth floor south wing\nnot CAA, just contiguous with the CAA?” JX 541 at 13. The jumbled\nresponses from several quarters to that inquiry illustrates the lack of clarity\nwithin the agency on how to treat the materials in question. It is hardly\nsurprising that KI assumed that none of the fourth floor mechanical space had\nto be treated as part of the secure construction protocol. Accordingly, we find\nthat DOS issued a constructive change order when it halted construction and\ndirected KI to undertake measures to ensure the security of the panels which\nbecame the ceiling of the third floor and the floor of the fourth floor.\n\n        It follows from this that the delay in closing the building to the elements\nmust be assigned to the agency. KI was instructed on August 20, 2004, to\ncease installing panels pending the inspection that occurred in late September.\nIt was not released to continue its panel installation work until September 28.\nThe fourth-floor floor panels were fully installed by October 20.46 We find\nthat the delay resulted in an inability to timely weatherproof the NOB and\ncontributed to the growth of mold and hence the need for mold remediation.\nWhile the government presented evidence that mold was a ubiquitous problem\nat the site and not unique to the NOB after the delay commenced, the evidence\nis overwhelming that the problems at the NOB were much more extensive and\nmost likely dramatically exacerbated by KI’s inability to continue work on the\n\n\n46\n  Defendant contends that there was a delay in completing installation of the\npanels when a crane needed to hoist panels along one side could not be placed\npromptly because there was an insufficient foundation on which to place it.\nAlthough this is a disputed issue, we find plaintiff’s evidence more credible on\nthis question. We have the testimony of Mr. Allen, KI’s on site superintendent\nthat the area around the foundation of the south end of the NOB was fully in\nplace when KI began installing panels on the fourth floor. The crane had to\nbe securely placed, in other words, for any work to take place at that end of the\nbuilding. We suspect that Mr. Farley’s notes to the contrary probably reflect\nthe situation at the north end of the NOB.\n\n                                        79\n\ffourth floor just prior to the rainy period. The fact that rains did not start in\nearnest until November does not cut against KI’s claim, because merely\ncompleting the installation of fourth floor panels did not seal the building.\n\n        Defendant did establish that there were KI-caused problems with\ncompletely sealing the building after the fourth floor was assembled and that\nsome modules arrived with mold already in place, but these factors would not\nvitiate the entire claim. KI’s claim isolates costs associated with remediation\nonly at the NOB and then reduces that amount by 25% to account for\nremediation that may have been otherwise necessary. The question is thus,\nwhether 25% is a fair estimate of KI’s share of the blame for mold problems.\nWe find that it is. The bulk of the costs associated with remediation involved\nwholesale removal and replacement of gypsum board throughout the building.\nThe government did not seriously question the legitimacy of the efforts that KI\nundertook to remedy the mold damage and we conclude that 75% of actual\nexpenses is a fair estimate.\n\n        Accordingly, KI is entitled to recover all of its costs associated with\nafter-the-fact security inspections and repairs and 75% of its costs associated\nwith mold remediation. We reserve calculation of the precise amount to which\nKI is entitled.\n\nIV.    Whether the termination for default was justified.\n\n        The government must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the\ndecision to terminate for default was justified.47 McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\nUnited States, 182 F.3d 1319, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (citing Lisbon\nContractors, Inc. v. United States, 828 F.2d 759, 765 (Fed. Cir. 1987)). It is\nparticularly relevant here that the government is not limited to the reasons\nstated in the cure notice, but may rely on any rationale justifying the default\ntermination decision based in facts that existed at the time of termination.\nEmpire Energy Mgmt. Sys. Inc. v. Roche, 362 F.3d 1343, 1357 (Fed. Cir.\n2004); Joseph Morton Co. v. United States, 757 F.2d 1273, 1277 (Fed. Cir.\n1985) (“This court sustains a default termination if justified by circumstances\nat the time of termination, regardless of whether the Government originally\n\n\n47\n  We do not evaluate the CO’s termination for default decision with deference\nbecause “it is well-settled that the Court of Federal Claims reviews the\ndecision to terminate a contractor for default de novo.” McDonnell Douglas\nCorp. v. United States, 323 F.3d 1006, 1018 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (citing Wilner\nv. United States, 24 F.3d 1397, 1401 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (en banc)).\n\n                                       80\n\fremoved the contractor for another reason.”). Under the FAR, the government\nmay terminate a contract for default when, after a 10-day period for the\ncontractor to address the deficiencies stated in the cure notice, the contractor\nhas failed to “[p]rosecute the work so as to endanger performance of [the]\ncontract.” FAR 52.249-9(a) (2014). The CO is justified in concluding that the\ncontractor failed to prosecute the work if he or she reasonably believed that\n“‘there was no reasonable likelihood that the contractor could perform the\nentire contract effort within the time remaining for contract performance.’”\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States, 323 F.3d 1006, 1016 (Fed. Cir.\n2003) (quoting Lisbon, 828 F.2d at 765).\n\n        The completion date for the contract was June 20, 2004. The parties\nwent well beyond that date, however, and a new substantial completion date\nwas never formally established. In the May 21, 2005 Cure Notice, the CO\nwrites, “The Government still anticipates substantial completion by September\n1, 2005.” JX 1027 at 2. The source of that substantial completion date is a\nmystery, but it need not be solved. Although we find that the government\nwaived its right to insist upon the June 20, 2004 substantial completion\ndeadline, the facts concerning KI’s decision to leave the jobsite provide\nsufficient grounds for default termination.\n\n        In her termination notice of June 17, 2005, Ms. Lowther relied primarily\non the assertion that KI had walked off the job with no intention to return in\ntime to complete the work. We find that her interpretation of KI’s conduct is\ncorrect. We now have the benefit of even more information than was available\nto her at the time, making it clear beyond doubt that KI elected to cut its losses\nby abandoning the contract. We specifically reject plaintiff’s alternative\nexplanation that it was planning to return to the site. There is no question,\nmoreover, that even though most of the contract had been performed,\nsubstantial work remained. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. United States,\n567 F.3d 1340, 1350 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (rejecting a per se rule that the\ngovernment is never justified in terminating the contract for default in the\nabsence of a deadline for substantial completion and instead insisting that the\ntrial court conduct “an ad hoc, factual inquiry that allows careful examination\nand weighing of all relevant circumstances” pertaining to the termination),\nvacated on other grounds, Gen. Dynamics Corp. v. United States, 131 S. Ct.\n1900 (2011).\n\n       Termination for default is justified when the contractor abandons the\nproject while there is still work to be completed. M.C. & D. Capital Corp. v.\nUnited States, 948 F.2d 1251, 1256 (Fed. Cir. 1991) ((holding that the\n\n\n                                       81\n\fcontractor “breached the contract by abandoning the work and leaving the job\nsite prior to correcting deficiencies. The latter conduct itself justified the\ngovernment’s termination of the contract”); PCL Constr. Servs. Inc. v. United\nStates, 47 Fed. Cl. 745, 808 (2000) (“[A]bandoning work on a contract without\ncorrecting deficiencies . . . justifies termination for default.”); Appeal of Big\n3 Contracting Corp., ASBCA No. 20929, 79-1 BCA ¶ 13601, 1978 WL 2273\n(Nov. 15, 1978) (citing James E. Kennedy, Trustee v. United States, 164 Ct.\nCl. 507, 514 (1964)) (holding that contractor “absolutely repudiated the\ncontract” when it “left the job, removed its equipment and stated it would\nresume performance only upon a condition contrary to the requirements and\nnecessities of the contract”).\n\n        Accordingly, it is sufficient to sustain the termination for default to find\nthat KI abandoned the work. That it did so because of its financial distress is\nnot a defense. Nor would it be a defense if Ms. Lowther failed to consider\nKI’s explanations in response to each cure item and did not permit KI\nsufficient time to cure or to meet the September 1, 2005 date for substantial\ncompletion. The same is true of KI’s argument that it could not have\ncompleted if it wanted to because the government had failed to provide\npermanent power to the site as of the date of termination. We need not\nconsider these arguments because of the overwhelming evidence that KI\nabandoned the project. That fact alone trumps any possible shortcomings in\ncontract administration. See Appeal of Protective Coatings Co., ENGBCA No.\n3205, 72-1 B.C.A. (CCH) ¶ 9431 (Apr. 13, 1972) (fact that government made\nwork more difficult does not relieve contractor of obligation to continue to\nperform).\n\n       Although it is unnecessary to the result, we note as well that the false\npayment certifications would give us grounds for affirming the termination for\ndefault, even if that were not known to the agency at the time. See Lamb\nEng’g & Const. Co. v. United States, No. 01-225, 2002 WL 32933387 (Fed.\nCl. Aug. 26, 2002); see also Joseph Morton Co. v. United States, 757 F.2d\n1273, 1277-79 (Fed. Cir. 1985).\n\n        One final issue remains before the termination for default can be\nupheld. That concerns plaintiff’s assertion that agency employees acted with\nbad faith toward plaintiff. We have rejected that assertion in connection with\nthe formation of the contract. Although many of KI’s complaints about lack\nof cooperation, lack of civility, delay, etc. may be understandable, they do not\nreflect active bad faith so much as a poisoned working relationship which can\nbe traced to KI’s misunderstanding of what it had contractually obligated itself\n\n\n                                        82\n\fto do. We also credit the likelihood that the way DOS managed this contract\nlead to unnecessary friction. But the agency’s sometimes passive-aggressive\nmanagement style does not amount to bad faith sufficient to justify\nabandonment of the contract.\n\n       There was, however, one incident that warrants specific mention. That\nconcerns Ms. Lowther’s interference in KI’s attempt to borrow money from\nTatonka Capital. In the spring of 2005, after KI had failed to persuade DOS\nto release more retainage, it approached Tatonka Capital about borrowing\napproximately $2 million, to be secured by monies the government was\nretaining. According to Mr. Kullman, Tatonka had agreed in principle to loan\nKI the money, but backed out after Carol Hansen, Tatonka’s Chief Executive\nOfficer, had a conversation with Ms. Lowther. He testified that “Lorri told her\nthat my money was being held for retainage, that there was mold litigation\ngoing on, I was never going to get retainage, and, you know, things weren’t in\ntoo good shape.” Tr. 1823 (Kullman).\n\n        Ms. Lowther’s statements were not accurate. There was no mold\nlitigation going on and she never formally assessed liquidated damages. We\ndid not have the opportunity to explore Ms. Hansen’s decision with her at trial.\nShe was not a witness. Thus we do not know what Tatonka Capital would\nhave done if Ms. Lowther had limited herself to the literal truth: the work had\nbeen held up for months because of mold problems; the parties disputed who\nwas responsible for the mold; the contract allowed for liquidated damages;\nand, although liquidated damages had not yet been assessed, KI had been\nwarned that they might be assessed because the contract was nearly a year\nbeyond the original completion date. We do know that Ms. Hansen wrote a\nletter to Mr. Kullman indicating that “While Ms. Lowther confirmed the\nretainage amount you indicated, she stated that Kullman was involved with\nmold litigation and that liquidated damages would be assessed. While you\nmade us aware of the geotech claim, these undisclosed issues prevent us from\nmoving forward.” JX 1007 at 1.\n\n       There is no question, in other words, that Ms. Lowther’s comments\ninfluenced Tatonka’s decision. What we do not know is whether Ms. Hansen\nwould have backed off from making a loan if her knowledge was limited to\nwhat was true: namely, the contract was way behind schedule and KI and\nDOS were in the middle of serious performance disputes.\n\n       Every contract carries with it the mutual exchange of promises not to\ntreat the other party in bad faith. Because government employees are\n\n\n                                      83\n\fpresumed to act in good faith, however, proof of breach of the implied\ncovenant not to act in bad faith carries a heavy burden for a contractor. The\nburden can be met in circumstances, for example, in which government\nofficials act with specific intent to injure the other party, or by abusing the\ngovernment’s position to target the contract benefits negotiated between the\nparties. See Centex Corp. v. United States, 395 F.3d 1283, 1308-09 (Fed. Cir.\n2005).\n\n       We can credit the possibility that Ms. Lowther was angry at plaintiff\nand less than careful in her comments to Ms. Hansen. KI had complained so\nmuch about her performance as contracting officer that Ms. Lowther was\nreplaced for a time. See Tr. 505-06 (Lowther). Nor was she an impressive\nwitness at trial. She was frequently emotional and defensive. We assume that,\nsimilarly, she would not have reacted well to the tension created in\ncontemplating terminating a contract of this size for default and may well have\nresented KI’s continued efforts to get her to release funding. None of that\nallows us to presume that Ms. Lowther intended to injure KI, however.\nIndeed, we think it much more likely that she would have welcomed an outside\nlender injecting enough money into the contract to keep plaintiff on the job.\nWe find that the most likely explanation of her comments to Ms. Hansen was\ncarelessness.\n\n                              CONCLUSION\n\n       We conclude that KI cannot recover on its request for an equitable\nadjustment for the geotechnical work, that the government has proved its\nFalse Claims Act counterclaim, that the government has proved that the\ntermination for default was justified, and that plaintiff has proved that the\ncontract price must be adjusted to account for the constructive change order\nwith respect to the CAA. We reserve ruling on damages. The court will\ncontact the parties to arrange a status conference to address the damage\ncalculation and fraud counterclaim.\n\n\n                                           s/Eric G.

Publication was deferred\npending parties’ review for redaction of protected material. The court adopted\nthe parties’ suggested redaction, which is indicated by brackets, and made\nother minor editorial changes. The opinion is now prepared for release.\n\fBRUGGINK, Judge.\n\n        Before the court is a dispute involving a contract between the United\nStates, acting through the Department of State (“DOS”), and Kullman\nIndustries, Inc. (“KI”), a company now no longer in business, which at the\ntime specialized in large-scale modular construction. The contract obligated\nKI to build the United States Embassy compound in Dushanbe, Tajikistan.\nKullman Industries worked on the project for nearly three years and nearly\nbrought it to completion before the contract was terminated by DOS for\ndefault. KI went into bankruptcy, and the trustee in bankruptcy succeeded to\nits interests, although we will refer to KI rather than the trustee throughout.\n\n        KI advances three claims here: first, it challenges the agency’s\ntermination for default and seeks conversion to a termination for convenience;\nsecond, it advances a claim of approximately $4.3 million for geotechnical\nwork, which it contends was outside the terms of the contract; and it asserts a\nclaim of approximately $1 million with respect to additional security\nremediation and related mold and mildew mitigation. The government has\ncounterclaimed, asserting fraud and seeking both monetary penalties and\nforfeiture of KI’s claims. The court has jurisdiction to resolve plaintiff’s\nclaims under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978, 41 U.S.C. §§ 7101-7109\n(2012), and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1503, 2508 (2012), to adjudicate\ndefendant’s counterclaims.\n\n        The various affirmative and defensive claims were tried between April\nand June, 2013. The trial dealt with four issues: 1) whether a portion of the\ngeotechnical work was outside the scope of the contract; 2) whether the\ntermination for default was justified; 3) whether certain pay certifications were\nfalse; and 4) which party bore the responsibility for delays and additional costs\nassociated with construction of a secure part of the embassy. Post-trial briefs\nwere filed by both parties, and oral argument was heard on January 15, 2014,\nafter which supplemental briefs were filed. The matter is ready for final\ndisposition. For the following reasons, we find that the geotechnical work was\nwithin the scope of the contract, the termination for default was justified,\nplaintiff did not violate the Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act, although it\ndid violate the False Claims Act, and the government bears responsibility for\nthe delays and additional costs associated with the secure space. We reserve\nfor later resolution the question of damages.\n\n\n                                       2\n\f                             BACKGROUND\n\nI.     Kullman Industries\n\n        Kullman Industries was a family enterprise. The most recent President\nand CEO of KI was Robert Kullman, who featured prominently as a witness\nat trial and whose testimony we find to be credible. Mr. Kullman’s\ngrandfather founded Kullman Dining Car Company, Inc. in the 1920’s.\nKullman Dining Car Company successfully built and sold modular diners in\na way that was faster and more easily financed than traditional construction.\nThe company would fully construct the modular diner in its factory and then\ninstall it on the buyer’s property.\n\n        Over the years, that company expanded from production of small diners\nto 6,000-plus square foot restaurants. As a teenager, Robert Kullman got his\nstart in the family business by sweeping floors, painting, and working\ncarpentry jobs. After high school, Robert Kullman attended Bucknell\nUniversity. During the summers, he continued to work at Kullman Dining Car\nCompany. The day after he graduated from college, Robert Kullman joined\nthe family enterprise as Vice President.\n\n        In the 1970’s, when the market for diners began to wane, Robert\nKullman and his father jointly created Kullman Industries in an effort to\nbroaden production and grow the business. KI began using its modular\nmethod to construct bank branches, medical buildings, and schools. The\nbuildings became larger and more complicated. When cellular telephones\nwere in their infancy, KI got into market for building modular structures for\nthe telecommunications industry.\n\n       In the 1990’s, KI began working on projects for DOS. KI built the\nUnited States Embassies in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan; Ashgabat, Turkmenistan;\nand Bissau, Guinea-Bissau. Just before KI contracted to build the embassy in\nDushanbe, it was doing about $55 million dollars of business each year. Mr.\nKullman was the President and CEO of KI from the 1980’s until it was\ndissolved in bankruptcy.\n\nII.    The Dushanbe Project: Phase I\n\n       In light of its satisfactory performance of its previous contracts, the\nState Department began discussing with KI in April of 2002 the project to\n\n                                      3\n\fbuild a new embassy in Dushanbe, Tajikistan. According to the testimony of\nKI’s Chief Operating Officer, John Joseph Lefkus, III, DOS was interested in\npursuing modular construction for the Dushanbe Embassy because of the short\nperiod of time required for construction and installation when compared with\ntraditional construction and the added benefits to security when construction\nis controlled within a factory.\n\n       A.     Phase I - Design\n\n        Because of KI’s unique qualifications, on July 2, 2002, the Director and\nChief Operating Officer of DOS’s Overseas Building Operations (“OBO”),\nGeneral Charles E. Williams, agreed to use of a sole source contract with KI\nfor the Dushanbe project. The stated justification for using other than full and\nopen competition was that “Kullman Industries, Inc. offers a more direct way\nto contract, provides a superior product that meets DS[2] requirements, and, in\naddition, has greater experience in servicing the requirements of the\nDepartment.” JX 128 at 3. OBO anticipated a construction budget of\n$63,920,000.\n\n      The DOS Contracting Officer (“CO”) assigned to the Dushanbe project\nat that time was Ralph R. Sutherland. The Contracting Officer’s\nRepresentative (“COR”) was Robert H. Sanders. John Lefkus, KI’s Chief\nOperating Officer, represented KI in negotiations.\n\n        On July 12, 2002, DOS’s Office of Acquisitions issued solicitation\nSALMEC-02-C-0025 for “Phase I”3 to develop a plan for the adaptation of the\nstandard embassy design to accommodate modular construction and to\nfacilitate a cost estimate for the Dushanbe embassy. The embassy compound\nwas to include a New Office Building (“NOB”), also known as the chancery,\nthe Marine Security Guard Quarters, Warehouse, Compound Access Control\n(“CAC” or “gate house”) Building, Material Transfer Station, utility building,\npower plant, well water treatment system, septic system, and a perimeter wall\nfor the compound. The contractor would have 85 days to complete the Phase\nI design. The solicitation included over one hundred pages of contract details\n\n2\n Neither party has clarified what “DS” means. In the absence of a clear\ndefinition of this acronym, we presume it to refer to “Diplomatic Security.”\n3\n The project was divided into two phases. The first was the design phase and\nthe second phase consisted of construction.\n\n                                       4\n\fcovering everything from pricing to the Statement of Work (“SOW”) and\nreferenced additional attachments such as the Standard Embassy Design Intent\nApplication Manual (“SED manual”), the Site Utilization Plan, and a\nPreliminary Geotechnical Report. The SED manual included “the fixed design\nelements—the ‘absolutes’ that every project using the Standard Embassy\nDesign (SED) must follow.” JX 16 at 1, 4. Pursuant to the SED manual, some\nelements of the standard design were fixed while other elements could be\nadapted to fit the needs of each project.\n\n       The SED also provided specifications for a Controlled Access Area\n(“CAA”). The CAA was designed as a room within the embassy that contains\nspecial protections for information and occupants.\n\n       KI submitted its best and final offer for Phase I of the Dushanbe\ncontract on August 20, 2002. DOS accepted KI’s offer and issued the notice\nto proceed on August 22, 2002. JX 1 at 2. The contract for Phase I was not\nexecuted by Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Lefkus, however, until September 18,\n2002. On that same day, Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Lefkus also executed\nModification 001 (“M001”). M001 incorporated several attachments to\nDivision 1 of the contract and rescinded “Section J,” which included the\nDushanbe Geological Overview, and replaced it with “Section J, Revision 1.”4\n\n        While KI worked on Phase I, DOS commissioned the Committee of\nArchitecture and Building within the Province of the Government of the\nRepublic of Tajikistan (“SANIIOSP”) to survey, test, and develop a report on\nthe geotechnical conditions at potential sites for the project. SANIIOSP\nproduced a report (“geotechnical report” or “SANIIOSP report”), initially in\nRussian and then translated into English, on the geotechnical conditions at the\nsite that was eventually chosen for the Dushanbe project. The geotechnical\nreport, while perhaps difficult to read, alerted the reader to what the drafters\nthought were unusual soil conditions. It reflected that the “main deformation\ncharacteristics of the dusty clay soils, which consist of the sand clay and loamy\nsoils are the properties of the settlement while putting into the water and the\n\n\n4\n  In addition, M001 provided that “[t]he contractor’s proposal for Phase II of\nthe contract shall include costs to perform requirements described in the\ndocuments” newly incorporated by M001. JX 2 at 1. The contract for Phase\nI had a firm fixed-price of $1,025,000.00. Phase II construction of the\nEmbassy was not guaranteed after the completion of Phase I.\n\n                                       5\n\ffirst settlement pressure.” JX 10 at 9. Additionally, “[t]he summary quantity\nof the possible settlement of the soils because of their own weight can reach\n54.84cm with the power of the depth of settlement 16.7m.” JX 10 at 16.\nFurthermore, the report provided the following:\n\n       The experience of the exploitation of the buildings in the\n       analogous soil conditions on the territory of Dushanbe shows\n       that the increase of the moisture content of the soils inevitably\n       takes place while the engineering development of the territory\n       because of the break down of the natural regime of the expense\n       of the different factors (natural and anthropogene). These\n       changes make [worse] the deformation and strength properties\n       of the clay soils, the properties of the settlement take place, the\n       lack of the engineering preparation of the territory can lead to\n       the deformation of the buildings. . . . [I]t is recommended to do\n       the projection taking into consideration the full water satiation\n       of the clay soils.\n\nJX 10 at 15-16. The geotechnical report therefore recommended wetting “the\nsoil thickness up to the depth of 17m . . . .” JX 10 at 18-19.\n\n       KI teamed with the Louis Berger Group (“LBG”), which specializes in\ngeotechnical engineering, to address the issues involved in developing a\nfoundation appropriate to the natural conditions of the site. According to an\nAugust 30, 2002 memo, LBG “received a copy of the Geotechnical Report\nfrom OBO on August 16, 2002.” JX 135 at 1.5 On August 30, 2002, Vassilios\nMagginas, an architect with DOS, wrote in an e-mail that he had reviewed the\nSANIIOSP report and that it was “good, confirms our previous findings, and\ncontains the basic information to be used for the project.” JX 134 at 1.\n\n       B.     Site Visit\n\n       Phase I included a visit to potential construction sites in Dushanbe,\nTajikistan. KI’s representatives, including Mike Kosinski and Bob Airrika,\ntraveled to Dushanbe on September 10, 2002, to conduct a site visit and to\n\n\n5\n  Although there was a dispute at trial as to when KI or its representatives first\nsaw the SANIIOSP Report, we find that it was available to plaintiff before it\nprovided its late-September cost estimate.\n\n                                        6\n\fexplore local resources. According to the Contractor’s Trip Report (“Trip\nReport”) authored by KI, the site visit lasted until September 14, 2002. JX 137\nat 10. The KI representatives were joined by Michael “Mike” Ross, the\nContracting Officer’s Representative and Pete Stella from the government.6\nDuring a meeting that occurred on September 10, 2002, KI attendees were\ngiven a CD-ROM disc containing the “Section-J attachments from the RFQ.”\nJX 137 at 22. Pete Stella, Reese Richardson, John Smith, Mike Kosinski and\nBob Airikka met with the Director of SANIIOSP, Saidor Rakhmatullo, who\n“indicated that much of the information available for the site was already\nincluded in the geotech report they had prepared.” JX 137 at 9. Mr.\nRakhmatullo offered to provide additional services such as soil testing,\nsurveying, and designing, but told the meeting participants that SANIIOSP did\nnot have the necessary equipment to meet the standards set by the American\nSociety for Testing and Materials (“ASTM”). According to the meeting\nminutes, OBO was satisfied with the content of the SANIIOSP report. In the\nTrip Report, KI expressed general satisfaction with the information gathered\nduring the site visit and acknowledged that “OBO provided a geotechnical\nreport for the property prior to the site visit.” JX 137 at 3-4.\n\n       C.     Negotiations\n\n       Negotiations for Phase II, the separate contract to build the embassy,\nbegan in earnest promptly after the site visit ended. The key issue was price.\nOn September 20, 2002, Ralph Sutherland wrote the following to his superiors\nwithin OBO, Leroy Wallin, the Director of the Facilities Design and\nConstruction Division, and Patricia Regalo-Warren, the Branch Chief:\n\n       The contractor cannot currently provide an accurate cost\n       proposal for construction and is reluctant to enter into a GMP\n       contract at this point. . . . Assuming that the cost [that KI\n       proposes] is not too outrageous, we will work with the\n       contractor to establish mutually acceptable terms in determining\n       the mechanics of converting the construction portion of the\n       contract into a negotiated fixed price at the (approximate) 30%\n       design stage. The contract can be structured in a manner that\n       will obligate the money (using options for other means) for the\n\n\n6\n  Although Mr. Sutherland is listed as a team member in the trip report, he\ntestified that he was not in Dushanbe for the site visit.\n\n                                      7\n\f       construction phase of the project at the time of contract award.\n\nJX 138 at 1.\n\n        As of September 24, 2002, the government estimated that the Dushanbe\nEmbassy complex could be built for approximately $58,365,000. According\nto this estimate, the “substructure” or foundations for the NOB should cost\nabout $1,200,000. “SITEWORK - (EXCLUDING PERIMETER WALLS)”\nshowed a line item value of $2,750,000. JX 139 at 7. Site work included site\npreparation, improvements, civil and mechanical utilities, and electrical\nutilities. $12,700,000 was allocated for estimated transportation costs\nassociated with moving materials and personnel to the site.\n\n        On September 25, 2002, KI submitted its “Order of Magnitude Pricing”\nto the government. Plaintiff offered Contracting Officer Ralph Sutherland a\ntotal cost estimate of $85,761,803. “Local geotech” was a $25,000 line item\nincluded in that number. Transportation of materials to the site, security\ndesign, landscaping, and furniture, however, were listed as allowances in\nspecific amounts, presumably meaning that costs in excess of those allowances\nwould be borne by DOS.\n\n        Ralph Sutherland wrote to Bob Sanders on September 25, 2002, that\nKI’s initial proposed price of $85,181,803 was $26,816,803 above the\ngovernment’s estimate. Mr. Sutherland asked that Mr. Sanders “advise OBO\nsenior management accordingly and show me the money if OBO wishes to\ncontinue pursuing the Kullman design-build SED/modular approach for the\nDushanbe NOB project.” JX 140 at 1 (emphasis in original). Mr. Sutherland\nemphasized, “I need to know how much money we have before I can\nestablish negotiation objectives and limitations and I need time to put a\npre-negotiation plan together. I do not have any funded requisitions for this\nproject at the present time.” JX 140 at 1 (emphasis in original). Mr.\nSutherland added, “John Lefkus has informed me that the prices are high\nbecause of limited time and information to put together a proposal for a project\nof this magnitude. He will be able to negotiate a realistic firm fixed price with\nus at the end of the Phase I design development (November 2002).” JX 140\nat 1.\n\n      Negotiations continued during the period September 27-30, 2002. On\nSeptember 30, 2002, Mr. Sutherland wrote to John Lefkus that KI’s September\n25 proposal was unacceptable. Mr. Sutherland explained that the estimate\n\n                                       8\n\fwas too high and asked KI to “consider a GMP [guaranteed maximum price]\noffer of $60,730,000 in a fixed price contract, without incentives.” JX 143 at\n1 (emphasis in original). Mr. Sutherland concluded the e-mail by writing, “If\nwe do not reach agreement this morning, the project may not be awarded to\nKullman because of what we can afford.” JX 143 at 1. Presumably this was\nbecause September 30 was the last day of the government’s fiscal year. Mr.\nSutherland also proposed certain deletions from the SOW.\n\n       Later that day, Mr. Lefkus responded to Mr. Sutherland’s\ncommunication. Mr. Lefkus summed up the changes in the scope of work,\nwhich included reducing the number of gate houses, reducing by 200 lineal\nmeters the perimeter wall, and reducing the size and function of the utility\nbuilding. Mr. Lefkus then lowered the proposed allowance for transportation\nto $10 million based on the following: “[f]actors which reduce project scope;”\n“[p]otential of local sourcing;” and “[r]equirement to ship only 50% of volume\nU.S. flag.” JX 145 at 1. Based on these changes, KI agreed to “entertain a\nGMP of $60,730,000.00 noting the $10 million transportation allowance.” JX\n145 at 1.\n\n       On September 30, 2002, DOS issued Modification number two\n(“M002”) to the contract and obligated available funds. The amendment was\nissued “for a guaranteed maximum price of $50.730 Mil plus an allowance of\n$10.0 Mil for transportation.” JX 149 at 5.\n\n      Shortly after Mr. Sutherland closed this deal, Mr. Sanders referred to\nMr. Sutherland as a “miracle worker.” JX 148 at 1. Mr. Sanders was replaced\nas COR by Michael (“Mike”) Ross on October 2, 2002.7\n\n\n7\n  There was a lot of turnover in the OBO employees who managed the\nDushanbe Project. The parties stipulated to the following chronology of the\nContracting Officers: from July 2002 until December 11, 2003, Ralph\nSutherland was the CO; from December 11, 2003, until June 16, 2004, Lorri\nLowther was the CO; from June 17, 2004, until July 15, 2004, Lisa Goodwine\nwas the CO; from July 15, 2004, until October 26, 2004, Brian Mulcahy was\nthe CO; and then from October 26, 2004, until the contract was terminated on\nJune 17, 2005, Lorri Lowther served a second stint as CO. The CO was\nassisted by a COR who also carried the title of Project Executive. The first\nCOR was Robert Sanders from July 2002 to October 2, 2002, then Michael\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                      9\n\f       D.     Terms of the Contract\n\n       Through M002, the terms of and attachments to the solicitation were\nmade part of the contract pursuant to which KI agreed to build the embassy.\nIn addition, it provided the following with respect to pricing:\n\n       Kullman Industries [sic] proposal of $60,730,000 dated\n       September 30, 2002[,] is hereby accepted by the Government.\n       The Contractor shall perform Phase II design, construction and\n       fabrication of the new U.S. Embassy compound in Dushanbe,\n       Tajikistan in accordance with contract number SALMEC-02-C-\n       0025, as modified heretofore. This work is to be performed for\n       a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) of $50,730,000, plus an\n       allowance of $10,000,000 for Transportation. The GMP will be\n       evaluated and a fixed price for phase II will be negotiated upon\n       completion of Phase I of this contract. A written Notice to\n       Proceed must be issued prior to performance of Phase II\n       services.\n\nJX 3 at 1. The following provisions regarding price were also included in or\nattached to the solicitation and were thereby incorporated by reference into\nM002:\n\n       B.1 PRICING\n       B.1.1 The Contract Price includes all labor, materials,\n       equipment, and services necessary to accomplish the design and\n       construction required by the Contract Documents, including\n       applicable customs duties, transportation to the site, storage,\n       premiums for insurance and bonds required by the Solicitation\n       Documents and/or the Contract Documents, permits, license,\n       and inspection fees, and all other items called for by the contract\n       or otherwise necessary for performance of the contract.

The Contractor’s geotechnical engineer shall review\n       all available geotechnical information provided in the Contract\n       package and become familiar with the soil and site conditions at\n       the project site by visiting the site. During the site visit and in\n       subsequent phases of the project, the Contractor shall examine\n       and/or verify the information provided and obtain any additional\n       information to complete the design and construction of the\n       project. The Contractor remains solely responsible and liable\n       for design sufficiency and should not depend on reports\n       provided by the USG as part of the contract documents.\n\nJX 1 at 26. Additionally, the SOW provides,\n\n       The geotechnical consultant shall be consulted during the site\n       design to provide recommendations and design for site retaining\n       structures, ground modification[] methods, pavement structural\n       design, and subsurface drainage.\n\nJX 1 at 31. The SOW continues with the following directions about the\ngeotechnical consultant’s role in the project:\n\n       The geotechnical consultant shall continue providing services\n       during construction, especially during the construction of\n       foundations, pile loading test, ground modification, retaining\n       systems, etc. to confirm the recommendations provided during\n       the design stage of the project.\n\nJX 1 at 34.\n\n        Pursuant to Section F of the contract, KI was required to submit a report\ndetailing its geotechnical investigation 57 days after the date of the first Notice\nto Proceed. Similarly, it was the contractor’s responsibility to visit “the project\nsite and verifying all pertinent site conditions.” JX 1 at 83. The contract also\nreferenced an attachment, J.3.7 “Dushanbe Geological Overview,” which\nprovided the following general description of the geotechnical conditions:\n\n                                        12\n\f       From the engineering and geotechnical standpoint, the site is\n       suitable for the proposed NOB. However, due to the geologic\n       setting of the entire city as well as the high seismicity of the\n       area, additional site development costs may be anticipated\n       including sub-grade preparation and foundations, re-grading/fill\n       of the site, and utilities.\n\n       Dushanbe is located in a region in which collapsible silt/clay\n       soils occupy the upper 15-18 meters. These soils are very\n       sensitive to moisture and require special foundation sub-grade\n       preparation. Below the silt/clay layer, alluvial sand and gravel\n       soils extend to a depth greater than 50 meters. The permanent\n       water table may exist at much shallower depths at this site. For\n       a NOB up to 3 stories in height, a mat foundation is anticipated\n       as the most likely system to support the proposed structure. For\n       heavier structures, piles may be required. Both systems are\n       commonly used in Dushanbe. Further geotechnical studies are\n       required to confirm our findings. A thorough geological\n       investigation of the site is currently in progress and will be\n       completed within the next few weeks.\n\n       According to the local Geologic and Foundation Institute, the\n       site is located in seismic zone 9 (per Soviet standards). OBO’s\n       level of seismicity defines Dushanbe as zone 4 per UBC.\n       Regardless, the seismicity level is considered very high and any\n       future structures need to be designed accordingly. As compared\n       to other locations, the site has a thicker overburden of\n       collapsible soils.\n\nJX 11 (emphasis added); see also JX 1 at 109.\n\n        The contract incorporated FAR 52.211-12, giving the government\nauthority to assess liquidate damages, which initially were set at $8,500.00 per\nday. With respect to excusable days of delay, it provided that “[t]he Contractor\nwill be allowed time, not money, for excusable delays as defined in FAR\n52.249-10.” JX 1 at 48. Excusable delays include, among other things, “(1)\nacts of God or of the public enemy, (2) acts of the United States Government\nin either its sovereign or contractual capacity, (3) acts of the government of the\nhost country in its sovereign capacity, . . . (11) delays in delivery of\nGovernment furnished equipment and (12) unusually severe weather.” JX 1\n\n                                       13\n\fat 48.\n\n        Division 1 of the contract, which was included in the solicitation\npursuant to M001, contained provisions about security details, temporary\nutilities, and the schedule of values. The contract required the contractor to\ninvoice the government for periodic payment based on the percentage of work\ncompleted for each line item on a schedule of values developed by the\ncontracting officer and to include on the invoice a certification stating that the\ncontractor had paid its subcontractors and suppliers.\n\n       The security measures described in Division 1 were necessary to\nmaintain the integrity of the CAA. One of the ways to ensure the security of\nthe CAA is to limit access by “[u]ncleared personnel” unless “accompanied by\na [Construction Surveillance Technician] CST.” JX 14 at 5. In order for\nforeign nationals to be cleared for access to work on the CAA, they had to\n“submit to a background investigation and be approved by the [Site Security\nManager] SSM before access is granted to Project Site.” JX 14 at 4. If the\nforeign national’s application for access to the site was pending but not yet\napproved, the Site Security Manager (“SSM”) had discretion to permit the\nforeign national to perform limited work on site.\n\n        In addition to describing who could access the CAA during\nconstruction, and in order to maintain the integrity of the CAA once built,\nDivision 1 also set out procedures for securely producing and shipping to the\nsite the materials incorporated into the CAA.8 Once the modular panels that\nwere to be used as floors and walls were built in New Jersey and certified as\ncompliant with relevant security precautions, containers of materials or\nmodules traveled to the project site in Dushanbe, where security officers would\n“de-certify” the container. This involved the following: “1.) inspection of\ncontainer exterior and dunnage wall, 2.) removal of dunnage wall by\ncontractor, 3.) removal of all material by contractor in accordance with site\nsecurity procedures and 4.) inspection of interior of container by decertifying\nofficer.” JX 15 at 9.\n\n       Once the secure shipment was inspected it would be moved “to [a]\nsecure storage area until required for installation in CAA.” JX 14 at 16.\n\n\n8\n The details of secure shipping and production are classified and will not be\ndescribed.\n\n                                       14\n\fElsewhere the contract provided that “[t]he Government shall consider\nnoncompliance with the security regulations by the Contractor or his\nemployees, subcontractors, suppliers, etc. to be sufficient grounds for\ntermination of the contract for default.” JX 1 at 84.\n\n       The government also maintained the right, after a secure shipment was\ncomplete, “to determine whether products have been compromised and\ntherefore cannot be used in a CAA or contiguous space. Where such\ncompromise results from the Contractor’s failure to comply with security\nprocedures, the Contractor shall bear entire cost associated with rectifying\ncompromise and restoration of fundamental secure nature of product(s)\naffected.” JX 14 at 7-8. Division 1 provided, however, that “[i]n instances\nwhere authorized work must be disassembled, uncovered, or demolished to\naccommodate inspection and then reassembled, recovered, or rebuilt, resultant\ncosts of such actions shall be borne by Government where inspected work is\nfound to be in conformance with Construction Specifications and security\nrequirements.” JX 14 at 19.\n\n        Regarding utilities, Division 1 required the contractor to provide\ntemporary water, sewer, electrical power, and telecommunications, throughout\nthe course of the project. The contractor was directed to “[c]onnect to existing\nfranchised utilities for required services, where reasonably possible.” JX 12\nat 5. “At the earliest reasonable date, [the contractor should] connect with\npermanent utility lines and service connections, and remove temporary\nutilities/services; comply with the Project Director’s requests.” JX 12 at 6. In\naddition to temporary utilities, the contractor was obligated to provide\ntemporary office facilities and equipment, including computer systems.\n\n       E.     Performing Phase I\n\n         In November of 2002, KI submitted an initial design, which the\ngovernment rejected in part because the design for the foundation was\ndeficient. KI then sent LBG representatives to Dushanbe in January of 2003\nto test the soil conditions and recommend a foundation design. LBG issued a\ndraft report in late March that agreed with the SANIIOSP findings and\nrecommended the same approach contained in the earlier SANIIOSP\ngeotechnical report, i.e., attempting to compress the foundation soils by an\nextensive flooding and de-watering system.\n\n       DOS eventually approved KI’s Phase I plan to use a modular approach\n\n                                      15\n\fto constructing most of the embassy structures. The NOB, for example, was\nassembled of six sided metal boxes, approximately 10 feet wide, 10 feet high,\nand 30 feet long. Each module weighed anywhere from 30,000 to 100,000\npounds. These boxes were fabricated at KI’s New Jersey plant in a process\nthat started with constructing a six-sided steel frame, pouring concrete in the\nbase, building walls, and then adding finishes like drywall, flooring, and\ninfrastructure for utilities. Then the modules were shipped via boat and train\nto Dushanbe where they were stacked up on the foundation to constitute the\nbuilding. Once the module was hoisted into place with a crane, KI employees\nwould weld them together. The process would repeat as more stories were\nadded to the building. Over 200 modules were used in the construction of the\nDushanbe NOB.\n\nIII.     The Dushanbe Project: Phase II\n\n         A.     Continued Negotiations Over Price\n\n        Although M002 reads as if it were a complete agreement by the parties,\nKI took the position early on in contract performance, and argues in this\nlitigation, that M002 left room for the parties to revisit the contract price,\nspecifically in connection with what it would cost plaintiff to do the\npreliminary work (geotechnical) for the foundations. Mr. Lefkus testified that,\nwhen KI agreed to M002, it did so with the understanding that the parties\nwould renegotiate a firm fixed price once Phase I was complete and that KI\nwas not at risk because, even though it had agreed to perform the project for\na GMP of $60.7 million, that did not obligate KI to a specific type of\nperformance when there was no agreed upon design. Mr. Lefkus believed that\nthe sole function of M002 was to secure the funding that was available in\nfiscal year 2002, which would have otherwise lapsed on October 1, 2002. This\nis contrary to Mr. Sutherland’s understanding that under M002, the\ngovernment could require the contractor to perform the contract as written for\nthe agreed upon price.\n\n       Mr. Sutherland was willing, however, to discuss an adjustment in price.\nIn an effort to negotiate a mutually acceptable price, Mr. Sutherland met on\nMay 1, 2003, with KI representatives, including Alan Rand,9 who was newly\n\n\n9\n    Mr. Rand had proposed $69.5 million as a firm fixed price for the contract\n                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                       16\n\fappointed by KI as its Vice President for Federal Contracts, and who was\ngiven responsibility for overseeing the Dushanbe project. In a letter dated May\n2, 2003, Mr. Rand, wrote the following to Mr. Sutherland:\n\n       As we discussed on May 1, we will treat the unknown and\n       unforeseen geo-technical issues as a change to the base line\n       price comparison. Therefore, we have not included a price for\n       this work in the attached Final Price spreadsheet. We are,\n       however, prepared to provide OBO with a “hard” number as part\n       of a change to the base line price for this project.\n\nJX 191 at 2. Mr. Sutherland responded by referring to the agreement\nestablished in M002. He wrote the following in a May 6, 2003 e-mail to Mr.\nRand:\n\n       On September 30, 2002 we reached a mutual agreement on\n       $60,730,000 for Phase II design, construction and fabrication.\n       This consisted of a promise by KI to complete all work required\n       for a guaranteed maximum price (GMP) of $50,730,000, plus an\n       allowance of $10,000,000 for transportation. . . . While the\n       Government was willing to take the risk that transportation costs\n       could move up or down as an allowance cost, we fully expected\n       KI to perform the work at or below the guaranteed maximum\n       price as promised in accordance with the terms of the contract.\n\nJX 195 at 3.\n\n       Mike Ross, the OBO Project Executive who worked with Mr.\nSutherland on the Dushanbe project, joined the conversation by e-mailing Mr.\nRand: “When John [Lefkus] submitted his proposal on Sept. 30, he took no\nexceptions to the contract. Now, 7 months into the project, I’m not sure if\nthere is anything he doesn’t take exception to.” JX 195 at 2. Mr. Rand\nresponded to both Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Ross that “I hope that I have been\nclear with regard to the items that are not included in our price i.e. . . . geotech\n\n\n\n\n9\n (...continued)\non April 21, 2003.\n\n                                        17\n\fwork.” JX 195 at 1. On May 7, 2003, Mr. Ross wrote10 to Mr. Rand the\nfollowing:\n\n       You’re not at all clear. You’re [sic] proposal of Sept. 30, 02\n       provided a guaranteed maximum price for the construction of\n       the building and took no exceptions to the contract as you are\n       mentioning below. The only allowance you mentioned in the\n       proposal was for transportation. If the geotech work turns out\n       to be a differing site condition you will pursue it as such. Your\n       delays in completing your foundation analysis are your\n       responsibility.\n\nJX 195 at 1.\n\n       Meanwhile, Mr. Prior, Mr. Sutherland, and Mr. Ross agreed among\nthemselves to reserve $2 million in funding to be used in the event that KI\nproved that it was entitled to an equitable adjustment for differing site\nconditions. Prior to the in-person negotiations that occurred in May 2003, Mr.\nSutherland prepared a “pre-negotiation plan,” which states that “the\nGovernment will take the position that [the geotech] contingency is covered\nby the Differing Site Conditions clause of the contract” when KI requests, as\nanticipated, “$2 million for unknown geotechnical conditions.” JX 1341 at 3.\n\n        Final negotiations concerning Phase II were held on May 8, 2003, in\nArlington, VA. Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Prior, and Mr. Ross represented the\ngovernment and Mr. Lefkus, Mr. Rand, and two others attended on KI’s\nbehalf.\n\n       Following the May 2003 negotiations, Mr. Sutherland recorded that the\nparties agreed to convert the contract from a guaranteed maximum price to a\nfirm fixed price and to raise the contract price by $2 million by changing the\n$10 million transportation allowance into a $12 million fixed price item. JX\n1342 at 3. He also wrote, “The Contractor’s proposed $2 million for unknown\ngeotechnical conditions was considered by the Government to be an\nunjustified contingency and was rejected.” JX 1342 at 3 (Price Negotiation\nMemorandum). That change was later confirmed in M004, discussed below.\n\n\n10\n  Mr. Lefkus, Eduardo Gaarder, Mr. Prior, and Mr. Sutherland were copied\non this e-mail. JX 195 at 1.\n\n                                      18\n\f       The third interim notice to proceed was issued by Mr. Sutherland on\nMay 8, 2003, which authorized KI to “[p]roceed with mobilization and site\npreparation, not to exceed $1,000,000.” JX 198 at 1. Thus, the project moved\nforward as negotiations over price continued in May 2003.11\n\n       In a May 14, 2003 e-mail to employees of Greenway Enterprises, KI’s\nmain subcontractor on the Dushanbe project, Mr. Kosinski explained KI’s\nunderstanding of how the parties would address the geotechnical work in light\nof the negotiations in the following way:\n\n       We have agreed to approach the geotech remediation work as a\n       “separate issue” in terms of both cost and schedule. This will be\n       addressed later on with a change order. What this means to you\n       is that for the time being, you need to submit your schedule\n       based on the assumption that we do not have to do any of the\n       geotech prep work. . . . Based on this we will back out the\n       $874,958.00 from your contract amount for the geotech, and the\n       revised baseline schedule will show a contract completion of\n       June 24, 2004. Once the actual cost and schedule impacts are\n       confirmed, we will submit a change order to OBO for the\n       additional cost and time.\n\nJX 200 at 1.\n\n         Mr. Sutherland also understood that the geotechnical work would be the\nsubject of a possible change order, although he probably had a different\nunderstanding than KI representatives as to what that meant. As he testified\nat trial:\n\n               The government’s position was always, unless you show\n       us that there’s some sort of differing site conditions, we’re not\n       going to allow that. So we stuck with that position, and, as far\n       as the government was concerned, they were never able to prove\n       that, though – we never added it during negotiations, even\n       though Kullman would have liked to have seen an extra $2\n\n\n11\n  Chris Matise, KI’s Project Manager, arrived on site in Dushanbe on May 12,\n2003. KI submitted its detailed project schedule on May 15, 2003, which was\nlater approved by the government on May 30, 2003.\n\n                                      19\n\f       million for that contingency. That’s exactly what it was. It was\n       contingency in our eyes.\n\n              We felt, well, we should prepare for the contingency, but\n       since they haven’t yet demonstrated to us that it is a differing\n       site condition, we’re not going to put it in the contract.\n\nTr. 2216-17 (Sutherland).\n\n       The final adjustment to price was captured in M004.12 M004 made\nseveral changes to the contract. As discussed above, the original guaranteed\nmaximum price of $60,730,000 was changed to a firm fixed price of\n$62,700,000.00, which resulted in an overall increase in the total contract price\nof $1,970,000. Also, the contract completion date was extended to June 20,\n2004. Finally, the potential daily liquidated damages was decreased from\n$8,500 to $3,380.\n\n       M004 also incorporated other documents into the contract. First, it\nreferenced a May 1, 2003 classified document on the “Dushanbe Chancery\nCeiling Heights” given to KI by Mike Ross. Second, the May 29, 2003 letter\nfrom KI was also incorporated into M004. In this letter, John Lefkus\nmemorialized the following understanding:\n\n       Final [notice to proceed] to be issued by June 1st or before. This\n       references DS Certification. Contract will be adjusted if the\n       [notice to proceed] is not issued by then. Contract is extended\n       65 days for a June 20, 2004 completion. This extension takes\n       in[to] account the weeks to the [notice to proceed] and previous\n       suspension and delays.\n\nJX 5 at 5. The letter continues, “The government acknowledges that with the\nexception of a single DS condition, no other outstanding issues remain for DS\nCertification.” JX 5 at 5. KI’s letter does not mention the geotechnical issue.\n\n       Although M004 was not signed by Mr. Sutherland until August 7, 2003,\n\n\n12\n  M003, which is dated December 12, 2002, clarified that certain work had to\nbe performed by workers that had obtained security clearance at the secret\nlevel. JX 4 at 1.\n\n                                       20\n\fand Mr. Lefkus on September 16, 2003, it was given an effective date of May\n29, 2003. May 29 was also the date that KI was issued the unlimited notice to\nproceed. Plaintiff makes much of the fact that KI waited to execute M004\nuntil it submitted the differing site condition request for equitable adjustment,\nbut we attach no contractual significance to that fact.\n\n       B.     Geotechnical Work\n\n              1.      Breaking Ground: The Geotechnical Work Begins\n\n       On June 1, 2003, Catherine Wilkins arrived on site to serve as the OBO\nProject Director. There was a ground-breaking ceremony held at the site on\nJune 10, 2003. General Williams, Suzanne Conrad, Antonio Delgado, Thomas\nQuinzio, Mike Ross, Kevin Sarring, Barbara Richter, Jay Neustel, and Bob\nCult from OBO and Mr. Lefkus, Mr. Rand, and Mr. Kosinski from KI were in\nDushanbe for the ground-breaking ceremony and the pre-construction\nconference.\n\n        Even after the work began on site, the parties continued to quibble over\nhow the geotechnical work would be financed. As the newcomer, Ms. Wilkins\nwas told by KI that the geotech “work is specifically not included in [KI’s]\ncontract at this time and that they are preparing a price proposal to be\nnegotiated.” JX 219 at 1. In light of KI’s assertion, Ms. Wilkins e-mailed Mr.\nSutherland and Mr. Ross on June 18, 2003, to reaffirm that the government’s\nposition was that “the government expects the contractor to proceed with the\nconstruction, and, if they feel that the geotech work is not in their contract, to\nfile a request for equitable adjustment.” JX 219 at 1. Mr. Ross responded on\nJune 25 with the following:\n\n              The government does not accept any claim from the\n       contractor that the foundation is not in their contract. They have\n       never given us anything in writing to that effect nor have they\n       mentioned an exclusion. They have a design-build contract that\n       includes putting the building on a competent foundation.\n\n              ....\n\n              Further, it has been explained to them that any request for\n       equitable adjustment must be presented to the contracting officer\n       with a comprehensive schedule and cost analysis attached.\n\n                                       21\n\f       Otherwise we have nothing to talk about.\n\nJX 224 at 2. After receiving this message, Ms. Wilkins wrote back to Mr.\nRoss informing him that the contractor was threatening to suspend work until\nthere was a signed contract modification addressing this issue. Mr. Ross then\ne-mailed Mr. Alan with the following note:\n\n       What Catherine is telling me is NOT what we agreed. You told\n       me at site last week that you would proceed with the foundation\n       work and once you determined what, if anything, was a differing\n       site condition, you would apply for a request for equitable\n       adjustment.\n\n       As of now, the Government does NOT agree that this work is\n       not in your contract and if you delay the project and fail to prove\n       otherwise, you’re going to be on the hook for making up the lost\n       time.\n\n       I would suggest that you get rolling with the foundation work\n       and start putting together your RFEA if you believe you are\n       entitled to one.\n\nJX 224 at 1. Mr Sutherland echoed these sentiments two days later when he\ne-mailed Mr. Rand and instructed KI to “Get Going!” with the site work. JX\n225 at 1. In this e-mail, Mr. Sutherland reminded Mr. Rand of KI’s obligation\nto prosecute the work diligently. Mr. Sutherland wrote, “I have yet to see any\nevidence that there are in fact any differing site conditions relating to soils or\nany other geotech concerns. So far it’s been speculation. The contract does\nnot provide for any delay of work based on unsupported speculation.” JX 225\nat 1.\n\n       Despite the foregoing, Ms. Wilkins’ Project Director Summary for July\n2003 characterized contractor relations and customer satisfaction as “good.”\nJX 60 at 1.13 The project status was characterized as “green,” or positive, even\nthough “[c]onstruction activity in the field has been slow to get started.” JX\n\n\n13\n  In this document, Ms. Wilkins also reported that the contract completion\ndate was June 20, 2004, although the “[s]tatus of mod #4 not confirmed.” JX\n60 at 2.\n\n                                       22\n\f60 at 1. Ms. Wilkins recorded that excavation, grubbing, grading, and soil\nwetting had begun. JX 60 at 2. Joseph Allen, KI’s Site Superintendent who\nworked on the geotechnical and soil remediation efforts, recalled the\nfollowing:\n\n       [T]o remedy those [poor and collapsible] soil conditions, there\n       were some processes we had to do after we excavated to get the\n       soil prepared for the load that was going to be put on it . . . .\n\n              So it was a process of excavating, flooding the area,\n       having it hold standing water. And – and that was for, if I\n       remember correctly, I think it was for 28 days was what the\n       requirement was. And then you remove that, you excavate a\n       portion of it, compact it, test the soil.\n\nTr. 824-25. KI sent the test samples to LBG for analysis. KI repeated this\nprocess for several months with little resulting soil settlement. LBG released\na report, JX 420, in March of 2004 that concluded the soils had settled only\n2 centimeters as a result of the compaction efforts.\n\n              2.     KI Submits a Request for Equitable Adjustment and\n                     Then Signs M004\n\n       Before the results of the settlement efforts were known however, on\nJune 9, 2003, Mr. Ross sent KI the cost estimate forms to complete and submit\nalong with the request for equitable adjustment (“REA”) concerning the site\nconditions. KI submitted its differing site condition REA to Mr. Sutherland\non August 15, 2003. The REA asserted that the geological conditions were\n“extreme and differ[ent] from standards applied at the time of the initial\ncontract award/[notice to proceed] and during negotiations.” JX 22 at 3. In\nthe REA, KI requested a monetary adjustment of $3,032,915 and a time\nextension that would move substantial completion to November 15, 2004. The\ntime extension was requested because KI estimated that “an eight-week time\nperiod” was necessary for soil subsidence. JX 22 at 6. In its submission, KI\nasserted that the equitable adjustment was warranted because “during final\ncontract negotiations, all costs and schedule impact that relate to the\ngeotechnical work were specifically excluded from the negotiated price\npending issuance of the final geotechnical report, completion of the\nstructural/geotechnical design effort, and cost and schedule analysis.” JX 22\nat 3.\n\n                                      23\n\f        Mr. Lefkus signed M004 on September 16, 2003. At the time that KI\nsubmitted its REA and executed M004, the remedial geotechnical work was\nnot included in the Schedule of Values. JX 214, JX 230, JX 237, JX 250; see\nTr. 2442 (Lefkus) (“[W]e had not yet acknowledged the contractor’s obligation\nto do those [geotech] activities because they did not appear on the schedule.”).\n\n              3.     The Site Work Continues\n\n       As August 2003 came to a close, Ms. Wilkins described the project\nstatus as “yellow,” and the contractor performance as “significantly behind\nschedule.” JX 61 at 1. Ms. Wilkins recorded that “[e]xcavation was\ncompleted during the month of August at the building footprints” but “[s]oil\nwetting operations continued at the perimeter wall foundations.” JX 61 at 1.\n\n                     a.      Delay\n\n        In September 2003, Ms. Wilkins’ characterization of the project status\nchanged to red, which she testified meant that there was a serious problem\nbecause the contractor was behind schedule. KI was so far behind schedule\nat this point that Ms. Wilkins wrote, that KI was “unlikely to complete within\nthe contract performance period.” JX 62 at 1. She estimated that the job was\n20.35% complete. JX 62 at 2. Ms. Wilkins recorded that “[a]ctivity at the site\ncontinues to focus on the geotechnical work required to prepare the soil prior\nto construction of the foundations.” JX 62 at 1.\n\n                     b.      Geotech is Added to the Schedule of Values\n\n       In order to receive periodic compensation for work performed, KI\nsubmitted invoices to the agency. It billed for the percentage of work\ncompleted for each line item on a Schedule of Values (“SOV”). The SOV\nsubmitted by KI with the August 2003 invoice showed a line item of $12\nmillion for transportation and did not include a line item for geotechnical\nwork. JX 250. The September 2003 invoice is the first one submitted by KI\nthat included a line item for geotechnical work, valued at $3,032,915. This\nentry corresponded with a reduction in the transportation line item in the\nSeptember 2003 schedule of values, which became six new line items titled\n“Transport Modules from Port to Site” with a total value of approximately $8.8\nmillion. JX 270 at 15.\n\n       Although KI had initially excluded line items for geotechnical work in\n\n                                      24\n\fthe SOV,14 inclusion of these line items became the topic of discussion at the\nend of September 2003. Mr. Ross wrote the following to Mr. Rand on October\n1, 2003: “Per our meeting with Anne last week, you were going to adjust your\nschedule to reflect the geotech work. Those activities and there [sic] values\nshould then be exported to your schedule of values.” JX 119 at 897.\n\n\n14\n  The SOV originates with the contractor and is then reviewed and approved\nby the government. Tr. 209 (Farley). The contract states:\n\n       Before the first progress payment under this contract becomes\n       due, the contractor shall prepare a Detailed Estimate for\n       Progress Payments itemizing the Contract Price in the form and\n       in such detail as is required by the Contract Documents. The\n       values in the Detailed Estimate will be used as a basis for\n       determining progress payments, but will not be conclusive as to\n       the amounts due the Contractor or as to the value of changes in\n       the work. The Contractor’s overhead and profit shall be\n       prorated throughout the life of the contract.\n\nJX 1 at 60. The contract documents further prescribe:\n\n       1. The Contractor shall submit applications for progress\n       payment monthly.\n       2. Monthly Progress Payment applications shall be:\n             a) Substantiated by progress report submittals, as\n             specified.\n             b) Consistent with previous applications.\n             c) Accurately coordinated with the Schedule of\n             Values produced by the progress cost loaded\n             schedule process defined in Section 01314,\n             Project Schedules.\n             d) As directed by the Project Director,\n             coordinated with required meetings, inspections,\n             certifications, and similar actions.\n             e) Submitted subsequent to completion of\n             specified prerequisite work elements for which\n             partial payment has been requested.\n\nJX 57 at 14-15.\n\n                                     25\n\f       KI did include a new group of line items under the heading of\n“GeoTech” that totaled $3,032,915 in its September invoice. JX 270 at 12-13.\nThe bottom line contract value did not change in order to accommodate these\nnew line items. Rather, the transportation budget of $12 million was broken\ndown into smaller line items that then totaled to just short of $9 million. In\nother words, money was moved from transportation to geotechnical work,\nalthough the overall contract amount remained the same. Mr. Rand testified\nthat he discussed this change with Mr. Ross and Ms. Wilkins and obtained\ngovernment approval to move funds from the transportation line item to the\nnewly created line item for geotechnical work.\n\n       Around the same time that the geotechnical work was included within\nthe SOV, representatives from the government met with members of KI to\ndiscuss the geotechnical issues raised in the REA. JX 24 at 1 (stating the\nmeeting occurred on October 16, 2003). At this meeting, “KI/LBG\nrepresentatives confirmed that soil samples brought back to the United States\nand tested were consistent with the [SANIIOSP] report.” JX 24 at 4.\n\n        At the end of October 2003, Ms. Wilkins recorded in her Project\nDirector’s Summary that progress had been made on the geotechnical work,\nbut the soil wetting and monitoring phase was not complete. JX 63 at 1. KI\nalso prepared a monthly progress report for October which stated that the\ncontractor “continue[s] to anticipate approximately two months of field\nactivities that relate almost exclusively to the geotech effort.” JX 94 at 1. KI’s\nprediction proved true as Ms. Wilkins reported in both her November and\nDecember Project Director’s summaries that the contractor continued to flood\nand monitor the soils. JX 64 at 1, JX 65 at 1. As indicated above, after\nmonths of soil wetting, excavation, fill and drying, there was virtually no\nsettlement.\n\n                      c.     The Government Denies the REA\n\n     On November 12, 2003, Mr. Sutherland sent a letter to KI denying the\nREA. JX 24 at 1. The letter provided the following:\n\n       Section C of the contract requires the Contractor to perform\n       geotechnical services in Dushanbe. Since execution of the\n       contract, the Government has not made any changes to the\n       contract requirements regarding performance of geotechnical\n       activities. The contract does not contain any exceptions or\n\n                                       26\n\f       special provisions providing for additional consideration to\n       perform required geotechnical services. As a result of reviews,\n       evaluations, and discussions, the Government has determined\n       that the REA does not support any adjustment to the contract\n       price or performance schedule. Therefore, the REA is denied in\n       its entirety.\n\nJX 24 at 1. Additionally, Mr. Sutherland noted that KI received “Section C”\nof the contract on July 2, 2002, which included clauses C.2.8 and C.4.2.5 that\nincluded geotechnical activities within the scope of work, and that the July 12,\n2002 solicitation included attachment J.3.7, which should have put KI on\nnotice of the potential geological issues at the site. Mr. Sutherland also wrote,\n\n       The RFP and the contract contain FAR clauses 52.236-3, Site\n       Investigation and Conditions Affecting the Work (APR 1984).\n       The clause states that the Contractor has investigated and\n       satisfied itself of conditions that can affect the work or its cost,\n       including ‘the confirmation and conditions of the ground.’ The\n       clause goes on, ‘. . . . The Contractor also acknowledges that it\n       has satisfied itself as to the character, quality, and quantity of\n       surface and subsurface materials or obstacles to be encountered\n       insofar as this information is reasonably ascertainable from an\n       inspection of the site, including all exploratory work done by the\n       Government . . . failure of the Contractor to take the actions\n       described and acknowledged in this paragraph will not relieve\n       the Contractor from responsibility for estimating properly the\n       difficulty and cost of performing the work without additional\n       expense to the Government . . . The Government assumes no\n       responsibility for any conclusions or interpretations made by the\n       Contractor based on information made available by the\n       Government.’\n\nJX 24 at 3.\n\n        Mr. Sutherland noted that “KI’s decision to hold off sending a\ngeotechnical engineer to Dushanbe until January 2003 showed negligence and\nlikely contributed to delays.” JX 24 at 4. Regarding the September 30, 2002\nGMP, Mr. Sutherland wrote, “Although the final offer did include some\nmutually agreed upon conditions, it did not include any conditions regarding\ngeotechnical issues.” JX 24 at 4 (underline in original). Mr. Sutherland\n\n                                       27\n\fconcluded, “Based on field reports and observations, it is believed that\nKullman Industries failed to prosecute the geotechnical work diligently, as\nrequired by [the] contract.” JX 24 at 8. DOS architect Vassilios Magginas\nwrote in the analysis attached to Mr. Sutherland’s letter, “I do not see any\nreason why OBO has to pay for something extra for a design decision made by\n[KI] and, overall, is a requirement of the project.” JX 24 at 13.\n\n              4.     Retainage and Liquidated Damages\n\n       The government began retaining a portion of KI’s progress payments\nin April of 2003 pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation Part 52.232-5(e)\n(2003), which provides,\n\n       (e) Retainage. If the Contracting Officer finds that satisfactory\n       progress was achieved during any period for which a progress\n       payment is to be made, the Contracting Officer shall authorize\n       payment to be made in full. However, if satisfactory progress\n       has not been made, the Contracting Officer may retain a\n       maximum of 10 percent of the amount of the payment until\n       satisfactory progress is achieved. When the work is substantially\n       complete, the Contracting Officer may retain from previously\n       withheld funds and future progress payments that amount the\n       Contracting Officer considers adequate for protection of the\n       Government and shall release to the Contractor all the remaining\n       withheld funds. Also, on completion and acceptance of each\n       separate building, public work, or other division of the contract,\n       for which the price is stated separately in the contract, payment\n       shall be made for the completed work without retention of a\n       percentage.\n\nThe government’s rationale for the initial withholding was unsatisfactory\nprogress with the design. Then, as geotechnical work threatened satisfactory\nprogress on the rest of the project, the government once again justified\nretaining a small percent of KI’s progress payments.\n\n      Mr. Rand wrote to Mr. Sutherland on December 5, 2003, describing the\nimpact of the government’s decision to retain part of KI’s progress payments:\n\n       [T]he recent lack of payment and withholding by the\n       government has created an intolerable condition . . . .\n\n                                      28\n\f      Withholdings for non-payment of applications not in terms\n      (September and earlier) is over 30% of the [sic] Kullman’s\n      undisputed earnings. I believe that the lack of payment for\n      approved undisputed work technically constitutes a breach by\n      the government. . . .\n\n      This lack of cash flow has a direct negative impact on the\n      project team and the project’s success. . . . Professional\n      consultants along with foreign and domestic subcontractors\n      struggle with large outstanding balances for work that has been\n      performed and approved.\n\n      ....\n\n      During the meeting, Mike Ross made me aware of OBO’s\n      rationale for withholding 10% of each of Kullman’s invoices.\n      His rationale is schedule related and is directly attributed to the\n      geotech work now taking place. If we were able to show a\n      geotech recovery plan related to schedule, all sums currently\n      retained would be returned to Kullman.\n\nJX 303 at 1. Throughout the contract, the government continued to\nperiodically exercise its right to withhold up to 10% of the value of KI’s\ninvoices and at no time did the government exceed its authority to collect\nretainage pursuant to the FAR. The total retention withheld by the government\nat the end of the contract was $2,187,022.\n\n       On June 18, 2004, Lisa Goodwine, the contracting officer at the time,\nsent Mr. Rand formal notice that the government intended to assess liquidated\ndamages in the amount of $3,380 per day beginning on June 21, 2004, because\nthe contract completion date was June 20, 2004.15 JX 539; see Tr. 447-48\n(Lowther). However, we find no reference to a formal assessment of\nliquidated damages, and the government has not made liquidated damages part\n\n\n15\n  The letter was actually signed by James G. Thomas, Jr., as the CO, and was\nsent by Lisa Goodwine. However, the parties stipulated that Lisa Goodwine\nwas the CO for the Dushanbe project from June 17, 2004, until July 15, 2004.\nMs. Lowther explained that Mr. Thomas was the Senior Contracting Officer\nin the division.\n\n                                      29\n\fof its counter-claim here.\n\n       C.     Security Breach & Mold Remediation\n\n        Once the foundations were in place, the construction of the Embassy\nprogressed until a problem was encountered with the CAA within the NOB.\nUnlike the other modules within the NOB, the original intent of the parties was\nthat the modules comprising the CAA would be built in segregated facilities\nin New Jersey by screened employees under DOS observation.16 What the\nparties had to accommodate, however, is that because the CAA is room within\na room (the space between the interior room and the full expanse of the CAA\naccommodates periodic inspections to verify the security of the structure), the\nCAA module needed to have a ceiling height of twelve feet. The maximum\nheight of a module that could be shipped, however, was ten feet. As one might\nexpect, some of the details about this area within the Embassy are classified.\nNot only is information regarding the CAA restricted, but strict security\nmeasures were followed throughout the project in order to preserve the\nintegrity of this space.\n\n        The security problem created by the adaptation of the Standard Embassy\nDesign (“SED”) to modular construction was anticipated during Phase I. See\nJX 174 (March 20, 2003 e-mail discussing CAA ceiling height design issues).\nMr. Lefkus, Mr. Rand, Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Ross, Eduardo Gaarder, Patricia\nRegalo-Warren, Branch Chief within OBO, and others representing either KI\nor the government met on April 1, 2003, to address the security concerns\nidentified during the design phase. Mr. Sutherland wrote a memorandum after\nthe meeting which recorded the following:\n\n       The contract is based on Standard Embassy Design (SED)\n       documents and attachments thereto. Design submittals [sic] to\n       date show the ceiling at less than the 12-foot height. The\n       Government maintains that the contract documents require a 12-\n       foot ceiling. Kullman points out that Section C of the contract\n       states “. . . (SED) shall be modified as necessary to execute\n       using off-site modular technology. . .” Kullman explained that\n\n\n16\n  The parties called the screened workers “Cleared American Workers” or\n“CAW” and the DOS employees who were tasked with observing were\nreffered to as “Construction Surveillance Technicians” or “CST.”\n\n                                      30\n\f       it would not be practical to have the 12 foot ceiling for modular\n       construction because of transportation limitations, involving\n       oceanic shipping, rail cars in Europe, high-risk areas, low\n       tunnels, and other reasons. Alternative possibilities were\n       discussed.\n\n       . . . . Pending resolution of the ceiling issue, the Contracting\n       Officer has suspended all work under the contract.\n\nJX 179 at 1. Three days after this meeting, on April 4, 2003, DOS approved\nKI’s revised Construction and Transit Security Plan. This plan was originally\ndrafted on October 30, 2002, and revised on March 6, 2003. It included the\nfollowing language:\n\n       The goal of this plan is to facilitate the project schedule by\n       limiting the program to actual CAA area(s) and implementing\n       security measures to maintain an acceptable level of protection\n       . . . . [I]t is the contractor’s understanding that the CAA area(s)\n       impact the second and third floor modules on one specific\n       portion of the NOB.\n\nJX 153 at 4. The plan went on to state that\n\n       The unique nature of modular construction lends itself to the\n       security aspects of this project. We can readily identify and\n       segregate the modules requiring special protection. Unlike\n       conventional construction, where contiguous areas are\n       connected throughout the construction process, modular\n       construction allows for the separation of modules containing\n       sensitive areas to be assembled under segregated, controlled\n       conditions. With modular construction, floor and ceiling\n       structures are not shared elements; therefore the need to control\n       vertically adjacent areas is eliminated.\n\nJX 153 at 4-5. When the government approved the Construction and Transit\nSecurity Plan, it also noted that KI had not yet submitted a Transit Security\nPlan, which presumably would describe in detail the plan to transport modules\nand materials from New Jersey where they were assembled to Dushanbe.\n\n       At trial, several witnesses testified that KI did indeed create such a plan\n\n                                       31\n\fand that the government approved it. See, e.g. Tr. 2781-83 (Algire). The\nshipping plan, however, was classified and Mr. Kullman testified that KI was\nrequired to return to the government all classified documents once it was\nterminated. Tr. 1766-67. While witnesses confirmed that the plan listed which\nmodules and materials were to be shipped securely, see Tr. 5031 (Charles\nKuehne, Senior Desk Officer for Central Asia and team leader for security\nprocedures at DOS), the details of the list are unknown to the court because\nneither party produced it. Additionally, during trial, the court asked the\ngovernment to produce the classified blue prints, shipping lists, and any other\nexhibits that might aid our resolution of this issue and the government was\nunable or unwilling to do so. This gap becomes important, as discussed below,\nbecause a dispute arose as to whether the materials for the mechanical suite on\nthe fourth floor of the NOB above the CAA had to be shipped securely.\nBecause the government was in the best position to produce the secure\nshipping list and failed to do so, we draw the inference that the fourth-floor\nfloor panels were not on the list. See Huthnance v. Dist. of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 378 (D.D.C. 2013).\n\n       The ceiling height of the CAA was a topic of conversation during the\nnegotiations leading to M004. M004 incorporated a May 1, 2003 classified\ndocument on the “Dushanbe Chancery Ceiling Heights” given to KI by Mike\nRoss. The May 29, 2003 letter from KI, which was also incorporated into\nM004 provides the following:\n\n       Final [notice to proceed] to be issued by June 1st or before. This\n       references DS Certification. Contract will be adjusted if the\n       [notice to proceed] is not issued by then. Contract is extended\n       65 days for a June 20, 2004 completion. This extension takes\n       into account the weeks to the [notice to proceed] and previous\n       suspension and delays.\n\nJX 5 at 5. Finally, this letter acknowledges that, as of May 29, 2003, “DS”\ncertification was still an outstanding issue.\n\n      Mr. Rand and Mr. Lefkus once again met with Mr. Ross and others\nfrom diplomatic security on November 6, 2003, to address this issue. Mr.\nLekus recalled that\n\n       we couldn’t achieve [the necessary ceiling height] within a\n       single module, but our solution was to show them, represent\n\n                                      32\n\f       that, while the third floor module itself could not achieve that\n       space, that most of that space could be achieved with its\n       relationship with the fourth floor floor panels, which was for the\n       mechanical suite.\n\nTr. 2391. KI brought a proposed solution to this meeting in the form of a\nthree-dimensional model.17 Although the model was not produced at trial, Mr.\nLefkus described it as a shoe box with lid; “the third floor module looked like\nthe bottom of a shoe box and the fourth floor panel looked like the top of a\nshoe box.” Tr. 2393. The way in which KI proposed to solve the height issue\nwas by welding extenders on the floor of the fourth floor and then welding that\npanel on the ten foot high third floor module. This added approximately two\nfeet to the standard module. Mr. Lefkus testified that the three-dimensional\nmodel remained in the custody of the government after the meeting. Tr. 2394.\nIt was not introduced at trial.\n\n      When asked whether there was any discussion at the November 6\nmeeting about how the “lid” would be manufactured and shipped, Mr. Lefkus\nresponded,\n\n       A.     Yeah. We understood at that meeting that the third floor,\n              which was cleared space, was built securely, and the\n              fourth floor elements, which was mechanical space, was\n              not built securely.\n       Q.     Did the government understand that?\n       A.     The focus on the meeting was the clearance. I know we\n              discussed, you know, the fabrication of each spaces, so\n              I would say they did, but that was further discussed with\n              their transit security team. Every piece of the building\n              was approved for transportation. It was either sent\n              secure transportation or unsecure. So every element in\n              the building was designated for secure. If the product\n              was not built secure, you’d never send it secure\n              transportation. Conversely, if you built something in a\n              secure environment, you wouldn’t send it unsecured. So,\n\n\n17\n  Mr. Lefkus also testified that KI representatives provided “a series of plans”\nand the model to illustrate the relationship between the third and fourth floor\nin physical form. Tr. 2393.\n\n                                      33\n\f             they’re always related to each other.\n       The Court: When you say designated, by whom?\n       The Witness: It’s a process with the government to determine\n             what spaces they deem to be secure in nature. Some are\n             easy calls.\n       The Court: Spaces or mods? Spaces or elements of the\n             construction –\n       The Witness: Both, sir. It could be a module or it could be a\n             container with a product in it. So, anything that got\n             transported to the site – anything – whether it went in a\n             container, freight bulk, as a module, there was a\n             designated way that it was going to be transported.\n       The Court: Where did that designation originate?\n       The Witness: It designated through the government’s transit\n             security team and their site security by reviewing the\n             plans and determining an approach to transport the\n             project from our facility to its destination in Dushanbe.\n\nTr. 2397-98.\n\n       On December 10, 2003, Mr. Kosinski e-mailed Mr. Ross and other\ngovernment representatives with several attachments regarding general\nshipping plans. In a December 9, 2003 letter, which was the first attachment\nto Mr. Kosinski’s e-mail, he wrote that the attached “shipping plans have now\nbeen revised to include the specific details requested and direction provided\nby the USG [United States Government] during recent meetings and\ndiscussions on this topic.” JX 306 at 2. After briefly describing the shipping\nplans for the modules and some of the measures to be employed to ensure the\nsecurity of those designated secure modules, Mr. Kosinksi wrote that “[a]s\ndiscussed during our meeting on November 6th, the panelized sections for the\nNOB mechanical penthouse spaces and atrium areas do not need to travel with\nthe modules shipments and may follow alternate routing if desired.” JX 306\nat 3. The rest of the attachments described the plans to transport three\ndifferent groups of modules from New Jersey to Dushanbe.\n\n       Once DS certification was resolved, KI moved forward with\nconstruction of modules and panels in its warehouse in New Jersey. When\nmodules had to be manufactured securely, they were constructed by cleared\nAmerican workers under guard in a secure area of KI’s manufacturing plant.\nThere is no disagreement over the fact that the fourth-floor floor panels were\nnot constructed securely.\n\n\n                                     34\n\f        The next time that the subject of the panels was discussed was on July\n12, 2004, when Wayne Algire, the Site Security Manager, became concerned\nthat the fourth floor panels were not included in the secure shipments. He e-\nmailed Charles “Chick” Little, Mr. Algire’s Desk Officer and point of contact\nwithin the Washington, DC office of OBO, and Charles Kuehne, Senior Desk\nOfficer for Central Asia and team leader for security procedures at DOS, JX\n541 at 12, asking, “As there are no more secure shipments, that I am aware of,\nhow is this stuff getting here[?] . . . Is the fourth floor south wing not CAA,\njust contiguous with the CAA?” JX 541 at 13. Mr. Little responded that,\nalthough he had to reference the drawings18 before he gave a final answer, he\ncould advise that, “IF it is for the CAA, it needs to be securely purchased and\nshipped, unless it can be randomly selected at 25% or less out of the whole of\nthe exact same item. If it is for non-CAA, no restrictions.” JX 541 at 12.\n\n       Then, Ms. Wilkins added the following to the e-mail chain:\n\n       The Fourth Floor immediately above the CAA on the south wing\n       of the building has full height parapet walls. The enclosed area\n       is partially open to the sky. Those walls were not shipped\n       secure. They cannot be randomly selected from other stock as\n       they are custom. They have already shipped (non-secure) and\n       will be here within a few days. Please advise whether we should\n       allow them to be installed.\n\nJX 541 at 11. Mr. Algire agreed with Ms. Wilkins’ assessment and wrote to\nMr. Little and Ms. Wilkins, “The steel as I read the drawings is for the CAA\non the fourth floor above the CAA on the second and third floor of the CAA\nsouth wing.” JX 541 at 8.\n\n       On July 20, 2004, Mr. Little provided his answer as follows:\n\n             I have looked at the drawings for this. I have also talked\n       with Sharmeena [Salam-Haughton]. . . .\n\n              ....\n\n              This fourth floor for the South side is a “penthouse” a\n\n\n18\n  These design drawings of the CAA were also classified and not produced for\nour inspection at trial.\n\n                                      35\n\f       “mechanical penthouse”. Yes, it is covered. Why? We do this\n       sometimes. All the equipment that goes into this area is\n       procured and shipped non-secure.\n\n               This area is completely a non-CAA area. For\n       construction, this means locals with CSTs [Construction\n       Surveillance Technicians], since it is General Work area. . . .\n       Since the floor is contiguous, the the [sic] installation of the\n       floor slab itself should be by cleared Americans.\n\n               I hope this resolves the issues about the fourth floor.\n       This is rather normal for all NECs [New Embassy Compounds]\n       as far as how the area is constructed. In actuality, for NECs at\n       the same level as yours, general construction, which includes the\n       floor and ceiling slabs, can be done by locals under CST\n       surveillance, so in essence requiring Cleared Americans for\n       doing the slab is a step above what occurs on normal stick build\n       projects.\n\nJX 541 at 2.\n\n       The fourth-floor floor steel panels arrived in Dushanbe sometime\nbetween July 22 and August 20, 2004, after being constructed and shipped\nnon-securely. Once the panels arrived, KI began installing them. KI was able\nto begin installing the panels in August of 2004 because, at this time, all of the\nmodules for the South side of the NOB, the side that housed the CAA, were\nin place. JX 71 at 1 (OBO Project Director’s June 2004 Report); JX 48 at 129\n(Expert Demonstrative showing the sequence in which each module and panel\nwas set in place); Tr. 934 (Allen). Mr. Allen testified that “[t]he area had –\naround the building had been completely backfilled because we had set all the\nmodules. We wouldn’t have been able to set all the modules if we weren’t\ncompletely backfilled.” Tr. 935. We find Mr. Allen to be a credible witness.\nKI had installed 6 fourth-floor floor panels when it was ordered to stop work.\n\n        On August 20, the CO wrote to Mr. Rand to notify him that KI was\nresponsible for rectifying what he viewed as a security breach in accordance\nwith direction from OBO. The issue was framed in the following manner:\n“[T]he third floor modules were fabricated and shipped without the required\nsteel plating. Instead, the third floor ceiling steel plating was fabricated as part\nof the fourth floor modules. The fourth floor (penthouse) modules were\nfabricated and shipped, unsecured, and cannot be used as part of the third\n\n\n                                        36\n\ffloor.” JX 611 at 1. In response, KI asserted that it had followed the OBO\napproved plans for secure manufacturing and shipping. Ms. Salam-Haughton\nfollowed up on August 26, 2004, with potential mitigation strategies suggested\nby OBO.\n\n        Mitigation involved inspection of the panels; OBO sent a security team\nto conduct the inspection on site from September 17 - 28, 2004. There were\n36 panels in total, some of which were stored in the secure storage area and six\nof which were already installed in the main embassy building. In order to\ndetermine whether the panels19 had been compromised, the OBO security\nteam, with the help of KI cleared personnel, moved the panels to the inspection\narea,20 cut holes as large as 6 inches by 6 inches in the sides, top, and bottom\nof each panel so that the team could explore the interior of the panel, and then\nverified that there were no listening devices or other abnormalities. This\ninspection process “required the contractor to provide additional manpower for\ncutting holes, a heavy lift crane with operator, [and] workers to maneuver the\npanels into place.” JX 677 at 12. The OBO security team found no major\nissues or anomalies, although the team noted that there was “water in the\nmajority of roof panels.” JX 677 at 1. KI was not permitted to install the\npanels until the entire inspection was complete. Once the inspection was\ncomplete, KI was left with the work of repairing the panels. In addition, OBO\nlater insisted on the installation of additional acoustic material to protect\nagainst the possibility that the inspection had missed a listening device.\n\n       Lorri Lowther, who was returned to her former position as CO at the\nend of October 2004, gave KI written notice on November 23, 2004, to\n“immediately proceed with Phase II mitigation above the three specific areas\non the third floor.” JX 807 at 120. The parties, however, continued to seek a\nstrategy for full mitigation. On December 6, 2004, Ms. Lowther wrote the\nfollowing to Mr. Rand:\n\n       OBO agreed to four different [mitigation] options that would be\n       acceptable for Kullman to execute with the understanding that\n\n\n19\n   The panels were “3 meters x 9 meters and constructed of 6” steel tube\nframing, steel I-beam cross members dividing each panel into 9 sections, with\n6mm steel on one side and 8mm steel on the other to enclose the panels.” JX\n677 at 11.\n20\n  KI did not remove the six panels that had already been installed. They were\ninspected in place.\n\n                                      37\n\f       Kullman would propose their preferred option within the\n       following days. In discussions on December 3, 2004 with\n       Sharmeena Salam-Haughton and Eric Rumpf, we understand\n       that Kullman intends to pursue the systematic solution for Part\n       II consisting of ceiling tile, the enhanced gypboard [quiet rock]\n       and an expandable material in the voids.\n\n       This is to again advise that OBO accepts Kullman’s choice and\n       Kullman is authorized to proceed immediately with execution.\n\n       ....\n\n       This guidance is provided to Kullman Industries to mitigate\n       Kullman’s improper shipment of third floor ceiling panels. The\n       Government will not consider an equitable adjustment for either\n       time or costs . . . .\n\n       Mitigation, by definition, is not a change to the contract.\n\nJX 807 at 122-23.\n\n       Shortly after the inspections concluded, KI resumed installing the\nfourth-floor floor panels. KI finished installation of the fourth-floor floor\npanels on October 20, 2004. By the end of October, all of the modules and 12\nwall panels had been set. In November, KI installed “all remaining wall and\nfloor panels at [the] NOB.” JX 76 at 1. “[S]etting and welding steel columns\nand roof panels at NOB mechanical levels” continued into December. JX 76\nat 1. By the end of December, the roof was in place, although the roof\nmembrane was not finished, meaning that the roof was not yet fully watertight.\n\n       Joseph Allen, KI’s Site Superintendent since May 2004, testified that\nDushanbe experienced an unprecedented rainy reason, which began on\nNovember 17, 2004, and lasted into February of 2005. Because of the delay\nassociated with the CAA security concerns, KI was not able to complete the\nroof of the NOB by the time the rains began.21 As a result water infiltrated the\n\n\n21\n   Mr. Allen testified that KI was not able to get the roof installed and\nwatertight before the rains came because of the delay with the fourth-floor\nfloor panels. Once the floor panels were welded into place, KI had to install\n“wall panels that had to sit on top of those panels that made up the mechanical\n                                                                   (continued...)\n\n                                       38\n\frest of the building, which had been paneled with gypsum board. Mr. Allen\nrecalled that the building sustained water damage and subsequently mold\ndamage. He testified that KI tried “to keep up with it and replace the areas we\nknew were getting – that got damaged. But it got too extensive. It –\ntemperature was right, weather condition was right and, you know, mold just\ngrew.” Tr. 837.22 The mold issue was not unique to the NOB but also plagued\nthe other buildings being constructed at the embassy compound. See Tr. 923-\n27 (Allen) (stating that there was a minor mold problem in the gate houses and\nthat there was a mold in the Marine Security Guard Quarters).\n\n       The mold problem in the NOB grew so severe that the OBO Project\nDirector ordered KI to stop work until there was an approved mold removal\nstrategy. All of KI resources were diverted to the mold issue, and an industrial\nhygienist was brought in to assess the damage and propose a remediation\nstrategy. Mr. Allen recalled the process for removing the mold beginning with\nclosing a room and then “we’d seal off the room. So we’d seal it off. And the\nreason we did that is the industrial hygienist, when – when you pull the\nsheetrock off you can spread more mold spores.” Tr. 929. The crew bagged\nup the sheetrock that had been ripped off the walls and disposed of it off-site.\nIn order to keep track of the man hours spent on mold remediation, Mr. Allen\ncreated a spreadsheet and directed Dennis Vance, KI’s on-site Safety Manager\n\n\n21\n  (...continued)\nspace on the fourth floor.” Tr. 840. Then, KI “had to bring in all the\nmechanical equipment that went in that section into the building, and set that\nbefore we put the roof on the building.” Tr. 840 (Allen). Mr. Allen recalled\nthat it took two months to get the waterproofing “roof on even with the rain,\nwhich delayed us quite a bit.” Tr. 840. When asked if KI anticipated the\npossibility of rain or attempted to fashion a temporary roof during the rainy\nseason, Mr. Allen explained that the modules had been shipped with temporary\nroofs that had to be removed once the floor panels were installed and that KI\ntried to build a temporary roof on site but, “[i]t was like trying to tent a football\nfield.” Tr. 841-42.\n22\n  Mr. Allen contrasted the mold issue spawned by the winter rains to the\nminor amounts of mold that had been encountered in late spring 2004, which\ndeveloped during shipping. There had been a few modules that developed a\nsmall amount of mold because they had gotten wet during ocean transit. Mr.\nAllen’s team eliminated the mold in these modules by cutting out the sheet\nrock, removing the wet insulation, cleaning up the area, and replacing the\nmoldy materials with clean new materials.\n\n                                         39\n\fwho worked with the industrial hygienist, to input the hours for labor. Mold\nremediation continued throughout the spring of 2005.\n\n       On February 9, 2005, KI submitted a formal request for an equitable\nadjustment23 to cover the delay and cost of the security mitigation measures to\nWalter Cate and Robert Powell, the Division Directors in DOS’ Office of\nAcquisition Management. JX 807. In its request, KI asserted that it\n“emphatically believes that it operated within the OBO approved construction\nsecurity and transit security plans for the factory fabrication and shipment of\nthe general construction items in question.” JX 807 at 4. KI wrote the\nfollowing:\n\n       Kullman communicated its intentions regarding the secure and\n       non-secure shipment of these items with the Government\n       through multiple document revisions, product models, and in\n       meetings during the construction and transit process. At no time\n       were the steel panels identified by OBO as requiring secure\n       shipment. Additionally, each of the secure shipping plans is\n       clear as to the tentative shipping schedule, route description, and\n       a list of the items being securely shipped.\n\n       Until August 20, 2004, and despite our thorough documentation\n       of the fabrication and shipment of the modules and panelized\n       sections for the NOB, at no time was Kullman ever notified that\n       the factory fabrication or shipment plans were incorrectly\n       implemented.\n\nJX 807 at 4. Ms. Lowther eventually denied the REA on June 15, 2005, two\ndays before KI would later be terminated for default. In her letter of decision,\nMs. Lowther wrote, “I . . . disagree with your letter’s efforts to imply that OBO\nis somehow responsible for or approved the improper shipping of the third\nfloor ceiling panels.” JX 1129 at 1.\n\n       On August 18, 2010, plaintiff filed a certified claim for the additional\nsecurity work and mitigation, seeking $1,083,734.91, which includes mold\nmitigation costs for only one building: the NOB. At trial, KI reduced the\namount of the claim to $934,611.\n\n\n23\n  KI sent an initial REA for the security mitigation to the CO at the time,\nBrian Mulcahy, on September 9, 2004, which was subsequently denied by Ms.\nLowther during her second stint as CO.\n\n                                       40\n\f         D.     Finances\n\n                1.     The Audit of KI’s Geotechnical Claim\n\n       KI filed a claim on July 1, 2004, seeking $3,728,358.62 for costs\nassociated with the geotechnical work. In its claim, KI asserted various\ntheories for why it was entitled to additional compensation for the soil\nremediation efforts. First, KI reasoned that “[a]n equitable adjustment is\ndictated by the fact that the parties understood and agreed that the geotechnical\nprogram was not part of the negotiated price on May 9, 2003. . . . It is now\nunconscionable for the OBO to disingenuously assert that the negotiated price\nincluded the geotechnical programs.” JX 25 at 9. If the government did not\nunderstand KI’s position during negotiations, then KI argues that “there was\nno meeting of the minds.” JX 25 at 13. Finally, KI claimed that “the\ngovernment is obtaining the soil stabilization program without paying for it.”\nJX 25 at 14. According to KI, “the government was fully aware that Kullman\nhad not submitted and negotiated a price for the geotechnical program. In\nsimilar situations, the courts have held that the contract may be reformed in\norder to reflect the true intention of the parties . . . .” JX 25 at 14.\n\n       Faced with KI’s geotechnical claim, Ms. Lowther and John C. Sawyer,\nan attorney in the DOS Office of General Counsel, turned to the Office of\nInspector General (“OIG”). On December 1, 2004, Ms. Lowther and Mr.\nSawyer met with the OIG employees, Michelle “Mickie” Selby and August\nVan Dessel, and requested that OIG audit Kullman’s geotechnical claim\nbecause the Department of State believed that it “had paid Kullman for the\nitems that Kullman is basing its claim on.” JX 119 at 226.\n\n       Before the audit began, Robert Powell, the Division Director in the\nOffice of Acquisition Management, issued his final decision regarding KI’s\nJuly 2004 geotechnical claim on December 9, 2004.24 Mr. Powell wrote the\nfollowing with help from Lorri Lowther:\n\n         Your . . . statements make it clear that according to your claim\n         KI has not been paid for the geotechnical work which KI has\n         performed. These statements are very troubling. My staff has\n         made a thorough review of KI’s invoices to date and the\n         payments which the Government has made in response to those\n         invoices. This review indicates that KI has been paid\n\n\n24\n     KI appealed this decision on January 19, 2005. JX 119 at 990.\n\n                                       41\n\f       approximately $2,629,547.00 specifically for all geotechnical\n       work. . . . The invoices reflect that KI has billed for 100% of\n       the geotechnical work and has been paid for the billed amount\n       less contract retainage. This evidence indicates the [sic] KI\n       either believed at some point prior to raising this claim that the\n       contract provided for the cost for geotechnical work and KI was\n       properly billing for the work performed and its associated costs,\n       or KI improperly charged the government for work which was\n       not in the contract. In either case, the evidence to date is that the\n       government has already paid for all geotechnical work\n       performed . . . . My perception is that your claim for\n       $3,728,358.62 is for reimbursement for work already performed\n       and paid for. . . . Wherefore, in light of all the above facts and\n       evidence I deny your claim in its entirety.\n\nJX 26 at 9-10. Mr. Powell also pointed out that KI was required to perform its\nown geotechnical analysis and had even invoiced the government for doing so\nbefore the LBG traveled to the site in January 2003 and throughout the May\n2003 negotiations: “the Department did not once indicate that soil preparation\nwas to be taken out of the contract nor did KI claim that soil preparation was\nnot part of the their GMP Phase II proposal. . . . The only allowance mentioned\nin KI’s September 27, 2002 proposal was for transportation.” JX 26 at 4-5.\n\n        Mr. Powell’s puzzlement about the apparent conflict between the\npremise behind the REA–KI had not been paid for the additional geotechnical\nwork–with the premise behind previous progress payments–that KI had\nperformed and been paid for over $2 million in geotechnical work–is\nunderstandable. The apparent contradiction, of course, is that the contractor\nshould not have been seeking payment for work as to which it had already\nbeen paid. The contradiction is not real, however, given the explanation for\nit. As is more fully explained below in connection with how the SOV was\nused, what Mr. Powell apparently did not know is that KI, with the\nconcurrence of OBO’s Mr. Ross and Ms. Wilkins, put geotechnical work into\nthe SOV and funded it by moving money from transportation to the geotech\nline item. There seems to have been no objection by the contracting officers\nto paying invoices on this basis.\n\n       KI’s decision to budget very little for geotechnical work, of course, was\nbased on the incorrect assumption that the government had agreed in advance\nto approve a differing site condition claim for geotechnical work, up to $2\nmillion. That assumption was misguided, and as we conclude below, this\n\n\n                                        42\n\fmisunderstanding was entirely of KI’s making. Unfortunately, moreover, not\nonly did it cause KI continual financial stress throughout the contract, but it led\nto a quixotic crusade by DOS legal officers to pursue a fraud investigation of\nKI, which unnecessarily poisoned the working relationship between the\nparties.\n\n       “OIG conducted its review in Lebanon, New Jersey, from February 7\nto February 17, 2005, inclusive.” JX 119 at 55. KI provided many documents\nfor OIG to review in the course of the audit, but KI did not provide any\ninformation on its initial pricing proposal or supporting data. The auditors\nwere permitted to “identify information bearing on entitlement” to the claim.\nJX 119 at 226. As part of the audit, the OIG looked for indicators associated\nwith fraudulent claims. The auditors concluded that “[t]here was no one\nindicator present. The contractor was able to support the transactions OIG\nselected for review and we found no exceptions that would indicate fraud.”\nJX 119 at 962.\n\n     Mr. Sawyer and Ms. Lowther were privy to updates on the audit and\ncommunicated about it via e-mail. Mr. Sawyer wrote the following to Ms.\nLowther:\n\n       In reference to the audit. It appears that Kullman did bill the\n       Government for the for the [sic] Geo tech [sic] and have\n       credited it in the books. . . . Kullman put in an REA for a\n       differing site condition on the grounds that the Geotect [sic] was\n       not in the contract . . . . Subsequently Kullman billed for the\n       work as if it were in the contract and we paid the invoices. I\n       believe this counts as an action against interest on the part of\n       Kullman and acceptance of our payment constitutes payment of\n       the debt “satisfaction and accord.” For Kullman, Inc. to have\n       asked for the funds now in a[] claim before the GSBCA I think\n       constitutes a false claim.\n\nJX 811 at 2. Ms. Lowther responded,\n\n       WOW! You never want to believe that anyone could do\n       something like this, but if it had to be one of our contractors\n       then Kullman is the one who I would believe it of. You’re right\n       Kullman did first come in with the REA claiming that Geotech\n       was not part of the contract . . . . Once Kullman received the\n       denial of the REA, they started billing the government . . . .\n\n\n                                        43\n\fJX 811 at 1. We find this professed ignorance of what KI was doing to be\ninexcusable. If Ms. Lowther was genuinely surprised that KI had been given\npermission to move money from transportation to geotech, then she had not\nbeen properly briefed about events prior to her tenure as contracting officer.\n\n        A draft of the OIG audit report was issued in March of 2005. On\nMarch 11, 2005, August Van Dessel e-mailed a draft of the Kullman Claim\nReport to Fay Ropella and Alma Wolfe. JX 119 at 44. The e-mail receipt\nshows that both Ms. Ropella and Ms. Wolfe received and read the draft on this\ndate. The March 11, 2005 draft did not contain any financial figures or\nconclusions, however. Mr. Van Dessel sent another draft to Ms. Wolfe on\nMarch 21, 2005. This draft included the following assessment: “Our audit\ndetermined that Kullman had, through February 16, 2005, incurred $3,523,728\nof costs related to the claim and $11,040,1[2]3 [sic] related to transportation\ncosts.” JX 119 at 51. On April 7, 2005, Mr. Van Dessel e-mailed Mr. Lefkus\na draft of the Audit Report for review and comment.\n\n        The draft of the audit report contained in JX 119 includes changes\nproposed by KI in an e-mail dated April 11, 2005. This draft contained the\nfollowing language, which was ultimately omitted from the final report: “We\nalso determined that the claimed amounts were reasonable, allocable and\notherwise allowable in accordance with the terms and conditions of the\ncontract and with the cost principles set forth in Part 31 of the Federal\nAcquisition Regulation (FAR).” JX 119 at 59. Mr. Van Dessel also inserted\nthis sentence that was provided by KI, “The Modification of the schedule of\nvalues was a cooperative and open effort between OBO and Kullman. The\n‘shifting of funds’ in the schedule never increased the fixed lump sum contract\nand the Contractor only did this after communication and guidance.” JX 119\nat 62. Mr. Van Dessel testified that when Mr. Sawyer was informed of the\ncontents of the draft audit report, he was visibly upset and annoyed. He was\nalso annoyed that KI had been given an advanced draft of the report and been\nasked to comment on it.\n\n        On June 15, 2005, OIG held a meeting of department officials regarding\nthe review of the claim submitted by KI. Mark Duda, Karen Holcomb, Alma\nWolfe, Michelle Selby, Lorri Lowther, John Sawyer, and Dennis Gallagher\nattended this meeting. “Mr. Sawyer prefaced the discussions by thanking OIG\nfor the draft report.” JX 119 at 144. “Ms. Lowther informed all that OBO was\ntaking over the job with the expectation of building what could be done in 60\ndays.” JX 119 at 144. “Ms. Lowther stated that she was receiving calls from\n\n\n                                      44\n\fKullman subcontractors regarding them not being paid by Kullman. Ms.\nLowther was concerned due to the fact that Kullman is certifying on their\nvouchers that the subcontractors have been paid for their work.” JX 119 at\n145. “Mr. Sawyer is hoping DOJ will try the False Claim.” JX 119 at 145.\n“Mr. Sawyer stated that the OIG draft report released to Kullman for their\ncomments was being paraded through the halls of Congress and that it was\nlikely that OIG would be called into court to testify on behalf of Kullman.” JX\n119 at 145.\n\n       The Office of Inspector General’s “Report of Audit” is dated July 2005.\nIts purpose:\n\n       to determine whether amounts claimed were: (1) substantiated\n       as having been incurred; and (2) were reasonable, allocable, and\n       otherwise allowable in accordance with the terms and conditions\n       of the contract and with the cost principles set forth in Part 31 of\n       the Federal Acquisitions Regulation (FAR). OIG extended the\n       scope of its review to include transportation costs incurred by\n       Kullman through February 9, 2005, because Kullman had\n       adjusted this item from $12 million to $8.8 million to provide\n       funding to bill for geotechnical costs.\n\nJX 118 at 3. OIG judgmentally selected and tested 82.8%, or $2,552,278, of\nthe geotechnical costs claimed and 82.4%, or $9,094,366, of transportation\ncosts. For both the geotechnical and transportation costs, OIG found adequate\nsupport for costs tested and noted no exceptions. In sum, the audit confirmed\nKI’s costs with respect to the geotechnical claim. There was nothing deceptive\nabout the claim, moreover, because KI knew that the agency was taking the\nposition that the additional geotechnical work was not part of the contract and\ncould only become part of the contract through a REA. If the claim had been\nsuccessful, monies would have been added to the contract and funds\npresumably would have been restored to the transportation budget.\n\n              2.      Kullman Industries’ Financial Practices\n\n                      a.     The Procedure for Obtaining a Progress Payment\n\n       Despite its financial problems, KI continued to work on the Dushanbe\nproject and to seek payment from the government. In order to receive a\nperiodic payment under the contract for overhead, profit, and “the value of\nlabor and materials completed and in place,” JX 1 at 61, KI would submit an\n\n\n                                       45\n\finvoice, including a certification, to DOS based on the percent of the work\ncompleted compared to the SOV.\n\n                             i.     The Schedule of Values\n\n        Much like a project budget, the SOV was a list comprised of line items\nthat each corresponded to a particular task or activity required to complete the\ncontract. Jt. Stip. ¶ 40; Tr. 1378 (Rand) (“[T]here are no subcontractors or\nsuppliers listed on our invoices to the government, only activities.”). The\ncontract price was allocated among these various line items, such that the\nestimated amounts stated for all the line items added up to the contract price.\nTogether these various line items, and dollar estimates allocated to them,\ncorresponded to the SOV. As Mr. Farley, the on-site DOS Project Director,\ntestified, “[a] schedule of values is basically a breakdown of the contract price\nor contract value into its component parts to assist in the payment process.”25\nTr. 209. Specifically, the SOV “breaks the large contract sum of $60 plus\nmillion down into digestible pieces that you can actually evaluate and assign\npercentages of completion against each of the line items in the schedule of\nvalues and arrive at a total for the month.” Tr. 209 (Farley); see JX 57 at 15.\n\n     Arriving at the monthly percent completion for each line item on the\nSOV was a collaborative process between KI and DOS.26 Mr. Kosinski, KI’s\n\n\n25\n  This understanding of the SOV is consistent with the definition in the\ncontract, which provides:\n\n       The Schedule of Values is a tabulation of cost-loaded work\n       elements or activities as defined in the Contractor’s project\n       execution schedule to include all design, construction, and all\n       other cost elements of the project. The Schedule of Values shall\n       segregate major project elements to reflect design and\n       construction costs for each major building and area of the\n       project.\n\nJX 57 at 15.\n26\n   Mr. Farley gave the following explanation of how the parties would arrive\nat the percent of work completed:\n\n       Essentially a contractor would sit down and go through the\n                                                           (continued...)\n\n                                       46\n\fon-site Project Manager, who was part of that collaborative process, explained\nthat because the SOV was an estimate made at the beginning of the job, the\nvalue of each line item did not always match what eventually was spent on\naccomplishing that task. He testified that “there weren’t direct one-for-one\ncorrelations between everything. Once we actually got to the construction\nphase, you know, the – the design was developed further along and there were\naspects of the construction work that weren’t directly identified or addressed\non the schedule of values.” Tr. 750-51 (Kosinski). One of the illustrations of\nthis lack of precision has been discussed previously, namely, that “[i]n the fall\nof 2003, DOS and Kullman agreed that the SOV would be modified to add line\nitems specific to the geotech work by reallocating $3 million from the\ntransportation line item to the new geotech line items, so that the total contract\nprice did not change.” Jt. Stip. ¶ 40.\n\n        This collaborative effort to move transportation monies into the\ngeotechnical item had the beneficial effect, at least for KI, of giving it money\nup front to cover its actual geotechnical expenses. The unfortunate collateral\neffect of doing so, however, was to camouflage a fundamental disagreement,\nnamely, whether the geotechnical work was covered by the fixed price. By\nmoving $3 million from transportation to geotechnical, KI financed its earlier\nactivities, but it merely postponed the pain of running into the cap on a fixed\n\n\n26\n (...continued)\n       schedule of values and would mark up what he felt he was\n       entitled to be paid for that month, [and] submit it to our office.\n\n       Our engineers would review the various line items as proposed\n       that concern their particular discipline, check off on them or not.\n       And then I would review it, would pass it back to the contractor.\n       The way that we would do this is through an informal discussion\n       if we had disagreements with percentages or amounts that were\n       complete or not complete.\n\n       They would submit it to us. We would review it. We would\n       then discuss and resolve any differences that we may have. It\n       would go back to the contractor, who would then submit a clean\n       copy. We would review it to make sure it agreed with the\n       agreements that we had made. I would sign it, and that would\n       be the payment.\n\nTr. 210-11.\n\n                                       47\n\fprice contract.\n\n                                ii.     The Certifications\n\n        When it submitted invoices, in addition to attaching the relevant portion\nof the SOV, KI was required27 to make certain certified representations. The\nprecise wording of that certification varied over the life of the contract, but the\ncertification relevant to the government’s fraud claim was that it “has made\nfull payment from the proceeds of prior payments,” and that it “will make\ntimely payment from the proceeds of the progress or final payment for which\nrequest is being made, to [the] subcontractors and suppliers in accordance with\n[its] contractual arrangements with them.” JX 1 a t 61.28\n\n\n27\n  The contract incorporates by reference FAR 52.232-5(c) (1997) and FAR\n52.232-27 (Prompt payment for subs). The former states that,\n\n         Along with each request for progress payment, the Contractor\n         shall furnish the following certification, or payment shall not be\n         made: (However, if the Contractor elects to delete paragraph\n         (c)(4) from the certification, the certification is still acceptable.)\n\n         I here by certify, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that –\n                 (1) The amounts requested are only for performance in\n         accordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the\n         contract;\n                 (2) Payments to subcontractors and suppliers have been\n         made from previous payments received under the contract, and\n         timely payments will be made from the proceeds of the payment\n         covered by this certification, in accordance with subcontract\n         agreements and the requirements of chapter 39 of Title 31,\n         United States Code;\n                 (3) This request for progress payments does not include\n         any amounts which the prime contractor intends to withhold or\n         retain from a subcontractor or supplier in accordance with the\n         terms and conditions of the subcontract; and\n                 (4) This certification is not to be construed as final\n         acceptance of a subcontractor’s performance.\n\n28\n     The form and content of the progress payment application was directed by\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                          48\n\f        KI’s initial invoices pertaining to the Dushanbe project did not include\nany certification. Then, on November 13, 2003, Eduardo Gaarder, the Chief\nof the European and Eurasian Branch of the Construction and Commissioning\nDivision of OBO, contacted Mr. Rand about KI’s pending application and\ncertification for payment. Mr. Gaarder sent Mr. Rand two example pay\napplication forms, noting in particular the importance of the certification. KI\nbegan using the following certification from one of the examples provided:\n\n       The undersigned Contractor certifies that to the best of the\n       Contractor’s knowledge, information and belief of Work\n       covered by this Application for Payment has been completed in\n       accordance with the Contract Documents, that all amounts have\n       been paid by the Contractor for Work for which previous\n       Certificated for Payment were issued and payments received\n       from the Owner, and that current payment shown herein is now\n       due.\n\nJX 288 at 2.\n\n       At the end of March 2004, Catherine Wilkins, the DOS Project\nDirector, Sharmeena Salam-Haughton, the OBO Project Executive, and Mr.\nGaarder indicated to Mr. Rand their view that the certification was not explicit\nenough regarding payments made to subcontractors and suppliers. Mr.\nGaarder e-mailed Mr. Rand with an acceptable certification, which Mr. Rand\nbegan using on KI’s subsequent pay applications. Consequently, during the\nperiod of May 2004 through April 2005, KI submitted invoices that bore the\nfollowing certification:\n\n       I hereby certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that\n       –\n       (1) The amounts requested are only for performance in\n       accordance with the specifications, terms, and conditions of the\n       contract[;] (2) All payments due to subcontractors and suppliers\n       from previous payments received under the contract have been\n\n\n       28\n        (...continued)\nthe Project Director. JX 1513 at 84 (Division I of the contract documents)\n(“The Project Director shall provide to the Contractor an example form,\n[which] . . . . shall delineate information required for each application [for\nprogress payment]. The Contractor shall comply with format as directed . . .\nby the Project Director.”).\n\n                                       49\n\f       made, and timely payments will be made from the proceeds of\n       the payment covered by this certification, in accordance with\n       subcontract agreements and the requirements of chapter 39 of\n       Title 31, United States Code; (3) This request for progress\n       payments does not include any amounts which the prime\n       contractor intends to withhold or retain from a subcontractor or\n       supplier in accordance with the terms and conditions of the\n       subcontract; and (4) This certification is not to be construed as\n       final acceptance of a subcontractor’s performance.\n\nJt. Stip. ¶ 42; JX 999 at 1.\n\n      Each of the invoices at issue were prepared and certified by Alan Rand.\nMr. Rand, whom the court found to be a straightforward witness, testified that\nhe understood that “[t]he certification meant that we were paying suppliers in\naccordance with the contracts with the government. And also the fact that the\nmoney coming in for the project was being spent on the project.” Tr. 1267.\nMr. Rand further explained that,\n\n       I was certifying that the money that the government was paying\n       Kullman was being used to pay its sub and suppliers, but once\n       that money ran out there may have been more subs and suppliers\n       that still needed to be paid. But that the money came in from the\n       government, that money was used to pay whatever subs and\n       suppliers could be paid. And, in fact, Kullman paid out more\n       money than they [sic] had received from the government by the\n       end of the project in May or June.\n\nTr. 1453-54. Mr. Rand admitted he was aware that, toward the end of the\nproject, KI had to juggle payments to subcontractors and suppliers and that\nBelcor, Inc. (“Belcor”), the supplier of parts related to the fuel distribution\nsystem, had not been fully paid. Despite this, Mr. Rand believed that he was\ntruthful in signing the certification because all of the money received from\neach progress payment was used to pay subcontractors and suppliers. KI was\nretaining no funds for itself, but it was doing triage in terms of paying some,\nbut not all, of the amounts owed.\n\n                      b.       KI’s Dealings with Belcor, Inc.\n\n      KI initially ordered tanks and accessories from Belcor in February of\n2004. This first order totaled $170,259, and the term for payment was “NET\n\n\n                                        50\n\f30,” which according to Mr. Bell, meant that Belcor would invoice KI for the\nitems once they were delivered and KI agreed to pay Belcor within 30 days of\nreceiving Belcor’s invoice. Delivery of the tanks and accessories was\nscheduled for June 30, 2004.\n\n       The items supplied by Belcor, including fuel tanks, day tanks, and their\naccessories, correspond with line item “STF 1074 Fab Fuel tanks, piping &\nship to port” on the SOV. JX 640 at 6; see Tr. 236 (Farley). Of the total\ncontract funds, $435,074 was designated for this line item.\n\n        Belcor sent KI the first invoice on May 5, 2004, in the amount of\n$43,475 for items delivered in accordance with the first purchase order. KI\npaid this invoice in full on July 12, 2004, which was more than 30 days from\nthe date of the invoice but before KI billed DOS for any work attributable to\nline item STF 1074. On June 29, 2004, Belcor sent KI a second invoice for\n$27,808.16 for more items requested in the first purchase order. KI paid this\nbill in full on August 23, 2004, which was again more than 30 days from the\ndate of the invoice but before KI billed DOS for any work attributable to line\nitem STF 1074. Belcor sent two more invoices to KI in the month of August:\nAugust 9, 2004, in the amount of $76,855 and August 25, 2004, in the amount\nof $22,120.90. These two invoices, together totaling $98,975.90, remained\nunpaid until January 2005.\n\n       KI first requested reimbursement for work performed under line item\nSTF 1074 through invoice No. 13220, which covered work performed on the\nproject through August 31, 2004. KI requested half of the funds from this line\nitem and received the requested amount, $217,537, as part of the periodic\npayment29 DOS approved on September 22, 2004. The parties stipulated that\nKI received the funds from invoice No. 13220 on October 14, 2004. On\nDecember 10, 2004, KI requested payment for the remainder of line item STF\n1074 as part of invoice No. 13386, which covered work performed through\nNovember 30, 2004. Invoice No. 13386 contained the certification. DOS\napproved the payment30 on December 21, 2004, but KI did not receive the\nfunds until January 6, 2005. As of January 6, 2005, KI had received the full\namount of contract funds designated in the SOV for prefabricated tanks.\n\n         On December 27, 2004, Robert B. Bell, President of Belcor, wrote the\n\n\n29\n     DOS did not withhold retainage from this payment.\n30\n     Again, DOS did not elect to withhold retainage from this payment.\n\n                                      51\n\ffollowing in a letter to KI:\n\n       Belcor, Inc. has two invoices outstanding on this project totaling\n       $98,975.90 (copies attached), both of these are now out 120\n       days with no payment received. The terms on []your PO clearly\n       state “Net 30”.\n\n       Numerous calls to Kullman by Belcor have gone unanswered.\n       No response, no call backs, no payments. Belcor, Inc. is, as you\n       know, a small business, and this lack of payment is creating\n       undo financial hardship on our company.\n\n       I would appreciate a response from Kullman Industries, but\n       more importantly, fulfilment of the contract obligations by make\n       [sic] payment.\n\nJX 721 at 1. This letter began a series of communications between Mr. Bell\nand KI employees.\n\n      Andy Linkowsky, an employee in KI’s purchasing department,\nresponded via e-mail on December 31, 2004, providing a contact telephone\nnumber and informing Mr. Bell that Mr. Rand and Stuart Frieman, the Chief\nFinancial Officer, had been made aware of Mr. Bell’s letter and that someone\nfrom KI would contact Mr. Bell within a few business days. On January 10,\n2005, Mr. Freiman sent an e-mail to Mr. Pearson, Mr. Lefkus, and Mr.\nKullman that contained the following:\n\n       As per our discussion on Saturday, we are sending Belcor 10M\n       towards the 100M we owe them. I spoke to Bob Bell of Belcor\n       this morning to discuss the same. Given that we are\n       acknowledging the debt and are sending them 10M, he remained\n       sane.\n\nJX 734. As promised, KI paid Belcor $10,000 on January 13, 2005. Although\nBelcor received this payment, Mr. Bell wrote to Ms. Lowther on January 13\nto inform her of the remaining unpaid invoices.\n\n        After making the $10,000 payment, KI requested additional supplies\nfrom Belcor. In response, Belcor provided a price estimate and indicated its\nwillingness to provide the additional items but wrote in a January 18 letter that\nfulfilling the order would be a problem because “Kullman Industries is on\n\n\n                                       52\n\fcredit hold with Belcor, Inc. due to a past due balance of $88,000.00 which is\nover 5 months past due. Without resolution of this outstanding obligation . .\n. Belcor, Inc. cannot authorize further shipments of materials.” JX 745. On\nJanuary 20, 2005, Mr. Rand e-mailed Mr. Freiman the following message:\n\n       Stu,\n\n       KI owes Belcor approximately $88,000. We need to order an\n       additional $10,000 (approximately) worth of materials. Thus,\n       our total outstanding debt with Belcor will soon be $98,000.\n\n       I spoke to Bob Bell today. He has agreed to continue to sell us\n       materials, etc. However, he is looking for some type of payment\n       plan. The $88,000 is a very large open receivable for his firm.\n\n       I have agreed to pay him $20,000 within the next seven to ten\n       days. This will reduce his debt to effectively $78,000. From\n       that point we need some general understanding of a payment\n       plan that he can expect.\n\n       Please plug the $20,000 commitment into your calculations for\n       cash flow, etc.\n\nJX 757.31\n\n       On January 21, 2005, KI issued a purchase order to Belcor for filler,\npipe, couplings, and an adhesive kit totaling $8,858.75. KI sent Belcor another\npayment of $10,000 on January 25, 2005. Two days later, KI ordered from\nBelcor another $1,878 worth of supplies, including straps for securing the\ntanks.\n\n        Daniel Jordan, a KI project manager assigned to the Dushanbe project,\ne-mailed Mr. Freiman on February 2, 2005, with a list of creditors “to be paid,”\none of which was Belcor. JX 779. Mr. Jordan wrote, “we owe [Belcor]\n$78,975.90, but pay whatever we can spare. Bob Bell has bent over backwards\nto get his material on our recent air shipment.” JX 779. Mr. Rand was copied\non this e-mail. KI paid Belcor $10,000 on February 7, 2005. The next day,\n\n\n31\n   Mr. Freiman’s response to Mr. Rand was less than enthusiastic as he\nquestioned “who authorized you to make a commitment for $ without talking\nto me.” JX 757.\n\n                                      53\n\fBelcor sent KI invoice No. 34073 in the amount of $9,475.97. On February\n23, 2005, Belcor invoiced KI another $465 and KI paid Belcor another\n$10,000. KI made a $5,000 payment to Belcor on March 22, 2005.\n\n       On April 18, 2005, Mr. Bell sent an e-mail to Mr. Linkowsky at KI\nchecking on the status of payment. KI paid Belcor another $5,000 the\nfollowing day. This was the final payment that KI would make to Belcor. The\nbalance remaining at that time was $60,869.\n\n                       c.     The Government’s Knowledge Of KI’s Position\n\n       Before KI fell behind on its payments to Belcor, it notified the\ngovernment of its financial problems, which KI attributed to difficulties with\nthe Dushanbe project. See JX 303 (KI informed the government of its\nprecarious financial position and that “subcontractors struggle with large\noutstanding balances for work that has already been performed and approved”\nas early as December 5, 2003). On April 30, 2004, Mr. Lefkus sent Ms.\nLowther a letter in response to an April 13 meeting attended by Ms. Lowther,\nMr. Lefkus, and Mr. Rand. In the letter, Mr. Lefkus lists “Contractor’s Out-\nof-Pocket” unpaid expenses for which the agency was withholding payment,\nincluding the costs for geotechnical work, two unpaid invoices, and another\ntransportation invoice, which totaled over $9.5 million. JX 475 at 2. Mr.\nLefkus also pointed out that KI faced an additional $6.5 million in “Immediate\nFuture Obligations.” JX 475 at 2. In light of these unreimbursed expenses,\nMr. Lefkus informed Ms. Lowther that “[t]he project economics simply do not\nwork for Kullman . . . . [because of] the severity of these economic issues.”\nJX 475 at 2. Mr. Lefkus conceded that “[t]he resources to float this amount of\nmoney simply do not exist.” JX 475 at 2. To address this situation, KI sought\n“a reasonable remedy where OBO can feel it maintains appropriate security\nwhile the project funding ensures robust performance.” JX 475 at 2.\n\n       In a June 2, 2004 e-mail Mr. Lefkus once again stressed the importance\nof a meeting between officials from KI and the government to discuss the cash\nflow from the Dushanbe project. Mr. Lefkus sent this e-mail to Walter Cate,\nthe Division Director in the DOS Bureau of Acquisitions and copied Mr. Rand\nand Mr. Kullman. Mr. Cate forwarded the original e-mail to Mr. Powell,\ndirecting him to set up a meeting including Ms. Lowther. Ms. Lowther\nresponded internally to Mr. Powell and Mr. Cate on June 3, 2004,32 that she\n\n\n32\n     As of June 3, 2004, KI had received the first invoice from Belcor and was\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                       54\n\fdid not believe a meeting would prove useful until KI provided “HARD\nDATA,” in writing, to “back-up their wild accusations” especially in light of\nthe fact that the contract was almost a year behind schedule, that there were\nongoing security issues, and that “[w]e have subcontractors that have not been\npaid.” JX 521 at 1.\n\n       Additionally, Ms. Lowther testified at trial that subcontractors and\nsuppliers called her and sent her letters informing her that KI had not paid for\nwork performed on, or supplies provided for, the Dushanbe project. See JX\n1495 (November 18, 2004 letter sent by Ms. Lowther to Mr. Rand informing\nhim that York International Corporation (“York”) had complained to her about\nKI’s failure to pay in full); see also JX 692 (Mr. Rand’s November 22, 2004\nresponse asserting that KI had paid York substantially more money than DOS\nhad paid KI for line items attributable to work performed by York).33\n\n       Despite these facts, Ms. Lowther maintained at trial that KI did not\nnotify DOS that it was withholding payment from Belcor. According to Ms.\nLowther, notification under the contract was a formal process. Ms. Lowther\npointed to the fact that KI formally notified her, via e-mail, of its intent to\nwithhold funds from Greenway Enterprises due to a dispute with the\nsubcontractor. Mr. Rand did,34 in fact, notify Ms. Lowther and Ms. Salam-\nHaughton in writing that KI was withholding funds from Greenway\nEnterprises because that subcontractor was being terminated for default.\n\n       As a practical matter, however, by January 13, 2005, Ms. Lowther\nclearly knew that KI had not fully paid Belcor because Mr. Bell wrote to Ms.\nLowther informing her of the situation. Ms. Lowther responded to Mr. Bell\n\n\n32\n  (...continued)\nwithin the “NET 30” period for payment. KI did not invoice the government\nfor line item STF 1074 until August 31, 2004, but paid Belcor’s two initial\ninvoices by August 23, 2004.\n33\n  Ms. Lowther testified that her role was limited to communicating with KI\nabout alleged shortfalls in payment to suppliers or subcontractors. She\ntypically did not investigate such allegations but would turn them over to her\nsupervisor and the Office of Inspector General.\n34\n  According to Mr. Rand, this notification was required under the certification\nbecause Greenway Enterprises was a major subcontractor on the project and\nKI was anticipating major shortfalls due to the issues with Greenway.\n\n                                      55\n\fin a February 3, 2005 letter by summarizing the applicable regulations, noting\nthat the “government is not privy to the information contained in any prime-\nsubcontract agreements” and was therefore not involved in the dispute,\npointing to the contract between KI and Belcor as the “key document” for\ndetermining whether KI was within its rights to withhold funds, and assuring\nMr. Bell that she would remind KI of its obligation to pay subcontractors and\nsuppliers. JX 782. On the same day, Ms. Lowther sent a letter to KI\nreminding it that “[o]fficial notification must be provided to the subcontractor\nand the Contracting Officer in order to fulfill these requirements [under the\nFAR] or else payment must be made.” JX 783 at 1. Ms. Lowther also\nforwarded to KI her response to Mr. Bell.\n\n       While KI did not respond in writing, it did attempt to address the issue\nin person. Ms. Lowther recorded the interaction in an e-mail she sent to Mr.\nSawyer:\n\n       Today was the site meeting and both Mr. Rand and I attended\n       the meeting and we were both very professional. However, in\n       the meeting they just couldn’t help themselves knowing, I was\n       in the room and they starting [sic] complaining how they\n       couldn’t pay their subcontractors because the government owed\n       them money for Geotech, Mitigation and blah, blah, blah.\n\nJX 811 at 1. After this, KI continued to submit certified invoices through the\nspring of 2005,35 and the agency continued to pay them.\n\n        After KI’s April 2005 payment of $5,000, Belcor continued pressing KI\nto satisfy the outstanding balance of $60,869. Mr. Bell called KI, he e-mailed,\nand he threatened to get DOS involved; all to no avail. Although Mr. Bell did\nnot know it at the time, during May through July of 2005, KI was winding\ndown construction on the Dushanbe project and preparing to abandon the job.\n\nIV.    Termination for Default\n\n       A.     Final Efforts\n\n       Toward the end of the contract, KI sought additional funds from the\n\n\n35\n  Invoice No. 13442 was submitted on February 1, 2005, Invoice No. 13493\nwas submitted on March 2, 2005, Invoice No. 13561 was submitted on April\n11, 2005, and Invoice No. 13647 was submitted on May 12, 2005.\n\n                                      56\n\fgovernment and from private sources to ameliorate the project deficit caused\nby the accumulation of several issues: the geotechnical work, the security and\nmold mitigation issue, and retainage.\n\n               1.    KI Petitions Ms. Lowther for Return of Retainage\n\n        KI formally petitioned Mr. Cate and Mr. Powell to return a portion of\nthe retained funds on February 18, 2005. On behalf of KI, Mr. Rand wrote,\n\n       Over the course of the past twelve months Kullman Industries\n       has been promised a reduction in the current high amount of\n       retainage held on the Dushanbe NEC project initially based\n       upon our ability to successfully transport the modules from our\n       Lebanon, NJ fabrication site to the Dushanbe NEC site. In fact,\n       we were promised a pro-rata reduction in the retainage based\n       upon successful monthly arrivals of the modules in Dushanbe.\n       Despite successfully delivering the modules to the site, the\n       retainage was never reduced. Subsequently, we were promised\n       a reduction in retainage based upon the completion and\n       submission of a ‘final’ Geotech report. Attached, please see a\n       copy of the final Geotech report.\n\n       I trust that we are now at a point where the retainage on this\n       project can be reduced to a more appropriate level given the fact\n       that Kullman Industries is approximately 87% complete with the\n       project, and to a level that more accurately reflects any\n       remaining risk that OBO deems required.\n\nJX 826 at 1.\n\n       Ms. Lowther denied this request on March 4, stating that it was the\nCO’s right under FAR 52.232-5 to retain up to 10% of the contract value when\nthe contractor had not made adequate or satisfactory progress. JX 863 at 1\n(“The promises Kullman references that were made last year to reduce the\nretainage were based on the successful transporting of the modules, significant\nprogress of work and development of an accurate completion schedule. To\ndate, Kullman has not demonstrated significant progress.”). Ms. Lowther did\nnot mention liquidated damages as a justification for withholding the\npreviously retained funds.\n\n\n\n\n                                      57\n\f              2.     KI’s Attempt to Obtain Private Funding\n\n      In February of 2005, KI began an effort to borrow approximately\n$2,000,000 from Tatonka Capital Corporation (“Tatonka”). By May 5, 2005,\nKI and Tatonka had worked out the terms of a loan.\n\n       Carol Hansen, Tatonka’s Chief Executive Officer, contacted Ms.\nLowther “for confirmation of the Dushanbe numbers.” JX 1007 at 1. After\nspeaking to Ms. Lowther, Ms. Hansen called Mr. Kullman and informed him\nthat Tatonka could not go through with the loan. According to Mr. Kullman,\nMs. Hansen told him that “Lorri told her that my money was being held for\nretainage, that there was mold litigation going on, I was never going to get\nretainage, and, you know, things weren’t in too good shape.” Tr. 1823.\nFollowing this telephone conversation, Mr. Kullman e-mailed Ms. Hansen\nwith a draft letter memorializing what she had told him about her conversation\nwith Ms. Lowther and asked her to sign and send the letter to KI if she agreed\nwith the content. Ms. Hansen agreed with the content and sent the letter on\nMay 13, 2005, which detailed her conversation with Ms. Lowther and formally\ndenied KI’s request for funding. Ms. Hansen wrote to Mr. Kullman, “While\nMs. Lowther confirmed the retainage amount you indicated, she stated that\nKullman was involved with mold litigation and that liquidated damages would\nbe assessed. While you made us aware of the geotech claim, these undisclosed\nissues prevent us from moving forward.” JX 1007 at 1.\n\n       When asked at trial about her conversation with Ms. Hansen, Ms.\nLowther maintained her position that the government was assessing liquidated\ndamages but admitted that she knew there was no litigation involving the mold\nmitigation.\n\n     After failing to secure private funding, KI wrote the following to Ms.\nLowther:\n\n       In an effort to keep the project moving despite excessive funds\n       being retained, Kullman sought financing. However, when a\n       representative of the financing institution contacted you\n       regarding the status of the project, you incorrectly stated that\n       there was mold litigation, and that you were withholding funds\n       due to that litigation. This misstatement caused the financing\n       institution to retract its offer of financing to Kullman. In\n       addition, the financing institution was advised that liquidated\n       damages were being assessed. We have no knowledge of any\n\n\n                                     58\n\f       assessment of liquidated damages. Whether it was your\n       intention or not, you certainly damaged Kullman’s financial\n       resources, which may affect the completion of the project.\n\nJX 1031 at 2 (KI’s response to the government’s cure notice).\n\n              3.     KI Meets with DOS Officials in a Final Attempt to\n                     Obtain Funding\n\n        After exhausting options for private funding, KI once again approached\nthe government in an attempt to convince it to release all or part of the money\nthat it had retained on the contract. Mr. Kullman testified that he contacted\nGeneral Williams, congressmen, senators, and even “Arlen Specter to go to\nConnie Rice who was the head of the State Department.” Tr. 1522-23.\nEventually, Mr. Kullman got in touch with Mr. Prior, the Construction and\nCommissioning Director at OBO within DOS. Mr. Prior set up a meeting that\noccurred in May of 2005. Mr. Kullman recalled the following:\n\n       So then I speak to Mr. Prior, and he’s, you know, he speaks to\n       General Williams. And he says, General Williams is upset\n       about the whole thing and he’s upset how your finance company\n       was interfered with, and there is a recording of that conversation\n       . . . . And we had a meeting. And it was in a large conference\n       room filled with the Cates of the world and all the top people\n       were there.\n\n       And I told them, I can’t finish this job. I am going to go out of\n       business. I am going to go bankrupt. I can’t pay people. And\n       they sit there – and now all these people had never heard of the\n       Geotech Report. You’re telling me that the people in that room\n       didn’t know there was a Geotech Report? Okay. Anyway I\n       walked out of that room, and what they said was they were\n       either going to figure out how they could release some retainage,\n       how to maybe find out, do something on the geotech, do\n       something in all these different items to free up some money so\n       we could finish the job. So that’s the first time I ever saw a\n       meeting where everyone wanted to get together and finish this\n       job.\n\nTr. 1524-25. Despite KI’s persistent efforts to have the government address\none of the pending requests for equitable adjustments or to release some of the\n\n\n                                      59\n\fretained funds, it was unsuccessful.\n\n       B.      The Cure Notice\n\n        Instead of responding to KI’s latest request for money, Ms. Lowther\nsent a formal cure notice to KI on May 21, 2005. JX 1027 at 1 (noting that KI\nand the government had met extensively during the previous week about the\n“current situation”). In the letter, she reminded KI that the Dushanbe Project\nwas awarded as a sole-source contract because of the project’s urgent and\ncompelling nature. She wrote, “[n]othing has changed to lessen the urgency\nof the completion of this project. . . . [T]ime is of the essence in the completion\nof this project.” JX 1027 at 1. Then, Ms. Lowther listed the following reasons\nthat KI was failing to make adequate progress:\n\n       1.      The Government understands that York International is\n               retaining necessary parts for air conditioning because of\n               lack of payment.\n       2.      The Government understands that PDI has not returned\n               to the site. PDI’s work is on the critical path to\n               completing this project.\n       3.      The Government understands that there is 60,000 lbs of\n               materials remaining at Baltimore Packing. This material\n               needs to be shipped to the site immediately.\n       4.      The Government understands that there are 6 containers\n               in Riga awaiting trans [sic] shipment to Dushanbe.\n\nJX 1027 at 1. Unless KI cured these conditions by June 17, 2005, “the\nGovernment will be forced to consider termination for default under the terms\nand conditions of the contract.” JX 1027 at 1. Although the contract\ncompletion date of June 20, 2004, had not been changed as of the date of the\ncure notice, Ms. Lowther indicated that the government expected substantial\ncompletion of the Dushanbe Project by September 1, 2005.\n\n        KI responded on the following business day May 23, 2005, with a letter\naddressing the issues raised in the cure notice. JX 1032. KI asserted that it\ncomplied with the first condition and ordered the parts requested from York\nInternational. Next, KI requested DOS’s assistance to secure PDI’s return to\nthe job site because PDI was currently occupied with another DOS project. KI\nexplained that the materials remaining in Baltimore were not delaying the\nproject even if they arrived after June 17, as scheduled. It indicated, however,\nthat it was willing to expedite the shipping if the government was willing to\n\n\n                                        60\n\fpay for the increased air freight shipping costs. Regarding the final condition,\nKI pointed out that the containers were delayed in Riga because of political\nunrest, which was beyond KI’s control.\n\n        After explaining its position on the conditions to be cured, KI reasserted\nits position on the release of funds being retained and the financial difficulties\nof the project. Finally, KI expressed the following:\n\n       Although Kullman wants to complete the Dushanbe project, it\n       may be forced by the State Department’s actions, including its\n       material breaches of the contract, to reduce its forces to an\n       appropriate economic level. This step, if taken, is not take\n       lightly or without considerable forethought. It is somewhat\n       incongruous and disconcerting that when the project is nearly\n       complete, the State Department has acted in an arbitrary and\n       capricious manner, has breached its duty of cooperation and has\n       interfered with Kullman’s ability to prosecute the work to\n       completion, including impairment of its ability to obtain\n       financing.\n\nJX 1031 at 2.\n\n       Ms. Lowther mailed and faxed a response to KI on May 24, 2005,\nwhich noted KI’s failure to affirm that it would cure all conditions by the\nstated deadlines. She also noted that KI had reduced its on-site workforce by\n50% and that an “increase in manpower remains a condition of Cure.” JX\n1035 at 3. Ms. Lowther reiterated that the project remained urgent and\ncompelling and that the government expected KI to cure and make adequate\nprogress to remain in compliance with the contract.\n\n       C.       “Winding Down”\n\n        Following its response to the cure notice, KI began to reduce its\nparticipation at the Dushanbe job site to what it considered an economically\nfeasible level. In fact, KI had been considering whether it should wind down\nits participation at the Dushanbe project site for some time prior to the cure\nnotice.\n\n        KI’s internal discussions about whether to reduce the scope of work at\nthe Dushanbe Project began in March of 2005. See JX 860 (discussing plans\nto increase the workforce with 15 additional cleared American workers, noting\n\n\n                                       61\n\fthat the lack of funding made paying current workers difficult, and concluding\nthat “[w]e may very well have reached the point where we need to pull back\nthe American staff and slow down the operation until OBO releases additional\nfunds”); Tr. 577-79 (Kosinski). Ms. Lowther recorded that “[b]eginning on\nMay 11, 2005, Kullman initiated a draw down in its workforce by cutting\napproximately 50 percent of its cleared American workers on site.” JX 1035\nat 3 (May 24, 2005 letter to KI regarding KI’s response to the cure notice).\n\n        On May 21, 2005, Mr. Kosinski discussed with Mr. Rand and Mr.\nLefkus the cost of travel “to fly everyone out of here if that’s where we end\nup.” JX 1030 at 1 (suggesting also that five individuals remain in Dushanbe\n“to wrap things up”). By the time that KI had responded to the cure notice,\nMr. Kosinski had prepared a spreadsheet of KI’s minimum monthly operating\ncosts that could be adjusted depending on “how far we want to scale back.”\nJX 1033 at 1. Mr. Kosinski recommended leaving the “Case backhoe, the\nBobcat, . . . the small compactor” and the “Lull” on site so that KI could\n“continue with at least some of the excavation and grading work even if we\ndecide to pull everything else out.” JX 1033 at 1. The plan to send a majority\nof the workforce home continued to develop over the next few days. See JX\n1038 (including a detailed travel plan), JX 1059 (stating the need to purchase\ntickets so that the workforce could travel home between the twenty-second and\ntwenty-fifth of June).\n\n        Part of KI’s internal conversation about whether and to what extent the\ncompany should diminish its forces in Dushanbe concerned an effort to predict\nhow the government would respond. Some KI decision-makers hoped that\nreducing the workforce in Dushanbe would cause the agency to take seriously\nKI’s claims regarding its dire financial situation and would lead it to grant one\nof KI’s various requests for funding. Mr. Rand was not optimistic about the\noutcome, however, and wrote the following to Mr. Lefkus: “As we get closer\nto D-day with OBO I feel that everyone should be very clear of ‘the end\ngame’. I would not put it past OBO to terminate KI for default, and then to\nhire a [general contractor] to complete.” JX 1064 at 1 (e-mail dated May 29,\n2005). He warned Mr. Lefkus that “[w]e are thinking much to [sic] logically\nand from a business sense to understand how the government works.” JX\n1064 at 2.\n\n        In June, the Dushanbe project was nearing completion as KI worked on\nthe interior and exterior finishes of the buildings and prepared to lay the curbs\nwhere the roads had been graded. Even as work continued, however, KI\nfurther developed its plan for how to move most of its workforce out of\n\n\n                                       62\n\fDushanbe. JX 1086 (June 7, 2005 e-mail with attachment “showing how\nmuch additional funding is required to pay off all our local accounts as of June\n15th”); JX 1090 (June 7, 2005 e-mail working out travel details). Mr.\nKosinski testified that while there was a possibility that KI could re-mobilize\nthe workforce if the government provided additional funding, the only people\nwho were scheduled to return to Dushanbe were himself, Fred Martinez, and\nJoseph Allen.\n\n       Despite the fact that KI planned to leave the job site in June, it kept its\nintentions concealed from subcontractors and from the government. JX 1090\nat 1 (“At some point - BUT NOT YET!!!! - we will need to notify Atlantic\nGroup to make . . . arrangements for their (5) remaining guys who are also\nscheduled to depart via Istanbul on the 22nd. Please take direction from Alan\non the appropriate time to contact the Atlantic Group - NOT YET!!!”); Tr. 596\n(Kosinski) (“[I]t seems that we didn’t want to let Atlantic Group know what\nwe were planning to do at that point. . . . Maybe it was we didn’t want them to\npull their guys out or to get concerned that we were pulling off the project.\nMaybe we didn’t want them to tip our hand to the government at that point.”).\nOne reason was that DOS had approved a $679,423.00 progress payment on\nJune 2, 2005, which KI was waiting to receive as of June 7, 2005. JX 1087 at\n1 (“Mr. Kullman confidentially explained to us that he will be collecting a\nfairly large receivable from the State Department. After receiving this\npayment, he will begin pulling his people off the State Department job.”).\n\n       Between June 1 and June 18, KI maintained only minimal labor on site.\nOn June 13, 2005, Mr. Kosinski wrote to Christine Byrnes, Alan Rand’s\nAdministrative Assistant,36 that the local workers would be laid off the next\nday. The June 13 travel plan listed departure dates for local workers and KI\nemployees between June 8 and June 25. KI began sending letters to its\nsubcontractors on June 14, 2005, asking them to cease work on the Dushanbe\nproject, remove any on-site workers or materials, and halt any plans to deploy\nmaterials or personnel. KI included in these stop work orders a sentence\nexpressing that “[w]e are hoping to work out disputes with the US State\nDepartment in order to remobilize the project. However, we do not know what\nthe outcome of these discussions will be.” JX 1114 at 1. Mr. Kullman\nattempted to contact Ms. Lowther by phone and e-mail on June 14, 2005, to\n“discuss the current situation on the project.” JX 1118 at 1. Nevertheless, Mr.\nKosinski meanwhile was destroying contract files as part of preparations to\nleave the job site. As of June 20, 2005, KI had suspended all contractor and\n\n\n36\n     Mr. Rand, Mr. Jordan, and Mr. Allen were copied on this e-mail.\n\n                                       63\n\fsubcontractor activities on site.\n\n       D.     The End\n\n     On June 17, 2005, DOS terminated the contract for default. Ms.\nLowther wrote the following:\n\n       Based on our telephone conversation the afternoon of June 14,\n       2005 the Government understands that Kullman Industries is\n       demobilizing from the Dushanbe NEC project site effective\n       Monday June 13, 2005. The Government also understands that\n       Kullman has written to all of its subcontractors on the project\n       and informed them that they will not be paid and should leave\n       the project site. This information has been confirmed today by\n       the OBO representative at the site. The OBO representative at\n       site telephoned OBO Washington this morning to notify OBO\n       that your project manager has confirmed that all subcontractors\n       have been terminated and that all work on the project has\n       ceased. You are hereby notified that the Department of State\n       considers such unilateral action on the part of Kullman\n       Industries to be an intentional and inexcusable breach of\n       contract.\n\nJX 1133 at 1, JX 1135 at 1.37 Ms. Lowther testified that after “looking at\n\n\n37\n   In the CO’s June 17, 2005 Final Decision letter, she asserted that she had\n“assessed liquidated damages as a result of Kullman’s failure to complete this\nproject on time” and that KI would “be liable for any damages to the\nGovernment resulting from the Contractor’s refusal and failure to complete the\nwork within the specified time” including costs incurred to complete the work.\nJX 1133 at 2, JX 1135 at 2. There is no evidence that Ms. Lowther actually\nfollowed up with a formal assessment of liquidated damages or reprocurement\ncosts. She had previously stated in the May 24, 2005 letter, however, which\nwas in the series of communications regarding the cure notice, that the\ngovernment had notified KI in writing on June 18, 2004 that it was assessing\nliquidated damages and that “[t]o date, Kullman has incurred $1,139,060.00\nin [liquidated damages]. In addition, the June 18, 2004 letter explained that\nany retainage released would be less the amount of accumulated [liquidated\ndamages].” JX 1035 at 3; Tr. 483 (Lowther). As Ms. Lowther pointed out, the\ngovernment was within its rights under the FAR to retain roughly 4% of the\n                                                                 (continued...)\n\n                                      64\n\feverything as a whole and with them basically leaving the job site and not\nprogressing on the contract, I felt like I had no other recourse than to terminate\nthem.” Tr. 450. When asked by the court if her decision might have been\ndifferent if she had considered KI’s assertion that its inability to pay\nsubcontractors was caused by the government’s failure to release previously\nearned but retained funds, Ms. Lowther answered, “[a]t the time of the\nTermination for Default? Without sounding cold, I would have to say [no]\nbecause they were leaving the job site and that was primarily what I was\nbasing the determination on, was lack of progress with the work.” Tr. 481.\nThus, the CO’s ultimate justification for terminating KI was that it had\nabandoned the job.\n\n       When work ceased, the Dushanbe Project was, according to the OBO\nProject Director’s Monthly Progress Report, 91.29% complete. On June 6,\n2005, Irving Fontaine, the on site Project Director recorded that KI had\nrecently completed the following activities:\n\n       [I]nstalled external window trims at NOB; completed floor tiles\n       at NOB dining; installed spandrel windows at NOB and MSGQ\n       stair towers; installed area heaters and overhead coiling doors at\n       warehouse; completed backfill at fuel diesel tanks; completed\n       wall insulation [          ] at MSGQ; completed two electrical\n       manholes; installed acoustic inclosure at water chillers;\n       completed utility shell, installed HVAC unit and duct work at\n       service CAC.\n\nJX 82 at 1 (May OBO Project Director’s Monthly Progress Report). The\nfollowing activities were ongoing:\n\n       sealing between exterio[r] stone panels, removing mold damage\n       GWB and plywood in NOB; vacuum cleaning and wet wiping\n       throughout NOB building; installing GWB and plywood\n       throughout NOB north 2nd floor; plastering and painting walls\n       at NOB south 1st floor; installing HVAC ducts at NOB 4th\n       floor; installing studs for internal spaces at service CAC sally\n       port area; installing rebar for delta barrier at service CAC . . . .\n\n\n\n37\n  (...continued)\ncontract, which in this case amounted to $2,169,521.50. FAR 52.232-5(e)\n(2003).\n\n                                       65\n\fJX 82 at 1.\n\n        There is other credible evidence, however, that the progress reports\nwere inaccurate, and that more than 9% of the work remained. Eric Rumpf,\nwho was OBO’s Branch Chief for the Europe and Eurasian Construction and\nCommissioning Division, traveled to Dushanbe to assess the project status at\nthe end of June 2005, after KI’s termination. Mr. Rumpf testified that the\nproject was not nearly complete: there was still work left to be done on the\ncentral utility building, which connected the other buildings with utilities,38\nthere was no landscaping, the roads and sidewalks were not complete, twenty\npercent of the protective perimeter wall was not finished, the buildings were\nstill missing some exterior facade, there was still work left to be done in the\ninteriors of the buildings owing to the mold mediation measures, there was still\nmold and water damage in the Marine Security Guard Quarters that required\na “major overhaul,” PDI’s work within the CAA had not concluded, and there\nwere a few windows that still needed to be installed. Tr. 81-100.\n\nV.     Bankruptcy\n\n        On October 17, 2005, KI filed for bankruptcy. Mr. Kullman recalled\nthat, “even when I did go bankrupt, every job that I was working on, those\nclients all got their buildings. . . . The only client that didn’t get a completed\nbuilding was the State Department. And why? Because I was terminated.”\nTr. 1528. During the same time frame, DOS was seeking to debar KI.\n\n      The Trustee in Bankruptcy filed her complaint here on June 16, 2006.\nThe government counterclaimed on June 19, 2007.\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\n       Trying a default termination frequently takes on the character of a\njuridical autopsy, an after-the-fact effort to determine what went wrong and\nwho was responsible. The autopsy we are called on to perform here is\nparticularly poignant, given that, at the end of the day, a successful, family\nowned business no longer exists. We have no doubt that KI undertook the\ncontract to build the embassy in Dushanbe fully capable of completing it and\n\n\n38\n   Although the internal utilities connections between buildings were not yet\nfinished, the only utility that was available on site at the time of termination\nwas water. The government had not yet fulfilled its obligation to provide\nexternal sources of electricity and telecommunications.\n\n                                       66\n\ffully intending to do so. We are also satisfied, however, that virtually all the\nproblems which arose and kept it from completing the work can be traced to\none mistake KI made early on and which continued to do mischief through the\nfollowing two years: KI’s misunderstanding of the effect of M002.\n\n        Ultimately it was KI’s self deception concerning what it had agreed to\ndo, and at what price, that launched contract performance onto a doomed\ntrajectory. As we will see below, KI bound itself to perform all the work,\nincluding the geotechnical aspects, at a fixed price. Its willingness to hazard\nthe contract was prompted by an unwarranted assumption that it could ask for\nmore money if the geotechnical aspects of the foundation proved to be\ndifficult. That mistake was then compounded by its subsequent reliance on\nerroneous advice about the difficulty of preparing the foundation, leading it to\nspend, unnecessarily as it turned out, far more than it budgeted for\ngeotechnical work. The combination of those two mistakes, neither of which\ncan be shifted to the government, put KI over budget and behind schedule\nvirtually from the beginning and ultimately accounts for the default\ntermination.\n\n       The fact, for example, that what should have been the routine, bilateral\ndevelopment of a schedule of values to trigger progress payments became\nimpossible to establish with accuracy. In order for KI to develop cash flow up\nfront, it became necessary for the parties to collude on a disingenuous\nschedule, postponing the inevitable collision of that contrived schedule with\nthe reality of more remaining work than remaining money. That, in turn,\nprompted KI’s inability to keep up with payments to its subcontractors. KI’s\nmisguided REA also triggered the government’s belief that KI was attempting\nto perpetrate a fraud. Our evaluation must begin, therefore, with the contract\nnegotiations over price and the subsequent disagreement over who was\nresponsible to pay for the geotechnical work.\n\nI.     The Geotechnical Claim\n\n       Plaintiff’s geotechnical claim is difficult for the court to classify. On\noccasions it appears to be a differing site condition claim for unusual soil\nconditions. Occasionally it is presented as a straight contract claim. I.e., that\nthe parties agreed to also pay KI whatever it took to complete the foundation\nwork. It has been presented as a species of bad faith breach of contract claim\nor an argument that the government is estopped from denying that it owes KI\nmore than the fixed price of the contract. In whatever form it is argued,\nhowever, there can be only one outcome. The claim fails because a literal\n\n\n                                       67\n\freading of the contract plainly supports defendant’s contention that plaintiff\nassumed the risk for how much the geotechnical and foundation work would\ncost when it agreed to a fixed price. The facts set out above demonstrate that\nthe contract obligated KI to perform all the work, including the foundation, at\nthat price.\n\n       The parties did not, contrary to plaintiff’s argument, reserve for a later\nday a full reckoning on the price for geotechnical work. It may well be the\ncase that Messrs. Lefkus, Rand and Kullman believed that they had negotiated\nsuch a reservation, but it does not appear in writing. In fact, the written\nevidence is that what KI representatives assumed was in effect an allowance\nfor geotechnical work was merely the agency’s recognition that, only if KI\ncould establish a differing site condition due to unusual soil condition would\nthe agency have to face additional cost. Even assuming Mr. Lefkus knew that\nMr. Sutherland had set aside up to $2,000,000 for a possible differing site\ncondition claim, he was wrong to leap to the conclusion that the agency would\nnot contest it.\n\n        Nor is there any support for KI’s argument that Mr. Sutherland or others\nin DOS knew that KI was operating under the false impression that any work\nbeyond “standard” foundations was not included in the original contract, and\nthat this reflected a cynicism bordering on bad faith. KI asserts that it signed\nM004 and performed the geotechnical work in reliance on the agency’s\npurposeful silence and misleading actions indicating that the geotechnical\nwork would be paid for through a request for equitable adjustment: “DOS\nundertook the conduct with the intention of having Kullman believe DOS was\nin agreement with Kullman’s view of the Geotech [issue] to ensure the\nexecution of Mod 4.” Pl’s. Post-Trial Br. 17.\n\n        We disagree. Plaintiff has the obligation to prove that agency\nrepresentatives affirmatively misled it. See Zacharin v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1366</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1371 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Mr. Sutherland can be charged with\nknowing that KI did not want to include geotechnical within a fixed price\ncontract, but he and others made it as plain as they could that the agency would\nnot agree to those terms. It would only hold out the possibility of entertaining\na differing site condition claim at a later date. Although Mr. Lefkus may be\na good salesman, and Mr. Kullman is unquestionably a first class manufacturer\nand businessman, both gentlemen were naive in their negotiations with Mr.\nSutherland and in not taking him at his word.\n\n       We recognize that Mr. Sutherland and other DOS contracting\n\n\n                                       68\n\femployees were eager, indeed desperate, to close the deal on a fixed price\ncontract before September 30, 2002. And they may have welcomed KI’s\nnaivete in agreeing to take on the risk that it could perform at a profit. None\nof that amounts to bad faith, however, or grounds for concluding that there was\nno meeting of the minds. Either there was a differing site condition or there\nwas not. If there was, KI would be entitled to an equitable adjustment whether\nthe agency agreed to one or not. If there was not a differing site condition,\nthen the fact that Mr. Sutherland held out the possibility of KI attempting to\nprove one does not mean that KI is entitled to an equitable adjustment without\nproving a differing site condition.\n\n        It is ironic, and indeed tragic, that the SANIIOSP report prompted\nplaintiff to invest millions in what probably was over-engineering with respect\nto the foundation work. But KI’s own experts came to the same conclusion\nand the result was investment in an elaborate watering/compaction/de-watering\nscheme, which appears to have been unnecessary. The fact that the extra work\nwas undertaken at all precludes the argument that the possibility of soil\nsubsidence was unknown to KI. The fact that it was probably unnecessary also\nmeans that there was not a differing site condition.\n\n        Nor can the government be held responsible for any possible alarmist\nlanguage in the SANIIOSP report because the contract put the burden of site\ninvestigation on plaintiff and its expert. The fact that plaintiff had little time\nto do a thorough investigation is also unavailing, as M002 was negotiated after\nKI had been given the opportunity to conduct its own investigation. If plaintiff\nhad been concerned that it was being pressed into making a premature\ndecision, it had the option of simply not agreeing to the government’s terms,\nunpalatable as that might have appeared at the time.\n\n         The fact that the schedule of values was amended to include more\nmoney for geotechnical work does not constitute a waiver by the government\nof its right to objectively assess whether there was a differing site condition.\nIt is certainly clear that the agency consented to moving money from\ntransportation to geotechnical work, but that was done to keep the project\nmoving, not by way of an agreement in advance to a differing site condition\nclaim.39 The phrase, “no good deed will go unpunished,” comes to mind.\n\n\n39\n  We therefore attach no significance to the testimony of Mr. Powell, who\nsigned the REA denial as CO. He was asked at trial whether he was aware that\nthe schedule of values had been amended to include geotechnical work or\n                                                               (continued...)\n\n                                       69\n\f        We will not venture to estimate the number of DOS offices that had a\nrole in the formation or administration of this contract, much less the number\nof individuals involved. So it is ironic that not enough of the many DOS\nemployees who had a role in this contract appreciated the implications of the\nshift of funds from transportation to geotechnical work. Lack of the most\nbasic communication on this score triggered a wholly unwarranted fraud\ninvestigation by DOS’ contracting office against KI. The REA, of course, was\nbased on the assertion of extra-contractual work on a differing site condition.\nThe shift of funds within the budgeted total contract amount, however, was\npredicated on the contrary assumption that the work paid for was part of the\ncontract. Plaintiff can be forgiven for ignoring the obvious inconsistency; it\nwas desperate to keep up the cash flow, and it did not hold itself out as\nknowledgeable about contracting niceties. The same cannot be said of the\nagency’s employees. Mr. Sawyer leapt to the conclusion that the inconsistency\ncould only be explained by fraud, without, apparently, ever contemplating the\nobvious implications of the contracting officer’s acquiescence to moving funds\naround. That no one with knowledge of the facts had the common sense to\nintercept this juggernaut is distressing. We hasten to point out, however, that\nthis is not the fraudulent conduct that the government still asserts, which is\ndiscussed below.\n\n       In sum, plaintiff was contractually bound to perform all the\ngeotechnical work for the original fixed price. And none of the agency’s\nconduct surrounding the geotechnical issue gave rise to a new contract or\ngrounds for revoking or supplementing the old contract, nor do they constitute\nbad faith.\n\nII.    Whether the pay certification on invoices 13386, 13442, 13493, 13561,\n       and 13647 was false.\n\n      In its counterclaims, the government asserts that KI fraudulently\nsubmitted invoices for payment which included false information.\n\n\n39\n  (...continued)\nwhether he was aware of the internal communications regarding a $2 million\ncontingency being reserved for geotechnical work. If he had been informed\nof the reserved contingency, Mr. Powell said that “[i]t would have been taken\ninto consideration.” Tr. 4680. Even if there had been a “contingency” in the\nevent an REA was advanced, payment for an equitable adjustment would\ndepend on whether there actually was a differing site condition. There was\nnot.\n\n                                      70\n\fSpecifically, the government alleges that KI falsely certified in invoices 13386,\n13442, 13493, 13561, and 13647 that\n\n       (2) All payments due to subcontractors and suppliers from\n       previous payments received under the contract have been made,\n       and timely payments will be made from the proceeds of the\n       payment covered by this certification, in accordance with\n       subcontract agreements and the requirements of chapter 39 of\n       Title 31, United States Code; [and] (3) this request for progress\n       payments does not include any amounts which the prime\n       contractor intends to withhold or retain from a subcontractor or\n       supplier in accordance with the terms and conditions of the\n       subcontract.\n\nJt. Stip. ¶ 42. The certification was false, according to the government because\nKI knew that, at least with respect to one supplier, Belcor, KI had been paid\nby the government for all that Belcor had supplied, but KI had not in fact paid\nBelcor all that it was owed. The government interprets this certification to\nmean that KI warranted that it had paid each subcontractor and supplier in full\nfor all work completed in the past and would timely pay them in full for work\ncompleted during the pay period for which it submitted each invoice.\n\n        Plaintiff argues that the certification could reasonably be interpreted as\nmeaning that KI had paid its subcontractors and suppliers as much as it could\nof the amounts due under the subcontract agreements, or, alternatively, that KI\ncould make the certification so long as it had some understanding with the\nsuppliers about paying amounts due over time. This is, in fact, the meaning\nthat Mr. Rand ascribed to the certification when he signed it.\n\n        We find the following from the facts set out earlier in this opinion.\nFirst, defendant is correct that KI certified something that was not true. Belcor\nprovided $180,236.03 worth of supplies40 which were included in line item\nSTF 1074 for $435,074. The government paid KI $217,537 (half of the value\nof the line item) on October 14, 2004, under Invoice No. 13220 and $217,537\n(the remaining half) on January 6, 2005, under Invoice No. 13386. There is\nno question that KI never fully paid Belcor for those materials despite having\nbeen reimbursed in full for the amounts billed. In certifying in subsequent\ninvoices that all payments due to subcontractors and suppliers from earlier\n\n\n40\n STF 1074 was earmarked for “Fab Fuel tanks, piping & ship to port” and\nBelcor supplied prefabricated fuel tanks and other related accessories.\n\n                                       71\n\finvoice payments have been made, Mr. Rand must have known that statement\nto be inaccurate.41\n\n        KI responds that defendant’s assertion of fraud ignores the larger\ncontext of the financial issues attributable to the Dushanbe project. The fact\nthat plaintiff was having financial difficulties does not vitiate the inaccuracy\nof the statement, however. DOS and KI did not specifically agree to waive the\nterms of the certification, and we reject the notion that Belcor agreed to a\n“payment” plan under the terms of which KI was not actually in arrears to\nBelcor.\n\n        In fairness to Mr. Rand, however, we find that he did not mean to\ndeceive the government. He says, and we believe him, that he thought it was\nperfectly appropriate to do triage with limited funds by paying whatever\nsuppliers could be paid or whichever ones could be minimally satisfied with\na partial payment. One hundred percent of the proceeds of those invoices went\nto placate suppliers, and thus he was willing to sign the certification. We\nconclude that this nuanced interpretation does not, however, overcome its clear\ninaccuracy. We remain persuaded that he should have known the statement\nwas inaccurate and should not have signed it.42\n\n       The government asserts that these facts warrant two types of fraud\ndefenses. The first is premised on the Forfeiture of Fraudulent Claims Act,\n28 U.S.C. § 2514 (2006) (“FFCA”). Under the FFCA, a claim against the\nUnited States is forfeited if there is fraud in the proof, statement, establishment\nor allowance of it. The government argues that Mr. Rand’s certifications are\nfraudulent within the meaning of the FFCA and result in the forfeiture of KI’s\naffirmative claims.\n\n       To prevail under this statute, defendant must prove “‘by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the contractor knew that its submitted claims were\nfalse, and that [the contractor] intended to defraud the government by\nsubmitting those claims.’” Daewoo Eng’g and Const. Co. v. United States, 557\n\n\n41\n  As of June 2005, KI still owed Belcor $60,869.87 even though KI had\nreceived all of the funds for STF 1074 by January 6, 2005.\n42\n   Defendant asserts that the administrative agency’s decision to disbar KI\nbecause “Kullman’s certifications were not accurate,” JX 1249, bars the court\nfrom coming to a different finding here. We need not consider the parties’\narguments on collateral estoppel. We agree with the finding.\n\n                                        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span>\n\f<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1332</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1341 (Fed.

After examining the statutory context of the provision, the\nCourt of Appeals concluded that “the forfeiture statute is best understood as\na companion requirement of claims procedure rather than a catch-all anti-fraud\nprovision.” Id. It wrote, “On its face, the statute is limited to those\ncircumstances where the Government proves fraud ‘in the proof, statement,\nestablishment or allowance’ of a claim at the Court of Federal Claims, not in\nthe execution of a contract.” Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 2514) (rejecting Court\nof Federal Claims decisions which had read the statute to include fraud\npracticed during contract performance).\n\n        Defendant recognizes that this interpretation makes liability under the\nFFCA problematic here. KI has taken some pains to explain the circumstances\nof the certifications in the court proceedings. No fraud is being perpetrated on\nthe court. There was certainly no effort to hide the facts or claim entitlement\nunder a literal reading of the certifications. We conclude that plaintiff’s claims\ncannot be forfeited under the FFCA.\n\n       The government also seeks a statutory penalty under the False Claims\nAct (“FCA”), which provides the following:\n\n       [A]ny person who –\n                (A) knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false\n       or fraudulent claim for payment or approval;\n                (B) knowingly makes, uses, or causes to be made or used,\n       a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent\n       claim;\n                ....\n                (G) . . . is liable to the United States Government for a\n       civil penalty of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000\n       . . . plus 3 times the amount of damages which the Government\n       sustains because of the act of that person.\n\n\n\n                                       73\n\f31 U.S.C. § 3729(a)(1) (2006). Under current regulations, the range of the fine\nis increased to $5,500 to $11,000. 28 C.F.R. § 85.3(a)(9) (2014).\n\n       To establish KI’s liability under the FCA, the government must prove\nby a preponderance of the evidence, Daewoo, 557 F.3d at 1340, that “(1) the\ncontractor presented or caused to be presented to an agent of the United States\na claim for payment; (2) the claim was false or fraudulent; [and] (3) the\ncontractor knew the claim was false or fraudulent.”43 Young-Montenay, Inc.\nv.

The statute defines “knowing” or “knowingly” to “mean that a\nperson” “with actual knowledge of the information” either “acts in deliberate\nignorance of the truth or falsity of the information” or “acts in reckless\ndisregard of the truth or falsity of the information.” Id.

The fact that he thought it was accurate\nunder a strained view of the circumstances does not make it any less false in\nthe sense meant by the statute.\n\n        KI contends that there could have been no reliance by the agency on the\ncertifications because the contracting officer and others were aware of KI’s\nfinancial distress. Relevant individuals within DOS plainly were aware that\n\n\n43\n   The government only seeks the statutory penalty and is not therefore\nrequired to show actual injury or damages. See Veridyne, 105 Fed. Cl. at 808\n(“To bring an FCA claim, the Government is not tasked to show that it\nincurred damages, although a showing of damages as a result of the fraudulent\nclaim is required if the Government seeks to recover damages.”).\n\n                                       74\n\fKI was in financial distress, and some had reason to know that KI was not\npaying all its suppliers. The question is whether that fact has any mitigating\nlegal effect.\n\n        The Federal Circuit has not spoken to the question of when government\nknowledge of the circumstances behind an alleged fraud vitiates the fraud. A\nnumber of other courts have spoken to the issue, however.44 The consensus of\nthose courts appears to be that the government must have full knowledge of\nthe particular fraud, which can, in some circumstances, show that the claimant\n“did not submit its claim in deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of the\ntruth.” United States ex rel.

While the relevant government officials were aware that KI was in\nfinancial distress, and Ms. Lowther must have been aware of the possibility in\nJanuary of 2005 that KI was not making full payments to some suppliers and\nsubcontractors, including Belcor, we are persuaded that she did not specifically\nknow that the certifications submitted later in the Spring of 2005 were not\ncorrect with respect to Belcor.

When she sent KI a letter requesting a response\nto the accusations being made by Belcor, KI never responded. Without being\ninformed of KI’s position on the issue, Ms. Lowther did not know whether KI\nwas within its rights to withhold funds pursuant to the terms of the subcontract\nor whether KI was, in fact, unjustifiably behind in its payments to Belcor. She\nperhaps could have guessed the certifications were inaccurate, but we believe\nthat for government knowledge to vitiate fraud, it must approach something\nlike specific consent or an agreed-upon interpretation of the terms of the\ncertification such that the parties agree that the certification does not mean\nwhat it otherwise appears to mean.45 Passivity or lack of inquisitiveness would\nnot vitiate the fraud.\n\n        In sum, we find that the five certifications from February through June\nwere inaccurate insofar as they asserted that Belcor had been fully paid and KI\nofficials should have known they were inaccurate. They were made with the\nintent to obtain payment from the agency and without concern as to whether\nthe agency understood the real facts. We conclude that KI is responsible for\nfive false certifications and award the government $27,500 on its counterclaim.\n\nIII.

The parties agreed to a fix that turned the third\nfloor modules at that point into five rather than six-sided boxes. The secure\nportion of the third floor was built and shipped in a secure manner, but it had\nno heavy metal roof. Because the additional two feet of space in the third floor\nwas generated by welding two feet to the fourth-floor floor panel, the lid to the\n“shoebox” was integrated into the unsecure fourth floor design.\n\n        Plaintiff asserts that DOS required KI to undertake security mitigation\nefforts that were not part of the agreed upon statement of work at its own\nexpense. It seeks compensation for extra work and material beyond the scope\nof the contract. It also contends that the delay caused the NOB to remain open\nto rain, which resulted in the need to do substantial mold remediation. KI was\nrequired to replace drywall and insulation in certain areas of the NOB. It\nargues that, if DOS had allowed Kullman to install the fourth floor panels\nwhen they first arrived on site, most, if not all, of the mold remediation effort\nat the NOB would have been unnecessary. There is no claim for mold\nremediation in any building other than the NOB.\n\n        The panels were not manufactured or shipped securely. It was only\nafter the panels arrived in Dushanbe and six had been installed that the CO\nnotified KI on August 20, 2004, that the panels could not be used because they\nhad not been shipped securely. There is no question that DOS halted work and\nordered KI to invest substantial time and money in retroactively determining\nwhether the CAA space, including the fourth-floor floor panels, was safe. The\nquestion the court must answer is whether the contract required secure\nconstruction and shipment of the floor panels of the fourth floor because they\nbecame the roof of the secure space below. If not, then the agency ordered a\nconstructive change under the contract’s changes clause.\n\n       KI prepared and DOS approved a classified list of items that were to be\nmanufactured and shipped securely. Both parties had a copy of the list. KI’s\ncopy of the list was kept in the safe and returned to the government when the\ncontract terminated. Mr. Algire, Site Security Manager in Dushanbe, had a\ncopy of the list. Thus, there can be no doubt there was a list that indicated\nwhat components were required to be shipped securely. Messrs. Algire and\nLefkus testified that the fourth-floor floor panels were not on the secure\nshipping list. This makes sense, because otherwise Mr. Algire would not have\nalerted DOS in Washington to the problem. We also draw an inference against\nthe government for its failure to produce the list at trial.\n\n\n\n                                       77\n\f         The fact that the components of the fourth floor were not on the secure\nlist is also made likely by the way modifications were made to the height of the\nCAA modules. It appears that when the parties agreed on a design to separate\nthe lower part of the CAA box modules from their tops by making the tops part\nof the fourth-floor floor panels, the need to maintain the identity of the roof\npanels with the third floor secure space was simply ignored. The government\nseeks to shift to KI the responsibility for that mistake.\n\n       The government gives the following interpretation of events:\n\n              Prior to the presentation of Kullman’s solution, the\n       fourth-floor floor panels did not form a physical barrier to the\n       NOB’s CAA space, so they were not designated as secure.\n       However, Kullman’s solution made the fourth-floor floor panels\n       serve double-duty, both as flooring panels for the fourth-floor\n       mechanical space (non-secure), and as the uppermost physical\n       barrier of the CAA space (secure).\n\n              At the November 6, 2003 meeting, Kullman did not raise\n       any issues related to the manufacture or transportation of the\n       fourth-floor floor panels in light of Kullman’s proposed\n       “shoebox” solution. During that meeting, however – and even\n       though neither party expressly discussed it with the other – both\n       Kullman and the DOS generally understood that material\n       designations as “secure” or “non-secure” were assigned prior to\n       the fabrication stage and subsequently governed the treatment of\n       the designated material at all stages of the project. However,\n       Kullman did not communicate that, as of November 2003, it had\n       already completed the (non-secure) fabrication of the fourth-\n       floor floor panels that it had now proposed to use as the\n       uppermost physical barrier for the third-floor CAA space.\n\nDef.’s Post-Trial Br. 24 (citations omitted). We find no factual support for the\nassertion that KI understood that the prior designation of the CAA box as\nsecure meant that the designation carried forward to the fourth floor redesign.\nThis argument assumes that it was KI’s responsibility to unilaterally change\nthe design, security designations, manufacturing plans, and transportation\nplans to adjust for the redesign. It was the agency which had the primary\nresponsibility for protecting itself and for establishing a security plan that the\ncontractor could follow. If DOS wanted the fourth-floor floor panels\nmanufactured and shipped securely, it should have identified the issue when\n\n\n                                       78\n\fthe modifications were being discussed. The factual recitation earlier in this\nopinion reflects the confusion within the agency itself concerning how to\ncharacterize the transition zone between the third and fourth floor.\n\n        In addition, the agency’s actions in July 2004 bear out the lack of\ndefinite orders to KI in terms of secure construction of the floor of the\nmechanical space. On July 12, 2004, Mr. Algire e-mailed Mr. Little, Mr.\nAlgire’s Desk Officer within OBO, and Charles Kuehne, team leader for\nsecurity procedures at DOS: “As there are no more secure shipments, that I\nam aware of, how is this stuff getting here[?] . . . Is the fourth floor south wing\nnot CAA, just contiguous with the CAA?” JX 541 at 13. The jumbled\nresponses from several quarters to that inquiry illustrates the lack of clarity\nwithin the agency on how to treat the materials in question. It is hardly\nsurprising that KI assumed that none of the fourth floor mechanical space had\nto be treated as part of the secure construction protocol. Accordingly, we find\nthat DOS issued a constructive change order when it halted construction and\ndirected KI to undertake measures to ensure the security of the panels which\nbecame the ceiling of the third floor and the floor of the fourth floor.\n\n        It follows from this that the delay in closing the building to the elements\nmust be assigned to the agency. KI was instructed on August 20, 2004, to\ncease installing panels pending the inspection that occurred in late September.\nIt was not released to continue its panel installation work until September 28.\nThe fourth-floor floor panels were fully installed by October 20.46 We find\nthat the delay resulted in an inability to timely weatherproof the NOB and\ncontributed to the growth of mold and hence the need for mold remediation.\nWhile the government presented evidence that mold was a ubiquitous problem\nat the site and not unique to the NOB after the delay commenced, the evidence\nis overwhelming that the problems at the NOB were much more extensive and\nmost likely dramatically exacerbated by KI’s inability to continue work on the\n\n\n46\n  Defendant contends that there was a delay in completing installation of the\npanels when a crane needed to hoist panels along one side could not be placed\npromptly because there was an insufficient foundation on which to place it.\nAlthough this is a disputed issue, we find plaintiff’s evidence more credible on\nthis question. We have the testimony of Mr. Allen, KI’s on site superintendent\nthat the area around the foundation of the south end of the NOB was fully in\nplace when KI began installing panels on the fourth floor. The crane had to\nbe securely placed, in other words, for any work to take place at that end of the\nbuilding. We suspect that Mr. Farley’s notes to the contrary probably reflect\nthe situation at the north end of the NOB.\n\n                                        79\n\ffourth floor just prior to the rainy period. The fact that rains did not start in\nearnest until November does not cut against KI’s claim, because merely\ncompleting the installation of fourth floor panels did not seal the building.\n\n        Defendant did establish that there were KI-caused problems with\ncompletely sealing the building after the fourth floor was assembled and that\nsome modules arrived with mold already in place, but these factors would not\nvitiate the entire claim. KI’s claim isolates costs associated with remediation\nonly at the NOB and then reduces that amount by 25% to account for\nremediation that may have been otherwise necessary. The question is thus,\nwhether 25% is a fair estimate of KI’s share of the blame for mold problems.\nWe find that it is. The bulk of the costs associated with remediation involved\nwholesale removal and replacement of gypsum board throughout the building.\nThe government did not seriously question the legitimacy of the efforts that KI\nundertook to remedy the mold damage and we conclude that 75% of actual\nexpenses is a fair estimate.\n\n        Accordingly, KI is entitled to recover all of its costs associated with\nafter-the-fact security inspections and repairs and 75% of its costs associated\nwith mold remediation. We reserve calculation of the precise amount to which\nKI is entitled.\n\nIV.

The source of that substantial completion date is a\nmystery, but it need not be solved. Although we find that the government\nwaived its right to insist upon the June 20, 2004 substantial completion\ndeadline, the facts concerning KI’s decision to leave the jobsite provide\nsufficient grounds for default termination.\n\n        In her termination notice of June 17, 2005, Ms. Lowther relied primarily\non the assertion that KI had walked off the job with no intention to return in\ntime to complete the work. We find that her interpretation of KI’s conduct is\ncorrect. We now have the benefit of even more information than was available\nto her at the time, making it clear beyond doubt that KI elected to cut its losses\nby abandoning the contract. We specifically reject plaintiff’s alternative\nexplanation that it was planning to return to the site. There is no question,\nmoreover, that even though most of the contract had been performed,\nsubstantial work remained. See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

That it did so because of its financial distress is\nnot a defense. Nor would it be a defense if Ms. Lowther failed to consider\nKI’s explanations in response to each cure item and did not permit KI\nsufficient time to cure or to meet the September 1, 2005 date for substantial\ncompletion. The same is true of KI’s argument that it could not have\ncompleted if it wanted to because the government had failed to provide\npermanent power to the site as of the date of termination. We need not\nconsider these arguments because of the overwhelming evidence that KI\nabandoned the project. That fact alone trumps any possible shortcomings in\ncontract administration. See Appeal of Protective Coatings Co., ENGBCA No.\n3205, 72-1 B.C.A. (CCH) ¶ 9431 (Apr. 13, 1972) (fact that government made\nwork more difficult does not relieve contractor of obligation to continue to\nperform).\n\n       Although it is unnecessary to the result, we note as well that the false\npayment certifications would give us grounds for affirming the termination for\ndefault, even if that were not known to the agency at the time. See Lamb\nEng’g & Const. Co. v. United States, No. 01-225, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">32933387</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fed.\nCl.

Cir. 1985).\n\n        One final issue remains before the termination for default can be\nupheld. That concerns plaintiff’s assertion that agency employees acted with\nbad faith toward plaintiff. We have rejected that assertion in connection with\nthe formation of the contract. Although many of KI’s complaints about lack\nof cooperation, lack of civility, delay, etc. may be understandable, they do not\nreflect active bad faith so much as a poisoned working relationship which can\nbe traced to KI’s misunderstanding of what it had contractually obligated itself\n\n\n                                        82\n\fto do. We also credit the likelihood that the way DOS managed this contract\nlead to unnecessary friction. But the agency’s sometimes passive-aggressive\nmanagement style does not amount to bad faith sufficient to justify\nabandonment of the contract.\n\n       There was, however, one incident that warrants specific mention. That\nconcerns Ms. Lowther’s interference in KI’s attempt to borrow money from\nTatonka Capital. In the spring of 2005, after KI had failed to persuade DOS\nto release more retainage, it approached Tatonka Capital about borrowing\napproximately $2 million, to be secured by monies the government was\nretaining. According to Mr. Kullman, Tatonka had agreed in principle to loan\nKI the money, but backed out after Carol Hansen, Tatonka’s Chief Executive\nOfficer, had a conversation with Ms. Lowther. He testified that “Lorri told her\nthat my money was being held for retainage, that there was mold litigation\ngoing on, I was never going to get retainage, and, you know, things weren’t in\ntoo good shape.” Tr. 1823 (Kullman).\n\n        Ms. Lowther’s statements were not accurate. There was no mold\nlitigation going on and she never formally assessed liquidated damages. We\ndid not have the opportunity to explore Ms. Hansen’s decision with her at trial.\nShe was not a witness. Thus we do not know what Tatonka Capital would\nhave done if Ms. Lowther had limited herself to the literal truth: the work had\nbeen held up for months because of mold problems; the parties disputed who\nwas responsible for the mold; the contract allowed for liquidated damages;\nand, although liquidated damages had not yet been assessed, KI had been\nwarned that they might be assessed because the contract was nearly a year\nbeyond the original completion date. We do know that Ms. Hansen wrote a\nletter to Mr. Kullman indicating that “While Ms. Lowther confirmed the\nretainage amount you indicated, she stated that Kullman was involved with\nmold litigation and that liquidated damages would be assessed. While you\nmade us aware of the geotech claim, these undisclosed issues prevent us from\nmoving forward.” JX 1007 at 1.\n\n       There is no question, in other words, that Ms. Lowther’s comments\ninfluenced Tatonka’s decision. What we do not know is whether Ms. Hansen\nwould have backed off from making a loan if her knowledge was limited to\nwhat was true: namely, the contract was way behind schedule and KI and\nDOS were in the middle of serious performance disputes.\n\n       Every contract carries with it the mutual exchange of promises not to\ntreat the other party in bad faith. Because government employees are\n\n\n                                      83\n\fpresumed to act in good faith, however, proof of breach of the implied\ncovenant not to act in bad faith carries a heavy burden for a contractor. The\nburden can be met in circumstances, for example, in which government\nofficials act with specific intent to injure the other party, or by abusing the\ngovernment’s position to target the contract benefits negotiated between the\nparties. See Centex Corp. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"212106\"><a href=\"/opinion/212106/centex-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1308-09 (Fed. Cir.\n2005).\n\n       We can credit the possibility that Ms. Lowther was angry at plaintiff\nand less than careful in her comments to Ms. Hansen. KI had complained so\nmuch about her performance as contracting officer that Ms. Lowther was\nreplaced for a time. See Tr. 505-06 (Lowther). Nor was she an impressive\nwitness at trial. She was frequently emotional and defensive. We assume that,\nsimilarly, she would not have reacted well to the tension created in\ncontemplating terminating a contract of this size for default and may well have\nresented KI’s continued efforts to get her to release funding. None of that\nallows us to presume that Ms. Lowther intended to injure KI, however.\nIndeed, we think it much more likely that she would have welcomed an outside\nlender injecting enough money into the contract to keep plaintiff on the job.\nWe find that the most likely explanation of her comments to Ms. Hansen was\ncarelessness.\n\n                              CONCLUSION\n\n       We conclude that KI cannot recover on its request for an equitable\nadjustment for the geotechnical work, that the government has proved its\nFalse Claims Act counterclaim, that the government has proved that the\ntermination for default was justified, and that plaintiff has proved that the\ncontract price must be adjusted to account for the constructive change order\nwith respect to the CAA. We reserve ruling on damages. The court will\ncontact the parties to arrange a status conference to address the damage\ncalculation and fraud counterclaim.\n\n\n                                           s/Eric G. Bruggink\n                                           ERIC G. BRUGGINK\n                                           Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                      84\n\f</pre>",
