Cohill, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge for the Western\nDistrict of Pennsylvania, sitting by designation.\n\fBIRCH, Circuit Judge:\n\n     In this appeal from consolidated actions under 42 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1983 and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau\n\nof Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999 (1971), we determine\n\nwhether a federal pretrial detainee was subjected to\n\nunconstitutional conditions of imprisonment in a city jail. The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment to the federal marshal, the\n\nwardens, and the correctional officers. We affirm because we\n\nconclude that all of the defendants-appellees are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\n\n                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n     On September 12, 1991, plaintiff-appellant, Donald Wilson,\n\nwas arrested by drug enforcement agents in Fort Lauderdale,\n\nFlorida, for a narcotics violation on a warrant issued by the federal\n\ndistrict court in the Middle District of Alabama. A magistrate judge\n\nin Fort Lauderdale ordered Wilson removed from the Southern\n\nDistrict of Florida to the Middle District of Alabama. Because there\n\nis no federal detention facility in the Middle District of Alabama,\n\n\n                                   2\n\findividuals awaiting trial or sentencing on federal charges are\n\nhoused in municipal and county jails in the district pursuant to\n\nintergovernmental agreements, or contracts, with the United States\n\nMarshals Service (\"Marshals Service\"). One such jail used by the\n\nMarshals Service to house federal detainees is the Montgomery\n\nCity Jail (\"MCJ\") in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n       Defendant-appellee Pam Harding, a criminal investigator for\n\nthe Marshals Service stationed in Montgomery, transported Wilson\n\nfrom the Northern District of Georgia to MCJ pending his trial and\n\nmoved him on other occasions for court proceedings. Wilson was\n\nhoused at MCJ from October 1, 1991, until December 17, 1991,\n\nwhen he was moved to Dothan City Jail to await sentencing.1\n\nWilson presently is incarcerated in at the Federal Correctional\n\nInstitution in Raybrook, New York.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Wilson returned briefly to MCJ in February, 1992, prior to transportation to his\ndesignated federal correctional institution to serve his sentence.\n\n                                               3\n\f       In his consolidated actions under ยง 1983 and Bivens, Wilson\n\nsought compensatory and punitive damages2 for alleged\n\nconstitutional violations during his stay at MCJ. He contended that\n\nthe absence of a law library at MCJ allegedly caused him to plead\n\nguilty to his then-pending federal charge and prevented him from\n\nlitigating pro se a related forfeiture case as well as this civil rights\n\ncase. He also alleged that he suffered unconstitutional\n\nconfinement conditions at MCJ, including overcrowding, disciplinary\n\nconfinement, and lack of exercise, which allegedly caused him\n\nstress, weight gain, and high blood pressure. Defendants-\n\nappellees are L.M. Blankenship, MCJ warden at the relevant time;\n\nSharon Hall, assistant MCJ warden at the relevant time; Janice\n\nHopkins3 and Rafael Parks,4 correctional officers; and Harding. All\n\nof these defendants-appellees pled qualified immunity as an\n\n\n       2\n       Wilson sued defendants-appellants jointly and severally for $500,000 compensatory\ndamages and $900,000 punitive damages.\n       3\n         Although Wilson appears to have sued both \"Mrs. Hawkens\" and \"Janice Hopkins,\" the\nrecord clarifies that this is one correctional officer and that her correct name is Janice H.\nHopkins. See R1-14, Hopkins Affidavit at 1.\n       4\n         The record shows that defendant-appellee \"Mr. Park\" is correctional officer Rafael\nParks, Sr. See R1-14, Parks Affidavit at 1.\n\n                                               4\n\faffirmative defense.5 The district court treated the ordered special\n\nreports by Harding, Blankenship, Hall, Hopkins, and Parks as\n\nmotions for summary judgment. Wilson moved for summary\n\njudgment and requested a jury trial.\n\n       Following an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended that summary judgment be entered for all\n\ndefendants. The district judge adopted the recommendation of the\n\nmagistrate judge, denied Wilson's motion for summary judgment\n\nand request for a jury trial, and granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof all the defendants. On appeal, Wilson pursues his contentions of\n\nunconstitutional confinement conditions at MCJ.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n          Although Wilson's original complaint states that he sued the state defendants in both\ntheir individual and official capacities, the record and course of proceedings indicate that he sued\nthese defendants only in their individual capacities. See Colvin v. McDougall, 62 F.3d 1316,\n1317 (11th Cir. 1995) (stating that the complaint and course of proceedings determines whether\ncivil rights defendants are sued in individual or official capacities). In suing for monetary\ndamages solely, Wilson named the individual defendants and described their involvement in his\nalleged constitutional deprivations. Moreover, none of the defendants pled Eleventh\nAmendment, sovereign immunity, which would relate to suit in their official capacities, and all\npled the affirmative defense of qualified immunity from suit in their individual capacities.\n\n                                                 5\n\f                             II. ANALYSIS\n\n     We review de novo a district judge's grant of summary\n\njudgment. See Hale v. Tallapoosa County, 50 F.3d 1579, 1581\n\n(11th Cir. 1995). When \"there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\n\nmatter of law,\" summary judgment is appropriate. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c). Because of the similarity in the causes of action, a Bivens\n\ncase challenges the constitutionality of federal officials' conduct,\n\nwhile ยง 1983 challenges the constitutionality of state officials'\n\nconduct, we \"generally apply ยง 1983 law to Bivens cases.\" Abella\n\nv. Rubino, 63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir. 1995) (per curiam).\n\n     Qualified immunity protects government officials from civil\n\ntrials and liability when their conduct in performing discretionary\n\nfunctions \"violates no 'clearly established statutory or constitutional\n\nrights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\" Lassiter\n\nv. Alabama A & M Univ., Bd. of Trustees, 28 F.3d 1146, 1149 (11th\n\nCir. 1994) (en banc) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800,\n\n818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738 (1982)). The district judge did not grant\n\n\n                                   6\n\fsummary judgment to the government defendants based on\n\nqualified immunity; the magistrate judge did not mention this\n\nentitlement in his recommendation. Nevertheless, qualified\n\nimmunity, pled by all of the government defendants as an\n\naffirmative defense, should have been the analysis used to grant\n\nthem summary judgment on the facts in this case.\n\n     Our circuit applies a two-part test to determine if the qualified\n\nimmunity defense protects a defendant government official. See\n\nEvans v. Hightower, 117 F.3d 1318, 1320 (11th Cir. 1997). First,\n\nthe \"defendant government official must prove that he was acting\n\nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when the alleged\n\nwrongful act occurred.\" Id. Second, if the defendant official meets\n\nhis burden, then the plaintiff must \"demonstrate that the defendant\n\nviolated clearly established law based upon objective standards.\"\n\nId. General propositions and abstractions do not qualify for bright\n\nline, clearly established law. See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150. \"For\n\nqualified immunity to be surrendered, pre-existing law must dictate,\n\nthat is, truly compel (not just suggest or allow or raise a question\n\n\n                                   7\n\fabout), the conclusion for every like-situated, reasonable\n\ngovernment agent that what defendant is doing violates federal law\n\nin the circumstances.\" Id. By applying these principles, we\n\ndetermine the entitlement of the marshal, the wardens, and the\n\ncorrectional officers to qualified immunity.\n\nA. Marshal\n\n       The only evidence in the record that connects Harding to\n\nWilson is her transportation of him to MCJ and to court proceedings\n\nwhen he was a federal pretrial detainee.6 Our court has determined\n\nthat marshals' transporting of federal pretrial detainees is within the\n\nscope of their discretionary authority. See Jordan v. Doe, 38 F.3d\n\n1559, 1566 (11th Cir. 1994). At the time that Harding transported\n\nWilson,\n\nhowever, no clearly established law would have informed a\n\nreasonable government official that transporting a federal pretrial\n\n\n\n       6\n         To the extent Wilson suggests that knowledge of the United States Marshals annual\ninspection report on MCJ should be imputed to Harding, we find this speculation to be supported\nby neither the facts nor the law. Even if she were aware of the inspection report, there is no\nevidence whatsoever that Harding had any control over the operation of MCJ and the\nconfinement conditions there.\n\n                                               8\n\fdetainee to a local jail with which the Marshals Service had an\n\nintergovernmental agreement was unconstitutional. See id. at\n\n1566-67. Accordingly, Harding was entitled to summary judgment\n\nbased on qualified immunity.\n\nB. Wardens\n\n     Blankenship and Hall respectively were warden and assistant\n\nwarden at MCJ while Wilson was there. Although the scope of their\n\nresponsibilities encompassed the daily administration of MCJ,\n\nWilson does not complain about the order, cleanliness, or food at\n\nMCJ, aspects of the daily functioning of a jail. Instead, his\n\ncontentions involve space: the lack of a law library and space for\n\nexercise. There is no evidence in the record that Blankenship and\n\nHall had control over these aspects of MCJ.\n\n     Federal pretrial detainees were housed at MCJ pursuant to an\n\nintergovernmental agreement between the City of Montgomery and\n\nthe Marshals Service, which paid a daily fee for federal detainees\n\nhoused there. A contracting officer for the Marshals Service and\n\nthe local police chief executed the intergovernmental agreement\n\n\n                                   9\n\feffective at the time that Wilson was housed at MCJ. That\n\nagreement provided that MCJ would house thirty-two federal\n\ndetainees a day at the request of the Marshals Service.7 No\n\nmention is made of space or square footage per federal inmate or\n\nof outdoor or indoor exercise. Neither Blankenship nor Hall was a\n\nparty to this intergovernmental agreement; they implemented its\n\nterms for the local government. Furthermore, the special report\n\nfiled at the request of the magistrate judge on behalf of the wardens\n\nand correctional officers at MCJ states: \"The United States\n\nMarshals Service is fully aware that [MCJ] has no area for outdoor\n\nexercise and has no law library. The United States Marshals\n\nService and the Federal Board of Corrections inspect [MCJ] once\n\nevery three (3) months.\" R1-14-2.\n\n\n       7\n          Concerning housing federal detainees at MCJ, the intergovernmental agreement in\neffect at the time that Wilson was housed there provided:\n\n       The LOCAL GOVERNMENT agrees to accept and provide detention space and\n       services for thirty-two (32) Federal prisoners, (which includes 16 male and 12\n       female Federal prisoners . . .) in USMS custody, each day upon the request of the\n       U.S. Marshal at the Montgomery City Jail for a period of fifteen (15) years . . . .\n\nR1-17, Exh. A, Intergovernmental Agreement (Oct. 1, 1991) at 4. During the time that Wilson\nwas confined at MCJ, the two MCJ cellblocks used for federal prisoners were filled to capacity\nand housed 16 inmates in four, four-person cells.\n\n                                               10\n\f       Providing a law library and stocking it as well as building a\n\nlarger space to house federal detainees necessarily would involve\n\nthe appropriation of funds. There is no evidence in the record that\n\nBlankenship or Hall had any responsibility for or ability to cause\n\nsuch appropriation.8 See Hill v. Dekalb Reg'l Youth Detention Ctr.,\n\n40 F.3d 1176, 1194 (11th Cir. 1994) (stating that \"[t]he critical\n\ndetermination for imposing liability under section 1983 is\n\nascertaining\n\nthe particular official with 'final policymaking authority'\" (quoting Jett\n\nv. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701, 737, 109 S.Ct. 2702,\n\n2723 (1989)). Additionally, creating a law library out of the existing\n\nspace would exacerbate the other problem about which Wilson\n\ncomplains: insufficient space for exercise.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n          The funds for building or improving local jails come from the local government and\nusually involve taxing the citizens. See Moore v. Morgan, 922 F.2d 1553, 1556-57 (11th Cir.\n1991) (local sheriff approached county commission to propose a referendum to decide if citizens\nwould incur a tax for a new jail to remedy the overcrowding problem at the existing jail); Hamm\nv. DeKalb County, 774 F.2d 1567, 1569 (11th Cir. 1985) (county provides the funding for the\nlocal jail and participates in establishing the general operational procedures, while the jail is\nsupervised by the sheriff and county commissioners who set the general operational policies and\nare responsible for jail conditions).\n\n                                               11\n\f     Therefore, the record shows that the discretionary\n\nresponsibilities of Blankenship and Hall with respect to federal\n\ndetainees consisted of daily administering MCJ pursuant to the\n\nintergovernmental agreement between the Marshals Service and\n\nthe local government and the local regulations of that facility.\n\nThere is no evidence that they did not do this or that they had any\n\nability to operate MCJ outside this circumscribed zone of\n\ndiscretionary authority regarding federal detainees housed at MCJ.\n\nEven if these space concerns were within the scope of their\n\ndiscretionary duties, we still conclude that Blankenship and Hall\n\nare protected by qualified immunity because failure to provide a\n\nlaw library for the federal detainees housed there or specific square\n\nfootage for inmates to exercise violates no clearly established law\n\nfor qualified immunity purposes, as we clarify.\n\n\n\n     1. Denial of Access to Courts\n\n\n\n\n                                  12\n\f       It is undisputed that there was no law library in MCJ and no\n\naccess to a law library when Wilson was detained there.9 He\n\ncontends that this deprivation prevented him from filing his civil\n\nrights case while he was at MCJ as well as defending his civil rights\n\ncase. Wilson's sworn testimony at the evidentiary hearing,\n\nhowever, failed to establish that he was concerned with any legal\n\nmatter other than his criminal case, for which he was represented\n\nby counsel. Therefore, the magistrate judge concluded that Wilson\n\nsuffered no prejudice from his lack of access to the courts while at\n\nMCJ.\n\n       \"[T]he fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts\n\nrequires prison authorities to . . . provid[e] prisoners with adequate\n\nlaw libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the\n\nlaw.\" Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1498\n\n(1977). The Supreme Court, however, has clarified that prisoners'\n\ncontentions of deprivations of access to courts must show actual\n\n\n       9\n         Inmates could keep legal materials in their cells and receive attorney calls and visits.\nEach unit had a dayroom with a telephone that inmates could use to contact attorneys for legal\nassistance or materials.\n\n                                                13\n\finjury as a \"constitutional prerequisite.\" Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S.\n\n343, 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 2180 (1996); see Weaver v. Brenner, 40\n\nF.3d 527, 533 (2d Cir. 1994) (recognizing that, when judicial\n\ndecisions subsequently delineate that a right that generally\n\nappeared to exist at the time of the government official's conduct\n\ndid not actually exist, then \"the conduct will not subject the official\n\nto liability\"). While Bounds guarantees the right of access to the\n\ncourts under the Fourteenth Amendment, prisoners have no\n\ninherent or independent right of access to a law library or to legal\n\nassistance. See Lewis, 518 U.S. at 349-51, 116 S.Ct. at 2179-80.\n\nInstead, they must show actual injury in the pursuit of specific types\n\nof nonfrivolous cases: direct or collateral attacks on sentences and\n\nchallenges to conditions of confinement.10 Id. at 355-57, 116 S.Ct.\n\nat 2182. \"Impairment of any other litigating capacity is simply one\n\nof the incidental (and perfectly constitutional) consequences of\n\nconviction and incarceration.\" Id. at 355, 116 S.Ct. at 2182.\n\n\n       10\n          In Lewis, examples of actual injury regarding prospective or existing litigation were\nmissing filing deadlines or being prevented from presenting claims. See Lewis, 518 U.S. at 348,\n116 S.Ct. at 2178.\n\n                                              14\n\f     With respect to access-to-court claims, Lewis clarifies that a\n\nplaintiff first must show actual injury before seeking relief under\n\nBounds. See Bass v. Singletary, 143 F.3d 1442, 1444 (11th Cir.\n\n1998). This essential standing requirement means that actions by\n\nprison officials that allegedly violated an inmate's right of access to\n\nthe courts must have impeded the inmate's pursuit of a\n\nnonfrivolous, post-conviction claim or civil rights action. See id. at\n\n1445. To prevail, a plaintiff must provide evidence of such\n\ndeterrence, such as a denial or dismissal of a direct appeal, habeas\n\npetition, or civil rights case that results from actions of prison\n\nofficials. See id. at 1446. Therefore, in an access-to-courts claim,\n\n\"a plaintiff cannot merely allege a denial of access to a law library\n\nor adequate attorney, even if the denial is systemic.\" Sabers v.\n\nDelano, 100 F.3d 82, 84 (8th Cir. 1996) (per curiam). Rather, a\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate that the lack of a law library or\n\ninadequate access to counsel hindered his \"efforts to proceed with\n\na legal claim in a criminal appeal, postconviction matter, or civil\n\nrights action seeking to vindicate basic constitutional rights.\" Id.\n\n\n                                    15\n\f     In this case, Wilson asserts that the lack of a law library at\n\nMCJ prevented him from pursuing these civil rights claims and his\n\ncivil forfeiture case. Aside from the magistrate judge's\n\ndetermination that Wilson was involved solely with his criminal case\n\nwhile at MCJ, we find Wilson's contentions to be meritless.\n\nBecause Wilson did litigate his ยง 1983 and Bivens cases in district\n\ncourt and on appeal, he cannot demonstrate that the prison officials\n\nprevented him from pursuing these causes of action. See Bass,\n\n143 F.3d at 1446. Additionally, Wilson's forfeiture case is not a\n\ntype of case that is included under the right of inmates' access to\n\ncourts under Lewis, which limits that right to direct or collateral\n\nappeals and civil rights cases. See Lewis, 518 U.S. at 355, 116\n\nS.Ct. at 2182. The Supreme Court has reiterated that an in rem\n\nforfeiture action constitutes a civil remedial sanction, which is not a\n\nclassification of case recognized as included in the access-to-\n\ncourts right under Lewis.    See United States v. Ursery, 518 U.S.\n\n267, 277-78, 116 S.Ct. 2135, 2142 (1996). Therefore, Wilson has\n\nfailed to show actual legal injury regarding either his criminal\n\n\n                                   16\n\fconviction, because he was represented by counsel in that matter,\n\nor his civil rights litigation, evidenced by this appeal, and Lewis and\n\nUrsery mandate that he has no standing for a denial of an access-\n\nto-courts claim based on any injury regarding his civil forfeiture\n\ncase. Thus, even if they had discretionary authority to provide a\n\nlaw library at MCJ, Blankenship and Hall did not violate Wilson's\n\nconstitutional right of access to courts.11\n\n       2. Exercise\n\n       Wilson complains that both outdoor and indoor exercise were\n\nunavailable to him while he was housed at MCJ. It is undisputed\n\nthat MCJ has no space or provision for outdoor exercise for its\n\ninmates. Additionally, Wilson contends that he was unable to\n\nexercise inside MCJ because of the lack of space resulting from the\n\nnumber of inmates there.\n\n       In contrast to a sentenced prisoner, whose conditions of\n\nconfinement are analyzed under the Cruel and Unusual\n\n\n       11\n          We further note that MCJ \"has built a new law library for prisoners since this appeal\nwas filed,\" which Wilson's appellate counsel acknowledges could render this issue \"moot.\"\nAppellant's Supplemental Brief at 9.\n\n                                               17\n\fPunishment Clause of the Eighth Amendment, \"the proper inquiry\n\n[for a pretrial detainee] is whether [confinement] conditions amount\n\nto punishment of the [unadjudicated] detainee\" under the Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Bell v. Wolfish, 441\n\nU.S. 520, 535 & n.16, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 1872 & n.16 (1979); see\n\nVillarreal v. Woodham, 113 F.3d 202, 207 (11th Cir. 1997)\n\n(recognizing that confinement of pretrial detainees is a \"necessary\n\nrestriction\" to ensure their presence in court).\n\n           Not every disability imposed during pretrial\n     detention amounts to \"punishment\" in the constitutional\n     sense, however. . . . And the fact that such detention\n     interferes with the detainee's understandable desire to\n     live as comfortably as possible and with as little restraint\n     as possible during confinement does not convert the\n     conditions or restrictions of detention into \"punishment.\"\n\nBell, 441 U.S. at 537, 99 S.Ct. at 1873. In analyzing confinement\n\nconditions about which a pretrial detainee complains, a court must\n\ndecide whether the detention officials intentionally imposed the\n\nrestriction for a punitive purpose or whether it is reasonably\n\nincidental to a legitimate government objective. See id. at 538-39,\n\n99 S.Ct. at 1873-74; see Villarreal, 113 F.3d at 207. \"If a\n\n\n                                   18\n\frestriction is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal--if it is\n\narbitrary or purposeless--a court may infer that the purpose of the\n\ngovernment action is punishment.\" Lynch v. Baxley, 744 F.2d\n\n1452, 1463 (11th Cir. 1984). Additionally, our court evaluates\n\nparticular pretrial detainee complaints against the totality of\n\nconfinement conditions to determine if there is constitutional\n\ndeficiency. See Hamm v. DeKalb County, 774 F.2d 1567, 1575-76\n\n(11th Cir. 1985).\n\n     As we have explained, there is no evidence in this record to\n\nshow that Blankenship or Hall had any authority or ability to create\n\na secure space at MCJ for outdoor exercise for inmates.\n\nPrincipally, this is because the local government is responsible for\n\nappropriating the funds for building such jail outdoor exercise\n\nspace. Under the analysis prescribed by Bell, there is no evidence\n\nwhatsoever in the record that Wilson or any other inmate at MCJ\n\nwas denied outdoor exercise by Blankenship or Hall as\n\npunishment. Instead, these wardens were implementing the\n\nlegitimate government purpose of housing federal detainees\n\n\n                                    19\n\fpursuant the terms of the intergovernmental agreement between\n\nthe Marshals Service and the local government. The Court's\n\ndecision in Bell considered the relatively short stay of federal\n\npretrial detainees at a facility such as MCJ. See Bell, 441 U.S. at\n\n543, 99 S.Ct. at 1876. Following Bell, the former Fifth Circuit\n\naccorded no relief at a similar institution housing federal pretrial\n\ndetainees where \"[t]here was no outdoor exercise.\"12 Jones v.\n\nDiamond, 636 F.2d 1364, 1374 (5th Cir. Jan. 1981) (en banc). We\n\nconclude that not only does the record fail to show that Blankenship\n\nand Hall, as wardens at MCJ, had discretionary authority to provide\n\noutdoor exercise for Wilson or that the lack of such exercise was to\n\n\n       12\n           In a case that predated Bell, we are cognizant that the former Fifth Circuit found that\npretrial detainees should not be incarcerated continuously \"in an institution designed to punish,\nwhere outdoor recreation is reasonably possible.\" Miller v. Carson, 563 F.2d 741, 750 (5th Cir.\n1977). Rather than mandating immediate outdoor recreation, however, the Miller court\nrecognized that such outdoor exercise \"may not be immediately attainable because of lack of\nresources\" and stated that this was \"a goal toward which the jail authorities should strive.\" Id.\nThus, Miller did not require that every pretrial detainee have an automatic constitutional right to\noutdoor exercise, and continuous incarceration is distinct from brief detention periods. We\nfurther note that the defendants in Miller were the county sheriff as well as city and state\nofficials charged with oversight of the prison system and appropriation of local and state funds\nfor building prisons and improvements to existing prisons and not the warden, who is charged\nwith the daily administration of the prison. See id. at 744 & nn. 2 & 3. Furthermore, because it\npredated Bell, which instructs that courts must analyze confinement conditions of pretrial\ndetainees to determine if the intent is to punish or if the condition is incidental to a legitimate\ngovernment purpose, Miller was not considered under Bell, which directs our review in this case.\n\n\n                                                20\n\fpunish him, but also that no clearly established constitutional law\n\nrequired that Wilson have immediate access to outdoor exercise\n\nduring the time that he was at MCJ, where no such facilities\n\nexisted, and his confinement at MCJ was brief.\n\n       Wilson also complains that he was unable to exercise inside\n\nMCJ in the limited space available to him. Hall's affidavit explains\n\nthat Wilson and other inmates were released from their cells into a\n\nlarger, open area, or dayroom, containing a telephone and\n\ntelevision for inmates' use, at 5:00 A.M. and that they remained\n\nthere until 10:00 P.M., when they returned to their cells for the\n\nnight. See R1-14, Hall Affidavit at 1-2. This open area \"provides\n\nspace where the inmates may participate in exercises such as\n\npush-ups, sit-ups and limited jogging, etc.\"13 Id. at 2; see Jones,\n\n636 F.2d at 1373 (noting that there was limited room for indoor\n\nexercise and that inmates did push-ups \"as their only form of\n\n       13\n           A Marshals Service inspection report states \"there is ample room in the day room areas\nfor inmates to do exercises.\" Government Exh. 1-7. Additionally, federal detainees, like other\ninmates housed at MCJ, also engage in indoor work detail, which involves sweeping, mopping,\nand scrubbing their cells, the common areas, and hallways that they occupy on a daily basis.\nSee R1-14, Exh. B at 10 (MCJ Standard Minimum Rules and Regulations). We note that these\nactivities provide some exercise.\n\n\n                                               21\n\fexercise in the jammed cells and day rooms\"). Wilson states that\n\nthe dayroom consisted of approximately 240 square feet of floor\n\nspace, which he shared with fifteen inmates, affording\n\napproximately fifteen square feet of floor space per man. See R1-\n\n35-1; id. App. B, Wilson Affidavit at 1. He further represents that\n\n\"even if it would be feas[i]ble to ex[er]cise in this area, it would only\n\nannoy the individuals using the phone, and obstruct the others[']\n\nv[ie]w of T.V. and could easily escalate into violent physical\n\nconfrontations,\" R1-35-1, and that \"[t]his area was sever[e]ly over\n\ncro[w]ded under the Federal Regulations,\" id. App. B, Wilson\n\nAffidavit at 1.\n\n     Despite Wilson's contentions of overcrowding, we note that he\n\ndoes not represent that there were more than sixteen inmates in\n\nthe dayroom, which was the maximum number specified in the\n\nintergovernmental agreement between the Marshals Service and\n\nthe local government. Furthermore, we have not granted relief for\n\nmore crowded conditions than Wilson experienced at MCJ in a\n\nfacility that housed both pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners.\n\n\n                                    22\n\fSee, e.g., Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1569 (\"During Hamm's incarceration\n\nthere, the jail's population at times exceeded the facility's design\n\ncapacity.\"). In Bell, the Supreme Court clarified that the relative\n\nbrevity of pretrial detainees' confinement allows spacial\n\nconfinement that involves \"genuine privations and hardship,\" which\n\nmight be questionable under the Due Process Clause if they\n\ncontinued \"over an extended period of time.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 542,\n\n99 S.Ct. at 1876. The Court also stated that federal court\n\ndecisions concerning minimum inmate space requirements as well\n\nas purported standards recommended by various groups with\n\nexpertise in correctional institutions may set goals, but that \"they\n\nsimply do not establish the constitutional minima.\"14 Id. at 543 n.27,\n\n99 S.Ct. at 1876 n.27. Recognizing the Bell mandate, \"we set no\n\nspace standards,\" Jones, 636 F.2d at 1376, in a similar institution\n\nwhere the dayroom sometimes afforded \"little more than six square\n\n       14\n          Even \"recommendations of the Federal Corrections Policy Task Force of the\nDepartment of Justice regarding conditions of confinement for pretrial detainees are not\ndetermininative of the requirements of the Constitution.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 543 n.27, 99 S.Ct. at\n1876 n.27 (emphasis added). Consequently, the Marshals Service MCJ inspection report,\nrelevant to the time that Wilson was at MCJ, does not show a constitutional violation when it\nnotes that the dayroom was not in compliance with 35 square feet per inmate recommended by\nthe Marshals Service. See Government Exh. 2 at 2.\n\n                                               23\n\ffeet per inmate.\" Id. at 1374. Our court further has concluded that\n\n\"[i]t is equally clear that the due process clause does not purport to\n\nregulate the general conditions and quality of life in the country's\n\njails, and that the courts should not attempt to make 'judgment\n\ncalls' to determine which of various marginally different conditions\n\nmight be more appropriate.\" Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1573.\n\n     Rather than complaining that fifteen square feet per inmate is\n\ninsufficient space to do exercises such as push-ups, sit-ups, or\n\njogging in place, Wilson speculates that such exercises may annoy\n\nthe other inmates with the potential for physical confrontations.\n\nThere is no evidence in this record that any altercation occurred as\n\na result of Wilson's attempted indoor exercising during his stay at\n\nMCJ. Thus, Wilson has presented no documented reason that he\n\ncould not have engaged in indoor exercises while he was at MCJ,\n\nand he has not shown that Blankenship or Hall prevented him from\n\ndoing so for a punitive purpose. To the extent that Wilson\n\nrepresents that he developed high blood pressure because of the\n\nlack of an ability to exercise at MCJ, his medical history, attached to\n\n\n                                  24\n\fthe special report filed on behalf of the wardens and correctional\n\nofficers, shows that he was suffering from high blood pressure\n\nwhen he entered MCJ. His medical records while at MCJ further\n\nevidence that he received medication and was treated for his\n\nailments while there. Thus, Wilson's high blood pressure was not\n\ncaused by his detention at MCJ and his alleged inability to exercise\n\nthere.\n\n     In addition to having no discretionary authority to fund and to\n\nbuild an secure outdoor exercise facility at MCJ or to deviate from\n\nthe specifications of the intergovernmental agreement between the\n\nMarshals Service and the local government as to the number of\n\nfederal detainees housed at MCJ with the resulting implications for\n\ninmate space there, Blankenship and Hall violated no clearly\n\nestablished law in not providing Wilson outdoor exercise while he\n\nwas at MCJ or affording him more space for indoor exercise.\n\nApplying the Bell standard to confinement conditions, such as\n\nspace, is \"exceedingly difficult and does not provide clear results,\"\n\nwhich makes qualified immunity appropriate. Hamm, 774 F.2d at\n\n\n                                  25\n\f1573. Moreover, states, not wardens, \"can improve the quality and\n\nquantity\"of such conditions by \"increasing and properly\n\nadministering the amount of money they spend on a detention\n\nfacility\"; \"courts in most instances may not interfere with a state's\n\ndecision to provide detainees with a reasonable level and quality of\n\nfood, living space, and medical care.\" Id.                    Additionally, under a\n\ntotality of confinement conditions analysis, Wilson's complaints are\n\nfew in comparison to other cases where we have not given relief\n\nbecause we determined that the confinement conditions were not\n\nconstitutional violations. See, e.g., id. at 1569-70 (noting that\n\nobjectionable confinement conditions at county jail included\n\novercrowding, sleeping on tables or the floor, unsanitary floor and\n\nlinens, occasional foreign objects in the food). On the facts of this\n\ncase, Blankenship and Hall are entitled to qualified immunity.15\n\n       15\n          We note that our decision would be the same under an Eighth Amendment analysis\napplicable to the brief time that Wilson returned to MCJ after his conviction and before he was\nmoved to his designated federal penitentiary to serve his sentence. Our court has held that the\nminimum standard of the Due Process Clause relative to basic necessities, such as living space,\n\"is the same as that allowed by the eighth amendment for convicted persons.\" Hamm, 774 F.2d\nat 1574. \"The Supreme Court . . . has not set forth a standard for determining what level of\nnecessities the due process clause absolutely requires.\" Id. Consequently, in addition to having\nno ability to create exercise space at MCJ as part of their discretionary responsibilities,\nBlakenship and Hall violated no clearly established law under the Eighth Amendment with\n\n                                               26\n\fC. Correctional Officers\n\n       Wilson contends that correctional officers Parks and Hopkins\n\nalso denied him access to a law library and exercise as well as\n\nplaced him in disciplinary isolation without proper bedding. There\n\nis no evidence in the record that Parks or Hopkins had any\n\ndiscretionary authority regarding implementing policies or\n\nprocedures at MCJ; consequently, they were not responsible for\n\nthe lack of a law library or exercise space at MCJ. As we\n\nadditionally have discussed, the lack of a law library, outdoor\n\nexercise, or more space for indoor exercise did not violate clearly\n\nestablished law as to Wilson's constitutional rights while he was at\n\nMCJ. Accordingly, Parks and Hopkins are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity concerning these issues. We limit our analysis to\n\nWilson's complaints concerning his disciplinary isolation.\n\n       Wilson represents that, on two separate occasions, Parks and\n\nHopkins each placed him in disciplinary isolation as sanctions for\n\n\n\n\nrespect to Wilson during the time that he was at MCJ, which also would entitle them to qualified\nimmunity.\n\n                                               27\n\fhis misconduct.16 See R1-35, App. B, Wilson Affidavit at 1. He\n\nfurther states that he \"was forced to sleep on a bare floor, which\n\nwas both degrading and inhumane.\" Id. at 1. The magistrate judge\n\nordered Hopkins to respond to Wilson's allegations. Hopkins\n\nexplained that she placed Wilson in an isolation cell because he\n\nwas inciting other inmates to disobey an order to lower the noise in\n\ntheir cellblock and that it was her professional opinion that he had\n\nto be removed to maintain security in the cellblock. See R1-39,\n\nHopkins Affidavit at 1-2. She further avers that MCJ inmates who\n\nremain in isolation are given bedding and that Wilson was not\n\nrequired to sleep on the floor. Id. In a report describing the\n\nincident to Warden Hall, Hopkins states that Wilson was not calm\n\nwhen her shift terminated and that it was the responsibility of the\n\nnext shift to provide bedding for inmates who remained in isolation\n\nafter lock down and lights out. See R1-38, Exh. A. Even accepting\n\n       16\n          Wilson has not placed in the record the specifics of his alleged disciplinary isolation by\nParks. Because Wilson \"bear[s] the responsibility of ensuring that the record is complete,\" and\nhe \"has given us no reason to believe he was unable to do so,\" we are unable to address his\nallegations relating to Parks. United States v. Walker, 839 F.2d 1483, 1485 n.2 (11th Cir. 1988)\n(per curiam). Therefore, Parks is entitled to qualified immunity because we will not hold a\ngovernment official personally liable for compensatory and punitive damages based on mere\nallegations. See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1149-50.\n\n                                                28\n\fWilson's account that he was not provided bedding in the isolation\n\ncell, the correctional officer on duty at lock down and lights out\n\nwould be the individual who allegedly deprived Wilson of bedding\n\nand not Hopkins. Additionally, it is unclear from the record whether\n\nWilson actually spent the night or several hours in the isolation cell.\n\nWe also are mindful that our court has not found an inmate's\n\nsleeping on a table while in confinement, but not isolation, not to be\n\nviolative of any constitutional rights. See Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1569.\n\n     Significantly, Wilson was placed in disciplinary isolation to\n\nquell a disturbance that he was causing on the cellblock at night.\n\n\"[P]reserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that\n\nmay require limitation or retraction of the retained constitutional\n\nrights of both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.\" Bell, 441\n\nU.S. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878; see Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1573\n\n(\"Legitimate restraints may stem from the state's need to manage\n\nthe detention facility and maintain security.\"). Prison officials have\n\n\"wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies\n\nand practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\n\n\n                                   29\n\forder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\" Bell, 441\n\nU.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878. Because courts are not in a position\n\nto evaluate urgent problems that occur in prison administration, we\n\ndo not second-guess prison officials on matters that they are better\n\nequipped to handle under the exigencies of an internal disturbance.\n\nSee id. at 531, 99 S.Ct. at 1870. Wilson's temporary placement in\n\ndisciplinary isolation for the legitimate purpose of quieting him on\n\nthe facts of this record was not unconstitutional even without\n\nbedding and did not violate any clearly established law at the\n\nrelevant time. Accordingly, we conclude that Parks and Hopkins\n\nare entitled to qualified immunity concerning Wilson's placement in\n\ndisciplinary isolation.17\n\n                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n       In this Bivens and ยง 1983 case, Wilson has alleged that a\n\nfederal marshal, MCJ wardens and correctional officers violated his\n\n       17\n           To the extent that Wilson suggests that he was deprived of due process because he was\nconfined in disciplinary isolation without a hearing, \"the Due Process Clause does not directly\nprotect an inmate from changes in the conditions of his confinement.\" Chandler v. Baird, 926\nF.2d 1057, 1060 (11th Cir. 1991). Specifically, the Due Process Clause does not establish \"'an\ninterest in being confined to a general population cell, rather than the more austere and\nrestrictive administrative segregation quarters.'\" Id. (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460,\n466, 103 S.Ct. 864, 869 (1983)).\n\n                                              30\n\fconstitutional rights as to access to courts, exercise, and\n\ndisciplinary isolation. As we have explained, all of these\n\ndefendants-appellants are entitled to qualified immunity. On this\n\nbasis, the grant of summary judgment to defendants-appellants is\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                  31\n\f",

BACKGROUND\n\n     On September 12, 1991, plaintiff-appellant, Donald Wilson,\n\nwas arrested by drug enforcement agents in Fort Lauderdale,\n\nFlorida, for a narcotics violation on a warrant issued by the federal\n\ndistrict court in the Middle District of Alabama. A magistrate judge\n\nin Fort Lauderdale ordered Wilson removed from the Southern\n\nDistrict of Florida to the Middle District of Alabama. Because there\n\nis no federal detention facility in the Middle District of Alabama,\n\n\n                                   2\n\findividuals awaiting trial or sentencing on federal charges are\n\nhoused in municipal and county jails in the district pursuant to\n\nintergovernmental agreements, or contracts, with the United States\n\nMarshals Service (\"Marshals Service\"). One such jail used by the\n\nMarshals Service to house federal detainees is the Montgomery\n\nCity Jail (\"MCJ\") in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\n       Defendant-appellee Pam Harding, a criminal investigator for\n\nthe Marshals Service stationed in Montgomery, transported Wilson\n\nfrom the Northern District of Georgia to MCJ pending his trial and\n\nmoved him on other occasions for court proceedings. Wilson was\n\nhoused at MCJ from October 1, 1991, until December 17, 1991,\n\nwhen he was moved to Dothan City Jail to await sentencing.1\n\nWilson presently is incarcerated in at the Federal Correctional\n\nInstitution in Raybrook, New York.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n        Wilson returned briefly to MCJ in February, 1992, prior to transportation to his\ndesignated federal correctional institution to serve his sentence.\n\n                                               3\n\f       In his consolidated actions under ยง 1983 and Bivens, Wilson\n\nsought compensatory and punitive damages2 for alleged\n\nconstitutional violations during his stay at MCJ. He contended that\n\nthe absence of a law library at MCJ allegedly caused him to plead\n\nguilty to his then-pending federal charge and prevented him from\n\nlitigating pro se a related forfeiture case as well as this civil rights\n\ncase. He also alleged that he suffered unconstitutional\n\nconfinement conditions at MCJ, including overcrowding, disciplinary\n\nconfinement, and lack of exercise, which allegedly caused him\n\nstress, weight gain, and high blood pressure. Defendants-\n\nappellees are L.M. Blankenship, MCJ warden at the relevant time;\n\nSharon Hall, assistant MCJ warden at the relevant time; Janice\n\nHopkins3 and Rafael Parks,4 correctional officers; and Harding. All\n\nof these defendants-appellees pled qualified immunity as an\n\n\n       2\n       Wilson sued defendants-appellants jointly and severally for $500,000 compensatory\ndamages and $900,000 punitive damages.\n       3\n         Although Wilson appears to have sued both \"Mrs. Hawkens\" and \"Janice Hopkins,\" the\nrecord clarifies that this is one correctional officer and that her correct name is Janice H.\nHopkins. See R1-14, Hopkins Affidavit at 1.\n       4\n         The record shows that defendant-appellee \"Mr. Park\" is correctional officer Rafael\nParks, Sr. See R1-14, Parks Affidavit at 1.\n\n                                               4\n\faffirmative defense.5 The district court treated the ordered special\n\nreports by Harding, Blankenship, Hall, Hopkins, and Parks as\n\nmotions for summary judgment. Wilson moved for summary\n\njudgment and requested a jury trial.\n\n       Following an evidentiary hearing, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended that summary judgment be entered for all\n\ndefendants. The district judge adopted the recommendation of the\n\nmagistrate judge, denied Wilson's motion for summary judgment\n\nand request for a jury trial, and granted summary judgment in favor\n\nof all the defendants. On appeal, Wilson pursues his contentions of\n\nunconstitutional confinement conditions at MCJ.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n          Although Wilson's original complaint states that he sued the state defendants in both\ntheir individual and official capacities, the record and course of proceedings indicate that he sued\nthese defendants only in their individual capacities. See Colvin v. McDougall, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"701844\"><a href=\"/opinion/701844/charles-colvin-v-john-j-mcdougall-sheriff-of-the-lee-county-sheriffs/\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1316</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1317 (11th Cir. 1995) (stating that the complaint and course of proceedings determines whether\ncivil rights defendants are sued in individual or official capacities).

Moreover, none of the defendants pled Eleventh\nAmendment, sovereign immunity, which would relate to suit in their official capacities, and all\npled the affirmative defense of qualified immunity from suit in their individual capacities.\n\n                                                 5\n\f                             II.

Nevertheless, qualified\n\nimmunity, pled by all of the government defendants as an\n\naffirmative defense, should have been the analysis used to grant\n\nthem summary judgment on the facts in this case.\n\n     Our circuit applies a two-part test to determine if the qualified\n\nimmunity defense protects a defendant government official. See\n\nEvans v. Hightower, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71852\"><a href=\"/opinion/71852/evans-v-hightower/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1318</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1320 (11th Cir. 1997). First,\n\nthe \"defendant government official must prove that he was acting\n\nwithin the scope of his discretionary authority when the alleged\n\nwrongful act occurred.\" Id. Second, if the defendant official meets\n\nhis burden, then the plaintiff must \"demonstrate that the defendant\n\nviolated clearly established law based upon objective standards.\"\n\nId. General propositions and abstractions do not qualify for bright\n\nline, clearly established law. See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150. \"For\n\nqualified immunity to be surrendered, pre-existing law must dictate,\n\nthat is, truly compel (not just suggest or allow or raise a question\n\n\n                                   7\n\fabout), the conclusion for every like-situated, reasonable\n\ngovernment agent that what defendant is doing violates federal law\n\nin the circumstances.\" Id. By applying these principles, we\n\ndetermine the entitlement of the marshal, the wardens, and the\n\ncorrectional officers to qualified immunity.\n\nA. Marshal\n\n       The only evidence in the record that connects Harding to\n\nWilson is her transportation of him to MCJ and to court proceedings\n\nwhen he was a federal pretrial detainee.6 Our court has determined\n\nthat marshals' transporting of federal pretrial detainees is within the\n\nscope of their discretionary authority. See Jordan v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681325\"><a href=\"/opinion/681325/robert-allen-jordan-v-john-doe-chief-us-marshal-david-adkins-lydia/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1559</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1566 (11th Cir. 1994). At the time that Harding transported\n\nWilson,\n\nhowever, no clearly established law would have informed a\n\nreasonable government official that transporting a federal pretrial\n\n\n\n       6\n         To the extent Wilson suggests that knowledge of the United States Marshals annual\ninspection report on MCJ should be imputed to Harding, we find this speculation to be supported\nby neither the facts nor the law. Even if she were aware of the inspection report, there is no\nevidence whatsoever that Harding had any control over the operation of MCJ and the\nconfinement conditions there.\n\n                                               8\n\fdetainee to a local jail with which the Marshals Service had an\n\nintergovernmental agreement was unconstitutional. See id. at\n\n1566-67. Accordingly, Harding was entitled to summary judgment\n\nbased on qualified immunity.\n\nB. Wardens\n\n     Blankenship and Hall respectively were warden and assistant\n\nwarden at MCJ while Wilson was there. Although the scope of their\n\nresponsibilities encompassed the daily administration of MCJ,\n\nWilson does not complain about the order, cleanliness, or food at\n\nMCJ, aspects of the daily functioning of a jail. Instead, his\n\ncontentions involve space: the lack of a law library and space for\n\nexercise. There is no evidence in the record that Blankenship and\n\nHall had control over these aspects of MCJ.\n\n     Federal pretrial detainees were housed at MCJ pursuant to an\n\nintergovernmental agreement between the City of Montgomery and\n\nthe Marshals Service, which paid a daily fee for federal detainees\n\nhoused there. A contracting officer for the Marshals Service and\n\nthe local police chief executed the intergovernmental agreement\n\n\n                                   9\n\feffective at the time that Wilson was housed at MCJ. That\n\nagreement provided that MCJ would house thirty-two federal\n\ndetainees a day at the request of the Marshals Service.7 No\n\nmention is made of space or square footage per federal inmate or\n\nof outdoor or indoor exercise. Neither Blankenship nor Hall was a\n\nparty to this intergovernmental agreement; they implemented its\n\nterms for the local government. Furthermore, the special report\n\nfiled at the request of the magistrate judge on behalf of the wardens\n\nand correctional officers at MCJ states: \"The United States\n\nMarshals Service is fully aware that [MCJ] has no area for outdoor\n\nexercise and has no law library. The United States Marshals\n\nService and the Federal Board of Corrections inspect [MCJ] once\n\nevery three (3) months.\" R1-14-2.\n\n\n       7\n          Concerning housing federal detainees at MCJ, the intergovernmental agreement in\neffect at the time that Wilson was housed there provided:\n\n       The LOCAL GOVERNMENT agrees to accept and provide detention space and\n       services for thirty-two (32) Federal prisoners, (which includes 16 male and 12\n       female Federal prisoners . . .) in USMS custody, each day upon the request of the\n       U.S. Marshal at the Montgomery City Jail for a period of fifteen (15) years . . . .\n\nR1-17, Exh. A, Intergovernmental Agreement (Oct. 1, 1991) at 4. During the time that Wilson\nwas confined at MCJ, the two MCJ cellblocks used for federal prisoners were filled to capacity\nand housed 16 inmates in four, four-person cells.\n\n                                               10\n\f       Providing a law library and stocking it as well as building a\n\nlarger space to house federal detainees necessarily would involve\n\nthe appropriation of funds. There is no evidence in the record that\n\nBlankenship or Hall had any responsibility for or ability to cause\n\nsuch appropriation.8 See Hill v.

Wilson's sworn testimony at the evidentiary hearing,\n\nhowever, failed to establish that he was concerned with any legal\n\nmatter other than his criminal case, for which he was represented\n\nby counsel. Therefore, the magistrate judge concluded that Wilson\n\nsuffered no prejudice from his lack of access to the courts while at\n\nMCJ.\n\n       \"[T]he fundamental constitutional right of access to the courts\n\nrequires prison authorities to . . . provid[e] prisoners with adequate\n\nlaw libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the\n\nlaw.\" Bounds v.

See Bass,\n\n143 F.3d at 1446. Additionally, Wilson's forfeiture case is not a\n\ntype of case that is included under the right of inmates' access to\n\ncourts under Lewis, which limits that right to direct or collateral\n\nappeals and civil rights cases.

Under the analysis prescribed by Bell, there is no evidence\n\nwhatsoever in the record that Wilson or any other inmate at MCJ\n\nwas denied outdoor exercise by Blankenship or Hall as\n\npunishment. Instead, these wardens were implementing the\n\nlegitimate government purpose of housing federal detainees\n\n\n                                    19\n\fpursuant the terms of the intergovernmental agreement between\n\nthe Marshals Service and the local government. The Court's\n\ndecision in Bell considered the relatively short stay of federal\n\npretrial detainees at a facility such as MCJ. See Bell, 441 U.S. at\n\n543, 99 S.Ct. at 1876. Following Bell, the former Fifth Circuit\n\naccorded no relief at a similar institution housing federal pretrial\n\ndetainees where \"[t]here was no outdoor exercise.\"12 Jones v.\n\nDiamond, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"385707\"><a href=\"/opinion/385707/marvin-jones-on-his-own-behalf-and-on-behalf-of-those-similarly-situated/\"><span class=\"volume\">636</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1374 (5th Cir. Jan. 1981) (en banc). We\n\nconclude that not only does the record fail to show that Blankenship\n\nand Hall, as wardens at MCJ, had discretionary authority to provide\n\noutdoor exercise for Wilson or that the lack of such exercise was to\n\n\n       12\n           In a case that predated Bell, we are cognizant that the former Fifth Circuit found that\npretrial detainees should not be incarcerated continuously \"in an institution designed to punish,\nwhere outdoor recreation is reasonably possible.\" Miller v. Carson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"349561\"><a href=\"/opinion/349561/richard-franklin-miller-v-dale-carson-individually-and-in-his-capacity-as/\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">741</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 750 (5th Cir.\n1977). Rather than mandating immediate outdoor recreation, however, the Miller court\nrecognized that such outdoor exercise \"may not be immediately attainable because of lack of\nresources\" and stated that this was \"a goal toward which the jail authorities should strive.\" Id.\nThus, Miller did not require that every pretrial detainee have an automatic constitutional right to\noutdoor exercise, and continuous incarceration is distinct from brief detention periods. We\nfurther note that the defendants in Miller were the county sheriff as well as city and state\nofficials charged with oversight of the prison system and appropriation of local and state funds\nfor building prisons and improvements to existing prisons and not the warden, who is charged\nwith the daily administration of the prison. See id. at 744 & nn. 2 & 3. Furthermore, because it\npredated Bell, which instructs that courts must analyze confinement conditions of pretrial\ndetainees to determine if the intent is to punish or if the condition is incidental to a legitimate\ngovernment purpose, Miller was not considered under Bell, which directs our review in this case.\n\n\n                                                20\n\fpunish him, but also that no clearly established constitutional law\n\nrequired that Wilson have immediate access to outdoor exercise\n\nduring the time that he was at MCJ, where no such facilities\n\nexisted, and his confinement at MCJ was brief.\n\n       Wilson also complains that he was unable to exercise inside\n\nMCJ in the limited space available to him. Hall's affidavit explains\n\nthat Wilson and other inmates were released from their cells into a\n\nlarger, open area, or dayroom, containing a telephone and\n\ntelevision for inmates' use, at 5:00 A.M. and that they remained\n\nthere until 10:00 P.M., when they returned to their cells for the\n\nnight. See R1-14, Hall Affidavit at 1-2. This open area \"provides\n\nspace where the inmates may participate in exercises such as\n\npush-ups, sit-ups and limited jogging, etc.\"13 Id. at 2; see Jones,\n\n636 F.2d at 1373 (noting that there was limited room for indoor\n\nexercise and that inmates did push-ups \"as their only form of\n\n       13\n           A Marshals Service inspection report states \"there is ample room in the day room areas\nfor inmates to do exercises.\" Government Exh. 1-7. Additionally, federal detainees, like other\ninmates housed at MCJ, also engage in indoor work detail, which involves sweeping, mopping,\nand scrubbing their cells, the common areas, and hallways that they occupy on a daily basis.\nSee R1-14, Exh. B at 10 (MCJ Standard Minimum Rules and Regulations). We note that these\nactivities provide some exercise.\n\n\n                                               21\n\fexercise in the jammed cells and day rooms\"). Wilson states that\n\nthe dayroom consisted of approximately 240 square feet of floor\n\nspace, which he shared with fifteen inmates, affording\n\napproximately fifteen square feet of floor space per man. See R1-\n\n35-1; id. App. B, Wilson Affidavit at 1. He further represents that\n\n\"even if it would be feas[i]ble to ex[er]cise in this area, it would only\n\nannoy the individuals using the phone, and obstruct the others[']\n\nv[ie]w of T.V. and could easily escalate into violent physical\n\nconfrontations,\" R1-35-1, and that \"[t]his area was sever[e]ly over\n\ncro[w]ded under the Federal Regulations,\" id. App. B, Wilson\n\nAffidavit at 1.\n\n     Despite Wilson's contentions of overcrowding, we note that he\n\ndoes not represent that there were more than sixteen inmates in\n\nthe dayroom, which was the maximum number specified in the\n\nintergovernmental agreement between the Marshals Service and\n\nthe local government. Furthermore, we have not granted relief for\n\nmore crowded conditions than Wilson experienced at MCJ in a\n\nfacility that housed both pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners.\n\n\n                                    22\n\fSee, e.g., Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1569 (\"During Hamm's incarceration\n\nthere, the jail's population at times exceeded the facility's design\n\ncapacity.\"). In Bell, the Supreme Court clarified that the relative\n\nbrevity of pretrial detainees' confinement allows spacial\n\nconfinement that involves \"genuine privations and hardship,\" which\n\nmight be questionable under the Due Process Clause if they\n\ncontinued \"over an extended period of time.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 542,\n\n99 S.Ct. at 1876. The Court also stated that federal court\n\ndecisions concerning minimum inmate space requirements as well\n\nas purported standards recommended by various groups with\n\nexpertise in correctional institutions may set goals, but that \"they\n\nsimply do not establish the constitutional minima.\"14 Id. at 543 n.27,\n\n99 S.Ct. at 1876 n.27. Recognizing the Bell mandate, \"we set no\n\nspace standards,\" Jones, 636 F.2d at 1376, in a similar institution\n\nwhere the dayroom sometimes afforded \"little more than six square\n\n       14\n          Even \"recommendations of the Federal Corrections Policy Task Force of the\nDepartment of Justice regarding conditions of confinement for pretrial detainees are not\ndetermininative of the requirements of the Constitution.\" Bell, 441 U.S. at 543 n.27, 99 S.Ct. at\n1876 n.27 (emphasis added). Consequently, the Marshals Service MCJ inspection report,\nrelevant to the time that Wilson was at MCJ, does not show a constitutional violation when it\nnotes that the dayroom was not in compliance with 35 square feet per inmate recommended by\nthe Marshals Service. See Government Exh. 2 at 2.\n\n                                               23\n\ffeet per inmate.\" Id. at 1374. Our court further has concluded that\n\n\"[i]t is equally clear that the due process clause does not purport to\n\nregulate the general conditions and quality of life in the country's\n\njails, and that the courts should not attempt to make 'judgment\n\ncalls' to determine which of various marginally different conditions\n\nmight be more appropriate.\" Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1573.\n\n     Rather than complaining that fifteen square feet per inmate is\n\ninsufficient space to do exercises such as push-ups, sit-ups, or\n\njogging in place, Wilson speculates that such exercises may annoy\n\nthe other inmates with the potential for physical confrontations.\n\nThere is no evidence in this record that any altercation occurred as\n\na result of Wilson's attempted indoor exercising during his stay at\n\nMCJ. Thus, Wilson has presented no documented reason that he\n\ncould not have engaged in indoor exercises while he was at MCJ,\n\nand he has not shown that Blankenship or Hall prevented him from\n\ndoing so for a punitive purpose. To the extent that Wilson\n\nrepresents that he developed high blood pressure because of the\n\nlack of an ability to exercise at MCJ, his medical history, attached to\n\n\n                                  24\n\fthe special report filed on behalf of the wardens and correctional\n\nofficers, shows that he was suffering from high blood pressure\n\nwhen he entered MCJ. His medical records while at MCJ further\n\nevidence that he received medication and was treated for his\n\nailments while there. Thus, Wilson's high blood pressure was not\n\ncaused by his detention at MCJ and his alleged inability to exercise\n\nthere.\n\n     In addition to having no discretionary authority to fund and to\n\nbuild an secure outdoor exercise facility at MCJ or to deviate from\n\nthe specifications of the intergovernmental agreement between the\n\nMarshals Service and the local government as to the number of\n\nfederal detainees housed at MCJ with the resulting implications for\n\ninmate space there, Blankenship and Hall violated no clearly\n\nestablished law in not providing Wilson outdoor exercise while he\n\nwas at MCJ or affording him more space for indoor exercise.\n\nApplying the Bell standard to confinement conditions, such as\n\nspace, is \"exceedingly difficult and does not provide clear results,\"\n\nwhich makes qualified immunity appropriate. Hamm, 774 F.2d at\n\n\n                                  25\n\f1573. Moreover, states, not wardens, \"can improve the quality and\n\nquantity\"of such conditions by \"increasing and properly\n\nadministering the amount of money they spend on a detention\n\nfacility\"; \"courts in most instances may not interfere with a state's\n\ndecision to provide detainees with a reasonable level and quality of\n\nfood, living space, and medical care.\" Id.                    Additionally, under a\n\ntotality of confinement conditions analysis, Wilson's complaints are\n\nfew in comparison to other cases where we have not given relief\n\nbecause we determined that the confinement conditions were not\n\nconstitutional violations. See, e.g., id. at 1569-70 (noting that\n\nobjectionable confinement conditions at county jail included\n\novercrowding, sleeping on tables or the floor, unsanitary floor and\n\nlinens, occasional foreign objects in the food). On the facts of this\n\ncase, Blankenship and Hall are entitled to qualified immunity.15\n\n       15\n          We note that our decision would be the same under an Eighth Amendment analysis\napplicable to the brief time that Wilson returned to MCJ after his conviction and before he was\nmoved to his designated federal penitentiary to serve his sentence. Our court has held that the\nminimum standard of the Due Process Clause relative to basic necessities, such as living space,\n\"is the same as that allowed by the eighth amendment for convicted persons.\" Hamm, 774 F.2d\nat 1574. \"The Supreme Court . . . has not set forth a standard for determining what level of\nnecessities the due process clause absolutely requires.\" Id. Consequently, in addition to having\nno ability to create exercise space at MCJ as part of their discretionary responsibilities,\nBlakenship and Hall violated no clearly established law under the Eighth Amendment with\n\n                                               26\n\fC. Correctional Officers\n\n       Wilson contends that correctional officers Parks and Hopkins\n\nalso denied him access to a law library and exercise as well as\n\nplaced him in disciplinary isolation without proper bedding. There\n\nis no evidence in the record that Parks or Hopkins had any\n\ndiscretionary authority regarding implementing policies or\n\nprocedures at MCJ; consequently, they were not responsible for\n\nthe lack of a law library or exercise space at MCJ. As we\n\nadditionally have discussed, the lack of a law library, outdoor\n\nexercise, or more space for indoor exercise did not violate clearly\n\nestablished law as to Wilson's constitutional rights while he was at\n\nMCJ. Accordingly, Parks and Hopkins are entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity concerning these issues. We limit our analysis to\n\nWilson's complaints concerning his disciplinary isolation.\n\n       Wilson represents that, on two separate occasions, Parks and\n\nHopkins each placed him in disciplinary isolation as sanctions for\n\n\n\n\nrespect to Wilson during the time that he was at MCJ, which also would entitle them to qualified\nimmunity.\n\n                                               27\n\fhis misconduct.16 See R1-35, App. B, Wilson Affidavit at 1. He\n\nfurther states that he \"was forced to sleep on a bare floor, which\n\nwas both degrading and inhumane.\" Id. at 1. The magistrate judge\n\nordered Hopkins to respond to Wilson's allegations. Hopkins\n\nexplained that she placed Wilson in an isolation cell because he\n\nwas inciting other inmates to disobey an order to lower the noise in\n\ntheir cellblock and that it was her professional opinion that he had\n\nto be removed to maintain security in the cellblock. See R1-39,\n\nHopkins Affidavit at 1-2. She further avers that MCJ inmates who\n\nremain in isolation are given bedding and that Wilson was not\n\nrequired to sleep on the floor. Id. In a report describing the\n\nincident to Warden Hall, Hopkins states that Wilson was not calm\n\nwhen her shift terminated and that it was the responsibility of the\n\nnext shift to provide bedding for inmates who remained in isolation\n\nafter lock down and lights out. See R1-38, Exh. A. Even accepting\n\n       16\n          Wilson has not placed in the record the specifics of his alleged disciplinary isolation by\nParks. Because Wilson \"bear[s] the responsibility of ensuring that the record is complete,\" and\nhe \"has given us no reason to believe he was unable to do so,\" we are unable to address his\nallegations relating to Parks.

Walker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501897\"><a href=\"/opinion/501897/united-states-v-verna-lee-walker/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1485 n.2 (11th Cir. 1988)\n(per curiam). Therefore, Parks is entitled to qualified immunity because we will not hold a\ngovernment official personally liable for compensatory and punitive damages based on mere\nallegations. See Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1149-50.\n\n                                                28\n\fWilson's account that he was not provided bedding in the isolation\n\ncell, the correctional officer on duty at lock down and lights out\n\nwould be the individual who allegedly deprived Wilson of bedding\n\nand not Hopkins. Additionally, it is unclear from the record whether\n\nWilson actually spent the night or several hours in the isolation cell.\n\nWe also are mindful that our court has not found an inmate's\n\nsleeping on a table while in confinement, but not isolation, not to be\n\nviolative of any constitutional rights. See Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1569.\n\n     Significantly, Wilson was placed in disciplinary isolation to\n\nquell a disturbance that he was causing on the cellblock at night.\n\n\"[P]reserving internal order and discipline are essential goals that\n\nmay require limitation or retraction of the retained constitutional\n\nrights of both convicted prisoners and pretrial detainees.\" Bell, 441\n\nU.S. at 546, 99 S.Ct. at 1878; see Hamm, 774 F.2d at 1573\n\n(\"Legitimate restraints may stem from the state's need to manage\n\nthe detention facility and maintain security.\"). Prison officials have\n\n\"wide-ranging deference in the adoption and execution of policies\n\nand practices that in their judgment are needed to preserve internal\n\n\n                                   29\n\forder and discipline and to maintain institutional security.\" Bell, 441\n\nU.S. at 547, 99 S.Ct. at 1878. Because courts are not in a position\n\nto evaluate urgent problems that occur in prison administration, we\n\ndo not second-guess prison officials on matters that they are better\n\nequipped to handle under the exigencies of an internal disturbance.\n\nSee id. at 531, 99 S.Ct. at 1870. Wilson's temporary placement in\n\ndisciplinary isolation for the legitimate purpose of quieting him on\n\nthe facts of this record was not unconstitutional even without\n\nbedding and did not violate any clearly established law at the\n\nrelevant time. Accordingly, we conclude that Parks and Hopkins\n\nare entitled to qualified immunity concerning Wilson's placement in\n\ndisciplinary isolation.17\n\n                                   III. CONCLUSION\n\n       In this Bivens and ยง 1983 case, Wilson has alleged that a\n\nfederal marshal, MCJ wardens and correctional officers violated his\n\n       17\n           To the extent that Wilson suggests that he was deprived of due process because he was\nconfined in disciplinary isolation without a hearing, \"the Due Process Clause does not directly\nprotect an inmate from changes in the conditions of his confinement.\" Chandler v.
