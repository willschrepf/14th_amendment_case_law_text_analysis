ROGERS, Petitioners v.\n    COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, Respondent\n\n\n\nDocket No. 7390-10.                          Filed July 17, 2014.\n\n\n\n       In 2004 Ps owned and operated several tiered business entities\nthat promoted tax sheltered investments involving the purchase and\nsale of Brazilian receivables, brokered and developed real property,\nand attempted to bring a medical device to market. Ps failed to report\nas income some of the gross receipts of their business entities, and Ps\ncontend that the unreported amounts were held “in trust” for another\nrelated entity. Ps’ business entities claimed deductions associated\nwith their operations that Ps could not substantiate.\n\n      Ps also failed to report on Schedule C all of the income from\nP-H’s attorney activity, claimed some deductions for that activity that\nthey could not substantiate, and failed to deduct certain amounts that\nthey did expend.\n\n      By notice of deficiency issued in 2010, R determined that Ps\ndid not report all of their income and that some of their claimed\n\f                                         -2-\n\n      [*2] deductions were unsubstantiated and must be disallowed. R also\n      determined that Ps are liable for an accuracy-related penalty.\n\n             Held: With a few exceptions, Ps failed to substantiate their\n      entitlement to business expense deductions beyond those R already\n      allowed.\n\n           Held, further, Ps failed to include certain amounts in gross\n      income that should have been reported on their tax return.\n\n            Held, further, certain receipts of one of Ps’ business entities\n      were not held in trust and were properly includable in that entity’s\n      gross\n      receipts.\n\n             Held, further, Ps are liable for an accuracy-related penalty.\n\n\n\n      John E. Rogers, for petitioners.\n\n      Ronald S. Collins, Jr., for respondent.\n\n\n\n            MEMORANDUM FINDINGS OF FACT AND OPINION\n\n\n      GUSTAFSON, Judge: The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) issued to\n\npetitioners, John E. and Frances L. Rogers, a statutory notice of deficiency\n\npursuant to section 62121 on December 29, 2009, for petitioners’ 2004 tax year.\n\n      1\n      Unless otherwise indicated, all citations of sections refer to the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C.; “Code”) as in effect for 2004, and all citations\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\f                                         -3-\n\n[*3] In the notice the IRS determined that petitioners had a deficiency in tax of\n\n$466,117 and that they are liable for a corresponding failure-to-file addition to tax\n\nof $100,824 and an accuracy-related penalty of $37,908. This case arises from\n\npetitioners’ timely petition pursuant to section 6213 for redetermination of the\n\ndeficiency and the penalties in the notice of deficiency.\n\n      After stipulations by the parties, the issues for decision are: (1) whether\n\npetitioners substantiated their entitlement to business expense deductions beyond\n\nthose that respondent allowed (with a few exceptions, we hold that they did not);\n\n(2) whether petitioners failed to include certain amounts in gross income that\n\nshould have been reported on their return (we hold that they did to the extent\n\ndescribed below); (3) whether certain receipts of Mr. Rogers’ business entity were\n\nheld in trust or were includable in the entity’s gross receipts (we hold they were\n\nincludable in the entity’s gross receipts); and (4) whether petitioners are liable for\n\nthe accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 (we hold that they are).\n\n                               FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      At the time they filed their petition, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers resided in Illinois.\n\nIn 2004 Mr. Rogers worked as an attorney and Mrs. Rogers worked as a realtor.\n\n\n      1\n       (...continued)\nof Rules refer to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure.\n\f                                         -4-\n\nIn addition, Mr. Rogers operated a number of entities, including A&G Investors\n\nIII, Portfolio Properties, Inc. (“PPI”), Sterling Ridge, Inc., Jetstream Business, Ltd.\n\n[*4] (“Jetstream”), Abingdon Trading, LLC (“Abingdon”), and Lucas & Rogers\n\nCapital, Inc. (“L&R”). Most of the adjustments in dispute relate to income and\n\ndeductions Mr. Rogers claimed for PPI activities and in connection with his\n\nactivities as an attorney.\n\nFrances L. Rogers\n\n      During 2004 Mrs. Rogers earned a salary as an associate principal of a\n\nChicago area high school. She was also a licensed real estate broker and an\n\nattorney.\n\nJohn E. Rogers\n\n      As we have previously found:2\n\n             Rogers is a tax attorney with over 40 years of experience. He\n      received a law degree from Harvard University in 1967 and a\n      master’s degree in business administration from the University of\n      Chicago. He worked in the tax department of Arthur Andersen for\n      over 24 years before serving for 7 years as the tax director and\n      assistant treasurer at FMC Corp. In 2003 Rogers was a partner with\n\n      2\n        For 2003 (the year before the 2004 taxable year at issue) petitioners\nlitigated their income tax liability in Rogers v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo.\n2011-277 (“Rogers I”), aff’d, 728 F.3d 673 (7th Cir. 2013). That 2003 case\ninvolved issues equivalent to some of the issues in this 2004 case. Our record in\nthis case establishes many of the facts that we also found in Rogers I, and those\nfacts are noted below.\n\f                                           -5-\n\n      the law firm Altheimer & Gray until its bankruptcy on June 30, 2003.\n      For the remainder of the year Rogers was a partner with the law firm\n\n\n      [*5] Seyfarth Shaw, LLP. [Rogers v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo.\n      2011-277 (“Rogers I”), slip op. at 3, aff’d, 728 F.3d 673 (7th Cir.\n      2013).]\n\nMr. Rogers’ partnership at Seyfarth Shaw, LLP (“Seyfarth Shaw”), continued\n\nthrough 2004, and in that year he received compensation from the firm (about\n\nwhich there is no dispute in this case).\n\n      In addition, Mr. Rogers conducted activity on his own in 2004, for which he\n\nreceived compensation and for which he attached to his 2004 return a Schedule C,\n\n“Profit or Loss From Business”, that identified the business activity as “Attorney”.\n\nIn 2004 he also promoted to clients “tax-advantaged” transactions that dealt with\n\nthe acquisition of, and sales of indirect interests in, Brazilian consumer\n\nreceivables, using multiple entities that he controlled (as discussed below).3\n\nPPI, Jetstream, and Sugarloaf\n\n            Rogers set up three business entities to manage numerous\n      holding and trading companies used in the Brazilian receivable\n\n      3\n        The details of these transactions are currently being litigated in the separate\ncase of Sugarloaf Fund, LLC v. Commissioner, docket No. 671-10. The instant\ncase is an offshoot of those transactions, though the consumer receivables\ntransactions themselves are not before us. Rather, at issue here is the income to\nMr. Rogers (either directly or indirectly from his entities) for his promotion of the\ntransactions.\n\f                                         -6-\n\n      transactions. The first, PPI, was incorporated under the laws of\n      Illinois on April 1, 1989, and elected on January 1, 1992, to be treated\n      as an S corporation under section 1361(a)(1). Rogers was its sole\n      shareholder. The second, Jetstream Business Limited (Jetstream), a\n      [*6] British Virgin Islands limited company, was formed by Rogers\n      with PPI as its sole shareholder. Rogers was Jetstream’s only\n      director. In 2003 Jetstream was treated as a disregarded entity for\n      Federal tax purposes. * * * [Rogers I, slip op. at 3-4.]\n\n      Mr. Rogers formed the third entity in 2001--the Delaware limited liability\n\ncompany called Sugarloaf. In 2004 Jetstream was the managing member and tax\n\nmatters partner of Sugarloaf. Thus, in 2004 Mr. Rogers had control over PPI,\n\nJetstream, and Sugarloaf. During 2004 Sugarloaf entered into transactions directly\n\nand through affiliated entities for, in effect, acquiring distressed Brazilian\n\nconsumer accounts receivable and selling interests in them to numerous investors\n\nthrough trading and holding companies. Sugarloaf was a putative partnership\n\nsubject to the unified partnership audit procedures of TEFRA (sections 6221-\n\n6234). Mr. Rogers indirectly owned an interest of no more than 1% in Sugarloaf,\n\nthrough PPI and Jetstream.\n\nAbingdon Trading\n\n      During 2004 Mr. Rogers was also a member of Abingdon, which engaged in\n\nvarious business ventures, the specifics of which are not relevant to this case. In\n\nthat year he received a $9,000 partnership distribution from Abingdon.\n\f                                        -7-\n\n\n\n[*7] Mr. Rogers’ business income\n\n      In 2004 Mr. Rogers received the following payments from the following\n\nsources:4\n\n                               Entity                  Amount\n                   PPI                                $413,000\n                   Sugarloaf                             50,000\n                   Jetstream                             20,000\n                   Peninsula Yorkshire Fund              10,000\n                   Abingdon                               9,000\n                     Total                             502,000\n\nOf that total, Mr. Rogers reported on Schedule C only $284,600, which the parties\n\nagree included $178,000 of the amount he received from PPI. Mr. Rogers did not\n\nreport the remaining $235,000 distribution from PPI as income in 2004.\n\nPetitioners had no obligation to transfer the $235,000 to anyone, to hold the funds\n\nin escrow, or to segregate the funds from their personal funds. However, in 2004\n\nMr. Rogers made capital contributions of $395,900 to PPI (which was, as we\n\n\n\n      4\n       Petitioners did not report all these amounts on their return, but the IRS\ndiscovered them during its examination, when it performed a bank deposits\nanalysis on petitioners’ joint checking account at LaSalle Bank (ending in 8121) to\ndetermine the amount of petitioners’ gross income in 2004.\n\f                                        -8-\n\nstated, his wholly owned S corporation).\n\n[*8] In connection with his business activities, Mr. Rogers used his home and\n\nvehicles and incurred certain expenses, which he deducted on his Schedule C.\n\nAfter stipulations, the deductibility of $127,756 of the claimed expenses remains\n\nin dispute. Those disputed expenses are listed in appendix A to this opinion.\n\n      Under the burden of proof and legal principles discussed in part IV, below,\n\nwe find that Mr. Rogers incurred, in connection with his “Attorney” activity, only\n\na portion of these disputed expenses--i.e., deductible business gift expenses of\n\n$100, copying expenses of $14, dues and subscriptions expenses of $156, and\n\nbusiness travel expenses of $30,230 on behalf of PPI (deductible on Schedule C);\n\nand that he incurred $4,308 of unreimbursed employee business expenses\n\n(deductible on Schedule A, “Itemized Deductions”) in connection with his\n\nemployment at Seyfarth Shaw.\n\n      We find that petitioners have not substantiated either the expenditure or the\n\nbusiness purpose (or both) of the remaining $91,343 of the expenses listed in\n\nappendix A and discussed in part IV below.\n\nLucas & Rogers Capital, Inc.\n\n      L&R was a second S corporation for which Mr. Rogers was the sole\n\nshareholder. Its activity included a real estate brokerage business, holding\n\f                                        -9-\n\nlicenses for real estate brokers, and property management for third parties. The\n\n[*9] record contains no evidence that PPI owned any interest in L&R, nor any\n\nevidence that L&R owned any interest in PPI. But for reasons we cannot tell, PPI\n\nshared a bank account with L&R, which we refer to as the “joint PPI/L&R\n\naccount”.\n\n      For 2004, on its return prepared by Mr. Rogers, L&R reported $450,000 of\n\ngross receipts, and PPI deducted $450,000 as “L&R fees” on its Form 1120S,\n\n“U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation”; but the parties have stipulated\n\nthat no transfer of $450,000 was ever made. We find that L&R did not receive the\n\nincome it reported, and that PPI did not incur the expense it deducted.\n\nPPI’s and L&R’s gross receipts\n\n      Total deposits into the joint PPI/L&R account equaled $1,566,960 in 2004.\n\nOf the total deposits, $389,900 was capital contributions made to PPI by\n\nMr. Rogers; and $67,911 of the total deposits was the proceeds of a loan. Neither\n\nthe capital contributions nor the loan proceeds were taxable income of PPI or\n\nL&R. The remaining $1,108,786 consisted of taxable deposits that were gross\n\nreceipts of either PPI or L&R. In addition, PPI received income that was not\n\ndeposited into the joint PPI/L&R account, but that was recorded on PPI’s general\n\nledger as income: (a) $34,000 from “Agresti” recorded as “Management Income”;\n\f                                       - 10 -\n\n(b) a $2,000 payment by “Peabody”; and (c) $200,000 from an unknown source\n\n[*10] recorded as “income”. Neither Sugarloaf, Jetstream, PPI, nor petitioners\n\nthemselves had any obligation to transfer any of these receipts to anyone, to hold\n\nthe funds in escrow, or to segregate the funds from any other use. PPI’s and\n\nL&R’s taxable receipts from the above sources therefore totaled $1,344,786--\n\n$1,271,070 attributable to PPI and $73,716 to L&R.5\n\nPPI’s business expenses\n\n      In 2004 PPI rented office space in Homer Glen, Illinois, from Palos Bank.\n\nFor that office and other reported expenses, PPI claimed deductions on its 2004\n\ntax return. After stipulations, the deductibility of $608,310 of those expenses\n\nremains in dispute. Those disputed expenses are listed in appendix B to this\n\n\n      5\n        PPI did not report all of those receipts. Rather, on its 2004 Form 1120S\nPPI reported only $846,070 (later adjusted by agreement of the parties to\n$846,066) of gross receipts or sales consisting of: $149,966 from real estate\ncommissions; $34,000 from Thomas Agresti; $124,500 from GTG Corp.;\n$220,000 from Multicred Investamentados Limitada (“Multicred”); $137,500 from\nRaul Marquez; $90,000 from Thomas McKelvey; and $90,100 from two\nunidentified sources. The parties also stipulated that PPI received $425,000 from\nSugarloaf during 2004, none of which was reported on PPI’s return. If that\namount is added to the gross receipts that PPI did report, the resulting total is\n$1,271,070, which we find is the portion of the gross receipts attributable to PPI.\nWe attribute the remaining $73,716 to L&R, since the record seems to show some\nactivity by L&R in 2004, and it is the sole apparent possible recipient of those\nreceipts. Whether received by PPI or L&R, the income ultimately flows through\nto petitioners.\n\f                                       - 11 -\n\nopinion.\n\n[*11] Under the burden of proof and legal principles discussed in part I below,\n\nwe find that PPI incurred the following deductible expenses:\n\n                          Expense                              Amount\n             Commissions:\n                Portfolio Asset Recovery\n                Consultoria e Assessoria\n                Empresarial LTDA                               $50,000\n                Multicred Investamentados\n                Limitada                                        25,000\n                Other commissions                               17,465\n             Meals and entertainment                              402\n               Total                                            92,867\n\n      We find that petitioners have not substantiated either the expenditure or the\n\nbusiness purpose (or both) of the remaining $515,443 of the expenses listed in\n\nappendix B and discussed in part V.B below.\n\n      One of the larger disputed deductions that we find unsubstantiated was “PTI\n\nSubsidy”. Portfolio Technologies, Inc. (“PTI”), was an Illinois corporation\n\norganized in 1997 by Mr. Rogers. He remained a shareholder and officer of the\n\ncompany throughout 2004. PTI was involved in bringing a new medical device to\n\nmarket, which ultimately resulted in PTI’s involvement in patent litigation.\n\f                                        - 12 -\n\nMr. Rogers testified he was “the largest shareholder eventually” of PTI, though the\n\n[*12] precise extent of his ownership interest in PTI was not established at trial.\n\n(L&R also owned an unspecified number of shares in PTI during 2004. The\n\nrecord contains no evidence that PPI, Jetstream, or Sugarloaf owned any interest in\n\nPTI.) The evidence at trial did not establish whether PTI was solvent or insolvent,\n\nbut it is clear that PTI was under threat from an infringer. Mr. Rogers owned a\n\nresidual or royalty right to PTI’s profits after large bank loans had been paid off,\n\nand the value of that right depended on PTI’s survival. The alleged “PTI Subsidy”\n\nexpense consisted of two payments by Mr. Rogers to Global Protection Corp.\n\n(“GPC”). GPC held shares of PTI from 1998 until 2010, and it provided\n\nmanagement services to PTI during that time. The purpose of these payments is\n\nundocumented, but we assume the correctness of Mr. Rogers’ explanation that, in\n\n2004,\n\n        the other major shareholder in the business and the manager of Global\n        Protection Corp had exhausted its lines of credit and borrowing\n        ability and cash flow in getting the product manufactured and\n        distributed. And this was some payments I made so that the boxes in\n        which the product would be put on the shelf as well as the materials\n        to finish the inventory. The product had been sold and this was a\n        bridge to get the product to market les[t] Global Protection go under\n        as well as Portfolio Technologies.\n\n              THE COURT: So, when you talk about payments being made,\n        you’re talking about the $104,182?\n\f                                       - 13 -\n\n              MR. ROGERS: Yes.\n\n             [*13] THE COURT: All right. So the purpose of that [“PTI\n       Subsidy” payment] was to get the product out into the stores?\n\n              MR. ROGERS: Yes. And one more time, I do not view that as\n       a payment to Portfolio Technologies. I view that as a payment to\n       protect my interest on the royalties and positioning the product so we\n       can demonstrate damages for both predatory pricing as well as patent\n       infringement because they [an infringer] took our premium pricing\n       away * * *.\n\nMr. Rogers’ description shows that these payments were contributions to PTI’s\n\ncapital, made to protect Mr. Rogers’ investment in PTI and his prospect of future\n\nprofit from it.\n\nFMC stock option exercise\n\n       Mr. Rogers received a stock option benefit from his former employer, FMC,\n\nwhich he exercised in 2004. To do so, he opened a special account at the\n\nbrokerage firm Charles Schwab and, on November 24, 2009, deposited $150,000\n\ninto that Schwab account to fund the purchase. At the time of the transaction, the\n\noption price was $165,397.52, but the trading price was $251,168.54--a difference\n\nof $85,770.62, which constituted the employer-granted benefit of the option (and\n\nwas close to the amount--$86,034.42--that FMC later reported on Form W-2,\n\n“Wage and Tax Statement”). Schwab paid FMC the option price ($165,397.52)\n\nplus the employee portion of tax withholding computed to be due on the gain\n\f                                        - 14 -\n\n($30,671.24), totaling $196,068.76. The difference between that amount and\n\n[*14] Mr. Rogers’ $150,000 deposit--i.e., $46,068.76--constituted a loan or\n\n“margin” from Schwab to Mr. Rogers. Schwab then immediately sold the FMC\n\nshares for their market price ($251,168.54), evidently retained a portion of it to\n\nrecover its loan ($46,068.76) plus a few days of interest thereon, and therefore\n\nowed Mr. Rogers approximately $205,000 on this transaction. Schwab remitted to\n\nMr. Rogers only $175,000, which was deposited into Mr. Rogers’ account on\n\nDecember 10, 2004, and thus retained a balance of about $30,000.6\n\n      Mr. Rogers received from FMC a Form W-2 reporting wage income of\n\n$86,034.32, and petitioners reported that amount on their return as wages.\n\nMr. Rogers also received a Form 1099 from Schwab, reporting the entire\n\n$251,168.54 of gross proceeds of the stock sale, and petitioners reported that\n\namount on Schedule D, “Captial Gains and Losses”, of their return, but they\n\nreported zero gain from the transaction--consistent with their having already\n\nreported their gain as wages on line 7 of Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax\n\nReturn”.\n\n      When the IRS later examined petitioners’ return and analyzed their bank\n\n      6\n       The record does not show whether or when Schwab repaid this $30,000\nbalance to Mr. Rogers, but the fact is immaterial since, if and when it was paid, it\nwas a return of capital to Mr. Rogers.\n\f                                       - 15 -\n\ndeposits, it found the Schwab deposit of $175,000, saw no such income item\n\n[*15] reported on the return, and concluded it was taxable receipts from\n\nMr. Rogers’ Schedule C activity. (It was not.)\n\nNotice of deficiency and Tax Court petition\n\n      The IRS examined petitioners’ 2004 income tax return and, in that process,\n\nperformed the bank deposits analyses described above. The IRS determined that\n\npetitioners had unreported income and claimed improper and excessive\n\ndeductions. Respondent issued a statutory notice of deficiency to petitioners\n\ndetermining a deficiency in tax, as well as additions to tax and penalties under\n\nsections 6651(a)(1) and 6662, and petitioners timely petitioned this Court.\n\n                                     OPINION\n\nI.    General principles\n\n      A.     Burden of proof\n\n      The IRS’s determinations are presumed correct, and taxpayers generally\n\nbear the burden to prove their entitlement to any deductions they claim.\n\nRule 142(a); Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115 (1933). Taxpayers must\n\nsatisfy the specific requirements for any deduction claimed. INDOPCO, Inc. v.\n\nCommissioner, 503 U.S. 79, 84 (1992). “[S]tatements in briefs * * * do not\n\nconstitute evidence”, Rule 143(c), and cannot supplement the record,\n\f                                        - 16 -\n\nNiedringhaus v. Commissioner, 99 T.C. 202, 214 n. 7 (1992). Rather, taxpayers\n\n[*16] must carry the burden of proof with evidence offered at trial, which their\n\nbriefs should cite.7 Where the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to support\n\nthat a particular expense is deductible, we must sustain the IRS’s determinations\n\nand disallow the deduction.\n\n      Petitioners contend that, with respect to the $50,000 deposit from Sugarloaf\n\nto petitioners’ individual bank account, the burden of proof shifts to respondent\n\nunder section 7491(b), which provides that the burden shifts as to “any item of\n\nincome which was reconstructed by the Secretary solely through the use of\n\nstatistical information on unrelated taxpayers”. But in fact, respondent used\n\npetitioners’ own bank records to reconstruct their income, and not “statistical\n\ninformation on unrelated taxpayers”. The burden of proof with respect to this\n\n$50,000 deposit does not shift to respondent. They also contend that the burden\n\nshifts on this issue under section 7491(a)(1), which shifts the burden when (among\n\n\n      7\n        See Rule 151(e)(3) (“All briefs * * * shall contain * * * [p]roposed\nfindings of fact * * * based on the evidence * * *. * * * [T]here shall be inserted\nreferences to the pages of the transcript or the exhibits or other sources relied upon\nto support the statement.”); Adeyemo v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2014-1,\nat *28; D’Errico v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2012-149, slip op. at 19 (“We need\nnot (and will not) undertake the work of sorting through every piece of evidence\npetitioners have provided in an attempt to find support for petitioners’ ultimate\nlegal positions taken in this case”).\n\f                                        - 17 -\n\nother things) a taxpayer “introduces credible evidence with respect to any factual\n\n[*17] issue”. But in fact, as to the factual issue of repayment of a supposed loan\n\nby Mr. Rogers to Sugarloaf, petitioners introduced no loan documents nor any\n\naccounting records to corroborate Mr. Rogers’ testimony. “Credible evidence”\n\nwas thus lacking on this issue, and the burden of proof did not shift.\n\n      B.     Record-keeping\n\n      Section 6001 requires that--\n\n             Every person liable for any tax imposed by this title, or for the\n      collection thereof, shall keep such records, render such statements,\n      make such returns, and comply with such rules and regulations as the\n      Secretary may from time to time prescribe. * * * [Emphasis added.]\n\nTaxpayers are thus required to keep sufficient records to substantiate their gross\n\nincome, deductions, credits, and other tax attributes. See also 26 C.F.R.\n\nsec. 1.6001-1(a), Income Tax Regs. Taxpayers must retain their books and records\n\nas long as they may become material:\n\n             (e) Retention of records.--The books or records required by\n      this section shall be kept at all times available for inspection by\n      authorized internal revenue officers or employees, and shall be\n      retained so long as the contents thereof may become material in the\n      administration of any internal revenue law. [Emphasis added.]\n\n26 C.F.R. sec. 1.6001-1(e). The failure to keep and present such records counts\n\nheavily against a taxpayer’s attempted proof. For many of the disputed deductions\n\f                                        - 18 -\n\nin this case, petitioners lack real business records, and they attempt to rely on bank\n\n[*18] records of commingled personal and business activities, reconstructions, and\n\ndisorganized receipts.\n\n      C.     Deductible character\n\n      To prove entitlement to deduct an expense, the taxpayer must prove not only\n\nthe fact of the expenditure but also the business purpose (or other deductible\n\ncharacter) of the expense. “Business expenses deductible from gross income\n\ninclude the ordinary and necessary expenditures directly connected with or\n\npertaining to the taxpayer’s trade or business”. 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a), Income\n\nTax Regs. (emphasis added). The taxpayer must show that a reported business\n\nexpense was incurred primarily for business rather than personal reasons and that\n\nthere was a proximate relationship between the expense and the business.\n\nWalliser v. Commissioner, 72 T.C. 433, 437 (1979). With respect to most of the\n\ndeductions disallowed in this opinion, petitioners were unable to prove that the\n\nexpenditures were ordinary and necessary business expenses (as opposed to\n\npersonal expenditures or capital expenditures).\n\nII.   $175,000 from FMC stock option transaction\n\n      During the course of its examination, the IRS determined that a $175,000\n\ndeposit from Charles Schwab was includable in petitioners’ gross income. At trial\n\f                                       - 19 -\n\nMr. Rogers persuasively demonstrated that the deposit arose from a stock option\n\n[*19] transaction with his former employer, FMC. The $86,000 of gain from that\n\ntransaction was in fact reported by petitioners on their Form 1040 as wages, and\n\nwe have found that the remainder of the proceeds constituted a return of capital.\n\nPetitioners therefore realized no unreported income in conjunction with the\n\n$175,000 deposit.\n\nIII.   Petitioners’ unreported business income\n\n       Respondent contends that petitioners failed to report on their 2004 Form\n\n1040 certain amounts that Mr. Rogers received from his business activities.8\n\nGross income includes all income from whatever source derived. Sec. 61. Every\n\ntaxpayer must keep records sufficient to determine the taxpayer’s tax liability.\n\nSec. 6001; see also sec. 1.6001-1(a). Where the taxpayer does not keep books and\n\nrecords sufficient to determine taxable income, the IRS may reconstruct income by\n\nexamining the taxpayer’s bank accounts. DiLeo v. Commissioner, 96 T.C. 858,\n\n\n       8\n        Respondent contends that Mr. Rogers had no real, distinct Schedule C\nactivity; but respondent does argue that the items are taxable income, and\nrespondent stipulated that PPI paid Mr. Rogers $178,000 and that he did report it\non Schedule C. That reporting appears appropriate, and we therefore treat that\namount (plus the $10,000 from Peninsula Yorkshire Fund and the $50,000 from\nSugarloaf) as Schedule C income. The $20,000 from Jetstream, the $9,000 from\nAbingdon, and the additional $235,000 from PPI are items properly reported on\nSchedule E, “Supplemental Income and Loss”.\n\f                                        - 20 -\n\n867 (1991), aff’d, 959 F.2d 16 (2d Cir. 1992). Under the bank deposits method of\n\n[*20] reconstructing income, all bank deposits are prima facie evidence of income.\n\nParks v. Commissioner, 94 T.C. 654, 658 (1990). All money deposited into a\n\ntaxpayer’s bank account during the relevant period constitutes taxable income so\n\nlong as the Government accounts for the non-taxable source of any income of\n\nwhich it has knowledge. DiLeo v. Commissioner, 96 T.C. at 867.\n\n      To support its determinations, the IRS analyzed the deposits to petitioners’\n\npersonal bank account in order to reconstruct petitioners’ income for the tax year\n\n2004. After accounting for amounts (totaling $450,703) that the parties stipulated\n\nwere reported on line 7 of petitioners’ Form 1040 as wage income, the IRS’s bank\n\ndeposits analysis identified a total of $677,000 of additional deposits into\n\npetitioners’ personal bank account. Of that amount, the $175,000 deposit from the\n\nstock option transaction constituted a non-taxable return of capital. Mr. Rogers\n\nreported only $284,600 on his Schedule C.\n\n      A.     Income amounts to be determined under Rule 155\n\n      Of the $502,000 of deposits to be accounted for, $264,000 was distributions\n\nfrom Mr. Rogers’ business entities, the tax consequences of which will be\n\ndetermined under Rule 155, as explained below.\n\f                                        - 21 -\n\n[*21]         1.    $235,000 from PPI\n\n        The parties agree that Mr. Rogers received deposits totaling $413,000 in\n\n2004 from PPI, an S corporation owned entirely by Mr. Rogers. As we have\n\nnoted, the parties also agree that $178,000 of that total was commissions paid to\n\nMr. Rogers and properly accounted for as “Gross Income” on his Schedule C.\n\nMr. Rogers asserted at trial that the remaining PPI deposits totaling $235,000 were\n\ndistributions to him from PPI over the course of the 2004 tax year, that they were\n\nexceeded by $395,900 of contributions to PPI’s capital that Mr. Rogers made\n\nduring 2004, and that PPI’s distributions to Mr. Rogers should be taxed according\n\nto the applicable S corporation rules. Respondent made no legal or statutory\n\nargument to the contrary, and we hold that the tax rules governing S corporations\n\nwill determine the tax treatment of the $235,000 PPI distributed to Mr. Rogers in\n\n2004, just as equivalent amounts were determined for 2003 in Rogers I:\n\n               On its face, the * * * [$235,000] transfer[red] from PPI to\n        Rogers is a distribution from an S corporation to a shareholder.\n        Generally, section 1368(b) provides that distributions from an S\n        corporation with no accumulated earnings and profits (E&P) of a\n        predecessor C corporation are not included in the gross income of the\n        shareholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted basis of\n        the shareholder’s stock, and any excess over adjusted basis is treated\n        as gain from the sale or exchange of property. If the S corporation\n        has accumulated E&P of a predecessor C corporation, then the\n        portion of the distributions in excess of the S corporation’s\n        accumulated adjustment account (AAA) is treated as a dividend to the\n\f                                       - 22 -\n\n      [*22] extent it does not exceed the accumulated E&P. Sec.\n      1368(c)(1) and (2). The AAA is intended to measure the accumulated\n      taxable income of an S corporation that has not been distributed to the\n      shareholders. See Williams v. Commissioner, 110 T.C. 27, 30\n      (1998). The portion of a distribution to a shareholder that does not\n      exceed the AAA is a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the\n      shareholder’s adjusted basis in S corporation stock. Sec. 1368(b) and\n      (c)(1). The AAA is increased for the S corporation’s income and\n      decreased for the S corporation’s losses and deductions and for\n      nontaxable distributions to shareholders. See secs. 1367 and 1368.\n\n            Section 1366(a)(1) provides that a shareholder shall take into\n      account his or her pro rata share of the S corporation’s items of\n      income, loss, deduction, or credit for the S corporation’s taxable year\n      ending with or in the shareholder’s taxable year. Section 1367\n      provides that basis in S corporation stock is increased by income\n      passed through to the shareholder under section 1366(a)(1), and\n      decreased by, inter alia, distributions not includable in the\n      shareholder’s income pursuant to section 1368.\n\n             Unless a statutory or legal principle applies to remove the\n      [$235,000] distribution from the S corporation rules described above,\n      these rules will govern whether the * * * [$235,000] distribution from\n      PPI to Rogers is income to petitioners and, if so, the character of that\n      income. * * * [Rogers I, slip op. at 9-11.]\n\nConsequently, here, as in Rogers I, “[a] Rule 155 computation of PPI’s E&P and\n\nAAA, as well as Rogers’ basis in his PPI stock, is required to make a final\n\ndetermination” of the taxability of the $235,000 distribution from PPI. Id.\n\nat 17-18.\n\f                                        - 23 -\n\n[*23]          2.    $20,000 from Jetstream\n\n         The IRS identified $20,000 deposited into petitioners’ account from\n\nJetstream, a British Virgin Islands company wholly owned by PPI during 2004 and\n\ndisregarded for Federal income tax purposes. Mr. Rogers disputes the IRS’s\n\ncategorization of this amount as gross income. At trial, he claimed that this\n\namount was a “return of principal” from Jetstream for amounts advanced to\n\nJetstream through PPI. As Jetstream was disregarded for U.S. Federal income tax\n\npurposes, these amounts will be treated in the same way as the $235,000 in\n\ndeposits to petitioners’ account from PPI--i.e., according to the S corporation\n\nrules.\n\n               3.    $9,000 from Abingdon Trading, LLC\n\n         The IRS determined that $9,000 deposited from Abingdon was includable in\n\npetitioners’ gross income. Mr. Rogers testified at trial that the $9,000 deposit\n\nreceived from Abingdon was a partnership distribution to a partner and was not\n\nincludable in his gross income. Section 731 provides that no gain or loss shall be\n\nrecognized on a distribution from a partnership to a partner, unless the amount\n\ndistributed exceeds the adjusted basis of the partner’s interest in the partnership\n\nimmediately before the distribution. Mr. Rogers must therefore establish his basis\n\nin Abingdon. At trial, Mr. Rogers attempted to offer the 2004 Schedule K-1,\n\f                                        - 24 -\n\n[*24] “Partner’s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.”, issued to him by\n\nAbingdon. Even though the Schedule K-1 was inadmissible to prove the fact for\n\nwhich it was offered at trial,9 we find that it should be admitted simply to\n\ncorroborate Mr. Rogers’ contention that he was a member of Abingdon.\n\nAbingdon elected partnership status for the 2004 tax year. The $9,000 deposit will\n\ntherefore be governed according to the applicable partnership rules as a\n\ndistribution from a partnership.\n\n      B.     Amounts includable in petitioners’ gross income\n\n      As to the remaining deposits, Mr. Rogers identified at trial the source of\n\neach of the deposits and contended that no part of the deposits should be\n\nincludable in gross income. We find each argument unpersuasive for the reasons\n\ndiscussed below.\n\n             1.    $50,000 from Sugarloaf\n\n      A $50,000 deposit into petitioners’ account was a check from Sugarloaf.\n\nMr. Rogers asserted that this deposit was repayment of a loan that he had\n\n      9\n       Mr. Rogers offered the Schedule K-1 to substantiate a deduction that had\nbeen reported on the Schedule K-1 but not claimed on petitioners’ Form 1040 for\n2004. Upon objection by the IRS, the Court declined to admit the return into\nevidence because it was not probative of any issue raised in the notice of\ndeficiency, addressed matters not pleaded in the pleadings, and was not exchanged\ntwo weeks before trial (as required by the standing pre-trial order issued\nSeptember 21, 2011).\n\f                                       - 25 -\n\n[*25] previously made to Sugarloaf. However, the record contains no evidence of\n\nloan arrangements between Sugarloaf and Mr. Rogers. Accordingly, we sustain\n\nthe IRS’s determination regarding this amount as includable in gross income\n\npursuant to section 61.\n\n             2.    $10,000 from Peninsula Yorkshire Fund\n\n      The IRS identified as income $10,000 deposited into petitioners’ bank\n\naccount from Peninsula Yorkshire Fund. Mr. Rogers admits that he served as\n\ntrustee for Peninsula Yorkshire Fund during 2004, and that the $10,000 deposited\n\ninto his bank account constituted trustee’s fees. Therefore, the $10,000 deposit\n\nfrom Peninsula Yorkshire Fund is includable in the petitioners’ gross income\n\npursuant to section 61.10\n\n             3.    $178,000 from PPI\n\n      The parties have stipulated that $178,000 of the $413,000 in deposits from\n\nPPI to petitioners’ account is for payment of commissions, deductible by PPI as an\n\nordinary and necessary business expense and includable in petitioners’ gross\n\nincome pursuant to section 61. Mr. Rogers admits that the $178,000 is taxable but\n\n\n      10\n         Mr. Rogers’ contention as to Peninsula Yorkshire Fund is that the $10,000\nit paid him is part of what he did report on his Schedule C, so that he should not be\nrequired to report it again. Our reconciliation in part III.D below assures that this\namount is not double-counted.\n\f                                        - 26 -\n\n[*26] emphasizes that the $284,600 reported as gross receipts on his Schedule C\n\nincludes the $178,000 of commission payments--a point we vindicate in part III.D\n\nbelow.\n\n      D.     Recomputing petitioners’ taxable income for tax year 2004\n\n      The universe of bank deposits to be accounted for in determining\n\nMr. Rogers’ unreported income is $677,000. This opinion accounts for it as\n\nfollows:\n\n      •      As to $175,000 paid by Charles Schwab, we hold that it does not\n             relate to Mr. Rogers’ Schedule C activity and does not increase\n             petitioners’ taxable income above what they reported.\n\n      •      As to $264,000 (i.e., $235,000 paid by PPI, $20,000 by Jetstream, and\n             $9,000 by Abingdon), its taxability to Mr. Rogers will be determined\n             under Rule 155.\n\n      •      As to $178,000 paid by PPI, the parties stipulate that it is taxable\n             receipts.\n\n      •      As to the remaining $60,000 (i.e., $50,000 paid by Sugarloaf and\n             $10,000 by Peninsula Yorkshire Fund), we hold that it is taxable.\n\nThus, Mr. Rogers’ taxable Schedule C receipts in 2004 totaled $238,000 (i.e.,\n\n$178,000 plus $60,000), and he reported $284,600. However, we have held that\n\npetitioners’ taxable income is subject to being increased, in the Rule 155\n\ncomputations, by some or all of the $264,000 of distributions from PPI, Jetstream,\n\nand Abingdon.\n\f                                       - 27 -\n\n[*27] In so holding, we avoid the double-counting about which Mr. Rogers was\n\nconcerned. Respondent did not contend--and we do not hold--that the amounts\n\nfound taxable here should simply be added to the income that Mr. Rogers\n\nreported.11 Rather, we determine the taxable receipts and then compare them to\n\nwhat petitioners reported, increasing petitioners’ gross income only by the\n\ndifference.\n\nIV.   Schedule C expenses\n\n      Mr. Rogers filed a Schedule C with petitioners’ 2004 tax return, on which\n\nhe claimed deductions related to his business activities. Pursuant to section\n\n162(a), a taxpayer may deduct “all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or\n\nincurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business”. In contrast,\n\nexcept where specifically enumerated in the Code, no deductions are allowed for\n\npersonal, living, or family expenses. Sec. 262(a). Because Mr. Rogers blended\n\nhis personal expenses with his professional work, this case requires distinguishing\n\nand allocating deductions between personal and business expenses. However,\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        The amount Mr. Rogers reported on Schedule C seems to have been\narbitrary, with no visible relation to any of the amounts in the record. Apart from\nthe parties’ stipulation that what he reported on Schedule C included the\ncommissions portion (i.e., $178,000) of the PPI deposits, we do not know (and do\nnot need to determine) how Mr. Rogers computed the $284,600 he reported.\n\f                                         - 28 -\n\n[*28] Mr. Rogers’ allocations and distinctions were often not credible, when they\n\nwere made at all.\n\n      A.     Interest\n\n      Mr. Rogers deducted $25,000 for “Other Interest”. “Personal interest” is\n\ngenerally not deductible. Sec. 163(h)(1). Non-deductible “personal interest” is\n\ndefined as any interest other than six listed categories of interest. See sec.\n\n162(h)(2). Therefore, to deduct an interest expense, taxpayers must establish that\n\nthe interest falls within a listed category. Mr. Rogers claims that the $25,000\n\ndeducted as “Other Interest” was in the first category--i.e., interest “paid or\n\naccrued on indebtedness properly allocable to a trade or business”.\n\nSec. 163(h)(2)(A). Generally, taxpayers may deduct business-related interest\n\npayments after establishing that: (1) the payment made was “interest”, sec. 163(a);\n\n(2) it was paid or incurred within the taxable year at issue, id.; (3) it was paid on\n\n“an existing, unconditional and legally enforceable obligation for the payment of\n\nmoney”;12 (4) the indebtedness belonged to the taxpayer seeking the deduction;13\n\n\n      12\n       First Nat’l Co. v. Commissioner, 289 F.2d 861, 865 (6th Cir. 1961), rev’g\nand remanding 32 T.C. 798 (1959).\n      13\n       Sec. 163(a); Arcade Realty Co. v. Commissioner, 35 T.C. 256, 262 (1960).\nA taxpayer may not deduct interest on another’s indebtedness. Arcade Realty Co.\nv. Commissioner, 35 T.C. at 262; Teitelbaum v. Commissioner, 346 F.2d 266, 270\n                                                                   (continued...)\n\f                                       - 29 -\n\n[*29] and (5) the payments are “properly allocable to a trade or business”,\n\nsec. 163(b)(2(A).\n\n      The parties agree that the payments deducted on Mr. Rogers’ Schedule C\n\nwere actually interest; that they were paid or incurred in the 2004 taxable year;\n\nthat the payments were made on valid, existing indebtedness; and that the interest\n\npayments claimed were on indebtedness that belongs to petitioners. At issue is\n\nwhether the payments were “properly allocable to a trade or business”--i.e.,\n\nwhether Mr. Rogers established the business purpose of the interest payments. We\n\nhold that he did not.\n\n      Mr. Rogers’ testimony and supporting documentation did not establish how\n\nmuch was borrowed as principal or how the borrowed funds were used, nor did he\n\nshow that the money was devoted to Mr. Rogers’ activities as an attorney (or other\n\nbusiness activities). Mr. Rogers provided credit card statements to substantiate\n\nportions of the amount deducted, but these statements clearly included charges\n\nattributable to both personal and business expenses; and he made no effort to\n\ndistinguish the two. We sustain the IRS’s determinations regarding the\n\nnondeductibility of interest expenses claimed on Mr. Rogers’ Schedule C.\n\n\n      13\n        (...continued)\n(7th Cir. 1965).\n\f                                        - 30 -\n\n[*30] B.     Insurance (other than health)\n\n      Generally, premiums paid on insurance policies are deductible if the\n\ninsurance coverage is ordinary and necessary for a taxpayer’s trade or business,\n\n26 C.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a), Income Tax Regs.; but no deduction is allowed for\n\ninsurance with respect to property that is not used in a trade or business, Edgar v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 1979-524.\n\n      On his 2004 Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted $10,401 in premiums paid on\n\n“Insurance (Other than Health)”. The parties agree that these payments were\n\nmade. At issue is their deductibility as business expenses. Mr. Rogers testified at\n\ntrial that the policies were for “automobiles, liability, umbrella policy and damage\n\nto 162 Abingdon Avenue and possibly to the [Manitou] house. I haven’t tried to,\n\nyou know, be more specific.” This testimony was not sufficient to prove the\n\nbusiness character of the insurance purchased. The only documentary evidence\n\npetitioners offered is an expense log created by Mr. Rogers which documents\n\npayment of the premiums. No policy documents were provided, and no further\n\ntestimony was given at trial regarding the business purpose of these insurance\n\npolicies. Moreover, the record shows that the proceeds from at least one policy\n\nprovided supplemental income to petitioners during Mr. Rogers’ transition from\n\none law firm to another. Because the evidence fails to substantiate the business\n\f                                       - 31 -\n\n[*31] purpose of the insurance (and in some cases even proves that the policy\n\nclearly produced taxable income to Mr. Rogers), we sustain the IRS’s\n\ndeterminations as to insurance premium deductions.\n\n      C.    Travel, meals and entertainment\n\n      Taxpayers may deduct “traveling expenses (including amounts expended for\n\nmeals and lodging * * *) while away from home in the pursuit of a trade or\n\nbusiness”. Sec. 162(a)(2); Commissioner v. Flowers, 326 U.S. 465 (1946).\n\nHowever, travel, meals, and entertainment expenses are subject to especially strict\n\nsubstantiation rules. Sec. 274(d) (flush language); Sanford v. Commissioner, 50\n\nT.C. 823, 827 (1968), aff’d per curiam, 412 F.2d 201 (2d Cir. 1969); 26 C.F.R.\n\nsec. 1.274-5T(a), Temporary Income Tax Regs., 50 Fed. Reg. 46014 (Nov. 6,\n\n1985). When section 274(d) applies, a taxpayer must substantiate by adequate\n\nrecords or sufficient evidence corroborating the taxpayer’s own statement: (1) the\n\namount of the expense; (2) the time and place the expense was incurred; (3) the\n\nbusiness purpose of the expense; and (4) the business relationship of the taxpayer\n\nto other persons benefited by the expense or use, if any. Sec. 274(d)(4) (flush\n\nlanguage); see also Shea v. Commissioner, 112 T.C. 183, 187 (1999). The\n\nsubstantiation requirements imposed by section 274(d) preclude use of the “Cohan\n\f                                       - 32 -\n\n[*32] rule”14 to estimate the amounts of deductions subject to that section.\n\nSanford v. Commissioner, 50 T.C. at 827. Section 274(n) further limits deductions\n\nfor most meal and entertainment expenses to “50 percent of the amount of such\n\nexpense or item which would * * * be allowable as a deduction under this\n\nchapter.”\n\n      On his Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted $60,144 for “Travel” expenses on\n\nline 24.a. and $3,620 for “Meals and entertainment” expenses on line 24.d. The\n\nparties agree that $2,024 of the amounts deducted for “Travel” was allowable as\n\nunreimbursed employee expense on petitioners’ Schedule A. After this\n\nconcession, Mr. Rogers asserts “Travel” expense deductions of $58,120 and\n\n“Meals and entertainment” expense deductions of $3,620.\n\n      Credible evidence proves that Mr. Rogers incurred $30,230 of travel\n\nexpenses while conducting business on PPI’s behalf. Travel itineraries prepared\n\nby Seyfarth Shaw provide independent documentation as to the business purpose,\n\ntime, and date of several of Mr. Rogers’ trips away from home. When combined\n\n\n      14\n         Under the Cohan rule, if, in the absence of the proper records, a taxpayer\nprovides sufficient evidence that the taxpayer has incurred a deductible expense,\nbut the taxpayer is unable to adequately substantiate the amount of the deduction\nto which he or she is otherwise entitled, the Court may estimate the amount of the\nexpense and allow the deduction to that extent. Cohan v. Commissioner, 39 F.2d\n540, 543-544 (2d Cir. 1930).\n\f                                         - 33 -\n\n[*33] with testimony regarding his South American dealings on PPI’s behalf, we\n\nfind that the travel itineraries, receipts, and credit card statements in the record\n\nmeet or exceed the section 274(d) substantiation requirements for that $30,230 of\n\ntravel expenses.\n\n      As for the remaining $27,890.29 of “Travel” expenses and $3,620 in “Meals\n\nand entertainment” expenses, we agree with the IRS that petitioners failed to\n\nsubstantiate them. Mr. Rogers produced a travel diary15 containing underlying\n\ndocumentation in the form of various receipts and bills, and this documentation\n\nlargely substantiates the fact of the expenditure of most of the amounts of travel\n\nexpense in dispute.16 However, the diary substantiates only the expenditure of\n\nthese sums, not their business purpose. At best, all we have is general,\n\n\n      15\n        The travel and expense diary was created by Mr. Rogers during the IRS’s\nexamination of his 2004 tax return to assist in the fact-gathering process. It was\ncomposed of two elements: (a) a statement of the destination and who Mr. Rogers\nmet with; and (b) limited photocopies of some supporting documentation such as\nreceipts or airline tickets. The non-contemporaneous portions of the diary were\nadmitted into evidence at trial not as a contemporaneous business record or\ndocumentation, but only as demonstrative exhibits reflecting petitioners’\ncontentions. These non-contemporaneous portions created during the audit are\ntherefore not corroborating evidence that satisfies section 274(d). When\nsupporting documentation proved the business purpose of an expense, it was\nadmitted as evidence and considered by the Court.\n      16\n       The IRS also disputes the expenditure of $6,362 claimed as travel expense\ndeductions. Because petitioners failed to substantiate the business purpose of all\nremaining travel, meals, and expense deductions, we do not address this issue.\n\f                                         - 34 -\n\n[*34] uncorroborated testimony by Mr. Rogers at trial as to the purpose of some\n\nunknown quantum of these trips. Regarding travel, meals, and entertainment\n\nexpenses reported by petitioners, it is often unclear from the direct testimony\n\nwhere petitioners traveled to, let alone the business purpose behind the trip. The\n\ntravel diary also lists expenses of individuals other than petitioners, but it offers no\n\nsupporting documentation for why these expenses should be deductible by\n\npetitioners. Other trips (such as one to New Zealand) have documentation in the\n\nform of plane tickets, but lack proof of the trip’s business purpose. We therefore\n\nhold that these amounts are unsubstantiated, and we sustain the IRS’s\n\ndisallowance of the remaining $27,890 in travel expenses and $3,620 in meals\n\nexpenses.\n\n      D.     Transportation\n\n      Deductions related to passenger vehicles are subject to strict substantiation\n\nrequirements under section 274(d) and section 280F(d)(4). Taxpayers must prove:\n\n(a) the amount of each separate expenditure with respect to the vehicle; (b) the\n\nexact date of the expenditure; and (c) the business purpose with respect to each\n\nexpenditure. 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.274-5T(b)(6).\n\n      Taxpayers may use one of two methods to substantiate transportation\n\nexpenses. One method is to substantiate each element of an automobile-related\n\f                                        - 35 -\n\n[*35] deduction by adequate records--such as diaries or account books--that are\n\nmaintained by the taxpayer “at or near the time” when the expense was incurred.\n\n26 C.F.R. sec. 1.274-5T(c)(1) and (2). Alternatively, the taxpayer may\n\nsubstantiate each element of an expense with “other sufficient evidence”. Id.\n\npara. (c)(3). Using this alternative method, the taxpayer must establish each\n\nelement of the automobile-related deduction with a detailed personal statement\n\ncorroborated by other evidence. Id. para. (c)(3)(i). A taxpayer’s own statement\n\nalone is not sufficient. See Wolfgram v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-69, slip\n\nop. at 24 (“Testimony alone, without corroborative evidence, does not satisfy the\n\nrequirements of section 274(d)”).\n\n      On his Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted $1,421 of vehicle insurance\n\npremiums on line 15, $1,359 spent on vehicle repairs and maintenance on line 21,\n\nand an additional $2,149 in unidentified “car and truck expenses” on line 9. These\n\nexpenditures related to three vehicles: Mrs. Rogers’ Toyota Avalon, Mr. Rogers’\n\nMercedes S500, and petitioners’ son’s Jeep Cherokee. We disallow each because\n\npetitioners either: (a) used the vehicles for personal transportation, not business\n\ntravel, so that section 262(a) disallows the deductions; or (b) failed to adequately\n\nsubstantiate their entitlement to the vehicle-related deductions, so that section\n\n274(d) disallows the deductions. Neither Mr. Rogers’ testimony nor the limited\n\f                                           - 36 -\n\n[*36] business records offered as evidence are reliable or complete enough to\n\nshow the nature or quantum of the use of these vehicles. Additionally, Mr. Rogers\n\nadmitted both at trial and on his return to personal use of each of the vehicles yet\n\nclaimed 100% of the expenses as deductible. We sustain the IRS’s disallowance\n\nof these transportation expenses.\n\n      E.     Home office\n\n      On various lines of his Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted, as business\n\nexpenses, portions of the following amounts related to petitioners’ personal\n\nresidence on Abingdon Avenue:\n\n                                    Item                    Amount\n                 State Farm Insurance (line 15)              $1,001\n                 Atlantic Mutual Insurance (line 15)          2,220\n                 Replace home furnace (line 21)               1,495\n                 Roof repair (line 21)                        3,246\n                 Removal of dead tree (line 21)                 210\n                 Lawn care (line 21)                          1,557\n                 Pest control (line 21)                         137\n                 Homeowner’s assoc. dues (line 21)              150\n                 Utilities (line 25)                          3,000\n                 Alarm (line 27)                                842\n                  Total                                      13,858\n\f                                        - 37 -\n\n[*37] Section 280A(a) provides that “no deduction otherwise allowable under this\n\nchapter shall be allowed with respect to the use of a dwelling unit which is used by\n\nthe taxpayer during the taxable year as a residence”. However, the “home office”\n\nexception (on which Mr. Rogers relies) allows taxpayers to deduct certain\n\nexpenses which would otherwise be prohibited by section 280A(a), but only “to\n\nthe extent such item[s] * * * [are] allocable to a portion of the dwelling unit which\n\nis exclusively used on a regular basis” for business purposes. Sec. 280A(c)(1)\n\n(emphasis added). Therefore, Mr. Rogers must establish that a portion of the\n\nhome was used regularly for business purposes and that the identifiable portion\n\nwas used exclusively for business purposes.\n\n      At trial Mr. Rogers identified three rooms in the house that he claimed were\n\nused for business, but he offered no testimony or evidence as to the total number\n\nof rooms in the house. Mr. Rogers made no showing of the percentage of the\n\nhome that this area constituted, aside from his unsubstantiated and implausible\n\ntestimony that 50% of his home was used exclusively for business purposes.\n\nBecause credible evidence in the record does not identify a portion of the home\n\nthat was used exclusively for business purpose, these deductions Mr. Rogers\n\nclaimed “with respect to the use of” his home are disallowed by section 280A(a).\n\f                                       - 38 -\n\n[*38] F.     Unreimbursed employee expenses\n\n      Because an employee’s trade or business is deemed to consist of the\n\nperformance of services for an employer, taxpayers may deduct expenses that are:\n\n(a) nonreimbursable, (b) related to the employee’s trade or business of rendering\n\nservices to the employer,17 and (c) ordinary and necessary18 expenses of such a\n\ntrade or business. See Lucas v. Commissioner, 79 T.C. 1, 6-7 (1982).\n\nUnreimbursed employee expenses are subject to the 2% itemized deduction\n\nlimitation of section 67(a).\n\n      As a tax attorney and partner, Mr. Rogers was an “employee” of the law\n\nfirm of Seyfarth Shaw during 2004. While an employee of Seyfarth Shaw,\n\nMr. Rogers incurred and substantiated the following association fees, dues, and\n\nsubscriptions, reported on line 27 of his Schedule C as “Computer Services”,\n\n“Continuing Legal Education”, and “Dues and Subscriptions”:\n\n\n\n\n      17\n       An expense is related to an employee’s trade or business when the\nemployee directly benefits from the expenditure by potentially earning additional\nincome or enhancing job performance in a way traceable to the expenditure.\n      18\n        Expenses are “ordinary” when they are “normal, usual, or customary” in\nthe taxpayer’s trade or business. Deputy v. DuPont, 308 U.S. 488, 495 (1940).\nExpenses are “necessary” when they are “appropriate” or “helpful”, even if not\n“indispensable” or “required”. Ford v. Commissioner, 56 T.C. 1300, 1356 (1971),\naff’d per curiam, 487 F.2d 1025 (9th Cir. 1973).\n\f                                        - 39 -\n\n                              [*39] Item                 Amount\n                   Tax Analysts                           $3,197\n                   RIA Journal of Tax                        394\n                   Continuing education                    1,394\n                   Dues (ABA, Int’l Fiscal Ass’n,\n                    Am. Health Lawyer)                     1,321\n                    Total                                  6,306\n\n      Seyfarth Shaw’s reimbursement policy did not provide for reimbursement of\n\nthe association fees, dues, and subscriptions that Mr. Rogers deducted on his\n\nSchedule C. We hold that the fees, dues, and subscriptions deducted by\n\nMr. Rogers, though not absolutely required for his employment at Seyfarth Shaw,\n\nwere “ordinary and necessary” to his activities as an attorney because they were\n\nappropriate and helpful in his work for the firm. Therefore, Mr. Rogers may\n\ndeduct--subject to the 2% floor--the association fees, dues, and subscriptions listed\n\nabove as unreimbursed employee expenses on his Schedule A.19\n\n      G.     Business gifts\n\n      Mr. Rogers deducted $200 on his Schedule C for various business gifts.\n\nSection 274(b)(1) limits the deduction of the cost of any business gift to $25 per\n\n\n      19\n        In addition to these items, the parties stipulated that Mr. Rogers may\ndeduct $2,024 in travel expenses, $10 for legal library expenses, and $1,420 in\ndues as unreimbursed employee expenses on his Form 1040, Schedule A.\n\f                                        - 40 -\n\n[*40] recipient per year. A taxpayer claiming a business gift deduction must\n\nsubstantiate the cost and description of the gift, the date the gift was made, the\n\nbusiness reason for the gift, and the business relationship of the recipient to the\n\ntaxpayer. 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.274-5T(b)(5).\n\n      The parties agree that petitioners adequately substantiated four separate\n\ngifts of at least $25 each. Therefore, they may deduct $100 in business gifts. We\n\nsustain the IRS’s determination regarding the remaining amounts claimed as\n\nbusiness gift deductions because Mr. Rogers did not adequately substantiate their\n\ndeductibility.\n\n      H.     2004 “Other expenses”\n\n      On his Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted $26,219 for “Other expenses”,\n\nlisted on appendix A. Of this amount, Mr. Rogers adequately substantiated both\n\nthe expenditure and the business purpose of $14 in copying fees and $157 in\n\nsubscription fees to Realtor ECommerce. We sustain the IRS’s determination\n\nregarding the remaining disputed “Other expenses” because petitioners failed to\n\nadequately substantiate the business purpose of each expenditure, as required by\n\nsections 162(a) and 262(a). Rather, the corroborating evidence provided at trial\n\noften shows a clear mixture of personal and business expenses claimed as business\n\f                                        - 41 -\n\n[*41] deductions; and petitioners made no efforts to distinguish business from\n\npersonal expenses.\n\nV.    PPI\n\n      A.    Gross Receipts\n\n            1.       Bank deposits\n\n      In addition to the bank deposits analysis of petitioners’ personal bank\n\naccount (see part III above), the IRS also performed a bank deposits analysis to\n\ndetermine the gross receipts of PPI for 2004. Generally, unless otherwise\n\nprovided, gross income under section 61 includes all accessions to wealth from\n\nwhatever source derived. Commissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426,\n\n432 & n.11 (1955). Moreover,\n\n      gain * * * constitutes taxable income when its recipient has such\n      control over it that, as a practical matter, he derives readily realizable\n      economic value from it. That occurs when cash * * * is delivered by\n      its owner to the taxpayer in a manner which allows the recipient\n      freedom to dispose of it at will * * *. [Rutkin v. United States, 343\n      U.S. 130, 137 (1952); citations omitted.]\n\nThe economic benefit accruing to the taxpayer is the controlling factor in\n\ndetermining whether a gain is income. Id.\n\n      The IRS’s bank deposits analysis of the joint PPI/L&R bank account\n\nestablished gross deposits of $1,566,960. From the gross deposits, the IRS\n\f                                         - 42 -\n\n[*42] subtracted $390,263 in capital contributions made by Mr. Rogers and\n\n$67,911 in non-taxable loan proceeds to arrive at a net deposits figure of\n\n$1,108,786. In addition to the net deposits, PPI’s general ledger showed income\n\nof $34,000 from Agresti, $2,000 from Peabody, and $200,000 from an unknown\n\nsource. Therefore, we have found that the gross receipts of PPI equal\n\n$1,344,786--i.e., the net deposits from the joint bank account plus the undeposited\n\nincome recorded on PPI’s general ledger.\n\n             2.     TEFRA jurisdiction\n\n      As he did for his 2003 year, Mr. Rogers argues that this Court lacks\n\njurisdiction to determine whether certain amounts reported as gross receipts on\n\nPPI’s tax return are income to PPI. Mr. Rogers contends: that portions of the\n\nalleged gross receipts (some of which PPI distributed to Mr. Rogers) are not\n\nincome to PPI but rather are in fact funds of Sugarloaf held in trust by PPI; that\n\nthis contention implicates partnership-level items of Sugarloaf Fund, LLC, a\n\npartnership subject to TEFRA; and that these issues must therefore be adjudicated\n\nat the partnership level of Sugarloaf. It is true that a partnership’s partnership\n\nitems must be adjudicated at the partnership level; but it is not true that the tax\n\nconsequences of every transaction in which a TEFRA partnership or partner\n\nhappens to be a party must be so adjudicated. A taxpayer cannot invalidate a\n\f                                       - 43 -\n\n[*43] notice of deficiency and require the IRS to issue an FPAA simply by\n\npointing out that his income was paid to him by an entity that happens to be a\n\npartner in a TEFRA partnership. If these payments to PPI raise tax partnership-\n\nlevel questions for Sugarloaf or its partners, those are not questions that we must\n\ndecide here. We decide only whether Mr. Rogers, through PPI, received income.\n\nHe did.20\n\n      20\n       In Rogers v. Commissioner, 728 F.3d at 674, on very similar facts,\nMr. Rogers made the same arguments for 2003 about a different partnership,\nWarwick Trading, LLC (which was his 2003 equivalent to Sugarloaf):\n\n              Rogers had created PPI--which plays a critical role in this case\n      --to sit between himself and Jetstream. The tax shelter was sold to\n      U.S. taxpayers for a total of $2.4 million. Half was the purchase price\n      of partnership interests in Warwick. The other half appears to have\n      been a payment to Rogers (via PPI) for creating the shelter. Rogers\n      directed the buyers of the interests (the shelter investors) to wire the\n      entire $2.4 million to PPI’s bank account rather than Warwick’s,\n      telling them that Warwick lacked adequate banking facilities. * * *\n\n            He argues that the $1.2 million retained by PPI (some of which,\n      however, PPI distributed to him) was held in trust for the benefit of\n      Warwick and that therefore the alleged tax deficiency was a\n      “partnership item” and so should have been resolved “at the\n      partnership level,” * * * and so not in this case, which is about\n      personal not partnership income. * * *\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit disposed of the argument succinctly:\n“But the Tax Court ruled in the present case that the money received by PPI and\neither retained by it or distributed to Rogers but not forwarded to Warwick was not\nheld in trust for Warwick--it was PPI’s money--and so the tax status of that money\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\f                                           - 44 -\n\n[*44]         3.       Funds not held in trust\n\n        As he asserted for 2003 in Rogers I, Mr. Rogers asserts here that certain\n\nunspecified funds retained by PPI and reported as gross receipts of PPI for 2004\n\nshould nonetheless be excluded from the gross receipts of PPI because the funds\n\nwere held in trust for Sugarloaf. And as we did in Rogers I for 2003, we find here\n\nthat Mr. Rogers did receive income, because the money received by PPI in 2004--\n\nand subsequently either retained by it or distributed to Mr. Rogers--was not held in\n\ntrust for Sugarloaf.\n\n        Here, as he did for 2003, Mr. Rogers provides no documentation evidencing\n\na trust between PPI and any third party, and we find no credible evidence in the\n\nrecord of such an agreement. Mr. Rogers again responds that no specific words of\n\ntrust are required. However, as was the case for 2003, this leaves him only the\n\noption of a constructive trust:\n\n               [A constructive trust] indeed usually lacks documentation --\n        because it’s not a real trust. Restatement (Third) of Restitution &\n        Unjust Enrichment § 55, comment b (2011). It is a remedy for unjust\n        enrichment: “When property has been acquired in such circumstances\n        that the holder of the legal title may not in good conscience retain the\n        beneficial interest equity converts him into a trustee.” Beatty v.\n        Guggenheim Exploration Co., 122 N.E. 378, 386 (N.Y. 1919)\n        (Cardozo, J); see also 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Dobbs Law of Remedies\n\n        20\n       (...continued)\nwas not an issue for resolution in a partnership-level case.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\f                                       - 45 -\n\n      [*45] § 4.3(2), pp. 589-90 (2d ed. 1993). But Rogers is not arguing\n      that PPI, which he controls, converted or otherwise wrongfully\n      deprived [Sugarloaf] of any money or other property; and if it had,\n      that could hardly generate a tax benefit for Rogers, for he would be\n      the wrongdoer.\n\n             Nevertheless, there is something to Rogers’ trust argument,\n      though not enough. An agent receiving funds on behalf of his\n      principal has a fiduciary duty to maintain the principal’s funds in a\n      segregated account. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 8.12 and\n      comment c (2006); c.f. Rodriguez v. Herman, 121 F.3d 1352, 1356\n      (9th Cir. 1997). PPI appears to have done that with regard to the\n      * * * [investor receipts] that the shelter investors were paying for the\n      partnership interests. For it forwarded that amount to * * *\n      [Sugarloaf] for distribution * * * [as commissions to other companies\n      which incurred costs in helping administer the tax shelter]. [Rogers\n      v. Commissioner, 728 F.3d at 675.]\n\nMr. Rogers’ own tax reporting for 2004 was at odds with his contention that a\n\ncertain portion (in fact, an unspecified amount) of the funds was held “in trust” by\n\nPPI. Mr. Rogers himself paid tax on a portion of this money (the $178,000\n\ncompensation for his services to PPI on his Schedule C), a characterization that is\n\ninconsistent with his having held the money in trust.21 Finally, even if we were to\n\n      21\n       As the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit observed in affirming\nRogers I:\n\n            Worse, if Rogers was holding in trust the money he received\n      from PPI and then using it to reimburse himself for legal services, he\n      was committing a grave breach of trust. He thus is driven to argue\n      both that the money was in trust and so not taxable to him and that it\n      was his personal property and so he committed no ethical or legal\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\f                                       - 46 -\n\n[*46] accept in principle Mr. Rogers’ argument that certain amounts deposited\n\nwith PPI were held in trust, Mr. Rogers provided no evidence substantiating which\n\namounts were held in trust (and were later sent to Sugarloaf Fund or used to pay\n\nSugarloaf Fund’s expenses). Therefore, his evidence does not support a finding\n\nthat any particular amounts paid to PPI are not income to PPI.\n\n             4.    Conclusion\n\n      In conclusion, PPI reported $846,066 in gross receipts on its 2004 Form\n\n1120S and received an additional $425,000 from Sugarloaf in 2004, and\n\npetitioners did not include this amount in the gross receipts of PPI on its 2004\n\nreturn. Its total taxable receipts were therefore $1,271,066.\n\n      B.     Deductions\n\n      After stipulations and concessions by the parties, the parties dispute the\n\nvalidity of more than $800,000 in business expense deductions claimed for PPI on\n\npetitioners’ 2004 Schedule E, “Supplemental Income and Loss”. We hold that,\n\nwith limited exceptions, petitioners have not substantiated either the expenditure\n\n\n\n\n      21\n        (...continued)\n      violations in using it to defray personal expenses. That is a tightrope\n      that no one can walk. * * * [Rogers v. Commissioner, 728 F.3d at\n      675; citations omitted.]\n\f                                        - 47 -\n\n[*47] or the business purpose (or both) of these expenses and that--subject to those\n\nlimited exceptions discussed below--we will sustain the IRS’s disallowance.\n\n             1.    Insurance\n\n      PPI deducted $9,778 for payment of insurance premiums on line 19 of its\n\nForm 1120S. A taxpayer may deduct insurance premiums if the insurance\n\ncoverage is ordinary and necessary for the taxpayer’s trade or business. 26 C.F.R.\n\nsec. 1.162-1(a). However, as we noted above, no deduction is allowed for\n\ninsurance with respect to property that is not used in a trade or business. Edgar v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 1979-524. Despite the parties’ stipulation that PPI\n\nactually spent $6,606 on insurance premiums, Mr. Rogers failed to substantiate the\n\nbusiness purpose of the insurance coverage. He offered no policy documents for\n\nthese premiums, nor did he testify at trial as to the business purpose of the\n\nexpense. Because Mr. Rogers failed to prove that the insurance was with respect\n\nto property used in his trade or business, we will sustain the disallowance of this\n\ndeduction.\n\n             2.    Repairs and maintenance\n\n      PPI deducted $3,670 for “Repairs” and $4,886 for “Maintenance” on its\n\n2004 Form 1120S. These expenses included deductions for lawn care at various\n\nproperties personally owned by petitioners and expenses to repair a vehicle which\n\f                                       - 48 -\n\n[*48] was used by their son both personally and for business. However, expenses\n\nthat relate to a taxpayer’s home must meet the strict substantiation requirements\n\nimposed by section 280A. Sec. 280A(a); see part IV.E above. Expenses related to\n\nvehicles must meet the equally stringent substantiation requirements of section\n\n280F. See part IV.D above. Because petitioners did not substantiate the business\n\npurpose of these expenses, we sustain the IRS’s determination related to this\n\ndeduction.\n\n             3.    Supplies\n\n      PPI deducted $21,220 for “Supplies”. PPI spent at least part of this amount\n\non furnishings and other expenses for petitioners’ son’s residence, gasoline for a\n\nmixed personal- and business-use vehicle driven by petitioners’ son, and other\n\npersonal items purchased for petitioners. Though credit card statements\n\nsubstantiate that the amounts were paid by petitioners or PPI, the charges on the\n\nstatements were to general retailers. Petitioners offered no itemized receipts, and\n\nno effort was made to distinguish which of these charges were personal and which\n\nwere for business purposes. Without substantiation of the business purpose\n\nbehind these expenses, we sustain the disallowance of this deduction.\n\f                                        - 49 -\n\n[*49]         4.    Telephone\n\n        Section 262(a) denies deductions for “personal, living or family expenses”,\n\nand pursuant to section 262(b), any charge for the first telephone line to a\n\nresidence of the taxpayer is treated as a personal expense. PPI deducted $14,881\n\nfor telephone expenses. To substantiate the deduction, petitioners offered an\n\nexpense log, credit card statements, assorted billing statements, and canceled\n\nchecks. However, neither the expense log nor Mr. Rogers’ testimony at trial\n\ndistinguished which portion of the telephone expense was for the first line to\n\npetitioners’ residence, nor which business entity used which telephone line.\n\nMoreover, the evidence in the record shows that a substantial majority of the\n\ncharges were billed to, or related to telephone services which were provided at,\n\npetitioners’ residence on Abingdon Road. Again, no credible evidence\n\ndistinguishes what portions of the expenses were for personal or business\n\npurposes. We therefore sustain the disallowance of this deduction.\n\n              5.    Automobile\n\n        PPI deducted $3,103 on its Form 1120S for “Automobile” expenses. At\n\ntrial, Mr. Rogers testified that this amount was spent on gasoline used by\n\npetitioners’ son and sometimes in one of petitioners’ personal automobiles.\n\nHowever, petitioners did not substantiate the business purpose of these expenses,\n\f                                        - 50 -\n\n[*50] and again cannot meet the heightened substantiation requirements of\n\nsections 274(d) and 280F. See part IV.D above. We therefore sustain the\n\ndisallowance of this deduction.\n\n             6.    Rent\n\n      PPI deducted $23,739 in “Rents”. Of this amount, the IRS conceded that\n\n$15,383 was deductible as rent paid to Palos Bank for office space rented by PPI\n\nin Homer Glen. The deductibility of the remaining $8,356 is in dispute, though\n\nthe IRS concedes that amount was spent by petitioners. At trial, petitioners\n\ntestified that the disputed amount consists of expenditures to rent vehicles, and a\n\nhotel in Florida. Petitioners did not substantiate the business purpose of the\n\nremaining expenses and also failed to meet the stringent substantiation\n\nrequirements imposed by section 274(d) for travel expenses and transportation\n\nexpenses. See part IV above. We therefore sustain the disallowance of the\n\nremaining amounts claimed as “Rents” deductions.\n\n             7.    Commissions\n\n      PPI deducted $365,608 for “Commissions” in 2004. Commissions paid in\n\nconnection with carrying on a trade or business are deductible under section 162 if\n\nthey are ordinary and necessary expenses. 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a). PPI carried\n\non a trade or business, and the parties agree that PPI actually paid $363,607 in\n\f                                        - 51 -\n\n[*51] commissions in 2004. At issue is whether the commissions were ordinary\n\nand necessary expenses--i.e., whether petitioners proved the business purpose of\n\nthese expenses.\n\n       Of the $363,607 paid, the parties stipulate that commissions totaling\n\n$271,052 are deductible as follows: $178,000 paid to Mr. Rogers is deductible by\n\nPPI; and $93,052 is deductible by L&R, not PPI. The deductibility of the\n\nremaining $92,555 is in dispute.\n\n      At trial, Mr. Rogers provided an executed consulting agreement between\n\nPPI and Portfolio Asset Recovery Consultoria e Assessoria Empresarial LTDA for\n\nservices related to PPI’s conduct of Brazilian receivables activities, as well as\n\nevidence of payment of $50,000 as provided by the terms of the agreement.\n\nFurther evidence in the record, combined with Mr. Rogers’ plausible testimony at\n\ntrial, substantiates deductions for the remaining $42,465, i.e., $25,000 paid to\n\nMulticred Investamentados Limitada (“Multicred”), a Brazilian collection\n\ncompany, and $17,465 in various other commissions related to proper PPI\n\nbusiness purposes.\n\f                                        - 52 -\n\n[*52]         8.    Parking\n\n        PPI deducted $1,306 in parking expenses on its Form 1120S. Deductions\n\nclaimed for parking are subject to the strict substantiation requirements imposed\n\nby section 274(d). Sec. 274(d)(1); 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.274-5T(a)(1). Though\n\npetitioners adequately substantiated the expenditure of this amount, they failed to\n\nsubstantiate how the parking expenses related to PPI’s business. We therefore\n\nsustain the disallowance of this deduction.\n\n              9.    Meals and entertainment\n\n        Expenses for meals and entertainment are deductible if the taxpayer\n\nprovides the substantiation required by section 274(d). See part IV.C above.\n\nSection 274(n) limits deductions for most meal and entertainment expenses to “50\n\npercent of the amount of such expense or item which would * * * be allowable as\n\na deduction under this chapter.”\n\n        PPI deducted $12,054 in expenses for meals and entertainment. Petitioners\n\nadequately substantiated $402 in meals expenses (before the 50% limit of section\n\n274(n) is applied) which correspond to the dates that Mr. Rogers traveled on PPI\n\nbusiness. The remaining meals and entertainment expenses lack sufficient\n\ndocumentation to prove their business purpose. Therefore, we sustain the\n\f                                       - 53 -\n\n[*53] disallowance of the claimed deductions for meals and entertainment, except\n\nfor $402 (subject to the 50% limit).\n\n             10.   Travel\n\n      Travel deductions are subject to the stringent reporting requirements of\n\nsection 274(d). See part IV.D above. PPI claimed $19,554 in travel deductions.\n\nThe parties agree that $1,067 of the amount claimed is properly deductible.\n\nFurther, petitioners concede that $5,093.95 is not deductible. The deductibility of\n\n$13,393.05 remains in dispute, though the IRS agrees that the expenditures were\n\nmade. However, petitioners again fail to meet the stringent substantiation\n\nrequirements of section 274(d) for travel deductions, specifically with respect to\n\nthe business purpose of the expenses. See part IV.D above. There is no\n\ndocumentation as to the business purpose of the remaining amounts outside of\n\nMr. Rogers’ unsupported testimony at trial or the demonstrative portions of the\n\ntravel diary. We sustain the IRS’s determination regarding the remaining\n\n$13,393.05 in travel expenses.\n\n             11.   Legal Fees\n\n      PPI deducted $316,628 of “Legal & Professional” fees. The parties agree\n\nthat PPI spent only $191,628, and the IRS conceded that $3,491 of the $191,628\n\nspent is deductible by PPI. The parties dispute the deductibility of the remaining\n\f                                       - 54 -\n\n[*54] $188,137. Ordinary and necessary expenses for legal fees paid or incurred\n\nduring the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business are allowed as\n\ndeductions. Sec. 162; 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a). However, “[b]usiness expenses\n\ndeductible from gross income include the ordinary and necessary expenditures\n\ndirectly connected with or pertaining to the taxpayer’s trade or business.” 26\n\nC.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a) (emphasis added).\n\n      To substantiate this deduction, Mr. Rogers first provides invoices from the\n\nlaw firm Seyfarth Shaw to Sugarloaf c/o Multicred, and evidence in the record\n\nsuggests that PPI did in fact pay these amounts. However, Mr. Rogers fails to\n\ndemonstrate why PPI is the proper entity to deduct these legal expenses.\n\nSugarloaf is an LLC that elected to be classified as a partnership for Federal\n\nincome tax purposes for the 2004 tax year. Items of income and deduction are\n\ndetermined under applicable partnership statutes at the partnership level. Secs.\n\n701, 703. Because petitioners failed to substantiate how these legal expenses were\n\nincurred on behalf of PPI, PPI is not entitled to deduct these amounts.\n\n      Petitioners presented further evidence that PPI paid legal fees and expenses\n\nto Seyfarth Shaw, Paul J. Kozacky & Associates, and Chris Saternus. The record\n\ndoes not substantiate what business purpose entitled PPI to deduct these legal\n\nexpenses. The evidence of payment either bears notations that the fees related to\n\f                                        - 55 -\n\n[*55] PTI (Mr. Rogers’ unrelated entity), not PPI, or contains no indication of the\n\nscope or nature of the underlying work. Though the invoices were addressed to\n\nPPI, the descriptions of the work contained in the invoices related to patent\n\ninfringement claims brought by PTI. The record does not contain any indication\n\nthat PPI had an ownership interest in PTI or in the patent litigation related to PTI.\n\nTherefore, we sustain the disallowance of these deductions.22\n\n      Finally, petitioners provided evidence of amounts paid to Seyfarth Shaw,\n\nthe law firm of Altheimer & Grey, and entities named “ATU General Trust BVI”\n\nand “Chicago Title Insurance”, for which the evidence includes no underlying\n\ninvoice or statement of work. Given that other evidence in the record shows that\n\nPPI deducted expenses for work on matters related to PTI that were not ordinary\n\n\n\n\n      22\n         Petitioners’ only claim for deduction of these items is that they are an\nordinary and necessary business expense incurred by PPI, an entity whose income,\nlosses, deductions, and credits flow through to petitioners. Mr. Rogers testified\nthat he did not know whether he had an ownership interest in PTI in 2004. A\nclose examination of the record discloses that Mr. Rogers at one time was a\nshareholder of PTI, but the evidence is inconclusive as to whether he was during\nthe 2004 tax year at issue. Regardless, petitioners provided no evidence that PPI\nhad any interest in PTI; and we disallow the deduction for that reason. Since\npetitioners advance no other theory as to why these expenses should be deductible\nas flow-through deductions or otherwise, we consider no other alternative\narguments.\n\f                                          - 56 -\n\n[*56] and necessary to PPI’s business purpose,23 it is impossible to determine from\n\nthe record whether the work was related to PPI’s business purposes. Nor can we\n\nrule out the likely possibility that this legal work, too, was for PTI. We therefore\n\nsustain the disallowance of these deductions.\n\n               12.    PTI Subsidy\n\n      PPI deducted $104,182 for a “PTI Subsidy”. However, the “PTI Subsidy”\n\nconsisted of two payments made by Mr. Rogers that have no apparent connection\n\nto PPI. He made the payments to GPC (a co-owner of PTI) to fund the continued\n\noperation of PTI--and protect his investment in it--when it was experiencing\n\ndifficulty as a result of infringement by a competitor. While this money may have\n\nbeen used to pay ordinary and necessary expenses of PTI, for Mr. Rogers it was\n\nnot a deductible expense but a capital expenditure. See Koree v. Commissioner,\n\n40 T.C. 961 (1963).\n\n      Mr. Rogers was an officer (i.e., the treasurer) of PTI during 2004, and he\n\nclaims that the purpose of the “PTI Subsidy” was to protect him from potential\n\nliability for PTI’s debts. He asserts that PTI was insolvent and that Illinois law\n\nimposed on him, as an officer, fiduciary liability for PTI’s debts when PTI was\n\n\n      23\n           In fact, one of the checks written to Altheimer & Grey bears the notation\n“PTI”.\n\f                                       - 57 -\n\n[*57] insolvent.24 However, apart from Mr. Rogers’ very general, summary\n\ntestimony (apparently mistranscribed as “solvent” rather than “insolvent”, see Tr.\n\n55), there is no evidence that PTI was insolvent during 2004; and there is no\n\ncontemporaneous evidence from 2004 to corroborate his current explanation of the\n\npurpose of the “PTI Subsidy”. And even if we were to credit his account entirely,\n\nit would not yield any deduction for PPI.\n\nVI.   L&R gross receipts\n\n      Petitioners argue that, despite the fact that they reported $450,000 in gross\n\nreceipts on L&R’s 2004 return, the entity had no gross receipts. In the alternative,\n\npetitioners claim that, to the extent L&R is found to have had gross receipts, PPI\n\nshould be able to deduct an equal amount. However, neither argument is entirely\n\ncorrect.\n\n      The parties agree that PPI is not entitled to a $450,000 deduction for an\n\namount supposedly transferred to L&R because such a transfer was never made.\n\n\n      24\n         See Technic Eng’g, Ltd. v. Basic Envirotech, Inc., 53 F. Supp. 2d 1007,\n1011 (N.D. Ill. 1999) (extending fiduciary duties during insolvency to officers as\nwell as directors); Atwater v. Am. Exch. Nat’l Bank of Chi., 38 N.E. 1017, 1022\n(Ill. 1893) (“When a corporation becomes insolvent, its assets are regarded as a\ntrust fund for the payment of its creditors; and the directors, who are the agents or\ntrustees of the stockholders during the solvency of the corporation, occupy a\nfiduciary relation towards the creditors when the corporation becomes insolvent”).\n\f                                        - 58 -\n\n[*58] Mr. Rogers asserts that the entire $450,000 reported on L&R’s 2004 return\n\nwas due to this transfer and, because the transfer was never made, L&R should\n\nhave a corresponding reduction in gross receipts. We agree with petitioner that\n\nL&R did not have gross receipts of $450,000 from PPI in 2004. However, as\n\nnoted above, the bank deposits analysis shows that the joint PPI/L&R bank\n\naccount accumulated $73,72025 in net deposits beyond those that were attributable\n\nto PPI. Accordingly, we find in respondent’s favor that L&R had $73,720 of\n\ntaxable gross receipts in 2004.\n\nVII. Accuracy-related penalty\n\n      Section 6662 imposes an “accuracy-related penalty” of 20% of the portion\n\nof the underpayment of tax that is attributable to the taxpayer’s negligence or\n\ndisregard of rules or regulations or the portion of the underpayment attributable to\n\nany substantial understatement of income tax. Sec. 6662(a), (b)(1), (b)(2). Under\n\nsection 7491(c), the IRS bears the burden of production and must produce\n\nsufficient evidence that the imposition of the penalty is appropriate in a given\n\ncase. Once the IRS meets this burden, the taxpayer must come forward with\n\n\n      25\n        PPI and L&R had a combined $1,344,786 in taxable receipts in 2004, as\nevidenced by PPI’s general ledger and the bank deposits analysis of the joint\nPPI/L&R account. We have found that the amount of this total that is attributable\nto PPI is $1,271,066, leaving $73,720 of taxable deposits unaccounted for.\n\f                                         - 59 -\n\n[*59] persuasive evidence that the IRS’s determination is incorrect. Rule 142(a);\n\nHigbee v. Commissioner, 116 T.C. 438, 446-447 (2001).\n\n      An understatement of an individual’s income tax is substantial if it exceeds\n\nthe greater of 10% of the tax required to be shown on the return or $5,000.\n\nSec. 6662(d)(1). Even though we have allowed additional deductions not allowed\n\nin the notice of deficiency, petitioners’ understatement of income tax for 2004\n\n(which will be recomputed pursuant to Rule 155) will evidently exceed the greater\n\nof 10% of the tax required to be shown on the return or $5,000. Accordingly, the\n\nCommissioner has met his burden to establish that petitioners’ return reflected a\n\n“substantial understatement”. Petitioners will therefore owe the accuracy-related\n\npenalty on the entire amount of the underpayment for each year unless they can\n\nsuccessfully invoke a defense to the penalty.\n\n      The section 6662(a) penalty is not imposed if a taxpayer can demonstrate\n\n(1) that he had reasonable cause for the underpayment and (2) that he acted in\n\ngood faith. Sec. 6664(c)(1). Whether a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and\n\nin good faith is a facts-and-circumstances decision, with the most important factor\n\nbeing the extent of the taxpayer’s efforts to assess his proper tax liability.\n\n26 C.F.R. sec. 1.6664-4(b)(1), Income Tax Regs. Also important is the taxpayer’s\n\nknowledge and experience. Id.\n\f                                         - 60 -\n\n[*60] Petitioners contend that the “level of detail required of taxpayer [sic] in this\n\nprocess has been very abnormal even for a naked audit.” However, this contention\n\nneither provides reasonable cause for petitioners’ underpayment nor indicates that\n\npetitioners exercised good faith. While the IRS may have conducted a rigorous\n\nexamination of petitioners’ tax returns and records, the level of thoroughness of\n\nthe examining agents during this process does not affect or bear upon the reporting\n\nrequirements imposed by the Code. The requirement that taxpayers lawfully\n\nreport their taxable income arises long before the examination process. See sec.\n\n6001. Petitioners’ record-keeping was in disarray; they failed to report large\n\namounts of income; and they claimed substantial deductions for which they had no\n\nproof at all and others for which their proof was gravely deficient.\n\n      Petitioners are sophisticated business people. Mr. Rogers is a highly\n\neducated attorney with more than 40 years’ experience dealing in a variety of\n\ncomplex tax matters. He was certainly able to distinguish personal from business\n\nexpenses, yet the evidence he used to substantiate their deductions show that he\n\nfailed to take care to make this distinction.\n\n      We find petitioners had neither reasonable cause nor good faith with regard\n\nto the positions they maintained on their return. To the extent we sustain the IRS\n\ndeterminations, we also sustain the corresponding accuracy-related penalty.\n\f                                         - 61 -\n\n[*61]                                Conclusion\n\n        The determinations in the IRS’s notice of deficiency are sustained in part, as\n\nis explained above. So that the liabilities for the year at issue can be computed,\n\n\n\n                                                  Decision will be entered under\n\n                                        Rule 155.\n\f                                         -

Filed July 17, 2014.\n\n\n\n       In 2004 Ps owned and operated several tiered business entities\nthat promoted tax sheltered investments involving the purchase and\nsale of Brazilian receivables, brokered and developed real property,\nand attempted to bring a medical device to market. Ps failed to report\nas income some of the gross receipts of their business entities, and Ps\ncontend that the unreported amounts were held “in trust” for another\nrelated entity. Ps’ business entities claimed deductions associated\nwith their operations that Ps could not substantiate.\n\n      Ps also failed to report on Schedule C all of the income from\nP-H’s attorney activity, claimed some deductions for that activity that\nthey could not substantiate, and failed to deduct certain amounts that\nthey did expend.\n\n      By notice of deficiency issued in 2010, R determined that Ps\ndid not report all of their income and that some of their claimed\n\f                                         -2-\n\n      [*2] deductions were unsubstantiated and must be disallowed.

Rogers, a statutory notice of deficiency\n\npursuant to section 62121 on December 29, 2009, for petitioners’ 2004 tax year.\n\n      1\n      Unless otherwise indicated, all citations of sections refer to the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C.; “Code”) as in effect for 2004, and all citations\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\f                                         -3-\n\n[*3] In the notice the IRS determined that petitioners had a deficiency in tax of\n\n$466,117 and that they are liable for a corresponding failure-to-file addition to tax\n\nof $100,824 and an accuracy-related penalty of $37,908. This case arises from\n\npetitioners’ timely petition pursuant to section 6213 for redetermination of the\n\ndeficiency and the penalties in the notice of deficiency.\n\n      After stipulations by the parties, the issues for decision are: (1) whether\n\npetitioners substantiated their entitlement to business expense deductions beyond\n\nthose that respondent allowed (with a few exceptions, we hold that they did not);\n\n(2) whether petitioners failed to include certain amounts in gross income that\n\nshould have been reported on their return (we hold that they did to the extent\n\ndescribed below); (3) whether certain receipts of Mr. Rogers’ business entity were\n\nheld in trust or were includable in the entity’s gross receipts (we hold they were\n\nincludable in the entity’s gross receipts); and (4) whether petitioners are liable for\n\nthe accuracy-related penalty under section 6662 (we hold that they are).\n\n                               FINDINGS OF FACT\n\n      At the time they filed their petition, Mr. and Mrs. Rogers resided in Illinois.\n\nIn 2004 Mr. Rogers worked as an attorney and Mrs. Rogers worked as a realtor.\n\n\n      1\n       (...continued)\nof Rules refer to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Procedure.\n\f                                         -4-\n\nIn addition, Mr. Rogers operated a number of entities, including A&G Investors\n\nIII, Portfolio Properties, Inc.

Commissioner, docket No. 671-10. The instant\ncase is an offshoot of those transactions, though the consumer receivables\ntransactions themselves are not before us. Rather, at issue here is the income to\nMr. Rogers (either directly or indirectly from his entities) for his promotion of the\ntransactions.\n\f                                         -6-\n\n      transactions. The first, PPI, was incorporated under the laws of\n      Illinois on April 1, 1989, and elected on January 1, 1992, to be treated\n      as an S corporation under section 1361(a)(1). Rogers was its sole\n      shareholder. The second, Jetstream Business Limited (Jetstream), a\n      [*6] British Virgin Islands limited company, was formed by Rogers\n      with PPI as its sole shareholder. Rogers was Jetstream’s only\n      director. In 2003 Jetstream was treated as a disregarded entity for\n      Federal tax purposes. * * * [Rogers I, slip op. at 3-4.]\n\n      Mr. Rogers formed the third entity in 2001--the Delaware limited liability\n\ncompany called Sugarloaf. In 2004 Jetstream was the managing member and tax\n\nmatters partner of Sugarloaf. Thus, in 2004 Mr. Rogers had control over PPI,\n\nJetstream, and Sugarloaf. During 2004 Sugarloaf entered into transactions directly\n\nand through affiliated entities for, in effect, acquiring distressed Brazilian\n\nconsumer accounts receivable and selling interests in them to numerous investors\n\nthrough trading and holding companies. Sugarloaf was a putative partnership\n\nsubject to the unified partnership audit procedures of TEFRA (sections 6221-\n\n6234). Mr. Rogers indirectly owned an interest of no more than 1% in Sugarloaf,\n\nthrough PPI and Jetstream.\n\nAbingdon Trading\n\n      During 2004 Mr. Rogers was also a member of Abingdon, which engaged in\n\nvarious business ventures, the specifics of which are not relevant to this case. In\n\nthat year he received a $9,000 partnership distribution from Abingdon.\n\f                                        -7-\n\n\n\n[*7] Mr. Rogers’ business income\n\n      In 2004 Mr. Rogers received the following payments from the following\n\nsources:4\n\n                               Entity                  Amount\n                   PPI                                $413,000\n                   Sugarloaf                             50,000\n                   Jetstream                             20,000\n                   Peninsula Yorkshire Fund              10,000\n                   Abingdon                               9,000\n                     Total                             502,000\n\nOf that total, Mr. Rogers reported on Schedule C only $284,600, which the parties\n\nagree included $178,000 of the amount he received from PPI. Mr. Rogers did not\n\nreport the remaining $235,000 distribution from PPI as income in 2004.\n\nPetitioners had no obligation to transfer the $235,000 to anyone, to hold the funds\n\nin escrow, or to segregate the funds from their personal funds. However, in 2004\n\nMr. Rogers made capital contributions of $395,900 to PPI (which was, as we\n\n\n\n      4\n       Petitioners did not report all these amounts on their return, but the IRS\ndiscovered them during its examination, when it performed a bank deposits\nanalysis on petitioners’ joint checking account at LaSalle Bank (ending in 8121) to\ndetermine the amount of petitioners’ gross income in 2004.\n\f                                        -8-\n\nstated, his wholly owned S corporation).\n\n[*8] In connection with his business activities, Mr. Rogers used his home and\n\nvehicles and incurred certain expenses, which he deducted on his Schedule C.\n\nAfter stipulations, the deductibility of $127,756 of the claimed expenses remains\n\nin dispute. Those disputed expenses are listed in appendix A to this opinion.\n\n      Under the burden of proof and legal principles discussed in part IV, below,\n\nwe find that Mr. Rogers incurred, in connection with his “Attorney” activity, only\n\na portion of these disputed expenses--i.e., deductible business gift expenses of\n\n$100, copying expenses of $14, dues and subscriptions expenses of $156, and\n\nbusiness travel expenses of $30,230 on behalf of PPI (deductible on Schedule C);\n\nand that he incurred $4,308 of unreimbursed employee business expenses\n\n(deductible on Schedule A, “Itemized Deductions”) in connection with his\n\nemployment at Seyfarth Shaw.\n\n      We find that petitioners have not substantiated either the expenditure or the\n\nbusiness purpose (or both) of the remaining $91,343 of the expenses listed in\n\nappendix A and discussed in part IV below.\n\nLucas & Rogers Capital, Inc.\n\n      L&R was a second S corporation for which Mr. Rogers was the sole\n\nshareholder. Its activity included a real estate brokerage business, holding\n\f                                        -9-\n\nlicenses for real estate brokers, and property management for third parties. The\n\n[*9] record contains no evidence that PPI owned any interest in L&R, nor any\n\nevidence that L&R owned any interest in PPI. But for reasons we cannot tell, PPI\n\nshared a bank account with L&R, which we refer to as the “joint PPI/L&R\n\naccount”.\n\n      For 2004, on its return prepared by Mr. Rogers, L&R reported $450,000 of\n\ngross receipts, and PPI deducted $450,000 as “L&R fees” on its Form 1120S,\n\n“U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation”; but the parties have stipulated\n\nthat no transfer of $450,000 was ever made. We find that L&R did not receive the\n\nincome it reported, and that PPI did not incur the expense it deducted.\n\nPPI’s and L&R’s gross receipts\n\n      Total deposits into the joint PPI/L&R account equaled $1,566,960 in 2004.\n\nOf the total deposits, $389,900 was capital contributions made to PPI by\n\nMr. Rogers; and $67,911 of the total deposits was the proceeds of a loan. Neither\n\nthe capital contributions nor the loan proceeds were taxable income of PPI or\n\nL&R. The remaining $1,108,786 consisted of taxable deposits that were gross\n\nreceipts of either PPI or L&R. In addition, PPI received income that was not\n\ndeposited into the joint PPI/L&R account, but that was recorded on PPI’s general\n\nledger as income: (a) $34,000 from “Agresti” recorded as “Management Income”;\n\f                                       - 10 -\n\n(b) a $2,000 payment by “Peabody”; and (c) $200,000 from an unknown source\n\n[*10] recorded as “income”. Neither Sugarloaf, Jetstream, PPI, nor petitioners\n\nthemselves had any obligation to transfer any of these receipts to anyone, to hold\n\nthe funds in escrow, or to segregate the funds from any other use. PPI’s and\n\nL&R’s taxable receipts from the above sources therefore totaled $1,344,786--\n\n$1,271,070 attributable to PPI and $73,716 to L&R.5\n\nPPI’s business expenses\n\n      In 2004 PPI rented office space in Homer Glen, Illinois, from Palos Bank.\n\nFor that office and other reported expenses, PPI claimed deductions on its 2004\n\ntax return. After stipulations, the deductibility of $608,310 of those expenses\n\nremains in dispute. Those disputed expenses are listed in appendix B to this\n\n\n      5\n        PPI did not report all of those receipts. Rather, on its 2004 Form 1120S\nPPI reported only $846,070 (later adjusted by agreement of the parties to\n$846,066) of gross receipts or sales consisting of: $149,966 from real estate\ncommissions; $34,000 from Thomas Agresti; $124,500 from GTG Corp.;\n$220,000 from Multicred Investamentados Limitada (“Multicred”); $137,500 from\nRaul Marquez; $90,000 from Thomas McKelvey; and $90,100 from two\nunidentified sources. The parties also stipulated that PPI received $425,000 from\nSugarloaf during 2004, none of which was reported on PPI’s return. If that\namount is added to the gross receipts that PPI did report, the resulting total is\n$1,271,070, which we find is the portion of the gross receipts attributable to PPI.\nWe attribute the remaining $73,716 to L&R, since the record seems to show some\nactivity by L&R in 2004, and it is the sole apparent possible recipient of those\nreceipts. Whether received by PPI or L&R, the income ultimately flows through\nto petitioners.\n\f                                       - 11 -\n\nopinion.\n\n[*11] Under the burden of proof and legal principles discussed in part I below,\n\nwe find that PPI incurred the following deductible expenses:\n\n                          Expense                              Amount\n             Commissions:\n                Portfolio Asset Recovery\n                Consultoria e Assessoria\n                Empresarial LTDA                               $50,000\n                Multicred Investamentados\n                Limitada                                        25,000\n                Other commissions                               17,465\n             Meals and entertainment                              402\n               Total                                            92,867\n\n      We find that petitioners have not substantiated either the expenditure or the\n\nbusiness purpose (or both) of the remaining $515,443 of the expenses listed in\n\nappendix B and discussed in part V.B below.\n\n      One of the larger disputed deductions that we find unsubstantiated was “PTI\n\nSubsidy”. Portfolio Technologies, Inc. (“PTI”), was an Illinois corporation\n\norganized in 1997 by Mr. Rogers. He remained a shareholder and officer of the\n\ncompany throughout 2004. PTI was involved in bringing a new medical device to\n\nmarket, which ultimately resulted in PTI’s involvement in patent litigation.\n\f                                        - 12 -\n\nMr. Rogers testified he was “the largest shareholder eventually” of PTI, though the\n\n[*12] precise extent of his ownership interest in PTI was not established at trial.\n\n(L&R also owned an unspecified number of shares in PTI during 2004. The\n\nrecord contains no evidence that PPI, Jetstream, or Sugarloaf owned any interest in\n\nPTI.) The evidence at trial did not establish whether PTI was solvent or insolvent,\n\nbut it is clear that PTI was under threat from an infringer. Mr. Rogers owned a\n\nresidual or royalty right to PTI’s profits after large bank loans had been paid off,\n\nand the value of that right depended on PTI’s survival. The alleged “PTI Subsidy”\n\nexpense consisted of two payments by Mr. Rogers to Global Protection Corp.\n\n(“GPC”). GPC held shares of PTI from 1998 until 2010, and it provided\n\nmanagement services to PTI during that time. The purpose of these payments is\n\nundocumented, but we assume the correctness of Mr. Rogers’ explanation that, in\n\n2004,\n\n        the other major shareholder in the business and the manager of Global\n        Protection Corp had exhausted its lines of credit and borrowing\n        ability and cash flow in getting the product manufactured and\n        distributed. And this was some payments I made so that the boxes in\n        which the product would be put on the shelf as well as the materials\n        to finish the inventory. The product had been sold and this was a\n        bridge to get the product to market les[t] Global Protection go under\n        as well as Portfolio Technologies.\n\n              THE COURT: So, when you talk about payments being made,\n        you’re talking about the $104,182?\n\f                                       - 13 -\n\n              MR. ROGERS: Yes.\n\n             [*13] THE COURT: All right. So the purpose of that [“PTI\n       Subsidy” payment] was to get the product out into the stores?\n\n              MR. ROGERS: Yes. And one more time, I do not view that as\n       a payment to Portfolio Technologies. I view that as a payment to\n       protect my interest on the royalties and positioning the product so we\n       can demonstrate damages for both predatory pricing as well as patent\n       infringement because they [an infringer] took our premium pricing\n       away * * *.\n\nMr. Rogers’ description shows that these payments were contributions to PTI’s\n\ncapital, made to protect Mr. Rogers’ investment in PTI and his prospect of future\n\nprofit from it.\n\nFMC stock option exercise\n\n       Mr. Rogers received a stock option benefit from his former employer, FMC,\n\nwhich he exercised in 2004. To do so, he opened a special account at the\n\nbrokerage firm Charles Schwab and, on November 24, 2009, deposited $150,000\n\ninto that Schwab account to fund the purchase. At the time of the transaction, the\n\noption price was $165,397.52, but the trading price was $251,168.54--a difference\n\nof $85,770.62, which constituted the employer-granted benefit of the option (and\n\nwas close to the amount--$86,034.42--that FMC later reported on Form W-2,\n\n“Wage and Tax Statement”). Schwab paid FMC the option price ($165,397.52)\n\nplus the employee portion of tax withholding computed to be due on the gain\n\f                                        - 14 -\n\n($30,671.24), totaling $196,068.76. The difference between that amount and\n\n[*14] Mr. Rogers’ $150,000 deposit--i.e., $46,068.76--constituted a loan or\n\n“margin” from Schwab to Mr. Rogers. Schwab then immediately sold the FMC\n\nshares for their market price ($251,168.54), evidently retained a portion of it to\n\nrecover its loan ($46,068.76) plus a few days of interest thereon, and therefore\n\nowed Mr. Rogers approximately $205,000 on this transaction. Schwab remitted to\n\nMr. Rogers only $175,000, which was deposited into Mr. Rogers’ account on\n\nDecember 10, 2004, and thus retained a balance of about $30,000.6\n\n      Mr. Rogers received from FMC a Form W-2 reporting wage income of\n\n$86,034.32, and petitioners reported that amount on their return as wages.\n\nMr. Rogers also received a Form 1099 from Schwab, reporting the entire\n\n$251,168.54 of gross proceeds of the stock sale, and petitioners reported that\n\namount on Schedule D, “Captial Gains and Losses”, of their return, but they\n\nreported zero gain from the transaction--consistent with their having already\n\nreported their gain as wages on line 7 of Form 1040, “U.S. Individual Income Tax\n\nReturn”.\n\n      When the IRS later examined petitioners’ return and analyzed their bank\n\n      6\n       The record does not show whether or when Schwab repaid this $30,000\nbalance to Mr. Rogers, but the fact is immaterial since, if and when it was paid, it\nwas a return of capital to Mr. Rogers.\n\f                                       - 15 -\n\ndeposits, it found the Schwab deposit of $175,000, saw no such income item\n\n[*15] reported on the return, and concluded it was taxable receipts from\n\nMr. Rogers’ Schedule C activity. (It was not.)\n\nNotice of deficiency and Tax Court petition\n\n      The IRS examined petitioners’ 2004 income tax return and, in that process,\n\nperformed the bank deposits analyses described above. The IRS determined that\n\npetitioners had unreported income and claimed improper and excessive\n\ndeductions. Respondent issued a statutory notice of deficiency to petitioners\n\ndetermining a deficiency in tax, as well as additions to tax and penalties under\n\nsections 6651(a)(1) and 6662, and petitioners timely petitioned this Court.\n\n                                     OPINION\n\nI.

Rather, taxpayers\n\n[*16] must carry the burden of proof with evidence offered at trial, which their\n\nbriefs should cite.7 Where the evidence presented at trial is insufficient to support\n\nthat a particular expense is deductible, we must sustain the IRS’s determinations\n\nand disallow the deduction.\n\n      Petitioners contend that, with respect to the $50,000 deposit from Sugarloaf\n\nto petitioners’ individual bank account, the burden of proof shifts to respondent\n\nunder section 7491(b), which provides that the burden shifts as to “any item of\n\nincome which was reconstructed by the Secretary solely through the use of\n\nstatistical information on unrelated taxpayers”. But in fact, respondent used\n\npetitioners’ own bank records to reconstruct their income, and not “statistical\n\ninformation on unrelated taxpayers”. The burden of proof with respect to this\n\n$50,000 deposit does not shift to respondent. They also contend that the burden\n\nshifts on this issue under section 7491(a)(1), which shifts the burden when (among\n\n\n      7\n        See Rule 151(e)(3) (“All briefs * * * shall contain * * * [p]roposed\nfindings of fact * * * based on the evidence * * *. * * * [T]here shall be inserted\nreferences to the pages of the transcript or the exhibits or other sources relied upon\nto support the statement.”); Adeyemo v.

But in fact, as to the factual issue of repayment of a supposed loan\n\nby Mr. Rogers to Sugarloaf, petitioners introduced no loan documents nor any\n\naccounting records to corroborate Mr. Rogers’ testimony. “Credible evidence”\n\nwas thus lacking on this issue, and the burden of proof did not shift.\n\n      B.     Record-keeping\n\n      Section 6001 requires that--\n\n             Every person liable for any tax imposed by this title, or for the\n      collection thereof, shall keep such records, render such statements,\n      make such returns, and comply with such rules and regulations as the\n      Secretary may from time to time prescribe. * * * [Emphasis added.]\n\nTaxpayers are thus required to keep sufficient records to substantiate their gross\n\nincome, deductions, credits, and other tax attributes.

For many of the disputed deductions\n\f                                        - 18 -\n\nin this case, petitioners lack real business records, and they attempt to rely on bank\n\n[*18] records of commingled personal and business activities, reconstructions, and\n\ndisorganized receipts.\n\n      C.     Deductible character\n\n      To prove entitlement to deduct an expense, the taxpayer must prove not only\n\nthe fact of the expenditure but also the business purpose (or other deductible\n\ncharacter) of the expense. “Business expenses deductible from gross income\n\ninclude the ordinary and necessary expenditures directly connected with or\n\npertaining to the taxpayer’s trade or business”. 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a), Income\n\nTax Regs.

At trial\n\f                                       - 19 -\n\nMr. Rogers persuasively demonstrated that the deposit arose from a stock option\n\n[*19] transaction with his former employer, FMC. The $86,000 of gain from that\n\ntransaction was in fact reported by petitioners on their Form 1040 as wages, and\n\nwe have found that the remainder of the proceeds constituted a return of capital.\n\nPetitioners therefore realized no unreported income in conjunction with the\n\n$175,000 deposit.\n\nIII.   Petitioners’ unreported business income\n\n       Respondent contends that petitioners failed to report on their 2004 Form\n\n1040 certain amounts that Mr. Rogers received from his business activities.8\n\nGross income includes all income from whatever source derived.

That reporting appears appropriate, and we therefore treat that\namount (plus the $10,000 from Peninsula Yorkshire Fund and the $50,000 from\nSugarloaf) as Schedule C income.

After accounting for amounts (totaling $450,703) that the parties stipulated\n\nwere reported on line 7 of petitioners’ Form 1040 as wage income, the IRS’s bank\n\ndeposits analysis identified a total of $677,000 of additional deposits into\n\npetitioners’ personal bank account. Of that amount, the $175,000 deposit from the\n\nstock option transaction constituted a non-taxable return of capital. Mr. Rogers\n\nreported only $284,600 on his Schedule C.\n\n      A.     Income amounts to be determined under Rule 155\n\n      Of the $502,000 of deposits to be accounted for, $264,000 was distributions\n\nfrom Mr. Rogers’ business entities, the tax consequences of which will be\n\ndetermined under Rule 155, as explained below.\n\f                                        - 21 -\n\n[*21]         1.    $235,000 from PPI\n\n        The parties agree that Mr. Rogers received deposits totaling $413,000 in\n\n2004 from PPI, an S corporation owned entirely by Mr. Rogers. As we have\n\nnoted, the parties also agree that $178,000 of that total was commissions paid to\n\nMr. Rogers and properly accounted for as “Gross Income” on his Schedule C.\n\nMr. Rogers asserted at trial that the remaining PPI deposits totaling $235,000 were\n\ndistributions to him from PPI over the course of the 2004 tax year, that they were\n\nexceeded by $395,900 of contributions to PPI’s capital that Mr. Rogers made\n\nduring 2004, and that PPI’s distributions to Mr. Rogers should be taxed according\n\nto the applicable S corporation rules. Respondent made no legal or statutory\n\nargument to the contrary, and we hold that the tax rules governing S corporations\n\nwill determine the tax treatment of the $235,000 PPI distributed to Mr. Rogers in\n\n2004, just as equivalent amounts were determined for 2003 in Rogers I:\n\n               On its face, the * * * [$235,000] transfer[red] from PPI to\n        Rogers is a distribution from an S corporation to a shareholder.\n        Generally, section 1368(b) provides that distributions from an S\n        corporation with no accumulated earnings and profits (E&P) of a\n        predecessor C corporation are not included in the gross income of the\n        shareholder to the extent that they do not exceed the adjusted basis of\n        the shareholder’s stock, and any excess over adjusted basis is treated\n        as gain from the sale or exchange of property. If the S corporation\n        has accumulated E&P of a predecessor C corporation, then the\n        portion of the distributions in excess of the S corporation’s\n        accumulated adjustment account (AAA) is treated as a dividend to the\n\f                                       - 22 -\n\n      [*22] extent it does not exceed the accumulated E&P. Sec.\n      1368(c)(1) and (2). The AAA is intended to measure the accumulated\n      taxable income of an S corporation that has not been distributed to the\n      shareholders. See Williams v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 30\n      (1998). The portion of a distribution to a shareholder that does not\n      exceed the AAA is a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the\n      shareholder’s adjusted basis in S corporation stock. Sec. 1368(b) and\n      (c)(1). The AAA is increased for the S corporation’s income and\n      decreased for the S corporation’s losses and deductions and for\n      nontaxable distributions to shareholders. See secs. 1367 and 1368.\n\n            Section 1366(a)(1) provides that a shareholder shall take into\n      account his or her pro rata share of the S corporation’s items of\n      income, loss, deduction, or credit for the S corporation’s taxable year\n      ending with or in the shareholder’s taxable year. Section 1367\n      provides that basis in S corporation stock is increased by income\n      passed through to the shareholder under section 1366(a)(1), and\n      decreased by, inter alia, distributions not includable in the\n      shareholder’s income pursuant to section 1368.\n\n             Unless a statutory or legal principle applies to remove the\n      [$235,000] distribution from the S corporation rules described above,\n      these rules will govern whether the * * * [$235,000] distribution from\n      PPI to Rogers is income to petitioners and, if so, the character of that\n      income. * * * [Rogers I, slip op. at 9-11.]\n\nConsequently, here, as in Rogers I, “[a] Rule 155 computation of PPI’s E&P and\n\nAAA, as well as Rogers’ basis in his PPI stock, is required to make a final\n\ndetermination” of the taxability of the $235,000 distribution from PPI. Id.\n\nat 17-18.\n\f                                        - 23 -\n\n[*23]          2.    $20,000 from Jetstream\n\n         The IRS identified $20,000 deposited into petitioners’ account from\n\nJetstream, a British Virgin Islands company wholly owned by PPI during 2004 and\n\ndisregarded for Federal income tax purposes. Mr. Rogers disputes the IRS’s\n\ncategorization of this amount as gross income. At trial, he claimed that this\n\namount was a “return of principal” from Jetstream for amounts advanced to\n\nJetstream through PPI. As Jetstream was disregarded for U.S. Federal income tax\n\npurposes, these amounts will be treated in the same way as the $235,000 in\n\ndeposits to petitioners’ account from PPI--i.e., according to the S corporation\n\nrules.\n\n               3.    $9,000 from Abingdon Trading, LLC\n\n         The IRS determined that $9,000 deposited from Abingdon was includable in\n\npetitioners’ gross income. Mr. Rogers testified at trial that the $9,000 deposit\n\nreceived from Abingdon was a partnership distribution to a partner and was not\n\nincludable in his gross income. Section 731 provides that no gain or loss shall be\n\nrecognized on a distribution from a partnership to a partner, unless the amount\n\ndistributed exceeds the adjusted basis of the partner’s interest in the partnership\n\nimmediately before the distribution. Mr. Rogers must therefore establish his basis\n\nin Abingdon. At trial, Mr. Rogers attempted to offer the 2004 Schedule K-1,\n\f                                        - 24 -\n\n[*24] “Partner’s Share of Income, Deductions, Credits, etc.”, issued to him by\n\nAbingdon. Even though the Schedule K-1 was inadmissible to prove the fact for\n\nwhich it was offered at trial,9 we find that it should be admitted simply to\n\ncorroborate Mr. Rogers’ contention that he was a member of Abingdon.\n\nAbingdon elected partnership status for the 2004 tax year. The $9,000 deposit will\n\ntherefore be governed according to the applicable partnership rules as a\n\ndistribution from a partnership.\n\n      B.     Amounts includable in petitioners’ gross income\n\n      As to the remaining deposits, Mr. Rogers identified at trial the source of\n\neach of the deposits and contended that no part of the deposits should be\n\nincludable in gross income. We find each argument unpersuasive for the reasons\n\ndiscussed below.\n\n             1.    $50,000 from Sugarloaf\n\n      A $50,000 deposit into petitioners’ account was a check from Sugarloaf.\n\nMr. Rogers asserted that this deposit was repayment of a loan that he had\n\n      9\n       Mr. Rogers offered the Schedule K-1 to substantiate a deduction that had\nbeen reported on the Schedule K-1 but not claimed on petitioners’ Form 1040 for\n2004. Upon objection by the IRS, the Court declined to admit the return into\nevidence because it was not probative of any issue raised in the notice of\ndeficiency, addressed matters not pleaded in the pleadings, and was not exchanged\ntwo weeks before trial (as required by the standing pre-trial order issued\nSeptember 21, 2011).\n\f                                       - 25 -\n\n[*25] previously made to Sugarloaf. However, the record contains no evidence of\n\nloan arrangements between Sugarloaf and Mr. Rogers. Accordingly, we sustain\n\nthe IRS’s determination regarding this amount as includable in gross income\n\npursuant to section 61.\n\n             2.    $10,000 from Peninsula Yorkshire Fund\n\n      The IRS identified as income $10,000 deposited into petitioners’ bank\n\naccount from Peninsula Yorkshire Fund. Mr. Rogers admits that he served as\n\ntrustee for Peninsula Yorkshire Fund during 2004, and that the $10,000 deposited\n\ninto his bank account constituted trustee’s fees. Therefore, the $10,000 deposit\n\nfrom Peninsula Yorkshire Fund is includable in the petitioners’ gross income\n\npursuant to section 61.10\n\n             3.    $178,000 from PPI\n\n      The parties have stipulated that $178,000 of the $413,000 in deposits from\n\nPPI to petitioners’ account is for payment of commissions, deductible by PPI as an\n\nordinary and necessary business expense and includable in petitioners’ gross\n\nincome pursuant to section 61. Mr. Rogers admits that the $178,000 is taxable but\n\n\n      10\n         Mr. Rogers’ contention as to Peninsula Yorkshire Fund is that the $10,000\nit paid him is part of what he did report on his Schedule C, so that he should not be\nrequired to report it again. Our reconciliation in part III.D below assures that this\namount is not double-counted.\n\f                                        - 26 -\n\n[*26] emphasizes that the $284,600 reported as gross receipts on his Schedule C\n\nincludes the $178,000 of commission payments--a point we vindicate in part III.D\n\nbelow.\n\n      D.     Recomputing petitioners’ taxable income for tax year 2004\n\n      The universe of bank deposits to be accounted for in determining\n\nMr. Rogers’ unreported income is $677,000. This opinion accounts for it as\n\nfollows:\n\n      •      As to $175,000 paid by Charles Schwab, we hold that it does not\n             relate to Mr. Rogers’ Schedule C activity and does not increase\n             petitioners’ taxable income above what they reported.\n\n      •      As to $264,000 (i.e., $235,000 paid by PPI, $20,000 by Jetstream, and\n             $9,000 by Abingdon), its taxability to Mr. Rogers will be determined\n             under Rule 155.\n\n      •      As to $178,000 paid by PPI, the parties stipulate that it is taxable\n             receipts.\n\n      •      As to the remaining $60,000 (i.e., $50,000 paid by Sugarloaf and\n             $10,000 by Peninsula Yorkshire Fund), we hold that it is taxable.\n\nThus, Mr. Rogers’ taxable Schedule C receipts in 2004 totaled $238,000 (i.e.,\n\n$178,000 plus $60,000), and he reported $284,600. However, we have held that\n\npetitioners’ taxable income is subject to being increased, in the Rule 155\n\ncomputations, by some or all of the $264,000 of distributions from PPI, Jetstream,\n\nand Abingdon.\n\f                                       - 27 -\n\n[*27] In so holding, we avoid the double-counting about which Mr. Rogers was\n\nconcerned. Respondent did not contend--and we do not hold--that the amounts\n\nfound taxable here should simply be added to the income that Mr. Rogers\n\nreported.11 Rather, we determine the taxable receipts and then compare them to\n\nwhat petitioners reported, increasing petitioners’ gross income only by the\n\ndifference.\n\nIV.   Schedule C expenses\n\n      Mr. Rogers filed a Schedule C with petitioners’ 2004 tax return, on which\n\nhe claimed deductions related to his business activities. Pursuant to section\n\n162(a), a taxpayer may deduct “all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or\n\nincurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business”. In contrast,\n\nexcept where specifically enumerated in the Code, no deductions are allowed for\n\npersonal, living, or family expenses. Sec. 262(a). Because Mr. Rogers blended\n\nhis personal expenses with his professional work, this case requires distinguishing\n\nand allocating deductions between personal and business expenses. However,\n\n\n\n\n      11\n        The amount Mr. Rogers reported on Schedule C seems to have been\narbitrary, with no visible relation to any of the amounts in the record. Apart from\nthe parties’ stipulation that what he reported on Schedule C included the\ncommissions portion (i.e., $178,000) of the PPI deposits, we do not know (and do\nnot need to determine) how Mr. Rogers computed the $284,600 he reported.\n\f                                         - 28 -\n\n[*28] Mr. Rogers’ allocations and distinctions were often not credible, when they\n\nwere made at all.\n\n      A.     Interest\n\n      Mr. Rogers deducted $25,000 for “Other Interest”. “Personal interest” is\n\ngenerally not deductible. Sec. 163(h)(1). Non-deductible “personal interest” is\n\ndefined as any interest other than six listed categories of interest. See sec.\n\n162(h)(2). Therefore, to deduct an interest expense, taxpayers must establish that\n\nthe interest falls within a listed category. Mr. Rogers claims that the $25,000\n\ndeducted as “Other Interest” was in the first category--i.e., interest “paid or\n\naccrued on indebtedness properly allocable to a trade or business”.\n\nSec. 163(h)(2)(A). Generally, taxpayers may deduct business-related interest\n\npayments after establishing that: (1) the payment made was “interest”, sec. 163(a);\n\n(2) it was paid or incurred within the taxable year at issue, id.; (3) it was paid on\n\n“an existing, unconditional and legally enforceable obligation for the payment of\n\nmoney”;12 (4) the indebtedness belonged to the taxpayer seeking the deduction;13\n\n\n      12\n       First Nat’l Co. v.

At issue is\n\nwhether the payments were “properly allocable to a trade or business”--i.e.,\n\nwhether Mr. Rogers established the business purpose of the interest payments. We\n\nhold that he did not.\n\n      Mr. Rogers’ testimony and supporting documentation did not establish how\n\nmuch was borrowed as principal or how the borrowed funds were used, nor did he\n\nshow that the money was devoted to Mr. Rogers’ activities as an attorney (or other\n\nbusiness activities). Mr. Rogers provided credit card statements to substantiate\n\nportions of the amount deducted, but these statements clearly included charges\n\nattributable to both personal and business expenses; and he made no effort to\n\ndistinguish the two. We sustain the IRS’s determinations regarding the\n\nnondeductibility of interest expenses claimed on Mr. Rogers’ Schedule C.\n\n\n      13\n        (...continued)\n(7th Cir. 1965).\n\f                                        - 30 -\n\n[*30] B.     Insurance (other than health)\n\n      Generally, premiums paid on insurance policies are deductible if the\n\ninsurance coverage is ordinary and necessary for a taxpayer’s trade or business,\n\n26 C.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a), Income Tax Regs.; but no deduction is allowed for\n\ninsurance with respect to property that is not used in a trade or business, Edgar v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 1979-524.\n\n      On his 2004 Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted $10,401 in premiums paid on\n\n“Insurance (Other than Health)”. The parties agree that these payments were\n\nmade. At issue is their deductibility as business expenses. Mr. Rogers testified at\n\ntrial that the policies were for “automobiles, liability, umbrella policy and damage\n\nto 162 Abingdon Avenue and possibly to the [Manitou] house. I haven’t tried to,\n\nyou know, be more specific.” This testimony was not sufficient to prove the\n\nbusiness character of the insurance purchased. The only documentary evidence\n\npetitioners offered is an expense log created by Mr. Rogers which documents\n\npayment of the premiums. No policy documents were provided, and no further\n\ntestimony was given at trial regarding the business purpose of these insurance\n\npolicies. Moreover, the record shows that the proceeds from at least one policy\n\nprovided supplemental income to petitioners during Mr. Rogers’ transition from\n\none law firm to another.

When section 274(d) applies, a taxpayer must substantiate by adequate\n\nrecords or sufficient evidence corroborating the taxpayer’s own statement: (1) the\n\namount of the expense; (2) the time and place the expense was incurred; (3) the\n\nbusiness purpose of the expense; and (4) the business relationship of the taxpayer\n\nto other persons benefited by the expense or use, if any.

The\n\nsubstantiation requirements imposed by section 274(d) preclude use of the “Cohan\n\f                                       - 32 -\n\n[*32] rule”14 to estimate the amounts of deductions subject to that section.\n\nSanford v. Commissioner, 50 T.C. at 827. Section 274(n) further limits deductions\n\nfor most meal and entertainment expenses to “50 percent of the amount of such\n\nexpense or item which would * * * be allowable as a deduction under this\n\nchapter.”\n\n      On his Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted $60,144 for “Travel” expenses on\n\nline 24.a. and $3,620 for “Meals and entertainment” expenses on line 24.d. The\n\nparties agree that $2,024 of the amounts deducted for “Travel” was allowable as\n\nunreimbursed employee expense on petitioners’ Schedule A. After this\n\nconcession, Mr. Rogers asserts “Travel” expense deductions of $58,120 and\n\n“Meals and entertainment” expense deductions of $3,620.\n\n      Credible evidence proves that Mr. Rogers incurred $30,230 of travel\n\nexpenses while conducting business on PPI’s behalf.

Mr. Rogers produced a travel diary15 containing underlying\n\ndocumentation in the form of various receipts and bills, and this documentation\n\nlargely substantiates the fact of the expenditure of most of the amounts of travel\n\nexpense in dispute.16 However, the diary substantiates only the expenditure of\n\nthese sums, not their business purpose. At best, all we have is general,\n\n\n      15\n        The travel and expense diary was created by Mr. Rogers during the IRS’s\nexamination of his 2004 tax return to assist in the fact-gathering process. It was\ncomposed of two elements: (a) a statement of the destination and who Mr. Rogers\nmet with; and (b) limited photocopies of some supporting documentation such as\nreceipts or airline tickets. The non-contemporaneous portions of the diary were\nadmitted into evidence at trial not as a contemporaneous business record or\ndocumentation, but only as demonstrative exhibits reflecting petitioners’\ncontentions. These non-contemporaneous portions created during the audit are\ntherefore not corroborating evidence that satisfies section 274(d). When\nsupporting documentation proved the business purpose of an expense, it was\nadmitted as evidence and considered by the Court.\n      16\n       The IRS also disputes the expenditure of $6,362 claimed as travel expense\ndeductions. Because petitioners failed to substantiate the business purpose of all\nremaining travel, meals, and expense deductions, we do not address this issue.\n\f                                         - 34 -\n\n[*34] uncorroborated testimony by Mr. Rogers at trial as to the purpose of some\n\nunknown quantum of these trips. Regarding travel, meals, and entertainment\n\nexpenses reported by petitioners, it is often unclear from the direct testimony\n\nwhere petitioners traveled to, let alone the business purpose behind the trip. The\n\ntravel diary also lists expenses of individuals other than petitioners, but it offers no\n\nsupporting documentation for why these expenses should be deductible by\n\npetitioners. Other trips (such as one to New Zealand) have documentation in the\n\nform of plane tickets, but lack proof of the trip’s business purpose. We therefore\n\nhold that these amounts are unsubstantiated, and we sustain the IRS’s\n\ndisallowance of the remaining $27,890 in travel expenses and $3,620 in meals\n\nexpenses.\n\n      D.     Transportation\n\n      Deductions related to passenger vehicles are subject to strict substantiation\n\nrequirements under section 274(d) and section 280F(d)(4). Taxpayers must prove:\n\n(a) the amount of each separate expenditure with respect to the vehicle; (b) the\n\nexact date of the expenditure; and (c) the business purpose with respect to each\n\nexpenditure. 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.274-5T(b)(6).\n\n      Taxpayers may use one of two methods to substantiate transportation\n\nexpenses. One method is to substantiate each element of an automobile-related\n\f                                        - 35 -\n\n[*35] deduction by adequate records--such as diaries or account books--that are\n\nmaintained by the taxpayer “at or near the time” when the expense was incurred.\n\n26 C.F.R. sec. 1.274-5T(c)(1) and (2). Alternatively, the taxpayer may\n\nsubstantiate each element of an expense with “other sufficient evidence”. Id.\n\npara. (c)(3). Using this alternative method, the taxpayer must establish each\n\nelement of the automobile-related deduction with a detailed personal statement\n\ncorroborated by other evidence. Id. para. (c)(3)(i). A taxpayer’s own statement\n\nalone is not sufficient. See Wolfgram v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-69, slip\n\nop. at 24 (“Testimony alone, without corroborative evidence, does not satisfy the\n\nrequirements of section 274(d)”).\n\n      On his Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted $1,421 of vehicle insurance\n\npremiums on line 15, $1,359 spent on vehicle repairs and maintenance on line 21,\n\nand an additional $2,149 in unidentified “car and truck expenses” on line 9. These\n\nexpenditures related to three vehicles: Mrs. Rogers’ Toyota Avalon, Mr. Rogers’\n\nMercedes S500, and petitioners’ son’s Jeep Cherokee. We disallow each because\n\npetitioners either: (a) used the vehicles for personal transportation, not business\n\ntravel, so that section 262(a) disallows the deductions; or (b) failed to adequately\n\nsubstantiate their entitlement to the vehicle-related deductions, so that section\n\n274(d) disallows the deductions. Neither Mr. Rogers’ testimony nor the limited\n\f                                           - 36 -\n\n[*36] business records offered as evidence are reliable or complete enough to\n\nshow the nature or quantum of the use of these vehicles. Additionally, Mr. Rogers\n\nadmitted both at trial and on his return to personal use of each of the vehicles yet\n\nclaimed 100% of the expenses as deductible. We sustain the IRS’s disallowance\n\nof these transportation expenses.\n\n      E.     Home office\n\n      On various lines of his Schedule C, Mr. Rogers deducted, as business\n\nexpenses, portions of the following amounts related to petitioners’ personal\n\nresidence on Abingdon Avenue:\n\n                                    Item                    Amount\n                 State Farm Insurance (line 15)              $1,001\n                 Atlantic Mutual Insurance (line 15)          2,220\n                 Replace home furnace (line 21)               1,495\n                 Roof repair (line 21)                        3,246\n                 Removal of dead tree (line 21)                 210\n                 Lawn care (line 21)                          1,557\n                 Pest control (line 21)                         137\n                 Homeowner’s assoc. dues (line 21)              150\n                 Utilities (line 25)                          3,000\n                 Alarm (line 27)                                842\n                  Total                                      13,858\n\f                                        - 37 -\n\n[*37] Section 280A(a) provides that “no deduction otherwise allowable under this\n\nchapter shall be allowed with respect to the use of a dwelling unit which is used by\n\nthe taxpayer during the taxable year as a residence”. However, the “home office”\n\nexception (on which Mr. Rogers relies) allows taxpayers to deduct certain\n\nexpenses which would otherwise be prohibited by section 280A(a), but only “to\n\nthe extent such item[s] * * * [are] allocable to a portion of the dwelling unit which\n\nis exclusively used on a regular basis” for business purposes. Sec. 280A(c)(1)\n\n(emphasis added). Therefore, Mr. Rogers must establish that a portion of the\n\nhome was used regularly for business purposes and that the identifiable portion\n\nwas used exclusively for business purposes.\n\n      At trial Mr. Rogers identified three rooms in the house that he claimed were\n\nused for business, but he offered no testimony or evidence as to the total number\n\nof rooms in the house. Mr. Rogers made no showing of the percentage of the\n\nhome that this area constituted, aside from his unsubstantiated and implausible\n\ntestimony that 50% of his home was used exclusively for business purposes.\n\nBecause credible evidence in the record does not identify a portion of the home\n\nthat was used exclusively for business purpose, these deductions Mr. Rogers\n\nclaimed “with respect to the use of” his home are disallowed by section 280A(a).\n\f                                       - 38 -\n\n[*38] F.     Unreimbursed employee expenses\n\n      Because an employee’s trade or business is deemed to consist of the\n\nperformance of services for an employer, taxpayers may deduct expenses that are:\n\n(a) nonreimbursable, (b) related to the employee’s trade or business of rendering\n\nservices to the employer,17 and (c) ordinary and necessary18 expenses of such a\n\ntrade or business.

A taxpayer claiming a business gift deduction must\n\nsubstantiate the cost and description of the gift, the date the gift was made, the\n\nbusiness reason for the gift, and the business relationship of the recipient to the\n\ntaxpayer. 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.274-5T(b)(5).\n\n      The parties agree that petitioners adequately substantiated four separate\n\ngifts of at least $25 each.

Of this amount, Mr. Rogers adequately substantiated both\n\nthe expenditure and the business purpose of $14 in copying fees and $157 in\n\nsubscription fees to Realtor ECommerce. We sustain the IRS’s determination\n\nregarding the remaining disputed “Other expenses” because petitioners failed to\n\nadequately substantiate the business purpose of each expenditure, as required by\n\nsections 162(a) and 262(a). Rather, the corroborating evidence provided at trial\n\noften shows a clear mixture of personal and business expenses claimed as business\n\f                                        - 41 -\n\n[*41] deductions; and petitioners made no efforts to distinguish business from\n\npersonal expenses.\n\nV.

Id.\n\n      The IRS’s bank deposits analysis of the joint PPI/L&R bank account\n\nestablished gross deposits of $1,566,960. From the gross deposits, the IRS\n\f                                         - 42 -\n\n[*42] subtracted $390,263 in capital contributions made by Mr. Rogers and\n\n$67,911 in non-taxable loan proceeds to arrive at a net deposits figure of\n\n$1,108,786. In addition to the net deposits, PPI’s general ledger showed income\n\nof $34,000 from Agresti, $2,000 from Peabody, and $200,000 from an unknown\n\nsource. Therefore, we have found that the gross receipts of PPI equal\n\n$1,344,786--i.e., the net deposits from the joint bank account plus the undeposited\n\nincome recorded on PPI’s general ledger.\n\n             2.     TEFRA jurisdiction\n\n      As he did for his 2003 year, Mr. Rogers argues that this Court lacks\n\njurisdiction to determine whether certain amounts reported as gross receipts on\n\nPPI’s tax return are income to PPI. Mr. Rogers contends: that portions of the\n\nalleged gross receipts (some of which PPI distributed to Mr. Rogers) are not\n\nincome to PPI but rather are in fact funds of Sugarloaf held in trust by PPI; that\n\nthis contention implicates partnership-level items of Sugarloaf Fund, LLC, a\n\npartnership subject to TEFRA; and that these issues must therefore be adjudicated\n\nat the partnership level of Sugarloaf. It is true that a partnership’s partnership\n\nitems must be adjudicated at the partnership level; but it is not true that the tax\n\nconsequences of every transaction in which a TEFRA partnership or partner\n\nhappens to be a party must be so adjudicated. A taxpayer cannot invalidate a\n\f                                       - 43 -\n\n[*43] notice of deficiency and require the IRS to issue an FPAA simply by\n\npointing out that his income was paid to him by an entity that happens to be a\n\npartner in a TEFRA partnership. If these payments to PPI raise tax partnership-\n\nlevel questions for Sugarloaf or its partners, those are not questions that we must\n\ndecide here. We decide only whether Mr. Rogers, through PPI, received income.\n\nHe did.20\n\n      20\n       In Rogers v. Commissioner, 728 F.3d at 674, on very similar facts,\nMr. Rogers made the same arguments for 2003 about a different partnership,\nWarwick Trading, LLC (which was his 2003 equivalent to Sugarloaf):\n\n              Rogers had created PPI--which plays a critical role in this case\n      --to sit between himself and Jetstream. The tax shelter was sold to\n      U.S. taxpayers for a total of $2.4 million. Half was the purchase price\n      of partnership interests in Warwick. The other half appears to have\n      been a payment to Rogers (via PPI) for creating the shelter. Rogers\n      directed the buyers of the interests (the shelter investors) to wire the\n      entire $2.4 million to PPI’s bank account rather than Warwick’s,\n      telling them that Warwick lacked adequate banking facilities. * * *\n\n            He argues that the $1.2 million retained by PPI (some of which,\n      however, PPI distributed to him) was held in trust for the benefit of\n      Warwick and that therefore the alleged tax deficiency was a\n      “partnership item” and so should have been resolved “at the\n      partnership level,” * * * and so not in this case, which is about\n      personal not partnership income. * * *\n\nThe Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit disposed of the argument succinctly:\n“But the Tax Court ruled in the present case that the money received by PPI and\neither retained by it or distributed to Rogers but not forwarded to Warwick was not\nheld in trust for Warwick--it was PPI’s money--and so the tax status of that money\n                                                                       (continued...)\n\f                                           - 44 -\n\n[*44]         3.       Funds not held in trust\n\n        As he asserted for 2003 in Rogers I, Mr. Rogers asserts here that certain\n\nunspecified funds retained by PPI and reported as gross receipts of PPI for 2004\n\nshould nonetheless be excluded from the gross receipts of PPI because the funds\n\nwere held in trust for Sugarloaf. And as we did in Rogers I for 2003, we find here\n\nthat Mr. Rogers did receive income, because the money received by PPI in 2004--\n\nand subsequently either retained by it or distributed to Mr. Rogers--was not held in\n\ntrust for Sugarloaf.\n\n        Here, as he did for 2003, Mr. Rogers provides no documentation evidencing\n\na trust between PPI and any third party, and we find no credible evidence in the\n\nrecord of such an agreement. Mr. Rogers again responds that no specific words of\n\ntrust are required. However, as was the case for 2003, this leaves him only the\n\noption of a constructive trust:\n\n               [A constructive trust] indeed usually lacks documentation --\n        because it’s not a real trust.

[Rogers\n      v. Commissioner, 728 F.3d at 675.]\n\nMr. Rogers’ own tax reporting for 2004 was at odds with his contention that a\n\ncertain portion (in fact, an unspecified amount) of the funds was held “in trust” by\n\nPPI. Mr. Rogers himself paid tax on a portion of this money (the $178,000\n\ncompensation for his services to PPI on his Schedule C), a characterization that is\n\ninconsistent with his having held the money in trust.21 Finally, even if we were to\n\n      21\n       As the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit observed in affirming\nRogers I:\n\n            Worse, if Rogers was holding in trust the money he received\n      from PPI and then using it to reimburse himself for legal services, he\n      was committing a grave breach of trust. He thus is driven to argue\n      both that the money was in trust and so not taxable to him and that it\n      was his personal property and so he committed no ethical or legal\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\f                                       - 46 -\n\n[*46] accept in principle Mr. Rogers’ argument that certain amounts deposited\n\nwith PPI were held in trust, Mr. Rogers provided no evidence substantiating which\n\namounts were held in trust (and were later sent to Sugarloaf Fund or used to pay\n\nSugarloaf Fund’s expenses). Therefore, his evidence does not support a finding\n\nthat any particular amounts paid to PPI are not income to PPI.\n\n             4.    Conclusion\n\n      In conclusion, PPI reported $846,066 in gross receipts on its 2004 Form\n\n1120S and received an additional $425,000 from Sugarloaf in 2004, and\n\npetitioners did not include this amount in the gross receipts of PPI on its 2004\n\nreturn. Its total taxable receipts were therefore $1,271,066.\n\n      B.     Deductions\n\n      After stipulations and concessions by the parties, the parties dispute the\n\nvalidity of more than $800,000 in business expense deductions claimed for PPI on\n\npetitioners’ 2004 Schedule E, “Supplemental Income and Loss”. We hold that,\n\nwith limited exceptions, petitioners have not substantiated either the expenditure\n\n\n\n\n      21\n        (...continued)\n      violations in using it to defray personal expenses. That is a tightrope\n      that no one can walk. * * * [Rogers v. Commissioner, 728 F.3d at\n      675; citations omitted.]\n\f                                        - 47 -\n\n[*47] or the business purpose (or both) of these expenses and that--subject to those\n\nlimited exceptions discussed below--we will sustain the IRS’s disallowance.\n\n             1.    Insurance\n\n      PPI deducted $9,778 for payment of insurance premiums on line 19 of its\n\nForm 1120S. A taxpayer may deduct insurance premiums if the insurance\n\ncoverage is ordinary and necessary for the taxpayer’s trade or business. 26 C.F.R.\n\nsec. 1.162-1(a). However, as we noted above, no deduction is allowed for\n\ninsurance with respect to property that is not used in a trade or business. Edgar v.\n\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 1979-524. Despite the parties’ stipulation that PPI\n\nactually spent $6,606 on insurance premiums, Mr. Rogers failed to substantiate the\n\nbusiness purpose of the insurance coverage. He offered no policy documents for\n\nthese premiums, nor did he testify at trial as to the business purpose of the\n\nexpense. Because Mr. Rogers failed to prove that the insurance was with respect\n\nto property used in his trade or business, we will sustain the disallowance of this\n\ndeduction.\n\n             2.    Repairs and maintenance\n\n      PPI deducted $3,670 for “Repairs” and $4,886 for “Maintenance” on its\n\n2004 Form 1120S. These expenses included deductions for lawn care at various\n\nproperties personally owned by petitioners and expenses to repair a vehicle which\n\f                                       - 48 -\n\n[*48] was used by their son both personally and for business. However, expenses\n\nthat relate to a taxpayer’s home must meet the strict substantiation requirements\n\nimposed by section 280A. Sec. 280A(a); see part IV.E above. Expenses related to\n\nvehicles must meet the equally stringent substantiation requirements of section\n\n280F. See part IV.D above. Because petitioners did not substantiate the business\n\npurpose of these expenses, we sustain the IRS’s determination related to this\n\ndeduction.\n\n             3.    Supplies\n\n      PPI deducted $21,220 for “Supplies”. PPI spent at least part of this amount\n\non furnishings and other expenses for petitioners’ son’s residence, gasoline for a\n\nmixed personal- and business-use vehicle driven by petitioners’ son, and other\n\npersonal items purchased for petitioners. Though credit card statements\n\nsubstantiate that the amounts were paid by petitioners or PPI, the charges on the\n\nstatements were to general retailers. Petitioners offered no itemized receipts, and\n\nno effort was made to distinguish which of these charges were personal and which\n\nwere for business purposes. Without substantiation of the business purpose\n\nbehind these expenses, we sustain the disallowance of this deduction.\n\f                                        - 49 -\n\n[*49]         4.    Telephone\n\n        Section 262(a) denies deductions for “personal, living or family expenses”,\n\nand pursuant to section 262(b), any charge for the first telephone line to a\n\nresidence of the taxpayer is treated as a personal expense. PPI deducted $14,881\n\nfor telephone expenses. To substantiate the deduction, petitioners offered an\n\nexpense log, credit card statements, assorted billing statements, and canceled\n\nchecks. However, neither the expense log nor Mr. Rogers’ testimony at trial\n\ndistinguished which portion of the telephone expense was for the first line to\n\npetitioners’ residence, nor which business entity used which telephone line.\n\nMoreover, the evidence in the record shows that a substantial majority of the\n\ncharges were billed to, or related to telephone services which were provided at,\n\npetitioners’ residence on Abingdon Road. Again, no credible evidence\n\ndistinguishes what portions of the expenses were for personal or business\n\npurposes. We therefore sustain the disallowance of this deduction.\n\n              5.    Automobile\n\n        PPI deducted $3,103 on its Form 1120S for “Automobile” expenses. At\n\ntrial, Mr. Rogers testified that this amount was spent on gasoline used by\n\npetitioners’ son and sometimes in one of petitioners’ personal automobiles.\n\nHowever, petitioners did not substantiate the business purpose of these expenses,\n\f                                        - 50 -\n\n[*50] and again cannot meet the heightened substantiation requirements of\n\nsections 274(d) and 280F. See part IV.D above. We therefore sustain the\n\ndisallowance of this deduction.\n\n             6.    Rent\n\n      PPI deducted $23,739 in “Rents”. Of this amount, the IRS conceded that\n\n$15,383 was deductible as rent paid to Palos Bank for office space rented by PPI\n\nin Homer Glen. The deductibility of the remaining $8,356 is in dispute, though\n\nthe IRS concedes that amount was spent by petitioners. At trial, petitioners\n\ntestified that the disputed amount consists of expenditures to rent vehicles, and a\n\nhotel in Florida. Petitioners did not substantiate the business purpose of the\n\nremaining expenses and also failed to meet the stringent substantiation\n\nrequirements imposed by section 274(d) for travel expenses and transportation\n\nexpenses. See part IV above. We therefore sustain the disallowance of the\n\nremaining amounts claimed as “Rents” deductions.\n\n             7.    Commissions\n\n      PPI deducted $365,608 for “Commissions” in 2004. Commissions paid in\n\nconnection with carrying on a trade or business are deductible under section 162 if\n\nthey are ordinary and necessary expenses. 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a). PPI carried\n\non a trade or business, and the parties agree that PPI actually paid $363,607 in\n\f                                        - 51 -\n\n[*51] commissions in 2004. At issue is whether the commissions were ordinary\n\nand necessary expenses--i.e., whether petitioners proved the business purpose of\n\nthese expenses.\n\n       Of the $363,607 paid, the parties stipulate that commissions totaling\n\n$271,052 are deductible as follows: $178,000 paid to Mr. Rogers is deductible by\n\nPPI; and $93,052 is deductible by L&R, not PPI. The deductibility of the\n\nremaining $92,555 is in dispute.\n\n      At trial, Mr. Rogers provided an executed consulting agreement between\n\nPPI and Portfolio Asset Recovery Consultoria e Assessoria Empresarial LTDA for\n\nservices related to PPI’s conduct of Brazilian receivables activities, as well as\n\nevidence of payment of $50,000 as provided by the terms of the agreement.\n\nFurther evidence in the record, combined with Mr. Rogers’ plausible testimony at\n\ntrial, substantiates deductions for the remaining $42,465, i.e., $25,000 paid to\n\nMulticred Investamentados Limitada (“Multicred”), a Brazilian collection\n\ncompany, and $17,465 in various other commissions related to proper PPI\n\nbusiness purposes.\n\f                                        - 52 -\n\n[*52]         8.    Parking\n\n        PPI deducted $1,306 in parking expenses on its Form 1120S. Deductions\n\nclaimed for parking are subject to the strict substantiation requirements imposed\n\nby section 274(d). Sec. 274(d)(1); 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.274-5T(a)(1). Though\n\npetitioners adequately substantiated the expenditure of this amount, they failed to\n\nsubstantiate how the parking expenses related to PPI’s business. We therefore\n\nsustain the disallowance of this deduction.\n\n              9.    Meals and entertainment\n\n        Expenses for meals and entertainment are deductible if the taxpayer\n\nprovides the substantiation required by section 274(d). See part IV.C above.\n\nSection 274(n) limits deductions for most meal and entertainment expenses to “50\n\npercent of the amount of such expense or item which would * * * be allowable as\n\na deduction under this chapter.”\n\n        PPI deducted $12,054 in expenses for meals and entertainment. Petitioners\n\nadequately substantiated $402 in meals expenses (before the 50% limit of section\n\n274(n) is applied) which correspond to the dates that Mr. Rogers traveled on PPI\n\nbusiness. The remaining meals and entertainment expenses lack sufficient\n\ndocumentation to prove their business purpose. Therefore, we sustain the\n\f                                       - 53 -\n\n[*53] disallowance of the claimed deductions for meals and entertainment, except\n\nfor $402 (subject to the 50% limit).\n\n             10.   Travel\n\n      Travel deductions are subject to the stringent reporting requirements of\n\nsection 274(d). See part IV.D above. PPI claimed $19,554 in travel deductions.\n\nThe parties agree that $1,067 of the amount claimed is properly deductible.\n\nFurther, petitioners concede that $5,093.95 is not deductible. The deductibility of\n\n$13,393.05 remains in dispute, though the IRS agrees that the expenditures were\n\nmade. However, petitioners again fail to meet the stringent substantiation\n\nrequirements of section 274(d) for travel deductions, specifically with respect to\n\nthe business purpose of the expenses. See part IV.D above. There is no\n\ndocumentation as to the business purpose of the remaining amounts outside of\n\nMr. Rogers’ unsupported testimony at trial or the demonstrative portions of the\n\ntravel diary. We sustain the IRS’s determination regarding the remaining\n\n$13,393.05 in travel expenses.\n\n             11.   Legal Fees\n\n      PPI deducted $316,628 of “Legal & Professional” fees. The parties agree\n\nthat PPI spent only $191,628, and the IRS conceded that $3,491 of the $191,628\n\nspent is deductible by PPI. The parties dispute the deductibility of the remaining\n\f                                       - 54 -\n\n[*54] $188,137. Ordinary and necessary expenses for legal fees paid or incurred\n\nduring the taxable year in carrying on a trade or business are allowed as\n\ndeductions. Sec. 162; 26 C.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a). However, “[b]usiness expenses\n\ndeductible from gross income include the ordinary and necessary expenditures\n\ndirectly connected with or pertaining to the taxpayer’s trade or business.” 26\n\nC.F.R. sec. 1.162-1(a) (emphasis added).\n\n      To substantiate this deduction, Mr. Rogers first provides invoices from the\n\nlaw firm Seyfarth Shaw to Sugarloaf c/o Multicred, and evidence in the record\n\nsuggests that PPI did in fact pay these amounts. However, Mr. Rogers fails to\n\ndemonstrate why PPI is the proper entity to deduct these legal expenses.\n\nSugarloaf is an LLC that elected to be classified as a partnership for Federal\n\nincome tax purposes for the 2004 tax year. Items of income and deduction are\n\ndetermined under applicable partnership statutes at the partnership level. Secs.\n\n701, 703. Because petitioners failed to substantiate how these legal expenses were\n\nincurred on behalf of PPI, PPI is not entitled to deduct these amounts.\n\n      Petitioners presented further evidence that PPI paid legal fees and expenses\n\nto Seyfarth Shaw, Paul J. Kozacky & Associates, and Chris Saternus. The record\n\ndoes not substantiate what business purpose entitled PPI to deduct these legal\n\nexpenses. The evidence of payment either bears notations that the fees related to\n\f                                        - 55 -\n\n[*55] PTI (Mr. Rogers’ unrelated entity), not PPI, or contains no indication of the\n\nscope or nature of the underlying work. Though the invoices were addressed to\n\nPPI, the descriptions of the work contained in the invoices related to patent\n\ninfringement claims brought by PTI. The record does not contain any indication\n\nthat PPI had an ownership interest in PTI or in the patent litigation related to PTI.\n\nTherefore, we sustain the disallowance of these deductions.22\n\n      Finally, petitioners provided evidence of amounts paid to Seyfarth Shaw,\n\nthe law firm of Altheimer & Grey, and entities named “ATU General Trust BVI”\n\nand “Chicago Title Insurance”, for which the evidence includes no underlying\n\ninvoice or statement of work. Given that other evidence in the record shows that\n\nPPI deducted expenses for work on matters related to PTI that were not ordinary\n\n\n\n\n      22\n         Petitioners’ only claim for deduction of these items is that they are an\nordinary and necessary business expense incurred by PPI, an entity whose income,\nlosses, deductions, and credits flow through to petitioners. Mr. Rogers testified\nthat he did not know whether he had an ownership interest in PTI in 2004. A\nclose examination of the record discloses that Mr. Rogers at one time was a\nshareholder of PTI, but the evidence is inconclusive as to whether he was during\nthe 2004 tax year at issue. Regardless, petitioners provided no evidence that PPI\nhad any interest in PTI; and we disallow the deduction for that reason. Since\npetitioners advance no other theory as to why these expenses should be deductible\nas flow-through deductions or otherwise, we consider no other alternative\narguments.\n\f                                          - 56 -\n\n[*56] and necessary to PPI’s business purpose,23 it is impossible to determine from\n\nthe record whether the work was related to PPI’s business purposes. Nor can we\n\nrule out the likely possibility that this legal work, too, was for PTI. We therefore\n\nsustain the disallowance of these deductions.\n\n               12.    PTI Subsidy\n\n      PPI deducted $104,182 for a “PTI Subsidy”. However, the “PTI Subsidy”\n\nconsisted of two payments made by Mr. Rogers that have no apparent connection\n\nto PPI. He made the payments to GPC (a co-owner of PTI) to fund the continued\n\noperation of PTI--and protect his investment in it--when it was experiencing\n\ndifficulty as a result of infringement by a competitor. While this money may have\n\nbeen used to pay ordinary and necessary expenses of PTI, for Mr. Rogers it was\n\nnot a deductible expense but a capital expenditure. See Koree v. Commissioner,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963).\n\n      Mr. Rogers was an officer (i.e., the treasurer) of PTI during 2004, and he\n\nclaims that the purpose of the “PTI Subsidy” was to protect him from potential\n\nliability for PTI’s debts. He asserts that PTI was insolvent and that Illinois law\n\nimposed on him, as an officer, fiduciary liability for PTI’s debts when PTI was\n\n\n      23\n           In fact, one of the checks written to Altheimer & Grey bears the notation\n“PTI”.\n\f                                       - 57 -\n\n[*57] insolvent.24 However, apart from Mr. Rogers’ very general, summary\n\ntestimony (apparently mistranscribed as “solvent” rather than “insolvent”, see Tr.\n\n55), there is no evidence that PTI was insolvent during 2004; and there is no\n\ncontemporaneous evidence from 2004 to corroborate his current explanation of the\n\npurpose of the “PTI Subsidy”. And even if we were to credit his account entirely,\n\nit would not yield any deduction for PPI.\n\nVI.   L&R gross receipts\n\n      Petitioners argue that, despite the fact that they reported $450,000 in gross\n\nreceipts on L&R’s 2004 return, the entity had no gross receipts. In the alternative,\n\npetitioners claim that, to the extent L&R is found to have had gross receipts, PPI\n\nshould be able to deduct an equal amount. However, neither argument is entirely\n\ncorrect.\n\n      The parties agree that PPI is not entitled to a $450,000 deduction for an\n\namount supposedly transferred to L&R because such a transfer was never made.\n\n\n      24\n         See Technic Eng’g, Ltd. v.

We agree with petitioner that\n\nL&R did not have gross receipts of $450,000 from PPI in 2004. However, as\n\nnoted above, the bank deposits analysis shows that the joint PPI/L&R bank\n\naccount accumulated $73,72025 in net deposits beyond those that were attributable\n\nto PPI. Accordingly, we find in respondent’s favor that L&R had $73,720 of\n\ntaxable gross receipts in 2004.\n\nVII. Accuracy-related penalty\n\n      Section 6662 imposes an “accuracy-related penalty” of 20% of the portion\n\nof the underpayment of tax that is attributable to the taxpayer’s negligence or\n\ndisregard of rules or regulations or the portion of the underpayment attributable to\n\nany substantial understatement of income tax. Sec. 6662(a), (b)(1), (b)(2). Under\n\nsection 7491(c), the IRS bears the burden of production and must produce\n\nsufficient evidence that the imposition of the penalty is appropriate in a given\n\ncase. Once the IRS meets this burden, the taxpayer must come forward with\n\n\n      25\n        PPI and L&R had a combined $1,344,786 in taxable receipts in 2004, as\nevidenced by PPI’s general ledger and the bank deposits analysis of the joint\nPPI/L&R account. We have found that the amount of this total that is attributable\nto PPI is $1,271,066, leaving $73,720 of taxable deposits unaccounted for.\n\f                                         - 59 -\n\n[*59] persuasive evidence that the IRS’s determination is incorrect. Rule 142(a);\n\nHigbee v. Commissioner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">T.C.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 446-447 (2001).\n\n      An understatement of an individual’s income tax is substantial if it exceeds\n\nthe greater of 10% of the tax required to be shown on the return or $5,000.\n\nSec. 6662(d)(1). Even though we have allowed additional deductions not allowed\n\nin the notice of deficiency, petitioners’ understatement of income tax for 2004\n\n(which will be recomputed pursuant to Rule 155) will evidently exceed the greater\n\nof 10% of the tax required to be shown on the return or $5,000. Accordingly, the\n\nCommissioner has met his burden to establish that petitioners’ return reflected a\n\n“substantial understatement”. Petitioners will therefore owe the accuracy-related\n\npenalty on the entire amount of the underpayment for each year unless they can\n\nsuccessfully invoke a defense to the penalty.\n\n      The section 6662(a) penalty is not imposed if a taxpayer can demonstrate\n\n(1) that he had reasonable cause for the underpayment and (2) that he acted in\n\ngood faith. Sec. 6664(c)(1). Whether a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and\n\nin good faith is a facts-and-circumstances decision, with the most important factor\n\nbeing the extent of the taxpayer’s efforts to assess his proper tax liability.\n\n26 C.F.R. sec. 1.6664-4(b)(1), Income Tax Regs. Also important is the taxpayer’s\n\nknowledge and experience. Id.\n\f                                         - 60 -\n\n[*60] Petitioners contend that the “level of detail required of taxpayer [sic] in this\n\nprocess has been very abnormal even for a naked audit.” However, this contention\n\nneither provides reasonable cause for petitioners’ underpayment nor indicates that\n\npetitioners exercised good faith. While the IRS may have conducted a rigorous\n\nexamination of petitioners’ tax returns and records, the level of thoroughness of\n\nthe examining agents during this process does not affect or bear upon the reporting\n\nrequirements imposed by the Code. The requirement that taxpayers lawfully\n\nreport their taxable income arises long before the examination process. See sec.\n\n6001. Petitioners’ record-keeping was in disarray; they failed to report large\n\namounts of income; and they claimed substantial deductions for which they had no\n\nproof at all and others for which their proof was gravely deficient.\n\n      Petitioners are sophisticated business people. Mr. Rogers is a highly\n\neducated attorney with more than 40 years’ experience dealing in a variety of\n\ncomplex tax matters. He was certainly able to distinguish personal from business\n\nexpenses, yet the evidence he used to substantiate their deductions show that he\n\nfailed to take care to make this distinction.\n\n      We find petitioners had neither reasonable cause nor good faith with regard\n\nto the positions they maintained on their return.
