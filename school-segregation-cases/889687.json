Simon, Chief Judge.\n\n\n\n    A RGUED F EBRUARY 24, 2012—D ECIDED D ECEMBER 20, 2012\n\n\n\n\n  Before M ANION and R OVNER, Circuit Judges, and\nC OLEMAN, District Judge. \n  R OVNER, Circuit Judge. After he pleaded guilty to a felon-\nin-possession charge, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), James Elliott\n\n\n\n  The Honorable Sharon Johnson Coleman, of the United States\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f2                                               No. 11-2766\n\nwas sentenced as an armed career criminal based on\nthe district court’s finding that a series of three robberies\nhe perpetrated in a five-day period when he was\neighteen years old were “committed on occasions\ndifferent from one another,” 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)(1). Elliot\nchallenges that finding, contending that he had a right\nto have a jury, rather than the judge, assess the nature\nof his prior crimes, and that our decision in United States\nv. Hudspeth, 42 F.3d 1015, 1019-22 (7th Cir. 1994) (en\nbanc), abrogated on other grounds by Shepard v. United\nStates, 544 U.S. 13, 125 S. Ct. 1254 (2005), should be over-\nruled. We affirm.\n\n\n                             I.\n  On October 22, 2009, police officers in Merrillville,\nIndiana were dispatched to a residence on complaints\nabout an unwanted person being present. They arrived\nto discover Elliott sitting on the front porch of the resi-\ndence with his hands in his pockets. Elliott briefly\nremoved his hands from his pockets when asked to do\nso, but reinserted them as the officers began to ap-\nproach him, assuring the officers that he had nothing\nin them. In fact, he did. When one of the officers\ngrabbed Elliott’s right hand, he discovered a loaded .22-\ncaliber revolver in his pocket.\n  Because Elliott previously had been convicted of six\nfelony offenses—including burglary, theft, and operating\na vehicle while intoxicated—federal law made it illegal\nfor him to possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). A\n\fNo. 11-2766                                                3\n\ngrand jury subsequently indicted him on a felon-in-posses-\nsion charge. The government then filed a notice\nindicating that it intended to seek an enhanced penalty\nbased on his criminal history pursuant to the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act (“ACCA”), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). In\nrelevant part, that statute specifies a minimum prison\nterm of fifteen years (and a maximum term of life) for\na felon-in-possession who has three previous con-\nvictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses “com-\nmitted on occasions different from one another.”\n§ 924(e)(1). Burglary qualifies as a violent crime for pur-\nposes of the ACCA. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The government\ncontended that Elliott’s convictions for three burglaries\nhe committed over a period of five days in 1998\nrendered him subject to the enhanced penalty specified\nby the ACCA. Without that enhancement, he would\notherwise have been subject to a maximum prison term\nof 10 years. § 924(a)(2).\n  Elliott, although he did not contest the fact of his\nprior convictions, nonetheless opposed the enhancement.\nAs relevant here, he contended that whether the three\nburglaries were committed on occasions different from\none another constituted a factual question as to which\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466,\n120 S. Ct. 2348 (2000), entitled him to a jury trial. Second,\nElliott argued that because the three burglaries took\nplace over a period of several days during what he re-\ngarded as a single criminal episode, the court should\nfind that they were not committed on occasions\n\f4                                                No. 11-2766\n\ndifferent from one another, and that consequently he\nwas not subject to the enhanced penalty.1\n  The district court rejected both arguments in a\nwritten opinion. United States v. Elliott, 2011 WL 3273466\n(N.D. Ind. Aug. 1, 2011). The court invoked Almendarez-\nTorres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 118 S. Ct. 1219 (1998),\nas its authority to make determinations regarding\nElliott’s criminal history. 2011 WL 3273466, at *4; see also\nR. 18-2 at 20-22. And, looking to our en banc decision\nin Hudspeth, the court found that the three 1998 burglaries\nwere committed on occasions different from one an-\nother. 2011 WL 3273466, at *2-*3. The court emphasized\nthat the burglaries were committed sequentially rather\nthan simultaneously, and that significantly more time\nhad passed between the burglaries than was the case in\nHudspeth, affording Elliott the opportunity after each\nburglary to cease his criminal conduct. Id., at *3. The\ncourt added at sentencing: “[C]learly when somebody\ncommits three burglaries over the course of five days,\nunder the way the Seventh Circuit and for that\nmatter, every other circuit it appears, has interpreted\n[section] 924[(e)], those would all be qualifying convic-\ntions.” R. 18-2 at 19.\n\n\n1\n   Elliott also argued below that the bright-line approach to\nthe different-occasions inquiry that we adopted in Hudspeth\nrenders the enhanced penalties imposed by the ACCA\nirrational and excessive, in violation of the Eighth Amend-\nment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishments. The district\ncourt rejected that contention, and Elliott does not renew the\nargument here.\n\fNo. 11-2766                                              5\n\n  The court proceeded to sentence Elliott to the minimum\nterm of 180 months specified by the ACCA. That term\nwas eight months below the low end of the sentencing\nrange recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n\n                            II.\n  Elliott renews his challenge to the armed career\ncriminal enhancement on appeal. As a threshold matter,\nhe contends that whether the three burglaries for which\nhe previously had been convicted occurred on occasions\ndifferent from one another was a fact-intensive issue\nthat he was entitled to have a jury resolve. He acknowl-\nedges that under Almendarez-Torres, the district judge\nis authorized to make certain findings regarding a de-\nfendant’s criminal history, but contends that whether\nhis prior crimes occurred on occasions different from\none another represents a distinct type of inquiry that\nAlmendarez-Torres does not authorize the judge to make.\nAs to the substance of the ACCA inquiry, Elliott urges\nthis court to overrule its en banc decision in Hudspeth,\na step that he believes would pave the way to recogni-\ntion that the three burglaries he committed in 1998\nwere indivisible components of a single, multi-day\ncrime spree and thus were not committed on occasions\ndifferent from one another. Both arguments present\nquestions of law that we review de novo. Kirkland v.\nUnited States, 687 F.3d 878, 882-83 (7th Cir. 2012); United\nStates v. Trennell, 290 F.3d 881, 889 (7th Cir. 2002).\n  As to the first issue, the district judge was empowered\nto determine whether Elliott committed the burglaries\n\f6                                                   No. 11-2766\n\non occasions different from one another. The Supreme\nCourt in Almendarez-Torres held that a defendant’s recidi-\nvism is not an element of the offense which must be\nfound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, but rather is\na sentencing factor that may be found by the sentencing\njudge, even when recidivism increases the statutory\nmaximum penalty to which the defendant is exposed.\n523 U.S. at 239, 243-46, 118 S. Ct. at 1228-29, 1230-32.\nAlmendarez-Torres has remained good law even as the\nCourt in later decisions has recognized a defendant’s\nright to a jury finding on other factors that expose the\ndefendant to a longer sentence. See Jones v. United States,\n526 U.S. 227, 119 S. Ct. 1215 (1999); Apprendi v. New Jersey,\nsupra, 530 U.S. 466, 120 S. Ct. 2348; Blakely v. Washington,\n542 U.S. 296, 124 S. Ct. 2531 (2004); United States v. Booker,\n543 U.S. 220, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005); United States v. O’Brien,\n130 S. Ct. 2169 (2010). Indeed, each of these cases has\nexpressly cited the fact of a prior conviction as an excep-\ntion to the rule it stated. Jones, 526 U.S. at 243 n.6, 119 S. Ct.\nat 1224 n.6; Apprendi, 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S. Ct. at 2362-63;\nBlakely, 542 U.S. at 301, 124 S. Ct. at 2536; Booker, 543\nU.S. at 244, 125 S. Ct. at 756; O’Brien, 130 S. Ct. at 2174.2\n\n\n2\n  This is not to say that the future of Almendarez-Torres is\nsecure. Justice Thomas’s concurrence in Shepard v. United States\nremarked that “Almendarez-Torres . . . has been eroded by this\nCourt’s subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and a\nmajority of the Court now recognizes that Almendarez-Torres\nwas wrongly decided.” 544 U.S. 13, 27, 125 S. Ct. 1254, 1264\n(2005) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the\njudgment). We ourselves have observed:\n                                                  (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-2766                                                        7\n\n  Elliott has a point when he stresses that whether a\ndefendant’s prior crimes occurred on occasions\ndifferent from one another is a question that looks\nbeyond “the fact of a prior conviction,” see Blakely, 542\nU.S. at 301, 124 S. Ct. at 2536 (quoting Apprendi), and for\nthat matter beyond the elements essential to that convic-\ntion, see Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S. 575, 599, 602, 110\nS. Ct. 2143, 2158, 2160 (1990); see also Nijhawan v. Holder,\n557 U.S. 29, 33-36, 129 S. Ct. 2294, 2298-2300 (2009) (distin-\nguishing statutory provisions which call for categorical\ninquiry into nature of defendant’s prior conviction\nfrom those which call for circumstance-specific inquiry\ninto facts underlying defendant’s prior conviction). The\nfacts that inform the determination of whether prior\ncrimes occurred on different occasions—including the\ntimes and dates, places, and victims of those crimes—\nusually do not constitute essential elements of a convic-\n\n\n\n2\n    (...continued)\n       Almendarez-Torres is vulnerable to being overruled not\n       because of Shepard but because of United States v. Booker, 543\n       U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738 (2005). Booker holds that there is a\n       right to a jury trial and to the reasonable-doubt standard\n       in a sentencing proceeding (that is, the Sixth Amendment\n       is applicable) if the judge’s findings dictate an increase\n       in the maximum penalty. Id. at 756. Findings made under\n       the Armed Career Criminal Act do that. So if logic rules,\n       those findings too are subject to the Sixth Amendment. . . .\nUnited States v. Browning, 436 F.3d 780, 782 (7th Cir. 2006).\nWe added, however, that “the continued authority of\nAlmendarez-Torres is not for us to decide.” Id.\n\f8                                                No. 11-2766\n\ntion. See, e.g., United States v. Cina, 699 F.2d 853, 859 (7th\nCir. 1983) (“An ‘essential’ or ‘material’ element of the\ncrime is one whose specification with precise accuracy\nis necessary to establish the very illegality of the behavior\nand thus the court’s jurisdiction. Only in rare cases is time\na material element of the offense charged, even where\ncontinuing offenses such as conspiracy are alleged.”)\n(citation omitted); United States v. Muhammad, 928\nF.2d 1461, 1470 (7th Cir. 1991) (“[T]he location where\nthe offense took place is not an ‘essential’ or ‘material’\nelement of the crime as that term was defined in Cina.”);\ncf. United States v. Alhalabi, 443 F.3d 605, 613 (7th Cir.\n2006) (payment amounts referenced in food stamp\nfraud charges were not material elements of the offense).\nOn the other hand, because facts of this nature serve\nto define the scope of a crime, provide notice to the defen-\ndant of what precisely he is charged with doing so that\nhe can prepare a defense, and protect him against\ndouble jeopardy, see United States v. Castaldi, 547 F.3d\n699, 703 (7th Cir. 2008); United States v. Blanchard, 542\nF.3d 1133, 1140 (7th Cir. 2008); United States v. Andrus, 775\nF.2d 825, 843-44 (7th Cir. 1985); United States v. Horton, 676\nF.2d 1165, 1169 (7th Cir. 1982), they are closely inter-\nwoven with the essential elements of an offense. We\nrecently observed that “in rejecting arguments after\nApprendi that the separate occasions determination falls\noutside the Almendarez-Torres exception, we and other\ncircuits have gone to great lengths to explain that the\nfacts related to whether prior convictions occurred on\ndifferent occasions cannot be easily distinguished from\nthe facts related to the existence of the prior convic-\n\fNo. 11-2766                                                   9\n\ntions.” Kirkland v. United States, supra, 687 F.3d at 890 (coll.\ncases). Moreover, facts such as these, although they are\nnot normally essential elements of a conviction, will\nfrequently, if not usually, be disclosed in charging docu-\nments, plea agreements, findings of fact resulting from\na bench trial, and other materials that the Supreme\nCourt described as “conclusive records made or used in\nadjudicating guilt.” Shepard v. United States, supra, 544\nU.S. at 21, 125 S. Ct. at 1260. Our decision in Kirkland\nemphasizes that a court’s inquiry as to the different-\noccasions prong of the ACCA is limited to such docu-\nments. 687 F.3d at 888-89.\n  Consequently, this court, like our sister circuits, has\nconstrued Almendarez-Torres to permit a district court to\nmake a finding for purposes of the ACCA as to whether\na defendant committed three or more violent felonies\nor serious drug offenses on occasions different from\none another. United States v. Hendrix, 509 F.3d 362, 375-76\n(7th Cir. 2007); United States v. Morris, 293 F.3d 1010, 1012-\n13 (7th Cir. 2002); United States v. Skidmore, 254 F.3d\n635, 642 (7th Cir. 2001) (coll. cases from other circuits).\nIndeed, our decisions have explicitly rejected the very\nargument that Elliot makes here—namely, that deter-\nmining the relationship of a defendant’s prior crimes to\none another is beyond the scope of the finding that\nAlmendarez-Torres permits a judge to make. See Hendrix,\n509 F.3d at 375-76 (citing United States v. Schlifer, 403 F.3d\n849, 852 (7th Cir. 2005) (determination whether de-\nfendant’s prior crimes were unrelated, for purposes of\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.1, is not beyond scope of inquiry judge\nmay make under Almendarez-Torres)); Morris, 293 F.3d\nat 1012-13. As we observed in Morris:\n\f10                                              No. 11-2766\n\n     The Almendarez-Torres Court even cited § 924(e) of\n     the ACCA as one of many examples for the proposi-\n     tion that “prior commission of a serious crime—is as\n     typical a sentencing factor as one might imagine.”\n     523 U.S. at 230, 118 S. Ct. 1219. Moreover, the recidi-\n     vism enhancement at issue in Almendarez–Torres\n     also limited the convictions that could be consid-\n     ered—to include only aggravated felonies. Morris\n     has failed to articulate a reasoned basis for distin-\n     guishing the factor at issue here from other factors\n     traditionally considered in enhancing a sentence\n     based on recidivism.\n293 F.3d at 1012-13. Thus, unless and until the Supreme\nCourt overrules Almendarez-Torres or confines its holding\nsolely to the fact of a prior conviction, as opposed to the\nnature and/or sequence of a defendant’s prior crimes,\na district judge properly may make the findings\nrequired by the ACCA.\n  Hudspeth supplies the answer to the second question\npresented by Elliott’s appeal—whether the three\nburglaries he committed in 1998 occurred on\noccasions different from one another. Our discussion of\nthe different-occasions inquiry in Hudspeth began with\nthe recognition of widespread agreement among the\ncircuit courts that a defendant will be subject to the\nACCA enhancement “if each of [his] prior convictions\narose out of a ‘separate and distinct criminal episode.’ ” 42\nF.3d at 1019 (quoting United States v. Schieman, 894 F.2d\n909, 911 (7th Cir. 1990) (emphasis in Hudspeth) & coll.\ncases). Factors relevant to that assessment include the\nnature of the crimes, the identities of the victims, and the\n\fNo. 11-2766                                               11\n\nlocations where the crimes took place. Id. We also recog-\nnized that the timing is a relevant consideration, but to\na limited extent: crimes that occur simultaneously will\nbe deemed to have occurred on a single occasion; but\nthe passage of even a small amount of time between\ncrimes—10 minutes in Schieman—may well suffice to\nseparate them for purposes of the ACCA. Id. at 1919-20.\nWhat really matters, we emphasized, is the opportunity\nof the perpetrator to terminate his wrongdoing. Id.\nat 1020. Thus, even when a defendant has committed\na multi-crime spree over a short period of time, each\noffense comprising the spree will be considered to have\noccurred on a separate occasion so long as the defendant\nat each step had the opportunity to stop and proceed\nno further. Id. (citing United States v. Brady, 988 F.2d 664,\n668-69 (6th Cir. 1993) (en banc)). When a defendant com-\nmits multiple crimes simultaneously—as when he robs\nmore than one person at the same time, or commits\nessentially one act that violates multiple criminal stat-\nutes—there is no dividing point between the offenses\nthat affords him the chance to desist from further\ncriminal activity. See id. at 1020, 1021. “In contrast, a\ndefendant who commits sequential crimes has the oppor-\ntunity at each and every turn to withdraw from his crimi-\nnal activity.” Id. at 1021. Therefore, we concluded, a\ncourt’s inquiry as to the timing of the prior offenses\n“is simple: were the crimes simultaneous or were they\nsequential?” Id. at 1021 (emphasis in original).\n  Having adopted that bright-line rule, our assessment\nof the prior crimes at issue in Hudspeth was straightfor-\nward. The defendant and his accomplices had committed\na series of three burglaries over a period of 36 minutes\n\f12                                                  No. 11-2766\n\nagainst three adjoining businesses in a strip mall: they\nhad first pried open the door of a dry cleaners, then\nused a sledgehammer to break through a wall separating\nthe cleaners from the donut shop next door, and from\nthere forced open a door connecting the donut shop\nwith an insurance company; along the way, they ran-\nsacked all three businesses. Because the defendant had\nburglarized the three businesses in sequence rather than\nsimultaneously, we deemed the burglaries to have oc-\ncurred on different occasions for purposes of the ACCA:\n     Entry into each successive business reflected a clear\n     and deliberate choice to commit a “distinct aggres-\n     sion,” [United States v.] Godinez, 998 F.2d [471] at\n     473 [(7th Cir. 1993)]. At any given point in time\n     during his crime spree, Hudspeth was free to cease\n     and desist from further criminal activity. He\n     instead chose to continue. Because of his three deci-\n     sions to enter each successive business, it is evident\n     that he intended “to engage in a separate criminal\n     episode.” [United States v.] Tisdale, 921 F.2d [1095] at\n     1099 [10th Cir. 1990)]; see also Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472\n     (“one crime hard on the heels of another can be a\n     ‘separate and distinct criminal episode,’ as Schieman\n     itself shows.”).\n42 F.3d at 1022.3\n\n\n3\n  Our understanding of the facts surrounding the burglaries\nat issue in Hudspeth rested to a significant extent on the\npolice reports regarding those burglaries. See 42 F.3d at 1018 &\nn.3. The Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Shepard\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-2766                                                13\n\n  Hudspeth’s result and rationale leave no question that\nElliott’s three prior burglaries likewise occurred on dif-\nferent occasions. The burglaries involved different\nvictims and different homes, and they took place sequen-\ntially rather than simultaneously. Elliott, like Hudspeth,\nthus had an opportunity after each burglary to con-\ntemplate what he was doing and abandon his course\nof criminal conduct. Indeed, Elliott’s burglaries took\nplace over the course of five days—and one or more\ndays apart from one another—rather than over the\ncourse of 36 minutes, as was the case in Hudspeth.\nElliott thus had far more of an opportunity to change\ncourse and desist from wrongdoing than did Hudspeth.\nSee, e.g., United States v. Nigg, 667 F.3d 929, 936 (7th Cir.)\n(three armed robberies committed over six days consti-\ntuted separate criminal episodes under Hudspeth), cert.\ndenied, 132 S. Ct. 2704 (2012); United States v. Hunter, 418\nF. App’x 490, 493-94 (7th Cir. 2011) (non-precedential\ndecision) (recognizing that it would be frivolous to\ncontend that robberies of five different victims in dif-\nferent locations on same day constituted a single\ncriminal episode, notwithstanding fact that they all\n\n\n\n3\n   (...continued)\ndisapproved reliance on such extra-judicial records in\nassessing the nature of a defendant’s prior convictions. 544\nU.S. at 26, 125 S. Ct. at 1263. To the extent Hudspeth deemed\nit proper to resort to such documents in evaluating the rela-\ntionship of a defendant’s prior crimes to one another,\nour decision on that point is no longer good law, as we recog-\nnized in Kirkland, 687 F.3d at 886-87 & n.9.\n\f14                                               No. 11-2766\n\nstemmed from same bank robbery, as robberies were\ncommitted sequentially rather than simultaneously);\nUnited States v. Reyna, 327 F. App’x 660, 661 (7th Cir.\n2009) (non-precedential decision) (agreeing that it would\nbe frivolous to argue that burglaries of three different\nhomes over six days constituted a single criminal episode\nunder Hudspeth, as defendant had “the opportunity to\nchange his mind before undertaking each successive\nburglary”); United States v. Hale, 227 F. App’x 506, 508-\n10 (7th Cir. 2007) (non-precedential decision) (two rob-\nberies of different businesses on same day con-\nstituted separate offenses under Hudspeth); United States\nv. Morris, supra, 293 F.3d at 1014 (under Hudspeth and\nother precedents, two shootings on same night,\n“although close in time and location, involved distinct\ncriminal aggressions from which [defendant] had an\nopportunity to cease and withdraw”); United States v.\nCardenas, 217 F.3d 491, 492 (7th Cir. 2000) (three sales\nof crack cocaine to informants over two days, with\ntwo sales taking place only 45 minutes and half a block\napart, amounted to distinct criminal episodes under\nHudspeth); United States v. Gilbert, 45 F.3d 1163, 1168-69\n(7th Cir. 1995) (burglaries of five public school\nbuildings over three-day period constituted distinct\nepisodes, where burglaries “involved separate schools,\ndifferent victims, and distinct locations”).\n  Hudspeth makes the result in this appeal a foregone\nconclusion; but that does not mean that overruling\nHudspeth, as Elliott urges us to do, would lead to a different\noutcome. Overruling a precedent obviously “is not a step\n\fNo. 11-2766                                              15\n\nwe take lightly,” NewPage Wis. Sys. Inc. v. United Steel\nWorkers Int’l Union, 651 F.3d 775, 779 (7th Cir. 2011), and\noverruling an en banc decision is something that only\nthe full court could do, United States v. Carpenter, 406\nF.3d 915, 916 (7th Cir. 2005). Moreover, we typically\nreserve reexamination of a precedent for a case in which\nabandoning that precedent would make a difference.\nE.g., Loomis v. Exelon Corp., 658 F.3d 667, 675 (7th Cir.\n2011). Here, as the district court implied when it observed\nthat Elliott’s prior burglaries would meet the ACCA’s\ndifferent-occasions test under the law of this or any\nother circuit, even setting aside Hudspeth, Elliott\nis unlikely to prevail in his contention that his prior\nburglaries constituted a single rather than multiple crimes.\n  The rationale of the dissents in Hudspeth is illuminating\nin this regard. Both dissents were critical of the bright-\nline rule distinguishing simultaneous crimes from sequen-\ntial ones. 42 F.3d at 1026-27 (Flaum, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part); id. at 1035, 1037 (Ripple, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). Both argued\nfor a less rigid approach that would allow more\npragmatic judgments in examining a set of prior crimes\nto determine whether they should be treated as sepa-\nrate or distinct criminal episodes. Judge Flaum sug-\ngested that “a nuanced, fact-based approach better\nresolves how many occasions are encompassed within a\nparticular course of conduct.” Id. at 1027. Judge Ripple\nobserved that the court’s adoption of a bright-line test\nconstituted a departure from its prior decisions in this\narea, which “ha[d] reflected a thoughtful and measured\napproach to the task required by the statute—identifying\n\f16                                              No. 11-2766\n\nthose criminals whose repetitive behavior requires a\nspecial degree of isolation from society.” Id. at 1035; see\nalso id. at 1037. He argued that “[f]actors of time and\ndistance must be evaluated in terms of the legislative\nintent in order to identify and segregate the true recidi-\nvist.” Id. at 1036. Looking at the facts in Hudspeth\nthrough that lens, Judge Ripple concluded that the\nseries of three burglaries should be treated as a single\nepisode:\n     In a very short period of time, Mr. Hudspeth and his\n     accomplices, with a sledgehammer and other tools,\n     broke into three adjoining businesses in one location\n     and ransacked them. Their arrival with such tools\n     designed to expedite the penetration of the walls\n     between the adjacent businesses reflects a clear plan\n     for the group to work together to break through\n     from one business to another. This venture did not\n     comprise “distinct aggressions,” [Godinez, 998 F.2d\n     at 473], but rather a singular, continuous course\n     of conduct that depended on the spatial proximity of\n     these stores. . . .\nId. Judge Flaum agreed:\n     I view the fact that Hudspeth and his partners\n     entered several attached but separate stores at sequen-\n     tial addresses, as opposed to, for example, several\n     departments of a single larger store, to be a mere\n     fortuity in these circumstances.\nId. at 1027.\n  It is worth pointing out that neither dissent signaled\nany disagreement with the holdings of pre-Hudspeth\n\fNo. 11-2766                                               17\n\ndecisions like Schieman and Godinez, which were given\nsignificant attention in the majority decision in Hudspeth\nand which treated crimes committed within a very\nshort time of one another as separate episodes for\npurposes of the ACCA. See Schieman, 894 F.2d 909 (defen-\ndant assaulted police officer who approached him\nto question him about burglary he had committed some\nfive to 10 minutes earlier and three blocks away); Godinez,\n998 F.2d 471 (defendant kidnapped woman in order to\nuse her car in robbery, which he committed slightly\nmore than one hour after the kidnapping). Judge Ripple’s\ndissent, in fact, recognized that the sort of recidivism\nthat Congress meant to punish more severely when it\nenacted the ACCA “can be manifest in relatively short\ntime frames and in situations not far removed from\neach other,” and his dissent cited many cases to that\neffect. 42 F.3d at 1035 & n.20.\n  Instead, the dissenters believed that the majority’s error\nin Hudspeth lay in emphasizing the sequential nature of\na defendant’s criminal acts to the exclusion of other\ncircumstances suggesting that those acts ought to be\ntreated as part of a single criminal episode. Illustratively,\nJudge Ripple pointed out that under the majority’s\nsimultaneous-versus-sequential test, a defendant who\nenters a dwelling and shoots multiple people simulta-\nneously with one burst of automatic weapons fire\ncommits a single aggression, but if he then walks into\nanother room to shoot another person, he commits a\nsecond, distinct aggression. Id. at 1037. Judge Flaum\nsimilarly noted that the majority’s way at looking\nat sequencing attributed artificial importance to\n\f18                                                 No. 11-2766\n\nfortuitous circumstances: thus, in Hudspeth, the sequen-\ntial burglaries of adjoining but separate businesses\nwere treated as distinct criminal episodes, whereas\nan unlawful entry into a single business, and the\nensuing break-in into several locked offices within that\nbusiness, would be deemed one criminal episode. Id.\nat 1026.\n  Overruling Hudspeth would remove just one of the\nobstacles to Elliott’s position. It would do away with\nHudspeth’s bright-line rule and leave room for the\nmore nuanced judgments for which the dissenters in\nthat case advocated. If the facts underlying Elliott’s\nthree prior burglaries were comparable to those at issue\nin Hudspeth, the door might be open to Elliott’s con-\ntention that his prior burglaries constituted one criminal\nepisode for purposes of the ACCA. But Elliott did not\nburglarize, one right after the other, three business\nin the same mall or three adjoining townhouses. He\nburglarized three different residences on different\ndays.4 Even with Hudspeth cleared from his path, Elliott\nstill would have to contend with a wealth of authority,\nincluding precedents like Schieman and Godinez, which\ntreat crimes committed at different locations and at\ndifferent times—even when separated only by a matter\n\n\n\n4\n  Elliott’s counsel informs us, although this fact is not in the\nrecord, that each of the residences Elliott burglarized were\napartments essentially in the same complex. Even so, it is\nclear from the record Elliott did not burglarize the apart-\nments seriatim on the same day.\n\fNo. 11-2766                                                  19\n\nof minutes or hours—as distinct for purposes of the\nACCA. See United States v. Hale, supra, 227 F. App’x at 510\n(“even if we were to employ a case-by-case approach,\nas Hale advocates, the facts of his case do not suggest\nthat his two robberies [of different businesses on same\nday] could be considered one”); United States v. Godinez,\nsupra, 998 F.2d at 473 (“Godinez . . . committed his\ncrimes against different victims, in different places,\nmore than an hour apart. It would strain language con-\nsiderably, without serving any purpose plausibly attrib-\nuted to Congress, to treat the kidnapping and the rob-\nbery as a single ‘occasion.’ ”); Schieman, 894 F.2d at 913\n(“Schieman had successfully completed the burglary\nof Jenny’s Cake Fair and safely escaped from the prem-\nises before committing the subsequent offense [five to\n10 minutes later].”); see also United States v. Spears, 443 F.3d\n1358, 1360 (11th Cir. 2006) (two robberies of multiple\nvictims in same parking lot within two minutes and 25\nto 30 feet of one another); United States v. Deroo, 304\nF.3d 824, 828 (8th Cir. 2002) (“Crimes occurring even\nminutes apart can qualify [as distinct criminal acts],\nhowever, if they have different victims and are com-\nmitted in different locations.”) (citing United States v.

Tisdale, supra, 921 F.2d\nat 1098-99 (burglaries of two businesses and post office\nlocated inside of same shopping mall in course of one\nnight); United States v. Washington, 898 F.2d 439, 442\n(5th Cir. 1990) (successive robberies of same clerk at\nsame convenience market several hours apart).\n  Elliott’s theory is that his prior burglaries comprised\na single crime spree triggered by a need for money to\nsupport his drug habit. But on that view, even a long\nstring of crimes, committed over a much greater\nexpanse of time than Elliott’s burglaries were, could be\nconstrued as a single criminal episode. An addiction to\ndrugs or alcohol, for example, may be at the root of crimi-\nnal behavior that spans years rather than days. (Elliott’s\nown addiction to multiple narcotics appears to have\nplagued him for a substantial period of his life.) There\nmight be some sense in treating a series of crimes as\nessentially one, indivisible episode, particularly when\nthe crimes occurred in a discrete part of the defendant’s\npast and are explained by something like an addiction\nthat the defendant later overcame. The district judge in\nthis case himself entertained “long thoughts” about\nhow Elliott’s prior burglaries were best characterized.\n2011 WL 3273466, at *1; R. 18-2 at 20.\n\fNo. 11-2766                                               21\n\n  Nonetheless, it is difficult to reconcile Elliott’s theory\nwith the language that the ACCA uses. The statute\nrefers to crimes “committed on occasions different from\none another.” § 924(e)(1). When a day or more has\npassed between offenses, especially when the offenses\nwere committed at different locations and against\ndifferent victims, logic suggests that these crimes\noccurred on different occasions. See, e.g., United States v.\nRoss, 569 F.3d 821, 823-24 (8th Cir. 2009) (two crack\ncocaine sales made three days apart to same informant);\nUnited States v. Thompson, 421 F.3d 278, 285 (4th Cir. 2005)\n(seven residential burglaries occurring on six different\ndates, some within days of one another and two on\nsame day); United States v. Stearns, 387 F.3d 104, 108-09\n(1st Cir. 2004) (two burglaries of same warehouse on\nconsecutive days); United States v. Richardson, 230 F.3d\n1297, 1300 (11th Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (two burglaries\nof different buildings at least 30 hours apart), abrogated\non other grounds by Shepard v. United States, supra, 544\nU.S. 13, 125 S. Ct. 1254; (United States v. Melina-Gutierrez,\n980 F.2d 980, 983 (5th Cir. 1992) (three burglaries com-\nmitted within weeks of one another); United States v.\nRoach, 958 F.2d 679, 683-84 (6th Cir. 1992) (three drug\nsales made over course of two weeks, two of which\nwere separated by one day). Elliott himself cites no case\nto the contrary. The cases that he does cite are readily\ndistinguishable, in that they involve crimes that over-\nlapped temporally, see United States v. Willoughby, 653\nF.3d 738, 744-45 (8th Cir. 2011) (near-simultaneous sales\nof marijuana to police officer and informant as they\nstood side by side in defendant’s living room); United\n\f22                                            No. 11-2766\n\nStates v. Towne, 870 F.2d 880, 891 (2d Cir. 1989) (kidnap\nand rape of same victim), or took place on the heels of\none another, see United States v. Murphy, 107 F.3d 1199,\n1210 (6th Cir. 1997) (defendant was guarding victim at\nthe site of the first burglary while his accomplices pro-\nceeded to burglarize next-door residence in same du-\nplex); United States v. Graves, 60 F.3d 1183, 1187 (6th\nCir. 1995) (defendant’s assault on police officer while\nattempting to flee from the site of his burglary). The\ndistrict court was therefore correct when it observed\nthat Elliot’s burglaries would not be treated as a single\ncriminal episode under any jurisdiction’s precedent.\n\n\n                           III.\n  The district court committed no error in finding that\nElliott’s burglaries occurred on different occasions\nfor purposes of the ACCA. The burglaries occurred on\ndifferent days and involved different residences and\nvictims. Under any plausible construction of the\nstatute’s different-occasions language, the burglaries\nconstituted distinct criminal episodes. Reconsideration\nof the approach that this court adopted in Hudspeth\nwould not lead to a different result on the facts of this\ncase. To the extent that the statute produces results that\nare perceived as unjust, the problem is one for Congress\nto fix rather than this court.\n                                               A FFIRMED.\n\n                         12-20-12\n\f",

We affirm.\n\n\n                             I.\n  On October 22, 2009, police officers in Merrillville,\nIndiana were dispatched to a residence on complaints\nabout an unwanted person being present. They arrived\nto discover Elliott sitting on the front porch of the resi-\ndence with his hands in his pockets. Elliott briefly\nremoved his hands from his pockets when asked to do\nso, but reinserted them as the officers began to ap-\nproach him, assuring the officers that he had nothing\nin them. In fact, he did. When one of the officers\ngrabbed Elliott’s right hand, he discovered a loaded .22-\ncaliber revolver in his pocket.\n  Because Elliott previously had been convicted of six\nfelony offenses—including burglary, theft, and operating\na vehicle while intoxicated—federal law made it illegal\nfor him to possess a firearm. 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1). A\n\fNo. 11-2766                                                3\n\ngrand jury subsequently indicted him on a felon-in-posses-\nsion charge. The government then filed a notice\nindicating that it intended to seek an enhanced penalty\nbased on his criminal history pursuant to the Armed\nCareer Criminal Act (“ACCA”), 18 U.S.C. § 924(e). In\nrelevant part, that statute specifies a minimum prison\nterm of fifteen years (and a maximum term of life) for\na felon-in-possession who has three previous con-\nvictions for violent felonies or serious drug offenses “com-\nmitted on occasions different from one another.”\n§ 924(e)(1). Burglary qualifies as a violent crime for pur-\nposes of the ACCA. § 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The government\ncontended that Elliott’s convictions for three burglaries\nhe committed over a period of five days in 1998\nrendered him subject to the enhanced penalty specified\nby the ACCA. Without that enhancement, he would\notherwise have been subject to a maximum prison term\nof 10 years. § 924(a)(2).\n  Elliott, although he did not contest the fact of his\nprior convictions, nonetheless opposed the enhancement.\nAs relevant here, he contended that whether the three\nburglaries were committed on occasions different from\none another constituted a factual question as to which\nthe Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and the Supreme\nCourt’s decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Second,\nElliott argued that because the three burglaries took\nplace over a period of several days during what he re-\ngarded as a single criminal episode, the court should\nfind that they were not committed on occasions\n\f4                                                No. 11-2766\n\ndifferent from one another, and that consequently he\nwas not subject to the enhanced penalty.1\n  The district court rejected both arguments in a\nwritten opinion.

The court emphasized\nthat the burglaries were committed sequentially rather\nthan simultaneously, and that significantly more time\nhad passed between the burglaries than was the case in\nHudspeth, affording Elliott the opportunity after each\nburglary to cease his criminal conduct. Id., at *3. The\ncourt added at sentencing: “[C]learly when somebody\ncommits three burglaries over the course of five days,\nunder the way the Seventh Circuit and for that\nmatter, every other circuit it appears, has interpreted\n[section] 924[(e)], those would all be qualifying convic-\ntions.” R. 18-2 at 19.\n\n\n1\n   Elliott also argued below that the bright-line approach to\nthe different-occasions inquiry that we adopted in Hudspeth\nrenders the enhanced penalties imposed by the ACCA\nirrational and excessive, in violation of the Eighth Amend-\nment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishments. The district\ncourt rejected that contention, and Elliott does not renew the\nargument here.\n\fNo. 11-2766                                              5\n\n  The court proceeded to sentence Elliott to the minimum\nterm of 180 months specified by the ACCA. That term\nwas eight months below the low end of the sentencing\nrange recommended by the Sentencing Guidelines.\n\n\n                            II.\n  Elliott renews his challenge to the armed career\ncriminal enhancement on appeal. As a threshold matter,\nhe contends that whether the three burglaries for which\nhe previously had been convicted occurred on occasions\ndifferent from one another was a fact-intensive issue\nthat he was entitled to have a jury resolve. He acknowl-\nedges that under Almendarez-Torres, the district judge\nis authorized to make certain findings regarding a de-\nfendant’s criminal history, but contends that whether\nhis prior crimes occurred on occasions different from\none another represents a distinct type of inquiry that\nAlmendarez-Torres does not authorize the judge to make.\nAs to the substance of the ACCA inquiry, Elliott urges\nthis court to overrule its en banc decision in Hudspeth,\na step that he believes would pave the way to recogni-\ntion that the three burglaries he committed in 1998\nwere indivisible components of a single, multi-day\ncrime spree and thus were not committed on occasions\ndifferent from one another. Both arguments present\nquestions of law that we review de novo.

Thus, unless and until the Supreme\nCourt overrules Almendarez-Torres or confines its holding\nsolely to the fact of a prior conviction, as opposed to the\nnature and/or sequence of a defendant’s prior crimes,\na district judge properly may make the findings\nrequired by the ACCA.\n  Hudspeth supplies the answer to the second question\npresented by Elliott’s appeal—whether the three\nburglaries he committed in 1998 occurred on\noccasions different from one another. Our discussion of\nthe different-occasions inquiry in Hudspeth began with\nthe recognition of widespread agreement among the\ncircuit courts that a defendant will be subject to the\nACCA enhancement “if each of [his] prior convictions\narose out of a ‘separate and distinct criminal episode.’ ” 42\nF.3d at 1019 (quoting United States v.

Factors relevant to that assessment include the\nnature of the crimes, the identities of the victims, and the\n\fNo. 11-2766                                               11\n\nlocations where the crimes took place. Id. We also recog-\nnized that the timing is a relevant consideration, but to\na limited extent: crimes that occur simultaneously will\nbe deemed to have occurred on a single occasion; but\nthe passage of even a small amount of time between\ncrimes—10 minutes in Schieman—may well suffice to\nseparate them for purposes of the ACCA. Id. at 1919-20.\nWhat really matters, we emphasized, is the opportunity\nof the perpetrator to terminate his wrongdoing. Id.\nat 1020. Thus, even when a defendant has committed\na multi-crime spree over a short period of time, each\noffense comprising the spree will be considered to have\noccurred on a separate occasion so long as the defendant\nat each step had the opportunity to stop and proceed\nno further. Id. (citing United States v. Brady, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602396\"><a href=\"/opinion/602396/united-states-v-michael-james-brady/\"><span class=\"volume\">988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n668-69 (6th Cir. 1993) (en banc)). When a defendant com-\nmits multiple crimes simultaneously—as when he robs\nmore than one person at the same time, or commits\nessentially one act that violates multiple criminal stat-\nutes—there is no dividing point between the offenses\nthat affords him the chance to desist from further\ncriminal activity. See id. at 1020, 1021. “In contrast, a\ndefendant who commits sequential crimes has the oppor-\ntunity at each and every turn to withdraw from his crimi-\nnal activity.” Id. at 1021. Therefore, we concluded, a\ncourt’s inquiry as to the timing of the prior offenses\n“is simple: were the crimes simultaneous or were they\nsequential?” Id. at 1021 (emphasis in original).\n  Having adopted that bright-line rule, our assessment\nof the prior crimes at issue in Hudspeth was straightfor-\nward. The defendant and his accomplices had committed\na series of three burglaries over a period of 36 minutes\n\f12                                                  No. 11-2766\n\nagainst three adjoining businesses in a strip mall: they\nhad first pried open the door of a dry cleaners, then\nused a sledgehammer to break through a wall separating\nthe cleaners from the donut shop next door, and from\nthere forced open a door connecting the donut shop\nwith an insurance company; along the way, they ran-\nsacked all three businesses. Because the defendant had\nburglarized the three businesses in sequence rather than\nsimultaneously, we deemed the burglaries to have oc-\ncurred on different occasions for purposes of the ACCA:\n     Entry into each successive business reflected a clear\n     and deliberate choice to commit a “distinct aggres-\n     sion,” [United States v.] Godinez, 998 F.2d [471] at\n     473 [(7th Cir. 1993)]. At any given point in time\n     during his crime spree, Hudspeth was free to cease\n     and desist from further criminal activity. He\n     instead chose to continue. Because of his three deci-\n     sions to enter each successive business, it is evident\n     that he intended “to engage in a separate criminal\n     episode.” [United States v.] Tisdale, 921 F.2d [1095] at\n     1099 [10th Cir. 1990)]; see also Godinez, 998 F.2d at 472\n     (“one crime hard on the heels of another can be a\n     ‘separate and distinct criminal episode,’ as Schieman\n     itself shows.”).\n42 F.3d at 1022.3\n\n\n3\n  Our understanding of the facts surrounding the burglaries\nat issue in Hudspeth rested to a significant extent on the\npolice reports regarding those burglaries. See 42 F.3d at 1018 &\nn.3. The Supreme Court’s subsequent decision in Shepard\n                                                   (continued...)\n\fNo. 11-2766                                                13\n\n  Hudspeth’s result and rationale leave no question that\nElliott’s three prior burglaries likewise occurred on dif-\nferent occasions. The burglaries involved different\nvictims and different homes, and they took place sequen-\ntially rather than simultaneously. Elliott, like Hudspeth,\nthus had an opportunity after each burglary to con-\ntemplate what he was doing and abandon his course\nof criminal conduct. Indeed, Elliott’s burglaries took\nplace over the course of five days—and one or more\ndays apart from one another—rather than over the\ncourse of 36 minutes, as was the case in Hudspeth.\nElliott thus had far more of an opportunity to change\ncourse and desist from wrongdoing than did Hudspeth.\nSee, e.g., United States v.

Moreover, we typically\nreserve reexamination of a precedent for a case in which\nabandoning that precedent would make a difference.\nE.g., Loomis v.

Here, as the district court implied when it observed\nthat Elliott’s prior burglaries would meet the ACCA’s\ndifferent-occasions test under the law of this or any\nother circuit, even setting aside Hudspeth, Elliott\nis unlikely to prevail in his contention that his prior\nburglaries constituted a single rather than multiple crimes.\n  The rationale of the dissents in Hudspeth is illuminating\nin this regard. Both dissents were critical of the bright-\nline rule distinguishing simultaneous crimes from sequen-\ntial ones. 42 F.3d at 1026-27 (Flaum, J., concurring in\npart and dissenting in part); id. at 1035, 1037 (Ripple, J.,\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part). Both argued\nfor a less rigid approach that would allow more\npragmatic judgments in examining a set of prior crimes\nto determine whether they should be treated as sepa-\nrate or distinct criminal episodes. Judge Flaum sug-\ngested that “a nuanced, fact-based approach better\nresolves how many occasions are encompassed within a\nparticular course of conduct.” Id. at 1027. Judge Ripple\nobserved that the court’s adoption of a bright-line test\nconstituted a departure from its prior decisions in this\narea, which “ha[d] reflected a thoughtful and measured\napproach to the task required by the statute—identifying\n\f16                                              No. 11-2766\n\nthose criminals whose repetitive behavior requires a\nspecial degree of isolation from society.” Id. at 1035; see\nalso id. at 1037. He argued that “[f]actors of time and\ndistance must be evaluated in terms of the legislative\nintent in order to identify and segregate the true recidi-\nvist.” Id. at 1036. Looking at the facts in Hudspeth\nthrough that lens, Judge Ripple concluded that the\nseries of three burglaries should be treated as a single\nepisode:\n     In a very short period of time, Mr. Hudspeth and his\n     accomplices, with a sledgehammer and other tools,\n     broke into three adjoining businesses in one location\n     and ransacked them. Their arrival with such tools\n     designed to expedite the penetration of the walls\n     between the adjacent businesses reflects a clear plan\n     for the group to work together to break through\n     from one business to another. This venture did not\n     comprise “distinct aggressions,” [Godinez, 998 F.2d\n     at 473], but rather a singular, continuous course\n     of conduct that depended on the spatial proximity of\n     these stores. . . .\nId. Judge Flaum agreed:\n     I view the fact that Hudspeth and his partners\n     entered several attached but separate stores at sequen-\n     tial addresses, as opposed to, for example, several\n     departments of a single larger store, to be a mere\n     fortuity in these circumstances.\nId. at 1027.\n  It is worth pointing out that neither dissent signaled\nany disagreement with the holdings of pre-Hudspeth\n\fNo. 11-2766                                               17\n\ndecisions like Schieman and Godinez, which were given\nsignificant attention in the majority decision in Hudspeth\nand which treated crimes committed within a very\nshort time of one another as separate episodes for\npurposes of the ACCA.

Judge Ripple’s\ndissent, in fact, recognized that the sort of recidivism\nthat Congress meant to punish more severely when it\nenacted the ACCA “can be manifest in relatively short\ntime frames and in situations not far removed from\neach other,” and his dissent cited many cases to that\neffect. 42 F.3d at 1035 & n.20.\n  Instead, the dissenters believed that the majority’s error\nin Hudspeth lay in emphasizing the sequential nature of\na defendant’s criminal acts to the exclusion of other\ncircumstances suggesting that those acts ought to be\ntreated as part of a single criminal episode. Illustratively,\nJudge Ripple pointed out that under the majority’s\nsimultaneous-versus-sequential test, a defendant who\nenters a dwelling and shoots multiple people simulta-\nneously with one burst of automatic weapons fire\ncommits a single aggression, but if he then walks into\nanother room to shoot another person, he commits a\nsecond, distinct aggression. Id. at 1037. Judge Flaum\nsimilarly noted that the majority’s way at looking\nat sequencing attributed artificial importance to\n\f18                                                 No. 11-2766\n\nfortuitous circumstances: thus, in Hudspeth, the sequen-\ntial burglaries of adjoining but separate businesses\nwere treated as distinct criminal episodes, whereas\nan unlawful entry into a single business, and the\nensuing break-in into several locked offices within that\nbusiness, would be deemed one criminal episode. Id.\nat 1026.\n  Overruling Hudspeth would remove just one of the\nobstacles to Elliott’s position. It would do away with\nHudspeth’s bright-line rule and leave room for the\nmore nuanced judgments for which the dissenters in\nthat case advocated. If the facts underlying Elliott’s\nthree prior burglaries were comparable to those at issue\nin Hudspeth, the door might be open to Elliott’s con-\ntention that his prior burglaries constituted one criminal\nepisode for purposes of the ACCA. But Elliott did not\nburglarize, one right after the other, three business\nin the same mall or three adjoining townhouses. He\nburglarized three different residences on different\ndays.4 Even with Hudspeth cleared from his path, Elliott\nstill would have to contend with a wealth of authority,\nincluding precedents like Schieman and Godinez, which\ntreat crimes committed at different locations and at\ndifferent times—even when separated only by a matter\n\n\n\n4\n  Elliott’s counsel informs us, although this fact is not in the\nrecord, that each of the residences Elliott burglarized were\napartments essentially in the same complex. Even so, it is\nclear from the record Elliott did not burglarize the apart-\nments seriatim on the same day.\n\fNo. 11-2766                                                  19\n\nof minutes or hours—as distinct for purposes of the\nACCA.

But on that view, even a long\nstring of crimes, committed over a much greater\nexpanse of time than Elliott’s burglaries were, could be\nconstrued as a single criminal episode. An addiction to\ndrugs or alcohol, for example, may be at the root of crimi-\nnal behavior that spans years rather than days. (Elliott’s\nown addiction to multiple narcotics appears to have\nplagued him for a substantial period of his life.) There\nmight be some sense in treating a series of crimes as\nessentially one, indivisible episode, particularly when\nthe crimes occurred in a discrete part of the defendant’s\npast and are explained by something like an addiction\nthat the defendant later overcame. The district judge in\nthis case himself entertained “long thoughts” about\nhow Elliott’s prior burglaries were best characterized.\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3273466</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *1; R. 18-2 at 20.\n\fNo. 11-2766                                               21\n\n  Nonetheless, it is difficult to reconcile Elliott’s theory\nwith the language that the ACCA uses. The statute\nrefers to crimes “committed on occasions different from\none another.” § 924(e)(1).
