The four\n\n31   actions presently before this Court allege that numerous\n\n32   major financial institutions aided and abetted the fraud,\n\n33   collecting steep fees while ignoring blatant warning signs.\n\n34   In summary, the complaints allege that, when the Defendants\n\n35   were confronted with evidence of Madoff’s illegitimate\n\n\n                                    6\n\f1    scheme, their banking fees gave incentive to look away, or\n\n2    at least caused a failure to perform due diligence that\n\n3    would have revealed the fraud.    The Trustee asserts claims\n\n4    for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and\n\n5    abetting fraud, and negligence, among others.    The Trustee’s\n\n6    position is supported by the Securities Investor Protection\n\n7    Corporation (“SIPC”), a statutorily created nonprofit\n\n8    corporation consisting of registered broker-dealers and\n\n9    members of national securities exchanges, which intervened\n\n10   to recover some or all of the approximately $800 million it\n\n11   advanced to victims.\n\n12       As we will explain, the doctrine of in pari delicto\n\n13   bars the Trustee (who stands in Madoff’s shoes) from\n\n14   asserting claims directly against the Defendants on behalf\n\n15   of the estate for wrongdoing in which Madoff (to say the\n\n16   least) participated.   The claim for contribution is likewise\n\n17   unfounded, as SIPA provides no such right.    The decisive\n\n18   issue, then, is whether the Trustee has standing to pursue\n\n19   the common law claims on behalf of Madoff’s customers.       Two\n\n20   thorough well-reasoned opinions by the district courts held\n\n21   that he does not.   See Picard v. HSBC Bank PLC, 454 B.R. 25\n\n22   (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (Rakoff, J.); Picard v. JPMorgan Chase &\n\n23   Co., 460 B.R. 84 (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (McMahon, J.).\n\n                                   7\n\f1        Our holding relies on a rooted principle of standing: A\n\n2    party must “assert his own legal rights and interests, and\n\n3    cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or\n\n4    interests of third parties.”     Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490,\n\n5    499 (1975).    This prudential limitation has been\n\n6    consistently applied in the bankruptcy context to bar suits\n\n7    brought by trustees on behalf of creditors.     See, e.g.,\n\n8    Caplin v. Marine Midland Grace Trust Co., 406 U.S. 416\n\n9    (1972); Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc. v. Wagoner, 944 F.2d\n\n10   114, 118 (2d Cir. 1991).\n\n11       Picard offers two theories for why a SIPA liquidation\n\n12   is a different creature entirely, and why therefore a SIPA\n\n13   trustee enjoys third-party standing: (1) He is acting as a\n\n14   bailee of customer property and therefore can pursue actions\n\n15   on customers’ behalf to recover such property; and (2) he is\n\n16   enforcing SIPC’s rights of equitable and statutory\n\n17   subrogation to recoup funds advanced to Madoff’s customers.\n\n18   Neither is compelling.     Although a SIPA liquidation is not a\n\n19   traditional bankruptcy, a SIPA trustee is vested with the\n\n20   “same powers and title with respect to the debtor and the\n\n21   property of the debtor . . . as a trustee in a case under\n\n22   Title 11.”    15 U.S.C. § 78fff-1(a).   At best, SIPA is silent\n\n\n\n                                     8\n\f1    as to the questions presented here.    And analogies to the\n\n2    law of bailment and the law of subrogation are inapt and\n\n3    unconvincing.1\n\n4\n\n5                              BACKGROUND\n\n6        In December 2008, federal agents arrested Bernard L.\n\n7    Madoff, who had conducted the largest Ponzi scheme yet\n\n8    uncovered.   Madoff purported to employ a “split-strike\n\n9    conversion strategy” that involved buying S&P 100 stocks and\n\n10   hedging through the use of options.    In reality, he engaged\n\n11   in no securities transactions at all.2\n\n12\n\n\n          1\n            The Defendants also argue that the Trustee has not\n     met constitutional standing requirements, violates the\n     Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, and fails to\n     plead with particularity SIPC’s purported subrogation\n     claims. Given our holding, we decline to address these\n     arguments.\n          2\n             Although Madoff simply appropriated his clients’\n     money without ever purchasing securities on their behalf, we\n     have held that Madoff’s victims are nonetheless “customers”\n     under the Act. See In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec. LLC,\n     654 F.3d 229, 236 (2d Cir. 2011) (“SIPA . . . ensur[es] that\n     claimants who deposited cash with a broker for the purpose\n     of purchasing securities, are treated as customers with\n     claims for securities. This is so because the critical\n     aspect of the ‘customer’ definition is the entrustment of\n     cash or securities to the broker-dealer for the purposes of\n     trading securities.”) (internal citations and quotation\n     marks omitted), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 25 (2012).\n                                   9\n\f1        In March 2009, Madoff pleaded guilty to securities\n\n2    fraud and admitted that he had used his brokerage firm,\n\n3    Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (“BLMIS”), as a\n\n4    vast Ponzi scheme.       The details of Madoff’s fraud have been\n\n5    recounted many times.       See, e.g., In re Bernard L. Madoff\n\n6    Inv. Sec. LLC, 654 F.3d 229, 231-32 (2d Cir. 2011), cert.\n\n7    denied, 133 S. Ct. 25 (2012); In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv.\n\n8    Sec. LLC, 424 B.R. 122, 126–32 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010).\n\n9        Following Madoff’s arrest, SIPC filed an application\n\n10   under SIPA, 15 U.S.C. § 78eee(a)(4)(B), asserting that BLMIS\n\n11   required protection.       The district court appointed Picard as\n\n12   the firm’s Trustee and referred the case to the bankruptcy\n\n13   court.\n\n14       SIPA was enacted in 1970 to speed the distribution of\n\n15   “customer property” back to investors following a firm’s\n\n16   collapse.3      Customer property is cash and securities held\n\n17   separately from the general estate of the failed brokerage\n\n18   firm.       “SIPA serves dual purposes: to protect investors, and\n\n19   to protect the securities market as a whole.”       In re Bernard\n\n20   L. Madoff Inv. Sec. LLC, 654 F.3d at 235.       A SIPA\n\n\n             3\n            For a succinct overview of the statute’s history, see\n     Securities Investor Protection Corp. v. BDO Seidman, LLP, 49\n     F. Supp. 2d 644, 649 (S.D.N.Y. 1999).\n                                       10\n\f1    liquidation confers priority on customer claims by an\n\n2    expeditious alternative to a traditional bankruptcy\n\n3    proceeding.   Under SIPA, each customer shares ratably in the\n\n4    fund of customer property according to the customer’s “net\n\n5    equity.”\n\n6        If (as is often the case) the assets are not enough to\n\n7    satisfy all net equity claims, SIPC advances money (up to\n\n8    $500,000 per customer) to the SIPA trustee, who is charged\n\n9    with assessing customer claims and making the ratable\n\n10   distributions.   At the time of this appeal, SIPC had\n\n11   advanced approximately $800 million.\n\n12       A trustee also has authority to investigate the\n\n13   circumstances surrounding the insolvency and to recover and\n\n14   distribute any remaining funds to creditors.    Picard alleges\n\n15   that his investigation has uncovered evidence of wrongdoing\n\n16   by third parties who aided and abetted Madoff, and seeks to\n\n17   replenish the fund of customer property by taking action\n\n18   against various financial institutions that serviced BLMIS.\n\n19       Picard presses claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS\n\n20   AG, UniCredit Bank Austria AG, HSBC Bank plc, and affiliated\n\n21   persons and entities.    The allegations against each are\n\n22   summarized one by one.    We distill the detailed allegations\n\n\n\n                                    11\n\f1    from the consolidated complaints, and recount only the\n\n2    background needed to understand our analysis.    At this stage\n\n3    of the litigation, the allegations are assumed to be true.\n\n4    See Selevan v. N.Y. Thruway Auth., 584 F.3d 82, 88 (2d Cir.\n\n5    2009).\n\n6        JPMorgan.    Madoff maintained a checking account at\n\n7    JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan”)4 for more than twenty\n\n8    years, beginning in 1986.    In the years prior to BLMIS’s\n\n9    bankruptcy, JPMorgan collected an estimated half billion\n\n10   dollars in fees, interest payments, and revenue from BLMIS.\n\n11   The Trustee alleges that JPMorgan was “at the very center”\n\n12   of Madoff’s fraud and was “thoroughly complicit” in it.      A\n\n13   662 ¶ 1.5   Madoff’s primary account with JPMorgan, the “703\n\n14   Account,” was where hundreds of billions of dollars of\n\n15   customer money were “commingled and ultimately washed.”      A\n\n16   663 ¶ 2.    The customer funds deposited into the 703 Account\n\n17   for “split-strike” securities transactions were instead\n\n18   funneled to other customers to sustain the illusion of large\n\n19   and reliable returns on investment.\n\n          4\n            Throughout this brief, “JPMorgan” refers to the four\n     JPMorgan defendants: JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase\n     Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and J.P. Morgan\n     Securities Ltd.\n          5\n            Record citations refer to the joint appendix filed in\n     the action under discussion.\n                                    12\n\f1        The 703 Account was a retail checking account, not a\n\n2    commercial account.     Billions of dollars from thousands of\n\n3    investors were deposited without being segregated or\n\n4    transferred to separate sub-accounts.        These accounts\n\n5    exhibited, on their face, a “glaring absence of securities\n\n6    activity.”     A 714 ¶ 190.     At the same time, numerous multi-\n\n7    million-dollar checks and wire transfers having no apparent\n\n8    business purpose were exchanged between Madoff and his close\n\n9    friend, Norman Levy (now dead).\n\n10       In 2006, due diligence conducted by JPMorgan revealed\n\n11   strong and steady yields by Madoff’s feeder funds during a\n\n12   time when the S&P 100 dropped thirty percent.        As one money\n\n13   manager later acknowledged, that was too good to be true.\n\n14   In June 2007, JPMorgan’s Chief Risk Officer John Hogan\n\n15   learned at a lunch with JPMorgan money manager Matt Zames\n\n16   that “there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff\n\n17   and that his returns are speculated to be part of a [P]onzi\n\n18   scheme.”     A 695 ¶ 119.     Hogan asked a junior analyst to run\n\n19   a Google search on Madoff, and made no further inquiries\n\n20   when the search yielded no hard evidence.\n\n21       Faced with “numerous indications of Madoff’s fraud,” in\n\n22   the fall of 2008 JPMorgan redeemed $276 million of its\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f1    investments in Madoff’s feeder funds.     A 705 ¶¶ 156-60; A\n\n2    710 ¶ 178.   But the company failed to tip off regulators or\n\n3    other investors.   Though JPMorgan was uniquely positioned to\n\n4    put an end to Madoff’s fraud, it quietly continued\n\n5    collecting its large fees.\n\n6        UBS and Access.   Defendants UBS AG6 (“UBS”) and Access\n\n7    International Advisors LLC7 (“Access”) are sued for aiding\n\n8    and abetting Madoff’s fraud by creating feeder funds and\n\n9    collecting investments from abroad.     UBS acted as sponsor,\n\n10   manager, administrator, custodian, and primary banker of the\n\n11   funds.   UBS reaped at least $80 million in fees as it\n\n12   facilitated investments in BLMIS, despite clear indicia of\n\n13   fraud.   The “prestigious name” of UBS was used “to\n\n14   legitimize and attract money to Madoff’s fraud,” but UBS\n\n          6\n            “UBS” includes UBS AG, UBS (Luxembourg) S.A., UBS\n     Fund Services (Luxembourg) S.A., UBS Third Party Management\n     Company S.A., Roger Hartmann, Ralf Schroter, Rene Egger,\n     Bernd Stiehl, Alain Hondequin, and Hermann Kranz.\n          7\n            “Access” includes Access International Advisors LLC,\n     Access International Advisors Europe Limited, Access\n     International Advisors Ltd., Access Partners (Suisse) S.A.,\n     Access Management Luxembourg S.A., Access Partners S.A.,\n     Patrick Littaye, Claudine Magnon de la Villehuchet (in her\n     capacities as Executrix and sole beneficiary of the Will of\n     Thierry Magnon de la Villehuchet), Pierre Delandmeter, and\n     Theodore Dumbauld. The Trustee also sues feeder funds\n     created by UBS and Access such as Defendants Luxalpha SICA V\n     and Groupement.\n\n\n                                   14\n\f1    agreed to “look the other way and to pretend that they were\n\n2    truly ensuring the existence of assets and trades when in\n\n3    fact they were not and never did.”     A 916 ¶ 5.\n\n4        UBS observed but ignored Madoff’s lack of transparency\n\n5    and his uncanny ability to generate consistently high\n\n6    returns, except insofar as UBS declined to invest its own\n\n7    money in BLMIS or endorse Madoff’s funds to its clients.\n\n8    In 2009, the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de\n\n9    Surveillance du Secteur Financier, indicated that the\n\n10   failure of UBS to identify Madoff as a possible fraud was a\n\n11   violation of Luxembourg law.\n\n12       Access was also alerted to Madoff’s suspicious\n\n13   investment activities.     In 2006, internal managers at Access\n\n14   became worried about the volume of options trades being\n\n15   reported by Madoff, and hired an independent consultant to\n\n16   investigate.     The consultant concluded that Madoff could not\n\n17   possibly have executed the volume of options or equities\n\n18   trades he reported, and that his trading revealed “either\n\n19   extremely sloppy errors or serious omissions” that suggest\n\n20   he “doesn’t really understand the costs of the option\n\n21   strategy.”     A 977 ¶ 218 (emphasis removed).   Access\n\n22   concealed the consultant’s findings and continued active\n\n\n                                     15\n\f1    recruitment of investors for Madoff’s feeder funds in order\n\n2    to keep churning its fees.\n\n3        Unicredit.     Madoff’s fraud drew billions from abroad.\n\n4    With the help of UniCredit Bank Austria AG (“Bank Austria”)\n\n5    and 20:20 Medici AG (“Bank Medici”), one Sonja Kohn\n\n6    established several Madoff feeder funds (the “Medici\n\n7    Funds”).     Together, they funneled nearly $3 billion into\n\n8    BLMIS.     UniCredit S.p.A. and its two subsidiaries, Pioneer\n\n9    Alternative Investment Management Limited (“Pioneer”) and\n\n10   Bank Austria (collectively, the “UniCredit entities”),\n\n11   helped to promote the Medici Funds and thereby facilitated\n\n12   the fraud.\n\n13       The UniCredit entities and their affiliates made a lot\n\n14   of money servicing the Medici funds: Bank Medici took more\n\n15   than $15 million in fees; and BA Worldwide, more than $68\n\n16   million.     The UniCredit entities were well aware that\n\n17   Madoff’s returns were highly suspicious, and that the extent\n\n18   of BLMIS’s trading activities was facially impossible.        Yet\n\n19   they continued to aggressively market the Madoff feeder\n\n20   funds to new customers while purporting to provide\n\n21   oversight.     Among the signs overlooked by the UniCredit\n\n22   entities were Madoff’s failure to identify counterparties to\n\n\n                                     16\n\f1    BLMIS’s options transactions, BLMIS’s atypical fee\n\n2    structure, and Madoff’s impossibly high volume of\n\n3    transactions.   Shortly after Madoff’s arrest, a senior\n\n4    research analyst at Pioneer wrote, “[w]e should be the\n\n5    professionals protecting investors from this fraud . . .\n\n6    [but] there is not one [due diligence] report in the files\n\n7    except for one in May 2005.”   A 136 ¶ 314 (brackets in\n\n8    original).\n\n9        HSBC.    HSBC Bank plc (“HSBC”)8 established Madoff\n\n10   feeder funds (at least eighteen in seven different\n\n11   countries) that injected capital into the Ponzi scheme while\n\n12   ignoring obvious warning signs.     As custodian and\n\n13   administrator of the funds, HSBC was required to hold the\n\n14   fund assets and handle day-to-day operations.     HSBC also\n\n15   created derivative products, such as notes and swaps, to\n\n16   increase the flow of investment.     These funds fed at least\n\n\n\n          8\n            The HSBC Defendants include HSBC Bank plc, HSBC\n     Holdings plc, HSBC Securities Services (Luxembourg) S.A.,\n     HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Ireland) Limited, HSBC\n     Securities Services (Ireland) Limited, HSBC Institutional\n     Trust Services (Bermuda) Limited, HSBC Bank USA, N.A., HSBC\n     Securities Services (Bermuda) Limited, HSBC Bank (Cayman)\n     Limited, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) S.A., HSBC\n     Private Bank (Suisse) S.A., HSBC Fund Services (Luxembourg)\n     S.A., and HSBC Bank Bermuda Limited.\n\n\n                                    17\n\f1    $8.9 billion into Madoff’s scheme, a sum representing nearly\n\n2    forty percent of BLMIS’s capital under management.\n\n3        HSBC represented to customers that it exercised\n\n4    supervision and control over fund assets, whereas BLMIS\n\n5    itself took the role of custodian.      Had HSBC performed\n\n6    oversight diligently, it would have seen thousands of\n\n7    instances in which Madoff’s purported trades exceeded the\n\n8    total market volume of such trades on the given day.\n\n9    Repeatedly, industry analysts and HSBC’s own due diligence\n\n10   team openly questioned Madoff’s extraordinary success, lack\n\n11   of transparency, and incredible trading volume.\n\n12       In September 2005, HSBC commissioned KPMG LLP to detect\n\n13   potential fraud in BLMIS’s operations.      Resulting reports in\n\n14   2006 and 2008 warned that BLMIS’s role as custodian of its\n\n15   own funds posed a risk that the trades were “a sham in order\n\n16   to divert client cash.”   A 89 ¶ 168.     Nonetheless, HSBC\n\n17   continued to “enable[]” Madoff in order to reap a windfall.\n\n18   A 35 ¶ 1.   In sum, HSBC “engineered a labyrinth of hedge\n\n19   funds, management companies, and service providers that, to\n\n20   unsuspecting outsiders, seemed to compose a formidable\n\n21   system of checks and balances,” yet, in reality, “it\n\n22   provided different modes for directing money to Madoff while\n\n23   avoiding scrutiny and maximizing fees.”      A 36 ¶ 4.\n\n                                   18\n\f1        Procedural History.    On July 15, 2009, the Trustee\n\n2    commenced an adversary proceeding in the United States\n\n3    Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York\n\n4    against HSBC and thirty-six others, including UniCredit and\n\n5    Pioneer.9   The Amended Complaint sought recovery of $2\n\n6    billion in preferential or fraudulent transfers (Counts 1\n\n7    through 19), and asserted four common law causes of action:\n\n8    aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of\n\n9    fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and money had and\n\n10   received (collectively, the “common law claims”).   These\n\n11   common law claims sought $6.6 billion from HSBC and $2\n\n12   billion from the remaining defendants.   A contribution claim\n\n13   was asserted under New York law.\n\n14       On a motion by the UniCredit entities, the district\n\n15   court withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court, for\n\n16   the limited purpose of deciding two threshold issues: (1)\n\n17   the Trustee’s standing to assert the common law claims, and\n\n18   (2) preemption of these claims by the Securities Litigation\n\n19   Uniform Standards Act (“SLUSA”).\n\n20       The common law claims and the contribution claim were\n\n21   dismissed by Judge Rakoff in July 2011, on the grounds that\n\n\n          9\n            This proceeding consolidated two actions, one against\n     HSBC and one against UniCredit and Pioneer.\n                                   19\n\f1    the Trustee was in pari delicto with the defendants, lacked\n\n2    standing to assert the common law claims on customers’\n\n3    behalf, and could not demonstrate a right to contribution.\n\n4    See Picard v. HSBC Bank PLC, 454 B.R. 25, 37 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n5    2011).    The court did not reach the question whether SLUSA\n\n6    bars the Trustee’s claims.    Id.\n\n7        The Trustee’s adversary proceeding against JPMorgan was\n\n8    commenced in December 2010.    As in the proceedings against\n\n9    HSBC and UniCredit, the Trustee asserted common law claims\n\n10   seeking $19 billion for, inter alia, aiding and abetting\n\n11   fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust\n\n12   enrichment, and conversion.\n\n13       The adversary proceeding against UBS followed.    Also\n\n14   named were Access, several of its affiliates, and two feeder\n\n15   funds.    Again, the Trustee asserted common law claims for\n\n16   aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of\n\n17   fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and conversion, among\n\n18   others.    Damages of approximately $2 billion were sought on\n\n19   behalf of the customers of BLMIS (rather than BLMIS itself).\n\n20       All Defendants (except Luxalpha and two individual\n\n21   Defendants) moved to dismiss the common law claims and the\n\n22   contribution claim.    In November 2011, Judge McMahon granted\n\n23   the motions.    See Picard v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 460 B.R.\n\n                                    20\n\f1    84 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).     Judge McMahon concluded (as did Judge\n\n2    Rakoff) that the Trustee lacks standing to bring an action\n\n3    on behalf of third parties and has no valid claim for\n\n4    contribution.     Id. at 106.\n\n5                                DISCUSSION\n\n6        We review de novo a district court’s dismissal of\n\n7    causes of action for failure to state a claim for relief or\n\n8    lack of standing.     See Fulton v. Goord, 591 F.3d 37, 41 (2d\n\n9    Cir. 2009).     Point I considers the Trustee’s claims as\n\n10   asserted by him on behalf of BLMIS itself; Point II\n\n11   considers claims asserted by the Trustee on behalf of\n\n12   BLMIS’s customers.\n\n13                                   I\n\n14       We agree with the district courts that the Trustee’s\n\n15   common law claims asserted on behalf of BLMIS are barred by\n\n16   the doctrine of in pari delicto.\n\n17                                   A\n\n18       Under New York law,10 one wrongdoer may not recover\n\n19   against another.     See Kirschner v. KPMG LLP, 938 N.E.2d 941,\n\n\n          10\n            “In a bankruptcy proceeding, state law . . .\n     determines whether a right to sue belongs to the debtor or\n     to the individual creditors.” Wight v. BankAmerica Corp.,\n     219 F.3d 79, 86 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation and internal\n     quotation marks omitted). New York law governs here.\n                                     21\n\f1    950 (N.Y. 2010).   The principle that a wrongdoer should not\n\n2    profit from his own misconduct “is . . . strong in New\n\n3    York.”   Id. at 964.   The New York Appellate Division, First\n\n4    Department, has long applied the doctrine of in pari delicto\n\n5    to bar a debtor from suing third parties for a fraud in\n\n6    which he participated.   See Barnes v. Hirsch, 212 N.Y.S.\n\n7    536, 539 (App. Div. 1st Dep’t 1925) (“The bankrupts could\n\n8    not recover against these defendants for bucketing orders\n\n9    because they were responsible for the illegal transaction\n\n10   and parties to the fraud.”), aff’d, 152 N.E. 424 (N.Y.\n\n11   1926).\n\n12       A “claim against a third party for defrauding a\n\n13   corporation with the cooperation of management accrues to\n\n14   creditors, not to the guilty corporation.”    Shearson Lehman\n\n15   Hutton, Inc. v. Wagoner, 944 F.2d 114, 120 (2d Cir. 1991)\n\n16   (citing Barnes, 212 N.Y.S. at 537).    The debtor’s misconduct\n\n17   is imputed to the trustee because, innocent as he may be, he\n\n18   acts as the debtor’s representative.    See Wight v.\n\n19   BankAmerica Corp., 219 F.3d 79, 87 (2d Cir. 2000)\n\n20   (“[B]ecause a trustee stands in the shoes of the\n\n21   corporation, the Wagoner rule bars a trustee from suing to\n\n22   recover for a wrong that he himself essentially took part\n\n\n                                    22\n\f1    in.”); accord Breeden v. Kirkpatrick & Lockhart LLP (In re\n\n2    Bennett Funding Grp., Inc.), 336 F.3d 94, 99-100 (2d Cir.\n\n3    2003) (applying Wagoner rule in the context of “the greatest\n\n4    Ponzi scheme [then] on record” and holding that “the\n\n5    defrauded investors and not the bankruptcy trustee” were\n\n6    entitled to pursue malpractice claims against attorneys and\n\n7    accountants arising from the fraud).11\n\n8        Picard alleges that the Defendants were complicit in\n\n9    Madoff’s fraud and facilitated his Ponzi scheme by providing\n\n10   (well-paid) financial services while ignoring obvious\n\n11   warning signs.   These claims fall squarely within the rule\n\n12   of Wagoner and the ensuing cases: Picard stands in the shoes\n\n13   of BLMIS and may not assert claims against third parties for\n\n14   participating in a fraud that BLMIS orchestrated.\n\n15\n\n\n          11\n            See also Kirschner v. Grant Thornton LLP, No. 07\n     Civ. 11604 (GEL), 2009 WL 1286326, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14,\n     2009) (applying Wagoner rule to dismiss fraud and breach of\n     fiduciary claims where the debtor “participated in, and\n     benefitted from, the very wrong for which it seeks to\n     recover”), aff’d, 626 F.3d 673 (2d Cir. 2010); Hirsch v.\n     Arthur Andersen & Co., 72 F.3d 1085, 1094-95 (2d Cir. 1995)\n     (holding that even though “there [was] at least a\n     theoretical possibility that some independent financial\n     injury to the Debtors might be established,” the Wagoner\n     rule precluded standing “because of the Debtors’\n     collaboration with the defendants-appellees in promulgating\n     and promoting the Colonial Ponzi schemes”).\n                                   23\n\f1         Picard’s scattershot responses are resourceful, but\n\n2    they all miss the mark.   He contends that a SIPA trustee is\n\n3    exempt from the Wagoner rule, but adduces no authority.      He\n\n4    argues that the rationale of the in pari delicto doctrine is\n\n5    not served here because he himself is not a wrongdoer; but\n\n6    neither were the trustees in the cases cited above.12   He\n\n7    contends that in pari delicto should not impede the\n\n8    enforcement of securities laws, citing Bateman Eichler, Hill\n\n9    Richards, Inc. v. Berner, 472 U.S. 299 (1985); but Bateman\n\n10   Eichler is inapposite.    See id. at 315-16 (holding that in\n\n11   pari delicto would not prevent defrauded tippee from\n\n12   bringing suit against defrauding tipper, at least absent\n\n13   further inquiry into “relative culpabilities” of tippee and\n\n14   tipper).13   He invokes the “adverse interest” exception,\n\n          12\n            Relatedly, he argues that in a typical bankruptcy in\n     pari delicto is designed to bar corporate malefactors,\n     including shareholders, from recovering, whereas in a SIPA\n     liquidation the trustee marshals assets for the benefit of\n     the customer property estate. Accordingly, there is no\n     similar concern here that funds collected by the trustee\n     would be distributed to wrongdoers. But, in Kirschner v.\n     KPMG LLP, the New York Court of Appeals declined to make an\n     exception to the in pari delicto doctrine despite the\n     trustee’s urging that proceeds would “benefit blameless\n     unsecured creditors . . . and shareholders.” Kirschner v.\n     KPMG LLP, 938 N.E.2d 941, 958 (N.Y. 2010).\n          13\n            Like the Supreme Court in Bateman Eichler, we\n     recently declined to apply in pari delicto to bar suit in a\n     private civil antitrust action, “where private actions play\n                                    24\n\f1   which directs a court not to impute to a corporation the bad\n\n2   acts of its agent when the fraud was committed for personal\n\n3   benefit.   See The Mediators, Inc. v. Manney (In re\n\n4   Mediators, Inc.), 105 F.3d 822, 827 (2d Cir. 1997).\n\n5   However, “this most narrow of exceptions” is reserved for\n\n6   cases of “outright theft or looting or embezzlement . . .\n\n7   where the fraud is committed against a corporation rather\n\n8   than on its behalf.”14   Kirschner v. KPMG LLP, 938 N.E.2d\n\n9   941, 952 (N.Y. 2010).    It is not possible thus to separate\n\n\n\n    a significant role in the enforcement scheme.” Gatt\n    Commc’ns, Inc. v. PMC Assocs., L.L.C., 711 F.3d 68, 80 (2d\n    Cir. 2013) (dismissing action on threshold question of\n    antitrust standing). Here, in contrast, barring claims\n    brought by Madoff’s successor-in-interest would not preclude\n    his victims from bringing suit individually. See infra p.\n    58 n.29. In pari delicto does not apply to all wrongdoers;\n    the doctrine targets those who “actively participate in the\n    illegal scheme and who are substantially at fault.” Gatt\n    Commc’ns, 711 F.3d at 84 (Wesley, J., concurring). The\n    pleadings here leave us with no doubt that BLMIS--in whose\n    shoes the Trustee stands--bore at least “substantially equal\n    responsibility” for the injuries the Trustee now seeks to\n    redress. See Bateman Eichler, 472 U.S. at 310-11.\n    Accordingly, application of the rule in this context is well\n    established. See, e.g., Wagoner, 944 F.2d at 120; Wight,\n    219 F.3d at 87.\n         14\n           When, as here, principal and agent are “one and the\n    same . . . the adverse interest exception is itself subject\n    to an exception styled the ‘sole actor’ rule,” which\n    “imputes the agent’s knowledge to the principal\n    notwithstanding the agent’s self-dealing.” In re Mediators,\n    Inc., 105 F.3d at 827.\n\n\n                                   25\n\f1    BLMIS from Madoff himself and his scheme.    Finally, Picard\n\n2    argues that the district courts should not have applied the\n\n3    in pari delicto doctrine at the pleadings stage; but the New\n\n4    York Court of Appeals has held otherwise.    See id. at 947\n\n5    n.3; see also Wagoner, 944 F.2d at 120.     Early resolution is\n\n6    appropriate where (as here) the outcome is plain on the face\n\n7    of the pleadings.\n\n8                                 B.\n\n9        The Trustee’s claim for contribution is the only one\n\n10   that may escape the bar of in pari delicto.     See Barrett v.\n\n11   United States, 853 F.2d 124, 127 n.3 (2d Cir. 1988)\n\n12   (explaining that parties seeking contribution are\n\n13   necessarily in pari delicto).15   The Trustee seeks\n\n14   contribution for payments made to BLMIS customers under\n\n15   SIPA, on the theory that the Defendants are joint\n\n16   tortfeasors with BLMIS under New York law.\n\n17\n\n\n          15\n            Some courts have suggested that Wagoner nevertheless\n     bars a contribution claim. See, e.g., Devon Mobile Commc’ns\n     Liquidating Trust v. Adelphia Commc’ns Corp. (In re Adelphia\n     Commc’ns Corp.), 322 B.R. 509, 529 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2005);\n     Silverman v. Meister Seelig & Fein, LLP (In re Agape World,\n     Inc.), 467 B.R. 556, 580-81 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2012). We need\n     not decide whether such a claim would survive a Wagoner\n     challenge because, as explained in text, there is no\n     contribution right under SIPA.\n                                  26\n\f1           The New York statute provides that “two or more persons\n\n2    who are subject to liability for damages for the same\n\n3    personal injury, injury to property or wrongful death, may\n\n4    claim contribution among them whether or not an action has\n\n5    been brought or a judgment has been rendered against the\n\n6    person from whom contribution is sought.”    N.Y. C.P.L.R.\n\n7    § 1401 (McKinney).    Section 1401 “requires some form of\n\n8    compulsion; that is, the party seeking contribution must\n\n9    have been compelled in some way, such as through the entry\n\n10   of a judgment, to make the payment against which\n\n11   contribution is sought.”    N.Y. State Elec. & Gas Corp. v.\n\n12   FirstEnergy Corp., No. 3:03-CV-0438 (DEP), 2007 WL 1434901,\n\n13   at *7 (N.D.N.Y. May 11, 2007) (emphasis added).\n\n14          However, the SIPA payments for which Picard seeks\n\n15   contribution were not compelled by BLMIS’s state law fraud\n\n16   liability to its customers; his obligation to pay customers\n\n17   their ratable share of customer property is an obligation of\n\n18   federal law: SIPA.    SIPA provides no right to contribution,\n\n19   and it is settled in this Circuit that there is no claim for\n\n20   contribution unless the operative federal statute provides\n\n21   one.    See Nw. Airlines, Inc. v. Transp. Workers Union of\n\n22   Am., AFL-CIO, 451 U.S. 77, 97 n.38, 97-99 (1981); see also\n\n\n                                    27\n\f1    Herman v. RSR Sec. Servs. Ltd., 172 F.3d 132, 144 (2d Cir.\n\n2    1999) (affirming dismissal of New York state law\n\n3    contribution claims for liability under the Fair Labor\n\n4    Standards Act); KBL Corp. v. Arnouts, 646 F. Supp. 2d 335,\n\n5    341 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“[A] plaintiff cannot use New York\n\n6    State common law as an end-around to make a claim for\n\n7    contribution that it could not make under the federal\n\n8    statutory scheme.”); Lehman Bros., Inc. v. Wu, 294 F. Supp.\n\n9    2d 504, 505 n.1 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (“[W]hether contribution is\n\n10   available in connection with a federal statutory scheme is a\n\n11   question governed solely by federal law.”) (citation and\n\n12   quotation marks omitted).\n\n13       Picard emphasizes that he is not seeking contribution\n\n14   for violations of SIPA or any other federal statute, but\n\n15   that is beside the point.   “The source of a right of\n\n16   contribution under state law must be an obligation imposed\n\n17   by state law.”   LNC Invs., Inc. v. First Fid. Bank, 935 F.\n\n18   Supp. 1333, 1349 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (emphasis added).      The\n\n19   issue is therefore whether the payments made by the Trustee,\n\n20   for which he is seeking contribution, are required by state\n\n21   or federal law--an easy question.\n\n22\n\n\n                                   28\n\f1        The $800 million paid out to customers fulfilled an\n\n2    obligation created by SIPA, a federal statute that does not\n\n3    provide a right to contribution “either expressly or by\n\n4    clear implication,” Texas Industries, Inc. v. Radcliff\n\n5    Materials, Inc., 451 U.S. 630, 638 (1981).   Unlike the\n\n6    Bankruptcy Act, SIPA does not require customers to establish\n\n7    a basis of liability as a prerequisite for the Trustee’s\n\n8    disbursement obligation.   The loss itself is enough.     See 15\n\n9    U.S.C. § 78fff-2(c) (the Trustee “shall allocate customer\n\n10   property of the debtor . . . to customers of such debtor,\n\n11   who shall share ratably in such customer property on the\n\n12   basis and to the extent of their respective net equities”);\n\n13   cf. Hill v. Day (In re Today’s Destiny, Inc.), 388 B.R. 737,\n\n14   753-56 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2008) (holding that Texas law\n\n15   governed contribution claim where debtor sought contribution\n\n16   for obligations set forth in proofs of claim alleging fraud\n\n17   under state law).   Because the Trustee’s payment obligations\n\n18   were imposed by a federal law that does not provide a right\n\n19   to contribution, the district courts properly dismissed\n\n20   these claims.\n\n21\n\n22\n\n\n                                   29\n\f1                                  II\n\n2        Having rejected the Trustee’s claims asserted on behalf\n\n3    of BLMIS, we consider next whether the Trustee may assert\n\n4    such claims on behalf of BLMIS’s customers.    To proceed with\n\n5    these claims, the Trustee must first establish his standing.\n\n6    This he cannot do.\n\n7        Standing is a “threshold question in every federal\n\n8    case, determining the power of the court to entertain the\n\n9    suit.”   Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).    Standing\n\n10   depends, first, on whether the plaintiff has identified a\n\n11   “case or controversy” between the plaintiff and the\n\n12   defendants within the meaning of Article III of the\n\n13   Constitution.   Ass’n of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v.\n\n14   Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152 (1970).    “To have standing, ‘[a]\n\n15   plaintiff must [1] allege personal injury [2] fairly\n\n16   traceable to the defendant’s allegedly unlawful conduct and\n\n17   [3] likely to be redressed by the requested relief.’”\n\n18   Hirsch v. Arthur Andersen & Co., 72 F.3d 1085, 1091 (2d Cir.\n\n19   1995) (alterations in original) (quoting Allen v. Wright,\n\n20   468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984)).   In addition, the plaintiff must\n\n21   comply with “prudential” limitations on standing, of which\n\n22   the salient one here is that a party must “assert his own\n\n\n                                   30\n\f1    legal rights and interests and cannot rest his claim to\n\n2    relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”\n\n3    Warth, 422 U.S. at 499.\n\n4        We consider below Picard’s arguments that: (A) existing\n\n5    Second Circuit precedent allows for third-party standing in\n\n6    a SIPA liquidation; and (B) SIPA itself confers standing,\n\n7    both by creating a bailment relationship between the Trustee\n\n8    and the debtor’s customers, and by authorizing SIPC to\n\n9    pursue subrogation claims on customers’ behalf.16\n\n10                                 A\n\n11       The implied prohibition in Article III against third-\n\n12   party standing applies to actions brought by bankruptcy\n\n13   trustees.   In Caplin v. Marine Midland Grace Trust Co. of\n\n14   N.Y., 406 U.S. 416 (1972), the Supreme Court ruled that\n\n15   federal bankruptcy law does not empower a trustee to collect\n\n16   money owed to creditors.   That is because a bankruptcy\n\n17   trustee is not empowered “to collect money not owed to the\n\n18   estate”; the trustee’s proper task “is simply to collect and\n\n          16\n            In proceedings before one of the district courts,\n     the Trustee grounded his standing argument in large part on\n     Section 544(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which gives a trustee\n     the rights of a hypothetical lien creditor. The court\n     considered this argument at length and ultimately rejected\n     it, see Picard v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 460 B.R. 84, 92-97\n     (S.D.N.Y. 2011) (McMahon, J.), and the Trustee has abandoned\n     it on appeal.\n                                   31\n\f1    reduce to money the property of the estates for which (he is\n\n2    trustee).”   Id. at 428-29 (citation and internal quotation\n\n3    marks omitted).    “[N]owhere in the statutory scheme is there\n\n4    any suggestion that the trustee in reorganization is to\n\n5    assume the responsibility of suing third parties” on behalf\n\n6    of creditors.     Id. at 428.   This way, creditors can “make\n\n7    their own assessment of the respective advantages and\n\n8    disadvantages, not only of litigation, but of various\n\n9    theories of litigation,” id. at 431; no consensus is needed\n\n10   as to “the amount of damages to seek, or even on the theory\n\n11   on which to sue,” id. at 432; and disputes over inconsistent\n\n12   judgments and the scope of settlements can be avoided, id.\n\n13   at 431-32.\n\n14       Our Court has hewed to this principle.      In Wagoner, the\n\n15   misappropriation of funds by the owner and president of the\n\n16   debtor company was facilitated by stock transactions\n\n17   effected through a third-party brokerage firm.      Shearson\n\n18   Lehman Hutton, Inc. v. Wagoner, 944 F.2d 114, 117 (2d Cir.\n\n19   1991).   The trustee’s claim that the brokerage aided and\n\n20   abetted the fraud was dismissed on summary judgment, and we\n\n21   affirmed, observing that “[i]t is well settled that a\n\n22   bankruptcy trustee has no standing generally to sue third\n\n\n                                      32\n\f1    parties on behalf of the estate’s creditors, but may only\n\n2    assert claims held by the bankrupt corporation itself.”     Id.\n\n3    at 118 (citing Caplin, 406 U.S. at 434); see also Hirsch v.\n\n4    Arthur Andersen & Co., 72 F.3d 1085, 1094 (2d Cir. 1995)\n\n5    (holding that Chapter 11 trustee had no standing to bring\n\n6    creditor claims against accountants and law firms that had\n\n7    provided services to the debtor, a real estate partnership\n\n8    operated as a Ponzi scheme); The Mediators, Inc. v. Manney\n\n9    (In re Mediators, Inc.), 105 F.3d 822, 826 (2d Cir. 1997)\n\n10   (affirming dismissal of breach of fiduciary duty claim\n\n11   brought by creditors’ committee functioning as bankruptcy\n\n12   trustee, against bank and law firm for allegedly aiding and\n\n13   abetting debtor’s fraud).\n\n14       The Trustee makes little effort to explain why Caplin\n\n15   and its progeny do not control.   Instead, he relies on a\n\n16   single Second Circuit case that was overruled by the Supreme\n\n17   Court, and on dicta in another.   Apart from lacking\n\n18   precedential force, both cases are readily distinguishable.\n\n19                                1\n\n20       In Redington v. Touche Ross & Co., 592 F.2d 617 (2d\n\n21   Cir. 1978), rev’d, 442 U.S. 560 (1979), a SIPA trustee sued\n\n22   the accountant of an insolvent brokerage for violations of\n\n\n                                  33\n\f1    record-keeping provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities\n\n2    Exchange Act, as well as violations of state common law.\n\n3    The district court dismissed the Section 17(a) claim for\n\n4    lack of an implied private right of action, and concluded\n\n5    that it lacked jurisdiction over the common law claims.     See\n\n6    Redington v. Touche Ross & Co., 428 F. Supp. 483, 492-93\n\n7    (S.D.N.Y. 1977).\n\n8        In reversing, we held that Section 17(a) did create an\n\n9    implied private right of action.    See Redington v. Touche\n\n10   Ross & Co., 592 F.2d 617 (2d Cir. 1978), rev’d, 442 U.S. 560\n\n11   (1979).   We then considered the trustee’s claim that “[h]e\n\n12   is responsible for marshalling and returning [customer]\n\n13   property; to the extent that he is unable to do so, he\n\n14   argues, he may sue on behalf of the customer/bailors any\n\n15   wrongdoer whom they could sue themselves.”   Id. at 625.\n\n16   Relying on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Redington\n\n17   concluded that “the Trustee, as bailee, is an appropriate\n\n18   real party in interest,” id., and that “SIPC is subrogated\n\n19   to the right of action implied in section 17 in favor of\n\n20   brokers’ customers against third parties such as\n\n21   accountants.”   Id. at 624.   Redington would favor Picard’s\n\n22   case, except that Redington is no longer good law.\n\n\n\n                                    34\n\f1        The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Redington to\n\n2    decide whether Section 17(a) created an implied right of\n\n3    action and whether a SIPA trustee and SIPC had standing to\n\n4    assert that claim.     See Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442\n\n5    U.S. 560 (1979).     The Court held that no private right of\n\n6    action existed under Section 17(a), id. at 579, and\n\n7    therefore considered it “unnecessary to reach” the standing\n\n8    issue, id. at 567 n.9.     The case was remanded to consider\n\n9    whether an alternative basis for jurisdiction existed, but\n\n10   none was found.     See Redington v. Touche Ross & Co., 612\n\n11   F.2d 68, 70 (2d Cir. 1979).\n\n12       Picard argues that the Supreme Court left the standing\n\n13   question “untouched” because the opinion was “limited to a\n\n14   merits-based reversal on the issue of whether a private\n\n15   right of action existed under section 17(a).”     Appellant Br.\n\n16   31 (11-5044).     However, the question of who may assert a\n\n17   right of action is presented ordinarily only if a right of\n\n18   action has been found to exist.      See Nat. R.R. Passenger\n\n19   Corp. v. Nat. Assoc. of R.R. Passengers, 414 U.S. 453, 456\n\n20   (1974) (“[T]he threshold question clearly is whether the\n\n21   Amtrak Act . . . creates a [private] cause of action . . .\n\n22   for it is only if such a right of action exists that we need\n\n\n                                     35\n\f1    consider whether the respondent had standing to bring the\n\n2    action[.]”).17   The Supreme Court’s reversal on the\n\n3    threshold question drained the Second Circuit Redington\n\n4    opinion of force on other questions.     See Newdow v. Rio\n\n5    Linda Union Sch. Dist., 597 F.3d 1007, 1041 (9th Cir. 2010)\n\n6    (“[W]hen the Supreme Court reverses a lower court’s decision\n\n7    on a threshold question,” the Court “effectively holds the\n\n8    lower court erred by reaching [other issues].”).\n\n9        Following the Supreme Court’s reversal, this Court\n\n10   vacated its original judgment on the ground that subject\n\n11   matter jurisdiction was lacking.     See Order, Redington v.\n\n12   Touche Ross, Nos. 77-7183, 77-7186 (2d Cir. Aug. 8, 1979);\n\n13   Appellee Br. Addendum A (11-5207).     As the Trustee concedes,\n\n14   vacatur dissipates precedential force.     See Appellant Br. 30\n\n          17\n            The Trustee attempts to distinguish National\n     Railroad on the ground that that case involved a single\n     federal statute without additional claims, so a\n     determination that the Amtrak Act did not create a private\n     right of action ended the case. Because Redington also\n     involved state law claims over which the Court exercised\n     pendent jurisdiction, Picard reasons, “a determination on\n     the existence of a private right of action tied to a federal\n     statute does not end the court’s inquiry into a trustee’s\n     standing to assert state common law claims.” Appellant Br.\n     36 (11-5044). In Redington, however, we did not consider\n     specifically whether the trustee had standing to bring\n     claims under common law. As explained in text, Redington‘s\n     standing analysis was entirely dependent on the Court’s\n     antecedent ruling that the statute created an implied\n     private right of action--a ruling that was later overturned.\n                                   36\n\f1    (11-5044).

Supp. 2d 644, 653 (S.D.N.Y. 1999)\n\n17   (Preska, J.), rev’d on other grounds, 222 F.3d 63 (2d Cir.\n\n18   2000).\n\n19\n\n\n          18\n            In a hearing in the Mishkin case, Judge Pollack\n     concluded, as we do, that Redington “was reversed in all\n     respects not on other grounds” and “does not stand as the\n     law of this circuit.” SPA 17 (11-5175).\n\n\n                                   37\n\f1        Yet Redington has enjoyed something of a half-life,\n\n2    with several courts (including this one) assuming without\n\n3    deciding that Redington retains residual force.19   Redington\n\n4    should be put to rest; it has no precedential effect.\n\n5        Even if Redington retained some persuasive value, it\n\n6    would not decide this case.   First, Redington considered\n\n7    chiefly whether the trustee and SIPC had standing to bring a\n\n8    cause of action under Section 17 of the Exchange Act; the\n\n9    opinion said nothing about a SIPA trustee’s ability to\n\n10   orchestrate mass tort actions against third parties.     See\n\n11   Redington v. Touche Ross & Co., 592 F.2d 617, 618 (2d Cir.\n\n12   1978), rev’d, 442 U.S. 560 (1979) (“[W]e are presented with\n\n13   the question whether a private cause of action exists under\n\n14   section 17 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 against\n\n          19\n            Assuming that Redington was still good law, Judges\n     Drain and Beatty instead rejected SIPA trustees’ standing\n     arguments on the ground that only SIPC, not a SIPA trustee,\n     could enforce its rights of subrogation. See In re Park\n     South Sec., LLC, 326 B.R. at 516; In re A.R. Baron & Co.,\n     Inc., 280 B.R. at 804. In BDO Seidman, LLP, Judge Preska\n     held that although Mishkin‘s interpretation of SIPC’s\n     subrogation power was “more faithful to the letter and\n     purpose of the Act,” she was nonetheless “bound by Redington\n     to find that SIPC has standing to bring suit.” 49 F. Supp.\n     2d at 653. On appeal, this Court “assume[d], without\n     deciding, that . . . SIPC has standing as the customers’\n     subrogee,” SIPC v. BDO Seidman, LLP, 222 F.3d 63, 69 (2d\n     Cir. 2000), and ultimately dismissed its claims on\n     substantive grounds, id. at 71-76.\n\n\n                                   38\n\f1    accountants who prepare misleading statements of a broker’s\n\n2    financial affairs, and if so, who may maintain such an\n\n3    action.”).     Second, our holding in Redington turned, in\n\n4    part, on an analysis of Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(a), which sets\n\n5    forth rules concerning real parties in interest, and which\n\n6    has no application here.     See id. at 625; see also infra p.\n\n7    51 n.25.     Third, Redington involved claims against a single\n\n8    accounting firm for a few discrete instances of alleged\n\n9    misconduct (the preparation of misleading financial\n\n10   statements).    As a result, the policy concerns we express\n\n11   below (see infra pp. 59-69) would have been considerably\n\n12   diminished--and, indeed, were not even addressed by the\n\n13   Court.     Fourth, and finally, in Redington the brokerage firm\n\n14   was not complicit in the wrongdoing, but rather “an entity\n\n15   distinct from its conniving officers [that] was directly\n\n16   damaged by Touche Ross’ unsatisfactory audit.”     592 F.2d at\n\n17   620.     The Redington Court therefore did not have occasion to\n\n18   consider whether the doctrine of in pari delicto barred all\n\n19   or part of the suit.     In sum, Redington is both non-binding\n\n20   and inapposite.\n\n21\n22\n23\n\n                                     39\n\f1                                   2\n\n2        The Trustee relies on St. Paul Fire & Marine Insurance\n\n3    Co. v. PepsiCo, Inc., 884 F.2d 688 (2d Cir. 1989), for the\n\n4    proposition that a trustee may assert creditors’ claims if\n\n5    they are generalized in nature, and not particular to any\n\n6    individual creditor.    However, the holding of that case has\n\n7    no application here.\n\n8        PepsiCo had been guarantor of bonds issued by a\n\n9    subsidiary that later was acquired by a subsidiary of Banner\n\n10   Industries.    When the (later) merged entity defaulted on the\n\n11   bonds, PepsiCo sued Banner, alleging diversion of assets and\n\n12   alter ego.    The merged entity went bankrupt, and the trustee\n\n13   sued Banner for misappropriation.    We ruled that the\n\n14   trustee--and not PepsiCo--could pursue Banner because Ohio\n\n15   law allowed a subsidiary to assert an alter ego claim\n\n16   against its parent, so that “[t]he cause of action therefore\n\n17   becomes property of the estate of a bankrupt subsidiary, and\n\n18   is properly asserted by the trustee in bankruptcy.”      Id. at\n\n19   703-04.\n\n20       Picard directs us to a passage in St. Paul--stating\n\n21   that a trustee may bring a claim if the “claim is a general\n\n22   one, with no particularized injury arising from it, and if\n\n\n                                    40\n\f1    that claim could be brought by any creditor of the debtor,”\n\n2    id. at 701--and contends that the third-party claims here\n\n3    are common to all customers because all customers were\n\n4    similarly injured by Madoff’s fraud and the Defendants’\n\n5    facilitation.    This argument is flawed on many levels:\n\n6        •    St. Paul decided the “specific question” whether a\n\n7    creditor may bring an alter ego claim against the debtor’s\n\n8    parent when the debtor itself also possesses such a claim.\n\n9    Id. at 699.     But Picard seeks to assert claims that are\n\n10   property only of the creditors, not of the debtor.\n\n11       •    The Trustee’s broad reading of St. Paul would\n\n12   bring the Court’s holding into conflict with a line of cases\n\n13   that came before and after it.       As discussed supra pp. 32-\n\n14   34, it is settled that a trustee may not assert creditors’\n\n15   claims against third parties.        See, e.g., Shearson Lehman\n\n16   Hutton, Inc. v. Wagoner, 944 F.2d 114 (2d Cir. 1991).        And,\n\n17   of course, St. Paul could not alter the Supreme Court’s\n\n18   ruling in Caplin.     Picard’s argument thus conflicts with\n\n19   Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent.       See generally\n\n20   In re Stanwich Fin. Servs. Corp., 317 B.R. 224, 228 n.4\n\n21   (Bankr. D. Conn. 2004) (highlighting this tension).\n\n22\n\n\n                                     41\n\f1        •    The language cited by Picard from St. Paul is not\n\n2    a pronouncement about third-party standing; it voices the\n\n3    maxim that only a trustee, not creditors, may assert claims\n\n4    that belong to the bankrupt estate.    As St. Paul elsewhere\n\n5    states: “‘[T]he Trustee in bankruptcy has standing to\n\n6    represent only the interests of the debtor corporation.’\n\n7    Our decision today goes no further than to say that causes\n\n8    of action that could be asserted by the debtor are property\n\n9    of the estate and should be asserted by the trustee.”     St.\n\n10   Paul, 884 F.2d at 702 n.3 (internal citation omitted)\n\n11   (quoting Bloor v. Carro, Spanbock, Londin, Rodman & Fass,\n\n12   754 F.2d 57, 62 n.4 (2d Cir. 1985)).   As illustrated by St.\n\n13   Paul, when a creditor seeks relief against third parties\n\n14   that pushed the debtor into bankruptcy, the creditor is\n\n15   asserting a derivative claim that arises from harm done to\n\n16   the estate.   Judge Posner described this distinction:\n\n17            The point is simply that the trustee is confined\n18            to enforcing entitlements of the corporation. He\n19            has no right to enforce entitlements of a\n20            creditor. He represents the unsecured creditors\n21            of the corporation; and in that sense when he is\n22            suing on behalf of the corporation he is really\n23            suing on behalf of the creditors of the\n24            corporation. But there is a difference between a\n25            creditor’s interest in the claims of the\n26            corporation against a third party, which are\n27            enforced by the trustee, and the creditor’s own\n28            direct--not derivative--claim against the third\n\n                                   42\n\f1                  party, which only the creditor himself can\n2                  enforce.\n3\n4    Steinberg v. Buczynski, 40 F.3d 890, 893 (7th Cir. 1994).\n\n5    See generally Prod. Res. Grp., L.L.C. v. NCT Grp., Inc., 863\n\n6    A.2d 772, 792 (Del. Ch. 2004).\n\n7           •      The customers’ claims against the Defendants are\n\n8    not “common” or “general.”       A debtor’s claim against a third\n\n9    party is “general” if it seeks to augment the fund of\n\n10   customer property and thus affects all creditors in the same\n\n11   way.       Picard, however, seeks to assert claims on behalf of\n\n12   thousands of customers against third-party financial\n\n13   institutions for their handling of individual investments\n\n14   made on various dates in varying amounts.       The Defendants’\n\n15   alleged wrongful acts, then, could not have harmed all\n\n16   customers in the same way.20\n\n            20\n            A recent case arising out of the BLMIS bankruptcy\n     provides a useful contrast. In Fox v. Picard (In re\n     Madoff), 848 F. Supp. 2d 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2012), the district\n     court relied on St. Paul in holding that certain Madoff\n     customers could not pursue fraudulent transfer claims “that\n     were the property of the BLMIS estate.” Id. at 478. The\n     customer claims were “duplicative and derivative of the\n     Trustee’s fraudulent transfer claim.” Id. at 479 n.2.\n     Accordingly, the court found the claims to be “general” in\n     the sense articulated in St. Paul, in that they arose from\n     “a single set of actions that harmed BLMIS and all BLMIS\n     customers in the same way.” Id. at 480. Here, however, the\n     customers’ claims are not derivative of claims held by the\n     BLMIS estate.\n\n\n                                       43\n\f1                                   B\n\n2        The Trustee attempts to blunt the force of Caplin and\n\n3    its progeny by arguing that a SIPA liquidation is unique and\n\n4    is therefore not controlled by precedent under the\n\n5    bankruptcy code.   He advances two theories for why a SIPA\n\n6    trustee enjoys standing to assert third-party claims.\n\n7                                   1\n\n8        Picard contends that, for SIPA purposes, the customers\n\n9    of a failed brokerage are bailors, and that he--acting as\n\n10   bailee--“has a sufficient possessory interest to permit him\n\n11   to ‘recover for the wrongful act of a third party resulting\n\n12   in the loss of, or injury to, the subject of the bailment.’”\n\n13   United States v. Perea, 986 F.2d 633, 640 (2d Cir. 1993)\n\n14   (quoting Rogers v. Atl., Gulf & Pac. Co., 107 N.E. 661, 664\n\n15   (N.Y. 1915)).   We disagree.\n\n16       First, the statute is not written or cast in terms of\n\n17   bailment.   “To the extent consistent with the provisions of\n\n18   this chapter, a liquidation proceeding shall be conducted in\n\n19   accordance with, and as though it were being conducted under\n\n20   [the Bankruptcy Code].”   15 U.S.C. § 78fff(b).   As a general\n\n21   rule, SIPA vests trustees with “the same powers and title\n\n22   with respect to the debtor and the property of the debtor\n\n\n                                    44\n\f1    . . . as a trustee in a case under Title 11.”        15 U.S.C. §\n\n2    78fff-1(a).   True, a SIPA trustee has some powers not\n\n3    conferred on a trustee under Title 11.        Most notably, SIPA\n\n4    creates a fund of customer property that is separate from\n\n5    the debtor estate and that has priority over other\n\n6    creditors’ claims, and authorizes the trustee to ratably\n\n7    distribute those funds based on customers’ net equity.          See\n\n8    15 U.S.C. § 78fff–2(c)(1)(B); In re Bernard L. Madoff\n\n9    Investment Secs., 654 F.3d 229, 231 (2d Cir. 2011), cert.\n\n10   denied, 133 S. Ct. 25 (2012).        But the statute does not\n\n11   confer upon SIPA trustees a power, denied all other\n\n12   bankruptcy trustees, to sue third parties on claims that\n\n13   belong to persons other than the estate.        Nowhere does the\n\n14   statute reference bailment, or characterize customers as\n\n15   “bailors” or trustees as “bailees,” or in any way indicate\n\n16   that the trustee is acting as bailee of customer property.\n\n17       Picard alternatively invokes the principle of bailment\n\n18   under the common law.   This is dubious: courts are careful\n\n19   to avoid overlaying common law principles onto a statutory\n\n20   framework, even when (unlike here) the statute makes clear\n\n21   reference to common law.   See Moore v. PaineWebber, Inc.,\n\n22   189 F.3d 165, 179-80 (2d Cir. 1999) (“That the statute . . .\n\n\n\n                                     45\n\f1    borrow[s] in part from the common law should not mislead us:\n\n2    it remains the statute and its purpose that governs.”).\n\n3    This caution is especially apt here because the statute\n\n4    creates a ramified scheme that makes no mention of common\n\n5    law.\n\n6           In any event, the analogy to the common law of bailment\n\n7    is flawed from start to finish.     A bailment is “a delivery\n\n8    of personalty for some particular purpose, or on mere\n\n9    deposit, upon a contract express or implied, that after the\n\n10   purpose has been fulfilled it will be redelivered to the\n\n11   person who delivered it, or otherwise dealt with according\n\n12   to that person’s directions, or kept until it is reclaimed.”\n\n13   9 N.Y. Jur. 2d Bailments and Chattel Leases § 1 (West 2013).\n\n14   Even assuming that the customers’ investments could be\n\n15   deemed bailed property, the only delivery that took place\n\n16   was when customers made their investments, either in BLMIS\n\n17   directly, or through the feeder funds.     See Pattison v.\n\n18   Hammerstein, 39 N.Y.S. 1039, 1040 (App. Div. 1st Dep’t\n\n19   1896); see also United States v. $79,000 in Account No.\n\n20   2168050/6749900 at Bank of N.Y., 96 CIV. 3493 (MBM), 1996 WL\n\n21   648934, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 7, 1996) (“Delivery to the\n\n22   bailee is required to create a bailment.”).     So: any\n\n\n\n                                    46\n\f1    supposed bailment pre-dated Picard’s appointment; he was not\n\n2    entrusted with any customer property until after it had been\n\n3    impaired; and he never had control over the missing funds\n\n4    that he now seeks to recoup.     He therefore is not the proper\n\n5    party to bring such an action.      See 9 N.Y. Jur. 2d Bailments\n\n6    and Chattel Leases § 115 (West 2013) (explaining that bailee\n\n7    may only “bring an action to recover for the loss of or\n\n8    injury to the bailed property while in his or her\n\n9    possession”).21\n\n10       Moreover, Picard is not seeking to recover specific\n\n11   bailments for return to individual bailors.     See 9 N.Y. Jur.\n\n12   2d Bailments and Chattel Leases § 82 (West 2013) (“One of\n\n13   the most important rights of the bailor is that, on the\n\n14   termination of the bailment, the bailor will return to him\n\n15   or her the identical thing bailed . . . .”).     Unlike\n\n16   “customer name securities,” which are separately held and\n\n17   returned to individual customers outside the normal\n\n18   distribution scheme,22 Picard’s claims are intended to\n\n          21\n            Judge McMahon likened the Trustee’s position to that\n     of a parking garage attendant who is handed the keys to a\n     car that was recently in an accident and decides to sue the\n     culpable party on the owner’s behalf. See Picard v.\n     JPMorgan Chase & Co., 460 B.R. 84, 104-05 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).\n          22\n            See 15 U.S.C. § 78lll(4) (excluding “customer name\n     securities delivered to the customer” from definition of\n                                    47\n\f1    augment the general fund of customer property so that it can\n\n2    be distributed ratably based on customers’ net equity.     This\n\n3    arrangement is not an analog to a bailment, in which the\n\n4    bailee is entrusted with an item that is to be recovered by\n\n5    the bailor at some later time.\n\n6        SIPC urges that we view the transaction as though\n\n7    BLMIS, not the Trustee, acted as the bailee of customer\n\n8    property, and that the Trustee is simply acting on BLMIS’s\n\n9    behalf to recover the bailed property.   The short answer is\n\n10   that Madoff (and, by extension, BLMIS) took the investment\n\n11   money from the customers in order to defraud them--and a\n\n12   thief is not a bailee of stolen property.   See Pivar v.\n\n13   Graduate Sch. of Figurative Art of the N.Y. Acad. of Art,\n\n14   735 N.Y.S. 2d 522, 522 (App. Div. 1st Dep’t 2002) (holding\n\n15   that a bailment relationship arises if the bailee takes\n\n\n\n     customer property); see also In re New Times Sec. Servs.,\n     Inc., 371 F.3d 68, 72-73 (2d Cir. 2004). This contrast, and\n     its ramifications, are illuminated by SIPC’s own statements\n     to Congress regarding the passage of the 1978 amendments to\n     SIPA. SIPC’s then-Chairman, Hugh F. Owens, explained that\n     customer name securities “will be treated, in short, as\n     though they are not part of the debtor’s estate, but merely\n     held by the debtor as bailee”--implying that most other\n     commingled property, such as cash, would simply become part\n     of the debtor’s estate. SIPA Amendments: Hearings on H.R.\n     8331 Before the Subcomm. on Sec., Comm. on Banking, Hous.\n     and Urban Affairs, 95th Cong. 41-42 (1978) (Statement by\n     Hugh F. Owens, Chairman of SIPC).\n                                  48\n\f1    “lawful possession” of property “without present intent to\n\n2    appropriate”).\n\n3        Madoff’s commingling of customer funds also defeats any\n\n4    analogy to bailment.     Notwithstanding Madoff’s pretense, he\n\n5    failed to maintain customers’ investments in separate named\n\n6    accounts.     He deposited all customer funds into a general\n\n7    account (the 703 Account) and distributed those new\n\n8    investments to earlier customers in lieu of actual returns.\n\n9    This arrangement, which enabled the fraud, made a bailment\n\n10   impossible.

F.D.I.C.,\n\n11   961 F.2d 327, 330 (2d Cir. 1992) (distinguishing special\n\n12   accounts from general accounts); see also United States v.\n\n13   Khan, No. 97-6083, 1997 WL 701366, at *2 (2d Cir. 1997)\n\n14   (holding that a deposit into a general bank account\n\n15   “destroys a potential bailment” under New York law).23\n\n16\n\n          23\n            “With a few exceptions, such as commingled fungible\n     goods in a warehouse, the general rule is that the bailee\n     can only discharge his or her liability to the bailor by\n     returning the identical thing received, in its original or\n     an altered form, according to the terms of the bailment.” 9\n     N.Y. Jur. 2d Bailments and Chattel Leases § 84 (West 2013).\n     Rahilly v. Wilson, a case relied on by SIPC, is not to the\n     contrary. See Rahilly v. Wilson, 20 F. Cas. 179, 182 (Cir.\n     Ct. D. Minn. 1873) (comparing commingled bales of wheat to\n     “an ordinary general deposit of money in a bank” and holding\n     that no bailment had taken place).\n\n\n                                     49\n\f1        SIPC attempts to obviate these difficulties by relying\n\n2    on SEC Rule 15c, which establishes bookkeeping segregation\n\n3    requirements for brokers.   17 C.F.R. § 240.15c3-3.    Judge\n\n4    Rakoff was “mystified” by this argument, Picard v. HSBC Bank\n\n5    PLC, 454 B.R. 25, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), as are we.\n\n6        Rule 15c requires brokers to maintain a minimum cash\n\n7    balance in a reserve account and segregate all such cash for\n\n8    customers’ benefit.   See 17 C.F.R. § 240.15c3-3.     It also\n\n9    “specifically contemplates the commingling of customer\n\n10   monies and the lending of customer securities.”     Levitin v.\n\n11   PaineWebber, Inc., 159 F.3d 698, 706 (2d Cir. 1998).\n\n12   Whatever Rule 15c may do, it does not confer power on a SIPA\n\n13   trustee to sue on behalf of customers.     First, the Rule is\n\n14   not a part of SIPA.   Second, such a rule would exceed the\n\n15   scope of agency rule-making.   See generally Alexander v.\n\n16   Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 291 (2001) (“Language in a\n\n17   regulation may invoke a private right of action that\n\n18   Congress through statutory text created, but it may not\n\n19   create a right that Congress has not.”).     In any event, the\n\n20   Rule does not suggest that the broker (or the Trustee)\n\n21   serves as a bailee of customer property, or that the Trustee\n\n22   may assert claims on behalf of customers.\n\n\n                                    50\n\f1       Finally, SIPC and the Trustee infer a bailment\n\n2   relationship from federal common law and the Federal Rules\n\n3   of Civil Procedure.   The inferences are strained at best.\n\n4   Federal common law, which does not speak to the powers of a\n\n5   SIPA trustee, offers no useful insight.24   Nor do the\n\n6   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.25\n\n7                                 2\n\n8       The Trustee argues that, because SIPC advanced funds to\n\n9   customers at the outset of the liquidation, SIPC is\n\n         24\n           SIPC suggests that it is appropriate to resort to\n    federal common law where a significant conflict exists\n    between state and federal law and where the need for\n    uniformity in the treatment of brokerage customers is\n    paramount. But no legal authority is offered to support the\n    application of federal common law here. And there is no\n    evident conflict between New York bailment law (on the one\n    hand) and (on the other) SIPA, Rule 15c, or some broader\n    federal policy.\n         25\n           The Trustee invokes Rule 17, which allows a bailee\n    to sue “in [his] own name[] without joining the person for\n    whose benefit the action is brought.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n    17(a)(1). But, as discussed in text, the trustee is not a\n    bailee. Additionally, Rule 17(a), like all rules prescribed\n    by the Supreme Court, may not abridge, enlarge, or otherwise\n    modify substantive rights. See 28 U.S.C. § 2072(b);\n    Stichting Ter Behartiging Van de Belangen Van\n    Oudaandeelhouders In Het Kapitaal Van Saybolt Int’l B.V. v.\n    Schreiber, 407 F.3d 34, 49 (2d Cir. 2005) (“The procedural\n    mechanisms set forth in Rule 17(a) for ameliorating real\n    party in interest problems may not . . . be employed to\n    expand substantive rights.”). It therefore cannot provide\n    an independent basis for standing. See generally Natural\n    Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. EPA, 481 F.2d 116, 121 (10th Cir.\n    1973).\n                                  51\n\f1    subrogated to those customers’ claims against the\n\n2    Defendants; SIPC therefore may assert those claims as\n\n3    subrogee; and Picard is authorized to enforce that right on\n\n4    SIPC’s behalf.     But SIPC is a creature of statute, and\n\n5    neither the plain language of the statute, nor its\n\n6    legislative history, supports the Trustee’s position.\n\n7        True, a SIPA trustee (unlike a trustee in bankruptcy),\n\n8    advances money to pay claims.        The statute takes this fact\n\n9    into account by subrogating SIPC to customers’ net equity\n\n10   claims to the extent of the advances they received.           But it\n\n11   goes no further.\n\n12       The Trustee’s subrogation theory is premised in\n\n13   § 78fff-3(a):\n\n14            To the extent moneys are advanced by SIPC to the\n15            trustee to pay or otherwise satisfy the claims of\n16            customers, in addition to all other rights it may\n17            have at law or in equity, SIPC shall be subrogated\n18            to the claims of such customers with the rights\n19            and priorities provided in this chapter, except\n20            that SIPC as subrogee may assert no claim against\n21            customer property until after the allocation\n22            thereof to customers as provided in section 78fff-\n23            2(c) of this title.\n24\n25   15 U.S.C. § 78fff-3(a).    It is undisputed that the phrase\n\n26   “claims of customers” refers (as throughout the statute) to\n\n27   customers’ net equity claims against the estate.        See\n\n28   generally In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec. LLC, 654 F.3d\n\n                                     52\n\f1    229, 233 (2d Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 133 S. Ct. 25 (2012).\n\n2    SIPA thus allows only a narrow right of subrogation--for\n\n3    SIPC to assert claims against the fund of customer property\n\n4    and thereby recoup any funds advanced to customers once the\n\n5    SIPA trustee has satisfied those customers’ net equity\n\n6    claims.\n\n7        The Trustee urges us to conclude that § 78fff-3(a) does\n\n8    more--much more--by creating a right of subrogation that\n\n9    allows SIPC (and, by extension, the Trustee) to step into\n\n10   customers’ shoes and to initiate and control litigation on\n\n11   their behalf, against any number of defendants, until SIPC\n\n12   has been repaid in full.   As we emphasized earlier, SIPA\n\n13   grants trustees the “same powers and title with respect to\n\n14   the debtor and the property of the debtor” as a Title 11\n\n15   trustee, 15 U.S.C. § 78fff-1(a), and the Supreme Court has\n\n16   squarely rejected attempts by Title 11 trustees to capture\n\n17   such litigation, see Caplin v. Marine Midland Grace Trust\n\n18   Co., 406 U.S. 416, 428 (1972).     As a final resort, the\n\n19   Trustee relies on a catch-all provision included in the 1978\n\n20   amendments to SIPA, which states that the subrogation rights\n\n21   afforded by § 78fff-3(a) should not be read to diminish “all\n\n22   other rights [SIPC] may have at law or in equity.”    15\n\n\n\n                                   53\n\f1    U.S.C. § 78fff-3(a).    From here, the Trustee claims an\n\n2    implied right of equitable subrogation, “the principle by\n\n3    which an insurer, having paid losses of its insured, is\n\n4    placed in the position of its insured so that it may recover\n\n5    from the third party legally responsible for the loss.”\n\n6    Winkelmann v. Excelsior Ins. Co., 650 N.E.2d 841, 843 (N.Y.\n\n7    1995).    He thus claims a wide grant of authority to initiate\n\n8    class-action lawsuits and assert any number of tort claims\n\n9    against third parties on customers’ behalf.26   This is a\n\n10   long, long reach.\n\n11       There is no sign that Congress intended an expansive\n\n12   increment of power to SIPA trustees.    In 1973, the SIPC\n\n13   chairman appointed a Special Task Force to consider possible\n\n14   amendments to the 1970 Act.    The resulting July 1974 report\n\n15   separately listed its “major policy recommendations” and its\n\n16   proposed “technical refinements.”    See Report to the Board\n\n17   of Directors of SIPC of the Special Task Force to Consider\n\n18   Possible Amendments to SIPA, Letter of Transmittal (July 31,\n\n19   1974).    Recommendation II.A.9, deemed a “Major Policy\n\n20   Recommendation,” states that “claims of SIPC as subrogee\n\n21   (except as otherwise provided), should be allowable only as\n\n          26\n            We use the term “class-action lawsuits” loosely\n     here, without taking a position on the SLUSA question.\n                                    54\n\f1    claims against the general estate.”        Id. at 12 (emphasis\n\n2    added); see also SIPA Amendments of 1975: Hearings on H.R.\n\n3    8064 Before the Subcomm. on Consumer Protection and Fin. of\n\n4    the H. Comm. on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 94th Cong.\n\n5    64 (1976) (hereinafter “Hearings on H.R. 8064”).\n\n6         Notably, Caplin was decided in 1972, before the Task\n\n7    Force report and six years before Congress amended § 78fff-\n\n8    3(a) to include “all other rights [SIPC] may have at law or\n\n9    in equity.”   If Congress sought to exempt SIPA trustees from\n\n10   Caplin’s rule and expand SIPC’s subrogation rights to tort\n\n11   actions against third parties, we would expect such intent\n\n12   to be manifested in the statutory wording and in the\n\n13   record.27\n\n14        The wording cited by Picard was proposed by SIPC itself\n\n15   as a “Minor Substantive or Technical Amendment[]” in order\n\n16   to “make clear that SIPC’s subrogation rights under the 1970\n\n17   Act are cumulative with whatever rights it may have under\n\n18   other State or Federal laws.”        Hearings on H.R. 8064, 94th\n\n\n          27\n            Caplin was undoubtedly on the radar of legislators\n     at the time, as an earlier version of Section 544 of the\n     Bankruptcy Code introduced with the 1978 amendments\n     contained a provision intended to overrule Caplin. See In\n     re Ozark Rest. Equip. Co., Inc., 816 F.2d 1222, 1227 n.9\n     (8th Cir. 1987). Significantly, this provision was deleted\n     prior to enactment. Id.\n                                     55\n\f1    Cong. 197, 199 (1976) (Memorandum of the Securities Investor\n\n2    Protection Corporation in Regard to Certain Comments\n\n3    Concerning H.R. 8064).    Congress “does not alter the\n\n4    fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or\n\n5    ancillary provisions--it does not . . . hide elephants in\n\n6    mouseholes.”   Whitman v. Am. Trucking Assocs., Inc., 531\n\n7    U.S. 457, 468 (2001).\n\n8        The Trustee adduces rules of insurance law to justify\n\n9    his claim, an analogy with some intuitive appeal: Principles\n\n10   of equity generally permit subrogees wide scope to sue\n\n11   third-party tortfeasors, a claim that arises most commonly\n\n12   with insurance.    See, e.g., Winkelmann, 650 N.E.2d at 843.\n\n13       But this argument succumbs to the same critique as\n\n14   Picard’s bailment theory: We avoid engrafting common law\n\n15   principles onto a statutory scheme unless Congress’s intent\n\n16   is manifest.   See supra p. 46.     The clearest Congressional\n\n17   intent here is that we should treat SIPA as a bankruptcy\n\n18   statute, not as an insurance scheme.     “SIPA and FDIA are\n\n19   independent statutory schemes, enacted to serve the unique\n\n20   needs of the banking and securities industries,\n\n21   respectively.”28   SIPC v. Morgan, Kennedy & Co., 533 F.2d\n\n          28\n             Congress rejected some early versions of the SIPA\n     bill “which were patterned on FDIA and which extended\n                                    56\n\f1    1314, 1318 (2d Cir. 1976).     We have since warned against\n\n2    oversimplified comparisons between insurance law and federal\n\n3    statutory law: “While this Court has referred to SIPC as\n\n4    providing a form of public insurance, it is clear that the\n\n5    obligations imposed on an insurance provider under state law\n\n6    do not apply to this congressionally-created nonprofit\n\n7    membership corporation.”     In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec.\n\n8    LLC, 654 F.3d 229, 239 (2d Cir. 2011), cert. denied, 133 S.\n\n9    Ct. 25 (2012) (internal citations and quotation marks\n\n10   omitted).\n\n11       Relatedly, Picard argues under principles of equity\n\n12   that unless he can spearhead the litigation on behalf of\n\n13   defrauded customers, the victims will not be made whole,\n\n14   SIPC will be unable to recoup its advances, and third-party\n\n15   tortfeasors will reap windfalls.29    No doubt, there are\n\n\n     insurance coverage to certain beneficial interests\n     represented by customer accounts.” Morgan, Kennedy & Co.,\n     533 F.2d at 1318.\n          29\n             Picard and SIPC contend that, absent his exclusive\n     authority to bring these customer claims, the Defendants\n     would in effect be immunized from suit. But it is not\n     obvious why customers cannot bring their own suits against\n     the Defendants. In fact, the Defendants make clear that\n     customers have already filed such actions. See, e.g., MLSMK\n     Inv. Co. v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., 431 F. App’x 17 (2d Cir.\n     2011) (summary order); Shapiro v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., No.\n     11-CV-8331 (S.D.N.Y.); Hill v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., No. 11-\n     CV-7961 (S.D.N.Y.). As in Redington, “the customers on\n     whose behalf the Trustee seeks to maintain suit are not only\n                                     57\n\f1    advantages to the course Picard wants to follow.     But equity\n\n2    has its limits; it may fill certain gaps in a statute, but\n\n3    it should not be used to enlarge substantive rights and\n\n4    powers.   Cf. In re Ozark, 816 F.2d at 1230 (observing that\n\n5    while Bankruptcy Code allows a court to apply equitable\n\n6    principles when necessary, “[t]hese powers . . . do not\n\n7    include the ability to award equitable relief where the\n\n8    party asserting the cause of action for such relief does not\n\n9    have standing under any other section of the Code”).\n\n10       As the Supreme Court observed, “SIPC’s theory of\n\n11   subrogation is fraught with unanswered questions.”       Holmes\n\n12   v. SIPC, 503 U.S. 258, 270 (1992) (ultimately declining to\n\n13   decide subrogation issue and instead holding that link\n\n14   between stock manipulation and harm to customers was too\n\n15   remote to support SIPC’s RICO claim).     As in Holmes, SIPC\n\n16   has left courts “to guess at the nature of the ‘common law\n\n17   rights of subrogation’ that it claims.”    Id. at 271.\n\n18       The practical skepticism voiced in Caplin in a\n\n19   traditional bankruptcy context is justified here as well.\n\n20   Would such suits prevent customers from “mak[ing] their own\n\n\n\n     entitled to bring, but have already initiated their own\n     action.” Redington v. Touche Ross & Co., 592 F.2d 617, 635\n     (2d Cir. 1978) (Mulligan, J., dissenting).\n                                   58\n\f1    assessment of the respective advantages and disadvantages,\n\n2    not only of litigation, but of various theories of\n\n3    litigation”?     Caplin, 406 U.S. at 431.    Can a SIPA trustee\n\n4    control customers’ claims against third parties if SIPC has\n\n5    not fully satisfied the customers’ claims against the\n\n6    estate?     How would inconsistent judgments be avoided, given\n\n7    that “independent actions are still likely because it is\n\n8    extremely doubtful that [the parties] would agree on the\n\n9    amount of damages to seek, or even on the theory on which to\n\n10   sue”?     Id. at 432.   Who would be bound by a settlement\n\n11   entered into by either the Trustee or by each customer who\n\n12   brings suit?     Id.    The size and scope of the litigation here\n\n13   only amplify these concerns.\n\n14       As Caplin advises, it is better to leave these\n\n15   intractable policy judgments to Congress:\n\n16               Congress might well decide that reorganizations\n17               have not fared badly in the 34 years since Chapter\n18               X was enacted and that the status quo is\n19               preferable to inviting new problems by making\n20               changes in the system. Or, Congress could\n21               determine that the trustee . . . was so well\n22               situated for bringing suits . . . that he should\n23               be permitted to do so. In this event, Congress\n24               might also determine that the trustee’s action was\n25               exclusive, or that it should be brought as a class\n26               action on behalf of all [creditors], or perhaps\n27               even that the [creditors] should have the option\n28               of suing on their own or having the trustee sue on\n29               their behalf. Any number of alternatives are\n\n                                       59\n\f1            available. Congress would also be able to answer\n2            questions regarding subrogation or timing of law\n3            suits before these questions arise in the context\n4            of litigation. Whatever the decision, it is one\n5            that only Congress can make.\n\n6   Caplin, 406 U.S. at 434-35.\n\n7                            *    *    *\n\n8       For the foregoing reasons, the judgments are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  60\n\f",

The four\n\n31   actions presently before this Court allege that numerous\n\n32   major financial institutions aided and abetted the fraud,\n\n33   collecting steep fees while ignoring blatant warning signs.\n\n34   In summary, the complaints allege that, when the Defendants\n\n35   were confronted with evidence of Madoff’s illegitimate\n\n\n                                    6\n\f1    scheme, their banking fees gave incentive to look away, or\n\n2    at least caused a failure to perform due diligence that\n\n3    would have revealed the fraud.    The Trustee asserts claims\n\n4    for unjust enrichment, breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and\n\n5    abetting fraud, and negligence, among others.    The Trustee’s\n\n6    position is supported by the Securities Investor Protection\n\n7    Corporation (“SIPC”), a statutorily created nonprofit\n\n8    corporation consisting of registered broker-dealers and\n\n9    members of national securities exchanges, which intervened\n\n10   to recover some or all of the approximately $800 million it\n\n11   advanced to victims.\n\n12       As we will explain, the doctrine of in pari delicto\n\n13   bars the Trustee (who stands in Madoff’s shoes) from\n\n14   asserting claims directly against the Defendants on behalf\n\n15   of the estate for wrongdoing in which Madoff (to say the\n\n16   least) participated.   The claim for contribution is likewise\n\n17   unfounded, as SIPA provides no such right.    The decisive\n\n18   issue, then, is whether the Trustee has standing to pursue\n\n19   the common law claims on behalf of Madoff’s customers.       Two\n\n20   thorough well-reasoned opinions by the district courts held\n\n21   that he does not.   See Picard v.

Although a SIPA liquidation is not a\n\n19   traditional bankruptcy, a SIPA trustee is vested with the\n\n20   “same powers and title with respect to the debtor and the\n\n21   property of the debtor . . . as a trustee in a case under\n\n22   Title 11.”    15 U.S.C. § 78fff-1(a).   At best, SIPA is silent\n\n\n\n                                     8\n\f1    as to the questions presented here.    And analogies to the\n\n2    law of bailment and the law of subrogation are inapt and\n\n3    unconvincing.1\n\n4\n\n5                              BACKGROUND\n\n6        In December 2008, federal agents arrested Bernard L.\n\n7    Madoff, who had conducted the largest Ponzi scheme yet\n\n8    uncovered.   Madoff purported to employ a “split-strike\n\n9    conversion strategy” that involved buying S&P 100 stocks and\n\n10   hedging through the use of options.    In reality, he engaged\n\n11   in no securities transactions at all.2\n\n12\n\n\n          1\n            The Defendants also argue that the Trustee has not\n     met constitutional standing requirements, violates the\n     Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act, and fails to\n     plead with particularity SIPC’s purported subrogation\n     claims. Given our holding, we decline to address these\n     arguments.\n          2\n             Although Madoff simply appropriated his clients’\n     money without ever purchasing securities on their behalf, we\n     have held that Madoff’s victims are nonetheless “customers”\n     under the Act.

The district court appointed Picard as\n\n12   the firm’s Trustee and referred the case to the bankruptcy\n\n13   court.\n\n14       SIPA was enacted in 1970 to speed the distribution of\n\n15   “customer property” back to investors following a firm’s\n\n16   collapse.3      Customer property is cash and securities held\n\n17   separately from the general estate of the failed brokerage\n\n18   firm.       “SIPA serves dual purposes: to protect investors, and\n\n19   to protect the securities market as a whole.”       In re Bernard\n\n20   L.

Under SIPA, each customer shares ratably in the\n\n4    fund of customer property according to the customer’s “net\n\n5    equity.”\n\n6        If (as is often the case) the assets are not enough to\n\n7    satisfy all net equity claims, SIPC advances money (up to\n\n8    $500,000 per customer) to the SIPA trustee, who is charged\n\n9    with assessing customer claims and making the ratable\n\n10   distributions.   At the time of this appeal, SIPC had\n\n11   advanced approximately $800 million.\n\n12       A trustee also has authority to investigate the\n\n13   circumstances surrounding the insolvency and to recover and\n\n14   distribute any remaining funds to creditors.    Picard alleges\n\n15   that his investigation has uncovered evidence of wrongdoing\n\n16   by third parties who aided and abetted Madoff, and seeks to\n\n17   replenish the fund of customer property by taking action\n\n18   against various financial institutions that serviced BLMIS.\n\n19       Picard presses claims against JPMorgan Chase & Co., UBS\n\n20   AG, UniCredit Bank Austria AG, HSBC Bank plc, and affiliated\n\n21   persons and entities.

In the years prior to BLMIS’s\n\n9    bankruptcy, JPMorgan collected an estimated half billion\n\n10   dollars in fees, interest payments, and revenue from BLMIS.\n\n11   The Trustee alleges that JPMorgan was “at the very center”\n\n12   of Madoff’s fraud and was “thoroughly complicit” in it.      A\n\n13   662 ¶ 1.5   Madoff’s primary account with JPMorgan, the “703\n\n14   Account,” was where hundreds of billions of dollars of\n\n15   customer money were “commingled and ultimately washed.”      A\n\n16   663 ¶ 2.    The customer funds deposited into the 703 Account\n\n17   for “split-strike” securities transactions were instead\n\n18   funneled to other customers to sustain the illusion of large\n\n19   and reliable returns on investment.\n\n          4\n            Throughout this brief, “JPMorgan” refers to the four\n     JPMorgan defendants: JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase\n     Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and J.P. Morgan\n     Securities Ltd.\n          5\n            Record citations refer to the joint appendix filed in\n     the action under discussion.\n                                    12\n\f1        The 703 Account was a retail checking account, not a\n\n2    commercial account.     Billions of dollars from thousands of\n\n3    investors were deposited without being segregated or\n\n4    transferred to separate sub-accounts.        These accounts\n\n5    exhibited, on their face, a “glaring absence of securities\n\n6    activity.”     A 714 ¶ 190.     At the same time, numerous multi-\n\n7    million-dollar checks and wire transfers having no apparent\n\n8    business purpose were exchanged between Madoff and his close\n\n9    friend, Norman Levy (now dead).\n\n10       In 2006, due diligence conducted by JPMorgan revealed\n\n11   strong and steady yields by Madoff’s feeder funds during a\n\n12   time when the S&P 100 dropped thirty percent.        As one money\n\n13   manager later acknowledged, that was too good to be true.\n\n14   In June 2007, JPMorgan’s Chief Risk Officer John Hogan\n\n15   learned at a lunch with JPMorgan money manager Matt Zames\n\n16   that “there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff\n\n17   and that his returns are speculated to be part of a [P]onzi\n\n18   scheme.”     A 695 ¶ 119.     Hogan asked a junior analyst to run\n\n19   a Google search on Madoff, and made no further inquiries\n\n20   when the search yielded no hard evidence.\n\n21       Faced with “numerous indications of Madoff’s fraud,” in\n\n22   the fall of 2008 JPMorgan redeemed $276 million of its\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\f1    investments in Madoff’s feeder funds.     A 705 ¶¶ 156-60; A\n\n2    710 ¶ 178.   But the company failed to tip off regulators or\n\n3    other investors.   Though JPMorgan was uniquely positioned to\n\n4    put an end to Madoff’s fraud, it quietly continued\n\n5    collecting its large fees.\n\n6        UBS and Access.   Defendants UBS AG6 (“UBS”) and Access\n\n7    International Advisors LLC7 (“Access”) are sued for aiding\n\n8    and abetting Madoff’s fraud by creating feeder funds and\n\n9    collecting investments from abroad.     UBS acted as sponsor,\n\n10   manager, administrator, custodian, and primary banker of the\n\n11   funds.   UBS reaped at least $80 million in fees as it\n\n12   facilitated investments in BLMIS, despite clear indicia of\n\n13   fraud.   The “prestigious name” of UBS was used “to\n\n14   legitimize and attract money to Madoff’s fraud,” but UBS\n\n          6\n            “UBS” includes UBS AG, UBS (Luxembourg) S.A., UBS\n     Fund Services (Luxembourg) S.A., UBS Third Party Management\n     Company S.A., Roger Hartmann, Ralf Schroter, Rene Egger,\n     Bernd Stiehl, Alain Hondequin, and Hermann Kranz.\n          7\n            “Access” includes Access International Advisors LLC,\n     Access International Advisors Europe Limited, Access\n     International Advisors Ltd., Access Partners (Suisse) S.A.,\n     Access Management Luxembourg S.A., Access Partners S.A.,\n     Patrick Littaye, Claudine Magnon de la Villehuchet (in her\n     capacities as Executrix and sole beneficiary of the Will of\n     Thierry Magnon de la Villehuchet), Pierre Delandmeter, and\n     Theodore Dumbauld. The Trustee also sues feeder funds\n     created by UBS and Access such as Defendants Luxalpha SICA V\n     and Groupement.\n\n\n                                   14\n\f1    agreed to “look the other way and to pretend that they were\n\n2    truly ensuring the existence of assets and trades when in\n\n3    fact they were not and never did.”     A 916 ¶ 5.\n\n4        UBS observed but ignored Madoff’s lack of transparency\n\n5    and his uncanny ability to generate consistently high\n\n6    returns, except insofar as UBS declined to invest its own\n\n7    money in BLMIS or endorse Madoff’s funds to its clients.\n\n8    In 2009, the Luxembourg regulator, the Commission de\n\n9    Surveillance du Secteur Financier, indicated that the\n\n10   failure of UBS to identify Madoff as a possible fraud was a\n\n11   violation of Luxembourg law.\n\n12       Access was also alerted to Madoff’s suspicious\n\n13   investment activities.     In 2006, internal managers at Access\n\n14   became worried about the volume of options trades being\n\n15   reported by Madoff, and hired an independent consultant to\n\n16   investigate.     The consultant concluded that Madoff could not\n\n17   possibly have executed the volume of options or equities\n\n18   trades he reported, and that his trading revealed “either\n\n19   extremely sloppy errors or serious omissions” that suggest\n\n20   he “doesn’t really understand the costs of the option\n\n21   strategy.”     A 977 ¶ 218 (emphasis removed).   Access\n\n22   concealed the consultant’s findings and continued active\n\n\n                                     15\n\f1    recruitment of investors for Madoff’s feeder funds in order\n\n2    to keep churning its fees.\n\n3        Unicredit.     Madoff’s fraud drew billions from abroad.\n\n4    With the help of UniCredit Bank Austria AG (“Bank Austria”)\n\n5    and 20:20 Medici AG (“Bank Medici”), one Sonja Kohn\n\n6    established several Madoff feeder funds (the “Medici\n\n7    Funds”).     Together, they funneled nearly $3 billion into\n\n8    BLMIS.     UniCredit S.p.A. and its two subsidiaries, Pioneer\n\n9    Alternative Investment Management Limited (“Pioneer”) and\n\n10   Bank Austria (collectively, the “UniCredit entities”),\n\n11   helped to promote the Medici Funds and thereby facilitated\n\n12   the fraud.\n\n13       The UniCredit entities and their affiliates made a lot\n\n14   of money servicing the Medici funds: Bank Medici took more\n\n15   than $15 million in fees; and BA Worldwide, more than $68\n\n16   million.     The UniCredit entities were well aware that\n\n17   Madoff’s returns were highly suspicious, and that the extent\n\n18   of BLMIS’s trading activities was facially impossible.        Yet\n\n19   they continued to aggressively market the Madoff feeder\n\n20   funds to new customers while purporting to provide\n\n21   oversight.     Among the signs overlooked by the UniCredit\n\n22   entities were Madoff’s failure to identify counterparties to\n\n\n                                     16\n\f1    BLMIS’s options transactions, BLMIS’s atypical fee\n\n2    structure, and Madoff’s impossibly high volume of\n\n3    transactions.   Shortly after Madoff’s arrest, a senior\n\n4    research analyst at Pioneer wrote, “[w]e should be the\n\n5    professionals protecting investors from this fraud . . .\n\n6    [but] there is not one [due diligence] report in the files\n\n7    except for one in May 2005.”   A 136 ¶ 314 (brackets in\n\n8    original).\n\n9        HSBC.    HSBC Bank plc (“HSBC”)8 established Madoff\n\n10   feeder funds (at least eighteen in seven different\n\n11   countries) that injected capital into the Ponzi scheme while\n\n12   ignoring obvious warning signs.     As custodian and\n\n13   administrator of the funds, HSBC was required to hold the\n\n14   fund assets and handle day-to-day operations.     HSBC also\n\n15   created derivative products, such as notes and swaps, to\n\n16   increase the flow of investment.     These funds fed at least\n\n\n\n          8\n            The HSBC Defendants include HSBC Bank plc, HSBC\n     Holdings plc, HSBC Securities Services (Luxembourg) S.A.,\n     HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Ireland) Limited, HSBC\n     Securities Services (Ireland) Limited, HSBC Institutional\n     Trust Services (Bermuda) Limited, HSBC Bank USA, N.A., HSBC\n     Securities Services (Bermuda) Limited, HSBC Bank (Cayman)\n     Limited, HSBC Private Banking Holdings (Suisse) S.A., HSBC\n     Private Bank (Suisse) S.A., HSBC Fund Services (Luxembourg)\n     S.A., and HSBC Bank Bermuda Limited.\n\n\n                                    17\n\f1    $8.9 billion into Madoff’s scheme, a sum representing nearly\n\n2    forty percent of BLMIS’s capital under management.\n\n3        HSBC represented to customers that it exercised\n\n4    supervision and control over fund assets, whereas BLMIS\n\n5    itself took the role of custodian.      Had HSBC performed\n\n6    oversight diligently, it would have seen thousands of\n\n7    instances in which Madoff’s purported trades exceeded the\n\n8    total market volume of such trades on the given day.\n\n9    Repeatedly, industry analysts and HSBC’s own due diligence\n\n10   team openly questioned Madoff’s extraordinary success, lack\n\n11   of transparency, and incredible trading volume.\n\n12       In September 2005, HSBC commissioned KPMG LLP to detect\n\n13   potential fraud in BLMIS’s operations.      Resulting reports in\n\n14   2006 and 2008 warned that BLMIS’s role as custodian of its\n\n15   own funds posed a risk that the trades were “a sham in order\n\n16   to divert client cash.”   A 89 ¶ 168.     Nonetheless, HSBC\n\n17   continued to “enable[]” Madoff in order to reap a windfall.\n\n18   A 35 ¶ 1.   In sum, HSBC “engineered a labyrinth of hedge\n\n19   funds, management companies, and service providers that, to\n\n20   unsuspecting outsiders, seemed to compose a formidable\n\n21   system of checks and balances,” yet, in reality, “it\n\n22   provided different modes for directing money to Madoff while\n\n23   avoiding scrutiny and maximizing fees.”      A 36 ¶ 4.\n\n                                   18\n\f1        Procedural History.    On July 15, 2009, the Trustee\n\n2    commenced an adversary proceeding in the United States\n\n3    Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York\n\n4    against HSBC and thirty-six others, including UniCredit and\n\n5    Pioneer.9   The Amended Complaint sought recovery of $2\n\n6    billion in preferential or fraudulent transfers (Counts 1\n\n7    through 19), and asserted four common law causes of action:\n\n8    aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of\n\n9    fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and money had and\n\n10   received (collectively, the “common law claims”).   These\n\n11   common law claims sought $6.6 billion from HSBC and $2\n\n12   billion from the remaining defendants.   A contribution claim\n\n13   was asserted under New York law.\n\n14       On a motion by the UniCredit entities, the district\n\n15   court withdrew the reference to the bankruptcy court, for\n\n16   the limited purpose of deciding two threshold issues: (1)\n\n17   the Trustee’s standing to assert the common law claims, and\n\n18   (2) preemption of these claims by the Securities Litigation\n\n19   Uniform Standards Act (“SLUSA”).\n\n20       The common law claims and the contribution claim were\n\n21   dismissed by Judge Rakoff in July 2011, on the grounds that\n\n\n          9\n            This proceeding consolidated two actions, one against\n     HSBC and one against UniCredit and Pioneer.\n                                   19\n\f1    the Trustee was in pari delicto with the defendants, lacked\n\n2    standing to assert the common law claims on customers’\n\n3    behalf, and could not demonstrate a right to contribution.\n\n4    See Picard v. HSBC Bank PLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2192354\"><a href=\"/opinion/2192354/picard-v-hsbc-bank-plc/\"><span class=\"volume\">454</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 37 (S.D.N.Y.\n\n5    2011).    The court did not reach the question whether SLUSA\n\n6    bars the Trustee’s claims.    Id.\n\n7        The Trustee’s adversary proceeding against JPMorgan was\n\n8    commenced in December 2010.    As in the proceedings against\n\n9    HSBC and UniCredit, the Trustee asserted common law claims\n\n10   seeking $19 billion for, inter alia, aiding and abetting\n\n11   fraud, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, unjust\n\n12   enrichment, and conversion.\n\n13       The adversary proceeding against UBS followed.    Also\n\n14   named were Access, several of its affiliates, and two feeder\n\n15   funds.    Again, the Trustee asserted common law claims for\n\n16   aiding and abetting fraud, aiding and abetting breach of\n\n17   fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and conversion, among\n\n18   others.    Damages of approximately $2 billion were sought on\n\n19   behalf of the customers of BLMIS (rather than BLMIS itself).\n\n20       All Defendants (except Luxalpha and two individual\n\n21   Defendants) moved to dismiss the common law claims and the\n\n22   contribution claim.    In November 2011, Judge McMahon granted\n\n23   the motions.    See Picard v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span>\n\n                                    <span class=\"page\">20</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f1    84 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).     Judge McMahon concluded (as did Judge\n\n2    Rakoff) that the Trustee lacks standing to bring an action\n\n3    on behalf of third parties and has no valid claim for\n\n4    contribution.

Third, Redington involved claims against a single\n\n8    accounting firm for a few discrete instances of alleged\n\n9    misconduct (the preparation of misleading financial\n\n10   statements).    As a result, the policy concerns we express\n\n11   below (see infra pp. 59-69) would have been considerably\n\n12   diminished--and, indeed, were not even addressed by the\n\n13   Court.     Fourth, and finally, in Redington the brokerage firm\n\n14   was not complicit in the wrongdoing, but rather “an entity\n\n15   distinct from its conniving officers [that] was directly\n\n16   damaged by Touche Ross’ unsatisfactory audit.”     592 F.2d at\n\n17   620.

However, the holding of that case has\n\n7    no application here.\n\n8        PepsiCo had been guarantor of bonds issued by a\n\n9    subsidiary that later was acquired by a subsidiary of Banner\n\n10   Industries.    When the (later) merged entity defaulted on the\n\n11   bonds, PepsiCo sued Banner, alleging diversion of assets and\n\n12   alter ego.    The merged entity went bankrupt, and the trustee\n\n13   sued Banner for misappropriation.    We ruled that the\n\n14   trustee--and not PepsiCo--could pursue Banner because Ohio\n\n15   law allowed a subsidiary to assert an alter ego claim\n\n16   against its parent, so that “[t]he cause of action therefore\n\n17   becomes property of the estate of a bankrupt subsidiary, and\n\n18   is properly asserted by the trustee in bankruptcy.”      Id. at\n\n19   703-04.\n\n20       Picard directs us to a passage in St. Paul--stating\n\n21   that a trustee may bring a claim if the “claim is a general\n\n22   one, with no particularized injury arising from it, and if\n\n\n                                    40\n\f1    that claim could be brought by any creditor of the debtor,”\n\n2    id. at 701--and contends that the third-party claims here\n\n3    are common to all customers because all customers were\n\n4    similarly injured by Madoff’s fraud and the Defendants’\n\n5    facilitation.    This argument is flawed on many levels:\n\n6        •    St. Paul decided the “specific question” whether a\n\n7    creditor may bring an alter ego claim against the debtor’s\n\n8    parent when the debtor itself also possesses such a claim.\n\n9    Id. at 699.     But Picard seeks to assert claims that are\n\n10   property only of the creditors, not of the debtor.\n\n11       •    The Trustee’s broad reading of St. Paul would\n\n12   bring the Court’s holding into conflict with a line of cases\n\n13   that came before and after it.       As discussed supra pp. 32-\n\n14   34, it is settled that a trustee may not assert creditors’\n\n15   claims against third parties.        See, e.g., Shearson Lehman\n\n16   Hutton, Inc. v.

As illustrated by St.\n\n13   Paul, when a creditor seeks relief against third parties\n\n14   that pushed the debtor into bankruptcy, the creditor is\n\n15   asserting a derivative claim that arises from harm done to\n\n16   the estate.   Judge Posner described this distinction:\n\n17            The point is simply that the trustee is confined\n18            to enforcing entitlements of the corporation. He\n19            has no right to enforce entitlements of a\n20            creditor. He represents the unsecured creditors\n21            of the corporation; and in that sense when he is\n22            suing on behalf of the corporation he is really\n23            suing on behalf of the creditors of the\n24            corporation. But there is a difference between a\n25            creditor’s interest in the claims of the\n26            corporation against a third party, which are\n27            enforced by the trustee, and the creditor’s own\n28            direct--not derivative--claim against the third\n\n                                   42\n\f1                  party, which only the creditor himself can\n2                  enforce.\n3\n4    Steinberg v.

Picard, however, seeks to assert claims on behalf of\n\n12   thousands of customers against third-party financial\n\n13   institutions for their handling of individual investments\n\n14   made on various dates in varying amounts.       The Defendants’\n\n15   alleged wrongful acts, then, could not have harmed all\n\n16   customers in the same way.20\n\n            20\n            A recent case arising out of the BLMIS bankruptcy\n     provides a useful contrast.

The\n     customer claims were “duplicative and derivative of the\n     Trustee’s fraudulent transfer claim.” Id. at 479 n.2.\n     Accordingly, the court found the claims to be “general” in\n     the sense articulated in St. Paul, in that they arose from\n     “a single set of actions that harmed BLMIS and all BLMIS\n     customers in the same way.” Id. at 480. Here, however, the\n     customers’ claims are not derivative of claims held by the\n     BLMIS estate.\n\n\n                                       43\n\f1                                   B\n\n2        The Trustee attempts to blunt the force of Caplin and\n\n3    its progeny by arguing that a SIPA liquidation is unique and\n\n4    is therefore not controlled by precedent under the\n\n5    bankruptcy code.

We disagree.\n\n16       First, the statute is not written or cast in terms of\n\n17   bailment.   “To the extent consistent with the provisions of\n\n18   this chapter, a liquidation proceeding shall be conducted in\n\n19   accordance with, and as though it were being conducted under\n\n20   [the Bankruptcy Code].”   15 U.S.C. § 78fff(b).   As a general\n\n21   rule, SIPA vests trustees with “the same powers and title\n\n22   with respect to the debtor and the property of the debtor\n\n\n                                    44\n\f1    . . . as a trustee in a case under Title 11.”        15 U.S.C. §\n\n2    78fff-1(a).   True, a SIPA trustee has some powers not\n\n3    conferred on a trustee under Title 11.        Most notably, SIPA\n\n4    creates a fund of customer property that is separate from\n\n5    the debtor estate and that has priority over other\n\n6    creditors’ claims, and authorizes the trustee to ratably\n\n7    distribute those funds based on customers’ net equity.

But the statute does not\n\n11   confer upon SIPA trustees a power, denied all other\n\n12   bankruptcy trustees, to sue third parties on claims that\n\n13   belong to persons other than the estate.        Nowhere does the\n\n14   statute reference bailment, or characterize customers as\n\n15   “bailors” or trustees as “bailees,” or in any way indicate\n\n16   that the trustee is acting as bailee of customer property.\n\n17       Picard alternatively invokes the principle of bailment\n\n18   under the common law.   This is dubious: courts are careful\n\n19   to avoid overlaying common law principles onto a statutory\n\n20   framework, even when (unlike here) the statute makes clear\n\n21   reference to common law.

A bailment is “a delivery\n\n8    of personalty for some particular purpose, or on mere\n\n9    deposit, upon a contract express or implied, that after the\n\n10   purpose has been fulfilled it will be redelivered to the\n\n11   person who delivered it, or otherwise dealt with according\n\n12   to that person’s directions, or kept until it is reclaimed.”\n\n13   9 N.Y.

So: any\n\n\n\n                                    46\n\f1    supposed bailment pre-dated Picard’s appointment; he was not\n\n2    entrusted with any customer property until after it had been\n\n3    impaired; and he never had control over the missing funds\n\n4    that he now seeks to recoup.     He therefore is not the proper\n\n5    party to bring such an action.      See 9 N.Y. Jur. 2d Bailments\n\n6    and Chattel Leases § 115 (West 2013) (explaining that bailee\n\n7    may only “bring an action to recover for the loss of or\n\n8    injury to the bailed property while in his or her\n\n9    possession”).21\n\n10       Moreover, Picard is not seeking to recover specific\n\n11   bailments for return to individual bailors.     See 9 N.Y. Jur.\n\n12   2d Bailments and Chattel Leases § 82 (West 2013) (“One of\n\n13   the most important rights of the bailor is that, on the\n\n14   termination of the bailment, the bailor will return to him\n\n15   or her the identical thing bailed . . . .”).     Unlike\n\n16   “customer name securities,” which are separately held and\n\n17   returned to individual customers outside the normal\n\n18   distribution scheme,22 Picard’s claims are intended to\n\n          21\n            Judge McMahon likened the Trustee’s position to that\n     of a parking garage attendant who is handed the keys to a\n     car that was recently in an accident and decides to sue the\n     culpable party on the owner’s behalf. See Picard v.\n     JPMorgan Chase & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2194317\"><a href=\"/opinion/2194317/picard-v-jpmorgan-chase-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104-05 (S.D.N.Y. 2011).\n          22\n            See 15 U.S.C. § 78lll(4) (excluding “customer name\n     securities delivered to the customer” from definition of\n                                    47\n\f1    augment the general fund of customer property so that it can\n\n2    be distributed ratably based on customers’ net equity.     This\n\n3    arrangement is not an analog to a bailment, in which the\n\n4    bailee is entrusted with an item that is to be recovered by\n\n5    the bailor at some later time.\n\n6        SIPC urges that we view the transaction as though\n\n7    BLMIS, not the Trustee, acted as the bailee of customer\n\n8    property, and that the Trustee is simply acting on BLMIS’s\n\n9    behalf to recover the bailed property.   The short answer is\n\n10   that Madoff (and, by extension, BLMIS) took the investment\n\n11   money from the customers in order to defraud them--and a\n\n12   thief is not a bailee of stolen property.

This contrast, and\n     its ramifications, are illuminated by SIPC’s own statements\n     to Congress regarding the passage of the 1978 amendments to\n     SIPA. SIPC’s then-Chairman, Hugh F. Owens, explained that\n     customer name securities “will be treated, in short, as\n     though they are not part of the debtor’s estate, but merely\n     held by the debtor as bailee”--implying that most other\n     commingled property, such as cash, would simply become part\n     of the debtor’s estate.

Notwithstanding Madoff’s pretense, he\n\n5    failed to maintain customers’ investments in separate named\n\n6    accounts.     He deposited all customer funds into a general\n\n7    account (the 703 Account) and distributed those new\n\n8    investments to earlier customers in lieu of actual returns.\n\n9    This arrangement, which enabled the fraud, made a bailment\n\n10   impossible.

The inferences are strained at best.\n\n4   Federal common law, which does not speak to the powers of a\n\n5   SIPA trustee, offers no useful insight.24   Nor do the\n\n6   Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.25\n\n7                                 2\n\n8       The Trustee argues that, because SIPC advanced funds to\n\n9   customers at the outset of the liquidation, SIPC is\n\n         24\n           SIPC suggests that it is appropriate to resort to\n    federal common law where a significant conflict exists\n    between state and federal law and where the need for\n    uniformity in the treatment of brokerage customers is\n    paramount. But no legal authority is offered to support the\n    application of federal common law here. And there is no\n    evident conflict between New York bailment law (on the one\n    hand) and (on the other) SIPA, Rule 15c, or some broader\n    federal policy.\n         25\n           The Trustee invokes Rule 17, which allows a bailee\n    to sue “in [his] own name[] without joining the person for\n    whose benefit the action is brought.” Fed.

But SIPC is a creature of statute, and\n\n5    neither the plain language of the statute, nor its\n\n6    legislative history, supports the Trustee’s position.\n\n7        True, a SIPA trustee (unlike a trustee in bankruptcy),\n\n8    advances money to pay claims.        The statute takes this fact\n\n9    into account by subrogating SIPC to customers’ net equity\n\n10   claims to the extent of the advances they received.           But it\n\n11   goes no further.\n\n12       The Trustee’s subrogation theory is premised in\n\n13   § 78fff-3(a):\n\n14            To the extent moneys are advanced by SIPC to the\n15            trustee to pay or otherwise satisfy the claims of\n16            customers, in addition to all other rights it may\n17            have at law or in equity, SIPC shall be subrogated\n18            to the claims of such customers with the rights\n19            and priorities provided in this chapter, except\n20            that SIPC as subrogee may assert no claim against\n21            customer property until after the allocation\n22            thereof to customers as provided in section 78fff-\n23            2(c) of this title.\n24\n25   15 U.S.C. § 78fff-3(a).    It is undisputed that the phrase\n\n26   “claims of customers” refers (as throughout the statute) to\n\n27   customers’ net equity claims against the estate.

As we emphasized earlier, SIPA\n\n13   grants trustees the “same powers and title with respect to\n\n14   the debtor and the property of the debtor” as a Title 11\n\n15   trustee, 15 U.S.C. § 78fff-1(a), and the Supreme Court has\n\n16   squarely rejected attempts by Title 11 trustees to capture\n\n17   such litigation, see Caplin v.

As a final resort, the\n\n19   Trustee relies on a catch-all provision included in the 1978\n\n20   amendments to SIPA, which states that the subrogation rights\n\n21   afforded by § 78fff-3(a) should not be read to diminish “all\n\n22   other rights [SIPC] may have at law or in equity.”    15\n\n\n\n                                   53\n\f1    U.S.C. § 78fff-3(a).    From here, the Trustee claims an\n\n2    implied right of equitable subrogation, “the principle by\n\n3    which an insurer, having paid losses of its insured, is\n\n4    placed in the position of its insured so that it may recover\n\n5    from the third party legally responsible for the loss.”\n\n6    Winkelmann v.

He thus claims a wide grant of authority to initiate\n\n8    class-action lawsuits and assert any number of tort claims\n\n9    against third parties on customers’ behalf.26   This is a\n\n10   long, long reach.\n\n11       There is no sign that Congress intended an expansive\n\n12   increment of power to SIPA trustees.    In 1973, the SIPC\n\n13   chairman appointed a Special Task Force to consider possible\n\n14   amendments to the 1970 Act.    The resulting July 1974 report\n\n15   separately listed its “major policy recommendations” and its\n\n16   proposed “technical refinements.”    See Report to the Board\n\n17   of Directors of SIPC of the Special Task Force to Consider\n\n18   Possible Amendments to SIPA, Letter of Transmittal (July 31,\n\n19   1974).    Recommendation II.A.9, deemed a “Major Policy\n\n20   Recommendation,” states that “claims of SIPC as subrogee\n\n21   (except as otherwise provided), should be allowable only as\n\n          26\n            We use the term “class-action lawsuits” loosely\n     here, without taking a position on the SLUSA question.\n                                    54\n\f1    claims against the general estate.”        Id. at 12 (emphasis\n\n2    added); see also SIPA Amendments of 1975: Hearings on H.R.\n\n3    8064 Before the Subcomm. on Consumer Protection and Fin. of\n\n4    the H.

See, e.g., Winkelmann, 650 N.E.2d at 843.\n\n13       But this argument succumbs to the same critique as\n\n14   Picard’s bailment theory: We avoid engrafting common law\n\n15   principles onto a statutory scheme unless Congress’s intent\n\n16   is manifest.   See supra p. 46.     The clearest Congressional\n\n17   intent here is that we should treat SIPA as a bankruptcy\n\n18   statute, not as an insurance scheme.     “SIPA and FDIA are\n\n19   independent statutory schemes, enacted to serve the unique\n\n20   needs of the banking and securities industries,\n\n21   respectively.”28   SIPC v.

But it is not\n     obvious why customers cannot bring their own suits against\n     the Defendants. In fact, the Defendants make clear that\n     customers have already filed such actions. See, e.g., MLSMK\n     Inv. Co. v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., 431 F. App’x 17 (2d Cir.\n     2011) (summary order); Shapiro v. JP Morgan Chase & Co., No.\n     11-CV-8331 (S.D.N.Y.); Hill v.

As in Redington, “the customers on\n     whose behalf the Trustee seeks to maintain suit are not only\n                                     57\n\f1    advantages to the course Picard wants to follow.     But equity\n\n2    has its limits; it may fill certain gaps in a statute, but\n\n3    it should not be used to enlarge substantive rights and\n\n4    powers.   Cf. In re Ozark, 816 F.2d at 1230 (observing that\n\n5    while Bankruptcy Code allows a court to apply equitable\n\n6    principles when necessary, “[t]hese powers . . . do not\n\n7    include the ability to award equitable relief where the\n\n8    party asserting the cause of action for such relief does not\n\n9    have standing under any other section of the Code”).\n\n10       As the Supreme Court observed, “SIPC’s theory of\n\n11   subrogation is fraught with unanswered questions.”       Holmes\n\n12   v.

Caplin, 406 U.S. at 431.    Can a SIPA trustee\n\n4    control customers’ claims against third parties if SIPC has\n\n5    not fully satisfied the customers’ claims against the\n\n6    estate?     How would inconsistent judgments be avoided, given\n\n7    that “independent actions are still likely because it is\n\n8    extremely doubtful that [the parties] would agree on the\n\n9    amount of damages to seek, or even on the theory on which to\n\n10   sue”?     Id. at 432.   Who would be bound by a settlement\n\n11   entered into by either the Trustee or by each customer who\n\n12   brings suit?     Id.    The size and scope of the litigation here\n\n13   only amplify these concerns.\n\n14       As Caplin advises, it is better to leave these\n\n15   intractable policy judgments to Congress:\n\n16               Congress might well decide that reorganizations\n17               have not fared badly in the 34 years since Chapter\n18               X was enacted and that the status quo is\n19               preferable to inviting new problems by making\n20               changes in the system. Or, Congress could\n21               determine that the trustee . . . was so well\n22               situated for bringing suits . . . that he should\n23               be permitted to do so. In this event, Congress\n24               might also determine that the trustee’s action was\n25               exclusive, or that it should be brought as a class\n26               action on behalf of all [creditors], or perhaps\n27               even that the [creditors] should have the option\n28               of suing on their own or having the trustee sue on\n29               their behalf. Any number of alternatives are\n\n                                       59\n\f1            available. Congress would also be able to answer\n2            questions regarding subrogation or timing of law\n3            suits before these questions arise in the context\n4            of litigation.
