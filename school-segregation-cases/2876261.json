Pemberton\nand Finn also appeal their sentences. We affirm the judgments of the District Court.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Michael J. Davis, United States District Judge for the District\nof Minnesota.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                          I.\n\n       Because of the complexity of this case and the many fact-specific arguments\nraised by the defendants, we relate the facts of this case in somewhat more detail than\nis customary. Pemberton, Brown, and Finn are enrolled members of the Band. This\ntale begins in 1985, when Pemberton was secretary-treasurer of the Leech Lake\nReservation Business Committee (LLRBC), the five-member governing body of the\nBand.2 At the time, Brown was one of three district representatives on the LLRBC, and\nFinn was the Band's legal counsel.3\n\n       Before 1985, the Band routinely purchased property-casualty and liability\ninsurance to cover the risks associated with several buildings owned by the Band and\nseveral businesses operated by the LLRBC on behalf of the Band. In 1985, however,\na crisis in the insurance market threatened to make insurance too expensive for the\nBand to afford; the only company willing even to quote a premium for the year\nbeginning July 1, 1985 would have increased the previous year's property-casualty\npremium from $122,000 to $254,000 and the previous liability premium from $31,000\nto $187,000. Because of the prohibitive cost, the Band went without insurance for a\ntime in 1985.\n\n      At a meeting of the LLRBC on October 1, 1985, Finn and an LLRBC staff\nmember presented a possible solution. As Finn described it, the Band could \"self-\ninsure\" by depositing funds annually in a segregated bank account and paying claims\n\n\n      2\n      The LLRBC was later renamed the Tribal Council, an appellation that more\nappropriately reflects its purpose.\n      3\n       Finn had been secretary-treasurer of the LLRBC in the 1970s, before he\nattended law school. Brown was elected chairman of the LLRBC in 1988. Pemberton\nremained secretary-treasurer until 1990, when he lost an election, but he was elected\nchairman in 1992.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fout of that account. Several individuals present at the October 1 meeting testified that\nFinn stated that the Band would own any funds not used to pay claims, as is typical of\nself-insurance programs. Finn suggested that he administer the program by collecting\nthe contributions and managing the payment of claims. Witnesses disagreed whether\nFinn proposed to retain a portion of the contributions as an administrative fee or\nwhether he would render his services pursuant to his retainer agreement with the Band.\nBecause of the possibility that the Band might suffer a large loss in the early years of\nthe plan, before any significant reserves could be developed, Finn suggested that the\nLLRBC purchase excess insurance coverage from a traditional insurance company.\nThe LLRBC voted unanimously to approve the self-insurance program as described by\nFinn, and adopted a resolution establishing a corporation named Reservation Risk\nManagement, Inc. (RRM) as \"a corporate sub-entity of the Leech Lake Reservation\nBusiness Committee.\" LLRBC Resolution No. 86-26 (Oct. 1, 1985). RRM's charter\nstated that the company was formed under the authority of the Minnesota Chippewa\nTribe (of which the Leech Lake Band is one of six constituent bands) to manage the\nBand's self-insurance program.\n\n       During the next few weeks, it became apparent that insurance companies were\nunwilling to provide excess insurance coverage to the Band at affordable rates. Finn\nreported this development at an LLRBC meeting on October 29. At that meeting, the\nLLRBC voted nevertheless to proceed with the self-insurance program, which was to\nbe administered by RRM, and the LLRBC authorized its chairman and secretary-\ntreasurer to execute the necessary documents. Throughout the next several months,\nseveral key documents were executed by LLRBC Chairman Hartley White and\nPemberton on behalf of the LLRBC and by Finn on behalf of RRM. For ease of\nreference, we will refer to these documents as the Subscription Agreement, the\nDebenture Agreement, the Shareholders' Agreement, and the Insurance Agreement.\nWhite testified that he did not believe that all of his purported signatures on these\ndocuments were genuine, and he clearly stated that he did not understand the import\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fof any of these agreements when he signed them. Instead, he relied on the advice of\nFinn, whom he considered to be a trustworthy and loyal member of the Band.\n\n       The Subscription Agreement gave 25% of the shares in RRM to the LLRBC and\n75% of the shares to Finn. In the Debenture Agreement, Finn and his law partner,\nKimball Mattson, pledged to tender as much as $450,000 to RRM if necessary to avoid\na shortfall in \"Fund C,\" the fund from which RRM was to pay claims. RRM was\nobligated to repay any sums advanced by Finn and Mattson, who also had the option\nto cancel the agreement on ninety days' notice and receive 20% interest per annum on\nany balance owed to them by RRM. In exchange for their standby promises to\ncontribute to RRM, Finn and Mattson were to receive 15% of the premiums collected\nby RRM. The Debenture Agreement was executed by Finn on his own behalf and on\nbehalf of RRM; the LLRBC was not a party to this contract.\n\n       The Shareholders' Agreement between the LLRBC and Finn described the\ninternal workings of RRM. Fifteen percent of premiums received were to be deposited\nin Fund A and paid annually to debenture holders, as described above. The other 85%\nof each premium payment was to go into Fund B, to be used for operating expenses,\nwhich Finn had previously estimated at $100,000 per year. Any excess in Fund B was\nto be regularly transferred to Fund C, from which claims would be paid. The\nShareholders' Agreement stated that the \"reserves in Fund C shall belong to the\nshareholders of RRM\" but were not to be distributed to the shareholders except on the\ndissolution of RRM. Shareholders' Agreement ¶ 3(b) (Jan. 14, 1986). In addition, if\nthe LLRBC withdrew from the insurance program any time before October 31, 1990,\nthe LLRBC would forfeit any claim to the assets of RRM, and those assets would be\ndistributed among the other shareholders.\n\n      The Insurance Agreement set up a ten-year insurance program at premiums\nbeginning at $300,000 per year and escalating to $450,000 per year (subject to upward\nadjustment if deemed necessary by the directors of RRM). RRM agreed to seat two\n\n                                         -5-\n\fpersons nominated by the LLRBC on the board of directors of RRM. Pursuant to this\nagreement, RRM issued to the LLRBC an insurance policy providing on its face more\nthan $8 million in property-casualty coverage and $300,000 in liability coverage.\n\n       The government's risk-management expert testified that, in combination, these\ndocuments created a program that was neither insurance (because RRM did not assume\nthe risk of loss) nor self-insurance (because persons other than the LLRBC had\nownership interests in funds remaining after the payment of losses). In particular, the\nexpert testified, the Shareholders' Agreement \"essentially took the Band money and\ngave it to Mr. Finn.\" Tr. at 475. To demonstrate the workings of the program, she\ncalculated what would have happened if the RRM arrangement had lasted one year,\nduring which the LLRBC suffered no losses, and Finn had waived the forfeiture\nprovision and allowed the LLRBC to retain its equity despite the early cancellation.\nThe LLRBC would have paid $300,000 to RRM, of which 15% ($45,000) would have\ngone to Finn and his partner pursuant to the Debenture Agreement and another\n$100,000 (or 33%) would have gone to administrative expenses (essentially to Finn,\nhis firm, and RRM's board members). Of the $155,000 remaining in Fund C, the\nLLRBC would receive one-fourth ($38,750) when the program was cancelled. Thus,\neven without any claims or losses (i.e., the best-case scenario from the perspective of\nthe LLRBC), the LLRBC would receive only 13% of its payment back at the end of the\nyear. Not surprisingly, then, the expert concluded that \"[t]he RRM documents\neffectively deprive the Band of what the benefits of self-insurance should have been\"\nand that \"the terms of the transaction as a whole were commercially unreasonable in\nthe realm of self-insurance, risk management and insurance.\" Tr. at 453-54.\n\n       In January 1987, the LLRBC appointed Pemberton and Brown as its two\nrepresentatives on the board of RRM. Shortly thereafter, Pemberton was elected\nsecretary-treasurer and Brown vice-president of RRM. (Finn previously had been\nnamed president and was a board member.) Finn's wife and Pemberton's wife also\nwere elected to the five-member board, and each of them gave a proxy to Finn, giving\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhim effective control of the company. Finn soon transferred some of his equity\nownership of RRM to Pemberton and Brown in exchange for their investment of\n$18,000 and $12,000, respectively, giving Pemberton approximately 7% and Brown\napproximately 5% ownership of the company.4\n\n       Later in 1987, an auditor began to audit the Band on behalf of the Department\nof the Interior for fiscal year 1986. RRM immediately became an issue because the\nLLRBC's October 1985 resolution established the company as a tribal entity, which\nwould require it to be included in the audit. When the auditor wrote to Pemberton\nseeking more information about RRM, Finn responded with a letter stating that RRM\nwas chartered by the state of Minnesota and that the LLRBC owned only 25% of the\ncompany. (In fact, Finn had organized a state-chartered corporation under the name\n\"Reservation Risk Management, Inc.,\" a corporation that was evidently inactive. When\nwe refer to \"RRM,\" however, we mean the tribally-chartered company.) The auditor\ninquired further of Pemberton whether any of the Band's elected officials stood to\nbenefit from the Band's association with RRM. Again, Finn responded: \"Please be\nadvised that the Leech Lake Reservation elected officials do not stand to profit from\nits association with RRM, Inc.\" Letter from Finn to auditor of Mar. 3, 1988. After\nsome further jousting with Finn, the auditor gave up on RRM and did not include the\ncompany in his audit. When the auditor and his partners later had second thoughts,\nthey sent a representation letter to the LLRBC, asking the members to sign if they\nagreed with certain statements, including the following: \"All prior [LLRBC]\nresolutions establishing some type of control over RRM by the Leech Lake RBC have\nbeen rescinded. There are no RBC elected officials who exercise control or who share\nin the profits of RRM.\" Letter from auditor to LLRBC officials of Jan. 11, 1989.\nBrown and Pemberton signed the letter.\n\n      4\n       The parties dispute the source of the funds invested, but it does not matter\nwhether the $30,000 came from accrued leave owed to Pemberton and Brown (as they\nclaim) or from the Band's landfill trust account (as the government claims). Regardless,\nPemberton and Brown invested in RRM and received equity stakes.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       In 1989, the Bureau of Indian Affairs notified the Band of fraudulent practices\ninvolving insurance companies and warned that in the future, all insurance companies\ndoing business with Indian tribes would have to be licensed by the relevant state\ngovernment. Accordingly, the LLRBC decided to end its arrangements with RRM. Of\nthe approximately $2 million collected by RRM since its establishment, the LLRBC\nreceived about $850,000 in a complicated series of transactions when the company was\ndissolved. During the life of RRM, it paid only $61,000 in insurance claims, while Finn\ntook hundreds of thousands of dollars out of the company--some for cash and some to\npurchase items such as cars, boats, golf carts, professional football and baseball\ntickets, and real estate. All three defendants also received thousands of dollars in fees\nfor serving on the board of directors of RRM.\n\n        As RRM was finally dissolved in mid-1990, Finn distributed considerable sums\nto the defendants. On May 2, 1990, Finn purchased an annuity for the benefit of Brown\nin the amount of $43,500; Brown later applied for a cash payout of 10% of the annuity\nand received the payout in October. On June 25, 1990, Finn distributed $62,000 to\nPemberton, $199,547.10 to Mattson (Finn's law partner), and $286,000 to himself. Ten\ndays later, Finn paid himself another $50,000.\n\n       In November 1990, a federal grand jury began investigating RRM. A federal\nagent served Finn with a grand jury subpoena in January 1991 at the Minnesota capitol\nbuilding, where Finn had just been sworn in as the first Native American elected to the\nstate Senate. Finn eventually was charged by information in 1994 with a misdemeanor\ncount of misapplying tribal funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1163 (1988). Finn\npleaded guilty, but when he was disappointed in the sentencing court's assessment of\nthe sentencing factors, he exercised his right, pursuant to his plea agreement, to\nwithdraw the guilty plea.\n\n       On June 7, 1995, the grand jury returned the indictment that began this case.\nFinn, Pemberton, and Brown were charged with one count of conspiracy, in violation\n\n                                          -8-\n\fof 18 U.S.C. § 371 (1988), and, in varying combinations, with nine counts of felony\ntheft or misapplication of tribal funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1163; four counts of\ntheft concerning a program receiving federal funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666\n(1988); one count of bribery concerning a program receiving federal funds, in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. § 666; five counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957\n(1988); three counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1346 (1988 &\nSupp. II 1990); two counts of making a false statement, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1001 (1988); and one count of obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503\n(1988).\n\n       After a seventeen-day trial, a jury convicted all three defendants of conspiracy.\nIn addition, Finn was convicted of four counts of theft or misapplication of tribal funds,\nfour counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds, and three counts of\nmail fraud; Pemberton was convicted of one count of theft or misapplication of tribal\nfunds and one count of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds. The District\nCourt sentenced Finn to fifty-seven months in prison, fined him $25,000, and ordered\nhim to pay restitution of $400,000 to the Band. Pemberton was sentenced to thirty-\nthree months in prison and ordered to repay $66,430 to the Band. Brown was placed\non probation for two years, including one year of home detention, fined $7500, and\nordered to pay restitution of $31,412.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      Of the many points raised by the defendants on appeal, we consider first several\noverarching arguments that attack the heart of the government's case.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f                                           A.\n\n        The parties agree that all of the crimes charged in this case are subject to the\nfive-year limitation period of 18 U.S.C. § 3282 (1988). The defendants argue that\n§ 3282 bars this prosecution. On its face, this argument appears specious, for all of the\ncounts on which the defendants were convicted involve conduct occurring on or after\nJune 13, 1990, less than five years before the date of the indictment. (For mail fraud,\nthe relevant date is the date of the mailing. See, e.g., United States v. Eisen, 974 F.2d\n246, 263 (2d Cir. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 998, 1029 (1993); United States v.\nDunn, 961 F.2d 648, 650 (7th Cir. 1992). For conspiracy, the relevant date is the date\nof the last overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. See United States v. Rabinowitz,\n56 F.3d 932, 933 (8th Cir. 1995).)\n\n       The defendants argue, however, that if there was wrongdoing in this case, it\noccurred when Finn induced the LLRBC to set up the self-insurance plan that gave him\na 75% stake in the proceeds; in other words, according to the defendants, this is a case\nof fraudulent inducement. Any theft or misapplication, the argument continues,\noccurred at the latest in 1989, when the LLRBC made its last payment to RRM. After\nthat point, the defendants could not have stolen or misapplied RRM's funds, for they\nowned RRM. (Actually, they owned only three-quarters of RRM, but the defendants\nfinesse this point by arguing that they kept less than three-fourths of RRM's assets\nwhen the company was wound up.)\n\n       This argument misses the point that the government's theory of the case, a theory\nthe evidence supports, was that the documents purportedly signed by White on behalf\nof the LLRBC were fraudulently procured, and therefore that the defendants never had\na legitimate claim to the money. We note that White admitted that he signed the\nSubscription Agreement--the agreement that purported to give Finn 75% of the equity\nin RRM--but testified that it said nothing about Finn's ownership when he signed it.\nSee Tr. at 695-96. In addition, the evidence shows that RRM kept its funds in bank\n\n                                          -10-\n\faccounts that appeared to belong to the LLRBC. Based on this evidence, the jury could\n(and apparently did) find that the LLRBC did not in fact assent to Finn's ownership of\nthree-fourths of RRM, and the agreement was therefore void. It then follows that the\ndefendants' conversion of RRM's funds to their own purposes in 1990 was unlawful,\nand this conversion occurred within five years before the defendants were indicted. We\ntherefore reject the defendants' argument as being out of step with the charges and the\njury's findings.\n\n                                          B.\n\n       The defendants next argue that 18 U.S.C. § 1162 (1988), commonly known as\nPublic Law 280, strips the federal government of jurisdiction over the crimes charged\nin the indictment, giving jurisdiction instead to the state. The Magistrate Judge5\nrejected this argument in a lengthy opinion addressing the defendants' pretrial motions.\nSee United States v. Finn, 919 F. Supp. 1305, 1330-38 (D. Minn. 1995) (report and\nrecommendation), adopted, United States v. Finn, 911 F. Supp. 372 (D. Minn. 1995);\nUnited States v. Pemberton, 911 F. Supp. 375 (D. Minn. 1995); United States v.\nBrown, 911 F. Supp. 375 (D. Minn. 1995). We agree.\n\n       We need not explore the defendants' argument at length, for it is foreclosed by\nour recent decision in United States v. Stone, 112 F.3d 971 (8th Cir. 1997). In Stone,\nwhich involved a violation of the Airborne Hunting Act, 16 U.S.C. § 742j-1, we held\nthat Public Law 280 does not divest the federal government of jurisdiction over all\ncriminal matters occurring in Indian country. See Stone, 112 F.3d at 973. Rather, we\nheld, Public Law 280 transfers from the federal government to the state of Minnesota\n\n\n\n\n      5\n        The Honorable Raymond L. Erickson, United States Magistrate Judge for the\nDistrict of Minnesota.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fjurisdiction over only those crimes encompassed by 18 U.S.C. §§ 1152 and 1153.6 See\nid. Crimes of general applicability--that is, actions that Congress has declared illegal\nregardless of where they occur--are not affected by the enactment of Public Law 280\nand remain within the subject-matter jurisdiction of the federal courts. See id.; cf.\nStone v. United States, 506 F.2d 561, 563 (8th Cir. 1974) (discussing crimes of general\napplicability), cert. denied, 420 U.S. 978 (1975); Felix S. Cohen, Handbook of Federal\nIndian Law 366 n.156 (Rennard Strickland et al. eds., 1982 ed.) (citing examples of\nfederal laws unaffected by Public Law 280). Because all of the crimes with which the\ndefendants were charged are crimes of general applicability, the defendants' challenge\nto the District Court's jurisdiction fails.7\n\n\n                                          C.\n       We next consider several arguments raised by Finn, all of which concern claims\nof prosecutorial misconduct. For the most part, these arguments are tangentially related\nto a dispute that arose during the government's investigation of this case and the\nobstruction-of-justice charges against Finn that resulted. The key document involved\nin this dispute is an invoice in the amount of $7600 sent by RRM to the LLRBC for\nadditional insurance services; when Finn received payment from the LLRBC, he paid\nthe same amount to the executive director of the LLRBC, Myron Ellis. According to\nsworn statements of Ellis and the LLRBC's accountant, when a grand jury subpoenaed\n\n\n\n      6\n       Section 1152 \"extends to Indian country federal enclave jurisdiction over crimes\nin which the situs of the offense is an element.\" Stone, 112 F.3d at 973. Section 1153\nmakes unlawful certain enumerated offenses, including murder, kidnapping, and\nburglary, committed by an Indian in Indian country. See 18 U.S.C. § 1153.\n      7\n       Finn suggests that the crime of theft or misapplication of tribal funds is a\n\"uniquely Indian\" offense rather than a crime of general applicability. Finn Br. at 27\nn.43. We disagree, for 18 U.S.C. § 1163 forbids stealing from a tribe anywhere in the\ncountry. See United States v. McGrady, 508 F.2d 13, 16 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied,\n420 U.S. 979 (1975).\n\n                                         -12-\n\fdocuments from the Band in 1991, Finn told the accountant to destroy the invoice. The\nBand eventually turned over another copy of the invoice in response to a 1993\nsubpoena. The kickback allegedly paid to Ellis was the basis of the 1994 misdemeanor\ncharge against Finn, and Finn's order to the accountant to destroy the invoice was the\njustification for an obstruction-of-justice sentence enhancement that caused him to\nwithdraw his guilty plea to the misdemeanor. Finn was later charged with a substantive\ncount of obstruction of justice in the 1995 indictment, but this charge was dismissed by\nthe government during trial.\n\n         Finn first argues that the government's decision to charge him with multiple\nfelonies after he withdrew his guilty plea to a misdemeanor constituted vindictive\nprosecution. As Finn frames the issue, the government retaliated against him for his\nexercise of \"a legal right.\" Finn Br. at 13.8 Finn has adduced no evidence of actual\nvindictiveness on the part of the government; accordingly, his claim can succeed only\nif it is proper to presume vindictiveness from the circumstances. The government seeks\nto clarify the circumstances by pointing out that the misdemeanor plea resulted from a\nplea bargain and that Finn was warned that he could be charged with more serious\ncrimes if he insisted on going to trial. Although we have no reason to disbelieve the\ngovernment, we need not venture outside the record to determine that Finn's argument\nmust be rejected. \"[T]he mere fact that a defendant refuses to plead guilty and forces\nthe government to prove its case is insufficient to warrant a presumption that\nsubsequent changes in the charging decision are unjustified.\" United States v.\nGoodwin, 457 U.S. 368, 382-83 (1982); see also Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434 U.S.\n357, 364-65 (1978) (holding that prosecutor's threatening more serious charges if\ndefendant does not plead guilty does not violate due process). Accordingly, we do not\npresume vindictiveness in this case, and Finn's argument fails to carry the day.\n\n\n\n      8\n        Finn does not identify what \"legal right\" he exercised, but we will assume he is\nreferring to his right to a trial by jury.\n\n                                         -13-\n\f       Finn also complains that an agent of the Department of the Interior perjured\nhimself before the grand jury by stating that the Band never turned over the invoice in\nresponse to subpoenas. This argument is meritless for several reasons. First, \"an\nindictment returned by a legally established and unbiased grand jury 'is not subject to\nchallenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or\nincompetent evidence.'\" United States v. Roach, 28 F.3d 729, 739 (8th Cir. 1994)\n(quoting United States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 345 (1974)). Second, even if we\nconsider the merits of the argument, any prejudice to Finn from this testimony was\ndissipated when the obstruction charge was dismissed during trial. In fact, because the\ndefendants cross-examined the agent thoroughly at trial and exposed his failure to\ndiscover the copy of the invoice among the documents turned over to the grand jury in\n1993, the incident probably caused more damage to the government's case than it did\nto Finn's defense.\n\n       Finn next argues that the government's mention of the obstruction-of-justice\nallegations in its opening statement was improper. As best as we can tell, Finn appears\nto be arguing that because the government discovered that the invoice had not been\ndestroyed, it should have abandoned the obstruction charge before the trial began. As\nthe District Court found when Finn made a similar argument in the guise of a Brady\nclaim, however, the fact that a copy of the invoice survived does not show that Finn did\nnot order the accountant to destroy it. Nothing in Finn's argument shows a lack of good\nfaith on the part of the prosecutor, see United States v. Wallace, 453 F.2d 420, 422 (8th\nCir.) (noting that prosecutor's good faith is controlling question), cert. denied, 406 U.S.\n961 (1972), and the court instructed the jury that opening arguments are not evidence.\nAs a result, we are unable to conclude that the government's mention of the obstruction\nevidence amounts to misconduct.\n\n       Finally, we consider Finn's objection to the testimony of one of the government's\nexpert witnesses. At trial, an IRS agent testified that a particular financial transaction\nconducted by Finn constituted money laundering. After a bench conference, the\n\n                                           -14-\n\fDistrict Court struck the testimony and instructed the jury to disregard it; the court\nrepeated this instruction during the final jury charge. Finn suggests that expert\ntestimony that a defendant committed a crime is invariably improper, citing Federal\nRule of Evidence 704(b). That rule, however, prohibits only testimony on the issue of\nmens rea, while Rule 704(a) permits testimony on any other issue, even if \"it embraces\nan ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\" Fed. R. Evid. 704(a); see also\nUnited States v. Posters 'N' Things Ltd., 969 F.2d 652, 661 n.6 (8th Cir. 1992)\n(permitting expert to testify that particular elements of money laundering were\nestablished), aff'd, 511 U.S. 513 (1994). We need not determine exactly how Rule 704\nshould apply in the instant case--a difficult question, because an opinion that the\ndefendant committed a crime may include a suggestion that he or she had the requisite\nmental state--although we suggest that a cautious prosecutor should avoid eliciting from\na witness an answer to this ultimate question. Cf. United States v. Whitted, 11 F.3d\n782, 785 (8th Cir. 1993) (holding that expert may not testify that child was sexually\nabused because opinion is not helpful to the jury). In this case, Finn was acquitted of\nall the money-laundering charges, curing any direct prejudice to him, and we conclude\nthat any spillover prejudice to Finn on the other charges in the indictment was\nadequately cured by the court's repeated instruction to the jury to disregard the\ntestimony.\n\n                                          III.\n\n       We now turn to several issues raised by Pemberton and Brown, including their\narguments that the evidence is insufficient to support their convictions. When we\nexamine the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the evidence and all reasonable\ninferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict, and\nwe will reverse only if no reasonable jury could have found the defendants guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Stands, 105 F.3d 1565, 1570 (8th Cir.\n1997), petitions for cert. filed, Nos. 96-9316, 96-9420, 96-9541 (U.S. June 5, 17, 18,\n1997).\n\n                                         -15-\n\f                                           A.\n\n       We deal first with Pemberton's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. In\naddition to conspiracy, Pemberton was convicted of two substantive counts relating to\nthe disbursement of the funds of RRM as the company was wound up in June 1990.\nPemberton argues that he was merely a pawn of Finn, the mastermind of the RRM\nscheme, and that he had no knowledge that RRM was a scam; his payout in 1990, he\nsays, was merely a fair return on his legitimate investment in RRM in 1987. This is,\nof course, one possible interpretation of the facts, but it is the interpretation most\nfavorable to Pemberton, not the one most favorable to the verdict. As in many cases,\nthere is little direct evidence of Pemberton's knowledgeable participation in the\nconspiracy and the distribution of the proceeds of RRM, but the jury was entitled to\nrely on the significant circumstantial evidence indicating that Pemberton knew Finn was\ndefrauding the Band and that he joined in Finn's efforts to do so. See United States v.\nJewell, 893 F.2d 193, 194 (8th Cir. 1990) (recognizing that knowledge and intent may\nbe established by circumstantial evidence). The jury could have considered, for\nexample: (1) that Pemberton created a conflict of interest by investing in RRM while\nhe was secretary-treasurer of the LLRBC; (2) that Finn's notes from the first RRM\nboard meeting show that the \"Leech Lake agreements\" were discussed while\nPemberton was present; (3) that Pemberton, along with White, signed a letter\nauthorizing one of the LLRBC's banks to transfer to RRM the $30,000 that was used\nto purchase shares for Pemberton and Brown in RRM; (4) that the auditor for the\nDepartment of the Interior directed several letters to Pemberton expressing concerns\nabout the relationship between the LLRBC and RRM; (5) that Pemberton signed the\nrepresentation letter stating that no LLRBC officials stood to profit from RRM; and (6)\nthat Pemberton's \"investment\" of $18,000 (assuming that the money was even his to\ninvest) more than tripled in about three years, when it was obvious that his profits could\nhave come only at the expense of the LLRBC, of which he was an officer.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f       Reasonable jurors could disagree about whether Pemberton conspired with his\nco-defendants and intentionally stole from his fellow tribal members. Nevertheless, the\njurors before whom Pemberton was tried did not disagree, and we cannot say that no\nreasonable juror could have found him guilty. See United States v. Weston, 4 F.3d\n672, 674 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"[I]f the evidence rationally supports two conflicting\nhypotheses, we cannot disturb the conviction.\").\n\n                                           B.\n\n       Brown, who was convicted on the conspiracy count only, presents a closer case\non the sufficiency question, but much of the circumstantial evidence that suffices to\nsupport Pemberton's conviction is equally probative of Brown's participation in the\nconspiracy. In particular, Brown's signature on the auditor's representation letter, which\ncontained the false statement that no LLRBC officials would share in RRM's profits,\nreasonably could lead the jury to the inference that Brown intended to mislead the\nauditor and the Interior Department. Brown suggests that he did not know that the\nstatement was false, but the jury quite reasonably could have determined that, as a\ndirector and shareholder of RRM, he was well aware of his financial interest in the\ncompany.\n\n                                           C.\n\n       The government also presented a theory of \"willful blindness\" regarding\nPemberton's and Brown's knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy. Brown\ndoes not challenge the substance of the District Court's instruction on the willful-\nblindness issue, but he does take issue with the manner in which the court decided to\ngive the instruction. We conclude that the District Court erred, but the error was not\nprejudicial.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f        In examining this claim, we must consider the rather unusual happenings as the\ntrial came to a close. Although the record is not entirely clear, the parties agree that the\ncourt ruled at the instruction conference that it would give a willful-blindness\ninstruction. When the parties returned to the courtroom the following morning to begin\nclosing arguments, the court told counsel that it had determined that the instruction was\nnot appropriate and that it would not be given. The government and Finn then\npresented their arguments, and the court recessed for lunch. After lunch, the court\ninformed counsel that it had changed its mind again and would give the willful-\nblindness instruction.9 When Brown objected, the court ruled that the government\nwould not be permitted to argue willful blindness in its rebuttal unless Brown raised the\nissue in his closing argument. Brown then proceeded with his argument, avoiding the\nsubject, and the government did not argue it in rebuttal.\n\n       Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30 provides that \"[t]he court shall inform\ncounsel of its proposed action upon the requests [for jury instructions] prior to their\narguments to the jury.\" The District Court clearly violated this rule by changing its\nmind about the instruction in the midst of closing arguments. Nevertheless, a violation\nof Rule 30 is not reversible error unless the complaining defendant is prejudiced by the\nerror. See, e.g., Eisen, 974 F.2d at 256; United States v. Horton, 921 F.2d 540, 547\n(4th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1234 (1991); United States v. Gaskins, 849 F.2d\n454, 458 (9th Cir. 1988); United States v. Smith, 629 F.2d 650, 653 (10th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 449 U.S. 994 (1980); cf. United States v. Dawson, 467 F.2d 668, 675 (8th Cir.\n\n\n       9\n        Brown suggests that the District Court's decision to give the instruction was\ninfluenced by the misconduct of Finn's counsel during his closing argument. Neither\nthe record nor common sense supports this claim. There is no reason to believe that\nthe court would seek to punish Brown and Pemberton for the misdeeds of Finn's\nattorney, and no one suggests that the instruction was intended to punish Finn, since the\nwillful-blindness theory could not plausibly have applied to him. The court's reprimand\nof Finn's attorney properly included cautionary language that the jury should not hold\nthe reprimand against any of the defendants, including Finn himself.\n\n                                           -18-\n\f1972) (affirming conviction where defendant was alerted that instruction would\nprobably be given), cert. denied, 410 U.S. 956 (1973). For this purpose, a defendant\nis prejudiced if he is \"unfairly prevented from arguing his defense to the jury or [is]\nsubstantially misled in formulating his arguments.\" Smith, 629 F.2d at 653. No such\nprejudice exists in this case.\n\n        Brown argues that he was prejudiced because the government would have been\npermitted to respond if he had argued the willful-blindness issue. Of course, the\ngovernment would have been permitted to respond to Brown's arguments in any event,\nregardless of when the District Court ruled on the instructions, because the government\nis entitled to the last word in rebuttal. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.1. The District Court's\nruling that the government could not argue the issue in rebuttal unless Brown opened\nthe door prejudiced no one but the government.10 Nor was Brown misled in\nformulating his argument, for the District Court had indicated at the instruction\nconference the previous day that the instruction would be given. Counsel for Brown\ncould have been misled only if he prepared his argument after the court first changed\nits mind--that is, if counsel had prepared his argument during the closing arguments of\nthe government and Finn. Brown does not suggest that this was the case, and we think\nit entirely unlikely. Accordingly, because Brown was not prejudiced by the District\nCourt's violation of Rule 30, the error does not entitle him to a new trial.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n      We now consider several arguments proffered by Finn. Before considering some\nof Finn's more substantial arguments in detail, we pause to reject several other\n\n      10\n         Brown also suggests that he should have been given an opportunity for\nsurrebuttal on the issue. This argument makes no sense, for even if the District Court\nhad followed the proper procedure and finalized the instructions before the government\nbegan closing arguments, Brown would not have been entitled to speak twice on any\nissue.\n\n                                          -19-\n\farguments briefly. What we have written already with respect to Pemberton's and\nBrown's conspiracy convictions is sufficient to demonstrate our belief that the\ngovernment presented sufficient evidence to convict Finn of conspiracy. Nor is there\nmerit in Finn's contention that 18 U.S.C. § 1346, which broadened the scope of the mail\nand wire fraud statutes following the Supreme Court's decision in McNally v. United\nStates, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), cannot be applied to a conspiracy that began before the\nstatute was enacted and continued after its enactment. This argument is foreclosed by\nUnited States v. Blumeyer, 114 F.3d 758, 766 (8th Cir. 1997), and United States v.\nGarfinkel, 29 F.3d 1253, 1259 (8th Cir. 1994). Finally, Finn (along with his\ncodefendants at times) argues repeatedly that because there was insufficient evidence\nto convict him of one or another of the substantive charges against him, his conspiracy\nconviction, which resulted from a general verdict on a charge that he conspired to\ncommit several substantive crimes, must also be reversed. We disagree. Finn's\nargument contains two significant flaws. Not only is it quite possible and permissible\nfor a defendant to be convicted of conspiring to commit an offense and to be acquitted\nof that same substantive offense, see United States v. Townsley, 843 F.2d 1070, 1086\n(8th Cir.), vacated in part on other grounds, 856 F.2d 1189 (8th Cir. 1988) (en banc),\ncert. dismissed, 499 U.S. 944 (1991), but also the Supreme Court has held explicitly\nthat the failure of proof on one of several alternative conspiratorial objects does not\nvoid the conspiracy conviction if the proof is sufficient as to any one of the objects of\nthe conspiracy, see Griffin v. United States, 502 U.S. 46, 56-57 (1991). We conclude\nthat Finn's attack upon his conspiracy conviction lacks merit.\n\n                                           A.\n\n       Finn challenges the sufficiency of the indictment with respect to the charges that\nhe violated 18 U.S.C. § 666 by stealing from a program receiving federal funds. Finn\nargues that the indictment did not allege that he was an agent of the Band on the dates\non which he was accused of converting the Band's property and that the District Court\nshould have granted his pretrial motion to dismiss the § 666 charges on this ground.\n\n                                          -20-\n\fAlthough we agree with Finn that agency is an element of a § 666 offense, see 18\nU.S.C. § 666(a)(1), (d)(1), we believe that the indictment does sufficiently charge that\nFinn was the Band's agent on the relevant dates. (We also note that the District Court's\njury instruction on this point was correct.)\n\n      An indictment is sufficient if it (1) contains the elements of the charged\n      offense and fairly informs the defendant of the charge against which he or\n      she must defend and (2) enables him or her to plead double jeopardy as\n      a bar to further prosecution. . . . Unless the indictment is so defective that\n      by no reasonable construction can it be said to charge the offense for\n      which the defendant[] [was] convicted, we will uphold it.\n\nStands, 105 F.3d at 1575 (citations omitted). When the issue is whether an element of\nan offense has been omitted, our inquiry is whether the omission is one of substance\nor one of form only. See United States v. Mallen, 843 F.2d 1096, 1102 (8th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 488 U.S. 849 (1988).\n\n       Finn correctly notes that the § 666 counts contain no language expressly\ninforming him that the government would be required to prove that he was an agent of\nthe Band. Three factors, however, when considered in combination, make the\nindictment sufficient nonetheless. First, the § 666 counts cite the statute, which clearly\nmakes agency an element of the offense. Finn points out that we held in United States\nv. Camp, 541 F.2d 737, 740 (8th Cir. 1976), that a reference to the relevant statute\ncannot supply an element omitted by the grand jury. This case is distinguishable from\nCamp, however, because of other relevant allegations made by the grand jury. The\nintroductory section of the indictment, which the indictment incorporates by reference\ninto all of the counts, alleges that Finn was the Band's attorney \"from on and about\n1983 to June 1, 1990.\" Grand Jury Indictment at 3. Although all of the § 666 offenses\nwere alleged to have occurred between June 13 and July 5, 1990, the use of \"on or\nabout\" (which is what we must assume the grand jury meant when it said \"on and\nabout\") in an indictment incorporates dates \"within a reasonable time of the date\n\n                                          -21-\n\fspecified.\" United States v. Duke, 940 F.2d 1113, 1120 (8th Cir. 1991). The\nindictment further alleges that the same acts by Finn that violated § 666 also violated\n18 U.S.C. § 1163, and in the § 1163 counts, the indictment alleges that Finn was an\nagent of the Band on the relevant dates. In these circumstances, it is apparent that the\ngrand jury's omission was one of form rather than substance, and so Finn's challenge\nto the sufficiency of the indictment must fail.\n\n                                          B.\n\n       Finn next argues that the government did not prove that RRM was an \"Indian\ntribal organization\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1163. We disagree.11\n\n       Whether an entity is an Indian tribal organization is a question for the jury to\ndecide. See United States v. White Horse, 807 F.2d 1426, 1429 (8th Cir. 1986). In\nWhite Horse, the relevant organization was a telephone authority chartered pursuant to\ntribal law and wholly owned by the tribe. We reversed the defendants' convictions\nbecause the district court erred by instructing the jury that the telephone authority was\nan Indian tribal organization as a matter of law, but we refused to grant the defendants\njudgments of acquittal. See id. at 1430-31 & n.2. In other words, we necessarily\nconcluded in White Horse that the government had presented sufficient evidence to\nshow that the authority was a tribal organization, but we reversed because the wrong\nfactfinder made the decision. Nearly identical evidence was presented in the instant\ncase. RRM was established under tribal authority as a subordinate body politic of the\nLLRBC. We find it difficult to believe that any corporation established under tribal law\n\n      11\n         We do not necessarily need to reach this issue, as the indictment also charged\nFinn with stealing from the Band, which is undoubtedly an Indian tribal organization.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 1163 (including \"any tribe, band, or community of Indians\" within\ndefinition). Out of an abundance of caution, however, and because Finn's argument\nraises an important issue regarding the status of tribally-chartered entities, we will\nconsider the status of RRM.\n\n                                         -22-\n\fas a sub-entity of a tribe would not be an Indian tribal organization (although it remains,\nof course, a jury question), and Finn surely has not made such a case for RRM.\n\n       Nor do we find persuasive Finn's argument that United States v. Zephier, 916\nF.2d 1368 (8th Cir. 1990), controls in this case. Zephier involved a school founded by\nfifteen tribes and organized as a charitable corporation under state law. See id. at 1369-\n70. We explicitly noted the state-law character of the corporation when we laid out\nseveral factors indicating that a state-law corporation may be an Indian tribal\norganization, including the factor that Finn now emphasizes: \"the entity must be\npatterned after or deliberately have conformed its operations to federal laws for Indian\naffairs.\" Id. at 1372. We do not believe that the government is required to meet this\nelement of Zephier in the case of a corporate subsidiary chartered by a tribe; in fact, the\nrequirement does not especially make sense in the context of RRM. Federal laws\ngoverning Indian affairs do not necessarily have anything to do with a corporation\nfounded pursuant to tribal authority. Because tribal law gives the corporation its legal\nexistence, a corporation chartered under tribal law necessarily has a closer legal\nrelationship with the tribe than does a state-chartered corporation that is merely\ncontrolled by one or more tribes. Accordingly, we believe that the only relevant factor\nfor the jury's consideration in the case of a corporation chartered under tribal authority\nis the degree of control over the corporation possessed by the tribe. See id. (outlining\nfour factors relevant to determination of \"de facto control\"); White Horse, 807 F.2d at\n1430 (\"[T]he Telephone Authority constituted an Indian tribal organization if there was\na sufficient nexus between the Tribe and the Telephone Authority.\"). Although Finn\nargues that in fact he had full control of RRM, he does not seriously dispute that the\ngovernment established a sufficient nexus between the Band and RRM. We conclude\nthat the government's evidence sufficiently supports the jury's finding that RRM was an\nIndian tribal organization.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f                                           C.\n\n      Finally, we consider Finn's challenge to his mail-fraud convictions. Here Finn\nargues that the mailings did not further his scheme to defraud the Band and the state of\nMinnesota. Again, we disagree.\n\n        The mail-fraud charges relate to two of Finn's boat purchases. Finn bought a\ntwenty-foot boat in 1987 with RRM funds and registered it in the name of Finn &\nMattson, his law partnership. Three years later, Finn bought a twenty-one-foot boat\nwith RRM funds laundered through the LLRBC; he registered this boat in his own\nname. Minnesota passed a statute in 1989 requiring many boats, including the two\nboats at issue here, to have certificates of title beginning January 1, 1991. See Minn.\nStat. §§ 86B.820 to -.920 (1996). After the law took effect, Finn applied for certificates\nof title for both boats, and the state sent the certificates to him through the mail.\n\n       Finn argues first that the government cannot premise one of his mail-fraud\nconvictions on the sales-tax return that was filed by the dealer that sold him the twenty-\none-foot boat in 1990. The dealer that sold the boat testified that because Finn indicated\nthat he was purchasing the boat on behalf of the LLRBC, he did not charge Finn sales\ntax on the purchase and he did not submit sales tax to the state. Finn nevertheless\nargues that the dealer's sales-tax return was not false because, according to the\ntestimony of one of Finn's witnesses, the return did not report the sale of the boat as a\nsale to an exempt entity. This argument is irrelevant, for an innocent mailing--that is,\na mailing that is entirely true--may satisfy the mailing element of a mail-fraud\nconviction. See Schmuck v. United States, 489 U.S. 705, 715 (1989); United States v.\nRibaste, 905 F.2d 1140, 1142 (8th Cir. 1990). In any event, the jury reasonably could\nhave believed the proprietor, who testified that he did not pay the tax to the state.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\f        Finn presents a better argument with respect to the other two counts of mail fraud.\nThese counts were premised on the state's mailing of certificates of title to Finn after the\npassage of the new statute. Finn argues that because these mailings were not \"part of\nthe execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time,\" Schmuck, 489\nU.S. at 715, they cannot support mail-fraud convictions. We will accept Finn's version\nof events and assume that he was entirely unaware that certificates of title might be\nrequired some time after he purchased the boats, although we suspect that an attorney\nand sportsman such as Finn was probably aware of the titling statute, which was passed\nin 1989, when he bought the twenty-one-foot boat in 1990. On Finn's theory, the fraud\nwas complete once he registered the boat in his name (or the name of his partnership),\nbecause he could then transfer title merely by signing over the registration card to a\npurchaser.12 Finn argues that the state's subsequent requirement that he obtain a\ncertificate of title was not foreseeable and that his receipt of titles through the mail did\nnot further his fraud in any way.\n\n      We think Finn's view of the situation is overly simplistic. For starters, the\nlanguage in Schmuck that the mailing must be \"part of the execution of the scheme as\nconceived by the perpetrator at the time\" is directed to a different issue: what might be\ncalled an \"inculpatory\" mailing. Schmuck argued that the mailings for which he was\nconvicted (certificates of titles to cars that he had sold after rolling back their\nodometers) actually worked against him by increasing the risk that he would be caught.\nSee id. The Court rejected his argument, holding that it is irrelevant \"whether the\nmailing later, through hindsight, may prove to have been counterproductive and return\nto haunt the perpetrator of the fraud.\" Id. Finn's case is a bit different: here, Finn\nbelieved he had successfully defrauded the Band, but then a change in state law\n\n       12\n        We simplify matters a bit when we say that \"the fraud was complete.\" In fact,\nas the government points out, the indictment alleged that all of Finn's RRM-related\nactions from 1985 on were a part of his scheme to defraud. Our statement that the\nfraud was complete is really a simpler way of saying that the mailings could not have\nfurthered the fraud because Finn had already obtained complete control of the boats.\n\n                                           -25-\n\frequired him to take another step if he wished to retain the fruits of his fraud or convert\nthem to cash. Given the change in the law, the mailings in the instant case increased the\nchances that Finn's fraud would be successful, for they enabled him to present a\npurchaser with prima facie proof of title in a new and official form. Finn's mailings,\ntherefore, are not the inculpatory sort of communications envisioned in Schmuck; they\nare communications that he did not foresee but that he nevertheless was required to\nmake in order to continue the fraud. Finn suggests no authority that a mailing of this\ntype may not suffice to support a mail-fraud conviction, and we see no reason why such\na mailing should not be adequate.\n\n        In essence, Finn seems to be arguing that a defendant who has successfully\nfleeced his victim and gained possession and control of the victim's property may not\nbe convicted of mail fraud based on subsequent mailings. This is not the law. See\nUnited States v. Lane, 474 U.S. 438, 451-52 (1986) (\"Mailings occurring after receipt\nof the goods obtained by fraud are within the statute if they 'were designed to lull the\nvictims into a false sense of security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the\nauthorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely than if no\nmailings had taken place.'\") (quoting United States v. Maze, 414 U.S. 395, 403 (1974)).\nUltimately, whether a mailing furthers a scheme to defraud is a factual question for the\njury to decide. See United States v. Freitag, 768 F.2d 240, 244 (8th Cir. 1985). The\njury in the instant case reasonably could have found that, given the change in the law,\nthe titles mailed to Finn at his request furthered his scheme to defraud the Band of its\nproperty.\n\n                                            V.\n\n      We have considered the defendants' numerous remaining arguments, including\nthose challenging their sentences, and have concluded that they are without merit.\nAccordingly, the judgments of the District Court are affirmed.\n\n\n                                          -26-\n\fA true copy.\n\n      Attest:\n\n               CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                              -27-\n\f",

Pemberton\nand Finn also appeal their sentences. We affirm the judgments of the District Court.1\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Michael J. Davis, United States District Judge for the District\nof Minnesota.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f                                          I.\n\n       Because of the complexity of this case and the many fact-specific arguments\nraised by the defendants, we relate the facts of this case in somewhat more detail than\nis customary. Pemberton, Brown, and Finn are enrolled members of the Band. This\ntale begins in 1985, when Pemberton was secretary-treasurer of the Leech Lake\nReservation Business Committee (LLRBC), the five-member governing body of the\nBand.2 At the time, Brown was one of three district representatives on the LLRBC, and\nFinn was the Band's legal counsel.3\n\n       Before 1985, the Band routinely purchased property-casualty and liability\ninsurance to cover the risks associated with several buildings owned by the Band and\nseveral businesses operated by the LLRBC on behalf of the Band. In 1985, however,\na crisis in the insurance market threatened to make insurance too expensive for the\nBand to afford; the only company willing even to quote a premium for the year\nbeginning July 1, 1985 would have increased the previous year's property-casualty\npremium from $122,000 to $254,000 and the previous liability premium from $31,000\nto $187,000. Because of the prohibitive cost, the Band went without insurance for a\ntime in 1985.\n\n      At a meeting of the LLRBC on October 1, 1985, Finn and an LLRBC staff\nmember presented a possible solution. As Finn described it, the Band could \"self-\ninsure\" by depositing funds annually in a segregated bank account and paying claims\n\n\n      2\n      The LLRBC was later renamed the Tribal Council, an appellation that more\nappropriately reflects its purpose.\n      3\n       Finn had been secretary-treasurer of the LLRBC in the 1970s, before he\nattended law school. Brown was elected chairman of the LLRBC in 1988. Pemberton\nremained secretary-treasurer until 1990, when he lost an election, but he was elected\nchairman in 1992.\n\n                                          -3-\n\fout of that account. Several individuals present at the October 1 meeting testified that\nFinn stated that the Band would own any funds not used to pay claims, as is typical of\nself-insurance programs. Finn suggested that he administer the program by collecting\nthe contributions and managing the payment of claims. Witnesses disagreed whether\nFinn proposed to retain a portion of the contributions as an administrative fee or\nwhether he would render his services pursuant to his retainer agreement with the Band.\nBecause of the possibility that the Band might suffer a large loss in the early years of\nthe plan, before any significant reserves could be developed, Finn suggested that the\nLLRBC purchase excess insurance coverage from a traditional insurance company.\nThe LLRBC voted unanimously to approve the self-insurance program as described by\nFinn, and adopted a resolution establishing a corporation named Reservation Risk\nManagement, Inc. (RRM) as \"a corporate sub-entity of the Leech Lake Reservation\nBusiness Committee.\" LLRBC Resolution No. 86-26 (Oct. 1, 1985). RRM's charter\nstated that the company was formed under the authority of the Minnesota Chippewa\nTribe (of which the Leech Lake Band is one of six constituent bands) to manage the\nBand's self-insurance program.\n\n       During the next few weeks, it became apparent that insurance companies were\nunwilling to provide excess insurance coverage to the Band at affordable rates. Finn\nreported this development at an LLRBC meeting on October 29. At that meeting, the\nLLRBC voted nevertheless to proceed with the self-insurance program, which was to\nbe administered by RRM, and the LLRBC authorized its chairman and secretary-\ntreasurer to execute the necessary documents. Throughout the next several months,\nseveral key documents were executed by LLRBC Chairman Hartley White and\nPemberton on behalf of the LLRBC and by Finn on behalf of RRM. For ease of\nreference, we will refer to these documents as the Subscription Agreement, the\nDebenture Agreement, the Shareholders' Agreement, and the Insurance Agreement.\nWhite testified that he did not believe that all of his purported signatures on these\ndocuments were genuine, and he clearly stated that he did not understand the import\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fof any of these agreements when he signed them. Instead, he relied on the advice of\nFinn, whom he considered to be a trustworthy and loyal member of the Band.\n\n       The Subscription Agreement gave 25% of the shares in RRM to the LLRBC and\n75% of the shares to Finn. In the Debenture Agreement, Finn and his law partner,\nKimball Mattson, pledged to tender as much as $450,000 to RRM if necessary to avoid\na shortfall in \"Fund C,\" the fund from which RRM was to pay claims. RRM was\nobligated to repay any sums advanced by Finn and Mattson, who also had the option\nto cancel the agreement on ninety days' notice and receive 20% interest per annum on\nany balance owed to them by RRM. In exchange for their standby promises to\ncontribute to RRM, Finn and Mattson were to receive 15% of the premiums collected\nby RRM. The Debenture Agreement was executed by Finn on his own behalf and on\nbehalf of RRM; the LLRBC was not a party to this contract.\n\n       The Shareholders' Agreement between the LLRBC and Finn described the\ninternal workings of RRM. Fifteen percent of premiums received were to be deposited\nin Fund A and paid annually to debenture holders, as described above. The other 85%\nof each premium payment was to go into Fund B, to be used for operating expenses,\nwhich Finn had previously estimated at $100,000 per year. Any excess in Fund B was\nto be regularly transferred to Fund C, from which claims would be paid. The\nShareholders' Agreement stated that the \"reserves in Fund C shall belong to the\nshareholders of RRM\" but were not to be distributed to the shareholders except on the\ndissolution of RRM. Shareholders' Agreement ¶ 3(b) (Jan. 14, 1986). In addition, if\nthe LLRBC withdrew from the insurance program any time before October 31, 1990,\nthe LLRBC would forfeit any claim to the assets of RRM, and those assets would be\ndistributed among the other shareholders.\n\n      The Insurance Agreement set up a ten-year insurance program at premiums\nbeginning at $300,000 per year and escalating to $450,000 per year (subject to upward\nadjustment if deemed necessary by the directors of RRM). RRM agreed to seat two\n\n                                         -5-\n\fpersons nominated by the LLRBC on the board of directors of RRM. Pursuant to this\nagreement, RRM issued to the LLRBC an insurance policy providing on its face more\nthan $8 million in property-casualty coverage and $300,000 in liability coverage.\n\n       The government's risk-management expert testified that, in combination, these\ndocuments created a program that was neither insurance (because RRM did not assume\nthe risk of loss) nor self-insurance (because persons other than the LLRBC had\nownership interests in funds remaining after the payment of losses). In particular, the\nexpert testified, the Shareholders' Agreement \"essentially took the Band money and\ngave it to Mr. Finn.\" Tr. at 475. To demonstrate the workings of the program, she\ncalculated what would have happened if the RRM arrangement had lasted one year,\nduring which the LLRBC suffered no losses, and Finn had waived the forfeiture\nprovision and allowed the LLRBC to retain its equity despite the early cancellation.\nThe LLRBC would have paid $300,000 to RRM, of which 15% ($45,000) would have\ngone to Finn and his partner pursuant to the Debenture Agreement and another\n$100,000 (or 33%) would have gone to administrative expenses (essentially to Finn,\nhis firm, and RRM's board members). Of the $155,000 remaining in Fund C, the\nLLRBC would receive one-fourth ($38,750) when the program was cancelled. Thus,\neven without any claims or losses (i.e., the best-case scenario from the perspective of\nthe LLRBC), the LLRBC would receive only 13% of its payment back at the end of the\nyear. Not surprisingly, then, the expert concluded that \"[t]he RRM documents\neffectively deprive the Band of what the benefits of self-insurance should have been\"\nand that \"the terms of the transaction as a whole were commercially unreasonable in\nthe realm of self-insurance, risk management and insurance.\" Tr. at 453-54.\n\n       In January 1987, the LLRBC appointed Pemberton and Brown as its two\nrepresentatives on the board of RRM. Shortly thereafter, Pemberton was elected\nsecretary-treasurer and Brown vice-president of RRM. (Finn previously had been\nnamed president and was a board member.) Finn's wife and Pemberton's wife also\nwere elected to the five-member board, and each of them gave a proxy to Finn, giving\n\n                                          -6-\n\fhim effective control of the company. Finn soon transferred some of his equity\nownership of RRM to Pemberton and Brown in exchange for their investment of\n$18,000 and $12,000, respectively, giving Pemberton approximately 7% and Brown\napproximately 5% ownership of the company.4\n\n       Later in 1987, an auditor began to audit the Band on behalf of the Department\nof the Interior for fiscal year 1986. RRM immediately became an issue because the\nLLRBC's October 1985 resolution established the company as a tribal entity, which\nwould require it to be included in the audit. When the auditor wrote to Pemberton\nseeking more information about RRM, Finn responded with a letter stating that RRM\nwas chartered by the state of Minnesota and that the LLRBC owned only 25% of the\ncompany. (In fact, Finn had organized a state-chartered corporation under the name\n\"Reservation Risk Management, Inc.,\" a corporation that was evidently inactive. When\nwe refer to \"RRM,\" however, we mean the tribally-chartered company.) The auditor\ninquired further of Pemberton whether any of the Band's elected officials stood to\nbenefit from the Band's association with RRM. Again, Finn responded: \"Please be\nadvised that the Leech Lake Reservation elected officials do not stand to profit from\nits association with RRM, Inc.\" Letter from Finn to auditor of Mar. 3, 1988. After\nsome further jousting with Finn, the auditor gave up on RRM and did not include the\ncompany in his audit. When the auditor and his partners later had second thoughts,\nthey sent a representation letter to the LLRBC, asking the members to sign if they\nagreed with certain statements, including the following: \"All prior [LLRBC]\nresolutions establishing some type of control over RRM by the Leech Lake RBC have\nbeen rescinded. There are no RBC elected officials who exercise control or who share\nin the profits of RRM.\" Letter from auditor to LLRBC officials of Jan. 11, 1989.\nBrown and Pemberton signed the letter.\n\n      4\n       The parties dispute the source of the funds invested, but it does not matter\nwhether the $30,000 came from accrued leave owed to Pemberton and Brown (as they\nclaim) or from the Band's landfill trust account (as the government claims). Regardless,\nPemberton and Brown invested in RRM and received equity stakes.\n\n                                          -7-\n\f       In 1989, the Bureau of Indian Affairs notified the Band of fraudulent practices\ninvolving insurance companies and warned that in the future, all insurance companies\ndoing business with Indian tribes would have to be licensed by the relevant state\ngovernment. Accordingly, the LLRBC decided to end its arrangements with RRM. Of\nthe approximately $2 million collected by RRM since its establishment, the LLRBC\nreceived about $850,000 in a complicated series of transactions when the company was\ndissolved. During the life of RRM, it paid only $61,000 in insurance claims, while Finn\ntook hundreds of thousands of dollars out of the company--some for cash and some to\npurchase items such as cars, boats, golf carts, professional football and baseball\ntickets, and real estate. All three defendants also received thousands of dollars in fees\nfor serving on the board of directors of RRM.\n\n        As RRM was finally dissolved in mid-1990, Finn distributed considerable sums\nto the defendants. On May 2, 1990, Finn purchased an annuity for the benefit of Brown\nin the amount of $43,500; Brown later applied for a cash payout of 10% of the annuity\nand received the payout in October. On June 25, 1990, Finn distributed $62,000 to\nPemberton, $199,547.10 to Mattson (Finn's law partner), and $286,000 to himself. Ten\ndays later, Finn paid himself another $50,000.\n\n       In November 1990, a federal grand jury began investigating RRM. A federal\nagent served Finn with a grand jury subpoena in January 1991 at the Minnesota capitol\nbuilding, where Finn had just been sworn in as the first Native American elected to the\nstate Senate. Finn eventually was charged by information in 1994 with a misdemeanor\ncount of misapplying tribal funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1163 (1988). Finn\npleaded guilty, but when he was disappointed in the sentencing court's assessment of\nthe sentencing factors, he exercised his right, pursuant to his plea agreement, to\nwithdraw the guilty plea.\n\n       On June 7, 1995, the grand jury returned the indictment that began this case.\nFinn, Pemberton, and Brown were charged with one count of conspiracy, in violation\n\n                                          -8-\n\fof 18 U.S.C. § 371 (1988), and, in varying combinations, with nine counts of felony\ntheft or misapplication of tribal funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1163; four counts of\ntheft concerning a program receiving federal funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 666\n(1988); one count of bribery concerning a program receiving federal funds, in violation\nof 18 U.S.C. § 666; five counts of money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1957\n(1988); three counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1341, 1346 (1988 &\nSupp. II 1990); two counts of making a false statement, in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1001 (1988); and one count of obstruction of justice, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1503\n(1988).\n\n       After a seventeen-day trial, a jury convicted all three defendants of conspiracy.\nIn addition, Finn was convicted of four counts of theft or misapplication of tribal funds,\nfour counts of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds, and three counts of\nmail fraud; Pemberton was convicted of one count of theft or misapplication of tribal\nfunds and one count of theft concerning a program receiving federal funds. The District\nCourt sentenced Finn to fifty-seven months in prison, fined him $25,000, and ordered\nhim to pay restitution of $400,000 to the Band. Pemberton was sentenced to thirty-\nthree months in prison and ordered to repay $66,430 to the Band. Brown was placed\non probation for two years, including one year of home detention, fined $7500, and\nordered to pay restitution of $31,412.\n\n                                           II.\n\n      Of the many points raised by the defendants on appeal, we consider first several\noverarching arguments that attack the heart of the government's case.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f                                           A.\n\n        The parties agree that all of the crimes charged in this case are subject to the\nfive-year limitation period of 18 U.S.C. § 3282 (1988). The defendants argue that\n§ 3282 bars this prosecution. On its face, this argument appears specious, for all of the\ncounts on which the defendants were convicted involve conduct occurring on or after\nJune 13, 1990, less than five years before the date of the indictment.

Any theft or misapplication, the argument continues,\noccurred at the latest in 1989, when the LLRBC made its last payment to RRM. After\nthat point, the defendants could not have stolen or misapplied RRM's funds, for they\nowned RRM. (Actually, they owned only three-quarters of RRM, but the defendants\nfinesse this point by arguing that they kept less than three-fourths of RRM's assets\nwhen the company was wound up.)\n\n       This argument misses the point that the government's theory of the case, a theory\nthe evidence supports, was that the documents purportedly signed by White on behalf\nof the LLRBC were fraudulently procured, and therefore that the defendants never had\na legitimate claim to the money. We note that White admitted that he signed the\nSubscription Agreement--the agreement that purported to give Finn 75% of the equity\nin RRM--but testified that it said nothing about Finn's ownership when he signed it.\nSee Tr. at 695-96. In addition, the evidence shows that RRM kept its funds in bank\n\n                                          -10-\n\faccounts that appeared to belong to the LLRBC. Based on this evidence, the jury could\n(and apparently did) find that the LLRBC did not in fact assent to Finn's ownership of\nthree-fourths of RRM, and the agreement was therefore void. It then follows that the\ndefendants' conversion of RRM's funds to their own purposes in 1990 was unlawful,\nand this conversion occurred within five years before the defendants were indicted. We\ntherefore reject the defendants' argument as being out of step with the charges and the\njury's findings.\n\n                                          B.\n\n       The defendants next argue that 18 U.S.C. § 1162 (1988), commonly known as\nPublic Law 280, strips the federal government of jurisdiction over the crimes charged\nin the indictment, giving jurisdiction instead to the state. The Magistrate Judge5\nrejected this argument in a lengthy opinion addressing the defendants' pretrial motions.\nSee United States v.

For the most part, these arguments are tangentially related\nto a dispute that arose during the government's investigation of this case and the\nobstruction-of-justice charges against Finn that resulted. The key document involved\nin this dispute is an invoice in the amount of $7600 sent by RRM to the LLRBC for\nadditional insurance services; when Finn received payment from the LLRBC, he paid\nthe same amount to the executive director of the LLRBC, Myron Ellis. According to\nsworn statements of Ellis and the LLRBC's accountant, when a grand jury subpoenaed\n\n\n\n      6\n       Section 1152 \"extends to Indian country federal enclave jurisdiction over crimes\nin which the situs of the offense is an element.\" Stone, 112 F.3d at 973.

See 18 U.S.C. § 1153.\n      7\n       Finn suggests that the crime of theft or misapplication of tribal funds is a\n\"uniquely Indian\" offense rather than a crime of general applicability.

McGrady, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. denied,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975).\n\n                                         -12-\n\fdocuments from the Band in 1991, Finn told the accountant to destroy the invoice. The\nBand eventually turned over another copy of the invoice in response to a 1993\nsubpoena. The kickback allegedly paid to Ellis was the basis of the 1994 misdemeanor\ncharge against Finn, and Finn's order to the accountant to destroy the invoice was the\njustification for an obstruction-of-justice sentence enhancement that caused him to\nwithdraw his guilty plea to the misdemeanor. Finn was later charged with a substantive\ncount of obstruction of justice in the 1995 indictment, but this charge was dismissed by\nthe government during trial.\n\n         Finn first argues that the government's decision to charge him with multiple\nfelonies after he withdrew his guilty plea to a misdemeanor constituted vindictive\nprosecution. As Finn frames the issue, the government retaliated against him for his\nexercise of \"a legal right.\" Finn Br. at 13.8 Finn has adduced no evidence of actual\nvindictiveness on the part of the government; accordingly, his claim can succeed only\nif it is proper to presume vindictiveness from the circumstances. The government seeks\nto clarify the circumstances by pointing out that the misdemeanor plea resulted from a\nplea bargain and that Finn was warned that he could be charged with more serious\ncrimes if he insisted on going to trial. Although we have no reason to disbelieve the\ngovernment, we need not venture outside the record to determine that Finn's argument\nmust be rejected. \"[T]he mere fact that a defendant refuses to plead guilty and forces\nthe government to prove its case is insufficient to warrant a presumption that\nsubsequent changes in the charging decision are unjustified.\" United States v.\nGoodwin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110748\"><a href=\"/opinion/110748/united-states-v-goodwin/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382-83 (1982); see also Bordenkircher v.

Accordingly, we do not\npresume vindictiveness in this case, and Finn's argument fails to carry the day.\n\n\n\n      8\n        Finn does not identify what \"legal right\" he exercised, but we will assume he is\nreferring to his right to a trial by jury.\n\n                                         -13-\n\f       Finn also complains that an agent of the Department of the Interior perjured\nhimself before the grand jury by stating that the Band never turned over the invoice in\nresponse to subpoenas. This argument is meritless for several reasons. First, \"an\nindictment returned by a legally established and unbiased grand jury 'is not subject to\nchallenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or\nincompetent evidence.'\" United States v. Roach, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673476\"><a href=\"/opinion/673476/united-states-v-john-j-roach-united-states-of-america-v-pamela-hester/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 739 (8th Cir. 1994)\n(quoting United States v.

Second, even if we\nconsider the merits of the argument, any prejudice to Finn from this testimony was\ndissipated when the obstruction charge was dismissed during trial. In fact, because the\ndefendants cross-examined the agent thoroughly at trial and exposed his failure to\ndiscover the copy of the invoice among the documents turned over to the grand jury in\n1993, the incident probably caused more damage to the government's case than it did\nto Finn's defense.\n\n       Finn next argues that the government's mention of the obstruction-of-justice\nallegations in its opening statement was improper. As best as we can tell, Finn appears\nto be arguing that because the government discovered that the invoice had not been\ndestroyed, it should have abandoned the obstruction charge before the trial began. As\nthe District Court found when Finn made a similar argument in the guise of a Brady\nclaim, however, the fact that a copy of the invoice survived does not show that Finn did\nnot order the accountant to destroy it. Nothing in Finn's argument shows a lack of good\nfaith on the part of the prosecutor, see United States v. Wallace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"300766\"><a href=\"/opinion/300766/united-states-v-sterling-lyle-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422 (8th\nCir.)

At trial, an IRS agent testified that a particular financial transaction\nconducted by Finn constituted money laundering. After a bench conference, the\n\n                                           -14-\n\fDistrict Court struck the testimony and instructed the jury to disregard it; the court\nrepeated this instruction during the final jury charge. Finn suggests that expert\ntestimony that a defendant committed a crime is invariably improper, citing Federal\nRule of Evidence 704(b). That rule, however, prohibits only testimony on the issue of\nmens rea, while Rule 704(a) permits testimony on any other issue, even if \"it embraces\nan ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\" Fed.

We need not determine exactly how Rule 704\nshould apply in the instant case--a difficult question, because an opinion that the\ndefendant committed a crime may include a suggestion that he or she had the requisite\nmental state--although we suggest that a cautious prosecutor should avoid eliciting from\na witness an answer to this ultimate question. Cf. United States v.

When we\nexamine the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider the evidence and all reasonable\ninferences that may be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict, and\nwe will reverse only if no reasonable jury could have found the defendants guilty\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.

In\naddition to conspiracy, Pemberton was convicted of two substantive counts relating to\nthe disbursement of the funds of RRM as the company was wound up in June 1990.\nPemberton argues that he was merely a pawn of Finn, the mastermind of the RRM\nscheme, and that he had no knowledge that RRM was a scam; his payout in 1990, he\nsays, was merely a fair return on his legitimate investment in RRM in 1987. This is,\nof course, one possible interpretation of the facts, but it is the interpretation most\nfavorable to Pemberton, not the one most favorable to the verdict. As in many cases,\nthere is little direct evidence of Pemberton's knowledgeable participation in the\nconspiracy and the distribution of the proceeds of RRM, but the jury was entitled to\nrely on the significant circumstantial evidence indicating that Pemberton knew Finn was\ndefrauding the Band and that he joined in Finn's efforts to do so. See United States v.\nJewell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"534623\"><a href=\"/opinion/534623/united-states-v-lonnie-clifford-jewell/\"><span class=\"volume\">893</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">193</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 194 (8th Cir. 1990) (recognizing that knowledge and intent may\nbe established by circumstantial evidence). The jury could have considered, for\nexample: (1) that Pemberton created a conflict of interest by investing in RRM while\nhe was secretary-treasurer of the LLRBC; (2) that Finn's notes from the first RRM\nboard meeting show that the \"Leech Lake agreements\" were discussed while\nPemberton was present; (3) that Pemberton, along with White, signed a letter\nauthorizing one of the LLRBC's banks to transfer to RRM the $30,000 that was used\nto purchase shares for Pemberton and Brown in RRM; (4) that the auditor for the\nDepartment of the Interior directed several letters to Pemberton expressing concerns\nabout the relationship between the LLRBC and RRM; (5) that Pemberton signed the\nrepresentation letter stating that no LLRBC officials stood to profit from RRM; and (6)\nthat Pemberton's \"investment\" of $18,000 (assuming that the money was even his to\ninvest) more than tripled in about three years, when it was obvious that his profits could\nhave come only at the expense of the LLRBC, of which he was an officer.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\f       Reasonable jurors could disagree about whether Pemberton conspired with his\nco-defendants and intentionally stole from his fellow tribal members. Nevertheless, the\njurors before whom Pemberton was tried did not disagree, and we cannot say that no\nreasonable juror could have found him guilty. See United States v. Weston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"629209\"><a href=\"/opinion/629209/united-states-v-lonnie-gene-weston/\"><span class=\"volume\">4</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (8th Cir. 1993) (\"[I]f the evidence rationally supports two conflicting\nhypotheses, we cannot disturb the conviction.\").\n\n                                           B.\n\n       Brown, who was convicted on the conspiracy count only, presents a closer case\non the sufficiency question, but much of the circumstantial evidence that suffices to\nsupport Pemberton's conviction is equally probative of Brown's participation in the\nconspiracy. In particular, Brown's signature on the auditor's representation letter, which\ncontained the false statement that no LLRBC officials would share in RRM's profits,\nreasonably could lead the jury to the inference that Brown intended to mislead the\nauditor and the Interior Department. Brown suggests that he did not know that the\nstatement was false, but the jury quite reasonably could have determined that, as a\ndirector and shareholder of RRM, he was well aware of his financial interest in the\ncompany.\n\n                                           C.\n\n       The government also presented a theory of \"willful blindness\" regarding\nPemberton's and Brown's knowledge of and participation in the conspiracy. Brown\ndoes not challenge the substance of the District Court's instruction on the willful-\nblindness issue, but he does take issue with the manner in which the court decided to\ngive the instruction. We conclude that the District Court erred, but the error was not\nprejudicial.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\f        In examining this claim, we must consider the rather unusual happenings as the\ntrial came to a close. Although the record is not entirely clear, the parties agree that the\ncourt ruled at the instruction conference that it would give a willful-blindness\ninstruction. When the parties returned to the courtroom the following morning to begin\nclosing arguments, the court told counsel that it had determined that the instruction was\nnot appropriate and that it would not be given. The government and Finn then\npresented their arguments, and the court recessed for lunch. After lunch, the court\ninformed counsel that it had changed its mind again and would give the willful-\nblindness instruction.9 When Brown objected, the court ruled that the government\nwould not be permitted to argue willful blindness in its rebuttal unless Brown raised the\nissue in his closing argument. Brown then proceeded with his argument, avoiding the\nsubject, and the government did not argue it in rebuttal.\n\n       Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 30 provides that \"[t]he court shall inform\ncounsel of its proposed action upon the requests [for jury instructions] prior to their\narguments to the jury.\" The District Court clearly violated this rule by changing its\nmind about the instruction in the midst of closing arguments. Nevertheless, a violation\nof Rule 30 is not reversible error unless the complaining defendant is prejudiced by the\nerror. See, e.g., Eisen, 974 F.2d at 256; United States v.

No such\nprejudice exists in this case.\n\n        Brown argues that he was prejudiced because the government would have been\npermitted to respond if he had argued the willful-blindness issue. Of course, the\ngovernment would have been permitted to respond to Brown's arguments in any event,\nregardless of when the District Court ruled on the instructions, because the government\nis entitled to the last word in rebuttal. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.1. The District Court's\nruling that the government could not argue the issue in rebuttal unless Brown opened\nthe door prejudiced no one but the government.10 Nor was Brown misled in\nformulating his argument, for the District Court had indicated at the instruction\nconference the previous day that the instruction would be given. Counsel for Brown\ncould have been misled only if he prepared his argument after the court first changed\nits mind--that is, if counsel had prepared his argument during the closing arguments of\nthe government and Finn. Brown does not suggest that this was the case, and we think\nit entirely unlikely. Accordingly, because Brown was not prejudiced by the District\nCourt's violation of Rule 30, the error does not entitle him to a new trial.\n\n                                          IV.\n\n      We now consider several arguments proffered by Finn.

This argument makes no sense, for even if the District Court\nhad followed the proper procedure and finalized the instructions before the government\nbegan closing arguments, Brown would not have been entitled to speak twice on any\nissue.\n\n                                          -19-\n\farguments briefly. What we have written already with respect to Pemberton's and\nBrown's conspiracy convictions is sufficient to demonstrate our belief that the\ngovernment presented sufficient evidence to convict Finn of conspiracy.

We conclude\nthat Finn's attack upon his conspiracy conviction lacks merit.\n\n                                           A.\n\n       Finn challenges the sufficiency of the indictment with respect to the charges that\nhe violated 18 U.S.C. § 666 by stealing from a program receiving federal funds. Finn\nargues that the indictment did not allege that he was an agent of the Band on the dates\non which he was accused of converting the Band's property and that the District Court\nshould have granted his pretrial motion to dismiss the § 666 charges on this ground.\n\n                                          -20-\n\fAlthough we agree with Finn that agency is an element of a § 666 offense, see 18\nU.S.C. § 666(a)(1), (d)(1), we believe that the indictment does sufficiently charge that\nFinn was the Band's agent on the relevant dates. (We also note that the District Court's\njury instruction on this point was correct.)\n\n      An indictment is sufficient if it (1) contains the elements of the charged\n      offense and fairly informs the defendant of the charge against which he or\n      she must defend and (2) enables him or her to plead double jeopardy as\n      a bar to further prosecution. . . . Unless the indictment is so defective that\n      by no reasonable construction can it be said to charge the offense for\n      which the defendant[] [was] convicted, we will uphold it.\n\nStands, 105 F.3d at 1575 (citations omitted). When the issue is whether an element of\nan offense has been omitted, our inquiry is whether the omission is one of substance\nor one of form only. See United States v. Mallen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"504062\"><a href=\"/opinion/504062/united-states-v-james-e-mallen/\"><span class=\"volume\">843</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1096</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1102 (8th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1988).\n\n       Finn correctly notes that the § 666 counts contain no language expressly\ninforming him that the government would be required to prove that he was an agent of\nthe Band. Three factors, however, when considered in combination, make the\nindictment sufficient nonetheless. First, the § 666 counts cite the statute, which clearly\nmakes agency an element of the offense. Finn points out that we held in United States\nv. Camp, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"339013\"><a href=\"/opinion/339013/united-states-v-carter-camp/\"><span class=\"volume\">541</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 740 (8th Cir. 1976), that a reference to the relevant statute\ncannot supply an element omitted by the grand jury. This case is distinguishable from\nCamp, however, because of other relevant allegations made by the grand jury. The\nintroductory section of the indictment, which the indictment incorporates by reference\ninto all of the counts, alleges that Finn was the Band's attorney \"from on and about\n1983 to June 1, 1990.\" Grand Jury Indictment at 3. Although all of the § 666 offenses\nwere alleged to have occurred between June 13 and July 5, 1990, the use of \"on or\nabout\" (which is what we must assume the grand jury meant when it said \"on and\nabout\") in an indictment incorporates dates \"within a reasonable time of the date\n\n                                          -21-\n\fspecified.\" United States v. Duke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566043\"><a href=\"/opinion/566043/united-states-v-ralph-chavous-duke-aka-plookie-aka-plukey/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1120 (8th Cir. 1991). The\nindictment further alleges that the same acts by Finn that violated § 666 also violated\n18 U.S.C. § 1163, and in the § 1163 counts, the indictment alleges that Finn was an\nagent of the Band on the relevant dates. In these circumstances, it is apparent that the\ngrand jury's omission was one of form rather than substance, and so Finn's challenge\nto the sufficiency of the indictment must fail.\n\n                                          B.\n\n       Finn next argues that the government did not prove that RRM was an \"Indian\ntribal organization\" for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 1163. We disagree.11\n\n       Whether an entity is an Indian tribal organization is a question for the jury to\ndecide. See United States v. White Horse, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">807</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1426</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1429 (8th Cir. 1986). In\nWhite Horse, the relevant organization was a telephone authority chartered pursuant to\ntribal law and wholly owned by the tribe. We reversed the defendants' convictions\nbecause the district court erred by instructing the jury that the telephone authority was\nan Indian tribal organization as a matter of law, but we refused to grant the defendants\njudgments of acquittal. See id. at 1430-31 & n.2. In other words, we necessarily\nconcluded in White Horse that the government had presented sufficient evidence to\nshow that the authority was a tribal organization, but we reversed because the wrong\nfactfinder made the decision. Nearly identical evidence was presented in the instant\ncase. RRM was established under tribal authority as a subordinate body politic of the\nLLRBC. We find it difficult to believe that any corporation established under tribal law\n\n      11\n         We do not necessarily need to reach this issue, as the indictment also charged\nFinn with stealing from the Band, which is undoubtedly an Indian tribal organization.\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 1163 (including \"any tribe, band, or community of Indians\" within\ndefinition). Out of an abundance of caution, however, and because Finn's argument\nraises an important issue regarding the status of tribally-chartered entities, we will\nconsider the status of RRM.\n\n                                         -22-\n\fas a sub-entity of a tribe would not be an Indian tribal organization (although it remains,\nof course, a jury question), and Finn surely has not made such a case for RRM.\n\n       Nor do we find persuasive Finn's argument that United States v. Zephier, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550155\"><a href=\"/opinion/550155/united-states-v-al-zephier/\"><span class=\"volume\">916</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1368</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1990), controls in this case. Zephier involved a school founded by\nfifteen tribes and organized as a charitable corporation under state law. See id. at 1369-\n70. We explicitly noted the state-law character of the corporation when we laid out\nseveral factors indicating that a state-law corporation may be an Indian tribal\norganization, including the factor that Finn now emphasizes: \"the entity must be\npatterned after or deliberately have conformed its operations to federal laws for Indian\naffairs.\" Id. at 1372. We do not believe that the government is required to meet this\nelement of Zephier in the case of a corporate subsidiary chartered by a tribe; in fact, the\nrequirement does not especially make sense in the context of RRM. Federal laws\ngoverning Indian affairs do not necessarily have anything to do with a corporation\nfounded pursuant to tribal authority. Because tribal law gives the corporation its legal\nexistence, a corporation chartered under tribal law necessarily has a closer legal\nrelationship with the tribe than does a state-chartered corporation that is merely\ncontrolled by one or more tribes. Accordingly, we believe that the only relevant factor\nfor the jury's consideration in the case of a corporation chartered under tribal authority\nis the degree of control over the corporation possessed by the tribe. See id. (outlining\nfour factors relevant to determination of \"de facto control\"); White Horse, 807 F.2d at\n1430 (\"[T]he Telephone Authority constituted an Indian tribal organization if there was\na sufficient nexus between the Tribe and the Telephone Authority.\"). Although Finn\nargues that in fact he had full control of RRM, he does not seriously dispute that the\ngovernment established a sufficient nexus between the Band and RRM. We conclude\nthat the government's evidence sufficiently supports the jury's finding that RRM was an\nIndian tribal organization.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\f                                           C.\n\n      Finally, we consider Finn's challenge to his mail-fraud convictions. Here Finn\nargues that the mailings did not further his scheme to defraud the Band and the state of\nMinnesota. Again, we disagree.\n\n        The mail-fraud charges relate to two of Finn's boat purchases. Finn bought a\ntwenty-foot boat in 1987 with RRM funds and registered it in the name of Finn &\nMattson, his law partnership. Three years later, Finn bought a twenty-one-foot boat\nwith RRM funds laundered through the LLRBC; he registered this boat in his own\nname. Minnesota passed a statute in 1989 requiring many boats, including the two\nboats at issue here, to have certificates of title beginning January 1, 1991. See Minn.\nStat. §§ 86B.820 to -.920 (1996). After the law took effect, Finn applied for certificates\nof title for both boats, and the state sent the certificates to him through the mail.\n\n       Finn argues first that the government cannot premise one of his mail-fraud\nconvictions on the sales-tax return that was filed by the dealer that sold him the twenty-\none-foot boat in 1990. The dealer that sold the boat testified that because Finn indicated\nthat he was purchasing the boat on behalf of the LLRBC, he did not charge Finn sales\ntax on the purchase and he did not submit sales tax to the state. Finn nevertheless\nargues that the dealer's sales-tax return was not false because, according to the\ntestimony of one of Finn's witnesses, the return did not report the sale of the boat as a\nsale to an exempt entity. This argument is irrelevant, for an innocent mailing--that is,\na mailing that is entirely true--may satisfy the mailing element of a mail-fraud\nconviction. See Schmuck v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112222\"><a href=\"/opinion/112222/schmuck-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715 (1989); United States v.\nRibaste, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543160\"><a href=\"/opinion/543160/united-states-v-peter-j-ribaste-aka-pj-ribaste/\"><span class=\"volume\">905</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1142 (8th Cir. 1990). In any event, the jury reasonably could\nhave believed the proprietor, who testified that he did not pay the tax to the state.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -24-\n\f        Finn presents a better argument with respect to the other two counts of mail fraud.\nThese counts were premised on the state's mailing of certificates of title to Finn after the\npassage of the new statute. Finn argues that because these mailings were not \"part of\nthe execution of the scheme as conceived by the perpetrator at the time,\" Schmuck, 489\nU.S. at 715, they cannot support mail-fraud convictions. We will accept Finn's version\nof events and assume that he was entirely unaware that certificates of title might be\nrequired some time after he purchased the boats, although we suspect that an attorney\nand sportsman such as Finn was probably aware of the titling statute, which was passed\nin 1989, when he bought the twenty-one-foot boat in 1990. On Finn's theory, the fraud\nwas complete once he registered the boat in his name (or the name of his partnership),\nbecause he could then transfer title merely by signing over the registration card to a\npurchaser.12 Finn argues that the state's subsequent requirement that he obtain a\ncertificate of title was not foreseeable and that his receipt of titles through the mail did\nnot further his fraud in any way.\n\n      We think Finn's view of the situation is overly simplistic. For starters, the\nlanguage in Schmuck that the mailing must be \"part of the execution of the scheme as\nconceived by the perpetrator at the time\" is directed to a different issue: what might be\ncalled an \"inculpatory\" mailing. Schmuck argued that the mailings for which he was\nconvicted (certificates of titles to cars that he had sold after rolling back their\nodometers) actually worked against him by increasing the risk that he would be caught.\nSee id. The Court rejected his argument, holding that it is irrelevant \"whether the\nmailing later, through hindsight, may prove to have been counterproductive and return\nto haunt the perpetrator of the fraud.\" Id. Finn's case is a bit different: here, Finn\nbelieved he had successfully defrauded the Band, but then a change in state law\n\n       12\n        We simplify matters a bit when we say that \"the fraud was complete.\" In fact,\nas the government points out, the indictment alleged that all of Finn's RRM-related\nactions from 1985 on were a part of his scheme to defraud. Our statement that the\nfraud was complete is really a simpler way of saying that the mailings could not have\nfurthered the fraud because Finn had already obtained complete control of the boats.\n\n                                           -25-\n\frequired him to take another step if he wished to retain the fruits of his fraud or convert\nthem to cash. Given the change in the law, the mailings in the instant case increased the\nchances that Finn's fraud would be successful, for they enabled him to present a\npurchaser with prima facie proof of title in a new and official form. Finn's mailings,\ntherefore, are not the inculpatory sort of communications envisioned in Schmuck; they\nare communications that he did not foresee but that he nevertheless was required to\nmake in order to continue the fraud. Finn suggests no authority that a mailing of this\ntype may not suffice to support a mail-fraud conviction, and we see no reason why such\na mailing should not be adequate.\n\n        In essence, Finn seems to be arguing that a defendant who has successfully\nfleeced his victim and gained possession and control of the victim's property may not\nbe convicted of mail fraud based on subsequent mailings. This is not the law. See\nUnited States v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111560\"><a href=\"/opinion/111560/united-states-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 451-52 (1986) (\"Mailings occurring after receipt\nof the goods obtained by fraud are within the statute if they 'were designed to lull the\nvictims into a false sense of security, postpone their ultimate complaint to the\nauthorities, and therefore make the apprehension of the defendants less likely than if no\nmailings had taken place.'\") (quoting United States v.
