Because federal law does not permit condemnation of tribal land,\n\nthe Navajo Nation’s ownership of undivided fractional interests in the parcels presents a\n\nproblem for the company. We affirm the district court’s dismissal of the condemnation\n\naction against the two land parcels in which the Navajo Nation holds an interest.\n\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f                                             I\n\n       No one can feign surprise to learn that the United States government’s treatment\n\nof the original inhabitants of this country has not been a model of justice. The\n\ngovernment spent much of the nineteenth century emptying the eastern part of the\n\ncountry of Indians and sending them west. See Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, 397 U.S.\n\n620, 623-26 (1970). Then, when settlers caught up with the tribes in the west, the\n\ngovernment sought to confine those tribes, and other tribes native to the west, ever more\n\ntightly onto reservations. See, e.g., Williams v. Lee, 358 U.S. 217, 221-23 (1959). Much\n\ntragedy and bloodshed ensued.\n\n       In the late nineteenth century, after the government had largely segregated Indians\n\nfrom the rest of society, Congress changed course. But the new course still harmed Indian\n\ntribes and their members. Instead of excluding tribal members from American society\n\nwhile permitting them some autonomy on the reservations, Congress tried to force tribes\n\nto assimilate into American society, minus much of their autonomy. Congress carved\n\nreservations into allotments and assigned the land parcels to tribal members—surplus\n\nlands were made available to white settlers. So began the Allotment Era. “The objectives\n\nof allotment were simple and clear cut: to extinguish tribal sovereignty, erase reservation\n\nboundaries, and force the assimilation of Indians into the society at large.” Cty. of Yakima\n\nv. Confederated Tribes & Bands of Yakima Indian Nation, 502 U.S. 251, 254 (1992). The\n\nAllotment Era “was fueled in part by the belief that individualized farming would speed\n\nthe Indians’ assimilation into American society and in part by the continuing demand for\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fnew lands for the waves of homesteaders moving West.” Solem v. Bartlett, 465 U.S. 463,\n\n466 (1984).\n\n       Congress began allotting land one tribe at a time and allowed Indians to sell the\n\nland as soon as they received it. Cty. of Yakima, 502 U.S. at 254. Tribal members began\n\nto lose their allotted lands in hasty and even fraudulent transactions. Id. In 1887,\n\nCongress passed the General Allotment Act, commonly known as the Dawes Act, which\n\nallowed the President to apply the allotment process to most tribal lands across the\n\ncountry, without tribal consent. Id. But as a check against the rapid post-allotment loss of\n\nIndian land, Congress also mandated that the federal government would hold Indian-\n\nallotted land in trust for twenty-five years, after which time it would issue a fee patent to\n\nthe allottee or his heirs. Id.\n\n       Despite this attempted protection, “[t]he policy of allotment of Indian lands\n\nquickly proved disastrous for the Indians.” Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.S. 704, 707 (1987). As\n\nallotments spread throughout the country, Indians continued to lose land—by the time the\n\nAllotment Era ended in 1934, as much as two-thirds of allotted lands had passed out of\n\nIndian ownership. Felix S. Cohen, Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law § 1.04\n\n(Nell Jessup Newton, et al. eds., 2012 ed.). Even the twenty-five-year trust protection did\n\nserious harm: “parcels became splintered into multiple undivided interests in land, with\n\nsome parcels having hundreds . . . of owners. Because the land was held in trust and often\n\ncould not be alienated or partitioned, the fractionation problem grew and grew over\n\ntime.” Hodel, 481 U.S. at 707.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       As allotments began to create a checkerboard of tribal, individual Indian, and\n\nindividual non-Indian land interests, Congress passed several right-of-way statutes to\n\nhelp ensure that necessities such as telegraph lines and roads could continue without\n\nencumbrance. See United States v. Okla. Gas & Elec. Co., 127 F.2d 349, 352 (10th Cir.\n\n1942), aff’d, 318 U.S. 206 (1943). In 1901, Congress passed one such Act. Act of\n\nMarch 3, 1901, ch. 832, 31 Stat. 1058 (the Act). The Act’s most relevant section for our\n\npurposes, which is codified at 25 U.S.C. § 357, lies at the center of this appeal:\n\n       Lands allotted in severalty to Indians may be condemned for any public\n       purpose under the laws of the State or Territory where located in the same\n       manner as land owned in fee may be condemned, and the money awarded\n       as damages shall be paid to the allottee.\n\nId. § 3, 31 Stat. 1084 (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. § 357).\n\n       In construing § 357’s meaning, it helps to compare the Act’s preceding paragraph.\n\nId. § 3, 31 Stat. 1083 (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. § 319). Unlike § 357, § 319\n\nlimited the tribes’ exclusive use of tribal lands. Section 319 gave the Secretary of the\n\nInterior authority to grant rights-of-way for telephone and telegraph lines through Indian\n\nreservations, through lands held by Indian tribes or nations in the former Indian Territory,\n\nthrough lands reserved for Indian agencies or schools, and “through any lands which have\n\nbeen allotted in severalty to any individual Indian under any law or treaty.” Id.\n\n       In comparison, § 357 does not mention any condemnation authority for rights-of-\n\nway through Indian reservations and other types of non-allotted tribal lands. And even\n\nwithout that context, we see no language in § 357 that authorizes condemnation of tribal\n\nland, a result Congress has full power to order if it chooses. Cherokee Nation v. S. Kan.\n\n\n                                              8\n\fRy. Co., 135 U.S. 641, 656-57 (1890). Thus, as we have noted, “a plain and clear\n\ndistinction” exists “between the granting of rights-of-way over and across reservations or\n\ntribal lands and those allotted in severalty to restricted Indians.” Okla. Gas & Elec. Co.,\n\n127 F.2d at 354.\n\n       Perhaps the failure to authorize condemnation of tribal lands stemmed from a\n\nbelief that doing so was unnecessary. After all, the Congresses of the Allotment Era\n\n“anticipated the imminent demise of the reservation.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 468. What need\n\nwould a party have to condemn tribal land if soon no tribal lands would exist? And yet\n\nCongress has never enlarged § 357’s condemnation authority even after it has become\n\nclear that tribes and reservations are here to stay.\n\n       In 1934, Congress again shifted course on Indian affairs. But this time, perhaps for\n\nthe first time in American history, the congressional pendulum swung decisively toward\n\nfavoring tribal sovereignty. The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act ended the Allotment\n\nEra—Congress halted allotments, began restoring unallotted surplus land to tribal\n\nownership, and indefinitely extended the twenty-five-year trust period for allotted lands.\n\nIndian Reorganization Act of 1934, ch. 576, 48 Stat. 984 (codified as amended at 25\n\nU.S.C. §§ 5101-5144); Cty. of Yakima, 502 U.S. at 255. Extensive federal efforts later\n\neven began to help tribes buy back lost land—efforts that continue to this day. See, e.g.,\n\nIndian Land Consolidation Act, Pub. L. No. 97-459, 96 Stat. 2515 (1983) (codified as\n\namended at 25 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2221) (setting up mechanisms to consolidate tribal\n\nholdings); Claims Resolution Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-291, 124 Stat. 3064, 3066-\n\n3067 (authorizing a $1.9 billion land buy-back program for tribal nations). Among other\n\n                                               9\n\favenues, tribes may now purchase interests in previously allotted lands, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2212, or inherit less than five percent of an undivided ownership interest through\n\nintestate descent, 25 U.S.C. § 2206(a)(2)(D). And so the tribes and reservations that the\n\nAllotment Era Congresses expected to wither away instead endured.\n\n                                             II\n\n       That history produced, and informs, the case before us. In 1919, the federal\n\ngovernment allotted 160 acres in New Mexico, known as Allotment 1160, to a man\n\nnamed Hostine Sauce, who later became known as Leo Frank, Sr. In 2006, through two\n\nconveyances from beneficial owners as authorized by the Indian Land Consolidation Act,\n\nthe Navajo Nation acquired an undivided 13.6% interest in Allotment 1160. Similarly, in\n\n1921, the federal government allotted another 160 acres in New Mexico, known as\n\nAllotment 1392, to a person named Wuala. In 2009, through intestate descent as\n\nauthorized by the Indian Land Consolidation Act, the Navajo Nation acquired an\n\nundivided 0.14% interest in Allotment 1392. Both allotments are within the exterior\n\nboundaries of the Navajo Nation and have always had protected trust status.\n\n       Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) is a public utility company that\n\nin 1960 obtained a right-of-way from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)—an\n\nagency within the Department of the Interior—for an electric transmission line across the\n\nland now in dispute. The transmission line runs about sixty miles and crosses fifty-seven\n\nland parcels that were once allotted to individual Indians, including the two parcels in\n\nwhich the Navajo Nation now holds an undivided interest.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       The right-of-way had a fifty-year expiration date—so it was set to expire in 2010.\n\nIn November 2009, PNM applied to the Secretary of the Interior for a twenty-year\n\nrenewal of the right-of-way. That application process was created by the 1948 Indian\n\nRight-of-Way Act, Act of Feb. 5, 1948, ch. 45, 62 Stat. 17-18 (codified at 25 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 323-328), which mandates that “[n]o grant of a right-of-way over and across any lands\n\nbelonging to a tribe . . . shall be made without the consent of the proper tribal officials.”\n\n25 U.S.C. § 324. The regulations stemming from the 1948 Act affirm the necessity for\n\ntribal consent. See, e.g., 25 C.F.R. § 169.107(a) (2016) (“For a right-of-way across tribal\n\nland, the applicant must obtain tribal consent, in the form of a tribal authorization and a\n\nwritten agreement with the tribe . . . .”). For land parcels held in trust for individual\n\nIndians, the Secretary of the Interior can grant rights-of-way so long as the holders of a\n\nmajority of interests consent. 25 U.S.C. § 324.\n\n       The renewal process began smoothly for PNM. The Navajo Nation gave written\n\nconsent for the right-of-way through lands in which the United States holds the entire\n\ninterest in trust. In addition, PNM obtained consent from a majority of beneficial-interest\n\nowners for the parcels that had been allotted and in which the United States holds interest\n\nin trust. So in November 2009, the BIA began to process PNM’s renewal application. But\n\nenough individual Indian owners in five land parcels revoked their consent to tip the total\n\nconsenting to less than 50% of the fractional interests. In January 2015, the BIA notified\n\nPNM that it could not approve the renewal application without that consent.\n\n       On June 13, 2015, PNM filed a complaint in federal district court in New Mexico\n\nseeking to condemn the fifty-foot-wide right-of-way through the five parcels for which\n\n                                              11\n\fthe company no longer had consent. The complaint alleges federal-question jurisdiction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331, pleading a claim under § 3 of the 1901 Act, codified at\n\n25 U.S.C. § 357. PNM alleged that § 357 authorizes the condemnation of any land ever\n\nallotted to Indians, whoever might later own the land. Unlike the twenty-year renewal\n\nperiod that PNM sought in the application process, PNM’s complaint sought a perpetual\n\nright-of-way. The complaint named as defendants all parties holding interest in the five\n\nparcels, including the Navajo Nation and the United States.\n\n       In December 2015, the district court dismissed without prejudice—for lack of\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction—PNM’s condemnation claims for the two parcels in which\n\nthe Navajo Nation holds an interest. The court stayed the claims for the other three\n\nparcels pending the resolution of this appeal. The court held that § 357 does not authorize\n\ncondemnation of land in which a tribe has acquired an interest. The court concluded that\n\n“[t]he Nation cannot be considered as an owner of ‘lands allotted in severalty to\n\nIndians.’” Appellant App. vol. 1 at 137 (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 357). Tribal interest in the\n\nland ends allotted-land status.1 The court reminded PNM that it could still pursue a\n\nvoluntary easement.\n\n       Rather than take that course, PNM moved the court to reconsider and set aside the\n\ndismissal. Alternatively, PNM asked the district court to certify four interlocutory-appeal\n\n       1\n         The district court also concluded that the Navajo Nation was a required party\nto the condemnation action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) because of the Nation’s\ninterest in the land to be condemned, but one that could not be joined because of\nsovereign immunity. And the court found that under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b), “in equity\nand good conscience” the condemnation action could not proceed without the Nation.\nAppellant App. vol. 1 at 155.\n\n                                            12\n\fquestions. In March 2016, the district court issued an order that affirmed its earlier\n\ndecision and elaborated on its reasoning: “PNM’s ‘once an allotment always an\n\nallotment’ rule is not supported by any case law authority or the plain language of § 357\n\nand its historical context.” Appellant App. vol. 2 at 304. In response to PNM’s policy\n\narguments about the negative consequences of not allowing condemnation, the court\n\nreminded PNM that, even if negotiation should fail—which the Navajo Nation and the\n\nUnited States argued PNM had not shown was inevitable—it was “up to Congress, not\n\nthis Court, to open up the condemnation avenue over trust lands fractionally owned by\n\ntribes.” Id. at 320.\n\n       The district court granted PNM’s request to certify four questions of law for\n\ninterlocutory appeal:\n\n       I.      Does 25 U.S.C. § 357 authorize a condemnation action against a\n               parcel of allotted land in which the United States holds fee title in\n               trust for an Indian tribe, which has a fractional beneficial interest in\n               the parcel?\n\n       II.     Is an Indian tribe that holds a fractional beneficial interest in a parcel\n               of allotted land a required party to a condemnation action brought\n               under 25 U.S.C. § 357?\n\n       III.    Does an Indian tribe that holds a fractional beneficial interest in a\n               parcel of allotted land have sovereign immunity against a\n               condemnation action brought under 25 U.S.C. § 357?\n\n       IV.     If an Indian tribe that holds a fractional beneficial interest in a parcel\n               of allotted land has sovereign immunity against, and cannot be\n               joined in, a condemnation action brought under 25 U.S.C. § 357, can\n               a condemnation action proceed in the absence of the Indian tribe?\n\nId. at 324.\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       The district court also denied PNM’s request to sever the company’s claims\n\nagainst the two parcels with Navajo Nation interests, concluding that it was better to stay\n\nthe claims for the other three allotments pending the resolution of the interlocutory\n\nappeal. PNM has appealed the four certified questions.\n\n                                              III\n\n       Because we affirm the district court’s decision, we need reach only the first\n\nquestion certified for appeal: does § 357 authorize condemnation against land in which\n\nthe United States holds fee title in trust for an Indian tribe, when the tribe has a fractional\n\nbeneficial interest in the parcel?2 We review de novo the district court’s statutory\n\ninterpretation of § 357. United States v. Martinez, 812 F.3d 1200, 1202 (10th Cir. 2015).\n\nBut we also note an important canon of construction that applies to this case. “A well-\n\nestablished canon of Indian law states that ‘statutes are to be construed liberally in favor\n\nof the Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.’” N.L.R.B. v.\n\nPueblo of San Juan, 276 F.3d 1186, 1191 (10th Cir. 2002) (quoting Montana v. Blackfeet\n\nTribe, 471 U.S. 759, 766 (1985)).\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         Though we need not reach the other questions raised on appeal, we note that\nthe district court’s orders provide thorough and well-reasoned bases to affirm on\neach. The court’s orders are especially persuasive on the question of tribal immunity,\nwhich the court rightly observes must be abrogated unequivocally, not implicitly, by\nCongress. See Nanomantube v. Kickapoo Tribe in Kan., 631 F.3d 1150, 1152 (10th\nCir. 2011). PNM offers evidence of only implicit abrogation. We take note of this to\ndemonstrate that even had PNM prevailed on the § 357 statutory question, it still\nwould have had a long, difficult road ahead before its condemnation action could\nproceed.\n\n                                              14\n\f       In matters of statutory construction, we “must begin with the language employed\n\nby Congress” and assume that “the ordinary meaning of that language accurately\n\nexpresses the legislative purpose,” so we look to the plain language of § 357. Engine\n\nMfrs. Ass’n v. S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252 (2004) (quoting\n\nPark ’N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 194 (1985)). “Allotment” is\n\nan Indian-law term of art that refers to land awarded to an individual allottee from a\n\ncommon holding. Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v. United States, 406 U.S. 128, 142\n\n(1972). No one disputes that PNM may seek condemnation of any land parcel previously\n\nallotted and whose current beneficial owners are individual Indians. The language of\n\n§ 357 plainly authorizes such actions.\n\n       But starkly absent from § 357’s language is any similar authorization for tribal\n\nlands. Tribal lands go unmentioned. As we have already noted, that absence in § 357\n\nsharply contrasts with the paragraph immediately preceding § 357, which is part of the\n\nsame section of the Act, but is codified at 25 U.S.C. § 319. Section 319 authorized the\n\nSecretary of the Interior to grant certain rights-of-way over reservations and other lands\n\nheld by tribes, as well as allotted lands. See 25 U.S.C. § 319. And none of PNM’s cited\n\ncases support its broad contention, let alone in this context, that “[f]or more than a\n\ncentury, the plain meaning of Section 357 has been that if a particular parcel is allotted\n\nland, that parcel may be condemned regardless of which persons or entities own\n\nfractional interests in such parcel.” Appellant Opening Br. at 10; see United States v.\n\nClarke, 445 U.S. 253, 254 (1980) (finding that § 357 authorizes condemnation via a\n\nformal procedure by the condemning authority, not by physical occupation and inverse\n\n                                             15\n\fcondemnation for compensation); S. Cal. Edison Co. v. Rice, 685 F.2d 354, 356 (9th Cir.\n\n1982) (noting that § 357 treats individual Indian allottees like any other private\n\nlandowners for condemnation purposes and finding that their lands are not in use for a\n\npublic purpose). The statutory silence for condemnation of tribal lands, then, poses a\n\nserious obstacle for PNM.\n\n       PNM tries to circumvent that obstacle by asking us to make several implicit\n\nconclusions. First, it asks us to view what happened during the Allotment Era as a\n\npermanent brand on Native land: that upon Congress’s taking tribal lands and chopping\n\nthem into allotments, Congress forever rendered all those lands as “lands allotted” within\n\n§ 357’s meaning. Later changes in ownership cannot matter, PNM argues, and neither\n\ncan the amount of the interest that a tribe acquires: in PNM’s view, even lands that a tribe\n\nfully reobtains are “[l]ands allotted in severalty to Indians.” 25 U.S.C. § 357. This is\n\nPNM’s proposed rule that “once an allotment always an allotment”—rejected by the\n\ndistrict court for lack of legal and historical backing. Appellant App. vol. 2 at 304. In\n\nsupport of this novel rule, PNM relies on the historical context underlying the 1901 Act.\n\nBy PNM’s reckoning, the Congresses of the Allotment Era wanted and expected tribes\n\nand reservations to soon be relics of the past—so they could hardly have expected that\n\n“any fractional beneficial interests would ever be transferred to the very tribe from whose\n\nreservation the lands had been removed by allotment.” Appellant Opening Br. at 11.\n\n       Though we acknowledge the historical record, it provides us no license to\n\ndisregard or slant § 357’s plain language. Congress has neither enacted nor amended\n\n§ 357 to establish that ever-allotted status would permanently trump any later tribal\n\n                                             16\n\facquisitions.3 In a different setting, the Supreme Court has refused “to extrapolate from\n\nthis expectation [of the demise of reservations]” an intent to diminish a reservation.\n\nSolem, 465 U.S. at 468. Likewise, here we refuse to extrapolate from that expectation to\n\namend the plain language of § 357. Even if § 357 were ambiguous, we still would apply\n\nthe Indian-law canon to rule in favor of tribal sovereignty and against a permanent anti-\n\ntribal-land classification. Section 357 does not reach tribal lands, even if land reobtains\n\nthat status long after it was allotted.\n\n                                             IV\n\n       We must next clarify what qualifies as tribal land for the purposes of § 357. We\n\nhave ruled that § 357 reaches allotted land even after that land has passed to individual\n\nheirs of the allottees. Transok Pipeline Co. v. Darks, 565 F.2d 1150, 1153 (10th Cir.\n\n1977). As explained above, we reject PNM’s contention that any land ever allotted\n\nforever becomes “[l]ands allotted” within § 357’s meaning, even when the tribe later\n\nfully reacquires and owns that land. But we still must decide what happens when tribes\n\nacquire a fractional interest. For the two mixed-ownership parcels at issue here, the\n\nNavajo Nation holds such fractional-ownership interests—a 13.6% interest in Allotment\n\n1160, and a 0.14% interest in Allotment 1392.\n\n\n\n       3\n         In our view, PNM’s reading of § 357 requires inserting language that is not\nthere, as shown by the missing language included in the brackets: “[All Tribal] Lands\n[ever] allotted in severalty to Indians [, regardless of whether they return to tribal\nownership,] may be condemned for any public purpose under the laws of the State or\nTerritory where located in the same manner as land owned in fee may be condemned,\nand the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the allottee.”\n\n                                             17\n\f       In Nebraska Public Power District v. 100.95 Acres of Land in Thurston County,\n\n719 F.2d 956, 961-62 (8th Cir. 1983), the Eighth Circuit confronted a similar question.\n\nThere, the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska held undivided future interests in land that a\n\npublic utility company sought to condemn. Id. at 957-58. The court held that those future\n\ninterests sufficed to make the relevant parcels tribal land, beyond § 357’s condemnation\n\nreach. Id. at 961-62. For support, the court considered a regulation promulgated under the\n\n1948 Right-of-Way Act (codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 323-328).4 Id. at 962. That regulation,\n\nand its amended version, treats any tribal interest as sufficient to establish tribal-land\n\nstatus. See id. (“‘Tribal land’ means land or any interest therein, title to which is held by\n\nthe United States in trust for a tribe . . . .” (quoting 25 C.F.R. § 169.1(d) (1983)));\n\n25 C.F.R. § 169.2 (2016) (“Tribal land means any tract in which the surface estate, or an\n\nundivided interest in the surface estate, is owned by one or more tribes in trust or\n\nrestricted status.”). The BIA has also clarified that “a tract is considered ‘tribal land’ if\n\nany interest, fractional or whole, is owned by the tribe. A tract in which both a tribe and\n\nindividual Indians own fractional interest is considered tribal land for the purposes of\n\nregulations applicable to tribal land.” Rights-of-Way on Indian Land, 80 Fed. Reg.\n\n72,492, 72,497 (Nov. 19, 2015) (codified at 25 C.F.R. pt. 169). In doing so, the BIA\n\n\n       4\n         A district court in our circuit, also looking to the regulations for clues,\nsimilarly found that because a tribe “owns an undivided 1.1% interest in the tract that\nis held in trust, the Court finds that the tract is tribal land and cannot be condemned\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 357. The Court, therefore, finds that it does not have subject\nmatter jurisdiction over this action.” Enable Okla. Intrastate Transmission, LLC v.\nA 25 Foot Wide Easement, No. CIV-15-1250-M, 2016 WL 4402061, at *3 (W.D.\nOkla. Aug. 18, 2016).\n\n                                              18\n\frejected opposing views that would have limited tribal land to tracts not individually\n\nowned or in which the tribe holds a majority interest. Id. The BIA also noted that the\n\ndifferent treatment afforded to individual and tribal interests befits the unique\n\ngovernment-to-government relationship between the United States and Native tribes, and\n\nfederal attempts to promote tribal self-governance. Id. at 72,492. Thus, even if tribal\n\ninterest does not constitute a majority interest, tribal consent is still required for a right-\n\nof-way. Id. at 72,509.\n\n       These regulations have a limited impact on our interpretation of § 357 because\n\nthey do not apply to condemnation actions. Id. at 72,495, 72,517. PNM views the\n\ninapplicability of the regulations as a critical point, arguing that the district court and the\n\nEighth Circuit erred by considering them. PNM ignores that the district court went to\n\ngreat lengths to explain that the regulations were referenced “only to amplify” the court’s\n\nconclusion about tribal lands based on § 357’s plain meaning. Appellant App. vol. 2\n\nat 311. We view the regulations similarly. Faced with a definition based on the federal\n\ngovernment’s long-stated policy goal of respecting tribal sovereignty, PNM gives us no\n\nalternative definition other than its extreme position that § 357 reaches even land held\n\nentirely by a tribe. In essence, we face two choices: (1) concluding that all land ever\n\nallotted is subject to condemnation under § 357, even if a tribe reobtains a majority or\n\ntotal interest in it, or (2) concluding that even previously allotted land that a tribe\n\nreobtains any interest in becomes tribal land beyond condemnation under § 357.\n\nGoverned by § 357’s plain language, we must choose the latter approach. We side with\n\nthe Eighth Circuit and agree with the district court’s conclusion: “When all or part of a\n\n                                               19\n\fparcel of allotted land owned by one or more individuals is transferred to the United\n\nStates in trust for a tribe; that land becomes ‘tribal land’ not subject to condemnation\n\nunder § 357.” Id. at 304.5\n\n                                             V\n\n         PNM argues that Congress would not have encouraged tribes to increase their\n\ntribal lands under land buy-back and consolidation programs if it had believed that it\n\ncorrespondingly was shrinking § 357 condemnation authority for those reacquired lands.\n\nAnd if that is so, PNM argues that this shows Congress never intended tribal lands to be\n\nexempt from condemnation under § 357. We reject these arguments. First, Congress has\n\nknown about the Eighth Circuit’s case for 34 years and has not amended § 357 to allow\n\ncondemnation of tribal lands. Second, the Acts creating tribal buy-back and consolidation\n\nprograms say nothing about allowing condemnation on tribes’ reacquired land. So we\n\nmust conclude that § 357, as in 1901, does not give condemnation authority over tribal\n\nlands.\n\n         PNM complains that our interpretation of § 357 will create “stranded”\n\ninfrastructure on tribal land for which it will now have no choice but to negotiate\n\nrights-of-way with the tribes or face trespass actions. Appellant Reply Br. at 26. PNM\n\ngoes so far as to raise, without elaboration, the specter of a due-process deprivation.\n\n         5\n         Because we hold that the tribal interests make Allotments 1160 and 1392\ntribal land for the purposes of § 357, PNM cannot proceed with a condemnation\naction against the individual interests in the parcels while leaving the tribal interests\nundisturbed. Holding otherwise would accomplish little other than to waste judicial\nresources, and those of PNM, as PNM would still need tribal consent before it could\nobtain a right-of-way under 25 U.S.C. § 324.\n\n                                             20\n\f       But PNM has no legal backing for its interpretation. No court has held that § 357\n\nallows condemnation of tribal land, whether the tribal interest is fractional, future, or\n\nwhole. The only major decision on point is Nebraska Public Power District, decided by\n\nthe Eighth Circuit in 1983, holding that any tribal interest, including undivided future\n\ninterests, acquired by the tribe after allotment defeats any condemnation authority\n\nprovided in § 357. 719 F.2d at 961-62. In managing the transmission line in this case and\n\nits other infrastructure, PNM had every reason to know about the Eighth Circuit case, as\n\nwell as the reigning canon of construction favoring tribal sovereignty. PNM invested in\n\nthe face of adverse precedent and with no supportive case law at its back. Whatever\n\nnegative policy effects it claims may follow, PNM’s remedy lies elsewhere.\n\n                                             VI\n\n       Because the Navajo Nation did not acquire its undivided fractional interests by\n\nallotment, PNM argues that the Nation is a mere successor-in-interest under § 357. See\n\nTransok, 565 F.2d at 1153. All agree that the Navajo Nation acquired its interests in the\n\ndisputed parcels by the congressionally approved mechanisms of conveyance and\n\nintestate descent. The issue is not how the tribe acquired the land, but instead what is the\n\nland’s present status now that the tribe has acquired it. As discussed, we hold that the\n\nland is now tribal land and thus beyond the reach of condemnation.\n\n       PNM also attempts to make a distinction where none exists. PNM argues that it\n\ndoes not seek to divest the tribe of its fractional interest, but instead merely to condemn a\n\nright-of-way on its land. We acknowledge as much, but § 357 contains no authorization\n\nfor any tribal-land condemnation, whether by divestiture or otherwise. Because we have\n\n                                             21\n\fdetermined that Allotments 1160 and 1392 are tribal land, PNM cannot force\n\ncondemnation.\n\n       In addition, PNM argues that § 357 supports PNM’s condemnation authority by\n\nthe manner in which it provides for condemnation payments. Section 357 provides that\n\nmoney awarded as damages from a condemnation action “shall be paid to the allottee.”\n\nPNM seizes upon this language and, combined with the United States’ off-handed\n\nobservation that the payment language also applies to an allottee’s heirs, uses it to argue\n\nthat, if § 357 reaches heirs despite a lack of explicit textual reference, must not § 357\n\nreach tribes also? In this argument, PNM once again suggests that tribes (like heirs) are\n\nmere successors-in-interest. But unlike ordinary heirs inheriting interests in land, tribes\n\nare “sovereign political entities possessed of sovereign authority.” Nanomantube v.\n\nKickapoo Tribe in Kan., 631 F.3d 1150, 1151-52 (10th Cir. 2011). That Congress allows\n\ntribes to inherit and purchase interests in previously allotted land does not mean that\n\nCongress subjects the reacquired tribal lands to condemnation under § 357. Absent\n\nexplicit authorization, tribal sovereignty prevails.\n\n       PNM also argues that the significance of a tribal interest on an ever-allotted land\n\nparcel depends on the statutory meaning of the word “lands” itself. Because\n\ncondemnation is an “in rem” action, PNM argues, § 357 does not, and we should not,\n\nconsider who owns interest in the “lands” as a relevant factor in determining § 357’s\n\nreach. Appellant Opening Br. at 25-28; Appellant Reply Br. at 9. But as the district court\n\nnoted, a § 357 proceeding is not a pure in rem proceeding. Thus, under § 357, we look\n\nnot only to what lands are at issue, but to their ownership. Here, because the tribe owns\n\n                                              22\n\fan interest in the disputed parcels, § 357’s “[l]ands allotted in severalty to Indians”\n\nprerequisite is inapplicable and so the law gives PNM no authority to condemn. And that\n\ndeprives us of federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\n       Finally, PNM argues that interpreting § 357 as we do will leave it vulnerable to\n\ntrespass actions and paying higher compensation to obtain consent. Worse, it argues,\n\nbecause of congressional efforts to help tribes buy back interest in lands lost during the\n\nAllotment Era, the availability of condemnation under § 357 will continue to shrink as\n\ntribes avail themselves of well-funded programs enabling them to buy back formerly\n\ntribal land. This, PNM argues, amounts to an implied partial repeal of § 357, a position\n\nbuilt upon its view that § 357 allows condemnation of tribal lands. Because we reject that\n\nview, the argument has no force.\n\n       Nor do we believe that PNM’s unfavorable policy outcome necessarily comes\n\nfrom Congress overlooking it. In the 116 years after the 1901 Act, Congress has not\n\namended § 357 to favor PNM’s interpretation. Nor has it responded to Nebraska Public\n\nPower District in the thirty-four years since the Eighth Circuit decided that case\n\ndisfavoring similar arguments to PNM’s. Instead, Congress has acted to protect and\n\nstrengthen tribal sovereignty. See, e.g., Rights-of-Way on Indian Land, 80 Fed. Reg.\n\nat 72,509 (observing that requiring tribal consent for a right-of-way “restores a measure\n\nof tribal sovereignty over Indian lands and is consistent with principles of tribal self-\n\ngovernance that animate modern Federal Indian policy”); U.S. Dep’t of Interior, Updated\n\nImplementation Plan, Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations 10, 23, 31 (2013)\n\n(noting that a “foundational goal” of the buy-back program is “to strengthen tribal\n\n                                             23\n\fsovereignty” and prioritizing acquisitions to accomplish that goal); see also Michigan v.\n\nBay Mills Indian Cmty., 134 S. Ct. 2024, 2043 (2014) (Sotomayor, J., concurring) (noting\n\nthat a “key goal of the Federal Government is to render Tribes more self-sufficient”);\n\nWhite Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker, 448 U.S. 136, 143-44 (1980) (recognizing that\n\nCongress has demonstrated “a firm federal policy of promoting tribal self-sufficiency”\n\nand “tribal independence”).\n\n       PNM’s claims that condemnation serves the interest of the tribe and its members\n\nby allowing continued operation of transmission lines on tribal land are likewise best\n\ndirected elsewhere. Such claims may be valuable during negotiations for voluntary\n\nrights-of-way. If the tribe does not accept such claims as true, that is the tribe’s\n\nprerogative.\n\n                                             VII\n\n       We also deny the motion to intervene of Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC\n\n(Transwestern). Transwestern first entered this case as a party after PNM named it as\n\na defendant possibly having an interest in the property involved in the condemnation\n\naction. Transwestern has a right-of-way crossing parts of Allotment 1392, but not the\n\npart that PNM sought to condemn. So Transwestern disclaimed any interest in the\n\neasements that PNM sought and also waived any future notice of the proceedings.\n\nWhen the Navajo Nation filed a motion to dismiss, Transwestern chose not to file an\n\nopposing brief. At the district court, the Navajo Nation and the United States argued\n\nthat the land in dispute was tribal land beyond § 357’s condemnation authority. When\n\nthe district court dismissed PNM’s condemnation action for Allotments 1160 and\n\n                                              24\n\f1392, Transwestern concurred with PNM’s motion to alter or amend the Dismissal\n\nOrder and its request for certification of issues for interlocutory appeal. In addition,\n\nTranswestern filed an “Answer and/or Cross-Petition” in support of PNM’s Petition\n\nfor Permission to Appeal. Transwestern Intervention Reply Br. at 5. When\n\nTranswestern filed a motion to participate as a party on appeal, we denied it, allowing\n\nTranswestern instead to move to intervene or appear as amicus.\n\n      We evaluate motions to intervene on appeal based on the four requirements of\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a): (1) an applicant’s timely application, (2) an “interest relating to\n\nthe property or transaction which is the subject of the action,” (3) possible\n\nimpairment or impediment of that interest, and (4) lack of adequate representation of\n\nthat interest by existing parties. Elliott Indus. Ltd. P’ship v. BP Am. Prod. Co., 407\n\nF.3d 1091, 1103 (10th Cir. 2005). Though we usually take a liberal view of\n\nRule 24(a), when an applicant has not sought intervention in the district court, we\n\npermit it on appeal “only in an exceptional case for imperative reasons.” Id. at 1103\n\n(quoting Hutchinson v. Pfeil, 211 F.3d 515, 519 (10th Cir. 2000)). We do not\n\ninterpret Rule 24(a) as imposing “rigid, technical requirements,” but instead read it as\n\ncapturing the practical circumstances that justify intervention. San Juan Cty. v.\n\nUnited States, 503 F.3d 1163, 1195 (10th Cir. 2007) (en banc). Under these\n\nstandards, we conclude that we must deny Transwestern’s motion to intervene.\n\n      First, PNM is adequately representing Transwestern’s interest in the case.\n\nWhen the applicant and an existing party share an identical legal objective, we\n\npresume that the party’s representation is adequate. Tri-State Generation &\n\n                                           25\n\fTransmission Ass’n, Inc. v. N.M. Pub. Regulation Comm’n, 787 F.3d 1068, 1072-73\n\n(10th Cir. 2015). Here, PNM and Transwestern have the same legal objective—\n\nprevailing on their interpretation that § 357 allows condemnation of land ever allotted\n\nto Indians in severalty, even when a tribe later reacquires an interest.\n\n      Second, Transwestern had ample opportunity to be heard at the district court\n\nand declined to do so. At the most consequential phase of the district court\n\nproceedings—the Navajo Nation’s ultimately successful motion to dismiss—\n\nTranswestern declined to participate in briefing. Both the Navajo Nation and the\n\nUnited States raised the now-disputed issue of the scope of § 357 in the district court.\n\nTranswestern has already had the opportunity it now seeks and let it slip by.6\n\n      Transwestern argues that an adverse decision for PNM in this case would\n\nsignificantly affect its own extensive network of energy infrastructure. That seems\n\nlikely. But that was equally true in the district court, where Transwestern declined to\n\nmake its arguments. We see little that has changed in the meantime, except perhaps a\n\nheightened fear of an unfavorable decision.\n\n      Nor is Transwestern being excluded from the case. All parties consent to\n\nTranswestern’s status as amicus curiae, and we have considered the company’s\n\n\n      6\n         We decline to decide whether the United States is correct in its allegation that\nTranswestern engaged in “sandbagging tactics” by willfully holding back arguments\nin the district court in hopes of more favorable treatment on appeal. United States\nIntervention Br. at 2. But opening the door to such tactics is another reason weighing\nagainst allowing Transwestern’s intervention. See Richison v. Ernest Group, Inc., 634\nF.3d 1123, 1127 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n\n                                           26\n\fbriefed arguments. But Transwestern’s legal objective duplicates PNM’s, and its\n\narguments come too late for us to grant intervention.7\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of the\n\ncondemnation action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction as to the two land parcels\n\nin which the Navajo Nation holds an interest.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         Granting Transwestern’s motion to intervene would not change the outcome\nof the case. The company offers only one relevant argument that was not\nsubstantially raised by the appellant: that the Supreme Court in County of Yakima\nallowed the local county to tax lands that had been earlier allotted from a tribal\nreservation, that had passed out of trust status into fee-simple status, and that later\nhad been repurchased by the tribe. 502 U.S. at 270. Transwestern argues that this\nshows that the Supreme Court recognizes the permanence of a land’s allotment status\neven after the tribe re-obtains the land. Thus, in our case, Transwestern argues, we\nshould recognize the permanence of the disputed land’s allotment status even after a\ntribal purchase and inheritance.\n        But County of Yakima differs from our case in at least one key aspect—here,\nthe land never became fee-simple land. Instead, it has always retained its status as\nheld in trust by the United States. What County of Yakima turned on was not\nallotment status, but fee-simple status. The Court held that once land had become\nfee-simple land, the tribe could not unilaterally return it to protected status and\nexempt itself from ad valorem taxes via its purchase. Id. The Court did not give any\nindependent meaning to allotment status—it simply reviewed that history to show\nwhy the relevant Act of Congress resulted in the land being held in fee-simple status.\nId. at 254-56, 258-60. Moreover, a case on local tax authority does not automatically\ncompel us to adopt the same principles for condemnations.\n        PNM raised a similar argument in the district court based on Oneida Tribe of\nIndians of Wisconsin v. Village of Hobart, 542 F. Supp. 2d 908 (E.D. Wis. 2008), and\nthe district court rejected it for the same fee-title status versus trust status divide that\nwe have just discussed. PNM did not raise the case again on appeal.\n\n\n                                            27\n\f",

Because federal law does not permit condemnation of tribal land,\n\nthe Navajo Nation’s ownership of undivided fractional interests in the parcels presents a\n\nproblem for the company.

The\n\ngovernment spent much of the nineteenth century emptying the eastern part of the\n\ncountry of Indians and sending them west. See Choctaw Nation v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108130\"><a href=\"/opinion/108130/choctaw-nation-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">620</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 623-26 (1970). Then, when settlers caught up with the tribes in the west, the\n\ngovernment sought to confine those tribes, and other tribes native to the west, ever more\n\ntightly onto reservations. See, e.g., Williams v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105807\"><a href=\"/opinion/105807/williams-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221-23 (1959). Much\n\ntragedy and bloodshed ensued.\n\n       In the late nineteenth century, after the government had largely segregated Indians\n\nfrom the rest of society, Congress changed course. But the new course still harmed Indian\n\ntribes and their members. Instead of excluding tribal members from American society\n\nwhile permitting them some autonomy on the reservations, Congress tried to force tribes\n\nto assimilate into American society, minus much of their autonomy. Congress carved\n\nreservations into allotments and assigned the land parcels to tribal members—surplus\n\nlands were made available to white settlers. So began the Allotment Era. “The objectives\n\nof allotment were simple and clear cut: to extinguish tribal sovereignty, erase reservation\n\nboundaries, and force the assimilation of Indians into the society at large.” Cty. of Yakima\n\nv. Confederated Tribes & Bands of Yakima Indian Nation, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112674\"><a href=\"/opinion/112674/countyof-yakima-v-confederated-tribes-and-bands-of-yakima-nation/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254 (1992). The\n\nAllotment Era “was fueled in part by the belief that individualized farming would speed\n\nthe Indians’ assimilation into American society and in part by the continuing demand for\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fnew lands for the waves of homesteaders moving West.” Solem v.

Cty. of Yakima, 502 U.S. at 254. Tribal members began\n\nto lose their allotted lands in hasty and even fraudulent transactions. Id. In 1887,\n\nCongress passed the General Allotment Act, commonly known as the Dawes Act, which\n\nallowed the President to apply the allotment process to most tribal lands across the\n\ncountry, without tribal consent. Id. But as a check against the rapid post-allotment loss of\n\nIndian land, Congress also mandated that the federal government would hold Indian-\n\nallotted land in trust for twenty-five years, after which time it would issue a fee patent to\n\nthe allottee or his heirs. Id.\n\n       Despite this attempted protection, “[t]he policy of allotment of Indian lands\n\nquickly proved disastrous for the Indians.” Hodel v. Irving, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111887\"><a href=\"/opinion/111887/hodel-v-irving/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">704</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707 (1987). As\n\nallotments spread throughout the country, Indians continued to lose land—by the time the\n\nAllotment Era ended in 1934, as much as two-thirds of allotted lands had passed out of\n\nIndian ownership. Felix S. Cohen, Cohen’s Handbook of Federal Indian Law § 1.04\n\n(Nell Jessup Newton, et al. eds., 2012 ed.). Even the twenty-five-year trust protection did\n\nserious harm: “parcels became splintered into multiple undivided interests in land, with\n\nsome parcels having hundreds . . . of owners. Because the land was held in trust and often\n\ncould not be alienated or partitioned, the fractionation problem grew and grew over\n\ntime.” Hodel, 481 U.S. at 707.\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f       As allotments began to create a checkerboard of tribal, individual Indian, and\n\nindividual non-Indian land interests, Congress passed several right-of-way statutes to\n\nhelp ensure that necessities such as telegraph lines and roads could continue without\n\nencumbrance. See United States v. Okla. Gas & Elec. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">349</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 352 (10th Cir.\n\n1942), aff’d, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103781\"><a href=\"/opinion/103781/united-states-v-oklahoma-gas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1943). In 1901, Congress passed one such Act. Act of\n\nMarch 3, 1901, ch. 832, 31 Stat. 1058 (the Act). The Act’s most relevant section for our\n\npurposes, which is codified at 25 U.S.C. § 357, lies at the center of this appeal:\n\n       Lands allotted in severalty to Indians may be condemned for any public\n       purpose under the laws of the State or Territory where located in the same\n       manner as land owned in fee may be condemned, and the money awarded\n       as damages shall be paid to the allottee.\n\nId. § 3, 31 Stat. 1084 (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. § 357).\n\n       In construing § 357’s meaning, it helps to compare the Act’s preceding paragraph.\n\nId. § 3, 31 Stat. 1083 (codified as amended at 25 U.S.C. § 319). Unlike § 357, § 319\n\nlimited the tribes’ exclusive use of tribal lands. Section 319 gave the Secretary of the\n\nInterior authority to grant rights-of-way for telephone and telegraph lines through Indian\n\nreservations, through lands held by Indian tribes or nations in the former Indian Territory,\n\nthrough lands reserved for Indian agencies or schools, and “through any lands which have\n\nbeen allotted in severalty to any individual Indian under any law or treaty.” Id.\n\n       In comparison, § 357 does not mention any condemnation authority for rights-of-\n\nway through Indian reservations and other types of non-allotted tribal lands. And even\n\nwithout that context, we see no language in § 357 that authorizes condemnation of tribal\n\nland, a result Congress has full power to order if it chooses. Cherokee Nation v. S. Kan.\n\n\n                                              8\n\fRy. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"92808\"><a href=\"/opinion/92808/cherokee-nation-v-southern-kansas-r-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656-57 (1890). Thus, as we have noted, “a plain and clear\n\ndistinction” exists “between the granting of rights-of-way over and across reservations or\n\ntribal lands and those allotted in severalty to restricted Indians.” Okla. Gas & Elec. Co.,\n\n127 F.2d at 354.\n\n       Perhaps the failure to authorize condemnation of tribal lands stemmed from a\n\nbelief that doing so was unnecessary. After all, the Congresses of the Allotment Era\n\n“anticipated the imminent demise of the reservation.” Solem, 465 U.S. at 468. What need\n\nwould a party have to condemn tribal land if soon no tribal lands would exist? And yet\n\nCongress has never enlarged § 357’s condemnation authority even after it has become\n\nclear that tribes and reservations are here to stay.\n\n       In 1934, Congress again shifted course on Indian affairs. But this time, perhaps for\n\nthe first time in American history, the congressional pendulum swung decisively toward\n\nfavoring tribal sovereignty. The 1934 Indian Reorganization Act ended the Allotment\n\nEra—Congress halted allotments, began restoring unallotted surplus land to tribal\n\nownership, and indefinitely extended the twenty-five-year trust period for allotted lands.\n\nIndian Reorganization Act of 1934, ch. 576, 48 Stat. 984 (codified as amended at 25\n\nU.S.C. §§ 5101-5144); Cty. of Yakima, 502 U.S. at 255. Extensive federal efforts later\n\neven began to help tribes buy back lost land—efforts that continue to this day. See, e.g.,\n\nIndian Land Consolidation Act, Pub. L. No. 97-459, 96 Stat. 2515 (1983) (codified as\n\namended at 25 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2221) (setting up mechanisms to consolidate tribal\n\nholdings); Claims Resolution Act of 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-291, 124 Stat. 3064, 3066-\n\n3067 (authorizing a $1.9 billion land buy-back program for tribal nations). Among other\n\n                                               9\n\favenues, tribes may now purchase interests in previously allotted lands, 25 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2212, or inherit less than five percent of an undivided ownership interest through\n\nintestate descent, 25 U.S.C. § 2206(a)(2)(D). And so the tribes and reservations that the\n\nAllotment Era Congresses expected to wither away instead endured.\n\n                                             II\n\n       That history produced, and informs, the case before us. In 1919, the federal\n\ngovernment allotted 160 acres in New Mexico, known as Allotment 1160, to a man\n\nnamed Hostine Sauce, who later became known as Leo Frank, Sr. In 2006, through two\n\nconveyances from beneficial owners as authorized by the Indian Land Consolidation Act,\n\nthe Navajo Nation acquired an undivided 13.6% interest in Allotment 1160. Similarly, in\n\n1921, the federal government allotted another 160 acres in New Mexico, known as\n\nAllotment 1392, to a person named Wuala. In 2009, through intestate descent as\n\nauthorized by the Indian Land Consolidation Act, the Navajo Nation acquired an\n\nundivided 0.14% interest in Allotment 1392. Both allotments are within the exterior\n\nboundaries of the Navajo Nation and have always had protected trust status.\n\n       Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM) is a public utility company that\n\nin 1960 obtained a right-of-way from the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)—an\n\nagency within the Department of the Interior—for an electric transmission line across the\n\nland now in dispute. The transmission line runs about sixty miles and crosses fifty-seven\n\nland parcels that were once allotted to individual Indians, including the two parcels in\n\nwhich the Navajo Nation now holds an undivided interest.\n\n\n\n                                            10\n\f       The right-of-way had a fifty-year expiration date—so it was set to expire in 2010.\n\nIn November 2009, PNM applied to the Secretary of the Interior for a twenty-year\n\nrenewal of the right-of-way. That application process was created by the 1948 Indian\n\nRight-of-Way Act, Act of Feb. 5, 1948, ch. 45, 62 Stat. 17-18 (codified at 25 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 323-328), which mandates that “[n]o grant of a right-of-way over and across any lands\n\nbelonging to a tribe . . . shall be made without the consent of the proper tribal officials.”\n\n25 U.S.C. § 324. The regulations stemming from the 1948 Act affirm the necessity for\n\ntribal consent. See, e.g., 25 C.F.R. § 169.107(a) (2016) (“For a right-of-way across tribal\n\nland, the applicant must obtain tribal consent, in the form of a tribal authorization and a\n\nwritten agreement with the tribe . . . .”). For land parcels held in trust for individual\n\nIndians, the Secretary of the Interior can grant rights-of-way so long as the holders of a\n\nmajority of interests consent. 25 U.S.C. § 324.\n\n       The renewal process began smoothly for PNM. The Navajo Nation gave written\n\nconsent for the right-of-way through lands in which the United States holds the entire\n\ninterest in trust. In addition, PNM obtained consent from a majority of beneficial-interest\n\nowners for the parcels that had been allotted and in which the United States holds interest\n\nin trust. So in November 2009, the BIA began to process PNM’s renewal application. But\n\nenough individual Indian owners in five land parcels revoked their consent to tip the total\n\nconsenting to less than 50% of the fractional interests. In January 2015, the BIA notified\n\nPNM that it could not approve the renewal application without that consent.\n\n       On June 13, 2015, PNM filed a complaint in federal district court in New Mexico\n\nseeking to condemn the fifty-foot-wide right-of-way through the five parcels for which\n\n                                              11\n\fthe company no longer had consent. The complaint alleges federal-question jurisdiction\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331, pleading a claim under § 3 of the 1901 Act, codified at\n\n25 U.S.C. § 357. PNM alleged that § 357 authorizes the condemnation of any land ever\n\nallotted to Indians, whoever might later own the land. Unlike the twenty-year renewal\n\nperiod that PNM sought in the application process, PNM’s complaint sought a perpetual\n\nright-of-way. The complaint named as defendants all parties holding interest in the five\n\nparcels, including the Navajo Nation and the United States.\n\n       In December 2015, the district court dismissed without prejudice—for lack of\n\nsubject-matter jurisdiction—PNM’s condemnation claims for the two parcels in which\n\nthe Navajo Nation holds an interest. The court stayed the claims for the other three\n\nparcels pending the resolution of this appeal. The court held that § 357 does not authorize\n\ncondemnation of land in which a tribe has acquired an interest. The court concluded that\n\n“[t]he Nation cannot be considered as an owner of ‘lands allotted in severalty to\n\nIndians.’” Appellant App. vol. 1 at 137 (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 357). Tribal interest in the\n\nland ends allotted-land status.1 The court reminded PNM that it could still pursue a\n\nvoluntary easement.\n\n       Rather than take that course, PNM moved the court to reconsider and set aside the\n\ndismissal. Alternatively, PNM asked the district court to certify four interlocutory-appeal\n\n       1\n         The district court also concluded that the Navajo Nation was a required party\nto the condemnation action under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(a) because of the Nation’s\ninterest in the land to be condemned, but one that could not be joined because of\nsovereign immunity. And the court found that under Fed. R. Civ. P. 19(b), “in equity\nand good conscience” the condemnation action could not proceed without the Nation.\nAppellant App. vol. 1 at 155.\n\n                                            12\n\fquestions. In March 2016, the district court issued an order that affirmed its earlier\n\ndecision and elaborated on its reasoning: “PNM’s ‘once an allotment always an\n\nallotment’ rule is not supported by any case law authority or the plain language of § 357\n\nand its historical context.” Appellant App. vol. 2 at 304. In response to PNM’s policy\n\narguments about the negative consequences of not allowing condemnation, the court\n\nreminded PNM that, even if negotiation should fail—which the Navajo Nation and the\n\nUnited States argued PNM had not shown was inevitable—it was “up to Congress, not\n\nthis Court, to open up the condemnation avenue over trust lands fractionally owned by\n\ntribes.” Id. at 320.\n\n       The district court granted PNM’s request to certify four questions of law for\n\ninterlocutory appeal:\n\n       I.      Does 25 U.S.C. § 357 authorize a condemnation action against a\n               parcel of allotted land in which the United States holds fee title in\n               trust for an Indian tribe, which has a fractional beneficial interest in\n               the parcel?\n\n       II.     Is an Indian tribe that holds a fractional beneficial interest in a parcel\n               of allotted land a required party to a condemnation action brought\n               under 25 U.S.C. § 357?\n\n       III.    Does an Indian tribe that holds a fractional beneficial interest in a\n               parcel of allotted land have sovereign immunity against a\n               condemnation action brought under 25 U.S.C. § 357?\n\n       IV.     If an Indian tribe that holds a fractional beneficial interest in a parcel\n               of allotted land has sovereign immunity against, and cannot be\n               joined in, a condemnation action brought under 25 U.S.C. § 357, can\n               a condemnation action proceed in the absence of the Indian tribe?\n\nId. at 324.\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       The district court also denied PNM’s request to sever the company’s claims\n\nagainst the two parcels with Navajo Nation interests, concluding that it was better to stay\n\nthe claims for the other three allotments pending the resolution of the interlocutory\n\nappeal. PNM has appealed the four certified questions.\n\n                                              III\n\n       Because we affirm the district court’s decision, we need reach only the first\n\nquestion certified for appeal: does § 357 authorize condemnation against land in which\n\nthe United States holds fee title in trust for an Indian tribe, when the tribe has a fractional\n\nbeneficial interest in the parcel?2 We review de novo the district court’s statutory\n\ninterpretation of § 357.

No one disputes that PNM may seek condemnation of any land parcel previously\n\nallotted and whose current beneficial owners are individual Indians. The language of\n\n§ 357 plainly authorizes such actions.\n\n       But starkly absent from § 357’s language is any similar authorization for tribal\n\nlands. Tribal lands go unmentioned. As we have already noted, that absence in § 357\n\nsharply contrasts with the paragraph immediately preceding § 357, which is part of the\n\nsame section of the Act, but is codified at 25 U.S.C. § 319. Section 319 authorized the\n\nSecretary of the Interior to grant certain rights-of-way over reservations and other lands\n\nheld by tribes, as well as allotted lands. See 25 U.S.C. § 319. And none of PNM’s cited\n\ncases support its broad contention, let alone in this context, that “[f]or more than a\n\ncentury, the plain meaning of Section 357 has been that if a particular parcel is allotted\n\nland, that parcel may be condemned regardless of which persons or entities own\n\nfractional interests in such parcel.” Appellant Opening Br. at 10; see United States v.\n\nClarke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110222\"><a href=\"/opinion/110222/united-states-v-clarke/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254 (1980) (finding that § 357 authorizes condemnation via a\n\nformal procedure by the condemning authority, not by physical occupation and inverse\n\n                                             15\n\fcondemnation for compensation); S.

The statutory silence for condemnation of tribal lands, then, poses a\n\nserious obstacle for PNM.\n\n       PNM tries to circumvent that obstacle by asking us to make several implicit\n\nconclusions. First, it asks us to view what happened during the Allotment Era as a\n\npermanent brand on Native land: that upon Congress’s taking tribal lands and chopping\n\nthem into allotments, Congress forever rendered all those lands as “lands allotted” within\n\n§ 357’s meaning. Later changes in ownership cannot matter, PNM argues, and neither\n\ncan the amount of the interest that a tribe acquires: in PNM’s view, even lands that a tribe\n\nfully reobtains are “[l]ands allotted in severalty to Indians.” 25 U.S.C. § 357. This is\n\nPNM’s proposed rule that “once an allotment always an allotment”—rejected by the\n\ndistrict court for lack of legal and historical backing. Appellant App. vol. 2 at 304. In\n\nsupport of this novel rule, PNM relies on the historical context underlying the 1901 Act.\n\nBy PNM’s reckoning, the Congresses of the Allotment Era wanted and expected tribes\n\nand reservations to soon be relics of the past—so they could hardly have expected that\n\n“any fractional beneficial interests would ever be transferred to the very tribe from whose\n\nreservation the lands had been removed by allotment.” Appellant Opening Br. at 11.\n\n       Though we acknowledge the historical record, it provides us no license to\n\ndisregard or slant § 357’s plain language. Congress has neither enacted nor amended\n\n§ 357 to establish that ever-allotted status would permanently trump any later tribal\n\n                                             16\n\facquisitions.3 In a different setting, the Supreme Court has refused “to extrapolate from\n\nthis expectation [of the demise of reservations]” an intent to diminish a reservation.\n\nSolem, 465 U.S. at 468. Likewise, here we refuse to extrapolate from that expectation to\n\namend the plain language of § 357. Even if § 357 were ambiguous, we still would apply\n\nthe Indian-law canon to rule in favor of tribal sovereignty and against a permanent anti-\n\ntribal-land classification. Section 357 does not reach tribal lands, even if land reobtains\n\nthat status long after it was allotted.\n\n                                             IV\n\n       We must next clarify what qualifies as tribal land for the purposes of § 357. We\n\nhave ruled that § 357 reaches allotted land even after that land has passed to individual\n\nheirs of the allottees. Transok Pipeline Co. v. Darks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"350734\"><a href=\"/opinion/350734/transok-pipeline-company-an-oklahoma-corporation-v-maxwell-darks-marvin/\"><span class=\"volume\">565</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1153 (10th Cir.\n\n1977). As explained above, we reject PNM’s contention that any land ever allotted\n\nforever becomes “[l]ands allotted” within § 357’s meaning, even when the tribe later\n\nfully reacquires and owns that land. But we still must decide what happens when tribes\n\nacquire a fractional interest. For the two mixed-ownership parcels at issue here, the\n\nNavajo Nation holds such fractional-ownership interests—a 13.6% interest in Allotment\n\n1160, and a 0.14% interest in Allotment 1392.\n\n\n\n       3\n         In our view, PNM’s reading of § 357 requires inserting language that is not\nthere, as shown by the missing language included in the brackets: “[All Tribal] Lands\n[ever] allotted in severalty to Indians [, regardless of whether they return to tribal\nownership,] may be condemned for any public purpose under the laws of the State or\nTerritory where located in the same manner as land owned in fee may be condemned,\nand the money awarded as damages shall be paid to the allottee.”\n\n                                             17\n\f       In Nebraska Public Power District v. 100.95 Acres of Land in Thurston County,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"426223\"><a href=\"/opinion/426223/nebraska-public-power-district-a-public-corporation-and-political/\"><span class=\"volume\">719</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 961-62 (8th Cir. 1983), the Eighth Circuit confronted a similar question.\n\nThere, the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska held undivided future interests in land that a\n\npublic utility company sought to condemn. Id. at 957-58. The court held that those future\n\ninterests sufficed to make the relevant parcels tribal land, beyond § 357’s condemnation\n\nreach. Id. at 961-62. For support, the court considered a regulation promulgated under the\n\n1948 Right-of-Way Act (codified at 25 U.S.C. §§ 323-328).4 Id. at 962. That regulation,\n\nand its amended version, treats any tribal interest as sufficient to establish tribal-land\n\nstatus. See id. (“‘Tribal land’ means land or any interest therein, title to which is held by\n\nthe United States in trust for a tribe . . . .” (quoting 25 C.F.R. § 169.1(d) (1983)));\n\n25 C.F.R. § 169.2 (2016) (“Tribal land means any tract in which the surface estate, or an\n\nundivided interest in the surface estate, is owned by one or more tribes in trust or\n\nrestricted status.”). The BIA has also clarified that “a tract is considered ‘tribal land’ if\n\nany interest, fractional or whole, is owned by the tribe. A tract in which both a tribe and\n\nindividual Indians own fractional interest is considered tribal land for the purposes of\n\nregulations applicable to tribal land.” Rights-of-Way on Indian Land, 80 Fed.

In doing so, the BIA\n\n\n       4\n         A district court in our circuit, also looking to the regulations for clues,\nsimilarly found that because a tribe “owns an undivided 1.1% interest in the tract that\nis held in trust, the Court finds that the tract is tribal land and cannot be condemned\npursuant to 25 U.S.C. § 357.

Id. The BIA also noted that the\n\ndifferent treatment afforded to individual and tribal interests befits the unique\n\ngovernment-to-government relationship between the United States and Native tribes, and\n\nfederal attempts to promote tribal self-governance. Id. at 72,492. Thus, even if tribal\n\ninterest does not constitute a majority interest, tribal consent is still required for a right-\n\nof-way. Id. at 72,509.\n\n       These regulations have a limited impact on our interpretation of § 357 because\n\nthey do not apply to condemnation actions. Id. at 72,495, 72,517. PNM views the\n\ninapplicability of the regulations as a critical point, arguing that the district court and the\n\nEighth Circuit erred by considering them. PNM ignores that the district court went to\n\ngreat lengths to explain that the regulations were referenced “only to amplify” the court’s\n\nconclusion about tribal lands based on § 357’s plain meaning. Appellant App. vol. 2\n\nat 311. We view the regulations similarly. Faced with a definition based on the federal\n\ngovernment’s long-stated policy goal of respecting tribal sovereignty, PNM gives us no\n\nalternative definition other than its extreme position that § 357 reaches even land held\n\nentirely by a tribe. In essence, we face two choices: (1) concluding that all land ever\n\nallotted is subject to condemnation under § 357, even if a tribe reobtains a majority or\n\ntotal interest in it, or (2) concluding that even previously allotted land that a tribe\n\nreobtains any interest in becomes tribal land beyond condemnation under § 357.\n\nGoverned by § 357’s plain language, we must choose the latter approach. We side with\n\nthe Eighth Circuit and agree with the district court’s conclusion: “When all or part of a\n\n                                               19\n\fparcel of allotted land owned by one or more individuals is transferred to the United\n\nStates in trust for a tribe; that land becomes ‘tribal land’ not subject to condemnation\n\nunder § 357.” Id. at 304.5\n\n                                             V\n\n         PNM argues that Congress would not have encouraged tribes to increase their\n\ntribal lands under land buy-back and consolidation programs if it had believed that it\n\ncorrespondingly was shrinking § 357 condemnation authority for those reacquired lands.\n\nAnd if that is so, PNM argues that this shows Congress never intended tribal lands to be\n\nexempt from condemnation under § 357. We reject these arguments. First, Congress has\n\nknown about the Eighth Circuit’s case for 34 years and has not amended § 357 to allow\n\ncondemnation of tribal lands. Second, the Acts creating tribal buy-back and consolidation\n\nprograms say nothing about allowing condemnation on tribes’ reacquired land. So we\n\nmust conclude that § 357, as in 1901, does not give condemnation authority over tribal\n\nlands.\n\n         PNM complains that our interpretation of § 357 will create “stranded”\n\ninfrastructure on tribal land for which it will now have no choice but to negotiate\n\nrights-of-way with the tribes or face trespass actions.

PNM\n\ngoes so far as to raise, without elaboration, the specter of a due-process deprivation.\n\n         5\n         Because we hold that the tribal interests make Allotments 1160 and 1392\ntribal land for the purposes of § 357, PNM cannot proceed with a condemnation\naction against the individual interests in the parcels while leaving the tribal interests\nundisturbed. Holding otherwise would accomplish little other than to waste judicial\nresources, and those of PNM, as PNM would still need tribal consent before it could\nobtain a right-of-way under 25 U.S.C. § 324.\n\n                                             20\n\f       But PNM has no legal backing for its interpretation. No court has held that § 357\n\nallows condemnation of tribal land, whether the tribal interest is fractional, future, or\n\nwhole. The only major decision on point is Nebraska Public Power District, decided by\n\nthe Eighth Circuit in 1983, holding that any tribal interest, including undivided future\n\ninterests, acquired by the tribe after allotment defeats any condemnation authority\n\nprovided in § 357. 719 F.2d at 961-62. In managing the transmission line in this case and\n\nits other infrastructure, PNM had every reason to know about the Eighth Circuit case, as\n\nwell as the reigning canon of construction favoring tribal sovereignty. PNM invested in\n\nthe face of adverse precedent and with no supportive case law at its back. Whatever\n\nnegative policy effects it claims may follow, PNM’s remedy lies elsewhere.\n\n                                             VI\n\n       Because the Navajo Nation did not acquire its undivided fractional interests by\n\nallotment, PNM argues that the Nation is a mere successor-in-interest under § 357. See\n\nTransok, 565 F.2d at 1153. All agree that the Navajo Nation acquired its interests in the\n\ndisputed parcels by the congressionally approved mechanisms of conveyance and\n\nintestate descent. The issue is not how the tribe acquired the land, but instead what is the\n\nland’s present status now that the tribe has acquired it. As discussed, we hold that the\n\nland is now tribal land and thus beyond the reach of condemnation.\n\n       PNM also attempts to make a distinction where none exists. PNM argues that it\n\ndoes not seek to divest the tribe of its fractional interest, but instead merely to condemn a\n\nright-of-way on its land. We acknowledge as much, but § 357 contains no authorization\n\nfor any tribal-land condemnation, whether by divestiture or otherwise. Because we have\n\n                                             21\n\fdetermined that Allotments 1160 and 1392 are tribal land, PNM cannot force\n\ncondemnation.\n\n       In addition, PNM argues that § 357 supports PNM’s condemnation authority by\n\nthe manner in which it provides for condemnation payments. Section 357 provides that\n\nmoney awarded as damages from a condemnation action “shall be paid to the allottee.”\n\nPNM seizes upon this language and, combined with the United States’ off-handed\n\nobservation that the payment language also applies to an allottee’s heirs, uses it to argue\n\nthat, if § 357 reaches heirs despite a lack of explicit textual reference, must not § 357\n\nreach tribes also? In this argument, PNM once again suggests that tribes (like heirs) are\n\nmere successors-in-interest. But unlike ordinary heirs inheriting interests in land, tribes\n\nare “sovereign political entities possessed of sovereign authority.” Nanomantube v.\n\nKickapoo Tribe in Kan., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"183962\"><a href=\"/opinion/183962/nanomantube-v-kickapoo-tribe-in-kansas/\"><span class=\"volume\">631</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1151-52 (10th Cir. 2011). That Congress allows\n\ntribes to inherit and purchase interests in previously allotted land does not mean that\n\nCongress subjects the reacquired tribal lands to condemnation under § 357. Absent\n\nexplicit authorization, tribal sovereignty prevails.\n\n       PNM also argues that the significance of a tribal interest on an ever-allotted land\n\nparcel depends on the statutory meaning of the word “lands” itself. Because\n\ncondemnation is an “in rem” action, PNM argues, § 357 does not, and we should not,\n\nconsider who owns interest in the “lands” as a relevant factor in determining § 357’s\n\nreach. Appellant Opening Br. at 25-28; Appellant Reply Br. at 9. But as the district court\n\nnoted, a § 357 proceeding is not a pure in rem proceeding. Thus, under § 357, we look\n\nnot only to what lands are at issue, but to their ownership. Here, because the tribe owns\n\n                                              22\n\fan interest in the disputed parcels, § 357’s “[l]ands allotted in severalty to Indians”\n\nprerequisite is inapplicable and so the law gives PNM no authority to condemn. And that\n\ndeprives us of federal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331.\n\n       Finally, PNM argues that interpreting § 357 as we do will leave it vulnerable to\n\ntrespass actions and paying higher compensation to obtain consent. Worse, it argues,\n\nbecause of congressional efforts to help tribes buy back interest in lands lost during the\n\nAllotment Era, the availability of condemnation under § 357 will continue to shrink as\n\ntribes avail themselves of well-funded programs enabling them to buy back formerly\n\ntribal land. This, PNM argues, amounts to an implied partial repeal of § 357, a position\n\nbuilt upon its view that § 357 allows condemnation of tribal lands. Because we reject that\n\nview, the argument has no force.\n\n       Nor do we believe that PNM’s unfavorable policy outcome necessarily comes\n\nfrom Congress overlooking it. In the 116 years after the 1901 Act, Congress has not\n\namended § 357 to favor PNM’s interpretation. Nor has it responded to Nebraska Public\n\nPower District in the thirty-four years since the Eighth Circuit decided that case\n\ndisfavoring similar arguments to PNM’s. Instead, Congress has acted to protect and\n\nstrengthen tribal sovereignty. See, e.g., Rights-of-Way on Indian Land, 80 Fed. Reg.\n\nat 72,509 (observing that requiring tribal consent for a right-of-way “restores a measure\n\nof tribal sovereignty over Indian lands and is consistent with principles of tribal self-\n\ngovernance that animate modern Federal Indian policy”); U.S. Dep’t of Interior, Updated\n\nImplementation Plan, Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations 10, 23, 31 (2013)\n\n(noting that a “foundational goal” of the buy-back program is “to strengthen tribal\n\n                                             23\n\fsovereignty” and prioritizing acquisitions to accomplish that goal); see also Michigan v.\n\nBay Mills Indian Cmty., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2675751\"><a href=\"/opinion/2675751/michigan-v-bay-mills-indian-community/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Such claims may be valuable during negotiations for voluntary\n\nrights-of-way. If the tribe does not accept such claims as true, that is the tribe’s\n\nprerogative.\n\n                                             VII\n\n       We also deny the motion to intervene of Transwestern Pipeline Company, LLC\n\n(Transwestern). Transwestern first entered this case as a party after PNM named it as\n\na defendant possibly having an interest in the property involved in the condemnation\n\naction. Transwestern has a right-of-way crossing parts of Allotment 1392, but not the\n\npart that PNM sought to condemn. So Transwestern disclaimed any interest in the\n\neasements that PNM sought and also waived any future notice of the proceedings.\n\nWhen the Navajo Nation filed a motion to dismiss, Transwestern chose not to file an\n\nopposing brief. At the district court, the Navajo Nation and the United States argued\n\nthat the land in dispute was tribal land beyond § 357’s condemnation authority. When\n\nthe district court dismissed PNM’s condemnation action for Allotments 1160 and\n\n                                              24\n\f1392, Transwestern concurred with PNM’s motion to alter or amend the Dismissal\n\nOrder and its request for certification of issues for interlocutory appeal. In addition,\n\nTranswestern filed an “Answer and/or Cross-Petition” in support of PNM’s Petition\n\nfor Permission to Appeal. Transwestern Intervention Reply Br. at 5. When\n\nTranswestern filed a motion to participate as a party on appeal, we denied it, allowing\n\nTranswestern instead to move to intervene or appear as amicus.\n\n      We evaluate motions to intervene on appeal based on the four requirements of\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 24(a): (1) an applicant’s timely application, (2) an “interest relating to\n\nthe property or transaction which is the subject of the action,” (3) possible\n\nimpairment or impediment of that interest, and (4) lack of adequate representation of\n\nthat interest by existing parties.

Though we usually take a liberal view of\n\nRule 24(a), when an applicant has not sought intervention in the district court, we\n\npermit it on appeal “only in an exceptional case for imperative reasons.” Id. at 1103\n\n(quoting Hutchinson v.

Under these\n\nstandards, we conclude that we must deny Transwestern’s motion to intervene.\n\n      First, PNM is adequately representing Transwestern’s interest in the case.\n\nWhen the applicant and an existing party share an identical legal objective, we\n\npresume that the party’s representation is adequate.

Here, PNM and Transwestern have the same legal objective—\n\nprevailing on their interpretation that § 357 allows condemnation of land ever allotted\n\nto Indians in severalty, even when a tribe later reacquires an interest.\n\n      Second, Transwestern had ample opportunity to be heard at the district court\n\nand declined to do so. At the most consequential phase of the district court\n\nproceedings—the Navajo Nation’s ultimately successful motion to dismiss—\n\nTranswestern declined to participate in briefing. Both the Navajo Nation and the\n\nUnited States raised the now-disputed issue of the scope of § 357 in the district court.\n\nTranswestern has already had the opportunity it now seeks and let it slip by.6\n\n      Transwestern argues that an adverse decision for PNM in this case would\n\nsignificantly affect its own extensive network of energy infrastructure. That seems\n\nlikely. But that was equally true in the district court, where Transwestern declined to\n\nmake its arguments. We see little that has changed in the meantime, except perhaps a\n\nheightened fear of an unfavorable decision.\n\n      Nor is Transwestern being excluded from the case. All parties consent to\n\nTranswestern’s status as amicus curiae, and we have considered the company’s\n\n\n      6\n         We decline to decide whether the United States is correct in its allegation that\nTranswestern engaged in “sandbagging tactics” by willfully holding back arguments\nin the district court in hopes of more favorable treatment on appeal. United States\nIntervention Br. at 2. But opening the door to such tactics is another reason weighing\nagainst allowing Transwestern’s intervention. See Richison v. Ernest Group, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"212264\"><a href=\"/opinion/212264/richison-v-ernest-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1123</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1127 (10th Cir. 2011).\n\n\n                                           26\n\fbriefed arguments. But Transwestern’s legal objective duplicates PNM’s, and its\n\narguments come too late for us to grant intervention.7\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the reasons stated, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of the\n\ncondemnation action for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction as to the two land parcels\n\nin which the Navajo Nation holds an interest.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n         Granting Transwestern’s motion to intervene would not change the outcome\nof the case. The company offers only one relevant argument that was not\nsubstantially raised by the appellant: that the Supreme Court in County of Yakima\nallowed the local county to tax lands that had been earlier allotted from a tribal\nreservation, that had passed out of trust status into fee-simple status, and that later\nhad been repurchased by the tribe. 502 U.S. at 270. Transwestern argues that this\nshows that the Supreme Court recognizes the permanence of a land’s allotment status\neven after the tribe re-obtains the land. Thus, in our case, Transwestern argues, we\nshould recognize the permanence of the disputed land’s allotment status even after a\ntribal purchase and inheritance.\n        But County of Yakima differs from our case in at least one key aspect—here,\nthe land never became fee-simple land. Instead, it has always retained its status as\nheld in trust by the United States. What County of Yakima turned on was not\nallotment status, but fee-simple status. The Court held that once land had become\nfee-simple land, the tribe could not unilaterally return it to protected status and\nexempt itself from ad valorem taxes via its purchase. Id. The Court did not give any\nindependent meaning to allotment status—it simply reviewed that history to show\nwhy the relevant Act of Congress resulted in the land being held in fee-simple status.\nId. at 254-56, 258-60. Moreover, a case on local tax authority does not automatically\ncompel us to adopt the same principles for condemnations.\n        PNM raised a similar argument in the district court based on Oneida Tribe of\nIndians of Wisconsin v. Village of Hobart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2284025\"><a href=\"/opinion/2284025/oneida-tribe-of-wi-v-village-of-hobart-wi/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Wis. 2008), and\nthe district court rejected it for the same fee-title status versus trust status divide that\nwe have just discussed.
