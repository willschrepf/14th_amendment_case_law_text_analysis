In the spring of 2011, following reports of abuse\n\nat the adolescent psychiatric unit (unit) of Steward Carney\n\nHospital, Inc., then president of the hospital, William Walczak,\n\nfired all of the registered nurses and mental health counsellors\n\nwho worked in the unit.    Walczak subsequently issued statements,\n\nboth to the hospital's employees and to the Boston Globe\n\nNewspaper Co. (Boston Globe), arguably to the effect that the\n\nnurses had been fired based in part on their culpability for the\n\nincidents that took place at the unit.    The plaintiffs, nine of\n\nthe nurses who had been fired, then filed suit against the\n\ndefendants for, among other things, defamation.\n\n    The hospital defendants4 responded by filing a special\n\nmotion to dismiss the defamation claim pursuant to G. L. c. 231,\n\n§ 59H, the \"anti-SLAPP\" statute.    A Superior Court judge denied\n\nthe motion, concluding that the hospital defendants had failed\n\n    4\n       For convenience and, in particular, to distinguish them\nfrom other defendants who were named in the complaint but are\nnot part of this appeal, we refer to Steward Carney Hospital,\nInc. Steward Hospital Holdings, LLC, Steward Health Care System,\nLLC, and William Walczak as \"the hospital defendants\" or \"the\ndefendants.\"\n\n     We refer to the plaintiffs as \"the plaintiff nurses,\" \"the\nnurses,\" or \"the plaintiffs\" interchangeably as well.\n\f                                                                    3\n\n\nto meet their threshold burden of showing that the claim was\n\nbased solely on their petitioning activity.     The hospital\n\ndefendants filed an interlocutory appeal in the Appeals Court as\n\nof right.   See Fabre v. Walton, 436 Mass. 517, 521–522 (2002).\n\nThe Appeals Court then reversed the motion judge's decision in\n\npart.   See Blanchard v. Steward Carney Hosp., Inc., 89 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 97, 98 (2016).   We granted the parties' applications\n\nfor further appellate review.   We conclude that a portion of the\n\nplaintiff nurses' defamation claim is based solely on the\n\nhospital defendants' petitioning activity.    The hospital\n\ndefendants as special movants thus having satisfied in part\n\ntheir threshold burden under Duracraft v. Holmes Prods. Corp.,\n\n427 Mass. 156, 167-168 (1998) (Duracraft), the matter must be\n\nremanded to the Superior Court where the burden will shift to\n\nthe plaintiff nurses to make a showing adequate to defeat the\n\nmotion.\n\n     Under current case law, the plaintiff nurses, as nonmoving\n\nparties, could defeat the special motion only by showing that\n\nthe hospital defendants' petitioning activity upon which a\n\nportion of the plaintiff's defamation claim is based was a sham,\n\ni.e., without a reasonable basis in fact or law, a showing that\n\nthe record suggests may be difficult to make.    Insofar as the\n\nrecord also suggests the possibility that the plaintiff nurses'\n\nclaim may not have been brought primarily to chill the hospital\n\f                                                                   4\n\n\ndefendants' legitimate exercise of their right to petition,\n\nhowever, the case underscores a long recognized difficulty in\n\nthe statute.   It is one rooted in the fact that both parties\n\nenjoy the right to petition, including the right to seek redress\n\nin the courts.   The anti-SLAPP statute is meant to subject only\n\nmeritless SLAPP suits to expedited dismissal, yet it nonetheless\n\nmay be used to dismiss meritorious claims not intended primarily\n\nto chill petitioning.\n\n    Because the statute as thus construed remains at odds with\n\nevident legislative intent, and continues to raise\n\nconstitutional concerns, we take this opportunity to augment the\n\nframework set forth in the Duracraft case (Duracraft framework)\n\nby broadening the construction of the statutory term \"based on.\"\n\nWhile a nonmoving party may still defeat a special motion to\n\ndismiss by demonstrating that the special movant's petitioning\n\nactivity is a sham, we hold that a nonmoving party's claim also\n\nis not subject to dismissal as one solely based on a special\n\nmovant's petitioning activity if the nonmoving party can\n\nestablish that its claim was not \"brought primarily to chill\"\n\nthe special movant's legitimate exercise of its right to\n\npetition.   See Duracraft, 427 Mass. at 161 (1998), quoting 1994\n\nHouse Doc. No. 1520.    On remand, the plaintiff nurses may\n\nattempt to make such a showing in satisfaction of their burden.\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\n     1.   Background.   The unit at Steward Carney Hospital, Inc.,\n\nin Boston (hospital), is licensed by the Department of Mental\n\nHealth (DMH) and the Department of Public Health (DPH).5    In\n\nApril, 2011, there were four incidents involving alleged patient\n\nabuse or neglect at the unit.   The hospital immediately reported\n\nthese incidents to DMH, DPH, and the Department of Children and\n\nFamilies.   DMH commenced an investigation into the incidents,\n\nand required that there be no new admissions to the unit.     DMH\n\nalso considered revoking the hospital's license to operate the\n\nunit pending the hospital's response to the reports of abuse.\n\n     The hospital soon placed all but a small number of unit\n\nemployees, including managers, nurses, and mental health\n\ncounsellors, on paid administrative leave.   It also hired Scott\n\nHarshbarger, then senior counsel at the law firm Proskauer\n\nRose LLP, to conduct an investigation into the incidents, to\n\nrecommend remedial actions, and to represent the hospital's\n\ninterests in its dealings with the State agencies.   Upon\n\nconcluding his investigation, Harshbarger recommended to Walczak\n\nthat, in light of what he termed a \"code of silence\" amongst the\n\nunit's staff, \"it would be prudent to replace the current\n\n\n\n     5\n       The unit typically treats mentally and physically\nchallenged teenagers in \"acute states,\" who are admitted from\nother facilities as a \"last resort.\" Many of them are under the\ncustody of the Department of Children and Families and have\nlittle involvement with their families.\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\npersonnel in order to ensure quality care for these vulnerable\n\npatients.\"\n\n     After reviewing Harshbarger's recommendation, Walczak\n\ninformed each of the plaintiff nurses that he was terminating\n\nher employment.   The following day, he sent an electronic mail\n\n(e-mail) message to all hospital employees, which began by\n\nnoting that the hospital \"has a rich tradition of providing\n\nexcellent care to [its] patients.\"   After providing the\n\nhospital's employees with credit for this successful commitment\n\nto patient care, the message continued, in relevant part:\n\n          \"Recently, I have become aware of the alleged\n     incidents where a number of [hospital] staff have not\n     demonstrated this steadfast commitment to patient care. I\n     have thoroughly investigated these allegations and have\n     determined that these individual employees have not been\n     acting in the best interest of their patients, the\n     hospital, or the community we serve. As a result, I have\n     terminated the employment of each of these individuals.\"\n     In a Boston Globe article about the incidents two days\n\nafter the plaintiff nurses were fired, Walczak was quoted as\n\nsaying that, when he read Harshbarger's report, he \"decided to\n\nreplace the nurses and other staff on the unit.\"6   Walczak said\n\nthat the report recommended that he \"start over on the unit\" and\n\nthat his \"goal [was] to make it the best unit in the state.\"\n\nThe article noted that Walczak \"would not provide details of the\n\n     6\n       The article stated that Harshbarger had been investigating\nan employee's alleged sexual assault of a patient and\n\"conditions on the 14-bed locked unit for extremely troubled\nteens.\"\n\f                                                                  7\n\n\nalleged assault or patient safety concerns, or comment on why\n\nthe entire staff was dismissed, given that the allegation\n\ninvolved one employee and one patient.\"     Approximately one month\n\nlater, the Boston Globe published another article on the\n\nincidents at the hospital, quoting Walczak as stating that\n\n\"[t]he Harshbarger report indicated it wasn't a safe situation\"\n\nand stating that the report \"underscored his decision to fire\n\nthe entire staff of the unit.\"\n\n     In June, 2011, DMH issued its reports on each of the four\n\nincidents.     The reports concerning the first three incidents\n\nconcluded that there had been wrongdoing by a single mental\n\nhealth counsellor, while the fourth report concluded that\n\nunspecified staff on duty during the incident had acted\n\nimproperly.7\n\n     2.   Prior proceedings.    In May, 2013, in a five-count\n\ncomplaint brought against the hospital defendants, along with\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       In May, 2011, the union that represented the plaintiff\nnurses, the Massachusetts Nurses Association, filed grievances\non behalf of each of the unit's nurses, including each of the\nplaintiff nurses. Pursuant to the collective bargaining\nagreement between the hospital and this nurses association, the\ngrievances were subject to arbitration. The first arbitration\ninvolved five of the plaintiff nurses: Douglas, Hendrick, Herr,\nLang, and Woods. The arbitrator found in favor of the nurses\nand ordered, inter alia, their reinstatement. The hospital\nappealed from that ruling; the appeal is apparently still\npending.\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\nHarshbarger and Proskauer Rose LLP (Proskauer defendants),8 the\n\nplaintiff nurses claimed that the hospital defendants and the\n\nProskauer defendants had each defamed them.   The plaintiff\n\nnurses alleged, in one count of their complaint, that the\n\nhospital defendants defamed them both by the e-mail message sent\n\nto hospital employees announcing their terminations, as well as\n\nby communications made to and published by the Boston Globe.\n\nThe plaintiff nurses asserted that such statements falsely\n\nsuggested that \"after a thorough investigation, [Walczak] had\n\ndetermined . . . that each of the terminated plaintiffs had\n\ndemonstrated inadequate commitment to patient care and that each\n\nhad provided such deficient patient care that her employment had\n\nto be terminated.\"9\n\n     In their defamation claim against the Proskauer defendants,\n\nthe plaintiff nurses asserted that Harshbarger's preliminary and\n\n\n     8\n       The complaint also included a claim against the hospital\ndefendants for violation of the healthcare provider\nwhistleblower statute, G. L. c. 149, § 187, and plaintiffs Lang\nand Donahoe claimed that the hospital defendants retaliated\nagainst them for performing their obligations under the\nmandatory reporting statute, G. L. c. 119, § 51A. In addition,\nall of the plaintiff nurses asserted a claim of intentional or\nreckless infliction of emotional distress against Harshbarger\nand Proskauer Rose LLP.\n     9\n       The plaintiff nurses claimed that Walczak's \"statements\nimplied the existence of undisclosed facts, namely, that the\ndecision to terminate each of the plaintiff nurses was based on\nher actions in connection with undisclosed incidents involving\npatients in the unit, which were known to Walczak and had been\n'thoroughly investigated.'\"\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nfinal written reports had defamed them by falsely suggesting\n\nthat they had \"adhered to a 'code of silence,'\" had failed to\n\nreport \"a variety of problems, . . . including misconduct,\" of\n\nwhich they were aware, and had been derelict in their duties in\n\na number of other respects.\n\n     Both sets of defendants responded by filing special motions\n\nto dismiss the defamation counts under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nSee G. L. c. 231, § 59H.10    A Superior Court judge allowed the\n\nProskauer defendants' special motion to dismiss, but denied the\n\nhospital defendants' motion.    The hospital defendants appealed.11\n\nThe Appeals Court reversed in part, allowing the defendants'\n\nspecial motion to dismiss with respect to Walczak's comments to\n\nthe Boston Globe, affirming the denial with respect to the e-\n\nmail message, and denying the hospital's motion for attorney's\n\nfees and costs.   Blanchard, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 98, 111 & n.14.\n\nWe granted the parties' cross applications for further appellate\n\nreview.\n\n     3.   Discussion   a.   The anti-SLAPP statute.   The\n\nLegislature enacted the anti-SLAPP statute to counteract \"SLAPP\"\n\n\n     10\n       Both sets of defendants also filed motions to dismiss the\nother claims under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754\n(1974). At a hearing on the motions to dismiss, the defendants\nwaived their motions under rule 12 (b) (6).\n     11\n       Defendants Harshbarger and Proskauer Rose LLP filed a\nstipulation of dismissal prior to the proceedings in the Appeals\nCourt, and they have no role in this appeal.\n\f                                                                      10\n\n\nsuits, defined broadly as \"lawsuits brought primarily to chill\n\nthe valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of\n\nspeech and petition for the redress of grievances.\"         Duracraft,\n\n427 Mass. at 161, quoting 1994 House Doc. No. 1520.       See G. L.\n\nc. 231, § 59H.     See also Cardno ChemRisk, LLC, v. Foytlin, 476\n\nMass. 479, 488 n.14 (2017) (explaining catalyst for\n\nlegislation).     The main \"objective of SLAPP suits is not to win\n\nthem, but to use litigation to intimidate opponents' exercise of\n\nrights of petitioning and speech.\"      Duracraft, supra.     To\n\nforestall such suits, the anti-SLAPP statute provides a\n\n\"procedural remedy for early dismissal of the disfavored\"\n\nlawsuits.   Id.    This remedy is the special motion to dismiss,\n\nwhich can be brought prior to engaging in discovery, and is\n\nintended to dispose of \"civil claims, counterclaims, or cross\n\nclaims\" that are based solely on a party's exercise of its right\n\nto petition.      See G. L. c. 231, § 59H.   The statute also\n\nmandates the award of attorney's fees to successful special\n\nmovants.    Id.\n\n    To prevail on such a motion, a special movant, such as the\n\nhospital defendants here, \"must make a threshold showing through\n\npleadings and affidavits that the claims against it 'are \"based\n\non\" the petitioning activities alone and have no substantial\n\nbasis other than or in addition to the petitioning activities.'\"\n\nFustolo v. Hollander, 455 Mass. 861, 865 (2010), quoting\n\f                                                                  11\n\n\nDuracraft, supra at 167-168.   See Fabre, 436 Mass. at 524\n\n(special movant must demonstrate that \"the only conduct\n\ncomplained of is . . . petitioning activity\").12   The anti-SLAPP\n\nstatute defines a party's exercise of its right to petition\n\nbroadly to include:\n\n          \"[1] any written or oral statement made before or\n     submitted to a legislative, executive, or judicial body, or\n     any other governmental proceeding; [2] any written or oral\n     statement made in connection with an issue under\n     consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or\n     judicial body, or any other governmental proceeding; [3]\n     any statement reasonably likely to encourage consideration\n     or review of an issue by a legislative executive, or\n     judicial body or any other governmental proceeding; [4] any\n     statement reasonably likely to enlist public participation\n     in an effort to effect such consideration; or [5] any other\n     statement falling within constitutional protection of the\n     right to petition government.\"\n\nG. L. c. 231, § 59H.\n\n     If the hospital defendants are able to make a threshold\n\nshowing that the plaintiff nurses' claim is based solely on the\n\nhospital defendants' petitioning activities, the burden shifts\n\nto the plaintiff nurses to establish \"by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that the [hospital defendants] lacked any reasonable\n\n\n     12\n       The statute also requires a special movant to demonstrate\nthat it was exercising \"its own right of petition\" in both the\nstatutory and the constitutional sense. See Cardno ChemRisk,\nLLC v. Foytlin, 476 Mass. 479, 486-489 (2017); G. L. c. 231,\n§ 59H (\"In any case in which a party asserts that the civil\nclaims, counterclaims, or cross claims against said party are\nbased on said party's exercise of its right of petition under\nthe [C]onstitution of the United States or of the\n[C]ommonwealth, said party may bring a special motion to\ndismiss\").\n\f                                                                   12\n\n\nfactual support or any arguable basis in law for its petitioning\n\nactivity,\" Baker v. Parsons, 434 Mass. 543, 553-554 (2001), and\n\nthat the hospital defendants' sham petitioning activity caused\n\nthe plaintiff nurses \"actual injury.\"    G. L. c. 231, § 59H.   See\n\nFustolo, 455 Mass. at 865.\n\n     b.   Petitioning activity.   As part of its threshold burden,\n\nthe hospital defendants must show that the conduct complained of\n\nconstitutes the exercise of its right to petition.    See Baker,\n\n434 Mass. at 550.   The hospital defendants contend that the\n\nmotion judge erred in determining that Walczak's communications\n\nto the Boston Globe and to the hospital employees did not\n\nconstitute petitioning activity under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nThe hospital defendants argue that Walczak's statements to the\n\nBoston Globe, and his e-mail message to all hospital employees,\n\nwere the exercise of the hospital defendants' right to petition\n\nbecause such statements were made \"in connection with an issue\n\nunder consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or\n\njudicial body, or any other governmental proceeding.\"13   See\n\nG. L. c. 231, § 59H.   Given that DMH was considering whether to\n\nrevoke the hospital's license to operate the unit when the\n\nstatements were made, the hospital defendants contend that both\n\ncommunications were part of the hospital's efforts to maintain\n\n     13\n       The defendants do not contend that Walczak's\ncommunications fall under any of the other definitions of\npetitioning activity in the anti-SLAPP statute.\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\nits license to operate the unit by demonstrating that it was\n\ntaking remedial steps.\n\n    The initial question before us is thus whether Walczak's\n\ncommunications to the Boston Globe and to the hospital employees\n\nwere each made \"in connection with\" DMH's investigation of the\n\nincidents and its decision regarding the hospital's license to\n\noperate the unit, such that they constitute petitioning activity\n\nunder the anti-SLAPP statute.   In determining whether statements\n\nconstitute petitioning, \"we consider them in the over-all\n\ncontext in which they are made.\"   North Am. Expositions Co. Ltd.\n\nPartnership v. Corcoran, 452 Mass. 852, 862 (2009).   To fall\n\nunder the \"in connection with\" definition of petitioning under\n\nthe anti-SLAPP statute, a communication must be \"made to\n\ninfluence, inform, or at the very least, reach governmental\n\nbodies -- either directly or indirectly.\"   Id., quoting Global\n\nNAPs, Inc. v. Verizon New England, Inc., 63 Mass. App. Ct. 600,\n\n605 (2005).   The key requirement of this definition of\n\npetitioning is the establishment of a plausible nexus between\n\nthe statement and the governmental proceeding.\n\n    The archetypical demonstration of this nexus involves a\n\nparty's statement regarding an ongoing governmental proceeding\n\nmade directly to a governmental body.   See, e.g., Office One,\n\nInc. v.

See G. L.\nc. 231, § 59H (defining petitioning activity as \"any written or\noral statement made before or submitted to a legislative,\nexecutive, or judicial body, or any other governmental\nproceeding . . . .\").\n\f                                                                   15\n\n\n     We turn to the two types of communications at issue here.\n\n     i.   Statements to the Boston Globe.   Walczak's statements\n\nto the Boston Globe commented on DMH's inquiry into the\n\nincidents of abuse at the unit, and the hospital's attempts to\n\naddress the situation.   Walczak's comments had a plausible nexus\n\nto DMH's investigation based on their content and the high\n\nlikelihood that they would influence or at least reach DMH.\n\n     Based on their content, it can be reasonably inferred that\n\nWalczak's statements to the Boston Globe were intended to\n\ndemonstrate to DMH the hospital's public commitment to address\n\nthe underlying problems at the unit.   It is undisputed that DMH\n\nwas considering whether to revoke the hospital's license to\n\noperate the unit at the time that Walczak made his comments to\n\nthe Boston Globe.   DMH's decision whether to do so turned on the\n\nhospital's implementation of remedial steps to prevent future\n\nincidents.15   The content of Walczak's statements directly\n\naddresses DMH's concern.\n\n     In the first article, published on May 28, 2011, Walczak's\n\nstatements implied that he had decided to terminate the nurses'\n\nemployment as a remedial action, based on Harshbarger's\n\n\n     15\n       The then director of licensing at the Department of\nMental Health (DMH) testified at an arbitration hearing\nregarding the nurses' claim for reinstatement to the unit that\nthe decision whether to revoke the hospital's license to operate\nthe unit centered on the hospital's \"plan . . . to make [the\nsituation] right.\"\n\f                                                                  16\n\n\nrecommendation.   He is quoted as stating that the Harshbarger\n\nreport described \"serious concerns about patient safety and\n\nquality of care on the unit\" and that the report recommended he\n\n\"start over on the unit.\"   Walczak's statements in the second\n\narticle, dated June 22, 2011, noted that the Harshbarger report\n\nindicated \"it wasn't a safe situation [at the unit]\" and that\n\nthe reports of additional incidents \"required a much deeper look\n\nat what was going on in the unit.\"16   In both of these\n\nstatements, Walczak emphasized that he was following the advice\n\ncontained in the Harshbarger report in addressing the unit's\n\nproblems.\n\n     By making clear that the hospital was following\n\nHarshbarger's recommendations, the statements communicated to\n\nreaders, likely including some of the licensing decision makers\n\nat DMH, that progress was occurring at the hospital, and that\n\nits license to operate the unit should not be revoked.    These\n\nstatements were neither \"tangential\" nor \"unrelated to\n\ngovernmental involvement,\" Global NAPs, Inc., 63 Mass. App. Ct.\n\nat 607, but rather went to the heart of a government agency's\n\ndecision whether to terminate the hospital's license to operate\n\nthe unit.   The statements directly related to DMH's then-pending\n\ninvestigation and, in particular, to DMH's decision whether to\n\n     16\n       The article noted that, at the time, DMH had confirmed\nthe first three incidents at the unit and was still\ninvestigating the fourth asserted incident of abuse.\n\f                                                                      17\n\n\npull the plug on the hospital's license for the unit.     Walczak's\n\nstatements can fairly be said to have been \"closely and\n\nrationally related\" to DMH's investigation and \"in furtherance\n\nof the objective\" of the hospital's petitioning -- the\n\npreservation of the hospital's license to operate the unit.\n\nPlante, 63 Mass. App. Ct. at 159.\n\n    Walczak's statements, moreover, were issued in a manner\n\nthat was likely to influence or, at the very least, reach DMH.\n\nHe made his statements to the Boston Globe, a newspaper \"widely\n\ncirculated in Boston and throughout the Commonwealth.\"       Brauer\n\nv. Globe Newspaper Co., 351 Mass. 53, 54 (1966).    Decision\n\nmakers at DMH, and members of the public wishing to weigh in on\n\nthe licensing decision, could reasonably have been expected to\n\nread Walczak's statements.    The timing of Walczak's statements\n\nto the Boston Globe indicates, as well, a plausible nexus\n\nbetween the communications and DMH's licensure decision, the\n\nstatements having been made while DMH's investigation was still\n\nongoing.\n\n    The plaintiff nurses contend that Walczak made the\n\nstatements primarily to defend the unit's reputation to the\n\npublic.    This goal, however, hardly can be seen as unrelated to\n\nthe hospital's objective of convincing DMH to leave intact the\n\nhospital's license to operate the unit.    The greater the\n\npublic's confidence in and support for the hospital, the more\n\f                                                                    18\n\n\ncomplex any decision to revoke the hospital's license to operate\n\nthe unit would become.     Ulterior motives, in any event, do not\n\nbear on the petitioning nature of the statements to the Boston\n\nGlobe.   See North Am. Expositions Co. Ltd. Partnership, 452\n\nMass. at 863 (\"the fact that . . . speech involves a commercial\n\nmotive does not mean it is not petitioning\").     Accordingly, we\n\nconclude that Walczak's statements to the Boston Globe were\n\nprotected petitioning activity under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n\n    ii.      Internal e-mail message.   In contrast, Walczak's e-\n\nmail message to all hospital employees concerning the\n\ntermination of the plaintiff nurses' employment was not\n\npetitioning activity.     Neither the content of the e-mail\n\nmessage, nor any evidence offered by the hospital defendants,\n\nsuggests any audience for the message other than hospital\n\nemployees.    The explanation of troubling events at their\n\nworkplace that was presented to hospital employees in an e-mail\n\nmessage by the hospital's president has no plausible nexus to\n\nthe hospital's efforts to sway DMH's licensing decision.\n\n    In this regard, the defendants have not shown that the e-\n\nmail message to employees had reached, or was reasonably likely\n\nto reach, DMH.    A private statement to a select group of people\n\ndoes not, without more, establish a plausible nexus to a\n\ngovernmental proceeding.     It stands to reason that statements\n\ncannot be \"in furtherance of\" petitioning the government if they\n\f                                                                   19\n\n\nare not reasonably geared to reaching it.    Plante, 63 Mass. App.\n\nCt. at 159.   The defendants have not shown that the hospital or\n\nsomeone on its behalf had forwarded the e-mail message to DMH or\n\neven had informed DMH that it had been sent to hospital\n\nemployees.    Nor have the defendants shown that someone in the\n\nhospital's employ receiving the e-mail message reasonably would\n\nbe expected to or did communicate its message to DMH.     Walczak's\n\nconclusory affidavit stating that he intended the e-mail message\n\nto come to DMH's attention17 does not indicate any mechanism\n\nthrough which the statement could arrive at the agency.18    See\n\nBurley, 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 823-824 (defendants' message to\n\nemployees was not petitioning activity despite defendants'\n\ncontention that they intended message to be conveyed to police).\n\n\n\n\n     17\n       Walczak attested that he had sent the electronic mail (e-\nmail) message \"not only to communicate to the hospital employees\nwhat was happening, but to give assurances to the regulatory\nagencies\" in the process of determining whether to revoke the\nhospital's license to operate the unit \"that the deficiencies\nwhich ha[d] been reported on the [u]nit would not continue.\"\nYet the defendants fail to establish that DMH likely would have\nencountered the message, let alone that what employees were told\nwould influence DMH's decision concerning the hospital's license\nto operate the unit.\n     18\n       The defendants also note that, in his affidavit,\nHarshbarger stated that he communicated to the general counsel\nof DMH, \"the action [that the hospital's] leadership was taking\nin response to the [i]ncidents.\" Harshbarger's summation of the\nhospital's efforts, however, does not affect the analysis of\nwhether Walczak's e-mail message was intended to or did\ninfluence DMH.\n\f                                                                     20\n\n\nWalczak's intent alone does not suffice in the circumstances to\n\nestablish the requisite nexus.\n\n    Moreover, nothing in the content of the e-mail message\n\nitself, stating in essence that the terminated nurses deviated\n\nfrom the hospital's \"rich tradition of providing excellent care\n\nto [its] patients,\" suggests that it was intended to influence\n\nor reach DMH.   The e-mail message begins by lauding the\n\nhospital's \"performance on national quality and safety\n\nstandards,\" and notes that the \"employees and caregivers at\" the\n\nhospital are the reason for its exemplary performance.     Walczak\n\nthen states that he had \"thoroughly investigated\" allegations\n\nconcerning the incidents at the unit, \"determined that [the\n\nplaintiff nurses] have not been acting in the best interest of\n\ntheir patients, the hospital, or the community we serve,\" and\n\nconcluded by addressing the plaintiff nurses' termination.\n\nThere is nothing in this text to suggest that it was intended to\n\ninfluence, inform, or reach anyone other than the hospital\n\nemployees to whom an explanation of concerning events at their\n\nworkplace was given.\n\n    In light of this, we conclude that while Walczak's\n\nstatements to the Boston Globe were protected petitioning\n\nactivity, his e-mail message to hospital employees was not an\n\nexercise of the hospital defendants' right of petition.\n\f                                                                   21\n\n\n    c.   The meaning of \"based on.\"   Given the foregoing, the\n\nhospital defendants take the view that they have met their\n\nthreshold burden by showing that the portion of the defamation\n\nclaim based on the Boston Globe articles is solely based on such\n\npetitioning activity.   They maintain that, if the nurses cannot\n\nshow that this petitioning activity was, in essence, a sham, so\n\nmuch of their claim as asserts that the Boston Globe statements\n\ndefamed them should be dismissed, with the plaintiff nurses made\n\nto pay a proportionate amount of the defendants' legal fees and\n\ncosts.   The plaintiff nurses, in contrast, maintain that,\n\nbecause some of their unitary defamation claim rests on\n\nnonpetitioning activity, the hospital defendants fail to show\n\nthat the defamation claim is solely based on the defendants'\n\npetitioning activity.\n\n    Although we have said that a complaint should be evaluated\n\ncount by count for anti-SLAPP purposes, see Wenger v. Aceto, 451\n\nMass. 1, 9 (2008) (granting special motion to dismiss with\n\nrespect to two specific counts in nonmoving party's complaint),\n\nwe have not had occasion to consider whether, at the threshold\n\nburden stage, the special movant can meet its burden by showing\n\nthat a portion of the nonmoving party's claim is based on\n\npetitioning activity.   Because the outcome of the threshold\n\nburden inquiry so often proves dispositive of the special\n\nmotion, the permutations of that preliminary stage have largely\n\f                                                                   22\n\n\noccupied the field of appellate consideration.19   This case\n\ninvolves yet another variation on that theme.   However, it also\n\ninvolves more than that.\n\n\n     19\n        Twelve out of the seventeen cases decided by this court\nand the majority of the cases decided by the Appeals Court that\naddress the anti-SLAPP statute in depth have centered on the\nspecial movant's threshold burden. This appellate jurisprudence\nhas split the special movant's threshold burden into three\nparts. First, the special movant must establish that its\ncomplained of conduct is petitioning activity. See, e.g.,\nHanover v. New England Regional Council of Carpenters, 467 Mass.\n587, 590-595 (2014); Marabello v. Boston Bark Corp., 463 Mass.\n394, 397-400 (2012); North Am. Expositions Co. Ltd. Partnership\nv. Corcoran, 452 Mass. 852, 861-862 (2009); Cadle Co. v.\nSchlichtmann, 448 Mass. 242, 250 (2007); Global NAPs, Inc. v.\nVerizon New England, Inc., 63 Mass. App. Ct. 600, 606-607\n(2005). Second, the special movant must establish that the\nactivity is its own petitioning activity. See, e.g., Cardno\nChemRisk, LLC, 476 Mass. 485, 486 (2017); Fustolo v. Hollander,\n455 Mass. 861, 869 (2010); Kobrin v. Gastfriend, 443 Mass. 327,\n330 (2005). Third, the special movant must demonstrate that the\nnonmoving party's claims are solely based on its petitioning\nactivity. See, e.g., Matter of the Discipline of Attorney, 442\nMass. 660, 673-674 (2004); Office One, Inc. v. Lopez, 437 Mass.\n113, 121-123 (2002); Fabre v. Walton, 436 Mass. 517, 522-523\n(2002); McLarnon v. Jokisch, 431 Mass. 343, 348 (2000);\nDuracraft Corp. v. Holmes Products Corp., 427 Mass. 156, 167-168\n(1998).\n\n     Similarly, Appeals Court cases construing the anti-SLAPP\nstatute center chiefly on the nonmoving party's threshold\nburden. See Chiulli v. Liberty Mut. Ins., Inc., 87 Mass. App.\nCt. 229, 234 (2015); Keystone Freight Corp. v. Bartlett Consol.,\nInc., 77 Mass. App. Ct. 304, 316 (2010); Brice Estates, Inc. v.\nSmith, 76 Mass. App. Ct. 394, 396-397 (2010); Burley v. Comets\nCommunity Youth Ctr., Inc., 75 Mass. App. Ct. 818, 823-824\n(2009); Dickey v. Warren, 75 Mass. App. Ct. 585, 588-589 (2009),\ncert. denied, 560 U.S. 926 (2010); Ehrlich v. Stern, 74 Mass.\nApp. Ct. 531, 537-538 (2009); Guiffrida v. High Country\nInvestor, Inc., 73 Mass. App. Ct. 225, 243 (2008); Moriarty v.\nMayor of Holyoke, 71 Mass. App. Ct. 442, 447-448 (2008); Fisher\nv. Lint, 69 Mass. App. Ct. 360, 363-365 (2007); SMS Financial V,\nLLC v. Conti, 68 Mass. App. Ct. 738, 745-747 (2007); Kalter v.\n\f                                                                  23\n\n\n    Each of the positions advanced by the parties as to what\n\nsolely based on should entail at the threshold burden stage has\n\nsome merit, but our resolution of that issue cannot reach or\n\nsettle the deeper problem that is laid bare in this appeal.\n\nThat problem is whether the plaintiff nurses' defamation claim\n\nis, in fact, a \"SLAPP\" suit at all.   Otherwise put, even if it\n\nwere shown that the Boston Globe based portion of the nurses'\n\ndefamation claim arises from and is, in that limited sense,\n\nsolely based on their hospital employer's quite legitimate\n\npetitioning activity, it nevertheless remains unclear whether\n\nthis qualifies as a disfavored \"SLAPP\" suit meriting early\n\ndismissal.   Under current case law, the inquiry ends without\n\n\n\nWood, 67 Mass. App. Ct. 584, 586-591 (2006); Global NAPS, Inc.,\nsupra at 603-607; Wynne v. Creigle, 63 Mass.

App. Ct. 290, 294-295 (2003);\nAyasli v. Armstrong, 56 Mass. App. Ct. 740, 748-749 (2002).\n\n     By contrast, only a handful of cases from this court\naddress the nonmoving party's second-stage burden under the\nanti-SLAPP statute in a substantial way. See Van Liew v.\nStansfield, 474 Mass. 31, 36-41 (2016); Benoit v. Frederickson,\n454 Mass. 148, 153-154 (2009); Wenger v. Aceto, 451 Mass. 1, 6-9\n(2008); Fabre, 436 Mass. at 524-525; Baker v. Parsons, 434 Mass.\n543, 553-554 (2001). Similarly, only a smattering of Appeals\nCourt opinions address substantively the nonmoving party's\nburden. See The Gillette Co. v. Provost, 91 Mass. App. Ct. 133,\n137-140 (2017); Demoulas Super Mkts. v. Ryan, 70 Mass. App. Ct.\n259, 263-268 (2007); DiPiero v. Burke, 70 Mass. App. Ct. 154,\n158-161 (2007); Garabedian v. Westland, 59 Mass. App. Ct. 427,\n434 (2003); Donovan v. Gardner, 50 Mass. App. Ct. 595, 599-601\n(2000); Vittands v. Sudduth, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 401, 414-415\n(2000).\n\f                                                                    24\n\n\npermitting confirmation that the fundamental statutory concern\n\nis satisfied, much like the proverbial unacknowledged elephant\n\nin the room.   To ensure that only \"SLAPP\" suits -- those without\n\nmerit primarily brought to chill legitimate petitioning\n\nactivities -- are subject to early dismissal and its attendant\n\nfinancial penalties, we conclude that the statutory term \"based\n\non\" must be accorded broader meaning than it has at present.\n\n    We turn first, then, to what the threshold burden demands\n\nof the special movant seeking early dismissal under the anti-\n\nSLAPP statute.   In essence, the Duracraft framework imposes the\n\nthreshold burden as an initial screening device, requiring the\n\nspecial movant to show in the first instance that the claims\n\nagainst it in fact arose only from its own petitioning\n\nactivities.    It stands to reason that, in doing so, the special\n\nmovant must take the adverse complaint as it finds it, and\n\ncannot fairly be expected to overcome the manner in which a\n\nnonmoving party has chosen to structure its complaint.    Thus,\n\nhowever reasonable it may have been for the nurses to frame\n\ntheir defamation claim against the hospital defendants as one\n\ncount including two types of communications, we agree with the\n\nAppeals Court that, when ascertaining whether petitioning\n\nactivity is the sole basis of a claim, the structure of the\n\nnonmoving party's complaint ordinarily cannot be dispositive of\n\nthe matter.    See Blanchard, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 111 n.13.   Were\n\f                                                                  25\n\n\nit otherwise, nonmoving parties could undercut the anti-SLAPP\n\nstatute and its salutary purpose by combining into a single\n\ncount claims that are based on both petitioning and\n\nnonpetitioning activities.   Where, as here, the claim structured\n\nas a single count readily could have been pleaded as separate\n\ncounts, a special movant can meet its threshold burden with\n\nrespect to the portion of that count based on petitioning\n\nactivity.\n\n      That being said, the plaintiff nurses' contrary position as\n\nto the scope of the threshold burden finds support in Erhlich v.\n\nStern, 74 Mass. App. Ct. 531, 536 (2009), which notes the\n\nconsiderable potency of the sweeping early dismissal remedy\n\nprovided by the anti-SLAPP statute.   In an effort to assure that\n\nthis remedy is confined only to suits meriting such harsh\n\ntreatment, the Appeals Court construed the threshold burden\n\nstrictly, stating that \"the anti-SLAPP inquiry produces an all\n\nor nothing result as to each count the complaint contains . . .\n\nand the statute does not create a process for parsing counts to\n\nsegregate components that can proceed from those that cannot.\"\n\nId.   While, as explained, we depart from the Ehrlich view of the\n\nthreshold burden, we recognize the well-founded concerns that\n\nunderlie it and that prompt us now to revisit the Duracraft\n\nframework.\n\f                                                                   26\n\n\n     Under current law, there are only two ways for a nonmoving\n\nparty, such as the nurses here, to resist the early dismissal of\n\ntheir claim as a \"SLAPP\" suit.   One way is to argue that the\n\nspecial movant has not met its threshold burden.   Failing that,\n\nthe other way is to argue that the special movant's petitioning\n\nactivity was not legitimate but instead a sham, i.e., lacking\n\nany reasonable basis in fact or law.   Because it is often\n\ndifficult to make the latter showing,20 the dispositive issue\n\ntends to be whether the special movant's threshold burden has\n\nbeen met.   But, as this case illustrates, even where that burden\n\nhas been met and the petitioning activity in question may be\n\nentirely legitimate, such inquiry is not entirely adequate to\n\nthe task of determining whether the special motion should be\n\nallowed.\n\n     Particularly in instances where, as here, the classic\n\nindicia of a \"SLAPP\" suit, see Duracraft, 427 Mass. at 161-162,\n\n     20\n       Under current case law, in order to meet its second-stage\nburden under the anti-SLAPP statute, a nonmoving party must, in\nessence, demonstrate through pleadings and affidavits that there\nis no credible factual or legal basis for the special movant's\npetitioning activities. See Benoit, 454 Mass. at 154 n.7;\nWenger, 451 Mass. at 7-8. Given the high bar for nonmoving\nparties that this generally represents, it is little wonder that\nthe plaintiff nurses focused almost entirely on the hospital\ndefendants' purported failure to meet their threshold burden.\nSee Blanchard, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 109 (concluding that\nplaintiff nurses did not attempt to make showing that hospital\ndefendants' statements to Boston Globe were \"devoid of factual\nor legal support\" and thus failed to meet their second-stage\nburden).\n\f                                                                  27\n\n\nappear to be absent,21 the present framework does not provide\n\nadequate means to distinguish between meritless claims targeting\n\nlegitimate petitioning activity and meritorious claims with no\n\nsuch goal.22   It is only the former, the actual \"SLAPP\" suit,\n\nthat the Legislature intended to stop early in its tracks.     The\n\nLegislature did not intend the expedited remedy it provided, the\n\nspecial motion to dismiss, to be used instead as a cudgel to\n\nforestall and chill the legitimate claims -- also petitioning\n\nactivity -- of those who may truly be aggrieved by the sometimes\n\ncollateral damage wrought by another's valid petitioning\n\nactivity.   We are mindful that the threshold burden was itself\n\ncrafted to address this underlying concern and its genesis\n\naccordingly remains instructive.\n\n\n\n\n     21\n       Contrast Cardno ChemRisk, LLC, 476 Mass. at 480-483 &\nn.10, where the plaintiff nonmoving party, an established\nscientific consulting firm, brought defamation claims in two\nStates against individual environmental activists of modest\nmeans, while not having brought such claims against parties of\napparent financial capacity and public stature who had published\nsimilar allegedly defamatory statements. Following its receipt\nof discovery from the individual defendants but before\nresponding to the defendants' discovery requests, and during the\npendency of the defendants' ultimately successful appeal from\nthe denial of their special motion to dismiss, the plaintiff\nmoved voluntarily to dismiss its lawsuit; the motion was denied.\nId. at 483 n.8.\n     22\n       The plaintiff nurses, for their part, maintain that they\nsupported the goal of the hospital defendants' petitioning,\nwhich was to preserve the hospital's license to operate the\nunit.\n\f                                                                     28\n\n\n    The threshold burden, not appearing in the anti-SLAPP\n\nstatute itself, was prudently imposed upon special movants as a\n\nmeans of bridging the discrepancy between the statute's evident\n\npurpose and its language and, thereby, of addressing\n\nconstitutional concerns otherwise raised.     Duracraft, 427 Mass.\n\nat 167-168.   While the Legislature passed the anti-SLAPP statute\n\nto counteract \"meritless\" lawsuits brought to chill a party's\n\npetitioning activity, i.e., \"SLAPP\" suits, id. at 161, the\n\nDuracraft court realized that the \"statutory language fails to\n\ntrack and implement such an objective.\"     Id. at 166.   See id. at\n\n163 (\"In the statute as enacted, the Legislature . . . did not\n\naddress concerns over its breadth and reach, and ignored its\n\npotential uses in litigation far different from the typical\n\nSLAPP suit\").\n\n    The statute as written does not focus on ascertaining\n\nwhether the nonmoving party's claim is in fact a \"SLAPP\" suit.\n\nInstead, it looks only to whether the special movant's own\n\nlegitimate petitioning activity forms the basis of that claim.\n\nThis leaves open the possibility that a special movant, whose\n\nlegitimate petitioning activity forms the basis of a meritorious\n\nadverse claim that is not primarily geared toward chilling such\n\npetitioning, may nonetheless use the special motion to eradicate\n\f                                                                  29\n\n\nthat nonmoving party's adverse claim.23   As has long been\n\nrecognized, this potential infringement of an \"adverse party's\n\nexercise of its right to petition, even when it is not engaged\n\nin sham petitioning . . . has troubled judges and bedeviled the\n\nstatute's application.\"   Duracraft, 427 Mass. at 166-167.24\n\n\n     23\n       The Illinois Supreme Court described the problem\nsuccinctly when addressing Illinois's anti-SLAPP law, which in\nmany respects mirrors that of the Commonwealth. The court\nwrote:\n\n          \"The sham exception tests the genuineness of the\n     defendants' acts; it says nothing about the merits of the\n     plaintiff's lawsuit. It is entirely possible that\n     defendants could spread malicious lies about an individual\n     while in the course of genuinely petitioning the government\n     for a favorable result. For instance, in the case at bar,\n     plaintiff alleges that defendants defamed him by making\n     statements that plaintiff abused children, did not get\n     along with colleagues, and performed poorly at his job.\n     Assuming these statements constitute actionable defamation,\n     it does not follow that defendants were not genuinely\n     attempting to achieve a favorable governmental result by\n     pressuring the school board into firing the plaintiff. If\n     a plaintiff's complaint genuinely seeks redress for damages\n     from defamation or other intentional torts and, thus, does\n     not constitute a SLAPP, it is irrelevant whether the\n     defendants' actions were genuinely aimed at procuring\n     favorable government action, result, or outcome\" (footnote\n     and quotations omitted).\n\nSandholm v.

Without also\n\nconsidering the nonmoving party's claim, however, a court cannot\n\nadequately assess whether it is a meritless \"SLAPP\" suit aimed\n\nprimarily at chilling a special movant's right to petition or,\n\ninstead, a valid exercise of the nonmoving party's own right to\n\npetition.\n\n    d.   Augmenting the Duracraft framework.    To ensure that the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute will \"distinguish meritless from meritorious\n\nclaims, as was intended by the Legislature,\" Duracraft, 427\n\nMass. at 168, we once again narrow the problematic sweep of the\n\nstatute by broadening the meaning of the term \"based on.\"     A\n\nnonmoving party's claim is not subject to dismissal as one\n\n\"based on\" a special movant's petitioning activity if, when the\n\nburden shifts to it, the nonmoving party can establish that its\n\nsuit was not \"brought primarily to chill\" the special movant's\n\nlegitimate exercise of its right to petition.    See Duracraft,\n\n427 Mass. at 161, quoting 1994 House Doc. No. 1520.   In other\n\nwords, a claim that is not a \"SLAPP\" suit will not be dismissed.\n\f                                                                   32\n\n\n    As a practical matter, the expedited special motion to\n\ndismiss will proceed as follows, still in essentially two\n\nstages, taking place early in the litigation and with limited\n\ndiscovery available only by leave of court.   See G. L. c. 231,\n\n§ 59H.   At the first stage, a special movant must demonstrate\n\nthat the nonmoving party's claims are solely based on its own\n\npetitioning activities.   This is the familiar Duracraft\n\nthreshold inquiry, which will remain unchanged.   At the second\n\nstage, if the special movant meets this initial burden, the\n\nburden will shift, as it does now, to the nonmoving party.      The\n\nnonmoving party may still prevail, as at present, by\n\ndemonstrating that the special movant's petitioning activities\n\nupon which the challenged claim is based lack a reasonable basis\n\nin fact or law, i.e., constitute sham petitioning, and that the\n\npetitioning activities at issue caused it injury.   G. L. c. 231,\n\n§ 59H.\n\n    If it cannot make this showing, however, the nonmoving\n\nparty may henceforth meet its second-stage burden and defeat the\n\nspecial motion to dismiss by demonstrating in the alternative\n\nthat each challenged claim does not give rise to a \"SLAPP\" suit.\n\nIt may do so by demonstrating that each such claim was not\n\nprimarily brought to chill the special movant's legitimate\n\npetitioning activities.   To make this showing, the nonmoving\n\nparty must establish, such that the motion judge may conclude\n\f                                                                   33\n\n\nwith fair assurance, that its primary motivating goal in\n\nbringing its claim, viewed in its entirety, was \"not to\n\ninterfere with and burden defendants' . . . petition rights, but\n\nto seek damages for the personal harm to [it] from [the]\n\ndefendants' alleged . . . [legally transgressive] acts.\"\n\nSandholm v. Kuecker, 2012 IL 111443, ¶ 57.   The nonmoving party\n\nmust make this showing with respect to each such claim viewed as\n\na whole.25\n\n     In applying this standard, the motion judge, in the\n\nexercise of sound discretion, is to assess the totality of the\n\ncircumstances pertinent to the nonmoving party's asserted\n\nprimary purpose in bringing its claim.   The course and manner of\n\n     25\n       At the first stage of the anti-SLAPP inquiry, courts\nassess whether the nonmoving party's claim is solely \"based on\"\nthe special movant's petitioning activity in the sense that the\nnonmoving party's claim itself arises only from and complains\nonly of that petitioning activity. See Fabre, 436 Mass. at 524.\nIf the special movant meets this threshold burden, and the\nnonmoving party then fails to show that such petitioning\nactivity was sham petitioning, the nonmoving party may now\nattempt to establish, under the augmented Duracraft framework,\nthat its claim is not \"based on\" the special movant's legitimate\npetitioning activity because its primary motivating goal in\nbringing the claim was not to chill such petitioning. Because\nat this stage the motion judge is to assess in a holistic\nfashion whether the claim at issue is a \"SLAPP\" suit, the\nnonmoving party's showing in this regard is as to the entirety\nof its claim. Otherwise put, the plaintiff nurses on remand may\nattempt to demonstrate that their primary motivating goal in\nbringing a purportedly meritorious defamation claim against the\nhospital defendants -- alleging as defamatory both the e-mail\nmessage to employees and the Boston Globe articles -- was not to\nchill the hospital defendants' legitimate exercise of their\nright to petition government in aid of retaining the hospital's\nlicensure of the unit.\n\f                                                                  34\n\n\nproceedings, the pleadings filed, and affidavits \"stating the\n\nfacts upon which the liability or defense is based,\" G. L.\n\nc. 231, § 59H, may all be considered in evaluating whether the\n\nclaim is a \"SLAPP\" suit.   See Duracraft, 427 Mass. at 161-162\n\n(listing classic indicia of \"SLAPP\" suits).26   A necessary but\n\nnot sufficient factor in this analysis will be whether the\n\nnonmoving party's claim at issue is \"colorable or . . . worthy\n\nof being presented to and considered by the court,\" see L.B. v.\n\nChief Justice of Probate & Family Court Dept., 474 Mass. 231,\n\n241 (2016), i.e., whether it \"offers some reasonable\n\npossibility\" of a decision in the party's favor.   See\n\nCommonwealth v. Levin, 7 Mass. App. Ct. 501, 504 (1979).\n\n     On remand, then, the plaintiff nurses may seek to\n\ndemonstrate that the hospital defendants' petitioning activity,\n\ni.e., the statements in the Boston Globe article, lacks any\n\nreasonable basis in fact or law and caused the nurses injury.\n\n     26\n       This type of inquiry is not unknown in the anti-SLAPP\ncontext. In Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, 442\nMass. 660, 674 (2004), an attorney facing disciplinary charges\nfor allegedly attempting to influence a witness improperly\nresponded by filing a special motion to dismiss. Because we\ndetermined that bar counsel did not have an improper purpose in\nbringing charges against the attorney, we denied the attorney's\nspecial motion. Id. We based our conclusion on two factors:\n(1) bar counsel had \"sought to sanction the respondent for\n'conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice,'\nan undoubtedly meritorious charge if a witness had been\ninfluenced by improper means;\" and (2) \"the less than careful\nmeans of communication employed by the respondent left his\nconduct at least open to the interpretation urged by bar\ncounsel.\" Id.\n\f                                                                    35\n\n\nFailing this, under the augmented Duracraft framework, they may\n\nseek to establish that their defamation claim, viewed as a\n\nwhole, is nonetheless not a \"SLAPP\" suit.     If the plaintiff\n\nnurses cannot meet their second-stage burden under the augmented\n\nframework, the hospital defendants' special motion to dismiss\n\nshall be allowed as to so much of the defamation claim as is\n\nbased on the Boston Globe articles, and an appropriate award of\n\nattorney's fees and costs shall be made.\n\n    4.   Conclusion.   The denial of the hospital defendants'\n\nspecial motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' defamation claim as to\n\nWalczak's statements to the Boston Globe is vacated.     In all\n\nother respects, the order is affirmed.     The matter is remanded\n\nto the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n                                   So ordered.\n\f",

It is one rooted in the fact that both parties\n\nenjoy the right to petition, including the right to seek redress\n\nin the courts.   The anti-SLAPP statute is meant to subject only\n\nmeritless SLAPP suits to expedited dismissal, yet it nonetheless\n\nmay be used to dismiss meritorious claims not intended primarily\n\nto chill petitioning.\n\n    Because the statute as thus construed remains at odds with\n\nevident legislative intent, and continues to raise\n\nconstitutional concerns, we take this opportunity to augment the\n\nframework set forth in the Duracraft case (Duracraft framework)\n\nby broadening the construction of the statutory term \"based on.\"\n\nWhile a nonmoving party may still defeat a special motion to\n\ndismiss by demonstrating that the special movant's petitioning\n\nactivity is a sham, we hold that a nonmoving party's claim also\n\nis not subject to dismissal as one solely based on a special\n\nmovant's petitioning activity if the nonmoving party can\n\nestablish that its claim was not \"brought primarily to chill\"\n\nthe special movant's legitimate exercise of its right to\n\npetition.

On remand, the plaintiff nurses may\n\nattempt to make such a showing in satisfaction of their burden.\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\n     1.   Background.   The unit at Steward Carney Hospital, Inc.,\n\nin Boston (hospital), is licensed by the Department of Mental\n\nHealth (DMH) and the Department of Public Health (DPH).5    In\n\nApril, 2011, there were four incidents involving alleged patient\n\nabuse or neglect at the unit.   The hospital immediately reported\n\nthese incidents to DMH, DPH, and the Department of Children and\n\nFamilies.   DMH commenced an investigation into the incidents,\n\nand required that there be no new admissions to the unit.     DMH\n\nalso considered revoking the hospital's license to operate the\n\nunit pending the hospital's response to the reports of abuse.\n\n     The hospital soon placed all but a small number of unit\n\nemployees, including managers, nurses, and mental health\n\ncounsellors, on paid administrative leave.   It also hired Scott\n\nHarshbarger, then senior counsel at the law firm Proskauer\n\nRose LLP, to conduct an investigation into the incidents, to\n\nrecommend remedial actions, and to represent the hospital's\n\ninterests in its dealings with the State agencies.   Upon\n\nconcluding his investigation, Harshbarger recommended to Walczak\n\nthat, in light of what he termed a \"code of silence\" amongst the\n\nunit's staff, \"it would be prudent to replace the current\n\n\n\n     5\n       The unit typically treats mentally and physically\nchallenged teenagers in \"acute states,\" who are admitted from\nother facilities as a \"last resort.\" Many of them are under the\ncustody of the Department of Children and Families and have\nlittle involvement with their families.\n\f                                                                   6\n\n\npersonnel in order to ensure quality care for these vulnerable\n\npatients.\"\n\n     After reviewing Harshbarger's recommendation, Walczak\n\ninformed each of the plaintiff nurses that he was terminating\n\nher employment.   The following day, he sent an electronic mail\n\n(e-mail) message to all hospital employees, which began by\n\nnoting that the hospital \"has a rich tradition of providing\n\nexcellent care to [its] patients.\"   After providing the\n\nhospital's employees with credit for this successful commitment\n\nto patient care, the message continued, in relevant part:\n\n          \"Recently, I have become aware of the alleged\n     incidents where a number of [hospital] staff have not\n     demonstrated this steadfast commitment to patient care. I\n     have thoroughly investigated these allegations and have\n     determined that these individual employees have not been\n     acting in the best interest of their patients, the\n     hospital, or the community we serve. As a result, I have\n     terminated the employment of each of these individuals.\"\n     In a Boston Globe article about the incidents two days\n\nafter the plaintiff nurses were fired, Walczak was quoted as\n\nsaying that, when he read Harshbarger's report, he \"decided to\n\nreplace the nurses and other staff on the unit.\"6   Walczak said\n\nthat the report recommended that he \"start over on the unit\" and\n\nthat his \"goal [was] to make it the best unit in the state.\"\n\nThe article noted that Walczak \"would not provide details of the\n\n     6\n       The article stated that Harshbarger had been investigating\nan employee's alleged sexual assault of a patient and\n\"conditions on the 14-bed locked unit for extremely troubled\nteens.\"\n\f                                                                  7\n\n\nalleged assault or patient safety concerns, or comment on why\n\nthe entire staff was dismissed, given that the allegation\n\ninvolved one employee and one patient.\"     Approximately one month\n\nlater, the Boston Globe published another article on the\n\nincidents at the hospital, quoting Walczak as stating that\n\n\"[t]he Harshbarger report indicated it wasn't a safe situation\"\n\nand stating that the report \"underscored his decision to fire\n\nthe entire staff of the unit.\"\n\n     In June, 2011, DMH issued its reports on each of the four\n\nincidents.     The reports concerning the first three incidents\n\nconcluded that there had been wrongdoing by a single mental\n\nhealth counsellor, while the fourth report concluded that\n\nunspecified staff on duty during the incident had acted\n\nimproperly.7\n\n     2.   Prior proceedings.    In May, 2013, in a five-count\n\ncomplaint brought against the hospital defendants, along with\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       In May, 2011, the union that represented the plaintiff\nnurses, the Massachusetts Nurses Association, filed grievances\non behalf of each of the unit's nurses, including each of the\nplaintiff nurses. Pursuant to the collective bargaining\nagreement between the hospital and this nurses association, the\ngrievances were subject to arbitration. The first arbitration\ninvolved five of the plaintiff nurses: Douglas, Hendrick, Herr,\nLang, and Woods. The arbitrator found in favor of the nurses\nand ordered, inter alia, their reinstatement. The hospital\nappealed from that ruling; the appeal is apparently still\npending.\n\f                                                                   8\n\n\nHarshbarger and Proskauer Rose LLP (Proskauer defendants),8 the\n\nplaintiff nurses claimed that the hospital defendants and the\n\nProskauer defendants had each defamed them.   The plaintiff\n\nnurses alleged, in one count of their complaint, that the\n\nhospital defendants defamed them both by the e-mail message sent\n\nto hospital employees announcing their terminations, as well as\n\nby communications made to and published by the Boston Globe.\n\nThe plaintiff nurses asserted that such statements falsely\n\nsuggested that \"after a thorough investigation, [Walczak] had\n\ndetermined . . . that each of the terminated plaintiffs had\n\ndemonstrated inadequate commitment to patient care and that each\n\nhad provided such deficient patient care that her employment had\n\nto be terminated.\"9\n\n     In their defamation claim against the Proskauer defendants,\n\nthe plaintiff nurses asserted that Harshbarger's preliminary and\n\n\n     8\n       The complaint also included a claim against the hospital\ndefendants for violation of the healthcare provider\nwhistleblower statute, G. L. c. 149, § 187, and plaintiffs Lang\nand Donahoe claimed that the hospital defendants retaliated\nagainst them for performing their obligations under the\nmandatory reporting statute, G. L. c. 119, § 51A. In addition,\nall of the plaintiff nurses asserted a claim of intentional or\nreckless infliction of emotional distress against Harshbarger\nand Proskauer Rose LLP.\n     9\n       The plaintiff nurses claimed that Walczak's \"statements\nimplied the existence of undisclosed facts, namely, that the\ndecision to terminate each of the plaintiff nurses was based on\nher actions in connection with undisclosed incidents involving\npatients in the unit, which were known to Walczak and had been\n'thoroughly investigated.'\"\n\f                                                                    9\n\n\nfinal written reports had defamed them by falsely suggesting\n\nthat they had \"adhered to a 'code of silence,'\" had failed to\n\nreport \"a variety of problems, . . . including misconduct,\" of\n\nwhich they were aware, and had been derelict in their duties in\n\na number of other respects.\n\n     Both sets of defendants responded by filing special motions\n\nto dismiss the defamation counts under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nSee G. L. c. 231, § 59H.10    A Superior Court judge allowed the\n\nProskauer defendants' special motion to dismiss, but denied the\n\nhospital defendants' motion.    The hospital defendants appealed.11\n\nThe Appeals Court reversed in part, allowing the defendants'\n\nspecial motion to dismiss with respect to Walczak's comments to\n\nthe Boston Globe, affirming the denial with respect to the e-\n\nmail message, and denying the hospital's motion for attorney's\n\nfees and costs.

The hospital defendants contend that the\n\nmotion judge erred in determining that Walczak's communications\n\nto the Boston Globe and to the hospital employees did not\n\nconstitute petitioning activity under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n\nThe hospital defendants argue that Walczak's statements to the\n\nBoston Globe, and his e-mail message to all hospital employees,\n\nwere the exercise of the hospital defendants' right to petition\n\nbecause such statements were made \"in connection with an issue\n\nunder consideration or review by a legislative, executive, or\n\njudicial body, or any other governmental proceeding.\"13   See\n\nG.

Statements to the Boston Globe.   Walczak's statements\n\nto the Boston Globe commented on DMH's inquiry into the\n\nincidents of abuse at the unit, and the hospital's attempts to\n\naddress the situation.   Walczak's comments had a plausible nexus\n\nto DMH's investigation based on their content and the high\n\nlikelihood that they would influence or at least reach DMH.\n\n     Based on their content, it can be reasonably inferred that\n\nWalczak's statements to the Boston Globe were intended to\n\ndemonstrate to DMH the hospital's public commitment to address\n\nthe underlying problems at the unit.   It is undisputed that DMH\n\nwas considering whether to revoke the hospital's license to\n\noperate the unit at the time that Walczak made his comments to\n\nthe Boston Globe.   DMH's decision whether to do so turned on the\n\nhospital's implementation of remedial steps to prevent future\n\nincidents.15   The content of Walczak's statements directly\n\naddresses DMH's concern.\n\n     In the first article, published on May 28, 2011, Walczak's\n\nstatements implied that he had decided to terminate the nurses'\n\nemployment as a remedial action, based on Harshbarger's\n\n\n     15\n       The then director of licensing at the Department of\nMental Health (DMH) testified at an arbitration hearing\nregarding the nurses' claim for reinstatement to the unit that\nthe decision whether to revoke the hospital's license to operate\nthe unit centered on the hospital's \"plan . . . to make [the\nsituation] right.\"\n\f                                                                  16\n\n\nrecommendation.   He is quoted as stating that the Harshbarger\n\nreport described \"serious concerns about patient safety and\n\nquality of care on the unit\" and that the report recommended he\n\n\"start over on the unit.\"   Walczak's statements in the second\n\narticle, dated June 22, 2011, noted that the Harshbarger report\n\nindicated \"it wasn't a safe situation [at the unit]\" and that\n\nthe reports of additional incidents \"required a much deeper look\n\nat what was going on in the unit.\"16   In both of these\n\nstatements, Walczak emphasized that he was following the advice\n\ncontained in the Harshbarger report in addressing the unit's\n\nproblems.\n\n     By making clear that the hospital was following\n\nHarshbarger's recommendations, the statements communicated to\n\nreaders, likely including some of the licensing decision makers\n\nat DMH, that progress was occurring at the hospital, and that\n\nits license to operate the unit should not be revoked.    These\n\nstatements were neither \"tangential\" nor \"unrelated to\n\ngovernmental involvement,\" Global NAPs, Inc., 63 Mass. App. Ct.\n\nat 607, but rather went to the heart of a government agency's\n\ndecision whether to terminate the hospital's license to operate\n\nthe unit.   The statements directly related to DMH's then-pending\n\ninvestigation and, in particular, to DMH's decision whether to\n\n     16\n       The article noted that, at the time, DMH had confirmed\nthe first three incidents at the unit and was still\ninvestigating the fourth asserted incident of abuse.\n\f                                                                      17\n\n\npull the plug on the hospital's license for the unit.     Walczak's\n\nstatements can fairly be said to have been \"closely and\n\nrationally related\" to DMH's investigation and \"in furtherance\n\nof the objective\" of the hospital's petitioning -- the\n\npreservation of the hospital's license to operate the unit.\n\nPlante, 63 Mass. App. Ct. at 159.\n\n    Walczak's statements, moreover, were issued in a manner\n\nthat was likely to influence or, at the very least, reach DMH.\n\nHe made his statements to the Boston Globe, a newspaper \"widely\n\ncirculated in Boston and throughout the Commonwealth.\"       Brauer\n\nv. Globe Newspaper Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2141199\"><a href=\"/opinion/2141199/brauer-v-globe-newspaper-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1966).    Decision\n\nmakers at DMH, and members of the public wishing to weigh in on\n\nthe licensing decision, could reasonably have been expected to\n\nread Walczak's statements.    The timing of Walczak's statements\n\nto the Boston Globe indicates, as well, a plausible nexus\n\nbetween the communications and DMH's licensure decision, the\n\nstatements having been made while DMH's investigation was still\n\nongoing.\n\n    The plaintiff nurses contend that Walczak made the\n\nstatements primarily to defend the unit's reputation to the\n\npublic.    This goal, however, hardly can be seen as unrelated to\n\nthe hospital's objective of convincing DMH to leave intact the\n\nhospital's license to operate the unit.    The greater the\n\npublic's confidence in and support for the hospital, the more\n\f                                                                    18\n\n\ncomplex any decision to revoke the hospital's license to operate\n\nthe unit would become.     Ulterior motives, in any event, do not\n\nbear on the petitioning nature of the statements to the Boston\n\nGlobe.   See North Am. Expositions Co. Ltd. Partnership, 452\n\nMass. at 863 (\"the fact that . . . speech involves a commercial\n\nmotive does not mean it is not petitioning\").     Accordingly, we\n\nconclude that Walczak's statements to the Boston Globe were\n\nprotected petitioning activity under the anti-SLAPP statute.\n\n    ii.      Internal e-mail message.   In contrast, Walczak's e-\n\nmail message to all hospital employees concerning the\n\ntermination of the plaintiff nurses' employment was not\n\npetitioning activity.     Neither the content of the e-mail\n\nmessage, nor any evidence offered by the hospital defendants,\n\nsuggests any audience for the message other than hospital\n\nemployees.    The explanation of troubling events at their\n\nworkplace that was presented to hospital employees in an e-mail\n\nmessage by the hospital's president has no plausible nexus to\n\nthe hospital's efforts to sway DMH's licensing decision.\n\n    In this regard, the defendants have not shown that the e-\n\nmail message to employees had reached, or was reasonably likely\n\nto reach, DMH.    A private statement to a select group of people\n\ndoes not, without more, establish a plausible nexus to a\n\ngovernmental proceeding.     It stands to reason that statements\n\ncannot be \"in furtherance of\" petitioning the government if they\n\f                                                                   19\n\n\nare not reasonably geared to reaching it.    Plante, 63 Mass. App.\n\nCt. at 159.   The defendants have not shown that the hospital or\n\nsomeone on its behalf had forwarded the e-mail message to DMH or\n\neven had informed DMH that it had been sent to hospital\n\nemployees.    Nor have the defendants shown that someone in the\n\nhospital's employ receiving the e-mail message reasonably would\n\nbe expected to or did communicate its message to DMH.     Walczak's\n\nconclusory affidavit stating that he intended the e-mail message\n\nto come to DMH's attention17 does not indicate any mechanism\n\nthrough which the statement could arrive at the agency.18    See\n\nBurley, 75 Mass. App. Ct. at 823-824 (defendants' message to\n\nemployees was not petitioning activity despite defendants'\n\ncontention that they intended message to be conveyed to police).\n\n\n\n\n     17\n       Walczak attested that he had sent the electronic mail (e-\nmail) message \"not only to communicate to the hospital employees\nwhat was happening, but to give assurances to the regulatory\nagencies\" in the process of determining whether to revoke the\nhospital's license to operate the unit \"that the deficiencies\nwhich ha[d] been reported on the [u]nit would not continue.\"\nYet the defendants fail to establish that DMH likely would have\nencountered the message, let alone that what employees were told\nwould influence DMH's decision concerning the hospital's license\nto operate the unit.\n     18\n       The defendants also note that, in his affidavit,\nHarshbarger stated that he communicated to the general counsel\nof DMH, \"the action [that the hospital's] leadership was taking\nin response to the [i]ncidents.\" Harshbarger's summation of the\nhospital's efforts, however, does not affect the analysis of\nwhether Walczak's e-mail message was intended to or did\ninfluence DMH.\n\f                                                                     20\n\n\nWalczak's intent alone does not suffice in the circumstances to\n\nestablish the requisite nexus.\n\n    Moreover, nothing in the content of the e-mail message\n\nitself, stating in essence that the terminated nurses deviated\n\nfrom the hospital's \"rich tradition of providing excellent care\n\nto [its] patients,\" suggests that it was intended to influence\n\nor reach DMH.   The e-mail message begins by lauding the\n\nhospital's \"performance on national quality and safety\n\nstandards,\" and notes that the \"employees and caregivers at\" the\n\nhospital are the reason for its exemplary performance.     Walczak\n\nthen states that he had \"thoroughly investigated\" allegations\n\nconcerning the incidents at the unit, \"determined that [the\n\nplaintiff nurses] have not been acting in the best interest of\n\ntheir patients, the hospital, or the community we serve,\" and\n\nconcluded by addressing the plaintiff nurses' termination.\n\nThere is nothing in this text to suggest that it was intended to\n\ninfluence, inform, or reach anyone other than the hospital\n\nemployees to whom an explanation of concerning events at their\n\nworkplace was given.\n\n    In light of this, we conclude that while Walczak's\n\nstatements to the Boston Globe were protected petitioning\n\nactivity, his e-mail message to hospital employees was not an\n\nexercise of the hospital defendants' right of petition.\n\f                                                                   21\n\n\n    c.   The meaning of \"based on.\"   Given the foregoing, the\n\nhospital defendants take the view that they have met their\n\nthreshold burden by showing that the portion of the defamation\n\nclaim based on the Boston Globe articles is solely based on such\n\npetitioning activity.   They maintain that, if the nurses cannot\n\nshow that this petitioning activity was, in essence, a sham, so\n\nmuch of their claim as asserts that the Boston Globe statements\n\ndefamed them should be dismissed, with the plaintiff nurses made\n\nto pay a proportionate amount of the defendants' legal fees and\n\ncosts.   The plaintiff nurses, in contrast, maintain that,\n\nbecause some of their unitary defamation claim rests on\n\nnonpetitioning activity, the hospital defendants fail to show\n\nthat the defamation claim is solely based on the defendants'\n\npetitioning activity.\n\n    Although we have said that a complaint should be evaluated\n\ncount by count for anti-SLAPP purposes, see Wenger v. Aceto, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (2008) (granting special motion to dismiss with\n\nrespect to two specific counts in nonmoving party's complaint),\n\nwe have not had occasion to consider whether, at the threshold\n\nburden stage, the special movant can meet its burden by showing\n\nthat a portion of the nonmoving party's claim is based on\n\npetitioning activity.

To ensure that only \"SLAPP\" suits -- those without\n\nmerit primarily brought to chill legitimate petitioning\n\nactivities -- are subject to early dismissal and its attendant\n\nfinancial penalties, we conclude that the statutory term \"based\n\non\" must be accorded broader meaning than it has at present.\n\n    We turn first, then, to what the threshold burden demands\n\nof the special movant seeking early dismissal under the anti-\n\nSLAPP statute.   In essence, the Duracraft framework imposes the\n\nthreshold burden as an initial screening device, requiring the\n\nspecial movant to show in the first instance that the claims\n\nagainst it in fact arose only from its own petitioning\n\nactivities.    It stands to reason that, in doing so, the special\n\nmovant must take the adverse complaint as it finds it, and\n\ncannot fairly be expected to overcome the manner in which a\n\nnonmoving party has chosen to structure its complaint.    Thus,\n\nhowever reasonable it may have been for the nurses to frame\n\ntheir defamation claim against the hospital defendants as one\n\ncount including two types of communications, we agree with the\n\nAppeals Court that, when ascertaining whether petitioning\n\nactivity is the sole basis of a claim, the structure of the\n\nnonmoving party's complaint ordinarily cannot be dispositive of\n\nthe matter.    See Blanchard, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 111 n.13.   Were\n\f                                                                  25\n\n\nit otherwise, nonmoving parties could undercut the anti-SLAPP\n\nstatute and its salutary purpose by combining into a single\n\ncount claims that are based on both petitioning and\n\nnonpetitioning activities.   Where, as here, the claim structured\n\nas a single count readily could have been pleaded as separate\n\ncounts, a special movant can meet its threshold burden with\n\nrespect to the portion of that count based on petitioning\n\nactivity.\n\n      That being said, the plaintiff nurses' contrary position as\n\nto the scope of the threshold burden finds support in Erhlich v.\n\nStern, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass. App. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536 (2009), which notes the\n\nconsiderable potency of the sweeping early dismissal remedy\n\nprovided by the anti-SLAPP statute.   In an effort to assure that\n\nthis remedy is confined only to suits meriting such harsh\n\ntreatment, the Appeals Court construed the threshold burden\n\nstrictly, stating that \"the anti-SLAPP inquiry produces an all\n\nor nothing result as to each count the complaint contains . . .\n\nand the statute does not create a process for parsing counts to\n\nsegregate components that can proceed from those that cannot.\"\n\nId.   While, as explained, we depart from the Ehrlich view of the\n\nthreshold burden, we recognize the well-founded concerns that\n\nunderlie it and that prompt us now to revisit the Duracraft\n\nframework.\n\f                                                                   26\n\n\n     Under current law, there are only two ways for a nonmoving\n\nparty, such as the nurses here, to resist the early dismissal of\n\ntheir claim as a \"SLAPP\" suit.   One way is to argue that the\n\nspecial movant has not met its threshold burden.   Failing that,\n\nthe other way is to argue that the special movant's petitioning\n\nactivity was not legitimate but instead a sham, i.e., lacking\n\nany reasonable basis in fact or law.   Because it is often\n\ndifficult to make the latter showing,20 the dispositive issue\n\ntends to be whether the special movant's threshold burden has\n\nbeen met.   But, as this case illustrates, even where that burden\n\nhas been met and the petitioning activity in question may be\n\nentirely legitimate, such inquiry is not entirely adequate to\n\nthe task of determining whether the special motion should be\n\nallowed.\n\n     Particularly in instances where, as here, the classic\n\nindicia of a \"SLAPP\" suit, see Duracraft, 427 Mass. at 161-162,\n\n     20\n       Under current case law, in order to meet its second-stage\nburden under the anti-SLAPP statute, a nonmoving party must, in\nessence, demonstrate through pleadings and affidavits that there\nis no credible factual or legal basis for the special movant's\npetitioning activities. See Benoit, 454 Mass. at 154 n.7;\nWenger, 451 Mass. at 7-8. Given the high bar for nonmoving\nparties that this generally represents, it is little wonder that\nthe plaintiff nurses focused almost entirely on the hospital\ndefendants' purported failure to meet their threshold burden.\nSee Blanchard, 89 Mass. App. Ct. at 109 (concluding that\nplaintiff nurses did not attempt to make showing that hospital\ndefendants' statements to Boston Globe were \"devoid of factual\nor legal support\" and thus failed to meet their second-stage\nburden).\n\f                                                                  27\n\n\nappear to be absent,21 the present framework does not provide\n\nadequate means to distinguish between meritless claims targeting\n\nlegitimate petitioning activity and meritorious claims with no\n\nsuch goal.22   It is only the former, the actual \"SLAPP\" suit,\n\nthat the Legislature intended to stop early in its tracks.     The\n\nLegislature did not intend the expedited remedy it provided, the\n\nspecial motion to dismiss, to be used instead as a cudgel to\n\nforestall and chill the legitimate claims -- also petitioning\n\nactivity -- of those who may truly be aggrieved by the sometimes\n\ncollateral damage wrought by another's valid petitioning\n\nactivity.   We are mindful that the threshold burden was itself\n\ncrafted to address this underlying concern and its genesis\n\naccordingly remains instructive.\n\n\n\n\n     21\n       Contrast Cardno ChemRisk, LLC, 476 Mass. at 480-483 &\nn.10, where the plaintiff nonmoving party, an established\nscientific consulting firm, brought defamation claims in two\nStates against individual environmental activists of modest\nmeans, while not having brought such claims against parties of\napparent financial capacity and public stature who had published\nsimilar allegedly defamatory statements. Following its receipt\nof discovery from the individual defendants but before\nresponding to the defendants' discovery requests, and during the\npendency of the defendants' ultimately successful appeal from\nthe denial of their special motion to dismiss, the plaintiff\nmoved voluntarily to dismiss its lawsuit; the motion was denied.\nId. at 483 n.8.\n     22\n       The plaintiff nurses, for their part, maintain that they\nsupported the goal of the hospital defendants' petitioning,\nwhich was to preserve the hospital's license to operate the\nunit.\n\f                                                                     28\n\n\n    The threshold burden, not appearing in the anti-SLAPP\n\nstatute itself, was prudently imposed upon special movants as a\n\nmeans of bridging the discrepancy between the statute's evident\n\npurpose and its language and, thereby, of addressing\n\nconstitutional concerns otherwise raised.     Duracraft, 427 Mass.\n\nat 167-168.   While the Legislature passed the anti-SLAPP statute\n\nto counteract \"meritless\" lawsuits brought to chill a party's\n\npetitioning activity, i.e., \"SLAPP\" suits, id. at 161, the\n\nDuracraft court realized that the \"statutory language fails to\n\ntrack and implement such an objective.\"     Id. at 166.   See id. at\n\n163 (\"In the statute as enacted, the Legislature . . . did not\n\naddress concerns over its breadth and reach, and ignored its\n\npotential uses in litigation far different from the typical\n\nSLAPP suit\").\n\n    The statute as written does not focus on ascertaining\n\nwhether the nonmoving party's claim is in fact a \"SLAPP\" suit.\n\nInstead, it looks only to whether the special movant's own\n\nlegitimate petitioning activity forms the basis of that claim.\n\nThis leaves open the possibility that a special movant, whose\n\nlegitimate petitioning activity forms the basis of a meritorious\n\nadverse claim that is not primarily geared toward chilling such\n\npetitioning, may nonetheless use the special motion to eradicate\n\f                                                                  29\n\n\nthat nonmoving party's adverse claim.23   As has long been\n\nrecognized, this potential infringement of an \"adverse party's\n\nexercise of its right to petition, even when it is not engaged\n\nin sham petitioning . . . has troubled judges and bedeviled the\n\nstatute's application.\"   Duracraft, 427 Mass. at 166-167.24\n\n\n     23\n       The Illinois Supreme Court described the problem\nsuccinctly when addressing Illinois's anti-SLAPP law, which in\nmany respects mirrors that of the Commonwealth. The court\nwrote:\n\n          \"The sham exception tests the genuineness of the\n     defendants' acts; it says nothing about the merits of the\n     plaintiff's lawsuit. It is entirely possible that\n     defendants could spread malicious lies about an individual\n     while in the course of genuinely petitioning the government\n     for a favorable result. For instance, in the case at bar,\n     plaintiff alleges that defendants defamed him by making\n     statements that plaintiff abused children, did not get\n     along with colleagues, and performed poorly at his job.\n     Assuming these statements constitute actionable defamation,\n     it does not follow that defendants were not genuinely\n     attempting to achieve a favorable governmental result by\n     pressuring the school board into firing the plaintiff. If\n     a plaintiff's complaint genuinely seeks redress for damages\n     from defamation or other intentional torts and, thus, does\n     not constitute a SLAPP, it is irrelevant whether the\n     defendants' actions were genuinely aimed at procuring\n     favorable government action, result, or outcome\" (footnote\n     and quotations omitted).\n\nSandholm v.

See Duracraft, 427 Mass. at 165, 167\n\n(\"Because the Legislature intended to immunize parties from\n\nclaims 'based on' their petitioning activities, we adopt a\n\nconstruction of 'based on' that would exclude motions brought\n\nagainst meritorious claims with a substantial basis other than\n\nor in addition to the petitioning activities implicated\").

Without also\n\nconsidering the nonmoving party's claim, however, a court cannot\n\nadequately assess whether it is a meritless \"SLAPP\" suit aimed\n\nprimarily at chilling a special movant's right to petition or,\n\ninstead, a valid exercise of the nonmoving party's own right to\n\npetition.\n\n    d.   Augmenting the Duracraft framework.    To ensure that the\n\nanti-SLAPP statute will \"distinguish meritless from meritorious\n\nclaims, as was intended by the Legislature,\" Duracraft, 427\n\nMass. at 168, we once again narrow the problematic sweep of the\n\nstatute by broadening the meaning of the term \"based on.\"     A\n\nnonmoving party's claim is not subject to dismissal as one\n\n\"based on\" a special movant's petitioning activity if, when the\n\nburden shifts to it, the nonmoving party can establish that its\n\nsuit was not \"brought primarily to chill\" the special movant's\n\nlegitimate exercise of its right to petition.    See Duracraft,\n\n427 Mass. at 161, quoting 1994 House Doc. No. 1520.   In other\n\nwords, a claim that is not a \"SLAPP\" suit will not be dismissed.\n\f                                                                   32\n\n\n    As a practical matter, the expedited special motion to\n\ndismiss will proceed as follows, still in essentially two\n\nstages, taking place early in the litigation and with limited\n\ndiscovery available only by leave of court.   See G. L. c. 231,\n\n§ 59H.   At the first stage, a special movant must demonstrate\n\nthat the nonmoving party's claims are solely based on its own\n\npetitioning activities.   This is the familiar Duracraft\n\nthreshold inquiry, which will remain unchanged.   At the second\n\nstage, if the special movant meets this initial burden, the\n\nburden will shift, as it does now, to the nonmoving party.      The\n\nnonmoving party may still prevail, as at present, by\n\ndemonstrating that the special movant's petitioning activities\n\nupon which the challenged claim is based lack a reasonable basis\n\nin fact or law, i.e., constitute sham petitioning, and that the\n\npetitioning activities at issue caused it injury.   G. L. c. 231,\n\n§ 59H.\n\n    If it cannot make this showing, however, the nonmoving\n\nparty may henceforth meet its second-stage burden and defeat the\n\nspecial motion to dismiss by demonstrating in the alternative\n\nthat each challenged claim does not give rise to a \"SLAPP\" suit.\n\nIt may do so by demonstrating that each such claim was not\n\nprimarily brought to chill the special movant's legitimate\n\npetitioning activities.   To make this showing, the nonmoving\n\nparty must establish, such that the motion judge may conclude\n\f                                                                   33\n\n\nwith fair assurance, that its primary motivating goal in\n\nbringing its claim, viewed in its entirety, was \"not to\n\ninterfere with and burden defendants' . . . petition rights, but\n\nto seek damages for the personal harm to [it] from [the]\n\ndefendants' alleged . . . [legally transgressive] acts.\"\n\nSandholm v. Kuecker, 2012 IL 111443, ¶ 57.   The nonmoving party\n\nmust make this showing with respect to each such claim viewed as\n\na whole.25\n\n     In applying this standard, the motion judge, in the\n\nexercise of sound discretion, is to assess the totality of the\n\ncircumstances pertinent to the nonmoving party's asserted\n\nprimary purpose in bringing its claim.   The course and manner of\n\n     25\n       At the first stage of the anti-SLAPP inquiry, courts\nassess whether the nonmoving party's claim is solely \"based on\"\nthe special movant's petitioning activity in the sense that the\nnonmoving party's claim itself arises only from and complains\nonly of that petitioning activity. See Fabre, 436 Mass. at 524.\nIf the special movant meets this threshold burden, and the\nnonmoving party then fails to show that such petitioning\nactivity was sham petitioning, the nonmoving party may now\nattempt to establish, under the augmented Duracraft framework,\nthat its claim is not \"based on\" the special movant's legitimate\npetitioning activity because its primary motivating goal in\nbringing the claim was not to chill such petitioning. Because\nat this stage the motion judge is to assess in a holistic\nfashion whether the claim at issue is a \"SLAPP\" suit, the\nnonmoving party's showing in this regard is as to the entirety\nof its claim. Otherwise put, the plaintiff nurses on remand may\nattempt to demonstrate that their primary motivating goal in\nbringing a purportedly meritorious defamation claim against the\nhospital defendants -- alleging as defamatory both the e-mail\nmessage to employees and the Boston Globe articles -- was not to\nchill the hospital defendants' legitimate exercise of their\nright to petition government in aid of retaining the hospital's\nlicensure of the unit.\n\f                                                                  34\n\n\nproceedings, the pleadings filed, and affidavits \"stating the\n\nfacts upon which the liability or defense is based,\" G. L.\n\nc. 231, § 59H, may all be considered in evaluating whether the\n\nclaim is a \"SLAPP\" suit.   See Duracraft, 427 Mass. at 161-162\n\n(listing classic indicia of \"SLAPP\" suits).26   A necessary but\n\nnot sufficient factor in this analysis will be whether the\n\nnonmoving party's claim at issue is \"colorable or . . . worthy\n\nof being presented to and considered by the court,\" see L.B. v.\n\nChief Justice of Probate & Family Court Dept., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n241 (2016), i.e., whether it \"offers some reasonable\n\npossibility\" of a decision in the party's favor.

App. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504 (1979).\n\n     On remand, then, the plaintiff nurses may seek to\n\ndemonstrate that the hospital defendants' petitioning activity,\n\ni.e., the statements in the Boston Globe article, lacks any\n\nreasonable basis in fact or law and caused the nurses injury.\n\n     26\n       This type of inquiry is not unknown in the anti-SLAPP\ncontext. In Matter of the Discipline of an Attorney, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">660</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (2004), an attorney facing disciplinary charges\nfor allegedly attempting to influence a witness improperly\nresponded by filing a special motion to dismiss. Because we\ndetermined that bar counsel did not have an improper purpose in\nbringing charges against the attorney, we denied the attorney's\nspecial motion. Id. We based our conclusion on two factors:\n(1) bar counsel had \"sought to sanction the respondent for\n'conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice,'\nan undoubtedly meritorious charge if a witness had been\ninfluenced by improper means;\" and (2) \"the less than careful\nmeans of communication employed by the respondent left his\nconduct at least open to the interpretation urged by bar\ncounsel.\" Id.\n\f                                                                    35\n\n\nFailing this, under the augmented Duracraft framework, they may\n\nseek to establish that their defamation claim, viewed as a\n\nwhole, is nonetheless not a \"SLAPP\" suit.     If the plaintiff\n\nnurses cannot meet their second-stage burden under the augmented\n\nframework, the hospital defendants' special motion to dismiss\n\nshall be allowed as to so much of the defamation claim as is\n\nbased on the Boston Globe articles, and an appropriate award of\n\nattorney's fees and costs shall be made.\n\n    4.   Conclusion.   The denial of the hospital defendants'\n\nspecial motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' defamation claim as to\n\nWalczak's statements to the Boston Globe is vacated.     In all\n\nother respects, the order is affirmed.     The matter is remanded\n\nto the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.\n\n                                   So ordered.\n\f</pre>",
