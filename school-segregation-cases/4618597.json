ALDOUS, P.C., doing business as Aldous\nLaw Firm,\n\n             Plaintiffs - Appellants Cross-Appellees\n\nv.\n\nDARWIN NATIONAL ASSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n             Defendant - Appellee Cross-Appellant\n\n\n\n\n                Appeals from the United States District Court\n                     for the Northern District of Texas\n\n\nBefore REAVLEY, ELROD, and GRAVES, Circuit Judges.\nREAVLEY, Circuit Judge.\n      Litigation over two trusts begat litigation between the prevailing party,\nAlbert Hill III, and his attorneys. Appellant Charla Aldous is one of those\nattorneys, and she prevailed against her erstwhile client. In addition to\nestablishing an entitlement to significant attorney’s fees, Aldous and her\ncohort also successfully defended against breach of contract and professional\nnegligence claims, among others. Hill’s claims against the attorneys triggered\ninsurance coverage provided by appellee Darwin National Assurance, Co.,\nAldous’s insurer. And now, in this third layer of litigation, we confront the\n\f    Case: 16-10537    Document: 00513914606     Page: 2   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-10537\nresulting coverage dispute. Aldous claims Darwin did not pay enough to fully\ncover the costs of her defense. Darwin asserts it paid too much.\n      This case was decided in favor of Darwin on summary judgment. In a\nruling that effectively doomed Aldous’s claims, the district court ruled she was\njudicially estopped from claiming defense costs in excess of $668,068.38.\nBuilding on this ruling, the district court further found that Darwin was\nentitled to recover “overpayments” on an equitable “money had and received”\ntheory. Aldous appealed.\n      In addition to issues raised by the district court’s summary judgment\nruling, we are also called upon to decide whether the district court erred in\npartially granting a motion to dismiss brought by Darwin. Lastly, Darwin has\nfiled a cross-appeal, contending that judgment should not have been granted\nin favor of Aldous with respect to a breach of contract claim.\n                            I.    BACKGROUND\n      Along with Lisa Blue and Steve Malouf, Aldous represented Hill in\nlitigation that resulted in a judgment for their client valued at $114,745,870.\n(The association of lawyers Blue, Aldous, and Malouf are hereinafter referred\nto as “BAM.”) BAM represented Hill on a contingency basis, but Hill did not\nwant to pay. Litigation ensued. After BAM sued Hill, Hill counterclaimed,\nalleging breach of fiduciary duty, duress, breach of oral contract, fraud, and\nprofessional negligence.\n      Aldous had a valid professional liability insurance policy through\nDarwin (the “Policy”), and Hill’s counterclaims triggered coverage. Blue and\nMalouf were also covered under separate policies through separate insurers.\nBAM had already retained Alan Loewinsohn to represent its affirmative claims\nagainst Hill and requested that the insurers allow Loewinsohn to handle the\ndefense as well. The insurers relented.      The various parties agreed (and\ncontinue to agree) that Darwin is responsible only for one-third of the covered\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 16-10537    Document: 00513914606     Page: 3   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-10537\ncosts of defense; Blue and Malouf (or their insurers) were separately\nresponsible for their one-third shares.\n      BAM ultimately prevailed against Hill, securing an award of\n$21,942,961 in earned attorney’s fees (offset by $691,175.93), costs of\n$479,595.67, and the “reasonable costs and fees in defending against Hill III’s\ncounterclaims in the amount of $2,586,560.11.” By the time judgment was\nentered, Aldous and Darwin were already embroiled in this coverage dispute.\n      Aldous filed this suit in Texas state court, and it was removed to federal\ncourt on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. As relevant here, Aldous alleged\nbreach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, violations\nof the Texas Insurance Code, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade\nPractices Act. She also sought a declaratory judgment that Darwin is liable\nfor the costs associated with the prosecution of her affirmative claims against\nHill to the extent those affirmative claims were inextricably intertwined with\nher defense. Darwin counterclaimed, alleging (among other things) breach of\ncontract, unjust enrichment, and money had and received. The district court\npartially granted a Rule 12(b)(6) motion filed by Darwin, dismissing Aldous’\nbreach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim, as well as a Texas\nInsurance Code § 541 claim and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act claim.\nSubsequently, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n      On summary judgment, the district court ruled largely in favor of\nDarwin. In a ruling with major consequences, the district court ruled that\nAldous was judicially estopped from claiming that the costs in defending\nagainst Hill’s counterclaims exceeded $668,068.38. This ruling meant that\nDarwin’s coverage obligations were limited to $222,689.44—one-third of the\ntotal cost to defend. Darwin had paid Aldous far more than that, $502,364.59.\nBased on this ruling, Aldous’ breach of contract claim necessarily failed. The\njudicial estoppel ruling also meant that Darwin had overpaid, and the district\n                                          3\n\f    Case: 16-10537     Document: 00513914606         Page: 4   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-10537\ncourt ruled that Darwin could recover this overpayment through an action for\nmoney had and received. The district court further ruled that Aldous was not\nentitled to costs related to the prosecution of her affirmative claims against\nHill, even if she could show those affirmative claims were inextricably\nintertwined with her defense against Hill’s counterclaims. And, as clarified in\na subsequent order, the district court granted summary judgment against\nDarwin with respect to its breach of contract counterclaim, reasoning that the\nanti-subrogation rule prevented it from asserting subrogation rights against\nits own insured.\n                        II.    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n      Summary Judgment. Summary judgment rulings are subject to de\nnovo review. Cal-Dive Int’l, Inc. v. Seabright Ins. Co., 627 F.3d 110, 113 (5th\nCir. 2010). “We will affirm the district court’s judgment if no genuine issues of\nfact are presented and if judgment was proper as a matter of law.” Id. On\ncross-motions for summary judgment, we consider “each party’s motion\nindependently, viewing the evidence and inferences in the light most favorable\nto the nonmoving party.” Morgan v. Plano Indep. Sch. Dist., 589 F.3d 740, 745\n(5th Cir. 2009).\n      Motion to Dismiss.           Dismissal for failure to state a claim is also\nreviewed de novo. Colony Ins. Co. v. Peachtree Const., Ltd., 647 F.3d 248, 252\n(5th Cir. 2011). Dismissal is appropriate if, assuming the truth of all facts\nalleged in the complaint, the plaintiff is not entitled to relief as a matter of law.\nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009); see Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 12(b)(6).\n                               III.     DISCUSSION\n                              A.      Judicial Estoppel\n      As the parties understand, the district court’s judicial estoppel ruling\nhad major ripple effects. It is the foundation of the grant of summary judgment\n                                           4\n\f     Case: 16-10537      Document: 00513914606         Page: 5    Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-10537\nin favor of Darwin’s equitable claim for relief, and it precludes Aldous from\nestablishing any breach of contract. As we will see, however, the foundation is\nfaulty.    Application of judicial estoppel was inappropriate.\n       Texas law governs the substance of this dispute, but “we apply federal\nprinciples of judicial estoppel.” RSR Corp. v. Int’l Ins. Co., 612 F.3d 851, 859\n(5th Cir. 2010). There are two basic requirements: “First, it must be shown\nthat ‘the position of the party to be estopped is clearly inconsistent with its\nprevious one; and [second,] that party must have convinced the court to accept\nthat previous position.” 1 Id. (quoting Hall v. GE Plastic Pac. PTE Ltd., 327\nF.3d 391, 396 (5th Cir. 2003)). That said, “the Supreme Court has refused to\n‘establish inflexible prerequisites or an exhaustive formula for determining the\napplicability of judicial estoppel,’ stating instead that different considerations\n‘may inform the doctrine’s application in specific factual contexts.’” Reed v.\nCity of Arlington, 650 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (quoting New\nHampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 751, 121 S.Ct. 1808, 1815 (2001)). Even\nwhen serving as the basis for a summary judgment ruling, a district court’s\njudicial estoppel determination is reviewed for abuse of discretion. Kane v.\nNat’l Union Fire Ins. Co., 535 F.3d 380, 384 (5th Cir. 2008). “A district court\nabuses its discretion if it misapplies the law or bases its decision upon\nerroneous findings of fact.” RSR Corp., 612 F.3d at 859.\n       After thorough review of the record, we can only conclude that Aldous\nnever took the position (let alone “clearly”) that her defense costs in the\nunderlying suit were limited to $668,068.31 and that the prior court never\naccepted such a position.           The district court’s contrary determination\nrepresents an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n       1 Though not relevant here, we also typically ask whether the party to be estopped\nacted inadvertently. Reed v. City of Arlington, 650 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir. 2011) (en banc).\n                                             5\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606   Page: 6     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-10537\n      During the prior proceedings, BAM was required to show how much it\nexpended both in prosecuting its claims against Hill and in defending against\nHill’s counterclaims. The parties stipulated that these attorney’s fees could be\nestablished through declarations, and BAM’s attorney filed a series of relevant\ndeclarations (the “Loewinsohn Declarations”). The first of the declarations\nmakes it plain that BAM did not claim its costs of defense were limited to\n$668,068.31.    Therein, Loewinsohn asserted legal fees of $2,054,178.18,\nincluding both affirmative and defensive claims. He expressly declared that\nthe “fees and expenses can all be allocated either to the prosecution of BAM’s\nbreach of contract claim or to the defense of the counterclaims and affirmative\ndefenses asserted by the Hills, which was necessary in BAM’s prosecution of\ntheir claim, or both.”\n      That first declaration was filed on April 29, 2011. After that day, the\nrest of the litigation concerned only Hill’s counterclaims. On June 29, 2011,\nLoewinsohn submitted a “supplemental declaration” that further testified that\n“for the time period of May 1, 2011 to June 24, 2011, for the defense of the\nCounterclaims,” $668,068.31 had been reasonably expended.                Then, on\nJanuary 9, 2012, he submitted a “second supplemental declaration” which\n“incorporated by reference” the first and reiterated his opinion “that an\nattorney’s fee, including expenses, of $668,068.31 was a reasonable and\nnecessary fee for the defense of the Counterclaims.”       As can be readily seen,\nmere recitation of the Loewinsohn Declarations establishes that Aldous never\nclaimed that defense costs totaled $668,068.31. Rather, the fees incurred after\nApril 29 totaled $668,068.31 and were purely defense-related.\n      Two other notable facts emerge from the declarations and a review of the\nprior proceedings. First, the reason that fees incurred after April 29 related\nsolely to defending against Hill’s claims is that BAM’s affirmative claims had\nalready been litigated.      An evidentiary hearing commencing April 20th\n                                        6\n\f     Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606         Page: 7     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\nresolved those claims. Second, the lion’s share of dispositive defense work was\ndone prior to April 29, as shown by the judge’s ruling that, with one exception,\nall of Hill’s counterclaims “were legally barred based on her prior rulings”\nstemming from the April 20 hearing. 2\n       The district court’s ruling contains several errors. Most fundamentally,\nthe district court unjustifiably read the supplemental declaration in isolation.\nIt took as Aldous’s binding position that defense costs in the prior proceeding\nwere incurred only between May 1 and June 24 and that those costs totaled\n$668,068.31. To make this large error, the district court was required to make\nsmall antecedent errors.\n       For example, the district court refused to credit Aldous’s argument that\nthe first declaration did not segregate fees and therefore included costs related\nto defending against Hill. In the district court’s view, this argument was\nundercut by the fact that “Loewinsohn segregate[d] the fees associated with\nthe affirmative and defensive claims in his supplemental and second\nsupplemental declaration.” Charla G. Aldous, P.C. v. Darwin Nat. Assur. Co.,\n92 F.Supp.3d 555, 566 (N.D. Tex. 2015). Loewinsohn’s newfound ability to\nsegregate fees is easily explained, however. As mentioned above, after June\n29 the only remaining work to be done was defense work.\n       Further, even the district court’s interpretation of the supplemental\ndeclaration ignores its plain language.                The supplemental declaration\nestablishes fees incurred “for the time period of May 1, 2011 to June 24, 2011.”\n\n\n\n\n       2 That is not to say that the lion’s share of defensive costs were necessarily incurred\nduring that time. The cost of the defense work done during that period is a disputed question\nof fact. And, as will be seen later, we reject Aldous’s argument that Darwin must pay all\ncosts of prosecuting BAM’s affirmative claims to the extent the costs were “inextricably\nintertwined” with the defense. It does, however, vindicate Aldous’s position, taken early in\nthe coverage dispute, that the April 20th hearing, though ostensibly intended only to resolve\nBAM’s affirmative claims, would serve as the proving ground for BAM’s defense as well.\n                                              7\n\f     Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606         Page: 8     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\nWhen Aldous pointed out that the declaration was time-limited, the district\ncourt closed its ears and refused to consider the point. See id. at 566 (“The\npurpose of judicial estoppel, however, prevents Plaintiffs from taking positions\nsuch as this one.”).       As the district court saw it, judicial estoppel itself\nprecluded Aldous from explaining her prior position. It should go without\nsaying that judicial estoppel cannot be applied to the question of whether\njudicial estoppel applies. Aldous should have been permitted make arguments\nreconciling and harmonizing the declarations. 3\n       We also cannot condone the district court’s approach to the second aspect\nof judicial estoppel—whether the first court accepted the prior inconsistent\nposition. To find judicial estoppel applicable, the district court was required to\nfind that the prior court accepted $668,068.31 as BAM’s total costs on defense.\nInstead, the prior court issued a judgment “[t]hat BAM shall recover from Hill\nIII its reasonable costs and fees in defending against Hill III’s counterclaims\nin the amount of $2,586,560.11.” (Emphasis added.) As Aldous argues, this\nsingle sentence from the judgment demonstrates that judicial estoppel was\nimproper.\n       Nonetheless, the district court found that the “record clearly reflects the\ncourt’s acceptance of and reliance on Plaintiffs’ prior position in the Hill\nlawsuit.” Charla G. Aldous, P.C., 92 F.Supp.3d at 568. The evidence cited by\nthe district court does not show that the prior court accepted $668,068.31 as\n\n\n       3  The district court’s interpretation of the Loewinsohn Declarations requires the\nacceptance of a very unlikely fact—that BAM did not spend any resources defending against\nthe counterclaims until May 1, 2011, even though Hill filed the counterclaims on February\n15, 2011. The district court had an explanation: “Hill filed his counterclaims on February 15,\n2011, and Aldous provided notice of this counterclaim to Darwin on March 9, 2011. . . . Thus,\nLoewinsohn’s estimation that his work for defense occurred between May 1, 2011–June 24,\n2011, is not unreasonable, despite Plaintiffs attempt to make it appear so.” 92 F.Supp.3d at\n566–67. Without remarking on whether this reasoning is plausible, we note that it includes\na clear error of fact. Aldous provided notice of the counterclaims to Darwin on February 17,\n2011, a mere two days after Hill filed them.\n                                              8\n\f     Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606         Page: 9     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\nthe full measure of defense costs. It shows the parties agreed “to be bound by\n[the prior court’s] attorney’s fees determination” and “agreed that they would\nsubmit the issue of attorney’s fees to [a magistrate judge]; that they could\nappeal only to [a district court judge]; and that they would not request an\nadditional evidentiary hearing before [the district court judge].”                 Id.   The\nrelevance of this procedural background and summary of the parties’\nagreements is unclear.         What is clear is that the district court erred in\nassessing the evidence.\n       Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine concerned with “judicial\nacceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding [that] would create\nthe perception that either the first or the second court was misled.” Reed\nElsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.S. 154, 170, 130 S.Ct. 1237, 1249 (2010)\n(quoting New Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. at 750, 121 S.Ct. at 1815).\nNothing in the judgment issued by the prior court would suggest that Aldous\nshould not be permitted to claim defense costs in excess of $668,068.31.\nIndeed, the judgment suggests defense costs far outpacing that figure. Any\ninconsistency of rulings was confected when the district court estopped Aldous\nfrom claiming BAM’s costs on defense exceeded $668,068.31. We now undo\nthat error. 4\n\n\n\n       4  Darwin asserts that collateral estoppel also applies because “[t]he amount of fees\nand expenses reasonably incurred in the defense of the Fee Counterclaim that was submitted\nto Darwin for coverage was distinctly at issue in the Fee Lawsuit, was in fact litigated, and\nwas determined” in the prior proceedings. Darwin does not point us to the specific ruling it\nbelieves should be given preclusive effect, however. In the ordinary course, if collateral\nestoppel were appropriate, we would give preclusive effect to rulings deemed “necessary to\n[the] final judgment.” See Duffy & McGovern Accommodation Servs. v. QCI Marine Offshore,\nInc., 448 F.3d 825, 829 (5th Cir. 2006). Here, that would mean Aldous has already\nestablished “reasonable costs and fees in defending against Hill III’s counterclaims in the\namount of $2,586,560.11.” Any different prior-court ruling Darwin may have in mind was\nmanifestly not essential to the final judgment. Fortunately for Darwin, it is inappropriate to\napply collateral estoppel against a party who did not have a full and fair opportunity to\nlitigate the question. See Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 892, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 2171 (2008).\n                                              9\n\f     Case: 16-10537   Document: 00513914606      Page: 10   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-10537\n                             B.    Aldous’s Claims\n1.     Breach of Contract\n       The district court granted summary judgment on Aldous’s breach of\ncontract claim in part because Aldous had already received from Darwin\npayments in excess of its one-third share of $668,068.31 in defense costs. That\nlogic was predicated on the judicial estoppel ruling and no longer holds. But\nthe district court also granted summary judgment against Aldous for reasons\nbeyond the judicial estoppel ruling. Under the district court’s interpretation of\nthe contract, Darwin “did not breach the contract as a matter of law because\nthe terms of the Policy provide Defendant with discretion to determine\nreasonable claim expenses.” Charla G. Aldous, P.C., 92 F.Supp.3d at 569. We\ncannot agree.    Summary judgment should not have been granted against\nAldous on the breach of contract claim.\n       “Interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law,” meaning\nour review is de novo. Tesoro Ref. & Mktg. Co., L.L.C. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins.\nCo., 833 F.3d 470, 473 (5th Cir. 2016).       “Under Texas law, we interpret\ninsurance policies using the same rules of interpretation and construction\napplicable to contracts generally.” Id. at 474. The Policy contains a promise\nthat Darwin will pay “all” covered “Claim Expenses.”          Only “reasonable”\nexpenses qualify, however, and “[t]he determination by the insurer as to the\nreasonableness of Claim Expenses shall be conclusive on all Insureds.” The\ndistrict court interpreted these provisions to provide Darwin with a right to\ndecide how much it wants to pay. And there was no breach, according to the\ndistrict court, because Darwin merely exercised that right and did not do so\narbitrarily:\n       Darwin’s stated reasons for making the deductions demonstrate\n       that it did not arbitrarily make these deductions but rather made\n       a determination as to the reasonableness of the Claim Expenses,\n       as permitted by the Policy, according to reasonable considerations,\n                                       10\n\f   Case: 16-10537     Document: 00513914606         Page: 11     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 16-10537\n     such as its Billing Guidelines and the fact that it did not have a\n     duty to pay for attorney’s fees associated with BAM’s affirmative\n     claims.\nCharla G. Aldous, P.C., 92 F.Supp.3d at 571.\n      Aldous    contends    that     Darwin   never     made      a   reasonableness\ndetermination that should now be treated as binding and that the district\ncourt’s interpretation of the Policy renders the duty to defend illusory.\nAccording to Darwin, “the District court determined ‘as a matter of law’ that\nDarwin did not breach the Policy in making the reductions, because the Policy\ngave Darwin the right to do so,” such that “[e]vidence” of a reasonableness\ndetermination was “unnecessary.”         This is an accurate description of the\ndistrict court’s ruling, but it proves Aldous’s point. If the Policy provides\nDarwin with the unquestionable right to pay only to the extent it pleases, it is\nillusory. Accordingly, we agree with both aspects of Aldous’ argument.\n      Darwin’s right to make a binding determination regarding the\nreasonableness of Aldous’s claims would be implicated only if Darwin actually\nmade a reasonableness determination. Darwin disclaims any obligation to\nprovide evidence of reasonability and goes further still, asserting that\n“[e]vidence showing example of” the challenged “reductions was . . .\nunnecessary.”    Despite this questionable assertion, it assures us “[t]he\npleadings and evidence are replete with examples of Darwin’s ‘reasonableness’\ndeterminations.” From a record “replete” with examples, however, it gives us\nnone. Instead, it points us into legal thickets.\n      For example, Darwin asserts that its reliance on billing guidelines to\ncategorically   exclude    certain     expenses     represents    a   reasonableness\ndetermination and explains that “Darwin was clear from the beginning that its\nconsent to Loewinsohn as counsel . . . was conditioned upon ‘adherence to\nDarwin’s Billing and Reporting Guidelines.’” The “Billing Guidelines” are not\npart of the Policy, and Darwin informed Aldous of its intent to utilize them\n                                         11\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606          Page: 12     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\nonly in a reservation-of-rights letter. But “a unilateral reservation-of-rights\nletter cannot create rights not contained in the insurance policy.” Texas Ass’n\nof Cntys. Cnty. Gov’t Risk Mgmt. Pool v. Matagorda Cnty., 52 S.W.3d 128, 131\n(Tex. 2000).     The same is true of the Billing Guidelines themselves. As a\nmatter of basic contract law, an extra-contractual document—a document to\nwhich Aldous never agreed—cannot limit or define her rights under the Policy.\nBaylor Univ. v. Sonnichsen, 221 S.W.3d 632, 635 (Tex. 2007) (identifying\n“mutual assent” as a basic component of any contractual agreement); see also\nPhiladelphia Indem. Ins. Co. v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., Case No. 09 C 7063,\n2012 WL 2115487, at *5 (N.D. Ill. June 10, 2012) (rejecting an argument that\n“later-provided conditions can govern the amount to which an insured is\nentitled when those guidelines were not a part of the original insurance\ncontract.”).\n       Darwin also refers us to Aldous’s brief, which assertedly “describes and\ncites extensive evidence of reductions Darwin made to defense bills based on\nthe Billing Guidelines.”          Again, reliance on the Billing Guidelines is\nproblematic under the circumstances. 5 Further, survey of the evidence cited\nin Aldous’s brief suggests that Darwin’s reductions were in fact made\narbitrarily and even against the Darwin adjuster’s reasoned judgment.\n       In correspondence with Aldous, Darwin explained that it reached the\nproper sum by applying “Billing Guidelines” calling for certain relatively\nmodest deductions “off the top.” Far more significant was its next step—simply\ncutting the remaining claimed balance in half based on an assumption that\nhalf of the claimed costs were associated with prosecution of Aldous’\naffirmative claims and were therefore not covered.                  It made this “50/50\n\n\n       5In the ordinary case, where the insurer has selected and retained counsel, the Billing\nGuidelines may very well have a wholly different and perfectly appropriate application. But\nthey are not part of the agreement between the insurer and insured.\n                                             12\n\f     Case: 16-10537   Document: 00513914606     Page: 13   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-10537\nreduction” even though Aldous’s invoicing had already been adjusted to\neliminate costs related solely to the affirmative claims. Darwin’s own adjuster\ninitially opposed cutting Aldous’s claimed costs in this manner, saying such an\napproach “would be taking two bites at the apple and would be deducting likely\nmore than we should.” The adjuster was persuaded to fall into line not by\nDarwin officials asserting “reasonableness” but by the insurance companies\nrepresenting Blue and Malouf. The record shows that Travelers insurance\ncompany pressed the 50/50 reduction.        Further, the Travelers adjuster’s\nrationale had nothing to do with a reasonableness determination. Rather, the\nevidence indicates that Travelers was still bitter about Loewinsohn’s retention,\nreasoned “What’s the harm in trying?,” and “suspect[ed]” the insureds wouldn’t\n“quibble over a hundred thousand here or there.”\n       We do not opine on the general enforceability of the Policy provision at\nissue. We hold that it is simply not implicated on these facts, where there is\nno evidence that Darwin made any genuine determination as to the\nreasonableness of claimed fees and instead slashed the claimed defense costs\narbitrarily. As Aldous argues, under the circumstances, reading the Policy to\neffectively immunize Darwin from breach of contract claims would render the\ncontract illusory. See Evanston Ins. Co. v. ATOFINA Petrochemicals, Inc., 256\nS.W.3d 660, 669 (Tex. 2008) (“We cannot adopt a construction that renders any\nportion of a policy meaningless, useless, or inexplicable.”).    Darwin is not\nentitled to summary judgment on Aldous’s breach of contract claim. In ruling\notherwise, the district court erred.\n2.     Declaratory Judgment\n       Aldous seeks “a declaration that Darwin was required to pay all of\n[Loewinsohn’s] attorneys’ fees and costs that were inextricably intertwined\nwith her defense and pursuit of her affirmative claim.” In other words, though\nthe Policy covers only expenses related to the defense against Hill’s claims,\n                                       13\n\f    Case: 16-10537    Document: 00513914606       Page: 14   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                   No. 16-10537\nAldous seeks to recover fees related to the affirmative prosecution of her\naffirmative claims insofar as it can be said the work was “inextricably\nintertwined” with the defense. The problem with this argument is that there\nis absolutely no support for it.\n      As a federal court with diversity jurisdiction and an obligation to follow\nTexas law, innovation is verboten. Dean v. Dean, 821 F.2d 279, 284 (5th Cir.\n1987). No Texas court has ever held that the duty to defend includes the duty\nto pay legal fees incurred in the course of prosecuting affirmative claims that\nare inextricably intertwined with the defense. Relied upon by Aldous, Zurich\nAmerican Insurance Co. v. Nokia, Inc., explains that “[i]f a complaint\npotentially includes a covered claim, the insurer must defend the entire suit.”\n268 S.W.3d 487, 491 (Tex. 2008). The duty to defend the entire suit does not\ngive rise to a duty to prosecute claims helpful to or even inextricably\nintertwined with that defense, however. Aldous also points to Stewart Title\nGuaranty Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1 (Tex. 1991). Stewart Title is concerned\nwith the circumstances under which a plaintiff seeking attorney’s fees from a\nvanquished defendant may also recover attorney’s fees related to defending\nagainst that same defendant’s counterclaims—“when the attorney’s fees\nrendered are in connection with claims arising out of the same transaction and\nare so interrelated that their ‘prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of\nessentially the same facts.’” Id. at 11 (quoting Flint & Assocs. v. Intercont’l\nPipe & Steel, Inc., 739 S.W.2d 622, 624–25 (Tex. App. 1987)). The case has\nnothing to do with an insured’s duty to defend and does not support Aldous’\nnovel argument that the duty to defend may also include a duty to prosecute\nintegrally related affirmative claims.\n      Aldous cites no Policy language in support of her argument, which the\ndistrict court rightly viewed as an effort to rewrite the agreement.           See\nMustang Tractor & Equip. Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., Case No. CIV. A. H-91-\n                                         14\n\f     Case: 16-10537     Document: 00513914606         Page: 15    Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 16-10537\n2523, 1993 WL 566032, at *9 (S.D. Tex. Oct. 8, 1993), aff’d, 76 F.3d 89 (5th Cir.\n1996) (declining to extend an insurer’s duty to defend to cover prosecution of\ndefense-minded affirmative claims because, while “the duty to defend is\nexpansive,” all surveyed “cases uniformly hold that the duty is limited to cases\npotentially within the policy coverage”).            Aldous is not entitled to the\ndeclarations she seeks, and summary judgment was properly granted against\nher on these claims. Based on our rulings thus far, the proper measure of\ncovered defense costs remains an unsettled question of fact.\n3.     Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n       Aldous’s claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing did\nnot survive Darwin’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. For over\ntwenty years, the law in Texas has been clear that an insurer does not owe its\ninsured “a duty of good faith and fair dealing to investigate and defend claims\nby a third party against its insured.” 6 Maryland Ins. Co. v. Head Indus.\nCoatings & Servs., Inc., 938 S.W.2d 27, 27 (Tex. 1996). Nonetheless, Aldous\nasserts that a failure to provide the required defense may represent a breach\nof the duty of good faith and fair dealing. Consistent with Mid-Continent\nCasualty. Co. v. Eland Energy, Inc., 709 F.3d 515 (5th Cir. 2013), we reject that\nargument.\n       “Under Texas law, an insurer owes a duty of good faith in handling its\ninsured’s own claim of loss.” Med. Care Am., Inc. v. Nat’l Union Fire Ins. Co.,\n341 F.3d 415, 425 (5th Cir. 2003). But there is no common law duty of good\nfaith and fair dealing between an insurer and insured with respect to third-\n\n\n\n       6 Head Industrial has been partially superseded by statue as explained in Chickasha\nCotton Oil Co. v. Houston General Insurance Co. See Case No. 05-00-01789-CV, 2002 WL\n1792467, at *7 (Tex. App. 2002). “However, Head Industrial has not been overruled relative\nto an insured’s attempt to impose common-law, as opposed to statutory, duties on an insurer\nwith respect to settling third-party claims.” Methodist Hosp. v. Zurich Am. Ins. Co., 329\nS.W.3d 510, 517 n.6 (Tex. App. 2009).\n                                            15\n\f    Case: 16-10537    Document: 00513914606      Page: 16    Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-10537\nparty claims. Eland Energy, 709 F.3d at 520. The parties agree that the\nviability of the cause of action depends on whether Aldous’ claim is classified\nas a first-party claim or a third-party claim.\n       To identify the nature of the claim, it is proper to ask: When the insured\n“sought coverage” was it to cover its own loss or the loss of a third party? Id.\nat 520–21; see also Lamar Homes, Inc. v. Mid–Continent Cas. Co., 242 S.W.3d\n1, 17 (Tex. 2007) (“[A] first party claim is stated when ‘an insured seeks\nrecovery for the insured’s own loss,’ whereas a third-party claim is stated when\n‘an insured seeks coverage for injuries to a third party.’ ” (quoting Universe Life\nIns. Co. v. Giles, 950 S.W.2d 48, 54 n.2 (Tex. 1997))). Here, a third-party (Hill)\nallegedly suffered a loss and sued the insured (Aldous), who then sought\ncoverage from the insurer (Darwin). Viewed this way, this is not a claim\ninvolving the insured’s claim of loss, meaning there is no duty of good faith and\nfair dealing between the insurer and insured. See Eland Energy, 709 F.3d at\n520.\n       Aldous attempts to distinguish Eland Energy by creating two categories\nof duty-to-defend disputes. In the first batch, you have mishandled defenses,\nand Eland Energy fits into this category because there we held that the\nplaintiff failed to “show that Texas law recognizes a cause of action for an\ninsurer’s mishandling of third-party claims.” Id. at 520. In the second batch,\nyou have failure-to-pay cases, where the insurer did not pay for the defense as\nrequired by law. We cannot accept this distinction because Eland Energy’s\nholding is that the duty of good faith and fair dealing simply does not exist in\nthe present scenario. See id. It would be a strange duty if its existence\ndepended on whether or how it was violated.\n       Aldous’s argument, however, is not without force. For in Lamar Homes,\nat least for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act, the Supreme Court of Texas\nheld that “an insured’s claim for defense costs is a first-party claim because it\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606         Page: 17     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-10537\nconcerns a direct loss to the insured; that is, the claim does not belong to a\nthird party.” 242 S.W.3d at 17. Ultimately, we find Lamar Homes inapt.\n       Lamar Homes did not hold that a duty of good faith and fair dealing runs\nfrom insured to insurer in circumstances where the duty to defend was\ntriggered and the insurer failed to adequately cover the defense. Indeed, the\ncase had nothing to do with the duty of good faith and fair dealing and\nconcerned statutory, rather than common law, duties. It would be odd if a\nruling on the Prompt Payment Act dramatically affected the common law\nduties of insurers. Lamar Homes, 242 S.W.3d at 16 (describing the issue\npresented as “whether the ‘Prompt Payment of Claims’ statute . . . applies to\nan insurer’s breach of the duty to defend”). It would be odder still if the catalyst\nfor that change in the law was the Texas legislature’s decision to add the term\n“first-party claim” to the Prompt Payment Act.               See id. at 24 (Brister, J.\ndissenting) (noting the addition of the phrase in 1991).\n       Notably, Aldous has pointed to no Texas courts interpreting Lamar\nHomes to revise the common law duties of insurers in the manner for which\nshe advocates. Most courts that have considered the possibility have rejected\nit. 7 Further, under Aldous’s view, the duty of good faith and fair dealing only\nexists (and is violated) when the duty to defend has also been breached. In\nrejecting this theory, we follow the Supreme Court of Texas’ pertinent\ninstructions. See Head Industrial, 938 S.W.2d at 28–29 (“[A]n insured is fully\n\n\n\n\n       7 See Allied World Specialty Ins. Co. v. Freese & Goss, PLLC, Case No. 3:15-CV-02792-\nN, 2016 WL 6581922, at *3 (N.D.

Aldous’s Remaining Claims\n       Aldous’s claims based on the Texas Insurance Code and Deceptive Trade\nPractices Act are barred as a matter of law under Parkans International LLC\nv. Zurich Ins. Co., 299 F.3d 514 (5th Cir. 2002). Under Parkans, “[t]here can\nbe no recovery for extra-contractual damages for mishandling claims unless\nthe complained of actions or omissions caused injury independent of those that\nwould have resulted from a wrongful denial of policy benefits.” Id. at 519. We\nare not at liberty to second-guess this ruling.         See Jacobs v. Nat’l Drug\nIntelligence Ctr., 548 F.3d 375, 378 (5th Cir. 2008).\n                              C.    Darwin’s Claims\n1.     Money Had and Received/Equitable Reimbursement\n       In light of our judicial estoppel ruling, the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on Darwin’s claim for money had and received cannot\nstand. Aldous argues that judgment was improper for another reason: under\nTexas law, an insurer has no right of equitable reimbursement against its\ninsured. For the reasons that follow, as a federal court exercising diversity\njurisdiction, we cannot endorse the district court’s recognition of an insurer’s\npreviously unannounced equitable right of recovery against its insured.\n       In the words of the district court, an insurer “is entitled to recover to the\nextent it made overpayments,” and overpayments are payments made but not\nactually required “under the insurance contract.”         Aldous v. Darwin Nat.\nAssur. Co., Case No. 3:13-CV-3310-L, 2015 WL 1879677, at *5 (N.D. Tex. Apr.\n24, 2015). Under this approach, an insurer that makes payments under a\npolicy while coverage is disputed can sue its insured, claiming a right to\nequitable reimbursement if the coverage dispute is resolved in its favor. And,\n\n\n                                        18\n\f   Case: 16-10537     Document: 00513914606      Page: 19   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-10537\nbecause the claim is equitable in nature, the insurer need not point to any\npolicy provision granting the right. Rather, the right exists by default.\n       Under Texas law, if an insurance company disputes coverage with its\ninsured but nonetheless settles the action on the insured’s behalf, there is no\nright to equitable reimbursement if the third party’s claims are later\ndetermined to be uncovered by the policy. Matagorda County, 52 S.W.3d at\n135.   This is true even where the insurer has provided coverage under a\nreservation of rights. Id. at 131. But nothing stops insurers from including a\nright to reimbursement in its Policy or obtaining “the insured’s clear and\nunequivocal consent to the settlement and the insurer’s right to seek\nreimbursement.” Id. at 135. The Supreme Court of Texas later described\nMatagorda County broadly, as a case “declining to recognize an implied-in-fact,\nan implied-in-law, or an equitable reimbursement right outside of the\ninsurance policy’s provisions.”    Excess Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London v.\nFrank’s Casing Crew & Rental Tools, Inc., 246 S.W.3d 42, 45 (Tex. 2008).\n       Under the broad reading of Matagorda County suggested by Frank’s\nCasing, Darwin has no equitable reimbursement right outside of the insurance\npolicy’s provisions. Both of those cases, however, apply where an insurer\n“settles a claim against its insured when coverage is disputed.” See id. at 43.\nAnd much of their reasoning is specifically tailored to that scenario. See id. at\n46. (“Our analysis in Matagorda County highlighted the dilemma faced by both\ninsurer and insured when a claimant presents a settlement demand within\npolicy limits and coverage is uncertain.”). Thus, those cases strongly suggest\n(but do not necessarily dictate) that insurers have no right to equitable\nreimbursement of costs expended in defending an insured where coverage\nexists but the scope of the duty to defend is disputed and later resolved in favor\nof the insurer. See Am. Int’l Specialty Lines Ins. Co. v. Rentech Steel LLC, 620\nF.3d 558, 564 (5th Cir. 2010) (“In making our Erie guess, we look first to those\n                                       19\n\f    Case: 16-10537     Document: 00513914606     Page: 20    Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-10537\nTexas Supreme Court cases that, while not deciding the issue, provide\nguidance as to how the Texas Supreme Court would decide the question before\nus.”).\n         The district court did not give due regard to Frank’s Casing and\nMatagorda County. Moreover, instead of basing its decision on Texas law, the\ndistrict court relied primarily on Fifth Circuit cases that were not applying\nTexas law. See Charla G. Aldous, P.C., 92 F.Supp.3d at 573 (relying on United\nStates v. St. Bernard Par., 756 F.2d 1116, 1127 (5th Cir. 1985) (applying federal\nlaw), Peavey Co. v. M/V ANPA, 971 F.2d 1168, 1176 (5th Cir. 1992) (applying\nLouisiana law), and Adams v. Unione Mediterranea Di Sicurta, 364 F.3d 646,\n656 (5th Cir. 2004) (applying federal admiralty and maritime law).              Its\nsubsequent “Supplemental Memorandum Opinion and Order” further reveals\nthat the district court’s ruling lacked a basis in Texas law. The district court\nrecognized that federal courts have permitted “restitution for overpayment as\na means of recovery under ERISA” and concluded that, “[b]y analogy, the\nreasons for allowing recovery for overpayments in the context of ERISA are\napplicable to the court’s decision today, as the concerns also pertain to\ncontracts for liability insurance.” See Aldous, 2015 WL 1879677, at *5. Federal\ncourts are not to make state law, and certainly not “by analogy” to federal law.\nSee Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 69, 58 S.Ct. 817, 818 (1938) (“There\nis no federal general common law.            Congress has no power to declare\nsubstantive rules of common law applicable in a state . . . . And no clause in\nthe Constitution purports to confer such a power upon the federal courts.”).\n         The district court’s Supplemental Memorandum Opinion and Order also\nincluded citations to Texas cases.      While the district court sharpened its\nanalytical focus, the cases cited do not support its conclusion. The district court\nrelied on Fortune Production Co. v. Conoco, Inc., 52 S.W.3d 671 (Tex. 2000),\nand Southwest Electric Power Co. v. Burlington Northern R.R. Co., 966 S.W.2d\n                                        20\n\f   Case: 16-10537      Document: 00513914606    Page: 21   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-10537\n467 (Tex. 1998). We reject application of those cases for the simple reason that\nthey do not involve contracts for insurance. See Miga v. Jensen, 299 S.W.3d\n98, 103 (Tex. 2009).\n      As plaintiff, Dennis Miga had initially been very successful in litigation\nagainst Ronald Jensen, securing a judgment in excess of $20 million that was\nlargely upheld on appeal. Id. at 100. Because interest was accruing at an\nalarming rate, Jensen paid the judgment just prior to filing a petition for\nreview with the Supreme Court of Texas. Id. Texas’ highest court then sided\nwith Jensen on the merits, again rendering judgment in favor of Miga but in\nan amount just over $1 million. Id. at 101. Miga took the position that the\nreversal had no financial consequences and denied any obligation to repay the\n$21,560,150.67 he had received beyond the proper, adjusted judgment amount.\nId. Jensen then filed suit for restitution, and the case again wound up before\nthe Supreme Court of Texas, which applied the “restitution-after-reversal rule”\nand held in Jensen’s favor. Id. at 101–02.\n      Miga argued that Frank’s Casing (which the Supreme Court of Texas\ndescribed broadly as a case “in which we declined to recognize an equitable\nright of reimbursement”) should apply and bar Jensen’s claim. The argument\nwas rejected:\n       This case involves restitution upon reversal of a judgment, not\n       insurers seeking restitution from an insured on a third-party\n       claim, against the backdrop of a highly regulated industry. . . .\n       Restitution in insurance-related cases involves policy concerns not\n       present here:\n             [D]isputes between insurers and policyholders over the\n             insurer’s duty to pay a claim, or to settle or defend a claim\n             brought against the policyholder, present special difficulties\n             for the law of restitution, because the insurer’s duty to\n             indemnify and defend is subject to extensive regulation\n             under local law.\nId. (quoting Restatement (Third) § 35, cmt. c. (Tentative Draft No. 3, 2004)).\n\n                                      21\n\f     Case: 16-10537      Document: 00513914606         Page: 22     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-10537\n       Miga suggests that an “equitable right to reimbursement” does not exist\nat all in the context of insurance cases. It shows that recognition of such a\nright would be only proper after a thorough and conscientious review of Texas’\nregulatory scheme in light of the unique “policy concerns” implicated. And it\nfirmly establishes that we cannot look to generic contract cases when trying to\nidentify equitable rights of insurers against their insureds.\n       In light of Matagorda County, Frank’s Casing, Miga, and our constrained\nrole, our obligation is clear. We have been asked to recognize, as a matter of\nTexas law, an insurer’s right to equitable reimbursement for “overpayments”\nof defense costs. But “it is not for us to adopt innovative theories of recovery\nfor Texas law.” Dean, 821 F.2d at 284. Summary judgment should have been\ngranted in favor of Aldous with respect to Darwin’s claims for equitable\nreimbursement (however denominated). 8\n2.     Breach of Contract\n       Darwin also seeks the return of money that was not overpaid but that\nwas properly paid. Darwin believes the legal fees Hill paid directly to Aldous\nshould have instead been paid directly to Darwin, at least in a measure\ncommensurate with the legal fees Darwin spent on Aldous’s behalf. This\nscenario seems ready-made for subrogation. See Fortis Benefits v. Cantu, 234\nS.W.3d 642, 645 (Tex. 2007) (explaining how subrogation rights “prevent the\ninsured from receiving a double recovery, first from the insurer, then from the\nthird party”). Darwin paid at least some measure of Aldous’s legal fees, and\nAldous then recovered legal fees from Hill. Understandably, Darwin thinks it\nis entitled to some of the money paid by Hill. 9\n\n\n\n       8 Based on this holding, we do not need to reach Aldous’s argument that the district\ncourt misapplied the law relating to claims for money had and received.\n       9 Aldous contends that allegations of a windfall recovery are “repudiated by the\n\nevidence” because she “invested over $1.1 million of her own resources” in prevailing against\n                                             22\n\f    Case: 16-10537      Document: 00513914606        Page: 23    Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 16-10537\n         For whatever reason, however, Darwin did not seek subrogation against\nHill. That is, it did not intervene in the prior litigation, step into the shoes of\nAldous, and assert (for its own benefit) Aldous’s right to attorney’s fees against\nHill. Darwin concedes that it cannot assert subrogation rights against Aldous,\nits own insured. This result follows from the very nature of subrogation rights.\nAs a “purely conceptual” matter, an insurer cannot be subrogated against “an\ninsured because an insurer who seeks subrogation stands in the shoes of the\ninsured.” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Perkins, 216 S.W.3d 396, 401 (Tex.\nApp. 2006). “Because a person cannot sue himself for damages, that person’s\ninsurer, who stands in the person’s shoes for subrogation purposes, cannot sue\nthe person either.” Id.\n         According to Darwin, this analysis misses the point.             Darwin isn’t\nseeking to assert subrogation rights.           Rather, Darwin is alleging Aldous\nviolated the terms of the Policy—ordinary breach of contract. Thus, Darwin\nargues it “had a subrogation right against Hill as a result of its payments on\nAldous’ behalf, and Aldous impaired Darwin’s subrogation rights by\nsuccessfully suing Hill for money paid by Darwin that Aldous recovered and\nthen withheld.” Or, as stated in the reply brief, “Darwin had the right to step\ninto Aldous’ shoes to recover the defense fees it paid against Hill, but is not\nattempting to do so in this lawsuit because Aldous prevented it from doing so.”\nThus, with its contract claim, Darwin is attempting to belatedly achieve the\nsame ends it should have achieved through subrogation. Its labored argument\nfails.\n         The relevant Policy provision provides:\n         The Insurer shall be subrogated to all Insureds’ rights of\n         recovery against any person or organization. All Insureds shall\n\n\nHill. In deciding this appeal, we need not determine whether she stands to double-recover\nor whether such a result would be permissible in this case.\n                                           23\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606          Page: 24     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\n       assist the Insurer in effecting any rights of indemnity,\n       contribution and apportionment available to any Insured,\n       including the execution of such documents as are necessary to\n       enable the Insurer to pursue claims in the Insureds’ names and\n       shall provide all other assistance and cooperation which the\n       Insurer may reasonably require. All Insureds shall cooperate\n       with the Insurer and do nothing to jeopardize, prejudice or\n       terminate in any way such rights.\n             The Insurer shall not exercise any such rights against any\n       Insureds except as provided herein. Notwithstanding the\n       foregoing, however, the Insurer reserves the right to exercise any\n       rights of subrogation against any Insured with respect to any\n       Claim brought about or contributed to by the intentional,\n       criminal, fraudulent, malicious or dishonest act or omission of such\n       Insured.\n       The Policy provides Darwin with subrogation rights, but Aldous did not\nbreach the Policy by seeking attorney’s fees against Hill. Indeed, she arguably\nassisted Darwin, who could have benefited from the adjudication. 10 Darwin\nshould have asserted its subrogation rights against Hill.                 See, e.g., Fortis\nBenefits, 234 S.W.3d at 648; Ortiz v. Great S. Fire & Cas. Ins. Co., 597 S.W.2d\n342, 343 (Tex. 1980). Instead, it sat on its rights and, after being sued, brought\nclaims directly against its insured. As the district court stated, “[Darwin]\nprovides no case law to support a conclusion that receiving a judgment for\nattorney’s fees is tantamount to jeopardizing, prejudicing, or terminating\nDarwin’s subrogation rights.” 11 Aldous, 2015 WL 1879677, at *2.\n\n\n\n       10If anything, Darwin’s inaction is problematic. See Ortiz v. Great S. Fire & Cas. Ins.\nCo., 597 S.W.2d 342, 344 (Tex. 1980) (“[W]hen an insurer does not assist in the collection of\ndamages from the third party tortfeasor, it must pay its share of the costs and expenses\nincurred in obtaining recovery from the third party, including attorney fees.”).\n       11 In Fortis Benefits, the insurance policy at issue included a “Right of\n\nReimbursement,” which provided, in pertinent part: “If benefits are paid under this plan, and\nany Covered Person recovers against any person or organization by settlement, judgment or\notherwise, We have a right to recover from that Covered Person an amount equal to the\namount We have paid.” Fortis Benefits, 234 S.W.3d at 645 n.11. Darwin has not claimed any\ncontractual right to reimbursement and yet essentially seeks the same end. “[I]nsurers are\nwell equipped to evaluate and reduce risk by, for example, ‘drafting policies to specifically\n                                             24\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606        Page: 25     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\n                                 IV.    CONCLUSION\n       The district court’s judgment is REVERSED and, with respect to\nDarwin’s breach of contract and equitable claims, ruled in favor of Aldous. The\ncase is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\nprovide for reimbursement,’” and we will not rewrite the contract to grant Darwin rights\nbeyond those it included in the contract.

Appellant Charla Aldous is one of those\nattorneys, and she prevailed against her erstwhile client. In addition to\nestablishing an entitlement to significant attorney’s fees, Aldous and her\ncohort also successfully defended against breach of contract and professional\nnegligence claims, among others. Hill’s claims against the attorneys triggered\ninsurance coverage provided by appellee Darwin National Assurance, Co.,\nAldous’s insurer. And now, in this third layer of litigation, we confront the\n\f    Case: 16-10537    Document: 00513914606     Page: 2   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-10537\nresulting coverage dispute. Aldous claims Darwin did not pay enough to fully\ncover the costs of her defense. Darwin asserts it paid too much.\n      This case was decided in favor of Darwin on summary judgment. In a\nruling that effectively doomed Aldous’s claims, the district court ruled she was\njudicially estopped from claiming defense costs in excess of $668,068.38.\nBuilding on this ruling, the district court further found that Darwin was\nentitled to recover “overpayments” on an equitable “money had and received”\ntheory. Aldous appealed.\n      In addition to issues raised by the district court’s summary judgment\nruling, we are also called upon to decide whether the district court erred in\npartially granting a motion to dismiss brought by Darwin. Lastly, Darwin has\nfiled a cross-appeal, contending that judgment should not have been granted\nin favor of Aldous with respect to a breach of contract claim.\n                            I.    BACKGROUND\n      Along with Lisa Blue and Steve Malouf, Aldous represented Hill in\nlitigation that resulted in a judgment for their client valued at $114,745,870.\n(The association of lawyers Blue, Aldous, and Malouf are hereinafter referred\nto as “BAM.”) BAM represented Hill on a contingency basis, but Hill did not\nwant to pay. Litigation ensued. After BAM sued Hill, Hill counterclaimed,\nalleging breach of fiduciary duty, duress, breach of oral contract, fraud, and\nprofessional negligence.\n      Aldous had a valid professional liability insurance policy through\nDarwin (the “Policy”), and Hill’s counterclaims triggered coverage. Blue and\nMalouf were also covered under separate policies through separate insurers.\nBAM had already retained Alan Loewinsohn to represent its affirmative claims\nagainst Hill and requested that the insurers allow Loewinsohn to handle the\ndefense as well. The insurers relented.      The various parties agreed (and\ncontinue to agree) that Darwin is responsible only for one-third of the covered\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 16-10537    Document: 00513914606     Page: 3   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                 No. 16-10537\ncosts of defense; Blue and Malouf (or their insurers) were separately\nresponsible for their one-third shares.\n      BAM ultimately prevailed against Hill, securing an award of\n$21,942,961 in earned attorney’s fees (offset by $691,175.93), costs of\n$479,595.67, and the “reasonable costs and fees in defending against Hill III’s\ncounterclaims in the amount of $2,586,560.11.” By the time judgment was\nentered, Aldous and Darwin were already embroiled in this coverage dispute.\n      Aldous filed this suit in Texas state court, and it was removed to federal\ncourt on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. As relevant here, Aldous alleged\nbreach of contract, breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing, violations\nof the Texas Insurance Code, and violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade\nPractices Act. She also sought a declaratory judgment that Darwin is liable\nfor the costs associated with the prosecution of her affirmative claims against\nHill to the extent those affirmative claims were inextricably intertwined with\nher defense. Darwin counterclaimed, alleging (among other things) breach of\ncontract, unjust enrichment, and money had and received. The district court\npartially granted a Rule 12(b)(6) motion filed by Darwin, dismissing Aldous’\nbreach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing claim, as well as a Texas\nInsurance Code § 541 claim and the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act claim.\nSubsequently, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n      On summary judgment, the district court ruled largely in favor of\nDarwin. In a ruling with major consequences, the district court ruled that\nAldous was judicially estopped from claiming that the costs in defending\nagainst Hill’s counterclaims exceeded $668,068.38. This ruling meant that\nDarwin’s coverage obligations were limited to $222,689.44—one-third of the\ntotal cost to defend. Darwin had paid Aldous far more than that, $502,364.59.\nBased on this ruling, Aldous’ breach of contract claim necessarily failed. The\njudicial estoppel ruling also meant that Darwin had overpaid, and the district\n                                          3\n\f    Case: 16-10537     Document: 00513914606         Page: 4   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-10537\ncourt ruled that Darwin could recover this overpayment through an action for\nmoney had and received. The district court further ruled that Aldous was not\nentitled to costs related to the prosecution of her affirmative claims against\nHill, even if she could show those affirmative claims were inextricably\nintertwined with her defense against Hill’s counterclaims. And, as clarified in\na subsequent order, the district court granted summary judgment against\nDarwin with respect to its breach of contract counterclaim, reasoning that the\nanti-subrogation rule prevented it from asserting subrogation rights against\nits own insured.\n                        II.

The parties stipulated that these attorney’s fees could be\nestablished through declarations, and BAM’s attorney filed a series of relevant\ndeclarations (the “Loewinsohn Declarations”). The first of the declarations\nmakes it plain that BAM did not claim its costs of defense were limited to\n$668,068.31.    Therein, Loewinsohn asserted legal fees of $2,054,178.18,\nincluding both affirmative and defensive claims. He expressly declared that\nthe “fees and expenses can all be allocated either to the prosecution of BAM’s\nbreach of contract claim or to the defense of the counterclaims and affirmative\ndefenses asserted by the Hills, which was necessary in BAM’s prosecution of\ntheir claim, or both.”\n      That first declaration was filed on April 29, 2011. After that day, the\nrest of the litigation concerned only Hill’s counterclaims. On June 29, 2011,\nLoewinsohn submitted a “supplemental declaration” that further testified that\n“for the time period of May 1, 2011 to June 24, 2011, for the defense of the\nCounterclaims,” $668,068.31 had been reasonably expended.                Then, on\nJanuary 9, 2012, he submitted a “second supplemental declaration” which\n“incorporated by reference” the first and reiterated his opinion “that an\nattorney’s fee, including expenses, of $668,068.31 was a reasonable and\nnecessary fee for the defense of the Counterclaims.”       As can be readily seen,\nmere recitation of the Loewinsohn Declarations establishes that Aldous never\nclaimed that defense costs totaled $668,068.31. Rather, the fees incurred after\nApril 29 totaled $668,068.31 and were purely defense-related.\n      Two other notable facts emerge from the declarations and a review of the\nprior proceedings. First, the reason that fees incurred after April 29 related\nsolely to defending against Hill’s claims is that BAM’s affirmative claims had\nalready been litigated.      An evidentiary hearing commencing April 20th\n                                        6\n\f     Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606         Page: 7     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\nresolved those claims. Second, the lion’s share of dispositive defense work was\ndone prior to April 29, as shown by the judge’s ruling that, with one exception,\nall of Hill’s counterclaims “were legally barred based on her prior rulings”\nstemming from the April 20 hearing. 2\n       The district court’s ruling contains several errors. Most fundamentally,\nthe district court unjustifiably read the supplemental declaration in isolation.\nIt took as Aldous’s binding position that defense costs in the prior proceeding\nwere incurred only between May 1 and June 24 and that those costs totaled\n$668,068.31. To make this large error, the district court was required to make\nsmall antecedent errors.\n       For example, the district court refused to credit Aldous’s argument that\nthe first declaration did not segregate fees and therefore included costs related\nto defending against Hill. In the district court’s view, this argument was\nundercut by the fact that “Loewinsohn segregate[d] the fees associated with\nthe affirmative and defensive claims in his supplemental and second\nsupplemental declaration.” Charla G. Aldous, P.C. v. Darwin Nat. Assur. Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 566 (N.D. Tex. 2015). Loewinsohn’s newfound ability to\nsegregate fees is easily explained, however. As mentioned above, after June\n29 the only remaining work to be done was defense work.\n       Further, even the district court’s interpretation of the supplemental\ndeclaration ignores its plain language.                The supplemental declaration\nestablishes fees incurred “for the time period of May 1, 2011 to June 24, 2011.”\n\n\n\n\n       2 That is not to say that the lion’s share of defensive costs were necessarily incurred\nduring that time. The cost of the defense work done during that period is a disputed question\nof fact. And, as will be seen later, we reject Aldous’s argument that Darwin must pay all\ncosts of prosecuting BAM’s affirmative claims to the extent the costs were “inextricably\nintertwined” with the defense. It does, however, vindicate Aldous’s position, taken early in\nthe coverage dispute, that the April 20th hearing, though ostensibly intended only to resolve\nBAM’s affirmative claims, would serve as the proving ground for BAM’s defense as well.\n                                              7\n\f     Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606         Page: 8     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\nWhen Aldous pointed out that the declaration was time-limited, the district\ncourt closed its ears and refused to consider the point. See id. at 566 (“The\npurpose of judicial estoppel, however, prevents Plaintiffs from taking positions\nsuch as this one.”).       As the district court saw it, judicial estoppel itself\nprecluded Aldous from explaining her prior position. It should go without\nsaying that judicial estoppel cannot be applied to the question of whether\njudicial estoppel applies. Aldous should have been permitted make arguments\nreconciling and harmonizing the declarations. 3\n       We also cannot condone the district court’s approach to the second aspect\nof judicial estoppel—whether the first court accepted the prior inconsistent\nposition. To find judicial estoppel applicable, the district court was required to\nfind that the prior court accepted $668,068.31 as BAM’s total costs on defense.\nInstead, the prior court issued a judgment “[t]hat BAM shall recover from Hill\nIII its reasonable costs and fees in defending against Hill III’s counterclaims\nin the amount of $2,586,560.11.” (Emphasis added.) As Aldous argues, this\nsingle sentence from the judgment demonstrates that judicial estoppel was\nimproper.\n       Nonetheless, the district court found that the “record clearly reflects the\ncourt’s acceptance of and reliance on Plaintiffs’ prior position in the Hill\nlawsuit.” Charla G. Aldous, P.C., 92 F.Supp.3d at 568. The evidence cited by\nthe district court does not show that the prior court accepted $668,068.31 as\n\n\n       3  The district court’s interpretation of the Loewinsohn Declarations requires the\nacceptance of a very unlikely fact—that BAM did not spend any resources defending against\nthe counterclaims until May 1, 2011, even though Hill filed the counterclaims on February\n15, 2011. The district court had an explanation: “Hill filed his counterclaims on February 15,\n2011, and Aldous provided notice of this counterclaim to Darwin on March 9, 2011. . . . Thus,\nLoewinsohn’s estimation that his work for defense occurred between May 1, 2011–June 24,\n2011, is not unreasonable, despite Plaintiffs attempt to make it appear so.” 92 F.Supp.3d at\n566–67. Without remarking on whether this reasoning is plausible, we note that it includes\na clear error of fact. Aldous provided notice of the counterclaims to Darwin on February 17,\n2011, a mere two days after Hill filed them.\n                                              8\n\f     Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606         Page: 9     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\nthe full measure of defense costs. It shows the parties agreed “to be bound by\n[the prior court’s] attorney’s fees determination” and “agreed that they would\nsubmit the issue of attorney’s fees to [a magistrate judge]; that they could\nappeal only to [a district court judge]; and that they would not request an\nadditional evidentiary hearing before [the district court judge].”                 Id.   The\nrelevance of this procedural background and summary of the parties’\nagreements is unclear.         What is clear is that the district court erred in\nassessing the evidence.\n       Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine concerned with “judicial\nacceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding [that] would create\nthe perception that either the first or the second court was misled.” Reed\nElsevier, Inc. v.

Any\ninconsistency of rulings was confected when the district court estopped Aldous\nfrom claiming BAM’s costs on defense exceeded $668,068.31. We now undo\nthat error. 4\n\n\n\n       4  Darwin asserts that collateral estoppel also applies because “[t]he amount of fees\nand expenses reasonably incurred in the defense of the Fee Counterclaim that was submitted\nto Darwin for coverage was distinctly at issue in the Fee Lawsuit, was in fact litigated, and\nwas determined” in the prior proceedings. Darwin does not point us to the specific ruling it\nbelieves should be given preclusive effect, however. In the ordinary course, if collateral\nestoppel were appropriate, we would give preclusive effect to rulings deemed “necessary to\n[the] final judgment.” See Duffy & McGovern Accommodation Servs. v. QCI Marine Offshore,\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"42642\"><a href=\"/opinion/42642/duffy-mcgovern-svc-v-qci-mrne-offshr-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 829 (5th Cir. 2006). Here, that would mean Aldous has already\nestablished “reasonable costs and fees in defending against Hill III’s counterclaims in the\namount of $2,586,560.11.” Any different prior-court ruling Darwin may have in mind was\nmanifestly not essential to the final judgment. Fortunately for Darwin, it is inappropriate to\napply collateral estoppel against a party who did not have a full and fair opportunity to\nlitigate the question. See Taylor v.

Aldous’s Claims\n1.     Breach of Contract\n       The district court granted summary judgment on Aldous’s breach of\ncontract claim in part because Aldous had already received from Darwin\npayments in excess of its one-third share of $668,068.31 in defense costs. That\nlogic was predicated on the judicial estoppel ruling and no longer holds. But\nthe district court also granted summary judgment against Aldous for reasons\nbeyond the judicial estoppel ruling. Under the district court’s interpretation of\nthe contract, Darwin “did not breach the contract as a matter of law because\nthe terms of the Policy provide Defendant with discretion to determine\nreasonable claim expenses.” Charla G. Aldous, P.C., 92 F.Supp.3d at 569. We\ncannot agree.    Summary judgment should not have been granted against\nAldous on the breach of contract claim.\n       “Interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law,” meaning\nour review is de novo.

The Policy contains a promise\nthat Darwin will pay “all” covered “Claim Expenses.”          Only “reasonable”\nexpenses qualify, however, and “[t]he determination by the insurer as to the\nreasonableness of Claim Expenses shall be conclusive on all Insureds.” The\ndistrict court interpreted these provisions to provide Darwin with a right to\ndecide how much it wants to pay. And there was no breach, according to the\ndistrict court, because Darwin merely exercised that right and did not do so\narbitrarily:\n       Darwin’s stated reasons for making the deductions demonstrate\n       that it did not arbitrarily make these deductions but rather made\n       a determination as to the reasonableness of the Claim Expenses,\n       as permitted by the Policy, according to reasonable considerations,\n                                       10\n\f   Case: 16-10537     Document: 00513914606         Page: 11     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                     No. 16-10537\n     such as its Billing Guidelines and the fact that it did not have a\n     duty to pay for attorney’s fees associated with BAM’s affirmative\n     claims.\nCharla G. Aldous, P.C., 92 F.Supp.3d at 571.\n      Aldous    contends    that     Darwin   never     made      a   reasonableness\ndetermination that should now be treated as binding and that the district\ncourt’s interpretation of the Policy renders the duty to defend illusory.\nAccording to Darwin, “the District court determined ‘as a matter of law’ that\nDarwin did not breach the Policy in making the reductions, because the Policy\ngave Darwin the right to do so,” such that “[e]vidence” of a reasonableness\ndetermination was “unnecessary.”         This is an accurate description of the\ndistrict court’s ruling, but it proves Aldous’s point. If the Policy provides\nDarwin with the unquestionable right to pay only to the extent it pleases, it is\nillusory. Accordingly, we agree with both aspects of Aldous’ argument.\n      Darwin’s right to make a binding determination regarding the\nreasonableness of Aldous’s claims would be implicated only if Darwin actually\nmade a reasonableness determination. Darwin disclaims any obligation to\nprovide evidence of reasonability and goes further still, asserting that\n“[e]vidence showing example of” the challenged “reductions was . . .\nunnecessary.”    Despite this questionable assertion, it assures us “[t]he\npleadings and evidence are replete with examples of Darwin’s ‘reasonableness’\ndeterminations.” From a record “replete” with examples, however, it gives us\nnone. Instead, it points us into legal thickets.\n      For example, Darwin asserts that its reliance on billing guidelines to\ncategorically   exclude    certain     expenses     represents    a   reasonableness\ndetermination and explains that “Darwin was clear from the beginning that its\nconsent to Loewinsohn as counsel . . . was conditioned upon ‘adherence to\nDarwin’s Billing and Reporting Guidelines.’” The “Billing Guidelines” are not\npart of the Policy, and Darwin informed Aldous of its intent to utilize them\n                                         11\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606          Page: 12     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\nonly in a reservation-of-rights letter.

Darwin’s own adjuster\ninitially opposed cutting Aldous’s claimed costs in this manner, saying such an\napproach “would be taking two bites at the apple and would be deducting likely\nmore than we should.” The adjuster was persuaded to fall into line not by\nDarwin officials asserting “reasonableness” but by the insurance companies\nrepresenting Blue and Malouf. The record shows that Travelers insurance\ncompany pressed the 50/50 reduction.        Further, the Travelers adjuster’s\nrationale had nothing to do with a reasonableness determination. Rather, the\nevidence indicates that Travelers was still bitter about Loewinsohn’s retention,\nreasoned “What’s the harm in trying?,” and “suspect[ed]” the insureds wouldn’t\n“quibble over a hundred thousand here or there.”\n       We do not opine on the general enforceability of the Policy provision at\nissue. We hold that it is simply not implicated on these facts, where there is\nno evidence that Darwin made any genuine determination as to the\nreasonableness of claimed fees and instead slashed the claimed defense costs\narbitrarily. As Aldous argues, under the circumstances, reading the Policy to\neffectively immunize Darwin from breach of contract claims would render the\ncontract illusory. See Evanston Ins. Co. v.

Breach of the Duty of Good Faith and Fair Dealing\n       Aldous’s claim for breach of the duty of good faith and fair dealing did\nnot survive Darwin’s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.

Eland Energy, 709 F.3d at 520. The parties agree that the\nviability of the cause of action depends on whether Aldous’ claim is classified\nas a first-party claim or a third-party claim.\n       To identify the nature of the claim, it is proper to ask: When the insured\n“sought coverage” was it to cover its own loss or the loss of a third party? Id.\nat 520–21; see also Lamar Homes, Inc. v. Mid–Continent Cas.

Here, a third-party (Hill)\nallegedly suffered a loss and sued the insured (Aldous), who then sought\ncoverage from the insurer (Darwin). Viewed this way, this is not a claim\ninvolving the insured’s claim of loss, meaning there is no duty of good faith and\nfair dealing between the insurer and insured. See Eland Energy, 709 F.3d at\n520.\n       Aldous attempts to distinguish Eland Energy by creating two categories\nof duty-to-defend disputes. In the first batch, you have mishandled defenses,\nand Eland Energy fits into this category because there we held that the\nplaintiff failed to “show that Texas law recognizes a cause of action for an\ninsurer’s mishandling of third-party claims.” Id. at 520. In the second batch,\nyou have failure-to-pay cases, where the insurer did not pay for the defense as\nrequired by law. We cannot accept this distinction because Eland Energy’s\nholding is that the duty of good faith and fair dealing simply does not exist in\nthe present scenario. See id. It would be a strange duty if its existence\ndepended on whether or how it was violated.\n       Aldous’s argument, however, is not without force. For in Lamar Homes,\nat least for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act, the Supreme Court of Texas\nheld that “an insured’s claim for defense costs is a first-party claim because it\n                                        16\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606         Page: 17     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-10537\nconcerns a direct loss to the insured; that is, the claim does not belong to a\nthird party.” 242 S.W.3d at 17. Ultimately, we find Lamar Homes inapt.\n       Lamar Homes did not hold that a duty of good faith and fair dealing runs\nfrom insured to insurer in circumstances where the duty to defend was\ntriggered and the insurer failed to adequately cover the defense. Indeed, the\ncase had nothing to do with the duty of good faith and fair dealing and\nconcerned statutory, rather than common law, duties. It would be odd if a\nruling on the Prompt Payment Act dramatically affected the common law\nduties of insurers. Lamar Homes, 242 S.W.3d at 16 (describing the issue\npresented as “whether the ‘Prompt Payment of Claims’ statute . . . applies to\nan insurer’s breach of the duty to defend”). It would be odder still if the catalyst\nfor that change in the law was the Texas legislature’s decision to add the term\n“first-party claim” to the Prompt Payment Act.               See id. at 24 (Brister, J.\ndissenting) (noting the addition of the phrase in 1991).\n       Notably, Aldous has pointed to no Texas courts interpreting Lamar\nHomes to revise the common law duties of insurers in the manner for which\nshe advocates. Most courts that have considered the possibility have rejected\nit. 7 Further, under Aldous’s view, the duty of good faith and fair dealing only\nexists (and is violated) when the duty to defend has also been breached. In\nrejecting this theory, we follow the Supreme Court of Texas’ pertinent\ninstructions.

Darwin’s Claims\n1.     Money Had and Received/Equitable Reimbursement\n       In light of our judicial estoppel ruling, the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment on Darwin’s claim for money had and received cannot\nstand. Aldous argues that judgment was improper for another reason: under\nTexas law, an insurer has no right of equitable reimbursement against its\ninsured. For the reasons that follow, as a federal court exercising diversity\njurisdiction, we cannot endorse the district court’s recognition of an insurer’s\npreviously unannounced equitable right of recovery against its insured.\n       In the words of the district court, an insurer “is entitled to recover to the\nextent it made overpayments,” and overpayments are payments made but not\nactually required “under the insurance contract.”         Aldous v. Darwin Nat.\nAssur.

Tex. Apr.\n24, 2015). Under this approach, an insurer that makes payments under a\npolicy while coverage is disputed can sue its insured, claiming a right to\nequitable reimbursement if the coverage dispute is resolved in its favor. And,\n\n\n                                        18\n\f   Case: 16-10537     Document: 00513914606      Page: 19   Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                  No. 16-10537\nbecause the claim is equitable in nature, the insurer need not point to any\npolicy provision granting the right. Rather, the right exists by default.\n       Under Texas law, if an insurance company disputes coverage with its\ninsured but nonetheless settles the action on the insured’s behalf, there is no\nright to equitable reimbursement if the third party’s claims are later\ndetermined to be uncovered by the policy. Matagorda County, 52 S.W.3d at\n135.   This is true even where the insurer has provided coverage under a\nreservation of rights. Id. at 131. But nothing stops insurers from including a\nright to reimbursement in its Policy or obtaining “the insured’s clear and\nunequivocal consent to the settlement and the insurer’s right to seek\nreimbursement.” Id. at 135. The Supreme Court of Texas later described\nMatagorda County broadly, as a case “declining to recognize an implied-in-fact,\nan implied-in-law, or an equitable reimbursement right outside of the\ninsurance policy’s provisions.”    Excess Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London v.\nFrank’s Casing Crew & Rental Tools, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1402310\"><a href=\"/opinion/1402310/excess-underwriters-v-franks-casing-crew/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 45 (Tex. 2008).\n       Under the broad reading of Matagorda County suggested by Frank’s\nCasing, Darwin has no equitable reimbursement right outside of the insurance\npolicy’s provisions. Both of those cases, however, apply where an insurer\n“settles a claim against its insured when coverage is disputed.” See id. at 43.\nAnd much of their reasoning is specifically tailored to that scenario. See id. at\n46. (“Our analysis in Matagorda County highlighted the dilemma faced by both\ninsurer and insured when a claimant presents a settlement demand within\npolicy limits and coverage is uncertain.”). Thus, those cases strongly suggest\n(but do not necessarily dictate) that insurers have no right to equitable\nreimbursement of costs expended in defending an insured where coverage\nexists but the scope of the duty to defend is disputed and later resolved in favor\nof the insurer.

Id. at 100. Because interest was accruing at an\nalarming rate, Jensen paid the judgment just prior to filing a petition for\nreview with the Supreme Court of Texas. Id. Texas’ highest court then sided\nwith Jensen on the merits, again rendering judgment in favor of Miga but in\nan amount just over $1 million. Id. at 101. Miga took the position that the\nreversal had no financial consequences and denied any obligation to repay the\n$21,560,150.67 he had received beyond the proper, adjusted judgment amount.\nId. Jensen then filed suit for restitution, and the case again wound up before\nthe Supreme Court of Texas, which applied the “restitution-after-reversal rule”\nand held in Jensen’s favor. Id. at 101–02.\n      Miga argued that Frank’s Casing (which the Supreme Court of Texas\ndescribed broadly as a case “in which we declined to recognize an equitable\nright of reimbursement”) should apply and bar Jensen’s claim. The argument\nwas rejected:\n       This case involves restitution upon reversal of a judgment, not\n       insurers seeking restitution from an insured on a third-party\n       claim, against the backdrop of a highly regulated industry. . . .\n       Restitution in insurance-related cases involves policy concerns not\n       present here:\n             [D]isputes between insurers and policyholders over the\n             insurer’s duty to pay a claim, or to settle or defend a claim\n             brought against the policyholder, present special difficulties\n             for the law of restitution, because the insurer’s duty to\n             indemnify and defend is subject to extensive regulation\n             under local law.\nId. (quoting Restatement (Third) § 35, cmt. c. (Tentative Draft No. 3, 2004)).\n\n                                      21\n\f     Case: 16-10537      Document: 00513914606         Page: 22     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                      No. 16-10537\n       Miga suggests that an “equitable right to reimbursement” does not exist\nat all in the context of insurance cases. It shows that recognition of such a\nright would be only proper after a thorough and conscientious review of Texas’\nregulatory scheme in light of the unique “policy concerns” implicated. And it\nfirmly establishes that we cannot look to generic contract cases when trying to\nidentify equitable rights of insurers against their insureds.\n       In light of Matagorda County, Frank’s Casing, Miga, and our constrained\nrole, our obligation is clear. We have been asked to recognize, as a matter of\nTexas law, an insurer’s right to equitable reimbursement for “overpayments”\nof defense costs. But “it is not for us to adopt innovative theories of recovery\nfor Texas law.” Dean, 821 F.2d at 284. Summary judgment should have been\ngranted in favor of Aldous with respect to Darwin’s claims for equitable\nreimbursement (however denominated). 8\n2.     Breach of Contract\n       Darwin also seeks the return of money that was not overpaid but that\nwas properly paid. Darwin believes the legal fees Hill paid directly to Aldous\nshould have instead been paid directly to Darwin, at least in a measure\ncommensurate with the legal fees Darwin spent on Aldous’s behalf. This\nscenario seems ready-made for subrogation. See Fortis Benefits v. Cantu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894884\"><a href=\"/opinion/894884/fortis-benefits-v-cantu/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">642</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645 (Tex. 2007) (explaining how subrogation rights “prevent the\ninsured from receiving a double recovery, first from the insurer, then from the\nthird party”). Darwin paid at least some measure of Aldous’s legal fees, and\nAldous then recovered legal fees from Hill. Understandably, Darwin thinks it\nis entitled to some of the money paid by Hill. 9\n\n\n\n       8 Based on this holding, we do not need to reach Aldous’s argument that the district\ncourt misapplied the law relating to claims for money had and received.\n       9 Aldous contends that allegations of a windfall recovery are “repudiated by the\n\nevidence” because she “invested over $1.1 million of her own resources” in prevailing against\n                                             22\n\f    Case: 16-10537      Document: 00513914606        Page: 23    Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                    No. 16-10537\n         For whatever reason, however, Darwin did not seek subrogation against\nHill. That is, it did not intervene in the prior litigation, step into the shoes of\nAldous, and assert (for its own benefit) Aldous’s right to attorney’s fees against\nHill. Darwin concedes that it cannot assert subrogation rights against Aldous,\nits own insured. This result follows from the very nature of subrogation rights.\nAs a “purely conceptual” matter, an insurer cannot be subrogated against “an\ninsured because an insurer who seeks subrogation stands in the shoes of the\ninsured.” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Perkins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2336549\"><a href=\"/opinion/2336549/state-farm-mut-auto-ins-co-v-perkins/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401 (Tex.\nApp. 2006). “Because a person cannot sue himself for damages, that person’s\ninsurer, who stands in the person’s shoes for subrogation purposes, cannot sue\nthe person either.” Id.\n         According to Darwin, this analysis misses the point.             Darwin isn’t\nseeking to assert subrogation rights.           Rather, Darwin is alleging Aldous\nviolated the terms of the Policy—ordinary breach of contract. Thus, Darwin\nargues it “had a subrogation right against Hill as a result of its payments on\nAldous’ behalf, and Aldous impaired Darwin’s subrogation rights by\nsuccessfully suing Hill for money paid by Darwin that Aldous recovered and\nthen withheld.” Or, as stated in the reply brief, “Darwin had the right to step\ninto Aldous’ shoes to recover the defense fees it paid against Hill, but is not\nattempting to do so in this lawsuit because Aldous prevented it from doing so.”\nThus, with its contract claim, Darwin is attempting to belatedly achieve the\nsame ends it should have achieved through subrogation. Its labored argument\nfails.\n         The relevant Policy provision provides:\n         The Insurer shall be subrogated to all Insureds’ rights of\n         recovery against any person or organization. All Insureds shall\n\n\nHill. In deciding this appeal, we need not determine whether she stands to double-recover\nor whether such a result would be permissible in this case.\n                                           23\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606          Page: 24     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\n       assist the Insurer in effecting any rights of indemnity,\n       contribution and apportionment available to any Insured,\n       including the execution of such documents as are necessary to\n       enable the Insurer to pursue claims in the Insureds’ names and\n       shall provide all other assistance and cooperation which the\n       Insurer may reasonably require. All Insureds shall cooperate\n       with the Insurer and do nothing to jeopardize, prejudice or\n       terminate in any way such rights.\n             The Insurer shall not exercise any such rights against any\n       Insureds except as provided herein. Notwithstanding the\n       foregoing, however, the Insurer reserves the right to exercise any\n       rights of subrogation against any Insured with respect to any\n       Claim brought about or contributed to by the intentional,\n       criminal, fraudulent, malicious or dishonest act or omission of such\n       Insured.\n       The Policy provides Darwin with subrogation rights, but Aldous did not\nbreach the Policy by seeking attorney’s fees against Hill. Indeed, she arguably\nassisted Darwin, who could have benefited from the adjudication. 10 Darwin\nshould have asserted its subrogation rights against Hill.                 See, e.g., Fortis\nBenefits, 234 S.W.3d at 648; Ortiz v. Great S. Fire & Cas. Ins.

Instead, it sat on its rights and, after being sued, brought\nclaims directly against its insured.

Darwin has not claimed any\ncontractual right to reimbursement and yet essentially seeks the same end. “[I]nsurers are\nwell equipped to evaluate and reduce risk by, for example, ‘drafting policies to specifically\n                                             24\n\f    Case: 16-10537       Document: 00513914606        Page: 25     Date Filed: 03/16/2017\n\n\n\n                                       No. 16-10537\n                                 IV.
