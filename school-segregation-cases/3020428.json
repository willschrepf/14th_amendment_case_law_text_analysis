(Welf. & Inst.\nCode, §§ 300 & 361).1 We affirm.\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       1. The petition\n       The juvenile court sustained a petition under section 300, subdivision (b), failure\nto protect, alleging that Alice was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder Depressed\nType, Bi-Polar Disorder, and Mood Disorder, and suicidal ideation. Alice has attempted\nsuicide, engages in self mutilation, and is aggressive toward others. She has been\ninvoluntarily hospitalized numerous times. She requires psychotropic medication and\nongoing psychiatric treatment. The petition specifically alleged that mother “has failed to\nregularly provide the child with the recommended therapeutic psychiatric treatment and\nfailed to provide the child with the child’s prescribed psychotropic medication. The\nmother’s medical neglect of the child endangers the child’s physical health and safety and\nplaces the child and the child’s siblings . . . at risk of physical harm, damage and medical\nneglect.” The second count alleges that mother is “unable to provide appropriate parental\ncare and supervision of the child Alice due to the child’s mental and emotional\nproblems,” which inability endangers Alice’s physical health and safety.\n       2. The record\n       When Alice was nine years old, psychiatrists diagnosed her as psychotic and\nadvised mother to institutionalize her. In December 2013, when Alice was age 11, the\nDepartment of Children and Family Services (the Department) received a referral\nalleging that the child had been hospitalized five times in one year for psychiatric issues,\nand was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. Alice acted aggressively toward her mother\n\n\n\n\n1\n       All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fand siblings, Naomi E. (age 14) and C.E. (age 11).2 She also engaged in self-mutilation\nby scratching her face, banging her head, and hitting and taking scissors to her legs.\nAlice attempted suicide “a couple” of times, most recently two days before the referral.\n       The family moved frequently from state to state and the disruption may have\nexacerbated Alice’s mental instability. Mother did not fill Alice’s prescriptions for\npsychotropic medication for two weeks after Alice was discharged from the hospital in\nlate 2013, despite numerous referrals for free medication.\n       After a team decision meeting (TDM), the Department instituted family\nmaintenance services and a full service partnership (FSP) in early 2014, through which\nAlice received mental health assistance, individual counseling, psychiatric services, and a\nmedication evaluation. Mother located stable housing.\n       Notwithstanding the Department’s involvement, Alice was hospitalized four more\ntimes: In February 2014 Alice jumped from a moving bus and then threatened to hurt the\nstaff and peers at school. Doctors diagnosed her with a mood disorder and prescribed her\nRisperdal and Zoloft. In April 2014, Alice was put on a 72-hour hold after she\nbrandished a knife and threatened to stab family members and herself. Alice was\nhospitalized again on May 30, 2014, the day her teacher noticed a bruise on the child’s\ncheek. Alice reported that mother had slapped her and then kept her home for a day until\nthe swelling went away. In July 2014, Alice threatened to kill herself and mother, and\nassaulted her siblings. Doctors during this hospitalization diagnosed Alice with\nschizoaffective disorder, depressed type and prescribed Wellbutrin and Seroquel.\n       Shortly thereafter, mother requested an emergency meeting because she “couldn’t\nhandle” Alice’s behavior. At the TDM in late July 2014, the Department, FSP, mother’s\nparent partner, and mother agreed to a higher level of care for Alice, such as a level-12\n2\n       Mother also appeals from the order taking jurisdiction over her other children,\nNaomi and C.E. However, we take judicial notice of the juvenile court’s April 9, 2015\norder terminating jurisdiction over Naomi and C.E., which order renders mother’s\ncontentions as to those two children moot. We need not address mother’s arguments\nconcerning Naomi and C.E. (In re Vincent S. (2001) 92 Cal.App.4th 1090, 1093 [“the\nlaw does not require idle acts”].)\n\n\n                                             3\n\fgroup facility or an intensive treatment foster care home. FSP agreed to obtain a second\nopinion about appropriate treatment and to increase in-home services immediately. The\nDepartment agreed to locate the higher level of care for Alice and to provide Alice with\ntherapeutic behavioral services (TBS) immediately.\n       While the Department was looking for an intensive foster care placement for\nAlice, the child was hospitalized in August 2014 for about the eleventh time in her life.\nAlice had thoughts of harming herself and claimed to have ingested six tablets of\nSeroquel to end her life. She also threatened to harm her grandmother with a knife.\nAlice claimed that her stepgrandmother reprimanded her for selling her toys and\nthreatened to kill her, and her stepfather threw her on the ground and banged her head\ntwice. Her new diagnosis was mood disorder.\n       Asked whether she was willing to care for Alice with the aid of more intensive\nservices, mother replied in August 2014 that it was a “ ‘little too late. . . . At this point, I\nthink it would be best to place Alice. I can’t take care of her and she is too much for me.\nShe is violent and I can’t put my other children in danger.’ ” (Italics added.)\n       The Department held a teleconference with the hospital social worker, along with\nrepresentatives from the Department of Mental Health and the FSP. The hospital\nreported that Alice “ ‘exhibits poor impulse control – needs constant redirection;\nparticipates in group.’ ” She was compliant with her medication with no reported side\neffects. Mother did not want Alice to return home. The Department placed Alice in a 30-\nday emergency shelter and detained her from mother.\n       Mother did not want Alice in foster care but residential facilities had long wait\nlists. Mother insisted that she had been proactive by going to classes at the National\nAlliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and by taking Alice to see a psychiatrist monthly, a\nbehavioral specialist bi-weekly, and therapy weekly. However, Alice’s behavior\nworsened after mother returned to work in April. Mother stated: “ ‘I think she [Alice]\nfelt like she was not getting enough attention.’ ” Mother had issues with Alice’s\nmedication. One drug made the child lactate, and another made her lethargic.\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f      Alice’s stepfather claimed that Alice was terrorizing the family and that the child’s\nbehavior was getting worse and more aggressive. “Children have a choice in their\nbehavior and how they react. . . . I believe she has chosen bad behavior,” he said. The\nfamily tried to bribe Alice to do chores. They bought her a computer game to calm her\ndown. Mother sometimes asked C.E. and Naomi to step out of the room when Alice\nbecame aggressive and violent. Mother spanked the child because Alice was out of\ncontrol. Alice’s siblings were happy when Alice was not at home because she caused a\ncommotion, was aggressive, and the siblings were sometimes afraid of her.\n      The professionals opined that Alice required therapy, stability, and structure. The\nchildren’s social worker, who worked with the family during family maintenance\nservices, agreed with mother that Alice’s behavior worsened when mother returned to\nwork. The social worker stated that Alice “ ‘is very challenging and needs lots of\nstructure. Alice needs to be in a placement for the time being. Mother needs lots of one\non one parent education to help her support Alice’s mental health needs. Alice thrives\nwhen she gets one on one attention. Family therapy needs to be in place before Alice\ntransitions home to avoid Alice being the scapegoat of the family.’ ” Likewise, the\nclinical psychologist at the Department of Mental Health who participated in the TDM in\nDecember 2013 explained that the home environment is a large factor in how the child\ncopes and performs. A child with Alice’s history needs structure, stability, and\nconsistency. Alice needed a stable placement to obtain her baseline and an accurate\ndiagnosis. She would also benefit from a structured environment, therapy, and\nmedication management.\n      In fact, Alice posed no major problems in her placement, was following rules, and\ngot along well with others. She was seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. She had no\nproblems taking medication. Alice reported that she liked her medication because it\nhelped her and made her happy. She did not like living at home because she did not like\nher stepfather, who hit her. The last time she lived at home, her cousin, grandmother, and\nstepfather all hit her. She acknowledged hitting herself, her stepfather, and sometimes\nher mother.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f       Mother has a history with child protective services in San Bernardino County\ndating back to 1994, when she was a dependent minor. There was domestic violence\nwith mother’s first husband. Mother “elected” not to reunify with three older children,\none of whom is in long term foster care, and the two others were adopted.\n       The Department recommended that the juvenile court declare the children\ndependents and place Alice in foster care as it did not appear that mother was able to care\nfor Alice. Mother did not fill Alice’s psychotropic medication even with referrals for free\nmedication. Despite multiple in-home services, the family had three referrals for physical\nabuse, and Alice was hospitalized five times for a lifetime total of 11. Mother consented\nto Alice’s current detention because she did not feel she was capable of caring for the\nchild. Mother needed education in how to parent a child with mental illness and\ncounseling to help her deal with the stress of a mentally ill child. Alice needed the\nstability, consistency, structure, and support that she was receiving in her placement.\n       At the adjudication hearing, mother testified that she did not fill Alice’s\nprescription for nearly three weeks after the child’s hospital discharge because she did\nnot have cash or Medi-Cal and because she was “very skeptical” of the medications’ side\neffects. Asked whether she had the supervision of a psychiatrist when she stopped\ndispensing medication to Alice, mother testified, “[t]hat was my parental right not to give\nmy child a drug that was making her hallucinate. I feel as a parent, I have that right. [¶]\nI mean, I’m with my child 24 hours a day. I know what’s good for my child. I know\nwhat’s bad. And I’m not going to give her medication just because a doctor prescribes it.\nIf it’s not good for her, I’m not going to give it to her.” (Italics added.) Finally mother\nobtained a different evaluation and a new prescription. Mother acknowledged having “a\nlot of difficulty with” Alice. Still, she claimed to have been the child’s biggest advocate\nstarting when Alice was six years old and sought help for the child. Mother was sure she\ncould provide Alice with all needed treatment if the child returned home.\n       The juvenile court sustained the petition. The court recited from the record and\nconcluded that “this family does not truly appreciate the severity of this issue nor are\nadequately equipped to address [Alice’s] mental health issues.” Despite all of the\n\n\n                                              6\n\fservices and therapy already in place, the family believed Alice was simply seeking\nattention and acting up, and that the solution was to bribe her to do her chores or to\nisolate her until she calmed down. The court cited the psychologists’ opinion that Alice\nneeded a stable home environment and to be understood. The court found that Alice was\nnot simply an incorrigible teenager, but a youth who needed help. The lack of structure\nin the home, the lack of understanding of Alice’s mental health issues, mother’s failure to\nfill Alice’s prescription for more than two weeks, and mother’s lack of parenting\neducation to help her support Alice’s mental health needs, put Alice at risk that the\nsituation could “escalate[] to a more dire level,” and turn Alice into a scapegoat. The\ncourt was mindful that mother had many services in place, but they did not help as Alice\nwas nonetheless hospitalized five times in less than a year, and mother requested that the\nchild be removed from mother’s care.\n       The court removed Alice from mother’s custody (§ 361, subd. (c)) and ordered her\nsuitably placed. The court ordered mother into an approved plan of parenting to address\ndevelopmentally appropriate issues, one-on-one classes to address children with mental\nillness, individual counseling to address family dynamics, dealing with mental health\nissues, and conjoint counseling. The court ordered the entire family to continue with\nNAMI, along with the other programs already in place. Mother was awarded monitored\nvisitation. Mother appealed.\n                                      CONTENTIONS\n       Mother contends that the jurisdiction and disposition findings lack substantial\nevidence.\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       1. The jurisdictional order is supported by substantial evidence.\n       Section 300, subdivision (b)(1), in pertinent part, describes a child who “has\nsuffered, or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer, serious physical harm or\nillness, as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately\nsupervise or protect the child” or “by the willful or negligent failure of the parent or\nguardian to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment.”\n\n\n                                               7\n\fThe definition in subdivision (b) “consists of three elements: (1) neglectful conduct by\nthe parent in one of the specified forms; (2) causation; and (3) ‘serious physical harm or\nillness’ to the minor, or a ‘substantial risk’ of such harm or illness.” (In re Rocco M.\n(1991) 1 Cal.App.4th 814, 820.) Although “evidence of past conduct may be probative\nof current conditions, the question under section 300 is whether circumstances at the time\nof the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm.” (Id. at p. 824.)\n       “[S]ection 300 does not require that a child actually be abused or neglected before\nthe juvenile court can assume jurisdiction. [Section 300, subdivision (b)] require[s] only\na ‘substantial risk’ that the child will be abused or neglected. The legislatively declared\npurpose of [section 300] ‘is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who\nare currently being physically, sexually, or emotionally abused, being neglected, or being\nexploited, and to ensure the safety, protection, and physical and emotional well-being of\nchildren who are at risk of that harm.’ (§ 300.2, italics added.) ‘The court need not wait\nuntil a child is seriously abused or injured to assume jurisdiction and take the steps\nnecessary to protect the child.’ [Citation.]” (In re I.J. (2013) 56 Cal.4th 766, 773.)\n“[T]he court may . . . consider past events when determining whether a child presently\nneeds the juvenile court’s protection. [Citations.] A parent’s past conduct is a good\npredictor of future behavior. [Citation.] ‘Facts supporting allegations that a child is one\ndescribed by section 300 are cumulative.’ [Citation.] Thus, the court ‘must consider all\nthe circumstances affecting the child, wherever they occur.’ [Citation.]” (In re T.V.\n(2013) 217 Cal.App.4th 126, 133.)\n       In an appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to justify a finding or\norder, we look for substantial supporting evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted. (In re\nHeather A. (1996) 52 Cal.App.4th 183, 193.) When “making this determination, we\ndraw all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the findings and orders of the\ndependency court; we review the record in the light most favorable to the court’s\ndeterminations; and we note that issues of fact and credibility are the province of the trial\ncourt. [Citation.]” (Ibid.) We do not reweigh the evidence or exercise independent\njudgment, or assess credibility (In re Casey D. (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 38, 52); we\n\n\n                                              8\n\f“merely determine if there are sufficient facts to support the findings of the trial court.”\n(In re Matthew S. (1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 315, 321.) Thus, the pertinent inquiry is\nwhether substantial evidence supports the finding, not whether a contrary finding might\nhave been made. (In re Dakota H. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 212, 228.)\n       Mindful of these rules, we conclude the record contains sufficient evidence to\nsupport the juvenile court’s finding that Alice is described by section 300, subdivision\n(b)(1) because she has suffered and is at substantial risk of suffering serious physical\nharm or illness as a result of mother’s “inability . . . to adequately supervise or protect”\nher. (Ibid.) The record shows, as the juvenile court found, that the instability and lack of\nstructure in the home, the failure to appreciate the gravity of Alice’s illness, the\nwithholding of medication, and the lack of education about parenting a mentally ill child,\nresulted in repeated hospitalization and physical abuse of Alice, and placed her at serious\nrisk of more harm, blame, and scapegoating.\n       Mother contends no parental unfitness or neglectful conduct placed Alice at risk.\nMother insists that she has a “very clear understanding of Alice’s mental health\nissues[. She has] educated herself and her children regarding Alice’s issues, and she had\na team in place working with Alice and the family.” However, not only has mother\nrepeatedly sought institutional help because she could not take care of Alice or control\nher behavior, but as the Department notes, two incidences of physical abuse, five\npsychiatric hospitalizations, three weeks without prescribed medication, and physical\nabuse by others in the home belie mother’s assertion she and the team can provide Alice\nwith needed care. What mother fails to comprehend is that even after Departmental\nintervention, TBS and FSP services, and repeated meetings, Alice continued to be\nhospitalized. Once placed, however, Alice received the needed consistency, was\ncompliant, got along well with others, and liked taking her medication.\n       In arguing there is no evidence of parental unfitness or neglect, mother relies on\nIn re Precious D. (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th 1251. Precious D. held “parental unfitness or\nneglectful conduct must be shown in order to assert dependency court jurisdiction under\nthat part of section 300(b) providing for jurisdiction based on the parent’s ‘inability . . . to\n\n\n                                               9\n\fadequately supervise or protect the child.’ ” (Id. at p. 1254.)3 In Precious D. the only\nfinding “critical of Mother’s parenting skills or conduct” in relation to her “incorrigible\nteenage daughter,” who repeatedly ran away from home and from foster placements\nduring a period of voluntary family maintenance, was that the mother and her daughter\nwere not communicating. (Id. at pp. 1253 & 1259.) The appellate court reversed the\nsection 300, subdivision (b) jurisdictional order for lack of evidence because the record\nshowed that the mother and daughter were in daily telephone contact and the Department\nrecognized that there was “ ‘open communication between the mother and the child.’ ”\n(In re Precious D., at p. 1259.) The Department admitted that the reason it sought\ndependency court jurisdiction was the child’s incorrigible behavior and need for court-\nordered services, not because of any neglectful conduct by the mother. In fact, the\nDepartment made no claim that the mother was unfit to parent her daughter. (Ibid.,\nfn. 2.)\n          Unlike Precious D., the record here contains ample evidence supporting the\nfinding of parental unfitness and neglect as well as willful failure to provide required\nmedication. Mother admitted she hits Alice because she cannot control her daughter.\nMother also failed to prevent others from hitting Alice. Rather than to rely on the advice\nof a psychiatrist, mother withheld prescribed medication from Alice in exercise of her\nclaimed parental right, and based on her own medical assessment that the prescribed\ndrugs were not good for Alice.4 The Department sought protection of the juvenile court\n\n3\n       The Department counters that we need not follow Precious D. because In re R.T.\n(2015) 235 Cal.App.4th 795, held that no showing of parental blame is required before a\ncourt may assert dependency jurisdiction over a child. However, apart from the fact that\nthe Supreme Court has granted review of In re R.T. on this very point (June 15, 2015,\nS226416), we conclude that Precious D. is distinguishable from this case and so we need\nnot rely on In re R.T.\n4\n       Mother insists she was not medically negligent because the treatment she was\nproviding to Alice was sufficient as evidenced by the fact the Department did not change\nthe protocol once voluntary services commenced. This argument ignores the opinion of\nthe Department of Mental Health psychologist that Alice had yet to receive an accurate\ndiagnosis.\n\n\n                                             10\n\ffor Alice because of mother’s neglect and unfitness demonstrated by her inability to care\nfor, protect, or control the child’s aggression and violence, and the need for court-ordered\nservices for mother. Unlike In re Precious D., a case of simply an incorrigible teenager\nand no evidence of parental unfitness or neglect, this case involves a seriously mentally\nill child who is a danger to herself and others, and parental unfitness, neglect, and failure\nto provide medication.\n       Mother argues, citing In re J.N. (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 1010, 1014-1016, that one\nincident of withholding medication is insufficient to bring the child within the juvenile\ncourt’s jurisdiction. In re J.N. involved a single incident of parental unfitness, a drunk-\ndriving accident that injured the children (ibid.) and no evidence that the children were at\na risk of harm by the time of the jurisdictional hearing. (Id. at p. 1025.) Yet, the\nwithholding of medication is not the only incident of parental unfitness here. The\nwithholding in the past coupled with mother’s insistence at the jurisdiction hearing that\nshe knew what was good for Alice and that she was not required to give the child\nmedication “just because a doctor prescribes it,” evinces mother’s lack of understanding\nof what is needed for Alice and serves as a reliable predictor of mother’s future behavior.\n(In re T.V., supra, 217 Cal.App.4th at p. 133.) In sum, the cumulative record here reveals\nmultiple incidences of failure to protect, in addition to mother’s refusal to administer\nAlice’s prescribed medication, and supports the juvenile court’s finding that Alice is\ndescribed by section 300, subdivision (b).\n       2. The dispositional order is supported by substantial evidence.\n       Section 361, subdivision (c) directs, “[b]efore the court may order a child\nphysically removed from his or her parent, it must find, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that the child would be at substantial risk of harm if returned home and that\nthere are no reasonable means by which the child can be protected without removal.\n[Citations.]” (In re Cole C. (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 900, 917, citing § 361, subd. (c)(1).)\n       When “ ‘determining the appropriate disposition, the court shall receive in\nevidence the social study of the minor made by the probation officer, any study or\nevaluation made by a child advocate appointed by the court, and such other relevant and\n\n\n                                             11\n\fmaterial evidence as may be offered.’ [Citation.] This statutory command envisions that\nthe juvenile court will be provided with a broad spectrum of evidence shedding light on\nthe circumstances of the minor and his or her family. [Citation.] Of necessity, in\nvirtually every case, the court will have before it conduct or circumstances of family\nmembers not pleaded in the petition.” (In re Rodger H. (1991) 228 Cal.App.3d 1174,\n1183, quoting from § 358, subd. (b).) “In this regard, the court may consider the parent’s\npast conduct as well as present circumstances. [Citation.]” (In re Cole C., supra,\n174 Cal.App.4th at p. 917.) Furthermore, the “parent need not be dangerous and the child\nneed not have been actually harmed for removal to be appropriate. The focus of the\nstatute is on averting harm to the child. [Citations.]” (Ibid.) “The court’s principal\nconcern is a disposition consistent with the best interests of the minor.” (In re Rodger H.,\nsupra, at p. 1183.)\n       While the juvenile court must make its finding under section 361, subdivision (c)\nby clear and convincing evidence, on appeal, we review the order for substantial\nevidence. (In re Christopher R. (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1210, 1216, fn. 4.)\n       Mother contends the removal order was not supported by substantial evidence.\nShe cites her testimony that she recently developed a treatment plan that is more thorough\nthan what had existed. She testified she, Alice, the behavioral specialist, therapists, and\nmother’s parent partner, developed a safety plan for responding to Alice’s violent\noutbursts and aggression. Mother argues, the juvenile court erred when it found there\nwas no reasonable alternative to removal.\n       Although mother insists she has recently developed a more complete plan to meet\nthe child’s needs, the record shows she also admitted in August 2014 that she could not\ncare for Alice even with more intensive services. Furthermore, the juvenile court took\njurisdiction over Alice because mother’s lack of understanding and insight into the\nseverity of Alice’s illness and her inability to address Alice’s behavior, even with in-\nhome services. The record is replete with references to Alice’s need for medication\nmanagement and for stability and structure. Mother’s reaction to Alice’s violence and\naggression, which she admitted she is unable to control, has been to hospitalize her\n\n\n                                             12\n\ftemporarily, hit the child, or segregate her, all of which conduct is unsafe and undermines\nthe stability, structure, and consistency that Alice needs. The Department and therapists\nhave explained that educating mother on how her actions play a role in Alice’s illness and\nbehavior is an important aspect of protecting the child. After Alice was removed from\nmother’s custody, the child was compliant, followed rules, posed no major problems, and\nfreely took her medication, without reservation. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to\nsupport the juvenile court’s finding by clear and convincing evidence that returning Alice\nhome would put her at substantial risk of physical harm and there is no reasonable means\nby which the child can be protected without removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      The orders appealed from are affirmed.\n\n\n      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS\n\n\n\n\n                                                ALDRICH, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n\n             EDMON, P.

(Welf. & Inst.\nCode, §§ 300 & 361).1 We affirm.\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n       1. The petition\n       The juvenile court sustained a petition under section 300, subdivision (b), failure\nto protect, alleging that Alice was diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder Depressed\nType, Bi-Polar Disorder, and Mood Disorder, and suicidal ideation. Alice has attempted\nsuicide, engages in self mutilation, and is aggressive toward others. She has been\ninvoluntarily hospitalized numerous times. She requires psychotropic medication and\nongoing psychiatric treatment. The petition specifically alleged that mother “has failed to\nregularly provide the child with the recommended therapeutic psychiatric treatment and\nfailed to provide the child with the child’s prescribed psychotropic medication. The\nmother’s medical neglect of the child endangers the child’s physical health and safety and\nplaces the child and the child’s siblings . . . at risk of physical harm, damage and medical\nneglect.” The second count alleges that mother is “unable to provide appropriate parental\ncare and supervision of the child Alice due to the child’s mental and emotional\nproblems,” which inability endangers Alice’s physical health and safety.\n       2. The record\n       When Alice was nine years old, psychiatrists diagnosed her as psychotic and\nadvised mother to institutionalize her. In December 2013, when Alice was age 11, the\nDepartment of Children and Family Services (the Department) received a referral\nalleging that the child had been hospitalized five times in one year for psychiatric issues,\nand was diagnosed with bi-polar disorder. Alice acted aggressively toward her mother\n\n\n\n\n1\n       All further statutory references are to the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n\n                                              2\n\fand siblings, Naomi E. (age 14) and C.E. (age 11).2 She also engaged in self-mutilation\nby scratching her face, banging her head, and hitting and taking scissors to her legs.\nAlice attempted suicide “a couple” of times, most recently two days before the referral.\n       The family moved frequently from state to state and the disruption may have\nexacerbated Alice’s mental instability. Mother did not fill Alice’s prescriptions for\npsychotropic medication for two weeks after Alice was discharged from the hospital in\nlate 2013, despite numerous referrals for free medication.\n       After a team decision meeting (TDM), the Department instituted family\nmaintenance services and a full service partnership (FSP) in early 2014, through which\nAlice received mental health assistance, individual counseling, psychiatric services, and a\nmedication evaluation. Mother located stable housing.\n       Notwithstanding the Department’s involvement, Alice was hospitalized four more\ntimes: In February 2014 Alice jumped from a moving bus and then threatened to hurt the\nstaff and peers at school. Doctors diagnosed her with a mood disorder and prescribed her\nRisperdal and Zoloft. In April 2014, Alice was put on a 72-hour hold after she\nbrandished a knife and threatened to stab family members and herself. Alice was\nhospitalized again on May 30, 2014, the day her teacher noticed a bruise on the child’s\ncheek. Alice reported that mother had slapped her and then kept her home for a day until\nthe swelling went away. In July 2014, Alice threatened to kill herself and mother, and\nassaulted her siblings. Doctors during this hospitalization diagnosed Alice with\nschizoaffective disorder, depressed type and prescribed Wellbutrin and Seroquel.\n       Shortly thereafter, mother requested an emergency meeting because she “couldn’t\nhandle” Alice’s behavior. At the TDM in late July 2014, the Department, FSP, mother’s\nparent partner, and mother agreed to a higher level of care for Alice, such as a level-12\n2\n       Mother also appeals from the order taking jurisdiction over her other children,\nNaomi and C.E. However, we take judicial notice of the juvenile court’s April 9, 2015\norder terminating jurisdiction over Naomi and C.E., which order renders mother’s\ncontentions as to those two children moot. We need not address mother’s arguments\nconcerning Naomi and C.E. (In re Vincent S. (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2269692\"><a href=\"/opinion/2269692/in-re-matter-of-vincent-s/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1093 [“the\nlaw does not require idle acts”].)\n\n\n                                             3\n\fgroup facility or an intensive treatment foster care home. FSP agreed to obtain a second\nopinion about appropriate treatment and to increase in-home services immediately. The\nDepartment agreed to locate the higher level of care for Alice and to provide Alice with\ntherapeutic behavioral services (TBS) immediately.\n       While the Department was looking for an intensive foster care placement for\nAlice, the child was hospitalized in August 2014 for about the eleventh time in her life.\nAlice had thoughts of harming herself and claimed to have ingested six tablets of\nSeroquel to end her life. She also threatened to harm her grandmother with a knife.\nAlice claimed that her stepgrandmother reprimanded her for selling her toys and\nthreatened to kill her, and her stepfather threw her on the ground and banged her head\ntwice. Her new diagnosis was mood disorder.\n       Asked whether she was willing to care for Alice with the aid of more intensive\nservices, mother replied in August 2014 that it was a “ ‘little too late. . . . At this point, I\nthink it would be best to place Alice. I can’t take care of her and she is too much for me.\nShe is violent and I can’t put my other children in danger.’ ” (Italics added.)\n       The Department held a teleconference with the hospital social worker, along with\nrepresentatives from the Department of Mental Health and the FSP. The hospital\nreported that Alice “ ‘exhibits poor impulse control – needs constant redirection;\nparticipates in group.’ ” She was compliant with her medication with no reported side\neffects. Mother did not want Alice to return home. The Department placed Alice in a 30-\nday emergency shelter and detained her from mother.\n       Mother did not want Alice in foster care but residential facilities had long wait\nlists. Mother insisted that she had been proactive by going to classes at the National\nAlliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), and by taking Alice to see a psychiatrist monthly, a\nbehavioral specialist bi-weekly, and therapy weekly. However, Alice’s behavior\nworsened after mother returned to work in April. Mother stated: “ ‘I think she [Alice]\nfelt like she was not getting enough attention.’ ” Mother had issues with Alice’s\nmedication. One drug made the child lactate, and another made her lethargic.\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\f      Alice’s stepfather claimed that Alice was terrorizing the family and that the child’s\nbehavior was getting worse and more aggressive. “Children have a choice in their\nbehavior and how they react. . . . I believe she has chosen bad behavior,” he said. The\nfamily tried to bribe Alice to do chores. They bought her a computer game to calm her\ndown. Mother sometimes asked C.E. and Naomi to step out of the room when Alice\nbecame aggressive and violent. Mother spanked the child because Alice was out of\ncontrol. Alice’s siblings were happy when Alice was not at home because she caused a\ncommotion, was aggressive, and the siblings were sometimes afraid of her.\n      The professionals opined that Alice required therapy, stability, and structure. The\nchildren’s social worker, who worked with the family during family maintenance\nservices, agreed with mother that Alice’s behavior worsened when mother returned to\nwork. The social worker stated that Alice “ ‘is very challenging and needs lots of\nstructure. Alice needs to be in a placement for the time being. Mother needs lots of one\non one parent education to help her support Alice’s mental health needs. Alice thrives\nwhen she gets one on one attention. Family therapy needs to be in place before Alice\ntransitions home to avoid Alice being the scapegoat of the family.’ ” Likewise, the\nclinical psychologist at the Department of Mental Health who participated in the TDM in\nDecember 2013 explained that the home environment is a large factor in how the child\ncopes and performs. A child with Alice’s history needs structure, stability, and\nconsistency. Alice needed a stable placement to obtain her baseline and an accurate\ndiagnosis. She would also benefit from a structured environment, therapy, and\nmedication management.\n      In fact, Alice posed no major problems in her placement, was following rules, and\ngot along well with others. She was seeing a therapist and a psychiatrist. She had no\nproblems taking medication. Alice reported that she liked her medication because it\nhelped her and made her happy. She did not like living at home because she did not like\nher stepfather, who hit her. The last time she lived at home, her cousin, grandmother, and\nstepfather all hit her. She acknowledged hitting herself, her stepfather, and sometimes\nher mother.\n\n\n                                            5\n\f       Mother has a history with child protective services in San Bernardino County\ndating back to 1994, when she was a dependent minor. There was domestic violence\nwith mother’s first husband. Mother “elected” not to reunify with three older children,\none of whom is in long term foster care, and the two others were adopted.\n       The Department recommended that the juvenile court declare the children\ndependents and place Alice in foster care as it did not appear that mother was able to care\nfor Alice. Mother did not fill Alice’s psychotropic medication even with referrals for free\nmedication. Despite multiple in-home services, the family had three referrals for physical\nabuse, and Alice was hospitalized five times for a lifetime total of 11. Mother consented\nto Alice’s current detention because she did not feel she was capable of caring for the\nchild. Mother needed education in how to parent a child with mental illness and\ncounseling to help her deal with the stress of a mentally ill child. Alice needed the\nstability, consistency, structure, and support that she was receiving in her placement.\n       At the adjudication hearing, mother testified that she did not fill Alice’s\nprescription for nearly three weeks after the child’s hospital discharge because she did\nnot have cash or Medi-Cal and because she was “very skeptical” of the medications’ side\neffects. Asked whether she had the supervision of a psychiatrist when she stopped\ndispensing medication to Alice, mother testified, “[t]hat was my parental right not to give\nmy child a drug that was making her hallucinate. I feel as a parent, I have that right. [¶]\nI mean, I’m with my child 24 hours a day. I know what’s good for my child. I know\nwhat’s bad. And I’m not going to give her medication just because a doctor prescribes it.\nIf it’s not good for her, I’m not going to give it to her.” (Italics added.) Finally mother\nobtained a different evaluation and a new prescription. Mother acknowledged having “a\nlot of difficulty with” Alice. Still, she claimed to have been the child’s biggest advocate\nstarting when Alice was six years old and sought help for the child. Mother was sure she\ncould provide Alice with all needed treatment if the child returned home.\n       The juvenile court sustained the petition. The court recited from the record and\nconcluded that “this family does not truly appreciate the severity of this issue nor are\nadequately equipped to address [Alice’s] mental health issues.” Despite all of the\n\n\n                                              6\n\fservices and therapy already in place, the family believed Alice was simply seeking\nattention and acting up, and that the solution was to bribe her to do her chores or to\nisolate her until she calmed down. The court cited the psychologists’ opinion that Alice\nneeded a stable home environment and to be understood. The court found that Alice was\nnot simply an incorrigible teenager, but a youth who needed help. The lack of structure\nin the home, the lack of understanding of Alice’s mental health issues, mother’s failure to\nfill Alice’s prescription for more than two weeks, and mother’s lack of parenting\neducation to help her support Alice’s mental health needs, put Alice at risk that the\nsituation could “escalate[] to a more dire level,” and turn Alice into a scapegoat. The\ncourt was mindful that mother had many services in place, but they did not help as Alice\nwas nonetheless hospitalized five times in less than a year, and mother requested that the\nchild be removed from mother’s care.\n       The court removed Alice from mother’s custody (§ 361, subd. (c)) and ordered her\nsuitably placed. The court ordered mother into an approved plan of parenting to address\ndevelopmentally appropriate issues, one-on-one classes to address children with mental\nillness, individual counseling to address family dynamics, dealing with mental health\nissues, and conjoint counseling. The court ordered the entire family to continue with\nNAMI, along with the other programs already in place. Mother was awarded monitored\nvisitation. Mother appealed.\n                                      CONTENTIONS\n       Mother contends that the jurisdiction and disposition findings lack substantial\nevidence.\n                                        DISCUSSION\n       1. The jurisdictional order is supported by substantial evidence.\n       Section 300, subdivision (b)(1), in pertinent part, describes a child who “has\nsuffered, or there is a substantial risk that the child will suffer, serious physical harm or\nillness, as a result of the failure or inability of his or her parent or guardian to adequately\nsupervise or protect the child” or “by the willful or negligent failure of the parent or\nguardian to provide the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, or medical treatment.”\n\n\n                                               7\n\fThe definition in subdivision (b) “consists of three elements: (1) neglectful conduct by\nthe parent in one of the specified forms; (2) causation; and (3) ‘serious physical harm or\nillness’ to the minor, or a ‘substantial risk’ of such harm or illness.” (In re Rocco M.\n(1991) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 820.) Although “evidence of past conduct may be probative\nof current conditions, the question under section 300 is whether circumstances at the time\nof the hearing subject the minor to the defined risk of harm.” (Id. at p. 824.)\n       “[S]ection 300 does not require that a child actually be abused or neglected before\nthe juvenile court can assume jurisdiction. [Section 300, subdivision (b)] require[s] only\na ‘substantial risk’ that the child will be abused or neglected. The legislatively declared\npurpose of [section 300] ‘is to provide maximum safety and protection for children who\nare currently being physically, sexually, or emotionally abused, being neglected, or being\nexploited, and to ensure the safety, protection, and physical and emotional well-being of\nchildren who are at risk of that harm.’ (§ 300.2, italics added.) ‘The court need not wait\nuntil a child is seriously abused or injured to assume jurisdiction and take the steps\nnecessary to protect the child.’ [Citation.]” (In re I.J. (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 773.)\n“[T]he court may . . . consider past events when determining whether a child presently\nneeds the juvenile court’s protection. [Citations.] A parent’s past conduct is a good\npredictor of future behavior. [Citation.] ‘Facts supporting allegations that a child is one\ndescribed by section 300 are cumulative.’ [Citation.] Thus, the court ‘must consider all\nthe circumstances affecting the child, wherever they occur.’ [Citation.]” (In re T.V.\n(2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 133.)\n       In an appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to justify a finding or\norder, we look for substantial supporting evidence, contradicted or uncontradicted. (In re\nHeather A. (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2267735\"><a href=\"/opinion/2267735/in-re-heather-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

When “making this determination, we\ndraw all reasonable inferences from the evidence to support the findings and orders of the\ndependency court; we review the record in the light most favorable to the court’s\ndeterminations; and we note that issues of fact and credibility are the province of the trial\ncourt. [Citation.]” (Ibid.) We do not reweigh the evidence or exercise independent\njudgment, or assess credibility (In re Casey D. (1999) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52); we\n\n\n                                              8\n\f“merely determine if there are sufficient facts to support the findings of the trial court.”\n(In re Matthew S.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">315</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 321.) Thus, the pertinent inquiry is\nwhether substantial evidence supports the finding, not whether a contrary finding might\nhave been made. (In re Dakota H. (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">212</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 228.)\n       Mindful of these rules, we conclude the record contains sufficient evidence to\nsupport the juvenile court’s finding that Alice is described by section 300, subdivision\n(b)(1) because she has suffered and is at substantial risk of suffering serious physical\nharm or illness as a result of mother’s “inability . . . to adequately supervise or protect”\nher. (Ibid.) The record shows, as the juvenile court found, that the instability and lack of\nstructure in the home, the failure to appreciate the gravity of Alice’s illness, the\nwithholding of medication, and the lack of education about parenting a mentally ill child,\nresulted in repeated hospitalization and physical abuse of Alice, and placed her at serious\nrisk of more harm, blame, and scapegoating.\n       Mother contends no parental unfitness or neglectful conduct placed Alice at risk.\nMother insists that she has a “very clear understanding of Alice’s mental health\nissues[. She has] educated herself and her children regarding Alice’s issues, and she had\na team in place working with Alice and the family.” However, not only has mother\nrepeatedly sought institutional help because she could not take care of Alice or control\nher behavior, but as the Department notes, two incidences of physical abuse, five\npsychiatric hospitalizations, three weeks without prescribed medication, and physical\nabuse by others in the home belie mother’s assertion she and the team can provide Alice\nwith needed care. What mother fails to comprehend is that even after Departmental\nintervention, TBS and FSP services, and repeated meetings, Alice continued to be\nhospitalized. Once placed, however, Alice received the needed consistency, was\ncompliant, got along well with others, and liked taking her medication.\n       In arguing there is no evidence of parental unfitness or neglect, mother relies on\nIn re Precious D.

Precious D. held “parental unfitness or\nneglectful conduct must be shown in order to assert dependency court jurisdiction under\nthat part of section 300(b) providing for jurisdiction based on the parent’s ‘inability . . . to\n\n\n                                               9\n\fadequately supervise or protect the child.’ ” (Id. at p. 1254.)3 In Precious D. the only\nfinding “critical of Mother’s parenting skills or conduct” in relation to her “incorrigible\nteenage daughter,” who repeatedly ran away from home and from foster placements\nduring a period of voluntary family maintenance, was that the mother and her daughter\nwere not communicating. (Id. at pp. 1253 & 1259.) The appellate court reversed the\nsection 300, subdivision (b) jurisdictional order for lack of evidence because the record\nshowed that the mother and daughter were in daily telephone contact and the Department\nrecognized that there was “ ‘open communication between the mother and the child.’ ”\n(In re Precious D., at p. 1259.) The Department admitted that the reason it sought\ndependency court jurisdiction was the child’s incorrigible behavior and need for court-\nordered services, not because of any neglectful conduct by the mother. In fact, the\nDepartment made no claim that the mother was unfit to parent her daughter. (Ibid.,\nfn. 2.)\n          Unlike Precious D., the record here contains ample evidence supporting the\nfinding of parental unfitness and neglect as well as willful failure to provide required\nmedication. Mother admitted she hits Alice because she cannot control her daughter.\nMother also failed to prevent others from hitting Alice. Rather than to rely on the advice\nof a psychiatrist, mother withheld prescribed medication from Alice in exercise of her\nclaimed parental right, and based on her own medical assessment that the prescribed\ndrugs were not good for Alice.4 The Department sought protection of the juvenile court\n\n3\n       The Department counters that we need not follow Precious D. because In re R.T.\n(2015) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">795</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, held that no showing of parental blame is required before a\ncourt may assert dependency jurisdiction over a child. However, apart from the fact that\nthe Supreme Court has granted review of In re R.T. on this very point (June 15, 2015,\nS226416), we conclude that Precious D. is distinguishable from this case and so we need\nnot rely on In re R.T.\n4\n       Mother insists she was not medically negligent because the treatment she was\nproviding to Alice was sufficient as evidenced by the fact the Department did not change\nthe protocol once voluntary services commenced. This argument ignores the opinion of\nthe Department of Mental Health psychologist that Alice had yet to receive an accurate\ndiagnosis.\n\n\n                                             10\n\ffor Alice because of mother’s neglect and unfitness demonstrated by her inability to care\nfor, protect, or control the child’s aggression and violence, and the need for court-ordered\nservices for mother. Unlike In re Precious D., a case of simply an incorrigible teenager\nand no evidence of parental unfitness or neglect, this case involves a seriously mentally\nill child who is a danger to herself and others, and parental unfitness, neglect, and failure\nto provide medication.\n       Mother argues, citing In re J.N. (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2256012\"><a href=\"/opinion/2256012/in-re-jn/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1014-1016, that one\nincident of withholding medication is insufficient to bring the child within the juvenile\ncourt’s jurisdiction. In re J.N. involved a single incident of parental unfitness, a drunk-\ndriving accident that injured the children (ibid.) and no evidence that the children were at\na risk of harm by the time of the jurisdictional hearing. (Id. at p. 1025.) Yet, the\nwithholding of medication is not the only incident of parental unfitness here. The\nwithholding in the past coupled with mother’s insistence at the jurisdiction hearing that\nshe knew what was good for Alice and that she was not required to give the child\nmedication “just because a doctor prescribes it,” evinces mother’s lack of understanding\nof what is needed for Alice and serves as a reliable predictor of mother’s future behavior.\n(In re T.V., supra, 217 Cal.App.4th at p. 133.) In sum, the cumulative record here reveals\nmultiple incidences of failure to protect, in addition to mother’s refusal to administer\nAlice’s prescribed medication, and supports the juvenile court’s finding that Alice is\ndescribed by section 300, subdivision (b).\n       2. The dispositional order is supported by substantial evidence.\n       Section 361, subdivision (c) directs, “[b]efore the court may order a child\nphysically removed from his or her parent, it must find, by clear and convincing\nevidence, that the child would be at substantial risk of harm if returned home and that\nthere are no reasonable means by which the child can be protected without removal.\n[Citations.]” (In re Cole C.

(c)(1).)\n       When “ ‘determining the appropriate disposition, the court shall receive in\nevidence the social study of the minor made by the probation officer, any study or\nevaluation made by a child advocate appointed by the court, and such other relevant and\n\n\n                                             11\n\fmaterial evidence as may be offered.’ [Citation.] This statutory command envisions that\nthe juvenile court will be provided with a broad spectrum of evidence shedding light on\nthe circumstances of the minor and his or her family. [Citation.] Of necessity, in\nvirtually every case, the court will have before it conduct or circumstances of family\nmembers not pleaded in the petition.” (In re Rodger H. (1991) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2179794\"><a href=\"/opinion/2179794/in-re-rodger-h/\"><span class=\"volume\">228</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(b).) “In this regard, the court may consider the parent’s\npast conduct as well as present circumstances. [Citation.]” (In re Cole C., supra,\n174 Cal.App.4th at p. 917.) Furthermore, the “parent need not be dangerous and the child\nneed not have been actually harmed for removal to be appropriate. The focus of the\nstatute is on averting harm to the child. [Citations.]” (Ibid.) “The court’s principal\nconcern is a disposition consistent with the best interests of the minor.” (In re Rodger H.,\nsupra, at p. 1183.)\n       While the juvenile court must make its finding under section 361, subdivision (c)\nby clear and convincing evidence, on appeal, we review the order for substantial\nevidence. (In re Christopher R. (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1210</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1216, fn. 4.)\n       Mother contends the removal order was not supported by substantial evidence.\nShe cites her testimony that she recently developed a treatment plan that is more thorough\nthan what had existed. She testified she, Alice, the behavioral specialist, therapists, and\nmother’s parent partner, developed a safety plan for responding to Alice’s violent\noutbursts and aggression. Mother argues, the juvenile court erred when it found there\nwas no reasonable alternative to removal.\n       Although mother insists she has recently developed a more complete plan to meet\nthe child’s needs, the record shows she also admitted in August 2014 that she could not\ncare for Alice even with more intensive services. Furthermore, the juvenile court took\njurisdiction over Alice because mother’s lack of understanding and insight into the\nseverity of Alice’s illness and her inability to address Alice’s behavior, even with in-\nhome services. The record is replete with references to Alice’s need for medication\nmanagement and for stability and structure. Mother’s reaction to Alice’s violence and\naggression, which she admitted she is unable to control, has been to hospitalize her\n\n\n                                             12\n\ftemporarily, hit the child, or segregate her, all of which conduct is unsafe and undermines\nthe stability, structure, and consistency that Alice needs. The Department and therapists\nhave explained that educating mother on how her actions play a role in Alice’s illness and\nbehavior is an important aspect of protecting the child. After Alice was removed from\nmother’s custody, the child was compliant, followed rules, posed no major problems, and\nfreely took her medication, without reservation. Therefore, there is sufficient evidence to\nsupport the juvenile court’s finding by clear and convincing evidence that returning Alice\nhome would put her at substantial risk of physical harm and there is no reasonable means\nby which the child can be protected without removal.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f                                     DISPOSITION\n      The orders appealed from are affirmed.\n\n\n      NOT TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE OFFICIAL REPORTS\n\n\n\n\n                                                ALDRICH, J.\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n\n             EDMON, P.
