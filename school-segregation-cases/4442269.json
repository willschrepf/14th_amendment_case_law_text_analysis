On the first day of trial, however, Appellant’s stipulated\n\nto the boundaries established by the 2012 order and stipulated that Appellants’\n\npiping encroached onto Appellee’s property. The parties further stipulated that\n\nAppellee owns the property located at 8609 Findlay Street and Appellants own the\n\nadjacent property located at 8514 Detroit Street.15 Despite Appellants’ allegations\n\nthat the stipulations were never reduced to writing or marked as exhibits, the\n\nstipulations were, in fact, read into the record at trial16 and were also written,\n\nadopted and executed by counsel and then marked as Court Exhibit 1.17\n\n             B.            Factual Background\n\n             At trial, Appellee testified that Appellants requested to take down a portion\n\nof her fence and fence posts in order to make repairs to an underground pipe. She\n\npermitted Appellants to do so provided that they re-install the fence and fence\n\nposts once their work was done. Unbeknownst to Appellee, Appellants placed\n\nunderground piping from their property onto Appellee’s property.

The letter also stated that fees and costs would be sought against her if\n\nAppellee failed to comply with counsel’s demand.19 The location of the fence then\n\nin dispute was only as a result of Appellant’s own moving of the fence.20 The\n\nrelationship between the parties continued to deteriorate, and the underlying suit\n\nensued.21\n\n       C.      Testimony as to Damages at Trial\n\n       As to the damages sought at trial, Appellee testified that in order to replace\n\nthe missing survey iron removed and discarded by Appellants and to reset the\n\nfence post, she incurred $972.68.22 Appellee further testified that Appellants had\n\ndamaged three (3) other fence posts on her property.23 Appellee’s expert Carl\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n18\n    RR 3:16-21; 24-25; RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 24; and RR 5g: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 8.\n19\n    RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 10; RR 3: 38-46.\n20\n    RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 11.\n21\n    CR 4–12.\n22\n    RR 3:48, 56.\n23\n    RR 3:53-56.\n\n!                                              5!\n\fJohnson testified that Appellee would incur $648.19 to reposition the fence post\n\nonto Appellee’s property and to replace and reset the other three (3) fence posts.24\n\n       Carl Johnson also testified that in order to correct Appellants’ encroaching\n\npiping by removing and rerouting same from Appellee’s property would cost\n\n$5,596.32 or $9,679.33, depending on the route taken.25\n\n       Appellee testified that she incurred at least $27,000 in attorney’s fees that\n\nwere paid by her father and which she would need to repay.26 This testimony was\n\nfurther supported by Appellee’s counsel, who testified that the reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees through April 2014 (preceding trial) were $25,700,27\n\nwhile fees through and post trial would be approximately another $15,000:\n\nbringing fees through trial and post-trial in the range of $52,000.28 Counsel also\n\ntestified that fees incurred for any appeal to the Court of Appeals and/or Supreme\n\nCourt would be an additional $15,000 and $10,000, respectively.29\n\n       Over the objection of Appellee’s counsel, Appellants’ counsel testified that\n\nhe incurred attorney’s fees in the amount of $53,425.22.30 Also over the objection\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n24\n    RR 3:123; RR 5a: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6A-1-a.\n25\n    RR 3:125-126; RR 5a: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6A-2; RR 5b: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6-A-3.\n26\n    RR 3:57-58.\n27\n    RR 3:138; RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibits 17 and 17A.\n28\n    RR 3:138-143.\n29\n    RR 3:141.\n30\n    RR 3:284-289; RR 4:7, 4:11.\n\n!                                              6!\n\fof Appellee’s counsel, Appellants’ newly produced fee invoices were submitted as\n\nDefendants’ Exhibits D-2 and D-2-A.31\n\n       D.     The Jury Charge\n\n       Appellants failed not only to object to the substance of the proposed jury\n\ncharge submitted by Appellee, but likewise failed to tender any proposed questions\n\nfor consideration by the court at the charge conference. 32 Appellants did not\n\nrequest a question to be submitted to the jury on their attorney’s fees and did not\n\nobject to the final jury charge’s omission of a question on their attorney’s fees.33\n\nAppellants did not object to Question 3 of the Charge, despite Appellants’\n\nallegations to the contrary, but instead objected generally to the granting of the\n\ndirected verdict, which was overruled by the trial court.34\n\n       E.     The Jury’s Verdict\n\n       After the court’s directed verdict on the issue of encroachment and the\n\ndeclaratory judgment action,35 the jury found that Appellants proximately caused\n\nthe occurrence in question and awarded $612.04 to replace and reposition the fence\n\npost, $486.15 to replace any other fence posts and $972.68 to replace and\n\nreposition the subject survey iron.36 The jury awarded $0.00 to Appellee for\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n31\n    RR 4:7, 11; RR 6: Defendants’ Exhibits D-2 and D-2-A.\n32\n    RR 4:41-43.\n33\n    RR 4:7-30; 41-43; CR 29-41.\n34\n    RR 4:41-43.!\n35\n    RR 3:32–38.\n36\n    CR 29–33.\n\n!                                            7!\n\fencroachment damages; $35,000 in attorney’s fees; $0.00 in attorney’s fees for any\n\nappeal to the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court; and did not find that Appellants\n\nacted with malice or that Appellee should be awarded punitive damages.37\n\n         F.      The Motion to Disregard Jury Findings and The Judgment\n\n       Appellee moved to disregard the jury’s award of $0.00 for encroachment\n\ndamages (based on the uncontroverted testimony of Carl Johnson that removing\n\nand rerouting the encroaching piping would cost at least $5,596.32)38 and the\n\nreduced attorney fee award of $35,000. 39 Appellants did not respond to the\n\nmotion. The trial court entered judgment awarding the non-challenged jury\n\nfindings and amending the encroachment damages and attorney’s fees to $5,146.32\n\nand $51,169.36, respectively.40\n\n                          SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       Appellants failed to preserve any error for appeal. As such, this appeal\n\nshould be denied in full.         Specifically, no error has been preserved to attack\n\nAppellee’s attorney’s fees and declaratory judgment action; no error has been\n\npreserved on the omission of Appellants’ attorney’s fees from the jury charge; and\n\nno error has been preserved on Appellee’s encroachment damages, and the trial\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n37\n    CR 34–41.\n38\n    RR 3:125-126; RR 5a: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6A-2; RR 5b: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6-A-3.\n39\n    CR 42-80.\n40\n    CR 84-86.!\n\n!                                              8!\n\fcourt’s judgment did not err as a matter of law. Therefore, this Court should\n\noverrule Appellants’ issue one.\n\n      Notwithstanding Appellants’ failure to preserve error, their appeal should\n\nfail for other reasons too.   First, the trial court properly awarded Appellee’s\n\nattorney’s fees against Appellants. To that end, (1) the underlying suit is not a\n\ntrespass to try title claim, but is a boundary dispute that is proper under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act (“DJA”), which allows for the recovery of attorney’s\n\nfees; (2) the “necessity” of fees is not a requirement in the question submitted to\n\nthe jury under the DJA; (3) segregation of Appellee’s attorney’s fees was not\n\nrequired, and the 2012 order as to the 2006 Survey did not fully resolve the\n\nproperty boundary and encroachment issues to limit attorney’s fees; and (4) the\n\ntrial court’s modification of Appellee’s attorney’s fees was unchallenged and\n\nproper, and this Court should overrule Appellants’ issue two.\n\n      Next, the trial court properly awarded Appellee’s encroachment damages\n\npursuant to its directed verdicts, which were based on Appellants’ own\n\nstipulations. Moreover, the evidence and testimony proffered by Appellee at trial\n\nregarding her encroachment damages was undisputed and uncontradicted by\n\nAppellants. Accordingly, the court’s modification of the jury award from $0 to the\n\namount proved at trial by Appellee was proper, and this Court should overrule\n\nAppellants’ issue three.\n\n\n\n!                                       9!\n\f             Lastly, the trial court properly denied Appellants’ attorney’s fees against\n\nAppellee by virtue of the court’s ruling on the directed verdicts and because\n\nAppellants neither tendered a question on their fees at the Charge Conference nor\n\nobjected to the exclusion of such a question. As such, this Court should overrule\n\nAppellants’ issue four.\n\n                                                           ARGUMENT\n\nI.           Reply to Issue One: Appellants failed to preserve any error for appeal on\n             Appellee’s claim, attorney’s fees and declaratory judgment action, and the\n             trial court’s judgment was not in error as a matter of law.\n!\n             A.            Appellants Failed to Preserve any Error for Appeal.\n\n             With respect to the award of attorney’s fees to Appellee, Appellants assert\n\nthat such an award was improper because even under the Declaratory Judgment\n\nAct (“DJA”), Section 37, et seq, attorney’s fees cannot be awarded in this type of\n\ncase, and if they could be, the “necessity” of the fees was not presented to the jury\n\nin the Charge.41 As to the issue of Appellants’ not being awarded attorney’s fees in\n\nthis matter, Appellants assert that the trial court refused to submit a jury question\n\nas to the Pugas’ fees.42 Lastly, Appellants claim that the award of encroachment\n\ndamages, as determined by the lesser of two estimates by Appellee’s expert (Carl\n\nJohnson) was not a proper method of calculating such damages, and therefore\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n41\n    Appellants’ Brief, 9-21.\n42\n    Appellants’ Brief, 21-22.\n\n!                                                             10!\n\fencroachment damages should not have been awarded.43 While the substantive\n\nmerits as to why these issues were properly ruled on by the trial court will follow\n\nin more detail below in the subsequent sections, the record establishes that\n\nAppellants failed to object to any of the foregoing to preserve these issues for\n\nappeal.\n\n1.          Appellants Failed to Preserve Error on Appellee’s claim, Attorney’s Fees\n            and Declaratory Judgment Action.\n\n            Throughout the course of the underlying trial, the continued tactics by\n\nAppellants’ counsel continued. Namely, the untimely submissions of required\n\ncourt filings and the disregard of Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.44 Appellee’s\n\nattorney’s fee question was submitted to the jury with no objection from\n\nAppellants—either as to the question itself or the substance and wording thereof.45\n\nMoreover, Appellants made no objection to the introduction of the evidence on\n\nAppellee’s total attorney’s fees, which included fee invoices and testimony as to\n\nthe reasonableness and necessity of same from the inception of this dispute through\n\ntrial and any appeal. Pursuant to Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 274,\n\n                       A party objecting to a charge must point out distinctly the\n                       objectionable matter and the grounds of the objection. Any\n                       complaint as to a question, definition, or instruction, on account\n                       of any defect, omission, or fault in pleading, is waived unless\n                       specifically included in the objections.\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n43\n    Appellants’ Brief, 22-24.\n44\n    RR 2:25, 2:27-29; RR 4:7, 4:9.\n45\n    RR 4:41-43; RR 4:49-51.\n\n!                                                          11!\n\f      More specifically, with respect to Appellants’ newly-raised argument that\n\nthe jury question lacked the term “necessary,” the Texas Supreme Court has found\n\nthat when, in a jury trial, a portion of an issue is “omitted without objection, Rule\n\n279 requires the issue be deemed as found by the trial judge in support of the\n\njudgment rendered.”46 Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 279 provides:\n\n            When a ground of recovery or defense consists of more than one\n            element, if one or more such elements necessary to sustain such\n            ground of recovery or defense, and necessarily referable thereto,\n            are submitted to and found by the jury, and one or more of such\n            elements are omitted from the charge, without request or\n            objection, and there is factually sufficient evidence to support a\n            finding thereon, ... such omitted element or elements shall be\n            deemed found by the court in such a manner as to support the\n            judgment.47\n\n      When the trial court has expressly submitted some issues and excluded\n\nothers, and neither party has put in writing a request for submission of those issues\n\nexcluded, they “must be regarded in the appellate court as having acquiesced in\n\nsuch action and consented for the trial judge to determine from the evidence the\n\nissue not submitted.”48 With no objection by Appellants to the date range, amount,\n\nlegal basis, form of the question or otherwise as to Appellee’s attorney’s fees, there\n\nwas no preservation of error for this appeal.49\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n46\n    Moore v.

The trial court based its directed verdict on\n\nAppellants’ own stipulation that they were encroaching on Appellee’s property.50\n\nAt no time did Appellants ever challenge Appellee’s pleadings seeking declaratory\n\nrelief or any of Appellee’s exhibits supporting same. Moreover, Appellants never\n\nchallenged Appellee’s claim for fees under the DJA.51 It is well-settled that a party\n\nwaives error if they “fail to properly except or otherwise raise the issue until after\n\nthe judgment is signed.” 52 Appellants neither specially excepted or otherwise\n\nobjected to either the declaratory judgment claims or the submission of Appellee’s\n\nfees. Additionally, while Appellants did object to the trial court’s granting of the\n\ndirected verdict, claiming general disagreement with the court’s ruling, they failed\n\nto object to the encroachment damage question.53 Appellants simply failed to\n\npreserve any error on Appellee’s claims for attorney’s fees and declaratory\n\njudgment.\n\n2.     Appellants Failed to Preserve Error Regarding their Claim for Attorney’s\n       Fees.\n\n       Appellants did not submit a proposed jury charge to the trial court. 54\n\nAppellants did not submit a proposed question on their claim for attorney’s fees.55\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n50\n    RR 2:17-19; 22-23.\n51\n    RR 2:22-25.\n52\n    Hudspeth v.

Alexender before the Judicial Section of the State\n   Bar of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n     “The rule here under consideration is intended to curb the abuses now prevailing in which some attorneys apparently\n     overload the record with unnecessary objections or requested issues, with the hope that the objection or request will\n     be sufficient to preserve the error and cause a reversal, but so concealed as to be overlooked by the trial court.\n\n     “It has long been the rule that an objection to a charge which is concealed in veiled and uncertain terms so that it does\n     not point out the objection clearly and specifically, and make the error reasonably apparent to the court, is insufficient.\n     It is believed that an objection that is concealed in a mass of immaterial and untenable objections, is as effectively\n     smothered and concealed as is one that is couched in veiled and uncertain language. If an attorney who has only one\n     or two valid objections can not point out such objections in less than ten or fifteen pages, the appellate court has a\n     right to assume that the attorney has not made a good-faith effort to call the errors to the attention of the court for the\n     purpose of having same corrected. Likewise, if he has only one or two valid requested issues and submerges them by\n     requesting a ‘bundle’ of issues, he must be held to have waived the error. It is the duty of the attorney as an officer of\n     the court to aid the court in bringing about a fair trial according to law. If he deserts his post and sets out to conceal\n     the errors and thus entrap the court, he must be held to have been ‘caught in his own trap.'\n\n     “The rule does not lay down any standard to be used for determining when the objections will be considered as too\n     long or the requested issues too numerous. Necessarily, no exact standard could be furnished. Obviously, a violation\n     of this rule will constitute a matter of degrees. It should be applied with caution, and considerable latitude should be\n     accorded in favor of good faith on the part of the attorney. It is designed to correct palpable abuses. A reasonable court\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               1\n\fRule 274. Objections and Requests, TX R RCP Rule 274\n\n\n    will have no difficulty in applying it. Trial judges should remember that the rule has been adopted for their protection\n    in those cases where they exercise good faith in an effort to discover the defects in the charge, but are unable to do\n    so. Judges should not rely on it as a justification for their own lethargy. They must yet exercise the highest degree of\n    caution to see that the case is properly submitted to the jury. Courts of Civil Appeals should resort to the rule in order\n    to justify an affirmance of the case only when the record discloses that the trial judge has been improperly imposed\n    upon by the attorney who seeks the reversal.\n\n    “When the trial judge is convinced that an attorney is attempting to conceal valid objections or requested issues by\n    unfounded objections or unnecessary requests, the judge should file with the clerk, and have brought up with the\n    record, a certificate showing the extent of the objections made and the number of issues requested, in order that the\n    appellate court may be able to view the matter from the same viewpoint as that which confronted the trial judge at\n    the time he was required to make his ruling.”\n\n    See also Rule 271, General Commentary.\n\n    Following is an excerpt from Stayton, Analysis of Changes, 4 Texas Bar J. 667 (1941), pertaining to the 1941\n    Amendment.\n\n    “In the rules upon submission of special issues, as has been already mentioned, it is required that the special issues\n    that are submitted must be raised by the written pleadings. This requirement was made because under rule 67, as has\n    been explained, the case could come up to the time of submission without any pleading at all or without pleading\n    upon numerous issues and could thus remit the court to the proof in order to ascertain the issues to be submitted.\n    Of course, this result could be avoided by objection when the testimony came in, but in the absence of objection\n    the proof instead of the pleading would present the issues. The desirability of a written guide for the judge has been\n    pointed out in 20 T.L.R. 21 and 22. The present amendment requires that by the time of submission any issues that\n    are submitted must be based upon written pleading. This means that if at that time written pleading is not at hand it\n    should be supplied by amendment. But here again, if the opposite party is content to have issues submitted that are\n    not raised by written pleading, e.g., if he does not object upon such a ground, the submission of issues not raised by\n    written pleading will not be error.”\n\n\nOPINIONS OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERPRETATION OF RULES\n   Defective pleadings\n\n    “Allegations of conclusions of law should be treated as good pleadings unless fair notice is not given by them and\n    should even then be considered as sufficient unless objection on that ground is made to them. See Rules 67, 70 and\n    274.” 6 Texas B.J. 77 (1943); 8 Texas B.J. 33 (1945).\n\n    Omission of pleading\n\n    “Issues submitted without written pleadings to support them will not be erroneous upon that ground unless objection\n    upon that ground is made.” 6 Texas B.J. 77 (1943); 8 Texas B.J. 33 (1945).\n\n    The decision of the Supreme Court in Bednarz v. State, 176 S.W.2d 562, in which a judgment largely in favor\n    of defendant was affirmed although defendant filed no answer whatever, does not mean that a written answer is\n    immaterial. Where such an omission occurs, plaintiff may have a default judgment or he may request the court to\n    require an answer to be filed. See Rules 90, 91, 268, 274 and 66. If plaintiff is content to try the matter without an\n    answer, he has no ground to complain. See Rule 67, 7 Texas B.J. 80 (1944); 8 Texas B.J. 43 (1945).\n\n    Appeals from justice to county court\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Objections and Requests, TX R RCP Rule 274\n\n\n\n\n    While the written pleadings in the county court are the pleadings upon which the case is tried, if the trial is upon\n    certain proof that is variant from or has no support in the written pleadings, but no objection or the like is made to\n    the variance or departure, Rule 67 applies and it will be as though there had been sufficient pleading. See also Rule\n    66 as to ready amendment if objection is made. Upon a special issue submission, “all pleadings relied upon in the\n    submission would have to be in writing, under Rules 67, 277, and 279, unless the defect should be waived under Rule\n    274.” 5 Texas B.J. 287 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 19 (1945).\n\n\n\nNotes of Decisions (790)\n\nVernon's Ann.

Dooley, “The Use of Special Issues Under the New State and Federal Rules,” 20\n   Texas L.Rev. 32 (1941).\n\n     Affirmative issues raised only by general denial\n\n     “The rules contain several provisions that have for their purpose the reduction of the number of issues that are to\n     be submitted to the jury. One field that has greatly extended the number of issues is what I designate as the field of\n     inconsistent theories. By this is meant the theories of the case that are inconsistent with plaintiff's theory of recovery,\n     or of the defendant's specially pleaded theory of defense, which under the present statute may be raised by a general\n     denial, and upon which the burden of proof is on the opposite party from the one relying on such inconsistent theory.\n     For example, in a suit to recover a broker's commission, the defendant, under a general denial, may present evidence\n     that another was the procuring cause of the sale, and if the evidence is sufficient to raise the issue he is entitled to have\n     a question thereon submitted to the jury. Similarly, the defendant under the general denial may raise, and be entitled to\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    have submitted to the jury, an issue as to whether the oral contract as actually made by the parties was different from\n    that alleged by plaintiff; or that the defendant bought ‘subject’ to the debt sued for, and did not ‘assume’ it as claimed\n    by plaintiff; or in a workmen's compensation case that the employee's present disability was caused by a prior illness\n    or disability; or in a tort case that the injury complained of was caused by an unavoidable accident. Numerous other\n    examples could be given if necessary. It should be noted that an answer to any of these issues submitting inconsistent\n    theories seldom forms a basis for a judgment for either the plaintiff or the defendant. As a general rule it serves only\n    as a basis for a conflict in the findings of the jury, and thus requires a new trial. For example, in a tort case liability or\n    non-liability would ordinarily depend upon the jury's finding of negligence or contributory negligence; and if a final\n    judgment is to be entered in favor of either party in such a case, it must be on the jury's findings in answer to these\n    issues. Where the jury finds either negligence or contributory negligence, a finding of the existence or nonexistence\n    of unavoidable accident would ordinarily not form the basis of a judgment for either party. At most, it would produce\n    a conflict and require a new trial. The same would be true of the jury's findings on any other inconsistent theory that\n    could be raised under the general denial.\n\n    “Touching the matter of these inconsistent theories, Rule 279 contains a very pertinent amendment. It provides that,\n    except in certain cases not here important, ‘A party shall not be entitled to an affirmative submission of any issue in\n    his behalf where such issue is raised only by a general denial and not by an affirmative written pleading on his part.'\n\n    “This provision is not intended to cut off a defendant's right to present inconsistent theories for the consideration of\n    the jury. He will still have a right to raise such issue by the evidence, and may use same in his argument to the jury\n    in an effort to induce the jury to find against plaintiff's theory of the case. But under the above rule he will not be\n    entitled to an affirmative submission of an issue on such inconsistent theory, unless he has affirmatively pleaded it.”\n    James P. Alexander, Lecture before Judicial Section, State Bar of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n    “Looking again at Rule 279, we find that the right of a defendant, as it now stands, to demand an affirmative\n    submission of any material defensive theory supported by the evidence, though raised only by a general denial, is set\n    aside, except in a few special actions; and in all ordinary suits a defendant, to preserve that right must affirmatively\n    plead the defense, as well as have supporting evidence. Any such theory, however, may still be raised as formerly by\n    a general denial, and that will suffice if the defendant is content to have the right simply to put in proof of his theory\n    and argue same to the jury in opposition to the plaintiff's theory of the case. In other words, a defendant by resort\n    to the necessary pleading, thus giving notice to the plaintiff, may still insist upon an affirmative submission of such\n    issues as unavoidable accident, or that the parol contract in issue was not in the terms alleged by the plaintiff, but in\n    certain other terms alleged by the defendant, and the numerous other catalogue of familiar defenses heretofore raised\n    in regular course under a mere general denial. The result doubtless, will be to expand defensive pleading, but that is\n    thought to be justified for the purpose of definite notice to the plaintiff.” J. B. Dooley, 20 Texas L.Rev. 37 (1941).\n\n    No reversal where “controlling issues” submitted\n\n    “Said Rule 279 further provides: ‘Where the court has fairly submitted the controlling issues raised by such pleading\n    and evidence, the case shall not be reversed because of the failure to submit other and various phases or different\n    shades of the same issue.’ The term ‘controlling issue’ is not defined, and is practically incapable of definition. The\n    term was used by the committee because of the lack of a better one. The object, purpose, and meaning of the rule can\n    be more easily illustrated than defined. A practice has grown up, particularly in tort cases, under which the plaintiff\n    charges the defendant with negligence on every theory capable of being drawn from the evidence, with the view of\n    making the defendant's conduct look as ugly as possible, and with the hope of securing a favorable finding from the\n    jury on at least one of such charges; and the defendant, for the same purpose, and with the added hope of securing\n    a conflict in the findings of the jury, replies in kind, but with more of it. When it comes time to submit the case to\n    the jury, each party insists that he is entitled to have each of such theories separately submitted. The result is that an\n    unnecessary multitude of issues is submitted to the jury. Take for example the case of the man who jaywalks across a\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                   2\n\fRule 279. Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    street at night and is injured by an automobile. There is only one controlling issue as to his contributory negligence,\n    and that is whether, under the circumstances, he was negligent in attempting to cross the street as he did at a place\n    other than a regular crossing. It should not be necessary to separately submit to the jury the issue as to whether he\n    was negligent in failing to cross at a regular crossing, or in failing to carry a red lantern, or in failing to wear a white\n    handkerchief around his neck, or in wearing a dark gray suit nearly the color of the street. These are but various phases\n    or different shades of the same issue. In a suit arising out of a highway collision the plaintiff often charges that the\n    defendant was on a wrong side of the road, and that he was driving in the center of the road, and that he failed to yield\n    one-half of the road. Obviously, the controlling issue is whether the defendant's automobile was traveling in whole\n    or in part on the wrong side of the road. If that issue is submitted, it will be unnecessary to submit the other issues as\n    to whether he was driving in the center of the road or failed to yield one-half of the road.\n\n    “Ordinarily, if the trial judge will examine his case carefully before beginning the preparation of his charge, he will be\n    able to reduce the case to a very few controlling issues. Under the above rule, when he fairly submits the controlling\n    issues, the case will not be reversed because of his failure to ‘pulverize’ the issues.” James P. Alexander, Lecture\n    before Judicial Section, State Bar of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n    “This rule makes plain provision for a check to curtail the number of issues submitted. The court need only submit\n    the ‘controlling issues,’ and, having done that, ‘the case shall not be reversed because of the failure to submit other\n    and various phases or different shades of the same issue.’ The objective of keeping the number of issues in a case\n    within reasonable bounds is also fortified in Rule 274, which penalizes, in the right to appellate complaint, a party\n    who swamps the trial court with numerous unnecessary requested issues tending to screen any particular requested\n    issue like the proverbial needle in a haystack.” J. B. Dooley, 20 Texas L.Rev. 37 (1941).\n\n    Tender of “substantially correct” requested issues and instructions\n\n    “It will be noted that Rule 279 provides in substance that the failure to submit an issue, define a term or give\n    an explanatory instruction shall not be reversible error, unless the issue, definition, or instruction is tendered in\n    substantially correct form by the party relying on such issue or requesting such definition or instruction. Heretofore\n    a party requesting a definition of a legal term was not required to provide the court with the form thereof. This rule\n    is now changed so that the party requesting the definition must tender the instruction which he desires to have given.\n    It will also be noted that the issue, definition, or instruction must be tendered in substantially correct form. This\n    does not mean that it must be absolutely correct, nor does it mean that one that is merely sufficient to call the matter\n    to the attention of the court will suffice. It means one that in substance and in the main is correct, and that is not\n    affirmatively incorrect.\n\n    “Again I call the trial judges' attention to the fact that this provision, as well as many others, is for the protection of\n    the trial judge. It is intended to enable him to secure the full co-operation of the attorneys, but it is not intended to\n    encourage a judge to neglect his responsibilities in the trial of the case. While a trial judge should never comment\n    on the weight of the evidence or otherwise indicate to the jury his opinion on the matters to be submitted to the jury,\n    yet this does not mean that he should permit himself to be relegated to the position of a mere moderator. He should\n    assume control of the trial and direct its course, and if in his opinion an instruction is necessary in order to meet the\n    ends of justice, he should see that such instruction is given, even though it is not requested in correct form, and even\n    though no reversible error would be presented if such instruction was not given.” James P. Alexander, Lecture before\n    Judicial Section, State Bar of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n    “The rule retains the present practice that a party has no standing for appellate complaint on the ground that the trial\n    court failed to submit an issue material to his cause of action or ground of defense, unless the party requested said\n    issue in substantially proper wording in the trial court, but rightfully qualifies the requirement by adding: ‘provided,\n    however, that objection to such failure shall suffice in such respect if the issue is one relied upon by the opposing party.'\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n\n\n    “The present practice is that a party may save the point by a mere objection to the failure of the court to submit a\n    proper explanation or definition pertinent to some term of technical meaning contained in the trial court's charge. The\n    new rule, changing the practice on that point, will make it necessary for the party who finds any fault with the failure\n    of the court to submit a definition or explanatory instruction to request a substantially correct definition or explanatory\n    instruction as a predicate for any appellate complaint, and as I read it, this requirement holds good whether the missing\n    definition or explanatory instruction relates to a question material to the complaining party's theory of the case or\n    material to the other party's theory of the case.” J. B. Dooley, 20 Texas L.Rev. 38 (1941).\n\n    Omitted issues and presumed findings\n\n    Speaking of the first sentence in the last paragraph of Rule 279, Judge Alexander says:\n\n    “This is substantially the rule as previously announced by the Supreme Court in the Pepper case. [Wichita Falls & O.\n    Ry. Co. v. Pepper, 134 Tex. 360, 135 S.W.2d 79 (1940)] It was not the intention of the committee to make any change\n    in the rule, but merely to announce it as it had been formulated by the Court. Under this rule, if a ground of recovery\n    or of defense is wholly ignored or neglected, and no issue is submitted or requested thereon, it will be held to have\n    been waived and no recovery or defense can be based thereon. If, however, the grounds of recovery or of defense\n    consist of more than one element--that is, require more than one issue to submit them--and the court submits some\n    of the elements but omits others, and there is no objection to the failure to submit same, the parties will be placed\n    in the position of having agreed to waive a jury trial on the unsubmitted elements and to have submitted them to the\n    court for his determination. Either party, after notice and before final judgment is rendered, may request the court\n    to make an express finding on such issues. In such an event the judge may find as he thinks the evidence justifies.\n    If he does not make such finding, then, on appeal, it will be presumed that the court found on such unsubmitted\n    elements in such manner as to support the judgment.” James P. Alexander, Lecture before Judicial Section, State Bar\n    of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n    “The above language (see last paragraph, Rule 279) describing when the court may make a finding on omitted issues\n    or such finding may be presumed seems to be a compound of what our courts have said in three well-known case.\n    [Wichita Falls & O. Ry. Co. v. Pepper, 1940, 134 T. 360, 135 S.W.2d 79; Ormsby v. Ratcliffe, 1928, 117 T. 242, 1\n    S.W.2d 1084; North v. Atlas Brick Co., Com.App.1929, 13 S.W.2d 59.]\n\n    “The rule seeks to clarify the practice governing presumed findings, but at the same time I see some room for serious\n    debate about the proper construction of the rule in certain instances. These possibilities are suggested by a decision\n    of the Court of Civil Appeals at Amarillo, in Texas Employers Insurance Association v. Reed. [Civ.App.1941, 150\n    S.W.2d 858, error dismissed.] That was a compensation suit. The testimony, as recognized by the appellate court, was\n    not conclusive, but at best only sufficient in the plaintiff's behalf to raise the issue of the existence of compensation\n    coverage applicable to plaintiff. The question of coverage was not submitted to the jury, but the omission was not\n    made a ground of objection, nor was any issue on the subject requested. The court disposed of the point in this far-\n    reaching language: ‘* * * In the instant case, however, we think the plaintiff has asserted but one ground of recovery\n    which as a whole constitutes the ultimate issue. Such ultimate issue is whether or not he is entitled to compensation\n    from the defendant for the injury suffered. This ultimate issue or ground of recovery is made up of several component\n    parts. Among these are in substance the following: (1) The sustaining of accidental injuries; (2) the sustaining of such\n    injuries in the course of his employment; (3) the extent of his injuries; (4) the duration of his injuries; (5) the coverage\n    of the injuries by the policy; and (6) the basis for compensation rate.\n\n    “‘The issue of coverage not being within itself an independent ground of recovery but being merely a component\n    part of the ultimate issue of plaintiff's right of recovery, and portions of such ultimate issue having been submitted,\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    it follows that the trial court, if there was evidence to sustain his action, was authorized to find upon the issue of\n    coverage in support of the judgment. * * *'\n\n    “The usual example used in discussing the subject of presumed findings is the series of questions involved in an\n    ordinary negligence case. These questions are: (1) whether the defendant did the act, or suffered the omission alleged;\n    and (2) whether such act or omission if found, was negligence; and (3) whether such negligence, if any, was the\n    proximate cause of injuries to the plaintiff. These are interdependent and kindred issues in a proper sense. They deal\n    with the same subject, that is, the alleged act or omission. The first relates to the existence of the subject, and if there\n    is an affirmative finding, then the second determines the quality of the subject, and the third determines the causal\n    consequences of the subject. The submission of any one of said issues is a partial submission of the whole inquiry\n    covered by the three affiliated issues. The submission of any one of said issues ought to bring any unsubmitted issue\n    of the group within the provision for presumed findings.\n\n    “The defense of estoppel similarly involves multiple elements naturally covered by a series of kindred issues dealing\n    in turn with, say, an alleged misrepresentation or concealment, and, if same was committed, then whether it was done\n    to mislead the other party and whether the latter was misled to his detriment.\n\n    “The well-known Pepper case furnishes another clear instance. The plaintiff sued for overflow damage to his cotton\n    crop. The trial court submitted the question of how many bales of cotton the plaintiff would have grown but for the\n    flood damage. The jury made a finding. The court failed to ask the jury how many bales of cotton the plaintiff actually\n    raised on the land. This last issue went unsubmitted without a request or objection. The two issues, one submitted\n    and the other unsubmitted, were clearly complementary in nature. They went to the same subject, the measure of\n    damages. The Supreme Court held a presumed finding on the unsubmitted issue, there being the necessary evidence,\n    was proper in support of the judgment.\n\n    “Similarly in the Reed case above mentioned, there is some reason to class certain of the issues enumerated by\n    the court as kindred issues. The series of issues covering the questions whether the plaintiff sustained accidental\n    personal injuries, and what incapacity, whether total or partial, resulted from any such injuries, and the duration of any\n    incapacity, make an affiliated set dealing with the subject of the plaintiff's injuries and ensuing results. The question,\n    however, whether there was a compensation insurance policy covering plaintiff's employment seems to be a separate\n    and distinct inquiry. Let us suppose a negligence suit brought by a plaintiff against a defendant-employer for injuries\n    sustained in a collision between an automobile occupied by plaintiff and a truck driven by a person alleged to have\n    been the defendant's servants in the course of his employment; and say that the evidence makes it a controverted issue\n    whether the driver of the truck was in fact the defendant's employee in the course of his employment at the time.\n    In submitting the case the court puts to the jury issues to determine whether the truck driver was guilty of the fault\n    alleged by plaintiff, and whether such act or omission, if done, was negligence, and whether such negligence, if any,\n    was the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries, but fails to submit any issue, and none is requested, to have the jury\n    find whether the truck driver was the defendant's servant acting in the course of his employment at the time of the\n    collision. In my opinion the general understanding of lawyers is that a judgment for plaintiff under said circumstances\n    could not be sustained by indulging a presumed finding that the driver was the defendant's servant in the due course\n    of his employment at said time. This for the reason that said question is an inquiry distinct and independent from\n    the questions submitted by the court. The Reed case, however, seems to point to the contrary. It apparently bears the\n    construction that whenever any material issue, even only one, is submitted and a verdict thereon is rendered, then,\n    given proper supporting evidence, any other issue or issues not submitted, nor covered by a request or objection, may\n    be made the subject of presumed findings; without any further limitation whatever in suits confined to a single alleged\n    cause of action and free of any affirmative defense, such as frequently found in partnership accounting, ordinary\n    actionable fraud, boundary, reformation, and workmen's compensation suits, and without limitation in more complex\n    suits except that in joining an actual jury finding and presumed findings it is not permissible to cross the line between\n    definitely separate and independent grounds of recovery or defense. That, as you will readily sense, would open up a\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    vista of new impetus to this procedural device. In passing, it may be said that there is another Court of Civil Appeals'\n    decision seemingly in conflict with the recent case above discussed. [Texas Employers' Ins. Ass'n v. Hilderbrandt,\n    Civ.App.1933, 62 S.W.2d 209].\n\n    “Under the express terms of Rule 279, the authority for a presumed finding on any unsubmitted issue belonging to a\n    given ground of recovery or defense depends upon there having been a submission of some other issue ‘necessarily\n    referable’ to that same ground of recovery or defense. This requirement seems to fit the case of an overlapping issue\n    common to two distinct and independent theories such as in a broker's suit brought both on express contract and\n    alternatively on implied contract, where the question of whether the plaintiff was the procuring cause of the deal is\n    material to a recovery on either express or implied contract. Then again, that part of the rule may reach a situation\n    suggested by the opinion in the Pepper case. Some of the illustrative language in that opinion could be construed\n    to mean that in a negligence case a partial submission covering an alleged ground of negligence would sustain a\n    presumed finding of the amount of damages, and vice versa. The damage issue, however, might be treated as simply\n    going to the plaintiff's remedy or redress for the wrong constituting his ground of recovery. The damage issue in\n    that sense could be regarded as separate from the literal ground of recovery. The point is that whatever damages the\n    plaintiff has suffered have been sustained regardless of negligence, vel non, and from that standpoint the question of\n    damages is not necessarily referable to any ground of recovery. The same thought may be brought out from another\n    direction. The plaintiff's suit may be based on two distinct grounds of negligence, and there may be proof in support\n    of each, but we will say only one of these grounds is submitted and the issue of damages again goes unsubmitted\n    without objection or request. Then it is evident that the question of damages is no more referable to the ground of\n    negligence submitted than to the ground not submitted.\n\n    “The said rule makes a new departure as far as formal provision is concerned regarding presumed findings, as the rule\n    permits the trial judge to make express findings where the circumstances are proper instead of leaving the questions\n    to the operation of presumed findings. The courts of Texas, however, have exercised this very power without express\n    authority in the statutes, [Ward v. Etier, 1923, 113 Tex. 83, 251 S.W.2d 1028] and so, after all, there is no real novelty\n    in the point. The provision, as I see it, is a very reasonable one. The provision for presumed findings must logically\n    rest upon the theory that there has been a waiver of jury trial in respect to the particular issues. The federal rules\n    which will be noticed presently contain a similar provision for presumed findings and expressly recognize that such\n    authority proceeds on a theory of waiver of jury trial upon such issues. Once the theory of waiver is admitted, then\n    in reason the court ought to be granted the right and power to make express findings. Express findings have a reality\n    while presumed findings are rather artificial. A logical consequence of the judge's right and power to make express\n    findings is that he is free to decide the particular issue either way, assuming a conflict in the evidence, and is not\n    bound to decide the issue in favor of the same party who has prevailed in the partial findings made by the jury. This\n    is not a new suggestion in Texas, and instead finds an example in a Supreme Court decision. [Nixon v. Hirschi, 1940,\n    134 Tex. 415, 136 S.W.2d 583]” J. B. Dooley, 20 Texas L.Rev. 39-43 (1941).\n\n    Following is an excerpt from Stayton, Analysis of Changes, 4 Texas Bar J. 667 (1941), pertaining to the 1941\n    Amendment.\n\n    “In the original text of the rule which gave a prescription for presumed findings in special issue situations there was\n    some wording that was not in accordance with the prescription established in the cases of Ormsby v. Ratcliffe, 117\n    Tex. 242, and Wichita Falls & Okla. Ry. Co. v. Pepper, 134 Tex. 360. Such wording has been eliminated, and the\n    prescription for presumed findings which is established in the cases above cited has been clearly announced.”\n\n\nOPINIONS OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERPRETATION OF RULES\n   Affirmative submission\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                                6\n\fRule 279. Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    The sentence: “A party shall not be entitled to an affirmative submission of any issue in his behalf where such issue\n    is raised only by a general denial and not by an affirmative written pleading on his part”, applies to so-called issues\n    that can be raised under the general denial. It does not refer to theories under affirmative pleading either of plaintiff\n    or of defendant, whether general or particular. In the latter respect the rules make no change from the former practice.\n    If, under the former practice, a plaintiff using general affirmative pleading was entitled to affirmative submission on\n    various phases of negligence he is still entitled to such submission, insofar as pleading is concerned. 5 Texas B.J.\n    288 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 21 (1945).\n\n    Appeals from justice to county courts\n\n    While the written pleadings in the county court are the pleadings upon which the case is tried, if the trial is upon\n    certain proof that is variant from or has no support in the written pleadings, but no objection or the like is made to the\n    variance or departure, Rule 67 applies and it will be as though there had been sufficient pleading. See also Rule 66 as\n    to ready amendment if objection is made. Upon a special issue submission all pleadings relied upon in the submission\n    would have to be in writing, under Rules 67, 277, and 279, unless the defect should be waived under Rule 274. 5\n    Texas B.J. 287 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 19 (1945).\n\n    Unavoidable accident\n\n    A defendant in a negligence case must specifically plead the issue of unavoidable accident to entitle him to an\n    affirmative submission of such issue. Defendant's right to present inconsistent defensive theories under the general\n    denial is not cut off by this Rule. He may introduce evidence on the point and argue to the jury that the injury and\n    damage to the plaintiff were the result of unavoidable accident, but if he desires an affirmative submission of such\n    issue, he must plead it. 5 Texas B.J. 236 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 17 (1945).\n\n    Lack of pleadings to support\n\n    “Issues submitted without written pleadings to support them will not be erroneous upon that ground unless objection\n    upon that ground is made.” 6 Texas B.J. 77 (1943); 8 Texas B.J. 33 (1945).\n\n    Burden of proof\n\n    This Rule does not change the burden of proof from what it would have been under the general denial. 5 Texas B.J.\n    236 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 17 (1945).\n\n\n\nNotes of Decisions (3338)\n\nVernon's Ann.

Reply to Issue Two: Appellee was entitled to recover attorney’s fees, in\n        whole or in part, as a matter of law.\n\nIII.    Reply to Issue Three: Appellee was entitled to recover encroachment\n        damages as a matter of law and the trial court properly awarded Appellee\n        encroachment damages against Appellants.\n\nIV.     Reply to Issue Four: The trial court did not err on the issue of Appellants’\n        attorney’s fees and the trial court properly denied Appellants’ attorney’s fees\n        against Appellee.\n\n                               STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\n        A.      Procedural Background\n\n        At the time of trial, Appellee sought damages from Appellants, including\n\nattorney’s fees and costs; the cost of removing an encroaching fence post; the cost\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n6\n   RR 2:17-19; RR 4: 32-39; RR 6: Court Exhibit 1.\n7\n   CR 29-41.\n8\n   CR 84-86.\n9\n   CR 95.\n\n!                                                  2!\n\fof replacing a survey iron Appellants removed from Appellee’s property; the cost\n\nto remove and re-route piping Appellants wrongfully installed on Appellee’s\n\nproperty; the cost to replace and install fence posts Appellants wrongfully removed\n\nfrom Appellee’s property; and a declaration as to the boundaries of Appellee’s\n\nproperty, that Appellee’s fence was not on Appellants’ property and that\n\nAppellants were encroaching onto her property. 10 Again, Appellants moved\n\nforward at trial under a general denial and blanket request for attorney’s fees.11\n\n       Leading up to trial, on April 2, 2012, Appellee sought a Motion to Enforce\n\nCourt Order, or in the Alternative, Motion to Order Survey in order to attempt to\n\nestablish the correct property boundaries of Appellee’s property: two boundary\n\nlines of which were relevant to establishing the boundary lines between Appellee\n\nand Appellants’ respective properties.12              The 2012 Motion to Enforce the 2006\n\nSurvey was necessitated by Appellants’ continued failure to conduct themselves\n\nreasonably or work toward any possible resolution of the underling disputes with\n\nAppellee, thereby also increasing Appellee’s attorney’s fees.13 Appellants failed to\n\nrespond to the motion, and an order granting the motion was entered on April 23,\n\n2012.14\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n10\n    CR 16-27.\n11\n    CR 14-15.\n12\n    Supplemental Clerk’s Record, hereafter SCR, 3-17.\n13\n    RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibits 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.\n14\n    SCR 18.\n\n!                                                3!\n\f             The issue of the disputed boundaries between Appellee and Appellant’s\n\nproperties, even in light of the court’s prior 2012 order, remained a highly\n\ncontested issue until trial. On the first day of trial, however, Appellant’s stipulated\n\nto the boundaries established by the 2012 order and stipulated that Appellants’\n\npiping encroached onto Appellee’s property. The parties further stipulated that\n\nAppellee owns the property located at 8609 Findlay Street and Appellants own the\n\nadjacent property located at 8514 Detroit Street.15 Despite Appellants’ allegations\n\nthat the stipulations were never reduced to writing or marked as exhibits, the\n\nstipulations were, in fact, read into the record at trial16 and were also written,\n\nadopted and executed by counsel and then marked as Court Exhibit 1.17\n\n             B.            Factual Background\n\n             At trial, Appellee testified that Appellants requested to take down a portion\n\nof her fence and fence posts in order to make repairs to an underground pipe. She\n\npermitted Appellants to do so provided that they re-install the fence and fence\n\nposts once their work was done. Unbeknownst to Appellee, Appellants placed\n\nunderground piping from their property onto Appellee’s property. Appellants\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n15\n    RR 2:19.\n16\n    RR 2:19.\n17\n    RR 6: Court Exhibit 1.\n\n!                                                          4!\n\freplaced one of Appellee’s fence posts (as depicted in Appellee’s Exhibits 8 and\n\n24) on their own property.18\n\n       Appellee further testified that years later, in October 2010, Appellants’\n\nattorney sent a letter to Appellee threatening immediate litigation and demanding\n\nthat Appellee remove her fence as it encroached six (6) inches onto Appellants’\n\nproperty. The letter also stated that fees and costs would be sought against her if\n\nAppellee failed to comply with counsel’s demand.19 The location of the fence then\n\nin dispute was only as a result of Appellant’s own moving of the fence.20 The\n\nrelationship between the parties continued to deteriorate, and the underlying suit\n\nensued.21\n\n       C.      Testimony as to Damages at Trial\n\n       As to the damages sought at trial, Appellee testified that in order to replace\n\nthe missing survey iron removed and discarded by Appellants and to reset the\n\nfence post, she incurred $972.68.22 Appellee further testified that Appellants had\n\ndamaged three (3) other fence posts on her property.23 Appellee’s expert Carl\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n18\n    RR 3:16-21; 24-25; RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 24; and RR 5g: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 8.\n19\n    RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 10; RR 3: 38-46.\n20\n    RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 11.\n21\n    CR 4–12.\n22\n    RR 3:48, 56.\n23\n    RR 3:53-56.\n\n!                                              5!\n\fJohnson testified that Appellee would incur $648.19 to reposition the fence post\n\nonto Appellee’s property and to replace and reset the other three (3) fence posts.24\n\n       Carl Johnson also testified that in order to correct Appellants’ encroaching\n\npiping by removing and rerouting same from Appellee’s property would cost\n\n$5,596.32 or $9,679.33, depending on the route taken.25\n\n       Appellee testified that she incurred at least $27,000 in attorney’s fees that\n\nwere paid by her father and which she would need to repay.26 This testimony was\n\nfurther supported by Appellee’s counsel, who testified that the reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorney’s fees through April 2014 (preceding trial) were $25,700,27\n\nwhile fees through and post trial would be approximately another $15,000:\n\nbringing fees through trial and post-trial in the range of $52,000.28 Counsel also\n\ntestified that fees incurred for any appeal to the Court of Appeals and/or Supreme\n\nCourt would be an additional $15,000 and $10,000, respectively.29\n\n       Over the objection of Appellee’s counsel, Appellants’ counsel testified that\n\nhe incurred attorney’s fees in the amount of $53,425.22.30 Also over the objection\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n24\n    RR 3:123; RR 5a: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6A-1-a.\n25\n    RR 3:125-126; RR 5a: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6A-2; RR 5b: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6-A-3.\n26\n    RR 3:57-58.\n27\n    RR 3:138; RR 5h: Plaintiff’s Exhibits 17 and 17A.\n28\n    RR 3:138-143.\n29\n    RR 3:141.\n30\n    RR 3:284-289; RR 4:7, 4:11.\n\n!                                              6!\n\fof Appellee’s counsel, Appellants’ newly produced fee invoices were submitted as\n\nDefendants’ Exhibits D-2 and D-2-A.31\n\n       D.     The Jury Charge\n\n       Appellants failed not only to object to the substance of the proposed jury\n\ncharge submitted by Appellee, but likewise failed to tender any proposed questions\n\nfor consideration by the court at the charge conference. 32 Appellants did not\n\nrequest a question to be submitted to the jury on their attorney’s fees and did not\n\nobject to the final jury charge’s omission of a question on their attorney’s fees.33\n\nAppellants did not object to Question 3 of the Charge, despite Appellants’\n\nallegations to the contrary, but instead objected generally to the granting of the\n\ndirected verdict, which was overruled by the trial court.34\n\n       E.     The Jury’s Verdict\n\n       After the court’s directed verdict on the issue of encroachment and the\n\ndeclaratory judgment action,35 the jury found that Appellants proximately caused\n\nthe occurrence in question and awarded $612.04 to replace and reposition the fence\n\npost, $486.15 to replace any other fence posts and $972.68 to replace and\n\nreposition the subject survey iron.36 The jury awarded $0.00 to Appellee for\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n31\n    RR 4:7, 11; RR 6: Defendants’ Exhibits D-2 and D-2-A.\n32\n    RR 4:41-43.\n33\n    RR 4:7-30; 41-43; CR 29-41.\n34\n    RR 4:41-43.!\n35\n    RR 3:32–38.\n36\n    CR 29–33.\n\n!                                            7!\n\fencroachment damages; $35,000 in attorney’s fees; $0.00 in attorney’s fees for any\n\nappeal to the Court of Appeals or Supreme Court; and did not find that Appellants\n\nacted with malice or that Appellee should be awarded punitive damages.37\n\n         F.      The Motion to Disregard Jury Findings and The Judgment\n\n       Appellee moved to disregard the jury’s award of $0.00 for encroachment\n\ndamages (based on the uncontroverted testimony of Carl Johnson that removing\n\nand rerouting the encroaching piping would cost at least $5,596.32)38 and the\n\nreduced attorney fee award of $35,000. 39 Appellants did not respond to the\n\nmotion. The trial court entered judgment awarding the non-challenged jury\n\nfindings and amending the encroachment damages and attorney’s fees to $5,146.32\n\nand $51,169.36, respectively.40\n\n                          SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       Appellants failed to preserve any error for appeal. As such, this appeal\n\nshould be denied in full.         Specifically, no error has been preserved to attack\n\nAppellee’s attorney’s fees and declaratory judgment action; no error has been\n\npreserved on the omission of Appellants’ attorney’s fees from the jury charge; and\n\nno error has been preserved on Appellee’s encroachment damages, and the trial\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n37\n    CR 34–41.\n38\n    RR 3:125-126; RR 5a: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6A-2; RR 5b: Plaintiff’s Exhibit 6-A-3.\n39\n    CR 42-80.\n40\n    CR 84-86.!\n\n!                                              8!\n\fcourt’s judgment did not err as a matter of law. Therefore, this Court should\n\noverrule Appellants’ issue one.\n\n      Notwithstanding Appellants’ failure to preserve error, their appeal should\n\nfail for other reasons too.   First, the trial court properly awarded Appellee’s\n\nattorney’s fees against Appellants. To that end, (1) the underlying suit is not a\n\ntrespass to try title claim, but is a boundary dispute that is proper under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgment Act (“DJA”), which allows for the recovery of attorney’s\n\nfees; (2) the “necessity” of fees is not a requirement in the question submitted to\n\nthe jury under the DJA; (3) segregation of Appellee’s attorney’s fees was not\n\nrequired, and the 2012 order as to the 2006 Survey did not fully resolve the\n\nproperty boundary and encroachment issues to limit attorney’s fees; and (4) the\n\ntrial court’s modification of Appellee’s attorney’s fees was unchallenged and\n\nproper, and this Court should overrule Appellants’ issue two.\n\n      Next, the trial court properly awarded Appellee’s encroachment damages\n\npursuant to its directed verdicts, which were based on Appellants’ own\n\nstipulations. Moreover, the evidence and testimony proffered by Appellee at trial\n\nregarding her encroachment damages was undisputed and uncontradicted by\n\nAppellants. Accordingly, the court’s modification of the jury award from $0 to the\n\namount proved at trial by Appellee was proper, and this Court should overrule\n\nAppellants’ issue three.\n\n\n\n!                                       9!\n\f             Lastly, the trial court properly denied Appellants’ attorney’s fees against\n\nAppellee by virtue of the court’s ruling on the directed verdicts and because\n\nAppellants neither tendered a question on their fees at the Charge Conference nor\n\nobjected to the exclusion of such a question. As such, this Court should overrule\n\nAppellants’ issue four.\n\n                                                           ARGUMENT\n\nI.           Reply to Issue One: Appellants failed to preserve any error for appeal on\n             Appellee’s claim, attorney’s fees and declaratory judgment action, and the\n             trial court’s judgment was not in error as a matter of law.\n!\n             A.            Appellants Failed to Preserve any Error for Appeal.\n\n             With respect to the award of attorney’s fees to Appellee, Appellants assert\n\nthat such an award was improper because even under the Declaratory Judgment\n\nAct (“DJA”), Section 37, et seq, attorney’s fees cannot be awarded in this type of\n\ncase, and if they could be, the “necessity” of the fees was not presented to the jury\n\nin the Charge.41 As to the issue of Appellants’ not being awarded attorney’s fees in\n\nthis matter, Appellants assert that the trial court refused to submit a jury question\n\nas to the Pugas’ fees.42 Lastly, Appellants claim that the award of encroachment\n\ndamages, as determined by the lesser of two estimates by Appellee’s expert (Carl\n\nJohnson) was not a proper method of calculating such damages, and therefore\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n41\n    Appellants’ Brief, 9-21.\n42\n    Appellants’ Brief, 21-22.\n\n!                                                             10!\n\fencroachment damages should not have been awarded.43 While the substantive\n\nmerits as to why these issues were properly ruled on by the trial court will follow\n\nin more detail below in the subsequent sections, the record establishes that\n\nAppellants failed to object to any of the foregoing to preserve these issues for\n\nappeal.\n\n1.          Appellants Failed to Preserve Error on Appellee’s claim, Attorney’s Fees\n            and Declaratory Judgment Action.\n\n            Throughout the course of the underlying trial, the continued tactics by\n\nAppellants’ counsel continued.

Segregation of Appellee’s attorney’s fees was not required, and the 2012\n       Order as to the 2006 Survey did not fully resolve the property boundary and\n       encroachment issues to limit attorney’s fees.\n\n       First, no objection to the presentation or submission of Appellee’s fees, in\n\ntotal, was made or error preserved by Appellants.91 An objection to a alleged\n\nparty’s failure to segregate attorney’s fees must be made by the party opposing the\n\nfees, and the party asserting fees must refuse to segregate, in order for the\n\nsegregation of fees to be considered on appeal.92 Nevertheless, had the foregoing\n\nactually occurred, which it did not, segregation of fees is not required here. A\n\nrecognized exception to segregation of fees exists when the party’s attorney’s fees\n\nare “in connection with claims arising out of the same transaction and are so\n\ninterrelated that their ‘prosecution and defense entails proof or denial of essentially\n\nthe same facts.’”93 There was no distinction between the acts of the Defendants,\n\nand the overlap of facts between the declaratory judgment and negligence claim is\n\nindistinguishable such that attorney’s fees are not capable of segregation. 94\n\nTherefore, because Appellee’s claims are based upon the same set of facts and\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n91\n    RR 4:41-43; 49-51; RR 3:138-68.\n92\n    Stewart Title Guar.

Moreover, the issue of boundaries and encroachment was very much a\n\ndisputed issue between the parties, up until and through trial.97 While Appellants\n\nargue that the “only” finding that addressed the declaratory judgment claim must\n\nhave been the April 23, 201298 order, they brazenly overlook the parties’ own\n\nstipulations on this issue and the trial court’s directed verdict as to same, both of\n\nwhich were entered after trial had commenced.99 Despite the Court’s 2012 order\n\nestablishing the boundaries of Appellee’s property and her neighbor’s property (a\n\nnon-party to the underlying action), 100 the issue of Appellee and Appellants’\n\nproperty boundaries and any encroachment by one or the other onto the other’s\n\nrespective property was a critical issue still contested up until the trial on this\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n95\n    Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d at 11.\n96\n    Appellants’ Brief, 18-21.\n97\n    The 2012 Motion to Enforce the 2006 Survey was necessitated by Appellants’ continued\nfailure to conduct themselves reasonably or work toward any possible resolution of the underling\ndisputes with Appellee, thereby also increasing Appellee’s attorney’s fees; RR 5h: Plaintiff’s\nExhibits 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15.\n98\n    SCR:12.\n99\n    RR 2:17-19; RR 4:32-38; 6: Court Exhibit 1.\n100\n      SCR: 12.\n\n!                                             22!\n\fmatter. 101    As such, the 2012 order did not address the boundary and\n\nencroachment-related declaratory judgment claims to resolve all disputes in this\n\nmatter, such that an award of attorney’s fees related to those claims after the 2012\n\norder was proper. Accordingly, any request to reduce or cap Appellee’s attorney’s\n\nfees must fail.\n\n4.     The trial court’s modification of Appellee’s attorney’s fees was proper.\n\n       Subject to the preceding analysis as to the award of attorney’s fees to\n\nAppellee by the trial court as equitable and just, the trial court’s modification of the\n\nfees was appropriate. A jury’s award of substantially less attorney’s fees is\n\nimproper where the party seeking recovery offers evidence of the attorney’s fees\n\nincurred and the value thereof.102 Where, as here, the moving party offers evidence\n\nof attorney’s fees, a jury’s answer awarding substantially less is improper and may\n\nbe rejected by the trial court: the ultimate award of which rests solely with the trial\n\ncourt. 103 Because Appellee introduced attorney’s fee testimony as to the\n\nreasonableness and necessity of attorney’s fees through trial and post trial motions,\n\nuncontradicted by Appellants, the jury improperly awarded a lesser amount\n\nunsupported by the evidence.104 When the evidence is clear and direct and not\n\ncontradicted by any other witness, it is improper for a fee award not to comport\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n101\n      RR 2:17-19; RR 4:32-38; 6: Court Exhibit 1.\n102\n      Midland W.

Reply to Issue Three: Appellee was entitled to recover encroachment\n       damages as a matter of law and the trial court properly awarded Appellee\n       encroachment damages against Appellants.\n\n       Appellants assert that encroachment damages, as found by the trial court in\n\nthe Final Judgment of $5,146.32,107 which modified the jury’s findings of $0.00,108\n\nwas an abuse of discretion. 109 Their argument seems to suggest that it was\n\nimproper for Appellee’s expert (an estimator) to testify and offer evidence that two\n\npossible methods of removal could be used to remove the Appellants’ encroaching\n\npipe from Appellee’s property. 110 This expert testimony and evidence was\n\nuncontroverted by Appellants and they failed to disclose, designate, call or\n\notherwise offer any controverting expert or evidence.111 Appellee’s expert, Carl\n\nJohnson, offered testimony that two possible methods of pipe removal could be\n\nimplemented to remove the offending and encroaching pipe: one being more\n\ninvasive, and more costly, than the other in the respective amounts of $5,146.32\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n105\n      Ragsdale v.

The\n\nend result of removing the pipe and curing the encroachment is the unified purpose\n\nof both estimates. Further, a jury may not award $0.00 when doing so is against\n\nundisputed evidence.122 Similar to a party’s available election of the most favorable\n\ntheory of recovery,123 Appellee was entitled to elect under which scenario of\n\nremoval she wished to proceed: she chose the less expensive of the two methods\n\n($5,146.32) and sought modification of the $0.00 award for that amount.124\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion in modifying the jury’s answer of\n\n$0.00 for encroachment damages because the evidence and testimony\n\noverwhelmingly and undisputedly supported a finding of at least $5,146.32.125 As\n\nsuch, the court should deny any challenge to this award.\n\n\n\n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n120\n      Cardiac Perfusion Serv.

Alexender before the Judicial Section of the State\n   Bar of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n     “The rule here under consideration is intended to curb the abuses now prevailing in which some attorneys apparently\n     overload the record with unnecessary objections or requested issues, with the hope that the objection or request will\n     be sufficient to preserve the error and cause a reversal, but so concealed as to be overlooked by the trial court.\n\n     “It has long been the rule that an objection to a charge which is concealed in veiled and uncertain terms so that it does\n     not point out the objection clearly and specifically, and make the error reasonably apparent to the court, is insufficient.\n     It is believed that an objection that is concealed in a mass of immaterial and untenable objections, is as effectively\n     smothered and concealed as is one that is couched in veiled and uncertain language. If an attorney who has only one\n     or two valid objections can not point out such objections in less than ten or fifteen pages, the appellate court has a\n     right to assume that the attorney has not made a good-faith effort to call the errors to the attention of the court for the\n     purpose of having same corrected. Likewise, if he has only one or two valid requested issues and submerges them by\n     requesting a ‘bundle’ of issues, he must be held to have waived the error. It is the duty of the attorney as an officer of\n     the court to aid the court in bringing about a fair trial according to law. If he deserts his post and sets out to conceal\n     the errors and thus entrap the court, he must be held to have been ‘caught in his own trap.'\n\n     “The rule does not lay down any standard to be used for determining when the objections will be considered as too\n     long or the requested issues too numerous. Necessarily, no exact standard could be furnished. Obviously, a violation\n     of this rule will constitute a matter of degrees. It should be applied with caution, and considerable latitude should be\n     accorded in favor of good faith on the part of the attorney. It is designed to correct palpable abuses. A reasonable court\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                                               1\n\fRule 274. Objections and Requests, TX R RCP Rule 274\n\n\n    will have no difficulty in applying it. Trial judges should remember that the rule has been adopted for their protection\n    in those cases where they exercise good faith in an effort to discover the defects in the charge, but are unable to do\n    so. Judges should not rely on it as a justification for their own lethargy. They must yet exercise the highest degree of\n    caution to see that the case is properly submitted to the jury. Courts of Civil Appeals should resort to the rule in order\n    to justify an affirmance of the case only when the record discloses that the trial judge has been improperly imposed\n    upon by the attorney who seeks the reversal.\n\n    “When the trial judge is convinced that an attorney is attempting to conceal valid objections or requested issues by\n    unfounded objections or unnecessary requests, the judge should file with the clerk, and have brought up with the\n    record, a certificate showing the extent of the objections made and the number of issues requested, in order that the\n    appellate court may be able to view the matter from the same viewpoint as that which confronted the trial judge at\n    the time he was required to make his ruling.”\n\n    See also Rule 271, General Commentary.\n\n    Following is an excerpt from Stayton, Analysis of Changes, 4 Texas Bar J. 667 (1941), pertaining to the 1941\n    Amendment.\n\n    “In the rules upon submission of special issues, as has been already mentioned, it is required that the special issues\n    that are submitted must be raised by the written pleadings. This requirement was made because under rule 67, as has\n    been explained, the case could come up to the time of submission without any pleading at all or without pleading\n    upon numerous issues and could thus remit the court to the proof in order to ascertain the issues to be submitted.\n    Of course, this result could be avoided by objection when the testimony came in, but in the absence of objection\n    the proof instead of the pleading would present the issues. The desirability of a written guide for the judge has been\n    pointed out in 20 T.L.R. 21 and 22. The present amendment requires that by the time of submission any issues that\n    are submitted must be based upon written pleading. This means that if at that time written pleading is not at hand it\n    should be supplied by amendment. But here again, if the opposite party is content to have issues submitted that are\n    not raised by written pleading, e.g., if he does not object upon such a ground, the submission of issues not raised by\n    written pleading will not be error.”\n\n\nOPINIONS OF SUBCOMMITTEE ON INTERPRETATION OF RULES\n   Defective pleadings\n\n    “Allegations of conclusions of law should be treated as good pleadings unless fair notice is not given by them and\n    should even then be considered as sufficient unless objection on that ground is made to them.

One field that has greatly extended the number of issues is what I designate as the field of\n     inconsistent theories. By this is meant the theories of the case that are inconsistent with plaintiff's theory of recovery,\n     or of the defendant's specially pleaded theory of defense, which under the present statute may be raised by a general\n     denial, and upon which the burden of proof is on the opposite party from the one relying on such inconsistent theory.\n     For example, in a suit to recover a broker's commission, the defendant, under a general denial, may present evidence\n     that another was the procuring cause of the sale, and if the evidence is sufficient to raise the issue he is entitled to have\n     a question thereon submitted to the jury. Similarly, the defendant under the general denial may raise, and be entitled to\n\n\n\n                 © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    have submitted to the jury, an issue as to whether the oral contract as actually made by the parties was different from\n    that alleged by plaintiff; or that the defendant bought ‘subject’ to the debt sued for, and did not ‘assume’ it as claimed\n    by plaintiff; or in a workmen's compensation case that the employee's present disability was caused by a prior illness\n    or disability; or in a tort case that the injury complained of was caused by an unavoidable accident. Numerous other\n    examples could be given if necessary. It should be noted that an answer to any of these issues submitting inconsistent\n    theories seldom forms a basis for a judgment for either the plaintiff or the defendant. As a general rule it serves only\n    as a basis for a conflict in the findings of the jury, and thus requires a new trial. For example, in a tort case liability or\n    non-liability would ordinarily depend upon the jury's finding of negligence or contributory negligence; and if a final\n    judgment is to be entered in favor of either party in such a case, it must be on the jury's findings in answer to these\n    issues. Where the jury finds either negligence or contributory negligence, a finding of the existence or nonexistence\n    of unavoidable accident would ordinarily not form the basis of a judgment for either party. At most, it would produce\n    a conflict and require a new trial. The same would be true of the jury's findings on any other inconsistent theory that\n    could be raised under the general denial.\n\n    “Touching the matter of these inconsistent theories, Rule 279 contains a very pertinent amendment. It provides that,\n    except in certain cases not here important, ‘A party shall not be entitled to an affirmative submission of any issue in\n    his behalf where such issue is raised only by a general denial and not by an affirmative written pleading on his part.'\n\n    “This provision is not intended to cut off a defendant's right to present inconsistent theories for the consideration of\n    the jury. He will still have a right to raise such issue by the evidence, and may use same in his argument to the jury\n    in an effort to induce the jury to find against plaintiff's theory of the case. But under the above rule he will not be\n    entitled to an affirmative submission of an issue on such inconsistent theory, unless he has affirmatively pleaded it.”\n    James P. Alexander, Lecture before Judicial Section, State Bar of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n    “Looking again at Rule 279, we find that the right of a defendant, as it now stands, to demand an affirmative\n    submission of any material defensive theory supported by the evidence, though raised only by a general denial, is set\n    aside, except in a few special actions; and in all ordinary suits a defendant, to preserve that right must affirmatively\n    plead the defense, as well as have supporting evidence. Any such theory, however, may still be raised as formerly by\n    a general denial, and that will suffice if the defendant is content to have the right simply to put in proof of his theory\n    and argue same to the jury in opposition to the plaintiff's theory of the case. In other words, a defendant by resort\n    to the necessary pleading, thus giving notice to the plaintiff, may still insist upon an affirmative submission of such\n    issues as unavoidable accident, or that the parol contract in issue was not in the terms alleged by the plaintiff, but in\n    certain other terms alleged by the defendant, and the numerous other catalogue of familiar defenses heretofore raised\n    in regular course under a mere general denial. The result doubtless, will be to expand defensive pleading, but that is\n    thought to be justified for the purpose of definite notice to the plaintiff.” J. B. Dooley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex. L. Rev.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1941).\n\n    No reversal where “controlling issues” submitted\n\n    “Said Rule 279 further provides: ‘Where the court has fairly submitted the controlling issues raised by such pleading\n    and evidence, the case shall not be reversed because of the failure to submit other and various phases or different\n    shades of the same issue.’ The term ‘controlling issue’ is not defined, and is practically incapable of definition. The\n    term was used by the committee because of the lack of a better one. The object, purpose, and meaning of the rule can\n    be more easily illustrated than defined. A practice has grown up, particularly in tort cases, under which the plaintiff\n    charges the defendant with negligence on every theory capable of being drawn from the evidence, with the view of\n    making the defendant's conduct look as ugly as possible, and with the hope of securing a favorable finding from the\n    jury on at least one of such charges; and the defendant, for the same purpose, and with the added hope of securing\n    a conflict in the findings of the jury, replies in kind, but with more of it. When it comes time to submit the case to\n    the jury, each party insists that he is entitled to have each of such theories separately submitted. The result is that an\n    unnecessary multitude of issues is submitted to the jury. Take for example the case of the man who jaywalks across a\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

There is only one controlling issue as to his contributory negligence,\n    and that is whether, under the circumstances, he was negligent in attempting to cross the street as he did at a place\n    other than a regular crossing. It should not be necessary to separately submit to the jury the issue as to whether he\n    was negligent in failing to cross at a regular crossing, or in failing to carry a red lantern, or in failing to wear a white\n    handkerchief around his neck, or in wearing a dark gray suit nearly the color of the street. These are but various phases\n    or different shades of the same issue. In a suit arising out of a highway collision the plaintiff often charges that the\n    defendant was on a wrong side of the road, and that he was driving in the center of the road, and that he failed to yield\n    one-half of the road. Obviously, the controlling issue is whether the defendant's automobile was traveling in whole\n    or in part on the wrong side of the road. If that issue is submitted, it will be unnecessary to submit the other issues as\n    to whether he was driving in the center of the road or failed to yield one-half of the road.\n\n    “Ordinarily, if the trial judge will examine his case carefully before beginning the preparation of his charge, he will be\n    able to reduce the case to a very few controlling issues. Under the above rule, when he fairly submits the controlling\n    issues, the case will not be reversed because of his failure to ‘pulverize’ the issues.” James P. Alexander, Lecture\n    before Judicial Section, State Bar of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n    “This rule makes plain provision for a check to curtail the number of issues submitted. The court need only submit\n    the ‘controlling issues,’ and, having done that, ‘the case shall not be reversed because of the failure to submit other\n    and various phases or different shades of the same issue.’ The objective of keeping the number of issues in a case\n    within reasonable bounds is also fortified in Rule 274, which penalizes, in the right to appellate complaint, a party\n    who swamps the trial court with numerous unnecessary requested issues tending to screen any particular requested\n    issue like the proverbial needle in a haystack.” J. B. Dooley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex. L. Rev.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1941).\n\n    Tender of “substantially correct” requested issues and instructions\n\n    “It will be noted that Rule 279 provides in substance that the failure to submit an issue, define a term or give\n    an explanatory instruction shall not be reversible error, unless the issue, definition, or instruction is tendered in\n    substantially correct form by the party relying on such issue or requesting such definition or instruction. Heretofore\n    a party requesting a definition of a legal term was not required to provide the court with the form thereof. This rule\n    is now changed so that the party requesting the definition must tender the instruction which he desires to have given.\n    It will also be noted that the issue, definition, or instruction must be tendered in substantially correct form. This\n    does not mean that it must be absolutely correct, nor does it mean that one that is merely sufficient to call the matter\n    to the attention of the court will suffice. It means one that in substance and in the main is correct, and that is not\n    affirmatively incorrect.\n\n    “Again I call the trial judges' attention to the fact that this provision, as well as many others, is for the protection of\n    the trial judge. It is intended to enable him to secure the full co-operation of the attorneys, but it is not intended to\n    encourage a judge to neglect his responsibilities in the trial of the case. While a trial judge should never comment\n    on the weight of the evidence or otherwise indicate to the jury his opinion on the matters to be submitted to the jury,\n    yet this does not mean that he should permit himself to be relegated to the position of a mere moderator. He should\n    assume control of the trial and direct its course, and if in his opinion an instruction is necessary in order to meet the\n    ends of justice, he should see that such instruction is given, even though it is not requested in correct form, and even\n    though no reversible error would be presented if such instruction was not given.” James P. Alexander, Lecture before\n    Judicial Section, State Bar of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n    “The rule retains the present practice that a party has no standing for appellate complaint on the ground that the trial\n    court failed to submit an issue material to his cause of action or ground of defense, unless the party requested said\n    issue in substantially proper wording in the trial court, but rightfully qualifies the requirement by adding: ‘provided,\n    however, that objection to such failure shall suffice in such respect if the issue is one relied upon by the opposing party.'\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Under this rule, if a ground of recovery\n    or of defense is wholly ignored or neglected, and no issue is submitted or requested thereon, it will be held to have\n    been waived and no recovery or defense can be based thereon. If, however, the grounds of recovery or of defense\n    consist of more than one element--that is, require more than one issue to submit them--and the court submits some\n    of the elements but omits others, and there is no objection to the failure to submit same, the parties will be placed\n    in the position of having agreed to waive a jury trial on the unsubmitted elements and to have submitted them to the\n    court for his determination. Either party, after notice and before final judgment is rendered, may request the court\n    to make an express finding on such issues. In such an event the judge may find as he thinks the evidence justifies.\n    If he does not make such finding, then, on appeal, it will be presumed that the court found on such unsubmitted\n    elements in such manner as to support the judgment.” James P. Alexander, Lecture before Judicial Section, State Bar\n    of Texas, July 3, 1941.\n\n    “The above language (see last paragraph, Rule 279) describing when the court may make a finding on omitted issues\n    or such finding may be presumed seems to be a compound of what our courts have said in three well-known case.\n    [Wichita Falls & O.

[Civ.App.1941, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3947765\"><a href=\"/opinion/4179428/texas-employers-ins-assn-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span>\n    <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, error dismissed.] That was a compensation suit. The testimony, as recognized by the appellate court, was\n    not conclusive, but at best only sufficient in the plaintiff's behalf to raise the issue of the existence of compensation\n    coverage applicable to plaintiff. The question of coverage was not submitted to the jury, but the omission was not\n    made a ground of objection, nor was any issue on the subject requested. The court disposed of the point in this far-\n    reaching language: ‘* * * In the instant case, however, we think the plaintiff has asserted but one ground of recovery\n    which as a whole constitutes the ultimate issue. Such ultimate issue is whether or not he is entitled to compensation\n    from the defendant for the injury suffered. This ultimate issue or ground of recovery is made up of several component\n    parts. Among these are in substance the following: (1) The sustaining of accidental injuries; (2) the sustaining of such\n    injuries in the course of his employment; (3) the extent of his injuries; (4) the duration of his injuries; (5) the coverage\n    of the injuries by the policy; and (6) the basis for compensation rate.\n\n    “‘The issue of coverage not being within itself an independent ground of recovery but being merely a component\n    part of the ultimate issue of plaintiff's right of recovery, and portions of such ultimate issue having been submitted,\n\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    it follows that the trial court, if there was evidence to sustain his action, was authorized to find upon the issue of\n    coverage in support of the judgment. * * *'\n\n    “The usual example used in discussing the subject of presumed findings is the series of questions involved in an\n    ordinary negligence case. These questions are: (1) whether the defendant did the act, or suffered the omission alleged;\n    and (2) whether such act or omission if found, was negligence; and (3) whether such negligence, if any, was the\n    proximate cause of injuries to the plaintiff. These are interdependent and kindred issues in a proper sense. They deal\n    with the same subject, that is, the alleged act or omission. The first relates to the existence of the subject, and if there\n    is an affirmative finding, then the second determines the quality of the subject, and the third determines the causal\n    consequences of the subject. The submission of any one of said issues is a partial submission of the whole inquiry\n    covered by the three affiliated issues. The submission of any one of said issues ought to bring any unsubmitted issue\n    of the group within the provision for presumed findings.\n\n    “The defense of estoppel similarly involves multiple elements naturally covered by a series of kindred issues dealing\n    in turn with, say, an alleged misrepresentation or concealment, and, if same was committed, then whether it was done\n    to mislead the other party and whether the latter was misled to his detriment.\n\n    “The well-known Pepper case furnishes another clear instance. The plaintiff sued for overflow damage to his cotton\n    crop. The trial court submitted the question of how many bales of cotton the plaintiff would have grown but for the\n    flood damage. The jury made a finding. The court failed to ask the jury how many bales of cotton the plaintiff actually\n    raised on the land. This last issue went unsubmitted without a request or objection. The two issues, one submitted\n    and the other unsubmitted, were clearly complementary in nature. They went to the same subject, the measure of\n    damages. The Supreme Court held a presumed finding on the unsubmitted issue, there being the necessary evidence,\n    was proper in support of the judgment.\n\n    “Similarly in the Reed case above mentioned, there is some reason to class certain of the issues enumerated by\n    the court as kindred issues. The series of issues covering the questions whether the plaintiff sustained accidental\n    personal injuries, and what incapacity, whether total or partial, resulted from any such injuries, and the duration of any\n    incapacity, make an affiliated set dealing with the subject of the plaintiff's injuries and ensuing results. The question,\n    however, whether there was a compensation insurance policy covering plaintiff's employment seems to be a separate\n    and distinct inquiry. Let us suppose a negligence suit brought by a plaintiff against a defendant-employer for injuries\n    sustained in a collision between an automobile occupied by plaintiff and a truck driven by a person alleged to have\n    been the defendant's servants in the course of his employment; and say that the evidence makes it a controverted issue\n    whether the driver of the truck was in fact the defendant's employee in the course of his employment at the time.\n    In submitting the case the court puts to the jury issues to determine whether the truck driver was guilty of the fault\n    alleged by plaintiff, and whether such act or omission, if done, was negligence, and whether such negligence, if any,\n    was the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries, but fails to submit any issue, and none is requested, to have the jury\n    find whether the truck driver was the defendant's servant acting in the course of his employment at the time of the\n    collision. In my opinion the general understanding of lawyers is that a judgment for plaintiff under said circumstances\n    could not be sustained by indulging a presumed finding that the driver was the defendant's servant in the due course\n    of his employment at said time. This for the reason that said question is an inquiry distinct and independent from\n    the questions submitted by the court. The Reed case, however, seems to point to the contrary. It apparently bears the\n    construction that whenever any material issue, even only one, is submitted and a verdict thereon is rendered, then,\n    given proper supporting evidence, any other issue or issues not submitted, nor covered by a request or objection, may\n    be made the subject of presumed findings; without any further limitation whatever in suits confined to a single alleged\n    cause of action and free of any affirmative defense, such as frequently found in partnership accounting, ordinary\n    actionable fraud, boundary, reformation, and workmen's compensation suits, and without limitation in more complex\n    suits except that in joining an actual jury finding and presumed findings it is not permissible to cross the line between\n    definitely separate and independent grounds of recovery or defense. That, as you will readily sense, would open up a\n\n\n\n               © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    vista of new impetus to this procedural device. In passing, it may be said that there is another Court of Civil Appeals'\n    decision seemingly in conflict with the recent case above discussed. [Texas Employers' Ins. Ass'n v. Hilderbrandt,\n    Civ.App.1933, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">62</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">].\n\n    “Under the express terms of Rule 279, the authority for a presumed finding on any unsubmitted issue belonging to a\n    given ground of recovery or defense depends upon there having been a submission of some other issue ‘necessarily\n    referable’ to that same ground of recovery or defense. This requirement seems to fit the case of an overlapping issue\n    common to two distinct and independent theories such as in a broker's suit brought both on express contract and\n    alternatively on implied contract, where the question of whether the plaintiff was the procuring cause of the deal is\n    material to a recovery on either express or implied contract. Then again, that part of the rule may reach a situation\n    suggested by the opinion in the Pepper case. Some of the illustrative language in that opinion could be construed\n    to mean that in a negligence case a partial submission covering an alleged ground of negligence would sustain a\n    presumed finding of the amount of damages, and vice versa. The damage issue, however, might be treated as simply\n    going to the plaintiff's remedy or redress for the wrong constituting his ground of recovery. The damage issue in\n    that sense could be regarded as separate from the literal ground of recovery. The point is that whatever damages the\n    plaintiff has suffered have been sustained regardless of negligence, vel non, and from that standpoint the question of\n    damages is not necessarily referable to any ground of recovery. The same thought may be brought out from another\n    direction. The plaintiff's suit may be based on two distinct grounds of negligence, and there may be proof in support\n    of each, but we will say only one of these grounds is submitted and the issue of damages again goes unsubmitted\n    without objection or request. Then it is evident that the question of damages is no more referable to the ground of\n    negligence submitted than to the ground not submitted.\n\n    “The said rule makes a new departure as far as formal provision is concerned regarding presumed findings, as the rule\n    permits the trial judge to make express findings where the circumstances are proper instead of leaving the questions\n    to the operation of presumed findings. The courts of Texas, however, have exercised this very power without express\n    authority in the statutes, [Ward v. Etier, 1923, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3919100\"><a href=\"/opinion/4154106/ward-jr-v-etier/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">] and so, after all, there is no real novelty\n    in the point. The provision, as I see it, is a very reasonable one. The provision for presumed findings must logically\n    rest upon the theory that there has been a waiver of jury trial in respect to the particular issues. The federal rules\n    which will be noticed presently contain a similar provision for presumed findings and expressly recognize that such\n    authority proceeds on a theory of waiver of jury trial upon such issues. Once the theory of waiver is admitted, then\n    in reason the court ought to be granted the right and power to make express findings. Express findings have a reality\n    while presumed findings are rather artificial. A logical consequence of the judge's right and power to make express\n    findings is that he is free to decide the particular issue either way, assuming a conflict in the evidence, and is not\n    bound to decide the issue in favor of the same party who has prevailed in the partial findings made by the jury. This\n    is not a new suggestion in Texas, and instead finds an example in a Supreme Court decision. [Nixon v.

Omissions From the Charge, TX R RCP Rule 279\n\n\n    The sentence: “A party shall not be entitled to an affirmative submission of any issue in his behalf where such issue\n    is raised only by a general denial and not by an affirmative written pleading on his part”, applies to so-called issues\n    that can be raised under the general denial. It does not refer to theories under affirmative pleading either of plaintiff\n    or of defendant, whether general or particular. In the latter respect the rules make no change from the former practice.\n    If, under the former practice, a plaintiff using general affirmative pleading was entitled to affirmative submission on\n    various phases of negligence he is still entitled to such submission, insofar as pleading is concerned. 5 Texas B.J.\n    288 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 21 (1945).\n\n    Appeals from justice to county courts\n\n    While the written pleadings in the county court are the pleadings upon which the case is tried, if the trial is upon\n    certain proof that is variant from or has no support in the written pleadings, but no objection or the like is made to the\n    variance or departure, Rule 67 applies and it will be as though there had been sufficient pleading. See also Rule 66 as\n    to ready amendment if objection is made. Upon a special issue submission all pleadings relied upon in the submission\n    would have to be in writing, under Rules 67, 277, and 279, unless the defect should be waived under Rule 274. 5\n    Texas B.J. 287 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 19 (1945).\n\n    Unavoidable accident\n\n    A defendant in a negligence case must specifically plead the issue of unavoidable accident to entitle him to an\n    affirmative submission of such issue. Defendant's right to present inconsistent defensive theories under the general\n    denial is not cut off by this Rule. He may introduce evidence on the point and argue to the jury that the injury and\n    damage to the plaintiff were the result of unavoidable accident, but if he desires an affirmative submission of such\n    issue, he must plead it. 5 Texas B.J. 236 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 17 (1945).\n\n    Lack of pleadings to support\n\n    “Issues submitted without written pleadings to support them will not be erroneous upon that ground unless objection\n    upon that ground is made.” 6 Texas B.J. 77 (1943); 8 Texas B.J. 33 (1945).\n\n    Burden of proof\n\n    This Rule does not change the burden of proof from what it would have been under the general denial. 5 Texas B.J.\n    236 (1942); 8 Texas B.J. 17 (1945).\n\n\n\nNotes of Decisions (3338)\n\nVernon's Ann.
