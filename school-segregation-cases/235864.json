For the\n\nreasons stated below, the motion is GRANTED.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n     Plaintiff N.B. is a hearing impaired child.       During the\n\frelevant time periods, N.B. lived in either Columbia or Suwannee\n\nCounty, Florida. Sometime prior to March 1986, N.B. was bused from\n\nher home in Columbia or Suwannee County to attend a special school\n\nfor hearing impaired children in Alachua County.             Plaintiff claims\n\nthat   this   decision   caused      her   to   be   segregated   from   hearing\n\nstudents.     She also claims that the long bus ride caused her to\n\nmiss a significant portion of class work each school day.                     N.B.\n\nleft the State of Florida at the end of the 1992/93 school year and\n\nis no longer in the Florida educational system.\n\n       N.B.   has   brought   this    suit      alleging   violations    of   the\n\nIndividuals with Disabilities in Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1400 et seq.        She seeks compensatory damages under the IDEA\n\n(Count I) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Count II).\n\n       In the motion to dismiss, defendants move for dismissal of the\n\nfirst amended complaint based on the following four grounds:                   1)\n\nthe plaintiff has failed to exhaust administrative remedies;                    2)\n\nthe plaintiff's claims are barred by the statute of limitations;\n\n3) compensatory damages are not available under the IDEA;                and 4)\n\ncompensatory damages are not available under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for\n\nviolations of the IDEA.         Because the Court finds dismissal is\n\nappropriate     for    plaintiff's         failure    to   exhaust   necessary\n\nadministrative remedies as a prerequisite to filing this action,\n\nthe Court need not reach the remaining three issues concerning the\n\nstatute of limitations and the availability of compensatory damages\n\nunder the IDEA and 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n       DISCUSSION\n\n       The IDEA, formerly known as the Education for All Handicapped\n\fAct (\"EHA\"), 20 U.S.C. § 1400 et seq., provides federal money to\n\nstate and local education agencies in order to assist them in\n\neducating handicapped children, on the condition that the states\n\nand   local   agencies    implement   the   substantive       and   procedural\n\nrequirements of the Act.       The principal purpose of the Act is \"to\n\nassure that all children with disabilities have available to them\n\n... a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special\n\neducation and related services designed to meet the handicapped\n\nchild's unique needs, ... [and to ensure] that the rights of\n\nhandicapped children and their parents or guardians are protected.\"\n\n20 U.S.C. § 1400(c).\n\n      To carry out these objectives, the IDEA provides procedural\n\nsafeguards to permit parental involvement in all matters concerning\n\nthe child's educational program and allows parents to obtain\n\nadministrative      and   judicial    review   of    decisions      they   deem\n\nunsatisfactory or inappropriate.        Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 311-\n\n12, 108 S.Ct. 592, 597-98, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988).                   Under this\n\nscheme of procedural protections, parents are entitled to 1)\n\nexamination of all relevant records pertaining to evaluation and\n\neducational placement of their child, 2) prior written notice\n\nwhenever the responsible educational agency proposes, or refuses,\n\nto change the child's placement, 3) an opportunity to present\n\ncomplaints concerning any aspect of the local agency's provision of\n\na free appropriate public education, and 4) an opportunity for an\n\n\"impartial    due    process   hearing\"     with    respect    to    any   such\n\ncomplaints.    Id. at 312, 108 S.Ct. at 598.\n\n      In the event that a party is dissatisfied with or aggrieved by\n\fthe findings and decisions made after the impartial due process\n\nhearing, that party may obtain additional administrative review by\n\nthe state educational agency.     20 U.S.C. § 1415(c).    If that party\n\nis still dissatisfied or remains aggrieved after the administrative\n\nappeal, a judicial review is available in either state court or\n\nfederal court to contest the decisions of the educational agency.\n\nId. § 1415(e)(2).\n\n      \"The philosophy of the [IDEA] is that plaintiffs are required\n\nto utilize the elaborate administrative scheme established by the\n\n[IDEA] before resorting to the courts to challenge the actions of\n\nthe local school authorities.\"       Ass'n for Retarded Citizens of\n\nAlabama v. Teague, 830 F.2d 158, 160 (11th Cir.1987) (citing Smith\n\nv. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984)).\n\nKey reasons for requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies\n\nare as follows:   1) to permit the exercise of agency discretion and\n\nexpertise on issues requiring these characteristics;       2) to allow\n\nthe full development of technical issues and a factual record prior\n\nto   court   review;    3)   to   prevent   deliberate   disregard   and\n\ncircumvention of agency procedures established by Congress; and 4)\n\nto avoid unnecessary judicial decisions by giving the agency the\n\nfirst opportunity to correct any error.       Id.\n\n       The exhaustion requirement, however, is not jurisdictional\n\nand therefore \" \"is not to be applied inflexibly.' \"       Id. (quoting\n\nMcGee v. United States, 402 U.S. 479, 483, 91 S.Ct. 1565, 1568, 29\n\nL.Ed.2d 47 (1971)).    The exhaustion of the administrative remedies\n\nis not required where resort to administrative remedies would be 1)\n\nfutile or 2) inadequate.     Id. (citing to Smith v. Robinson, 468\n\fU.S. at 1014 n. 17, 1019 n. 22, 104 S.Ct. at 3469 n. 17, 3472 n.\n\n22).\n\n        In the amended complaint, plaintiff does not allege that she\n\nhas exhausted her administrative remedies.                      Instead, plaintiff\n\nargues that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required\n\nin this case because she no longer attends any of the defendant\n\nschool districts.         This argument was squarely rejected in\n                                                               Torrie By\n\nand Through Torrie v. Cwayna, 841 F.Supp. 1434 (W.D.Mich.1994). In\n\nthat case, an emotionally impaired student and his mother brought\n\nan action against a school district and its employees for alleged\n\nviolations of IDEA, Rehabilitation Act, false arrest and false\n\nimprisonment.       The student and his mother neither requested an\n\nimpartial due process hearing nor filed a complaint with the school\n\ndistrict before filing the action.                In responding to the school\n\ndistrict's       motion    to    dismiss      based   on    failure    to    exhaust\n\nadministrative remedies, the plaintiffs argued that exhaustion was\n\nnot required under the futility exception because they no longer\n\nlived in the defendant school district.                  Reasoning that parents'\n\nunilateral act of removing their child from a public school could\n\nnot excuse their failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the\n\ncourt   dismissed     the    action     for    failure     to   exhaust     remedies.\n\nTorrie,    841    F.Supp.       at   1442.    The rationale of            Torrie   is\n\npersuasive.       If parents can bypass the exhaustion requirement of\n\nthe IDEA by merely moving their child out of the defendant school\n\ndistrict, the whole administrative scheme established by the IDEA\n\nwould be rendered nugatory.                  Permitting parents to avoid the\n\nrequirements of the IDEA through such a \"back door\" would not be\n\fconsistent with the legislative intent of the IDEA.\n\n     The plaintiff's second argument is equally unpersuasive.                The\n\nplaintiff argues there is no point pursuing administrative remedies\n\nbecause the defendant school districts lack authority to grant the\n\nrelief requested, namely money damages.            Again, if the plaintiff's\n\nargument is to be accepted, then future litigants could avoid the\n\nexhaustion     requirement      simply     by     asking   for    relief     that\n\nadministrative authorities could not grant.            This goes against the\n\nvery reason that we have the exhaustion requirement, which is \"[to\n\nprevent]     deliberate      disregard     and    circumvention     of     agency\n\nprocedures established by Congress.\"             Teague, 830 F.2d at 160.      In\n\nfact, courts that considered this argument have all rejected it.\n\nSee Buffolino v. Board of Education of Sachem Central School\n\nDistrict,    729   F.Supp.    240,   247   (E.D.N.Y.1990);        Waterman     v.\n\nMarquette-Alger Intermediate School District, 739 F.Supp. 361, 368\n\n(W.D.Mich.1990) (\"A procedure that may result in any substantial\n\nrelief is not futile\");        Torrie, 841 F.Supp. at 1442.\n\n     Nor does the fact that the plaintiff also seeks money damages\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of the IDEA make any\n\ndifference.    \"[W]hen parents choose to file suit under another law\n\nthat protects the rights of handicapped children—and the suit could\n\nhave been filed under the [IDEA]—they are first required to exhaust\n\nthe [IDEA]'s remedies to the same extent as if the suit had been\n\nfiled originally under the [IDEA]'s provisions.\"                   Mrs. W. v.\n\nTirozzi, 832 F.2d 748, 756 (2d Cir.1987).               As the plaintiff has\n\nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies, the plaintiff may not\n\nproceed with her § 1983 claims for violations of the IDEA.\n\fCONCLUSION\n\n     Accordingly, the defendants' motion to dismiss (doc. 6) is\n\nGRANTED.     The Clerk is directed to dismiss the first amended\n\ncomplaint with prejudice.\n\f",

During the relevant time periods, N.B. lived in either Columbia or Suwannee County, Florida.   Sometime prior to March 1986, N.B. was bused from her home in Columbia or Suwannee County to attend a special school for hearing impaired children in Alachua County.   Plaintiff claims that this decision caused her to be segregated from hearing students.   She also claims that the long bus ride caused her to miss a significant portion of class work each school day.   N.B. left the State of Florida at the end of the 1992/93 school year and is no longer in the Florida educational system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">N.B. has brought this suit alleging violations of the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act (\"IDEA\"), 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400 et seq.

Because the Court finds dismissal is appropriate for plaintiff's failure to exhaust necessary administrative remedies as a prerequisite to filing this action, the Court need not reach the remaining three issues concerning the statute of limitations and the availability of compensatory damages under the IDEA and 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IDEA, formerly known as the Education for All Handicapped Act (\"EHA\"), 20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400 et seq., provides federal money to state and local education agencies in order to assist them in educating handicapped children, on the condition that the states and local agencies implement the substantive and procedural requirements of the Act.   The principal purpose of the Act is \"to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them ... a free appropriate public education which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet the handicapped child's unique needs, ... [and to ensure] that the rights of handicapped children and their parents or guardians are protected.\"  20 U.S.C. &#167; 1400(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To carry out these objectives, the IDEA provides procedural safeguards to permit parental involvement in all matters concerning the child's educational program and allows parents to obtain administrative and judicial review of decisions they deem unsatisfactory or inappropriate.

Under this scheme of procedural protections, parents are entitled to 1) examination of all relevant records pertaining to evaluation and educational placement of their child, 2) prior written notice whenever the responsible educational agency proposes, or refuses, to change the child's placement, 3) an opportunity to present complaints concerning any aspect of the local agency's provision of a free appropriate public education, and 4) an opportunity for an \"impartial due process hearing\" with respect to any such complaints.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">746</span></a></span> (1984)).   Key reasons for requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies are as follows:  1) to permit the exercise of agency discretion and expertise on issues requiring these characteristics;  2) to allow the full development of technical issues and a factual record prior to court review;  3) to prevent deliberate disregard and circumvention of agency procedures established by Congress;  and 4) to avoid unnecessary judicial decisions by giving the agency the first opportunity to correct any error.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exhaustion requirement, however, is not jurisdictional and therefore \" 'is not to be applied inflexibly.' \"  Id. (quoting McGee v. United States, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108336\"><a href=\"/opinion/108336/mcgee-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">479</span></a></span>, 483, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108336\"><a href=\"/opinion/108336/mcgee-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span> (1971)).   The exhaustion of the administrative remedies is not required where resort to administrative remedies would be 1) futile or 2) inadequate.  Id. (citing to Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. at 1014 n. 17, 1019 n. 22, 104 S.Ct. at 3469 n. 17, 3472 n. 22).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the amended complaint, plaintiff does not allege that she has exhausted her administrative remedies.   Instead, plaintiff argues that exhaustion of administrative remedies is not required in this case because she no longer attends any of the defendant school districts.   This argument was squarely rejected in Torrie By and Through Torrie v. Cwayna, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">841</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1434</span></span> (W.D.Mich.1994).   In that case, an emotionally impaired student and his mother brought an action against a school district and its employees for alleged violations of IDEA, Rehabilitation Act, false arrest and false imprisonment.   The student and his mother neither requested an impartial due process hearing nor filed a complaint with the school district before filing the action.   In responding to the school district's motion to dismiss based on failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the plaintiffs argued that exhaustion was not required under the futility exception because they no longer lived in the defendant school district.   Reasoning that parents' unilateral act of removing their child from a public school could not excuse their failure to exhaust administrative remedies, the court dismissed the action for failure to exhaust remedies.  Torrie, 841 F.Supp. at 1442.   The rationale of Torrie is persuasive.   If parents can bypass the exhaustion requirement of the IDEA by merely moving their child out of the defendant school district, the whole administrative scheme established by the IDEA would be rendered nugatory.   Permitting parents to avoid the requirements of the IDEA through such a \"back door\" would not be consistent with the legislative intent of the IDEA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiff's second argument is equally unpersuasive.   The plaintiff argues there is no point pursuing administrative remedies because the defendant school districts lack authority to grant the relief requested, namely money damages.   Again, if the plaintiff's argument is to be accepted, then future litigants could avoid the exhaustion requirement simply by asking for relief that administrative authorities could not grant.   This goes against the very reason that we have the exhaustion requirement, which is \"[to prevent] deliberate disregard and circumvention of agency procedures established by Congress.\"  Teague, 830 F.2d at 160.
