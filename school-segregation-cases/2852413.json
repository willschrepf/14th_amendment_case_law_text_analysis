Shabaz, Judge.\n\nARGUED MAY 7, 2001--DECIDED August 2, 2001\n\n\n\n  Before FLAUM, Chief Judge, and RIPPLE and\nDIANE P. WOOD, Circuit Judges.\n\n  RIPPLE, Circuit Judge.   Bruce and Sharon\nBillings brought this action pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. sec. 1983 against the Madison\nMetropolitan School District (\"school\ndistrict\") and certain employees at John\nMuir Elementary School: Principal John\nBurmaster and teachers Nancy Zabel, Laura\nMueller, Sue Perry, Annie Keith, Robert\nWeisner, Sue Berthouex, and Shelly\nCosgrove. On behalf of their minor child,\nB.B., the Billings alleged a violation of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the\nConstitution of the United States and a\nviolation of the Wisconsin Constitution.\nThe district court granted summary\njudgment for the defendants. The Billings\nnow appeal. For the reasons set forth in\nthe following opinion, we affirm in part\nand reverse in part the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\nI\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.   Facts\n\n  The Billings’ daughter, B.B., was a\nstudent at John Muir Elementary School in\n\fMadison, Wisconsin, from kindergarten\nuntil the middle of her third-grade year.\nThe Billings claim that B.B. was denied\nequal protection of the law because she\nwas placed in Ms. Zabel’s third-grade\nclass based on her race. They also claim\nthat, B.B., while in Ms. Zabel’s class,\nwas subjected to disparate treatment\nbecause of her race.\n\n1.   Placement\n\n  In the spring of 1999, second-grade\nteachers at John Muir met three or four\ntimes to discuss class assignments. The\nschool district had no policy or practice\nregarding the assignment of students to\nelementary school classes. The only\ninstructions to the teachers regarding\nstudent placement came in a memo from\nPrincipal Burmaster on May 4, 1999:\n\nAs we discussed at our staff meeting, the\nbasic outline for deciding and balancing\nclass lists will remain the same as in\nyears past: to the extent possible we\nshould attempt to balance classes\naccording to gender, ethnicity, academic\nabilities, and special needs while also\nconsidering the Parent Input sheet which\nshould have been returned to you. Please\nconsult with Special Ed teachers if you\nhave concerns or questions about\nprogramming needs of EEN students. You\nshould have gotten a copy of the \"Student\nInventory\" card that Kristen mentioned in\nyour mailbox. I hope that it makes your\njob easier. I will try to get to as many\nof your placement meetings as possible.\nThank you for your devotion to this\ndifficult and important task.\n\nBurmaster Aff. para. 8, Ex.E.\n\n  Sue Perry, Annie Keith, and Sue\nBerthouex were involved in assigning\nsecond-grade students to third-grade\nclasses in the spring of 1999. The\nteachers prepared an index card for each\nof their students. The index card\ncontained biographical data including\nacademic abilities, behavioral issues,\nspecial education needs (if any),\nethnicity, neighborhood, gender, reading\nlevel, and math level. The teachers then\nused the information on the index cards\nin an attempt to assign the children so\nthe classes reflected the overall\nbiographical makeup of the third grade at\nJohn Muir. Academic criteria were used to\n\fdistribute high and low achieving\nstudents evenly throughout the third-\ngrade classes. To fairly distribute the\nworkload among teachers, the special\neducation status of a child also was\nconsidered to ensure a roughly equal\ndistribution of special education\nstudents in each class. The ethnicity of\nthe students only was considered as a\ngeneral guideline to ensure that none of\nthe classrooms contained a\ndisproportionate number of minority\nstudents. The neighborhood where the\nchild resided only was considered to\navoid isolating a child from\nstudentsliving in his or her particular\nneighborhood.\n\n  Although Ms. Perry and Ms. Cosgrove\njointly taught B.B.’s second-grade class,\nMs. Cosgrove did not attend the class\nassignment meetings. Consequently, it was\nMs. Perry who recommended that B.B. be\nassigned to Ms. Zabel’s third-grade\nclass. In making her decision, she\nreviewed the composition of two other\nthird-grade classrooms, those taught by\nMary Bostrom and Lesley Wilke-Nadler. Ms.\nPerry selected Ms. Zabel’s class for two\nreasons: (1) the Billings had expressed a\ndesire for B.B. to be with a teacher who\nhad high expectations, and Ms. Perry\nbelieved Ms. Zabel would meet those\nneeds; (2) B.B. had had some negative\nincidents with special education students\nassigned to Ms. Bostrom’s and Ms. Wilke-\nNadler’s classrooms. Additionally, Ms.\nZabel’s class was comprised of students\nwith a broad range of academic aptitudes\nfrom low to above-average.\n\n2.  Treatment\n  Early in the 1999-2000 school year, Ms.\nZabel divided her class into two groups\nof six and three groups of four. She\nexplained that \"in a group of four I\nwould put two African-Americans\ntogether.\" Zabel Dep., Vol.II, at 33.\nWhen asked why she seated African-\nAmerican students in pairs, Ms. Zabel\nstated, \"I think in my education training\nsometimes we were told that African-\nAmerican students need a buddy, and\nsometimes it works well if they have\nsomeone else working with them because\nthey view things in a global manner.\" Id.\nDeana Marie Zentner, a student teacher in\nMs. Zabel’s class in the beginning of the\n1999-2000 school year, corroborated this\ntestimony. When asked about the classroom\n\fseating arrangement, Zentner stated that\nMs. Zabel \"tried to have two African-\nAmerican students at each cluster and\nalso did the same with the Hispanic\nstudents.\" Zentner Dep. at 70-71.\n\nB.   District Court Proceedings\n\n  The Billings were unable to resolve\nthese issues with the defendants.\nConsequently, the Billings brought this\naction in district court. In their\ncomplaint, they alleged that both B.B.’s\nassignment to Ms. Zabel’s class and her\ntreatment while in that class violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause. The\ndefendants moved for summary judgment,\nwhich the district court granted. The\ndistrict court first concluded that,\nalthough race was considered as a factor\nin the overall class assignment process,\nthere was no evidence that B.B. was\nplaced in Ms. Zabel’s class because of\nher race. As a result, the district court\nheld that the decision to place B.B. in\nMs. Zabel’s class did not deny B.B. equal\nprotection of the law. Furthermore, the\ncourt stated that there was no evidence\nwhatsoever to suggest that B.B. was\nplaced in Ms. Zabel’s class to serve as a\nrole model for low-income African-\nAmerican students, as the Billings had\nalleged.\n\n  The district court also dismissed the\nBillings’ disparate treatment claim that\nalleged that Ms. Zabel treated B.B.\ndifferently in the classroom because she\nwas an African-American. Despite Ms.\nZabel’s own admission in her deposition\nthat she sat African-American students in\npairs because she believed they needed a\nbuddy, the district court found that\nthere was no evidence that B.B. was\ntreated differently from children of\nother races. Additionally, the district\ncourt held that even if Ms. Zabel seated\nAfrican-American children together in her\nclassroom, such a seating arrangement,\nwithout more, was insufficient to support\na claim that B.B. was denied equal access\nto educational opportunities. The\nBillings now appeal.\n\n\nII\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\f  Summary judgment is permissible when\n\"there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and . . . the moving party\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). This court\nreviews the district court’s grant\nofsummary judgment de novo. See Cliff v.\nBd. of Sch. Comm’rs, 42 F.3d 403, 408\n(7th Cir. 1994). To survive a motion for\nsummary judgment, the Billings must make\na showing sufficient to establish each\nessential element of their cause of\naction for which they will bear the\nburden of persuasion at trial. See\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,\n322 (1986); Draghi v. County of Cook, 184\nF.3d 689, 691 (7th Cir. 1999). In other\nwords, if the Billings do not produce\nevidence sufficient to sustain a jury\nverdict in their favor, we shall affirm\nthe district court’s grant of the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment.\n\nB. Prima Facie Case for an Equal\nProtection Violation\n\n  The Billings allege, on behalf of their\nminor daughter, B.B., a violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. A plaintiff asserting an equal\nprotection violation must establish that\na state actor has treated him differently\nfrom persons of a different race and that\nthe state actor did so purposefully. See\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-42\n(1976); DeWalt v. Carter, 224 F.3d 607,\n618 (7th Cir. 2000). The Billings allege\nthat the defendants violated the Equal\nProtection Clause in two separate ways.\nWe shall now address each of these\nclaims.\n\n1.   Class Placement\n\n  The Billings claim that B.B.’s third-\ngrade classroom assignment for the 1999-\n2000 school year was based on race. The\ndistrict court held that the Billings did\nnot meet their burden of showing that Ms.\nPerry assigned B.B. to Ms. Zabel’s class\nbased on B.B.’s race. In our view, the\nrecord supports the district court’s\nholding. Evidence in the record shows\nthat Ms. Perry made her decision based on\ntwo race-neutral reasons: (1) B.B.’s\nparents had expressed their desire for\nB.B. to be with a teacher who had high\nexpectations, and Ms. Perry believed Ms.\nZabel would meet those needs; (2) Ms.\n\fPerry did not select the two remaining\nclassrooms because B.B. had experienced\nproblems with special education students\nplaced in each of those classrooms.\n\n  These race-neutral reasons will not\nsupport an equal protection violation. A\nplaintiff asserting an equal protection\nviolation must establish that a state\nactor purposefully treated him\ndifferently because of his race. See\nCoalition to Save Our Children v. State\nBd. of Educ., 90 F.3d 752, 763 (3d Cir.\n1996) (holding that, although a\ndisproportionate number of African-\nAmerican students were placed in special\neducation, there was no equal protection\nviolation because the record revealed\nthat placement was accomplished solely\nthrough the use of race-neutral\ncriteria). Indeed, the Billings even have\nfailed to show that there was a\ndisproportionate number of African-\nAmerican students in the class to which\nB.B. was assigned. Ms. Zabel’s class had\nslightly more African-American students--\none more than Ms. Bostrom’s, two more\nthan Mr. Weisner’s, and three more than\nMs. Wilke-Nadler’s--but overall Ms.\nZabel’s, Mr. Weisner’s, and Ms. Wilke-\nNadler’s classrooms each had a total of\ntwelve minority students.\n\n  In a further effort to show that B.B.\nwas placed in Ms. Zabel’s class because\nof her race, the Billings maintain that\nB.B. was assigned to that section to\nserve as a role model for other African-\nAmerican students. The Billings rely\nheavily on the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education,\n476 U.S. 267 (1986) (plurality opinion),\nto support their claim that such a\nmotivation for classroom placement\nviolated B.B.’s equal protection rights.\n\n  The record shows that B.B. was the only\nAfrican-American student in the class who\ndid not live in Wexford Ridge, a\nneighborhood within the school district\nwhere a number of African-American\nstudents lived. She was also the only\nAfrican-American student without a low\naptitude in reading and math.\nNonetheless, the district court\ndetermined that, without question, B.B.\nwas not assigned to Ms. Zabel’s class to\nbe a role model. We agree. The Billings\nprovide no evidence that Ms. Perry ever\nconsidered that B.B. could be a role\n\fmodel for other African-American students\nor assigned her to Ms. Zabel’s class for\nthat reason. On the contrary, as we\nalready have noted, the record makes\nclear that Ms. Perry had race-neutral\nreasons for making the placement.\n\n  The Billings only became concerned about\nB.B.’s possible status as a role model\nafter a telephone conversation between\nPrincipal Burmaster and Mrs. Billings.\nDuring this conversation, which focused\nprimarily on a disciplinary incident in\nMs. Zabel’s class, Principal Burmaster\nmentioned that he hoped B.B. could be a\nrole model for \"these other children.\"\nSharon Billings Dep. at 111. Principal\nBurmaster’s remark is ambiguous as to the\nchildren for whom he hoped that B.B.\ncould be a role model; the Billings have\nprovided no evidence justifying their\nassumption that the principal was\nreferring only to African-American\nstudents. Additionally, the principal’s\noffhand remark is irrelevant to our\nreview of the assignment process because\nit is undisputed that Principal Burmaster\ndid not participate in making the\nclassroom assignments.\n\n  The Billings have failed to establish a\nprima facie case for an equal protection\nviolation on their claim that B.B. was\nassigned to Ms. Zabel’s class on the\nbasis of race. The district court\ncorrectly determined that summary\njudgment ought to be granted to the\ndefendants on this claim.\n\n2.   Equal Education Opportunities\n\n  The Billings also claim that B.B. was\ndenied educational opportunities equal to\nthose of white students. They make two\nallegations in this regard. First, the\nBillings claim that Ms. Zabel did not\ngive B.B. individualized instruction in a\nmanner comparable to the assistance she\ngave to white students with similar\nacademic capabilities. The Billings have\nprovided no evidence that Ms. Zabel gave\nwhite students more challenging\nassignments than B.B. Therefore, because\nthis argument is devoid of supporting\nevidence in the record, it warrants no\nfurther discussion.\n\n  The Billings’ second claim of denial of\nequal educational opportunities requires\nsignificantly more analysis. They\n\fmaintain that Ms. Zabel treated B.B.\ndifferently because of her race in the\nclassroom seating arrangement: that Ms.\nZabel required that African-American and\nHispanic students sit in pairs in class.\nAlthough Ms. Zabel’s deposition testimony\nis not without ambiguity, this claim\nappears supported by both that testimony\nas well as her student teacher’s\ntestimony. Not only did Ms. Zabel admit\nthat, at an early period in the school\nyear, she arranged for minority students\nto sit in pairs in her classroom, but she\nstated that she did so purposefully. Ms.\nZabel explained that she utilized the\nrace-conscious seating arrangement\nbecause she believed that African-\nAmerican students \"need\" a partner\nbecause \"they view things in a global\nmanner.\" Zabel Dep., Vol.II, at 33.\n\n  \"Racial and ethnic distinctions of any\nsort are inherently suspect and thus call\nfor the most exacting judicial\nexamination.\" Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\nBakke, 438 U.S. 265, 291 (1978) (opinion\nof Powell, J.). Specifically, in the\nschool context, the \"constitutional\nobligation of public officials is to\nassign students without regard to race.\"\nSamayoa v. Chicago Bd. of Educ., 807 F.2d\n643, 647 (7th Cir. 1986). Ever since the\nSupreme Court’s landmark decision in\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483\n(1954), it has been established beyond\nquestion that state-imposed racial\nclassifications in the educational\nenvironment can have a significant effect\non the capacity of the involved children\nto profit from their education. In Brown,\na unanimous Supreme Court pointedly\nstated that to separate children \"from\nothers of similar age and qualifications\nsolely because of their race generates a\nfeeling of inferiority as to their status\nin the community that may affect their\nhearts and minds in a way unlikely ever\nto be undone.\" Id. at 494. The Court\nemphasized that such discriminatory\ntreatment is of particular concern when\nit affects \"children in grade and high\nschools.\" Id. Again in Milliken v.\nBradley, 433 U.S. 267, 287 (1977), the\nCourt wrote:\n\nChildren who have been thus educationally\nand culturally set apart from the larger\ncommunity will inevitably acquire habits\nof speech, conduct, and attitudes\nreflecting their cultural isolation. They\n\fare likely to acquire speech habits, for\nexample, which vary from the environment\nin which they must ultimately function\nand compete, if they are to enter and be\na part of that community.\n\n  The racial classification that occurred\nin Ms. Zabel’s class was not the sort of\ntotal racial segregation at issue in\nBrown or in Milliken. It was also of\nshort duration. Yet it did involve\nsetting apart certain students for\ndifferent treatment solely on account of\ntheir race. Although the effect on the\nstudent from this relatively minor and\ntransitory discrimination might well have\nbeen minimal, especially when compared\nwith the situations in more pervasive and\nenduring educational discrimination, our\nfaithfulness to constitutional principles\ndoes not permit us to overlook it or to\ndeclare it a de minimis matter.\n\n  In requiring that African-American and\nHispanic students sit in pairs, Ms. Zabel\nmay have believed that she was acting in\ntheir best interest. Nevertheless, her\naction was based purely on the race of\nthe student, and differences in treatment\nbased on race in the classroom must be\nregarded as highly suspect. See Adarand\nConstructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200,\n224-27 (1995); see also Majeske v. City\nof Chicago, 218 F.3d 816, 819 (7th Cir.\n2000), cert. denied, 121 S. Ct. 779\n(2001). To survive strict scrutiny, a\nrace-based classification must promote a\ncompelling government interest. See\nMajeske, 218 F.3d at 820; Wittmer v.\nPeters, 87 F.3d 916, 918-19 (7th Cir.\n1996). The state actor also must present\nevidence that the race-based\nclassification is narrowly tailored to\nserve a compelling state interest. See\nAdarand, 515 U.S. at 227; City of\nRichmond v. J.A. Croson Co., 488 U.S.\n469, 493-94 (1989); United States v.\nParadise, 480 U.S. 149, 167 (1987)\n(plurality opinion); see also DeWalt, 224\nF.3d at 618. This \"beady-eyed review,\"\nChicago Firefighters Local 2 v. City of\nChicago, 249 F.3d 649, 654 (7th Cir.\n2001), is utilized because race-based\nclassifications \"threaten to stigmatize\nindividuals by reason of their membership\nin a racial group and . . . incite\nracial hostility,\" Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S.\n630, 643 (1993).\n\n  It is well-settled that, under very\n\flimited circumstances, a governmental\nentity may employ a racial\nclassification. A governmental entity\n\"has a compelling interest in remedying\nits previous discrimination and the\nagency may use racial preferencing to\nrectify that past conduct.\" Majeske, 218\nF.3d at 820; see also McNamara v. City of\nChicago, 138 F.3d 1219, 1222 (7th Cir.\n1998). Before employing such a remedy,\nhowever, the government must show\nevidence of past discrimination. See\nMcNamara, 138 F.3d at 1222. When\nofficials have violated the obligation to\ntreat students without regard to race, \"a\ncourt may require them to take race into\naccount yet again to undo the racial\nidentities.\" Samayoa, 807 F.2d at 647.\nSchool districts may undertake such a\nremedy on a voluntary basis to correct\npast discriminatory practices. See\nMcDaniel v. Barresi, 402 U.S. 39, 41\n(1971). Thus, the consideration of racial\nfactors in undoing unconstitutional\nsegregation is permissible. See Swann v.\nCharlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402\nU.S. 1, 28 (1971); Banks v. Muncie Comm.\nSchs., 433 F.2d 292, 294 n.4 (7th Cir.\n1970); United States v. Sch. Dist. 151 of\nCook County, 404 F.2d 1125, 1135 (7th\nCir. 1968).\n\n  This record provides no basis for\njustifying the racially based seating\narrangement other than Ms. Zabel’s\nreliance on a stereotypical notion that\nAfrican-American students \"view things in\na global manner.\" No evidence of record\nindicates that this arrangement was\nimplemented to rectify past\ndiscriminatory conduct that had left its\neffect on these students. On this record,\nwithout any justification other than Ms.\nZabel’s stereotypical notion as to how\nAfrican-American children learn, her\naction cannot be justified, and,\nconsequently, summary judgment is\ninappropriate. It may be that, in further\nproceedings, Ms. Zabel will be able to\nexplain in a more satisfactory manner the\nreasons for her adoption of the racially\nbased buddy system seating plan. Perhaps\nher decision was based on her\nprofessional assessment that, because of\npast discriminatory practices, students\nin this particular school had difficulty\nin adjusting to a racially diverse\neducational environment. However, we\ncannot accept as adequate her conclusory\nexplanation. We must decide the case on\n\fthe record before us.\n\nC.   Qualified Immunity\n\n  An official entitled to qualified\nimmunity is not only immune from personal\nliability but also from suit. See Saucier\nv. Katz, 121 S. Ct. 2151, 2156 (2001).\nQualified immunity is available only to\nofficials with discretionary or policy-\nmaking authority who are acting in their\nofficial capacities. See Jacobs v. City\nof Chicago, 215 F.3d 758, 766 (7th Cir.\n2000). Such defendants are not subject to\nliability unless their actions violate\nclearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights then known to a\nreasonable officer. See Ulichny v. Merton\nCmty. Sch. Dist., 249 F.3d 686, 706 (7th\nCir. 2001).\n\n  The Supreme Court recently has\nreemphasized that entitlement to\nqualified immunity is determined by a\ntwo-step, sequential analysis. See\nSaucier, 121 S. Ct. at 2156; see also\nDenius v. Dunlap, 209 F.3d 944, 950 (7th\nCir. 2000). First, we ask if the facts\nalleged show the state actor’s conduct\nviolated a constitutional right when\nviewed in the light most favorable to the\nparty asserting the injury. See Saucier,\n121 S. Ct. at 2156. If the facts alleged\ndo not establish a constitutional\nviolation, there is no need to proceed to\nthe second step of the qualified immunity\nanalysis. See id. \"On the other hand, if\na violation could be made out on a\nfavorable view of the parties’\nsubmissions, the next, sequential step is\nto ask whether the right was clearly\nestablished.\" Id.\n\n  At this point in the litigation, our\nfocus must be on whether Ms. Zabel can\nassert, on the record before us,\nqualified immunity. In the earlier\nsection of our analysis, we determined\nthat the present record would support a\ndetermination that Ms. Zabel’s action in\nmandating that African-American children\nsit in pairs was violative of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. We therefore shall proceed to\nthe second step of the qualified immunity\nanalysis. We must determine whether\nB.B.’s right to be treated equally in the\nclassroom--specifically the right to be\nfree from race-based seating\narrangements--was clearly established\n\fwhen Ms. Zabel implemented the seating\narrangement.\n\n   In determining whether a right was\nclearly established at the time the\ndefendant acted, \"the right\nallegedlyviolated must be defined at the\nappropriate level of specificity before a\ncourt can determine if it was clearly\nestablished.\" Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.S.\n603, 615 (1999) (emphasis added). The\nSupreme Court has stated that the\n\"relevant, dispositive inquiry is whether\nit would be clear to a reasonable officer\nthat his conduct was unlawful in the\nsituation he confronted.\" Saucier, 121 S.\nCt. at 2156. In undertaking this inquiry,\nthe particular facts and the\ncircumstances confronting the official\nmust be considered. \"It is not necessary\nfor liability, however, that an identical\nfactual situation had been legally\ndecided adverse to the officer.\" Ulichny,\n249 F.3d at 706; see also Finn v. New\nMexico, 249 F.3d 1241, 1250 (10th Cir.\n2001) (\"[T]here need not be binding\nprecedent on ’all fours’ with the current\ncase . . . we require some, but not\nidentical, correspondence between the\ncases cited and the factual situation in\nthe case at hand.\"); Johnson v. Newburgh\nEnlarged Sch. Dist., 239 F.3d 246, 251\n(2d Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he absence of legal\nprecedent addressing an identical factual\nscenario does not necessarily yield a\nconclusion that the law is not clearly\nestablished.\").\n\n  Although the particular buddy system at\nissue here is, in all its particulars,\nperhaps unique to Ms. Zabel’s classroom,\nit is, in essence, a form of race-based\nseating that has been condemned by the\nSupreme Court as long ago as its decision\nin McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for\nHigher Education, 339 U.S. 637 (1950)./1\n\n  This initial condemnation of race-based\nseating in a school environment has been\nreinforced on numerous occasions, most\nnotably in the decisions that we have\ndiscussed earlier in this opinion that\nmake clear that state educators have the\nobligation to make student assignments in\na race-neutral manner in the absence of a\ncompelling government interest. Even\nthen, such a remedial race-based\ndistinction must be narrowly tailored to\nachieve that compelling government\ninterest. Certainly, as a public school\n\feducator, Ms. Zabel ought to have known\nof these well-established restrictions on\nthe use of race as a criteria. Yet, the\nrecord contains not a hint that, in\ndeciding to implement her buddy system,\nshe was attempting to address the past\neffects of discrimination that may have\nrequired this sort of attention to the\npresent needs of her students. Rather,\nthe record affirmatively indicates that\nshe relied on a stereotypical\ngeneralization about the way African-\nAmerican children learn.\n\n  Accordingly, on this record, we cannot\nsay that Ms. Zabel is entitled to\nqualified immunity. We do not preclude\nthe possibility that, on a more developed\nrecord, she may be able to demonstrate,\nwithout contradicting her earlier\ndeposition testimony, that it was\nreasonable to believe that the\nimplementation of this seating plan was\npermissible. However, for purposes of\ndisposing of the motion before us, we are\nbound by the record made by the parties\nin the district court, and, on that\nrecord, we cannot say that qualified\nimmunity is warranted.\n\nD.   School District Liability\n\n  A municipality may not be held\nvicariously liable, under sec. 1983, for\nthe unconstitutional acts of its\nemployees. See Monell v. Dep’t of Soc.\nServs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978); Smith\nv. Metro. Sch. Dist., 128 F.3d 1014, 1027\n(7th Cir. 1997). To establish that a\nmunicipality has violated an individual’s\ncivil rights under sec. 1983, the\nplaintiff must show one of the following:\n(1) that the city had an express policy\nthat, when enforced, causes a\nconstitutional deprivation; (2) that the\ncity had a widespread practice that,\nalthough not authorized by written law or\nexpress municipal policy, is so permanent\nand well-settled as to constitute a\ncustom or usage within the force of law;\nor (3) that the plaintiff’s\nconstitutional injury was caused by a\nperson with final policy-making\nauthority. See McCormick v. City of\nChicago, 230 F.3d 319, 324 (7th Cir.\n2000).\n\n  Of these three possible bases for\nfinding the school district liable, two\nclearly are not applicable. Regarding the\n\ffirst option, it is undisputed that the\nschool district does not have an express\npolicy or practice of seating African-\nAmerican or Hispanic children in pairs.\nOn the contrary, both Ms. Zabel and her\nstudent teacher, Zentner, testified that\nit was Ms. Zabel’s personal preference\nfor each minority student to have a\npartner. Therefore, the school district\ncannot be found liable under the first\noption.\n\n  With respect to the third option, it is\nuncontested that Ms. Zabel does not have\nfinal decision-making authority as a\nthird-grade teacher. Although Ms. Zabel’s\njob description was not provided in the\nrecord, elementary school teachers are\nuniformly required to instruct their\nstudents and conduct their classrooms in\na manner consistent with school board\npolicy. Consequently, Ms. Zabel is not a\nmunicipal policymaker.\n\n  The final option under which the school\ndistrict can be held liable also falls\nshort. In assessing whether such a\npervasive custom or policy exists, we\nhave required the plaintiff to present\nfacts showing that policymakers knew of\nthe conduct or that the conduct was so\nwidespread that they should have known.\nSee Latuszkin v. City of Chicago, 250\nF.3d 502, 505 (7th Cir. 2001); Bennett v.\nCity of Slidell, 735 F.2d 861, 862 (5th\nCir. 1984) (\"Actual or\nconstructiveknowledge of such custom must\nbe attributable to the governing body of\nthe municipality or to an official to\nwhom that body had delegated policy-\nmaking authority.\").\n\n  The Billings are unable to show that Ms.\nZabel’s racial seating arrangement was\nsufficiently well-established to\nconstitute a custom. The record will not\nsupport a determination that the race-\nbased seating arrangement used by Ms.\nZabel was so widespread and well-settled\nas to constitute a custom that fairly\nrepresents municipal policy. A classroom\nseating arrangement implemented by one\nthird-grade teacher during the beginning\nof the 1999-2000 school year hardly can\nbe considered widespread. Therefore, the\nBillings have failed to provide us with\nsufficient evidence to justify holding\nthe school board liable because its\nmembers had either actual or constructive\nknowledge. As a result, the school\n\fdistrict cannot be held liable for Ms.\nZabel’s race-based seating arrangement.\n\nConclusion\n\n   We affirm the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment with respect to the\nclaim that the classroom assignment\nprocess was discriminatory. On this\nrecord, however, we must conclude that a\ngrant of summary judgment for Ms. Zabel\non the issue of her seating arrangement\ncannot be sustained. Furthermore, on this\nrecord, Ms. Zabel is not entitled to\nqualified immunity. Lastly, the school\ndistrict cannot be held liable for Ms.\nZabel’s use of the seating arrangement.\nAll defendants with the exception of Ms.\nZabel may recover their costs in this\ncourt.\n\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED\nand REMANDED in part\n\nFOOTNOTE\n\n/1 In McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher\nEducation, 339 U.S. 637 (1950), the African-\nAmerican plaintiff was a graduate student who\nclaimed he had been denied equal educational\nopportunities because he was required to sit in\nspecial seats or at a special table designated\nfor African-Americans. The Supreme Court noted\nthat the special treatment McLaurin received\nbecause of his race set him apart from the other\nstudents. See id. at 641. As a result, the Court\nstated that McLaurin was \"handicapped\" in his\npursuit of an education, and \"his ability to\nstudy, to engage in discussions and exchange\nviews with other students\" was impaired. Id.\nConsequently, the Court held that the Fourteenth\nAmendment prohibited the state from treating\nstudents differently because of their race. See\nid. at 642. Based on this analysis, the Supreme\nCourt then concluded that African-American stu-\ndents \"must receive the same treatment at the\nhands of the state as students of other races.\"\nId.\n\f",

Bruce and Sharon\nBillings brought this action pursuant to\n42 U.S.C. sec. 1983 against the Madison\nMetropolitan School District (\"school\ndistrict\") and certain employees at John\nMuir Elementary School: Principal John\nBurmaster and teachers Nancy Zabel, Laura\nMueller, Sue Perry, Annie Keith, Robert\nWeisner, Sue Berthouex, and Shelly\nCosgrove. On behalf of their minor child,\nB.B., the Billings alleged a violation of\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the\nConstitution of the United States and a\nviolation of the Wisconsin Constitution.\nThe district court granted summary\njudgment for the defendants. The Billings\nnow appeal. For the reasons set forth in\nthe following opinion, we affirm in part\nand reverse in part the judgment of the\ndistrict court.\n\nI\nBACKGROUND\n\nA.   Facts\n\n  The Billings’ daughter, B.B., was a\nstudent at John Muir Elementary School in\n\fMadison, Wisconsin, from kindergarten\nuntil the middle of her third-grade year.\nThe Billings claim that B.B. was denied\nequal protection of the law because she\nwas placed in Ms. Zabel’s third-grade\nclass based on her race. They also claim\nthat, B.B., while in Ms. Zabel’s class,\nwas subjected to disparate treatment\nbecause of her race.\n\n1.   Placement\n\n  In the spring of 1999, second-grade\nteachers at John Muir met three or four\ntimes to discuss class assignments. The\nschool district had no policy or practice\nregarding the assignment of students to\nelementary school classes. The only\ninstructions to the teachers regarding\nstudent placement came in a memo from\nPrincipal Burmaster on May 4, 1999:\n\nAs we discussed at our staff meeting, the\nbasic outline for deciding and balancing\nclass lists will remain the same as in\nyears past: to the extent possible we\nshould attempt to balance classes\naccording to gender, ethnicity, academic\nabilities, and special needs while also\nconsidering the Parent Input sheet which\nshould have been returned to you. Please\nconsult with Special Ed teachers if you\nhave concerns or questions about\nprogramming needs of EEN students. You\nshould have gotten a copy of the \"Student\nInventory\" card that Kristen mentioned in\nyour mailbox. I hope that it makes your\njob easier. I will try to get to as many\nof your placement meetings as possible.\nThank you for your devotion to this\ndifficult and important task.\n\nBurmaster Aff. para. 8, Ex.E.\n\n  Sue Perry, Annie Keith, and Sue\nBerthouex were involved in assigning\nsecond-grade students to third-grade\nclasses in the spring of 1999. The\nteachers prepared an index card for each\nof their students. The index card\ncontained biographical data including\nacademic abilities, behavioral issues,\nspecial education needs (if any),\nethnicity, neighborhood, gender, reading\nlevel, and math level. The teachers then\nused the information on the index cards\nin an attempt to assign the children so\nthe classes reflected the overall\nbiographical makeup of the third grade at\nJohn Muir. Academic criteria were used to\n\fdistribute high and low achieving\nstudents evenly throughout the third-\ngrade classes. To fairly distribute the\nworkload among teachers, the special\neducation status of a child also was\nconsidered to ensure a roughly equal\ndistribution of special education\nstudents in each class. The ethnicity of\nthe students only was considered as a\ngeneral guideline to ensure that none of\nthe classrooms contained a\ndisproportionate number of minority\nstudents. The neighborhood where the\nchild resided only was considered to\navoid isolating a child from\nstudentsliving in his or her particular\nneighborhood.\n\n  Although Ms. Perry and Ms. Cosgrove\njointly taught B.B.’s second-grade class,\nMs. Cosgrove did not attend the class\nassignment meetings. Consequently, it was\nMs. Perry who recommended that B.B. be\nassigned to Ms. Zabel’s third-grade\nclass. In making her decision, she\nreviewed the composition of two other\nthird-grade classrooms, those taught by\nMary Bostrom and Lesley Wilke-Nadler. Ms.\nPerry selected Ms. Zabel’s class for two\nreasons: (1) the Billings had expressed a\ndesire for B.B. to be with a teacher who\nhad high expectations, and Ms. Perry\nbelieved Ms. Zabel would meet those\nneeds; (2) B.B. had had some negative\nincidents with special education students\nassigned to Ms. Bostrom’s and Ms. Wilke-\nNadler’s classrooms. Additionally, Ms.\nZabel’s class was comprised of students\nwith a broad range of academic aptitudes\nfrom low to above-average.\n\n2.  Treatment\n  Early in the 1999-2000 school year, Ms.\nZabel divided her class into two groups\nof six and three groups of four. She\nexplained that \"in a group of four I\nwould put two African-Americans\ntogether.\" Zabel Dep., Vol.II, at 33.\nWhen asked why she seated African-\nAmerican students in pairs, Ms. Zabel\nstated, \"I think in my education training\nsometimes we were told that African-\nAmerican students need a buddy, and\nsometimes it works well if they have\nsomeone else working with them because\nthey view things in a global manner.\" Id.\nDeana Marie Zentner, a student teacher in\nMs. Zabel’s class in the beginning of the\n1999-2000 school year, corroborated this\ntestimony. When asked about the classroom\n\fseating arrangement, Zentner stated that\nMs. Zabel \"tried to have two African-\nAmerican students at each cluster and\nalso did the same with the Hispanic\nstudents.\" Zentner Dep. at 70-71.\n\nB.   District Court Proceedings\n\n  The Billings were unable to resolve\nthese issues with the defendants.\nConsequently, the Billings brought this\naction in district court. In their\ncomplaint, they alleged that both B.B.’s\nassignment to Ms. Zabel’s class and her\ntreatment while in that class violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause. The\ndefendants moved for summary judgment,\nwhich the district court granted. The\ndistrict court first concluded that,\nalthough race was considered as a factor\nin the overall class assignment process,\nthere was no evidence that B.B. was\nplaced in Ms. Zabel’s class because of\nher race. As a result, the district court\nheld that the decision to place B.B. in\nMs. Zabel’s class did not deny B.B. equal\nprotection of the law. Furthermore, the\ncourt stated that there was no evidence\nwhatsoever to suggest that B.B. was\nplaced in Ms. Zabel’s class to serve as a\nrole model for low-income African-\nAmerican students, as the Billings had\nalleged.\n\n  The district court also dismissed the\nBillings’ disparate treatment claim that\nalleged that Ms. Zabel treated B.B.\ndifferently in the classroom because she\nwas an African-American. Despite Ms.\nZabel’s own admission in her deposition\nthat she sat African-American students in\npairs because she believed they needed a\nbuddy, the district court found that\nthere was no evidence that B.B. was\ntreated differently from children of\nother races. Additionally, the district\ncourt held that even if Ms. Zabel seated\nAfrican-American children together in her\nclassroom, such a seating arrangement,\nwithout more, was insufficient to support\na claim that B.B. was denied equal access\nto educational opportunities. The\nBillings now appeal.\n\n\nII\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\f  Summary judgment is permissible when\n\"there is no genuine issue as to any\nmaterial fact and . . . the moving party\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of\nlaw.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). This court\nreviews the district court’s grant\nofsummary judgment de novo. See Cliff v.\nBd. of Sch. Comm’rs, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 408\n(7th Cir. 1994). To survive a motion for\nsummary judgment, the Billings must make\na showing sufficient to establish each\nessential element of their cause of\naction for which they will bear the\nburden of persuasion at trial. See\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">317</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n322 (1986); Draghi v.

In other\nwords, if the Billings do not produce\nevidence sufficient to sustain a jury\nverdict in their favor, we shall affirm\nthe district court’s grant of the\ndefendants’ motion for summary judgment.\n\nB. Prima Facie Case for an Equal\nProtection Violation\n\n  The Billings allege, on behalf of their\nminor daughter, B.B., a violation of the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. A plaintiff asserting an equal\nprotection violation must establish that\na state actor has treated him differently\nfrom persons of a different race and that\nthe state actor did so purposefully. See\nWashington v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 239-42\n(1976); DeWalt v. Carter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770154\"><a href=\"/opinion/770154/anthony-dewalt-v-lamark-carter-correctional-officer-young-carol-biester/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n618 (7th Cir. 2000). The Billings allege\nthat the defendants violated the Equal\nProtection Clause in two separate ways.\nWe shall now address each of these\nclaims.\n\n1.   Class Placement\n\n  The Billings claim that B.B.’s third-\ngrade classroom assignment for the 1999-\n2000 school year was based on race. The\ndistrict court held that the Billings did\nnot meet their burden of showing that Ms.\nPerry assigned B.B. to Ms. Zabel’s class\nbased on B.B.’s race. In our view, the\nrecord supports the district court’s\nholding. Evidence in the record shows\nthat Ms. Perry made her decision based on\ntwo race-neutral reasons: (1) B.B.’s\nparents had expressed their desire for\nB.B. to be with a teacher who had high\nexpectations, and Ms. Perry believed Ms.\nZabel would meet those needs; (2) Ms.\n\fPerry did not select the two remaining\nclassrooms because B.B. had experienced\nproblems with special education students\nplaced in each of those classrooms.\n\n  These race-neutral reasons will not\nsupport an equal protection violation. A\nplaintiff asserting an equal protection\nviolation must establish that a state\nactor purposefully treated him\ndifferently because of his race. See\nCoalition to Save Our Children v. State\nBd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"722543\"><a href=\"/opinion/722543/coalition-to-save-our-children-v-state-board-of-education-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">752</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 763 (3d Cir.\n1996) (holding that, although a\ndisproportionate number of African-\nAmerican students were placed in special\neducation, there was no equal protection\nviolation because the record revealed\nthat placement was accomplished solely\nthrough the use of race-neutral\ncriteria). Indeed, the Billings even have\nfailed to show that there was a\ndisproportionate number of African-\nAmerican students in the class to which\nB.B. was assigned. Ms. Zabel’s class had\nslightly more African-American students--\none more than Ms. Bostrom’s, two more\nthan Mr. Weisner’s, and three more than\nMs. Wilke-Nadler’s--but overall Ms.\nZabel’s, Mr. Weisner’s, and Ms. Wilke-\nNadler’s classrooms each had a total of\ntwelve minority students.\n\n  In a further effort to show that B.B.\nwas placed in Ms. Zabel’s class because\nof her race, the Billings maintain that\nB.B. was assigned to that section to\nserve as a role model for other African-\nAmerican students. The Billings rely\nheavily on the Supreme Court’s decision\nin Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111669\"><a href=\"/opinion/111669/wygant-v-jackson-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">267</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986) (plurality opinion),\nto support their claim that such a\nmotivation for classroom placement\nviolated B.B.’s equal protection rights.\n\n  The record shows that B.B. was the only\nAfrican-American student in the class who\ndid not live in Wexford Ridge, a\nneighborhood within the school district\nwhere a number of African-American\nstudents lived. She was also the only\nAfrican-American student without a low\naptitude in reading and math.\nNonetheless, the district court\ndetermined that, without question, B.B.\nwas not assigned to Ms. Zabel’s class to\nbe a role model. We agree. The Billings\nprovide no evidence that Ms. Perry ever\nconsidered that B.B. could be a role\n\fmodel for other African-American students\nor assigned her to Ms. Zabel’s class for\nthat reason. On the contrary, as we\nalready have noted, the record makes\nclear that Ms. Perry had race-neutral\nreasons for making the placement.\n\n  The Billings only became concerned about\nB.B.’s possible status as a role model\nafter a telephone conversation between\nPrincipal Burmaster and Mrs. Billings.\nDuring this conversation, which focused\nprimarily on a disciplinary incident in\nMs. Zabel’s class, Principal Burmaster\nmentioned that he hoped B.B. could be a\nrole model for \"these other children.\"\nSharon Billings Dep. at 111. Principal\nBurmaster’s remark is ambiguous as to the\nchildren for whom he hoped that B.B.\ncould be a role model; the Billings have\nprovided no evidence justifying their\nassumption that the principal was\nreferring only to African-American\nstudents. Additionally, the principal’s\noffhand remark is irrelevant to our\nreview of the assignment process because\nit is undisputed that Principal Burmaster\ndid not participate in making the\nclassroom assignments.\n\n  The Billings have failed to establish a\nprima facie case for an equal protection\nviolation on their claim that B.B. was\nassigned to Ms. Zabel’s class on the\nbasis of race. The district court\ncorrectly determined that summary\njudgment ought to be granted to the\ndefendants on this claim.\n\n2.   Equal Education Opportunities\n\n  The Billings also claim that B.B. was\ndenied educational opportunities equal to\nthose of white students. They make two\nallegations in this regard. First, the\nBillings claim that Ms. Zabel did not\ngive B.B. individualized instruction in a\nmanner comparable to the assistance she\ngave to white students with similar\nacademic capabilities. The Billings have\nprovided no evidence that Ms. Zabel gave\nwhite students more challenging\nassignments than B.B. Therefore, because\nthis argument is devoid of supporting\nevidence in the record, it warrants no\nfurther discussion.\n\n  The Billings’ second claim of denial of\nequal educational opportunities requires\nsignificantly more analysis. They\n\fmaintain that Ms. Zabel treated B.B.\ndifferently because of her race in the\nclassroom seating arrangement: that Ms.\nZabel required that African-American and\nHispanic students sit in pairs in class.\nAlthough Ms. Zabel’s deposition testimony\nis not without ambiguity, this claim\nappears supported by both that testimony\nas well as her student teacher’s\ntestimony. Not only did Ms. Zabel admit\nthat, at an early period in the school\nyear, she arranged for minority students\nto sit in pairs in her classroom, but she\nstated that she did so purposefully. Ms.\nZabel explained that she utilized the\nrace-conscious seating arrangement\nbecause she believed that African-\nAmerican students \"need\" a partner\nbecause \"they view things in a global\nmanner.\" Zabel Dep., Vol.II, at 33.\n\n  \"Racial and ethnic distinctions of any\nsort are inherently suspect and thus call\nfor the most exacting judicial\nexamination.\" Regents of Univ. of Cal. v.\nBakke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291 (1978) (opinion\nof Powell, J.).

In Brown,\na unanimous Supreme Court pointedly\nstated that to separate children \"from\nothers of similar age and qualifications\nsolely because of their race generates a\nfeeling of inferiority as to their status\nin the community that may affect their\nhearts and minds in a way unlikely ever\nto be undone.\" Id. at 494.

It was also of\nshort duration. Yet it did involve\nsetting apart certain students for\ndifferent treatment solely on account of\ntheir race. Although the effect on the\nstudent from this relatively minor and\ntransitory discrimination might well have\nbeen minimal, especially when compared\nwith the situations in more pervasive and\nenduring educational discrimination, our\nfaithfulness to constitutional principles\ndoes not permit us to overlook it or to\ndeclare it a de minimis matter.\n\n  In requiring that African-American and\nHispanic students sit in pairs, Ms. Zabel\nmay have believed that she was acting in\ntheir best interest. Nevertheless, her\naction was based purely on the race of\nthe student, and differences in treatment\nbased on race in the classroom must be\nregarded as highly suspect.

On this record,\nwithout any justification other than Ms.\nZabel’s stereotypical notion as to how\nAfrican-American children learn, her\naction cannot be justified, and,\nconsequently, summary judgment is\ninappropriate. It may be that, in further\nproceedings, Ms. Zabel will be able to\nexplain in a more satisfactory manner the\nreasons for her adoption of the racially\nbased buddy system seating plan. Perhaps\nher decision was based on her\nprofessional assessment that, because of\npast discriminatory practices, students\nin this particular school had difficulty\nin adjusting to a racially diverse\neducational environment. However, we\ncannot accept as adequate her conclusory\nexplanation. We must decide the case on\n\fthe record before us.\n\nC.   Qualified Immunity\n\n  An official entitled to qualified\nimmunity is not only immune from personal\nliability but also from suit. See Saucier\nv. Katz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2156 (2001).\nQualified immunity is available only to\nofficials with discretionary or policy-\nmaking authority who are acting in their\nofficial capacities. See Jacobs v. City\nof Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769087\"><a href=\"/opinion/769087/willie-jacobs-and-linda-siller-v-city-of-chicago-a-municipal-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">758</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 766 (7th Cir.\n2000). Such defendants are not subject to\nliability unless their actions violate\nclearly established statutory or\nconstitutional rights then known to a\nreasonable officer. See Ulichny v. Merton\nCmty. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773170\"><a href=\"/opinion/773170/susan-ulichny-v-merton-community-school-district-mark-flynn-timothy-f/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">686</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 706 (7th\nCir. 2001).\n\n  The Supreme Court recently has\nreemphasized that entitlement to\nqualified immunity is determined by a\ntwo-step, sequential analysis. See\nSaucier, 121 S. Ct. at 2156; see also\nDenius v. Dunlap, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768380\"><a href=\"/opinion/768380/ronald-c-denius-v-wayne-dunlap-and-gary-sadler-1/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">944</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 950 (7th\nCir. 2000). First, we ask if the facts\nalleged show the state actor’s conduct\nviolated a constitutional right when\nviewed in the light most favorable to the\nparty asserting the injury. See Saucier,\n121 S. Ct. at 2156. If the facts alleged\ndo not establish a constitutional\nviolation, there is no need to proceed to\nthe second step of the qualified immunity\nanalysis. See id. \"On the other hand, if\na violation could be made out on a\nfavorable view of the parties’\nsubmissions, the next, sequential step is\nto ask whether the right was clearly\nestablished.\" Id.\n\n  At this point in the litigation, our\nfocus must be on whether Ms. Zabel can\nassert, on the record before us,\nqualified immunity. In the earlier\nsection of our analysis, we determined\nthat the present record would support a\ndetermination that Ms. Zabel’s action in\nmandating that African-American children\nsit in pairs was violative of the Equal\nProtection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. We therefore shall proceed to\nthe second step of the qualified immunity\nanalysis. We must determine whether\nB.B.’s right to be treated equally in the\nclassroom--specifically the right to be\nfree from race-based seating\narrangements--was clearly established\n\fwhen Ms. Zabel implemented the seating\narrangement.\n\n   In determining whether a right was\nclearly established at the time the\ndefendant acted, \"the right\nallegedlyviolated must be defined at the\nappropriate level of specificity before a\ncourt can determine if it was clearly\nestablished.\" Wilson v.

In undertaking this inquiry,\nthe particular facts and the\ncircumstances confronting the official\nmust be considered. \"It is not necessary\nfor liability, however, that an identical\nfactual situation had been legally\ndecided adverse to the officer.\" Ulichny,\n249 F.3d at 706; see also Finn v.

Oklahoma State Regents for\nHigher Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104805\"><a href=\"/opinion/104805/mclaurin-v-oklahoma-state-regents-for-higher-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1950)./1\n\n  This initial condemnation of race-based\nseating in a school environment has been\nreinforced on numerous occasions, most\nnotably in the decisions that we have\ndiscussed earlier in this opinion that\nmake clear that state educators have the\nobligation to make student assignments in\na race-neutral manner in the absence of a\ncompelling government interest. Even\nthen, such a remedial race-based\ndistinction must be narrowly tailored to\nachieve that compelling government\ninterest. Certainly, as a public school\n\feducator, Ms. Zabel ought to have known\nof these well-established restrictions on\nthe use of race as a criteria. Yet, the\nrecord contains not a hint that, in\ndeciding to implement her buddy system,\nshe was attempting to address the past\neffects of discrimination that may have\nrequired this sort of attention to the\npresent needs of her students. Rather,\nthe record affirmatively indicates that\nshe relied on a stereotypical\ngeneralization about the way African-\nAmerican children learn.\n\n  Accordingly, on this record, we cannot\nsay that Ms. Zabel is entitled to\nqualified immunity. We do not preclude\nthe possibility that, on a more developed\nrecord, she may be able to demonstrate,\nwithout contradicting her earlier\ndeposition testimony, that it was\nreasonable to believe that the\nimplementation of this seating plan was\npermissible. However, for purposes of\ndisposing of the motion before us, we are\nbound by the record made by the parties\nin the district court, and, on that\nrecord, we cannot say that qualified\nimmunity is warranted.\n\nD.   School District Liability\n\n  A municipality may not be held\nvicariously liable, under sec. 1983, for\nthe unconstitutional acts of its\nemployees. See Monell v. Dep’t of Soc.\nServs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 694 (1978); Smith\nv.

To establish that a\nmunicipality has violated an individual’s\ncivil rights under sec. 1983, the\nplaintiff must show one of the following:\n(1) that the city had an express policy\nthat, when enforced, causes a\nconstitutional deprivation; (2) that the\ncity had a widespread practice that,\nalthough not authorized by written law or\nexpress municipal policy, is so permanent\nand well-settled as to constitute a\ncustom or usage within the force of law;\nor (3) that the plaintiff’s\nconstitutional injury was caused by a\nperson with final policy-making\nauthority. See McCormick v. City of\nChicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770865\"><a href=\"/opinion/770865/donald-mccormick-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">319</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 324 (7th Cir.\n2000).\n\n  Of these three possible bases for\nfinding the school district liable, two\nclearly are not applicable. Regarding the\n\ffirst option, it is undisputed that the\nschool district does not have an express\npolicy or practice of seating African-\nAmerican or Hispanic children in pairs.\nOn the contrary, both Ms. Zabel and her\nstudent teacher, Zentner, testified that\nit was Ms. Zabel’s personal preference\nfor each minority student to have a\npartner. Therefore, the school district\ncannot be found liable under the first\noption.\n\n  With respect to the third option, it is\nuncontested that Ms. Zabel does not have\nfinal decision-making authority as a\nthird-grade teacher. Although Ms. Zabel’s\njob description was not provided in the\nrecord, elementary school teachers are\nuniformly required to instruct their\nstudents and conduct their classrooms in\na manner consistent with school board\npolicy. Consequently, Ms. Zabel is not a\nmunicipal policymaker.\n\n  The final option under which the school\ndistrict can be held liable also falls\nshort. In assessing whether such a\npervasive custom or policy exists, we\nhave required the plaintiff to present\nfacts showing that policymakers knew of\nthe conduct or that the conduct was so\nwidespread that they should have known.\nSee Latuszkin v. City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773288\"><a href=\"/opinion/773288/nickolaj-latuszkin-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (7th Cir. 2001); Bennett v.\nCity of Slidell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"436257\"><a href=\"/opinion/436257/henry-j-bennett-jr-v-city-of-slidell-gerry-hinton-be-mcdaniel/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">861</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 862 (5th\nCir. 1984) (\"Actual or\nconstructiveknowledge of such custom must\nbe attributable to the governing body of\nthe municipality or to an official to\nwhom that body had delegated policy-\nmaking authority.\").\n\n  The Billings are unable to show that Ms.\nZabel’s racial seating arrangement was\nsufficiently well-established to\nconstitute a custom. The record will not\nsupport a determination that the race-\nbased seating arrangement used by Ms.\nZabel was so widespread and well-settled\nas to constitute a custom that fairly\nrepresents municipal policy. A classroom\nseating arrangement implemented by one\nthird-grade teacher during the beginning\nof the 1999-2000 school year hardly can\nbe considered widespread. Therefore, the\nBillings have failed to provide us with\nsufficient evidence to justify holding\nthe school board liable because its\nmembers had either actual or constructive\nknowledge. As a result, the school\n\fdistrict cannot be held liable for Ms.\nZabel’s race-based seating arrangement.\n\nConclusion\n\n   We affirm the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment with respect to the\nclaim that the classroom assignment\nprocess was discriminatory. On this\nrecord, however, we must conclude that a\ngrant of summary judgment for Ms. Zabel\non the issue of her seating arrangement\ncannot be sustained. Furthermore, on this\nrecord, Ms. Zabel is not entitled to\nqualified immunity. Lastly, the school\ndistrict cannot be held liable for Ms.\nZabel’s use of the seating arrangement.\nAll defendants with the exception of Ms.\nZabel may recover their costs in this\ncourt.\n\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED\nand REMANDED in part\n\nFOOTNOTE\n\n/1 In McLaurin v.

The Supreme Court noted\nthat the special treatment McLaurin received\nbecause of his race set him apart from the other\nstudents. See id. at 641. As a result, the Court\nstated that McLaurin was \"handicapped\" in his\npursuit of an education, and \"his ability to\nstudy, to engage in discussions and exchange\nviews with other students\" was impaired. Id.\nConsequently, the Court held that the Fourteenth\nAmendment prohibited the state from treating\nstudents differently because of their race. See\nid. at 642. Based on this analysis, the Supreme\nCourt then concluded that African-American stu-\ndents \"must receive the same treatment at the\nhands of the state as students of other races.\"\nId.\n\f</pre>",
