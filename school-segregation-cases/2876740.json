The Met Council, an administrative agency that coordinates\nplanning and development in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, removed the\ncase to federal district court. The NAACP and the student class moved to remand the\ncase to state court. The district court remanded all claims against the state defendants,\nbut denied the motion to remand claims against the Met Council. The district court\nbased its removal jurisdiction on the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (1994), and the\nartful pleading doctrine recognized in Federated Dep’t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, 452 U.S.\n394, 397 n.2 (1981). The district court then granted the Met Council’s motion under\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) to dismiss all claims against it as precluded\nby an earlier federal judgment. The NAACP and the student class appeal, contending\ntheir claims against the Met Council were not removable, and even if they were, the\ndistrict court improperly applied federal res judicata law because this case and the\nearlier lawsuit involve different causes of action against the Met Council as well as\ndifferent parties.\n\n      The issues in this appeal spring from the relation of this action to an earlier class\naction, Hollman v. Cisneros, brought in federal court by the NAACP and a class\nconsisting of minority persons and their families living in, or applying for, low-income\nhousing in Minneapolis (the Hollman class). Filed in 1992, the Hollman lawsuit\nclaimed public housing in Minneapolis was concentrated in racially segregated\nneighborhoods. The NAACP and the Hollman class contended the Met Council had\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fviolated the federal Fair Housing Act by failing to encourage development of low-\nincome housing in Twin Cities’ suburbs, as well as by approving funding for suburban\nsewer and road projects and thus “accelerat[ing] the polarization of the metro area by\nincome and race.” The lawsuit was settled by consent decree in Hollman v. Cisneros,\nCiv. No. 4-92-712 (D. Minn. filed Apr. 21, 1995). In the Hollman decree, the Met\nCouncil agreed to undertake numerous complex responsibilities to help “achieve a\nmetropolitan distribution of affordable housing.” Among these, the Met Council agreed\nto consider low-income housing distribution in its “decisions and recommendations\nregarding the . . . funding, construction, or approval of regional wastewater and\ntransportation facilities.” The parties agreed to submit periodic progress reports to the\ndistrict court, and the district court retained jurisdiction to issue “such further orders\nas may be necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this Decree.”\n\n        Six months after the district court entered judgment in Hollman, the NAACP\nfiled this lawsuit in state court “on behalf of a plaintiff class consisting of all students\nenrolled . . . in the Minneapolis public schools,” which necessarily includes students\nwho live in low-income housing and belong to the Hollman class. The plaintiffs\n(appellants before this court) claimed that because the Minneapolis public schools have\ndisproportionate enrollments of poor and minority students, generating “negative\neffects” that “depress[] . . . educational achievement,” Minneapolis public school\nstudents as a whole are being denied their right to receive an adequate education in\nviolation of the Education and Equal Protection Clauses of the Minnesota Constitution.\nSee Skeen v. State, 505 N.W.2d 299, 313 (Minn. 1993) (recognizing education as a\nfundamental right under the state constitution). The class-action complaint linked\nschool enrollments to housing, alleging the defendants, including the Met Council, had\n“adopted . . . policies and practices that result in housing segregated by race and\nsocioeconomic status in the metropolitan area, . . . result[ing] in segregation . . . in the\nMinneapolis public schools.” The plaintiffs objected to excessive spending on\nsuburban infrastructure and to “transportation policies that . . . enable[] ‘white flight’\nto suburbs,” and faulted the Met Council for failing “to require . . . suburban\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fcommunities . . . to promote the development of low and moderate income housing.”\n In sustaining removal of, and then dismissing, the claims against the Met Council, the\ndistrict court found the claims “focus exclusively on [the Met Council’s] housing\npolicies and practices, the subject of the Hollman lawsuit.”\n\n        We consider first whether the district court properly exercised removal\njurisdiction under the authority granted federal courts by the All Writs Act to “issue all\nwrits necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to\nthe usages and principles of law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). Although the All Writs Act\nis not an independent grant of jurisdiction, see White v. National Football League, 41\nF.3d 402, 409 (8th Cir. 1994), the Act empowers a federal court “to issue such\ncommands . . . as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the\nfrustration of orders it has previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction otherwise\nobtained,” United States v. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172 (1977). There is\nno dispute the district court properly obtained jurisdiction in Hollman. Under the terms\nof the Hollman decree, the district court retains jurisdiction to supervise compliance\nwith the decree’s provisions until the year 2002. The decree sets forth the Met\nCouncil’s agreement with the NAACP and the Hollman class that it will alter its\npolicies and practices with respect to housing, wastewater facilities, and transportation\nin the Twin Cities’ metropolitan area. Further, the Hollman decree includes a general\nrelease barring relitigation by any party of “any matters alleged in this action.”\n\n       In this suit, the NAACP and the student class seek state injunctive relief against\nthe Met Council concerning the very matters the Hollman decree governs. Although\nthis class action is not removable under the federal removal statutes, the district court\nwas confronted with a situation where parties subject to the district court’s continuing\njurisdiction under the Hollman decree--the NAACP and those student class members\nbelonging to the Hollman class--were resorting to a state forum to relitigate settled and\nreleased claims. Faced with this circumstance, we believe the district court was\nwarranted in authorizing removal from state court under the All Writs Act to protect the\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fintegrity of the federal consent decree entered in Hollman, see In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab. Litig., 996 F.2d 1425, 1431 (2d Cir. 1993), even though removal also brought into\nfederal court those members of the student class who were not involved in Hollman, see\nNew York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. at 174 (federal court’s power under All Writs Act may\nencompass “persons who [were] not parties to the original action”). See also In re\nVMS Sec. Litig., 103 F.3d 1317, 1323-24 (7th Cir. 1996) (approving removal under All\nWrits Act to enforce orders against relitigation and to guard integrity of earlier rulings\nover which district court retained jurisdiction); Sable v. General Motors Corp., 90 F.3d\n171, 175 (6th Cir. 1996) (upholding removal under All Writs Act to protect federal\nconsent decree from conflicting state orders); Yonkers Racing Corp. v. City of Yonkers,\n858 F.2d 855, 863-65 (2d Cir. 1988) (holding removal proper under All Writs Act to\nprotect integrity of federal consent decree and because issues raised in state suit were\ninseparable from relief provided by the decree); but see Hillman v. Webley, 115 F.3d\n1461, 1469 (10th Cir. 1997) (holding All Writs Act may not be used as basis for\nremoval, but district court may “enjoin parties before it from pursuing conflicting\nlitigation in the state court”). Further, if we held these claims unremovable under the\nAll Writs Act, any state-court orders affecting the Met Council inconsistent with the\nHollman decree “would be subject to the injunctive powers of the federal court under\nthe exception provisions of the Anti-Injunction Act.” Yonkers, 858 F.2d at 864. Given\nthe choices available to the district court, we think removal in this case better preserves\nstate-federal relations than would later resort to an injunction because it spares the\nHennepin County District Court from expending judicial resources to no avail. Because\nwe conclude removal was proper under the All Writs Act, we need not determine\nwhether removal was also warranted under the artful pleading doctrine.\n\n      Having decided the district court properly exercised removal jurisdiction over\nclaims asserted against the Met Council, we now turn to the district court’s res judicata\ndismissal of those claims as precluded by Hollman. Our review is de novo, on both\nprocedural and substantive grounds. See Coleman v. Watt, 40 F.3d 255, 258 (8th Cir.\n1994) (appeal from dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)); Poe v. John Deere Co., 695 F.2d\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f1103, 1105 (8th Cir. 1982) (federal law governs res judicata effect of an earlier federal\njudgment based on federal law). Under the doctrine of res judicata, or claim preclusion,\n“‘a final judgment on the merits bars further claims by parties or their privies based on\nthe same cause of action.’” United States v. Gurley, 43 F.3d 1188, 1195 (8th Cir. 1994)\n(quoting Montana v. United States, 440 U.S. 147, 153 (1979)). Specifically, the earlier\nHollman litigation precludes claims against the Met Council in this lawsuit if (1) the\nearlier suit resulted in a final judgment on the merits, (2) the earlier suit was based on\nproper jurisdiction, (3) both suits involved the same cause of action, and (4) both suits\ninvolved the same parties or their privies. See United States EPA v. City of Green\nForest, Ark., 921 F.2d 1394, 1403 (8th Cir. 1990). A consent decree is a final judgment\non the merits, see id., and no one challenges the jurisdiction of the Hollman court.\nConsequently, this appeal turns on whether this suit involves the same cause of action\nagainst the Met Council, and the same parties or their privies, as in Hollman.\n\n       Initially, the NAACP and the student class contend this suit and Hollman involve\ndifferent causes of action because Hollman claimed Fair Housing Act violations while\nthis suit asserts violations of a right to an adequate education under the Minnesota\nConstitution. This argument misses the mark. The same cause of action framed in\nterms of a new legal theory is still the same cause of action. See Gurley, 43 F.3d at\n1195. The claims against the Met Council in this suit involve the same cause of action\nas the claims against the Met Council in Hollman if both sets of claims “‘arise[] out of\nthe same nucleus of operative facts.’” Id. (quoting Lane v. Peterson, 899 F.2d 737, 742\n(8th Cir. 1990)). “In the final analysis, the test [is] whether the wrong for which redress\nis sought is the same in both actions.” Id. at 1196 (internal quotations omitted;\nemphasis in Gurley). As against the Met Council, this suit seeks what Hollman sought:\nto end the claimed segregative effect of the Met Council’s policies and practices\nconcerning housing and related infrastructure projects in the Twin Cities’ metropolitan\narea. Despite the argument of the NAACP and the student class to the contrary, the fact\ntheir complaint alleges the Met Council failed “to coordinate school\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fdesegregation/integration efforts with the housing, social, economic, and infrastructure\nneeds of the metropolitan area” does not affect our conclusion that, as far as the claims\nagainst the Met Council are concerned, this suit and Hollman involve the same cause\nof action. The “failure to coordinate” claim pertains to one of the state defendants, the\nOffice of Desegregation/Integration in Minnesota’s Department of Education, because\nthat Office, not the Met Council, shoulders the statutory responsibility for undertaking\ncoordination efforts. See Minn. Stat. Ann. § 121.1601 (West Supp. 1997) (creating\nDesegregation Office and prescribing its duties). Otherwise, neither the plaintiffs’\ncomplaint nor their brief suggests the Met Council bears any responsibility for public\neducation under Minnesota law.\n\n       Finally, we must determine whether this suit and Hollman involve the same\nparties or their privies. The NAACP was a party to Hollman, and it brought this suit on\nbehalf of the student class. As defined in the plaintiffs’ complaint, the student class\nnecessarily includes students who live in low-income housing and belong to the Hollman\nclass. We cannot determine the extent of class overlap, but it may be extensive because\nthe plaintiffs’ complaint states “the Minneapolis public schools have an extraordinary\nproportion of children living in poverty among their student populations,” an assertion\nwe must accept as true. See Coleman, 40 F.3d at 258. Given the two classes overlap\nbut are not identical, the question we must answer is whether the student class in this\ncase is in privity with the Hollman class.\n\n       Because the student class in this suit neither controlled the Hollman action nor\nare successors-in-interest to the Hollman class, the resolution of the privity issue\ndepends on whether the student class was adequately represented in the earlier action\nby the Hollman class. See Tyus v. Schoemehl, 93 F.3d 449, 454 (8th Cir. 1996), cert.\ndenied, 117 S. Ct. 1427 (1997). In this circuit, “‘a person may be bound by a judgment\neven though not a party if one of the parties to the suit is so closely aligned with [the\nperson’s] interests as to be [that person’s] virtual representative.’” Id. (quoting Aerojet-\nGeneral Corp. v. Askew, 511 F.2d 710, 719 (5th Cir. 1975)). Nonparty preclusion\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fbased on virtual representation involves an equitable, case-by-case inquiry, and there\nis no clear test for courts to apply. See id. at 455. Nevertheless, analyzing a particular\ncase in light of the factors the court identified in Tyus enables us to “ensure that the\nrelationship between the party to the original suit and the party sought to be precluded\nin the later suit is sufficiently close to justify preclusion.” Id. at 454.\n\n       Although not enough by itself, identity of interests between the parties is\nessential. See id. at 455. This requirement is satisfied here. As against the Met\nCouncil, the interests of the Hollman class and the student class are virtually the same.\nThe only difference is the Hollman class sued the Met Council to secure broader\ngeographical distribution of low-income housing as an end in itself, while the student\nclass seeks the same relief against the Met Council as a means to the end of improving\neducation. Furthermore, the Hollman class adequately represented the interests it shares\nwith the student class because the Hollman class had a powerful incentive to establish\nthe segregative effects of the Met Council’s housing policies and practices. See id. at\n455-56. After all, the Hollman class could not prevail in its lawsuit against the Met\nCouncil without successfully litigating the same kind of claims raised against the Met\nCouncil by the student class in this case. Although incentive to litigate, not results, is\nthe key, see id. at 458, the Hollman plaintiffs secured commitments of more than $100\nmillion to promote the spread of low-income housing in the Twin Cities’ metropolitan\narea--which in turn, according to the plaintiffs’ complaint in this suit, will improve\neducational achievement in the Minneapolis schools.\n\n       Because the memberships of the student and Hollman classes overlap, it is clear\nto us the parties in the two suits are not strangers to one another. Indeed, the student\nmembers of the Hollman class actually participated in that litigation. See id. at 455.\nAdding these considerations to the two classes’ closely aligned interests, and the\nHollman class’s incentive to protect those interests in the earlier suit, we are satisfied\nthat the members of the student class were adequately represented by, and thus are in\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fprivity with, the Hollman class. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the\nclaims against the Met Council as precluded by Hollman.\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f",

Cisneros, brought in federal court by the NAACP and a class\nconsisting of minority persons and their families living in, or applying for, low-income\nhousing in Minneapolis (the Hollman class). Filed in 1992, the Hollman lawsuit\nclaimed public housing in Minneapolis was concentrated in racially segregated\nneighborhoods. The NAACP and the Hollman class contended the Met Council had\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fviolated the federal Fair Housing Act by failing to encourage development of low-\nincome housing in Twin Cities’ suburbs, as well as by approving funding for suburban\nsewer and road projects and thus “accelerat[ing] the polarization of the metro area by\nincome and race.” The lawsuit was settled by consent decree in Hollman v. Cisneros,\nCiv. No. 4-92-712 (D. Minn. filed Apr. 21, 1995). In the Hollman decree, the Met\nCouncil agreed to undertake numerous complex responsibilities to help “achieve a\nmetropolitan distribution of affordable housing.” Among these, the Met Council agreed\nto consider low-income housing distribution in its “decisions and recommendations\nregarding the . . . funding, construction, or approval of regional wastewater and\ntransportation facilities.” The parties agreed to submit periodic progress reports to the\ndistrict court, and the district court retained jurisdiction to issue “such further orders\nas may be necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of this Decree.”\n\n        Six months after the district court entered judgment in Hollman, the NAACP\nfiled this lawsuit in state court “on behalf of a plaintiff class consisting of all students\nenrolled . . . in the Minneapolis public schools,” which necessarily includes students\nwho live in low-income housing and belong to the Hollman class. The plaintiffs\n(appellants before this court) claimed that because the Minneapolis public schools have\ndisproportionate enrollments of poor and minority students, generating “negative\neffects” that “depress[] . . . educational achievement,” Minneapolis public school\nstudents as a whole are being denied their right to receive an adequate education in\nviolation of the Education and Equal Protection Clauses of the Minnesota Constitution.\nSee Skeen v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2124044\"><a href=\"/opinion/2124044/skeen-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 313 (Minn. 1993) (recognizing education as a\nfundamental right under the state constitution). The class-action complaint linked\nschool enrollments to housing, alleging the defendants, including the Met Council, had\n“adopted . . . policies and practices that result in housing segregated by race and\nsocioeconomic status in the metropolitan area, . . . result[ing] in segregation . . . in the\nMinneapolis public schools.” The plaintiffs objected to excessive spending on\nsuburban infrastructure and to “transportation policies that . . . enable[] ‘white flight’\nto suburbs,” and faulted the Met Council for failing “to require . . . suburban\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fcommunities . . . to promote the development of low and moderate income housing.”\n In sustaining removal of, and then dismissing, the claims against the Met Council, the\ndistrict court found the claims “focus exclusively on [the Met Council’s] housing\npolicies and practices, the subject of the Hollman lawsuit.”\n\n        We consider first whether the district court properly exercised removal\njurisdiction under the authority granted federal courts by the All Writs Act to “issue all\nwrits necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions and agreeable to\nthe usages and principles of law.” 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). Although the All Writs Act\nis not an independent grant of jurisdiction, see White v. National Football League, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 409 (8th Cir. 1994), the Act empowers a federal court “to issue such\ncommands . . . as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and prevent the\nfrustration of orders it has previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction otherwise\nobtained,” United States v.

There is\nno dispute the district court properly obtained jurisdiction in Hollman. Under the terms\nof the Hollman decree, the district court retains jurisdiction to supervise compliance\nwith the decree’s provisions until the year 2002. The decree sets forth the Met\nCouncil’s agreement with the NAACP and the Hollman class that it will alter its\npolicies and practices with respect to housing, wastewater facilities, and transportation\nin the Twin Cities’ metropolitan area. Further, the Hollman decree includes a general\nrelease barring relitigation by any party of “any matters alleged in this action.”\n\n       In this suit, the NAACP and the student class seek state injunctive relief against\nthe Met Council concerning the very matters the Hollman decree governs. Although\nthis class action is not removable under the federal removal statutes, the district court\nwas confronted with a situation where parties subject to the district court’s continuing\njurisdiction under the Hollman decree--the NAACP and those student class members\nbelonging to the Hollman class--were resorting to a state forum to relitigate settled and\nreleased claims. Faced with this circumstance, we believe the district court was\nwarranted in authorizing removal from state court under the All Writs Act to protect the\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fintegrity of the federal consent decree entered in Hollman, see In re Agent Orange Prod.\nLiab.

Further, if we held these claims unremovable under the\nAll Writs Act, any state-court orders affecting the Met Council inconsistent with the\nHollman decree “would be subject to the injunctive powers of the federal court under\nthe exception provisions of the Anti-Injunction Act.” Yonkers, 858 F.2d at 864. Given\nthe choices available to the district court, we think removal in this case better preserves\nstate-federal relations than would later resort to an injunction because it spares the\nHennepin County District Court from expending judicial resources to no avail. Because\nwe conclude removal was proper under the All Writs Act, we need not determine\nwhether removal was also warranted under the artful pleading doctrine.\n\n      Having decided the district court properly exercised removal jurisdiction over\nclaims asserted against the Met Council, we now turn to the district court’s res judicata\ndismissal of those claims as precluded by Hollman. Our review is de novo, on both\nprocedural and substantive grounds. See Coleman v. Watt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"682482\"><a href=\"/opinion/682482/michael-coleman-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v-william-watt-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 258 (8th Cir.\n1994) (appeal from dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6)); Poe v.

Gurley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1188</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1195 (8th Cir. 1994)\n(quoting Montana v.

Specifically, the earlier\nHollman litigation precludes claims against the Met Council in this lawsuit if (1) the\nearlier suit resulted in a final judgment on the merits, (2) the earlier suit was based on\nproper jurisdiction, (3) both suits involved the same cause of action, and (4) both suits\ninvolved the same parties or their privies. See United States EPA v. City of Green\nForest, Ark., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1394</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1403 (8th Cir. 1990). A consent decree is a final judgment\non the merits, see id., and no one challenges the jurisdiction of the Hollman court.\nConsequently, this appeal turns on whether this suit involves the same cause of action\nagainst the Met Council, and the same parties or their privies, as in Hollman.\n\n       Initially, the NAACP and the student class contend this suit and Hollman involve\ndifferent causes of action because Hollman claimed Fair Housing Act violations while\nthis suit asserts violations of a right to an adequate education under the Minnesota\nConstitution. This argument misses the mark. The same cause of action framed in\nterms of a new legal theory is still the same cause of action. See Gurley, 43 F.3d at\n1195. The claims against the Met Council in this suit involve the same cause of action\nas the claims against the Met Council in Hollman if both sets of claims “‘arise[] out of\nthe same nucleus of operative facts.’” Id. (quoting Lane v. Peterson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538891\"><a href=\"/opinion/538891/clift-c-lane-individually-and-as-trustee-under-the-clift-c-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">899</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742\n(8th Cir. 1990)). “In the final analysis, the test [is] whether the wrong for which redress\nis sought is the same in both actions.” Id. at 1196 (internal quotations omitted;\nemphasis in Gurley). As against the Met Council, this suit seeks what Hollman sought:\nto end the claimed segregative effect of the Met Council’s policies and practices\nconcerning housing and related infrastructure projects in the Twin Cities’ metropolitan\narea. Despite the argument of the NAACP and the student class to the contrary, the fact\ntheir complaint alleges the Met Council failed “to coordinate school\n\n\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fdesegregation/integration efforts with the housing, social, economic, and infrastructure\nneeds of the metropolitan area” does not affect our conclusion that, as far as the claims\nagainst the Met Council are concerned, this suit and Hollman involve the same cause\nof action. The “failure to coordinate” claim pertains to one of the state defendants, the\nOffice of Desegregation/Integration in Minnesota’s Department of Education, because\nthat Office, not the Met Council, shoulders the statutory responsibility for undertaking\ncoordination efforts. See Minn. Stat. Ann. § 121.1601 (West Supp. 1997) (creating\nDesegregation Office and prescribing its duties). Otherwise, neither the plaintiffs’\ncomplaint nor their brief suggests the Met Council bears any responsibility for public\neducation under Minnesota law.\n\n       Finally, we must determine whether this suit and Hollman involve the same\nparties or their privies. The NAACP was a party to Hollman, and it brought this suit on\nbehalf of the student class. As defined in the plaintiffs’ complaint, the student class\nnecessarily includes students who live in low-income housing and belong to the Hollman\nclass. We cannot determine the extent of class overlap, but it may be extensive because\nthe plaintiffs’ complaint states “the Minneapolis public schools have an extraordinary\nproportion of children living in poverty among their student populations,” an assertion\nwe must accept as true. See Coleman, 40 F.3d at 258. Given the two classes overlap\nbut are not identical, the question we must answer is whether the student class in this\ncase is in privity with the Hollman class.\n\n       Because the student class in this suit neither controlled the Hollman action nor\nare successors-in-interest to the Hollman class, the resolution of the privity issue\ndepends on whether the student class was adequately represented in the earlier action\nby the Hollman class. See Tyus v. Schoemehl, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"724926\"><a href=\"/opinion/724926/sharon-tyus-sterling-s-miller-irving-clay-jr-bertha-mitchell-clarence/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 454 (8th Cir. 1996), cert.\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In this circuit, “‘a person may be bound by a judgment\neven though not a party if one of the parties to the suit is so closely aligned with [the\nperson’s] interests as to be [that person’s] virtual representative.’” Id. (quoting Aerojet-\nGeneral Corp. v. Askew, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"325551\"><a href=\"/opinion/325551/aerojet-general-corporation-v-reubin-odonovan-askew-governor-of-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">710</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719 (5th Cir. 1975)). Nonparty preclusion\n\n\n\n                                            -7-\n\fbased on virtual representation involves an equitable, case-by-case inquiry, and there\nis no clear test for courts to apply. See id. at 455. Nevertheless, analyzing a particular\ncase in light of the factors the court identified in Tyus enables us to “ensure that the\nrelationship between the party to the original suit and the party sought to be precluded\nin the later suit is sufficiently close to justify preclusion.” Id. at 454.\n\n       Although not enough by itself, identity of interests between the parties is\nessential. See id. at 455. This requirement is satisfied here. As against the Met\nCouncil, the interests of the Hollman class and the student class are virtually the same.\nThe only difference is the Hollman class sued the Met Council to secure broader\ngeographical distribution of low-income housing as an end in itself, while the student\nclass seeks the same relief against the Met Council as a means to the end of improving\neducation. Furthermore, the Hollman class adequately represented the interests it shares\nwith the student class because the Hollman class had a powerful incentive to establish\nthe segregative effects of the Met Council’s housing policies and practices. See id. at\n455-56. After all, the Hollman class could not prevail in its lawsuit against the Met\nCouncil without successfully litigating the same kind of claims raised against the Met\nCouncil by the student class in this case. Although incentive to litigate, not results, is\nthe key, see id. at 458, the Hollman plaintiffs secured commitments of more than $100\nmillion to promote the spread of low-income housing in the Twin Cities’ metropolitan\narea--which in turn, according to the plaintiffs’ complaint in this suit, will improve\neducational achievement in the Minneapolis schools.\n\n       Because the memberships of the student and Hollman classes overlap, it is clear\nto us the parties in the two suits are not strangers to one another. Indeed, the student\nmembers of the Hollman class actually participated in that litigation. See id. at 455.\nAdding these considerations to the two classes’ closely aligned interests, and the\nHollman class’s incentive to protect those interests in the earlier suit, we are satisfied\nthat the members of the student class were adequately represented by, and thus are in\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fprivity with, the Hollman class. Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed the\nclaims against the Met Council as precluded by Hollman.\n\n      We affirm the judgment of the district court.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f</pre>",
