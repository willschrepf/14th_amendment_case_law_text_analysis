Hancock, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama,\nsitting by designation.\n\f      Plaintiffs appeal the district court’s orders dismissing for lack of standing\n\ntheir race discrimination claims against officials of the University of Georgia\n\nSystem. This litigation actually encompasses two distinct claims. One group of\n\nPlaintiffs -- Tracy, Davis, and Green (collectively, “Tracy Plaintiffs”) -- is\n\ncomposed of unsuccessful applicants to the University of Georgia; they allege that\n\nthe Defendants’ freshman admissions policies impermissibly favor non-whites over\n\nwhites in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and federal civil rights statutes.\n\nA second group of Plaintiffs -- Wooden, Jarvis, and Bratcher (collectively,\n\n“Wooden Plaintiffs”) -- is composed of individuals with ties to three historically\n\nblack institutions (“HBIs”) in Georgia’s university system; they allege that\n\noperation of the HBIs unlawfully discriminates against non-blacks. In a series of\n\norders, the district court dismissed the claims of all of these Plaintiffs for lack of\n\nstanding; the court also denied the Plaintiffs’ class certification motion, based\n\nprimarily on its rulings regarding standing.\n\n      Because the district court correctly determined that Plaintiffs Davis and\n\nTracy lack standing, we affirm that portion of the district court’s orders. In\n\naddition, the Wooden Plaintiffs failed to file their notice of appeal in a timely\n\nfashion, so we lack jurisdiction to consider their challenge to the district court’s\n\norders dismissing their claims. We conclude, however, that the district court erred\n\n                                            2\n\fby finding that Plaintiff Green lacks standing, and by rejecting on that basis\n\nGreen’s request to serve as a class representative. Accordingly, we reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s order entering summary judgment against Green for lack of\n\nstanding, and vacate the denial of class certification to the extent it was based on\n\nthe premise that Green lacks standing. The case is remanded to the district court\n\nfor further proceedings regarding Green’s claim consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                I.\n\n                                               A.\n\n       We begin by laying out the undisputed facts of the case, starting with those\n\nfacts relevant to the Tracy Plaintiffs’ challenge to the freshman admission policies\n\nat the University of Georgia (“UGA”).1\n\n       UGA is the flagship institution of Georgia’s university system. Admission\n\nto UGA is competitive, and applications far exceed the number of available\n\nfreshman seats. To assemble a class, the faculty admission committee, in\n\nconjunction with the admissions office, recommends a freshman admission policy\n\n\n       1\n         The district court in this case has already stated in dicta its view that the UGA\nadmissions policy discriminates unlawfully to the extent it gives certain applicants preferential\ntreatment based on race at some stages of the admissions process. See, e.g., Tracy v. Board of\nRegents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., 59 F. Supp. 2d 1314, 1321 (S.D. Ga. 1999). The district court\nreached the same conclusion in related litigation not before us today. Johnson v. Board of\nRegents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., 106 F. Supp. 2d 1362 (S.D. Ga. 2000) (awarding relief to\nplaintiff-applicants rejected from UGA). We offer no opinion on that issue, as the appeal now\nbefore us concerns only standing.\n\n                                                3\n\feach year. This policy is formally presented to UGA’s president for approval, and\n\nthereafter is implemented by the admissions office.\n\n      Between 1990-1995, UGA’s freshman admissions policy applied objective\n\nacademic criteria differently depending upon whether an applicant characterized\n\nhimself as “black” or “non-black.” To be eligible for admission, an applicant had\n\nto meet certain pre-set minimums with respect to Scholastic Aptitude Test (“SAT”)\n\nscore, grade point average (“GPA”), and academic index (“AI”).2 Under the 1990-\n\n95 policy, the minimums for black students were set lower than the minimums for\n\nnon-black students. Specifically, to be eligible for admission into the Fall 1995\n\nclass, a black applicant would have to obtain at least an 800 SAT score, a 2.0 GPA,\n\nand a 2.0 academic index. By contrast, a non-black applicant would have to obtain\n\nat least a 980 SAT score, a 2.5 GPA, and a 2.4 academic index.\n\n      This was the regime when plaintiff Kirby Tracy (who is white) applied for\n\nadmission to UGA’s Fall 1995 Class. Tracy had a GPA of 3.47 and a total SAT\n\nscore of 830. Because he did not meet the minimum SAT requirement for\n\nnon-blacks, UGA denied his application. It is undisputed, however, that Tracy\n\nwould have been eligible for admission under the criteria applied to black\n\napplicants.\n\n\n      2\n       The AI is a statistic that weighs and combines an applicant’s SAT scores and GPA.\n\n                                             4\n\f       After his rejection from UGA, Tracy enrolled at Georgia College. Two\n\nyears later, in 1997, he applied and won admission to UGA as a transfer student.\n\nThe transfer application was filed shortly after this lawsuit was filed.3 At the time\n\nof summary judgment in this case, Tracy remained a student at UGA.\n\n       Meanwhile, UGA -- concerned about the constitutionality of its dual-track\n\nadmissions policy -- revised that policy in 1995 for the 1996 freshman class. With\n\nsome minor modifications, that revised policy remained in effect at the time of\n\nsummary judgment and appears to remain in effect today. The revised policy\n\ndivides the admissions process into three stages. UGA selects the majority of its\n\nfreshman class at an initial stage which applies objective academic criteria without\n\nregard to the applicant’s race. At this initial stage (the “AI stage”), UGA admits\n\nautomatically applicants whose academic indices and SAT scores are above a\n\ncertain number. From the remaining applications, UGA selects for “further\n\nevaluation” a group of applicants whose academic indices are above a certain\n\nnumber and who meet minimum SAT score requirements. Applicants who fall\n\nbelow the minimum academic index or below the minimum SAT score\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         It is unclear what criteria UGA uses to evaluate transfer applicants, although there is no\ndispute that those criteria are race-neutral.\n\n                                                 5\n\frequirement are automatically rejected. To reiterate, race is not a consideration at\n\nthe AI stage.\n\n       For each applicant placed in the pool for further evaluation, UGA calculates\n\na Total Student Index (“TSI”). The TSI is based on a combination of weighted\n\nacademic and demographic factors. It is only at this stage that UGA, under its\n\ncurrent policy, expressly considers an applicant’s race.4 Applicants whose TSI\n\nscores meet a pre-set threshold are admitted automatically, while applicants whose\n\nscores fall below a pre-set minimum are rejected. Applicants whose TSI scores fall\n\nbetween those numbers are then passed on to a third stage, where they are\n\nevaluated on an individual basis by admissions officers. This is the “edge read” or\n\n“ER” stage. At this final stage, all applicants still in the pool start with a score of\n\nzero, and ER readers look for qualities that might not have been apparent at the AI\n\nand TSI stages. Applicants who receive an ER rating above a certain number are\n\nadmitted, while those below that number are rejected. Race is not designated as a\n\nfactor at the ER stage, although the Plaintiffs contend that race is nevertheless\n\ntaken into account in determining an ER score.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        UGA also considers, among other factors, Georgia residence, alumni relationships,\nextracurricular activities, and after-school work hours.\n\n                                              6\n\f      Two Plaintiffs in this case sought admission under the post-1995 revised\n\npolicy (Tracy, as noted above, sought admission under the superseded 1990-95\n\npolicy). Plaintiff Ashley Davis, who is white, applied for admission to the 1996\n\nFall freshman class at UGA. She had a 980 SAT score, a 2.94 GPA, and a 2.21\n\nacademic index. Because her academic index was below 2.30 (the cut-off to\n\nadvance to the TSI stage), UGA denied her application at the initial AI stage. It\n\ntherefore did not compute a TSI for her, and did not consider race in rejecting her.\n\nDavis eventually enrolled as a freshman at the University of Tennessee, where she\n\nremained at the time of summary judgment. She has disclaimed any interest in\n\ntransferring to UGA, and there is no indication that she would re-apply under the\n\nfreshman admissions policy.\n\n      Plaintiff Craig Green, who is white, unsuccessfully sought admission to the\n\nFall 1997 UGA freshman class. For the 1997 freshman class, UGA required an AI\n\nof 2.50 or above to be admitted at the initial AI stage, while applicants with an AI\n\nbelow 2.25 were rejected at that stage. Students whose AIs were between 2.25 and\n\n2.50 proceeded to the TSI phase of consideration. Green was among that group of\n\napplicants, with an AI of 2.39 and a SAT equivalency score of 1170-90.\n\n      In calculating a TSI score for applicants to the 1997 freshman class, UGA\n\nawarded 0.5 points under the category “Demographic Factors” to applicants who\n\n\n                                          7\n\fself-classified themselves as non-caucasian.5 Applicants who did not do so, such\n\nas Green, did not receive the 0.5 point credit.\n\n       After sorting applicants under the TSI process, UGA offered admission to all\n\ncandidates with a TSI score of 4.40 or higher. Applicants with a TSI score below\n\n3.79 were rejected, while applicants whose TSI scores were between 3.79 and 4.39\n\nproceeded on to the final ER stage. Because of the 0.5 point credit given non-\n\nwhite applicants, however, white applicants were effectively held to a more\n\nrigorous standard. In practice, awarding the 0.5 point credit to non-white\n\napplicants meant that white applicants needed a TSI score of at least 4.40 to be\n\nadmitted at this stage, while non-white applicants needed only a 3.90. Similarly, to\n\navoid outright rejection at the TSI phase and proceed on to the ER phase, a white\n\napplicant effectively needed a TSI score of at least 3.79 TSI points, while a\n\nnon-white applicant -- because of the 0.5 point boost -- needed only 3.29.\n\n       Green received a TSI score of 3.89, which included credits for his parents’\n\neducational level, his Georgia residency, his relatively high GPA/SAT equivalency\n\n\n\n       5\n         In 1996, the year in which Davis sought admission, bonus points were awarded under a\ncategory entitled “Ethnic Diversity.” The number of points awarded depended on the particular\n“ethnic code” (such as “B” for black) specified by the applicant. It appears that black applicants\nwere awarded a larger bonus than Hispanic or other “minority” applicants. That distinction did\nnot exist in 1997, when the awarding of bonus points turned simply on whether the applicant\nidentified himself as “non-caucasian.” As shorthand in this opinion, we shall use “white” and\n“non-white” to refer to “caucasian” and “non-caucasian” when speaking of the 1997 policy.\n\n                                                8\n\fscore, and his male gender. On the basis of that score he was neither admitted nor\n\nrejected at the TSI stage, but instead went into the Edge Read pool. If Green had\n\ndesignated himself as non-white, his TSI score would have been 4.39 -- 0.5 points\n\nhigher than it was, but still just barely below the 4.40 threshold for automatic\n\nadmission. Accordingly, Green would have proceeded to the ER stage regardless\n\nof whether he received a 0.5 point credit due to his race.\n\n      At the ER stage, application files were individually read by at least two\n\nmembers of UGA’s admissions office. UGA then offered admission to all\n\napplicants with an ER score above -0.5, and denied admission to all applicants with\n\nan ER score below -0.5. Each of the two Edge Readers who reviewed Green’s\n\napplication gave him an ER score of -2.0, the lowest possible. Because that score\n\nwas well below the -0.5 cutoff for admission, UGA denied Green’s application.\n\n      Green ultimately attended Dalton College in the Fall of 1997, but in 1998\n\nsought to transfer into UGA. UGA denied his application because he lacked the\n\nnecessary credit hours to transfer to UGA from a junior college. As stated by the\n\ndistrict court, Green intends to reapply for admission to UGA as a transfer student\n\nonce he earns the requisite credit hours.\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f                                               B.\n\n       The claims of the Wooden Plaintiffs relate to an entirely different set of\n\nfacts. These Plaintiffs object to Defendants’ alleged failure to “desegregate”\n\nadequately three HBIs: Ft. Valley State University, Savannah State University,\n\nand Albany State University. Plaintiff Wooden, who is black, asserts that although\n\nhe would have liked to enroll his daughter at nearby Savannah State, he refused to\n\nallow her to attend a segregated campus. Plaintiff Jarvis, who is white, is a former\n\nstudent at Ft. Valley; he alleges that the school’s continued segregation adversely\n\naffected his educational experience and undermines the reputational value of his\n\ndegree. Plaintiff Bratcher, who is white, is on the faculty at Ft. Valley; she\n\ncontends that the school’s hostility to whites adversely affects her work and makes\n\nthe school inferior. None of these Plaintiffs is a current student at an HBI, which\n\nall parties concede remain predominantly black today and Plaintiffs contend are de\n\nfacto bastions of segregation (for example, they observe that there are separate\n\nstudent unions for white and black students).6\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         The only Wooden Plaintiffs before us today are Wooden, Jarvis, and Bratcher. In their\nbrief Plaintiffs discuss a fourth Wooden Plaintiff, Marie McConnell, but McConnell was\nvoluntarily dismissed from the case on October 14, 1998, and is not a party to the appeal.\nPlaintiffs also discuss a fifth Wooden Plaintiff, Ruth Harris, but make no argument about her and\ndo not even mention her, let alone argue on her behalf, in their brief.\n\n                                               10\n\f                                                 C.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed their complaint on March 3, 1997. The complaint originally\n\nnamed eleven individuals as Plaintiffs; all but four of those individuals (and six of\n\nthe seven of the Plaintiffs participating in this appeal) are white. Named as\n\nDefendants were the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia and the\n\nChancellor of the system, Dr. Stephen Portch. Plaintiffs sought damages and\n\ninjunctive relief on race discrimination theories under the Equal Protection Clause\n\n(via 42 U.S.C. § 1983), 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq. The Georgia branch of the NAACP, the Southern\n\nChristian Leadership Conference, and various African-American individuals later\n\nmoved successfully to intervene as Defendants. Green was later added as an\n\nadditional Plaintiff.\n\n       Plaintiffs eventually moved for class certification, seeking certification of an\n\nextremely broad class of persons allegedly affected by Defendants’ discriminatory\n\npractices. Plaintiff Tracy moved separately for partial summary judgment on his\n\nclaim. Defendants moved for summary judgment in their favor on all claims.7\n\n       7\n         Plaintiff Davis also moved for leave to amend her complaint to add allegations of sex\ndiscrimination. The district court denied that motion. Although Plaintiffs state that they seek\nreview of that decision, they do not address the district court’s ruling in their brief, and instead\nsimply argue that Davis has standing. For the same reasons that Davis lacks standing to pursue\nher allegation that the UGA admissions process unlawfully gives preferential treatment to non-\nwhite applicants, she lacks standing to challenge UGA’s allegedly preferential treatment of\n\n                                                 11\n\f       In an order dated January 6, 1996, the district court found that Tracy had\n\nestablished his claim of unlawful past discrimination, and therefore granted his\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment. The court reserved ruling on the\n\nrecoverability of compensatory damages, and also reserved ruling on the\n\navailability of prospective injunctive relief. In addition, the court granted\n\nDefendants’ summary judgment motion with respect to Davis, finding that she\n\nlacked standing to pursue her claim. Wooden v. Board of Regents of the Univ.\n\nSys. of Ga., 32 F. Supp. 2d 1370 (S.D. Ga. 1999). Subsequently, on March 12,\n\n1999, the district court entered summary judgment against the Wooden Plaintiffs\n\non lack of standing grounds. On July 6, 1999, the district court rejected Green’s\n\ncause of action, finding that he, like Davis, lacked standing to pursue his\n\ndiscrimination claims. 59 F. Supp. 2d at 1318-1323. In a separate order entered on\n\nthat date, the court found that Tracy had not established the prerequisites needed to\n\nobtain prospective injunctive relief, and also that Tracy was only entitled to\n\nrecover nominal damages.8 The court denied as well Plaintiffs’ motion for class\n\ncertification.\n\n\n\nmales at the TSI stage.\n       8\n          No party has appealed the district court’s finding of liability on Tracy’s claim or the\ndistrict court’s decision to award only nominal damages on that claim. Accordingly, we shall\nnot review those rulings.\n\n                                                 12\n\f      All of those rulings were appealed to this Court. While the appeal was\n\npending, the Supreme Court decided a relevant case, Texas v. Lesage, 528 U.S. 18,\n\n120 S. Ct. 467 (1999). In pertinent part, the Supreme Court explained that:\n\n      [W]here a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision as\n      being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the\n      government would have made the same decision regardless, there is\n      no cognizable injury warranting relief under § 1983.\n\n             Of course, a plaintiff who challenges an ongoing race-conscious\n      program and seeks forward-looking relief need not affirmatively\n      establish that he would receive the benefit in question if race were not\n      considered. The relevant injury in such cases is “the inability to\n      compete on an equal footing.” Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated\n      Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666, 113\n      S. Ct. 2297 [] (1993). See also Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pea, 515\n      U.S. 200, 211, 115 S. Ct. 2097 [] (1995). But where there is no\n      allegation of an ongoing or imminent constitutional violation to\n      support a claim for forward-looking relief, the government's\n      conclusive demonstration that it would have made the same decision\n      absent the alleged discrimination precludes any finding of liability.\n\n528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468-69. Sua sponte, this Court on April 14, 2000,\n\nissued a decision vacating the district court’s orders. As we explained:\n\n             Appellants brought related challenges to the University of\n      Georgia’s use of race in its admissions process and to the maintenance\n      of historically black colleges within the state’s university system. The\n      district court granted summary judgment to appellees on all but one\n      claim on standing and mootness grounds. After the appeal was filed\n      in this case, the Supreme Court in the case of Texas v. Lesage, 528\n      U.S. 18, 120 S. Ct. 467 [] (1999), clarified the standing requirements\n      for plaintiffs challenging race-based admissions policies. It is\n      therefore ORDERED that the judgment of the district court is\n\n\n                                         13\n\f      VACATED and the case is REMANDED to that court for further\n      consideration in light of Lesage.\n\nTracy v. Board of Regents of the Univ. Sys., 208 F.3d 1313, 1313-14 (11th Cir.\n\n2000) (per curiam).\n\n      On remand, the district court expressly considered Lesage, but eventually\n\nreinstated all of its prior rulings. The district court subsequently denied the Tracy\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, largely repeating the analysis set out at\n\nlength in its several prior opinions.\n\n      The relevant portions of the district court’s rulings may be summarized as\n\nfollows. With respect to Tracy’s request for prospective injunctive relief, the\n\ndistrict court initially concluded that this request was moot because Tracy\n\ntransferred to UGA in 1997 and therefore had no reason to pursue an order\n\ncompelling his admission to UGA. Subsequently, after this Court’s remand, the\n\ndistrict court explained that its earlier mootness analysis was incorrect.\n\nNevertheless, the court reinstated its prior decision on the ground that Tracy lacked\n\nstanding to obtain any form of prospective relief regarding UGA’s freshman\n\nadmissions policy, given that Tracy would never again be subject to that policy and\n\naccordingly could not establish the prospect of imminent harm necessary for him to\n\nhave standing to seek a prospective injunction.\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f         With respect to Davis, the district court found that she did not suffer any\n\ninjury-in-fact. It reasoned that because she was denied admission outright at the AI\n\nstage, without ever proceeding to the TSI stage, she could not establish that race\n\nwas a factor in the denial of her application, and specifically could not establish\n\nthat UGA’s discriminatory practices made her unable to compete on an equal\n\nfooting with similarly-situated non-white applicants.\n\n         With respect to Green, the court found that he lacked standing to sue on an\n\n“equal footing” theory because even though he went through the race-conscious\n\nTSI phase of UGA’s admissions process, he would have been rejected regardless\n\nof whether UGA had given him racial bonus points. In the words of the district\n\ncourt:\n\n                [T]he parties focus on whether Green suffered an\n         “injury-in-fact.” While they agree that UGA took the ethnic/racial\n         status of applicants into account through its TSI computation, they\n         disagree on whether that amounted to a constitutionally sufficient\n         injury in Green’s case. Defendants insist that, because Green’s race\n         was not a factor in the ultimate decision to deny his application, he\n         lacks standing to challenge UGA’s admission policy. Even if Green\n         had received the .5 bonus for “non-white” ethnic status at the TSI\n         stage, they point out, his application still would have been relegated to\n         the final (ER) admissions stage.\n\n                 [A]lthough UGA may have affirmatively considered his race at\n         some point in the admissions process, the unrebutted evidence shows\n         that its final decision to reject his application was not based on race.\n         Nor did Green reach the final stage (i.e., had his file “edge read”)\n         because of his race. . . .\n\n                                            15\n\f              Green argues that he nevertheless has standing because UGA’s\n      admissions process (as opposed to its denial of admission) inflicted a\n      constitutional injury upon him. Just having his application threaded\n      through a process which employed race-counting (at the TSI stage), he\n      contends, is enough. . . . [The] cases require Green to show that the\n      system prevented him from competing on an equal footing. Green\n      fails in this regard because he has not shown that he was otherwise\n      qualified and then had his “bid” for admission subjected to a “tainted”\n      admissions process. . . . [He] cannot say that he was prevented,\n      because of his race, from competing “on an equal footing” with\n      non-whites. Accordingly, Green has not suffered an “injury-in-fact”\n      sufficient to have standing to challenge UGA’s admission policy on\n      equal protection grounds.\n\n59 F. Supp. 2d at 1318-21 (citations omitted).\n\n      With respect to the Wooden Plaintiffs, the court found that their alleged\n\ngrievances were too attenuated to constitute the “injury-in-fact” necessary to have\n\nstanding. Finally, on the issue of class certification, the district court ruled that\n\nTracy -- the only Plaintiff found to have standing in the case -- was not an adequate\n\nclass representative because his individual request for prospective injunctive relief\n\nregarding the freshman admissions policy had become moot. The court also\n\nconcluded that the need for individualized analysis of class members’ claims made\n\nclass treatment inappropriate. The court did not separately consider the ability of\n\nGreen or any other Plaintiff to serve as a class representative, apparently because\n\nthe court had previously decided that those Plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue\n\nclaims on their own behalf.\n\n\n                                           16\n\f                                               II.\n\n       There can be no dispute about the proper standard of review of the district\n\ncourt’s orders granting Defendants’ motions for summary judgment and denying\n\nclass certification. We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, applying the same legal standards used by the district court. See, e.g.,\n\nHilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. America, Inc., 181 F.3d 1220, 1225 (11th Cir. 1999).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate where “there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We “view the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom\n\nin the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion” and “‘all reasonable\n\ndoubts about the facts [are] resolved in favor of the non-movant.’” See Burton v.\n\nCity of Belle Glade, 178 F.3d 1175, 1187 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting Clemons v.\n\nDougherty County, 684 F.2d 1365, 1368-69 (11th Cir. 1982) (citations omitted)).9\n\n       9\n         Even outside of summary judgment, questions of standing are reviewed de novo. See\nGeorgia State Conf. of NAACP Branches v. Cox, 183 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir. 1999).\nDefendants are plainly incorrect in their suggestion that “the predominant standard of review for\nthis Article III ‘standing’ case is the ‘clearly erroneous’ standard of [Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)].”\nWhile it certainly is true that this Court generally reviews a district court’s underlying factual\nfindings only for clear error, a district court’s ultimate resolution of a legal question such as\nstanding is always reviewed de novo. See, e.g., id.; Bischoff v. Osceola County, 222 F.3d 874,\n879 (11th Cir. 2000). More to the point, a district court does not make factual findings in\ndeciding a summary judgment motion, so no question of clear error review even arises here. See\nRosen v. Benzer, 996 F.2d 1527, 1530 n.2 (3d Cir. 1993) (“because summary judgment may\nonly be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact, any purported ‘factual findings’\nof the [trial] court cannot be ‘factual findings’ as to disputed issues of fact, but rather are\nconclusions as a matter of law that no genuine issue of material fact exists”).\n\n                                                17\n\fWe review orders denying class certification for abuse of discretion. See, e.g.,\n\nPrado-Steiman v. Bush, 221 F.3d 1266, 1278 (11th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                         III.\n\n      We first address our jurisdiction over this appeal. Although Defendants\n\nstate that they “believe” jurisdiction exists, they nevertheless suggest that some or\n\nall of the Plaintiffs may have filed untimely notices of appeal. We must consider\n\nour jurisdiction regardless of whether any objection is raised by the parties. See,\n\ne.g., Rembert v. Apfel, 213 F.3d 1331, 1333-34 (11th Cir. 2000) (“As a federal\n\ncourt of limited jurisdiction, we must inquire into our subject matter jurisdiction\n\nsua sponte even if the parties have not challenged it.”); University of S. Ala. v.\n\nAmerican Tobacco Co., 168 F.3d 405, 410 (11th Cir. 1999) (jurisdiction “cannot\n\nbe waived or otherwise conferred upon the court by the parties”). Upon doing so\n\nin this case, we conclude that although we have jurisdiction over the appeal of the\n\nTracy Plaintiffs, we lack jurisdiction with respect to the Wooden Plaintiffs.\n\n      The district court, as noted above, entered its order on remand on June 16,\n\n2000. That order reinstated the district court’s prior, vacated decisions and again\n\ngranted summary judgment to the Defendants on the claims now at issue. On June\n\n30, 2000, the Tracy Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration; the Wooden Plaintiffs,\n\nnotably, did not so move and did not join in the Tracy Plaintiffs’ motion. The\n\n\n                                          18\n\fdistrict court denied the reconsideration motion on July 24, 2000, and a notice of\n\nappeal on behalf of both sets of Plaintiffs was filed on August 17, 2000 -- less than\n\n30 days after the denial of reconsideration, but over two months after the June 16\n\norder entering summary judgment.\n\n      For a notice of appeal to be timely in a civil case where the United States is\n\nnot a party, it must be filed within 30 days of the judgment or order appealed from.\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1). Absent the filing of a timely notice, this Court does not\n\nhave jurisdiction over the appeal. See, e.g., Burnam v. Amoco Container Co., 738\n\nF.2d 1230, 1231 (11th Cir. 1984). Rule 4(a)(4), however, provides that the time\n\nfor filing a notice of appeal is tolled by the filing with the district court of a timely\n\nmotion to alter or amend judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59. See, e.g., Great\n\nAmerican Ins. Co. v. Rush, 670 F.2d 995, 996 (11th Cir. 1982). Consequently, a\n\nnotice of appeal filed within 30 days of the disposition of the Rule 59 motion is\n\ntimely. See id.\n\n      Defendants suggest, but do not argue affirmatively, that the Tracy Plaintiffs’\n\nreconsideration motion did not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal because\n\nit never referred specifically to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59. We have explained, however,\n\nthat “[w]hether a motion for post-judgment relief can be categorized as a motion\n\nunder Rule 59 is not determined by whether the movant so labels it. Rather, the\n\n\n                                            19\n\fcourt must determine independently what type of motion was before the district\n\ncourt, depending upon the type of relief requested.” Wright v. Preferred Research,\n\nInc., 891 F.2d 886, 888 (11th Cir. 1990). Moreover, “Rule 59 applies to motions\n\nfor reconsideration of matters encompassed in a decision on the merits of a\n\ndispute.” Id. The Tracy Plaintiffs’ motion directly challenged the district court’s\n\nJune 16 order and fits within any fair conception of a reconsideration motion.\n\nAccordingly, the Tracy Plaintiffs’ notice of appeal was timely because it was filed\n\nwithin 30 days of the denial of their motion for reconsideration.\n\n       The Wooden Plaintiffs are in a different posture. They did not join in the\n\nreconsideration motion, and thus were required to -- but did not -- file a notice of\n\nappeal with respect to the dismissal of their claims within 30 days of the June 16\n\norder. Both the docket sheet and the pleadings themselves indicate that only the\n\nTracy Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration. The first line of the motion reads:\n\n       COMES NOW the Plaintiffs ASHLEY DAVIS (Davis), KIRBY\n       TRACY (Tracy) and CRAIG GREEN (Green) [collectively the UGA\n       Plaintiffs] and respectfully request that the Court reconsider its June\n       16, 2000 Order . . .\n\nIn a footnote, the Tracy Plaintiffs explained that the Wooden Plaintiffs had no part\n\nin the motion for reconsideration.10 The footnote reads:\n\n       10\n         Moreover, the memorandum in support of the motion for reconsideration focuses only\non the claims of the Tracy Plaintiffs. It discusses in detail the need for reconsideration with\nrespect to Tracy, Davis, and Green, but makes no mention of the other Plaintiffs. The district\n\n                                               20\n\f       The remaining Wooden plaintiffs who challenge defendants’\n       continued maintenance of racially segregated “historically black”\n       universities will file a separate motion and brief seeking consideration\n       of their standing, and take no part in this motion.\n\nA review of the docket sheet and the record reveals that the Wooden Plaintiffs\n\nnever filed any motion or brief seeking reconsideration of the June 16 order.\n\n       Plaintiffs do not suggest, nor could they, that the Tracy Plaintiffs’ motion by\n\ndefinition encompassed the Wooden Plaintiffs. Not only did the motion state\n\nspecifically that the Wooden Plaintiffs would be moving separately, the claims of\n\nthe two groups of Plaintiffs were litigated on an individual basis and are\n\nanalytically distinct.11 At least in this context, the filing of a joint notice of appeal\n\nfrom a final order resolving a group of individual claims does not relieve each\n\nplaintiff of his obligation to file a timely notice of appeal with respect to his own\n\nparticular claim; the fact that the notice may be timely for some other plaintiff is\n\nimmaterial. See United States v. One Remington 12 Gauge Shotgun, 709 F.2d\n\n1468, 1469 (11th Cir. 1983) (dismissing appeal where party failed to file timely\n\nnotice because “[t]he filing of a timely notice of appeal is essential to give this\n\n\n\ncourt’s order denying reconsideration likewise contains no discussion of the Wooden Plaintiffs’\nstanding.\n       11\n       As explained above, the Tracy Plaintiffs challenge the freshman admissions policies at\nUGA. The Wooden Plaintiffs do not challenge those policies, but rather challenge the\nDefendants’ alleged perpetuation of the “segregated” HBIs.\n\n                                               21\n\fcourt jurisdiction”); Reynolds v. Hunt Oil Co., 643 F.2d 1042, 1042 (5th Cir. Unit\n\nB 1981) (dismissing appeal and observing that “[c]ompliance with [the 30-day]\n\nrequirement is a prerequisite for appellate jurisdiction”). Inadvertent or not, the\n\nWooden Plaintiffs did not move for reconsideration, and therefore were not\n\nentitled to an automatic extension of the otherwise applicable 30-day deadline for\n\nfiling a notice of appeal regarding the dismissal of their claims. The appeals of\n\nWooden, Jarvis, and Bratcher must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and\n\naccordingly we do not consider their arguments on the merits.\n\n                                         IV.\n\n      The appeals of the Tracy Plaintiffs arise out of the district court’s rulings\n\ndismissing their claims for lack of standing. Article III of the United States\n\nConstitution restricts the power of federal courts to adjudicating actual “cases” and\n\n“controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. “This case-or-controversy doctrine\n\nfundamentally limits the power of federal courts in our system of government, and\n\nhelps to identify those disputes which are appropriately resolved through judicial\n\nprocess.” Cox, 183 F.3d at 1262 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Allen\n\nv. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S. Ct. 3315, 3324 (1984), and Whitmore v.\n\nArkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155, 110 S. Ct. 1717, 1722 (1990)).\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f       Perhaps the most important of the Article III doctrines grounded in the\n\ncase-or-controversy requirement is that of standing. See Allen, 468 U.S. at 750,\n\n104 S. Ct. at 3324. “In essence the question of standing is whether the litigant is\n\nentitled to have the court decide the merits of the dispute or of particular issues.”\n\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498, 95 S. Ct. 2197, 2205 (1975). A plaintiff\n\nseeking to invoke a federal court’s jurisdiction must demonstrate three things to\n\nestablish standing under Article III.12 First, he must show that he has suffered an\n\n“injury-in-fact.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S. Ct.\n\n2130, 2136 (1992); Cox, 183 F.3d at 1262. Specifically, the asserted injury must\n\narise out of the invasion of a legally protected interest that is sufficiently concrete\n\nand particularized rather than abstract and indefinite. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560,\n\n112 S. Ct. at 2136; see also FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 22-24, 118 S. Ct. 1777,\n\n1785-86 (1998). Second, the plaintiff must show a causal connection between the\n\nasserted injury-in-fact and the challenged action of the defendant. Lujan, 504 U.S.\n\nat 560, 112 S. Ct. at 2136; Allen, 468 U.S. at 751, 104 S. Ct. at 3324. That causal\n\nconnection cannot be too attenuated. See id. Third, the plaintiff must show that it\n\nis likely rather than speculative that “the injury will be redressed by a favorable\n\n       12\n          In this case we discuss the elements of so-called “constitutional” standing. Even where\nconstitutional standing exists, prudential considerations may themselves preclude standing. See,\ne.g., Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Atlanta Area, Inc. v. Miller, 934 F.2d 1462, 1465 n.2 (11th\nCir. 1991).\n\n                                               23\n\fdecision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561, 112 S. Ct. at 2136 (citations and internal\n\nquotations omitted). See also Miccosukee Tribe of Indians v. Florida State\n\nAthletic Comm’n, 226 F.3d 1226, 1228 (11th Cir. 2000) (setting forth the three-\n\npart test for constitutional standing).\n\n      These three elements are the “‘irreducible minimum’ required by the\n\nConstitution” for a plaintiff to proceed in federal court. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at\n\n664, 113 S. Ct. at 2302 (quoting Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans\n\nUnited for Separation of Church and State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S. Ct. 752,\n\n758 (1982)). “In determining whether a plaintiff has established standing, we keep\n\nin mind the Art[icle] III notion that federal courts may exercise power only in the\n\nlast resort, and as a necessity, and when the dispute is one traditionally thought to\n\nbe capable of resolution through the judicial process.” Cox, 183 F.3d at 1262-63\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Allen, 468 U.S. at 752, 104 S. Ct. at\n\n3325).\n\n                                          A.\n\n      The Tracy Plaintiffs’ arguments for standing draw heavily on the Supreme\n\nCourt’s recent opinion in Lesage. To understand Lesage, however, it is essential to\n\nexamine earlier Supreme Court decisions discussing standing in connection with a\n\nparty’s challenge to a competitive state-sponsored selection process that allegedly\n\n\n                                          24\n\fdiscriminates based on race. The Court in Lesage relied upon those decisions, and\n\nwe think it is those decisions -- rather than merely Lesage -- that ultimately answer\n\nthe questions now before us.\n\n      The first of those decisions is Northeastern Florida Chapter, Associated\n\nGeneral Contractors of America v. City of Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 113 S. Ct.\n\n2297 (1993). That case involved a challenge to a municipal ordinance which\n\neffectively set aside a portion of all city contracts for bidding only by minority-\n\nowned firms. The plaintiff was an association which included many non-minority\n\nfirms that bid regularly on city contracts, but were barred from bidding on the\n\nset-aside contracts. The city argued that the plaintiff lacked standing because it\n\nfailed to show that any of its members would have bid successfully on any of the\n\ncontracts as to which they were precluded from bidding. The Supreme Court\n\nrejected that argument, emphasizing that it was immaterial for standing purposes\n\nwhether any of the non-minority firms would have obtained the contracts were it\n\nnot for the city’s discrimination:\n\n      When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for\n      members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of\n      another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge the\n      barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for\n      the barrier in order to establish standing. The “injury in fact” in an\n      equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment\n      resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability\n      to obtain the benefit. See, e.g., Turner v. Fouche, [396 U.S. 346, 362,\n\n                                          25\n\f      90 S. Ct. 532, 541 (1970)] (“We may assume that the [plaintiffs] have\n      no right to be appointed to the . . . board of education. But [they] do\n      have a federal constitutional right to be considered for public service\n      without the burden of invidiously discriminatory disqualifications”)\n      (footnote omitted) (emphasis added). And in the context of a\n      challenge to a set-aside program, the “injury in fact” is the inability to\n      compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of a\n      contract. . . . To establish standing, therefore, a party challenging a\n      set-aside program like Jacksonville’s need only demonstrate that it is\n      able and ready to bid on contracts and that a discriminatory policy\n      prevents it from doing so on an equal basis.\n\n508 U.S. at 666, 113 S. Ct. at 2303. Having defined the relevant “injury-in-fact” as\n\n“the inability to compete on an equal footing,” the Court explained that it “follows\n\nfrom our definition . . . that petitioner has sufficiently alleged both that the city’s\n\nordinance is the ‘cause’ of its injury and that a judicial decree directing the city to\n\ndiscontinue its program would ‘redress’ the injury.” Id. at 666 n.5, 113 S. Ct. at\n\n2303 n.5.\n\n      In support of its holding in Jacksonville, the Supreme Court cited its\n\n“analogous” earlier decision in Regents of University of California v. Bakke, 438\n\nU.S. 265, 98 S. Ct. 2733 (1978). In Bakke, an unsuccessful white applicant to a\n\nstate medical school claimed that the school’s admissions program, which reserved\n\n16 of 100 places in the entering class for minority applicants, was inconsistent with\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause. Addressing the argument that the applicant lacked\n\nstanding to challenge the admissions program, Justice Powell (in a portion of his\n\n                                           26\n\fopinion joined by a majority of the Court) concluded that the “constitutional\n\nrequirements of Art[icle] III” had been satisfied because the requisite “injury” was\n\nthe school’s “decision not to permit Bakke to compete for all 100 places in the\n\nclass, simply because of his race.” Id. at 281 n.14, 98 S. Ct. at 2743 n.14. Thus,\n\n“even if Bakke had been unable to prove that he would have been admitted in the\n\nabsence of the special program, it would not follow that he lacked standing.” Id.\n\n      Subsequent to Jacksonville, the Court decided Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\n\nPea, 515 U.S. 200, 115 S. Ct. 2097 (1995). Adarand, like Jacksonville, arose out\n\nof a contract bidding process. The plaintiff, a non-minority subcontracting firm,\n\nwas the low bidder for a subcontracting job on a federal highway project. The job\n\nwas awarded to a minority-owned firm, however, because a federal law effectively\n\nawarded financial incentives to general contractors hiring minority subcontractors.\n\nThe defendant argued that the plaintiff lacked standing to seek prospective\n\ninjunctive relief. The Court rejected that argument, and in so doing, also rejected\n\nthe notion that the plaintiff was required to show it was likely to be the low bidder\n\non future government contracts and hence likely to be awarded future contracts\n\nabsent the discriminatory incentive system:\n\n      Adarand’s claim that the Government’s use of subcontractor\n      compensation clauses denies it equal protection of the laws of course\n      alleges an invasion of a legally protected interest, and it does so in a\n\n                                          27\n\f      manner that is “particularized” as to Adarand. We note that, contrary\n      to respondents’ suggestion, [] Adarand need not demonstrate that it\n      has been, or will be, the low bidder on a Government contract. The\n      injury in cases of this kind is that a “discriminatory classification\n      prevent[s] the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing.” The\n      aggrieved party “need not allege that he would have obtained the\n      benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.”\n\n515 U.S. at 210, 115 S. Ct. at 2104-05 (quoting Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 667, 113\n\nS. Ct. at 2304).\n\n      Adarand plainly reinforced the principle adopted in Jacksonville and Bakke:\n\nwhen a plaintiff competing for a government-sponsored benefit has been treated\n\ndifferently because of race, he has standing to challenge that differential treatment\n\nbecause his application has not been considered “on an equal footing” with\n\napplications from members of the favored racial group. This Court, in standing-\n\nrelated opinions subsequent to Jacksonville and Adarand, has likewise focused on\n\nthe injury caused by direct exposure to unequal treatment, without regard to\n\nwhether the plaintiff ultimately may obtain the sought-after benefit. In Cone Corp.\n\nv. Hillsborough County, 5 F.3d 1397 (11th Cir. 1993) (per curiam), for example,\n\nwe explained that when an affirmative action plan subjects the plaintiff to\n\n“competition on an uneven playing field, . . . [s]uch unequal competition . . . can\n\ncause harm whether or not those forced to compete on less advantageous terms\n\ngain the benefit sought.” Id. at 1398 (citing Jacksonville). Similarly, in\n\n                                          28\n\fEngineering Contractors Association of South Florida, Inc. v. Metropolitan Dade\n\nCounty, 122 F.3d 895 (11th Cir. 1994), we reasoned that where bidders for county\n\nconstruction contracts “do not compete on an equal basis,” that alone gives them\n\nstanding to challenge the provisions causing the unequal treatment. Id. at 906\n\n(citing Jacksonville).\n\n         We come, then, to the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Lesage. In that\n\ncase, a white plaintiff named Lesage brought an action under § 1983 for money\n\ndamages and prospective injunctive relief after unsuccessfully applying to a Ph.D.\n\nprogram at the University of Texas. The university admitted that race was a factor\n\nat some stages of the admissions process (although the record did not establish\n\nwhether Lesage’s application ever reached one of those stages). The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment to the university, on the ground that Lesage would\n\nhave been denied admission even if race had not been a factor in the admissions\n\nprocess. Reversing the district court, the Fifth Circuit held that Lesage’s chances\n\nunder a color-blind admissions scheme were irrelevant because, if Lesage could\n\nprove that his application was treated differently because of race, then he would be\n\nentitled to prevail on the merits under the logic of the “equal footing” standing\n\ncases.\n\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\f      The Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit, holding that “[i]nsofar as the\n\nCourt of Appeals held that summary judgment was inappropriate on Lesage’s §\n\n1983 action seeking damages for the school’s rejection of his application . . . even\n\nif petitioners conclusively established that Lesage would have been rejected under\n\na race-neutral policy, its decision is inconsistent with this Court’s well-established\n\nframework for analyzing such claims.” 528 U.S. at 20, 120 S. Ct. at 467. The crux\n\nof the Court’s concern was the Fifth Circuit’s failure to take sufficient account of\n\nthe merits defense created by Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429\n\nU.S. 274, 97 S. Ct. 568 (1977), and its progeny. Under Mt. Healthy, explained the\n\nCourt, “even if the government has considered an impermissible criterion in\n\nmaking a decision adverse to the plaintiff, it can nonetheless defeat liability by\n\ndemonstrating that it would have made the same decision absent the forbidden\n\nconsideration. . . . Simply put, where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental\n\ndecision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the\n\ngovernment would have made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable\n\ninjury warranting relief under § 1983.” Lesage, 528 U.S. at 20-21, 120 S. Ct. at\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f468 (citing Mt Healthy).13 The Court found that, on remand, the university should\n\nbe permitted to seek summary judgment on this basis.\n\n       The Court went on, however, to distinguish between the requisite injury for\n\nseeking damages and that necessary to seek prospective injunctive relief. In the\n\ncourse of that discussion, the Court referred to its earlier standing-related decisions\n\ndefining the relevant injury in cases challenging an affirmative action policy:\n\n       Of course, a plaintiff who challenges an ongoing race-conscious\n       program and seeks forward-looking relief need not affirmatively\n       establish that he would receive the benefit in question if race were not\n       considered. The relevant injury in such cases is “the inability to\n       compete on an equal footing.” Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated\n       Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 666, 113\n       S. Ct. 2297, 124 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1993). See also Adarand\n       Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 211, 115 S. Ct. 2097, 132 L.\n       Ed. 2d 158 (1995). But where there is no allegation of an ongoing or\n       imminent constitutional violation to support a claim for\n       forward-looking relief, the government’s conclusive demonstration\n       that it would have made the same decision absent the alleged\n       discrimination precludes any finding of liability.\n\n       13\n          In Mt. Healthy, the Court held that a school board which fired a teacher for engaging in\nprotected expression, among other reasons, could escape liability under § 1983 by showing that\nit would have fired the teacher anyway without regard to the protected expression. See 429 U.S.\nat 287, 97 S. Ct. at 576. Thus, “[w]here a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental decision\nas being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the government would\nhave made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable injury warranting relief under §\n1983.” Lesage, 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468. In Lesage, the Court held that the Mt. Healthy\ndefense applies in Equal Protection race discrimination cases under § 1983 as well as First\nAmendment cases. Id. (“Our previous decisions on this point have typically involved alleged\nretaliation for protected First Amendment activity rather than racial discrimination, but that\ndistinction is immaterial. The underlying principle is the same: The government can avoid\nliability by proving that it would have made the same decision without the impermissible\nmotive.”).\n\n                                                31\n\fLesage, 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468-69. The court went on to remand\n\nLesage’s claim for prospective injunctive relief, because it could not determine\n\nwhether that claim had been abandoned.\n\n       As Defendants observe, Lesage does not specifically address standing\n\n(indeed, the opinion does not refer to standing at all). Nevertheless, we agree with\n\nour decision vacating the district court’s original judgment, in which we described\n\nLesage as “clarif[ying] the standing requirements for plaintiffs challenging\n\nrace-based admissions policies.” 208 F.3d at 1313-14. Whether or not the opinion\n\nexpressly discusses standing, it plainly bears on that inquiry because it further\n\ndefines the kind of injury that would support relief in a case challenging the\n\nprocess of awarding benefits under a government affirmative action plan. “Injury-\n\nin-fact” is the touchstone of standing, see, e.g., Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S. Ct.\n\nat 2136, and it is to Supreme Court decisions such as Lesage that we must look in\n\ndefining the relevant injury in these types of cases.14\n\n       The difficulty, of course, is determining the scope of the Court’s statement --\n\nfirst made in Jacksonville, reiterated in Adarand, and repeated most recently in\n\n\n       14\n          Lesage is also notable because it applies in a university admissions case the “equal\nfooting” principle developed primarily in government contract cases. In both types of cases, the\nplaintiff is competing against others for a benefit conferred on some, but not all, by the state.\nAfter Lesage, Jacksonville and Adarand are not distinguishable simply because they involve the\nprocess of awarding government contracts.\n\n                                               32\n\fLesage -- that “[t]he relevant injury . . . is ‘the inability to compete on an equal\n\nfooting.’” Lesage, 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468-69 (quoting Jacksonville). In\n\nthe context of this case, and holding aside the additional considerations raised by a\n\nclaim for prospective injunctive relief, see infra Part IV.D, there are at least three\n\npossible interpretations. As the Tracy Plaintiffs see it, it is enough to allege that at\n\nsome stage in the UGA freshman admissions process a white applicant will be\n\ndisadvantaged because of race. In other words, viewing the admissions process as\n\na whole, white applicants do not compete on an equal footing with non-white\n\napplicants, and that fact alone creates an injury sufficient to confer standing on all\n\nunsuccessful white applicants. It follows, Plaintiffs say, that mere participation in\n\nthe race-conscious admissions process is enough to establish injury, regardless of\n\nwhether the applicant would have been knocked out under race-neutral criteria\n\nbefore or after the particular stage of the admissions process where race was\n\nconsidered.\n\n      Defendants, unsurprisingly, take a different view. As they see it, for a white\n\napplicant to claim that he has been denied an opportunity to compete on an equal\n\nfooting with non-white applicants, he necessarily must show that he is, in fact, able\n\nto compete equally. The upshot of this position is that regardless of whether a\n\ncandidate’s application was treated less favorably because of his race, if the\n\n                                           33\n\fcandidate is unable to show that the fate of his application was altered due to race,\n\nthen he would not be able to show that he was in a position to compete equally and\n\ntherefore would lack standing. Consequently, not only is mere participation in a\n\nrace-conscious admissions program insufficient to confer standing, actual\n\ndissimilar treatment of an application at some stage of the process is not enough\n\nunless the candidate could show that he was knocked out because of race.\n\n      A third view would strike a middle ground between the conflicting positions\n\nof the parties. According to that view, the critical inquiry for standing purposes\n\nwould be whether the plaintiff’s application has actually been treated differently at\n\nsome stage in the admissions process on the basis on race. If so, then the plaintiff\n\nhas not competed on an equal footing with other applicants outside his racial\n\nclassification, and standing should be conferred regardless of whether race is\n\nultimately a factor in the decision to reject the application. Conversely, if the\n\nplaintiff’s application is never actually treated differently because of race, then the\n\nfact that race may be a consideration in assessing other applicants at a different\n\nstage of the process should not by itself confer standing. As discussed below, it is\n\nthis approach which we find most consonant with binding Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.\n\n                                          B.\n\n                                          34\n\f       We think Green’s standing presents the most difficult question in the appeal.\n\nIt is undisputed that UGA’s post-1995 freshman admissions policy made race a\n\nfactor in evaluating applicants. It is also established, on this record, that race was a\n\nfactor only at the TSI stage, and was not an express consideration at the initial AI\n\nstage or the final ER stage.15 Drawing on that distinction, Defendants insist that\n\nGreen was not injured by UGA’s consideration of race as a factor under the 1997\n\nversion of the admissions policy because (1) his application would have proceeded\n\nto the ER stage regardless of whether he received the 0.5 point bonus given to\n\nsimilarly-situated non-white applicants (i.e., he would not have been admitted\n\nautomatically at the TSI stage even if he received the bonus); (2) scores from the\n\nTSI stage did not carry over to the ER stage; and (3) race was not a factor at the ER\n\nstage (the stage at which he was denied admission). Plaintiffs respond that Green’s\n\nclaim fits squarely under Jacksonville: at the TSI stage he was plainly not “on an\n\nequal footing” with non-white applicants because those applicants received a bonus\n\nthat he did not. Defendants counter that even so, Green was not tangibly injured\n\n\n\n       15\n         Green contends that race is indeed a factor, although an unstated one, at the subjective\nER stage. The district court rejected Green’s argument in denying his motion for\nreconsideration. According to Defendants, there is no evidence in the record that race was a\npermissible factor, or was in practice a factor, in the ER process during the year that Green’s\napplication was considered. Because we find that Green has standing regardless of whether race\nwas considered in the examination of his application during the ER stage, we do not resolve that\ndebate, and leave the issue for further development (if appropriate) on remand.\n\n                                               35\n\fby any “unequal” treatment because he was rejected at a stage of the process which\n\ndid not consider race.\n\n      We think Defendants take too narrow a view of the significance of UGA’s\n\ndecision to consider race at the TSI stage. As set forth above, the Supreme Court\n\nhas explained repeatedly that “[t]he ‘injury in fact’ in an equal protection case of\n\nthis variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the\n\nbarrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.” Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at\n\n666, 113 S. Ct. at 2303. The Court’s decisions establish that when an applicant\n\ncompeting for a government benefit has been exposed to unequal treatment, it is\n\nthe exposure to unequal treatment which constitutes the injury-in-fact giving rise to\n\nstanding. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211, 115 S. Ct. at 2104-05 (“The injury in\n\ncases of this kind is that a ‘discriminatory classification prevent[s] the plaintiff\n\nfrom competing on an equal footing.’”) (quoting Jacksonville). In this case, the\n\nundisputed record shows that Green’s application was denied equal treatment at the\n\nTSI stage -- he did not receive the 0.5 bonus awarded to non-white candidates. He\n\ntherefore was not allowed to compete on an equal footing with non-white\n\ncandidates at the TSI stage.\n\n      Defendants’ argument fails to take account of the fit between Green’s\n\nallegations and the Supreme Court’s definition of injury in cases such as\n\n                                           36\n\fJacksonville. It may well be true that Green’s ultimate fate in the UGA admissions\n\nprocess would not have been altered even if he had received the 0.5 point bonus or\n\nalternatively if non-white candidates had been denied such a bonus. In either\n\ninstance, he would have fallen into the middle group of candidates who were\n\nneither accepted nor rejected at the TSI stage, and instead were passed on to the ER\n\nstage. But the Supreme Court’s standing jurisprudence in this area unmistakably\n\nturns the focus away from that kind of result-oriented analysis and toward a\n\nprocess-oriented analysis that asks whether the plaintiff has actually been exposed\n\nto unequal treatment. Here, there is simply no question that Green’s application\n\nwas treated differently, and less favorably, than the applications of non-white\n\ncandidates solely because of race. That is enough to give him standing to\n\nchallenge the policy.\n\n      The fact that Green’s application was subsequently rejected under race-\n\nneutral criteria at the ER stage does not support the proposition that Green was not\n\nqualified to compete on equal terms with non-white applicants at the TSI stage.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Green was eventually rejected under race-neutral criteria\n\ndoes not mean that he suffered no cognizable injury from the unequal treatment.\n\n      To reiterate, the injury in these kinds of cases is not the denial of the sought-\n\nafter benefit, but rather the direct exposure to unequal treatment. See, e.g., Lesage,\n\n                                          37\n\f528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468-69 (“[t]he relevant injury . . . is ‘the inability to\n\ncompete on an equal footing.’”) (quoting Jacksonville); Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211,\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2104-05 (“The aggrieved party ‘need not allege that he would have\n\nobtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.’”) (quoting\n\nJacksonville); Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 666, 113 S. Ct. at 2303 (“The ‘injury in\n\nfact’ in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment\n\nresulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the\n\nbenefit. And in the context of a challenge to a set-aside program, the ‘injury in\n\nfact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the\n\nloss of a contract.”) (citation omitted); Cone, 5 F.3d at 1398 (inability to compete\n\non even playing field “can cause harm whether or not those forced to compete on\n\nless advantageous terms gain the benefit sought.”). The concern raised by\n\nDefendants therefore goes less to standing than it does to Green’s ability to\n\nsucceed on the merits of his claim. A showing that Green was denied admission\n\nunder race-neutral criteria, and that his application would have been handled in\n\nexactly the same way even if race were not a factor at the TSI stage, may well\n\ndefeat Green’s claim or establish a Mt. Healthy defense. But at least in this context\n\nthe Supreme Court has chosen to define the relevant injury-in-fact without regard\n\nto the end result of the defendant’s consideration of race.\n\n                                            38\n\f       A finding that plaintiff has standing simply means that the plaintiff is\n\nentitled to “walk through the courthouse door” and raise his grievance before a\n\nfederal court; it is a threshold determination that is conceptually distinct from\n\nwhether the plaintiff is entitled to prevail on the merits. Standing doctrine has been\n\ndeveloped primarily to ensure that the person seeking to litigate a claim is the\n\n“right” person to advance the claim. “The requirement that a party seeking review\n\nmust allege facts showing that he is himself adversely affected [is] at least a rough\n\nattempt to put the decision as to whether review will be sought in the hands of\n\nthose who have a direct stake in the outcome.” Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S.\n\n727, 740, 92 S. Ct. 1361, 1368-69 (1972). Especially in this area, we cannot read\n\nthe Court’s jurisprudence as conflating the standing inquiry with resolution of the\n\nmerits of the plaintiff’s attack on race-conscious governmental decision-making.\n\nDefendants’ argument that Green suffered no “injury-in-fact” is unconvincing\n\nbecause, at bottom, it conceives of the standing inquiry as duplicating an inquiry\n\ninto the merits.16\n\n\n\n\n       16\n         Although some overlap may be inevitable, standing doctrine was not intended to\nprovide a vehicle for resolution at the threshold of fundamentally merits issues. As the Supreme\nCourt has explained, standing is designed to insure that the judicial process is not transformed\ninto “no more than a vehicle for the vindication of the value interests of concerned bystanders.”\nUnited States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 687, 93 S. Ct. 2405, 2416 (1973). Green is plainly not\nsuch a plaintiff.\n\n                                               39\n\f      Our determination that Green has suffered an injury-in-fact based on his\n\nexposure to unequal treatment at the TSI stage of the admissions process does not,\n\nof course, wholly end the standing analysis. To establish standing, a plaintiff must\n\nalso show that the defendants caused the asserted injury and that a favorable\n\ndecision would be likely to redress that injury. Defendants assert that Green\n\ncannot make such a showing because even if Green were to prove that UGA acted\n\nunlawfully by considering race in the admissions process, that determination would\n\nnot yield any relief for him because he was rejected under race-neutral criteria and\n\nwould not have been admitted even if race were excluded as a factor. But once\n\nagain, this argument conflates the merits of the case, and particularly the Mt.\n\nHealthy defense, with standing. To the extent the injury here is the undisputed fact\n\nthat Green’s application was treated differently and less favorably because of his\n\nrace (not the ultimate denial of admission), that injury was unquestionably caused\n\nby Defendants and their deliberate use of race as a factor in the admissions process.\n\nMoreover, a court could redress that injury by, among other things, declaring that\n\nGreen’s application must be re-considered under an entirely race-neutral\n\nadmissions process. Although it is possible that the outcome of that process would\n\nbe exactly the same as it was under the race-conscious process actually applied to\n\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\fGreen’s application, such a determination cannot be made now under the rubric of\n\nstanding.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the district court erred by rejecting Green’s claim\n\non the single ground that he lacked standing. In the end, this Court simply cannot\n\nsquare Defendants’ logic with the concept of injury-in-fact adopted by the\n\nSupreme Court, which has recognized that the injury caused by a race-conscious\n\nadmissions or bidding process is the fact of unequal treatment, without regard to\n\nwhether race ultimately costs the plaintiff the desired benefit. This is not to say\n\nthat Green must, or should, prevail on his cause of action. Defendants may well be\n\ncorrect that Green would not have been admitted to UGA even if race were not a\n\nfactor, and may eventually defeat Green’s claim on that basis or on other grounds.\n\nWe offer no opinion at this time on Green’s likelihood of success, or the remedies\n\nhe may or may not obtain if indeed he were to prevail. We simply hold that Green\n\nestablished standing to pursue a claim on the merits, and therefore reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s entry of summary judgment against him on that basis.17\n\n\n       17\n         The district court did not discuss separately Green’s standing to seek prospective\ninjunctive relief in the form of an injunction forbidding the use of race as a factor in the UGA\nfreshman admissions process. It is unclear whether Green desires such relief or can establish the\nadditional elements necessary to have standing to seek such relief. See infra Part IV.D. We\nnote, however, that a request for prospective relief may proceed differently than a request for\nretrospective relief (such as damages or an order awarding the sought-after benefit) based on a\ncompleted, past act of discrimination. Among other things, as Lesage reinforces, a successful\nMt. Healthy defense will not necessarily preclude a finding of liability for the purpose of\n\n                                               41\n\f                                                C.\n\n       We next address the standing of Plaintiff Davis. Davis, as noted above, was\n\nrejected during the initial IA phase of the admissions process, which focused solely\n\non race-neutral objective criteria and took place before any race- or ethnicity-based\n\nconsiderations entered the picture for those proceeding to the TSI stage under the\n\napplicable 1996 version of the policy. Davis’s academic index fell below the\n\nminimum required to advance to the TSI stage -- let alone to be admitted\n\nautomatically -- and hence she was rejected on that basis. Simply put, at the only\n\nstage during which Davis’s application was considered by UGA, she was plainly\n\non an equal footing with all other applicants, and was deemed unqualified\n\naccording to entirely race-neutral criteria.18 Hence, Davis cannot claim to have\n\nsuffered any cognizable injury on account of race unless we were to find that the\n\ninjury here is exposure to an overall admissions process that includes a race-or\n\nethnicity-based component to which the plaintiff herself is not actually subject.\n\n\nawarding prospective relief to redress ongoing or likely future injury to the plaintiff. See\nLesage, 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468, 469; Thigpen v. Bibb County, 223 F.3d 1231, 1241-42\n(11th Cir. 2000) (although “same decision” defense originating in Mt. Healthy “is permitted in a\nsection 1983 equal protection suit, it obviates completely a defendant’s liability only where a\nplaintiff seeks relief for a prior instance of discrimination”) (citation omitted). That said, we\nexpress no opinion at this time on Green’s entitlement, if any, to prospective relief.\n       18\n           Davis is therefore in an entirely different posture than Green, whose application was\nactually given unequal treatment in the admissions process. As discussed above, that fact is\ncritical to the evaluation of Green’s standing.\n\n                                                42\n\f      We find no support for that strained argument in the Supreme Court’s\n\njurisprudence. Plaintiffs’ position would virtually abolish the injury-in-fact\n\nrequirement in this context, conferring a cognizable injury on every unsuccessful\n\napplicant for a government contract or admission to a public university where the\n\nprocess at some stage or for some purposes disfavors the applicant’s racial group in\n\nfavor of another, regardless of whether the plaintiff herself was actually treated\n\nunequally. The law does not go that far. In Jacksonville, Bakke, and Adarand, the\n\nplaintiffs were exposed to race-conscious criteria at the very first step of the\n\nselection process, either in the form of a fixed, race-based constraint on eligibility\n\nfor the benefit (Jacksonville, Bakke) or a race-based incentive system that\n\nadversely affected their position relative to other candidates seeking the benefit\n\n(Adarand). At no point were the bids or applications of the plaintiffs in those cases\n\neither considered without regard to race or unaffected by race-based limitations.\n\nAccordingly, we cannot draw from these cases the proposition that merely being\n\nexposed to an admissions process which considers race at some but not all stages\n\nnecessarily creates standing for all applicants who would have been ineligible for\n\nspecial treatment had they proceeded to the race-conscious stage of the process.\n\nNor does Lesage even remotely suggest that conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\f      Our decision in Cone further demonstrates the flaws in Davis’s argument.\n\nThat case involved a challenge brought by general contractors who alleged that a\n\ncounty affirmative action plan governing the award and implementation of public\n\nconstruction contracts impermissibly discriminated against non-minority firms.\n\nMost of the specific provisions challenged did not cause the plaintiffs any\n\ncognizable injury. Only one provision in the county’s plan treated minority and\n\nnon-minority general contractors differently; as to that single provision, we\n\nremanded to the district court to consider whether the plaintiffs suffered any injury\n\nas a result of it. 5 F.3d at 1399. Notably, however, we did not suggest that, if the\n\nplaintiffs had standing to challenge the one facially-discriminatory provision, they\n\nwould thereby have standing to challenge the other provisions as well; on the\n\ncontrary, we dismissed the plaintiffs’ challenge to the other provisions for lack of\n\nstanding. Id. at 1398 (affirming the dismissal of “all claims dealing with\n\nprovisions of the affirmative action program which treat minority and non-minority\n\ngeneral contractors alike, because they do not produce competition on an uneven\n\nplaying field”). In short, the plaintiffs could not use their potential exposure to\n\ndiscrimination pursuant to one provision of the county’s plan as a vehicle to assert\n\nstanding for purpose of challenging other aspects of the plan that did not cause\n\nthem cognizable injury.\n\n                                          44\n\f      Davis’s argument is even less compelling than the logic we rejected in Cone.\n\nShe contends that she has standing to challenge UGA’s admissions policy solely\n\nby virtue of the fact that one aspect of the 1996 version of the policy -- the\n\nawarding of bonus points based upon race or ethnicity at the TSI stage -- is race-\n\nconscious. But like the plaintiffs in Cone, Davis cannot challenge provisions of the\n\npolicy which did not cause her cognizable injury. And because the one provision\n\nthat did cause her injury (the AI process) is undisputedly race-neutral, she cannot\n\nprove standing to assert a claim of race discrimination.\n\n      We therefore agree with the district court that a white applicant knocked out\n\nat the first stage of the UGA admissions process based on purely race-neutral\n\ncriteria -- as part of an entirely race-neutral inquiry into objective qualifications --\n\ncannot claim to have been denied an opportunity to compete “on an equal footing”\n\nwith non-white applicants. Davis was not exposed to any unequal treatment, and\n\nher application was never actually disadvantaged because of her race. It follows\n\nthat Davis has failed to prove an injury-in-fact, and therefore necessarily fails to\n\nestablish the other elements of constitutional standing. Accordingly, we conclude\n\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\fthat the district court properly granted summary judgment on standing grounds\n\nwith respect to Plaintiff Davis.19\n\n                                               D.\n\n       For different reasons, the district court also did not err in rejecting Tracy’s\n\nclaim for prospective injunctive relief. Simply because a party prevails on the\n\nmerits of a constitutional claim does not mean that the party is automatically\n\nentitled to prospective injunctive relief. Rather, to have standing to obtain\n\nforward-looking relief, a plaintiff must show a sufficient likelihood that he will be\n\naffected by the allegedly unlawful conduct in the future.20 We discussed this\n\nrequirement and the seminal Supreme Court opinion of City of Los Angeles v.\n\n\n\n       19\n          Contrary to Plaintiffs’ argument, the fact that Green has standing to advance his claim\ndoes not mean that Davis -- who presents a materially distinct claim -- is relieved from her\nburden of proving individual standing. Compare American Iron & Steel Institute v. OSHA, 182\nF.3d 1261, 1274 n.10 (11th Cir. 1999) (declining to inquire into standing of one group of\nplaintiffs where a second group concededly had standing and both groups raised the identical\nchallenge which did not turn on any factual differences between the two groups).\n       20\n          Tracy’s uncontested standing to seek retrospective relief based on the denial of his\nadmission to UGA as part of the Fall 1995 class does not by itself give him standing to seek\nprospective injunctive relief. See Bowen v. First Family Fin. Servs., Inc., 233 F.3d 1331, 1340\n(11th Cir. 2000) (“‘[a] party with standing to advance one claim may lack standing to advance\nother claims’”); see also International Primate Protection League v. Administrators of Tulane\nEduc. Fund, 500 U.S. 72, 77, 111 S. Ct. 1700, 1704 (1991) (“[S]tanding is gauged by the specific\ncommon-law, statutory or constitutional claims that a party presents.”). Similarly, the fact that\nthis suit was brought as a class action does not alter Tracy’s obligation to show that he\nindividually satisfies the constitutional requirements of standing. See Bowen, 233 F.3d at 1339\nn.6. The possibility that Green or unnamed class members may be able to seek prospective\nrelief, therefore, does not establish Tracy’s standing to seek that relief as well.\n\n                                               46\n\fLyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S. Ct. 1660 (1983), in Church v. City of Huntsville, 30\n\nF.3d 1332 (11th Cir. 1994):\n\n      Because injunctions regulate future conduct, a party has standing to\n      seek injunctive relief only if the party alleges, and ultimately proves, a\n      real and immediate -- as opposed to a merely conjectural or\n      hypothetical -- threat of future injury. [Lyons, 461 U.S.] at 102, 103\n      S. Ct. at 1665. Logically, “a prospective remedy will provide no relief\n      for an injury that is, and likely will remain, entirely in the past.”\n      Although “past wrongs are evidence bearing on whether there is a real\n      and immediate threat of repeated injury,” O’Shea v. Littleton, 414\n      U.S. 488, 496, 94 S. Ct. 669, 676 [] (1974), “[p]ast exposure to illegal\n      conduct does not in itself show a present case or controversy\n      regarding injunctive relief . . . if unaccompanied by any continuing,\n      present adverse effects.” Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102, 103 S. Ct. at 1665\n      (alterations in original) (quoting O’Shea, 414 U.S. at 496, 94 S. Ct. at\n      676).\n\n              In Lyons, police officers had stopped Lyons for a traffic\n      violation. Id. at 97, 103 S. Ct. at 1663. Although he offered no\n      resistance or provocation, the officers applied a chokehold that\n      rendered him unconscious and seriously injured him. Id. at 99, 103 S.\n      Ct. at 1664. Lyons sued for damages and an injunction to bar future\n      police use of chokeholds absent an immediate threat of deadly force.\n      Id. at 98, 103 S. Ct. at 1663. The district court granted a preliminary\n      injunction, the court of appeals affirmed, but the Supreme Court\n      reversed. Id. at 99-100, 103 S. Ct. at 1664. The Supreme Court\n      reasoned that Lyons’ standing rested on the mere speculation that the\n      police might stop him again and that, if stopped, the arresting officers\n      might apply an unconstitutional chokehold. The Court concluded:\n\n            In order to establish an actual controversy in this case,\n            Lyons would have had not only to allege that he would\n            have another encounter with the police but also to make\n            the incredible assertion either (1) that all police officers\n            in Los Angeles always choke any citizen with whom they\n\n                                         47\n\f             happen to have an encounter, whether for the purpose of\n             arrest, issuing a citation, or for questioning, or (2) that the\n             City ordered or authorized police officers to act in such a\n             manner.\n\n      Id. at 105-06, 103 S. Ct. at 1667. According to the Court, there was no\n      “real and immediate threat” that either of the causes of Lyons’ past\n      injury -- his illegal conduct that led the police to stop his vehicle and\n      the ensuing police conduct -- would recur in the future. Lyons’\n      standing to seek damages for his past injuries, while not questioned by\n      the Court, simply did not establish that he “faced a realistic threat\n      from the future application of the City’s policy.” Id. at 106 n.7, 103 S.\n      Ct. at 1668 n.7.\n\n30 F.3d at 1337 (citations omitted). Invoking that reasoning, this Court has often\n\nemphasized that to obtain prospective injunctive relief a plaintiff must show that he\n\nfaces a substantial likelihood of injury in the future. See, e.g., Bowen, 233 F.3d at\n\n1340 (finding that plaintiff lacked standing to seek prospective injunctive relief\n\nwhere he could not “allege facts from which it appears there is a substantial\n\nlikelihood that he will suffer injury in the future”) (quoting Malowney v. Federal\n\nCollection Deposit Group, 193 F.3d 1342, 1346-47 (11th Cir. 1999)).\n\n      Tracy is now a student at UGA, and there is no evidence that he intends to\n\nre-apply for admission to UGA under any version of the freshman admissions\n\npolicy. There is no likelihood, therefore, that he will ever again be exposed to\n\nUGA’s allegedly discriminatory freshman admissions process. As Lyons makes\n\nclear, the fact that others may be exposed to that process in the future is not\n\n                                           48\n\fsufficient for Tracy to obtain prospective relief that will not benefit him in\n\nconjunction with his individual claim.\n\n      Plaintiffs make several counter-arguments, none of which is persuasive.\n\nFirst, they cite case law for the proposition that a plaintiff’s entitlement to\n\ninjunctive relief is measured at the time the complaint is filed. See Robidoux v.\n\nCelani, 987 F.2d 931, 938 (2d Cir. 1993). They contend that at the time the\n\ncomplaint was filed, Tracy had not yet transferred to UGA. As Defendants\n\nobserve, however, the policy by which UGA allegedly discriminated against Tracy\n\nwas the 1990-95 policy, which was not the policy in place at the time Plaintiffs\n\nfiled suit in 1997. The post-1995 policy was not the predicate of Tracy’s\n\nindividual claim in the complaint, and was not likely to affect Tracy at the time he\n\nfiled his complaint. There is, for example, no persuasive evidence that Tracy\n\nintended to re-apply to UGA via the freshman admissions process (on the contrary,\n\nhe sought admission to UGA through a different route -- the transfer process --\n\nsoon after the complaint was filed). Accordingly, Tracy would not have been\n\nentitled to prospective injunctive relief regarding the post-1995 policy at the time\n\nhe filed his complaint. Moreover, any prospective relief we might award with\n\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\frespect to the post-1995 policy would not redress the injury suffered by Tracy as a\n\nresult of the 1990-95 policy.21\n\n       Second, in a related argument, Plaintiffs cite decisions setting forth the\n\nproposition that a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not\n\nnecessarily render a case moot and thereby deprive a federal court of its power to\n\ndetermine the legality of the practice. See, e.g., Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 662, 113\n\nS. Ct. at 2301. But while the district court occasionally spoke of this issue in terms\n\nof mootness, the real obstacle here is standing. In other words, the problem is not\n\nthat the Defendants rescinded the unlawful 1990-95 admissions policy after the\n\ncomplaint was filed (thereby creating a potential mootness issue), but rather that\n\nthe original policy had been replaced before Tracy and the other Plaintiffs even\n\n\n\n       21\n         In Robidoux, the Second Circuit explained that “[f]or a plaintiff to have standing to\nrequest injunctive or declaratory relief, the injury alleged must be capable of being redressed\nthrough injunctive relief ‘at that moment.’ The plaintiff may meet this standard by alleging that\nthe defendant was engaging in the unlawful practice against the plaintiff at the time of the\ncomplaint.” 987 F.2d at 938 (citing County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 111 S. Ct.\n1661 (1991)). The Second Circuit described McLaughlin as setting forth an alternative to Lyons\nfor establishing standing to seek prospective relief. 987 F.2d at 938. Plaintiffs here seem to be\ntaking a similar view and arguing for standing under McLaughlin rather than under Lyons.\nMcLaughlin, however, concerned a situation where the plaintiffs were exposed to a continuing\nunconstitutional act -- a protracted delay in affording them probable cause hearings -- which was\nongoing at the time of the complaint but was cured after the filing of the complaint. The\nSupreme Court explained that the alleged violations of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights had\nnot been completed by the time of the complaint, and therefore the requirements set forth in\nLyons did not apply. 500 U.S. at 51, 111 S. Ct. at 1667. In this case, by contrast, the alleged\nviolation of Tracy’s rights -- the denial of his application for admission as a member of UGA’s\nFall 1995 freshman class -- had been completed well before Plaintiffs filed their complaint.\n\n                                               50\n\ffiled suit. Tracy never had standing to challenge the revised policy, and\n\naccordingly we never reach the question of whether Tracy’s challenge to that\n\npolicy eventually became moot.\n\n      Third, Plaintiffs maintain that the post-1995 policy is essentially the same as\n\nthe 1990-95 policy that affected Tracy, and therefore Tracy should be entitled to\n\nseek prospective relief with respect to the revised policy. This reasoning is no\n\nanswer to Tracy’s inability to satisfy the “likely future injury” requirement of\n\nLyons, however. In any event, the post-1995 policy is materially different than its\n\npredecessor. Under the 1996 and 1997 versions of revised policy, race is\n\nconsidered at only one stage of the admissions process, and applicants are not\n\n“dual-tracked” (in the sense of being held to different objective standards) based\n\non their race. Under the prior policy, by contrast, black and non-black applicants\n\nwere treated differently and held to different standards from the very outset of the\n\nevaluation process. “[A] plaintiff who has been subject to injurious conduct of one\n\nkind [does not] possess by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating\n\nconduct of another kind, although similar, to which he has not been subject.”\n\nBlum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 999, 107 S. Ct. 2777, 2783 (1982) (citing Moose\n\nLodge No. 107 v. Irvis, 407 U.S. 163, 166-167, 92 S. Ct. 1965, 1968-69 (1972)).\n\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\f      Fourth, Plaintiffs maintain that denying standing to Tracy is unfair because\n\notherwise UGA’s freshman admissions policy will be effectively unreviewable.\n\nThey appear to believe that prospective relief could only be sought by someone\n\nwho, having been rejected, is then prepared to wait out the duration of the litigation\n\nwithout seeking to gain admission to UGA as a transfer student. Moreover,\n\naccording to Plaintiffs, even if an individual plaintiff seems likely to prove a\n\nviolation, UGA can -- as it has in the past -- avoid any risk of far-reaching court-\n\nordered prospective relief with regard to its freshman admissions policy simply by\n\noffering admission to that individual. At least on the record before us, we do not\n\nshare Plaintiffs’ concern. Suffice it to say that there has been no showing that the\n\npool of potential plaintiffs able to challenge UGA’s freshman admissions policy on\n\nthese grounds is drying up. We also are confident that, regardless of any\n\nprospective relief a court might order, UGA would not ignore the import of a\n\ncontrolling federal court decision holding that its freshman admissions policy is\n\nunconstitutional. In any event, as discussed above, Tracy is not in a position to\n\nadvance these concerns as a reason to grant him standing to seek prospective\n\ninjunctive relief because he was not affected by the version of UGA’s freshman\n\nadmissions policy now in place.\n\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\f      Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that Lesage somehow entitles Tracy to\n\nprospective injunctive relief. But there is no indication in Lesage that the Court\n\nintended to alter the well-settled prerequisites to granting such relief. Plaintiffs’\n\nargument appears to be based on the Court’s statement that “[o]f course, a plaintiff\n\nwho challenges an ongoing race-conscious program and seeks forward-looking\n\nrelief need not affirmatively establish that he would receive the benefit in question\n\nif race were not considered.” 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468. But Lesage plainly\n\ndoes not hold that a plaintiff may obtain prospective injunctive relief merely by\n\nalleging “an ongoing or imminent constitutional violation,” id., arising out of a\n\npractice that has not injured him to date and is highly unlikely to injure him in the\n\nfuture.\n\n      Nor can Lesage be read to create an exception to Lyons where the\n\ndiscriminatory admissions policy is still in place. If the Supreme Court intended so\n\nsignificant and potentially far-reaching a change in the law of standing, surely it\n\nwould have said so directly, or at least cited Lyons. To reiterate, standing, qua\n\nstanding, was not even an issue in Lesage, and no question of prospective relief\n\narose there because it appeared that the plaintiff had abandoned his claim that the\n\ndefendant university was still administering a discriminatory admissions policy.\n\n528 U.S. at 22, 120 S. Ct. at 469. Tracy, therefore, lacks standing to seek\n\n                                           53\n\fprospective injunctive relief with respect to UGA’s revised freshman admissions\n\npolicy, and the district court correctly declined to grant that relief.\n\n                                                   E.\n\n       Before closing, we address briefly the district court’s denial of class\n\ncertification. The crux of the district court’s ruling was its finding that Tracy -- the\n\nonly Plaintiff with any standing at all in the eyes of the district court -- could not\n\nrepresent a class of persons challenging UGA’s freshman admissions policy.22 The\n\ncourt explained that Tracy’s own claim had become moot by virtue of his\n\nadmission to UGA as a transfer student, and that additionally there were too many\n\nquestions requiring individualized analysis for class treatment to be acceptable.\n\nThe court did not expressly consider whether Green could represent a viable class.\n\nOn appeal, Plaintiffs argue that both Tracy and Green should be permitted to serve\n\n\n\n       22\n            Plaintiffs’ class allegations were sweeping. Plaintiffs purported to represent:\n\n       [A]ll present and future students of any four-year or university-level public\n       institution of higher education in Georgia; parents of minor students of such\n       institutions; applicants for admission at such institutions; parents of minor\n       applicants for admission at such institutions; faculty and administrative\n       employees at such institutions; applicants for faculty and administrative\n       employment at such institutions; and applicants for promotion at such institutions;\n       who have been denied admission, employment, promotion, or monies based on\n       their race, within the two year period preceding the filing of this complaint.\n\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, Dec. 1, 1997, at 1. The district court appears to have\nconsidered Plaintiffs’ motion only from the standpoint of whether Tracy could represent a class\nof persons challenging UGA’s freshman admissions policy.\n\n                                                   54\n\fas class representatives, and that the class issue should be revisited with that point\n\nestablished.\n\n       The general principles regarding class certification are well-settled.23\n\nAmong other things, as a prerequisite to certification, it must be established that\n\nthe proposed class representatives have standing to pursue the claims as to which\n\nclasswide relief is sought. The standing requirement is a function not only of\n\nArticle III, but also the requirement in the class action rule -- Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 --\n\nthat the representative’s individual claim be typical of those belonging to the class\n\nmembers he seeks to represent. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) (“the claims or\n\ndefenses of the representative parties [must be] typical of the claims or defenses of\n\nthe class”). As we have explained:\n\n               It should be obvious that there cannot be adequate typicality\n       between a class and a named representative unless the named\n       representative has individual standing to raise the legal claims of the\n       class. . . . [T]ypicality measures whether a sufficient nexus exists\n       between the claims of the named representatives and those of the class\n       at large. Without individual standing to raise a legal claim, a named\n       representative does not have the requisite typicality to raise the same\n       claim on behalf of a class. As the Supreme Court has explained,\n       “[w]e have repeatedly held that a class representative must be part of\n       the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as\n       the class members.” [General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. Falcon,\n       457 U.S. 147, 156, 102 S. Ct. 2364, 2370 (1982)]. This rule makes\n\n\n       23\n         Plaintiffs sought class treatment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) (which governs claims\nfor injunctive relief) and 23(b)(3) (which governs damages claims).\n\n                                               55\n\f      especially good sense when we consider that one of the core purposes\n      of conducting typicality review is to ensure that “the named plaintiffs\n      have incentives that align with those of absent class members so as to\n      assure that the absentees’ interests will be fairly represented.”\n\n             Thus, it is well-settled that prior to the certification of a class,\n      and technically speaking before undertaking any formal typicality or\n      commonality review, the district court must determine that at least one\n      named class representative has Article III standing to raise each class\n      subclaim. “[A]ny analysis of class certification must begin with the\n      issue of standing.” Griffin v. Dugger, 823 F.2d 1476, 1482 (11th\n      Cir.1987); see also Brown v. Sibley, 650 F.2d 760, 771 (5th Cir. Unit\n      A, July 1981) (stating that the “constitutional threshold [of standing]\n      must be met before any consideration of the typicality of claims or\n      commonality of issues required for procedural reasons by Fed. R. Civ.\n      P. 23”). “Only after the court determines the issues for which the\n      named plaintiffs have standing should it address the question whether\n      the named plaintiffs have representative capacity, as defined by Rule\n      23(a), to assert the rights of others.” It is not enough that a named\n      plaintiff can establish a case or controversy between himself and the\n      defendant by virtue of having standing as to one of many claims he\n      wishes to assert. Rather, “each claim must be analyzed separately,\n      and a claim cannot be asserted on behalf of a class unless at least one\n      named plaintiff has suffered the injury that gives rise to that claim.”\n\nPrado-Steiman, 221 F.3d at 1280 (citations omitted). Thus, just as a plaintiff\n\ncannot pursue an individual claim unless he proves standing, a plaintiff cannot\n\nrepresent a class unless he has standing to raise the claims of the class he seeks to\n\nrepresent.\n\n      For the reasons discussed above, the district court did not err by concluding\n\nthat Tracy lacks standing to pursue forward-looking relief with respect to UGA’s\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\frevised freshman admissions policy. He therefore cannot represent a class seeking\n\nthat relief.\n\n       On the other hand, having now reversed the district court’s ruling that Green\n\nlacks standing, we must also vacate the denial of class certification to the extent it\n\nturned on the notion that Green could not serve as a class representative because he\n\nlacked standing to pursue a claim individually. A district court abuses its\n\ndiscretion when it denies class certification based on an incorrect legal premise.\n\nSee, e.g., Prado-Steiman, 221 F.3d at 1275 n.9 (citing SunAmerica Corp. v. Sun\n\nLife Assur. Co., 77 F.3d 1325, 1333 (11th Cir. 1996) for the proposition that a\n\n“court necessarily abuses its discretion if it ‘has applied an incorrect legal\n\nstandard’”). Whether Green could serve as representative for a class that would\n\nmeet the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), and one of the subdivisions of Rule 23(b), is a\n\nquestion for the district court to address in the first instance, not this Court,\n\nespecially as the district court did not even consider Green as a possible class\n\nrepresentative in its ruling denying class certification.24\n\n\n\n\n       24\n           Defendants do not argue that we could affirm the denial of class certification even if we\nwere to find that one or more of the Plaintiffs has standing. Although the district court based its\ndenial of class certification partially on concerns beyond standing, we shall not reach out to\naddress those concerns now. The district court, of course, may well conclude that some or all of\nits earlier concerns still exist even with Green as the proposed class representative.\n\n                                                 57\n\f      We note, however, that the district court is not required to resolve Green’s\n\nclass certification request before resolving a challenge to Green’s individual claim.\n\nIf the district court were to resolve a summary judgment motion in Defendants’\n\nfavor and in so doing dismiss Green’s individual claim before ruling on class\n\ncertification, then Green would not be an appropriate class representative. Again,\n\nhowever, we leave those matters to the district court. We simply hold that the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of class certification must be vacated to the extent it was\n\npremised on the incorrect assumption that Green lacked standing to pursue a claim\n\nindividually.\n\n                                           V.\n\n      In summary, we dismiss the appeals of Wooden, Jarvis and Bratcher, and\n\naffirm the district court’s dismissal for lack of standing of the claims brought by\n\nDavis and Tracy. We reverse the district court’s order entering summary judgment\n\non Green’s claim for lack of standing, and vacate the denial of class certification to\n\nthe extent it was based on the mistaken premise that Green wholly lacked standing.\n\nThe case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings regarding Green’s\n\nclaim consistent with this opinion.\n\n    APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\nAND VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n                                           58\n\f",

Hancock, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama,\nsitting by designation.\n\f      Plaintiffs appeal the district court’s orders dismissing for lack of standing\n\ntheir race discrimination claims against officials of the University of Georgia\n\nSystem. This litigation actually encompasses two distinct claims. One group of\n\nPlaintiffs -- Tracy, Davis, and Green (collectively, “Tracy Plaintiffs”) -- is\n\ncomposed of unsuccessful applicants to the University of Georgia; they allege that\n\nthe Defendants’ freshman admissions policies impermissibly favor non-whites over\n\nwhites in violation of the Equal Protection Clause and federal civil rights statutes.\n\nA second group of Plaintiffs -- Wooden, Jarvis, and Bratcher (collectively,\n\n“Wooden Plaintiffs”) -- is composed of individuals with ties to three historically\n\nblack institutions (“HBIs”) in Georgia’s university system; they allege that\n\noperation of the HBIs unlawfully discriminates against non-blacks. In a series of\n\norders, the district court dismissed the claims of all of these Plaintiffs for lack of\n\nstanding; the court also denied the Plaintiffs’ class certification motion, based\n\nprimarily on its rulings regarding standing.\n\n      Because the district court correctly determined that Plaintiffs Davis and\n\nTracy lack standing, we affirm that portion of the district court’s orders. In\n\naddition, the Wooden Plaintiffs failed to file their notice of appeal in a timely\n\nfashion, so we lack jurisdiction to consider their challenge to the district court’s\n\norders dismissing their claims. We conclude, however, that the district court erred\n\n                                            2\n\fby finding that Plaintiff Green lacks standing, and by rejecting on that basis\n\nGreen’s request to serve as a class representative. Accordingly, we reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s order entering summary judgment against Green for lack of\n\nstanding, and vacate the denial of class certification to the extent it was based on\n\nthe premise that Green lacks standing. The case is remanded to the district court\n\nfor further proceedings regarding Green’s claim consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                                I.\n\n                                               A.\n\n       We begin by laying out the undisputed facts of the case, starting with those\n\nfacts relevant to the Tracy Plaintiffs’ challenge to the freshman admission policies\n\nat the University of Georgia (“UGA”).1\n\n       UGA is the flagship institution of Georgia’s university system. Admission\n\nto UGA is competitive, and applications far exceed the number of available\n\nfreshman seats. To assemble a class, the faculty admission committee, in\n\nconjunction with the admissions office, recommends a freshman admission policy\n\n\n       1\n         The district court in this case has already stated in dicta its view that the UGA\nadmissions policy discriminates unlawfully to the extent it gives certain applicants preferential\ntreatment based on race at some stages of the admissions process. See, e.g., Tracy v. Board of\nRegents of the Univ. Sys. of Ga., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2408907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2408907/tracy-v-board-of-regents-of-univ-sys-of-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">59</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

We offer no opinion on that issue, as the appeal now\nbefore us concerns only standing.\n\n                                                3\n\feach year. This policy is formally presented to UGA’s president for approval, and\n\nthereafter is implemented by the admissions office.\n\n      Between 1990-1995, UGA’s freshman admissions policy applied objective\n\nacademic criteria differently depending upon whether an applicant characterized\n\nhimself as “black” or “non-black.” To be eligible for admission, an applicant had\n\nto meet certain pre-set minimums with respect to Scholastic Aptitude Test (“SAT”)\n\nscore, grade point average (“GPA”), and academic index (“AI”).2 Under the 1990-\n\n95 policy, the minimums for black students were set lower than the minimums for\n\nnon-black students. Specifically, to be eligible for admission into the Fall 1995\n\nclass, a black applicant would have to obtain at least an 800 SAT score, a 2.0 GPA,\n\nand a 2.0 academic index. By contrast, a non-black applicant would have to obtain\n\nat least a 980 SAT score, a 2.5 GPA, and a 2.4 academic index.\n\n      This was the regime when plaintiff Kirby Tracy (who is white) applied for\n\nadmission to UGA’s Fall 1995 Class. Tracy had a GPA of 3.47 and a total SAT\n\nscore of 830. Because he did not meet the minimum SAT requirement for\n\nnon-blacks, UGA denied his application. It is undisputed, however, that Tracy\n\nwould have been eligible for admission under the criteria applied to black\n\napplicants.\n\n\n      2\n       The AI is a statistic that weighs and combines an applicant’s SAT scores and GPA.\n\n                                             4\n\f       After his rejection from UGA, Tracy enrolled at Georgia College. Two\n\nyears later, in 1997, he applied and won admission to UGA as a transfer student.\n\nThe transfer application was filed shortly after this lawsuit was filed.3 At the time\n\nof summary judgment in this case, Tracy remained a student at UGA.\n\n       Meanwhile, UGA -- concerned about the constitutionality of its dual-track\n\nadmissions policy -- revised that policy in 1995 for the 1996 freshman class. With\n\nsome minor modifications, that revised policy remained in effect at the time of\n\nsummary judgment and appears to remain in effect today. The revised policy\n\ndivides the admissions process into three stages. UGA selects the majority of its\n\nfreshman class at an initial stage which applies objective academic criteria without\n\nregard to the applicant’s race. At this initial stage (the “AI stage”), UGA admits\n\nautomatically applicants whose academic indices and SAT scores are above a\n\ncertain number. From the remaining applications, UGA selects for “further\n\nevaluation” a group of applicants whose academic indices are above a certain\n\nnumber and who meet minimum SAT score requirements. Applicants who fall\n\nbelow the minimum academic index or below the minimum SAT score\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         It is unclear what criteria UGA uses to evaluate transfer applicants, although there is no\ndispute that those criteria are race-neutral.\n\n                                                 5\n\frequirement are automatically rejected. To reiterate, race is not a consideration at\n\nthe AI stage.\n\n       For each applicant placed in the pool for further evaluation, UGA calculates\n\na Total Student Index (“TSI”). The TSI is based on a combination of weighted\n\nacademic and demographic factors. It is only at this stage that UGA, under its\n\ncurrent policy, expressly considers an applicant’s race.4 Applicants whose TSI\n\nscores meet a pre-set threshold are admitted automatically, while applicants whose\n\nscores fall below a pre-set minimum are rejected. Applicants whose TSI scores fall\n\nbetween those numbers are then passed on to a third stage, where they are\n\nevaluated on an individual basis by admissions officers. This is the “edge read” or\n\n“ER” stage. At this final stage, all applicants still in the pool start with a score of\n\nzero, and ER readers look for qualities that might not have been apparent at the AI\n\nand TSI stages. Applicants who receive an ER rating above a certain number are\n\nadmitted, while those below that number are rejected. Race is not designated as a\n\nfactor at the ER stage, although the Plaintiffs contend that race is nevertheless\n\ntaken into account in determining an ER score.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        UGA also considers, among other factors, Georgia residence, alumni relationships,\nextracurricular activities, and after-school work hours.\n\n                                              6\n\f      Two Plaintiffs in this case sought admission under the post-1995 revised\n\npolicy (Tracy, as noted above, sought admission under the superseded 1990-95\n\npolicy). Plaintiff Ashley Davis, who is white, applied for admission to the 1996\n\nFall freshman class at UGA. She had a 980 SAT score, a 2.94 GPA, and a 2.21\n\nacademic index. Because her academic index was below 2.30 (the cut-off to\n\nadvance to the TSI stage), UGA denied her application at the initial AI stage. It\n\ntherefore did not compute a TSI for her, and did not consider race in rejecting her.\n\nDavis eventually enrolled as a freshman at the University of Tennessee, where she\n\nremained at the time of summary judgment. She has disclaimed any interest in\n\ntransferring to UGA, and there is no indication that she would re-apply under the\n\nfreshman admissions policy.\n\n      Plaintiff Craig Green, who is white, unsuccessfully sought admission to the\n\nFall 1997 UGA freshman class. For the 1997 freshman class, UGA required an AI\n\nof 2.50 or above to be admitted at the initial AI stage, while applicants with an AI\n\nbelow 2.25 were rejected at that stage. Students whose AIs were between 2.25 and\n\n2.50 proceeded to the TSI phase of consideration. Green was among that group of\n\napplicants, with an AI of 2.39 and a SAT equivalency score of 1170-90.\n\n      In calculating a TSI score for applicants to the 1997 freshman class, UGA\n\nawarded 0.5 points under the category “Demographic Factors” to applicants who\n\n\n                                          7\n\fself-classified themselves as non-caucasian.5 Applicants who did not do so, such\n\nas Green, did not receive the 0.5 point credit.\n\n       After sorting applicants under the TSI process, UGA offered admission to all\n\ncandidates with a TSI score of 4.40 or higher. Applicants with a TSI score below\n\n3.79 were rejected, while applicants whose TSI scores were between 3.79 and 4.39\n\nproceeded on to the final ER stage. Because of the 0.5 point credit given non-\n\nwhite applicants, however, white applicants were effectively held to a more\n\nrigorous standard. In practice, awarding the 0.5 point credit to non-white\n\napplicants meant that white applicants needed a TSI score of at least 4.40 to be\n\nadmitted at this stage, while non-white applicants needed only a 3.90. Similarly, to\n\navoid outright rejection at the TSI phase and proceed on to the ER phase, a white\n\napplicant effectively needed a TSI score of at least 3.79 TSI points, while a\n\nnon-white applicant -- because of the 0.5 point boost -- needed only 3.29.\n\n       Green received a TSI score of 3.89, which included credits for his parents’\n\neducational level, his Georgia residency, his relatively high GPA/SAT equivalency\n\n\n\n       5\n         In 1996, the year in which Davis sought admission, bonus points were awarded under a\ncategory entitled “Ethnic Diversity.” The number of points awarded depended on the particular\n“ethnic code” (such as “B” for black) specified by the applicant. It appears that black applicants\nwere awarded a larger bonus than Hispanic or other “minority” applicants. That distinction did\nnot exist in 1997, when the awarding of bonus points turned simply on whether the applicant\nidentified himself as “non-caucasian.” As shorthand in this opinion, we shall use “white” and\n“non-white” to refer to “caucasian” and “non-caucasian” when speaking of the 1997 policy.\n\n                                                8\n\fscore, and his male gender. On the basis of that score he was neither admitted nor\n\nrejected at the TSI stage, but instead went into the Edge Read pool. If Green had\n\ndesignated himself as non-white, his TSI score would have been 4.39 -- 0.5 points\n\nhigher than it was, but still just barely below the 4.40 threshold for automatic\n\nadmission. Accordingly, Green would have proceeded to the ER stage regardless\n\nof whether he received a 0.5 point credit due to his race.\n\n      At the ER stage, application files were individually read by at least two\n\nmembers of UGA’s admissions office. UGA then offered admission to all\n\napplicants with an ER score above -0.5, and denied admission to all applicants with\n\nan ER score below -0.5. Each of the two Edge Readers who reviewed Green’s\n\napplication gave him an ER score of -2.0, the lowest possible. Because that score\n\nwas well below the -0.5 cutoff for admission, UGA denied Green’s application.\n\n      Green ultimately attended Dalton College in the Fall of 1997, but in 1998\n\nsought to transfer into UGA. UGA denied his application because he lacked the\n\nnecessary credit hours to transfer to UGA from a junior college. As stated by the\n\ndistrict court, Green intends to reapply for admission to UGA as a transfer student\n\nonce he earns the requisite credit hours.\n\n\n\n\n                                            9\n\f                                               B.\n\n       The claims of the Wooden Plaintiffs relate to an entirely different set of\n\nfacts. These Plaintiffs object to Defendants’ alleged failure to “desegregate”\n\nadequately three HBIs: Ft. Valley State University, Savannah State University,\n\nand Albany State University. Plaintiff Wooden, who is black, asserts that although\n\nhe would have liked to enroll his daughter at nearby Savannah State, he refused to\n\nallow her to attend a segregated campus. Plaintiff Jarvis, who is white, is a former\n\nstudent at Ft. Valley; he alleges that the school’s continued segregation adversely\n\naffected his educational experience and undermines the reputational value of his\n\ndegree. Plaintiff Bratcher, who is white, is on the faculty at Ft. Valley; she\n\ncontends that the school’s hostility to whites adversely affects her work and makes\n\nthe school inferior. None of these Plaintiffs is a current student at an HBI, which\n\nall parties concede remain predominantly black today and Plaintiffs contend are de\n\nfacto bastions of segregation (for example, they observe that there are separate\n\nstudent unions for white and black students).6\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         The only Wooden Plaintiffs before us today are Wooden, Jarvis, and Bratcher. In their\nbrief Plaintiffs discuss a fourth Wooden Plaintiff, Marie McConnell, but McConnell was\nvoluntarily dismissed from the case on October 14, 1998, and is not a party to the appeal.\nPlaintiffs also discuss a fifth Wooden Plaintiff, Ruth Harris, but make no argument about her and\ndo not even mention her, let alone argue on her behalf, in their brief.\n\n                                               10\n\f                                                 C.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed their complaint on March 3, 1997. The complaint originally\n\nnamed eleven individuals as Plaintiffs; all but four of those individuals (and six of\n\nthe seven of the Plaintiffs participating in this appeal) are white. Named as\n\nDefendants were the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia and the\n\nChancellor of the system, Dr. Stephen Portch. Plaintiffs sought damages and\n\ninjunctive relief on race discrimination theories under the Equal Protection Clause\n\n(via 42 U.S.C. § 1983), 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, et seq. The Georgia branch of the NAACP, the Southern\n\nChristian Leadership Conference, and various African-American individuals later\n\nmoved successfully to intervene as Defendants. Green was later added as an\n\nadditional Plaintiff.\n\n       Plaintiffs eventually moved for class certification, seeking certification of an\n\nextremely broad class of persons allegedly affected by Defendants’ discriminatory\n\npractices. Plaintiff Tracy moved separately for partial summary judgment on his\n\nclaim. Defendants moved for summary judgment in their favor on all claims.7\n\n       7\n         Plaintiff Davis also moved for leave to amend her complaint to add allegations of sex\ndiscrimination. The district court denied that motion. Although Plaintiffs state that they seek\nreview of that decision, they do not address the district court’s ruling in their brief, and instead\nsimply argue that Davis has standing. For the same reasons that Davis lacks standing to pursue\nher allegation that the UGA admissions process unlawfully gives preferential treatment to non-\nwhite applicants, she lacks standing to challenge UGA’s allegedly preferential treatment of\n\n                                                 11\n\f       In an order dated January 6, 1996, the district court found that Tracy had\n\nestablished his claim of unlawful past discrimination, and therefore granted his\n\nmotion for partial summary judgment. The court reserved ruling on the\n\nrecoverability of compensatory damages, and also reserved ruling on the\n\navailability of prospective injunctive relief. In addition, the court granted\n\nDefendants’ summary judgment motion with respect to Davis, finding that she\n\nlacked standing to pursue her claim. Wooden v.

In a separate order entered on\n\nthat date, the court found that Tracy had not established the prerequisites needed to\n\nobtain prospective injunctive relief, and also that Tracy was only entitled to\n\nrecover nominal damages.8 The court denied as well Plaintiffs’ motion for class\n\ncertification.\n\n\n\nmales at the TSI stage.\n       8\n          No party has appealed the district court’s finding of liability on Tracy’s claim or the\ndistrict court’s decision to award only nominal damages on that claim.

The district court subsequently denied the Tracy\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion for reconsideration, largely repeating the analysis set out at\n\nlength in its several prior opinions.\n\n      The relevant portions of the district court’s rulings may be summarized as\n\nfollows. With respect to Tracy’s request for prospective injunctive relief, the\n\ndistrict court initially concluded that this request was moot because Tracy\n\ntransferred to UGA in 1997 and therefore had no reason to pursue an order\n\ncompelling his admission to UGA. Subsequently, after this Court’s remand, the\n\ndistrict court explained that its earlier mootness analysis was incorrect.\n\nNevertheless, the court reinstated its prior decision on the ground that Tracy lacked\n\nstanding to obtain any form of prospective relief regarding UGA’s freshman\n\nadmissions policy, given that Tracy would never again be subject to that policy and\n\naccordingly could not establish the prospect of imminent harm necessary for him to\n\nhave standing to seek a prospective injunction.\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\f         With respect to Davis, the district court found that she did not suffer any\n\ninjury-in-fact. It reasoned that because she was denied admission outright at the AI\n\nstage, without ever proceeding to the TSI stage, she could not establish that race\n\nwas a factor in the denial of her application, and specifically could not establish\n\nthat UGA’s discriminatory practices made her unable to compete on an equal\n\nfooting with similarly-situated non-white applicants.\n\n         With respect to Green, the court found that he lacked standing to sue on an\n\n“equal footing” theory because even though he went through the race-conscious\n\nTSI phase of UGA’s admissions process, he would have been rejected regardless\n\nof whether UGA had given him racial bonus points. In the words of the district\n\ncourt:\n\n                [T]he parties focus on whether Green suffered an\n         “injury-in-fact.” While they agree that UGA took the ethnic/racial\n         status of applicants into account through its TSI computation, they\n         disagree on whether that amounted to a constitutionally sufficient\n         injury in Green’s case. Defendants insist that, because Green’s race\n         was not a factor in the ultimate decision to deny his application, he\n         lacks standing to challenge UGA’s admission policy. Even if Green\n         had received the .5 bonus for “non-white” ethnic status at the TSI\n         stage, they point out, his application still would have been relegated to\n         the final (ER) admissions stage.\n\n                 [A]lthough UGA may have affirmatively considered his race at\n         some point in the admissions process, the unrebutted evidence shows\n         that its final decision to reject his application was not based on race.\n         Nor did Green reach the final stage (i.e., had his file “edge read”)\n         because of his race. . . .\n\n                                            15\n\f              Green argues that he nevertheless has standing because UGA’s\n      admissions process (as opposed to its denial of admission) inflicted a\n      constitutional injury upon him. Just having his application threaded\n      through a process which employed race-counting (at the TSI stage), he\n      contends, is enough. . . . [The] cases require Green to show that the\n      system prevented him from competing on an equal footing. Green\n      fails in this regard because he has not shown that he was otherwise\n      qualified and then had his “bid” for admission subjected to a “tainted”\n      admissions process. . . . [He] cannot say that he was prevented,\n      because of his race, from competing “on an equal footing” with\n      non-whites. Accordingly, Green has not suffered an “injury-in-fact”\n      sufficient to have standing to challenge UGA’s admission policy on\n      equal protection grounds.\n\n59 F. Supp. 2d at 1318-21 (citations omitted).\n\n      With respect to the Wooden Plaintiffs, the court found that their alleged\n\ngrievances were too attenuated to constitute the “injury-in-fact” necessary to have\n\nstanding. Finally, on the issue of class certification, the district court ruled that\n\nTracy -- the only Plaintiff found to have standing in the case -- was not an adequate\n\nclass representative because his individual request for prospective injunctive relief\n\nregarding the freshman admissions policy had become moot. The court also\n\nconcluded that the need for individualized analysis of class members’ claims made\n\nclass treatment inappropriate. The court did not separately consider the ability of\n\nGreen or any other Plaintiff to serve as a class representative, apparently because\n\nthe court had previously decided that those Plaintiffs lacked standing to pursue\n\nclaims on their own behalf.\n\n\n                                           16\n\f                                               II.\n\n       There can be no dispute about the proper standard of review of the district\n\ncourt’s orders granting Defendants’ motions for summary judgment and denying\n\nclass certification. We review a district court’s grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, applying the same legal standards used by the district court. See, e.g.,\n\nHilburn v. Murata Elecs. N. America, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1225 (11th Cir. 1999).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate where “there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.”\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We “view the evidence and all factual inferences therefrom\n\nin the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion” and “‘all reasonable\n\ndoubts about the facts [are] resolved in favor of the non-movant.’” See Burton v.\n\nCity of Belle Glade, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"73781\"><a href=\"/opinion/73781/burton-v-city-of-belle-glade/\"><span class=\"volume\">178</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187 (11th Cir. 1999) (quoting Clemons v.\n\nDougherty County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"406827\"><a href=\"/opinion/406827/ernest-leon-clemons-v-dougherty-county-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">684</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1368-69 (11th Cir. 1982) (citations omitted)).9\n\n       9\n         Even outside of summary judgment, questions of standing are reviewed de novo.

R. Civ. P. 52(a)].”\nWhile it certainly is true that this Court generally reviews a district court’s underlying factual\nfindings only for clear error, a district court’s ultimate resolution of a legal question such as\nstanding is always reviewed de novo. See, e.g., id.; Bischoff v. Osceola County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">874</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n879 (11th Cir. 2000). More to the point, a district court does not make factual findings in\ndeciding a summary judgment motion, so no question of clear error review even arises here. See\nRosen v. Benzer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610582\"><a href=\"/opinion/610582/morris-rosen-debtor-v-karen-e-bezner-trustee-morris-rosen/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1530 n.2 (3d Cir. 1993) (“because summary judgment may\nonly be granted where there is no genuine issue of material fact, any purported ‘factual findings’\nof the [trial] court cannot be ‘factual findings’ as to disputed issues of fact, but rather are\nconclusions as a matter of law that no genuine issue of material fact exists”).\n\n                                                17\n\fWe review orders denying class certification for abuse of discretion.

Although Defendants\n\nstate that they “believe” jurisdiction exists, they nevertheless suggest that some or\n\nall of the Plaintiffs may have filed untimely notices of appeal. We must consider\n\nour jurisdiction regardless of whether any objection is raised by the parties. See,\n\ne.g., Rembert v.

Upon doing so\n\nin this case, we conclude that although we have jurisdiction over the appeal of the\n\nTracy Plaintiffs, we lack jurisdiction with respect to the Wooden Plaintiffs.\n\n      The district court, as noted above, entered its order on remand on June 16,\n\n2000. That order reinstated the district court’s prior, vacated decisions and again\n\ngranted summary judgment to the Defendants on the claims now at issue. On June\n\n30, 2000, the Tracy Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration; the Wooden Plaintiffs,\n\nnotably, did not so move and did not join in the Tracy Plaintiffs’ motion. The\n\n\n                                          18\n\fdistrict court denied the reconsideration motion on July 24, 2000, and a notice of\n\nappeal on behalf of both sets of Plaintiffs was filed on August 17, 2000 -- less than\n\n30 days after the denial of reconsideration, but over two months after the June 16\n\norder entering summary judgment.\n\n      For a notice of appeal to be timely in a civil case where the United States is\n\nnot a party, it must be filed within 30 days of the judgment or order appealed from.\n\nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1). Absent the filing of a timely notice, this Court does not\n\nhave jurisdiction over the appeal. See, e.g., Burnam v. Amoco Container Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"438797\"><a href=\"/opinion/438797/mable-y-burnam-v-amoco-container-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1230</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1231 (11th Cir. 1984). Rule 4(a)(4), however, provides that the time\n\nfor filing a notice of appeal is tolled by the filing with the district court of a timely\n\nmotion to alter or amend judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59. See, e.g., Great\n\nAmerican Ins. Co. v. Rush, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"399386\"><a href=\"/opinion/399386/great-american-insurance-company-a-corporation-v-george-s-rush/\"><span class=\"volume\">670</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 996 (11th Cir. 1982). Consequently, a\n\nnotice of appeal filed within 30 days of the disposition of the Rule 59 motion is\n\ntimely. See id.\n\n      Defendants suggest, but do not argue affirmatively, that the Tracy Plaintiffs’\n\nreconsideration motion did not extend the time for filing a notice of appeal because\n\nit never referred specifically to Fed. R. Civ. P. 59. We have explained, however,\n\nthat “[w]hether a motion for post-judgment relief can be categorized as a motion\n\nunder Rule 59 is not determined by whether the movant so labels it. Rather, the\n\n\n                                            19\n\fcourt must determine independently what type of motion was before the district\n\ncourt, depending upon the type of relief requested.” Wright v. Preferred Research,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"533650\"><a href=\"/opinion/533650/sidney-h-wright-iii-v-preferred-research-inc-a-georgia-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">891</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">886</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888 (11th Cir. 1990). Moreover, “Rule 59 applies to motions\n\nfor reconsideration of matters encompassed in a decision on the merits of a\n\ndispute.” Id. The Tracy Plaintiffs’ motion directly challenged the district court’s\n\nJune 16 order and fits within any fair conception of a reconsideration motion.\n\nAccordingly, the Tracy Plaintiffs’ notice of appeal was timely because it was filed\n\nwithin 30 days of the denial of their motion for reconsideration.\n\n       The Wooden Plaintiffs are in a different posture. They did not join in the\n\nreconsideration motion, and thus were required to -- but did not -- file a notice of\n\nappeal with respect to the dismissal of their claims within 30 days of the June 16\n\norder. Both the docket sheet and the pleadings themselves indicate that only the\n\nTracy Plaintiffs moved for reconsideration. The first line of the motion reads:\n\n       COMES NOW the Plaintiffs ASHLEY DAVIS (Davis), KIRBY\n       TRACY (Tracy) and CRAIG GREEN (Green) [collectively the UGA\n       Plaintiffs] and respectfully request that the Court reconsider its June\n       16, 2000 Order . . .\n\nIn a footnote, the Tracy Plaintiffs explained that the Wooden Plaintiffs had no part\n\nin the motion for reconsideration.10 The footnote reads:\n\n       10\n         Moreover, the memorandum in support of the motion for reconsideration focuses only\non the claims of the Tracy Plaintiffs. It discusses in detail the need for reconsideration with\nrespect to Tracy, Davis, and Green, but makes no mention of the other Plaintiffs. The district\n\n                                               20\n\f       The remaining Wooden plaintiffs who challenge defendants’\n       continued maintenance of racially segregated “historically black”\n       universities will file a separate motion and brief seeking consideration\n       of their standing, and take no part in this motion.\n\nA review of the docket sheet and the record reveals that the Wooden Plaintiffs\n\nnever filed any motion or brief seeking reconsideration of the June 16 order.\n\n       Plaintiffs do not suggest, nor could they, that the Tracy Plaintiffs’ motion by\n\ndefinition encompassed the Wooden Plaintiffs. Not only did the motion state\n\nspecifically that the Wooden Plaintiffs would be moving separately, the claims of\n\nthe two groups of Plaintiffs were litigated on an individual basis and are\n\nanalytically distinct.11 At least in this context, the filing of a joint notice of appeal\n\nfrom a final order resolving a group of individual claims does not relieve each\n\nplaintiff of his obligation to file a timely notice of appeal with respect to his own\n\nparticular claim; the fact that the notice may be timely for some other plaintiff is\n\nimmaterial.

To understand Lesage, however, it is essential to\n\nexamine earlier Supreme Court decisions discussing standing in connection with a\n\nparty’s challenge to a competitive state-sponsored selection process that allegedly\n\n\n                                          24\n\fdiscriminates based on race. The Court in Lesage relied upon those decisions, and\n\nwe think it is those decisions -- rather than merely Lesage -- that ultimately answer\n\nthe questions now before us.\n\n      The first of those decisions is Northeastern Florida Chapter, Associated\n\nGeneral Contractors of America v. City of Jacksonville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112884\"><a href=\"/opinion/112884/northeastern-fla-chapter-associated-gen-contractors-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That case involved a challenge to a municipal ordinance which\n\neffectively set aside a portion of all city contracts for bidding only by minority-\n\nowned firms. The plaintiff was an association which included many non-minority\n\nfirms that bid regularly on city contracts, but were barred from bidding on the\n\nset-aside contracts. The city argued that the plaintiff lacked standing because it\n\nfailed to show that any of its members would have bid successfully on any of the\n\ncontracts as to which they were precluded from bidding. The Supreme Court\n\nrejected that argument, emphasizing that it was immaterial for standing purposes\n\nwhether any of the non-minority firms would have obtained the contracts were it\n\nnot for the city’s discrimination:\n\n      When the government erects a barrier that makes it more difficult for\n      members of one group to obtain a benefit than it is for members of\n      another group, a member of the former group seeking to challenge the\n      barrier need not allege that he would have obtained the benefit but for\n      the barrier in order to establish standing. The “injury in fact” in an\n      equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment\n      resulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability\n      to obtain the benefit. See, e.g., Turner v. Fouche, [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108027\"><a href=\"/opinion/108027/turner-v-fouche/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 362,\n\n                                          25\n\f      </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108027\"><a href=\"/opinion/108027/turner-v-fouche/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

And in the context of a\n      challenge to a set-aside program, the “injury in fact” is the inability to\n      compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of a\n      contract. . . . To establish standing, therefore, a party challenging a\n      set-aside program like Jacksonville’s need only demonstrate that it is\n      able and ready to bid on contracts and that a discriminatory policy\n      prevents it from doing so on an equal basis.\n\n508 U.S. at 666, 113 S.

Having defined the relevant “injury-in-fact” as\n\n“the inability to compete on an equal footing,” the Court explained that it “follows\n\nfrom our definition . . . that petitioner has sufficiently alleged both that the city’s\n\nordinance is the ‘cause’ of its injury and that a judicial decree directing the city to\n\ndiscontinue its program would ‘redress’ the injury.” Id. at 666 n.5, 113 S.

Bakke, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109930\"><a href=\"/opinion/109930/university-of-california-regents-v-bakke/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In Bakke, an unsuccessful white applicant to a\n\nstate medical school claimed that the school’s admissions program, which reserved\n\n16 of 100 places in the entering class for minority applicants, was inconsistent with\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause. Addressing the argument that the applicant lacked\n\nstanding to challenge the admissions program, Justice Powell (in a portion of his\n\n                                           26\n\fopinion joined by a majority of the Court) concluded that the “constitutional\n\nrequirements of Art[icle] III” had been satisfied because the requisite “injury” was\n\nthe school’s “decision not to permit Bakke to compete for all 100 places in the\n\nclass, simply because of his race.” Id. at 281 n.14, 98 S. Ct. at 2743 n.14. Thus,\n\n“even if Bakke had been unable to prove that he would have been admitted in the\n\nabsence of the special program, it would not follow that he lacked standing.” Id.\n\n      Subsequent to Jacksonville, the Court decided Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\n\nPea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2097</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). Adarand, like Jacksonville, arose out\n\nof a contract bidding process. The plaintiff, a non-minority subcontracting firm,\n\nwas the low bidder for a subcontracting job on a federal highway project. The job\n\nwas awarded to a minority-owned firm, however, because a federal law effectively\n\nawarded financial incentives to general contractors hiring minority subcontractors.\n\nThe defendant argued that the plaintiff lacked standing to seek prospective\n\ninjunctive relief. The Court rejected that argument, and in so doing, also rejected\n\nthe notion that the plaintiff was required to show it was likely to be the low bidder\n\non future government contracts and hence likely to be awarded future contracts\n\nabsent the discriminatory incentive system:\n\n      Adarand’s claim that the Government’s use of subcontractor\n      compensation clauses denies it equal protection of the laws of course\n      alleges an invasion of a legally protected interest, and it does so in a\n\n                                          27\n\f      manner that is “particularized” as to Adarand. We note that, contrary\n      to respondents’ suggestion, [] Adarand need not demonstrate that it\n      has been, or will be, the low bidder on a Government contract. The\n      injury in cases of this kind is that a “discriminatory classification\n      prevent[s] the plaintiff from competing on an equal footing.” The\n      aggrieved party “need not allege that he would have obtained the\n      benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.”\n\n515 U.S. at 210, 115 S. Ct. at 2104-05 (quoting Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 667, 113\n\nS. Ct. at 2304).\n\n      Adarand plainly reinforced the principle adopted in Jacksonville and Bakke:\n\nwhen a plaintiff competing for a government-sponsored benefit has been treated\n\ndifferently because of race, he has standing to challenge that differential treatment\n\nbecause his application has not been considered “on an equal footing” with\n\napplications from members of the favored racial group. This Court, in standing-\n\nrelated opinions subsequent to Jacksonville and Adarand, has likewise focused on\n\nthe injury caused by direct exposure to unequal treatment, without regard to\n\nwhether the plaintiff ultimately may obtain the sought-after benefit. In Cone Corp.\n\nv. Hillsborough County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"653727\"><a href=\"/opinion/653727/the-cone-corporation-jw-conner-sons-bulger-contracting-co-boyce/\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1397</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir. 1993) (per curiam), for example,\n\nwe explained that when an affirmative action plan subjects the plaintiff to\n\n“competition on an uneven playing field, . . . [s]uch unequal competition . . . can\n\ncause harm whether or not those forced to compete on less advantageous terms\n\ngain the benefit sought.” Id. at 1398 (citing Jacksonville). Similarly, in\n\n                                          28\n\fEngineering Contractors Association of South Florida, Inc. v.

Id. at 906\n\n(citing Jacksonville).\n\n         We come, then, to the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Lesage. In that\n\ncase, a white plaintiff named Lesage brought an action under § 1983 for money\n\ndamages and prospective injunctive relief after unsuccessfully applying to a Ph.D.\n\nprogram at the University of Texas. The university admitted that race was a factor\n\nat some stages of the admissions process (although the record did not establish\n\nwhether Lesage’s application ever reached one of those stages). The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment to the university, on the ground that Lesage would\n\nhave been denied admission even if race had not been a factor in the admissions\n\nprocess. Reversing the district court, the Fifth Circuit held that Lesage’s chances\n\nunder a color-blind admissions scheme were irrelevant because, if Lesage could\n\nprove that his application was treated differently because of race, then he would be\n\nentitled to prevail on the merits under the logic of the “equal footing” standing\n\ncases.\n\n\n\n\n                                          29\n\f      The Supreme Court reversed the Fifth Circuit, holding that “[i]nsofar as the\n\nCourt of Appeals held that summary judgment was inappropriate on Lesage’s §\n\n1983 action seeking damages for the school’s rejection of his application . . . even\n\nif petitioners conclusively established that Lesage would have been rejected under\n\na race-neutral policy, its decision is inconsistent with this Court’s well-established\n\nframework for analyzing such claims.” 528 U.S. at 20, 120 S.

Healthy, explained the\n\nCourt, “even if the government has considered an impermissible criterion in\n\nmaking a decision adverse to the plaintiff, it can nonetheless defeat liability by\n\ndemonstrating that it would have made the same decision absent the forbidden\n\nconsideration. . . . Simply put, where a plaintiff challenges a discrete governmental\n\ndecision as being based on an impermissible criterion and it is undisputed that the\n\ngovernment would have made the same decision regardless, there is no cognizable\n\ninjury warranting relief under § 1983.” Lesage, 528 U.S. at 20-21, 120 S.

In the\n\ncourse of that discussion, the Court referred to its earlier standing-related decisions\n\ndefining the relevant injury in cases challenging an affirmative action policy:\n\n       Of course, a plaintiff who challenges an ongoing race-conscious\n       program and seeks forward-looking relief need not affirmatively\n       establish that he would receive the benefit in question if race were not\n       considered.

Whether or not the opinion\n\nexpressly discusses standing, it plainly bears on that inquiry because it further\n\ndefines the kind of injury that would support relief in a case challenging the\n\nprocess of awarding benefits under a government affirmative action plan. “Injury-\n\nin-fact” is the touchstone of standing, see, e.g., Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560, 112 S. Ct.\n\nat 2136, and it is to Supreme Court decisions such as Lesage that we must look in\n\ndefining the relevant injury in these types of cases.14\n\n       The difficulty, of course, is determining the scope of the Court’s statement --\n\nfirst made in Jacksonville, reiterated in Adarand, and repeated most recently in\n\n\n       14\n          Lesage is also notable because it applies in a university admissions case the “equal\nfooting” principle developed primarily in government contract cases. In both types of cases, the\nplaintiff is competing against others for a benefit conferred on some, but not all, by the state.\nAfter Lesage, Jacksonville and Adarand are not distinguishable simply because they involve the\nprocess of awarding government contracts.\n\n                                               32\n\fLesage -- that “[t]he relevant injury . . . is ‘the inability to compete on an equal\n\nfooting.’” Lesage, 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468-69 (quoting Jacksonville). In\n\nthe context of this case, and holding aside the additional considerations raised by a\n\nclaim for prospective injunctive relief, see infra Part IV.D, there are at least three\n\npossible interpretations. As the Tracy Plaintiffs see it, it is enough to allege that at\n\nsome stage in the UGA freshman admissions process a white applicant will be\n\ndisadvantaged because of race. In other words, viewing the admissions process as\n\na whole, white applicants do not compete on an equal footing with non-white\n\napplicants, and that fact alone creates an injury sufficient to confer standing on all\n\nunsuccessful white applicants. It follows, Plaintiffs say, that mere participation in\n\nthe race-conscious admissions process is enough to establish injury, regardless of\n\nwhether the applicant would have been knocked out under race-neutral criteria\n\nbefore or after the particular stage of the admissions process where race was\n\nconsidered.\n\n      Defendants, unsurprisingly, take a different view. As they see it, for a white\n\napplicant to claim that he has been denied an opportunity to compete on an equal\n\nfooting with non-white applicants, he necessarily must show that he is, in fact, able\n\nto compete equally. The upshot of this position is that regardless of whether a\n\ncandidate’s application was treated less favorably because of his race, if the\n\n                                           33\n\fcandidate is unable to show that the fate of his application was altered due to race,\n\nthen he would not be able to show that he was in a position to compete equally and\n\ntherefore would lack standing. Consequently, not only is mere participation in a\n\nrace-conscious admissions program insufficient to confer standing, actual\n\ndissimilar treatment of an application at some stage of the process is not enough\n\nunless the candidate could show that he was knocked out because of race.\n\n      A third view would strike a middle ground between the conflicting positions\n\nof the parties. According to that view, the critical inquiry for standing purposes\n\nwould be whether the plaintiff’s application has actually been treated differently at\n\nsome stage in the admissions process on the basis on race. If so, then the plaintiff\n\nhas not competed on an equal footing with other applicants outside his racial\n\nclassification, and standing should be conferred regardless of whether race is\n\nultimately a factor in the decision to reject the application. Conversely, if the\n\nplaintiff’s application is never actually treated differently because of race, then the\n\nfact that race may be a consideration in assessing other applicants at a different\n\nstage of the process should not by itself confer standing. As discussed below, it is\n\nthis approach which we find most consonant with binding Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.\n\n                                          B.\n\n                                          34\n\f       We think Green’s standing presents the most difficult question in the appeal.\n\nIt is undisputed that UGA’s post-1995 freshman admissions policy made race a\n\nfactor in evaluating applicants. It is also established, on this record, that race was a\n\nfactor only at the TSI stage, and was not an express consideration at the initial AI\n\nstage or the final ER stage.15 Drawing on that distinction, Defendants insist that\n\nGreen was not injured by UGA’s consideration of race as a factor under the 1997\n\nversion of the admissions policy because (1) his application would have proceeded\n\nto the ER stage regardless of whether he received the 0.5 point bonus given to\n\nsimilarly-situated non-white applicants (i.e., he would not have been admitted\n\nautomatically at the TSI stage even if he received the bonus); (2) scores from the\n\nTSI stage did not carry over to the ER stage; and (3) race was not a factor at the ER\n\nstage (the stage at which he was denied admission). Plaintiffs respond that Green’s\n\nclaim fits squarely under Jacksonville: at the TSI stage he was plainly not “on an\n\nequal footing” with non-white applicants because those applicants received a bonus\n\nthat he did not. Defendants counter that even so, Green was not tangibly injured\n\n\n\n       15\n         Green contends that race is indeed a factor, although an unstated one, at the subjective\nER stage. The district court rejected Green’s argument in denying his motion for\nreconsideration. According to Defendants, there is no evidence in the record that race was a\npermissible factor, or was in practice a factor, in the ER process during the year that Green’s\napplication was considered. Because we find that Green has standing regardless of whether race\nwas considered in the examination of his application during the ER stage, we do not resolve that\ndebate, and leave the issue for further development (if appropriate) on remand.\n\n                                               35\n\fby any “unequal” treatment because he was rejected at a stage of the process which\n\ndid not consider race.\n\n      We think Defendants take too narrow a view of the significance of UGA’s\n\ndecision to consider race at the TSI stage. As set forth above, the Supreme Court\n\nhas explained repeatedly that “[t]he ‘injury in fact’ in an equal protection case of\n\nthis variety is the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the\n\nbarrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.” Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at\n\n666, 113 S. Ct. at 2303. The Court’s decisions establish that when an applicant\n\ncompeting for a government benefit has been exposed to unequal treatment, it is\n\nthe exposure to unequal treatment which constitutes the injury-in-fact giving rise to\n\nstanding. See Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211, 115 S. Ct. at 2104-05 (“The injury in\n\ncases of this kind is that a ‘discriminatory classification prevent[s] the plaintiff\n\nfrom competing on an equal footing.’”) (quoting Jacksonville). In this case, the\n\nundisputed record shows that Green’s application was denied equal treatment at the\n\nTSI stage -- he did not receive the 0.5 bonus awarded to non-white candidates. He\n\ntherefore was not allowed to compete on an equal footing with non-white\n\ncandidates at the TSI stage.\n\n      Defendants’ argument fails to take account of the fit between Green’s\n\nallegations and the Supreme Court’s definition of injury in cases such as\n\n                                           36\n\fJacksonville. It may well be true that Green’s ultimate fate in the UGA admissions\n\nprocess would not have been altered even if he had received the 0.5 point bonus or\n\nalternatively if non-white candidates had been denied such a bonus. In either\n\ninstance, he would have fallen into the middle group of candidates who were\n\nneither accepted nor rejected at the TSI stage, and instead were passed on to the ER\n\nstage. But the Supreme Court’s standing jurisprudence in this area unmistakably\n\nturns the focus away from that kind of result-oriented analysis and toward a\n\nprocess-oriented analysis that asks whether the plaintiff has actually been exposed\n\nto unequal treatment. Here, there is simply no question that Green’s application\n\nwas treated differently, and less favorably, than the applications of non-white\n\ncandidates solely because of race. That is enough to give him standing to\n\nchallenge the policy.\n\n      The fact that Green’s application was subsequently rejected under race-\n\nneutral criteria at the ER stage does not support the proposition that Green was not\n\nqualified to compete on equal terms with non-white applicants at the TSI stage.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Green was eventually rejected under race-neutral criteria\n\ndoes not mean that he suffered no cognizable injury from the unequal treatment.\n\n      To reiterate, the injury in these kinds of cases is not the denial of the sought-\n\nafter benefit, but rather the direct exposure to unequal treatment. See, e.g., Lesage,\n\n                                          37\n\f528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468-69 (“[t]he relevant injury . . . is ‘the inability to\n\ncompete on an equal footing.’”) (quoting Jacksonville); Adarand, 515 U.S. at 211,\n\n115 S. Ct. at 2104-05 (“The aggrieved party ‘need not allege that he would have\n\nobtained the benefit but for the barrier in order to establish standing.’”) (quoting\n\nJacksonville); Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 666, 113 S. Ct. at 2303 (“The ‘injury in\n\nfact’ in an equal protection case of this variety is the denial of equal treatment\n\nresulting from the imposition of the barrier, not the ultimate inability to obtain the\n\nbenefit. And in the context of a challenge to a set-aside program, the ‘injury in\n\nfact’ is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the\n\nloss of a contract.”) (citation omitted); Cone, 5 F.3d at 1398 (inability to compete\n\non even playing field “can cause harm whether or not those forced to compete on\n\nless advantageous terms gain the benefit sought.”). The concern raised by\n\nDefendants therefore goes less to standing than it does to Green’s ability to\n\nsucceed on the merits of his claim. A showing that Green was denied admission\n\nunder race-neutral criteria, and that his application would have been handled in\n\nexactly the same way even if race were not a factor at the TSI stage, may well\n\ndefeat Green’s claim or establish a Mt. Healthy defense. But at least in this context\n\nthe Supreme Court has chosen to define the relevant injury-in-fact without regard\n\nto the end result of the defendant’s consideration of race.\n\n                                            38\n\f       A finding that plaintiff has standing simply means that the plaintiff is\n\nentitled to “walk through the courthouse door” and raise his grievance before a\n\nfederal court; it is a threshold determination that is conceptually distinct from\n\nwhether the plaintiff is entitled to prevail on the merits. Standing doctrine has been\n\ndeveloped primarily to ensure that the person seeking to litigate a claim is the\n\n“right” person to advance the claim. “The requirement that a party seeking review\n\nmust allege facts showing that he is himself adversely affected [is] at least a rough\n\nattempt to put the decision as to whether review will be sought in the hands of\n\nthose who have a direct stake in the outcome.” Sierra Club v.

Especially in this area, we cannot read\n\nthe Court’s jurisprudence as conflating the standing inquiry with resolution of the\n\nmerits of the plaintiff’s attack on race-conscious governmental decision-making.\n\nDefendants’ argument that Green suffered no “injury-in-fact” is unconvincing\n\nbecause, at bottom, it conceives of the standing inquiry as duplicating an inquiry\n\ninto the merits.16\n\n\n\n\n       16\n         Although some overlap may be inevitable, standing doctrine was not intended to\nprovide a vehicle for resolution at the threshold of fundamentally merits issues.

Green is plainly not\nsuch a plaintiff.\n\n                                               39\n\f      Our determination that Green has suffered an injury-in-fact based on his\n\nexposure to unequal treatment at the TSI stage of the admissions process does not,\n\nof course, wholly end the standing analysis. To establish standing, a plaintiff must\n\nalso show that the defendants caused the asserted injury and that a favorable\n\ndecision would be likely to redress that injury. Defendants assert that Green\n\ncannot make such a showing because even if Green were to prove that UGA acted\n\nunlawfully by considering race in the admissions process, that determination would\n\nnot yield any relief for him because he was rejected under race-neutral criteria and\n\nwould not have been admitted even if race were excluded as a factor. But once\n\nagain, this argument conflates the merits of the case, and particularly the Mt.\n\nHealthy defense, with standing. To the extent the injury here is the undisputed fact\n\nthat Green’s application was treated differently and less favorably because of his\n\nrace (not the ultimate denial of admission), that injury was unquestionably caused\n\nby Defendants and their deliberate use of race as a factor in the admissions process.\n\nMoreover, a court could redress that injury by, among other things, declaring that\n\nGreen’s application must be re-considered under an entirely race-neutral\n\nadmissions process. Although it is possible that the outcome of that process would\n\nbe exactly the same as it was under the race-conscious process actually applied to\n\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\fGreen’s application, such a determination cannot be made now under the rubric of\n\nstanding.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the district court erred by rejecting Green’s claim\n\non the single ground that he lacked standing. In the end, this Court simply cannot\n\nsquare Defendants’ logic with the concept of injury-in-fact adopted by the\n\nSupreme Court, which has recognized that the injury caused by a race-conscious\n\nadmissions or bidding process is the fact of unequal treatment, without regard to\n\nwhether race ultimately costs the plaintiff the desired benefit. This is not to say\n\nthat Green must, or should, prevail on his cause of action. Defendants may well be\n\ncorrect that Green would not have been admitted to UGA even if race were not a\n\nfactor, and may eventually defeat Green’s claim on that basis or on other grounds.\n\nWe offer no opinion at this time on Green’s likelihood of success, or the remedies\n\nhe may or may not obtain if indeed he were to prevail. We simply hold that Green\n\nestablished standing to pursue a claim on the merits, and therefore reverse the\n\ndistrict court’s entry of summary judgment against him on that basis.17\n\n\n       17\n         The district court did not discuss separately Green’s standing to seek prospective\ninjunctive relief in the form of an injunction forbidding the use of race as a factor in the UGA\nfreshman admissions process. It is unclear whether Green desires such relief or can establish the\nadditional elements necessary to have standing to seek such relief. See infra Part IV.D. We\nnote, however, that a request for prospective relief may proceed differently than a request for\nretrospective relief (such as damages or an order awarding the sought-after benefit) based on a\ncompleted, past act of discrimination. Among other things, as Lesage reinforces, a successful\nMt. Healthy defense will not necessarily preclude a finding of liability for the purpose of\n\n                                               41\n\f                                                C.\n\n       We next address the standing of Plaintiff Davis. Davis, as noted above, was\n\nrejected during the initial IA phase of the admissions process, which focused solely\n\non race-neutral objective criteria and took place before any race- or ethnicity-based\n\nconsiderations entered the picture for those proceeding to the TSI stage under the\n\napplicable 1996 version of the policy. Davis’s academic index fell below the\n\nminimum required to advance to the TSI stage -- let alone to be admitted\n\nautomatically -- and hence she was rejected on that basis. Simply put, at the only\n\nstage during which Davis’s application was considered by UGA, she was plainly\n\non an equal footing with all other applicants, and was deemed unqualified\n\naccording to entirely race-neutral criteria.18 Hence, Davis cannot claim to have\n\nsuffered any cognizable injury on account of race unless we were to find that the\n\ninjury here is exposure to an overall admissions process that includes a race-or\n\nethnicity-based component to which the plaintiff herself is not actually subject.\n\n\nawarding prospective relief to redress ongoing or likely future injury to the plaintiff. See\nLesage, 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468, 469; Thigpen v. Bibb County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770087\"><a href=\"/opinion/770087/william-t-thigpen-jr-and-james-w-allen-v-bibb-county-georgia/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1231</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1241-42\n(11th Cir. 2000) (although “same decision” defense originating in Mt. Healthy “is permitted in a\nsection 1983 equal protection suit, it obviates completely a defendant’s liability only where a\nplaintiff seeks relief for a prior instance of discrimination”) (citation omitted). That said, we\nexpress no opinion at this time on Green’s entitlement, if any, to prospective relief.\n       18\n           Davis is therefore in an entirely different posture than Green, whose application was\nactually given unequal treatment in the admissions process. As discussed above, that fact is\ncritical to the evaluation of Green’s standing.\n\n                                                42\n\f      We find no support for that strained argument in the Supreme Court’s\n\njurisprudence. Plaintiffs’ position would virtually abolish the injury-in-fact\n\nrequirement in this context, conferring a cognizable injury on every unsuccessful\n\napplicant for a government contract or admission to a public university where the\n\nprocess at some stage or for some purposes disfavors the applicant’s racial group in\n\nfavor of another, regardless of whether the plaintiff herself was actually treated\n\nunequally. The law does not go that far. In Jacksonville, Bakke, and Adarand, the\n\nplaintiffs were exposed to race-conscious criteria at the very first step of the\n\nselection process, either in the form of a fixed, race-based constraint on eligibility\n\nfor the benefit (Jacksonville, Bakke) or a race-based incentive system that\n\nadversely affected their position relative to other candidates seeking the benefit\n\n(Adarand). At no point were the bids or applications of the plaintiffs in those cases\n\neither considered without regard to race or unaffected by race-based limitations.\n\nAccordingly, we cannot draw from these cases the proposition that merely being\n\nexposed to an admissions process which considers race at some but not all stages\n\nnecessarily creates standing for all applicants who would have been ineligible for\n\nspecial treatment had they proceeded to the race-conscious stage of the process.\n\nNor does Lesage even remotely suggest that conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\f      Our decision in Cone further demonstrates the flaws in Davis’s argument.\n\nThat case involved a challenge brought by general contractors who alleged that a\n\ncounty affirmative action plan governing the award and implementation of public\n\nconstruction contracts impermissibly discriminated against non-minority firms.\n\nMost of the specific provisions challenged did not cause the plaintiffs any\n\ncognizable injury. Only one provision in the county’s plan treated minority and\n\nnon-minority general contractors differently; as to that single provision, we\n\nremanded to the district court to consider whether the plaintiffs suffered any injury\n\nas a result of it. 5 F.3d at 1399. Notably, however, we did not suggest that, if the\n\nplaintiffs had standing to challenge the one facially-discriminatory provision, they\n\nwould thereby have standing to challenge the other provisions as well; on the\n\ncontrary, we dismissed the plaintiffs’ challenge to the other provisions for lack of\n\nstanding. Id. at 1398 (affirming the dismissal of “all claims dealing with\n\nprovisions of the affirmative action program which treat minority and non-minority\n\ngeneral contractors alike, because they do not produce competition on an uneven\n\nplaying field”). In short, the plaintiffs could not use their potential exposure to\n\ndiscrimination pursuant to one provision of the county’s plan as a vehicle to assert\n\nstanding for purpose of challenging other aspects of the plan that did not cause\n\nthem cognizable injury.\n\n                                          44\n\f      Davis’s argument is even less compelling than the logic we rejected in Cone.\n\nShe contends that she has standing to challenge UGA’s admissions policy solely\n\nby virtue of the fact that one aspect of the 1996 version of the policy -- the\n\nawarding of bonus points based upon race or ethnicity at the TSI stage -- is race-\n\nconscious. But like the plaintiffs in Cone, Davis cannot challenge provisions of the\n\npolicy which did not cause her cognizable injury. And because the one provision\n\nthat did cause her injury (the AI process) is undisputedly race-neutral, she cannot\n\nprove standing to assert a claim of race discrimination.\n\n      We therefore agree with the district court that a white applicant knocked out\n\nat the first stage of the UGA admissions process based on purely race-neutral\n\ncriteria -- as part of an entirely race-neutral inquiry into objective qualifications --\n\ncannot claim to have been denied an opportunity to compete “on an equal footing”\n\nwith non-white applicants. Davis was not exposed to any unequal treatment, and\n\nher application was never actually disadvantaged because of her race. It follows\n\nthat Davis has failed to prove an injury-in-fact, and therefore necessarily fails to\n\nestablish the other elements of constitutional standing. Accordingly, we conclude\n\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\fthat the district court properly granted summary judgment on standing grounds\n\nwith respect to Plaintiff Davis.19\n\n                                               D.\n\n       For different reasons, the district court also did not err in rejecting Tracy’s\n\nclaim for prospective injunctive relief. Simply because a party prevails on the\n\nmerits of a constitutional claim does not mean that the party is automatically\n\nentitled to prospective injunctive relief. Rather, to have standing to obtain\n\nforward-looking relief, a plaintiff must show a sufficient likelihood that he will be\n\naffected by the allegedly unlawful conduct in the future.20 We discussed this\n\nrequirement and the seminal Supreme Court opinion of City of Los Angeles v.\n\n\n\n       19\n          Contrary to Plaintiffs’ argument, the fact that Green has standing to advance his claim\ndoes not mean that Davis -- who presents a materially distinct claim -- is relieved from her\nburden of proving individual standing.

The possibility that Green or unnamed class members may be able to seek prospective\nrelief, therefore, does not establish Tracy’s standing to seek that relief as well.\n\n                                               46\n\fLyons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110916\"><a href=\"/opinion/110916/los-angeles-v-lyons/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Id. at 97, 103 S. Ct. at 1663. Although he offered no\n      resistance or provocation, the officers applied a chokehold that\n      rendered him unconscious and seriously injured him. Id. at 99, 103 S.\n      Ct. at 1664. Lyons sued for damages and an injunction to bar future\n      police use of chokeholds absent an immediate threat of deadly force.\n      Id. at 98, 103 S.

The Supreme Court\n      reasoned that Lyons’ standing rested on the mere speculation that the\n      police might stop him again and that, if stopped, the arresting officers\n      might apply an unconstitutional chokehold. The Court concluded:\n\n            In order to establish an actual controversy in this case,\n            Lyons would have had not only to allege that he would\n            have another encounter with the police but also to make\n            the incredible assertion either (1) that all police officers\n            in Los Angeles always choke any citizen with whom they\n\n                                         47\n\f             happen to have an encounter, whether for the purpose of\n             arrest, issuing a citation, or for questioning, or (2) that the\n             City ordered or authorized police officers to act in such a\n             manner.\n\n      Id. at 105-06, 103 S. Ct. at 1667. According to the Court, there was no\n      “real and immediate threat” that either of the causes of Lyons’ past\n      injury -- his illegal conduct that led the police to stop his vehicle and\n      the ensuing police conduct -- would recur in the future. Lyons’\n      standing to seek damages for his past injuries, while not questioned by\n      the Court, simply did not establish that he “faced a realistic threat\n      from the future application of the City’s policy.” Id. at 106 n.7, 103 S.\n      Ct. at 1668 n.7.\n\n30 F.3d at 1337 (citations omitted). Invoking that reasoning, this Court has often\n\nemphasized that to obtain prospective injunctive relief a plaintiff must show that he\n\nfaces a substantial likelihood of injury in the future. See, e.g., Bowen, 233 F.3d at\n\n1340 (finding that plaintiff lacked standing to seek prospective injunctive relief\n\nwhere he could not “allege facts from which it appears there is a substantial\n\nlikelihood that he will suffer injury in the future”) (quoting Malowney v.

There is no likelihood, therefore, that he will ever again be exposed to\n\nUGA’s allegedly discriminatory freshman admissions process. As Lyons makes\n\nclear, the fact that others may be exposed to that process in the future is not\n\n                                           48\n\fsufficient for Tracy to obtain prospective relief that will not benefit him in\n\nconjunction with his individual claim.\n\n      Plaintiffs make several counter-arguments, none of which is persuasive.\n\nFirst, they cite case law for the proposition that a plaintiff’s entitlement to\n\ninjunctive relief is measured at the time the complaint is filed. See Robidoux v.\n\nCelani, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601791\"><a href=\"/opinion/601791/julie-robidoux-individually-and-on-behalf-of-all-persons-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 938 (2d Cir. 1993). They contend that at the time the\n\ncomplaint was filed, Tracy had not yet transferred to UGA. As Defendants\n\nobserve, however, the policy by which UGA allegedly discriminated against Tracy\n\nwas the 1990-95 policy, which was not the policy in place at the time Plaintiffs\n\nfiled suit in 1997. The post-1995 policy was not the predicate of Tracy’s\n\nindividual claim in the complaint, and was not likely to affect Tracy at the time he\n\nfiled his complaint. There is, for example, no persuasive evidence that Tracy\n\nintended to re-apply to UGA via the freshman admissions process (on the contrary,\n\nhe sought admission to UGA through a different route -- the transfer process --\n\nsoon after the complaint was filed). Accordingly, Tracy would not have been\n\nentitled to prospective injunctive relief regarding the post-1995 policy at the time\n\nhe filed his complaint. Moreover, any prospective relief we might award with\n\n\n\n\n                                           49\n\frespect to the post-1995 policy would not redress the injury suffered by Tracy as a\n\nresult of the 1990-95 policy.21\n\n       Second, in a related argument, Plaintiffs cite decisions setting forth the\n\nproposition that a defendant’s voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does not\n\nnecessarily render a case moot and thereby deprive a federal court of its power to\n\ndetermine the legality of the practice. See, e.g., Jacksonville, 508 U.S. at 662, 113\n\nS. Ct. at 2301. But while the district court occasionally spoke of this issue in terms\n\nof mootness, the real obstacle here is standing. In other words, the problem is not\n\nthat the Defendants rescinded the unlawful 1990-95 admissions policy after the\n\ncomplaint was filed (thereby creating a potential mootness issue), but rather that\n\nthe original policy had been replaced before Tracy and the other Plaintiffs even\n\n\n\n       21\n         In Robidoux, the Second Circuit explained that “[f]or a plaintiff to have standing to\nrequest injunctive or declaratory relief, the injury alleged must be capable of being redressed\nthrough injunctive relief ‘at that moment.’ The plaintiff may meet this standard by alleging that\nthe defendant was engaging in the unlawful practice against the plaintiff at the time of the\ncomplaint.” 987 F.2d at 938 (citing County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112585\"><a href=\"/opinion/112585/countyof-riverside-v-mclaughlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112585\"><a href=\"/opinion/112585/countyof-riverside-v-mclaughlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Second Circuit described McLaughlin as setting forth an alternative to Lyons\nfor establishing standing to seek prospective relief. 987 F.2d at 938. Plaintiffs here seem to be\ntaking a similar view and arguing for standing under McLaughlin rather than under Lyons.\nMcLaughlin, however, concerned a situation where the plaintiffs were exposed to a continuing\nunconstitutional act -- a protracted delay in affording them probable cause hearings -- which was\nongoing at the time of the complaint but was cured after the filing of the complaint. The\nSupreme Court explained that the alleged violations of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights had\nnot been completed by the time of the complaint, and therefore the requirements set forth in\nLyons did not apply. 500 U.S. at 51, 111 S. Ct. at 1667. In this case, by contrast, the alleged\nviolation of Tracy’s rights -- the denial of his application for admission as a member of UGA’s\nFall 1995 freshman class -- had been completed well before Plaintiffs filed their complaint.\n\n                                               50\n\ffiled suit. Tracy never had standing to challenge the revised policy, and\n\naccordingly we never reach the question of whether Tracy’s challenge to that\n\npolicy eventually became moot.\n\n      Third, Plaintiffs maintain that the post-1995 policy is essentially the same as\n\nthe 1990-95 policy that affected Tracy, and therefore Tracy should be entitled to\n\nseek prospective relief with respect to the revised policy. This reasoning is no\n\nanswer to Tracy’s inability to satisfy the “likely future injury” requirement of\n\nLyons, however. In any event, the post-1995 policy is materially different than its\n\npredecessor. Under the 1996 and 1997 versions of revised policy, race is\n\nconsidered at only one stage of the admissions process, and applicants are not\n\n“dual-tracked” (in the sense of being held to different objective standards) based\n\non their race. Under the prior policy, by contrast, black and non-black applicants\n\nwere treated differently and held to different standards from the very outset of the\n\nevaluation process. “[A] plaintiff who has been subject to injurious conduct of one\n\nkind [does not] possess by virtue of that injury the necessary stake in litigating\n\nconduct of another kind, although similar, to which he has not been subject.”\n\nBlum v.

Moreover,\n\naccording to Plaintiffs, even if an individual plaintiff seems likely to prove a\n\nviolation, UGA can -- as it has in the past -- avoid any risk of far-reaching court-\n\nordered prospective relief with regard to its freshman admissions policy simply by\n\noffering admission to that individual. At least on the record before us, we do not\n\nshare Plaintiffs’ concern. Suffice it to say that there has been no showing that the\n\npool of potential plaintiffs able to challenge UGA’s freshman admissions policy on\n\nthese grounds is drying up. We also are confident that, regardless of any\n\nprospective relief a court might order, UGA would not ignore the import of a\n\ncontrolling federal court decision holding that its freshman admissions policy is\n\nunconstitutional. In any event, as discussed above, Tracy is not in a position to\n\nadvance these concerns as a reason to grant him standing to seek prospective\n\ninjunctive relief because he was not affected by the version of UGA’s freshman\n\nadmissions policy now in place.\n\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\f      Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that Lesage somehow entitles Tracy to\n\nprospective injunctive relief. But there is no indication in Lesage that the Court\n\nintended to alter the well-settled prerequisites to granting such relief. Plaintiffs’\n\nargument appears to be based on the Court’s statement that “[o]f course, a plaintiff\n\nwho challenges an ongoing race-conscious program and seeks forward-looking\n\nrelief need not affirmatively establish that he would receive the benefit in question\n\nif race were not considered.” 528 U.S. at 21, 120 S. Ct. at 468. But Lesage plainly\n\ndoes not hold that a plaintiff may obtain prospective injunctive relief merely by\n\nalleging “an ongoing or imminent constitutional violation,” id., arising out of a\n\npractice that has not injured him to date and is highly unlikely to injure him in the\n\nfuture.\n\n      Nor can Lesage be read to create an exception to Lyons where the\n\ndiscriminatory admissions policy is still in place. If the Supreme Court intended so\n\nsignificant and potentially far-reaching a change in the law of standing, surely it\n\nwould have said so directly, or at least cited Lyons. To reiterate, standing, qua\n\nstanding, was not even an issue in Lesage, and no question of prospective relief\n\narose there because it appeared that the plaintiff had abandoned his claim that the\n\ndefendant university was still administering a discriminatory admissions policy.\n\n528 U.S. at 22, 120 S. Ct. at 469. Tracy, therefore, lacks standing to seek\n\n                                           53\n\fprospective injunctive relief with respect to UGA’s revised freshman admissions\n\npolicy, and the district court correctly declined to grant that relief.\n\n                                                   E.\n\n       Before closing, we address briefly the district court’s denial of class\n\ncertification. The crux of the district court’s ruling was its finding that Tracy -- the\n\nonly Plaintiff with any standing at all in the eyes of the district court -- could not\n\nrepresent a class of persons challenging UGA’s freshman admissions policy.22 The\n\ncourt explained that Tracy’s own claim had become moot by virtue of his\n\nadmission to UGA as a transfer student, and that additionally there were too many\n\nquestions requiring individualized analysis for class treatment to be acceptable.\n\nThe court did not expressly consider whether Green could represent a viable class.\n\nOn appeal, Plaintiffs argue that both Tracy and Green should be permitted to serve\n\n\n\n       22\n            Plaintiffs’ class allegations were sweeping. Plaintiffs purported to represent:\n\n       [A]ll present and future students of any four-year or university-level public\n       institution of higher education in Georgia; parents of minor students of such\n       institutions; applicants for admission at such institutions; parents of minor\n       applicants for admission at such institutions; faculty and administrative\n       employees at such institutions; applicants for faculty and administrative\n       employment at such institutions; and applicants for promotion at such institutions;\n       who have been denied admission, employment, promotion, or monies based on\n       their race, within the two year period preceding the filing of this complaint.\n\nPlaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification, Dec. 1, 1997, at 1. The district court appears to have\nconsidered Plaintiffs’ motion only from the standpoint of whether Tracy could represent a class\nof persons challenging UGA’s freshman admissions policy.\n\n                                                   54\n\fas class representatives, and that the class issue should be revisited with that point\n\nestablished.\n\n       The general principles regarding class certification are well-settled.23\n\nAmong other things, as a prerequisite to certification, it must be established that\n\nthe proposed class representatives have standing to pursue the claims as to which\n\nclasswide relief is sought. The standing requirement is a function not only of\n\nArticle III, but also the requirement in the class action rule -- Fed. R. Civ. P. 23 --\n\nthat the representative’s individual claim be typical of those belonging to the class\n\nmembers he seeks to represent. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) (“the claims or\n\ndefenses of the representative parties [must be] typical of the claims or defenses of\n\nthe class”). As we have explained:\n\n               It should be obvious that there cannot be adequate typicality\n       between a class and a named representative unless the named\n       representative has individual standing to raise the legal claims of the\n       class. . . . [T]ypicality measures whether a sufficient nexus exists\n       between the claims of the named representatives and those of the class\n       at large. Without individual standing to raise a legal claim, a named\n       representative does not have the requisite typicality to raise the same\n       claim on behalf of a class. As the Supreme Court has explained,\n       “[w]e have repeatedly held that a class representative must be part of\n       the class and possess the same interest and suffer the same injury as\n       the class members.” [General Telephone Co. of Southwest v.

Rather, “each claim must be analyzed separately,\n      and a claim cannot be asserted on behalf of a class unless at least one\n      named plaintiff has suffered the injury that gives rise to that claim.”\n\nPrado-Steiman, 221 F.3d at 1280 (citations omitted). Thus, just as a plaintiff\n\ncannot pursue an individual claim unless he proves standing, a plaintiff cannot\n\nrepresent a class unless he has standing to raise the claims of the class he seeks to\n\nrepresent.\n\n      For the reasons discussed above, the district court did not err by concluding\n\nthat Tracy lacks standing to pursue forward-looking relief with respect to UGA’s\n\n\n\n                                          56\n\frevised freshman admissions policy.

A district court abuses its\n\ndiscretion when it denies class certification based on an incorrect legal premise.\n\nSee, e.g., Prado-Steiman, 221 F.3d at 1275 n.9 (citing SunAmerica Corp. v.

The district court, of course, may well conclude that some or all of\nits earlier concerns still exist even with Green as the proposed class representative.\n\n                                                 57\n\f      We note, however, that the district court is not required to resolve Green’s\n\nclass certification request before resolving a challenge to Green’s individual claim.\n\nIf the district court were to resolve a summary judgment motion in Defendants’\n\nfavor and in so doing dismiss Green’s individual claim before ruling on class\n\ncertification, then Green would not be an appropriate class representative. Again,\n\nhowever, we leave those matters to the district court. We simply hold that the\n\ndistrict court’s denial of class certification must be vacated to the extent it was\n\npremised on the incorrect assumption that Green lacked standing to pursue a claim\n\nindividually.\n\n                                           V.\n\n      In summary, we dismiss the appeals of Wooden, Jarvis and Bratcher, and\n\naffirm the district court’s dismissal for lack of standing of the claims brought by\n\nDavis and Tracy. We reverse the district court’s order entering summary judgment\n\non Green’s claim for lack of standing, and vacate the denial of class certification to\n\nthe extent it was based on the mistaken premise that Green wholly lacked standing.\n\nThe case is remanded to the district court for further proceedings regarding Green’s\n\nclaim consistent with this opinion.\n\n    APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART, AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED\nAND VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n                                           58\n\f</pre>",
