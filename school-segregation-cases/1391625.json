Taylor, Judge. Affirmed.\n\n\n\n        Gatzke Dillon & Ballance, Mark J. Dillon, Stephen F. Tee and Stephen A. Sunseri,\n\nfor Plaintiffs and Appellants.\n\n        Caldarelli Hejmanowski & Page and Marisa Janine-Page, for Defendant and\n\nRespondent.\n\n\n*       Pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 8.1105(b) and 8.1110, this opinion is\ncertified for publication with the exception of parts I and III.\n\f                                    INTRODUCTION\n\n       The primary issue in this appeal is whether, after a voluntary dismissal of a\n\npetition for writ of mandate, the trial court erred by allowing the County of San Diego\n\n(the County) to recover actual labor costs incurred for an attorney and paralegals to\n\nprepare an administrative record. Finding no error, we affirm the order and judgment.\n\n       Preliminarily, however, we dismiss the appeals of The Otay Ranch, L.P. (Otay\n\nRanch), a cancelled limited partnership, and Sky Communities, Inc. (Sky Communities),\n\na suspended corporation, for lack of capacity. We deny the motion to dismiss the appeal\n\nof the remaining appellant, Sky Vista, Inc. (Sky Vista), which is an active corporation.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n                                             A\n\n       The County approved a \"Remedial Action Plan\" (RAP) for a remediation project\n\nat the former Otay Skeet and Trap Shooting Range (Project) in Chula Vista, California,\n\nand adopted a \"Final Mitigated Negative Declaration\" (MND) on September 12, 2012.\n\nThe Project involved \"investigation and remediation of surface and subsurface areas\n\nimpacted from historic shooting range activities\" and included \"remediation of soil\n\nimpacted by lead and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), removal of 'White\n\nMaterial['], as well as the removal of target debris and wood debris from the site.\"\n\n       The Otay Ranch, Sky Communities, and Sky Vista (collectively, Otay Ranch\n\nparties) are the former owners of the shooting range. They filed a petition for writ of\n\nmandate in October 2012 alleging the County (1) did not comply with the requirements\n\nof the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21000\n\n                                             2\n\fet seq.) when it approved and adopted the MND and RAP without preparing an\n\nenvironmental impact report and (2) did not comply with Health and Safety Code\n\nsection 25356.1 in approving the RAP. The Otay Ranch parties also sought declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief. Real party in interest, Flat Rock Land Company, LLC (Flat Rock),\n\nis the current owner of the shooting range property and project applicant, which is\n\nundertaking voluntary remediation of the site before future development.\n\n                                              B\n\n       The Otay Ranch parties elected to prepare the record of the proceedings, subject to\n\ncertification of accuracy by the County. (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21167.6, subd. (b)(2).)\n\nAfter the court denied the Otay Ranch parties' application for a temporary restraining\n\norder to halt the remediation work, the parties stipulated to extend the deadline for\n\npreparation and certification of the administrative record to the end of January 2013. The\n\ncourt set a briefing schedule and ordered a hearing date for July 12, 2013.\n\n       In January, the parties stipulated again to extend the deadline for certification of\n\nthe record of proceedings to February 8, 2013, and later agreed to a further informal\n\nextension. The parties met on February 7, 2013, to discuss the proposed CEQA record.\n\nAccording to counsel for the County, over half of the documents listed in the proposed\n\nindex were documents not properly part of the CEQA record and the index omitted\n\nhundreds of documents that were part of the CEQA record. After this meeting, the Otay\n\nRanch parties voluntarily dismissed the CEQA cause of action.\n\n       The Otay Ranch parties filed an amended petition in April 2013 alleging a cause\n\nof action for lack of compliance with the Health and Safety Code and a request for\n\n                                              3\n\fdeclaratory relief. The Otay Ranch parties did not file the administrative record with the\n\namended petition or indicate when the administrative record would be filed.\n\n       On April 25, 2013, the court denied Otay Ranch's request for an order shortening\n\ntime to hear a motion to stay the briefing and hearing in this case pending the outcome of\n\nthe trial in another case involving environmental clean-up of the shooting range.1 During\n\nthe ex parte hearing, the court inquired about the status of the administrative record.\n\nSince the Otay Ranch parties had not prepared the record, counsel for the County stated\n\nthe County would undertake preparation of the administrative record and would file it\n\nwith its answer, which was due within 10 days. The Otay Ranch parties did not object to\n\nthe County preparing the record nor did it challenge the County's assertion the Otay\n\nRanch parties would be obligated to pay the costs of preparing the record.\n\n                                              C\n\n       Because the County department responsible for maintaining the files associated\n\nwith the project did not have the manpower or resources to prepare the administrative\n\nrecord, it asked the outside law firm representing it in the litigation to prepare the record.\n\nCounsel for the County worked with James G. Clay, the County staff member most\n\nknowledgeable regarding the project, to gather and electronically reproduce the pertinent\n\nportions of the administrative record. Although the County maintained the project files in\n\n\n1      This is one of several cases pending in the San Diego Superior Court concerning\nthe environmental cleanup of the former shooting range. (Otay Land Company, et al. v.\nU.E. Limited, L.P. et al. (2006, No. GIC 869480); Otay Land Company, et al. v. U.E.\nLimited, et al. (2009, 37-2009-00101976-CU-OR-CTL); Otay Land Company, et al. v.\nU.E. limited, et al. (2012, 37-2012-00104941-CU-BT-CTL).)\n\n                                              4\n\fa manner allowing the County to perform its responsibilities on the case over the previous\n\ndecade, parts of the file were segregated, duplicated and disseminated to various staff,\n\ndivisions and departments.\n\n       Counsel for the County initially tasked preparation of the administrative record to\n\nexperienced paralegals, document clerks and an electronic record vendor. However, as\n\nthe work unfolded, it became necessary for the attorney to become actively involved in\n\nreviewing and organizing the record. Given the technical complexity of the documents,\n\nthe scope of the record and the manner in which the documents were maintained, the\n\nattorney hired by the County was the only person who understood the interplay of the\n\nvarious versions of the documents as well as which documents should be included in the\n\nadministrative record and which should not. According to Mr. Clay, the work required\n\nsomeone with specific knowledge and a comprehensive understanding of the project over\n\nthe previous decade to reassemble various documents and technical reports with\n\nsupporting documentation to prepare an adequate administrative record, but the County\n\ndid not have adequate staffing to undertake this effort.\n\n       The attorney and the paralegals worked extended hours and through the weekend\n\nto prepare the record. The County filed and served the administrative record on May 8,\n\n2013, consisting of 326 documents totaling more than 18,000 pages. The following day,\n\nMay 9, 2013, the Otay Ranch parties dismissed the entire action.\n\n                                             D\n\n       The County submitted a memorandum of costs seeking recovery of $66,638.14 for\n\npreparation of the administrative record. The Otay Ranch parties moved to tax the\n\n                                             5\n\fCounty's cost, requesting the court disallow $59,545 for attorney and paralegal time\n\nincurred to prepare the administrative record. The Otay Ranch parties argued, as they do\n\non appeal, attorney fees should not be included in a cost award for preparation of the\n\nadministrative record because attorney fees are not authorized in this action by contract,\n\nstatute or law. The Otay Ranch parties did not object to $7,093.14 in record preparation\n\ncosts for time spent by law firm document clerks and county staff or to costs associated\n\nwith producing the electronic record through an outside vendor.\n\n       The County opposed the motion arguing the \"labor costs of 'persons with\n\nspecialized knowledge,' are recoverable when they are reasonably necessary\" to prepare\n\nan administrative record. The County presented declarations from Mr. Clay, defense\n\ncounsel and a paralegal explaining the process of assembling the administrative record\n\nand why it was reasonably necessary to expend attorney and paralegal time to prepare the\n\nadministrative record. The County also submitted supporting billing statements.\n\n       Noting the Otay Ranch parties failed to prepare the administrative record in the six\n\nmonths since the action was filed, the trial court ruled the Otay Ranch parties were\n\nresponsible for the costs of preparing the record. The court ruled a recoverable cost\n\nincurred in preparing the record \"must include the labors of the County\" in preparing the\n\nrecord. Relying on this court's holding in River Valley Preservation Project v.\n\nMetropolitan Transit Development Bd. (1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 154, 181 (River Valley)\n\nthat labor costs incurred for preparing an administrative record are allowable if\n\n\"necessarily incurred and reasonable,\" including labor for \"persons with specialized\n\nknowledge,\" (ibid.), the trial court ruled \"it was reasonably necessary\" for the County's\n\n                                             6\n\fattorney and her paralegals to prepare the administrative record since the County \"did not\n\nhave the resources or experienced personnel\" to prepare the record.\n\n       The court allowed the County to recover only attorney and paralegal time\n\nexpended after the County decided to prepare the record on April 25, 2013, and\n\ndisallowed requested time prior to that date. Therefore, the court awarded $37,528.14 in\n\ncosts for preparation of the administrative record, which included $30,435 in labor costs\n\nfor the County's attorney and paralegals (74.1 attorney hours at $350 per hour and 67.1\n\nparalegal hours at $100 per hour) plus $7,093.14 in unchallenged costs. The court\n\ndisregarded as untimely new evidence submitted in reply regarding an indemnity\n\nagreement between the County and Flat Rock.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n                                             I\n\n                                    Motion to Dismiss\n\n       Before reaching the merits of the appeal, we deal first with the County's motion to\n\ndismiss, which contends: (1) Otay Ranch lacks capacity to bring the appeal because it is\n\na cancelled limited partnership; (2) Sky Communities lacks capacity to bring the appeal\n\nbecause it is a suspended corporation; and (3) Sky Vista should be dismissed because the\n\nthree businesses are so intertwined dismissal of the entire appeal is necessary to prevent\n\nOtay Ranch and Sky Communities from indirectly benefitting from the appeal. We\n\ndismiss the appeal as to Otay Ranch and Sky Communities, but decline to dismiss as to\n\nSky Vista.\n\n\n\n                                             7\n\f                                              A\n\n                                         Otay Ranch\n\n       In response to our request for supplemental briefing regarding the impact of Otay\n\nRanch's filing of a certificate of cancellation of its limited partnership, Otay Ranch\n\nargued, \"a corporation's dissolution is best understood not as its death, but merely as its\n\nretirement from active business.\" (Penasquitos, Inc. v. Superior Court (1991) 53 Cal.3d\n\n1180, 1190.) Relying on a statute applicable to corporations it also argued, \" '[n]o action\n\nor proceeding to which a corporation is a party abates by the dissolution of the\n\ncorporation or by reason of proceedings for winding up.' \" (Corp. Code, ยง 2010,\n\nsubd. (b).)\n\n       We agree a \"limited partnership continues after dissolution only for the purpose of\n\nwinding up its activities.\" (Corp. Code, ยง 15908.03, subd. (a).) In the process of winding\n\nup its activities, a dissolved limited partnership \"(1) may amend its certificate of limited\n\npartnership to state that the limited partnership is dissolved, preserve the limited\n\npartnership business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time, prosecute and\n\ndefend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, transfer the\n\nlimited partnership's property, settle disputes by mediation or arbitration, file a certificate\n\nof cancellation as provided in [Corporations Code] Section 15902.03, and perform other\n\nnecessary acts; and (2) shall discharge the limited partnership's liabilities, settle and close\n\nthe limited partnership's activities, and marshal and distribute the assets of the\n\npartnership.\" (Corp. Code, ยง 15908.03, subd. (b).)\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\f       However, Corporations Code section 15902.03 provides, \"[a] dissolved limited\n\npartnership that has completed winding up shall deliver to and on a form prescribed by\n\nthe Secretary of State for filing a certificate of cancellation . . . .\" (Italics added.) A\n\ncertificate of cancellation gives constructive notice of the termination of the limited\n\npartnership. (Corp. Code, ยง 15901.03, subd. (d)(3).) \"That notice effectively terminates\n\nany apparent authority to bind the limited partnership.\" (U. Limited Partnership Act\n\nCom. com., 24A West's Ann. Corp. Code (2014 ed.) foll. ยง 15902.03, p. 266.)\n\n       Here, Otay Ranch filed a certificate of cancellation on December 24, 2012, in\n\nwhich the general partners executed a statement of cancellation under penalty of perjury\n\nstating, \"the above-named California limited partnership has completed winding up its\n\naffairs and is cancelled.\" (Some capitalization omitted, italics added.) The Certificate of\n\nStatus from the California Secretary of State certifies, \"[t]he records of this office\n\nindicate [Otay Ranch] filed a Certificate of Cancellation on December 24, 2012, and the\n\nentity's powers, rights and privileges have ceased.\" Applying the plain meaning of the\n\nstatutes (In re C.H. (2011) 53 Cal.4th 94, 101), and taking Otay Ranch's general partners\n\nat their word that the limited partnership completed winding up its affairs as of the filing\n\nof the certificate of cancellation on December 24, 2012, we conclude Otay Ranch's\n\ncurrent appeal cannot be deemed part of the winding up process. As a result, we dismiss\n\nthe appeal of Otay Ranch.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f                                               B\n\n                                      Sky Communities\n\n       \"[A] 'corporation may not prosecute or defend an action, nor appeal from an\n\nadverse judgment in an action while its corporate rights are suspended for failure to pay\n\ntaxes.' \" (Bourhis v. Lord (2013) 56 Cal.4th 320, 324 (Bourhis).) However, \"[a]\n\ncorporation whose powers have been suspended may apply with the Franchise Tax Board\n\nfor reinstatement after satisfying its obligations. ([Rev. & Tax. Code,] ยง 23305.) If the\n\nstatutory requirements are met, the Franchise Tax Board issues a 'certificate of revivor.'\n\n([Rev. & Tax. Code,] ยง 23305.) 'Upon the issuance of the certificate [of revivor] by the\n\nFranchise Tax Board the taxpayer therein named shall become reinstated . . . .' ([Rev. &\n\nTax. Code,] ยง 23305a.)\" (Bourhis, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 324.)\n\n       The California Franchise Tax Board suspended the powers, rights and privileges\n\nof Sky Communities on September 3, 2013, after the voluntary dismissal of the petition\n\nbut before the entry of the cost order at issue in this appeal. In the certificate of interested\n\nentities or persons submitted with the opening brief, counsel for appellants stated, \"while\n\n[Sky Communities], is currently a suspended corporation, it may be reinstated.\" Counsel\n\nfurther stated, \"[Sky Communities], is taking steps to be reinstated.\"\n\n       In opposition to the motion to dismiss, appellants argued extensively the appeal\n\nshould not be dismissed based on Bourhis, supra, 56 Cal.4th 320, in which the Supreme\n\nCourt held a suspended corporation may proceed with an appeal filed during its\n\nsuspension because subsequent revival of the corporate status retroactively validates an\n\nearlier notice of appeal. (Id. at p. 323.) They also argued a notice of appeal filed while a\n\n                                              10\n\fcorporation is suspended is merely a procedural defect, not a substantive defect affecting\n\njurisdiction and dismissals based on lack of capacity are disfavored.\n\n       Bourhis is not applicable. In response to our request for an update regarding the\n\nstatus of the suspension, Sky Communities informed us the Franchise Tax Board has not\n\nyet issued a certificate of revivor. Therefore, as a currently suspended company, Sky\n\nCommunities is disqualified from exercising any right, power or privilege and, therefore,\n\nlacks the capacity to pursue this appeal. (Rev. & Tax. Code ยง 23301; Bourhis, supra, 56\n\nCal.4th at p. 324; Laurel Crest, Inc. v. Vaughn (1969) 272 Cal.App.2d 363, 364 (Laurel\n\nCrest) [an appeal of a suspended corporation should be dismissed under the law where\n\nthere was no reinstatement]; see Cal-Western Business Services, Inc. v. Corning Capital\n\nGroup (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 304, 310, 312 [assignee of a judgment lacked capacity to\n\nenforce the judgment because the assignor's corporate powers were suspended at the time\n\nof assignment and were not revived].) Accordingly, on the record before us, we dismiss\n\nthe appeal of Sky Communities.\n\n                                             C\n\n                                         Sky Vista\n\n       Sky Vista is an active California corporation. The County argues the three entities\n\nare so intertwined dismissal of Sky Vista, Inc.'s appeal is necessary to prevent Otay\n\nRanch and Sky Communities \"from gaining indirectly any advantage of this appeal.\"\n\n       The County cites Laurel Crest, supra, 272 Cal.App.2d at p. 365 for the proposition\n\ncorporate appellants may be prevented from prosecuting an appeal where an adequate\n\nshowing is made a dismissed entity would gain an improper advantage of an appeal based\n\n                                            11\n\fon the relationship between the dismissed entity and the remaining entity or entities. No\n\nsuch showing was made in Laurel Crest even though the complaint in that case alleged\n\nthe entities were joint venturers. Recognizing \" '[t]he \"right of appeal is remedial, and in\n\ndoubtful cases the doubt should be resolved in favor of the right whenever the substantial\n\ninterests of a party are affected by a judgment,\" ' \" the Laurel Crest court allowed the\n\nnon-suspended entities to pursue their appeal. (Ibid.)\n\n       Similarly here, the County has not made an adequate showing to dismiss Sky\n\nVista's appeal. Sky Vista was a general partner in Otay Ranch and counsel for the Otay\n\nRanch parties represented to the trial court in another case Sky Vista's sole role was to\n\nserve as a partner in Otay Ranch. However, the operative petition for writ of mandate in\n\nthis case alleges Sky Vista was one of three petitioners that had been or would be\n\n\"directly and adversely affected by the Project as approved by the County\" and it had a\n\ndirect and beneficial interest in requesting compliance with the Health and Safety Code.\n\nThe County cited no authority compelling the conclusion the business relationship\n\nbetween Sky Vista and the other entities legally requires dismissal of this appeal.\n\nTherefore, we deny the motion to dismiss as to Sky Vista.\n\n                                             II\n\n                 Cost for Preparing Administrative Record May Include\n                             Attorney and Paralegal Labor\n\n       Sky Vista contends the trial court abused its discretion in this case by including\n\ncompensation for the time the County's retained counsel and paralegals spent to prepare\n\nthe administrative record. It argues this amounts to an award of attorney fees, which are\n\n\n                                             12\n\fnot expressly authorized by contract, statute or law. The County contends the trial court\n\nproperly exercised its discretion to allow recovery of attorney and paralegal time after\n\ndetermining the time was reasonable and necessary for preparation of the administrative\n\nrecord. We agree with the County.\n\n                                              A\n\n       The costs to prepare the administrative record for an administrative mandamus\n\naction are recoverable. Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (a), provides\n\n\"[e]xcept where otherwise prescribed by statute, the cost of preparing the record shall be\n\nborne by the petitioner\" and \"[i]f the expense of preparing all or any part of the record has\n\nbeen borne by the prevailing party, the expense shall be taxable as costs.\" Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 1094.6, subdivision (c), specifies the contents of the administrative\n\nrecord and reiterates the petitioner must bear the cost of preparing the record stating, in\n\nrelevant part, \"[t]he local agency may recover from the petitioner its actual costs for\n\ntranscribing or otherwise preparing the record.\"\n\n       In petitions alleging CEQA violations, Public Resources Code section 21167.6,\n\nsubdivision (b)(1), requires payment of \"any reasonable costs or fees imposed for the\n\npreparation of the record of proceedings in conformance with any law or rule of court.\"2\n\nThe plaintiff or petitioner may elect to prepare the record in a CEQA case or to agree to\n\nan alternative method of preparing the record, subject to certification of accuracy by the\n\n\n2      The word \"reasonable\" was added to subdivision (b)(1) of Public Resources Code\nsection 21167.6 in 2002. (See Historical and Statutory Notes, 56B West's Ann. Pub.\nResources Code (2007 ed.) foll. ยง 21167.6, p. 194; Stats. 2002, ch. 1121, ยง 4 (SB 1393).)\n\n                                             13\n\fpublic agency. (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21167.6, subd. (b)(2).) We construe similar\n\nstatutes in light of one another. (Ziesmer v. Superior Court (2003) 107 Cal.App.4th 360,\n\n366.)\n\n        The County asserts Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6 requires an award of\n\nits \"actual costs\" without a determination of reasonableness or necessity. However, the\n\nCounty did not cross-appeal and does not ask us to decide this point because it contends\n\nwhere, as here, a public agency prepares the administrative record and is the prevailing\n\nparty, it is entitled to costs the trial court finds to be \"reasonably necessary\" and\n\n\"reasonable in amount\" to prepare the administrative record. (Code Civ. Proc.,\n\nยงยง 1033.5, subd. (c)(1)-(4), 1094.5; see Marlow v. Orange County Human Services\n\nAgency (1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 290, 294-295 [trial court properly exercised its discretion\n\nin determining cost of a hearing transcript sought under Code Civ. Proc., ยง 1094.5 was\n\nreasonable and necessary].)3\n\n        \"Whether a particular cost to prepare an administrative record was necessary and\n\nreasonable is an issue for the sound discretion of the trial court. [Citations.] Discretion is\n\nabused only when, in its exercise, the court 'exceeds the bounds of reason, all of the\n\ncircumstances being considered.' [Citation.] The appellant has the burden of establishing\n\n\n\n3       Code of Civil Procedure section 1033.5, subdivision (c) provides:\n\"Any award of costs shall be subject to the following: [ยถ] (1) Costs are allowable if\nincurred, whether or not paid. [ยถ] (2) Allowable costs shall be reasonably necessary to\nthe conduct of the litigation rather than merely convenient or beneficial to its preparation.\n[ยถ] (3) Allowable costs shall be reasonable in amount. [ยถ] (4) Items not mentioned in this\nsection and items assessed upon application may be allowed or denied in the court's\ndiscretion.\" (Italics added.)\n                                              14\n\fan abuse of discretion.\" (River Valley, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at p. 181.) Where \"the\n\ndetermination of whether costs should be awarded is an issue of law on undisputed facts,\n\nwe exercise de novo review.\" (City of Long Beach v. Stevedoring Services of America\n\n(2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 672, 678.)\n\n                                             B\n\n       Courts have long recognized the labor costs incurred to prepare an administrative\n\nrecord are recoverable items of costs. In Citizens for Quality Growth v. City of Mt.\n\nShasta (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 433, the City presented evidence it did not have sufficient\n\nemployees to prepare the record within the time required so it obtained assistance from a\n\nparalegal and a clerk from a private law firm to organize and index the documents. The\n\ntrial court found the cost of preparation was necessarily incurred, but the appellate court\n\nreversed and remanded for the court to make a determination about whether the amount\n\nwas reasonable. (Id. at pp. 447-448.)\n\n       In River Valley, we affirmed an order allowing recovery of labor costs for an\n\nengineer and a paralegal employed by the agency to collect and index an administrative\n\nrecord. (River Valley, supra, 37 Cal.App.4th at pp. 180-183.) We noted the \"history and\n\ncomplexity\" of that case \"required a complete, organized and adequately indexed\n\nadministrative record for the court's proper review, necessitating the expense of physical\n\nand organizational skills to accomplish this result.\" Under the circumstances, we\n\nconcluded the trial court acted within its discretion when it found \"it was reasonably\n\nnecessary for persons with specialized knowledge\" to prepare the administrative record.\n\n(Id. at p. 181.) We held a commonsense reading of the CEQA cost recovery statute\n\n                                             15\n\frequired costs for preparation of the administrative record to include time spent to\n\nprepare the record. Otherwise, it would defeat the statutory purpose by shifting the\n\nfinancial burden to the public agency. \"[T]axpayers . . . should not have to bear the cost\n\nof preparing the administrative record in a lawsuit brought by a private individual or\n\nentity.\" (Id. at p. 182.)\n\n       In St. Vincent's School for Boys, Catholic Charities CYO v. City of San Rafael\n\n(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 989, 1013, 1019, the appellate court affirmed an order awarding\n\ninformation technology fees and staff labor the City incurred to respond to petitioner's\n\ndiscovery demands to retrieve electronic data. The trial court did not award costs related\n\nto attorney efforts in preparing the record, but there was no challenge to the trial court's\n\ndecision in that regard. (Id. at p. 1013.) In affirming the order, the court stated \"where\n\nnecessary to preserve the statutory purposes of cost containment and expediting CEQA\n\nlitigation, the prevailing party in a CEQA action may recover 'reasonable costs or fees\n\nimposed for the preparation' [citation] of the record, even if the nonprevailing party\n\nelected to prepare the record.\" (Id. at p. 1019.)\n\n       More recently, in California Oak Foundation v. Regents of University of\n\nCalifornia (2010) 188 Cal.App.4th 227 (California Oak), the appellate court affirmed an\n\norder including labor time for a paralegal and other University staff in an award of costs\n\nfor preparation of an administrative record. (Id. at pp. 294-295.) The court noted the\n\nparalegal assembled and indexed the documents in the record and counsel for the\n\n\n\n\n                                              16\n\fUniversity spent additional time reviewing and revising portions of the record.4 Given\n\nthe history and complex nature of the proceedings, the appellate court did not find it\n\nsurprising \"the University spent a great deal of time and expense ensuring the entire\n\nadministrative record was prepared and copied in an appropriate manner.\" (Id. at p. 295.)\n\nThe appellate court could not say \"the trial court exceeded the bounds of reason in\n\naccepting as reasonable the hours and rates claimed by the University for performing\n\nthese necessary tasks.\" (Ibid.)\n\n       The California Oak court distinguished Hayward Area Planning Assn. v. City of\n\nHayward (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 176, 184-185 (Hayward), which disallowed recovery\n\nof record preparation costs sought under the CEQA statute where the agency delegated\n\nthe task to a third party interested in the litigation. In Hayward, the court observed courts\n\nhave allowed public agencies to collect the labor costs of outside assistance when\n\npreparing an administrative record, including the use of a private law firm, but no court\n\n\"condoned the unilateral delegation of the task to a party with an interest in the\n\nlitigation.\" (Hayward, supra, at p. 184.) The California Oak court did not find Hayward\n\ncontrolling because the University prepared the record itself and did not improperly\n\ndelegate record preparation to a third party. (California Oak, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th\n\nat p. 295.)\n\n       Similarly here, the County did not delegate preparation of the record to a third\n\nparty. The County undertook preparation of the administrative record after months of\n\n\n4       It is not clear from the court's discussion of the facts if attorney time was included\nin the cost award.\n                                              17\n\finaction on the part of the Otay Ranch parties, who initially elected to prepare the\n\nadministrative record for their CEQA claim. Given the history and complexity of the\n\nproject and how the documents were maintained, we cannot conclude the trial court\n\nexceeded the bounds of reason in determining it was \"reasonably necessary\" for the\n\nCounty's retained counsel and paralegals to prepare the administrative record since the\n\nCounty \"did not have the resources or experienced personnel to prepare the [r]ecord.\"\n\n       Sky Vista does not challenge the labor costs charged for County staff or law firm\n\ndocument clerks to assist with preparation of the administrative record. It challenges\n\nonly the labor costs incurred for an attorney and paralegals to prepare the record by\n\narguing these costs constitute attorney fees. Under Sky Vista's analysis an attorney's\n\nlabor for preparation of an administrative record could never be recovered, even if the\n\nhourly amount charged was de minimus.\n\n       Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1094.6 require a petitioner to pay\n\n\"actual costs\" and expenses of preparing the administrative record. Under the particular\n\ncircumstances of this case where the trial court found it was reasonably necessary for the\n\nCounty to incur attorney and paralegal labor costs to prepare the administrative record\n\nwithin a short window of time, we see no reason to differentiate between those actual\n\nlabor costs and actual labor costs for agency staff and document clerks to prepare an\n\nadministrative record. Nor do we see a reason to differentiate between labor costs\n\nincurred by individuals directly employed by a public agency and those incurred by\n\nindividuals employed by a private law firm retained by the agency, so long as the trial\n\ncourt determines, as it did here, the labor costs were reasonably and necessarily incurred\n\n                                             18\n\ffor preparation of the administrative record. To hold otherwise would undermine the\n\nstatutory policy of shifting the costs and expenses of preparing an administrative record\n\naway from the public and to the private individual or entity bringing the lawsuit. (Code\n\nCiv. Proc., ยงยง 1094.5, subd. (a), 1094.6, subd. (c); see River Valley, supra,\n\n37 Cal.App.4th at p. 182.)\n\n       We are not persuaded by Sky Vista's citation to Dep't of Forestry & Fire Prot. v.\n\nLebrock (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 1137. In that case, the court did not allow a prevailing\n\nparty to recover attorney fees in an action filed against her by the California Department\n\nof Forestry to recover the costs of suppressing a fire originating on her property. (Id.\n\nat pp. 1138, 1140.) After analyzing the pertinent Health and Safety Code provisions, the\n\ncourt concluded the statutes delineated recovery for \"the costs of suppressing the fire,\n\nproviding rescue or emergency services, investigation, making reports, and costs relating\n\nto accounting for the fire and collection of the suppression and rescue costs,\" but did not\n\nmention attorney fees for enforcing or defending an action to recover such costs.\n\n(Id. at pp. 1140-1141.) Here, Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6, subdivision (c),\n\nprovides for recovery of the \"actual costs for transcribing or otherwise preparing the\n\nrecord.\" It does not delineate or limit those costs to certain categories. Nor is the County\n\nseeking to recover attorney fees for enforcing or defending an action. It is simply seeking\n\nto recover the costs it actually incurred to prepare the record.\n\n       Sky Vista's citation to Science Applications Internat. Corp. v. Superior Court\n\n(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1095 (SAIC) is also inapposite. In a prior appeal in that case, we\n\nreversed an attorney fee award concluding the contract language at issue did not permit\n\n                                              19\n\frecovery of attorney fees. We remanded to consider whether items the trial court\n\nawarded for \"litigation expenses\" amounted to attorney fees, which would be disallowed\n\nunder the terms of the contract, or as otherwise recoverable costs under Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 1033.5. (SAIC, supra, at p. 1099.) On a petition for writ of mandate\n\nchallenging the new award of costs, we concluded the costs of hiring a \"high tech\"\n\nparalegal to organize documents and access them in discovery and trial were not\n\nrecoverable under the terms of the contract at issue in that case for the same reason we\n\ndisallowed recovery of attorney fees. (Id. at p. 1104.) SAIC did not involve costs and\n\nexpenses associated with preparation of an administrative record and it has no application\n\nto the facts before us.\n\n                                            C\n\n       The Otay Ranch parties did not challenge below the reasonableness of the hourly\n\nrates charged for the attorney and the paralegals for record preparation, which were\n\ndiscounted from their regular rates to $350 and $100 per hour, respectively. Sky Vista\n\nmakes no such challenge on appeal. However, the trial court undertook its own\n\nassessment of the reasonableness of those rates. It took into account the nature and\n\ncomplexity of the case, the results obtained, the amount of work involved, the skill\n\nrequired and the time consumed as well as the court's own knowledge and experience\n\nwith the rates charged in the community for similar work and concluded the \"rates\n\ncharged are at the low end of what the court would consider reasonable given the\n\nexperience of counsel.\" The court did limit the amount awarded to only those hours\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\freflecting labor after the date on which the County affirmatively elected to prepare the\n\nadministrative record. We find no abuse of discretion in this regard.\n\n                                               III\n\n                                 Evidence Submitted in Reply\n\n       Sky Vista contends the trial court abused its discretion in disregarding evidence it\n\nsubmitted with its reply brief regarding an indemnity agreement between the County and\n\nreal party in interest Flat Rock. Sky Vista claims it was unaware of the indemnity\n\nagreement until the County submitted its bills in response to the motion to tax costs and\n\nthese bills showed they were sent to both the County and to Flat Rock. Their counsel\n\nthen reviewed the administrative record served in this case before the dismissal and\n\ndiscovered the indemnity agreement. Sky Vista submitted the indemnity agreement to\n\nthe court with its reply brief. At the hearing, counsel for the County explained the\n\nagreement and copies of billing invoices had been produced in a related case months\n\nbefore Sky Vista filed its motion to tax. The trial court disregarded the evidence\n\nsubmitted with the reply brief, including the indemnification agreement.\n\n       \"The general rule of motion practice . . . is that new evidence is not permitted with\n\nreply papers. . . . '[T]he inclusion of additional evidentiary matter with the reply should\n\nonly be allowed in the exceptional case . . . ' and if permitted, the other party should be\n\ngiven the opportunity to respond.\" (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) 218 Cal. App. 4th 1522,\n\n1537-1538.) \"This rule is based on the same solid logic applied in the appellate courts,\n\nspecifically, that '[p]oints raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be\n\n\n\n                                               21\n\fconsidered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity\n\nto counter the argument.' \" (Id. at p. 1538.)\n\n       We cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in disregarding the\n\nevidence and argument regarding the indemnification agreement because it was raised for\n\nthe first time in reply. Although the trial court has discretion to admit new evidence or\n\nargument on reply under certain circumstances, it was not an abuse of discretion to\n\ndecline to do so based on the facts presented in this case. (Jay v. Mahaffey, supra,\n\n218 Cal.App.4th at p. 1538.)\n\n                                         DISPOSITION\n\n       The appeals of Otay Ranch and Sky Communities are dismissed. The order and\n\njudgment awarding costs for preparation of the administrative record is affirmed. The\n\nCounty is entitled to costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                       MCCONNELL, P.

Finding no error, we affirm the order and judgment.\n\n       Preliminarily, however, we dismiss the appeals of The Otay Ranch, L.P. (Otay\n\nRanch), a cancelled limited partnership, and Sky Communities, Inc. (Sky Communities),\n\na suspended corporation, for lack of capacity. We deny the motion to dismiss the appeal\n\nof the remaining appellant, Sky Vista, Inc. (Sky Vista), which is an active corporation.\n\n                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n                                             A\n\n       The County approved a \"Remedial Action Plan\" (RAP) for a remediation project\n\nat the former Otay Skeet and Trap Shooting Range (Project) in Chula Vista, California,\n\nand adopted a \"Final Mitigated Negative Declaration\" (MND) on September 12, 2012.\n\nThe Project involved \"investigation and remediation of surface and subsurface areas\n\nimpacted from historic shooting range activities\" and included \"remediation of soil\n\nimpacted by lead and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), removal of 'White\n\nMaterial['], as well as the removal of target debris and wood debris from the site.\"\n\n       The Otay Ranch, Sky Communities, and Sky Vista (collectively, Otay Ranch\n\nparties) are the former owners of the shooting range. They filed a petition for writ of\n\nmandate in October 2012 alleging the County (1) did not comply with the requirements\n\nof the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21000\n\n                                             2\n\fet seq.) when it approved and adopted the MND and RAP without preparing an\n\nenvironmental impact report and (2) did not comply with Health and Safety Code\n\nsection 25356.1 in approving the RAP. The Otay Ranch parties also sought declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief. Real party in interest, Flat Rock Land Company, LLC (Flat Rock),\n\nis the current owner of the shooting range property and project applicant, which is\n\nundertaking voluntary remediation of the site before future development.\n\n                                              B\n\n       The Otay Ranch parties elected to prepare the record of the proceedings, subject to\n\ncertification of accuracy by the County. (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21167.6, subd. (b)(2).)\n\nAfter the court denied the Otay Ranch parties' application for a temporary restraining\n\norder to halt the remediation work, the parties stipulated to extend the deadline for\n\npreparation and certification of the administrative record to the end of January 2013. The\n\ncourt set a briefing schedule and ordered a hearing date for July 12, 2013.\n\n       In January, the parties stipulated again to extend the deadline for certification of\n\nthe record of proceedings to February 8, 2013, and later agreed to a further informal\n\nextension. The parties met on February 7, 2013, to discuss the proposed CEQA record.\n\nAccording to counsel for the County, over half of the documents listed in the proposed\n\nindex were documents not properly part of the CEQA record and the index omitted\n\nhundreds of documents that were part of the CEQA record. After this meeting, the Otay\n\nRanch parties voluntarily dismissed the CEQA cause of action.\n\n       The Otay Ranch parties filed an amended petition in April 2013 alleging a cause\n\nof action for lack of compliance with the Health and Safety Code and a request for\n\n                                              3\n\fdeclaratory relief. The Otay Ranch parties did not file the administrative record with the\n\namended petition or indicate when the administrative record would be filed.\n\n       On April 25, 2013, the court denied Otay Ranch's request for an order shortening\n\ntime to hear a motion to stay the briefing and hearing in this case pending the outcome of\n\nthe trial in another case involving environmental clean-up of the shooting range.1 During\n\nthe ex parte hearing, the court inquired about the status of the administrative record.\n\nSince the Otay Ranch parties had not prepared the record, counsel for the County stated\n\nthe County would undertake preparation of the administrative record and would file it\n\nwith its answer, which was due within 10 days. The Otay Ranch parties did not object to\n\nthe County preparing the record nor did it challenge the County's assertion the Otay\n\nRanch parties would be obligated to pay the costs of preparing the record.\n\n                                              C\n\n       Because the County department responsible for maintaining the files associated\n\nwith the project did not have the manpower or resources to prepare the administrative\n\nrecord, it asked the outside law firm representing it in the litigation to prepare the record.\n\nCounsel for the County worked with James G. Clay, the County staff member most\n\nknowledgeable regarding the project, to gather and electronically reproduce the pertinent\n\nportions of the administrative record. Although the County maintained the project files in\n\n\n1      This is one of several cases pending in the San Diego Superior Court concerning\nthe environmental cleanup of the former shooting range. (Otay Land Company, et al. v.\nU.E. Limited, L.P. et al. (2006, No. GIC 869480); Otay Land Company, et al. v. U.E.\nLimited, et al.

However, as\n\nthe work unfolded, it became necessary for the attorney to become actively involved in\n\nreviewing and organizing the record. Given the technical complexity of the documents,\n\nthe scope of the record and the manner in which the documents were maintained, the\n\nattorney hired by the County was the only person who understood the interplay of the\n\nvarious versions of the documents as well as which documents should be included in the\n\nadministrative record and which should not. According to Mr. Clay, the work required\n\nsomeone with specific knowledge and a comprehensive understanding of the project over\n\nthe previous decade to reassemble various documents and technical reports with\n\nsupporting documentation to prepare an adequate administrative record, but the County\n\ndid not have adequate staffing to undertake this effort.\n\n       The attorney and the paralegals worked extended hours and through the weekend\n\nto prepare the record. The County filed and served the administrative record on May 8,\n\n2013, consisting of 326 documents totaling more than 18,000 pages. The following day,\n\nMay 9, 2013, the Otay Ranch parties dismissed the entire action.\n\n                                             D\n\n       The County submitted a memorandum of costs seeking recovery of $66,638.14 for\n\npreparation of the administrative record. The Otay Ranch parties moved to tax the\n\n                                             5\n\fCounty's cost, requesting the court disallow $59,545 for attorney and paralegal time\n\nincurred to prepare the administrative record. The Otay Ranch parties argued, as they do\n\non appeal, attorney fees should not be included in a cost award for preparation of the\n\nadministrative record because attorney fees are not authorized in this action by contract,\n\nstatute or law. The Otay Ranch parties did not object to $7,093.14 in record preparation\n\ncosts for time spent by law firm document clerks and county staff or to costs associated\n\nwith producing the electronic record through an outside vendor.\n\n       The County opposed the motion arguing the \"labor costs of 'persons with\n\nspecialized knowledge,' are recoverable when they are reasonably necessary\" to prepare\n\nan administrative record. The County presented declarations from Mr. Clay, defense\n\ncounsel and a paralegal explaining the process of assembling the administrative record\n\nand why it was reasonably necessary to expend attorney and paralegal time to prepare the\n\nadministrative record. The County also submitted supporting billing statements.\n\n       Noting the Otay Ranch parties failed to prepare the administrative record in the six\n\nmonths since the action was filed, the trial court ruled the Otay Ranch parties were\n\nresponsible for the costs of preparing the record. The court ruled a recoverable cost\n\nincurred in preparing the record \"must include the labors of the County\" in preparing the\n\nrecord.

In Hayward, the court observed courts\n\nhave allowed public agencies to collect the labor costs of outside assistance when\n\npreparing an administrative record, including the use of a private law firm, but no court\n\n\"condoned the unilateral delegation of the task to a party with an interest in the\n\nlitigation.\" (Hayward, supra, at p. 184.) The California Oak court did not find Hayward\n\ncontrolling because the University prepared the record itself and did not improperly\n\ndelegate record preparation to a third party. (California Oak, supra, 188 Cal.App.4th\n\nat p. 295.)\n\n       Similarly here, the County did not delegate preparation of the record to a third\n\nparty. The County undertook preparation of the administrative record after months of\n\n\n4       It is not clear from the court's discussion of the facts if attorney time was included\nin the cost award.\n                                              17\n\finaction on the part of the Otay Ranch parties, who initially elected to prepare the\n\nadministrative record for their CEQA claim. Given the history and complexity of the\n\nproject and how the documents were maintained, we cannot conclude the trial court\n\nexceeded the bounds of reason in determining it was \"reasonably necessary\" for the\n\nCounty's retained counsel and paralegals to prepare the administrative record since the\n\nCounty \"did not have the resources or experienced personnel to prepare the [r]ecord.\"\n\n       Sky Vista does not challenge the labor costs charged for County staff or law firm\n\ndocument clerks to assist with preparation of the administrative record. It challenges\n\nonly the labor costs incurred for an attorney and paralegals to prepare the record by\n\narguing these costs constitute attorney fees. Under Sky Vista's analysis an attorney's\n\nlabor for preparation of an administrative record could never be recovered, even if the\n\nhourly amount charged was de minimus.\n\n       Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1094.6 require a petitioner to pay\n\n\"actual costs\" and expenses of preparing the administrative record. Under the particular\n\ncircumstances of this case where the trial court found it was reasonably necessary for the\n\nCounty to incur attorney and paralegal labor costs to prepare the administrative record\n\nwithin a short window of time, we see no reason to differentiate between those actual\n\nlabor costs and actual labor costs for agency staff and document clerks to prepare an\n\nadministrative record. Nor do we see a reason to differentiate between labor costs\n\nincurred by individuals directly employed by a public agency and those incurred by\n\nindividuals employed by a private law firm retained by the agency, so long as the trial\n\ncourt determines, as it did here, the labor costs were reasonably and necessarily incurred\n\n                                             18\n\ffor preparation of the administrative record. To hold otherwise would undermine the\n\nstatutory policy of shifting the costs and expenses of preparing an administrative record\n\naway from the public and to the private individual or entity bringing the lawsuit. (Code\n\nCiv. Proc., ยงยง 1094.5, subd. (a), 1094.6, subd. (c); see River Valley, supra,\n\n37 Cal.App.4th at p. 182.)\n\n       We are not persuaded by Sky Vista's citation to Dep't of Forestry & Fire Prot. v.\n\nLebrock (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2246917\"><a href=\"/opinion/2246917/forestry-and-fire-protection-v-lebrock/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In that case, the court did not allow a prevailing\n\nparty to recover attorney fees in an action filed against her by the California Department\n\nof Forestry to recover the costs of suppressing a fire originating on her property. (Id.\n\nat pp. 1138, 1140.) After analyzing the pertinent Health and Safety Code provisions, the\n\ncourt concluded the statutes delineated recovery for \"the costs of suppressing the fire,\n\nproviding rescue or emergency services, investigation, making reports, and costs relating\n\nto accounting for the fire and collection of the suppression and rescue costs,\" but did not\n\nmention attorney fees for enforcing or defending an action to recover such costs.\n\n(Id. at pp. 1140-1141.) Here, Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6, subdivision (c),\n\nprovides for recovery of the \"actual costs for transcribing or otherwise preparing the\n\nrecord.\" It does not delineate or limit those costs to certain categories. Nor is the County\n\nseeking to recover attorney fees for enforcing or defending an action. It is simply seeking\n\nto recover the costs it actually incurred to prepare the record.\n\n       Sky Vista's citation to Science Applications Internat. Corp. v.

In a prior appeal in that case, we\n\nreversed an attorney fee award concluding the contract language at issue did not permit\n\n                                              19\n\frecovery of attorney fees. We remanded to consider whether items the trial court\n\nawarded for \"litigation expenses\" amounted to attorney fees, which would be disallowed\n\nunder the terms of the contract, or as otherwise recoverable costs under Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 1033.5. (SAIC, supra, at p. 1099.) On a petition for writ of mandate\n\nchallenging the new award of costs, we concluded the costs of hiring a \"high tech\"\n\nparalegal to organize documents and access them in discovery and trial were not\n\nrecoverable under the terms of the contract at issue in that case for the same reason we\n\ndisallowed recovery of attorney fees. (Id. at p. 1104.) SAIC did not involve costs and\n\nexpenses associated with preparation of an administrative record and it has no application\n\nto the facts before us.\n\n                                            C\n\n       The Otay Ranch parties did not challenge below the reasonableness of the hourly\n\nrates charged for the attorney and the paralegals for record preparation, which were\n\ndiscounted from their regular rates to $350 and $100 per hour, respectively. Sky Vista\n\nmakes no such challenge on appeal. However, the trial court undertook its own\n\nassessment of the reasonableness of those rates. It took into account the nature and\n\ncomplexity of the case, the results obtained, the amount of work involved, the skill\n\nrequired and the time consumed as well as the court's own knowledge and experience\n\nwith the rates charged in the community for similar work and concluded the \"rates\n\ncharged are at the low end of what the court would consider reasonable given the\n\nexperience of counsel.\" The court did limit the amount awarded to only those hours\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\freflecting labor after the date on which the County affirmatively elected to prepare the\n\nadministrative record. We find no abuse of discretion in this regard.\n\n                                               III\n\n                                 Evidence Submitted in Reply\n\n       Sky Vista contends the trial court abused its discretion in disregarding evidence it\n\nsubmitted with its reply brief regarding an indemnity agreement between the County and\n\nreal party in interest Flat Rock. Sky Vista claims it was unaware of the indemnity\n\nagreement until the County submitted its bills in response to the motion to tax costs and\n\nthese bills showed they were sent to both the County and to Flat Rock. Their counsel\n\nthen reviewed the administrative record served in this case before the dismissal and\n\ndiscovered the indemnity agreement. Sky Vista submitted the indemnity agreement to\n\nthe court with its reply brief. At the hearing, counsel for the County explained the\n\nagreement and copies of billing invoices had been produced in a related case months\n\nbefore Sky Vista filed its motion to tax. The trial court disregarded the evidence\n\nsubmitted with the reply brief, including the indemnification agreement.\n\n       \"The general rule of motion practice . . . is that new evidence is not permitted with\n\nreply papers. . . . '[T]he inclusion of additional evidentiary matter with the reply should\n\nonly be allowed in the exceptional case . . . ' and if permitted, the other party should be\n\ngiven the opportunity to respond.\" (Jay v. Mahaffey (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1522</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1537-1538.) \"This rule is based on the same solid logic applied in the appellate courts,\n\nspecifically, that '[p]oints raised for the first time in a reply brief will ordinarily not be\n\n\n\n                                               21\n\fconsidered, because such consideration would deprive the respondent of an opportunity\n\nto counter the argument.' \" (Id. at p. 1538.)\n\n       We cannot conclude the trial court abused its discretion in disregarding the\n\nevidence and argument regarding the indemnification agreement because it was raised for\n\nthe first time in reply. Although the trial court has discretion to admit new evidence or\n\nargument on reply under certain circumstances, it was not an abuse of discretion to\n\ndecline to do so based on the facts presented in this case.
