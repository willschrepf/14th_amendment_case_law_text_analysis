Ex. A, ¶ 7-9.   This agreement was\nmemorialized by the parties through completion of an EMAC REQ-A form.\n      {¶3} The Ohio State Highway Patrol is a division of respondent Ohio Department\nof Public Safety (DPS).        On November 3, 2016, an employee of requester\nGannett GP Media d/b/a The Cincinnati Enquirer (GP Media), made a public records\nrequest to DPS for the following:\n   1. A list of the names and ranks of the 37 Ohio troopers sent to North Dakota via an\n      agreement with the Emergency Managemet [sic] Assistance Compact (EMAC).\n   2. Any and all communication issued or received by any employee of the Ohio State\n      Highway Patrol, regarding the deployment of these officers.\n   3. Any document that outlines the agreement between the EMAC and the OSHP\n      regarding the action of sending the 37 troopers.\n   4. Any OSHP bylaws or procedures which govern agreements with EMAC.\n      {¶4} On November 23, 2016, P.R. Casey, IV, Associate Legal Counsel and\nPublic Records Manager for DPS, responded to each numbered request as\nsummarized below:\n   1. Records withheld based on the Security Records exception, R.C. 149.433(A)(1)\n      & (2)(a), and the Fourteenth Amendment protected privacy interest in officers’\n      personal security and bodily integrity,\n   2. Request denied as overly broad, but DPS encloses 39 pages of responsive\n      records from a previous, more specific request, subject to redactions under\n      R.C. 149.433(A)(1) & (2)(a),\n   3. Records withheld on the same basis as request #1,\n   4. DPS has no public records responsive to this request.\n\n      {¶5} On November 29, 2016, John Greiner, legal counsel for GP Media, sent a\nletter disputing Casey’s November 23, 2016 responses as to requests numbered 1, 2,\nand 3. On December 2, 2016, Casey replied to Greiner’s concerns, and added to his\nprevious response to Request No. 2 the following:\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                     -3-       REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n      “DPS does not keep its email records organized in such a manner as to allow for\n      a successful search based on the overly broad terms provided. Fulfillment of\n      your request would require our office to scrutinize and analyze every email for\n      any records containing information responsive to your request. * * * Please be\n      aware however, my offer from the November 23 letter to work with your client to\n      narrow the terms of the overly broad search, remains unchanged.”\nIn a letter dated December 22, 2016, Greiner responded to the December 2, 2016\nletter, disputing in further detail the grounds given by DPS for its denials.       On\nJanuary 11, 2017, Casey responded by affirming his previous responses, and\nreiterating that, “I remain ready and willing to work with you or your client to discuss\nways to find actual records. Again, please feel free to contact me at your earliest\nconvenience to discuss request #2 in more detail.”\n      {¶6} On January 17, 2017, GP Media filed a complaint under R.C. 2743.75\nalleging denial of access to public records in violation of R.C. 149.43(B). GP Media\nattached copies of         the original records   request, and   the   above-referenced\ncorrespondence with DPS. On February 14, 2017, mediation was conducted with a\nrepresentative of GP Media and representatives of DPS. On February 17, 2017, the\ncourt was notified that the case was not resolved and that mediation was terminated.\nOn March 6, 2017, DPS filed its response pursuant to R.C. 2743.75(E)(2).           DPS\nattached the affidavits of OSHP Lieutenant Colonel Kevin Teaford; North Dakota (N.D.)\nCriminal Intelligence Analyst Cody Larson; Bismarck, North Dakota Police Department\nLieutenant Jason Stugelmeyer; and a printout of a PowerPoint presentation used by\nLarson to document and train on the practice of online “doxing.” On March 8, 2017, the\ncourt ordered DPS to submit, under seal, an unredacted copy of the withheld records,\nwhich DPS states are all contained in the REQ-A completed by North Dakota and Ohio,\nand invited an affidavit explaining DPS application of a claimed exception to each part\nof the withheld records.\n      {¶7} R.C.149.43(C) provides that a person allegedly aggrieved by a violation of\ndivision (B) of that section may either commence a mandamus action, or file a complaint\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                       -4-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nunder R.C. 2743.75. In mandamus actions alleging violations of R.C. 149.43(B), a\nrelator must establish by “clear and convincing evidence” that they are entitled to relief.\nState ex rel. Miller v. Ohio State Hwy. Patrol, 136 Ohio St.3d 350, 2013-Ohio-3720,\n¶ 14. As for actions under R.C. 2743.75 alleging violations of R.C. 149.43(B), neither\nparty has suggested that another standard should apply, nor is another standard\nprescribed by statute. R.C. 2743.75(F)(1) states that such claims are to be determined\nthrough “the ordinary application of statutory law and case law * * *.” Accordingly, the\nmerits of this claim shall be determined under a standard of clear and convincing\nevidence, i.e., “that measure or degree of proof which is more than a mere\n‘preponderance of the evidence,’ but not to the extent of such certainty as is required\n‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ in criminal cases, and which will produce in the mind of the\ntrier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the facts sought to be established.” Cross v.\nLedford, 161 Ohio St. 469 (1954), paragraph three of the syllabus.\n       {¶8} For the reasons stated below, the special master concludes that the request\nfor all communication to or from all OSHP employees regarding the 2016 deployment\nwas properly denied as ambiguous and overly broad, but that DPS improperly denied\nGP Media’s requests for the names of Troopers and documents outlining the assistance\nagreement when it withheld responsive records in their entirety, instead of redacting\nonly items within the records that were exempt from disclosure.\n\n       Request No. 2:      All Communication by Any OSHP Employee Regarding\n       Deployment\n\n       {¶9} To demonstrate a denial of access to public records in violation of\nR.C. 149.43(B), an allegedly aggrieved person must show that they have made a proper\nrequest for reasonably identified public records. “‘[I]t is the responsibility of the person\nwho wishes to inspect and/or copy records to identify with reasonable clarity the records\nat issue.’ * * * ” State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, 112 Ohio St.3d 33, 2006-Ohio-\n6365, ¶ 29. Determination of whether such requests are proper or improper is based on\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -5-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nthe facts and circumstances of each case. State ex rel. Zidonis v. Columbus State\nComm. College, 133 Ohio St.3d 122, 2012-Ohio-4228, ¶ 26; State ex rel. O'Shea &\nAssocs. Co., L.P.A. v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth., 131 Ohio St.3d 149, 2012-Ohio-\n115, ¶ 21.\n       {¶10} An ambiguous request for research rather than specific records\nundermines the legitimate interests of both the public office and the requester.         A\nrequest to find all communications “regarding” a topic, to or from any employee,\nanywhere in the office, requires a needle-in-the-haystack search through the office’s\npaper and electronic communications. It also requires judgment calls as to whether any\ngiven communication – whether personal, tenuous, or duplicative – is “regarding” the\ntopic. If a public office attempts such a universal search, the time involved results in\ndelay for the requester. Nor can a public office assume that agreeing to “do the best it\ncan” with an ambiguous or overly broad request, instead of denying it, will shield it from\nliability. See State ex rel. Bott Law Group, LLC v. Ohio Dep't of Natural Res., 10th Dist.\nFranklin No. 12AP-448, 2013-Ohio-5219. The dilemma for the public office may not be\nwhether the public office can identify any records responsive to the request, but whether\nthe terms of the request permit it to reasonably identify all responsive records. Request\nNo. 2 poses a potentially impossible task to respond fully to its ambiguous and overly\nbroad terms.\n       {¶11} Ohio’s public records statutory and case law incentivize requesters and\npublic offices to cooperate in clarifying ambiguous and overly broad requests, with the\ngoal of finding the specific records that the requester seeks while minimizing the burden\non the public office. First, R.C. 149.43(B)(2) shields public offices by permitting them to\ndeny such a request, subject to revision:\n       (B)(2) * * * If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has\n       difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records under this\n       section such that the public office or the person responsible for the requested\n       public record cannot reasonably identify what public records are being requested,\n       the public office or the person responsible for the requested public record may\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                       -6-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n       deny the request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to revise the\n       request by informing the requester of the manner in which records are\n       maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary course of the public\n       office's or person's duties.\nIn State ex rel. Shaughnessy v. Cleveland, Slip Opinion No. 2016-Ohio-8447, ¶ 10, the\nSupreme Court cited examples of unreasonable requests to conduct research rather\nthan identifying the records sought:\n       “The Public Records Act does not compel a public office ‘to do research or to\n       identify records containing selected information.’ See State ex rel. Fant v. Tober,\n       8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 63737, 1993 Ohio App. LEXIS 2591, 1993 WL 173743,\n       *1 (Apr. 28, 1993), aff'd, 68 Ohio St.3d 117, 1993 Ohio 154, 623 N.E.2d 1202\n       (1993). See also Morgan, 121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, 906 N.E.2d\n       1105, at ¶ 14-15 (request for “[a]ny and all email communications * * * which\n       reference * * * the ‘evidence-based model’ or education funding in general” was\n       overbroad) (first ellipsis sic); State ex rel. Thomas v. Ohio State Univ., 71 Ohio\n       St.3d 245, 246, 1994 Ohio 261, 643 N.E.2d 126 (1994) (noting denial of writ of\n       mandamus where request for records sought selected information ‘regarding or\n       related to’ any pro-animal-rights action group or individual), citing Fant.”\n\nThe request found improper in Shaughnessy required research through seven days of\npolice incident reports to identify only those reports containing injuries of interest to the\nrequester. Id.; accord State ex rel. Daugherty v. Mohr, 10th Dist. Franklin No. 11AP-5,\n2011-Ohio-6453, ¶ 32-35 (“all * * * policies, emails, or memos regarding whether prison\nofficials are authorized to ‘triple cell’ inmates into segregation”); State ex rel. Dillery v.\nIcsman, 92 Ohio St.3d 312, 314, 750 N.E.2d 156 (2001) (request for “any and all\nrecords generated * * * containing any reference whatsoever to Kelly Dillery”); State ex\nrel. Glasgow v. Jones, 119 Ohio St.3d 391, 2008-Ohio-4788, ¶ 16-19 (request for any\nand all email sent or received for six months by one official); Zidonis, supra, ¶¶ 4, 28-32\n(request for all email between two employees where the office did not maintain email\nrecords so that they could be retrieved based on sender and recipient status); but see\nState ex rel. Carr v. London Corr. Inst., 144 Ohio St.3d 211, 2015-Ohio-2363, ¶ 25-29\n(request for email between one person and one department for two months found not\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                     -7-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\noverly broad). A request for communications is also ambiguous or overly broad when it\nidentifies correspondents only as belonging to titles, groups or categories, for which\nresearch is required to establish a correspondent’s membership. State ex rel. Oriana\nHouse, Inc. v. Montgomery, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 04AP-492, 04AP-504, 2005-Ohio-\n3377, ¶ 9, overturned on other grounds, 2005-Ohio-6763.\n      {¶12} GP Media requested “[a]ny and all communication issued or received by\nany employee of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, regarding the deployment of these\nofficers.” This request falls squarely within the above case citations of ambiguous or\noverly broad requests. The request is not limited to a mission file, or to communications\nduring a fixed time with North Dakota authorities. Instead, the request compels DPS to\nperform a search through all communications – internal and external, paper and\nelectronic – “issued or received by any employee of the Ohio State Highway Patrol.”\nThe request gives no time frame, and does not describe OSHP records as they are\nmaintained and accessed. The research topic of desired communications is, “regarding\nthe deployment of these officers,” an ambiguous phrase that could encompass anything\nfrom the deployment agreement (which GP Media did separately and specifically\nrequest) to personal communications with family, press releases, or tangential mention\nin remotely related records, with no clear limit. Without revision, the request fails to\nenable DPS to identify all potentially responsive records, and only responsive records,\nin a search through OSHP’s universe of communications.              Oriana House, Id.;\nShaughnessy ¶ 10, citing Thomas.       I conclude that Request No. 2 was improperly\nambiguous, overly broad, and requested a search or research rather than reasonably\nidentifying the records sought.\n      {¶13} After an office has denied a request that is ambiguous, overly broad, or\notherwise does not reasonably identify the records requested, it is then required to\n“provide the requester with an opportunity to revise the request by informing the\nrequester of the manner in which records are maintained by the public office and\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                     -8-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\naccessed in the ordinary course of the public office’s or person’s duties.”         R.C.\n149.43(B)(2).   The statute does not require the office to provide a comprehensive\nrecords maintenance tutorial, or to rewrite the requester’s request for them, but the\noffice should convey some relevant information to support revision of the request.\nOptions include, but are not limited to, offering to discuss revision with the requester,\nMorgan v. Strickland, supra, ¶ 14-20; Zidonis ¶ 40; Bott, supra, ¶ 52, a written\nexplanation of how records are maintained and accessed, and providing the requester\nwith a copy of the office’s records retention schedule. Zidonis ¶ 33-41. A requester’s\ndemonstrated ability to craft proper requests in the past, or the requester’s preexisting\nknowledge of the responding office’s records practices, can show that the requester\nalready possesses information necessary to revise and narrow a request. Id. A public\noffice’s voluntary effort to provide some responsive records, notwithstanding denial of\nthe request, is considered favorably in evaluating its response to an ambiguous or\noverly broad request. Id.; Morgan v. Strickland, ¶¶ 6, 14.\n      {¶14} After DPS exercised its right to deny Request No. 2 as ambiguous and\noverly broad, it invited GP Media to revise the request, and repeatedly offered to\ndiscuss the request to help GP Media clarify the records sought. DPS advised that it\ndid not have the capability to search department email using the terms given in Request\nNo. 2. (Casey letter of December 2, 2016.) DPS voluntarily provided GP Media with 39\npages of records previously produced to a different requester in response to a narrower\nrequest. (Compl. Attachments, pp. 5-43.) DPS’s quotation of this narrower request\nprovided an example to GP Media of reasonable identification of email records, and the\ncourt takes notice that requester was assisted in correspondence by experienced public\nrecords legal counsel. I conclude that DPS sufficiently met its obligation to provide\nGP Media with the opportunity and information to revise this request.\n      {¶15} GP Media has failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that\nRequest No. 2 was a proper request that reasonably identified the records sought. I\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                           -9-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\ntherefore recommend that GP Media’s claim of denial of access with respect to Request\nNo. 2 be DENIED. The parties retain the ability to continue negotiating their respective\ninterests in obtaining and providing any records that GP Media seeks.                        In their\ncorrespondence, DPS offered to discuss narrowing the request and ways to find actual\nrecords. GP Media responded that it welcomed the opportunity to discuss the matter in\nmore detail. Such discussions are favored by the courts, and could profitably include\nDPS referring GP Media to online records retention schedules relevant to the request,\nand GP Media narrowing the request with this and other information provided through\ndiscussion,1 Nat'l Fedn. of the Blind of Ohio v. Ohio Rehab. Servs. Comm'n, 10th Dist.\nFranklin No. 09AP-1177, 2010-Ohio-3384, ¶ 39.                  The parties are encouraged to\ncooperate going forward to achieve a mutually acceptable resolution of their interests.\n\n       Exceptions Asserted By DPS\n\n       {¶16} In asserting exceptions to an otherwise proper public records request, a\npublic office bears the burden of proof:\n       Exceptions to disclosure under the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, are strictly\n       construed against the public-records custodian, and the custodian has the\n       burden to establish the applicability of an exception. * * * A custodian does not\n       meet this burden if it has not proven that the requested records fall squarely\n       within the exception.\n\nState ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Jones-Kelley, 118 Ohio St.3d 81, 2008-Ohio-1770,\n886 N.E.2d 206, ¶ 10. “If a public record contains information that is exempt from the\nduty to permit public inspection or to copy the public record, the public office or the\nperson responsible for the public record shall make available all of the information within\nthe public record that is not exempt.”           R.C. 149.43(B)(1); State ex rel.

Safety, Slip Opinion No. 2016-Ohio-7987,\n¶ 49-50. Where a public office claims an exception based on risks that are not evident\nwithin the records themselves, the office must provide more than conclusory statements\nin affidavits to support that claim. State ex rel. Besser v. Ohio State Univ., 89 Ohio\nSt.3d 396, 400-404, 732 N.E.2d 373 (2000). More than bare allegations in an affidavit\nare necessary to meet the government’s burden to show that a record would disclose\ninformation that would endanger the life or physical safety of law enforcement\npersonnel, crime victims, witnesses or confidential information sources (under\nanalogous R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(d)).     State ex rel. Nelson v. Cleveland P.D., 8th Dist.\nCuyahoga No. 62558, 1992 Ohio App. LEXIS 4134, *5-7; State ex rel. Jenkins v.\nCleveland, 82 Ohio App.3d 770, 785, 613 N.E.2d 652 (8th Dist.1992).\n       {¶17} DPS does not dispute that Requests Nos. 1 (Trooper names and rank) and\n3 (documentation of agreement to deploy) were proper requests for records\ndocumenting official functions of the OSHP. DPS denied these requests by stating that\nall responsive records were “security records” excepted from public disclosure. DPS\nadditionally responded that release of the names/ranks and EMAC Agreement would\nviolate the Troopers’ 14th Amendment right to privacy. Requests Nos. 1 and 3 will be\nanalyzed based on each exception asserted. However, the REQ-A submitted under\nseal does not contain the rank of any Trooper listed therein and therefore disclosure of\nrank will not be included in the analysis of these requests.\n       Request No. 1: Names of Troopers\n       Fourteenth Amendment Right to Privacy\n       {¶18} DPS asserts that the Troopers’ names are excepted from release because\ndisclosure would violate their constitutional right of privacy under the Fourteenth\nAmendment.     Upon careful review, the evidence in this case supports the privacy\nexception only to the extent of withholding the Troopers’ names during deployment.\nThe evidence does not justify the continuing use of the exception following the\nTroopers’ return to Ohio.\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -11-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n       {¶19} Law enforcement officers have a fundamental constitutional interest in\npreventing the release of private information when disclosure would create a substantial\nrisk of serious bodily harm or death from a perceived likely threat.           Kallstrom v.\nColumbus, 136 F.3d 1055, 1064 (6th Cir.1998) (Kallstrom I). Any such disclosure by\nthe state should be measured under strict scrutiny. Where state action infringes upon a\nfundamental right, such action will be upheld under the substantive due process\ncomponent of the Fourteenth Amendment only where the governmental action furthers\na compelling state interest, and is narrowly drawn to further that state interest. Id.; State\nex rel. Enquirer v. Craig, 132 Ohio St.3d 68, 2012-Ohio-1999, ¶ 14. The fact that the\nrequesting party does not pose a threat is irrelevant to a public office’s allegation that\nreleased information “may fall into the wrong hands.” Id. ¶ 19. Records found to be\nprotected under the Fourteenth Amendment privacy right are “[r]ecords the release of\nwhich is prohibited by state or federal law,” and therefore excepted from the definition of\n“public record” by R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(v). Id. ¶ 13.\n       {¶20} OSHP Lieutenant Colonel Teaford received pre-deployment reports of\nthreats to North Dakota and other-state law enforcement personnel assisting with the\nDAPL protest response. He related briefing by the OSHP Intelligence Unit of incidents\nand threats of assault and vandalism at the North Dakota site against some officers and\nequipment. (Ex. A ¶¶ 14-20, 22, 27, 33; see also Ex. B ¶ 3-9 and attached slides.)\nWhile this evidence established that law enforcement officers were exposed to a risk of\nphysical harm while in contact with protesters, no evidence is presented that a Trooper\nwas more likely to be physically attacked, or be exposed to greater physical harm,\nsimply because their name was known to a person facing them at the site. However,\nLieutenant Colonel Teaford further stated that he had been informed that Pipeline\nprotesters or their supporters engaged in “doxing” some law enforcement officers\nserving at the DAPL site. “Doxing” involves posting a known person’s identity and other\npersonal information online with the intent to intimidate, harass or cause physical or\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                    -12-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nfinancial harm to the persons identified, and to their family members. (Response at\npp. 3, 14-15; Ex. A, ¶ 18; Ex. B, ¶ 4, Ex. C ¶ 4-11.) Although much of the text in the\nslides attached to Ex. B is difficult to read, it appears that the doxing therein relates\nsubstantially if not entirely to North Dakota law enforcement personnel. (Ex. B, ¶ 4-9\nand attached slides; Ex. C,¶¶ 5, 7-9, 11-12.) DPS does not document any incident\nwhere an OSHP Trooper has been doxed, or where other out-of-state law enforcement\npersonnel have been doxed. However, the reports and briefings received by the OSHP\nin advance of deployment supported a reasonable belief that release of Trooper\nidentities while they were a physical focus of attention for protesters at the DAPL site\nposed a substantial risk of retaliatory harassment or serious physical harm to Troopers’\nfamilies, through doxing. (Ex. A ¶ 17-18.) The withholding of names in response to\nGP Media’s November 3, 2016 request, like the removal of name bars from the\nTroopers’ uniforms, (Ex. A ¶ 19.), was designed to reduce that perceived risk.\n       {¶21} However, once the risk of physical harm or non-physical retaliation has\nreceded, a public office may be obligated to produce information previously withheld\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment right of privacy. State ex rel. Quolke v. Strongsville\nCity School Dist. Bd. of Edn., 142 Ohio St.3d 509, 2015-Ohio-1083, ¶ 25-31. Quolke\nupheld a finding that,\n       “during the strike, the board reasonably concluded that disclosure of the names\n       and other personal information about the replacement teachers would expose\n       them to substantial risk of serious harm. However, in general, a court is to\n       consider the facts and circumstances existing at the time that it makes its\n       determination on a writ of mandamus, not at some earlier time. State ex rel.\n       Pressley v. Indus. Comm., 11 Ohio St.2d 141, 162, 228 N.E.2d 631 (1967).”\nId. ¶ 28-29. The Court affirmed that records showing names and identification numbers\nof replacement teachers employed during a teachers’ strike were no longer exempt from\ndisclosure, where there was no evidence that once the strike was over there was any\nremaining threat to them. Id. ¶ 25-31. An assertion of ongoing or future risk must be\nsupported by relevant evidence specific to that time period.         “[W]ithout a clear\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                              -13-       REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\ndevelopment of the factual circumstances that would accompany any future release of\npersonal information * * *, any finding regarding future risk to the personal safety of the\nofficers and their families would be speculative.” Kallstrom I at 1068. Notably, upon\nremand from Kallstrom I the federal district court found that Officer Kallstrom and her\nfellow plaintiffs had “failed to provide any potentially admissible evidence to suggest that\nthe release of any information contained in the three personnel files may place any of\nthe plaintiffs at any risk of serious bodily harm. Nor have they identified a current\n‘perceived likely threat.’” Kallstrom v. Columbus, 165 F.Supp.2d 686, 695 (S.D.Ohio\n2001) (Kallstrom II).\n        {¶22} Only one case cited by DPS upheld withholding the names of law\nenforcement officers.2 The other cases cited fail to support the indefinite withholding\nof officer personal information based on conclusory assertions of risk. In State\nex rel. Keller v. Cox, 85 Ohio St.3d 279, 707 N.E.2d 931 (1999), a request identified\nDetective Paul Reece by name, and sought access to Reece’s personnel and internal\naffairs records. Reece’s affidavit stated that the criminal defendant on whose behalf the\nrequest was made, and a person the defendant had contacted, had threatened Reece\nand his wife.       Although the Supreme Court found that the affidavit could not be\nconsidered for purposes of the dispositive Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion, it upheld exemption\nof Reece’s personnel file based on Kallstrom I, finding that,\n        “files that contain the names of the officers’ children, spouses, parents, home\n        addresses, telephone numbers, beneficiaries, medical information, and the like\n        should not be available to a defendant who might use the information to achieve\n        nefarious ends.”\nId. p. 282. Keller applied Kallstrom I to withhold family and residence information, but\nnot Keller’s name. A later federal decision clarified that Kallstrom I “did not create a\n\n         2 DPS states that Kallstrom I and Keller both held that “the officer’s name” could be withheld.\n\n(Response pp. 11,13) However, neither case contains such a holding. DPS elsewhere correctly states\nthat the officer’s identity was already known in Keller (Id. p. 13.), and there is no indication in Kallstrom I\nthat officers’ names were either withheld, or held by the court to be subject to Fourteenth Amendment\nprivacy.\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                       -14-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nbroad right protecting plaintiffs’ personal information.       Rather, Kallstrom created a\nnarrowly tailored right, limited to circumstances where the information disclosed was\nparticularly sensitive and the persons to whom it was disclosed were particularly\ndangerous vis-à-vis the plaintiffs.” Barber v. Overton, 496 F.3d 449, 456 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(release of correctional officers’ social security numbers and birth dates to an inmate did\nnot violate the officers’ due process rights).\n       {¶23} In the one cited case where law enforcement officers’ names were withheld\nunder the constitutional privacy exemption, the circumstances were exceptional.\nCincinnati police officers had engaged in a gunfight with an outlaw motorcycle gang, in\nwhich the gang’s national “enforcer” was killed, and two officers were wounded. Craig,\n132 Ohio St.3d 68, 2012-Ohio-1999, ¶¶ 2-4. The police chief received information that\nthere was a good possibility the gang would target Cincinnati police in retaliation,\nespecially those involved in the gunfight, “and that the threat of retaliation for the death\nof the national enforcer could last indefinitely.” Id. ¶ 5. The Chief testified that,\n       “[B]ased on his ‘historic knowledge,’ it is not unusual for an outlaw motorcycle\n       gang to seek revenge against the police when one of its members is shot and\n       killed by the police. Both officers who had been wounded had themselves\n       returned fire, and both were concerned that if the Iron Horsemen discovered their\n       identities, the gang would retaliate by attacking them or members of their\n       families.”\nId.   In the Chief’s deposition, filed under seal, he provided “confidential information\nconfirming the existence of threatened retaliation against the wounded officers.” Id.¶ 22.\nThe Supreme Court held that the identifying information of the wounded police officers\nwas excepted from disclosure, based on credible evidence of a perceived likely threat\nthat the motorcycle gang would retaliate against the wounded officers for killing the\ngang’s national enforcer. Id. ¶ 20-23. DPS has provided no comparable evidence in this\ncase of violent incidents involving Troopers from which to anticipate individual\nretaliation; no threat of physical harm or doxing of any individual Ohio Trooper before or\nsince their return; no evidence that earlier, general threats of retaliation could last\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -15-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nindefinitely; and no affidavit from any Trooper in support of nondisclosure of their\nidentity. State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Streicher, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-100820,\n2011-Ohio-4498, ¶ 28-30; Craig ¶¶ 5, 20.\n          {¶24} Separate from any alleged future risk of serious bodily harm or death, DPS\nasserts that “Troopers also have a right to protect themselves against ‘doxing’ and\nperceived threats that are not physical in nature.” (Response p. 14.) DPS cites State\nex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Akron, 70 Ohio St.3d 605, 612, 640 N.E.2d\n164, which held only that city employees have a constitutional privacy right against\nunchecked release of their Social Security numbers, due to the risk of identity theft.\nNotably, other personal information in that case, including “[e]mployees’ addresses,\ntelephone numbers, salaries, level of education, and birth dates, among other things,\nwere all provided” without objection from the employees. Id. pp. 605, 610-611. The\nQuolke Court considered Beacon Journal v. Akron, and threats of nonphysical harm like\nthose that DPS asserts on behalf of the Troopers, but did not find them persuasive.\nQuolke ¶¶ 26-27, 30.        Finally, the federal Sixth Circuit has limited the scope of\ninformational privacy rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, and determined that a\nmere risk that information disclosure could result in identity theft or damage to credit\nrating does not implicate a fundamental constitutional interest.          “[I]dentity theft\nconstitutes a serious personal invasion, [but] it simply does not implicate the well-\nestablished right to personal security as contemplated by this court in Kallstrom.”\nLambert v. Hartman, 517 F.3d 433, 444-445 (6th Cir.2008). No Ohio case has created\na general fundamental constitutional interest in the privacy of one’s name. But see\nState ex rel. McCleary v. Roberts, 88 Ohio St.3d 365, 372, 725 N.E.2d 1144 (2000)\n(database of photographs, names, addresses and other personal information of\nuniquely vulnerable juvenile customers found subject to Fourteenth Amendment privacy\nright).\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                              -16-       REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n        {¶25} Ohio does have a robust statutory framework of exceptions for peace\nofficers’ and their families’ “personal information,” but the names of peace officers are\nnot protected. To the contrary, the Revised Code expressly requires that every law\nenforcement agency, as a public office,\n        “shall maintain a database or a list that includes the name and date of birth of all\n        public officials and employees elected to or employed by that public office. The\n        database or list is a public record and shall be made available upon a request\n        made pursuant to section 149.43 of the Revised Code.”\n\nR.C. 149.434(A).         Statutory provisions for confidentiality of peace officer3 personal\ninformation include: R.C. 4501.271 (upon request, the Bureau of Motor Vehicles shall\nnot disclose a peace officer’s residence address, or shall provide a business address on\nhis or her driver’s license, or both); R.C. 149.45(D) (upon request, public offices other\nthan county auditors must redact the address of the requesting peace officer from any\nrecord it makes available to the general public on the internet); R.C. 319.28(B) (upon\nrequest, the county auditor must remove the name, and replace it with the initials, of a\npeace officer from any record made available to the general public on the internet or a\npublicly accessible database and the general tax list of real and public utility property\nand the general duplicate of real and public utility property, as the name of the person\nthat appears on the deed); R.C. 2921.24 and 2921.25 (no officer, court or employee of a\nlaw enforcement agency shall disclose, without a determination of good cause, the\nhome address of a peace officer who is a witness or arresting officer in a pending\ncriminal case); R.C. 149.43(A)(1)(h) and (A)(2)(d) (exception for records pertaining to a\nparticular law enforcement matter, the release of which would create a high probability\nof endangering the life or physical safety of law enforcement personnel). In addition,\nR.C. 149.43(A)(1)(p) and (A)(7) exempt release of a peace officer’s personal residence\naddress, social security and banking numbers, benefit information, and similar\n\n        3Each of the statutes cited in this paragraph uses or creates a definition of “peace officer” that\nincludes OSHP Troopers.\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                     -17-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\ninformation regarding the peace officer’s family members, as well as photographs of\npeace officers who may engage in undercover assignments. Of these exceptions, only\nR.C. 149.43(A)(2)(d) implies authority to withhold a peace officer’s name, under specific\ncircumstances within a law enforcement investigation. By enumerating public records\nexceptions for specific peace officer information, the General Assembly has already\nweighed and balanced the competing public policy considerations between the public’s\nright to know that information generally, and the potential harm, inconvenience or\nburden imposed on the agency by disclosure. State ex rel. James v. Ohio State Univ.,\n70 Ohio St.3d 168, 172, 637 NE.2d 911 (1994). Compare State ex rel. Vindicator v.\nWolff, 132 Ohio St.3d 481, 2012-Ohio-3328, ¶ 32-37 (alternative access to the same\nrecords, and other protections for the rights sought to be defended, counter plaintiffs’\ndemand for restricted access to records under Sup.R. 45(E)). Thus, while officers’\nresidential and familial records have specific protections, statutory and constitutional law\nare far more restrained when it comes to concealing the names of law enforcement\nofficers.\n       {¶26} The policy underlying the Public Records Act is that “open government\nserves the public interest and our democratic system.” State ex rel. Dann v. Taft, 109\nOhio St.3d 364, 2006-Ohio-1825, 848 N.E.2d 472, ¶ 20. “[O]ne of the salutary purposes\nof the Public Records Law is to ensure accountability of government to those being\ngoverned.” State ex rel. Strothers v. Wertheim, 80 Ohio St.3d 155, 158, 684 N.E.2d\n1239, 1242 (1997). Therefore, R.C. 149.43 must be construed “liberally in favor of\nbroad access, and any doubt is resolved in favor of disclosure of public records.” State\nex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Hamilton Cty., 75 Ohio St.3d 374, 376, 662 N.E.2d 334\n(1996). Exceptions to disclosure must be strictly construed. State ex rel. Thomas v.\nOhio State Univ., 71 Ohio St.3d 245, 247, 643 N.E.2d 126 (1994). This applies to any\nexception, including the constitutional right to personal security and bodily integrity.\nSocial workers, patrol officers, strikebreaking employees, judicial officers, prosecutors,\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                              -18-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nhealth and zoning inspectors, politicians, corrections officers, and scores of other public\nemployees can be subject to harassment and threats of serious physical harm in the\ncourse of their duties, yet their names are available to the public. As the federal district\ncourt concluded in releasing information regarding the Kallstrom officers: “The Court\nappreciates the need to protect the health and safety of law enforcement officials and\ntheir families. But the health and safety of this democracy depend on a press that can\nfunction without additional burdens being imposed based on its ability to publish\ninformation concerning government activities.” Kallstrom v. Columbus, 165 F. Supp. 2d\n686, 703 (S.D. Ohio 2001).\n        {¶27} The risk that was perceived during deployment has now receded. DPS\npresents no evidence of retaliatory pursuit of the Troopers or their families. At the\npresent remove in time and distance from the North Dakota protesters, DPS has not\nprovided the required “clear development of the factual circumstances that would\naccompany any future release” of the Troopers’ names. Kallstrom I, p. 1068. The bare\nallegations of continuing physical risk in the response and in Exhibits A-C are\nspeculative and non-specific. An attenuated and receding risk of online harassment is\nnot the kind of threat that justifies indefinitely concealing the names of law enforcement\nofficers who exercised plenary police power during a public, uniformed mission. Even\nunder strict scrutiny, the evidence does not support a finding that disclosure of the\nTrooper names would pose a current substantial risk of serious bodily harm or death to\nthe Troopers or their families from any perceived likely threat, and DPS has therefore\nfailed to prove that the Fourteenth Amendment right of privacy applies to the names of\nthe Troopers at the present time.4\n\n\n         4 Even had the requisite level of future threat been shown, release would still satisfy the\n\nremainder of the constitutional balancing test. The courts assume that the interests served by allowing\npublic access to public records rise to the level of a compelling state interest, Kallstrom I. at 1065; State\nex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Streicher, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-100820, 2011-Ohio-4498, ¶ 31. And the\nrequest for names and the agreement was narrowly drawn to serve the interest of public access, as it\nrequested none of the residence or family information found problematic in Kallstrom I. Unlike the\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                          -19-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n       Request No. 1: Names of Troopers\n       Records Directly Used to Protect Against Attack, R.C. 149.433(A)(1)\n\n       {¶28} DPS separately asserts that the Troopers’ names are excepted from\nrelease pursuant to R.C. 149.433(A)(1) and (B)(1):\n       (A) As used in this section: * * * ‘Security record’ means any of the following:\n       (1) A record that contains information directly used for protecting or maintaining\n       the security of a public office against attack, interference, or sabotage.\n       (B)(1) A record kept by a public office that is a security record is not a public\n       record under section 149.43 of the Revised Code and is not subject to mandatory\n       release or disclosure under that section.\n\n“Public office” as used in the statute includes officials and employees. State ex rel.\nPlunderbund Media, L.L.C., v. Born, 141 Ohio St.3d 422, 2014-Ohio-3679, ¶ 20.\n       {¶29} As detailed in the Fourteenth Amendment analysis, DPS provides no\nevidence that the Troopers were any more subject to physical attack or sabotage at the\nDPS site whether protesters knew their names, or did not. The evidence shows that the\npredicted risk of “doxing” perceived by the OSHP in advance of and during deployment\njustified withholding Trooper names to protect them during deployment from the\n“interference” of threats against their families.          The evidence does not justify the\ncontinuing use of this exception following the Troopers’ return to Ohio.\n       {¶30} In Plunderbund, supra, ¶¶ 3-7, 19-31, DPS records of the investigation of\ndirect threats against the governor were found to meet the definition of “security\nrecords” in R.C. 149.433(A)(3)(a) – recodified in 2016 as R.C. 149.433(A)(1), 2016\nSub.S.B. No. 321. However, like the federal court in Kallstrom I, the Plunderbund Court\ncautioned DPS specifically, and agencies generally, that the exception must be proven\nin each case:\n       This is not to say that all records involving criminal activity in or near a public\n       building or concerning a public office or official are automatically ‘security\n\n\nrequest in Craig, the request for Trooper names was not mitigated by any release of other enlightening\nmission information from the REQ-A.

Nor should this exception be asserted beyond the person(s) demonstrably at\nrisk, or after the risk has abated. In State ex rel. Ohio Republican Party v. FitzGerald,\n145 Ohio St.3d 92, 2015-Ohio-5056, the county withheld as “security records” key-card-\nswipe data for the one employee against whom verified threats had been received, but\nreleased the same data for employees who had not received threats. Id. ¶¶ 6-8, 24.\nThe Court determined that when the threatened employee left his position, the key-card-\nswipe data were no longer security records, and ordered their release. Id. ¶¶ 27-28, 30.\n      {¶31} In contrast with the records withheld in Plunderbund and FitzGerald\ninvolving direct threats against particular officials, DPS shows no direct threats made\nagainst these Troopers either individually or as a group.       However, for the same\nreasons discussed in connection with the Fourteenth Amendment Right to Privacy, I find\nthat withholding the names in response to GP Media’s November 3, 2016 request, like\nthe removal of name bars from the Troopers’ uniforms, was designed to reduce a\nperceived substantial risk of online harassment including physical threats toward\nTroopers’ families, threatening “interference” with the Troopers’ mission. (Ex. A, ¶¶ 17-\n19, 29). The list of names therefore qualified as “security records” during deployment.\n      {¶32} An initial correct withholding of a record as a security record under\nR.C. 149.433(A)(1) does not establish the exception in perpetuity. The courts must take\ninto account that violence, harassment, and online threats associated with a particular\nevent often recede as a function of time and distance. In the analogous Quolke case,\nthe facts justifying withholding the names of replacement teachers during a strike\nincluded protesters chanting, jeering, and cursing; acts of harassment and intimidation;\ntaking and posting photographs online with derogatory and offensive comments; posting\nof signs in neighborhoods where some replacement teachers lived identifying them by\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                             -21-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nname and disclosing their addresses; violence against vehicles, and using vehicles; and\nthreats that consequences would follow replacement teachers “throughout their\ncareers.” Id. ¶¶ 5-9, 29, 30, However, the Court found that by the time the action was\nfiled:\n         “the board had presented little or no evidence that once the strike was over, there\n         was any remaining threat to the replacement teachers. That decision was issued\n         “taking into consideration the facts and circumstances as they exist[ed] * * *,\n         several months after the strike.”\n\nId. ¶ 30.    Five months have passed since the Troopers’ return to Ohio from North\nDakota. Further, unlike the replacement teachers in Quolke, the Troopers do not reside\nnear the protest site, or work in the same profession as the protesters. Against this\nseparation in time and distance, DPS presents little or no evidence of credible current\nthreats directed against the Troopers or their families. DPS has not shown that actual\ndoxing of Ohio Troopers has occurred, either collectively or individually. The evidence\nfails to support any continuing or new threat of physical harm following the return of the\nTroopers to Ohio.          The bare allegations of continuing risk are non-specific and\nspeculative, and do not establish withholding of names as “directly * * * protecting or\nmaintaining the security of [these Troopers] against attack, interference, or sabotage.”\nThe evidence does not establish that release of the list of names at this time threatens a\nsubstantial risk of future physical or even nonphysical harm.\n         {¶33} I find that during the DAPL deployment DPS officials were permitted5 to\nwithhold the list of Trooper names pursuant to R.C. 149.433(A)(1), based on reports\nthat law enforcement officers and their families would be targeted for retaliation through\n\n\n\n\n        5 The wording of R.C. 149.433(B) (“a security record is not a public record under section 149.43”)\n\nestablishes only a discretionary exception to the Public Records Act, and does not prohibit release of\nsecurity records. 2000 Ohio Op.

However, the evidence does not justify the\ncontinuing use of the exception to withhold Trooper names following their return to Ohio.\n       Request No. 3: EMAC Agreement\n       Fourteenth Amendment Right to Privacy\n       {¶34} DPS parenthetically asserts that other identifying information in the EMAC\nagreement would violate the Troopers’ constitutionally-protected privacy rights\nto personal security and bodily integrity. (Response p. 11.) In support, DPS states\nthat “information such as hourly pay rate that could easily lead to the Trooper’s\nidentities * * *.” (Response p. 14.) Lieutenant Colonel Teaford suggests how hourly pay\nrate could be traced to a Trooper’s name, and adds the item, “employee ID,” as\ninformation that could disclose identity. (Ex. A ¶ 27.)\n       {¶35} Based on the same evidence and reasoning applied to the Troopers’\nnames, I find that the employee ID numbers contained in the EMAC Agreement were\nsubject to withholding under the Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy during the\nTroopers’ deployment to North Dakota, but not at the present time.         However, the\nargument that a person could use a known hourly pay rate to research a particular\nemployee’s identity is too attenuated to make pay rate release a “disclosure of identity.”\nTwenty-one of the thirty-seven hourly rates in the REQ-A appear beside more than one\nname, even before considering their likely duplications with over fifteen hundred other\nTroopers employed by the OSHP. In the absence of any direct risk shown, disclosure\nof financial and time records violates neither equal protection nor substantive due\nprocess guarantees. State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publ. Co. v. Bodiker, 134 Ohio\nApp.3d 415, 429-430, 731 N.E.2d 245 (10th Dist. 1999). I conclude that the Fourteenth\nAmendment right of privacy did not apply to the Troopers’ pay rates listed in the EMAC\nAgreement at any time during or following deployment.\n       Request No. 3: EMAC Agreement\n       Records Directly Used to Protect Against Attack, R.C. 149.433(A)(1)\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -23-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n       {¶36} DPS argues that the entire EMAC Agreement meets the definition of\n“security record” set out in R.C. 149.433(A)(1):\n\n       (1) Any record that contains information directly used for protecting or\n       maintaining the security of a public office against attack, interference, or\n       sabotage;\n\nDPS asserts that the withholding of “deployment plans,” “vulnerability assessments,”\nand “tactical response plans” allegedly contained in the form is a direct use to protect or\nmaintain the security of the Troopers. (Response at pp. 8-11.) However, most of the\nsections in the REQ-A form contain only administrative and billing information. A limited\nnumber of records in a few sections do meet the definition of “security records,” and\nmay be redacted.\n       {¶37} As noted in the application of this exception to the list of Trooper names,\nthe Supreme Court has cautioned DPS and other agencies of state government that\nsimply labeling records involving criminal activity concerning a public office or official as\n“security records” is insufficient, without showing that it falls squarely within the\ndefinition in R.C. 149.433. Plunderbund, supra, ¶¶ 19-31. In State ex rel. Miller v.\nPinkney, Slip Opinion No. 2017-Ohio-1335, a sheriff’s office broadly labeled as “security\nrecords” all offense and incident reports in which the county executive was identified as\na reportee, complainant, or victim. Upon examination in camera, the Supreme Court\ndetermined that nine withheld reports “are not security records and are subject to\nrelease with the redaction of exempt information.” Id. ¶ 1-4, Appendix. Regarding\nsecurity of government equipment, see State ex rel. Data Trace Info. Servs., L.L.C. v.\nCuyahoga Cty. Fiscal Officer, 131 Ohio St.3d 255, 2012-Ohio-753, 963 N.E.2d 1288,\n¶ 65 (CDs documenting procedure and operation of recorder’s office to make backup\ncopies of instruments recorded are not “security records.”).\n       {¶38} DPS alleges that the REQ-A contains the OSHP’s entire deployment plan\nfor the North Dakota Pipeline protest. (Response p. 9; Ex. A ¶ 24.) In identifying\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                    -24-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n“information directly used to protect” the Troopers from attack, interference, and\nsabotage, DPS refers to “operational tactics used,” “future response plans,” plans of “an\noperational response for each day,” “a law enforcement response plan to violent\nprotests and criminal acts,” “specific and unique vulnerability assessments,” and\n“specific and unique response plans.” (Response pp. 3-4, 8-9)     However, upon review\nof the REQ-A, which was completed and signed prior to deployment, I find that it\ncontains no “plans” in the sense of detailed proposals for operational actions and\nresponses. Instead, both the response, and the affidavit of Lieutenant Colonel Teaford,\nshow that any such plans were created as part of briefings that took place after the\nREQ-A was completed. (Response ¶ 3-4.) For example, in his affidavit, Lieutenant\nColonel Teaford warns against release of briefings and updates that occurred during\ndeployment, such as,\n      “daily email briefing from one of the commanders, which included updates on\n      North Dakota authorities’ written daily intelligence records. In my review of these\n      records, I can confirm that the documents contained known threats to law\n      enforcement, security vulnerabilities, and tactical response plans for each day.”\n      (Ex. A ¶ 20.),\n\n       “One of the commanders also updated me on the previous day’s activities,\n      including the Troopers’ tactical responses to violent protests. These response\n      plans were unique * * *. (Ex. A ¶ 21.),\n\n       “The information from these briefings was used each day by law enforcement to\n      prepare for the day’s protest response * * *.” (Ex. A ¶ 22.), and\n\n      “we would * * * likely use the same operational response plans set forth in the\n      prior daily email briefings.” (Ex. A ¶ 24.).\nThese extended references to post-deployment briefings, North Dakota daily\nintelligence records, the “plans” developed during deployment, as well as any security\nopinions to the extent that they rely on these references (e.g. Ex. A ¶¶ 25, 27-32), are\nirrelevant in evaluating the actual contents of the REQ-A.\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -25-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n       {¶39} In the REQ-A form, only the lists of equipment promised by the OSHP, and\nprospective disclosure of the staging area, appear to meet the definition of “security\nrecord” in R.C. 149.433(A)(1). The evidence does not establish any direct relationship\nbetween withholding the administrative and billing information that constitute the rest of\nthe contents of the REQ-A, and the security of Troopers from attack, interference or\nsabotage. Regarding the similarly worded exception for trial preparation records,\n       Time sheets and billing records generally can be categorized as “routine office\n       records” that fall outside the definition of “trial preparation records.” See State ex\n       rel. Carpenter v. Tubbs Jones (1995), 72 Ohio St. 3d 579, 580, 651 N.E.2d 993.\nBodiker, supra at 427.\n       {¶40} Based on the above, I find that only the records within the REQ-A\nregarding equipment and staging area are subject to R.C. 149.433(A)(1), and the\nremainder are routine administrative and billing records that do not meet the definition of\n“security records.”      Appended to this report is an Attachment - Recommended\nRedactions To REQ-A in which the sections and fields of the EMAC Agreement/REQ-A\nare listed beside specific recommendations as to what information is subject to\nwithholding under the “security record” exception in R.C. 149.433(A)(1).\n       {¶41} DPS asserts that the “security record” exemption for these records\ncontinues after the Troopers’ return, alleging risk to future officers through disclosure of\nthe REQ-A “operational response plans and briefings,” and operational tactics used.\n(Response at p. 10-11.)      However, this exception does not automatically apply in\nperpetuity, and requires proof of continuing application. In Plunderbund, the records of\ninvestigations of threats against the governor were found still to be “security records,”\nregardless of investigation status or the passage of time, but in Plunderbund, DPS\nprovided much more detailed testimony connecting the disclosure of that information to\nfuture risks to the governor and his successors. Plunderbund. ¶ 24-31. In FitzGerald,\ndocuments were found no longer security records once the county executive left office.\nId. ¶¶ 27-28, 30. See Pinkney, Slip Opinion No. 2017-Ohio-1335, Appendix (documents\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -26-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nappear to contain innocuous information, unfounded threats, and/or were several years\nold).   The evidence in this case supports withholding only the lists of the OSHP\nequipment promised, based on testimony that the same lists would be used in future\nsimilar operations. (Ex. A ¶¶ 13, 29-32.) After deployment and return, the location of\nthe initial staging area in North Dakota is only historical information and no longer meets\nthe definition of a “security record.”\n        {¶42} Applying R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(d), an analogous exception involving officer\nsafety, the Eighth District Court of Appeals found that prospective release of a “strike\nplan” that would reveal specific procedures, plans and techniques at a time of potential\ncivic unrest “is precisely the kind of ‘information that would endanger the life or physical\nsafety of law enforcement personnel * * *.’’ State ex rel. Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s\nAss’n v. Cleveland, 122 Ohio App.3d 696, 699-701 (8th Dist.1997).             However, an\nattempted retrospective application of R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(d) was rebuffed in Conley v.\nCorr. Reception Ctr., 141 Ohio App.3d 412, 414-416, 751 N.E.2d 528 (4th Dist.2001)\nwhere an inmate made a request for work schedules and photographs of corrections\nofficers who had worked in his segregation unit on two past dates, with the purpose of\nidentifying particular officers who he claimed had battered him. The appellate court\noverruled the trial court’s dismissal of the claim, holding that the correctional institution\nwas required to present “an affirmative showing that disclosure would endanger the\nofficer.” Id. p. 416. The court observed that even granting that the inmate had a motive\nto attempt to harm his alleged assailants was not enough to establish a high probability\nof danger as a matter of law, especially since the inmate had been transferred to\nanother institution. The court noted that “[a] different case would be presented if the\n[inmate]’s request involved future work schedules, or similar information which could be\nused to discern specific law enforcement tactics or techniques on a given day and\nlocation.” Id. p. 417. The level of proof required by these cases is not present in this\ncase.\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                   -27-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n      {¶43} DPS also asserts that the “security record” portions of the REQ-A may be\nreused in hypothetical future OSHP deployments to North Dakota or in preparing OSHP\nrequests for assistance, and that disclosing the current REQ-A may put other states at\nrisk by revealing the specific request information from North Dakota. However, the\nREQ-A does not contain either operational response plans or briefings, and the\naffidavits provide only conclusory opinions and factually contradicted assertions. For\nexample, DPS asserts that dissemination of the REQ-A would threaten the security of\nout-of-state law enforcement:\n      [T]he EMAC agreement in the present case contains information relevant to\n      North Dakota’s requests to other participating states. Therefore, some of the\n      information contained within the EMAC agreement protects not just the Ohio\n      Troopers from attack, interference, and sabotage, but all law enforcement who\n      have assisted in North Dakota.\n(Response p. 8-9.) DPS further asserts that withholding the REQ-A directly protects\nwhat are expected to be similarly worded requests by Ohio in requests for assistance:\n      Should Ohio need to enact the EMAC to request law enforcement assistance to\n      the State, Ohio’s request and subsequent EMAC agreement with out-of-state law\n      enforcement agencies would undoubtedly look similar to North Dakota’s EMAC\n      agreement here. [citing Ex. A p. 3]\n(Response p. 10.) DPS argues in effect that release of an EMAC agreement by any\ncompact state poses this risk:\n      In the wrong hands the information in the EMAC agreement could be used to\n      thwart law enforcement’s efforts to maintain peaceful protests, or to compromise\n      the personal safety of law enforcement personnel, thereby placing these officers\n      in significant danger. [citing Ex. A p.4]\n\nHowever, multiple law enforcement agencies from at least six states that have assisted\nNorth Dakota with the DAPL protests have released redacted or full EMAC requests,\nagreements and in one case an after-action report in response to public records\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                        -28-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nrequests.6 Some of the web sites in footnote 6 are government sites, and the EMAC\nrecords reproduced in the remainder must logically be available on the public record of\ntheir disclosing agencies to any future requests. The assertion that Ohio’s copy of the\nREQ-A must be withheld to conceal information because it is common to North Dakota’s\nrequests to other states, and to future Ohio requests and agreements, is contradicted\nwhen similar or identical information is publicly available from other sources.             “The\nSupreme Court has found that ‘the interests in privacy fade when the information\ninvolved already appears on the public record.’ Cox Broad.

In the absence of\nqualified evidence, the court may not draw an inference that a protest where some\nparticipants use violence involves “acts of terrorism.”\n        {¶46} I conclude that because R.C. 149.433(A)(2) applies only to records\n“assembled, prepared, or maintained by a public office * * * to prevent, mitigate, or\nrespond to acts of terrorism,” and DPS provides no evidence that it prepared the REQ-A\nto prevent, mitigate or respond to acts of terrorism, DPS has not met its burden to prove\nthat R.C. 149.433(A)(2) applies to the records at issue.\n\n\n        7  Despite the wording of the link, the article provided at page 14 footnote 3 of DPS’ response,\nhttp://www.cincinnati.com/story/new/2017/01/10/ohio-officials-calling-standing-rock-protesters-\nterrorists/96250080/, does not quote any “Ohio officials calling Standing Rock protesters terrorists.”\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -30-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n       Request No. 4: OSHP Bylaws or Procedures\n       No Responsive Records\n\n       {¶47} With respect to Request No. 4, “Any OSHP bylaws or procedures which\ngovern agreements with EMAC,” DPS responded on November 23, 2016 that there\nwere no responsive records to this request. Ex. A ¶¶ 6, 10. A respondent has no duty\nto create or provide access to nonexistent records. State ex rel. Lanham v. Smith, 112\nOhio St.3d 527, 2007-Ohio-609, ¶ 15. Based on this evidence, I find that GP Media has\nnot shown a denial of access to any existing records responsive to Request No. 4.\n\n       “Security Records” May Be Redacted from EMAC Agreement\n\n       {¶48} DPS argues that the REQ-A may be withheld in its entirety, rather than\nredacting only those items meeting the definition of “security record.” (Response p. 7-\n8.) DPS points to the definition in R.C. 149.433(A)(1) of “[a]ny record that contains\ninformation directly used for protecting * * *.”       However, the Public Records Act\nexpressly requires that only records falling squarely within an exception may be\nwithheld:\n       “If a public record contains information that is exempt from the duty to permit\n       public inspection or to copy the public record, the public office or the person\n       responsible for the public record shall make available all of the information within\n       the public record that is not exempt.”\nR.C. 149.43(B)(1). The suggestion that the exception covers an entire 8-page\ndocument, no matter how little of it constitutes a “security record,”\n       “ignores [Supreme Court] precedent holding that public records can be items,\n       documents, and items within documents. See, e.g., State ex rel. Beacon Journal\n       Publishing Co. v. Akron (1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 605, 606, 1994 Ohio 6, 640 N.E.2d\n       164 (Social Security numbers found within payroll files were ‘records’ for\n       purposes of R.C. 149.011(G)); Dupuis, 98 Ohio St.3d 126, 2002 Ohio 7041, 781\n       N.E.2d 163, P21 (settlement proposal within larger court record is a public\n       record). Moreover, a contrary holding would ignore our precedent that the public\n       records laws should be read broadly and construed liberally to effectuate the\n       intent of the statute. See State ex rel.

Akron, 109 Ohio St.3d 162, 2006-Ohio-1244, footnote 3.\n       {¶49} Further, an analogous exception for “trial preparation” records is defined\nusing identical language, as “any record that contains information that is specifically\ncompiled in reasonable anticipation of [court proceedings].” R.C. 149.43(A)(4).\nHowever, not every record that simply contains trial preparation records within it may be\nwithheld in its entirety from a public records request:\n       “[R]ecords which purportedly contain trial preparation records * * * may be\n       viewed in camera by this court to determine which sections may be redacted\n       pursuant to the trial preparation records exception.”\nBodiker, supra, at 428.     Public offices have redacted security records from larger\nrecords, where appropriate. In FitzGerald, 145 Ohio St.3d 92, 2015-Ohio-5056, the\ncounty released key-card-swipe data for five employees and withheld only the data for\nthe county executive, Id. ¶ 6, rather than labeling the entire key-card-swipe database a\n“security record” and withholding all six. In State ex rel. Bardwell v. Cordray, 181 Ohio\nApp.3d 661, 2009-Ohio-1265 (10th Dist.), ¶¶ 68-70, 78, the Attorney General’s Office\nredacted only a phone number and an email response as security records, from within\nlarger correspondence.       See also other-state REQ-A redactions in footnote 6.\nA document that is composed entirely of security records, or in which security records\nare inextricably intertwined with the remainder of the document, may be withheld in toto.\nHowever, where only discrete and severable items fall squarely within the definition of\n“security records” and are assembled within a larger document, the Public Records Act\nand relevant case law require that only the specific security records may be redacted.\n       Conclusion\n       {¶50} Upon consideration of the pleadings and attachments, I find that GP Media\nhas failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that DPS violated division (B) of\nR.C. 149.43 when it denied GP Media’s Request No. 2 for all communication issued or\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -32-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nreceived by all employees of the OSHP regarding the deployment of Troopers to North\nDakota in 2016. The request was ambiguous, overly broad, and required a search or\nresearch instead of reasonably identifying the records sought.               Accordingly, I\nrecommend that the court issue an order DENYING GP Media’s claim for relief based\non Request No. 2.\n       {¶51} I further find that GP Media has failed to establish by clear and convincing\nevidence that DPS violated division (B) of R.C. 149.43 when it denied GP Media’s\nRequest No. 4 for any OSHP bylaws or procedures which govern agreements with\nEMAC. DPS presented unrebutted evidence that no records responsive to this request\nexist. Accordingly, I recommend that the court issue an order DENYING GP Media’s\nclaim for relief based on Request No. 4.\n       {¶52} I further find that GP Media has established by clear and convincing\nevidence that DPS violated division (B) of R.C. 149.43 when, following their return from\ndeployment, it withheld the names of the 37 Troopers deployed to North Dakota. I\nfurther find that GP Media has established by clear and convincing evidence that DPS\nviolated division (B) of R.C. 149.43 when it withheld the EMAC Agreement/REQ-A in its\nentirety instead of redacting only the portions that meet the definition of “security record”\nin R.C. 149.433(A)(1).      Accordingly, I recommend that the court issue an order\nGRANTING GP Media’s claim for relief based on Request No. 1, and GRANTING IN\nPART GP Media’s claim for relief based on Request No. 3, and which 1) directs the\nDPS to provide GP Media with a copy of the EMAC Agreement/REQ-A, subject to\nredaction of items indicated in the ATTACHMENT hereto, and 2) provides that\nGP Media is entitled to recover from DPS the costs associated with this action, including\nthe twenty-five dollar filing fee.

Ex. A, ¶ 7-9.   This agreement was\nmemorialized by the parties through completion of an EMAC REQ-A form.\n      {¶3} The Ohio State Highway Patrol is a division of respondent Ohio Department\nof Public Safety (DPS).        On November 3, 2016, an employee of requester\nGannett GP Media d/b/a The Cincinnati Enquirer (GP Media), made a public records\nrequest to DPS for the following:\n   1. A list of the names and ranks of the 37 Ohio troopers sent to North Dakota via an\n      agreement with the Emergency Managemet [sic] Assistance Compact (EMAC).\n   2. Any and all communication issued or received by any employee of the Ohio State\n      Highway Patrol, regarding the deployment of these officers.\n   3. Any document that outlines the agreement between the EMAC and the OSHP\n      regarding the action of sending the 37 troopers.\n   4. Any OSHP bylaws or procedures which govern agreements with EMAC.\n      {¶4} On November 23, 2016, P.R. Casey, IV, Associate Legal Counsel and\nPublic Records Manager for DPS, responded to each numbered request as\nsummarized below:\n   1. Records withheld based on the Security Records exception, R.C. 149.433(A)(1)\n      & (2)(a), and the Fourteenth Amendment protected privacy interest in officers’\n      personal security and bodily integrity,\n   2. Request denied as overly broad, but DPS encloses 39 pages of responsive\n      records from a previous, more specific request, subject to redactions under\n      R.C. 149.433(A)(1) & (2)(a),\n   3. Records withheld on the same basis as request #1,\n   4. DPS has no public records responsive to this request.\n\n      {¶5} On November 29, 2016, John Greiner, legal counsel for GP Media, sent a\nletter disputing Casey’s November 23, 2016 responses as to requests numbered 1, 2,\nand 3. On December 2, 2016, Casey replied to Greiner’s concerns, and added to his\nprevious response to Request No. 2 the following:\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                     -3-       REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n      “DPS does not keep its email records organized in such a manner as to allow for\n      a successful search based on the overly broad terms provided. Fulfillment of\n      your request would require our office to scrutinize and analyze every email for\n      any records containing information responsive to your request. * * * Please be\n      aware however, my offer from the November 23 letter to work with your client to\n      narrow the terms of the overly broad search, remains unchanged.”\nIn a letter dated December 22, 2016, Greiner responded to the December 2, 2016\nletter, disputing in further detail the grounds given by DPS for its denials.       On\nJanuary 11, 2017, Casey responded by affirming his previous responses, and\nreiterating that, “I remain ready and willing to work with you or your client to discuss\nways to find actual records. Again, please feel free to contact me at your earliest\nconvenience to discuss request #2 in more detail.”\n      {¶6} On January 17, 2017, GP Media filed a complaint under R.C. 2743.75\nalleging denial of access to public records in violation of R.C. 149.43(B). GP Media\nattached copies of         the original records   request, and   the   above-referenced\ncorrespondence with DPS.

A\nrequest to find all communications “regarding” a topic, to or from any employee,\nanywhere in the office, requires a needle-in-the-haystack search through the office’s\npaper and electronic communications. It also requires judgment calls as to whether any\ngiven communication – whether personal, tenuous, or duplicative – is “regarding” the\ntopic. If a public office attempts such a universal search, the time involved results in\ndelay for the requester. Nor can a public office assume that agreeing to “do the best it\ncan” with an ambiguous or overly broad request, instead of denying it, will shield it from\nliability. See State ex rel. Bott Law Group, LLC v. Ohio Dep't of Natural Res., 10th Dist.\nFranklin No. 12AP-448, 2013-Ohio-5219. The dilemma for the public office may not be\nwhether the public office can identify any records responsive to the request, but whether\nthe terms of the request permit it to reasonably identify all responsive records. Request\nNo. 2 poses a potentially impossible task to respond fully to its ambiguous and overly\nbroad terms.\n       {¶11} Ohio’s public records statutory and case law incentivize requesters and\npublic offices to cooperate in clarifying ambiguous and overly broad requests, with the\ngoal of finding the specific records that the requester seeks while minimizing the burden\non the public office. First, R.C. 149.43(B)(2) shields public offices by permitting them to\ndeny such a request, subject to revision:\n       (B)(2) * * * If a requester makes an ambiguous or overly broad request or has\n       difficulty in making a request for copies or inspection of public records under this\n       section such that the public office or the person responsible for the requested\n       public record cannot reasonably identify what public records are being requested,\n       the public office or the person responsible for the requested public record may\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                       -6-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n       deny the request but shall provide the requester with an opportunity to revise the\n       request by informing the requester of the manner in which records are\n       maintained by the public office and accessed in the ordinary course of the public\n       office's or person's duties.\nIn State ex rel.

A request for communications is also ambiguous or overly broad when it\nidentifies correspondents only as belonging to titles, groups or categories, for which\nresearch is required to establish a correspondent’s membership. State ex rel. Oriana\nHouse, Inc. v. Montgomery, 10th Dist. Franklin Nos. 04AP-492, 04AP-504, 2005-Ohio-\n3377, ¶ 9, overturned on other grounds, 2005-Ohio-6763.\n      {¶12} GP Media requested “[a]ny and all communication issued or received by\nany employee of the Ohio State Highway Patrol, regarding the deployment of these\nofficers.” This request falls squarely within the above case citations of ambiguous or\noverly broad requests. The request is not limited to a mission file, or to communications\nduring a fixed time with North Dakota authorities. Instead, the request compels DPS to\nperform a search through all communications – internal and external, paper and\nelectronic – “issued or received by any employee of the Ohio State Highway Patrol.”\nThe request gives no time frame, and does not describe OSHP records as they are\nmaintained and accessed. The research topic of desired communications is, “regarding\nthe deployment of these officers,” an ambiguous phrase that could encompass anything\nfrom the deployment agreement (which GP Media did separately and specifically\nrequest) to personal communications with family, press releases, or tangential mention\nin remotely related records, with no clear limit. Without revision, the request fails to\nenable DPS to identify all potentially responsive records, and only responsive records,\nin a search through OSHP’s universe of communications.              Oriana House, Id.;\nShaughnessy ¶ 10, citing Thomas.       I conclude that Request No. 2 was improperly\nambiguous, overly broad, and requested a search or research rather than reasonably\nidentifying the records sought.\n      {¶13} After an office has denied a request that is ambiguous, overly broad, or\notherwise does not reasonably identify the records requested, it is then required to\n“provide the requester with an opportunity to revise the request by informing the\nrequester of the manner in which records are maintained by the public office and\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                     -8-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\naccessed in the ordinary course of the public office’s or person’s duties.”         R.C.\n149.43(B)(2).   The statute does not require the office to provide a comprehensive\nrecords maintenance tutorial, or to rewrite the requester’s request for them, but the\noffice should convey some relevant information to support revision of the request.\nOptions include, but are not limited to, offering to discuss revision with the requester,\nMorgan v. Strickland, supra, ¶ 14-20; Zidonis ¶ 40; Bott, supra, ¶ 52, a written\nexplanation of how records are maintained and accessed, and providing the requester\nwith a copy of the office’s records retention schedule. Zidonis ¶ 33-41. A requester’s\ndemonstrated ability to craft proper requests in the past, or the requester’s preexisting\nknowledge of the responding office’s records practices, can show that the requester\nalready possesses information necessary to revise and narrow a request. Id. A public\noffice’s voluntary effort to provide some responsive records, notwithstanding denial of\nthe request, is considered favorably in evaluating its response to an ambiguous or\noverly broad request. Id.; Morgan v. Strickland, ¶¶ 6, 14.\n      {¶14} After DPS exercised its right to deny Request No. 2 as ambiguous and\noverly broad, it invited GP Media to revise the request, and repeatedly offered to\ndiscuss the request to help GP Media clarify the records sought. DPS advised that it\ndid not have the capability to search department email using the terms given in Request\nNo. 2. (Casey letter of December 2, 2016.) DPS voluntarily provided GP Media with 39\npages of records previously produced to a different requester in response to a narrower\nrequest. (Compl. Attachments, pp. 5-43.) DPS’s quotation of this narrower request\nprovided an example to GP Media of reasonable identification of email records, and the\ncourt takes notice that requester was assisted in correspondence by experienced public\nrecords legal counsel. I conclude that DPS sufficiently met its obligation to provide\nGP Media with the opportunity and information to revise this request.\n      {¶15} GP Media has failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that\nRequest No. 2 was a proper request that reasonably identified the records sought.

The parties retain the ability to continue negotiating their respective\ninterests in obtaining and providing any records that GP Media seeks.                        In their\ncorrespondence, DPS offered to discuss narrowing the request and ways to find actual\nrecords. GP Media responded that it welcomed the opportunity to discuss the matter in\nmore detail. Such discussions are favored by the courts, and could profitably include\nDPS referring GP Media to online records retention schedules relevant to the request,\nand GP Media narrowing the request with this and other information provided through\ndiscussion,1 Nat'l Fedn. of the Blind of Ohio v.

Id. ¶ 13.\n       {¶20} OSHP Lieutenant Colonel Teaford received pre-deployment reports of\nthreats to North Dakota and other-state law enforcement personnel assisting with the\nDAPL protest response. He related briefing by the OSHP Intelligence Unit of incidents\nand threats of assault and vandalism at the North Dakota site against some officers and\nequipment. (Ex. A ¶¶ 14-20, 22, 27, 33; see also Ex. B ¶ 3-9 and attached slides.)\nWhile this evidence established that law enforcement officers were exposed to a risk of\nphysical harm while in contact with protesters, no evidence is presented that a Trooper\nwas more likely to be physically attacked, or be exposed to greater physical harm,\nsimply because their name was known to a person facing them at the site. However,\nLieutenant Colonel Teaford further stated that he had been informed that Pipeline\nprotesters or their supporters engaged in “doxing” some law enforcement officers\nserving at the DAPL site. “Doxing” involves posting a known person’s identity and other\npersonal information online with the intent to intimidate, harass or cause physical or\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                    -12-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nfinancial harm to the persons identified, and to their family members. (Response at\npp. 3, 14-15; Ex. A, ¶ 18; Ex. B, ¶ 4, Ex. C ¶ 4-11.) Although much of the text in the\nslides attached to Ex. B is difficult to read, it appears that the doxing therein relates\nsubstantially if not entirely to North Dakota law enforcement personnel. (Ex. B, ¶ 4-9\nand attached slides; Ex. C,¶¶ 5, 7-9, 11-12.) DPS does not document any incident\nwhere an OSHP Trooper has been doxed, or where other out-of-state law enforcement\npersonnel have been doxed. However, the reports and briefings received by the OSHP\nin advance of deployment supported a reasonable belief that release of Trooper\nidentities while they were a physical focus of attention for protesters at the DAPL site\nposed a substantial risk of retaliatory harassment or serious physical harm to Troopers’\nfamilies, through doxing. (Ex. A ¶ 17-18.) The withholding of names in response to\nGP Media’s November 3, 2016 request, like the removal of name bars from the\nTroopers’ uniforms, (Ex. A ¶ 19.), was designed to reduce that perceived risk.\n       {¶21} However, once the risk of physical harm or non-physical retaliation has\nreceded, a public office may be obligated to produce information previously withheld\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment right of privacy.

DPS\npresents no evidence of retaliatory pursuit of the Troopers or their families. At the\npresent remove in time and distance from the North Dakota protesters, DPS has not\nprovided the required “clear development of the factual circumstances that would\naccompany any future release” of the Troopers’ names. Kallstrom I, p. 1068. The bare\nallegations of continuing physical risk in the response and in Exhibits A-C are\nspeculative and non-specific. An attenuated and receding risk of online harassment is\nnot the kind of threat that justifies indefinitely concealing the names of law enforcement\nofficers who exercised plenary police power during a public, uniformed mission. Even\nunder strict scrutiny, the evidence does not support a finding that disclosure of the\nTrooper names would pose a current substantial risk of serious bodily harm or death to\nthe Troopers or their families from any perceived likely threat, and DPS has therefore\nfailed to prove that the Fourteenth Amendment right of privacy applies to the names of\nthe Troopers at the present time.4\n\n\n         4 Even had the requisite level of future threat been shown, release would still satisfy the\n\nremainder of the constitutional balancing test. The courts assume that the interests served by allowing\npublic access to public records rise to the level of a compelling state interest, Kallstrom I. at 1065; State\nex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Streicher, 1st Dist. Hamilton No. C-100820, 2011-Ohio-4498, ¶ 31. And the\nrequest for names and the agreement was narrowly drawn to serve the interest of public access, as it\nrequested none of the residence or family information found problematic in Kallstrom I.

The evidence shows that the\npredicted risk of “doxing” perceived by the OSHP in advance of and during deployment\njustified withholding Trooper names to protect them during deployment from the\n“interference” of threats against their families.          The evidence does not justify the\ncontinuing use of this exception following the Troopers’ return to Ohio.\n       {¶30} In Plunderbund, supra, ¶¶ 3-7, 19-31, DPS records of the investigation of\ndirect threats against the governor were found to meet the definition of “security\nrecords” in R.C. 149.433(A)(3)(a) – recodified in 2016 as R.C. 149.433(A)(1), 2016\nSub.S.B.

Nor should this exception be asserted beyond the person(s) demonstrably at\nrisk, or after the risk has abated. In State ex rel. Ohio Republican Party v.

Id. ¶¶ 6-8, 24.\nThe Court determined that when the threatened employee left his position, the key-card-\nswipe data were no longer security records, and ordered their release. Id. ¶¶ 27-28, 30.\n      {¶31} In contrast with the records withheld in Plunderbund and FitzGerald\ninvolving direct threats against particular officials, DPS shows no direct threats made\nagainst these Troopers either individually or as a group.       However, for the same\nreasons discussed in connection with the Fourteenth Amendment Right to Privacy, I find\nthat withholding the names in response to GP Media’s November 3, 2016 request, like\nthe removal of name bars from the Troopers’ uniforms, was designed to reduce a\nperceived substantial risk of online harassment including physical threats toward\nTroopers’ families, threatening “interference” with the Troopers’ mission. (Ex. A, ¶¶ 17-\n19, 29). The list of names therefore qualified as “security records” during deployment.\n      {¶32} An initial correct withholding of a record as a security record under\nR.C. 149.433(A)(1) does not establish the exception in perpetuity. The courts must take\ninto account that violence, harassment, and online threats associated with a particular\nevent often recede as a function of time and distance. In the analogous Quolke case,\nthe facts justifying withholding the names of replacement teachers during a strike\nincluded protesters chanting, jeering, and cursing; acts of harassment and intimidation;\ntaking and posting photographs online with derogatory and offensive comments; posting\nof signs in neighborhoods where some replacement teachers lived identifying them by\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                             -21-      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nname and disclosing their addresses; violence against vehicles, and using vehicles; and\nthreats that consequences would follow replacement teachers “throughout their\ncareers.” Id. ¶¶ 5-9, 29, 30, However, the Court found that by the time the action was\nfiled:\n         “the board had presented little or no evidence that once the strike was over, there\n         was any remaining threat to the replacement teachers. That decision was issued\n         “taking into consideration the facts and circumstances as they exist[ed] * * *,\n         several months after the strike.”\n\nId. ¶ 30.    Five months have passed since the Troopers’ return to Ohio from North\nDakota. Further, unlike the replacement teachers in Quolke, the Troopers do not reside\nnear the protest site, or work in the same profession as the protesters. Against this\nseparation in time and distance, DPS presents little or no evidence of credible current\nthreats directed against the Troopers or their families. DPS has not shown that actual\ndoxing of Ohio Troopers has occurred, either collectively or individually. The evidence\nfails to support any continuing or new threat of physical harm following the return of the\nTroopers to Ohio.          The bare allegations of continuing risk are non-specific and\nspeculative, and do not establish withholding of names as “directly * * * protecting or\nmaintaining the security of [these Troopers] against attack, interference, or sabotage.”\nThe evidence does not establish that release of the list of names at this time threatens a\nsubstantial risk of future physical or even nonphysical harm.\n         {¶33} I find that during the DAPL deployment DPS officials were permitted5 to\nwithhold the list of Trooper names pursuant to R.C. 149.433(A)(1), based on reports\nthat law enforcement officers and their families would be targeted for retaliation through\n\n\n\n\n        5 The wording of R.C. 149.433(B) (“a security record is not a public record under section 149.43”)\n\nestablishes only a discretionary exception to the Public Records Act, and does not prohibit release of\nsecurity records. 2000 Ohio Op.

However, the evidence does not justify the\ncontinuing use of the exception to withhold Trooper names following their return to Ohio.\n       Request No. 3: EMAC Agreement\n       Fourteenth Amendment Right to Privacy\n       {¶34} DPS parenthetically asserts that other identifying information in the EMAC\nagreement would violate the Troopers’ constitutionally-protected privacy rights\nto personal security and bodily integrity. (Response p. 11.) In support, DPS states\nthat “information such as hourly pay rate that could easily lead to the Trooper’s\nidentities * * *.” (Response p. 14.) Lieutenant Colonel Teaford suggests how hourly pay\nrate could be traced to a Trooper’s name, and adds the item, “employee ID,” as\ninformation that could disclose identity. (Ex. A ¶ 27.)\n       {¶35} Based on the same evidence and reasoning applied to the Troopers’\nnames, I find that the employee ID numbers contained in the EMAC Agreement were\nsubject to withholding under the Fourteenth Amendment right to privacy during the\nTroopers’ deployment to North Dakota, but not at the present time.         However, the\nargument that a person could use a known hourly pay rate to research a particular\nemployee’s identity is too attenuated to make pay rate release a “disclosure of identity.”\nTwenty-one of the thirty-seven hourly rates in the REQ-A appear beside more than one\nname, even before considering their likely duplications with over fifteen hundred other\nTroopers employed by the OSHP. In the absence of any direct risk shown, disclosure\nof financial and time records violates neither equal protection nor substantive due\nprocess guarantees. State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publ. Co. v.

(Response at pp. 8-11.) However, most of the\nsections in the REQ-A form contain only administrative and billing information. A limited\nnumber of records in a few sections do meet the definition of “security records,” and\nmay be redacted.\n       {¶37} As noted in the application of this exception to the list of Trooper names,\nthe Supreme Court has cautioned DPS and other agencies of state government that\nsimply labeling records involving criminal activity concerning a public office or official as\n“security records” is insufficient, without showing that it falls squarely within the\ndefinition in R.C. 149.433.

Instead, both the response, and the affidavit of Lieutenant Colonel Teaford,\nshow that any such plans were created as part of briefings that took place after the\nREQ-A was completed. (Response ¶ 3-4.) For example, in his affidavit, Lieutenant\nColonel Teaford warns against release of briefings and updates that occurred during\ndeployment, such as,\n      “daily email briefing from one of the commanders, which included updates on\n      North Dakota authorities’ written daily intelligence records. In my review of these\n      records, I can confirm that the documents contained known threats to law\n      enforcement, security vulnerabilities, and tactical response plans for each day.”\n      (Ex. A ¶ 20.),\n\n       “One of the commanders also updated me on the previous day’s activities,\n      including the Troopers’ tactical responses to violent protests.

The evidence does not establish any direct relationship\nbetween withholding the administrative and billing information that constitute the rest of\nthe contents of the REQ-A, and the security of Troopers from attack, interference or\nsabotage. Regarding the similarly worded exception for trial preparation records,\n       Time sheets and billing records generally can be categorized as “routine office\n       records” that fall outside the definition of “trial preparation records.” See State ex\n       rel.

However, this exception does not automatically apply in\nperpetuity, and requires proof of continuing application. In Plunderbund, the records of\ninvestigations of threats against the governor were found still to be “security records,”\nregardless of investigation status or the passage of time, but in Plunderbund, DPS\nprovided much more detailed testimony connecting the disclosure of that information to\nfuture risks to the governor and his successors.

However, the\nREQ-A does not contain either operational response plans or briefings, and the\naffidavits provide only conclusory opinions and factually contradicted assertions.

Therefore, some of the\n      information contained within the EMAC agreement protects not just the Ohio\n      Troopers from attack, interference, and sabotage, but all law enforcement who\n      have assisted in North Dakota.\n(Response p. 8-9.) DPS further asserts that withholding the REQ-A directly protects\nwhat are expected to be similarly worded requests by Ohio in requests for assistance:\n      Should Ohio need to enact the EMAC to request law enforcement assistance to\n      the State, Ohio’s request and subsequent EMAC agreement with out-of-state law\n      enforcement agencies would undoubtedly look similar to North Dakota’s EMAC\n      agreement here.

In the absence of\nqualified evidence, the court may not draw an inference that a protest where some\nparticipants use violence involves “acts of terrorism.”\n        {¶46} I conclude that because R.C. 149.433(A)(2) applies only to records\n“assembled, prepared, or maintained by a public office * * * to prevent, mitigate, or\nrespond to acts of terrorism,” and DPS provides no evidence that it prepared the REQ-A\nto prevent, mitigate or respond to acts of terrorism, DPS has not met its burden to prove\nthat R.C. 149.433(A)(2) applies to the records at issue.\n\n\n        7  Despite the wording of the link, the article provided at page 14 footnote 3 of DPS’ response,\nhttp://www.cincinnati.com/story/new/2017/01/10/ohio-officials-calling-standing-rock-protesters-\nterrorists/96250080/, does not quote any “Ohio officials calling Standing Rock protesters terrorists.”\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -30-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\n       Request No. 4: OSHP Bylaws or Procedures\n       No Responsive Records\n\n       {¶47} With respect to Request No. 4, “Any OSHP bylaws or procedures which\ngovern agreements with EMAC,” DPS responded on November 23, 2016 that there\nwere no responsive records to this request.

In State ex rel. Bardwell v. Cordray, 181 Ohio\nApp.3d 661, 2009-Ohio-1265 (10th Dist.), ¶¶ 68-70, 78, the Attorney General’s Office\nredacted only a phone number and an email response as security records, from within\nlarger correspondence.       See also other-state REQ-A redactions in footnote 6.\nA document that is composed entirely of security records, or in which security records\nare inextricably intertwined with the remainder of the document, may be withheld in toto.\nHowever, where only discrete and severable items fall squarely within the definition of\n“security records” and are assembled within a larger document, the Public Records Act\nand relevant case law require that only the specific security records may be redacted.\n       Conclusion\n       {¶50} Upon consideration of the pleadings and attachments, I find that GP Media\nhas failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that DPS violated division (B) of\nR.C. 149.43 when it denied GP Media’s Request No. 2 for all communication issued or\n\fCase No. 2017-00051-PQ                      -32-     REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION\n\n\nreceived by all employees of the OSHP regarding the deployment of Troopers to North\nDakota in 2016. The request was ambiguous, overly broad, and required a search or\nresearch instead of reasonably identifying the records sought.               Accordingly, I\nrecommend that the court issue an order DENYING GP Media’s claim for relief based\non Request No. 2.\n       {¶51} I further find that GP Media has failed to establish by clear and convincing\nevidence that DPS violated division (B) of R.C. 149.43 when it denied GP Media’s\nRequest No. 4 for any OSHP bylaws or procedures which govern agreements with\nEMAC. DPS presented unrebutted evidence that no records responsive to this request\nexist. Accordingly, I recommend that the court issue an order DENYING GP Media’s\nclaim for relief based on Request No. 4.\n       {¶52} I further find that GP Media has established by clear and convincing\nevidence that DPS violated division (B) of R.C. 149.43 when, following their return from\ndeployment, it withheld the names of the 37 Troopers deployed to North Dakota. I\nfurther find that GP Media has established by clear and convincing evidence that DPS\nviolated division (B) of R.C. 149.43 when it withheld the EMAC Agreement/REQ-A in its\nentirety instead of redacting only the portions that meet the definition of “security record”\nin R.C. 149.433(A)(1).      Accordingly, I recommend that the court issue an order\nGRANTING GP Media’s claim for relief based on Request No. 1, and GRANTING IN\nPART GP Media’s claim for relief based on Request No. 3, and which 1) directs the\nDPS to provide GP Media with a copy of the EMAC Agreement/REQ-A, subject to\nredaction of items indicated in the ATTACHMENT hereto, and 2) provides that\nGP Media is entitled to recover from DPS the costs associated with this action, including\nthe twenty-five dollar filing fee.

The special master determined that respondent properly applied the constitutional right of privacy, and the security records exception in R.C. 149.433(A)(1), during the troopers' deployment to withhold the identities of troopers, initial staging area, and certain equipment provided, but should not have applied these exceptions to the remainder of the agreement document. Following the troopers' return, the special master found the evidence did not support continuing application of these exceptions to the identity of the troopers and the initial staging area. The special master determined that R.C. 149.433 permits withholding only those portions of a document that meet the definition of \"security record,\" and not the entire document in which it is found. The special master determined that no evidence supported application of the security records exception in R.C. 149.433(A)(2) which depends on records being related to \"acts of terrorism.\" The special master recommended that the respondent be ordered to produce all withheld records other than the identification of certain equipment.",
