This sweeping immunity is inconsistent \r\nwith United States Supreme Court precedent and extends far beyond the \r\nprotections our Constitution affords religious conduct. The First Amendment \r\nguards religious liberty; it does not sanction intentional abuse in religion’s \r\nname. Because the Court’s holding precludes recovery of emotional damages—even \r\nfor assault and other serious torts—where the defendant alleges that the \r\nunderlying assault was religious in nature, I respectfully dissent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>I</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Ironically, much of my analysis mirrors that found in Pleasant Glade’s \r\nearlier plea to the court of appeals. <i>See, e.g., infra </i>note 9. In its \r\nsuccessful petition for a writ of mandamus, Pleasant Glade conceded that \r\nSchubert’s claim for assault, battery, and false imprisonment presented a \r\n“‘secular controversy’ and does not come within the protection of the First \r\nAmendment. That is, no church or pastor can use the First Amendment as an excuse \r\nto cause bodily injury to any person.” In the subsequent appeal, the court of \r\nappeals held that Pleasant Glade, having received mandamus relief to exclude \r\nreligious references at trial, was precluded from raising a First Amendment \r\ndefense that it had quite purposefully abandoned. <span class=\"GramE\">174 S.W.3d \r\n388, 407.</span> The Court holds that it is not. In light of the Court’s \r\nultimate dismissal for want of jurisdiction, however, I find the Court’s \r\nprotracted discussion of judicial estoppel puzzling. Subject-matter jurisdiction \r\ncannot be conferred by estoppel, <i>Van <span class=\"SpellE\">Indep</span>. <span class=\"SpellE\">Sch</span>. Dist. v. McCarty</i>, 165 S.W.3d 351, 354 (Tex. 2005), or waiver, <i>Tellez v. City of Socorro</i>, \r\n226 S.W.3d 413, 414 (Tex. 2007), so the estoppel issue would seem, \r\ntechnically, beyond the Court’s reach.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[1]</span></span><span></span><span></span> The Court has nevertheless expounded on \r\nthis question, and because the Court errs in its analysis, I offer a brief \r\nrejoinder. </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>The Court states that Pleasant Glade is not judicially estopped from \r\nmaking its First Amendment arguments because, among other reasons, “the asserted \r\ninconsistency did not arise in a prior proceeding, but in this same case,” __ \r\nS.W.3d __, __, and “[c]<span class=\"SpellE\">ontradictory</span> positions taken in \r\nthe same proceeding . . . do not invoke the doctrine of judicial estoppel,” \r\n<i>id. </i><span class=\"GramE\">at</span> __. That characterization misses the \r\nmark. The United States Supreme Court recently discussed the policy \r\nconsiderations underlying judicial estoppel and the rationale behind the \r\nrequirement that parties succeed in a prior proceeding:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">[C]<span class=\"SpellE\">ourts</span> regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in \r\npersuading a court to accept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial \r\nacceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create <i>the \r\nperception that either the first or the second court was misled</i>. Absent \r\nsuccess in a prior proceeding, a party’s later inconsistent position introduces \r\n<i>no risk of inconsistent court determinations</i>, and thus poses little \r\nthreat to judicial integrity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>New \r\nHampshire v. Maine</i>, 532 U.S. 742, 750-51 (2001) (citations \r\nomitted) (emphasis added). This Court’s formalistic conception of “prior \r\nproceedings” will fail to capture many situations that implicate these concerns. \r\nIf a party obtains mandamus relief from this Court by taking one position and \r\nthen wins a judgment, also from this Court, as part of the same suit and based \r\non the opposite contention, this no less creates the “perception that either the \r\nfirst or the second court was misled” and presents the “risk of inconsistent \r\ncourt determinations” than if the mandamus proceeding had originated from a \r\ndifferent action. <i>Id</i>. The appropriate test to determine \r\nif there has been a prior proceeding for the purposes of judicial estoppel is \r\nwhether the court has made a ruling—or “determination”—on the issue. <i>Id.</i><i> </i>Thus, \r\nparties would be able to reverse course before the court has ruled, but could be \r\nbound by their previous position once successful (and if the other elements of \r\njudicial estoppel are present).<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[2]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Although I agree, for the reasons discussed below, <i>see infra </i>n. \r\n12, that Pleasant Glade is not estopped under these <span class=\"GramE\">facts,</span> the Court arrives at the estoppel question \r\nimprovidently and reaches a conclusion that will limit Texas courts’ ability to \r\npreserve judicial integrity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>II</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>A</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The rights \r\ncontained in the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses are among our most \r\ncherished constitutional freedoms. As broad as these protections are, I agree \r\nwith the Court that “‘under the cloak of religion, persons may [not], with \r\nimpunity,’ commit intentional torts upon their religious adherents.” __<i> \r\n</i>S.W.3d at __ (quoting<i> Cantwell v. Connecticut</i>, 310 \r\nU.S. 296, 306 (1940)). Unfortunately, \r\nthis is precisely what the Court’s holding allows. Here, assuming all facts \r\nfavorable to the verdict, members of Pleasant Glade restrained Schubert on two \r\nseparate occasions against her will. During the first encounter, seven members \r\npinned her to the floor for <i>two hours</i> while she cried, screamed, kicked, \r\nflailed, and demanded to be released. This violent act caused Schubert multiple \r\nbruises, carpet burns, scrapes, and injuries to her wrists, shoulders, and back. \r\nAs she testified, “I was being grabbed by my wrists, on my ankles, on my \r\nshoulders, everywhere. I was fighting with everything I had to get up, I was \r\ntelling them, no. I was telling them, let go, leave me alone. They did not \r\nrespond at all.” After Schubert “complied with what they wanted [her] to do,” \r\nshe was temporarily released. Fifteen minutes later, at the direction of \r\nPleasant Glade’s youth pastor, a different group of seven church members \r\nphysically restrained her for an hour longer. After this experience, Schubert \r\nwas “weak from exhaustion” and could hardly stand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Three days later, a male church member approached Schubert after a \r\nservice and put his arm around her shoulders. At this point, Schubert was still \r\ntrying to figure out “what had happened” at the previous incident, “wasn’t \r\ninterested in being touched,” and resisted him. As Schubert testified, “I tried \r\nto scoot away from him. He scooted closer. He was more persistent. Finally, his \r\ngrasp on me just got hard . . . before I knew it, I was being grabbed again.” \r\nEight members of Pleasant Glade then proceeded to hold the crying, screaming, \r\nseventeen year-old Schubert spread-eagle on the floor as she thrashed, \r\nattempting to break free. After this attack, Schubert was unable to stand \r\nwithout assistance and has no recollection of events immediately afterward. On \r\nboth occasions, Schubert was scared and in pain, feeling that she could not \r\nbreathe and that “somebody was going to break [her] leg,” not knowing “what was \r\ngoing to happen next.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>The jury found that petitioners assaulted and falsely imprisoned \r\nSchubert, and the trial court rendered judgment for her on the false \r\nimprisonment claim. Although this case presents an unusual set of facts, \r\ninvolving physical restraint not proven to be part of any established church \r\npractice, at its core the case is about secular, intentional tort claims \r\nsquarely within our jurisdiction, and I believe the Court errs in dismissing for \r\nwant thereof. I will address each of the Court’s arguments in turn. First, the \r\nCourt states that because Schubert’s “proof at trial related solely to her \r\nsubsequent emotional or psychological injuries,” her “case at trial then was not \r\nsignificantly different from what she would have presented under her claim of \r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress . . . [a] type of claim [that] \r\nwould necessarily require an inquiry into the truth or falsity of religious \r\nbeliefs that is forbidden by the Constitution.” __ S.W.3d at __ (citations \r\nomitted). As an initial matter, this is factually inaccurate. Schubert testified \r\nthat she suffered <i>physical</i> as well as emotional injuries from the \r\nassaults. Furthermore, the jury awarded damages for <span class=\"SpellE\">unsegregated</span> past “physical pain and mental anguish.” \r\nPleasant Glade did not request that the damages be segregated, and so waived any \r\ncomplaint that her physical injuries were not compensable. <span>Tex. R. Civ. P. 274</span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>More importantly, the Court’s allusion to intentional infliction of \r\nemotional distress fails to explain how submitting Schubert’s emotional damages \r\nclaim would “require an inquiry into the truth or falsity of religious beliefs,” \r\n“embroil this Court in an assessment of the propriety of . . . religious \r\nbeliefs,” or “<span class=\"SpellE\">decid</span>[e] issues of religious doctrine.” \r\n__ S.W.3d at __, __, __ (citations omitted). In <i>Tilton v. Marshall,</i> 925 \r\nS.W.2d 672, 682 (Tex. 1996), we held that intentional infliction of emotional \r\ndistress claims based on insincere religious representations and breached \r\npromises to read, touch, and pray over tithes and prayer requests were barred by \r\nthe First Amendment. We explained:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the \r\nelements that a plaintiff must prove to establish intentional infliction of \r\nemotional distress is that the conduct was \"so outrageous in character, and so \r\nextreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be \r\nregarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\" With \r\nregard to religious representations, we conclude that no conscientious fact \r\nfinder would make such a determination without at least considering the \r\nobjective truth or falsity of the defendants' beliefs, regardless of what \r\nevidentiary exclusions or limiting instructions were attempted. After all, the \r\noutrageousness and extremity of a representation is, under almost any \r\ncircumstance, aggravated by being false or mitigated by being true.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span></span> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"GramE\">925 S.W.2d at 681.</span> This case is not like <i>Tilton</i>. False \r\nimprisonment does not require a showing of outrageous conduct.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[3]</span></span><span></span><span></span> Evaluating whether Pleasant Glade falsely \r\nimprisoned Schubert does not require the <span class=\"SpellE\">factfinder</span> to \r\ndetermine “the objective truth or falsity of the defendants’ belief,” <i>id., \r\n</i>and neither does awarding her emotional damages. It is a basic tenet of tort \r\nlaw that emotional damages may be recovered for intentional torts involving \r\nphysical invasions, such as assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \r\n<i>See</i>, <i>e.g., Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc. v. Silva</i>, 148 S.W.3d 370, \r\n374 (Tex. 2004) (affirming award of mental anguish damages for false \r\nimprisonment); <i>Fisher v. Carrousel Motor Hotel, Inc.</i>, 424 S.W.2d 627, 630 \r\n(Tex. 1967) (\"Personal indignity is the essence of an action for battery.\"); \r\n<i>Davidson v. Lee</i>, 139 S.W. 904, 907 (Tex. <span class=\"SpellE\">Civ</span>. \r\nApp.—Galveston 1911, writ <span class=\"SpellE\">ref’d</span>) (“The rule that \r\ndamages cannot be recovered for mental suffering unaccompanied by physical \r\ninjury is not applicable when the wrong complained of is a willful one intended \r\nby the wrongdoer to wound the feelings and produce mental anguish and suffering, \r\nor from which such result should be reasonably anticipated, as a natural \r\nconsequence.”); <span>Restatement (Second) of \r\nTorts</span>, § 905 <span class=\"SpellE\">cmt</span>. c (1965) (“The principal \r\nelement of damages in actions for battery, assault or false imprisonment . . . \r\nis frequently the disagreeable emotion experienced by the plaintiff.”); <span>W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on \r\nTorts </span>§ 11 (5th ed. 1984) (“Since the injury [resulting from false \r\nimprisonment] is in large part a mental one, the plaintiff is entitled to \r\ndamages for mental suffering, humiliation, and the like.”); 20 <span>William V. Dorsaneo III, Texas Litigation \r\nGuide</span> § 331.06 (2007) (“Mental suffering caused by a false imprisonment, \r\nincluding humiliation, shame, fright, and anguish, is also compensable, \r\nregardless of whether any physical harm was inflicted on the plaintiff.”); \r\n<i>cf. Boyles v. Kerr</i>, 855 S.W.2d 593, 597–98 (Tex. 1993)<i> </i>(“Our \r\ndecision [that there is no general duty not to negligently inflict emotional \r\ndistress] does not affect a claimant’s right to recover mental anguish damages \r\ncaused by defendant’s breach of some other legal duty . . . . <i>We also are not \r\nimposing a requirement that emotional distress manifest itself physically to be \r\ncompensable</i>.”) (<span class=\"GramE\">emphasis</span> added) (<span class=\"GramE\">citations</span> omitted). This is common sense: many \r\nexperiences—including some sexual assaults and certain forms of torture—are \r\nextremely traumatic yet result in no serious physical injury.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Given this, it is not surprising that the Court cites no case holding \r\nthat the First Amendment bars claims for emotional damages arising from assault, \r\nbattery, false imprisonment, or similar torts. I can cite a case, heavily relied \r\nupon by the Court, for the opposite proposition: <i>Tilton</i>. There we held \r\nthat “[t]he Free Exercise Clause never has immunized clergy or churches from all \r\ncauses of action alleging <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> conduct,” and cited \r\n<span class=\"SpellE\"><i>Meroni</i></span><i> v. Holy Spirit Association for the \r\nUnification of World Christianity,</i> 119 A.D.2d 200 (N.Y. App. Div. 1986), \r\nwith the parenthetical “‘[A] church may be held liable for intentional <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> conduct on behalf of its officers or members, even \r\nif that conduct is carried out as part of the Church’s religious practices.’” \r\n<i>Tilton</i>, <span class=\"GramE\">925 S.W.2d at 677</span>. The Court cites \r\n<i>Cantwell v. Connecticut</i>, 310 <span class=\"SpellE\">U.S.at</span> 310, for \r\nthe proposition that “intangible harms” are “insufficient to impose civil or \r\ncriminal liability.” __ S.W.3d at __. The <address><i>Cantwell </i>Court</address>, however, found in \r\nthat case “no assault or threatening of bodily harm, no truculent bearing, no \r\nintentional discourtesy, no personal abuse,” and made clear that “violence and \r\nbreaches of the peace,” such as occurred in this case, may be punished. \r\n<i>Cantwell, </i>310 U.S. at 310. The Court also discusses \r\n<i>Paul v. Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society of New York, Inc.</i>, 819 F.2d \r\n875 (9th Cir. 1987), but that case rested on the fact that “[n]o physical \r\nassault or battery occurred.” <i>Paul</i>,<i> </i><span class=\"GramE\">819 F.2d at \r\n883</span>. Similarly, in <i>Westbrook v. Penley</i>, we cited the “[n]o \r\nphysical assault” language from <i>Paul</i> and stated that the act at issue was \r\nnot “an intentional tort that endangered <span class=\"SpellE\">Penley’s</span> or \r\nthe public’s health or safety.” <span class=\"GramE\">231 S.W.3d 389, 404 \r\n(Tex. \r\n2007).</span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[4]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>I agree with the Court that certain claims for emotional damages are \r\nbarred by the First Amendment—if Schubert were merely complaining of being \r\nexpelled from the church, she would have no claim in the civil courts. But \r\nagain, this case, as it was tried, is not about beliefs or “intangible harms”—it \r\nis about violent action—specifically, twice pinning a screaming, crying teenage \r\ngirl to the floor for extended periods of time. That was how it was presented to \r\nthe jury, which <i>heard almost nothing about religion during the trial </i>due \r\nto the trial court’s diligent attempt to circumvent First Amendment problems and \r\nto honor the court of appeals’ mandamus ruling that neither side introduce \r\nreligion as a reason for Laura’s restraint.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[5]</span></span><span></span><span></span> Indeed, the trial court told the jury at \r\nthe beginning of the case that “the Court of Appeals, the appellate courts, have \r\ninstructed us that we don’t get into spiritual matters because it would violate \r\nthe [E]<span class=\"SpellE\">stablishment</span> [C]<span class=\"SpellE\">lause</span> \r\nof the First Amendment of the Constitution,” and later repeated this \r\ninstruction. That the Court looks to a dictionary for evidence of Pleasant \r\nGlade’s beliefs and practices is proof of the trial court’s success in keeping \r\nreligion out of the courtroom. <i>See </i>__ S.W.3d at __, n. 2. Thus, the \r\nCourt’s assertion that assessing emotional damages against Pleasant Glade for \r\nengaging in these religious practices “would . . . embroil this Court in an \r\nassessment of the propriety of those religious beliefs” is belied by the conduct \r\nof this very case: Schubert testified that she was “grabbed” after collapsing \r\ndue to illness; Pleasant Glade contested that version of events without \r\nreference to demons, “laying of hands,” or other religious subjects, __ S.W.3d \r\nat __; and the jury was able to award damages without considering—or even being \r\ninformed of—Pleasant Glade’s beliefs.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[6]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Further, although the Court chooses to conduct its own inquiry into the \r\nrole of “laying hands” in Pleasant Glade’s religion,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[7]</span></span><span></span><span></span> and attempts to limit its holding by \r\nstating that “religious practices that threaten the public’s health, safety, or \r\ngeneral welfare cannot be tolerated,” and thus that there may be some cases in \r\nwhich emotional damages are available as a consequence of religiously motivated \r\nconduct, __ S.W.3d at __, any religious motivation Pleasant Glade may have had \r\nis irrelevant to our consideration. The tort of false imprisonment is a \r\nreligiously neutral law of general applicability, and the First Amendment \r\nprovides no protection against it. <i>Employment Div. v. Smith</i>, 494 \r\nU.S. 872, 879 (1990) (“[T]he right of \r\nfree exercise does not relieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a \r\nvalid and neutral law of general applicability on the ground that the law \r\nproscribes (or prescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or \r\nproscribes).\") (<span class=\"GramE\">citations</span> omitted); <i>Moses v. Diocese \r\nof Colo.</i>, 863 P.2d 310, 320 (Colo. 1993) (“Application of a secular \r\nstandard to secular conduct that is <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> is not \r\nprohibited by the Constitution.”). The <address><i>Smith </i>Court</address> emphatically rejected \r\nthe proposition that the First Amendment alone—without being coupled to another \r\nconstitutional protection, such as the freedom of speech, the press, or to \r\ndirect the education of one’s children, 494 U.S. at \r\n881—“could excuse [an individual] from compliance,”<i> id. </i><span class=\"GramE\">at</span> 879, with a general applicable law:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Laws . . . \r\nare made for the government of actions, and while they cannot interfere with \r\nmere religious belief and opinions, they may with practices. . . .

To permit \r\nthis would be to make the professed doctrines of religious belief superior to \r\nthe law of the land, and in effect to permit every citizen to become a law unto \r\n<span class=\"GramE\">himself</span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>Id.</i><i> </i>at 879 (quoting <i>Reynolds v. \r\nUnited States<span>,</span><span> \r\n98 U.S.</span><span> 145, 166–67 (1878)).<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[8]</span></span><span></span><span></span></span></i></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>To be clear, even if it had been proven at trial that Pleasant Glade’s \r\nreligion demanded that Schubert be restrained, the First Amendment would provide \r\nno defense—we simply need not evaluate the validity of Pleasant Glade’s \r\nreligious beliefs, or even inquire into the assailants’ motives, to hold \r\nPleasant Glade liable for its intentionally <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> \r\nconduct.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[9]</span></span><span></span><span></span> And while the Court suggests that \r\nimposing this liability would have a “chilling effect” on the church’s beliefs, \r\n__ S.W.3d at __, constitutional protection for illegal or <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> conduct cannot be bootstrapped from the protection \r\nof beliefs where it does not otherwise exist. <span class=\"GramE\">Further, the \r\nCourt’s threat to “health, safety, or general welfare” test for liability for \r\nreligiously motivated acts is almost identical to the “substantial threat to \r\npublic safety, peace or order” language from <span class=\"SpellE\"><i>Sherbert</i></span><i> v. <span class=\"SpellE\">Verner</span></i>, \r\n374 U.S. 398, 403 (1963).</span> In \r\n<i>Smith</i>, however, the Court expressly rejected the application of <span class=\"SpellE\"><i>Sherbert</i></span>, which developed out of an unemployment \r\ncompensation case, to “generally applicable prohibitions of socially harmful \r\nconduct.” <i>Smith</i>, 494 U.S. at 885.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[10]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>And even under the Court’s erroneous standard, it is hard to see why this \r\ncase would not qualify. The torts of false imprisonment and assault both have \r\nsubstantially similar criminal analogs, <i>see </i><span>Tex. Penal Code </span>§§ 20.02 (“Unlawful \r\nRestraint”), 22.01 (“Assault”), and it cannot be seriously argued from this \r\nrecord that Pleasant Glade’s conduct did not threaten Schubert’s welfare. It is \r\ndifficult to determine what <i>would</i> meet the Court’s standard, not least \r\nbecause the Court offers no analysis beyond its declaration that “this is not \r\nsuch a case.” Finally, the Court hints that it might have found liability here \r\nif Schubert had been a passerby, but that “religious practices that might offend \r\nthe rights or sensibilities of a non-believer outside the church are entitled to \r\ngreater latitude when applied to an adherent within the church.” <span class=\"GramE\">__ S.W.3d at __.</span> There is a kernel of truth in this \r\nstatement, but the Court’s formulation is imprecise and overbroad. Members of \r\nreligious groups routinely and impliedly consent to a variety of faith-based \r\npractices. Accordingly, implied consent could, in many circumstances, extend to \r\nphysical encounters like baptisms and to other practices congregants embrace as \r\npart of their faith. And perhaps this type of implied consent could, in some \r\ncircumstances, extend to being pinned to the floor for hours at a time despite \r\nthe member’s explicit, contemporaneous withdrawal of consent. That question is \r\nnot before us today, however. Consent is a question of fact—<span class=\"GramE\">indeed,</span> lack of consent is an element of false imprisonment \r\non which we have an affirmative jury finding in this case. Pleasant Glade did \r\nnot challenge that finding at the court of appeals, and does not raise it here. \r\nNevertheless, the Court treats church membership as an across the board buffer \r\nto tort liability.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[11]</span></span><span></span><span></span> The problems with this approach are \r\nobvious. It is impossible to apply the Court’s standard in the absence of \r\nfactual development or determination in the trial court. We are in no position \r\nto decide that the ordeal to which Schubert was subjected was so “expected” and \r\n“accepted by those in the church” as to overcome Schubert’s vehement denial of \r\nconsent at the time of the incidents. <span class=\"GramE\">__ S.W.3d at __.</span> \r\nFurther, the scant evidence does not support the Court’s conclusion. Senior \r\nPastor <span class=\"SpellE\">McCutchen</span>, in his affidavit quoted by the \r\nCourt, speaks of “lay[<span class=\"SpellE\">ing</span>] hands” and of church \r\nmembers “faint[<span class=\"SpellE\">ing</span>] into semi-consciousness, and \r\nsometimes <span class=\"GramE\">l[</span><span class=\"SpellE\">ying</span>] down on the \r\nfloor of our church.” <span class=\"GramE\"><i>Id.</i></span><span class=\"GramE\"><i> \r\n</i>at __.</span> This is far removed from the incident described by Schubert, \r\nwhich we must take as true even if Pleasant Glade had properly raised this \r\nissue,<i> City of Keller v. Wilson</i>, 168 S.W.3d 802, 827 (Tex. 2005) \r\n(“[L]<span class=\"SpellE\">egal</span>-sufficiency review in the proper light must \r\ncredit favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregard contrary \r\nevidence unless reasonable jurors could not.”), and lends no credence to the \r\nCourt’s consent theory.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>B</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To the extent \r\nthat this case presents any First Amendment problems, I believe they lie in the \r\nfact that Schubert was traumatized not only by the false imprisonment viewed in \r\nisolation, but also by the religious content of that experience. Thus, because \r\none of Schubert’s experts, Dr. <span class=\"SpellE\">Helge</span>, testified as to \r\nthe whole of Schubert’s mental anguish, the jury may have awarded damages \r\nstemming in part from the religious nature of the events in question. <span class=\"GramE\">__ S.W.3d at __.</span> This is prohibited by the First Amendment. \r\n<i>Paul</i>, <span class=\"GramE\">819 F.2d at 883</span>. As discussed above, \r\nhowever, the general rule in Texas is that plaintiffs may recover mental \r\nanguish damages resulting directly from certain types of intentional torts, \r\nincluding false imprisonment. Thus, the difficulty in this type of hybrid case \r\nlies in separating the wheat from the chaff.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>The Court solves this dilemma not by extracting the religious from the \r\nsecular, but by binding them together and then dismissing the case for lack of \r\njurisdiction. I would, instead, treat Pleasant Glade’s First Amendment argument \r\nas an affirmative defense that must be raised at trial. <i>See </i><span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 94; <i>cf. Tilton</i>, \r\n925 S.W.2d at 677 (“[W]hen a plaintiff's suit implicates a defendant’s free \r\nexercise rights, the defendant may assert the First Amendment as an affirmative \r\ndefense to the claims against him.”). A jury could then be instructed to award \r\ndamages only for the mental anguish the plaintiff would have suffered had the \r\ntort been committed by a secular actor in a secular setting. Juries are \r\nfrequently asked to exclude certain sources of injury—in this case religious \r\nsources—when calculating damages, and this procedure would allow plaintiffs’ \r\nsecular claims to go forward while protecting defendants’ First Amendment \r\nrights. <i>See </i><span>Comm. on Pattern Jury \r\nCharges, State Bar of Tex.,</span> <span>Texas \r\nPattern Jury Charges—General Negligence &amp; Intentional Personal Torts</span> \r\nPJC 8.7 (2006) Personal Injury Damages—Exclusionary Instruction for Other \r\nCondition (“Do not include any amount for any condition <i>not resulting \r\nfrom</i> the occurrence in question”) (emphasis original), &amp; <span class=\"SpellE\">cmt</span>. (“If it would add clarity in the individual case, an \r\ninstruction not to consider specific, named . . . conditions would be proper, if \r\nrequested.”); <i>see also id. </i><span class=\"GramE\">at</span> PJC 8.8 Personal \r\nInjury Damages—Exclusionary Instruction for Preexisting Condition That Is \r\nAggravated, 8.9 Personal Injury Damages—Exclusionary Instruction for Failure to \r\nMitigate. Further, if the case is tried without reference to religion, making an \r\nexclusionary instruction potentially confusing or prejudicial, <span class=\"GramE\">the</span> trial court could in these situations include a proximate \r\ncause question, which includes an element of <span class=\"SpellE\">foreseeability</span>. <i>See id.</i> <span class=\"GramE\">at</span> \r\nPJC 2.4 Proximate Cause (“[T]he act or omission complained of must be such that \r\na person using ordinary care would have foreseen that the event, or some similar \r\nevent, might reasonably result <span class=\"SpellE\">therefrom</span>.”) (<span class=\"GramE\">emphasis</span> omitted). Thus, the jury (not being aware of any \r\nreligious aspect of the case) would find only damages reasonably connected to \r\nthe secular assault.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Pleasant Glade, however, did not request any such instruction, and this \r\nomission bars relief.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[12]</span></span><span></span><span></span> <i>See </i><span>Tex. R. Civ. P. 278</span> (“Failure to submit \r\na definition or instruction shall not be deemed a ground for reversal of the \r\njudgment unless a substantially correct definition or instruction has been \r\nrequested in writing and tendered by the party complaining of the judgment.”). \r\nFurther, while the Court points to Dr. <span class=\"SpellE\">Helge’s</span> \r\ntestimony as proof that Schubert’s religious and secular damages are \r\ninextricably intertwined, another expert, Dr. Millie <span class=\"SpellE\">Astin</span>, specifically stated that she <i>could</i> separate \r\nthe two. And Schubert testified that while she was being restrained she was \r\nafraid she \"was being injured\" and that she \"might die\"—trauma clearly \r\nassociated with the act of restraint itself. Although segregating the religious \r\nfrom the secular may sometimes be difficult, it can and should be done. <i>See \r\nJones v. Wolf</i>, 443 U.S. 595, 604 (1979).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>III</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Because I \r\nwould not dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, I would address Pleasant Glade’s \r\nargument that the trial court erred in allowing expert testimony on, and \r\nrecovery for, Schubert’s diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder. However, \r\nbecause the other evidence of Schubert’s mental anguish, including “angry \r\noutbursts, weight loss, sleeplessness, nightmares, hallucinations, \r\nself-mutilation, fear of abandonment, and agoraphobia,” 174 S.W.3d at 393, is \r\nsufficient to support the jury’s award, I cannot say that the error, if any, \r\n“probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment.”<span> Tex. <span class=\"GramE\">R. App. P.<span> 61.1(a); <i>Nissan Motor Co. v. Armstrong</i>, 145 \r\nS.W.3d 131, 144 (Tex. 2004).</span></span></span> It is \r\ntherefore not necessary to consider Pleasant Glade’s claims in any detail.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>IV</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Pleasant \r\nGlade also contends that the trial court erred in refusing to submit their <i>in \r\nloco <span class=\"SpellE\">parentis</span> </i>defense to the jury, and that the \r\nFirst Amendment required a finding of actual malice to support the jury’s award \r\nof mental anguish damages. In a cross petition for review, Schubert argues that \r\nthe court of appeals erred in concluding there was no evidence to support a \r\nfinding that Laura’s loss of earning capacity was foreseeable and proximately \r\ncaused by Pleasant Glade’s conduct. I agree with the court of appeals’ \r\nconclusions on these issues.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>V</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Court \r\ntoday essentially bars all recovery for mental anguish damages stemming from \r\nallegedly religiously motivated, intentional invasions of bodily integrity \r\ncommitted against members of a religious group. This overly broad holding not \r\nonly conflicts with well-settled legal and constitutional principles, it will \r\nalso prove to be dangerous in practice. Texas courts have been and will continue to be \r\nconfronted with cases in which a congregant suffers physical or psychological \r\ninjury as a result of violent or unlawful, but religiously sanctioned, acts. In \r\nthese cases, the Court’s holding today will force the lower courts to deny the \r\nplaintiff recovery of emotional damages if the defendant alleges that some \r\nportion thereof stemmed from the religious content of the experience—unless the \r\ntrial court is able to anticipate that the case will fall under the Court’s \r\nrather vague exception. <i>See </i>__ S.W.3d at __ (“[W]e can imagine \r\ncircumstances under which an adherent might have a claim for compensable \r\nemotional damages as a consequence of religiously motivated conduct.”).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>I would affirm the court of appeals’ judgment.

This sweeping immunity is inconsistent \r\nwith United States Supreme Court precedent and extends far beyond the \r\nprotections our Constitution affords religious conduct. The First Amendment \r\nguards religious liberty; it does not sanction intentional abuse in religion’s \r\nname. Because the Court’s holding precludes recovery of emotional damages—even \r\nfor assault and other serious torts—where the defendant alleges that the \r\nunderlying assault was religious in nature, I respectfully dissent.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><p> </p></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>I</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Ironically, much of my analysis mirrors that found in Pleasant Glade’s \r\nearlier plea to the court of appeals. <i>See, e.g., infra </i>note 9. In its \r\nsuccessful petition for a writ of mandamus, Pleasant Glade conceded that \r\nSchubert’s claim for assault, battery, and false imprisonment presented a \r\n“‘secular controversy’ and does not come within the protection of the First \r\nAmendment. That is, no church or pastor can use the First Amendment as an excuse \r\nto cause bodily injury to any person.” In the subsequent appeal, the court of \r\nappeals held that Pleasant Glade, having received mandamus relief to exclude \r\nreligious references at trial, was precluded from raising a First Amendment \r\ndefense that it had quite purposefully abandoned. <span class=\"GramE\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1692438\"><a href=\"/opinion/1692438/pleasant-glade-assembly-of-god-v-schubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span>, 407.</span> The Court holds that it is not. In light of the Court’s \r\nultimate dismissal for want of jurisdiction, however, I find the Court’s \r\nprotracted discussion of judicial estoppel puzzling. Subject-matter jurisdiction \r\ncannot be conferred by estoppel, <i>Van <span class=\"SpellE\">Indep</span>. <span class=\"SpellE\">Sch</span>. Dist. v.

That characterization misses the \r\nmark. The United States Supreme Court recently discussed the policy \r\nconsiderations underlying judicial estoppel and the rationale behind the \r\nrequirement that parties succeed in a prior proceeding:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">[C]<span class=\"SpellE\">ourts</span> regularly inquire whether the party has succeeded in \r\npersuading a court to accept that party’s earlier position, so that judicial \r\nacceptance of an inconsistent position in a later proceeding would create <i>the \r\nperception that either the first or the second court was misled</i>. Absent \r\nsuccess in a prior proceeding, a party’s later inconsistent position introduces \r\n<i>no risk of inconsistent court determinations</i>, and thus poses little \r\nthreat to judicial integrity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><i>New \r\nHampshire v. Maine</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118435\"><a href=\"/opinion/118435/new-hampshire-v-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">742</span></a></span>, 750-51 (2001) (citations \r\nomitted) (emphasis added). This Court’s formalistic conception of “prior \r\nproceedings” will fail to capture many situations that implicate these concerns. \r\nIf a party obtains mandamus relief from this Court by taking one position and \r\nthen wins a judgment, also from this Court, as part of the same suit and based \r\non the opposite contention, this no less creates the “perception that either the \r\nfirst or the second court was misled” and presents the “risk of inconsistent \r\ncourt determinations” than if the mandamus proceeding had originated from a \r\ndifferent action. <i>Id</i>. The appropriate test to determine \r\nif there has been a prior proceeding for the purposes of judicial estoppel is \r\nwhether the court has made a ruling—or “determination”—on the issue. <i>Id.</i><i> </i>Thus, \r\nparties would be able to reverse course before the court has ruled, but could be \r\nbound by their previous position once successful (and if the other elements of \r\njudicial estoppel are present).<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[2]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Although I agree, for the reasons discussed below, <i>see infra </i>n. \r\n12, that Pleasant Glade is not estopped under these <span class=\"GramE\">facts,</span> the Court arrives at the estoppel question \r\nimprovidently and reaches a conclusion that will limit Texas courts’ ability to \r\npreserve judicial integrity.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>II</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>A</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The rights \r\ncontained in the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses are among our most \r\ncherished constitutional freedoms.

Connecticut</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103355\"><a href=\"/opinion/103355/cantwell-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> \r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, 306 (1940)). Unfortunately, \r\nthis is precisely what the Court’s holding allows. Here, assuming all facts \r\nfavorable to the verdict, members of Pleasant Glade restrained Schubert on two \r\nseparate occasions against her will. During the first encounter, seven members \r\npinned her to the floor for <i>two hours</i> while she cried, screamed, kicked, \r\nflailed, and demanded to be released. This violent act caused Schubert multiple \r\nbruises, carpet burns, scrapes, and injuries to her wrists, shoulders, and back. \r\nAs she testified, “I was being grabbed by my wrists, on my ankles, on my \r\nshoulders, everywhere. I was fighting with everything I had to get up, I was \r\ntelling them, no. I was telling them, let go, leave me alone. They did not \r\nrespond at all.” After Schubert “complied with what they wanted [her] to do,” \r\nshe was temporarily released. Fifteen minutes later, at the direction of \r\nPleasant Glade’s youth pastor, a different group of seven church members \r\nphysically restrained her for an hour longer. After this experience, Schubert \r\nwas “weak from exhaustion” and could hardly stand.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Three days later, a male church member approached Schubert after a \r\nservice and put his arm around her shoulders. At this point, Schubert was still \r\ntrying to figure out “what had happened” at the previous incident, “wasn’t \r\ninterested in being touched,” and resisted him. As Schubert testified, “I tried \r\nto scoot away from him. He scooted closer. He was more persistent. Finally, his \r\ngrasp on me just got hard . . . before I knew it, I was being grabbed again.” \r\nEight members of Pleasant Glade then proceeded to hold the crying, screaming, \r\nseventeen year-old Schubert spread-eagle on the floor as she thrashed, \r\nattempting to break free. After this attack, Schubert was unable to stand \r\nwithout assistance and has no recollection of events immediately afterward. On \r\nboth occasions, Schubert was scared and in pain, feeling that she could not \r\nbreathe and that “somebody was going to break [her] leg,” not knowing “what was \r\ngoing to happen next.”</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>The jury found that petitioners assaulted and falsely imprisoned \r\nSchubert, and the trial court rendered judgment for her on the false \r\nimprisonment claim. Although this case presents an unusual set of facts, \r\ninvolving physical restraint not proven to be part of any established church \r\npractice, at its core the case is about secular, intentional tort claims \r\nsquarely within our jurisdiction, and I believe the Court errs in dismissing for \r\nwant thereof. I will address each of the Court’s arguments in turn. First, the \r\nCourt states that because Schubert’s “proof at trial related solely to her \r\nsubsequent emotional or psychological injuries,” her “case at trial then was not \r\nsignificantly different from what she would have presented under her claim of \r\nintentional infliction of emotional distress . . . [a] type of claim [that] \r\nwould necessarily require an inquiry into the truth or falsity of religious \r\nbeliefs that is forbidden by the Constitution.” __ S.W.3d at __ (citations \r\nomitted). As an initial matter, this is factually inaccurate. Schubert testified \r\nthat she suffered <i>physical</i> as well as emotional injuries from the \r\nassaults. Furthermore, the jury awarded damages for <span class=\"SpellE\">unsegregated</span> past “physical pain and mental anguish.” \r\nPleasant Glade did not request that the damages be segregated, and so waived any \r\ncomplaint that her physical injuries were not compensable. <span>Tex. R. Civ. P. 274</span>.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>More importantly, the Court’s allusion to intentional infliction of \r\nemotional distress fails to explain how submitting Schubert’s emotional damages \r\nclaim would “require an inquiry into the truth or falsity of religious beliefs,” \r\n“embroil this Court in an assessment of the propriety of . . . religious \r\nbeliefs,” or “<span class=\"SpellE\">decid</span>[e] issues of religious doctrine.” \r\n__ S.W.3d at __, __, __ (citations omitted). In <i>Tilton v.

We explained:</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">One of the \r\nelements that a plaintiff must prove to establish intentional infliction of \r\nemotional distress is that the conduct was \"so outrageous in character, and so \r\nextreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be \r\nregarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.\" With \r\nregard to religious representations, we conclude that no conscientious fact \r\nfinder would make such a determination without at least considering the \r\nobjective truth or falsity of the defendants' beliefs, regardless of what \r\nevidentiary exclusions or limiting instructions were attempted. After all, the \r\noutrageousness and extremity of a representation is, under almost any \r\ncircumstance, aggravated by being false or mitigated by being true.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span></span> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span class=\"GramE\">925 S.W.2d at 681.</span> This case is not like <i>Tilton</i>.

It is a basic tenet of tort \r\nlaw that emotional damages may be recovered for intentional torts involving \r\nphysical invasions, such as assault, battery, and false imprisonment. \r\n<i>See</i>, <i>e.g., Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc. v.

This is common sense: many \r\nexperiences—including some sexual assaults and certain forms of torture—are \r\nextremely traumatic yet result in no serious physical injury.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Given this, it is not surprising that the Court cites no case holding \r\nthat the First Amendment bars claims for emotional damages arising from assault, \r\nbattery, false imprisonment, or similar torts. I can cite a case, heavily relied \r\nupon by the Court, for the opposite proposition: <i>Tilton</i>. There we held \r\nthat “[t]he Free Exercise Clause never has immunized clergy or churches from all \r\ncauses of action alleging <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> conduct,” and cited \r\n<span class=\"SpellE\"><i>Meroni</i></span><i> v. Holy Spirit Association for the \r\nUnification of World Christianity,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></span> (N.Y. App. Div. 1986), \r\nwith the parenthetical “‘[A] church may be held liable for intentional <span class=\"SpellE\">tortious</span> conduct on behalf of its officers or members, even \r\nif that conduct is carried out as part of the Church’s religious practices.’” \r\n<i>Tilton</i>, <span class=\"GramE\">925 S.W.2d at 677</span>. The Court cites \r\n<i>Cantwell v. Connecticut</i>, 310 <span class=\"SpellE\">U.S.at</span> 310, for \r\nthe proposition that “intangible harms” are “insufficient to impose civil or \r\ncriminal liability.” __ S.W.3d at __. The <address><i>Cantwell </i>Court</address>, however, found in \r\nthat case “no assault or threatening of bodily harm, no truculent bearing, no \r\nintentional discourtesy, no personal abuse,” and made clear that “violence and \r\nbreaches of the peace,” such as occurred in this case, may be punished. \r\n<i>Cantwell, </i>310 U.S. at 310. The Court also discusses \r\n<i>Paul v. Watchtower Bible &amp; Tract Society of New York, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488812\"><a href=\"/opinion/488812/janice-paul-aka-janice-perez-v-watchtower-bible-and-tract-society-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">819</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">875</span></a></span> (9th Cir. 1987), but that case rested on the fact that “[n]o physical \r\nassault or battery occurred.” <i>Paul</i>,<i> </i><span class=\"GramE\">819 F.2d at \r\n883</span>. Similarly, in <i>Westbrook v. Penley</i>, we cited the “[n]o \r\nphysical assault” language from <i>Paul</i> and stated that the act at issue was \r\nnot “an intentional tort that endangered <span class=\"SpellE\">Penley’s</span> or \r\nthe public’s health or safety.” <span class=\"GramE\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894886\"><a href=\"/opinion/894886/westbrook-v-penley/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">389</span></a></span>, 404 \r\n(Tex. \r\n2007).</span><span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[4]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>I agree with the Court that certain claims for emotional damages are \r\nbarred by the First Amendment—if Schubert were merely complaining of being \r\nexpelled from the church, she would have no claim in the civil courts. But \r\nagain, this case, as it was tried, is not about beliefs or “intangible harms”—it \r\nis about violent action—specifically, twice pinning a screaming, crying teenage \r\ngirl to the floor for extended periods of time. That was how it was presented to \r\nthe jury, which <i>heard almost nothing about religion during the trial </i>due \r\nto the trial court’s diligent attempt to circumvent First Amendment problems and \r\nto honor the court of appeals’ mandamus ruling that neither side introduce \r\nreligion as a reason for Laura’s restraint.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[5]</span></span><span></span><span></span> Indeed, the trial court told the jury at \r\nthe beginning of the case that “the Court of Appeals, the appellate courts, have \r\ninstructed us that we don’t get into spiritual matters because it would violate \r\nthe [E]<span class=\"SpellE\">stablishment</span> [C]<span class=\"SpellE\">lause</span> \r\nof the First Amendment of the Constitution,” and later repeated this \r\ninstruction. That the Court looks to a dictionary for evidence of Pleasant \r\nGlade’s beliefs and practices is proof of the trial court’s success in keeping \r\nreligion out of the courtroom. <i>See </i>__ S.W.3d at __, n. 2. Thus, the \r\nCourt’s assertion that assessing emotional damages against Pleasant Glade for \r\nengaging in these religious practices “would . . . embroil this Court in an \r\nassessment of the propriety of those religious beliefs” is belied by the conduct \r\nof this very case: Schubert testified that she was “grabbed” after collapsing \r\ndue to illness; Pleasant Glade contested that version of events without \r\nreference to demons, “laying of hands,” or other religious subjects, __ S.W.3d \r\nat __; and the jury was able to award damages without considering—or even being \r\ninformed of—Pleasant Glade’s beliefs.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[6]</span></span><span></span><span></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Further, although the Court chooses to conduct its own inquiry into the \r\nrole of “laying hands” in Pleasant Glade’s religion,<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[7]</span></span><span></span><span></span> and attempts to limit its holding by \r\nstating that “religious practices that threaten the public’s health, safety, or \r\ngeneral welfare cannot be tolerated,” and thus that there may be some cases in \r\nwhich emotional damages are available as a consequence of religiously motivated \r\nconduct, __ S.W.3d at __, any religious motivation Pleasant Glade may have had \r\nis irrelevant to our consideration.

The torts of false imprisonment and assault both have \r\nsubstantially similar criminal analogs, <i>see </i><span>Tex. Penal Code </span>§§ 20.02 (“Unlawful \r\nRestraint”), 22.01 (“Assault”), and it cannot be seriously argued from this \r\nrecord that Pleasant Glade’s conduct did not threaten Schubert’s welfare. It is \r\ndifficult to determine what <i>would</i> meet the Court’s standard, not least \r\nbecause the Court offers no analysis beyond its declaration that “this is not \r\nsuch a case.” Finally, the Court hints that it might have found liability here \r\nif Schubert had been a passerby, but that “religious practices that might offend \r\nthe rights or sensibilities of a non-believer outside the church are entitled to \r\ngreater latitude when applied to an adherent within the church.” <span class=\"GramE\">__ S.W.3d at __.</span> There is a kernel of truth in this \r\nstatement, but the Court’s formulation is imprecise and overbroad. Members of \r\nreligious groups routinely and impliedly consent to a variety of faith-based \r\npractices. Accordingly, implied consent could, in many circumstances, extend to \r\nphysical encounters like baptisms and to other practices congregants embrace as \r\npart of their faith. And perhaps this type of implied consent could, in some \r\ncircumstances, extend to being pinned to the floor for hours at a time despite \r\nthe member’s explicit, contemporaneous withdrawal of consent. That question is \r\nnot before us today, however. Consent is a question of fact—<span class=\"GramE\">indeed,</span> lack of consent is an element of false imprisonment \r\non which we have an affirmative jury finding in this case. Pleasant Glade did \r\nnot challenge that finding at the court of appeals, and does not raise it here. \r\nNevertheless, the Court treats church membership as an across the board buffer \r\nto tort liability.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[11]</span></span><span></span><span></span> The problems with this approach are \r\nobvious. It is impossible to apply the Court’s standard in the absence of \r\nfactual development or determination in the trial court. We are in no position \r\nto decide that the ordeal to which Schubert was subjected was so “expected” and \r\n“accepted by those in the church” as to overcome Schubert’s vehement denial of \r\nconsent at the time of the incidents. <span class=\"GramE\">__ S.W.3d at __.</span> \r\nFurther, the scant evidence does not support the Court’s conclusion. Senior \r\nPastor <span class=\"SpellE\">McCutchen</span>, in his affidavit quoted by the \r\nCourt, speaks of “lay[<span class=\"SpellE\">ing</span>] hands” and of church \r\nmembers “faint[<span class=\"SpellE\">ing</span>] into semi-consciousness, and \r\nsometimes <span class=\"GramE\">l[</span><span class=\"SpellE\">ying</span>] down on the \r\nfloor of our church.” <span class=\"GramE\"><i>Id.</i></span><span class=\"GramE\"><i> \r\n</i>at __.</span> This is far removed from the incident described by Schubert, \r\nwhich we must take as true even if Pleasant Glade had properly raised this \r\nissue,<i> City of Keller v. Wilson</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1987708\"><a href=\"/opinion/1987708/city-of-keller-v-wilson/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">802</span></a></span>, 827 (Tex. 2005) \r\n(“[L]<span class=\"SpellE\">egal</span>-sufficiency review in the proper light must \r\ncredit favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregard contrary \r\nevidence unless reasonable jurors could not.”), and lends no credence to the \r\nCourt’s consent theory.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>B</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">To the extent \r\nthat this case presents any First Amendment problems, I believe they lie in the \r\nfact that Schubert was traumatized not only by the false imprisonment viewed in \r\nisolation, but also by the religious content of that experience. Thus, because \r\none of Schubert’s experts, Dr. <span class=\"SpellE\">Helge</span>, testified as to \r\nthe whole of Schubert’s mental anguish, the jury may have awarded damages \r\nstemming in part from the religious nature of the events in question. <span class=\"GramE\">__ S.W.3d at __.</span> This is prohibited by the First Amendment. \r\n<i>Paul</i>, <span class=\"GramE\">819 F.2d at 883</span>. As discussed above, \r\nhowever, the general rule in Texas is that plaintiffs may recover mental \r\nanguish damages resulting directly from certain types of intentional torts, \r\nincluding false imprisonment. Thus, the difficulty in this type of hybrid case \r\nlies in separating the wheat from the chaff.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>The Court solves this dilemma not by extracting the religious from the \r\nsecular, but by binding them together and then dismissing the case for lack of \r\njurisdiction. I would, instead, treat Pleasant Glade’s First Amendment argument \r\nas an affirmative defense that must be raised at trial. <i>See </i><span>Tex. R. Civ. P.</span> 94; <i>cf. Tilton</i>, \r\n925 S.W.2d at 677 (“[W]hen a plaintiff's suit implicates a defendant’s free \r\nexercise rights, the defendant may assert the First Amendment as an affirmative \r\ndefense to the claims against him.”). A jury could then be instructed to award \r\ndamages only for the mental anguish the plaintiff would have suffered had the \r\ntort been committed by a secular actor in a secular setting. Juries are \r\nfrequently asked to exclude certain sources of injury—in this case religious \r\nsources—when calculating damages, and this procedure would allow plaintiffs’ \r\nsecular claims to go forward while protecting defendants’ First Amendment \r\nrights. <i>See </i><span>Comm. on Pattern Jury \r\nCharges, State Bar of Tex.,</span> <span>Texas \r\nPattern Jury Charges—General Negligence &amp; Intentional Personal Torts</span> \r\nPJC 8.7 (2006) Personal Injury Damages—Exclusionary Instruction for Other \r\nCondition (“Do not include any amount for any condition <i>not resulting \r\nfrom</i> the occurrence in question”) (emphasis original), &amp; <span class=\"SpellE\">cmt</span>. (“If it would add clarity in the individual case, an \r\ninstruction not to consider specific, named . . . conditions would be proper, if \r\nrequested.”); <i>see also id. </i><span class=\"GramE\">at</span> PJC 8.8 Personal \r\nInjury Damages—Exclusionary Instruction for Preexisting Condition That Is \r\nAggravated, 8.9 Personal Injury Damages—Exclusionary Instruction for Failure to \r\nMitigate. Further, if the case is tried without reference to religion, making an \r\nexclusionary instruction potentially confusing or prejudicial, <span class=\"GramE\">the</span> trial court could in these situations include a proximate \r\ncause question, which includes an element of <span class=\"SpellE\">foreseeability</span>. <i>See id.</i> <span class=\"GramE\">at</span> \r\nPJC 2.4 Proximate Cause (“[T]he act or omission complained of must be such that \r\na person using ordinary care would have foreseen that the event, or some similar \r\nevent, might reasonably result <span class=\"SpellE\">therefrom</span>.”) (<span class=\"GramE\">emphasis</span> omitted). Thus, the jury (not being aware of any \r\nreligious aspect of the case) would find only damages reasonably connected to \r\nthe secular assault.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>Pleasant Glade, however, did not request any such instruction, and this \r\nomission bars relief.<span><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\">[12]</span></span><span></span><span></span> <i>See </i><span>Tex. R. Civ. P. 278</span> (“Failure to submit \r\na definition or instruction shall not be deemed a ground for reversal of the \r\njudgment unless a substantially correct definition or instruction has been \r\nrequested in writing and tendered by the party complaining of the judgment.”). \r\nFurther, while the Court points to Dr. <span class=\"SpellE\">Helge’s</span> \r\ntestimony as proof that Schubert’s religious and secular damages are \r\ninextricably intertwined, another expert, Dr. Millie <span class=\"SpellE\">Astin</span>, specifically stated that she <i>could</i> separate \r\nthe two. And Schubert testified that while she was being restrained she was \r\nafraid she \"was being injured\" and that she \"might die\"—trauma clearly \r\nassociated with the act of restraint itself. Although segregating the religious \r\nfrom the secular may sometimes be difficult, it can and should be done. <i>See \r\nJones v.

However, \r\nbecause the other evidence of Schubert’s mental anguish, including “angry \r\noutbursts, weight loss, sleeplessness, nightmares, hallucinations, \r\nself-mutilation, fear of abandonment, and agoraphobia,” 174 S.W.3d at 393, is \r\nsufficient to support the jury’s award, I cannot say that the error, if any, \r\n“probably caused the rendition of an improper judgment.”<span> Tex. <span class=\"GramE\">R.

In a cross petition for review, Schubert argues that \r\nthe court of appeals erred in concluding there was no evidence to support a \r\nfinding that Laura’s loss of earning capacity was foreseeable and proximately \r\ncaused by Pleasant Glade’s conduct.

This overly broad holding not \r\nonly conflicts with well-settled legal and constitutional principles, it will \r\nalso prove to be dangerous in practice. Texas courts have been and will continue to be \r\nconfronted with cases in which a congregant suffers physical or psychological \r\ninjury as a result of violent or unlawful, but religiously sanctioned, acts. In \r\nthese cases, the Court’s holding today will force the lower courts to deny the \r\nplaintiff recovery of emotional damages if the defendant alleges that some \r\nportion thereof stemmed from the religious content of the experience—unless the \r\ntrial court is able to anticipate that the case will fall under the Court’s \r\nrather vague exception. <i>See </i>__ S.W.3d at __ (“[W]e can imagine \r\ncircumstances under which an adherent might have a claim for compensable \r\nemotional damages as a consequence of religiously motivated conduct.”).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>            \r\n</span>I would affirm the court of appeals’ judgment.
