Vol.), § 19-345.3(c) of the Health–\nGeneral Article (“HG”) permits the Attorney General to seek, and a circuit court to grant,\nbroad injunctive relief on behalf of multiple unnamed residents of nursing facilities for\nviolations of HG §§ 19-345, 19-345.1, or 19-345.2, which address involuntary discharges\nand transfers of residents from nursing facilities.\n\nHEALTH — INJUNCTIVE RELIEF — AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE: HG § 19-\n344(c)(5)(ii) requires nursing facilities to cooperate with and assist residents’ agents in\nseeking assistance from the medical assistance program. HG § 19-344(c)(6)(ii), which\ndirects the Attorney General to enforce and prosecute violations of HG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5),\nimpliedly authorizes the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief to enforce a nursing\nfacility’s statutory obligations.\n\fCircuit Court for Montgomery County\nCase No.: 428607V\nArgued: December 5, 2017\n                                      IN THE COURT OF APPEALS\n\n                                            OF MARYLAND\n\n\n\n                                                 No. 28\n\n                                          September Term, 2017\n\n\n\n                                        STATE OF MARYLAND\n\n                                                   v.\n\n                                      NEISWANGER MANAGEMENT\n                                          SERVICES, LLC et al.\n\n\n\n                                          Barbera, C.J.\n                                          Greene\n                                          Adkins\n                                          McDonald\n                                          Watts\n                                          Hotten\n                                          Getty,\n\n                                                 JJ.\n\n\n\n                                          Opinion by Adkins, J.\n\n\n\n                                          Filed: February 20, 2018\n\f       Statutory interpretation is a complex task for any court, and requires careful\n\nreflection upon the text of the statute, and the intent of the legislative body. These\n\ncomplexities are compounded when we consider a statute’s relationship with equitable\n\ndoctrines. The Maryland General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive scheme to\n\nidentify and protect the rights of individuals in nursing facilities in Maryland called the\n\nPatient’s Bill of Rights. Md. Code (1982, 2015 Repl. Vol.), §§ 19-343 et seq. of the\n\nHealth–General (“HG”) Article. In this case, we are asked to decide whether the Attorney\n\nGeneral has authority to request injunctive relief against a nursing facility pursuant to two\n\ndifferent provisions of the Patient’s Bill of Rights.\n\n                         FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n       Neiswanger Management Services, LLC (“Neiswanger”) operates four Maryland\n\nnursing facilities1 located in Anne Arundel County (“New Annapolis”), Montgomery\n\nCounty (“NMS Silver Spring” and “NMS Springbrook”), and Prince George’s County\n\n(“NMS Hyattsville”).2     On December 21, 2016, the State of Maryland, through the\n\nAttorney General, filed a two-count Complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery\n\nCounty against Neiswanger and other related corporate and individual defendants. The\n\n\n       1\n         Md. Code (1982, 2015 Repl. Vol.), § 19-343(a) of the Health–General Article\ndefines a “facility” as “a related institution that, under the rules and regulations of the\nDepartment [of Health], is a comprehensive care facility or an extended care facility.” See\nCOMAR 10.07.09.02.B(6) (defining comprehensive care facility); COMAR\n10.07.09.02.B(13) (defining extended care facility). We use the term “nursing facility” for\nconvenience.\n       2\n        Neiswanger formerly operated a facility in Washington County (“NMS\nHagerstown”), which closed in 2017.\n\fComplaint alleged violations of the Patient’s Bill of Rights, and the Maryland False Health\n\nClaims Act, HG §§ 2-601, et seq. Count One, the subject of this appeal, related to allegedly\n\nunlawful resident discharges from Neiswanger facilities in violation of HG §§ 19-345, 19-\n\n345.1, and 19-345.2, as well as multiple provisions of COMAR.3\n\n       The State alleged that Neiswanger engages in a widespread pattern of unlawful\n\ninvoluntary discharges of residents from their nursing facilities. These practices include\n\ninvoluntary discharges to homeless shelters or “sham assisted living facilities” with\n\noperators who unlawfully exploit residents’ public benefits.         Neiswanger discharged\n\nresidents to shelters or facilities far from residents’ hometowns and families. Many evicted\n\nresidents are ultimately hospitalized, at the State’s expense, with serious or life-threatening\n\nmedical complications caused by the evictions.\n\n       To support its claims about the breadth of Neiswanger’s alleged misconduct, the\n\nState asserted that during a 17-month period, from January 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016,\n\nNeiswanger issued involuntary discharge notices to at least 1,061 residents. In 1,038 of\n\nthese discharge notices, Neiswanger stated that the resident was discharged for failure to\n\npay, or for failure to arrange for payment from Medicare, 4 Medicaid,5 or another third-\n\n\n       3\n         The State alleged violations of: COMAR 10.09.10.03(Q); 10.07.09.04(A)(7);\n10.07.09.09(C) and (F)(4); 10.07.09.10(A)(4), (C) and (D)(8); 10.07.09.11(A)(1)(a)–(c),\n(B), and (C)(2).\n       4\n         Medicare is “a health insurance program which provides for payment for medical\ncare to persons over 65 years of age.” Fort Washington Care Ctr. Ltd. P’ship v. Dep’t of\nHealth & Mental Hygiene, 80 Md. App. 205, 211 n.3 (1989).\n       5\n         The Maryland Medical Assistant Program or “Medicaid” is a “a State program\npartially funded by the federal government, which reimburses nursing homes for their\n\n                                              2\n\fparty payor. By contrast, the State observed that during the same 17-month period, all of\n\nMaryland’s other 225 licensed nursing facilities issued approximately 510 involuntary\n\ndischarge notices. It claimed that “more than 700 people” who “reside in the five NMS\n\nfacilities,” could be affected by Neiswanger’s unlawful discharge practices.\n\n       The State provided detailed factual narratives of eight Neiswanger residents’\n\ndischarges between October 2015 and August 2016. These residents were improperly\n\ndischarged to family members’ homes, homeless shelters, or predatory unlicensed assisted\n\nliving facilities in violation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights. One resident was left outside a\n\nfamily member’s home on a hot day. Residents were sent to unfamiliar locations. In many\n\ncases, Neiswanger failed to communicate with residents and their family members\n\nregarding discharge plans.      Three of the named residents had been evicted from\n\nNeiswanger facilities on multiple occasions over a period of several years.\n\n       The State asserted that Neiswanger unlawfully discharges residents to benefit from\n\nthe public-insurance payment system for residents of nursing facilities in Maryland.\n\nMedicare recipients are entitled to up to 100 days’ coverage in a nursing facility after a\n\nqualifying hospital stay. For the first 20 days of a resident’s stay, Medicare pays the full\n\nreimbursement rate, and an 80% reimbursement rate for days 21 to 100. Some residents\n\nmay be “dual eligibles,” who participate in both Medicare and Medicaid. When a resident\n\nhas exhausted their Medicare coverage, and is eligible for Medicaid, then the\n\n\n\n\npatient related costs of medical care rendered to indigent or medically indigent persons.”\nLiberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Dep’t of Health & Mental Hygiene, 330 Md. 433, 436 (1993).\n\n\n                                              3\n\freimbursement rate shifts to the Medicaid rate. Medicaid provides coverage for long-term\n\ncare in nursing facilities for eligible Maryland residents, and has significantly lower\n\nreimbursement rates than Medicare.\n\n       The Complaint charged that Neiswanger “strives to discharge each resident of its\n\nnursing homes at the precise point in time when the resident can be replaced by someone\n\nelse with a more favorable public health insurance profile.” It does this by maximizing the\n\nnumber of Medicare recipient residents and minimizing the number of Medicaid recipient\n\nresidents. The State alleged that Neiswanger monitors residents’ public health insurance\n\nstatuses to identify candidates for eviction, and times that eviction to coincide with the end\n\nof the resident’s Medicare coverage.        It also claimed that Neiswanger unlawfully\n\ndischarges Medicaid recipients to make room for more lucrative Medicare recipients in\n\nviolation of HG § 19-345(b)(1)(ii).\n\n       The State alleged that in executing these practices, Neiswanger committed multiple\n\nviolations of the Patient’s Bill of Rights and COMAR, including failure to give required\n\nnotices, in violation of HG § 19-345.1(c)(2)(i) and COMAR 10.07.09.10(D)(8). The\n\ntiming of Neiswanger’s discharge notices is also allegedly improper. The State claims that\n\nNeiswanger issued discharge notices before providing residents with notice of\n\nnonpayment, in violation of HG § 19-345(a)(4).          Family members often learned of\n\ndischarges shortly before they occurred, the day of the discharge, or not at all, in violation\n\nof COMAR 10.07.09.09(F)(4).           Neiswanger allegedly fails to properly document\n\ndischarges or provide residents and families with a written statement containing statutorily-\n\nrequired information about discharges.\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       The State also asserted that Neiswanger violates HG § 19-345.2 by failing to engage\n\nin discharge planning, develop appropriate post-discharge plans of care, or comply with\n\nother statutory procedures required before an involuntary discharge or transfer.\n\nNeiswanger allegedly does not arrange for post-discharge medical care for discharged\n\nresidents, or provide a 3-day supply of current medications upon discharge. Neiswanger\n\nalso violates its statutory obligation to place involuntarily discharged residents in safe and\n\nsecure environments, in violation of HG § 19-345.2(c)(2).\n\n       The State also alleged that Neiswanger violates HG § 19-344(c)(5)(ii) (“C & A\n\nClause”) by failing to “cooperate with and assist” residents and their agents in applying for\n\nlong-term care coverage from the medical assistance program. Specifically, Neiswanger\n\n“ignor[es] resident requests for assistance,” “delay[s] the submission of required\n\npaperwork to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene,”6 or “impedes the submission\n\nof the long-term care applications of Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibles . . . .”\n\n       Relying on HG §§ 19-344(c)(6)(iii) (“Enforcement Clause”) and 19-345.3(c)\n\n(“Injunction Clause”), Count One7 of the State’s Complaint sought an injunction to prohibit\n\nNeiswanger from: (1) further violations of HG §§ 19-344–19-345.2 and COMAR\n\n\n       6\n        The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was renamed in July 2017 to the\nDepartment of Health (“Department”). See HG § 1-101(c); 2017 Md. Laws ch. 214, § 1.\nFor convenience, we refer to it as the Department, rather than DHMH.\n       7\n         Count Two of the Complaint alleged that Neiswanger submitted false claims to\nMaryland’s Medicaid program in violation of the Maryland False Health Claims Act. See\nHG §§ 2-601 et seq. Specifically, the State alleged that Neiswanger falsely sought\nreimbursement for discharge planning and related services that it does not provide, and\nfalsely certified compliance with discharge-related provisions of the Patients’ Bill of\nRights.\n\n                                              5\n\f10.07.09; (2) issuing notices of involuntary discharge for failure to pay except under\n\nspecifically delineated circumstances; (3) discharging a resident who is a Medicaid\n\nparticipant or is Medicaid-eligible, without documenting the resident’s or legal\n\nrepresentative’s failure to cooperate in applying for benefits or arranging for\n\nreimbursement; (4) discharging, for non-payment, any resident who has a pending\n\napplication for Medicaid benefits, unless Neiswanger had a good faith basis for believing\n\nthat the resident is ineligible for benefits; (5) discharging any resident to an unlicensed\n\nassisted living facility or incorporating such a facility into a post-discharge plan of care;\n\nand (6) discharging any resident to a homeless shelter, or incorporating such a discharge\n\ninto a post-discharge plan of care, or discharging a resident without an identified discharge\n\ndestination.\n\n       After the State filed its Complaint, but before Neiswanger had responded, the\n\nDepartment issued a Notice of Restrictions on Admissions to Neiswanger facilities,\n\nprohibiting the facilities from admitting or re-admitting residents. After a hearing, an\n\nadministrative law judge recommended that the Secretary rescind the ban. On January 26,\n\n2017, Neiswanger entered into a Consent Agreement with the Department, requiring\n\nNeiswanger to implement changes to its involuntary discharge practices, comply with the\n\nPatient’s Bill of Rights, and install an independent monitor to supervise and ensure its\n\ncompliance with the Consent Agreement.8           Neiswanger, the Department, and the\n\n\n       8\n        On the same day, the State sought a temporary restraining order from the Circuit\nCourt for Montgomery County to block Neiswanger for discharging residents for non-\npayment. The Circuit Court denied the State’s application in an order dated March 15,\n2017.\n\n                                             6\n\findependent monitor, Dr. Daniel Haimowiz, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding\n\n(MOU) dated February 8, 2017, which expired after three months, to implement the terms\n\nof the Consent Agreement.        The MOU set out specific compliance procedures for\n\nNeiswanger and outlined numerous conditions for the independent monitoring.\n\n       Neiswanger and the other defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. After a\n\nhearing, the Circuit Court dismissed Count One of the State’s Complaint for failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief can be granted. The trial court agreed that the allegations in the\n\nState’s Complaint, if true, “would certainly be in violation of the Patient’s Bill of\n\nRights . . . .” But the Circuit Court concluded that the Injunction Clause does not authorize\n\n“a broad sweeping injunction against these Defendants’ company practices.”                  It\n\ndetermined, based on the plain language of the statute, that the Injunction Clause authorizes\n\ninjunctive relief only for an individual resident. The Circuit Court also found that the State\n\nlacked authority to sue for an injunction under the Enforcement Clause, because the statute\n\ndoes not specify injunctive relief as a means of enforcement for violations of § 19-344.9\n\n       The State filed a timely appeal pursuant to Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), § 12-\n\n303(3)(iii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which authorizes an\n\ninterlocutory appeal from a court’s refusal to grant an injunction. Before the Court of\n\nSpecial Appeals issued a scheduling order, the State petitioned this Court for a writ of\n\ncertiorari. We granted certiorari to answer the following questions:\n\n\n       9\n        The Circuit Court also dismissed Count Two, the Maryland False Health Claims\nAct, for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted against some of the\ndefendants. Count Two survived against Neiswanger, NMS Silver Spring, NMS\nSpringbrook, and NMS Hagerstown.\n\n                                              7\n\f              1. Did the Circuit Court err in holding that, although Health–\n                 General § 19-345.3 authorizes a court to grant “injunctive\n                 relief” to remedy violations of the discharge-related\n                 provisions of the Patient’s Bill of Rights, the statute\n                 excludes injunctive relief barring “company practices” that\n                 violate those provisions?\n\n              2. Did the Circuit Court err in holding that the statutory\n                 responsibility conferred on the Attorney General by\n                 Health–General § 19-344 for the “enforcement” of certain\n                 of its provisions related to the Medicaid application process\n                 does not authorize the Attorney General to seek, or a court\n                 to grant, a judicial injunction enforcing those provisions?\n\n   We answer both questions affirmatively.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n        The State appeals from the grant of a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted. A court considering a motion to dismiss\n\nmust:\n\n              assume the truth of, and view in a light most favorable to the\n              non-moving party, all well-pleaded facts and allegations\n              contained in the complaint as well as all inferences that may\n              reasonably be drawn from them, and order dismissal only if the\n              allegations and permissible inferences, if true, would not afford\n              relief to the plaintiff . . . .\n\nRRC Ne., LLC v. BAA Maryland, Inc., 413 Md. 638, 643 (2010). The Circuit Court ruled\n\nthat the Injunction Clause did not authorize the kind of broad injunctive relief the State\n\nsought, and that the Enforcement Clause did not authorize injunctive relief at all. Our\n\nresolution of these questions necessitates interpretation of these statutes, which is a\n\nquestion of law. Davis v. Slater, 383 Md. 599, 604 (2004). We review the Circuit Court’s\n\nstatutory interpretation without deference. Id.\n\n\n\n                                             8\n\f                                 Justiciability—Mootness\n\n       We first address justiciability. A case is moot if, “at the time it is before the court,\n\nthere is no longer an existing controversy between the parties, so that there is no longer any\n\neffective remedy that the court can provide.” Frazier v. Castle Ford, Ltd., 430 Md. 144,\n\n162–63 (2013). “An injunction should not issue if the acts sought to be enjoined have been\n\ndiscontinued or abandoned.” Attorney Gen. v. Anne Arundel Cty. Sch. Bus Contractors\n\nAss’n, Inc., 286 Md. 324, 327 (1979). Although we do not generally offer opinions on\n\nmoot questions, City of College Park v. Cotter, 309 Md. 573, 580 (1987), we may address\n\nmoot issues under certain circumstances. See Hammen v. Baltimore Cty. Police Dep’t, 373\n\nMd. 440, 450–51 (2003).\n\n       Neiswanger argues that this case is moot for two reasons. First, NMS Hagerstown\n\nhas closed, and Neiswanger no longer operates the other facilities. Neiswanger asserted\n\nthat “the owners of NMS are out of the picture,” but admitted that its “management services\n\ncompany” and “personnel” were involved in the transition. Second, Neiswanger maintains\n\nthat the Consent Agreement and MOU contain the relief the State initially sought in its\n\nComplaint. The State disagrees. The State also contends that the best place to resolve the\n\nmootness inquiry regarding the transition in management is before the Circuit Court on\n\nremand. Further, the State argues that even if the case is moot, this Court can, and should\n\napply either of two exceptions to mootness: (1) voluntary cessation, and (2) important\n\nissues of public interest, to decide the questions presented.\n\n       A party’s voluntary cessation of conduct, or a change in the factual circumstances\n\nthat formed the basis for seeking judicial relief does not require “dismissal of the judicial\n\n\n                                              9\n\fproceedings on the grounds of mootness where the matter is a continuing controversy or\n\nthe circumstances are likely to recur.” Chase v. Chase, 287 Md. 472, 482 (1980) (Eldridge,\n\nJ., dissenting). As the Supreme Court explained in Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw\n\nEnvtl. Servs., 528 U.S. 167, 189 (2000), the standard for determining whether a defendant’s\n\n“voluntary conduct” has mooted a case is “stringent,” and subsequent events must make it\n\n“absolutely clear” that the alleged misconduct “could not reasonably be expected to recur.”\n\nThe party seeking to prove mootness carries a “heavy burden.” Id.\n\n       A “reasonable expectation of recurrence” may exist when the alleged misconduct\n\nwas a “continuing practice or was otherwise deliberate.”       Sheely v. MRI Radiology\n\nNetwork, P.A., 505 F.3d 1173, 1184–85 (11th Cir. 2007). Mootness is more likely if\n\ncessation was “motivated by a defendant’s genuine change of heart rather than his desire\n\nto avoid liability.” Id. at 1186. This may be shown by the factual circumstances,\n\nparticularly the relationship between the cessation and pending litigation. Id. (collecting\n\ncases). Refusal to acknowledge misconduct tends to support a conclusion that the cessation\n\nwas motivated by a desire to evade liability, leaving a “live dispute” between the parties.\n\nId. at 1187.\n\n       We may also address moot issues if we are convinced that the case contains\n\nunresolved issues of great public concern that “merit an expression of our views for the\n\nguidance of courts and litigants in the future.” Robinson v. Lee, 317 Md. 371, 376 (1989).\n\nAs we explained in Potomac Abatement, Inc. v. Sanchez, 424 Md. 701, 710 (2012), we will\n\ndepart “‘from the general rule and practice of not deciding academic questions,’” only\n\nwhen “‘the urgency of establishing a rule of future conduct in matters of important public\n\n\n                                            10\n\fconcern is imperative and manifest . . . .’” (quoting Lloyd v. Bd. of Supervisors, 206 Md.\n\n36, 43 (1954)). If the recurrence involves the “relationship between government and its\n\ncitizens or a duty of government,” and is likely to evade review in the future, then we may\n\ndecide a question that has become moot. La Valle v. La Valle, 432 Md. 343, 352 (2013).\n\n       The record before the Court does not detail the transfer of management in the\n\nNeiswanger facilities. It is similarly lacking in specifics regarding implementation of the\n\nConsent Agreement and MOU, other than Neiswanger’s assertion of compliance. We\n\nobserve that the State sought relief beyond the terms of these documents, and that the\n\nConsent Agreement only required three months of supervision implemented under the\n\nMOU.10 Given the paucity of the information available to us, we do not conclude that the\n\nfactual circumstances make this case moot. We agree with the State that the best place to\n\nresolve this question is the Circuit Court.\n\n       Even if changed circumstances rendered the case moot, we could nonetheless\n\naddress these questions under the voluntary cessation exception.        The State alleged\n\ndeliberate, unlawful conduct over a prolonged period of time in multiple Neiswanger\n\nfacilities. Neiswanger entered into the Consent Agreement only after the State sued and\n\nthe Department suspended all admissions, and it has never admitted any misconduct or\n\nillegality. As such, Neiswanger has not demonstrated that its allegedly wrongful behavior\n\n“could not reasonably be expected to recur.” Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n            By its own terms, the MOU expired in May 2017.\n\n                                              11\n\f       The Court may address the questions presented under the other mootness exception.\n\nThe legislative history surrounding the enactment of these statutes, discussed infra,\n\ndemonstrates that the Maryland General Assembly considered the issues presented in this\n\ncase to be a matter of significant public policy. The Attorney General’s power under the\n\nEnforcement Clause and the scope of the Injunction Clause necessarily implicate the\n\nrelationship between the government of Maryland and its citizens. Further, an involuntary\n\ndischarge may be completed before individual residents can seek effective relief,\n\nparticularly if residents do not receive adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing before\n\ndischarge as required by HG § 19-345.1. Determining the nature of the relief available and\n\nthe extent of the Attorney General’s enforcement powers provides important guidance for\n\ncourts resolving time-sensitive issues, and will avoid duplicative and inconsistent litigation\n\nresults. See Potomac Abatement, 424 Md. at 710–11.\n\n       With justiciability resolved, we turn to the questions presented.\n\n                                 Statutory Interpretation\n\n       “The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real\n\nand actual intent of the Legislature.” Lockshin v. Semsker, 412 Md. 257, 274 (2010). Our\n\nanalysis begins with the plain meaning of the statute. The language “must be viewed within\n\nthe context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or\n\npolicy of the Legislature in enacting the statute.” Id. at 275–76. “If the intent of the\n\n[L]egislature is clear from the words of the statute, our inquiry normally ends and we apply\n\nthe plain meaning of the statute.” Huffman v. State, 356 Md. 622, 628 (1999). “[I]f ‘the\n\nlanguage is subject to more than one interpretation, or when the language is not clear when\n\n\n                                             12\n\fit is part of a larger statutory scheme,’ we try ‘to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the\n\nstatute’s legislative history, case law, and statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the\n\nstatute.’” State v. Ray, 429 Md. 566, 576 (2012) (quoting Friedman v. Hannan, 412 Md.\n\n328, 337 (2010)).     The interpretation must be reasonable, not “absurd, illogical, or\n\nincompatible with common sense.” Lockshin, 412 Md. at 276. We begin with the\n\nInjunction Clause.\n\n                                  The Injunction Clause\n\n       The Circuit Court, relying on State Comm’n on Human Relations. v. Talbot Cty.\n\nDetention Ctr., 370 Md. 115 (2002), reasoned that traditional equitable factors do not apply\n\nif an injunction is statutorily authorized, and the court must be guided by the specific\n\nlanguage of the statute. Applying this rule, the Circuit Court determined that “injunctive\n\nrelief authorized is only for an individual resident, or a specified resident acting on the\n\nresident’s behalf, if an involuntary discharge in violation of the law is imminent or has\n\ntaken place.” Thus, it reasoned, the State was not entitled to broad relief enjoining\n\nNeiswanger’s “company practices” under the Injunction Clause and had failed to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief could be granted. Neiswanger urges this Court to accept the Circuit\n\nCourt’s interpretation of the Injunction Clause—as law that not only authorizes, but cabins,\n\nrelief to actions on behalf of named individuals.\n\n       To the contrary, the State sees the Injunction Clause as containing no restriction on\n\nthe Attorney General’s ability to act on behalf of multiple residents. In its view, when a\n\nviolation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights occurs, at the request of the Attorney General, a\n\ncircuit court would have discretion to exercise its “full equitable authority.” The State\n\n\n                                              13\n\favers that the Circuit Court read the Injunction Clause too narrowly, and ignored the\n\nprinciple that enforcement provisions of remedial statutes should be read broadly to “afford\n\ncomplete relief consistent with the statute’s remedial purposes.”\n\n                         The Language Of The Injunction Clause\n\n       We turn to the language of the Injunction Clause.\n\n              A resident, resident’s agent, or resident’s attorney, or the\n              Attorney General on behalf of the resident, who believes that\n              an involuntary discharge or transfer that violates the\n              requirements of § 19-345, § 19-345.1, or § 19-345.2 of this\n              subtitle is imminent or has taken place may request injunctive\n              relief from a circuit court.\n\nHG § 19-345.3(c).\n\n       The statute accords standing to two categories of parties. The first, a “resident,\n\nresident’s agent, or resident’s attorney” are plaintiffs whose suits would likely redress the\n\nunlawful involuntary transfer or discharge of a specific resident. The second, and the one\n\nat issue here, is “the Attorney General, on behalf of the resident.” We consider whether,\n\nby authorizing the Attorney General to take such action, the General Assembly intended\n\nfor the Attorney General to act on behalf of multiple residents.11 We are unable to find any\n\n\n       11\n           Statutory standing requires determining if the statute at issue “contemplates\nlitigants like [the State] availing [itself] of its remedies.” Suessman v. Lamone, 383 Md.\n697, 712 (2004). The Injunction Clause authorizes the Attorney General to file suit. HG\n§ 19-345.3(c). Because the Complaint is brought under the Clause, the Attorney General\nhas statutory standing. See Suessman, 383 Md. at 712. Neiswanger does not contend that\nthe Attorney General is not a proper party to file suit. Rather, Neiswanger argues that the\nState lacks standing to file suit on behalf of multiple residents and that it is not entitled to\nthe relief it seeks. The State reasons that this Court should not address standing because\nthe Circuit Court did not rule on the issue. Neiswanger’s standing argument is substantially\ninterwoven into the interpretation of the Injunction Clause. In addressing whether the\nAttorney General may sue on behalf of multiple residents, and whether the violations the\n\n                                              14\n\fMaryland cases that have addressed the meaning of “on behalf of” in this context. To\n\nconsider whether the General Assembly intended to authorize broad or narrow enforcement\n\nof the Injunction Clause, we turn to the statutes constituting the Patient’s Bill of Rights and\n\nlegislative history.\n\n                       Legislative History Of The Injunction Clause\n\n       The Injunction Clause was not enacted in a vacuum. It was part of a broad statutory\n\nscheme governing involuntary discharge or transfer practices in Maryland nursing facilities\n\nthat amended the Patient’s Bill of Rights. See H.B. 343, 1995 Leg., 409th Sess. (Md. 1995).\n\nHG § 19-343(b) delineates the General Assembly’s policy behind the Patient’s Bill of\n\nRights:\n\n                       (b)(1) The General Assembly intends to promote the\n                       interests and well-being of each resident of a facility.\n                       (2) It is the policy of this State that, in addition to any\n                       other rights, each resident of a facility has the following\n                       basic rights:\n                               (i) The right to be treated with consideration,\n                               respect, and full recognition of human dignity\n                               and individuality;\n                               (ii) The right to receive treatment, care, and\n                               services that are adequate, appropriate, and\n                               in compliance with relevant State and federal\n                               laws, rules, and regulations . . . .\n\n(Emphasis added). This statement of intent reflects the purpose of the General Assembly\n\nto sweep broadly in according legislative protection to the vulnerable population of nursing\n\n\n\n\nState has alleged are capable of redress under the Injunction Clause, we necessarily resolve\nthe question of standing.\n\n                                               15\n\ffacilities. See 2A Norman J. Singer, Sutherland’s Statutory Construction § 45.9 (7th ed.\n\n2014) (policy section of statute stating general objectives helps court’s interpretation).\n\n       In 1995, the General Assembly, at the “urging of the Attorney General . . . .” Oak\n\nCrest Village, Inc. v. Murphy, 379 Md. 229, 245 n.5 (2004), amended the Patient’s Bill of\n\nRights (“1995 Amendments”).          The General Assembly delegated investigatory and\n\nenforcement authority to the Attorney General in several provisions of the Patient’s Bill of\n\nRights, including the Injunction Clause. HG § 19-345.2(e) authorizes the Attorney General\n\nto investigate, either upon receipt of a complaint, or under independent initiative, whether\n\nan abuse of funds under HG § 19-34612 contributed to a decision to transfer or discharge a\n\nresident, and make referrals to other agencies.13 The Attorney General must also enforce\n\nHG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5), relating to applications to the medical assistance program on behalf\n\nof a nursing facility resident or applicant, which we discuss in greater detail infra. See HG\n\n\n       12\n            HG § 19-346(a)(2) defines “abuse of funds” as the use of a resident’s assets or\nincome:\n\n                [a]gainst the express wish of the resident, if the expenditure\n                was not necessary for the direct and immediate benefit and\n                welfare of the resident; or [f]or the use or benefit of a person\n                other than the resident if the expenditure is not also for the\n                direct and immediate benefit of the resident or consistent with\n                an express wish and past behavior of the resident.\n\nSee also id. (n). This provision may implicate nursing facilities, in addition to the usual\nsuspects for abuse of funds, because residents are permitted to designate facility\nadministrators to handle their funds. See id. (c)(2); (d)–(n).\n       13\n         HG § 19-346(n) contemplates that a local department of social services or the\nSecretary of Aging may also receive complaints, and refer them to a State’s Attorney for\nadditional investigation or prosecution.\n\n\n                                              16\n\f§ 19-344(c)(6)(iii); see also Walton v. Mariner Health of Md., Inc., 391 Md. 643, 672\n\n(2006).\n\n       In the 1995 Amendments, the General Assembly also made substantial alterations\n\nto existing statutes, and enacted HG §§ 19-345.1 through 19-345.3.14 See 1995 Md. Laws,\n\nch. 547, § 1. As we observed in Walton, 391 Md. at 671, the General Assembly passed\n\nthis bill to “safeguard nursing home residents from being involuntarily discharged from a\n\nfacility due to nonpayment.” Proponents of 1995 Amendments sought “to assure the safety\n\nand well-being of vulnerable Marylanders facing the trauma often associated with the\n\ndischarge and transfer process. . . . [because] [p]atients facing discharge may fear that they\n\nwill not receive adequate care in the new location, or may face a new environment which\n\nthreatens their physical or emotional well-being.”15\n\n       The provisions most relevant to the scope of the Injunction Clause are HG §§ 19-\n\n345 through 19-345.2, which provide a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating\n\ninvoluntary transfers and discharges from nursing facilities. HG § 19-345(a) permits an\n\ninvoluntary discharge or transfer from a nursing facility only in certain circumstances:\n\n\n       14\n          The Legislature also expanded the definition of neglect to include “intentional\nfailure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs of the\nvulnerable adult, including food, clothing, toileting, essential medical treatment, shelter, or\nsupervision.” Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), § 3-604 of the Criminal Law Article; see\nalso 1995 Md. Laws, ch. 547, § 1. This statute, formerly Article 27, Crimes and\nPunishments § 35D, has since been modified and renumbered.\n       15\n          Letter from Daniel R. Anderson, Director of the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit,\nOffice of the Attorney General, to Senator Thomas L. Bromwell, Chair of the Maryland\nSenate Finance Committee, Regarding House Bill 343: Related Institutions—Discharge,\nTransfer, and Assets of Residents, at 2 (Mar. 22, 1995).\n\n\n                                              17\n\f              (1) The transfer or discharge is necessary for the resident’s\n                  welfare and the resident’s needs cannot be met in the\n                  facility;\n              (2) The transfer or discharge is appropriate because the\n                  resident’s health has improved sufficiently so that the\n                  resident no longer needs the services provided by the\n                  facility;\n              (3) The health or safety of an individual in a facility is\n                  endangered;\n              (4) The resident has failed, after reasonable and appropriate\n                  notice to pay for, or under Medicare or Medicaid or\n                  otherwise to have paid for, a stay at the facility; or\n              (5) The facility ceases to operate.\n\nThese provisions are generally consistent with federal law and regulations governing\n\ninvoluntary discharges and transfers. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)(A)(i)–(vi) (2012);\n\n42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c)(1) (2018). As amended, HG § 19-345 retained existing protections\n\nfor Medicaid-eligible residents, and added new ones. Id. (b)(1)–(2).16\n\n       HG § 19-345.1(a) established new guidelines for notice and hearing requirements\n\nbefore a proposed involuntary discharge or transfer.17 HG § 19-345.2 was an essential\n\nfeature of the 1995 Amendments. Notes from the testimony of the Director of the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit refer to the implementation of specific practices\n\n\n       16\n          The 1995 Amendments prohibited Medicaid-certified facilities from requiring\nMedicaid-eligible residents to pay as a private resident for any length of time, and retained\nan existing prohibition on involuntarily discharging or transferring residents because they\nreceive Medicaid. HG § 19-345(b)(1)(i)–(ii). A facility that discharges or transfers a\nMedicaid-eligible resident or Medicaid recipient is presumed to be acting in violation of\nthe law, but that presumption may be overcome if the resident was discharged for a failure\nto pay, and was not eligible for Medicaid. Id. (b)(2)(i)–(ii).\n       17\n         Before the 1995 Amendments, HG § 19-345 required the facility to provide 30\ndays’ written notice to the resident, and next of kin or guardian for the resident specifying\nthe reason for the transfer or discharge, as well as afford the resident an opportunity for a\nhearing thereon.\n\n                                             18\n\fbefore involuntary discharge as the “heart of this bill.”         See Related Institutions—\n\nDischarge, Transfer and Assets of Residents: Hearing on H.B. 343 before the H. Comm.\n\non Envtl. Matters, 1995 Leg., 409th Sess. (Md. 1995).\n\n       HG § 19-345.2 established specific procedures to be followed before a discharge or\n\ntransfer, including medical assessments, a “post-discharge plan of care for the resident,” as\n\nwell as written documentation from the resident’s attending physician indicating that the\n\ntransfer is consistent with the post-discharge plan of care, and appropriate based on the\n\nresident’s medical condition. Id. (a)(1). Facilities must provide residents with at least a 3-\n\nday supply of medications, and certain information. Id. (b). A resident must consent in\n\nwriting to a discharge or transfer unless it is consistent with the post-discharge plan of care,\n\nand is to a “safe and secure” environment where the resident is under the care of a licensed\n\nprovider, or a person “who has agreed in writing to provide a safe and secure environment.”\n\nId. (c)(2).\n\n       These statutes demonstrate clear legislative intent to limit involuntary discharges\n\nand transfers, and ensure that when they do occur, they are subject to procedural controls\n\nensuring a resident’s health and safety. See Walton, 391 Md. at 671. Although Maryland\n\nlaw had some protections for residents of nursing homes before the 1995 Amendments, the\n\nnew statutory scheme is more robust, and gives the Attorney General the authority to\n\naddress violations of key provisions. See 1995 Md. Laws, ch. 547, § 1.\n\n       The 1995 Amendments are remedial because they authorized injunctive relief for\n\nresidents who are facing, or have been subjected to involuntary discharge or transfer. See\n\nLangston v. Riffe, 359 Md. 396, 408 (2000) (“[R]emedial statutes are those which provide\n\n\n                                              19\n\fa remedy, or improve or facilitate remedies already existing for the enforcement of rights\n\nand the redress of injuries.” (quoting 3 Norman J. Singer, Sutherland’s Statutory\n\nConstruction § 60.02, at 152 (5th ed. 1993))). See also Lockett v. Blue Ocean Bristol, LLC,\n\n446 Md. 397, 424 (2016). But the legislative history does not explicitly state whether the\n\nGeneral Assembly intended for the Attorney General to be able to act on behalf of multiple\n\nresidents, or the breadth of relief available.\n\n                                 Relevant Federal Authority\n\n       The State asks us to consider Federal authority interpreting remedial federal statutes\n\nthat permit public enforcement based on statutory violations by private individuals. In\n\nUnited States v. Sch. Dist. of Ferndale, Mich., 577 F.2d 1339, 1343–44 (6th Cir. 1978), the\n\nSixth Circuit considered a similar issue under the Equal Education Opportunity Act\n\n(“EEOA”), 20 U.S.C. § 1706 (2012). Section 1706 authorizes an “individual denied an\n\nequal education opportunity” to file a civil action for relief, and further provides that “[t]he\n\nAttorney General of the United States . . . for or in the name of the United States, may also\n\ninstitute such a civil action on behalf of such an individual.”\n\n       In Ferndale, the district court dismissed an EEOA claim for failure to state a claim\n\nupon which relief could be granted because the complaint “did not adequately identify\n\nthose persons ‘on whose behalf’ the action was being brought by the Attorney General.”\n\n557 F.2d at 1343–44. The district court did not require the Attorney General to actually\n\nname the individuals, but sought enough specificity to allow the court to determine whether\n\na particular individual was within the group the Attorney General had sued on behalf of.\n\nId. at 1344. The Sixth Circuit reversed, ruling that § 1706 did not require the Attorney\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fGeneral to identify “all actual or potential victims” who had been denied an equal\n\neducational opportunity, or even specifically identify such an individual in the complaint.\n\nId. at 1344–45. Provided that there was “at least one person arguably denied equal\n\neducational opportunity,” the statutory requirement was met. Id. at 1345.\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, the Sixth Circuit emphasized that Congress had\n\nestablished a “broad role” for the Attorney General in “enforcing the remedial provisions\n\nof the EEOA.” Id. at 1345 n.8.18 The court saw “no reason to read into the statute a\n\npleading rule not specified by Congress that can only have the effect of impeding\n\nenforcement of the Act.” Id. at 1345. It explained that the district court’s narrow\n\ninterpretation of the purpose of the EEOA to protect individual rights was inconsistent with\n\nthe EEOA’s broader purpose of eliminating segregation-era school systems. Id. at 1345\n\nn.9.\n\n       We agree with the State that, for our purposes, § 1706 of the EEOA is similar,\n\nalthough not identical, to the Injunction Clause.19 Both statutes authorize an individual\n\n\n\n       18\n         The General Assembly’s decision to give the Attorney General standing under\nthe Injunction Clause is of some consequence. As we explained in State ex rel. Attorney\nGen. v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., 301 Md. 9, 34 (1983), “the Attorney General is first and\nforemost the lawyer of the State. . . . [whose] duties include prosecuting and defending\ncases on behalf of the State in order to protect and promote the State’s policies,\ndeterminations, and rights.” (Emphasis added).\n       19\n           20 U.S.C. § 1706 (2012) authorizes the Attorney General of the United States to\nfile suit in the name of the United States on behalf of an individual. This distinction does\nnot defeat the comparison between § 1706 and the Injunction Clause. Although the\nAttorney General is acting on behalf of residents under the Injunction Clause, the action is\nalso intended to vindicate State interests and policies. As such, it is reasonable to infer that\nthe Attorney General may sue in the name of the State.\n\n                                              21\n\fcause of action, as well as public enforcement by the Attorney General. Compare 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1706, with HG § 19-345.3(c). Further, like § 1706, the Injunction Clause\n\nestablishes a standard the Attorney General must meet to seek injunctive relief—i.e., an\n\nillegal involuntary discharge or transfer. See Ferndale, 557 F.2d at 1345. And the\n\nInjunction Clause, like § 1706, is a remedial statute. As such, we construe it “liberally in\n\nfavor of claimants to ‘suppress the evil and advance the remedy.’” Wash. Suburban\n\nSanitary Comm’n v. Phillips, 413 Md. 606, 620 (2010) (quoting Haas v. Lockheed Martin\n\nCorp., 396 Md. 469, 495 (2007)).\n\n        Statutorily-Authorized Injunctive Relief And Judicial Equitable Discretion\n\n       To determine whether the Injunction Clause permits the broad relief the State\n\nsought, we consider the effect of a statutory injunctive remedy on a court’s equitable\n\ndiscretion.   Both parties rely on State Comm’n on Human Relations v. Talbot Cty.\n\nDetention Ctr., 370 Md. 115 (2002), but disagree about the application of this case.\n\n       The State argues that because the Injunction Clause does not contain a limitation on\n\navailable relief, Talbot County requires a court to read that provision broadly. It reasons\n\nthat once it has satisfied the statutory standard, the circuit court’s equitable jurisdiction\n\npermits complete relief. Neiswanger contends that Talbot County restricts courts from\n\nexercising equitable discretion in statutorily-authorized injunctions, and the Injunction\n\nClause limits the scope of the relief to redressing wrongs for an individual resident.\n\n       “An injunction is ‘a writ framed according to the circumstances of the case\n\ncommanding an act which the court regards as essential to justice, or restraining an act\n\nwhich it esteems contrary to equity and good conscience.’” El Bey v. Moorish Sci. Temple\n\n\n                                             22\n\fof America, 362 Md. 339, 353 (2001) (quoting Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. Ass’n, Inc.,\n\n361 Md. 371, 394 (2000)). To receive injunctive relief, a plaintiff must demonstrate that\n\n“it will sustain substantial and irreparable injury as a result of the alleged wrongful\n\nconduct.” Id. at 355. Injunctions authorized by statute are, however, distinct from those\n\nissued under a court’s traditional equitable powers. See Talbot Cty., 370 Md. at 128–29.\n\n       In Talbot County, the Maryland Commission on Human Rights alleged that the\n\nTalbot County Detention Center impeded the Commission’s investigation into two verified\n\ncomplaints of employment discrimination. Id. at 123. The Commission sought injunctive\n\nrelief pursuant to Art. 49B § 4 of the Human Relations Commission Article, Md. Code\n\n(1957, 1998 Repl. Vol.), repealed by 2009 Md. Laws ch. 120, § 1, for the duration of its\n\ninvestigation to prohibit the Detention Center from attending confidential witness\n\ninterviews, and from discouraging witnesses from participating in the Commission’s\n\ninvestigation. Talbot Cty., 370 Md. at 124. In the appeal, we considered whether the\n\nCircuit Court had subject matter jurisdiction to issue the injunction, and the propriety of its\n\ndecision to deny the injunction. Id. at 127.\n\n       Talbot County was the first opportunity this Court had to address a court’s\n\ndiscretionary authority in considering injunctions authorized by statute. Id. at 128. We\n\nrelied on federal precedent to determine “the degree of discretionary authority a court\n\nmaintains when considering injunctions sought pursuant to, and authorized by, a specific\n\nstatute . . . .” Id. The statute is the starting point. Some statutes may limit a court’s\n\nequitable jurisdiction entirely and mandate the issuance of an injunction. Id. (citing\n\nTennessee Authority v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 193–95 (1978)). Other statutes may leave\n\n\n                                               23\n\fgreater discretion to a court. Id. at 129 (citing United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers\n\nCo-op, 532 U.S. 483, 496–97 (2001); Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 313\n\n(1982)). In Talbot County, § 4 authorized the Commission to seek injunctive relief “[a]t\n\nany time after a complaint has been filed, if the Commission believes that appropriate civil\n\naction is necessary to preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm from\n\nthe time the complaint is filed until the time of its final disposition . . . .” Id. at 131 (quoting\n\nArt. 49B § 4).       We explained that while § 4 did not eliminate the circuit court’s\n\ndiscretionary authority or mandate an injunction, it “narrow[ed] the circuit court’s\n\ndiscretionary authority by replacing the considerations in equity with the statutory\n\ncriteria . . . .” Id. at 129–30.\n\n       We determined that § 4 granted the circuit court “unmistakable” authority and\n\nstatutory jurisdiction to “issue injunctive relief at any time after a complaint has been filed\n\nwith the Commission.” Id. at 131–32. Relying on federal precedent, we explained that\n\nwhen the Legislature provides opportunities for a party to seek injunctive relief, it\n\n“implicitly establish[es] a standard for courts reviewing these requests . . . .” Id. at 137–\n\n39. Provided the Commission met the standard, the court should have granted the\n\ninjunction. Id. at 139. The standard in § 4, we observed, was “markedly similar” to the\n\ngeneral function of equitable relief—to prevent irreparable harm. Id. at 140.\n\n       In Talbot County, when we characterized traditional equitable factors20 as “largely\n\ninapplicable” we spoke only to the factors relating to a preliminary or interlocutory\n\n\n       20\n         The party seeking an interlocutory injunction must show: (1) a likelihood of\nsuccess upon the merits; (2) that the injury suffered by granting the injunction is less than\n\n                                                24\n\finjunction—recognizing that the injunction authorized by § 4 “share[d] more of the\n\ncharacteristics of a permanent injunction.”21 Id. at 136 (emphasis added). Here, the\n\nCircuit Court misread Talbot County when it concluded that traditional equitable factors\n\nwere “largely inapplicable” in statutory injunctions.          The language of the statute\n\nundoubtedly governs, but it does not invariably displace equitable factors.\n\n       Talbot County teaches us that a statutory injunctive remedy is not necessarily a\n\nlimitation on the scope of available relief. The Legislature authorized the Commission to\n\nseek an injunction when it was necessary to carry out its purpose of investigating and\n\nenforcing the State’s laws prohibiting employment discrimination.               Id. at 142–43.\n\nPermitting the Commission to carry on its investigation without interference was consistent\n\nwith the “ubiquitous nature of our State’s anti-discrimination legislation” and the\n\n“indispensable nature of tools of enforcement it afforded the Commission . . . .” Id. at 144.\n\nThus, the court could afford complete relief in a manner that was consistent with the\n\npurpose of the statute. Id. at 131.\n\n\n\n\nthe injury that would result from refusing to grant it; (3) the plaintiff will suffer irreparable\ninjury unless the injunction is granted; and (4) granting the injunction is in the public\ninterest. See Md. Comm’n on Human Relations v. Downey Commc’ns, Inc., 110 Md. App.\n493, 516–17 (1996).\n       21\n         The State initially sought, and was denied, a temporary injunction. The Injunction\nClause does not specify whether the injunctive relief may be temporary or permanent. But\nthe State asked the Circuit Court to enter a judgment that Neiswanger had violated the\nPatient’s Bill of Rights, and injunctive relief. This appears to be more consistent with a\npermanent injunction, because it would dispose entirely of Count One. See Colandrea v.\nWilde Lake Cmty. Ass’n, 361 Md. 371, 395 (2000) (a permanent injunction is granted after\ndetermination on merits that finally disposes on the action, not because it lasts indefinitely).\n\n                                               25\n\f              The Scope Of Available Relief Under The Injunction Clause\n\n       Talbot County and Ferndale are our guideposts in resolving whether the Attorney\n\nGeneral may seek injunctive relief on behalf of multiple residents, and the scope of\n\navailable relief. Talbot County demonstrates that legislative injunctive remedies establish\n\nstandards for a circuit court reviewing a request for injunctive relief. 370 Md. at 139.\n\nFerndale suggests that a court interpreting a statute like the Injunction Clause that\n\nauthorizes public enforcement should not construe the statute narrowly when to do so\n\nwould be inconsistent with the legislative policy behind the statute. 577 F.2d at 1345.\n\n       Statutes authorizing equitable relief have been subject to an “interpretive principle\n\nthat inserts a presumption into what would otherwise be the standard exercise of statutory\n\nconstruction: we presume that Congress, in statutorily authorizing the exercise of the\n\ndistrict court’s injunctive power ‘acted cognizant of the historic power of equity to\n\nprovide complete relief in light of statutory purposes.’” F.T.C. v. Ross, 743 F.3d 886,\n\n890 (4th Cir. 2014) (quoting Mitchell v. Robert DeMario Jewelry, Inc., 361 U.S. 288, 291–\n\n92 (1960)) (emphasis added); see also Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 5.7(5), at 781 (2d\n\ned. 1993). Once the Legislature has created a statutory equitable remedy, unless a court’s\n\ninherent equitable powers are explicitly restricted by the statute, the court retains the power\n\n“to exercis[e] jurisdiction, to do equity and to [mold] each decree to the necessities of the\n\nparticular case.” Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946) (quoting Hecht\n\nv. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 329 (1944)).\n\n       Applying Talbot County, we consider that the Injunction Clause establishes a\n\nstandard for a circuit court to apply in deciding whether to issue injunctive relief—the\n\n\n                                              26\n\fAttorney General must have reason to believe that an involuntary discharge or transfer in\n\nviolation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights has taken place or is imminent. See HG § 19-\n\n345.3(c). This standard does not operate as a limitation, on available remedies, as\n\nNeiswanger suggests. Rather, it how the legislature has circumscribed the traditional\n\nshowing a party must make before a court may issue an injunction. See Talbot Cty., 370\n\nMd. at 140–41; State ex rel. Office of Attorney Gen., Bureau of Consumer Protection v.\n\nNOS Commc’ns, Inc., 84 P.3d 1052, 1054 & n.7 (Nev. 2004); Dobbs, supra, at § 2.10, at\n\n243.\n\n       The Legislature authorized the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief to carry\n\nout its goals of preventing unlawful involuntary discharges or transfers that threaten\n\nresidents’ health and safety. The statutes identified in the Injunction Clause, HG §§ 19-\n\n345, 19-345.1, and 19-345.2, establish comprehensive policies and practices nursing\n\nfacilities must follow when attempting to involuntarily discharge or transfer residents.\n\nNeiswanger’s proposed narrow reading of the Injunction Clause is inconsistent with\n\nlegislative goals and would impede enforcement of the Patient’s Bill of Rights. See Neal\n\nv. Fisher, 312 Md. 685, 694 (1988) (“A court should not permit ‘a narrow or grudging\n\nprocess of construction to exemplify and perpetuate the very evils to be remedied.’”\n\n(quoting Van Beeck v. Sabine Towing Co., Inc., 300 U.S. 342, 350–51 (1937))); Ferndale,\n\n577 F.2d at 1345. Broad relief, including the ability to act on behalf of multiple residents\n\nand to enjoin company practices that violate the Patient’s Bill of Rights, is consistent with\n\nthe Legislature’s intent, particularly if, as the State alleges here, a facility’s conduct\n\npotentially affects hundreds of residents.\n\n\n                                             27\n\f       Our analysis is consistent both with our mandate to construe remedial statutes\n\nbroadly, see Lockett, 446 Md. at 424, and with our precedent concerning “cases in which\n\ninjunctive relief directly impacts governmental interests.” Fogle v. H&G Restaurant, Inc.,\n\n337 Md. 441, 456 (1995). We have accepted that “in litigation between the government\n\nand a private party, the court is not bound by the strict requirements of traditional equity\n\nas developed in private litigation.” State Dep’t of Health & Mental Hygiene v. Baltimore\n\nCty., 281 Md. 548, 555 (1977). And “‘[c]ourts of equity may, and frequently do, go much\n\nfarther both to give and withhold relief in furtherance of the public interest than they are\n\naccustomed to go where only private interests are involved.’” Space Aero Prods. v. R.E.\n\nDarling Co., 238 Md. 93, 128 (1965), cert. denied 382 U.S. 843 (1965) (quoting Virginian\n\nRy. Co. v. Sys. Fed’n No. 40, 300 U.S. 515, 552 (1937)); see also State Dep’t of Health,\n\n281 Md. at 555–56; Fogle, 337 Md. at 456–57.\n\n       Neiswanger argues that if we interpret the Injunctive Clause to permit the Attorney\n\nGeneral to seek injunctive relief protecting multiple unnamed residents, we would override\n\nthe General Assembly’s delegation of authority to the Secretary of Health and the\n\nDepartment to regulate and enforce nursing facilities’ operating conditions. Neiswanger\n\npoints to the Secretary’s authority to restrict new admissions to a facility for a 30-day\n\nperiod if “the Secretary determines that a life-threatening, health or fire safety deficiency\n\nexists in a related institution . . . .” HG § 19-328(a)(1). We are not persuaded—because a\n\nrestriction on new admissions does not prohibit a facility from illegally discharging\n\nresidents. Thus, there is no conflict between the Attorney General’s authority to act on\n\nbehalf of residents, and the Secretary’s authority to restrict admissions.\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       In addition to authorizing the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief, the General\n\nAssembly also authorized the Secretary to impose civil penalties on facilities for violations\n\nof HG §§ 19-345–19-345.2. See HG § 19-345.3(a). There is no apparent discord between\n\nthese provisions. A civil penalty against a facility affords little, if any, relief for residents\n\nwho have been subjected to, or are awaiting an unlawful involuntary discharge. The\n\nGeneral Assembly clearly intended for these provisions to operate in tandem. We are\n\nunconvinced that the Attorney General’s authority to seek injunctive relief to require a\n\nfacility to comply with its statutory obligations usurps the Secretary’s authority under\n\nstate22 or federal regulations.23\n\n\n\n\n       22\n           Neiswanger lists “enforcement actions” available under HG § 19-360(d)(1)(i)–\n(iv) that may occur “when there has been a violation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights . . . .”\nBut HG § 19-360(d) permits these enforcement actions when “the Secretary determines\nthat a serious or life-threatening patient care deficiency exists and the hospital, residential\ntreatment center, or health care facility fails to correct the deficiency through\nimplementation of immediate corrective action . . . .” Further, the Secretary must consider\na specific list of factors before determining which actions to take. See id. (e)(1)–(5).\nInjunctive relief may offer a more rapid resolution to an imminent or past unlawful\ninvoluntary discharge that is commensurate with the Legislature’s goals of preventing such\ndischarges. The Attorney General’s ability to take action in that arena does not inhibit the\nSecretary’s authority.\n       23\n           Neiswanger cites a number of federal regulations that authorize the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services and the State to take action against long-term care\nfacilities for deficiencies. In addition to terminating a provider agreement, remedies\ninclude: temporary management, denials of payment to a facility for Medicaid, or to a State\nfor Medicare, denials of payment for all new admissions, civil monetary penalties, state\nmonitoring, transfer of residents, closing a facility and transferring all the residents,\ndirected in-service training, or alternative state remedies. See 42 C.F.R. § 488.406(a)(1)–\n(9) (2018). These remedies may resolve a variety of operating conditions that present a\nthreat to resident health or safety, but they do not appear to offer the same remedy the\nGeneral Assembly authorized to prevent or cure unlawful involuntary discharges.\n\n                                               29\n\f       Neiswanger suggests that the nature of the injunction sought by the Attorney\n\nGeneral is “simply unworkable” in light of the possibility that the Secretary might amend\n\nregulations affecting nursing facilities. We are not persuaded. By that logic, courts should\n\nnever issue injunctive relief to enforce provisions of laws because legislatures might\n\nchange those laws, or administrative agencies might issue new regulations. Courts can,\n\nand do, compel performance of a variety of obligations, including compliance with law.\n\nSee, e.g., Virginian Ry. Co. v. Sys. Fed’n No. 40, 300 U.S. 515, 550–51 (1937).\n\n       We hold that under HG § 19-345.3(c), the Attorney General may bring suit on\n\nbehalf of multiple unnamed residents who have been subjected to, or await, imminent,\n\nunlawful involuntary discharges, provided that at least one individual’s statutory rights\n\nhave been violated. Further, a court may issue complete injunctive relief for violations of\n\nHG §§ 19-345, 19-345.1, and 19-345.2.\n\n       We turn to the second question presented: whether the Attorney General’s authority\n\nto prosecute violations of HG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5) permits injunctive relief to enforce the\n\nrequirement in the C & A Clause, that a facility “cooperate with and assist” a resident or\n\napplicant’s agent in seeking assistance from the medical assistance program.\n\n                           Enforcement Of The C & A Clause\n\n       In its ruling on the State’s request for injunctive relief for alleged violations of the\n\nC & A Clause, the Circuit Court explained that although the Enforcement Clause grants\n\nthe Attorney General the responsibility to enforce and prosecute violations of HG § 19-\n\n344(c)(4)–(5), “the use of the word enforcement does not include injunctive relief.” The\n\nCircuit Court reasoned that the General Assembly never intended to permit injunctive relief\n\n\n                                              30\n\fbecause it did not specifically authorize injunctive relief either in the original 1995\n\nenactment, or in subsequent amendments.\n\n       Neiswanger encourages us to adopt the Circuit Court’s reasoning that the failure to\n\nexplicitly identify injunctive relief renders it unavailable. It argues that because the\n\nGeneral Assembly specifically authorized injunctive relief in the Injunction Clause, and\n\ndid not include the C & A Clause in the statutory violations triggering an injunction, “the\n\nGeneral Assembly’s intent is clear that injunctive relief is not authorized for violations of\n\n[HG §] 19-344.” Neiswanger also contends that the Attorney General’s authority under\n\nthe Enforcement Clause is restricted to seeking civil financial penalties against a resident’s\n\nagent, and the C & A Clause is enforceable through other provisions of the Patient’s Bill\n\nof Rights.\n\n       The State responds that an express grant of injunctive relief in one statute does not\n\npreempt injunctive relief to enforce other statutory provisions. Rather, injunctive relief is\n\nimpliedly authorized by the term “enforcement,” and the Attorney General’s authority.\n\nThe State reasons that because there is no other provision to ensure a facility’s compliance\n\nwith the C & A Clause, the Circuit Court’s ruling has rendered the statute unenforceable.\n\n       The Enforcement Clause states that “[t]he Attorney General is responsible for the\n\nenforcement and prosecution of violations of the provisions of paragraphs (4) and (5) of\n\nthis subsection.” HG § 19-344(c)(6)(iii). The C & A Clause states that “[t]he facility shall\n\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\fcooperate with and assist the agent in seeking assistance from the medical assistance\n\nprogram on behalf of the applicant or resident.” Id. (c)(5)(ii).\n\n       Neiswanger is correct that paragraphs (4) and (5) are primarily devoted to the\n\nresponsibilities of agents in applying for the medical assistance program. See id. (c)(4)–\n\n(5). But the C & A Clause is plainly set forth in mandatory terms and should not be ignored.\n\nWe have consistently interpreted legislative use of the word “shall” to “indicate[] the intent\n\nthat a provision is mandatory.” Dove v. State, 415 Md. 727, 738 (2010); Montgomery Cty.\n\nv. McDonald, 317 Md. 466, 487 (1989) (Adkins, J. dissenting). A nursing facility’s duty\n\nto cooperate with and assist a resident or applicant’s agent in seeking assistance from the\n\nmedical assistance program on behalf of a resident or applicant is not discretionary. See\n\nWalton, 391 Md. at 668 (“Section 19-344(c)(5)(i)–(ii) provides that an agent shall apply\n\nfor medical assistance, and that the nursing home facility must assist and advise the\n\nagent in seeking that assistance . . . .”) (emphasis added).\n\n       The General Assembly enacted the Enforcement Clause in the 1995 Amendments,\n\ndiscussed supra. The Amendments modified existing provisions of HG § 19-344(c)(4)–\n\n(5), added new ones, and expanded the statute to apply to residents of nursing facilities, as\n\nwell as applicants. 1995 Md. Laws, ch. 547, § 1. The C & A Clause was enacted in 1988,\n\nsee 1988 Md. Laws, ch. 452, § 2, and was already in HG § 19-344 at the time of the\n\nAmendments. We presume the Legislature was aware of its own laws. See Bd. of Educ.\n\nof Garrett Cty. v. Lendo, 295 Md. 55, 63 (1982).\n\n       But what does “enforcement” mean in the Enforcement Clause? The State and\n\nNeiswanger disagree about whether it encompasses the authority to seek injunctive relief\n\n\n                                             32\n\fagainst a facility to ensure compliance with the C & A Clause. HG § 19-344(c) provides\n\ncivil penalties for agents who “willfully or with gross negligence” violate the requirements\n\nof paragraphs (4) or (5). HG § 19-344(c)(6)(i)–(ii). But it does not list civil penalties for\n\na facility’s violations of the C & A Clause, or specify how the Attorney General may ensure\n\na facility’s compliance.\n\n       “Enforcement” is defined as “[t]he action or process of enforcing,” as well as “[t]he\n\nforcible exaction of a payment, an action, etc.; the enforcing or compelling of (a law,\n\ndemand, obligation); . . . a means of enforcing a sanction.”        5 The Oxford English\n\nDictionary 245 (2d ed. 1989).        Courts consistently use the terms “enforce” and\n\n“enforcement” in the context of injunctive relief to require a party to comply with an\n\nobligation. For example, in Talbot County, 370 Md. at 144, we identified the availability\n\nof injunctive relief as a “tool[] of enforcement” the General Assembly provided the\n\nCommission. See also, e.g., Colandrea v. Wilde Lake Cmty. Ass’n, 361 Md. 371, 395–96\n\n(2000) (enforcing covenants that run with land may be accomplished by injunction);\n\nFitzpatrick v. Michael, 177 Md. 248, 254 (1939) (referencing equity as a means of\n\nenforcement); Bd. of Cty. Comm’rs of St. Mary’s Cty. v. Potomac River Ass’n of St Mary’s\n\nCty., Inc., 113 Md. App. 580, 601 (1997) (enforcement mechanism of a statute leaves\n\ndiscretion to choose means of enforcement, including injunctions).\n\n       Md. Ins. Comm’r v. Central Acceptance Corp., 424 Md. 1 (2011), is instructive on\n\nthe question of whether statutory enforcement authority accorded to a government entity\n\ncarries implied powers.      There, we considered whether the Maryland Insurance\n\n\n\n\n                                             33\n\fAdministration had the statutory authority to issue a cease-and-desist order under the\n\nPremium Financing Title.24 Id. at 14.\n\n       Central Acceptance argued that because the Commissioner had express grants of\n\nauthority to issue cease-and-desist orders in other sections of the Insurance Article, the lack\n\nof the same in the Premium Financing Title, meant that the Legislature did not intend for\n\nthe Commissioner to have such authority. Id. at 31–32. Central Acceptance relied on “the\n\nmaxim of statutory construction, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, meaning ‘to express\n\nor include one thing implies the exclusion of the other, or of the alternative.’” Id. at 32\n\n(quoting Breslin v. Powell, 421 Md. 266, 287–88 (2011)). We rejected this argument,\n\nobserving that the maxim may be easily used “to override the clear intent of the\n\nLegislature . . . .” Id. The statute, and particularly the General Assembly’s directive to the\n\nCommissioner to enforce the Insurance Article, led us to conclude that the Commissioner’s\n\nauthority to issue a cease-and-desist order could be reasonably implied from the regulatory\n\nscheme in the Insurance Article. Id. at 34–35.\n\n       Other cases support implied statutory authority to issue injunctive relief. See So.\n\nRy. Co. v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen & Enginemen, 337 F.2d 127, 132–33 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1964) (statutory command to maintain status quo pending action of administrative\n\nbody sufficient to justify district court’s injunction); Shafer v. United States, 229 F.2d 124,\n\n128 (4th Cir. 1956) (“It is a familiar doctrine that an injunction is an appropriate means for\n\nthe enforcement of an Act of Congress when it is in the public interest.”). Injunctive relief\n\n\n\n       24\n            Md. Code (1996–97, 2017 Repl. Vol.), §§ 23-301 et seq. of the Insurance Article.\n\n                                              34\n\fis a reasonable means to ensure compliance with statutory obligations. See Virginian Ry.\n\nCo. v. Sys. Fed’n No. 40, 300 U.S. 515, 550 (1937) (equitable relief requiring negotiation\n\nwas proper to fulfill carrier’s statutory obligation).\n\n       The statutory language and the above precedent persuades us that we would\n\nundermine the General Assembly’s intent if we were to conclude that the Attorney General\n\nlacks the ability to enforce the C & A Clause. The General Assembly intended to prevent\n\ninvoluntary discharges for nonpayment. See Walton, 391 Md. at 671; see also 1995 Md.\n\nLaws, ch. 547, § 1. As such, HG § 19-344(c)(5)(i) requires applicants, residents, or their\n\nagents to seek assistance from Medicaid. A facility’s compliance is essential to that\n\nendeavor. And “[w]hether an obligation has been discharged, and whether action taken or\n\nomitted is in good faith or reasonable, are everyday subjects of inquiry by courts in framing\n\nand enforcing their decrees.” Virginian Ry., 300 U.S. at 550.\n\n       In Walton, 391 Md. at 672, we determined that a nursing facility could not pursue a\n\nprivate right of action against a resident’s agent, because the Attorney General is\n\nspecifically responsible for enforcement and prosecution of paragraphs (4) and (5) of HG\n\n§ 19-344(c). Although Walton did not consider the extent of Attorney General’s authority\n\nto enforce the C & A Clause, it suggests a broad construction of the Attorney General’s\n\nauthority under the Enforcement Clause. See 391 Md. at 672.\n\n       Given the Attorney General’s exclusive power to enforce agents’ obligations, see\n\nid., it is only logical that the Attorney General’s responsibilities also extend to enforcing a\n\nfacility’s obligation. The Enforcement Clause directs the Attorney General to enforce and\n\nprosecute violations of HG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5), which includes the C & A Clause. The\n\n\n                                              35\n\fGeneral Assembly’s intent to make the facility’s cooperation and assistance mandatory “is\n\nin itself a declaration of public interest and policy which should be persuasive in inducing\n\ncourts to give relief.” Virginia Ry., 300 U.S. at 552. The ability to seek injunctive relief\n\nnecessarily follows.\n\n       Neiswanger’s argument, that the Legislature foreclosed injunctive relief as a means\n\nof enforcing the C & A Clause,25 by explicitly providing for such relief elsewhere, is\n\nsubstantially similar to the one we rejected in Central Acceptance, 424 Md. at 31–32.\n\nExpressio unius est exclusio alterius should never be applied to “override the manifest\n\nintention of the Legislature . . . .” Kirkwood v. Provident Sav. Bank of Baltimore, 205 Md.\n\n48, 55 (1954). Neiswanger’s proposed construction would render meaningless the General\n\nAssembly’s decision to include the C & A Clause in the Attorney General’s enforcement\n\npurview.\n\n       Neiswanger proposes that its interpretation does not leave the C & A Clause\n\nunenforceable because HG § 19-344(q) permits residents and agents to file administrative\n\ncomplaints about violations of HG § 19-344. Upon receipt of a complaint, the Secretary\n\nof Aging must investigate the complaint and report any findings to the complainant, and\n\n\n\n       25\n          Neiswanger also reasons that because the Injunction Clause does not include such\nrelief for violations of HG § 19-344, the General Assembly did not intend to permit\ninjunctive relief for those violations.\n        We observe that the provisions cross-referenced in the Injunction Clause\nspecifically address the guidelines for discharge. HG § 19-344 addresses admissions\nrequirements and residents’ rights. Although we review provisions in the context of the\nstatutory scheme, Lockshin v. Semsker, 412 Md. 257, 275–76 (2010), we do not find this\nargument persuasive. We do not expect the General Assembly to list each provision that\ncould merit injunctive relief.\n\n                                            36\n\fthe complainant must receive an opportunity for a hearing before the Department. Id.\n\n(q)(3)–(4). Although HG § 19-344(q) may serve as an alternate means of redressing a\n\nresident’s complaints, we do not conclude that it is the sole enforcement mechanism for\n\nHG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5) in light of the General Assembly’s explicit directive to the Attorney\n\nGeneral.\n\n       We hold that HG § 19-344(c)(6)(iii) permits the Attorney General to seek injunctive\n\nrelief to require a facility to comply with its statutory obligation under HG § 19-\n\n344(c)(5)(ii) to “cooperate with and assist” an agent in seeking assistance from the medical\n\nassistance program on behalf of a resident or applicant.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       Neiswanger has not met its burden of demonstrating to this Court that the case is\n\nmoot. We hold that HG § 19-345.3(c) permits the Attorney General to seek injunctive\n\nrelief on behalf of multiple unnamed residents who have been, or await, imminent unlawful\n\ninvoluntary discharges, provided the statutory standard has been met. HG § 19-345.3(c)\n\npermits a court to issue complete injunctive relief for violations of HG §§ 19-345, 19-\n\n345.1, and 19-345.2. We also hold that the Attorney General may seek injunctive relief\n\nunder HG § 19-344(c)(6)(iii) to enforce a facility’s obligation to “cooperate with and\n\nassist” a resident or applicant’s agent in seeking assistance from the medical assistance\n\nprogram on behalf of a resident or applicant.\n\n                                          JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT\n                                          OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY\n                                          REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT\n                                          COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS\n                                          CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.\n\n\n                                            37\n\fCOSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY\nTHE APPELLEE.\n\n\n\n\n 38\n\f",

These\n\ncomplexities are compounded when we consider a statute’s relationship with equitable\n\ndoctrines. The Maryland General Assembly has enacted a comprehensive scheme to\n\nidentify and protect the rights of individuals in nursing facilities in Maryland called the\n\nPatient’s Bill of Rights. Md. Code (1982, 2015 Repl. Vol.), §§ 19-343 et seq. of the\n\nHealth–General (“HG”) Article. In this case, we are asked to decide whether the Attorney\n\nGeneral has authority to request injunctive relief against a nursing facility pursuant to two\n\ndifferent provisions of the Patient’s Bill of Rights.\n\n                         FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n       Neiswanger Management Services, LLC (“Neiswanger”) operates four Maryland\n\nnursing facilities1 located in Anne Arundel County (“New Annapolis”), Montgomery\n\nCounty (“NMS Silver Spring” and “NMS Springbrook”), and Prince George’s County\n\n(“NMS Hyattsville”).2     On December 21, 2016, the State of Maryland, through the\n\nAttorney General, filed a two-count Complaint in the Circuit Court for Montgomery\n\nCounty against Neiswanger and other related corporate and individual defendants. The\n\n\n       1\n         Md. Code (1982, 2015 Repl. Vol.), § 19-343(a) of the Health–General Article\ndefines a “facility” as “a related institution that, under the rules and regulations of the\nDepartment [of Health], is a comprehensive care facility or an extended care facility.” See\nCOMAR 10.07.09.02.B(6) (defining comprehensive care facility); COMAR\n10.07.09.02.B(13) (defining extended care facility). We use the term “nursing facility” for\nconvenience.\n       2\n        Neiswanger formerly operated a facility in Washington County (“NMS\nHagerstown”), which closed in 2017.\n\fComplaint alleged violations of the Patient’s Bill of Rights, and the Maryland False Health\n\nClaims Act, HG §§ 2-601, et seq. Count One, the subject of this appeal, related to allegedly\n\nunlawful resident discharges from Neiswanger facilities in violation of HG §§ 19-345, 19-\n\n345.1, and 19-345.2, as well as multiple provisions of COMAR.3\n\n       The State alleged that Neiswanger engages in a widespread pattern of unlawful\n\ninvoluntary discharges of residents from their nursing facilities. These practices include\n\ninvoluntary discharges to homeless shelters or “sham assisted living facilities” with\n\noperators who unlawfully exploit residents’ public benefits.         Neiswanger discharged\n\nresidents to shelters or facilities far from residents’ hometowns and families. Many evicted\n\nresidents are ultimately hospitalized, at the State’s expense, with serious or life-threatening\n\nmedical complications caused by the evictions.\n\n       To support its claims about the breadth of Neiswanger’s alleged misconduct, the\n\nState asserted that during a 17-month period, from January 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016,\n\nNeiswanger issued involuntary discharge notices to at least 1,061 residents. In 1,038 of\n\nthese discharge notices, Neiswanger stated that the resident was discharged for failure to\n\npay, or for failure to arrange for payment from Medicare, 4 Medicaid,5 or another third-\n\n\n       3\n         The State alleged violations of: COMAR 10.09.10.03(Q); 10.07.09.04(A)(7);\n10.07.09.09(C) and (F)(4); 10.07.09.10(A)(4), (C) and (D)(8); 10.07.09.11(A)(1)(a)–(c),\n(B), and (C)(2).\n       4\n         Medicare is “a health insurance program which provides for payment for medical\ncare to persons over 65 years of age.” Fort Washington Care Ctr.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211 n.3 (1989).\n       5\n         The Maryland Medical Assistant Program or “Medicaid” is a “a State program\npartially funded by the federal government, which reimburses nursing homes for their\n\n                                              2\n\fparty payor. By contrast, the State observed that during the same 17-month period, all of\n\nMaryland’s other 225 licensed nursing facilities issued approximately 510 involuntary\n\ndischarge notices. It claimed that “more than 700 people” who “reside in the five NMS\n\nfacilities,” could be affected by Neiswanger’s unlawful discharge practices.\n\n       The State provided detailed factual narratives of eight Neiswanger residents’\n\ndischarges between October 2015 and August 2016. These residents were improperly\n\ndischarged to family members’ homes, homeless shelters, or predatory unlicensed assisted\n\nliving facilities in violation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights. One resident was left outside a\n\nfamily member’s home on a hot day. Residents were sent to unfamiliar locations. In many\n\ncases, Neiswanger failed to communicate with residents and their family members\n\nregarding discharge plans.      Three of the named residents had been evicted from\n\nNeiswanger facilities on multiple occasions over a period of several years.\n\n       The State asserted that Neiswanger unlawfully discharges residents to benefit from\n\nthe public-insurance payment system for residents of nursing facilities in Maryland.\n\nMedicare recipients are entitled to up to 100 days’ coverage in a nursing facility after a\n\nqualifying hospital stay. For the first 20 days of a resident’s stay, Medicare pays the full\n\nreimbursement rate, and an 80% reimbursement rate for days 21 to 100. Some residents\n\nmay be “dual eligibles,” who participate in both Medicare and Medicaid. When a resident\n\nhas exhausted their Medicare coverage, and is eligible for Medicaid, then the\n\n\n\n\npatient related costs of medical care rendered to indigent or medically indigent persons.”\nLiberty Nursing Ctr., Inc. v. Dep’t of Health & Mental Hygiene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1933774\"><a href=\"/opinion/1933774/liberty-nursing-center-inc-v-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436 (1993).\n\n\n                                              3\n\freimbursement rate shifts to the Medicaid rate. Medicaid provides coverage for long-term\n\ncare in nursing facilities for eligible Maryland residents, and has significantly lower\n\nreimbursement rates than Medicare.\n\n       The Complaint charged that Neiswanger “strives to discharge each resident of its\n\nnursing homes at the precise point in time when the resident can be replaced by someone\n\nelse with a more favorable public health insurance profile.” It does this by maximizing the\n\nnumber of Medicare recipient residents and minimizing the number of Medicaid recipient\n\nresidents. The State alleged that Neiswanger monitors residents’ public health insurance\n\nstatuses to identify candidates for eviction, and times that eviction to coincide with the end\n\nof the resident’s Medicare coverage.        It also claimed that Neiswanger unlawfully\n\ndischarges Medicaid recipients to make room for more lucrative Medicare recipients in\n\nviolation of HG § 19-345(b)(1)(ii).\n\n       The State alleged that in executing these practices, Neiswanger committed multiple\n\nviolations of the Patient’s Bill of Rights and COMAR, including failure to give required\n\nnotices, in violation of HG § 19-345.1(c)(2)(i) and COMAR 10.07.09.10(D)(8). The\n\ntiming of Neiswanger’s discharge notices is also allegedly improper. The State claims that\n\nNeiswanger issued discharge notices before providing residents with notice of\n\nnonpayment, in violation of HG § 19-345(a)(4).          Family members often learned of\n\ndischarges shortly before they occurred, the day of the discharge, or not at all, in violation\n\nof COMAR 10.07.09.09(F)(4).           Neiswanger allegedly fails to properly document\n\ndischarges or provide residents and families with a written statement containing statutorily-\n\nrequired information about discharges.\n\n\n                                              4\n\f       The State also asserted that Neiswanger violates HG § 19-345.2 by failing to engage\n\nin discharge planning, develop appropriate post-discharge plans of care, or comply with\n\nother statutory procedures required before an involuntary discharge or transfer.\n\nNeiswanger allegedly does not arrange for post-discharge medical care for discharged\n\nresidents, or provide a 3-day supply of current medications upon discharge. Neiswanger\n\nalso violates its statutory obligation to place involuntarily discharged residents in safe and\n\nsecure environments, in violation of HG § 19-345.2(c)(2).\n\n       The State also alleged that Neiswanger violates HG § 19-344(c)(5)(ii) (“C & A\n\nClause”) by failing to “cooperate with and assist” residents and their agents in applying for\n\nlong-term care coverage from the medical assistance program. Specifically, Neiswanger\n\n“ignor[es] resident requests for assistance,” “delay[s] the submission of required\n\npaperwork to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene,”6 or “impedes the submission\n\nof the long-term care applications of Medicare/Medicaid dual eligibles . . . .”\n\n       Relying on HG §§ 19-344(c)(6)(iii) (“Enforcement Clause”) and 19-345.3(c)\n\n(“Injunction Clause”), Count One7 of the State’s Complaint sought an injunction to prohibit\n\nNeiswanger from: (1) further violations of HG §§ 19-344–19-345.2 and COMAR\n\n\n       6\n        The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene was renamed in July 2017 to the\nDepartment of Health (“Department”). See HG § 1-101(c); 2017 Md. Laws ch. 214, § 1.\nFor convenience, we refer to it as the Department, rather than DHMH.\n       7\n         Count Two of the Complaint alleged that Neiswanger submitted false claims to\nMaryland’s Medicaid program in violation of the Maryland False Health Claims Act. See\nHG §§ 2-601 et seq. Specifically, the State alleged that Neiswanger falsely sought\nreimbursement for discharge planning and related services that it does not provide, and\nfalsely certified compliance with discharge-related provisions of the Patients’ Bill of\nRights.\n\n                                              5\n\f10.07.09; (2) issuing notices of involuntary discharge for failure to pay except under\n\nspecifically delineated circumstances; (3) discharging a resident who is a Medicaid\n\nparticipant or is Medicaid-eligible, without documenting the resident’s or legal\n\nrepresentative’s failure to cooperate in applying for benefits or arranging for\n\nreimbursement; (4) discharging, for non-payment, any resident who has a pending\n\napplication for Medicaid benefits, unless Neiswanger had a good faith basis for believing\n\nthat the resident is ineligible for benefits; (5) discharging any resident to an unlicensed\n\nassisted living facility or incorporating such a facility into a post-discharge plan of care;\n\nand (6) discharging any resident to a homeless shelter, or incorporating such a discharge\n\ninto a post-discharge plan of care, or discharging a resident without an identified discharge\n\ndestination.\n\n       After the State filed its Complaint, but before Neiswanger had responded, the\n\nDepartment issued a Notice of Restrictions on Admissions to Neiswanger facilities,\n\nprohibiting the facilities from admitting or re-admitting residents. After a hearing, an\n\nadministrative law judge recommended that the Secretary rescind the ban. On January 26,\n\n2017, Neiswanger entered into a Consent Agreement with the Department, requiring\n\nNeiswanger to implement changes to its involuntary discharge practices, comply with the\n\nPatient’s Bill of Rights, and install an independent monitor to supervise and ensure its\n\ncompliance with the Consent Agreement.8           Neiswanger, the Department, and the\n\n\n       8\n        On the same day, the State sought a temporary restraining order from the Circuit\nCourt for Montgomery County to block Neiswanger for discharging residents for non-\npayment. The Circuit Court denied the State’s application in an order dated March 15,\n2017.\n\n                                             6\n\findependent monitor, Dr. Daniel Haimowiz, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding\n\n(MOU) dated February 8, 2017, which expired after three months, to implement the terms\n\nof the Consent Agreement.        The MOU set out specific compliance procedures for\n\nNeiswanger and outlined numerous conditions for the independent monitoring.\n\n       Neiswanger and the other defendants moved to dismiss the Complaint. After a\n\nhearing, the Circuit Court dismissed Count One of the State’s Complaint for failure to state\n\na claim upon which relief can be granted. The trial court agreed that the allegations in the\n\nState’s Complaint, if true, “would certainly be in violation of the Patient’s Bill of\n\nRights . . . .” But the Circuit Court concluded that the Injunction Clause does not authorize\n\n“a broad sweeping injunction against these Defendants’ company practices.”                  It\n\ndetermined, based on the plain language of the statute, that the Injunction Clause authorizes\n\ninjunctive relief only for an individual resident. The Circuit Court also found that the State\n\nlacked authority to sue for an injunction under the Enforcement Clause, because the statute\n\ndoes not specify injunctive relief as a means of enforcement for violations of § 19-344.9\n\n       The State filed a timely appeal pursuant to Md. Code (1973, 2013 Repl. Vol.), § 12-\n\n303(3)(iii) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which authorizes an\n\ninterlocutory appeal from a court’s refusal to grant an injunction.

Did the Circuit Court err in holding that the statutory\n                 responsibility conferred on the Attorney General by\n                 Health–General § 19-344 for the “enforcement” of certain\n                 of its provisions related to the Medicaid application process\n                 does not authorize the Attorney General to seek, or a court\n                 to grant, a judicial injunction enforcing those provisions?\n\n   We answer both questions affirmatively.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n        The State appeals from the grant of a motion to dismiss a complaint for failure to\n\nstate a claim upon which relief can be granted.

First, NMS Hagerstown\n\nhas closed, and Neiswanger no longer operates the other facilities. Neiswanger asserted\n\nthat “the owners of NMS are out of the picture,” but admitted that its “management services\n\ncompany” and “personnel” were involved in the transition. Second, Neiswanger maintains\n\nthat the Consent Agreement and MOU contain the relief the State initially sought in its\n\nComplaint. The State disagrees. The State also contends that the best place to resolve the\n\nmootness inquiry regarding the transition in management is before the Circuit Court on\n\nremand. Further, the State argues that even if the case is moot, this Court can, and should\n\napply either of two exceptions to mootness: (1) voluntary cessation, and (2) important\n\nissues of public interest, to decide the questions presented.\n\n       A party’s voluntary cessation of conduct, or a change in the factual circumstances\n\nthat formed the basis for seeking judicial relief does not require “dismissal of the judicial\n\n\n                                              9\n\fproceedings on the grounds of mootness where the matter is a continuing controversy or\n\nthe circumstances are likely to recur.” Chase v.

It is similarly lacking in specifics regarding implementation of the\n\nConsent Agreement and MOU, other than Neiswanger’s assertion of compliance. We\n\nobserve that the State sought relief beyond the terms of these documents, and that the\n\nConsent Agreement only required three months of supervision implemented under the\n\nMOU.10 Given the paucity of the information available to us, we do not conclude that the\n\nfactual circumstances make this case moot. We agree with the State that the best place to\n\nresolve this question is the Circuit Court.\n\n       Even if changed circumstances rendered the case moot, we could nonetheless\n\naddress these questions under the voluntary cessation exception.        The State alleged\n\ndeliberate, unlawful conduct over a prolonged period of time in multiple Neiswanger\n\nfacilities. Neiswanger entered into the Consent Agreement only after the State sued and\n\nthe Department suspended all admissions, and it has never admitted any misconduct or\n\nillegality. As such, Neiswanger has not demonstrated that its allegedly wrongful behavior\n\n“could not reasonably be expected to recur.” Friends of the Earth, 528 U.S. at 189.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n            By its own terms, the MOU expired in May 2017.\n\n                                              11\n\f       The Court may address the questions presented under the other mootness exception.\n\nThe legislative history surrounding the enactment of these statutes, discussed infra,\n\ndemonstrates that the Maryland General Assembly considered the issues presented in this\n\ncase to be a matter of significant public policy. The Attorney General’s power under the\n\nEnforcement Clause and the scope of the Injunction Clause necessarily implicate the\n\nrelationship between the government of Maryland and its citizens. Further, an involuntary\n\ndischarge may be completed before individual residents can seek effective relief,\n\nparticularly if residents do not receive adequate notice and opportunity for a hearing before\n\ndischarge as required by HG § 19-345.1. Determining the nature of the relief available and\n\nthe extent of the Attorney General’s enforcement powers provides important guidance for\n\ncourts resolving time-sensitive issues, and will avoid duplicative and inconsistent litigation\n\nresults. See Potomac Abatement, 424 Md. at 710–11.\n\n       With justiciability resolved, we turn to the questions presented.\n\n                                 Statutory Interpretation\n\n       “The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the real\n\nand actual intent of the Legislature.” Lockshin v.

Applying this rule, the Circuit Court determined that “injunctive\n\nrelief authorized is only for an individual resident, or a specified resident acting on the\n\nresident’s behalf, if an involuntary discharge in violation of the law is imminent or has\n\ntaken place.” Thus, it reasoned, the State was not entitled to broad relief enjoining\n\nNeiswanger’s “company practices” under the Injunction Clause and had failed to state a\n\nclaim upon which relief could be granted. Neiswanger urges this Court to accept the Circuit\n\nCourt’s interpretation of the Injunction Clause—as law that not only authorizes, but cabins,\n\nrelief to actions on behalf of named individuals.\n\n       To the contrary, the State sees the Injunction Clause as containing no restriction on\n\nthe Attorney General’s ability to act on behalf of multiple residents. In its view, when a\n\nviolation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights occurs, at the request of the Attorney General, a\n\ncircuit court would have discretion to exercise its “full equitable authority.” The State\n\n\n                                              13\n\favers that the Circuit Court read the Injunction Clause too narrowly, and ignored the\n\nprinciple that enforcement provisions of remedial statutes should be read broadly to “afford\n\ncomplete relief consistent with the statute’s remedial purposes.”\n\n                         The Language Of The Injunction Clause\n\n       We turn to the language of the Injunction Clause.\n\n              A resident, resident’s agent, or resident’s attorney, or the\n              Attorney General on behalf of the resident, who believes that\n              an involuntary discharge or transfer that violates the\n              requirements of § 19-345, § 19-345.1, or § 19-345.2 of this\n              subtitle is imminent or has taken place may request injunctive\n              relief from a circuit court.\n\nHG § 19-345.3(c).\n\n       The statute accords standing to two categories of parties. The first, a “resident,\n\nresident’s agent, or resident’s attorney” are plaintiffs whose suits would likely redress the\n\nunlawful involuntary transfer or discharge of a specific resident. The second, and the one\n\nat issue here, is “the Attorney General, on behalf of the resident.” We consider whether,\n\nby authorizing the Attorney General to take such action, the General Assembly intended\n\nfor the Attorney General to act on behalf of multiple residents.11 We are unable to find any\n\n\n       11\n           Statutory standing requires determining if the statute at issue “contemplates\nlitigants like [the State] availing [itself] of its remedies.” Suessman v. Lamone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351561\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351561/suessmann-v-lamone/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">697</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712 (2004). The Injunction Clause authorizes the Attorney General to file suit. HG\n§ 19-345.3(c). Because the Complaint is brought under the Clause, the Attorney General\nhas statutory standing. See Suessman, 383 Md. at 712. Neiswanger does not contend that\nthe Attorney General is not a proper party to file suit. Rather, Neiswanger argues that the\nState lacks standing to file suit on behalf of multiple residents and that it is not entitled to\nthe relief it seeks. The State reasons that this Court should not address standing because\nthe Circuit Court did not rule on the issue. Neiswanger’s standing argument is substantially\ninterwoven into the interpretation of the Injunction Clause. In addressing whether the\nAttorney General may sue on behalf of multiple residents, and whether the violations the\n\n                                              14\n\fMaryland cases that have addressed the meaning of “on behalf of” in this context. To\n\nconsider whether the General Assembly intended to authorize broad or narrow enforcement\n\nof the Injunction Clause, we turn to the statutes constituting the Patient’s Bill of Rights and\n\nlegislative history.\n\n                       Legislative History Of The Injunction Clause\n\n       The Injunction Clause was not enacted in a vacuum. It was part of a broad statutory\n\nscheme governing involuntary discharge or transfer practices in Maryland nursing facilities\n\nthat amended the Patient’s Bill of Rights. See H.B. 343, 1995 Leg., 409th Sess. (Md. 1995).\n\nHG § 19-343(b) delineates the General Assembly’s policy behind the Patient’s Bill of\n\nRights:\n\n                       (b)(1) The General Assembly intends to promote the\n                       interests and well-being of each resident of a facility.\n                       (2) It is the policy of this State that, in addition to any\n                       other rights, each resident of a facility has the following\n                       basic rights:\n                               (i) The right to be treated with consideration,\n                               respect, and full recognition of human dignity\n                               and individuality;\n                               (ii) The right to receive treatment, care, and\n                               services that are adequate, appropriate, and\n                               in compliance with relevant State and federal\n                               laws, rules, and regulations . . . .\n\n(Emphasis added).

The General Assembly delegated investigatory and\n\nenforcement authority to the Attorney General in several provisions of the Patient’s Bill of\n\nRights, including the Injunction Clause. HG § 19-345.2(e) authorizes the Attorney General\n\nto investigate, either upon receipt of a complaint, or under independent initiative, whether\n\nan abuse of funds under HG § 19-34612 contributed to a decision to transfer or discharge a\n\nresident, and make referrals to other agencies.13 The Attorney General must also enforce\n\nHG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5), relating to applications to the medical assistance program on behalf\n\nof a nursing facility resident or applicant, which we discuss in greater detail infra. See HG\n\n\n       12\n            HG § 19-346(a)(2) defines “abuse of funds” as the use of a resident’s assets or\nincome:\n\n                [a]gainst the express wish of the resident, if the expenditure\n                was not necessary for the direct and immediate benefit and\n                welfare of the resident; or [f]or the use or benefit of a person\n                other than the resident if the expenditure is not also for the\n                direct and immediate benefit of the resident or consistent with\n                an express wish and past behavior of the resident.\n\nSee also id.

This provision may implicate nursing facilities, in addition to the usual\nsuspects for abuse of funds, because residents are permitted to designate facility\nadministrators to handle their funds.

Laws,\n\nch. 547, § 1. As we observed in Walton, 391 Md. at 671, the General Assembly passed\n\nthis bill to “safeguard nursing home residents from being involuntarily discharged from a\n\nfacility due to nonpayment.” Proponents of 1995 Amendments sought “to assure the safety\n\nand well-being of vulnerable Marylanders facing the trauma often associated with the\n\ndischarge and transfer process. . . . [because] [p]atients facing discharge may fear that they\n\nwill not receive adequate care in the new location, or may face a new environment which\n\nthreatens their physical or emotional well-being.”15\n\n       The provisions most relevant to the scope of the Injunction Clause are HG §§ 19-\n\n345 through 19-345.2, which provide a comprehensive statutory scheme regulating\n\ninvoluntary transfers and discharges from nursing facilities. HG § 19-345(a) permits an\n\ninvoluntary discharge or transfer from a nursing facility only in certain circumstances:\n\n\n       14\n          The Legislature also expanded the definition of neglect to include “intentional\nfailure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs of the\nvulnerable adult, including food, clothing, toileting, essential medical treatment, shelter, or\nsupervision.” Md. Code (2002, 2012 Repl. Vol.), § 3-604 of the Criminal Law Article; see\nalso 1995 Md. Laws, ch. 547, § 1. This statute, formerly Article 27, Crimes and\nPunishments § 35D, has since been modified and renumbered.\n       15\n          Letter from Daniel R. Anderson, Director of the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit,\nOffice of the Attorney General, to Senator Thomas L. Bromwell, Chair of the Maryland\nSenate Finance Committee, Regarding House Bill 343: Related Institutions—Discharge,\nTransfer, and Assets of Residents, at 2 (Mar. 22, 1995).\n\n\n                                              17\n\f              (1) The transfer or discharge is necessary for the resident’s\n                  welfare and the resident’s needs cannot be met in the\n                  facility;\n              (2) The transfer or discharge is appropriate because the\n                  resident’s health has improved sufficiently so that the\n                  resident no longer needs the services provided by the\n                  facility;\n              (3) The health or safety of an individual in a facility is\n                  endangered;\n              (4) The resident has failed, after reasonable and appropriate\n                  notice to pay for, or under Medicare or Medicaid or\n                  otherwise to have paid for, a stay at the facility; or\n              (5) The facility ceases to operate.\n\nThese provisions are generally consistent with federal law and regulations governing\n\ninvoluntary discharges and transfers. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 1396r(c)(2)(A)(i)–(vi) (2012);\n\n42 C.F.R. § 483.15(c)(1) (2018). As amended, HG § 19-345 retained existing protections\n\nfor Medicaid-eligible residents, and added new ones. Id. (b)(1)–(2).16\n\n       HG § 19-345.1(a) established new guidelines for notice and hearing requirements\n\nbefore a proposed involuntary discharge or transfer.17 HG § 19-345.2 was an essential\n\nfeature of the 1995 Amendments. Notes from the testimony of the Director of the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit refer to the implementation of specific practices\n\n\n       16\n          The 1995 Amendments prohibited Medicaid-certified facilities from requiring\nMedicaid-eligible residents to pay as a private resident for any length of time, and retained\nan existing prohibition on involuntarily discharging or transferring residents because they\nreceive Medicaid. HG § 19-345(b)(1)(i)–(ii). A facility that discharges or transfers a\nMedicaid-eligible resident or Medicaid recipient is presumed to be acting in violation of\nthe law, but that presumption may be overcome if the resident was discharged for a failure\nto pay, and was not eligible for Medicaid. Id. (b)(2)(i)–(ii).\n       17\n         Before the 1995 Amendments, HG § 19-345 required the facility to provide 30\ndays’ written notice to the resident, and next of kin or guardian for the resident specifying\nthe reason for the transfer or discharge, as well as afford the resident an opportunity for a\nhearing thereon.\n\n                                             18\n\fbefore involuntary discharge as the “heart of this bill.”         See Related Institutions—\n\nDischarge, Transfer and Assets of Residents: Hearing on H.B. 343 before the H. Comm.\n\non Envtl. Matters, 1995 Leg., 409th Sess. (Md. 1995).\n\n       HG § 19-345.2 established specific procedures to be followed before a discharge or\n\ntransfer, including medical assessments, a “post-discharge plan of care for the resident,” as\n\nwell as written documentation from the resident’s attending physician indicating that the\n\ntransfer is consistent with the post-discharge plan of care, and appropriate based on the\n\nresident’s medical condition. Id. (a)(1). Facilities must provide residents with at least a 3-\n\nday supply of medications, and certain information. Id. (b). A resident must consent in\n\nwriting to a discharge or transfer unless it is consistent with the post-discharge plan of care,\n\nand is to a “safe and secure” environment where the resident is under the care of a licensed\n\nprovider, or a person “who has agreed in writing to provide a safe and secure environment.”\n\nId. (c)(2).\n\n       These statutes demonstrate clear legislative intent to limit involuntary discharges\n\nand transfers, and ensure that when they do occur, they are subject to procedural controls\n\nensuring a resident’s health and safety. See Walton, 391 Md. at 671. Although Maryland\n\nlaw had some protections for residents of nursing homes before the 1995 Amendments, the\n\nnew statutory scheme is more robust, and gives the Attorney General the authority to\n\naddress violations of key provisions. See 1995 Md. Laws, ch. 547, § 1.\n\n       The 1995 Amendments are remedial because they authorized injunctive relief for\n\nresidents who are facing, or have been subjected to involuntary discharge or transfer.

Section 1706 authorizes an “individual denied an\n\nequal education opportunity” to file a civil action for relief, and further provides that “[t]he\n\nAttorney General of the United States . . . for or in the name of the United States, may also\n\ninstitute such a civil action on behalf of such an individual.”\n\n       In Ferndale, the district court dismissed an EEOA claim for failure to state a claim\n\nupon which relief could be granted because the complaint “did not adequately identify\n\nthose persons ‘on whose behalf’ the action was being brought by the Attorney General.”\n\n557 F.2d at 1343–44. The district court did not require the Attorney General to actually\n\nname the individuals, but sought enough specificity to allow the court to determine whether\n\na particular individual was within the group the Attorney General had sued on behalf of.\n\nId. at 1344. The Sixth Circuit reversed, ruling that § 1706 did not require the Attorney\n\n\n                                                 20\n\fGeneral to identify “all actual or potential victims” who had been denied an equal\n\neducational opportunity, or even specifically identify such an individual in the complaint.\n\nId. at 1344–45. Provided that there was “at least one person arguably denied equal\n\neducational opportunity,” the statutory requirement was met. Id. at 1345.\n\n       In reaching this conclusion, the Sixth Circuit emphasized that Congress had\n\nestablished a “broad role” for the Attorney General in “enforcing the remedial provisions\n\nof the EEOA.” Id. at 1345 n.8.18 The court saw “no reason to read into the statute a\n\npleading rule not specified by Congress that can only have the effect of impeding\n\nenforcement of the Act.” Id. at 1345. It explained that the district court’s narrow\n\ninterpretation of the purpose of the EEOA to protect individual rights was inconsistent with\n\nthe EEOA’s broader purpose of eliminating segregation-era school systems. Id. at 1345\n\nn.9.\n\n       We agree with the State that, for our purposes, § 1706 of the EEOA is similar,\n\nalthough not identical, to the Injunction Clause.19 Both statutes authorize an individual\n\n\n\n       18\n         The General Assembly’s decision to give the Attorney General standing under\nthe Injunction Clause is of some consequence. As we explained in State ex rel. Attorney\nGen. v. Burning Tree Club, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">301</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (1983), “the Attorney General is first and\nforemost the lawyer of the State. . . .

This distinction does\nnot defeat the comparison between § 1706 and the Injunction Clause. Although the\nAttorney General is acting on behalf of residents under the Injunction Clause, the action is\nalso intended to vindicate State interests and policies. As such, it is reasonable to infer that\nthe Attorney General may sue in the name of the State.\n\n                                              21\n\fcause of action, as well as public enforcement by the Attorney General. Compare 20\n\nU.S.C. § 1706, with HG § 19-345.3(c). Further, like § 1706, the Injunction Clause\n\nestablishes a standard the Attorney General must meet to seek injunctive relief—i.e., an\n\nillegal involuntary discharge or transfer. See Ferndale, 557 F.2d at 1345. And the\n\nInjunction Clause, like § 1706, is a remedial statute. As such, we construe it “liberally in\n\nfavor of claimants to ‘suppress the evil and advance the remedy.’” Wash. Suburban\n\nSanitary Comm’n v.

It reasons\n\nthat once it has satisfied the statutory standard, the circuit court’s equitable jurisdiction\n\npermits complete relief. Neiswanger contends that Talbot County restricts courts from\n\nexercising equitable discretion in statutorily-authorized injunctions, and the Injunction\n\nClause limits the scope of the relief to redressing wrongs for an individual resident.\n\n       “An injunction is ‘a writ framed according to the circumstances of the case\n\ncommanding an act which the court regards as essential to justice, or restraining an act\n\nwhich it esteems contrary to equity and good conscience.’” El Bey v.

In the appeal, we considered whether the\n\nCircuit Court had subject matter jurisdiction to issue the injunction, and the propriety of its\n\ndecision to deny the injunction.

In Talbot County, § 4 authorized the Commission to seek injunctive relief “[a]t\n\nany time after a complaint has been filed, if the Commission believes that appropriate civil\n\naction is necessary to preserve the status of the parties or to prevent irreparable harm from\n\nthe time the complaint is filed until the time of its final disposition . . . .” Id. at 131 (quoting\n\nArt. 49B § 4).       We explained that while § 4 did not eliminate the circuit court’s\n\ndiscretionary authority or mandate an injunction, it “narrow[ed] the circuit court’s\n\ndiscretionary authority by replacing the considerations in equity with the statutory\n\ncriteria . . . .” Id. at 129–30.\n\n       We determined that § 4 granted the circuit court “unmistakable” authority and\n\nstatutory jurisdiction to “issue injunctive relief at any time after a complaint has been filed\n\nwith the Commission.” Id. at 131–32. Relying on federal precedent, we explained that\n\nwhen the Legislature provides opportunities for a party to seek injunctive relief, it\n\n“implicitly establish[es] a standard for courts reviewing these requests . . . .” Id. at 137–\n\n39. Provided the Commission met the standard, the court should have granted the\n\ninjunction. Id. at 139. The standard in § 4, we observed, was “markedly similar” to the\n\ngeneral function of equitable relief—to prevent irreparable harm. Id. at 140.\n\n       In Talbot County, when we characterized traditional equitable factors20 as “largely\n\ninapplicable” we spoke only to the factors relating to a preliminary or interlocutory\n\n\n       20\n         The party seeking an interlocutory injunction must show: (1) a likelihood of\nsuccess upon the merits; (2) that the injury suffered by granting the injunction is less than\n\n                                                24\n\finjunction—recognizing that the injunction authorized by § 4 “share[d] more of the\n\ncharacteristics of a permanent injunction.”21 Id. at 136 (emphasis added). Here, the\n\nCircuit Court misread Talbot County when it concluded that traditional equitable factors\n\nwere “largely inapplicable” in statutory injunctions.          The language of the statute\n\nundoubtedly governs, but it does not invariably displace equitable factors.\n\n       Talbot County teaches us that a statutory injunctive remedy is not necessarily a\n\nlimitation on the scope of available relief. The Legislature authorized the Commission to\n\nseek an injunction when it was necessary to carry out its purpose of investigating and\n\nenforcing the State’s laws prohibiting employment discrimination.               Id. at 142–43.\n\nPermitting the Commission to carry on its investigation without interference was consistent\n\nwith the “ubiquitous nature of our State’s anti-discrimination legislation” and the\n\n“indispensable nature of tools of enforcement it afforded the Commission . . . .” Id. at 144.\n\nThus, the court could afford complete relief in a manner that was consistent with the\n\npurpose of the statute. Id. at 131.\n\n\n\n\nthe injury that would result from refusing to grant it; (3) the plaintiff will suffer irreparable\ninjury unless the injunction is granted; and (4) granting the injunction is in the public\ninterest.

Neiswanger\n\npoints to the Secretary’s authority to restrict new admissions to a facility for a 30-day\n\nperiod if “the Secretary determines that a life-threatening, health or fire safety deficiency\n\nexists in a related institution . . . .” HG § 19-328(a)(1). We are not persuaded—because a\n\nrestriction on new admissions does not prohibit a facility from illegally discharging\n\nresidents. Thus, there is no conflict between the Attorney General’s authority to act on\n\nbehalf of residents, and the Secretary’s authority to restrict admissions.\n\n\n                                             28\n\f       In addition to authorizing the Attorney General to seek injunctive relief, the General\n\nAssembly also authorized the Secretary to impose civil penalties on facilities for violations\n\nof HG §§ 19-345–19-345.2. See HG § 19-345.3(a). There is no apparent discord between\n\nthese provisions. A civil penalty against a facility affords little, if any, relief for residents\n\nwho have been subjected to, or are awaiting an unlawful involuntary discharge. The\n\nGeneral Assembly clearly intended for these provisions to operate in tandem. We are\n\nunconvinced that the Attorney General’s authority to seek injunctive relief to require a\n\nfacility to comply with its statutory obligations usurps the Secretary’s authority under\n\nstate22 or federal regulations.23\n\n\n\n\n       22\n           Neiswanger lists “enforcement actions” available under HG § 19-360(d)(1)(i)–\n(iv) that may occur “when there has been a violation of the Patient’s Bill of Rights . . . .”\nBut HG § 19-360(d) permits these enforcement actions when “the Secretary determines\nthat a serious or life-threatening patient care deficiency exists and the hospital, residential\ntreatment center, or health care facility fails to correct the deficiency through\nimplementation of immediate corrective action . . . .” Further, the Secretary must consider\na specific list of factors before determining which actions to take. See id. (e)(1)–(5).\nInjunctive relief may offer a more rapid resolution to an imminent or past unlawful\ninvoluntary discharge that is commensurate with the Legislature’s goals of preventing such\ndischarges. The Attorney General’s ability to take action in that arena does not inhibit the\nSecretary’s authority.\n       23\n           Neiswanger cites a number of federal regulations that authorize the Centers for\nMedicare and Medicaid Services and the State to take action against long-term care\nfacilities for deficiencies. In addition to terminating a provider agreement, remedies\ninclude: temporary management, denials of payment to a facility for Medicaid, or to a State\nfor Medicare, denials of payment for all new admissions, civil monetary penalties, state\nmonitoring, transfer of residents, closing a facility and transferring all the residents,\ndirected in-service training, or alternative state remedies. See 42 C.F.R. § 488.406(a)(1)–\n(9) (2018). These remedies may resolve a variety of operating conditions that present a\nthreat to resident health or safety, but they do not appear to offer the same remedy the\nGeneral Assembly authorized to prevent or cure unlawful involuntary discharges.\n\n                                               29\n\f       Neiswanger suggests that the nature of the injunction sought by the Attorney\n\nGeneral is “simply unworkable” in light of the possibility that the Secretary might amend\n\nregulations affecting nursing facilities. We are not persuaded. By that logic, courts should\n\nnever issue injunctive relief to enforce provisions of laws because legislatures might\n\nchange those laws, or administrative agencies might issue new regulations. Courts can,\n\nand do, compel performance of a variety of obligations, including compliance with law.\n\nSee, e.g., Virginian Ry. Co. v. Sys. Fed’n No. 40, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102795\"><a href=\"/opinion/102795/virginian-ry-v-federation/\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 550–51 (1937).\n\n       We hold that under HG § 19-345.3(c), the Attorney General may bring suit on\n\nbehalf of multiple unnamed residents who have been subjected to, or await, imminent,\n\nunlawful involuntary discharges, provided that at least one individual’s statutory rights\n\nhave been violated. Further, a court may issue complete injunctive relief for violations of\n\nHG §§ 19-345, 19-345.1, and 19-345.2.\n\n       We turn to the second question presented: whether the Attorney General’s authority\n\nto prosecute violations of HG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5) permits injunctive relief to enforce the\n\nrequirement in the C & A Clause, that a facility “cooperate with and assist” a resident or\n\napplicant’s agent in seeking assistance from the medical assistance program.\n\n                           Enforcement Of The C & A Clause\n\n       In its ruling on the State’s request for injunctive relief for alleged violations of the\n\nC & A Clause, the Circuit Court explained that although the Enforcement Clause grants\n\nthe Attorney General the responsibility to enforce and prosecute violations of HG § 19-\n\n344(c)(4)–(5), “the use of the word enforcement does not include injunctive relief.” The\n\nCircuit Court reasoned that the General Assembly never intended to permit injunctive relief\n\n\n                                              30\n\fbecause it did not specifically authorize injunctive relief either in the original 1995\n\nenactment, or in subsequent amendments.\n\n       Neiswanger encourages us to adopt the Circuit Court’s reasoning that the failure to\n\nexplicitly identify injunctive relief renders it unavailable. It argues that because the\n\nGeneral Assembly specifically authorized injunctive relief in the Injunction Clause, and\n\ndid not include the C & A Clause in the statutory violations triggering an injunction, “the\n\nGeneral Assembly’s intent is clear that injunctive relief is not authorized for violations of\n\n[HG §] 19-344.” Neiswanger also contends that the Attorney General’s authority under\n\nthe Enforcement Clause is restricted to seeking civil financial penalties against a resident’s\n\nagent, and the C & A Clause is enforceable through other provisions of the Patient’s Bill\n\nof Rights.\n\n       The State responds that an express grant of injunctive relief in one statute does not\n\npreempt injunctive relief to enforce other statutory provisions. Rather, injunctive relief is\n\nimpliedly authorized by the term “enforcement,” and the Attorney General’s authority.\n\nThe State reasons that because there is no other provision to ensure a facility’s compliance\n\nwith the C & A Clause, the Circuit Court’s ruling has rendered the statute unenforceable.\n\n       The Enforcement Clause states that “[t]he Attorney General is responsible for the\n\nenforcement and prosecution of violations of the provisions of paragraphs (4) and (5) of\n\nthis subsection.” HG § 19-344(c)(6)(iii). The C & A Clause states that “[t]he facility shall\n\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\fcooperate with and assist the agent in seeking assistance from the medical assistance\n\nprogram on behalf of the applicant or resident.” Id. (c)(5)(ii).\n\n       Neiswanger is correct that paragraphs (4) and (5) are primarily devoted to the\n\nresponsibilities of agents in applying for the medical assistance program. See id. (c)(4)–\n\n(5). But the C & A Clause is plainly set forth in mandatory terms and should not be ignored.\n\nWe have consistently interpreted legislative use of the word “shall” to “indicate[] the intent\n\nthat a provision is mandatory.” Dove v.

HG § 19-344(c) provides\n\ncivil penalties for agents who “willfully or with gross negligence” violate the requirements\n\nof paragraphs (4) or (5). HG § 19-344(c)(6)(i)–(ii). But it does not list civil penalties for\n\na facility’s violations of the C & A Clause, or specify how the Attorney General may ensure\n\na facility’s compliance.\n\n       “Enforcement” is defined as “[t]he action or process of enforcing,” as well as “[t]he\n\nforcible exaction of a payment, an action, etc.; the enforcing or compelling of (a law,\n\ndemand, obligation); . . . a means of enforcing a sanction.”        5 The Oxford English\n\nDictionary 245 (2d ed. 1989).

The General Assembly intended to prevent\n\ninvoluntary discharges for nonpayment. See Walton, 391 Md. at 671; see also 1995 Md.\n\nLaws, ch. 547, § 1. As such, HG § 19-344(c)(5)(i) requires applicants, residents, or their\n\nagents to seek assistance from Medicaid. A facility’s compliance is essential to that\n\nendeavor. And “[w]hether an obligation has been discharged, and whether action taken or\n\nomitted is in good faith or reasonable, are everyday subjects of inquiry by courts in framing\n\nand enforcing their decrees.” Virginian Ry., 300 U.S. at 550.\n\n       In Walton, 391 Md. at 672, we determined that a nursing facility could not pursue a\n\nprivate right of action against a resident’s agent, because the Attorney General is\n\nspecifically responsible for enforcement and prosecution of paragraphs (4) and (5) of HG\n\n§ 19-344(c). Although Walton did not consider the extent of Attorney General’s authority\n\nto enforce the C & A Clause, it suggests a broad construction of the Attorney General’s\n\nauthority under the Enforcement Clause. See 391 Md. at 672.\n\n       Given the Attorney General’s exclusive power to enforce agents’ obligations, see\n\nid., it is only logical that the Attorney General’s responsibilities also extend to enforcing a\n\nfacility’s obligation. The Enforcement Clause directs the Attorney General to enforce and\n\nprosecute violations of HG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5), which includes the C & A Clause. The\n\n\n                                              35\n\fGeneral Assembly’s intent to make the facility’s cooperation and assistance mandatory “is\n\nin itself a declaration of public interest and policy which should be persuasive in inducing\n\ncourts to give relief.” Virginia Ry., 300 U.S. at 552. The ability to seek injunctive relief\n\nnecessarily follows.\n\n       Neiswanger’s argument, that the Legislature foreclosed injunctive relief as a means\n\nof enforcing the C & A Clause,25 by explicitly providing for such relief elsewhere, is\n\nsubstantially similar to the one we rejected in Central Acceptance, 424 Md. at 31–32.\n\nExpressio unius est exclusio alterius should never be applied to “override the manifest\n\nintention of the Legislature . . . .” Kirkwood v.

Upon receipt of a complaint, the Secretary\n\nof Aging must investigate the complaint and report any findings to the complainant, and\n\n\n\n       25\n          Neiswanger also reasons that because the Injunction Clause does not include such\nrelief for violations of HG § 19-344, the General Assembly did not intend to permit\ninjunctive relief for those violations.\n        We observe that the provisions cross-referenced in the Injunction Clause\nspecifically address the guidelines for discharge. HG § 19-344 addresses admissions\nrequirements and residents’ rights. Although we review provisions in the context of the\nstatutory scheme, Lockshin v. Semsker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2270855\"><a href=\"/opinion/2270855/lockshin-v-semsker/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 275–76 (2010), we do not find this\nargument persuasive. We do not expect the General Assembly to list each provision that\ncould merit injunctive relief.\n\n                                            36\n\fthe complainant must receive an opportunity for a hearing before the Department. Id.\n\n(q)(3)–(4). Although HG § 19-344(q) may serve as an alternate means of redressing a\n\nresident’s complaints, we do not conclude that it is the sole enforcement mechanism for\n\nHG § 19-344(c)(4)–(5) in light of the General Assembly’s explicit directive to the Attorney\n\nGeneral.\n\n       We hold that HG § 19-344(c)(6)(iii) permits the Attorney General to seek injunctive\n\nrelief to require a facility to comply with its statutory obligation under HG § 19-\n\n344(c)(5)(ii) to “cooperate with and assist” an agent in seeking assistance from the medical\n\nassistance program on behalf of a resident or applicant.\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       Neiswanger has not met its burden of demonstrating to this Court that the case is\n\nmoot. We hold that HG § 19-345.3(c) permits the Attorney General to seek injunctive\n\nrelief on behalf of multiple unnamed residents who have been, or await, imminent unlawful\n\ninvoluntary discharges, provided the statutory standard has been met. HG § 19-345.3(c)\n\npermits a court to issue complete injunctive relief for violations of HG §§ 19-345, 19-\n\n345.1, and 19-345.2. We also hold that the Attorney General may seek injunctive relief\n\nunder HG § 19-344(c)(6)(iii) to enforce a facility’s obligation to “cooperate with and\n\nassist” a resident or applicant’s agent in seeking assistance from the medical assistance\n\nprogram on behalf of a resident or applicant.\n\n                                          JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT\n                                          OF MONTGOMERY COUNTY\n                                          REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT\n                                          COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS\n                                          CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.\n\n\n                                            37\n\fCOSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY\nTHE APPELLEE.\n\n\n\n\n 38\n\f</pre>",
