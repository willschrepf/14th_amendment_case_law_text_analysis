Willie Furr appeals from the\n\ndistrict court order which denied his petition for habeas corpus\n\nrelief, 28 U.S.C. § 2254, which sought to set aside his state court\n\nconviction for possessing a firearm, receiving a firearm with an\n\naltered   serial   number,   being    an    armed    career   criminal,   and\n\nattempting to obstruct justice and to intimidate a witness.               We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                      I\n\n                              BACKGROUND\n\n           Furr was arrested on November 3, 1999, outside Dorchester\n\nHigh School.1   Upon their arrival at the scene, the police observed\n\nFurr run toward them holding his right side, then toss what\n\nappeared to be a gun, and yell to his nearby friend, Rahshjeem\n\nBenson:   “Yo, Six, grab the gun.”        Furr told the police that he had\n\nbeen shot by an unknown person, who had already fled the scene;\n\nthat is, by someone other than Benson.              The police located and\n\narrested Benson, who was found hiding between two nearby cars, and\n\nwho pointed out to the police the firearm laying at his feet.             The\n\ngun appeared to the police to be the one Furr had tossed away\n\nmoments before.\n\n           In due course, Furr was arrested and charged in state\n\n     1\n      The material facts found by the state courts, see\nCommonwealth v. Furr, 788 N.E.2d 592, 596 (Mass. App. Ct.), review\ndenied, 793 N.E.2d 375 (Mass. 2003), as recited here, are entitled\nto a presumption of correctness on habeas review. See 28 U.S.C. §\n2254(e)(1).\n\n                                     -2-\n\fjuvenile court with possessing a firearm, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch.\n\n269, § 10(a), receiving a firearm bearing an altered serial number,\n\nid. § 11C, being an armed career criminal, id. § 10G(a),2 and\n\nattempting to obstruct justice and intimidate a witness, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 274, § 6; Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 268, § 13B.\n\nBenson provided a written statement to the police, stating that the\n\nfirearm belonged to Furr, and that Furr had gotten rid of the gun\n\nand yelled to Benson to pick it up.           While in prison pending trial,\n\nFurr sent an anonymous letter to Benson, stating that he had seen\n\nand was disappointed by Benson’s written statement to the police,\n\nthat Benson’s statement was a lie, and that Benson should testify\n\nat trial that he and the police had concocted the untruthful\n\nstatement.        The Furr letter made veiled threats about harming\n\nBenson’s mother and siblings.           The letter was intercepted by the\n\npolice before it reached Benson.\n\n            At trial, the prosecution introduced both the Benson\n\nstatement    to    the   police   and   Furr’s   threatening   letter.   Furr\n\nobjected to the Benson statement, claiming that it was hearsay by\n\na non-testifying witness (viz., Benson), and that its introduction\n\nwould violate his rights under the Confrontation Clause. The court\n\noverruled the objection, on the ground that Benson’s statement was\n\n\n     2\n      The predicate “violent crimes” charged under the armed career\ncriminal statute were Furr’s juvenile adjudications for armed\ncarjacking, kidnapping, and assault and battery with a dangerous\nweapon. See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 269, § 10G(a) & (e); Mass.\nGen. Laws Ann. ch. 140, § 121.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fnot introduced to establish the truth of its contents (viz., that\n\nthe gun belonged to Furr) on the firearm possession count, but\n\nrather   for   a   legitimate   nonhearsay    purpose   relating    to   the\n\nobstruction/intimidation count (viz., to establish that petitioner\n\nknew of Benson’s statement and intended to intimidate him).              The\n\njury was instructed that it should consider the Benson statement\n\nonly in relation to the obstruction count, and not the firearm-\n\npossession count.     The jury found petitioner guilty on all counts.\n\n           The trial court decided the “armed career criminal”\n\ncharge, without a jury (with petitioner’s consent), and found him\n\nguilty based upon his prior juvenile adjudications. See supra note\n\n2.   After petitioner was sentenced to 8-12 years’ imprisonment, he\n\nappealed to the state appellate court, which affirmed in due\n\ncourse, Commonwealth v. Furr, 788 N.E.2d 592, 596 (Mass. App. Ct.\n\n2003),   and   the   Supreme    Judicial     Court   denied   the   ensuing\n\napplication for further appellate review.\n\n           In November 2003, the instant habeas petition was filed\n\nin federal district court, on the grounds that (i) the admission of\n\nthe Benson statement violated Furr’s rights under the Confrontation\n\nClause; and (ii) the trial court ruling that his prior juvenile\n\nadjudications qualified as “convictions” for purposes of the armed\n\ncareer criminal statute was unforeseeable and therefore violated\n\nhis federal due process right to receive fair and adequate warning\n\nthat his conduct would expose him to criminal liability under that\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fstatute.\n\n               The magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation\n\nthat the habeas petition be denied, which was adopted in toto by\n\nthe district court, which subsequently granted a certificate of\n\nappealability as to both the confrontation clause and due process\n\nclaims, which Furr now challenges on appeal.\n\n                                         II\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\nA.     The Standard of Review\n\n               We review the denial of the habeas corpus petition de\n\nnovo.    See Phoenix v. Matesanz, 189 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nPursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act, we\n\nmay    grant    habeas   relief   only    if     the   challenged      state   court\n\nadjudication “resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n\ninvolved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal\n\nlaw.”    28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).         The “contrary to” criterion is not\n\nsatisfied      unless    the   state   court     “arrive[d]      at   a   conclusion\n\nopposite to that reached by [the United States Supreme] Court on a\n\nquestion of law or if the state court decide[d] a case differently\n\nthan    [the      Supreme]     Court     has     on    a   set    of      materially\n\nindistinguishable facts.”          Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 413\n\n(2000); see Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004), cert.\n\ndenied, 125 S. Ct. 971 (2005).                 The “unreasonable application”\n\ncriterion is satisfied where the state court “identifie[d] the\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fcorrect    governing    legal       principle     from   [the    Supreme]   Court's\n\ndecisions but unreasonably applie[d] that principle to the facts of\n\nthe prisoner's case.”         Williams, 529 U.S. at 413.                 As this is\n\nindeed a high hurdle, habeas relief will not lie, even though the\n\nstate-court    interpretation         or    application    of    federal    law   was\n\nerroneous, unless it is also shown to be objectively unreasonable.\n\nSee Horton, 370 F.3d at 80.\n\nB.   The Confrontation Clause Claim\n\n            Furr initially contends that the admission of the Benson\n\nstatement, absent any opportunity to cross-examine Benson, violated\n\nFurr's rights under the Confrontation Clause.                     He relies upon\n\nBruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968), and Tennessee v.\n\nStreet, 471 U.S. 409 (1985).                The Bruton Court held that the\n\ngovernment could not introduce a non-testifying codefendant’s out-\n\nof-court    statement    at     a    joint       trial   which   also    inculpated\n\ndefendant, even if the trial court instructed the jury that it\n\nshould consider the codefendant’s extrajudicial statement only as\n\nevidence of the codefendant’s guilt, not the defendant’s.                   Bruton,\n\n391 U.S. at 135-36.        The Court observed that, although juries\n\nnormally are presumed to follow instructions, the Bruton situation\n\ncreated too great a risk that the jury either would not or could\n\nnot segregate its reliance upon the inculpatory evidence only in\n\nrelation to the codefendant, and consequently that avoidance of any\n\nsuch jury confusion was “vital” to the defendant.                  Id.\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f              In Street, however, the State introduced a codefendant’s\n\nwritten statement to rebut the defendant’s contention that law\n\nenforcement officials had coerced his confession. Street contended\n\nthat,   prior     to   his   confession,    the   sheriff      had    read   the\n\ncodefendant’s statement to him, then forced Street to parrot the\n\ndetails of that statement in Street's own confession.                Street, 471\n\nU.S. at 411.     In order to rebut the defense theory that the Street\n\nconfession was coerced in this way, the State introduced the\n\ncodefendant’s written statement to demonstrate how it differed in\n\nsignificant details from the Street confession.                Id. at 411-12.\n\nThe   trial    court   instructed   the    jury   that   the    codefendant's\n\nstatement could not be considered for the truth of the matters\n\nasserted (viz., Street’s participation in the burglary and murder),\n\nbut only to rebut the defense claim that Street had been coerced\n\ninto parroting the codefendant’s statement.          Id. at 412.\n\n              In upholding the admission in evidence of the written\n\nstatement given by Street's codefendant, the Court distinguished\n\nBruton on the ground that the codefendant’s statement there was\n\nhearsay, in that it was introduced to prove the truth of the\n\nmatters asserted (viz., codefendant’s guilt), whereas the State’s\n\nuse of the codefendant statement against Street was not hearsay, in\n\nthat it was introduced solely to enable the jury to compare the two\n\nconfessions and to assess Street’s contention that the sheriff had\n\ncoerced him into parroting his codefendant’s statement, rather than\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fto prove that Street had participated in the burglary and murder.\n\nId. at 413-14.        “The nonhearsay aspect of [the codefendant’s]\n\nconfession – not to establish what happened at the murder scene but\n\nwhat happened when [Street] confessed – raised no Confrontation\n\nClause concerns.”      Id. at 414.\n\n           The Court then observed that Street’s case was similar to\n\nBruton in one respect only:            the jury might have disregarded the\n\nlimiting instruction and used the codefendant statement for the\n\nimproper   purpose    of    inferring        Street’s    participation     in   the\n\nburglary and murder.        Id.    In rejecting this prospect, the Court\n\nfirst re-emphasized the “crucial” presumption that juries normally\n\nfollow their instructions. Id. at 415. The Street confession also\n\nwas   crucial    to   the    government’s        ability    to    establish     his\n\nparticipation in the burglary and murder, and the Street allegation\n\nthat his confession had been coerced (hence was inadmissible) could\n\nonly be accurately evaluated if the jury were permitted to compare\n\nit with the codefendant’s statement to determine what differences\n\n(if any) the two versions contained.             Id.    Unlike in Bruton (viz.,\n\nseverance of the two codefendants' trial), the trial court had no\n\npracticable     alternatives      to   the    admission    of    the   codefendant\n\nstatement which not only would have fostered this essential truth-\n\nfinding function but also eliminated the risk that the jury would\n\ndisregard the limiting instruction and misuse the evidence, given\n\nthat (I) a redaction of the codefendant statement to remove all\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\freferences to Street would have provided the jury an inaccurate\n\ndepiction of the codefendant’s statement, likely resulting in more\n\ndifferences between it and the Street confession, and further\n\nundercutting the Street coercion defense theory; and (ii) the\n\nStreet joint trial had already been severed from his codefendant’s.\n\nId. at 415-16 & 416 n.7.    Finally, the Court rejected the Street\n\nargument that it was constitutionally mandated that the State call\n\nhis codefendant to testify at Street's trial, then noted that the\n\ncodefendant had no personal knowledge as to the particular issue\n\nregarding which his written statement was introduced: whether the\n\nsheriff   subsequently     coerced     Street   into   parroting   the\n\ncodefendant’s confession.    Id. at 416.\n\n          Citing Street, the state appeals court affirmed the\n\nadmission of the Benson “nonhearsay” statement for the purpose of\n\nestablishing the obstruction and intimidation count, rather than\n\nthe firearm possession count.        Furr, 788 N.E.2d at 596-97.   The\n\ncourt noted further that the jury need not have decided whether the\n\ncontents of the Benson statement were true or false, but merely\n\nthat the Benson statement had induced Furr to threaten him.     Id. at\n\n597.\n\n          Now, on appeal from the district court order denying the\n\nhabeas petition, Furr contends that the state appeals court’s\n\ndecision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application\n\nof Street, because it held that it was entirely sufficient for\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fConfrontation     Clause      purposes     that    the    Benson      statement      was\n\nnonhearsay     and    that    the    trial    court      had    given      a   limiting\n\ninstruction, whereas the Street Court went on to weigh several\n\nadditional factors: (i) how important the codefendant’s statement\n\nwas to the prosecution’s case; (ii) whether there were practicable\n\nalternatives     to   admitting      the     codefendant's          statement,     e.g.,\n\nseverance; and (iii) whether the prosecutor's closing arguments\n\nencouraged the jury to misuse the codefendant’s statement against\n\nFurr.    Furr     maintains     that,      had    the    state      appellate      court\n\nconsidered    these      mandatory    additional        factors,      it   would    have\n\nconcluded that the Benson statement was inadmissible, because (i)\n\nit was not critical to the State’s case, since it unquestionably\n\nwas inadmissible on the firearm possession count;                          (ii) it was\n\npracticable to require that the State sever the trial of the\n\nfirearm-possession count from the obstruction/intimidation count;\n\nand (iii) the prosecutor's closing argument implicitly utilized the\n\nBenson statement for hearsay purposes by asserting that Furr’s\n\nletter to Benson evidenced Furr’s consciousness of guilt.\n\n           The       state    appellate        court’s         interpretation        and\n\napplication of Street to the Furr case readily passes muster under\n\n§   2254(d)(1).        Furr    inappropriately          extracted      his     proposed\n\ninterpretation not from the Street majority opinion, but from its\n\ntwo-justice concurrence.         Street, 471 U.S. at 417-18 (Brennan, J.,\n\nconcurring)      (“The    out-of-court       confession        is    admissible     for\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fnonhearsay purposes only because that confession was essential to\n\nthe State’s rebuttal of respondent Street’s defense and because no\n\nalternative short of admitting the statement would have adequately\n\nserved the State’s interest. . . . [T]he record contains no\n\nsuggestion that the State was engaged in any improper effort to\n\nplace prejudicial hearsay evidence before the jury.”).                    As the\n\nCourt issued a majority decision endorsed by six other justices,\n\nhowever, and not merely a plurality opinion, the concurrence cannot\n\nbe considered a viable Court holding.         See Alexander v. Sandoval,\n\n532 U.S. 275, 285 n.5 (2001); cf. Marks v. United States, 430 U.S.\n\n188, 193 (1977) (“When a fragmented Court decides a case and no\n\nsingle rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five\n\nJustices, ‘the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position\n\ntaken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the\n\nnarrowest grounds.’”) (citation omitted).          Thus, the concurrence\n\nsimply did not command support from a majority of Justices.\n\n           As we noted in outlining the Street majority opinion, the\n\nCourt did not purport to prescribe a mandatory checklist of factors\n\nto be considered in every case.            Rather, it noted that, absent\n\nother   circumstances,    it   is   sufficient    that    the      codefendant\n\nstatement is nonhearsay – viz., not admitted for the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted, and provided the court gives a limiting jury\n\ninstruction   to   that   effect.    Street,     471   U.S.   at    414    (“The\n\nnonhearsay aspect of [the codefendant’s] confession – not to prove\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fwhat happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when\n\n[Street] confessed – raises no Confrontation Clause concerns.”);\n\nsee Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 59 n.9 (2004) (“The\n\n[Confrontation] Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial\n\nstatements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the\n\nmatter asserted.”).3         The Court then observed that, in some cases,\n\ncircumstances might exist which nonetheless could create a risk\n\nthat the jury might misuse the evidence, and thus rebut the normal\n\npresumption     that     juries    would   follow   limiting    instructions.\n\nTurning to the facts in the Street case, the Court noted the\n\nabsence    of   such     special    circumstances,      observing      that   the\n\ngovernment obviously needed the jury to compare the contents and\n\ndetails    of   the    two   confessions   to   rebut   the   Street    coercion\n\ndefense.    Id. at 416.       At no point in its discussion, however, did\n\nthe majority purport to endorse the mandatory consideration of a\n\nchecklist of factors, let alone the factors which the two justices\n\nin concurrence considered dispositive.\n\n\n\n     3\n      Furthermore, we reject the subsidiary contention that the\ntrial court did not give an adequate limiting instruction, in that\nit failed to tell the jury in so many words that they could not\nconsider the “truth” of the Benson statement, but instead\ninstructed that the statement could be considered only with respect\nto the obstruction/intimidation count. First, the two versions are\nfunctionally equivalent, given that possession of a firearm was not\na fact necessary to establish the obstruction/intimidation count.\nSecond, and more importantly, the court further instructed: “[Y]ou\nare not to consider the content of the [Benson] statement in\ndetermining whether the defendant possessed the firearm or\nammunition.” No more was necessary.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            Furr points to no subsequent case which has interpreted\n\nStreet as imposing such a mandatory checklist.                  We frequently have\n\nstated    the    Street    case   holding      as:      “In    general,       nonhearsay\n\nstatements or statements not offered for the truth of the matter\n\nasserted do not raise Confrontation Clause concerns.”                             United\n\nStates v. Trenkler, 61 F.3d 45, 62 (1st Cir. 1995).                           Thus, the\n\ndetermination as to whether the general rule of admissibility in\n\nStreet applies is assessed case by case, based upon the presence of\n\nwhatever special circumstances would create an unreasonable risk\n\nthat the jury disregarded their instructions.\n\n            Of    course,    for    habeas-review           purposes     we    need   not\n\ndetermine whether the state appellate court’s interpretation and\n\napplication of Street is legally correct, but simply that it was\n\nneither    “contrary      to,”    nor    an   “unreasonable        application”       of,\n\nStreet.    Horton, 370 F.3d at 80.            For the above-stated reasons, we\n\nmust   conclude     that    it    obviously      was    not.       The   state    court\n\ndetermined that the Benson statement was nonhearsay, because the\n\njury did not need to decide whether the contents of the Benson\n\nstatement were true or false, but merely whether the statement\n\nprompted Furr to threaten him.            Furr, 788 N.E.2d at 597.              The fact\n\nthat the appeals court did not proceed to discuss the other factors\n\nmentioned in the Street concurrence connotes, at most, that it did\n\nnot    consider    that    the    Furr    case       gave   rise   to    any     special\n\ncircumstances that might risk jury disregard of the limiting\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\finstruction.\n\n            Insofar as Furr suggests that the appeals court was\n\ncompelled, on the present record, to find (and hence discuss) any\n\nsuch special circumstances, we must disagree.            It is quite obvious\n\nthat the Benson statement was crucial for the prosecution to\n\nestablish    the   obstruction/intimidation       count,     because      it   was\n\nnecessary to prove that Benson made a statement, of which Furr had\n\nacquired knowledge, and on account of which Furr threatened and\n\nintimidated Benson.      See Commonwealth v. Perez, 715 N.E.2d 76, 79\n\n(Mass. App. Ct.) (“The witness intimidation statute [Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws Ann. ch. 268, § 13B] applied if the defendants knew of the\n\ncriminal proceeding and believed that [the victim] was a potential\n\nwitness.”), review denied, 722 N.E.2d 976 (Mass. 1999).\n\n            Further, the Street Court simply observed as an aside, in\n\na footnote, that the trial court could not sever the defendant’s\n\nand the codefendant’s trials as an alternative to admitting in\n\nevidence the codefendant statement because their trials already had\n\nbeen severed.      Street, 471 U.S. at 416 n.7.        This observation – in\n\nthe nature of a negative pregnant – reasonably cannot be construed\n\neither as holding that the Court would have reached a different\n\ndecision had the trials not been severed, or that trial courts must\n\ninvariably   consider    severance    as    an   alternative       to   admitting\n\nnonhearsay evidence for limited purposes.\n\n            The    challenged   closing     argument    by   the    prosecution\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\freferred to the Furr letter to Benson, and suggested that its\n\ncontents demonstrated that Furr had a guilty conscience.                         The\n\nprosecutor      did   not    argue   that    the   jury   should   draw   such    an\n\ninference from the Benson statement.               See Commonwealth v. Perez,\n\n825 N.E.2d 1040, 1045 (Mass. 2005) (“‘It is well established that\n\nevidence regarding threats or intimidation of key witnesses for the\n\nprosecution is admissible to demonstrate consciousness of guilt.’”)\n\n(citation omitted). Thus, the prosecution did not seek to lure the\n\njury astray from the limiting instruction.\n\n           Finally, Furr cites Thomas v. Hubbard, 273 F.3d 1164 (9th\n\nCir. 2002), overruled on other grounds, Payton v. Woodford, 299\n\nF.3d 815, 829 n.11 (9th Cir. 2002), and United States v. Walker,\n\n148 F.3d 518 (5th Cir. 1998), as illustrative decisions supporting\n\nthe view that the Massachusetts appeals court decision in the\n\npresent case is “contrary to” or an “unreasonable application” of\n\nStreet.    Instead, Thomas and Walker stand for the unremarkable\n\nproposition      that,       in    certain      circumstances,     “out-of-court\n\n[nonhearsay] statements [may be] so prejudicial that a jury would\n\nbe unable to disregard their substantive content regardless of the\n\npurpose   for    which      they   are   introduced   and   regardless     of    any\n\ncurative instruction.”             Thomas, 273 F.3d at 1173 (finding such\n\nspecial circumstances where statements were “emotionally charged,”\n\nand that “the [other] evidence against the defendant was far from\n\noverwhelming and the case came down to a credibility battle between\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fthe defendant and an accusing witness.”). As we already noted, the\n\ninquiry into possible misuse of evidence by a jury was treated\n\nquite   flexibly    in   Street,    see   471    U.S.   at    414,    and   it   was\n\nreasonable for the state appeals court to determine that there are\n\nno such extenuating circumstances in this case.\n\n           Moreover, the Benson statement can hardly be considered\n\nunduly inflammatory.         Its essential contents could readily be\n\ninferred from Furr’s threatening letter, the admissibility of which\n\nFurr has not challenged.       Furthermore, unlike the State in Thomas,\n\nthe prosecution in the Furr case possessed other competent evidence\n\nfrom which the jury rationally could infer that he possessed the\n\nfirearm, particularly the police officers’ own observations, upon\n\narriving at the scene of the shooting, that Furr tossed the firearm\n\naway.\n\n           For all the above reasons, we conclude that the appeals\n\ncourt   decision    is    neither    contrary      to   nor    an    unreasonable\n\napplication of the Street decision, and we therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court ruling denying the habeas claim based upon the\n\nConfrontation Clause.\n\nC.   The Due Process Claim\n\n           Furr was sentenced pursuant to the Massachusetts armed\n\ncareer criminal statute, which provides: “Whoever, having been\n\npreviously convicted of a violent crime or of a serious drug\n\noffense,   both    as    defined    herein,     violates     the    provisions    of\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fparagraph (a) . . . of section 10 [viz., illegal possession of a\n\nfirearm] shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for\n\nnot less than three years nor more than 15 years.”          Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nAnn. ch. 269, § 10G(a) (emphasis added).       “For the purposes of this\n\nsection, ‘violent crime’ shall have the meaning set forth in\n\nsection 121 of chapter 140.”     Id. § 10G(e). “‘Violent crime’ shall\n\nmean any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\n\nyear, or any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or\n\npossession   of   a   deadly   weapon   that   would   be   punishable   by\n\nimprisonment for such term if committed by an adult, that: (i) has\n\nas an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical\n\nforce or a deadly weapon against the person of another; (ii) is\n\nburglary, extortion, arson or kidnapping; (iii) involves the use of\n\nexplosives; or (iv) otherwise involves conduct that presents a\n\nserious risk of physical injury to another.”       Mass. Gen. Laws Ann.\n\nch. 140, § 121 (emphasis added).         It is undisputed that Furr had\n\nprior juvenile adjudications for armed carjacking, kidnapping, and\n\nassault and battery with a dangerous weapon which satisfy the § 121\n\ndefinition of “violent crime.”      See supra note 2.\n\n          Furr contended in the state appeals court that subsection\n\n10G(a) is “unduly vague” because it failed to place him on fair and\n\nadequate notice that his prior juvenile adjudications counted as\n\nprior “convictions,” thereby contravening his federal due process\n\nrights.   See Bouie v. City of Columbia, 378 U.S. 347, 354-55\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f(1964).   More particularly, Furr argues that (i) § 10G expressly\n\napplies to persons “having been previously convicted of a violent\n\ncrime,” and does not say “or adjudicated”; (ii) Massachusetts law\n\nlong has presumed that, absent a clear legislative expression to\n\nthe contrary, the statutory term “conviction” does not encompass\n\njuvenile adjudications, see Commonwealth v. Connor C., 738 N.E.2d\n\n731, 738 (Mass. 2000); (iii) unlike § 10G(a), other sections of the\n\nsame statutory enactment use both the words “convictions” and\n\nadjudications,” which suggests that the Legislature intended a\n\ndistinction;     (iv) § 10G(a)'s and (e)’s cross-reference to the\n\ndefinition of “violent crime,” in Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 140, §\n\n121, is inconclusive, because that same cross-reference appears in\n\nmany other statutes besides § 10G, see id. ch. 140, § 129B(1)(I),\n\nand thus could be read as merely imposing restrictions upon the\n\ntypes of adult convictions which could be considered under §\n\n10G(a);   and (v) the juvenile statutes interpreted in Connor C. –\n\nviz.,   Mass.   Gen.   Laws   Ann.   ch.    119,   §§   52,   54,   58   –   are\n\ndistinguishable from § 10G since they expressly cross-referenced to\n\na repeat offender statute which used only the word “conviction,”\n\nand not “adjudication.”\n\n           The state appeals court rejected Furr’s construction of\n\n§ 10G(a), which presented an issue of first impression.             The court\n\nfound that subsection 10G(e)’s cross-reference to the “violent\n\ncrime” definition “communicate[s] unmistakably a legislative intent\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fthat an adjudication of a juvenile as a youthful offender, a form\n\nof aggravated juvenile delinquency, be taken as a ‘conviction’ for\n\npurposes of [§] 10G.”           Furr, 788 N.E.2d at 594-95 (observing that\n\notherwise the cross-reference was purposeless).                     The appeals court\n\nanalogized this cross-reference to the one in Connor C.:                          “‘If a\n\nprior “adjudication” does not satisfy the “conviction” requirement\n\n. . . then the Commonwealth could never indict a child for a second\n\nor subsequent firearms offense . . . because a child is never\n\n“convicted”      of   violating       a   statute.’”         Id.   at    595   (citation\n\nomitted).       Finally, the appeals court rejected the Bouie due-\n\nprocess argument advanced by Furr:\n\n               [Defendant] also argues that [§] 10G is vague.\n               . . . Prescinding from the question whether\n               the defendant waived these points by not\n               raising them in the Juvenile Court, neither\n               has potency. Our discussion, interpretation,\n               and application of § 10G in this case dispose\n               of the claim that it [viz., § 10G] is\n               unfathomable.\n\n\nId. (emphasis added).\n\n               Unable to mount a direct challenge to the state appeals\n\ncourt’s interpretation of the state statute, Furr is left to claim\n\nthat     the    appeals     court      decision    is    “contrary         to”    or   an\n\n“unreasonable application” of Bouie, viz., that the Due Process\n\nClause    requires       that   a    state   criminal    statute        give   fair    and\n\nadequate       warning    as    to    the    nature     of    the       conduct   to    be\n\n\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\fcriminalized.4       First, he contends that the court employed the\n\nwrong legal standard, by requiring him to demonstrate that the\n\nstatutory interpretation of § 10G, adopted by the appeals court,\n\nwas “unfathomable,” rather than merely “unforeseeable.” Bouie, 378\n\nU.S. at 355.      As the context of the above-quoted passage from the\n\nappeals court decision makes clear, however, the court used the\n\n“not unfathomable” phrase – not as an exegesis of the Bouie\n\nstandard – but simply to counter Furr’s argument that § 10G is\n\nhopelessly       vague,   i.e.,   not      amenable     to     any     reasonable\n\ninterpretation.      Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the appeals\n\ncourt’s interpretation of § 10G is “contrary to” the due-process\n\nstandard set forth in Bouie.\n\n            Finally, Furr reiterates his proposed interpretation of\n\n§   10G,   see   supra,   and   suggests    that   it   is     so    conclusively\n\nreasonable as to render the appeals court’s contrary construction\n\nunreasonable for purposes of habeas review.                  We disagree.     The\n\nBouie “foreseeability” standard obviously is fluid and inexact.\n\nThe most that can be said in the instant case is that Furr and the\n\nappeals court set forth two plausible statutory interpretations.\n\nAs Connor C. recognized, the word “conviction” is not so inherently\n\n\n\n      4\n      Brady contends that Bouie simply does not apply at all to the\nprior conviction component of a recidivist statute, citing Dretke\nv. Haley, 541 U.S. 386, 395 (2004) (noting that the Court has\nexempted proof of prior convictions from some generally applicable\nconstitutional rules, such as the requirement that these “facts” be\nproved beyond a reasonable doubt). We need not reach this issue.\n\n                                    -20-\n\fnarrow or precise a term that it could never be used, either in\n\nlegal or common parlance, to encompass juvenile adjudications. Cf.\n\nLovely v. Cunningham, 796 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1986) (noting that\n\nBouie found fault with state court’s adoption of broad definition\n\nto words which normally had a narrow and precise denotation). Even\n\nassuming      that     one   might    quibble   somewhat   with    the     court’s\n\nsuggestion that § 10G(e)’s cross-reference to the definition of\n\n“violent      crime”     necessarily     becomes   purposeless         unless   the\n\nLegislature meant to bring juvenile adjudications into the ambit of\n\n§ 10G, it was hardly unreasonable for the appeals court to consider\n\nthat the Legislature likely foresaw this as among the necessary\n\nconsequences resulting from that incorporating cross-reference.5\n\nIronically, in contrast to this common-sense interpretation, the\n\nFurr       interpretation     is     convoluted,   requiring      an     extensive\n\ncontextual analysis and comparison of a variety of statutes. Thus,\n\nwhatever the reasonableness of the Furr interpretation, there is no\n\nquestion that it lacks the ready foreseeability of the state\n\nappeals      court’s    construction.       Accordingly,   in     light    of   the\n\ndeferential standard of habeas review, we conclude that the appeals\n\ncourt’s application of § 10G to the facts in the Furr case was\n\nneither “contrary to” nor an “unreasonable application” of Bouie.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      The Furr efforts to circumscribe the holding in Connor C. are\nunpersuasive, since he relies primarily upon the dissent in that\ncase, rather than the majority opinion.\n\n                                        -21-\n\fAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n            -22-\n\f",

The police located and arrested Benson, who was found hiding between two nearby cars, and who pointed out to the police the firearm laying at his feet.

Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 274, &#167; 6; Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 268, &#167; 13B. Benson provided a written statement to the police, stating that the firearm belonged to Furr, and that Furr had gotten rid of the gun and yelled to Benson to pick it up. While in prison pending trial, Furr sent an anonymous letter to Benson, stating that he had seen and was disappointed by Benson's written statement to the police, that Benson's statement was a lie, and that Benson should testify at trial that he and the police had concocted the untruthful statement. The Furr letter made veiled threats about harming Benson's mother and siblings.

Furr objected to the Benson statement, claiming that it was hearsay by a non-testifying witness (<i>viz.,</i> Benson), and that its introduction would violate his rights under the Confrontation Clause. The court overruled the objection, on the ground that Benson's statement was not introduced to establish the truth of its contents (<i>viz.,</i> that the gun belonged to Furr) on the firearm possession count, but rather for a legitimate non-hearsay purpose relating to the obstruction/intimidation count (<i>viz.,</i> to establish that petitioner knew of Benson's statement and intended to intimidate him).

Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <i>see Horton v. Allen,</i> 370 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.2004), <i>cert. denied,</i> 543 U.S. 1093, 125 S.Ct. 971, 160 L.Ed.2d 905 (2005). The \"unreasonable application\" criterion is satisfied where the state court \"identifie[d] the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court's decisions but unreasonably applie[d] that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\" <i>Williams,</i> 529 U.S. at 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495. As this is indeed a high hurdle, habeas relief will not lie, even though the state-court interpretation or application of federal law was erroneous, unless it is also shown to be objectively unreasonable. <i>See Horton,</i> 370 F.3d at 80.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>The Confrontation Clause Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furr initially contends that the admission of the Benson statement, absent any opportunity to cross-examine Benson, violated Furr's rights under the Confrontation Clause. He relies upon <i>Bruton v. United States,</i> 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), and <i>Tennessee v. Street,</i> 471 U.S. 409, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985). The <i>Bruton</i> Court held that the government could not introduce a non-testifying codefendant's out-of-court statement at a joint trial which also inculpated defendant, even if the trial court instructed the jury that it should consider the codefendant's extrajudicial statement only as evidence of the codefendant's guilt, not the defendant's. <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. 1620. The Court observed that, although juries normally are presumed to follow instructions, the <i>Bruton</i> situation created too great a risk that the jury either would not or could not segregate its reliance upon the inculpatory evidence only in relation to the codefendant, and consequently that avoidance of any such jury confusion was \"vital\" to the defendant. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Street,</i> however, the State introduced a codefendant's written statement to rebut the defendant's contention that law enforcement officials had coerced his confession. Street contended that, prior to his confession, the sheriff had read the codefendant's statement to him, then forced Street to parrot the details of that statement in Street's own confession. <i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 411, 105 S.Ct. 2078. In order to rebut the defense theory that the Street confession was coerced in this way, the State introduced the codefendant's written statement to demonstrate how it differed in significant details from the Street confession. <i>Id.</i> at 411-12, 105 S.Ct. 2078. The trial court instructed the jury that the codefendant's statement could not be considered for the truth of the matters asserted (<i>viz.,</i> Street's participation in the burglary and murder), but only to rebut the defense claim that Street had been coerced into parroting the codefendant's statement. <i>Id.</i> at 412, 105 S.Ct. 2078.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In upholding the admission in evidence of the written statement given by Street's codefendant, the Court distinguished <i>Bruton</i> on the ground that the codefendant's statement there was hearsay, in that it was introduced to prove the truth of the matters asserted (<i>viz.,</i> codefendant's guilt), whereas the State's use of the codefendant statement against Street was not hearsay, in that it was introduced solely to enable the jury to compare the two confessions and to assess Street's contention that the sheriff had coerced him into parroting his codefendant's statement, rather than to prove that Street had participated in the burglary and murder. <i>Id.</i> at 413-14, 105 S.Ct. 2078. \"The <i>nonhearsay</i> aspect of [the codefendant's] confession &#8212; not to establish what happened at the murder scene but what happened when [Street] confessed &#8212; raised no Confrontation Clause concerns.\" <i>Id.</i> at 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court then observed that Street's case was similar to <i>Bruton</i> in one respect only: the jury might have disregarded the limiting instruction and used the codefendant statement for the improper purpose of inferring Street's participation in the burglary and murder. <i>Id.</i> In rejecting this prospect, the Court first re-emphasized the \"crucial\" presumption that juries normally follow their instructions. <i>Id.</i> at 415, 105 S.Ct. 2078. The Street confession also was crucial to the government's ability to establish his participation in the burglary and murder, and the Street allegation that his confession had been coerced (hence was inadmissible) could only be accurately evaluated if the jury were permitted to compare it with the codefendant's statement to determine what differences (if any) the two versions contained. <i>Id.</i> Unlike in <i>Bruton</i> (<i>viz.,</i> severance of the two codefendants' trial), the trial court had no practicable alternatives to the admission of the codefendant statement which not only would have fostered this essential truth-finding function but also eliminated the risk that the jury would disregard the limiting instruction and misuse the evidence, given that (I) a redaction of the codefendant statement to remove all references to Street would have provided the jury an inaccurate depiction of the codefendant's statement, likely resulting in <i>more</i> differences between it and the Street confession, and further undercutting the Street coercion defense theory; and (ii) the Street joint trial had already been severed from his codefendant's. <i>Id.</i> at 415-16 &amp; 416 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 2078. Finally, the Court rejected the Street argument that it was constitutionally mandated that the State call his codefendant to testify at Street's trial, then noted that the codefendant had no personal knowledge as to the particular issue regarding which his written statement was introduced: whether the sheriff subsequently coerced Street into parroting the codefendant's confession. <i>Id.</i> at 416, 105 S.Ct. 2078.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Citing <i>Street,</i> the state appeals court affirmed the admission of the Benson \"nonhearsay\" statement for the purpose of establishing the obstruction and intimidation count, rather than the firearm possession count. <i>Furr,</i> 788 N.E.2d at 596-97. The court noted further that the jury need not have decided whether the contents of the Benson statement were true or false, but merely that the Benson statement had induced Furr to threaten him. <i>Id.</i> at 597.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, on appeal from the district court order denying the habeas petition, Furr contends that the state appeals court's decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of <i>Street,</i> because it held that it was entirely sufficient for Confrontation Clause purposes that the Benson statement was nonhearsay and that the trial court had given a limiting instruction, whereas the <i>Street</i> Court went on to weigh several additional factors: (i) how important the codefendant's statement was to the prosecution's case; (ii) whether there were practicable alternatives to admitting the codefendant's statement, <i>e.g.,</i> severance; and (iii) whether the prosecutor's closing arguments encouraged the jury to misuse the codefendant's statement against Furr. Furr maintains that, had the state appellate court considered these mandatory additional factors, it would have concluded that the Benson statement was inadmissible, because (i) it was not critical to the State's case, since it unquestionably was inadmissible on the firearm possession count; (ii) it was practicable to require that the State sever the trial of the firearm-possession count from the obstruction/intimidation count; and (iii) the prosecutor's closing argument implicitly utilized the Benson statement for hearsay purposes by asserting that Furr's letter to Benson evidenced Furr's consciousness of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state appellate court's interpretation and application of <i>Street</i> to the Furr case readily passes muster under &#167; 2254(d)(1). Furr inappropriately extracted his proposed interpretation not from the <i>Street</i> majority opinion, but from its two-justice concurrence. <i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 417-18, 105 S.Ct. 2078 (Brennan, J., concurring) (\"The out-of-court confession is admissible for nonhearsay purposes only because that confession was essential to the State's rebuttal of respondent Street's defense and because no alternative short of admitting the statement would have adequately served the State's interest.... [T]he record contains no suggestion that the State was engaged in any improper effort to place prejudicial hearsay evidence before the jury.\"). As the Court issued a <i>majority</i> decision endorsed by six other justices, however, and not merely a <i>plurality</i> opinion, the concurrence cannot be considered a viable Court holding. <i>See Alexander v. Sandoval,</i> 532 U.S. 275, 285 n. 5, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001); <i>cf. Marks v. United States,</i> 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S.Ct. 990, 51 L.Ed.2d 260 (1977) (\"When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, `the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.'\") (citation omitted). Thus, the concurrence simply did not command support from a majority of Justices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted in outlining the <i>Street</i> majority opinion, the Court did not purport to prescribe a mandatory checklist of factors to be considered in every case. Rather, it noted that, absent other circumstances, it is sufficient that the codefendant statement is nonhearsay &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, and provided the court gives a limiting jury instruction to that effect. <i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078 (\"The <i>nonhearsay</i> aspect of [the codefendant's] confession &#8212; not to prove what happened at the murder scene but to prove what happened when [Street] confessed &#8212; raises no Confrontation Clause concerns.\"); <i>see Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004) (\"The [Confrontation] Clause also does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Court then observed that, in some cases, circumstances might exist which nonetheless could create a risk that the jury might misuse the evidence, and thus rebut the normal presumption that juries would follow limiting instructions. Turning to the facts in the <i>Street</i> case, the Court noted the absence of such special circumstances, observing that the government obviously needed the jury to compare the contents and details of the two confessions to rebut the Street coercion defense. <i>Id.</i> at 416, 105 S.Ct. 2078. At no point in its discussion, however, did the majority purport to endorse the mandatory consideration of a checklist of factors, let alone the factors which the two justices in concurrence considered dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furr points to no subsequent case which has interpreted <i>Street</i> as imposing such a mandatory checklist. We frequently have stated the <i>Street</i> case holding as: \"In general, nonhearsay statements or statements not offered for the truth of the matter asserted do not raise Confrontation Clause concerns.\" <i>United States v. Trenkler,</i> 61 F.3d 45, 62 (1st Cir.1995). Thus, the determination as to whether the general rule of admissibility in Street applies is assessed case by case, based upon the presence of whatever special circumstances would create an unreasonable risk that the jury disregarded their instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, for habeas-review purposes we need not determine whether the state appellate court's interpretation and application of <i>Street</i> is legally correct, but simply that it was neither \"contrary to,\" nor an \"unreasonable application\" of, <i>Street. Horton,</i> 370 F.3d at 80. For the above-stated reasons, we must conclude that it obviously was not. The state court determined that the Benson statement was nonhearsay, because the jury did not need to decide whether the contents of the Benson statement were true or false, but merely whether the statement prompted Furr to threaten him. <i>Furr,</i> 788 N.E.2d at 597. The fact that the appeals court did not proceed to discuss the other factors mentioned in the <i>Street</i> concurrence connotes, at most, that it did not consider that the Furr case gave rise to any special circumstances that might risk jury disregard of the limiting instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as Furr suggests that the appeals court was compelled, on the present record, to find (and hence discuss) any such special circumstances, we must disagree. It is quite obvious that the Benson statement was crucial for the prosecution to establish the obstruction/intimidation count, because it was necessary to prove that Benson made a statement, of which Furr had acquired knowledge, and on account of which Furr threatened and intimidated Benson. <i>See Commonwealth v. Perez,</i> 47 Mass.App.Ct. 605, 715 N.E.2d 76, 79 (1999) (\"The witness intimidation statute [Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 268, &#167; 13B] applied if the defendants knew of the criminal proceeding and believed that [the victim] was a potential witness.\"), <i>review denied,</i> 722 N.E.2d 976 (Mass.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, the <i>Street</i> Court simply observed as an aside, <i>in a footnote,</i> that the trial court could not sever the defendant's and the codefendant's trials as an alternative to admitting in evidence the codefendant statement because their trials already had been severed. <i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 416 n. 7, 105 S.Ct. 2078. This observation &#8212; in the nature of a negative pregnant &#8212; reasonably cannot be construed either as holding that the Court would have reached a different decision had the trials not been severed, <i>or</i> that trial courts must invariably consider severance as an alternative to admitting nonhearsay evidence for limited purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged closing argument by the prosecution referred to the <i>Furr letter</i> to Benson, and suggested that its contents demonstrated that Furr had a guilty conscience. The prosecutor did not argue that the jury should draw such an inference from the Benson statement. <i>See Commonwealth v. Perez,</i> 444 Mass. 143, 825 N.E.2d 1040, 1045 (2005) (\"`It is well established that evidence regarding threats or intimidation of key witnesses for the prosecution is admissible to demonstrate consciousness of guilt.'\") (citation omitted). Thus, the prosecution did not seek to lure the jury astray from the limiting instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Furr cites <i>Thomas v. Hubbard,</i> 273 F.3d 1164 (9th Cir.2002), <i>overruled on other grounds, Payton v. Woodford,</i> 299 F.3d 815, 829 n. 11 (9th Cir.2002), and <i>United States v. Walker,</i> 148 F.3d 518 (5th Cir.1998), as illustrative decisions supporting the view that the Massachusetts appeals court decision in the present case is \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application\" of <i>Street.</i> Instead, <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Walker</i> stand for the unremarkable proposition that, in certain circumstances, \"out-of-court [nonhearsay] statements [may be] so prejudicial that a jury would be unable to disregard their substantive content regardless of the purpose for which they are introduced and regardless of any curative instruction.\" <i>Thomas,</i> 273 F.3d at 1173 (finding such special circumstances where statements were \"emotionally charged,\" and that \"the [other] evidence against the defendant was far from overwhelming and the case came down to a credibility battle between the defendant and an accusing witness.\"). As we already noted, the inquiry into possible misuse of evidence by a jury was treated quite flexibly in <i>Street, see</i> 471 U.S. at 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, and it was reasonable for the state appeals court to determine that there are no such extenuating circumstances in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the Benson statement can hardly be considered unduly inflammatory. Its essential contents could readily be inferred from Furr's threatening letter, the admissibility of which Furr has not challenged. Furthermore, unlike the State in <i>Thomas,</i> the prosecution in the Furr case possessed other competent evidence from which the jury rationally could infer that he possessed the firearm, particularly the police officers' own observations, upon arriving at the scene of the shooting, that Furr tossed the firearm away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all the above reasons, we conclude that the appeals court decision is neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of the <i>Street</i> decision, and we therefore affirm the district court ruling denying the habeas claim based upon the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Due Process Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furr was sentenced pursuant to the Massachusetts armed career criminal statute, which provides: \"Whoever, having been previously <i>convicted</i> of a <i>violent crime</i> or of a serious drug offense, both as defined herein, violates the provisions of paragraph (a) ... of section 10 [<i>viz.,</i> illegal possession of a firearm] shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than three years nor more than 15 years.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 269, &#167; 10G(a) (emphasis added). \"For the purposes of this section, `violent crime' shall have the meaning set forth in section 121 of chapter 140.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 10G(e). \"`Violent crime' shall mean any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or <i>any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or possession of a deadly weapon</i> that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult, that: (i) has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force or a deadly weapon against the person of another; (ii) is burglary, extortion, arson or kidnapping; (iii) involves the use of explosives; or (iv) otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 140, &#167; 121 (emphasis added). It is undisputed that Furr had prior juvenile adjudications for armed carjacking, kidnapping, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon which satisfy the &#167; 121 definition of \"violent crime.\" <i>See supra</i> note 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furr contended in the state appeals court that subsection 10G(a) is \"unduly vague\" because it failed to place him on fair and adequate notice that his prior juvenile adjudications counted as prior \"convictions,\" thereby contravening his federal due process rights. <i>See Bouie v. City of Columbia,</i> 378 U.S. 347, 354-55, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964). More particularly, Furr argues that (i) &#167; 10G expressly applies to persons \"having been previously <i>convicted</i> of a violent crime,\" and does not say \"<i>or adjudicated</i>\"; (ii) Massachusetts law long has presumed that, absent a clear legislative expression to the contrary, the statutory term \"conviction\" does not encompass juvenile adjudications, <i>see Commonwealth v. Connor C.,</i> 432 Mass. 635, 738 N.E.2d 731, 738 (2000); (iii) unlike &#167; 10G(a), other sections of the same statutory enactment use both the words \"convictions\" and \"adjudications,\" which suggests that the Legislature intended a distinction; (iv) &#167; 10G(a)'s and (e)'s cross-reference to the definition of \"violent crime,\" in Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 140, &#167; 121, is inconclusive, because that same cross-reference appears in many other statutes besides &#167; 10G, <i>see id.</i> ch. 140, &#167; 129B(1)(I), and thus could be read as merely imposing restrictions upon the types of <i>adult</i> convictions which could be considered under &#167; 10G(a); and (v) the juvenile statutes interpreted in <i>Connor C.</i> &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 119, &#167;&#167; 52, 54, 58 &#8212; are distinguishable from &#167; 10G since they expressly cross-referenced to a repeat offender statute which used only the word \"conviction,\" and not \"adjudication.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state appeals court rejected Furr's construction of &#167; 10G(a), which presented an issue of first impression. The court found that subsection 10G(e)'s cross-reference to the \"violent crime\" definition \"communicate[s] unmistakably a legislative intent that an adjudication of a juvenile as a youthful offender, a form of aggravated juvenile delinquency, be taken as a `conviction' for purposes of [&#167; ] 10G.\" <i>Furr,</i> 788 N.E.2d at 594-95 (observing that otherwise the cross-reference was purposeless). The appeals court analogized this cross-reference to the one in <i>Connor C.:</i> \"`If a prior \"adjudication\" does not satisfy the \"conviction\" requirement ... then the Commonwealth could never indict a child for a second or subsequent firearms offense... because a child is never \"convicted\" of violating a statute.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 595 (citation omitted). Finally, the appeals court rejected the <i>Bouie</i> due-process argument advanced by Furr:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Defendant] also argues that [&#167; ] 10G is vague.... Prescinding from the question whether the defendant waived these points by not raising them in the Juvenile Court, neither has potency. Our discussion, interpretation, and application of &#167; 10G in this case dispose of the claim that it [<i>viz.,</i> &#167; 10G] is <i>unfathomable.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unable to mount a direct challenge to the state appeals court's interpretation of the state statute, Furr is left to claim that the appeals court decision is \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application\" of <i>Bouie, viz.,</i> that the Due Process Clause requires that a state criminal statute give fair and adequate warning as to the nature of the conduct to be criminalized.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> First, he contends that the court employed the wrong legal standard, by requiring him to demonstrate that the statutory interpretation of &#167; 10G, adopted by the appeals court, was \"unfathomable,\" rather than merely \"unforeseeable.\" <i>Bouie,</i> 378 U.S. at 355, 84 S.Ct. 1697. As the context of the above-quoted passage from the appeals court decision makes clear, however, the court used the \"not unfathomable\" phrase &#8212; not as an exegesis of the <i>Bouie</i> standard &#8212; but simply to counter Furr's argument that &#167; 10G is hopelessly vague, <i>i.e.,</i> not amenable to <i>any</i> reasonable interpretation. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the appeals court's interpretation of &#167; 10G is \"contrary to\" the due-process standard set forth in <i>Bouie.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Furr reiterates his proposed interpretation of &#167; 10G, <i>see supra,</i> and suggests that it is so conclusively reasonable as to render the appeals court's contrary construction unreasonable for purposes of habeas review. We disagree. The <i>Bouie</i> \"foreseeability\" standard obviously is fluid and inexact. The most that can be said in the instant case is that Furr and the appeals court set forth two plausible statutory interpretations. As <i>Connor C.</i> recognized, the word \"conviction\" is not so inherently narrow or precise a term that it could never be used, either in legal or common parlance, to encompass juvenile adjudications. <i>Cf. Lovely v. Cunningham,</i> 796 F.2d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1986) (noting that <i>Bouie</i> found fault with state court's adoption of broad definition to words which normally had a narrow and precise denotation). Even assuming that one might quibble somewhat with the court's suggestion that &#167; 10G(e)'s cross-reference to the definition of \"violent crime\" necessarily becomes purposeless unless the Legislature meant to bring juvenile adjudications into the ambit of &#167; 10G, it was hardly unreasonable for the appeals court to consider that the Legislature likely foresaw this as among the necessary consequences resulting from that incorporating cross-reference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Ironically, in contrast to this common-sense interpretation, the Furr interpretation is convoluted, requiring an extensive contextual analysis and comparison of a variety of statutes. Thus, whatever the reasonableness of the Furr interpretation, there is no question that it lacks the ready foreseeability of the state appeals court's construction. Accordingly, in light of the deferential standard of habeas review, we conclude that the appeals court's application of &#167; 10G to the facts in the Furr case was neither \"contrary to\" nor an \"unreasonable application\" of <i>Bouie.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The material facts found by the state courts,<i>see Commonwealth v.

The police located and arrested Benson, who was found hiding between two nearby cars, and who pointed out to the police the firearm laying at his feet. The gun appeared to the police to be the one Furr had tossed away moments before.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, Furr was arrested and charged in state juvenile court with possessing a firearm, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 269, &#167; 10(a), receiving a firearm bearing an altered serial number, <i>id.</i> &#167; 11C, being an armed career criminal, <i>id.</i> &#167; 10G(a),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and attempting to obstruct justice and intimidate a witness, Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 274, &#167; 6; Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 268, &#167; 13B. Benson provided a written statement to the police, stating that the firearm belonged to Furr, and that Furr had gotten rid of the gun and yelled to Benson to pick it up. While in prison pending trial, Furr sent an anonymous letter to Benson, stating that he had seen and was disappointed by Benson's written statement to the police, that Benson's statement was a lie, and that Benson should testify at trial that he and the police had concocted the untruthful statement. The Furr letter made veiled threats about harming Benson's mother and siblings. The letter was intercepted by the police before it reached Benson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the prosecution introduced both the Benson statement to the police and Furr's threatening letter. Furr objected to the Benson statement, claiming that it was hearsay by a non-testifying witness (<i>viz.,</i> Benson), and that its introduction would violate his rights under the Confrontation Clause. The court overruled the objection, on the ground that Benson's statement was not introduced to establish the truth of its contents (<i>viz.,</i> that the gun belonged to Furr) on the firearm possession count, but rather for a legitimate non-hearsay purpose relating to the obstruction/intimidation count (<i>viz.,</i> to establish that petitioner knew of Benson's statement and intended to intimidate him). The jury was instructed that it should consider the Benson statement only in relation to the obstruction count, and not the firearm-possession count. The jury found petitioner guilty on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court decided the \"armed career criminal\" charge, without a jury (with petitioner's consent), and found him guilty based upon his prior juvenile adjudications. <i>See supra</i> note 2.

The <i>Bruton</i> Court held that the government could not introduce a non-testifying codefendant's out-of-court statement at a joint trial which also inculpated defendant, even if the trial court instructed the jury that it should consider the codefendant's extrajudicial statement only as evidence of the codefendant's guilt, not the defendant's. <i>Bruton,</i> 391 U.S. at 135-36, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107684\"><a href=\"/opinion/107684/bruton-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1620</span></a></span>. The Court observed that, although juries normally are presumed to follow instructions, the <i>Bruton</i> situation created too great a risk that the jury either would not or could not segregate its reliance upon the inculpatory evidence only in relation to the codefendant, and consequently that avoidance of any such jury confusion was \"vital\" to the defendant. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Street,</i> however, the State introduced a codefendant's written statement to rebut the defendant's contention that law enforcement officials had coerced his confession. Street contended that, prior to his confession, the sheriff had read the codefendant's statement to him, then forced Street to parrot the details of that statement in Street's own confession. <i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 411, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2078</span></a></span>. In order to rebut the defense theory that the Street confession was coerced in this way, the State introduced the codefendant's written statement to demonstrate how it differed in significant details from the Street confession. <i>Id.</i> at 411-12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2078</span></a></span>. The trial court instructed the jury that the codefendant's statement could not be considered for the truth of the matters asserted (<i>viz.,</i> Street's participation in the burglary and murder), but only to rebut the defense claim that Street had been coerced into parroting the codefendant's statement. <i>Id.</i> at 412, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2078</span></a></span>. The Street confession also was crucial to the government's ability to establish his participation in the burglary and murder, and the Street allegation that his confession had been coerced (hence was inadmissible) could only be accurately evaluated if the jury were permitted to compare it with the codefendant's statement to determine what differences (if any) the two versions contained. <i>Id.</i> Unlike in <i>Bruton</i> (<i>viz.,</i> severance of the two codefendants' trial), the trial court had no practicable alternatives to the admission of the codefendant statement which not only would have fostered this essential truth-finding function but also eliminated the risk that the jury would disregard the limiting instruction and misuse the evidence, given that (I) a redaction of the codefendant statement to remove all references to Street would have provided the jury an inaccurate depiction of the codefendant's statement, likely resulting in <i>more</i> differences between it and the Street confession, and further undercutting the Street coercion defense theory; and (ii) the Street joint trial had already been severed from his codefendant's. <i>Id.</i> at 415-16 &amp; 416 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2078</span></a></span>. Finally, the Court rejected the Street argument that it was constitutionally mandated that the State call his codefendant to testify at Street's trial, then noted that the codefendant had no personal knowledge as to the particular issue regarding which his written statement was introduced: whether the sheriff subsequently coerced Street into parroting the codefendant's confession. <i>Id.</i> at 416, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The court noted further that the jury need not have decided whether the contents of the Benson statement were true or false, but merely that the Benson statement had induced Furr to threaten him. <i>Id.</i> at 597.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now, on appeal from the district court order denying the habeas petition, Furr contends that the state appeals court's decision was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of <i>Street,</i> because it held that it was entirely sufficient for Confrontation Clause purposes that the Benson statement was nonhearsay and that the trial court had given a limiting instruction, whereas the <i>Street</i> Court went on to weigh several additional factors: (i) how important the codefendant's statement was to the prosecution's case; (ii) whether there were practicable alternatives to admitting the codefendant's statement, <i>e.g.,</i> severance; and (iii) whether the prosecutor's closing arguments encouraged the jury to misuse the codefendant's statement against Furr. Furr maintains that, had the state appellate court considered these mandatory additional factors, it would have concluded that the Benson statement was inadmissible, because (i) it was not critical to the State's case, since it unquestionably was inadmissible on the firearm possession count; (ii) it was practicable to require that the State sever the trial of the firearm-possession count from the obstruction/intimidation count; and (iii) the prosecutor's closing argument implicitly utilized the Benson statement for hearsay purposes by asserting that Furr's letter to Benson evidenced Furr's consciousness of guilt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state appellate court's interpretation and application of <i>Street</i> to the Furr case readily passes muster under &#167; 2254(d)(1). Furr inappropriately extracted his proposed interpretation not from the <i>Street</i> majority opinion, but from its two-justice concurrence. <i>Street,</i> 471 U.S. at 417-18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

[T]he record contains no suggestion that the State was engaged in any improper effort to place prejudicial hearsay evidence before the jury.\"). As the Court issued a <i>majority</i> decision endorsed by six other justices, however, and not merely a <i>plurality</i> opinion, the concurrence cannot be considered a viable Court holding. <i>See Alexander v.

Turning to the facts in the <i>Street</i> case, the Court noted the absence of such special circumstances, observing that the government obviously needed the jury to compare the contents and details of the two confessions to rebut the Street coercion defense. <i>Id.</i> at 416, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At no point in its discussion, however, did the majority purport to endorse the mandatory consideration of a checklist of factors, let alone the factors which the two justices in concurrence considered dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furr points to no subsequent case which has interpreted <i>Street</i> as imposing such a mandatory checklist. We frequently have stated the <i>Street</i> case holding as: \"In general, nonhearsay statements or statements not offered for the truth of the matter asserted do not raise Confrontation Clause concerns.\" <i>United States v.

Thus, the determination as to whether the general rule of admissibility in Street applies is assessed case by case, based upon the presence of whatever special circumstances would create an unreasonable risk that the jury disregarded their instructions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, for habeas-review purposes we need not determine whether the state appellate court's interpretation and application of <i>Street</i> is legally correct, but simply that it was neither \"contrary to,\" nor an \"unreasonable application\" of, <i>Street. Horton,</i> 370 F.3d at 80. For the above-stated reasons, we must conclude that it obviously was not. The state court determined that the Benson statement was nonhearsay, because the jury did not need to decide whether the contents of the Benson statement were true or false, but merely whether the statement prompted Furr to threaten him. <i>Furr,</i> 788 N.E.2d at 597. The fact that the appeals court did not proceed to discuss the other factors mentioned in the <i>Street</i> concurrence connotes, at most, that it did not consider that the Furr case gave rise to any special circumstances that might risk jury disregard of the limiting instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as Furr suggests that the appeals court was compelled, on the present record, to find (and hence discuss) any such special circumstances, we must disagree. It is quite obvious that the Benson statement was crucial for the prosecution to establish the obstruction/intimidation count, because it was necessary to prove that Benson made a statement, of which Furr had acquired knowledge, and on account of which Furr threatened and intimidated Benson. <i>See Commonwealth v. Perez,</i> 47 Mass.App.Ct. 605, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">715</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></span>, 79 (1999) (\"The witness intimidation statute [Mass.

This observation &#8212; in the nature of a negative pregnant &#8212; reasonably cannot be construed either as holding that the Court would have reached a different decision had the trials not been severed, <i>or</i> that trial courts must invariably consider severance as an alternative to admitting nonhearsay evidence for limited purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged closing argument by the prosecution referred to the <i>Furr letter</i> to Benson, and suggested that its contents demonstrated that Furr had a guilty conscience. The prosecutor did not argue that the jury should draw such an inference from the Benson statement. <i>See Commonwealth v. Perez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">444</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">143</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">825</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1040</span></span>, 1045 (2005) (\"`It is well established that evidence regarding threats or intimidation of key witnesses for the prosecution is admissible to demonstrate consciousness of guilt.'\") (citation omitted).

As we already noted, the inquiry into possible misuse of evidence by a jury was treated quite flexibly in <i>Street, see</i> 471 U.S. at 414, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111424\"><a href=\"/opinion/111424/tennessee-v-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Its essential contents could readily be inferred from Furr's threatening letter, the admissibility of which Furr has not challenged. Furthermore, unlike the State in <i>Thomas,</i> the prosecution in the Furr case possessed other competent evidence from which the jury rationally could infer that he possessed the firearm, particularly the police officers' own observations, upon arriving at the scene of the shooting, that Furr tossed the firearm away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For all the above reasons, we conclude that the appeals court decision is neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of the <i>Street</i> decision, and we therefore affirm the district court ruling denying the habeas claim based upon the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Due Process Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furr was sentenced pursuant to the Massachusetts armed career criminal statute, which provides: \"Whoever, having been previously <i>convicted</i> of a <i>violent crime</i> or of a serious drug offense, both as defined herein, violates the provisions of paragraph (a) ... of section 10 [<i>viz.,</i> illegal possession of a firearm] shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for not less than three years nor more than 15 years.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 269, &#167; 10G(a) (emphasis added). \"For the purposes of this section, `violent crime' shall have the meaning set forth in section 121 of chapter 140.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 10G(e). \"`Violent crime' shall mean any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or <i>any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or possession of a deadly weapon</i> that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult, that: (i) has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force or a deadly weapon against the person of another; (ii) is burglary, extortion, arson or kidnapping; (iii) involves the use of explosives; or (iv) otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\" Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 140, &#167; 121 (emphasis added). It is undisputed that Furr had prior juvenile adjudications for armed carjacking, kidnapping, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon which satisfy the &#167; 121 definition of \"violent crime.\" <i>See supra</i> note 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furr contended in the state appeals court that subsection 10G(a) is \"unduly vague\" because it failed to place him on fair and adequate notice that his prior juvenile adjudications counted as prior \"convictions,\" thereby contravening his federal due process rights. <i>See Bouie v. City of Columbia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106880\"><a href=\"/opinion/106880/bouie-v-city-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, 354-55, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106880\"><a href=\"/opinion/106880/bouie-v-city-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">894</span></a></span> (1964). More particularly, Furr argues that (i) &#167; 10G expressly applies to persons \"having been previously <i>convicted</i> of a violent crime,\" and does not say \"<i>or adjudicated</i>\"; (ii) Massachusetts law long has presumed that, absent a clear legislative expression to the contrary, the statutory term \"conviction\" does not encompass juvenile adjudications, <i>see Commonwealth v. Connor C.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">738</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></span>, 738 (2000); (iii) unlike &#167; 10G(a), other sections of the same statutory enactment use both the words \"convictions\" and \"adjudications,\" which suggests that the Legislature intended a distinction; (iv) &#167; 10G(a)'s and (e)'s cross-reference to the definition of \"violent crime,\" in Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 140, &#167; 121, is inconclusive, because that same cross-reference appears in many other statutes besides &#167; 10G, <i>see id.</i> ch. 140, &#167; 129B(1)(I), and thus could be read as merely imposing restrictions upon the types of <i>adult</i> convictions which could be considered under &#167; 10G(a); and (v) the juvenile statutes interpreted in <i>Connor C.</i> &#8212; <i>viz.,</i> Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 119, &#167;&#167; 52, 54, 58 &#8212; are distinguishable from &#167; 10G since they expressly cross-referenced to a repeat offender statute which used only the word \"conviction,\" and not \"adjudication.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state appeals court rejected Furr's construction of &#167; 10G(a), which presented an issue of first impression. The court found that subsection 10G(e)'s cross-reference to the \"violent crime\" definition \"communicate[s] unmistakably a legislative intent that an adjudication of a juvenile as a youthful offender, a form of aggravated juvenile delinquency, be taken as a `conviction' for purposes of [&#167; ] 10G.\" <i>Furr,</i> 788 N.E.2d at 594-95 (observing that otherwise the cross-reference was purposeless). The appeals court analogized this cross-reference to the one in <i>Connor C.:</i> \"`If a prior \"adjudication\" does not satisfy the \"conviction\" requirement ... then the Commonwealth could never indict a child for a second or subsequent firearms offense... because a child is never \"convicted\" of violating a statute.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 595 (citation omitted). Finally, the appeals court rejected the <i>Bouie</i> due-process argument advanced by Furr:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Defendant] also argues that [&#167; ] 10G is vague.... Prescinding from the question whether the defendant waived these points by not raising them in the Juvenile Court, neither has potency. Our discussion, interpretation, and application of &#167; 10G in this case dispose of the claim that it [<i>viz.,</i> &#167; 10G] is <i>unfathomable.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unable to mount a direct challenge to the state appeals court's interpretation of the state statute, Furr is left to claim that the appeals court decision is \"contrary to\" or an \"unreasonable application\" of <i>Bouie, viz.,</i> that the Due Process Clause requires that a state criminal statute give fair and adequate warning as to the nature of the conduct to be criminalized.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> First, he contends that the court employed the wrong legal standard, by requiring him to demonstrate that the statutory interpretation of &#167; 10G, adopted by the appeals court, was \"unfathomable,\" rather than merely \"unforeseeable.\" <i>Bouie,</i> 378 U.S. at 355, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106880\"><a href=\"/opinion/106880/bouie-v-city-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1697</span></a></span>. As the context of the above-quoted passage from the appeals court decision makes clear, however, the court used the \"not unfathomable\" phrase &#8212; not as an exegesis of the <i>Bouie</i> standard &#8212; but simply to counter Furr's argument that &#167; 10G is hopelessly vague, <i>i.e.,</i> not amenable to <i>any</i> reasonable interpretation. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the appeals court's interpretation of &#167; 10G is \"contrary to\" the due-process standard set forth in <i>Bouie.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Furr reiterates his proposed interpretation of &#167; 10G, <i>see supra,</i> and suggests that it is so conclusively reasonable as to render the appeals court's contrary construction unreasonable for purposes of habeas review. We disagree. The <i>Bouie</i> \"foreseeability\" standard obviously is fluid and inexact. The most that can be said in the instant case is that Furr and the appeals court set forth two plausible statutory interpretations. As <i>Connor C.</i> recognized, the word \"conviction\" is not so inherently narrow or precise a term that it could never be used, either in legal or common parlance, to encompass juvenile adjudications. <i>Cf. Lovely v. Cunningham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473677\"><a href=\"/opinion/473677/francis-a-lovely-v-michael-j-cunningham-warden-new-hampshire-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">796</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1986) (noting that <i>Bouie</i> found fault with state court's adoption of broad definition to words which normally had a narrow and precise denotation). Even assuming that one might quibble somewhat with the court's suggestion that &#167; 10G(e)'s cross-reference to the definition of \"violent crime\" necessarily becomes purposeless unless the Legislature meant to bring juvenile adjudications into the ambit of &#167; 10G, it was hardly unreasonable for the appeals court to consider that the Legislature likely foresaw this as among the necessary consequences resulting from that incorporating cross-reference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Ironically, in contrast to this common-sense interpretation, the Furr interpretation is convoluted, requiring an extensive contextual analysis and comparison of a variety of statutes. Thus, whatever the reasonableness of the Furr interpretation, there is no question that it lacks the ready foreseeability of the state appeals court's construction. Accordingly, in light of the deferential standard of habeas review, we conclude that the appeals court's application of &#167; 10G to the facts in the Furr case was neither \"contrary to\" nor an \"unreasonable application\" of <i>Bouie.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The material facts found by the state courts,<i>see Commonwealth v.
