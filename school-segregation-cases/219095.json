The district court held that the\n\nplan did not violate the Act.        We disagree.    We reverse the\n\n\n\n\n          Circuit   Judge      of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\fjudgment    of   the    district      court    and   render    judgment     for   the\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n                                         I.\n\n     The basic facts of this case are fully described in our\n\ndecision rendered the first time this case was before us.                         See\n\nClark v. Calhoun County, Mississippi, 21 F.3d 92 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\nTo briefly summarize those facts:             The plaintiffs, James Clark and\n\nBarbara Brown, are black residents and registered voters in Calhoun\n\nCounty, Mississippi.            The county's districting plan divides the\n\ncounty into      five    districts,     each    of    which    elects   one   county\n\nsupervisor,      one    board    of   education      member,   and   one    election\n\ncommissioner.\n\n     Following the release of the 1990 census, the County Board of\n\nSupervisors hired Three Rivers Development and Planning District of\n\nPontotoc, Mississippi to develop a redistricting plan for the\n\ncounty.    The Board also appointed a biracial committee made up of\n\none black resident and one white resident from each election\n\ndistrict to supervise Three Rivers' work.                Three Rivers developed\n\ntwo redistricting plans, one of which the Board of Supervisors\n\ntentatively adopted. The biracial committee approved the plan, and\n\nthe Board     formally     adopted     the    plan    after    a   public   hearing.\n\nPursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the Department of Justice\n\nsubsequently precleared the proposed redistricting plan.\n\n     According to the 1990 census, black residents comprise 23% of\n\nthe county's voting age population and 27% of its population\n\noverall.    Under the plan adopted by the Board of Supervisors, the\n\n\n                                          2\n\fblack    population      is    divided     roughly    equally     among     the    five\n\ndistricts, ranging from a low of 19% of the population in District\n\n3 to a high of 42% in District 4.\n\n       The plaintiffs sued the County, the Calhoun County Democratic\n\nExecutive    Committee,        the    Calhoun     County    Republican      Executive\n\nCommittee,    and    the      Calhoun    County    Election      Commission.        The\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the County's redistricting plan violated\n\n§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as well as the Fourteenth and\n\nFifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.                         The plaintiffs\n\nsought damages, declaratory, and injunctive relief, along with\n\nattorneys' fees.\n\n       After a bench trial, the district court granted judgment to\n\nthe County, concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that\n\na geographically compact black majority district could be created.\n\nIn    addition,    the   court       concluded    that   under    the    totality    of\n\ncircumstances, the plaintiffs had failed to prove a § 2 violation.\n\nThe     district    court's      written       opinion     did   not     address    the\n\nplaintiff's constitutional claims, but the plaintiffs did not\n\nappeal the dismissal of those causes of action.                     We vacated the\n\ndistrict court's judgment and remanded for further proceedings on\n\nthe plaintiff's statutory claim.               See Clark v. Calhoun County, 21\n\nF.3d 92 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n       On remand, the parties submitted additional evidence regarding\n\nthe feasibility of drawing a geographically compact majority-\n\nminority district and the existence of racially-polarized voting in\n\nthe county. After reviewing the evidence, the district court found\n\n\n                                           3\n\fthat a geographically compact black majority district could be\n\ncreated and that racially polarized voting existed in the county.\n\nNoting that the plaintiffs had satisfied the three preconditions\n\nfrom    Thornburg      v.    Gingles,        478    U.S.    30     (1986),   the    court\n\nreconsidered     its        findings     regarding          the     totality   of    the\n\ncircumstances.      Without elaboration, the court determined that its\n\nearlier findings were not erroneous and concluded that \"when all\n\nthe circumstances are considered, 'plaintiffs have not shown that\n\nas a result of the adopted supervisory plan, they do not have equal\n\nopportunity to participate in the political process and to elect\n\ncandidates of their choice.'\"                The plaintiffs appeal the district\n\ncourt's judgment.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       Section 2 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act prohibits any voting\n\npractice or procedure that \"results in a denial or abridgment of\n\nthe right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of\n\nrace or color.\"        42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).               Thornburg v. Gingles, 478\n\nU.S.     30,   49-51    (1986),        set        forth    three    preconditions     to\n\nestablishing a § 2 violation:            The plaintiff must demonstrate that\n\n1) the minority group is sufficiently large and geographically\n\ncompact to constitute a majority in a single-member district; 2)\n\nthe minority group is politically cohesive; and 3) the white\n\nmajority votes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it usually to\n\ndefeat the minority's preferred candidate. Id. at 50-51; Concerned\n\nCitizens for Equality v. McDonald, 63 F.3d 413, 416 (5th Cir.\n\n1995).     These preconditions apply to challenges to both single-\n\n\n                                              4\n\fmember and multi-member districting schemes.                 Growe v. Emison, 113\n\nS.Ct.   1075,     1084   (1993)     (applying        Gingles     to   single-member\n\ndistricts).\n\n      The   three     Gingles     preconditions        are     necessary     but   not\n\nsufficient to prove vote dilution.              Johnson v. DeGrandy, 114 S.Ct.\n\n2647, 2657 (1994).       If those preconditions are established, the\n\nplaintiffs     must   further     prove       that   \"under     the   'totality    of\n\ncircumstances,' they do not possess the same opportunities to\n\nparticipate in the political process and elect representatives of\n\ntheir choice enjoyed by other voters.\"                  League of United Latin\n\nAmerican Citizens v. Clements, 999 F.2d 831, 849 (5th Cir. 1993)\n\n(en banc), cert. denied, 114 S.Ct. 878 (1994); see 42 U.S.C.\n\n§   1973(b).      Although   unlawful         vote   dilution    \"may   be   readily\n\nimagined and unsurprising\" where the three Gingles preconditions\n\nexist, that conclusion \"must still be addressed explicitly, and\n\nwithout isolating any other arguably relevant facts from the act of\n\njudgment.\"      Johnson, 114 S.Ct. at 2657.\n\n      We have previously explained that \"courts are guided in this\n\n[totality-of-circumstances] inquiry by the so-called Zimmer factors\n\nlisted in the Senate Report\" accompanying the 1982 Amendments to\n\nthe Voting Rights Act.          LULAC, 999 F.2d at 849.               Those factors\n\ninclude:\n\n      [T]he history of voting-related discrimination in the\n      State or political subdivision; the extent to which\n      voting in the elections of the States or political\n      subdivision is racially polarized; the extent to which\n      the State or political subdivision has used voting\n      practices or procedures that tend to enhance the\n      opportunity for discrimination against the minority\n      group, such as unusually large election districts,\n\n                                          5\n\f      majority vote requirements, and prohibitions against\n      bullet voting; the exclusion of members of the minority\n      group from candidate slating processes; the extent to\n      which minority group members bear the effects of past\n      discrimination in areas such as education, employment,\n      and health, which hinder their ability to participate\n      effectively in the political process; the use of overt or\n      subtle racial appeals in political campaigns; and the\n      extent to which members of the minority group have been\n      elected to public office in the jurisdiction.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 44-45.       In addition, \"evidence demonstrating\n\nthat elected officials are unresponsive to the particularized needs\n\nof the members of the minority group and that the policy underlying\n\nthe State's or the political subdivision's use of the contested\n\npractice or structure is tenuous may have probative value.\"          Id. at\n\n45.\n\n      Noting that the district court found on remand that the three\n\nGingles preconditions were satisfied, the plaintiffs challenge the\n\ndistrict   court's   conclusion    that,   under   the   totality   of   the\n\ncircumstances, the plaintiffs failed to prove a § 2 violation.           The\n\nplaintiffs refer to our statement in Clark that \"'it will be only\n\nthe very unusual case in which the plaintiffs can establish the\n\nexistence of the three Gingles factors but still have failed to\n\nestablish a violation of § 2 under the totality of circumstances.'\"\n\n21 F.3d at 97 (quoting Jenkins v. Red Clay Consol. Sch. Dist. Bd.\n\nof Educ., 4 F.3d 1103, 1135 (3d Cir. 1993)) (emphasis added); see\n\nalso NAACP v. City of Niagara Falls, New York, 65 F.3d 1002, 1019\n\nn.21 (2d Cir. 1995).\n\n      We initially note that our review is hampered by the district\n\ncourt's    curt   discussion      regarding   the    totality       of   the\n\ncircumstances. In our previous opinion, we instructed the district\n\n                                     6\n\fcourt on remand to \"reconsider its findings with respect to the\n\ntotality of circumstances.\"        21 F.3d at 97.        We further instructed\n\nthe   district   court    that    in   cases    where       the   three    Gingles\n\npreconditions    have    been    established,       it   \"'must     explain   with\n\nparticularity why it has concluded, under the particular facts of\n\nthat case, that an electoral system that routinely results in white\n\nvoters voting as a bloc to defeat the candidate of choice of a\n\npolitically cohesive minority group is not violative of § 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act.'\"       21 F.3d at 97 (quoting Jenkins, 4 F.3d at\n\n1135).   Despite these instructions, the district court readopted\n\nits earlier findings without elaboration and summarily concluded\n\nthat the existence of racially polarized voting in the county was\n\nnot sufficient to tip the balance in favor of the plaintiffs.                 This\n\ndiscussion is far from the particularized explanation that we\n\nexpected.    Normally,     we    would     remand    this    case    for   further\n\nconsideration.     However, we need not do so where the record\n\nestablishes unlawful vote dilution.          Harvell v. Blytheville School\n\nDist. #5, 71 F.3d 1382, 1390 (8th Cir. 1995) (en banc), cert.\n\ndenied, __ S.Ct. __ (1996).         We are persuaded that the district\n\ncourt's findings from its first opinion regarding the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, which the court readopted on remand, support the\n\nconclusion that Calhoun County's redistricting scheme violates § 2\n\nof the Voting Rights Act.        We do not suggest that the totality of\n\nthe circumstances is an empty formalism or that clearing the\n\nGingles hurdles preordains liability.          To the contrary, this final\n\ninquiry can be powerful indeed.          At the same time, it is more than\n\n\n                                       7\n\fan intuitive call of the trial judge; the trial court must anchor\n\nits judgment in evidence.\n\n                                       A.\n\n      In its first opinion, the district court found that racially\n\npolarized    voting    existed   in    Calhoun    County,   but   the     court\n\ndiscounted its importance due to the success of black candidates\n\nseeking election to several municipal and county offices.                     The\n\ncourt noted that black residents had been elected to the board of\n\naldermen in two predominately white municipalities in the county\n\nand that one black resident, who ran unopposed, had been elected\n\nelection commissioner in one of the predominately white districts.\n\n      On appeal, we concluded that the black electoral successes\n\ncited by the district court had \"limited relevance.\"              21 F.3d at\n\n96.   Citing Gingles, we explained that \"the election of some black\n\ncandidates does not negate a § 2 claim and does not establish that\n\npolarized voting does not exist,\" particularly when the election is\n\nunopposed.    Id.     We further explained that exogenous elections--\n\nthose not involving the particular office at issue--are less\n\nprobative than elections involving the specific office that is the\n\nsubject of the litigation.       Id.   at 97.    We instructed the district\n\ncourt on remand to \"accord greater weight to the virtual absence of\n\nblack electoral success in county-wide elections as opposed to\n\ntheir limited electoral success in municipal elections.\"                Id.\n\n      On remand, the district court reaffirmed its finding of\n\nracially polarized voting but construed our instruction as an\n\n\"invitation to find a section 2 violation simply because plaintiffs\n\n\n                                       8\n\fhave prevailed on the Gingles factors.\"           Correctly noting that the\n\nSupreme Court in Johnson had expressly rejected that reading of\n\n§ 2, the district court declined our \"invitation.\"\n\n     As we made clear prior to Johnson, the existence of the three\n\nGingles preconditions is necessary but not sufficient to prove a\n\n§ 2 violation.    See LULAC, 999 F.2d at 849.        However, the existence\n\nof racially polarized voting and the extent to which minorities are\n\nelected to public office remain the two most important factors\n\nconsidered in the totality-of-circumstances inquiry.            See Gingles,\n\n478 U.S. at 48 n.15; Westwego Citizens for Better Government v.\n\nCity of Westwego, 946 F.2d 1109, 1122 (5th Cir. 1991) (Westwego\n\nIII).\n\n     In this case, the district court's finding that racially\n\npolarized voting exists is beyond question.             In addition to the\n\n\"uncontradicted\" statistical evidence from the original trial, Dr.\n\nRichard   Engstrom,    a   Professor       of   Political   Science    at   the\n\nUniversity of New Orleans, analyzed four, multiracial elections in\n\nCalhoun County.       Using both regression and homogenous precinct\n\nanalysis, Dr. Engstrom concluded that a \"consistent relationship\"\n\nexisted between a voter's race and his voting preference in the\n\nfour exogenous elections.       For example, in the 1991 Democratic\n\nprimary for Constable, the black candidate received an estimated\n\n71.6% of the black vote but only 7.8% of the white vote.              Although\n\nstatistical evidence is not conclusive, see Clark, 21 F.3d at 96,\n\nthe record here supports no other conclusion but that racially\n\npolarized voting exists in Calhoun County.              Indeed, the County\n\n\n                                       9\n\foffers no other explanation of the divergent voting patterns.                See\n\nUno v. City of Holyoke, 72 F.3d 973, 983 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n     Moreover, the record demonstrates that black citizen have been\n\nunsuccessful in seeking public office.          The County emphasizes that\n\nblack    residents    have    been   elected    as     aldermen   in     several\n\nmunicipalities and, in one case, as an election commissioner.                 We\n\npreviously   addressed       the   probative   value    of   these     electoral\n\nsuccesses and noted their \"limited relevance.\"                21 F.3d at 96.\n\nEven so, \"the election of a few minority candidates does not\n\nnecessarily foreclose the possibility of dilution of the black\n\nvote.\"     S. Rep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 29 n.115 (1982)\n\n(internal quotation omitted), reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. 177,\n\n207 n.115; see also Gingles, 478 U.S. at 76; City of Niagara Falls,\n\n65 F.3d at 1009; Harvell, 71 F.3d at 1390.           Indeed, these isolated\n\nvictories, one of which occurred in a race with no opponent, do not\n\nmitigate the force of the district court's finding that \"[i]n this\n\ncentury, no black candidate has been elected in Calhoun County as\n\nsupervisor, justice court judge, constable, sheriff, circuit clerk,\n\nchancery clerk, tax assessor, superintendent of education, school\n\nboard member, coroner, county attorney, state senator, or state\n\nrepresentative.\"       Moreover, there is no suggestion that this\n\nstriking lack of electoral success is due to low voter turnout or\n\nblack support for non-minority candidates.             Cf. Alonzo v. City of\n\nCorpus Christi, 68 F.3d 944, 947 (5th Cir. 1995) (per curiam).\n\n     The County responds that few black residents have run for\n\ncounty office.       As an initial matter, we note that the County\n\n\n                                       10\n\foverstates the political reality.     The district court found in its\n\nfirst opinion that \"since 1980 blacks have sought the positions of\n\njustice court judge, constable, sheriff, and school board member.\"\n\nMore importantly, however, this argument begs the ultimate question\n\nwhether blacks \"possess the same opportunities to participate in\n\nthe political process and elect representatives of their choice\n\nenjoyed by other voters.\"     That few or no black citizens have\n\nsought public office in the challenged electoral system does not\n\npreclude a claim of vote dilution.

City of Westwego, 872 F.2d 1201, 1208 n.9 (5th Cir.\n\n1989) (Westwego I).   \"To hold otherwise would allow voting rights\n\ncases to be defeated at the outset by the very barriers to\n\npolitical participation that Congress has sought to remove.\"     Id.\n\n     In short, the presence of racially polarized voting and the\n\nvirtually complete absence of black elected officials in county\n\noffices provides striking evidence of vote dilution in Calhoun\n\nCounty.\n\n                                 B.\n\n     The Senate Report includes as one factor \"the extent to which\n\nthe State or political subdivision has used voting practices or\n\nprocedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination\n\nagainst the minority group, such as unusually large election\n\ndistricts, majority vote requirements, and prohibitions against\n\nbullet voting.\"   In its original opinion, the district court found\n\nthat Calhoun County did not employ large election districts or an\n\nanti-single shot provision.   The court found, however, that state\n\n\n                                 11\n\flaw requires that elections be conducted by majority vote.                            See\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 23-15-305.                 Although the district court noted\n\nthat abolishing the majority vote requirement might increase the\n\npossibility of electoral success for black candidates, it concluded\n\nthat    the      majority      vote     requirement       was        not   \"inherently\n\ndiscriminatory.\"\n\n       We agree with the plaintiffs that the district court misjudged\n\nthe weight to be accorded this finding.                        First, even if the\n\nmajority vote        requirement       is    not   \"inherently        discriminatory,\"\n\nCongress has included it as one factor to consider as part of the\n\ntotality-of-circumstances inquiry. We are not free to second-guess\n\nCongress' judgment regarding its importance.                    See Westwego I, 872\n\nF.2d at 1212.\n\n       Second,      under    certain     circumstances,         the    majority      vote\n\nrequirement \"can operate to the detriment of minority voters\" and\n\nnegate their political strength.                  Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1113\n\nn.4.    Where more than two candidates run for a particular office,\n\nthe majority vote requirement ensures that no candidate supported\n\nby only a minority, racial or otherwise, of the populace will\n\nsucceed.       In   the     presence    of    racially    polarized        voting,    the\n\nmajority vote requirement permits a white majority that scattered\n\nits    votes   among      several     white       candidates    in     a   election   to\n\nconsolidate its support behind the remaining white candidate in the\n\nrun-off    election,         thereby        defeating    the     minority-supported\n\ncandidate.     See Major v. Treen, 574 F.Supp. 325, 351 n.32 (E.D. La.\n\n1983) (three judge panel); see also Zimmer v. McKeithen, 485 F.2d\n\n\n                                             12\n\f1297, 1306 (5th Cir. 1973) (en banc) (noting that majority vote\n\nrequirement tends \"to submerge a political or racial minority\"),\n\naff'd sub nom. East Carroll Parish Sch. Bd. v. Marshall, 424 U.S.\n\n636 (1976) (per curiam).\n\n     This effect is more than a mere theoretical possibility, at\n\nleast in Calhoun County.        The record here discloses that on at\n\nleast one occasion, the majority vote requirement operated to the\n\ndetriment of black voters in Calhoun County by preventing the\n\nnomination of a black citizen as the Democratic candidate for\n\nconstable in Calhoun County.         In the first primary, the black\n\ncandidate, Tommy Pittman, finished first among all candidates, the\n\nrest of whom were white.      Pittman did not receive a majority of the\n\nvotes cast, however.      In the run-off, Pittman lost.\n\n                                    C.\n\n     Two factors from the Senate Report focus on the effect of past\n\ndiscrimination on the plaintiffs' ability to participate in the\n\npolitical process: 1) the history of voting-related discrimination\n\nin the State or political subdivision, and 2) the extent to which\n\nminority group members bear the effects of past discrimination in\n\nareas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their\n\nability    to   participate   effectively   in   the   political     process.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 44-45.          In its pre-remand opinion, the\n\ndistrict court found that \"in the past blacks were prevented from\n\nexercising their right to vote by intentionally discriminatory\n\nmechanisms.\"     Nevertheless, the court found this factor to be of\n\n\"limited    importance\"   because   \"past   history    cannot   be    forever\n\n\n                                    13\n\ffaulted for failures at the election box.\"              The district court\n\nexplained that at some point past discrimination must take on\n\n\"diminished importance.\"         In addition, the district court found\n\nthat \"the socio-economic status of blacks is significantly lower\n\nthan whites in Calhoun County\" but questioned without elaboration\n\nthe weight to be assigned to this finding.\n\n     The long and unhappy history of discrimination in Mississippi\n\nrequires no protracted discussion.         Calhoun County itself did not\n\ndesegregate its schools until 1969.           Nor need we tarry long in\n\nrecounting the socioeconomic disparity that continues to exist in\n\nCalhoun   County.       The   plaintiffs     produced   1990    census   data\n\ndisclosing, among other facts, that the per capita income of black\n\nresidents in Calhoun County is less than half that of white\n\nresidents.\n\n     The County concedes, as it must, that Calhoun County has a\n\nhistory of racial discrimination and that socioeconomic differences\n\nbetween   white   and   blacks    continue    to   exist   in   the   County.\n\nNevertheless, the County argues that the plaintiffs have not\n\nestablished a causal nexus between such past discrimination or\n\nsocioeconomic disparities, on the one hand, and any decreased level\n\nof black political participation, on the other.\n\n     In LULAC, we explained that while Congress has not insisted\n\nupon proof of a causal nexus between socioeconomic status and\n\ndepressed political participation, Congress \"did not dispense with\n\nproof that participation in the political process is in fact\n\ndepressed among minority citizens.\"          999 F.2d at 867; see S. Rep.\n\n\n                                     14\n\f417 at 29 n.114, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207 n.114.\n\nIndeed,      in   that   case,   we     held   that    proof   of   socioeconomic\n\ndisparities and a history of discrimination \"without more\" did not\n\nsuffice to establish the two Senate Report factors.                    999 F.2d at\n\n867.\n\n       The   district    court    did    not    make   any   finding    that    black\n\npolitical participation was depressed in Calhoun County.                       Nor do\n\nthe plaintiffs on appeal point to any evidence in the record\n\nshowing that black political participation compares unfavorably to\n\nthat of white residents in the county.                  The plaintiffs' expert\n\nwitness, Cheri McKinless, did testify at the first trial that\n\nindividuals of lower socioeconomic status were not as likely to\n\nvote as individuals of higher socioeconomic status.                    However, she\n\nbased her conclusion on political science literature, not \"an\n\n'intensely local appraisal' of the social and political climate\" of\n\nCalhoun County.          Id.     Indeed, in LULAC, we rejected similar\n\n\"armchair speculation\" as insufficient to establish that \"minority\n\nvoters in this case failed to participate equally in the political\n\nprocesses.\"        Id.\n\n       In short, we are not persuaded that the district court erred\n\nin     disregarding      the     history       of   past     discrimination       and\n\nsocioeconomic disparity in Calhoun County.\n\n                                          D.\n\n       In its pre-remand opinion, the district court found that\n\nCalhoun County officials were responsive to concerns of its black\n\nresidents.        The court explained:\n\n\n                                          15\n\f     First, it is unrefuted that the County has recently paved\n     and/or    repaved    roads   in    predominately    black\n     neighborhoods. . . . Second, it has been stipulated that\n     blacks hold appointive positions on approximately one-\n     third of the County Boards and Commissions.          This\n     represents, in this court's mind, a concern that blacks\n     be afforded a voice in matters affecting the citizenry.\n     Finally, the County, in appointing the biracial committee\n     and holding public hearings on the proposed redistricting\n     plan, made a concerted effort to comply with the mandates\n     of the Voting Rights Act. From the beginning, Calhoun\n     County recognized the need for redistricting and\n     attempted to procure Section 2 compliance via an open,\n     public forum.     The black members appointed to the\n     biracial committee were, according to the testimony, well\n     respected and influential citizens in the black\n     community; some, like Ms. Rose, were college educated.\n     These are not the actions of a county which is oblivious\n     to the needs and concerns of the black community or\n     disrespectful of the mandates of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n     With one caveat, we find no merit to the suggestion that the\n\ndistrict court's finding of responsiveness is clearly erroneous.\n\nOther governmental entities have done more than Calhoun County to\n\ndemonstrate their responsiveness to minority concerns.   See, e.g.,\n\nCity of Niagara Falls, 65 F.3d at 1023 (noting that the city, inter\n\nalia, established an affirmative action task force, adopted a fair\n\nhousing law, and established a minority business loan fund).\n\nNevertheless, the County's road-paving and its use of a biracial\n\ncommission to approve the current redistricting plan support the\n\nfinding that the County is responsive to the needs of the black\n\ncommunity.   The formation of the biracial commission in particular\n\ndemonstrates the County's sensitivity to the concerns of its black\n\ncitizens.    Although the record discloses that Three Rivers did not\n\ninform the commission that it was possible to create a majority-\n\nminority district, that fact alone does not undermine the district\n\ncourt's finding.    Indeed, there is no suggestion that the anyone\n\n                                  16\n\fdeliberately misled that commission or that the commission served\n\nonly to rubberstamp redistricting plans already approved by the\n\nboard of supervisors.\n\n       We part company with the district court, however, regarding\n\nits reliance on black membership on county commissions. The number\n\nof minority members on county commissions is a poor barometer of\n\nthe county's responsiveness to the needs of its black citizenry.\n\nJudging responsiveness by counting members of county commissions is\n\nakin to judging the emptiness of a glass of water half full:\n\nwhether it is half full or half empty depends on who you ask.             Even\n\nso, we agree with the plaintiffs that the district court erred in\n\nthis case by focusing on how many minority board members there\n\nwere, instead of how few.       That four of the fourteen county boards\n\nor commissions have black members overlooks that ten do not.\n\nMoreover, the record discloses that of the four boards that do have\n\nminority representation, three have only one black member and the\n\nother has only two black members.           Of the 72 appointed officials,\n\nonly    five   are   black,   less   than   7%   of   the   total   membership.\n\nSimilarly, the district court found that only 6 of the county's 75\n\nemployees were black.\n\n       Although the district court's finding of responsiveness was\n\nnot clearly erroneous, we are persuaded that the district court\n\nattached too much weight to its finding.              First, the finding of\n\nresponsiveness has \"limited relevance.\"           Westwego III, 946 F.2d at\n\n1122.    The Senate Report explained:\n\n       Unresponsiveness is not an essential part of plaintiff's\n       case.      Therefore,   defendants'    proof   of   some\n\n                                       17\n\f     responsiveness would not negate plaintiff's showing by\n     other, more objective factors enumerated here that\n     minority voters nevertheless were shut out of equal\n     access to the political process.\n\nS. Rep. 417 at 29 n.116, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207\n\nn.116; see also Westwego I, 872 F.2d at 1213 n.15.                 Indeed, in\n\nWestwego III, we rendered judgment for the plaintiffs, even though\n\nwe agreed with the district court that the plaintiffs had failed to\n\nprove a lack of responsiveness by city officials.                 946 F.2d at\n\n1123; see also Harvell, 71 F.3d at 1391 (noting that \"[e]ven\n\naccepting the finding of responsiveness as not clearly erroneous,\n\nhowever, it is similarly insufficient to counter the other factors\n\nthat censure this scheme\").\n\n     Second, the district court's finding of responsiveness cannot\n\nbe weighed in the abstract.      Responsiveness, like many things, is\n\na question of both kind and degree.              While two cities may both be\n\nsaid to be responsive to minority needs, the two may vary greatly\n\nin approach and commitment.      The totality-of-circumstances inquiry\n\nis not blind to those differences.            Although we acknowledge that\n\ndiscerning   those      differences        demands    difficult   qualitative\n\njudgments,   see   S.   Rep.   417    at    29    n.115,   reprinted   in   1982\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 207 n.115 (noting responsiveness is less objective\n\nfactor than others), we are reminded that \"[i]n countless areas of\n\nthe law weighty legal conclusions frequently rest on methodologies\n\nthat would make scientists blush.\"               LULAC, 999 F.2d at 860.     We\n\noffer no bright line here.           We are content to note that paving\n\nroads left unpaved by years of discrimination and appointing a\n\nbiracial redistricting commission do not reflect the comprehensive\n\n                                      18\n\fand systematic responsiveness to minority needs that is entitled to\n\nsubstantial weight in the totality-of-circumstances inquiry.             Cf.\n\nCity   of   Niagara   Falls,   65   F.3d   at   1023   (describing    city's\n\n\"numerous\" efforts to address minority needs).\n\n                                     E.\n\n       In its pre-remand opinion, the district court accepted the\n\nCounty's proffered justification for the current plan, finding that\n\n\"attempting to maintain districts with equal road mileage is\n\nnontenuous.\"    The plaintiffs challenge this finding, claiming that\n\nthere is no evidence that the creation of a majority-minority\n\ndistrict is incompatible with this interest.           The County defends\n\nthe district court's finding and argues that its interest in\n\nmaintaining districts with equal road mileage should be given\n\nsubstantial weight.     See LULAC, 999 F.2d at 871.\n\n       We find no merit to the suggestion that the County must prove\n\nthat the challenged electoral system is necessary to achieve its\n\ninterest in equalizing road mileage among districts.          Id. at 875-\n\n76. We do, however, agree that this factor deserves little weight.\n\nIn Jones v. City of Lubbock, 727 F.2d 364, 383 (5th Cir. 1984), we\n\ndescribed this factor as having \"diminished importance,\" and we\n\nexpressed doubt \"that the tenuousness factor has any probative\n\nvalue for evaluating the 'fairness' of the electoral system's\n\nimpact.\"\n\n       Our decision in LULAC does not undermine but rather supports\n\nthat conclusion.      In that case, we distinguished between a non-\n\ntenuous state interest and a substantial state interest.             999 F.2d\n\n\n                                     19\n\fat 870 (noting that Texas did not assert non-tenuous but rather\n\nsubstantial interest).         Although we noted that \"[t]he weight, as\n\nwell as tenuousness, of the state's interest is a legitimate factor\n\nin   analyzing   the   totality    of   circumstances,\"    id.   at   871,   we\n\nreaffirmed that \"[p]roof of a merely non-tenuous state interest\n\ndiscounts one Zimmer factor, but cannot defeat liability.\"              Id.\n\n      The district court here did not characterize the County's\n\ninterest   in    equalizing      road    mileage    in   the   districts     as\n\nsubstantial.     Nor likely could it.            The County points to no\n\ndecision holding that its interest in equal road mileage among\n\nelection districts is substantial.           The administrative convenience\n\nof such a system is evident, but the County's asserted interest\n\npales in comparison to that upheld in LULAC.             Id. at 872 (noting\n\nTexas' interest is a \"key component\" of what defines or \"what\n\nconstitutes a state court judge\").           Indeed, there is no suggestion\n\nthat equal road mileage is \"integral\" to the office of county\n\nsupervisor, much less to the office of election commissioner or\n\nboard of education.      Id.\n\n                                        F.\n\n      In Gingles, the Court noted that the Senate Report advised\n\nthat \"there is no requirement that any particular number of factors\n\nbe proved, or that a majority of them point one way or the other.\"\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 45.          In this case, we are persuaded that,\n\nunder the totality of the circumstances, the plaintiffs have\n\ndemonstrated a § 2 violation.       Neither the County's responsiveness\n\nto its black citizenry nor its interest in equalizing road mileage\n\n\n                                        20\n\famong districts mitigates the striking lack of black electoral\n\nsuccess in county elections and the \"uncontradicted\" existence of\n\nracially polarized voting.          In short, this is not that \"unusual\n\ncase\" in which the three Gingles preconditions are satisfied but\n\nthe totality of circumstances fail to show a § 2 violation.               See,\n\ne.g., City of Niagara Falls, 65 F.3d at 1020 (concluding that,\n\nunder totality of circumstances, no § 2 violation existed where\n\n\"many\"    of   the    Senate      Report    factors   pointed   against   the\n\nplaintiffs).     The district court's finding to the contrary is\n\nclearly erroneous.\n\n                                      III.\n\n     As an alternative ground for affirming the judgment of the\n\ndistrict court, the County argues that the proposed majority-\n\nminority district violates the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment.       The County relies on the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in Miller v. Johnson, 115 S.Ct. 2475, 2488 (1995), which\n\nheld that strict scrutiny applies to redistricting plans where\n\n\"race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's\n\ndecision to place a significant number of voters within or without\n\na   particular       district.\"       The    County   claims    that   racial\n\nconsiderations dominated the drawing of the proposed black-majority\n\ndistrict in Calhoun County and that, therefore, the proposed\n\ndistrict is unconstitutional after Miller.\n\n     The County's argument has more bite than might appear at first\n\nglance.    Its implications travel far beyond Calhoun County and\n\nthreaten the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act itself. In\n\n\n                                       21\n\flight of this, it is not surprising that we have been chary of\n\nreaching the issue of Miller's applicability to vote dilution\n\nclaims brought pursuant to § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.                   See,\n\ne.g., Alonzo, 68 F.3d at 947 n.2 (reserving the question).                We are\n\nloathe to revisit that Act's validity, and upon closer examination,\n\nwe   are   not    persuaded    that   Miller   and   its   progeny   prohibit\n\nredistricting plans drawn to remedy violations of § 2 of the Voting\n\nRights Act.       We begin with Miller.\n\n                                       A.\n\n      In Miller, the Supreme Court confronted the constitutionality\n\nof   Georgia's      Eleventh   Congressional    District,     one    of   three\n\nmajority-minority districts in the State. Drawn in response to the\n\nJustice Department's refusal to preclear earlier reapportionment\n\nplans pursuant to § 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the Eleventh\n\nDistrict mimicked Sherman's March-to-the-Sea, traversing the 260\n\nmiles from Atlanta to Savannah. A three-judge district court panel\n\nfound that race was the dominant purpose in creating the Eleventh\n\nDistrict.    On appeal to the Supreme Court, the appellants did not\n\ncontest the district court's finding but rather claimed that the\n\nlegislature's motivation by itself did not suffice to state a claim\n\nunder Shaw v. Reno, 113 S.Ct. 2816 (1993).           Rather, the appellants\n\nargued that the district court must find that the district's shape\n\nwas so bizarre on its face as to be unexplainable on grounds other\n\nthan race.       The Supreme Court disagreed.\n\n      Noting that the Equal Protection Clause subjects facially-\n\nneutral statutes motivated by racial considerations to strict\n\n\n                                       22\n\fscrutiny, the Court rejected the view that bizarre shape was a\n\nprerequisite to an equal protection claim:\n\n      Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary\n      element of the constitutional wrong or a threshold\n      requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive\n      circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and\n      not other districting principles, was the legislature's\n      dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its\n      district lines.\n\n115 S.Ct. at 2486.           The Court made clear that plaintiffs who\n\nchallenge     the    constitutionality      of    reapportionment      plans    \"are\n\nneither     confined    in   their   proof       to    evidence     regarding   the\n\ndistrict's geometry and makeup nor required to make a threshold\n\nshowing of bizarreness.\"        Id. at 2488.\n\n      The    Court     encountered    greater         difficulty,    however,    in\n\naffirmatively defining the plaintiff's burden of proof.                  The Court\n\nacknowledged that legislatures will \"almost always be aware of\n\nracial demographics; but it does not follow that race predominates\n\nin   the    redistricting     process.\"      Id.        Distinguishing     between\n\npermissible     awareness      and   impermissible         motivation    \"may    be\n\ndifficult\" and will require courts \"to exercise extraordinary\n\ncaution in adjudicating claims that a state has drawn district\n\nlines on the basis of race.\"                Id.        Nevertheless, the Court\n\nattempted a definition:\n\n      The plaintiff's burden is to show, either through\n      circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and\n      demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative\n      purpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating\n      the legislature's decision to place a significant number\n      of voters within or without a particular district. To\n      make this showing, a plaintiff must prove that the\n      legislature   subordinated    traditional    race-neutral\n      districting principles, including but not limited to\n      compactness,    contiguity,    respect   for    political\n\n                                       23\n\f        subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared\n        interests, to racial considerations.\n\nId.     Justice O'Connor added in her concurring opinion that this\n\nstandard was \"a demanding one,\" requiring the plaintiff to show\n\nthat the legislature \"has relied on race in substantial disregard\n\nof customary and traditional districting practices.\"                      Id. at 2497\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring).           In those cases where the plaintiff\n\nsuccessfully proves that race was the \"predominant, overriding\"\n\nconsideration motivating the drawing of district lines, the burden\n\nshifts to the defendant to demonstrate that its districting plan is\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.\n\nId. at 2490.\n\n        Agreeing with the district court that race was the predominant\n\nfactor       motivating   the   drawing     of       the   Eleventh     Congressional\n\nDistrict, the Court turned to the requirements of strict scrutiny.\n\nGeorgia argued that compliance with the preclearance requirement of\n\n§   5   of    the   Voting   Rights   Act      was    a    compelling    governmental\n\ninterest.       The Court did not reach the validity of that position:\n\n        Whether or not in some cases compliance with the Voting\n        Rights Act, standing alone, can provide a compelling\n        interest independent of any interest in remedying past\n        discrimination, it cannot do so here. As we suggested in\n        Shaw, compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws\n        cannot   justify   race-based   districting  where   the\n        challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a\n        constitutional reading and application of those laws.\n\nId. at 2490-91.\n\n        The   Court   concluded    that     the      Eleventh    District    was   not\n\nrequired by the Voting Rights Act \"under a correct reading of the\n\nstatute.\"      Id. at 2491.     That Georgia drew the Eleventh District in\n\n\n                                          24\n\forder to obtain preclearance under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act did\n\nnot mean that the plan was required by the Act.                Id.   To the\n\ncontrary, the Eleventh District was not required under the Act\n\n\"because there was no reasonable basis to believe that Georgia's\n\nearlier enacted plans violated § 5.\"         Id. at 2492.   Noting that the\n\nearlier    plans   had   increased   the    number   of   majority-minority\n\ndistricts from the previous apportionment, the Court explained that\n\nsuch ameliorative plans did not violate § 5 \"unless the new\n\napportionment itself so discriminates on the basis of race or color\n\nas to violate the Constitution.\"          Id.\n\n     The Court added that the Justice Department's interpretation\n\nof § 5 as authorizing it to preclear only those reapportionment\n\nplans     that   maximized   majority-minority       districts    portended\n\nconstitutional difficulties for § 5 and brought the Voting Rights\n\nAct \"into tension with the Fourteenth Amendment.\"             Id. at 2493.\n\nThe Court eschewed reaching the constitutional question, however,\n\nnoting only that there was no indication that Congress intended § 5\n\nof the Voting Rights Act to reach as far as the Justice Department\n\nhad pushed it.     Id.\n\n     Miller left open several critical questions.                The Court\n\nassumed but did not decide that compliance with the Voting Rights\n\nAct constituted a compelling governmental interest.              Moreover,\n\nMiller did not address in what instances a State may draw majority-\n\nminority districts to remedy potential or adjudicated violations of\n\n§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                     25\n\f     Second,    while   Miller   left    these   issues   unresolved,   its\n\ncondemnation of race-based districting decisions was loud and\n\nclear.    The Court described the evils of race-based redistricting,\n\ndeclaring    that   \"'[r]acial   gerrymandering,     even   for    remedial\n\npurposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions; it\n\nthreatens to carry us further from the goal of a political system\n\nin which race no longer matters--a goal that the Fourteenth and\n\nFifteenth Amendments embody, and to which the Nation continues to\n\naspire.'\"    Id. at 2486 (quoting Shaw, 113 S.Ct. at 2832) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n     The Court's recent decisions in Bush v. Vera, 1996 WL 315857\n\n(1996), and Shaw v. Hunt, 1996 WL 315870 (1996) (Shaw II), built\n\nupon the framework established by Miller and resolved several of\n\nthe questions Miller had left unanswered.            In Bush, the Court\n\nstruck down three majority-minority Congressional districts in\n\nTexas as violative of the Equal Protection Clause.                The three\n\ndistricts were the product of the Texas legislature's effort to\n\nincrease the number of majority-minority districts in the State.\n\nNo opinion commanded a majority. Justice O'Connor, writing for two\n\nother Justices, began her analysis by noting that strict scrutiny\n\ndoes not apply to all cases involving the intentional creation of\n\nmajority-minority districts.       1996 WL 315857, at *5.           Rather,\n\nJustice O'Connor reaffirmed Miller's predominant factor test and\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\ffound that the three challenged districts all failed that test,\n\nthereby triggering strict scrutiny.2\n\n     To justify its race-based redistricting, Texas pointed to\n\nthree interests:    the interest in avoiding liability under § 2 of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act, the interest in remedying past and present\n\ndiscrimination, and the interest in complying with § 5 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act.       It is the Court's treatment of the first\n\ninterest that concerns us the most in this case.\n\n     In her opinion for the plurality, Justice O'Connor assumed\n\nwithout deciding that compliance with § 2 of the Voting Rights Act\n\nconstituted a compelling governmental interest.                   Id. at *15.\n\nAlthough strict scrutiny is a demanding standard, Justice O'Connor\n\nexplained that the narrow tailoring prong of the test permitted the\n\nStates   \"a   limited   degree   of   leeway\"      in   drawing   a   remedial,\n\nmajority-minority district.      Id.       To demonstrate that a majority-\n\nminority district is reasonably necessary to comply with § 2, the\n\nState must have a \"strong basis in evidence\" for finding that the\n\nthree Gingles preconditions exist.           Id.\n\n\n\n     2\n          Justices Thomas and Scalia, who did not join Justice\nO'Connor's opinion for the plurality but provided a majority by\nconcurring in the judgment, disagreed with the plurality on this\npoint and concluded that the intentional creation of a majority-\nminority district was sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. Id.\nat *27. On this point, at least six Justices sided with Justice\nO'Connor's view of the law.     Compare id. at *5 (O'Connor, J.,\njoined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Kennedy, J.); id. at *31 & n.7\n(Stevens, J., joined by Ginsburg and Breyer, J.J., dissenting); id.\nat *56 (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg and Breyer, J.J.,\ndissenting) with id. at *25 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (reserving\nthe question) and id. at *27 (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment).\n\n                                      27\n\f       Although Justice O'Connor was willing to assume the existence\n\nof the last two Gingles preconditions in the instant case, she\n\nconcluded that the challenged districts' bizarre shape and lack of\n\ncompactness \"defeat[ed] any claim that the districts are narrowly\n\ntailored to serve the State's interest in avoiding liability under\n\n§ 2.\"    Id. at *16.    Although \"[a] § 2 district that is reasonably\n\ncompact and regular, taking into account traditional districting\n\nprinciples    such     as    maintaining   communities   of   interest    and\n\ntraditional boundaries, may pass strict scrutiny without having to\n\ndefeat rival compact districts designed by plaintiffs' experts in\n\nendless 'beauty contests,'\" id. at *15, a non-compact majority-\n\nminority district is not required by § 2 and, therefore, fails the\n\nnarrowly tailored prong of strict scrutiny.          Id. at *16.   Justices\n\nThomas and Scalia, concurring in the judgment, agreed without\n\nelaboration that the districts were not narrowly tailored.           Id. at\n\n*29.\n\n       Of particular significance, both Justice O'Connor and Justice\n\nKennedy   filed   concurring      opinions   that   further   addressed   the\n\nrelationship between the Equal Protection Clause and § 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act.          Although Justice O'Connor's opinion for the\n\nplurality only assumed that compliance with the Voting Rights Act\n\nwas a compelling governmental interest, Justice O'Connor expressly\n\nadopted that position in her separate concurring opinion.           See id.\n\nat *21.    On this point, at least four other Justices agreed with\n\nJustice O'Connor.      See id. at *41 (Stevens, J., joined by Ginsburg\n\nand Breyer, J.J., dissenting); id. at *46, *56 (Souter, J., joined\n\n\n                                      28\n\fby Ginsburg and Breyer, J.J., dissenting).              Moreover, Justice\n\nO'Connor opined that \"if a State pursues that compelling interest\n\nby creating a district that 'substantially addresses' the potential\n\nliability, and does not deviate substantially from a hypothetical\n\ncourt-drawn § 2 district for predominantly racial reasons, its\n\ndistricting plan will be deemed narrowly tailored.\"            Id. at *23.\n\n      Justice Kennedy agreed that the three challenged districts\n\nwere not narrowly tailored to serve the asserted interest in\n\ncomplying with § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, but his approach\n\ndiffered slightly from the plurality's.           Id. at *25.       Justice\n\nKennedy noted that the first Gingles precondition focuses not on\n\nthe   compactness   of   the    contested    district    but   rather    the\n\ncompactness of the minority population.         Id.     As a consequence,\n\nJustice Kennedy was willing to assume that Texas had a strong basis\n\nin evidence for concluding that all three Gingles preconditions\n\nexisted.   Indeed, only if all three Gingles preconditions were met\n\nwould a court reach the question whether the challenged district\n\nwas narrowly tailored to remedying the potential § 2 violation.\n\n      Nevertheless, the challenged districts' lack of compactness,\n\nwhich persuaded Justice O'Connor that the first Gingles factor was\n\nnot met, persuaded Justice Kennedy that the districts did not\n\nsubstantially address the potential § 2 violation. Emphasizing the\n\nplurality's    statement       that    the   remedial    district       \"must\n\n'substantially address the § 2 violation'\" to satisfy the narrow\n\ntailoring prong of strict scrutiny, Justice Kennedy attempted to\n\ngive content to that phrase by noting that a State \"may not engage\n\n\n                                      29\n\fin districting based on race except as reasonably necessary to cure\n\nthe anticipated § 2 violation, nor may it use race as a proxy to\n\nserve other interests.\"    Id. at *26 (emphasis added).         In Justice\n\nKennedy's eyes, the inclusion of some minority communities that\n\n\"could not possibly form part of a compact majority-minority\n\ndistrict\" belied the claim that Texas drew the district to remedy\n\na potential § 2 violation.         Id.     Justice Kennedy cautioned,\n\nhowever, that the Court's focus on compactness did not mean that\n\nall majority-minority districts had to be compact to satisfy\n\nconstitutional scrutiny.      To the contrary, \"[d]istricts not drawn\n\nfor impermissible reasons or according to impermissible criteria\n\nmay take any shape, even a bizarre one.\"          Id. at *27.\n\n     Shaw II, which was decided the same day as Bush, invalidated\n\nNorth Carolina's Twelfth Congressional District, a \"serpentine\"\n\ndistrict 160 miles in length and often no wider than the interstate\n\nthat it followed in its \"snake-like\" trek through the heart of the\n\nState.   1996 WL 315870, at *3, *4.      Applying Miller's predominant\n\npurpose test, the Court found that race was the predominant factor\n\nin drawing the challenged district.        Id. at *4.     As in Bush, the\n\nCourt assumed that compliance with the Voting Rights Act was a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, see id. at *6 n.4, *9, but it\n\nconcluded that District 12 was not narrowly tailored to that end.\n\nId. at   *10.   The   Court    explained   that    the   majority-minority\n\ndistrict \"must, at a minimum, remedy the anticipated violation [of\n\n§ 2] or achieve compliance to be narrowly tailored.\"            Id. at *9.\n\nNoting that the first Gingles precondition requires the existence\n\n\n                                   30\n\fof a geographically compact minority group, Chief Justice Rehnquist\n\ndeclared that \"[n]o one looking at District 12 could reasonably\n\nsuggest that the district contains a 'geographically compact'\n\npopulation of any race.\"             Id. at *10.\n\n      Taken   together,         these       decisions     establish       a    number    of\n\nimportant propositions. First, race-based redistricting, even that\n\ndone for remedial purposes, is subject to strict scrutiny. Second,\n\ncompliance    with   §     2    of    the     Voting    Rights   Act      constitutes     a\n\ncompelling governmental interest.                  Third, the State must have a\n\nstrong basis in evidence for concluding that the three Gingles\n\npreconditions exist in order to claim that its redistricting plan\n\nis reasonably necessary to comply with § 2.                      Fourth, a tailored\n\nresponse to a found violation must use race at the expense of\n\ntraditional political concerns no more than is reasonably necessary\n\nto remedy the wrong.           With these propositions in mind, we turn to\n\nthe County's arguments in this case.\n\n                                              B.\n\n      The County frames its Miller argument in two ways.                        First, it\n\nclaims that Miller limits the scope of the first Gingles factor,\n\nwhich    requires    proof      that    a     geographically     compact        majority-\n\nminority district can be created.                  According to the County, the\n\nplaintiffs'    proposed         redistricting          plans   violate        Miller    and,\n\ntherefore,    are    not       \"a    proper    foundation      for    a   holding      that\n\nPlaintiffs-Appellants have satisfied the first Gingles precondition\n\nof   a   sufficiently      numerous,          geographically         compact     minority\n\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\fpopulation.\"       To fully understand the County's argument, we must\n\nreturn to our first decision in this case.\n\n      In the first appeal, the County claimed that the Supreme\n\nCourt's then-recent decision in Shaw supported the district court's\n\nfinding that the plaintiffs had not established the first Gingles\n\nfactor.      According      to   the    County,      a   districting     scheme   that\n\nviolated Shaw's requirement of compactness per se failed to satisfy\n\nthe first Gingles precondition.                   We acknowledged Shaw's holding\n\nthat a voting scheme \"so extremely irregular on its face that it\n\nrationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races\n\nfor purposes of voting\" stated a claim under the Equal Protection\n\nClause.     However, we noted that the proposed district in this case\n\nwas \"not nearly as bizarre as the district under consideration in\n\nShaw.\" 21 F.3d at 95.               We consequently refused to determine\n\n\"whether a bizarrely-shaped district which would enable plaintiffs\n\nto   state    a    claim    under      the    Equal      Protection    Clause     would\n\nnecessarily flunk the Gingles compactness test.\"                      Id. at 95-96.\n\n      The    County's      Miller   contention        builds   upon     this   earlier\n\nargument.         According to the County, Miller clarifies Shaw by\n\nexplaining that the gravamen of an Equal Protection claim is not\n\nthe shape of the district but rather the legislature's motivation\n\nor purpose in drawing the district as it did.                           The argument\n\ncontinues that the plaintiffs' predominant concern with race in\n\ndrawing their proposed district places it squarely within Miller\n\nand therefore outside the first Gingles factor.                       Stated another\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\fway, a proposed district that violates Miller does not satisfy the\n\nfirst Gingles factor per se.\n\n       We agree with the County's reading of Miller but disagree that\n\nMiller is relevant to the first Gingles factor.                   In contrast to\n\nShaw's focus on compactness, Miller explained that compactness was\n\nnot the gravamen of Equal Protection challenges to reapportionment\n\nplans.       To the contrary, compactness was merely one among many\n\nfactors whose presence bore on the ultimate question whether race\n\nwas the predominant factor motivating the drawing of particular\n\ndistrict lines.\n\n       In contrast to Miller's focus on motivation, the first Gingles\n\nfactor requires that the plaintiff demonstrate that the minority\n\ngroup    is    \"sufficiently     large    and     geographically     compact   to\n\nconstitute a majority in a single-member district.\"                 Gingles, 478\n\nU.S.    at    50.    Plaintiffs    typically       attempt   to    satisfy   this\n\nrequirement by drawing hypothetical majority-minority districts.\n\nWhen    combined    with   the   second       Gingles   factor   requiring   that\n\nminority voters demonstrate their political cohesiveness, the first\n\nGingles factor ensures that the minority has the potential to elect\n\na representative of its own choice in some single-member district.\n\nSee Growe, 113 S.Ct. at 1084; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50 & n.17.\n\nAbsent a satisfactory showing on the first Gingles factor, minority\n\nvoters cannot claim that it is the current districting system and\n\nnot, for example, geographic dispersal that is the source of their\n\ndisproportionately weak political strength.               Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n\n50 n.17.\n\n\n                                         33\n\f     Bush and Shaw II support our conclusion that Miller's emphasis\n\non purpose does not apply to the first Gingles precondition.                      In\n\nneither case did the Court suggest that a district drawn for\n\npredominantly racial reasons would necessarily fail the Gingles\n\ntest. To the contrary, the first Gingles factor is an inquiry into\n\ncausation that necessarily classifies voters by their race.\n\n     In short, we do not understand Miller and its progeny to work\n\na change in the first Gingles inquiry into whether a sufficiently\n\nlarge and compact district can be drawn in which the powerful\n\nminority would constitute a majority. See Harvell, 71 F.3d at 1391\n\n(noting that Miller \"did not purport to alter our inquiry into the\n\nvote-dilution claim\").     To be sure, this test of causation insists\n\nupon a compact district, and a remedial response narrowly tailored\n\nto remedying a found violation must also be compact.                 As we will\n\nexplain, however, that tailored response must use race at the\n\nexpense    of   traditional    political         concerns   no   more    than     is\n\nreasonably necessary to remedy the found wrong.\n\n                                       C.\n\n     Alternatively, the County argues that we should affirm the\n\njudgment    below    because   there        is   no   constitutional      remedy.\n\nAccording to the County, the plaintiffs' proposed redistricting\n\nplans violate Miller.      The County argues that, consequently, it\n\nwould be subject to lawsuits under Miller if it were to implement\n\none of the plaintiffs' proposed redistricting plans.                The argument\n\nis that the County did not violate § 2 because the plaintiffs'\n\nproposed    remedy    violates    the        Equal     Protection       Clause.\n\n\n                                       34\n\f      To the extent that the County challenges the remedy, it is not\n\nripe for our review.       Plaintiffs’ majority-minority districts were\n\nidentified in answer to the first Gingles inquiry into causation.\n\nSee   Clark,   21   F.3d   at   95   (noting   that   plaintiffs'   proposed\n\ndistricts were \"simply presented to demonstrate that a majority-\n\nblack district is feasible in Calhoun County\").           Calhoun County's\n\nBoard of Supervisors has primary jurisdiction over its electoral\n\nsystem.   \"It must be left to that body to develop, in the first\n\ninstance, a plan which will remedy the dilution of the votes of the\n\ncity's black citizens.\"         Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1124; see also\n\nClark, 21 F.3d at 95 (noting that \"the county will be given the\n\nfirst opportunity to develop a remedial plan\"). That body is free,\n\nwithin limits,3 to develop a different remedial plan from those\n\nproposed by the plaintiffs.\n\n      This is not to say that Bush does not insist that districting\n\nplans drawn to remedy potential violations of the Voting Rights Act\n\nescape scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. 1996 WL 315857,\n\nat *15-16.      It is true that here, unlike Bush, there is an\n\nadjudicated violation of the Voting Rights Act, but that does not\n\nremove the constitutional constraints.            See Dillard v. City of\n\nGreensboro, 74 F.3d 230, 233-34 (11th Cir. 1996) (applying Miller\n\nto redistricting plan imposed by district court to remedy § 2\n\nviolation).    It is also true that Miller, Bush, and Shaw II make\n\n\n          If the board of supervisors \"fails to develop such a plan\nin a timely manner, or fails to develop a plan which fully remedies\nthe current vote dilution, the responsibility for devising a\nremedial plan will devolve onto the federal district court.\"\nWestwego III, 946 F.2d at 1124.\n\n                                      35\n\fclear    that        a    majority-minority        district     is     not     per      se\n\nunconstitutional.             Calhoun    County's    argument    to    the   contrary\n\nglosses over a number of required analytical steps.\n\n       Bush established a two-part inquiry for determining whether a\n\nmajority-minority district passes constitutional muster.                          Such a\n\ndistrict is constitutional if the State has a \"strong basis in\n\nevidence\" for concluding that the three Gingles preconditions are\n\npresent and if the district drawn in order to satisfy § 2 does not\n\n\"subordinate          traditional        districting     principles          to      race\n\nsubstantially more than is 'reasonably necessary' to avoid § 2\n\nliability.\"         1996 WL 315857, at *16.           Although a State need not\n\nawait judicial findings to that effect, see id. at *23 (O'Connor,\n\nJ., concurring), we have already found that the three Gingles\n\npreconditions exist here.\n\n       To be narrowly tailored, the remedial district must use race\n\nat the expense of traditional political concerns no more than is\n\nreasonably necessary to remedy the found wrong.                       Stated another\n\nway,    the       remedial    district    must     \"substantially      address\"        the\n\nviolation and \"not deviate substantially from a hypothetical court-\n\ndrawn   §     2    district    for   predominantly      racial   reasons.\"             Id.\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring); id. at *26 (Kennedy, J., concurring);\n\nsee also Shaw II, 1996 WL 315870, at *9 (holding that majority-\n\nminority district must, \"at a minimum,\" remedy the violation to be\n\nnarrowly tailored).             As this language suggests, the proposed\n\nmajority-minority district used to satisfy the first Gingles factor\n\nexemplifies         the   narrowly      tailored    district.        Indeed,      it    is\n\n\n                                           36\n\fdeviations from this district that raise problems.                        See Bush, 1996\n\nWL 315857, at *16; Shaw II, 1996 WL 315870, at *10.                                And, of\n\ncourse, a district court supervising the development of a remedy\n\nmay    reject   a     proposed       remedial    district          that   \"substantially\n\ndeviates\" from the hypothetical district.\n\n       There    has    been    no     finding     that       the     plaintiffs'      plans\n\nsubordinate traditional race-neutral districting plans to racial\n\nconsiderations.         The plaintiffs presented several redistricting\n\nplans to the district court, one of which allegedly made \"minimal\n\nchanges to existing districts and precinct lines.\" Compare Miller,\n\n115    S.Ct.    at    2497    (O'Connor,        J.,    concurring)          (noting    that\n\npredominant factor test is \"a demanding one\") with Quilter v.\n\nVoinovich, 912 F. Supp. 1006, 1019 (N.D. Ohio) (holding that\n\npredominant factor test is satisfied where \"a state substantially\n\ncomplies with traditional districting principles\" but \"gives them\n\nless     weight       in     the      apportionment          process        than    racial\n\nconsiderations\"), appeal dismissed, 116 S.Ct. 42 (1995).                           Whether\n\nthose   changes       are    truly    \"minimal\"       and,    if     not,    whether   the\n\ndistricts use race no more than is reasonably necessary to remedy\n\nthe found violation are questions best left to the district court\n\non remand.\n\n       Redistricting to remedy found violations of § 2 of the Voting\n\nRights Act by definition employs race.                 Miller, Shaw II, and Bush,\n\nhowever, do not foreclose the ability of States to act \"to remedy\n\nthe reality of racial inequality in our political system.\"                            Bush,\n\n1996 WL 315857, at *24 (O'Connor, J., concurring).                          The limit is\n\n\n                                           37\n\fthat the remedy must use race at the expense of traditional\n\npolitical concerns no more than is reasonably necessary to remedy\n\nthe found wrong.\n\n                                     IV.\n\n     Calhoun County's districting system dilutes minority voting\n\nstrength   in   violation   of   §    2    of   the   Voting   Rights   Act.\n\nAccordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district court, RENDER\n\njudgment for the plaintiffs on liability, and REMAND the case to\n\nthe district court to supervise the development of a remedial plan\n\nand to determine what amount, if any, the plaintiffs are entitled\n\nto recover in court costs and attorneys' fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                     38\n\f",

The county's districting plan divides the\n\ncounty into      five    districts,     each    of    which    elects   one   county\n\nsupervisor,      one    board    of   education      member,   and   one    election\n\ncommissioner.\n\n     Following the release of the 1990 census, the County Board of\n\nSupervisors hired Three Rivers Development and Planning District of\n\nPontotoc, Mississippi to develop a redistricting plan for the\n\ncounty.    The Board also appointed a biracial committee made up of\n\none black resident and one white resident from each election\n\ndistrict to supervise Three Rivers' work.                Three Rivers developed\n\ntwo redistricting plans, one of which the Board of Supervisors\n\ntentatively adopted. The biracial committee approved the plan, and\n\nthe Board     formally     adopted     the    plan    after    a   public   hearing.\n\nPursuant to § 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the Department of Justice\n\nsubsequently precleared the proposed redistricting plan.\n\n     According to the 1990 census, black residents comprise 23% of\n\nthe county's voting age population and 27% of its population\n\noverall.    Under the plan adopted by the Board of Supervisors, the\n\n\n                                          2\n\fblack    population      is    divided     roughly    equally     among     the    five\n\ndistricts, ranging from a low of 19% of the population in District\n\n3 to a high of 42% in District 4.\n\n       The plaintiffs sued the County, the Calhoun County Democratic\n\nExecutive    Committee,        the    Calhoun     County    Republican      Executive\n\nCommittee,    and    the      Calhoun    County    Election      Commission.        The\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the County's redistricting plan violated\n\n§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as well as the Fourteenth and\n\nFifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.                         The plaintiffs\n\nsought damages, declaratory, and injunctive relief, along with\n\nattorneys' fees.\n\n       After a bench trial, the district court granted judgment to\n\nthe County, concluding that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that\n\na geographically compact black majority district could be created.\n\nIn    addition,    the   court       concluded    that   under    the    totality    of\n\ncircumstances, the plaintiffs had failed to prove a § 2 violation.\n\nThe     district    court's      written       opinion     did   not     address    the\n\nplaintiff's constitutional claims, but the plaintiffs did not\n\nappeal the dismissal of those causes of action.

We further instructed\n\nthe   district   court    that    in   cases    where       the   three    Gingles\n\npreconditions    have    been    established,       it   \"'must     explain   with\n\nparticularity why it has concluded, under the particular facts of\n\nthat case, that an electoral system that routinely results in white\n\nvoters voting as a bloc to defeat the candidate of choice of a\n\npolitically cohesive minority group is not violative of § 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act.'\"       21 F.3d at 97 (quoting Jenkins, 4 F.3d at\n\n1135).   Despite these instructions, the district court readopted\n\nits earlier findings without elaboration and summarily concluded\n\nthat the existence of racially polarized voting in the county was\n\nnot sufficient to tip the balance in favor of the plaintiffs.                 This\n\ndiscussion is far from the particularized explanation that we\n\nexpected.    Normally,     we    would     remand    this    case    for   further\n\nconsideration.

We are persuaded that the district\n\ncourt's findings from its first opinion regarding the totality of\n\nthe circumstances, which the court readopted on remand, support the\n\nconclusion that Calhoun County's redistricting scheme violates § 2\n\nof the Voting Rights Act.        We do not suggest that the totality of\n\nthe circumstances is an empty formalism or that clearing the\n\nGingles hurdles preordains liability.          To the contrary, this final\n\ninquiry can be powerful indeed.          At the same time, it is more than\n\n\n                                       7\n\fan intuitive call of the trial judge; the trial court must anchor\n\nits judgment in evidence.\n\n                                       A.\n\n      In its first opinion, the district court found that racially\n\npolarized    voting    existed   in    Calhoun    County,   but   the     court\n\ndiscounted its importance due to the success of black candidates\n\nseeking election to several municipal and county offices.                     The\n\ncourt noted that black residents had been elected to the board of\n\naldermen in two predominately white municipalities in the county\n\nand that one black resident, who ran unopposed, had been elected\n\nelection commissioner in one of the predominately white districts.\n\n      On appeal, we concluded that the black electoral successes\n\ncited by the district court had \"limited relevance.\"              21 F.3d at\n\n96.   Citing Gingles, we explained that \"the election of some black\n\ncandidates does not negate a § 2 claim and does not establish that\n\npolarized voting does not exist,\" particularly when the election is\n\nunopposed.    Id.     We further explained that exogenous elections--\n\nthose not involving the particular office at issue--are less\n\nprobative than elections involving the specific office that is the\n\nsubject of the litigation.       Id.   at 97.    We instructed the district\n\ncourt on remand to \"accord greater weight to the virtual absence of\n\nblack electoral success in county-wide elections as opposed to\n\ntheir limited electoral success in municipal elections.\"                Id.\n\n      On remand, the district court reaffirmed its finding of\n\nracially polarized voting but construed our instruction as an\n\n\"invitation to find a section 2 violation simply because plaintiffs\n\n\n                                       8\n\fhave prevailed on the Gingles factors.\"           Correctly noting that the\n\nSupreme Court in Johnson had expressly rejected that reading of\n\n§ 2, the district court declined our \"invitation.\"\n\n     As we made clear prior to Johnson, the existence of the three\n\nGingles preconditions is necessary but not sufficient to prove a\n\n§ 2 violation.    See LULAC, 999 F.2d at 849.        However, the existence\n\nof racially polarized voting and the extent to which minorities are\n\nelected to public office remain the two most important factors\n\nconsidered in the totality-of-circumstances inquiry.

In addition to the\n\n\"uncontradicted\" statistical evidence from the original trial, Dr.\n\nRichard   Engstrom,    a   Professor       of   Political   Science    at   the\n\nUniversity of New Orleans, analyzed four, multiracial elections in\n\nCalhoun County.       Using both regression and homogenous precinct\n\nanalysis, Dr. Engstrom concluded that a \"consistent relationship\"\n\nexisted between a voter's race and his voting preference in the\n\nfour exogenous elections.       For example, in the 1991 Democratic\n\nprimary for Constable, the black candidate received an estimated\n\n71.6% of the black vote but only 7.8% of the white vote.              Although\n\nstatistical evidence is not conclusive, see Clark, 21 F.3d at 96,\n\nthe record here supports no other conclusion but that racially\n\npolarized voting exists in Calhoun County.              Indeed, the County\n\n\n                                       9\n\foffers no other explanation of the divergent voting patterns.                See\n\nUno v.

The County emphasizes that\n\nblack    residents    have    been   elected    as     aldermen   in     several\n\nmunicipalities and, in one case, as an election commissioner.                 We\n\npreviously   addressed       the   probative   value    of   these     electoral\n\nsuccesses and noted their \"limited relevance.\"                21 F.3d at 96.\n\nEven so, \"the election of a few minority candidates does not\n\nnecessarily foreclose the possibility of dilution of the black\n\nvote.\"     S.

Indeed, these isolated\n\nvictories, one of which occurred in a race with no opponent, do not\n\nmitigate the force of the district court's finding that \"[i]n this\n\ncentury, no black candidate has been elected in Calhoun County as\n\nsupervisor, justice court judge, constable, sheriff, circuit clerk,\n\nchancery clerk, tax assessor, superintendent of education, school\n\nboard member, coroner, county attorney, state senator, or state\n\nrepresentative.\"       Moreover, there is no suggestion that this\n\nstriking lack of electoral success is due to low voter turnout or\n\nblack support for non-minority candidates.

The district court found in its\n\nfirst opinion that \"since 1980 blacks have sought the positions of\n\njustice court judge, constable, sheriff, and school board member.\"\n\nMore importantly, however, this argument begs the ultimate question\n\nwhether blacks \"possess the same opportunities to participate in\n\nthe political process and elect representatives of their choice\n\nenjoyed by other voters.\"     That few or no black citizens have\n\nsought public office in the challenged electoral system does not\n\npreclude a claim of vote dilution.

The court found, however, that state\n\n\n                                 11\n\flaw requires that elections be conducted by majority vote.                            See\n\nMiss. Code Ann. § 23-15-305.                 Although the district court noted\n\nthat abolishing the majority vote requirement might increase the\n\npossibility of electoral success for black candidates, it concluded\n\nthat    the      majority      vote     requirement       was        not   \"inherently\n\ndiscriminatory.\"\n\n       We agree with the plaintiffs that the district court misjudged\n\nthe weight to be accorded this finding.                        First, even if the\n\nmajority vote        requirement       is    not   \"inherently        discriminatory,\"\n\nCongress has included it as one factor to consider as part of the\n\ntotality-of-circumstances inquiry. We are not free to second-guess\n\nCongress' judgment regarding its importance.                    See Westwego I, 872\n\nF.2d at 1212.\n\n       Second,      under    certain     circumstances,         the    majority      vote\n\nrequirement \"can operate to the detriment of minority voters\" and\n\nnegate their political strength.                  Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1113\n\nn.4.    Where more than two candidates run for a particular office,\n\nthe majority vote requirement ensures that no candidate supported\n\nby only a minority, racial or otherwise, of the populace will\n\nsucceed.       In   the     presence    of    racially    polarized        voting,    the\n\nmajority vote requirement permits a white majority that scattered\n\nits    votes   among      several     white       candidates    in     a   election   to\n\nconsolidate its support behind the remaining white candidate in the\n\nrun-off    election,         thereby        defeating    the     minority-supported\n\ncandidate.

The record here discloses that on at\n\nleast one occasion, the majority vote requirement operated to the\n\ndetriment of black voters in Calhoun County by preventing the\n\nnomination of a black citizen as the Democratic candidate for\n\nconstable in Calhoun County.         In the first primary, the black\n\ncandidate, Tommy Pittman, finished first among all candidates, the\n\nrest of whom were white.      Pittman did not receive a majority of the\n\nvotes cast, however.      In the run-off, Pittman lost.\n\n                                    C.\n\n     Two factors from the Senate Report focus on the effect of past\n\ndiscrimination on the plaintiffs' ability to participate in the\n\npolitical process: 1) the history of voting-related discrimination\n\nin the State or political subdivision, and 2) the extent to which\n\nminority group members bear the effects of past discrimination in\n\nareas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their\n\nability    to   participate   effectively   in   the   political     process.\n\nGingles, 478 U.S. at 44-45.          In its pre-remand opinion, the\n\ndistrict court found that \"in the past blacks were prevented from\n\nexercising their right to vote by intentionally discriminatory\n\nmechanisms.\"     Nevertheless, the court found this factor to be of\n\n\"limited    importance\"   because   \"past   history    cannot   be    forever\n\n\n                                    13\n\ffaulted for failures at the election box.\"              The district court\n\nexplained that at some point past discrimination must take on\n\n\"diminished importance.\"         In addition, the district court found\n\nthat \"the socio-economic status of blacks is significantly lower\n\nthan whites in Calhoun County\" but questioned without elaboration\n\nthe weight to be assigned to this finding.\n\n     The long and unhappy history of discrimination in Mississippi\n\nrequires no protracted discussion.         Calhoun County itself did not\n\ndesegregate its schools until 1969.           Nor need we tarry long in\n\nrecounting the socioeconomic disparity that continues to exist in\n\nCalhoun   County.       The   plaintiffs     produced   1990    census   data\n\ndisclosing, among other facts, that the per capita income of black\n\nresidents in Calhoun County is less than half that of white\n\nresidents.\n\n     The County concedes, as it must, that Calhoun County has a\n\nhistory of racial discrimination and that socioeconomic differences\n\nbetween   white   and   blacks    continue    to   exist   in   the   County.\n\nNevertheless, the County argues that the plaintiffs have not\n\nestablished a causal nexus between such past discrimination or\n\nsocioeconomic disparities, on the one hand, and any decreased level\n\nof black political participation, on the other.\n\n     In LULAC, we explained that while Congress has not insisted\n\nupon proof of a causal nexus between socioeconomic status and\n\ndepressed political participation, Congress \"did not dispense with\n\nproof that participation in the political process is in fact\n\ndepressed among minority citizens.\"          999 F.2d at 867; see S. Rep.\n\n\n                                     14\n\f417 at 29 n.114, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207 n.114.\n\nIndeed,      in   that   case,   we     held   that    proof   of   socioeconomic\n\ndisparities and a history of discrimination \"without more\" did not\n\nsuffice to establish the two Senate Report factors.                    999 F.2d at\n\n867.\n\n       The   district    court    did    not    make   any   finding    that    black\n\npolitical participation was depressed in Calhoun County.                       Nor do\n\nthe plaintiffs on appeal point to any evidence in the record\n\nshowing that black political participation compares unfavorably to\n\nthat of white residents in the county.                  The plaintiffs' expert\n\nwitness, Cheri McKinless, did testify at the first trial that\n\nindividuals of lower socioeconomic status were not as likely to\n\nvote as individuals of higher socioeconomic status.                    However, she\n\nbased her conclusion on political science literature, not \"an\n\n'intensely local appraisal' of the social and political climate\" of\n\nCalhoun County.          Id.     Indeed, in LULAC, we rejected similar\n\n\"armchair speculation\" as insufficient to establish that \"minority\n\nvoters in this case failed to participate equally in the political\n\nprocesses.\"        Id.\n\n       In short, we are not persuaded that the district court erred\n\nin     disregarding      the     history       of   past     discrimination       and\n\nsocioeconomic disparity in Calhoun County.\n\n                                          D.\n\n       In its pre-remand opinion, the district court found that\n\nCalhoun County officials were responsive to concerns of its black\n\nresidents.        The court explained:\n\n\n                                          15\n\f     First, it is unrefuted that the County has recently paved\n     and/or    repaved    roads   in    predominately    black\n     neighborhoods. . . . Second, it has been stipulated that\n     blacks hold appointive positions on approximately one-\n     third of the County Boards and Commissions.          This\n     represents, in this court's mind, a concern that blacks\n     be afforded a voice in matters affecting the citizenry.\n     Finally, the County, in appointing the biracial committee\n     and holding public hearings on the proposed redistricting\n     plan, made a concerted effort to comply with the mandates\n     of the Voting Rights Act. From the beginning, Calhoun\n     County recognized the need for redistricting and\n     attempted to procure Section 2 compliance via an open,\n     public forum.     The black members appointed to the\n     biracial committee were, according to the testimony, well\n     respected and influential citizens in the black\n     community; some, like Ms. Rose, were college educated.\n     These are not the actions of a county which is oblivious\n     to the needs and concerns of the black community or\n     disrespectful of the mandates of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n     With one caveat, we find no merit to the suggestion that the\n\ndistrict court's finding of responsiveness is clearly erroneous.\n\nOther governmental entities have done more than Calhoun County to\n\ndemonstrate their responsiveness to minority concerns.   See, e.g.,\n\nCity of Niagara Falls, 65 F.3d at 1023 (noting that the city, inter\n\nalia, established an affirmative action task force, adopted a fair\n\nhousing law, and established a minority business loan fund).\n\nNevertheless, the County's road-paving and its use of a biracial\n\ncommission to approve the current redistricting plan support the\n\nfinding that the County is responsive to the needs of the black\n\ncommunity.   The formation of the biracial commission in particular\n\ndemonstrates the County's sensitivity to the concerns of its black\n\ncitizens.    Although the record discloses that Three Rivers did not\n\ninform the commission that it was possible to create a majority-\n\nminority district, that fact alone does not undermine the district\n\ncourt's finding.    Indeed, there is no suggestion that the anyone\n\n                                  16\n\fdeliberately misled that commission or that the commission served\n\nonly to rubberstamp redistricting plans already approved by the\n\nboard of supervisors.\n\n       We part company with the district court, however, regarding\n\nits reliance on black membership on county commissions. The number\n\nof minority members on county commissions is a poor barometer of\n\nthe county's responsiveness to the needs of its black citizenry.\n\nJudging responsiveness by counting members of county commissions is\n\nakin to judging the emptiness of a glass of water half full:\n\nwhether it is half full or half empty depends on who you ask.             Even\n\nso, we agree with the plaintiffs that the district court erred in\n\nthis case by focusing on how many minority board members there\n\nwere, instead of how few.       That four of the fourteen county boards\n\nor commissions have black members overlooks that ten do not.\n\nMoreover, the record discloses that of the four boards that do have\n\nminority representation, three have only one black member and the\n\nother has only two black members.           Of the 72 appointed officials,\n\nonly    five   are   black,   less   than   7%   of   the   total   membership.\n\nSimilarly, the district court found that only 6 of the county's 75\n\nemployees were black.\n\n       Although the district court's finding of responsiveness was\n\nnot clearly erroneous, we are persuaded that the district court\n\nattached too much weight to its finding.              First, the finding of\n\nresponsiveness has \"limited relevance.\"           Westwego III, 946 F.2d at\n\n1122.    The Senate Report explained:\n\n       Unresponsiveness is not an essential part of plaintiff's\n       case.      Therefore,   defendants'    proof   of   some\n\n                                       17\n\f     responsiveness would not negate plaintiff's showing by\n     other, more objective factors enumerated here that\n     minority voters nevertheless were shut out of equal\n     access to the political process.\n\nS. Rep. 417 at 29 n.116, reprinted in 1982 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 207\n\nn.116; see also Westwego I, 872 F.2d at 1213 n.15.                 Indeed, in\n\nWestwego III, we rendered judgment for the plaintiffs, even though\n\nwe agreed with the district court that the plaintiffs had failed to\n\nprove a lack of responsiveness by city officials.                 946 F.2d at\n\n1123; see also Harvell, 71 F.3d at 1391 (noting that \"[e]ven\n\naccepting the finding of responsiveness as not clearly erroneous,\n\nhowever, it is similarly insufficient to counter the other factors\n\nthat censure this scheme\").\n\n     Second, the district court's finding of responsiveness cannot\n\nbe weighed in the abstract.      Responsiveness, like many things, is\n\na question of both kind and degree.              While two cities may both be\n\nsaid to be responsive to minority needs, the two may vary greatly\n\nin approach and commitment.      The totality-of-circumstances inquiry\n\nis not blind to those differences.            Although we acknowledge that\n\ndiscerning   those      differences        demands    difficult   qualitative\n\njudgments,   see   S.

The County defends\n\nthe district court's finding and argues that its interest in\n\nmaintaining districts with equal road mileage should be given\n\nsubstantial weight.     See LULAC, 999 F.2d at 871.\n\n       We find no merit to the suggestion that the County must prove\n\nthat the challenged electoral system is necessary to achieve its\n\ninterest in equalizing road mileage among districts.

Nor likely could it.            The County points to no\n\ndecision holding that its interest in equal road mileage among\n\nelection districts is substantial.           The administrative convenience\n\nof such a system is evident, but the County's asserted interest\n\npales in comparison to that upheld in LULAC.             Id. at 872 (noting\n\nTexas' interest is a \"key component\" of what defines or \"what\n\nconstitutes a state court judge\").

In this case, we are persuaded that,\n\nunder the totality of the circumstances, the plaintiffs have\n\ndemonstrated a § 2 violation.       Neither the County's responsiveness\n\nto its black citizenry nor its interest in equalizing road mileage\n\n\n                                        20\n\famong districts mitigates the striking lack of black electoral\n\nsuccess in county elections and the \"uncontradicted\" existence of\n\nracially polarized voting.          In short, this is not that \"unusual\n\ncase\" in which the three Gingles preconditions are satisfied but\n\nthe totality of circumstances fail to show a § 2 violation.               See,\n\ne.g., City of Niagara Falls, 65 F.3d at 1020 (concluding that,\n\nunder totality of circumstances, no § 2 violation existed where\n\n\"many\"    of   the    Senate      Report    factors   pointed   against   the\n\nplaintiffs).

Its implications travel far beyond Calhoun County and\n\nthreaten the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act itself. In\n\n\n                                       21\n\flight of this, it is not surprising that we have been chary of\n\nreaching the issue of Miller's applicability to vote dilution\n\nclaims brought pursuant to § 2 of the Voting Rights Act.                   See,\n\ne.g., Alonzo, 68 F.3d at 947 n.2 (reserving the question).                We are\n\nloathe to revisit that Act's validity, and upon closer examination,\n\nwe   are   not    persuaded    that   Miller   and   its   progeny   prohibit\n\nredistricting plans drawn to remedy violations of § 2 of the Voting\n\nRights Act.       We begin with Miller.\n\n                                       A.\n\n      In Miller, the Supreme Court confronted the constitutionality\n\nof   Georgia's      Eleventh   Congressional    District,     one    of   three\n\nmajority-minority districts in the State. Drawn in response to the\n\nJustice Department's refusal to preclear earlier reapportionment\n\nplans pursuant to § 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the Eleventh\n\nDistrict mimicked Sherman's March-to-the-Sea, traversing the 260\n\nmiles from Atlanta to Savannah. A three-judge district court panel\n\nfound that race was the dominant purpose in creating the Eleventh\n\nDistrict.    On appeal to the Supreme Court, the appellants did not\n\ncontest the district court's finding but rather claimed that the\n\nlegislature's motivation by itself did not suffice to state a claim\n\nunder Shaw v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2816</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993).           Rather, the appellants\n\nargued that the district court must find that the district's shape\n\nwas so bizarre on its face as to be unexplainable on grounds other\n\nthan race.       The Supreme Court disagreed.\n\n      Noting that the Equal Protection Clause subjects facially-\n\nneutral statutes motivated by racial considerations to strict\n\n\n                                       22\n\fscrutiny, the Court rejected the view that bizarre shape was a\n\nprerequisite to an equal protection claim:\n\n      Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary\n      element of the constitutional wrong or a threshold\n      requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive\n      circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and\n      not other districting principles, was the legislature's\n      dominant and controlling rationale in drawing its\n      district lines.\n\n115 S.Ct. at 2486.           The Court made clear that plaintiffs who\n\nchallenge     the    constitutionality      of    reapportionment      plans    \"are\n\nneither     confined    in   their   proof       to    evidence     regarding   the\n\ndistrict's geometry and makeup nor required to make a threshold\n\nshowing of bizarreness.\"        Id. at 2488.\n\n      The    Court     encountered    greater         difficulty,    however,    in\n\naffirmatively defining the plaintiff's burden of proof.                  The Court\n\nacknowledged that legislatures will \"almost always be aware of\n\nracial demographics; but it does not follow that race predominates\n\nin   the    redistricting     process.\"      Id.        Distinguishing     between\n\npermissible     awareness      and   impermissible         motivation    \"may    be\n\ndifficult\" and will require courts \"to exercise extraordinary\n\ncaution in adjudicating claims that a state has drawn district\n\nlines on the basis of race.\"                Id.        Nevertheless, the Court\n\nattempted a definition:\n\n      The plaintiff's burden is to show, either through\n      circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and\n      demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative\n      purpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating\n      the legislature's decision to place a significant number\n      of voters within or without a particular district. To\n      make this showing, a plaintiff must prove that the\n      legislature   subordinated    traditional    race-neutral\n      districting principles, including but not limited to\n      compactness,    contiguity,    respect   for    political\n\n                                       23\n\f        subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared\n        interests, to racial considerations.\n\nId.     Justice O'Connor added in her concurring opinion that this\n\nstandard was \"a demanding one,\" requiring the plaintiff to show\n\nthat the legislature \"has relied on race in substantial disregard\n\nof customary and traditional districting practices.\"                      Id. at 2497\n\n(O'Connor, J., concurring).           In those cases where the plaintiff\n\nsuccessfully proves that race was the \"predominant, overriding\"\n\nconsideration motivating the drawing of district lines, the burden\n\nshifts to the defendant to demonstrate that its districting plan is\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest.\n\nId. at 2490.\n\n        Agreeing with the district court that race was the predominant\n\nfactor       motivating   the   drawing     of       the   Eleventh     Congressional\n\nDistrict, the Court turned to the requirements of strict scrutiny.\n\nGeorgia argued that compliance with the preclearance requirement of\n\n§   5   of    the   Voting   Rights   Act      was    a    compelling    governmental\n\ninterest.       The Court did not reach the validity of that position:\n\n        Whether or not in some cases compliance with the Voting\n        Rights Act, standing alone, can provide a compelling\n        interest independent of any interest in remedying past\n        discrimination, it cannot do so here. As we suggested in\n        Shaw, compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws\n        cannot   justify   race-based   districting  where   the\n        challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a\n        constitutional reading and application of those laws.\n\nId. at 2490-91.\n\n        The   Court   concluded    that     the      Eleventh    District    was   not\n\nrequired by the Voting Rights Act \"under a correct reading of the\n\nstatute.\"      Id. at 2491.     That Georgia drew the Eleventh District in\n\n\n                                          24\n\forder to obtain preclearance under § 5 of the Voting Rights Act did\n\nnot mean that the plan was required by the Act.                Id.   To the\n\ncontrary, the Eleventh District was not required under the Act\n\n\"because there was no reasonable basis to believe that Georgia's\n\nearlier enacted plans violated § 5.\"         Id. at 2492.   Noting that the\n\nearlier    plans   had   increased   the    number   of   majority-minority\n\ndistricts from the previous apportionment, the Court explained that\n\nsuch ameliorative plans did not violate § 5 \"unless the new\n\napportionment itself so discriminates on the basis of race or color\n\nas to violate the Constitution.\"          Id.\n\n     The Court added that the Justice Department's interpretation\n\nof § 5 as authorizing it to preclear only those reapportionment\n\nplans     that   maximized   majority-minority       districts    portended\n\nconstitutional difficulties for § 5 and brought the Voting Rights\n\nAct \"into tension with the Fourteenth Amendment.\"             Id. at 2493.\n\nThe Court eschewed reaching the constitutional question, however,\n\nnoting only that there was no indication that Congress intended § 5\n\nof the Voting Rights Act to reach as far as the Justice Department\n\nhad pushed it.     Id.\n\n     Miller left open several critical questions.                The Court\n\nassumed but did not decide that compliance with the Voting Rights\n\nAct constituted a compelling governmental interest.              Moreover,\n\nMiller did not address in what instances a State may draw majority-\n\nminority districts to remedy potential or adjudicated violations of\n\n§ 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\n\n\n                                     25\n\f     Second,    while   Miller   left    these   issues   unresolved,   its\n\ncondemnation of race-based districting decisions was loud and\n\nclear.    The Court described the evils of race-based redistricting,\n\ndeclaring    that   \"'[r]acial   gerrymandering,     even   for    remedial\n\npurposes, may balkanize us into competing racial factions; it\n\nthreatens to carry us further from the goal of a political system\n\nin which race no longer matters--a goal that the Fourteenth and\n\nFifteenth Amendments embody, and to which the Nation continues to\n\naspire.'\"    Id. at 2486 (quoting Shaw, 113 S.Ct. at 2832) (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n     The Court's recent decisions in Bush v. Vera, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">315857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(1996), and Shaw v.

In Bush, the Court\n\nstruck down three majority-minority Congressional districts in\n\nTexas as violative of the Equal Protection Clause.                The three\n\ndistricts were the product of the Texas legislature's effort to\n\nincrease the number of majority-minority districts in the State.\n\nNo opinion commanded a majority. Justice O'Connor, writing for two\n\nother Justices, began her analysis by noting that strict scrutiny\n\ndoes not apply to all cases involving the intentional creation of\n\nmajority-minority districts.       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">315857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.           Rather,\n\nJustice O'Connor reaffirmed Miller's predominant factor test and\n\n\n\n\n                                    26\n\ffound that the three challenged districts all failed that test,\n\nthereby triggering strict scrutiny.2\n\n     To justify its race-based redistricting, Texas pointed to\n\nthree interests:    the interest in avoiding liability under § 2 of\n\nthe Voting Rights Act, the interest in remedying past and present\n\ndiscrimination, and the interest in complying with § 5 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act.       It is the Court's treatment of the first\n\ninterest that concerns us the most in this case.\n\n     In her opinion for the plurality, Justice O'Connor assumed\n\nwithout deciding that compliance with § 2 of the Voting Rights Act\n\nconstituted a compelling governmental interest.                   Id. at *15.\n\nAlthough strict scrutiny is a demanding standard, Justice O'Connor\n\nexplained that the narrow tailoring prong of the test permitted the\n\nStates   \"a   limited   degree   of   leeway\"      in   drawing   a   remedial,\n\nmajority-minority district.      Id.       To demonstrate that a majority-\n\nminority district is reasonably necessary to comply with § 2, the\n\nState must have a \"strong basis in evidence\" for finding that the\n\nthree Gingles preconditions exist.           Id.\n\n\n\n     2\n          Justices Thomas and Scalia, who did not join Justice\nO'Connor's opinion for the plurality but provided a majority by\nconcurring in the judgment, disagreed with the plurality on this\npoint and concluded that the intentional creation of a majority-\nminority district was sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. Id.\nat *27. On this point, at least six Justices sided with Justice\nO'Connor's view of the law.     Compare id. at *5 (O'Connor, J.,\njoined by Rehnquist, C.J., and Kennedy, J.); id. at *31 & n.7\n(Stevens, J., joined by Ginsburg and Breyer, J.J., dissenting); id.\nat *56 (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg and Breyer, J.J.,\ndissenting) with id. at *25 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (reserving\nthe question) and id. at *27 (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J.,\nconcurring in the judgment).\n\n                                      27\n\f       Although Justice O'Connor was willing to assume the existence\n\nof the last two Gingles preconditions in the instant case, she\n\nconcluded that the challenged districts' bizarre shape and lack of\n\ncompactness \"defeat[ed] any claim that the districts are narrowly\n\ntailored to serve the State's interest in avoiding liability under\n\n§ 2.\"    Id. at *16.    Although \"[a] § 2 district that is reasonably\n\ncompact and regular, taking into account traditional districting\n\nprinciples    such     as    maintaining   communities   of   interest    and\n\ntraditional boundaries, may pass strict scrutiny without having to\n\ndefeat rival compact districts designed by plaintiffs' experts in\n\nendless 'beauty contests,'\" id. at *15, a non-compact majority-\n\nminority district is not required by § 2 and, therefore, fails the\n\nnarrowly tailored prong of strict scrutiny.          Id. at *16.   Justices\n\nThomas and Scalia, concurring in the judgment, agreed without\n\nelaboration that the districts were not narrowly tailored.           Id. at\n\n*29.\n\n       Of particular significance, both Justice O'Connor and Justice\n\nKennedy   filed   concurring      opinions   that   further   addressed   the\n\nrelationship between the Equal Protection Clause and § 2 of the\n\nVoting Rights Act.          Although Justice O'Connor's opinion for the\n\nplurality only assumed that compliance with the Voting Rights Act\n\nwas a compelling governmental interest, Justice O'Connor expressly\n\nadopted that position in her separate concurring opinion.           See id.\n\nat *21.    On this point, at least four other Justices agreed with\n\nJustice O'Connor.      See id. at *41 (Stevens, J., joined by Ginsburg\n\nand Breyer, J.J., dissenting); id. at *46, *56 (Souter, J., joined\n\n\n                                      28\n\fby Ginsburg and Breyer, J.J., dissenting).              Moreover, Justice\n\nO'Connor opined that \"if a State pursues that compelling interest\n\nby creating a district that 'substantially addresses' the potential\n\nliability, and does not deviate substantially from a hypothetical\n\ncourt-drawn § 2 district for predominantly racial reasons, its\n\ndistricting plan will be deemed narrowly tailored.\"            Id. at *23.\n\n      Justice Kennedy agreed that the three challenged districts\n\nwere not narrowly tailored to serve the asserted interest in\n\ncomplying with § 2 of the Voting Rights Act, but his approach\n\ndiffered slightly from the plurality's.           Id. at *25.       Justice\n\nKennedy noted that the first Gingles precondition focuses not on\n\nthe   compactness   of   the    contested    district    but   rather    the\n\ncompactness of the minority population.         Id.     As a consequence,\n\nJustice Kennedy was willing to assume that Texas had a strong basis\n\nin evidence for concluding that all three Gingles preconditions\n\nexisted.   Indeed, only if all three Gingles preconditions were met\n\nwould a court reach the question whether the challenged district\n\nwas narrowly tailored to remedying the potential § 2 violation.\n\n      Nevertheless, the challenged districts' lack of compactness,\n\nwhich persuaded Justice O'Connor that the first Gingles factor was\n\nnot met, persuaded Justice Kennedy that the districts did not\n\nsubstantially address the potential § 2 violation. Emphasizing the\n\nplurality's    statement       that    the   remedial    district       \"must\n\n'substantially address the § 2 violation'\" to satisfy the narrow\n\ntailoring prong of strict scrutiny, Justice Kennedy attempted to\n\ngive content to that phrase by noting that a State \"may not engage\n\n\n                                      29\n\fin districting based on race except as reasonably necessary to cure\n\nthe anticipated § 2 violation, nor may it use race as a proxy to\n\nserve other interests.\"    Id. at *26 (emphasis added).         In Justice\n\nKennedy's eyes, the inclusion of some minority communities that\n\n\"could not possibly form part of a compact majority-minority\n\ndistrict\" belied the claim that Texas drew the district to remedy\n\na potential § 2 violation.         Id.     Justice Kennedy cautioned,\n\nhowever, that the Court's focus on compactness did not mean that\n\nall majority-minority districts had to be compact to satisfy\n\nconstitutional scrutiny.      To the contrary, \"[d]istricts not drawn\n\nfor impermissible reasons or according to impermissible criteria\n\nmay take any shape, even a bizarre one.\"          Id. at *27.\n\n     Shaw II, which was decided the same day as Bush, invalidated\n\nNorth Carolina's Twelfth Congressional District, a \"serpentine\"\n\ndistrict 160 miles in length and often no wider than the interstate\n\nthat it followed in its \"snake-like\" trek through the heart of the\n\nState.   </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">315870</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3, *4.      Applying Miller's predominant\n\npurpose test, the Court found that race was the predominant factor\n\nin drawing the challenged district.        Id. at *4.     As in Bush, the\n\nCourt assumed that compliance with the Voting Rights Act was a\n\ncompelling governmental interest, see id. at *6 n.4, *9, but it\n\nconcluded that District 12 was not narrowly tailored to that end.\n\nId. at   *10.   The   Court    explained   that    the   majority-minority\n\ndistrict \"must, at a minimum, remedy the anticipated violation [of\n\n§ 2] or achieve compliance to be narrowly tailored.\"            Id. at *9.\n\nNoting that the first Gingles precondition requires the existence\n\n\n                                   30\n\fof a geographically compact minority group, Chief Justice Rehnquist\n\ndeclared that \"[n]o one looking at District 12 could reasonably\n\nsuggest that the district contains a 'geographically compact'\n\npopulation of any race.\"             Id. at *10.\n\n      Taken   together,         these       decisions     establish       a    number    of\n\nimportant propositions. First, race-based redistricting, even that\n\ndone for remedial purposes, is subject to strict scrutiny. Second,\n\ncompliance    with   §     2    of    the     Voting    Rights   Act      constitutes     a\n\ncompelling governmental interest.                  Third, the State must have a\n\nstrong basis in evidence for concluding that the three Gingles\n\npreconditions exist in order to claim that its redistricting plan\n\nis reasonably necessary to comply with § 2.                      Fourth, a tailored\n\nresponse to a found violation must use race at the expense of\n\ntraditional political concerns no more than is reasonably necessary\n\nto remedy the wrong.           With these propositions in mind, we turn to\n\nthe County's arguments in this case.\n\n                                              B.\n\n      The County frames its Miller argument in two ways.                        First, it\n\nclaims that Miller limits the scope of the first Gingles factor,\n\nwhich    requires    proof      that    a     geographically     compact        majority-\n\nminority district can be created.                  According to the County, the\n\nplaintiffs'    proposed         redistricting          plans   violate        Miller    and,\n\ntherefore,    are    not       \"a    proper    foundation      for    a   holding      that\n\nPlaintiffs-Appellants have satisfied the first Gingles precondition\n\nof   a   sufficiently      numerous,          geographically         compact     minority\n\n\n\n\n                                              31\n\fpopulation.\"       To fully understand the County's argument, we must\n\nreturn to our first decision in this case.\n\n      In the first appeal, the County claimed that the Supreme\n\nCourt's then-recent decision in Shaw supported the district court's\n\nfinding that the plaintiffs had not established the first Gingles\n\nfactor.      According      to   the    County,      a   districting     scheme   that\n\nviolated Shaw's requirement of compactness per se failed to satisfy\n\nthe first Gingles precondition.                   We acknowledged Shaw's holding\n\nthat a voting scheme \"so extremely irregular on its face that it\n\nrationally can be viewed only as an effort to segregate the races\n\nfor purposes of voting\" stated a claim under the Equal Protection\n\nClause.     However, we noted that the proposed district in this case\n\nwas \"not nearly as bizarre as the district under consideration in\n\nShaw.\" 21 F.3d at 95.               We consequently refused to determine\n\n\"whether a bizarrely-shaped district which would enable plaintiffs\n\nto   state    a    claim    under      the    Equal      Protection    Clause     would\n\nnecessarily flunk the Gingles compactness test.\"                      Id. at 95-96.\n\n      The    County's      Miller   contention        builds   upon     this   earlier\n\nargument.         According to the County, Miller clarifies Shaw by\n\nexplaining that the gravamen of an Equal Protection claim is not\n\nthe shape of the district but rather the legislature's motivation\n\nor purpose in drawing the district as it did.                           The argument\n\ncontinues that the plaintiffs' predominant concern with race in\n\ndrawing their proposed district places it squarely within Miller\n\nand therefore outside the first Gingles factor.                       Stated another\n\n\n\n\n                                             32\n\fway, a proposed district that violates Miller does not satisfy the\n\nfirst Gingles factor per se.\n\n       We agree with the County's reading of Miller but disagree that\n\nMiller is relevant to the first Gingles factor.                   In contrast to\n\nShaw's focus on compactness, Miller explained that compactness was\n\nnot the gravamen of Equal Protection challenges to reapportionment\n\nplans.       To the contrary, compactness was merely one among many\n\nfactors whose presence bore on the ultimate question whether race\n\nwas the predominant factor motivating the drawing of particular\n\ndistrict lines.\n\n       In contrast to Miller's focus on motivation, the first Gingles\n\nfactor requires that the plaintiff demonstrate that the minority\n\ngroup    is    \"sufficiently     large    and     geographically     compact   to\n\nconstitute a majority in a single-member district.\"                 Gingles, 478\n\nU.S.    at    50.    Plaintiffs    typically       attempt   to    satisfy   this\n\nrequirement by drawing hypothetical majority-minority districts.\n\nWhen    combined    with   the   second       Gingles   factor   requiring   that\n\nminority voters demonstrate their political cohesiveness, the first\n\nGingles factor ensures that the minority has the potential to elect\n\na representative of its own choice in some single-member district.\n\nSee Growe, 113 S.Ct. at 1084; Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50 & n.17.\n\nAbsent a satisfactory showing on the first Gingles factor, minority\n\nvoters cannot claim that it is the current districting system and\n\nnot, for example, geographic dispersal that is the source of their\n\ndisproportionately weak political strength.               Gingles, 478 U.S. at\n\n50 n.17.\n\n\n                                         33\n\f     Bush and Shaw II support our conclusion that Miller's emphasis\n\non purpose does not apply to the first Gingles precondition.                      In\n\nneither case did the Court suggest that a district drawn for\n\npredominantly racial reasons would necessarily fail the Gingles\n\ntest. To the contrary, the first Gingles factor is an inquiry into\n\ncausation that necessarily classifies voters by their race.\n\n     In short, we do not understand Miller and its progeny to work\n\na change in the first Gingles inquiry into whether a sufficiently\n\nlarge and compact district can be drawn in which the powerful\n\nminority would constitute a majority. See Harvell, 71 F.3d at 1391\n\n(noting that Miller \"did not purport to alter our inquiry into the\n\nvote-dilution claim\").     To be sure, this test of causation insists\n\nupon a compact district, and a remedial response narrowly tailored\n\nto remedying a found violation must also be compact.                 As we will\n\nexplain, however, that tailored response must use race at the\n\nexpense    of   traditional    political         concerns   no   more    than     is\n\nreasonably necessary to remedy the found wrong.\n\n                                       C.\n\n     Alternatively, the County argues that we should affirm the\n\njudgment    below    because   there        is   no   constitutional      remedy.\n\nAccording to the County, the plaintiffs' proposed redistricting\n\nplans violate Miller.      The County argues that, consequently, it\n\nwould be subject to lawsuits under Miller if it were to implement\n\none of the plaintiffs' proposed redistricting plans.                The argument\n\nis that the County did not violate § 2 because the plaintiffs'\n\nproposed    remedy    violates    the        Equal     Protection       Clause.\n\n\n                                       34\n\f      To the extent that the County challenges the remedy, it is not\n\nripe for our review.       Plaintiffs’ majority-minority districts were\n\nidentified in answer to the first Gingles inquiry into causation.\n\nSee   Clark,   21   F.3d   at   95   (noting   that   plaintiffs'   proposed\n\ndistricts were \"simply presented to demonstrate that a majority-\n\nblack district is feasible in Calhoun County\").           Calhoun County's\n\nBoard of Supervisors has primary jurisdiction over its electoral\n\nsystem.   \"It must be left to that body to develop, in the first\n\ninstance, a plan which will remedy the dilution of the votes of the\n\ncity's black citizens.\"         Westwego III, 946 F.2d at 1124; see also\n\nClark, 21 F.3d at 95 (noting that \"the county will be given the\n\nfirst opportunity to develop a remedial plan\"). That body is free,\n\nwithin limits,3 to develop a different remedial plan from those\n\nproposed by the plaintiffs.\n\n      This is not to say that Bush does not insist that districting\n\nplans drawn to remedy potential violations of the Voting Rights Act\n\nescape scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">315857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\nat *15-16.
