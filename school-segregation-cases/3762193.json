Plaintiff was employed as a Correctional Officer with Defendant North Carolina Department of Corrections at the Brown Creek facility. Plaintiff is a high school graduate and was born on February 9, 1953.</p>\n<p>2. Plaintiff was working for Defendant as a Correctional Officer on August 10, 2005. While walking to muster that day, Plaintiff stepped into an eroded area of the yard, whereupon he twisted and felt a sharp pain in his left lower back going down his leg. Prior to August 10, 2005, Plaintiff had not experienced significant back pain or medical treatment for his back.</p>\n<p>3. Plaintiff immediately reported this incident to his lieutenant and his captain, and Plaintiff was thereupon placed in segregation duty so as to minimize his contact with inmates.</p>\n<p>4. Upon Defendant's direction, Plaintiff was seen August 12, 2005 by Dr. Howard Johnson at Richmond Family Medicine. The August 12, 2005 medical note reflects that Dr. Johnson restricted Plaintiff to light duty work for ten days, with restrictions of \"no lifting over five pounds, no pushing, no pulling, and no repetitive [stooping] or bending.\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 5</span> </p>\n<p>5. On August 15, 2005, while working for Defendant in segregation on light-duty as a result of the 10 August 2005 workplace incident, Plaintiff fell out of a rolling chair. This fall caused Plaintiff to land on the floor on his side. Plaintiff suffered pain radiating down his left leg as a result of this fall.</p>\n<p>6. As a result of the August 15, 2005 incident, Plaintiff was sent by Defendant to the Richmond Memorial Hospital Emergency Department.</p>\n<p>7. Plaintiff continued to receive treatment for his back condition from Richmond Family Medicine at the direction and expense of Defendant. On October 21, 2005, Richmond Family Medicine attempted to refer Plaintiff to an orthopaedist.</p>\n<p>8. On November 3, 2005, Plaintiff began receiving treatment from Pinehurst Surgical Clinic. However, Plaintiff apparently only received treatment from P.A. Kevin Slater at Pinehurst Surgical Clinic.</p>\n<p>9. On November 21, 2005, P.A. Slater released Plaintiff from the care of Pinehurst Surgical Clinic in order for Plaintiff to undergo total knee replacement surgery. Plaintiff's knee condition and the replacement surgery are unrelated to any workplace injury. The medical note from November 21, 2005 anticipated Plaintiff returning to Pinehurst Surgical for back treatment after Plaintiff's total knee replacement was completed. At this time Plaintiff remained under work restrictions due to his back condition.</p>\n<p>10. By letter dated August 9, 2006, Plaintiff's employment with Defendant was terminated due to Plaintiff's physical inability to undergo Officer Refresher Training. This training required Plaintiff to be able to compete in hand-to-hand combat drills. Plaintiff's physical inability to complete this training was a result of his knee condition subsequent to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 6</span> \ntotal knee replacement surgery. The last day Plaintiff actually worked for Defendant was May 23, 2006.</p>\n<p>11. As of the date of the hearing before the Deputy Commissioner, Plaintiff was working 40 hours per week as a Security Officer for Charlotte Aircraft.</p>\n<p>12. Plaintiff asked for, and received, permission from Defendant to receive treatment for his back condition subsequent to his last day worked for Defendant. Plaintiff thereafter resumed care under P.A. Slater at Pinehurst Surgical Clinic on August 25, 2006. The time gap in treatment for Plaintiff's back condition resulted from Plaintiff's unrelated knee replacement surgery.</p>\n<p>13. In August, 2006, Plaintiff suffered spasms and pain in his back subsequent to yard work and other activities. This pain was a flare-up of his condition that resulted from the August 10 and/or 15, 2005 workplace falls rather than from a new injury or condition.</p>\n<p>14. On November 30, 2006 Plaintiff underwent an MRI to his lumbar spine. The MRI report found, among other things, an L4-5 \"broad based disc bulge, spondylotic spurring and degenerative facet arthropathy resulting in a mild degree of central and bilateral neural for aminal canal stenosis.\"</p>\n<p>15. Plaintiff underwent a Functional Capacity Evaluation on May 22, 2007. Defendant paid for this assessment.</p>\n<p>16. Given the medical evidence and testimony in this matter, Plaintiff has not reached the end of the healing period and is not at maximum medical improvement with regard to the back condition sustained as a result of the August 10 and/or 15, 2005 workplace incidents.</p>\n<p>17. The back pain and spasms Plaintiff experienced subsequent to yard work and other activities in August 2006 were naturally-flowing consequences of his back condition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 7</span> \nconsequent of the August 2005 workplace falls, and were not the result of an independent intervening cause attributable to claimant's own intentional conduct.</p>\n<p>18. P.A. Kevin Slater testified by deposition that the findings evident on Plaintiff's November 30, 2006 MRI resulted from Plaintiff's August 10, 2005 workplace fall. P.A. Slater further testified that the medical treatment Plaintiff received in and subsequent to August 2006 was for treatment of the back condition consequent of Plaintiff's workplace fall of August 10, 2005.</p>\n<p>19. Dr. Rice testified by deposition that Plaintiff suffers some permanent partial disability as a result of the back condition resulting from the workplace falls. Dr. Rice further testified that Plaintiff would benefit from additional medical treatment for this back condition.</p>\n<p>20. On August 10 and 15, 2005, Plaintiff fell and suffered compensable injuries to his back that arose out of and in the course of his employment with Defendant. The falls constituted interruptions of Plaintiff's normal work routine and the introduction thereby of conditions likely to result in unexpected consequences.</p>\n<p>21. The credible medical evidence of record shows that as a result of the August 10 and/or 15, 2005 falls, Plaintiff currently suffers from a back condition that requires medical treatment.</p>\n<p>22. Given the facts of this case, Dr. James E. Rice is the best physician to assume Plaintiff's care at this time. Dr. Rice's care is reasonably calculated to provide relief from Plaintiff's compensable conditions.</p>\n<p>23. Plaintiff's employment with Defendant was terminated for reasons unrelated to his workers' compensation injury. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 8</span> </p>\n<p>24. Neither party pursued any issue in this matter in an unreasonable manner or without reasonable ground.</p>\n<p><center>                               ***********</center>\nBased on the foregoing findings of fact, the Full Commission makes the following:</p>\n<p><center>                           <u>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</u></center>\n1. In order to establish a compensable back injury, a Plaintiff must prove that the disabling back injury arose out of and in the course of the employment and was the direct result of either an injury by accident or a specific traumatic incident of the work assigned. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-2</cross_reference>(6); <em>Richards v. Town of</em><em>Valdese</em>, <cross_reference>92 N.C. App. 222</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>224</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>374 S.E.2d 116</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>118</cross_reference> (1988),<em>disc. review denied</em>, <cross_reference>324 N.C. 337</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>378 S.E.2d 799</cross_reference> (1989). Our courts have held that an injury is also compensable if it materially accelerates or aggravates a preexisting condition, and proximately contributes to disability. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-2</cross_reference>; <em>Brown v. Family</em><em>Dollar Distrib. Ctr.</em> <cross_reference>129 N.C. App. 361</cross_reference> (1998).</p>\n<p>2. On August 10 and 15, 2005, when Plaintiff fell while working for Defendant, Plaintiff suffered compensable injuries by accident to his back that arose out of and in the course of his employment with Defendant. The falls constituted interruptions of Plaintiff's normal work routines and the introduction thereby of conditions likely to result in unexpected consequences. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-2</cross_reference>(6); <em>Harding v. Thomas  Howard Co</em>.,<cross_reference>256 N.C. 427</cross_reference> (1962). These compensable injuries by accident caused Plaintiff's back condition or materially accelerated or aggravated a preexisting non-disabling condition. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-2</cross_reference>(6);<em>Brown v. Family Dollar Distrib. Ctr.</em>, <cross_reference>129 N.C. App. 361</cross_reference> (1998). <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 9</span> </p>\n<p>3. Plaintiff's termination from employment from Defendant is attributable to reasons unrelated to the August 10 and 15, 2005 falls. <em>Seagraves v. Austin Co. of</em><em>Greensboro</em>, <cross_reference>123 N.C. App. 228</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>472 S.E.2d 397</cross_reference> (1996).</p>\n<p>4. Given the medical evidence and testimony in this matter, Plaintiff has not reached the end of the healing period and is not at maximum medical improvement with regard to the back condition he sustained as a result of the August 10 and/or 15. 2005 workplace falls. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-31</cross_reference>; <em>Horne v. Universal Leaf</em><em>Processors</em>, <cross_reference>119 N.C. App. 682</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>459 S.E.2d 797</cross_reference>, <em>rev.</em><em>denied</em>, <cross_reference>342 N.C. 192</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>463 S.E.2d 237</cross_reference> (1995).</p>\n<p>5. \"[W]hen the primary injury is shown to have arisen out of and in the course of employment, every natural consequence that flows from the injury arises out of the employment, unless it is the result of an independent intervening cause attributable to claimant's own intentional conduct.\" <em>English v. J.P.</em><em>Stevens  Co.</em>, <cross_reference>98 N.C. App. 466</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>391 S.E.2d 499</cross_reference> (1990);<em>Roper v. J.P. Stevens  Co.</em>,<cross_reference>65 N.C. App. 69</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>308 S.E.2d 485</cross_reference> (1983), <em>disc. review denied</em>,<cross_reference>310 N.C. 309</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>312 S.E.2d 352</cross_reference> (1984). In this case, the back pain and spasms Plaintiff experienced subsequent to yard work and other activities in August 2006 were naturally-flowing consequences of his back condition consequent of the August 10 and/or 15, 2005 workplace falls, and were not the result of an independent intervening cause attributable to Plaintiff's own intentional conduct.</p>\n<p>6. Subject to the provisions of N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-25.1</cross_reference>, Plaintiff is entitled to have Defendant provide all medical treatment, incurred or to be incurred, necessitated by the August 10 and 15, 2005 compensable injuries when bills for the same have been approved pursuant to Industrial Commission procedures. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>97-25</cross_reference>  <cross_reference>97-25.1</cross_reference>. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 10</span> </p>\n<p>7. The North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act gives the Industrial Commission the power to \"order such further [medical] treatments as may in the discretion of the Commission be necessary,\" with the cost to be borne by the Defendant. Furthermore, the Industrial Commission may \"at any time . . . order a change in treatment and designate other treatment suggested by the injured employee. . . .\" N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-25</cross_reference>. Given the facts of this case, Dr. James E. Rice is the best physician to direct Plaintiff's care at this time. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-25</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>8. Neither party pursued any issue in this matter in an unreasonable manner or without reasonable ground. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-88.1</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p><center>                               ***********</center>\nBased upon the foregoing Stipulations, Finding of Fact and Conclusions of Law the Full Commission enters the following:</p>\n<p><center>                                  <u>AWARD</u></center>\n1.

Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-25.1</cross_reference>. Prospectively, this treatment shall be directed by Dr. James E. Rice.</p>\n<p>2. No attorney's fees are appropriate to be awarded in this matter under N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-88.1</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>3.

As a result of the August 15, 2005 incident, Plaintiff was sent by Defendant to the Richmond Memorial Hospital Emergency Department.</p>\n<p>7. Plaintiff continued to receive treatment for his back condition from Richmond Family Medicine at the direction and expense of Defendant. On October 21, 2005, Richmond Family Medicine attempted to refer Plaintiff to an orthopaedist.</p>\n<p>8. On November 3, 2005, Plaintiff began receiving treatment from Pinehurst Surgical Clinic. However, Plaintiff apparently only received treatment from P.A. Kevin Slater at Pinehurst Surgical Clinic.</p>\n<p>9. On November 21, 2005, P.A. Slater released Plaintiff from the care of Pinehurst Surgical Clinic in order for Plaintiff to undergo total knee replacement surgery. Plaintiff's knee condition and the replacement surgery are unrelated to any workplace injury. The medical note from November 21, 2005 anticipated Plaintiff returning to Pinehurst Surgical for back treatment after Plaintiff's total knee replacement was completed. At this time Plaintiff remained under work restrictions due to his back condition.</p>\n<p>10. By letter dated August 9, 2006, Plaintiff's employment with Defendant was terminated due to Plaintiff's physical inability to undergo Officer Refresher Training. This training required Plaintiff to be able to compete in hand-to-hand combat drills. Plaintiff's physical inability to complete this training was a result of his knee condition subsequent to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 6</span> \ntotal knee replacement surgery. The last day Plaintiff actually worked for Defendant was May 23, 2006.</p>\n<p>11. As of the date of the hearing before the Deputy Commissioner, Plaintiff was working 40 hours per week as a Security Officer for Charlotte Aircraft.</p>\n<p>12. Plaintiff asked for, and received, permission from Defendant to receive treatment for his back condition subsequent to his last day worked for Defendant. Plaintiff thereafter resumed care under P.A. Slater at Pinehurst Surgical Clinic on August 25, 2006. The time gap in treatment for Plaintiff's back condition resulted from Plaintiff's unrelated knee replacement surgery.</p>\n<p>13. In August, 2006, Plaintiff suffered spasms and pain in his back subsequent to yard work and other activities. This pain was a flare-up of his condition that resulted from the August 10 and/or 15, 2005 workplace falls rather than from a new injury or condition.</p>\n<p>14. On November 30, 2006 Plaintiff underwent an MRI to his lumbar spine. The MRI report found, among other things, an L4-5 \"broad based disc bulge, spondylotic spurring and degenerative facet arthropathy resulting in a mild degree of central and bilateral neural for aminal canal stenosis.\"</p>\n<p>15. Plaintiff underwent a Functional Capacity Evaluation on May 22, 2007. Defendant paid for this assessment.</p>\n<p>16. Given the medical evidence and testimony in this matter, Plaintiff has not reached the end of the healing period and is not at maximum medical improvement with regard to the back condition sustained as a result of the August 10 and/or 15, 2005 workplace incidents.</p>\n<p>17. The back pain and spasms Plaintiff experienced subsequent to yard work and other activities in August 2006 were naturally-flowing consequences of his back condition <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 7</span> \nconsequent of the August 2005 workplace falls, and were not the result of an independent intervening cause attributable to claimant's own intentional conduct.</p>\n<p>18. P.A. Kevin Slater testified by deposition that the findings evident on Plaintiff's November 30, 2006 MRI resulted from Plaintiff's August 10, 2005 workplace fall. P.A. Slater further testified that the medical treatment Plaintiff received in and subsequent to August 2006 was for treatment of the back condition consequent of Plaintiff's workplace fall of August 10, 2005.</p>\n<p>19. Dr. Rice testified by deposition that Plaintiff suffers some permanent partial disability as a result of the back condition resulting from the workplace falls. Dr. Rice further testified that Plaintiff would benefit from additional medical treatment for this back condition.</p>\n<p>20. On August 10 and 15, 2005, Plaintiff fell and suffered compensable injuries to his back that arose out of and in the course of his employment with Defendant. The falls constituted interruptions of Plaintiff's normal work routine and the introduction thereby of conditions likely to result in unexpected consequences.</p>\n<p>21. The credible medical evidence of record shows that as a result of the August 10 and/or 15, 2005 falls, Plaintiff currently suffers from a back condition that requires medical treatment.</p>\n<p>22. Given the facts of this case, Dr. James E. Rice is the best physician to assume Plaintiff's care at this time. Dr. Rice's care is reasonably calculated to provide relief from Plaintiff's compensable conditions.</p>\n<p>23. Plaintiff's employment with Defendant was terminated for reasons unrelated to his workers' compensation injury. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 8</span> </p>\n<p>24. Neither party pursued any issue in this matter in an unreasonable manner or without reasonable ground.</p>\n<p><center>                               ***********</center>\nBased on the foregoing findings of fact, the Full Commission makes the following:</p>\n<p><center>                           <u>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</u></center>\n1. In order to establish a compensable back injury, a Plaintiff must prove that the disabling back injury arose out of and in the course of the employment and was the direct result of either an injury by accident or a specific traumatic incident of the work assigned. N.C. Gen. Stat. &#167; <cross_reference>97-2</cross_reference>(6); <em>Richards v.

On August 10 and 15, 2005, when Plaintiff fell while working for Defendant, Plaintiff suffered compensable injuries by accident to his back that arose out of and in the course of his employment with Defendant.
