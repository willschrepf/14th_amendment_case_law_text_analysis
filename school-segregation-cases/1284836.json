See Fed. R. App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore\nordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding\nprecedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and\ncollateral estoppel.

Anderson,\n\nan African-American special education teacher, bases his claims of discrimination\n\non theories of disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and constructive\n\ndischarge. 1 For substantially the same reasons as the district court, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                          A\n\n      From August 2000 to January 2006, Anderson was employed by the School\n\nDistrict to teach at Bella Vista Elementary School in Clovis, New Mexico. The\n\nfirst three years of his tenure were apparently uneventful. In the fall of 2003,\n\nhowever, the School District hired Estrada as principal of Bella Vista and,\n\nsuccinctly stated, he and Anderson did not get along. Anderson alleges that\n\nEstrada treated him harshly compared to the non-African-American teachers at the\n\nschool. He also claims that his teaching was subjected to greater scrutiny, that he\n\nwas evaluated more frequently, and that Estrada was generally disrespectful in his\n\ninteractions with him. As evidence of his prima facie case of racial\n\ndiscrimination, Anderson points to several examples of adverse actions that\n\nEstrada took against him.\n\n\n1\n      In addition to claims of racial discrimination, Anderson’s complaint also\nincluded age-discrimination and breach-of-contract claims, which the district\ncourt dismissed. Anderson does not challenge the dismissal of those claims on\nappeal.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      Anderson first claims that Estrada unlawfully placed him on a professional\n\ngrowth plan in September 2005. The plan at issue was reflected in a five-page\n\ndocument, which generally detailed: (1) areas in which Estrada thought Anderson\n\nneeded to improve, (2) a proposed timeline for the noted improvements, (3) ways\n\nin which Anderson’s progress would be measured, and (4) resources at\n\nAnderson’s disposal to assist him in meeting the identified goals. Anderson\n\nimmediately rejected the growth plan because, in his opinion, it was unnecessary\n\nas he was already in compliance with his duties as a special education teacher and\n\nthere were no problems with his performance. He admitted at his deposition that\n\nhe did not cooperate with Estrada during the growth plan process and that he did\n\nnot make any extra effort to accomplish the goals set forth in the plan.\n\n      Second, Anderson claims that Estrada generally treated him harshly.\n\nOffering discrete examples of this type of treatment, Anderson argues that during\n\na September 2003 meeting, Estrada became so angry with him that he yelled at\n\nAnderson and pointed a finger in his face, humiliating and degrading him in front\n\nof his colleagues. Anderson also claims that his laptop computer was stolen in\n\nJanuary 2004, and that Estrada not only refused to replace it, but also implied that\n\nAnderson himself may have been involved in the theft. Finally, Anderson\n\nmaintains that non-African-American teachers were provided with equipment that\n\nhe was denied, and that he was required to teach a heavier case load than the\n\nother special education teacher at Bella Vista.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      As his third argument that Estrada discriminated against him, Anderson\n\npoints to a formal reprimand that he received around the same time that he was\n\nplaced on the challenged growth plan. In October 2005, Estrada admonished\n\nAnderson for unruly student behavior in his classroom. According to Mandy\n\nRatledge, a fellow teacher, she and a parent visited Anderson’s classroom on\n\nOctober 7, 2005, and were greeted by a class that was “out of control with\n\nstudents yelling, running around the room, or playing on the floor.” Ratledge\n\nreported the incident to Estrada, who, after meeting with Anderson, drafted a\n\nformal reprimand, dated October 12. It stated: “This communication shall serve\n\nas a written reprimand [for] your failure to manage a small classroom setting.”\n\nTo prevent the problem from recurring, the document instructed Anderson to keep\n\nhis door open. Disagreeing with the action taken against him, Anderson\n\nresponded to Estrada in writing, stating that his educational assistant was partly to\n\nblame for the “classroom disrespect and disciplining impairments.”\n\n      Beginning with the 2005-06 school year, Anderson was denied participation\n\nin the after-school program through which he had earned extra income in the past.\n\nIn his deposition, Estrada stated that Anderson’s exclusion resulted from a\n\ndistrict-wide effort to refrain from using any regular full-time teachers in the\n\nprogram in favor of non-school staff. He testified that during the 2005-06 school\n\nyear full-time teachers were occasionally hired to work in the after-school\n\nprogram, but solely “on a substitute basis and really in emergency cases only.”\n\n                                          -4-\n\fFor his part, Anderson disputes this statement, declaring that the real reason for\n\nhis termination from the program was unlawful discrimination. 2\n\n        Anderson does not accuse Estrada or anyone else at Bella Vista of making\n\novertly discriminatory remarks. In fact, at his deposition, he conceded that he\n\nwas unsure whether Estrada’s attitude towards him was because of his race. He\n\nlater testified by affidavit, however, that “Estrada fraternized with the white\n\nfemale teachers, while being harsh and abrasive in his interactions with\n\n[Anderson]” and that “[h]e would joke and laugh with the white teachers, while\n\nbeing stern with [Anderson].” Additionally, he alleges that in the fall of 2003, he\n\ncomplained to Jim McDaniel, Assistant Superintendent for Personnel, that he felt\n\nEstrada was treating him unfairly. McDaniel allegedly responded to Estrada by\n\nstating, “‘I don’t know if Estrada has a problem with your race, he’s from\n\nCarlsbad, New Mexico.’” 3 According to Anderson, Estrada also once told him\n\nthat he was glad to have Anderson at Bella Vista “as a minority, . . . but not as a\n\nteacher.”\n\n\n\n\n2\n       In addition to the incidents discussed, Anderson also mentions three other\nadverse actions taken against him. He alleges that Estrada improperly: (1)\nremoved him from his case-manager duties; (2) denied him the opportunity to\nmentor fellow teachers; and (3) subjected him to unnecessary observation by a\nthird party.\n3\n        According to Anderson, Carlsbad historically segregated school students by\nrace.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                                         B\n\n      Following completion of discovery, the defendants jointly moved for\n\nsummary judgment on all of Anderson’s claims. They primarily based their\n\ndisparate treatment arguments on the assertion that none of the aforementioned\n\nevents rose to the level of an adverse employment action sufficient to trigger Title\n\nVII liability. For the most part, the district court agreed with the defendants. The\n\ncourt first concluded that Anderson had failed to adduce any direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination, and that the success of his claims therefore depended on whether\n\nhe had established indirect evidence of discrimination under the rubric laid out in\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Because the parties’\n\ndisagreement was limited to whether Anderson had suffered adverse employment\n\naction based on the incidents described above, the court examined each of the\n\nallegedly adverse actions. It determined that Estrada’s placement of Anderson on\n\na professional growth plan and his otherwise harsh treatment did not constitute\n\nadverse employment actions as a matter of law. Similarly, the court concluded\n\nthat the formal reprimand Anderson received was not an adverse action because it\n\nhad no material impact on his employment status. As to the remaining claims of\n\nadverse actions, the district court simply assumed that they were adverse, and\n\nconcluded that the defendants had offered legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nrationales for each action taken. It then concluded that Anderson had failed to\n\nrebut the offered justification with any evidence that suggested the reasons given\n\n                                        -6-\n\fwere pretextual. Finally, the court dismissed Anderson’s hostile work\n\nenvironment and constructive discharge claims for lack of jurisdiction, holding\n\nthat he had failed to exhaust those claims by raising them before the EEOC. In\n\nthe alternative, the court concluded that even if it had jurisdiction over those\n\nclaims, they were without merit.\n\n                                          II\n\n      Before us, Anderson does not challenge the district court’s finding that he\n\nfailed to present any direct evidence of discrimination. He instead argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that Estrada’s treatment, in particular placing\n\nhim on a growth plan and issuing a written reprimand, did not constitute adverse\n\nemployment actions. He also contends, more generally, that the district court’s\n\nfailure to find pretext in Estrada’s justifications for his decisions was error.\n\nFinally, he challenges both the jurisdictional and evidentiary bases for the\n\ndismissal of his hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims.\n\n                                          A\n\n      “We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\napplying the same legal standard used by the district court.” Haynes v. Level 3\n\nCommc’ns, LLC, 456 F.3d 1215, 1218-19 (10th Cir. 2006) (quotation omitted).\n\nSummary judgment is appropriate “if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure\n\nmaterials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed.\n\n                                          -7-\n\fR. Civ. P. 56(c). When reviewing the dismissal of a Title VII discrimination\n\nclaim at the summary judgment stage, we follow the three-step framework set\n\nforth in McDonnell Douglas. A plaintiff must first “raise a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact on each element of the prima facie case.” MacKenzie v. City and\n\nCounty of Denver, 414 F.3d 1266, 1274 (10th Cir. 2005). Thereafter, the burden\n\nshifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the\n\nadverse action. Id. Once the employer does so, the plaintiff must offer evidence\n\nsufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the proffered\n\nreason was pretextual. Id. In a disparate treatment case, the plaintiff makes out\n\nhis prima facie case by demonstrating “(1) that he is a member of a racial\n\nminority, (2) that he suffered an adverse employment action, and (3) that\n\nsimilarly situated employees were treated differently.” Trujillo v. Univ. of Colo.\n\nHealth Sciences Ctr., 157 F.3d 1211, 1215 (10th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).\n\n                                          B\n\n      Anderson contends that the district court erred in rejecting his disparate\n\ntreatment claims based on the growth plan, other harsh treatment, and written\n\nreprimand. He argues that the incidents alleged rise to the level of adverse\n\nemployment actions sufficient to make out a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\nRelying primarily on Schuler v. City of Boulder, 189 F.3d 1304 (10th Cir. 1999),\n\nAnderson urges that the growth plan at issue in this case was sufficiently onerous\n\nto constitute an adverse employment action because it was both unnecessary and\n\n                                         -8-\n\fspecifically designed with unachievable goals. He also claims that the formal\n\nreprimand rose to the level of an adverse employment action under the law of this\n\ncircuit.\n\n       In Schuler, a former city employee claimed that the city retaliated against\n\nher for exercising free speech rights. Id. at 1307. She was not fired or\n\nsuspended, but the city did remove some of her job duties, issue a written\n\nreprimand, and assign low scores on her performance evaluation. Id. at 1306-07.\n\nWe held these to be adverse employment actions, acknowledging that “[a]ctions\n\nshort of an actual or constructive employment decision can in certain\n\ncircumstances violate the First Amendment.” Id. at 1309-10 (quotation omitted).\n\nThis general proposition, however, does not elevate Anderson’s aversion to the\n\ngrowth plan to an actionable Title VII claim.\n\n       “While adverse employment actions extend beyond readily quantifiable\n\nlosses, not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse\n\naction. Otherwise, minor and even trivial employment actions . . . would form the\n\nbasis of a discrimination suit.” MacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1279 (quotation omitted).\n\nWe do not mean to trivialize the subjective importance of the growth plan to\n\nAnderson. But we must stress that even if Estrada’s motives were discriminatory,\n\nwhich is not evident from the record before us, his implementation of the growth\n\nplan did not violate Title VII. See Heno v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., 208 F.3d\n\n847, 857 (10th Cir. 2000) (explaining that Title VII only proscribes\n\n                                         -9-\n\fdiscriminatory conduct that “alters the employee’s compensation, terms,\n\nconditions, or privileges of employment, or adversely affects his or her status as\n\nan employee” (quotations omitted)).\n\n      Only acts that constitute a significant change in employment status,\n      such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with\n      significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a\n      significant change in benefits will rise to the level of an adverse\n      employment action.\n\nHaynes, 456 F.3d at 1222 (quotation omitted). The growth plan may have\n\nangered and embarrassed Anderson, but it did not affect his compensation or the\n\nterms, conditions, or privileges of his employment. To the contrary, it appears\n\nthe plan was simply a tool to enhance Anderson’s performance as a special\n\neducation teacher. It was his refusal to accept the plan that appears to have been\n\nthe problem. We therefore agree with the district court’s rejection of the growth\n\nplan as a basis for a disparate treatment claim. See Haynes, 456 F.3d at 1224\n\n(joining our sister circuits in holding that a professional improvement plan,\n\nstanding alone, is not an adverse employment action).\n\n      We reach the same conclusion with respect to the October 12, 2005, formal\n\nreprimand. As we noted in Haynes, a written warning constitutes an adverse\n\nemployment action “only if it effects a significant change in the plaintiff’s\n\nemployment status.” 456 F.3d at 1224. Anderson’s reprimand served as a\n\nwarning that he faced consequences if he did not improve his classroom\n\nmanagement skills. It did not serve as a demotion, alter his pay, or change his\n\n                                         -10-\n\fresponsibilities in any significant manner. As with the growth plan, he “was\n\npresented with clear goals to achieve [his] continued employment.” Id. at 1225.\n\nWe thus conclude that the reprimand fails to rise to the level of an adverse\n\nemployment action.\n\n      Finally, Anderson contends that the general level of disrespect and\n\nharshness with which Estrada treated him should have been considered as a\n\ndiscriminatory adverse employment action. In support of this claim for relief, he\n\npoints to numerous unpleasant interactions with his principal, including one in\n\nwhich Estrada allegedly threatened to hit him. 4 Without more, however, such a\n\nthreat does not automatically equate to a Title VII violation. It is beyond dispute\n\nthat Anderson enjoyed a less-than-friendly relationship with Estrada, but as we\n\nhave noted, “not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable\n\nadverse action.” MacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1279 (quotation omitted).\n\n                                         C\n\n      The district court did assume that certain incidents raised by Anderson rose\n\nto the level of adverse employment actions. These included Estrada’s decision to:\n\n(1) remove Anderson from the after-school program, (2) relieve him of his case-\n\nmanager duties, (3) deny him the opportunity to mentor his fellow teachers, and\n\n(4) have an independent evaluator observe his teaching. As to these, however, the\n\n4\n       This accusation might warrant more discussion if it had any support in the\nrecord other than Anderson’s deposition testimony that he believed Estrada might\nhit him simply because he was using an “aggressive . . . tone of voice.”\n\n                                        -11-\n\fcourt concluded that the defendants advanced legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nreasons in explanation, and that Anderson failed to respond with evidence of\n\npretext. On appeal, Anderson does not dispute the non-discriminatory reasons\n\nproffered by the defendants for the actions taken. He instead challenges the\n\ndistrict court’s conclusion regarding his purported evidence of pretext.\n\n      As primary support for his pretext argument, Anderson contends generally\n\nthat he did not have performance issues before Estrada took over as principal.\n\nNevertheless, even if true, that fact is not enough to show pretext. To defeat\n\nsummary judgment, Anderson was required to show that following Estrada’s\n\narrival, there were no legitimate issues with his performance or that performance\n\nconcerns were not the genuine reasons for the actions. He could have done this\n\n“either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely\n\nmotivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer’s proffered\n\nexplanation [was] unworthy of credence.” Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v.\n\nBurdine, 450 U.S. 248, 256 (1981).\n\n      The record does not support either of these scenarios. We are satisfied that\n\nteachers and administrators alike, as well as Anderson’s educational assistant, felt\n\nhe did not exercise adequate control over his classroom. His assistant, Lisa Dant,\n\ntestified that the appellant was so disorganized that he sometimes misplaced his\n\nstudents’ work. She stated that, on at least one occasion, Anderson assigned\n\ngrades of zero as a consequence of having lost students’ work. These problems\n\n                                        -12-\n\fwere reported to Estrada, who reacted by implementing the growth plan, reducing\n\nAnderson’s responsibilities, and sending independent observers into his\n\nclassroom. We agree with the district court that these actions were “legitimate\n\nresponses on the part of an employer concerned with employee performance.”\n\nMoreover, there is simply no evidence to support Anderson’s theory that his\n\nperformance issues were a pretext for unlawful discrimination. Defendants were\n\ntherefore entitled to summary judgment on this claim. See EEOC v. PVNF,\n\nL.L.C., 487 F.3d 790, 800 n.5 (10th Cir. 2007) (recognizing that “if the court\n\ncorrectly concludes that the evidence of discrimination/pretext fails as a matter of\n\nlaw, summary judgment for the defendant is the proper result”).\n\n                                          D\n\n      This brings us to Anderson’s claims of a hostile work environment and\n\nconstructive discharge. The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction\n\nover these claims because Anderson had failed to raise them before the EEOC.\n\nAnderson does not specifically challenge this aspect of that decision on review.\n\nHe instead focuses on his 42 U.S.C. § 1981 claims, and argues that these claims\n\ndo not require exhaustion of administrative remedies. We are nonetheless “under\n\na continuing obligation to examine both [our] own jurisdiction and the\n\njurisdiction of the district court, whether or not raised by the parties.” Local 514\n\nTransp. Workers Union v. Keating, 358 F.3d 743, 749 n.6 (10th Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\f      “Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a ‘jurisdictional prerequisite’ to\n\nsuit under Title VII.” Jones v. Runyon, 91 F.3d 1398, 1399 (10th Cir. 1996). We\n\nhave thus recognized that “[a] plaintiff's claim in federal court is generally\n\nlimited by the scope of the administrative investigation that can reasonably be\n\nexpected to follow the charge of discrimination submitted to the EEOC.”\n\nMacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1274 (citations omitted). Anderson filed a charge of\n\nracial discrimination with the EEOC, but did not specifically note “hostile work\n\nenvironment” and “constructive discharge” charges on the form.\n\n      Were we not required to “liberally construe charges filed with the EEOC in\n\ndetermining whether administrative remedies have been exhausted as to a\n\nparticular claim,” Jones v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., 502 F.3d 1176, 1186 (10th\n\nCir. 2007), we might agree with the district court that this fact would prevent us\n\nfrom hearing these arguments. See MacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1274 (liberally\n\nconstruing a plaintiff’s charge of discrimination based on the ADA). However,\n\nreviewing the record before us, we conclude that these additional legal theories\n\nwere, in factual substance, sufficiently alleged in the EEOC filing. Specifically,\n\nAnderson stated that “[b]eginning in February 2005 and continuing on a\n\ncontinuous basis I have been subjected to adverse terms and conditions unlike my\n\npeers.” He also checked the box indicating that the discrimination was based on\n\nhis race. Like the court in Jones, we think these two claims “can reasonably be\n\nexpected to follow the charge of discrimination,” see 502 F.3d at 1187 (quoting\n\n                                         -14-\n\fMacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1274), and thus conclude that Anderson’s charge was\n\nsufficient to exhaust his administrative remedies and thereby confer jurisdiction.\n\nWe thus turn to the merits of those claims.\n\n                                          1\n\n      To survive summary judgment on a claim alleging a racially hostile work\n\nenvironment, Anderson had to “show that a rational jury could find that the\n\nworkplace [was] permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,\n\nthat [was] sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his]\n\nemployment and create an abusive working environment.” Sandoval v. City of\n\nBoulder, 388 F.3d 1312, 1327 (10th Cir. 2004). He had to show that he “was\n\ntargeted for harassment because of [his] . . . race[] or national origin.” Id.\n\nBecause he has failed to produce any evidence tending to show that anyone at\n\nBella Vista harbored racial animus towards him, Anderson has not made the\n\nrequired showing.\n\n      McDaniel’s obscure remark that Estrada hailed from Carlsbad and Estrada’s\n\nown comment that he was glad to have Anderson “as a minority, but not as a\n\nteacher,” do not create a fact issue as to this claim when viewed in the totality of\n\nthe circumstances. See PVNF, 487 F.3d at 799 (recognizing that the “totality of\n\nthe circumstances test . . . is the touchstone of our analysis of hostile work\n\nenvironment claims” (quotations omitted)). A pervasively hostile work\n\nenvironment is not established “by demonstrating a few isolated incidents of\n\n                                         -15-\n\fracial enmity or sporadic racial slurs. Instead, there must be a steady barrage of\n\nopprobrious racial comments.” Herrera v. Lufkin Indus., Inc., 474 F.3d 675, 680\n\n(10th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted). We examine the record from both an\n\nobjective and subjective standpoint, “looking at all the circumstances from the\n\nperspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position.” Id. No reasonable\n\nfact-finder could conclude under this standard that Anderson was subjected to a\n\nhostile work environment. In fact, the relevant factors—frequency, severity, and\n\nwhether the conduct unreasonably interfered with Anderson’s work\n\nperformance—are not available for examination because there is no evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory conduct. See Harsco Corp. v. Renner, 475 F.3d 1179, 1187 (10th\n\nCir. 2007) (listing factors to be considered in determining whether environment is\n\nhostile or abusive). The district court therefore appropriately dismissed this claim\n\non the merits.\n\n                                          2\n\n      We reach a substantially similar conclusion with respect to the alleged\n\nconstructive discharge claim posited by Anderson because he has again failed to\n\nshow actionable discrimination.\n\n      Constructive discharge occurs when the employer by its illegal\n      discriminatory acts has made working conditions so difficult that a\n      reasonable person in the employee’s position would feel compelled\n      to resign. Essentially, a plaintiff must show that [he] had no other\n      choice but to quit. The conditions of employment must be\n      objectively intolerable; the plaintiff’s subjective views of the\n      situation are irrelevant.\n\n                                        -16-\n\fSandoval, 388 F.3d at 1325 (quotation omitted). The plaintiff carries a heavy\n\nburden on a constructive discharge claim. It is not enough that his employer’s\n\nconduct constituted adverse employment action or that it was discriminatory; a\n\nconstructive discharge claim “requires a showing that the working conditions\n\nimposed by the employer are not only tangible or adverse, but intolerable.”\n\nPVNF, 487 F.3d at 805 (quotation omitted). Anderson may have felt “ganged up\n\non” and “alone oftentimes,” but “given the objective standard, an employee’s\n\nsubjective feelings or beliefs are not relevant in a constructive discharge claim.”\n\nHeno, 208 F.3d at 858. Regrettable as Anderson’s departure may have been, there\n\nis simply a dearth of evidence in the record before us that the working conditions\n\nat Bella Vista were such that a reasonable employee would have felt he had no\n\nother choice but to quit. His constructive discharge claim was therefore properly\n\ndismissed.\n\n                                         III\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the district court correctly\n\ndismissed Anderson’s Title VII claims. Because his claim brought under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981 was based on the same allegations of disparate treatment, that\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fclaim was also properly dismissed. Etsitty v. Utah Transit Auth., 502 F.3d 1215,\n\n1227-28 (10th Cir. 2007).

Anderson,\n\nan African-American special education teacher, bases his claims of discrimination\n\non theories of disparate treatment, hostile work environment, and constructive\n\ndischarge. 1 For substantially the same reasons as the district court, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                          I\n\n                                          A\n\n      From August 2000 to January 2006, Anderson was employed by the School\n\nDistrict to teach at Bella Vista Elementary School in Clovis, New Mexico. The\n\nfirst three years of his tenure were apparently uneventful. In the fall of 2003,\n\nhowever, the School District hired Estrada as principal of Bella Vista and,\n\nsuccinctly stated, he and Anderson did not get along. Anderson alleges that\n\nEstrada treated him harshly compared to the non-African-American teachers at the\n\nschool. He also claims that his teaching was subjected to greater scrutiny, that he\n\nwas evaluated more frequently, and that Estrada was generally disrespectful in his\n\ninteractions with him. As evidence of his prima facie case of racial\n\ndiscrimination, Anderson points to several examples of adverse actions that\n\nEstrada took against him.\n\n\n1\n      In addition to claims of racial discrimination, Anderson’s complaint also\nincluded age-discrimination and breach-of-contract claims, which the district\ncourt dismissed. Anderson does not challenge the dismissal of those claims on\nappeal.\n\n                                          -2-\n\f      Anderson first claims that Estrada unlawfully placed him on a professional\n\ngrowth plan in September 2005. The plan at issue was reflected in a five-page\n\ndocument, which generally detailed: (1) areas in which Estrada thought Anderson\n\nneeded to improve, (2) a proposed timeline for the noted improvements, (3) ways\n\nin which Anderson’s progress would be measured, and (4) resources at\n\nAnderson’s disposal to assist him in meeting the identified goals. Anderson\n\nimmediately rejected the growth plan because, in his opinion, it was unnecessary\n\nas he was already in compliance with his duties as a special education teacher and\n\nthere were no problems with his performance. He admitted at his deposition that\n\nhe did not cooperate with Estrada during the growth plan process and that he did\n\nnot make any extra effort to accomplish the goals set forth in the plan.\n\n      Second, Anderson claims that Estrada generally treated him harshly.\n\nOffering discrete examples of this type of treatment, Anderson argues that during\n\na September 2003 meeting, Estrada became so angry with him that he yelled at\n\nAnderson and pointed a finger in his face, humiliating and degrading him in front\n\nof his colleagues. Anderson also claims that his laptop computer was stolen in\n\nJanuary 2004, and that Estrada not only refused to replace it, but also implied that\n\nAnderson himself may have been involved in the theft. Finally, Anderson\n\nmaintains that non-African-American teachers were provided with equipment that\n\nhe was denied, and that he was required to teach a heavier case load than the\n\nother special education teacher at Bella Vista.\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      As his third argument that Estrada discriminated against him, Anderson\n\npoints to a formal reprimand that he received around the same time that he was\n\nplaced on the challenged growth plan. In October 2005, Estrada admonished\n\nAnderson for unruly student behavior in his classroom. According to Mandy\n\nRatledge, a fellow teacher, she and a parent visited Anderson’s classroom on\n\nOctober 7, 2005, and were greeted by a class that was “out of control with\n\nstudents yelling, running around the room, or playing on the floor.” Ratledge\n\nreported the incident to Estrada, who, after meeting with Anderson, drafted a\n\nformal reprimand, dated October 12. It stated: “This communication shall serve\n\nas a written reprimand [for] your failure to manage a small classroom setting.”\n\nTo prevent the problem from recurring, the document instructed Anderson to keep\n\nhis door open. Disagreeing with the action taken against him, Anderson\n\nresponded to Estrada in writing, stating that his educational assistant was partly to\n\nblame for the “classroom disrespect and disciplining impairments.”\n\n      Beginning with the 2005-06 school year, Anderson was denied participation\n\nin the after-school program through which he had earned extra income in the past.\n\nIn his deposition, Estrada stated that Anderson’s exclusion resulted from a\n\ndistrict-wide effort to refrain from using any regular full-time teachers in the\n\nprogram in favor of non-school staff. He testified that during the 2005-06 school\n\nyear full-time teachers were occasionally hired to work in the after-school\n\nprogram, but solely “on a substitute basis and really in emergency cases only.”\n\n                                          -4-\n\fFor his part, Anderson disputes this statement, declaring that the real reason for\n\nhis termination from the program was unlawful discrimination. 2\n\n        Anderson does not accuse Estrada or anyone else at Bella Vista of making\n\novertly discriminatory remarks. In fact, at his deposition, he conceded that he\n\nwas unsure whether Estrada’s attitude towards him was because of his race. He\n\nlater testified by affidavit, however, that “Estrada fraternized with the white\n\nfemale teachers, while being harsh and abrasive in his interactions with\n\n[Anderson]” and that “[h]e would joke and laugh with the white teachers, while\n\nbeing stern with [Anderson].” Additionally, he alleges that in the fall of 2003, he\n\ncomplained to Jim McDaniel, Assistant Superintendent for Personnel, that he felt\n\nEstrada was treating him unfairly. McDaniel allegedly responded to Estrada by\n\nstating, “‘I don’t know if Estrada has a problem with your race, he’s from\n\nCarlsbad, New Mexico.’” 3 According to Anderson, Estrada also once told him\n\nthat he was glad to have Anderson at Bella Vista “as a minority, . . . but not as a\n\nteacher.”\n\n\n\n\n2\n       In addition to the incidents discussed, Anderson also mentions three other\nadverse actions taken against him. He alleges that Estrada improperly: (1)\nremoved him from his case-manager duties; (2) denied him the opportunity to\nmentor fellow teachers; and (3) subjected him to unnecessary observation by a\nthird party.\n3\n        According to Anderson, Carlsbad historically segregated school students by\nrace.\n\n                                         -5-\n\f                                         B\n\n      Following completion of discovery, the defendants jointly moved for\n\nsummary judgment on all of Anderson’s claims. They primarily based their\n\ndisparate treatment arguments on the assertion that none of the aforementioned\n\nevents rose to the level of an adverse employment action sufficient to trigger Title\n\nVII liability. For the most part, the district court agreed with the defendants. The\n\ncourt first concluded that Anderson had failed to adduce any direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination, and that the success of his claims therefore depended on whether\n\nhe had established indirect evidence of discrimination under the rubric laid out in\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973). Because the parties’\n\ndisagreement was limited to whether Anderson had suffered adverse employment\n\naction based on the incidents described above, the court examined each of the\n\nallegedly adverse actions. It determined that Estrada’s placement of Anderson on\n\na professional growth plan and his otherwise harsh treatment did not constitute\n\nadverse employment actions as a matter of law. Similarly, the court concluded\n\nthat the formal reprimand Anderson received was not an adverse action because it\n\nhad no material impact on his employment status. As to the remaining claims of\n\nadverse actions, the district court simply assumed that they were adverse, and\n\nconcluded that the defendants had offered legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nrationales for each action taken. It then concluded that Anderson had failed to\n\nrebut the offered justification with any evidence that suggested the reasons given\n\n                                        -6-\n\fwere pretextual. Finally, the court dismissed Anderson’s hostile work\n\nenvironment and constructive discharge claims for lack of jurisdiction, holding\n\nthat he had failed to exhaust those claims by raising them before the EEOC. In\n\nthe alternative, the court concluded that even if it had jurisdiction over those\n\nclaims, they were without merit.\n\n                                          II\n\n      Before us, Anderson does not challenge the district court’s finding that he\n\nfailed to present any direct evidence of discrimination. He instead argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that Estrada’s treatment, in particular placing\n\nhim on a growth plan and issuing a written reprimand, did not constitute adverse\n\nemployment actions. He also contends, more generally, that the district court’s\n\nfailure to find pretext in Estrada’s justifications for his decisions was error.\n\nFinally, he challenges both the jurisdictional and evidentiary bases for the\n\ndismissal of his hostile work environment and constructive discharge claims.\n\n                                          A\n\n      “We review the district court’s grant of summary judgment de novo,\n\napplying the same legal standard used by the district court.” Haynes v.

As we noted in Haynes, a written warning constitutes an adverse\n\nemployment action “only if it effects a significant change in the plaintiff’s\n\nemployment status.” 456 F.3d at 1224. Anderson’s reprimand served as a\n\nwarning that he faced consequences if he did not improve his classroom\n\nmanagement skills. It did not serve as a demotion, alter his pay, or change his\n\n                                         -10-\n\fresponsibilities in any significant manner. As with the growth plan, he “was\n\npresented with clear goals to achieve [his] continued employment.” Id. at 1225.\n\nWe thus conclude that the reprimand fails to rise to the level of an adverse\n\nemployment action.\n\n      Finally, Anderson contends that the general level of disrespect and\n\nharshness with which Estrada treated him should have been considered as a\n\ndiscriminatory adverse employment action. In support of this claim for relief, he\n\npoints to numerous unpleasant interactions with his principal, including one in\n\nwhich Estrada allegedly threatened to hit him. 4 Without more, however, such a\n\nthreat does not automatically equate to a Title VII violation. It is beyond dispute\n\nthat Anderson enjoyed a less-than-friendly relationship with Estrada, but as we\n\nhave noted, “not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable\n\nadverse action.” MacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1279 (quotation omitted).\n\n                                         C\n\n      The district court did assume that certain incidents raised by Anderson rose\n\nto the level of adverse employment actions. These included Estrada’s decision to:\n\n(1) remove Anderson from the after-school program, (2) relieve him of his case-\n\nmanager duties, (3) deny him the opportunity to mentor his fellow teachers, and\n\n(4) have an independent evaluator observe his teaching. As to these, however, the\n\n4\n       This accusation might warrant more discussion if it had any support in the\nrecord other than Anderson’s deposition testimony that he believed Estrada might\nhit him simply because he was using an “aggressive . . . tone of voice.”\n\n                                        -11-\n\fcourt concluded that the defendants advanced legitimate, non-discriminatory\n\nreasons in explanation, and that Anderson failed to respond with evidence of\n\npretext. On appeal, Anderson does not dispute the non-discriminatory reasons\n\nproffered by the defendants for the actions taken. He instead challenges the\n\ndistrict court’s conclusion regarding his purported evidence of pretext.\n\n      As primary support for his pretext argument, Anderson contends generally\n\nthat he did not have performance issues before Estrada took over as principal.\n\nNevertheless, even if true, that fact is not enough to show pretext. To defeat\n\nsummary judgment, Anderson was required to show that following Estrada’s\n\narrival, there were no legitimate issues with his performance or that performance\n\nconcerns were not the genuine reasons for the actions. He could have done this\n\n“either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely\n\nmotivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer’s proffered\n\nexplanation [was] unworthy of credence.” Texas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v.\n\nBurdine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 256 (1981).\n\n      The record does not support either of these scenarios. We are satisfied that\n\nteachers and administrators alike, as well as Anderson’s educational assistant, felt\n\nhe did not exercise adequate control over his classroom. His assistant, Lisa Dant,\n\ntestified that the appellant was so disorganized that he sometimes misplaced his\n\nstudents’ work. She stated that, on at least one occasion, Anderson assigned\n\ngrades of zero as a consequence of having lost students’ work. These problems\n\n                                        -12-\n\fwere reported to Estrada, who reacted by implementing the growth plan, reducing\n\nAnderson’s responsibilities, and sending independent observers into his\n\nclassroom. We agree with the district court that these actions were “legitimate\n\nresponses on the part of an employer concerned with employee performance.”\n\nMoreover, there is simply no evidence to support Anderson’s theory that his\n\nperformance issues were a pretext for unlawful discrimination. Defendants were\n\ntherefore entitled to summary judgment on this claim. See EEOC v. PVNF,\n\nL.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"169205\"><a href=\"/opinion/169205/equal-employment-v-pvnf-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 n.5 (10th Cir. 2007) (recognizing that “if the court\n\ncorrectly concludes that the evidence of discrimination/pretext fails as a matter of\n\nlaw, summary judgment for the defendant is the proper result”).\n\n                                          D\n\n      This brings us to Anderson’s claims of a hostile work environment and\n\nconstructive discharge. The district court concluded that it lacked jurisdiction\n\nover these claims because Anderson had failed to raise them before the EEOC.\n\nAnderson does not specifically challenge this aspect of that decision on review.\n\nHe instead focuses on his 42 U.S.C. § 1981 claims, and argues that these claims\n\ndo not require exhaustion of administrative remedies. We are nonetheless “under\n\na continuing obligation to examine both [our] own jurisdiction and the\n\njurisdiction of the district court, whether or not raised by the parties.” Local 514\n\nTransp.

Anderson filed a charge of\n\nracial discrimination with the EEOC, but did not specifically note “hostile work\n\nenvironment” and “constructive discharge” charges on the form.\n\n      Were we not required to “liberally construe charges filed with the EEOC in\n\ndetermining whether administrative remedies have been exhausted as to a\n\nparticular claim,” Jones v.

See MacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1274 (liberally\n\nconstruing a plaintiff’s charge of discrimination based on the ADA). However,\n\nreviewing the record before us, we conclude that these additional legal theories\n\nwere, in factual substance, sufficiently alleged in the EEOC filing. Specifically,\n\nAnderson stated that “[b]eginning in February 2005 and continuing on a\n\ncontinuous basis I have been subjected to adverse terms and conditions unlike my\n\npeers.” He also checked the box indicating that the discrimination was based on\n\nhis race. Like the court in Jones, we think these two claims “can reasonably be\n\nexpected to follow the charge of discrimination,” see 502 F.3d at 1187 (quoting\n\n                                         -14-\n\fMacKenzie, 414 F.3d at 1274), and thus conclude that Anderson’s charge was\n\nsufficient to exhaust his administrative remedies and thereby confer jurisdiction.\n\nWe thus turn to the merits of those claims.\n\n                                          1\n\n      To survive summary judgment on a claim alleging a racially hostile work\n\nenvironment, Anderson had to “show that a rational jury could find that the\n\nworkplace [was] permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult,\n\nthat [was] sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of [his]\n\nemployment and create an abusive working environment.” Sandoval v. City of\n\nBoulder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"165179\"><a href=\"/opinion/165179/sandoval-v-boulder-regional/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1312</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1327 (10th Cir. 2004). He had to show that he “was\n\ntargeted for harassment because of [his] . . . race[] or national origin.” Id.\n\nBecause he has failed to produce any evidence tending to show that anyone at\n\nBella Vista harbored racial animus towards him, Anderson has not made the\n\nrequired showing.\n\n      McDaniel’s obscure remark that Estrada hailed from Carlsbad and Estrada’s\n\nown comment that he was glad to have Anderson “as a minority, but not as a\n\nteacher,” do not create a fact issue as to this claim when viewed in the totality of\n\nthe circumstances. See PVNF, 487 F.3d at 799 (recognizing that the “totality of\n\nthe circumstances test . . . is the touchstone of our analysis of hostile work\n\nenvironment claims” (quotations omitted)). A pervasively hostile work\n\nenvironment is not established “by demonstrating a few isolated incidents of\n\n                                         -15-\n\fracial enmity or sporadic racial slurs. Instead, there must be a steady barrage of\n\nopprobrious racial comments.” Herrera v. Lufkin Indus., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167560\"><a href=\"/opinion/167560/herrera-v-lufkin-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">675</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 680\n\n(10th Cir. 2007) (quotation omitted). We examine the record from both an\n\nobjective and subjective standpoint, “looking at all the circumstances from the\n\nperspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position.” Id. No reasonable\n\nfact-finder could conclude under this standard that Anderson was subjected to a\n\nhostile work environment. In fact, the relevant factors—frequency, severity, and\n\nwhether the conduct unreasonably interfered with Anderson’s work\n\nperformance—are not available for examination because there is no evidence of\n\ndiscriminatory conduct. See Harsco Corp. v. Renner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"168698\"><a href=\"/opinion/168698/renner-v-harsco-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187 (10th\n\nCir. 2007) (listing factors to be considered in determining whether environment is\n\nhostile or abusive). The district court therefore appropriately dismissed this claim\n\non the merits.\n\n                                          2\n\n      We reach a substantially similar conclusion with respect to the alleged\n\nconstructive discharge claim posited by Anderson because he has again failed to\n\nshow actionable discrimination.\n\n      Constructive discharge occurs when the employer by its illegal\n      discriminatory acts has made working conditions so difficult that a\n      reasonable person in the employee’s position would feel compelled\n      to resign. Essentially, a plaintiff must show that [he] had no other\n      choice but to quit. The conditions of employment must be\n      objectively intolerable; the plaintiff’s subjective views of the\n      situation are irrelevant.\n\n                                        -16-\n\fSandoval, 388 F.3d at 1325 (quotation omitted). The plaintiff carries a heavy\n\nburden on a constructive discharge claim. It is not enough that his employer’s\n\nconduct constituted adverse employment action or that it was discriminatory; a\n\nconstructive discharge claim “requires a showing that the working conditions\n\nimposed by the employer are not only tangible or adverse, but intolerable.”\n\nPVNF, 487 F.3d at 805 (quotation omitted). Anderson may have felt “ganged up\n\non” and “alone oftentimes,” but “given the objective standard, an employee’s\n\nsubjective feelings or beliefs are not relevant in a constructive discharge claim.”\n\nHeno, 208 F.3d at 858. Regrettable as Anderson’s departure may have been, there\n\nis simply a dearth of evidence in the record before us that the working conditions\n\nat Bella Vista were such that a reasonable employee would have felt he had no\n\nother choice but to quit. His constructive discharge claim was therefore properly\n\ndismissed.\n\n                                         III\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the district court correctly\n\ndismissed Anderson’s Title VII claims. Because his claim brought under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1981 was based on the same allegations of disparate treatment, that\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fclaim was also properly dismissed.
