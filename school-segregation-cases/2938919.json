The trial\ncourt also awarded Appellees $44,100 in trial court attorneys’ fees and $35,000 in\nappellate attorneys’ fees.     We remand a mineral interest issue, modify the\njudgment to delete appellate attorney’s fees, and affirm as modified.\n\f        Michelle Smith and Appellees are the owners of adjoining rural acreage in\nStephens County. 1 Appellees purchased a portion of their property from Smith’s\nbrother.     In the deed that Smith’s brother gave to Appellees, he mistakenly\ndescribed Smith’s property rather than that which Appellees actually purchased\nfrom him. The minerals were not reserved in the deed. The mistake was later\ncorrected as to the surface, but as far as the summary judgment evidence shows,\nnot as to the minerals. One of the issues in this case involves quieting the title to\nthose minerals.\n        Later, Smith sold Appellees an 85.64-acre tract of land out of the northeast\ncorner of her property.            Appellees’ property joined Smith’s property on the\nnortherly and easterly boundary lines of Smith’s tract. A pivot irrigation system is\nlocated on the 85.64-acre tract. The south boundary line of Smith’s property and\nof Appellees’ property abuts the Clear Fork of the Brazos River. Water was\nsupplied to the pivot system through a buried pipeline that ran from the river and\ncrossed Appellees’ property as well as Smith’s property. After Appellees bought\nthe 85.64-acre tract, they connected a pump to the irrigation system, brought\nelectricity to it, and began pumping water through the pipeline to the pivot system\non the 85.64 acres.\n        Smith claimed that Appellees trespassed on her property when they cut her\nfence and dug a trench across her property for the purpose of installing a pipeline\nand when they installed an electric line across her property. She filed this lawsuit,\nand in her live pleading, under the heading of “Trespass to Try Title,” Smith\nsought to have Killion Partners, Ltd. “execute all necessary and proper instruments\n\n        1\n          In the notice of appeal, Appellees are listed as Richard Lee Killion, Killion Investments, Inc.,\nand Killion Partners, LP. Those names are used interchangeably throughout the record, and it is\nsometimes difficult to tell to whom or to what entity reference is being made. Additionally, Killion\nPartners, LP is sometimes referred to as Killion Partners, Ltd., and sometimes as Killion Partners. We\nwill refer to all of these parties as “Appellees.” Some portions of the final judgment refer only to Richard\nLee Killion, not to the Killion entities; however, we have not been asked to address that.\n                                                     2\n\fto quiet title to the M. Smith Ranch surface and minerals.” She also maintained\nthat, if a water pipeline easement had existed across her property, it had been\nabandoned.\n      Appellees answered Smith’s lawsuit and filed a counterclaim. Among other\nthings, in their second amended original answer, Appellees alleged that, under\nvarious legal theories, Smith was estopped from making her non-mineral interest\nclaims. Appellees also alleged that they were entitled to an easement by estoppel,\nan easement by implication, or an easement by prescription. In their counterclaim,\nAppellees additionally sought a declaratory judgment concerning “the rights under\nthe deed, contract and conveyance from Smith to Killion selling and conveying all\nher right title and interest in and to the real property describe [sic] in the deed\nbetween the parties Dated March 13, 2003.” Appellees sought eight specific\ndeclarations from the trial court.\n      Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. Smith responded to the\nmotion for summary judgment, and as a part of that response, she filed her own\nmotion for summary judgment. Both of the motions were traditional ones. See\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a.       After a hearing on Appellees’ motion for summary\njudgment, the trial court entered judgment for Appellees that Richard Lee Killion\nhad an easement by prescription across Smith’s land to access certain water rights,\nthat Smith pay to Appellees $44,100 for attorneys’ fees, and that Smith pay an\nadditional $20,000 if the case was appealed to the court of appeals and another\n$15,000 if appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. The trial court also declared that\nRichard Lee Killion owned the water rights pertaining to the 85.64-acre tract he\nbought from Smith and that “Defendant/CounterPlaintiff” did not trespass on\nSmith’s property. These latter two declarations are not attacked in this appeal.\n      Smith does, however, present us with three issues on appeal. In her first\nissue, Smith argues that the trial court did not address her claim to remove the\n                                         3\n\fcloud on her mineral interest under the tract of land that remained after the sale of\nthe 85.64-acre tract to Appellees. In her second issue, Smith takes the position that\nthe trial court abused its discretion when it awarded attorneys’ fees for two\nreasons: (1) the declaratory judgment counterclaim was used solely as a vehicle to\nobtain attorneys’ fees and (2) there was no evidence raised in the trial court that the\nappellate attorneys’ fees were reasonable and necessary. Lastly, in her third issue,\nSmith urges us to find that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment\non the pipeline easement issue because her “affidavit showed that the water\neasement had been abandoned by its non-use for more than 30 years.” We will\nbear in mind that these are the only three issues that we have been asked to\naddress.\n                       Standard of Review for Summary Judgments\n      We will apply the well-recognized standards of review for summary\njudgments.    For traditional motions, questions of law are reviewed de novo.\nSt. Paul Ins. Co. v. Tex. Dep’t of Transp., 999 S.W.2d 881 (Tex. App.—Austin\n1999, pet. denied). To determine if a fact question exists, we must consider\nwhether reasonable and fair-minded jurors could differ in their conclusions in light\nof all the evidence presented. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Mayes, 236 S.W.3d\n754, 755 (Tex. 2007).      We must consider all the evidence in the light most\nfavorable to the nonmovant, indulging all reasonable inferences in favor of the\nnonmovant, and determine whether the movant proved that there were no genuine\nissues of material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. City\nof Houston v. Clear Creek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671 (Tex. 1979).\n                             The Mineral Interest Claim\n      Smith claims that we should remand the mineral interest portion of the case\nbecause the trial court has not disposed of the issue even though the judgment is\nfinal for purposes of appeal. Smith claimed that she was entitled to have her\n                                          4\n\fmineral title quieted as to the balance of her property that remained after the 85.64-\nacre conveyance.\n        A judgment might be final for purposes of appeal and yet not dispose of all\nthe issues in the case. See In re Daredia, 317 S.W.3d 247, 248–49 (Tex. 2010);\nLehmann v. Har-Con Corp., 39 S.W.3d 191, 206 (Tex. 2001). That is the case\nhere.\n        First, we note that the two motions for summary judgment are not competing\nmotions for summary judgment on the issue of the mineral interest. If that were\nthe case, we could simply review both and enter the judgment that the trial court\nshould have entered. Tex. Workers’ Comp. Comm’n v. Patient Advocates of Tex.,\n136 S.W.3d 643, 648 (Tex. 2004); Givens v. Ward, 272 S.W.3d 63, 67 (Tex.\nApp.—Waco 2008, no pet.). If we were to say that the trial court denied Smith’s\nmotion for summary judgment as it pertained to her mineral interest, then it could\nhave done so only because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the\nmineral interest claim or because the issue had been established against her as a\nmatter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). If the trial court had found that a genuine\nissue of material fact existed, then it could not have entered summary judgment.\nId. Furthermore, the summary judgment evidence does not show that the issue was\nestablished against her as a matter of law. Consequently, the trial court did not\ndispose of the mineral issue. We agree with Smith that we should remand the\nmineral interest issue as it pertains to her approximately 281.34-acre tract (that\nwhich remained after she conveyed the 85.64-acre tract to Appellees) so that the\ntrial court might dispose of the issue.2 We sustain Issue One insofar as Smith\nasserts that the trial court did not dispose of the mineral interest claim.\n\n\n        2\n        We think that it is clear from pages two and three of Smith’s response to Appellees’ motion for\nsummary judgment that she is not claiming any mineral ownership in the 85.64 acres she conveyed to\nAppellees.\n                                                  5\n\f                                       Attorneys’ Fees\n      In her second issue, Smith first takes the position that the trial court abused\nits discretion when it awarded trial court attorneys’ fees to Appellees because they\nsought a declaratory judgment as a vehicle to obtain attorneys’ fees in a case that\nwas actually one in trespass to try title. As to appellate attorneys’ fees, Smith also\nargues that not only is there no summary judgment evidence that those fees were\nnecessary, but also there is no evidence that they were reasonable. She also takes\nissue with the fact that the appellate attorneys’ fees were not conditioned upon her\nsuccess on appeal.\n      Attorney’s fees are not recoverable in trespass-to-try-title actions or suits to\nquiet title. Florey v. Estate of McConnell, 212 S.W.3d 439, 448 (Tex. App.—\nAustin 2006, no pet.); Roberson v. City of Austin, 157 S.W.3d 130, 135 (Tex.\nApp.—Austin 2005, pet. denied).\n      Trespass to try title is statutory and has specific pleading requirements. TEX.\nPROP. CODE ANN. § 22.001 (West 2000); TEX. R. CIV. P. 783. A suit to quiet title\nis an equitable action. Katz v. Rodriguez, 563 S.W.2d 627, 629 (Tex. Civ. App.—\nCorpus Christi 1977, writ ref’d n.r.e.). A plaintiff in a suit to quiet title must prove\nand recover on the strength of his own title, not the weakness of his adversary’s\ntitle. Alkas v. United Sav. Ass’n of Tex., Inc., 672 S.W.2d 852, 857 (Tex. App.—\nCorpus Christi 1984, writ ref’d n.r.e). A plaintiff in a trespass-to-try-title suit also\nmust rely upon the strength of his own title, not upon the weakness of the\ndefendant’s. Hunt v. Heaton, 643 S.W.2d 677, 679 (Tex. 1982).\n      We have examined the pleadings and the summary judgment evidence in\nthis case, and it is clear to us that neither the pleadings nor the proof fit within the\nparameters of that necessary to plead and prove either a trespass-to-try-title claim\nor a suit to quiet title. Furthermore, trespass-to-try-title actions involve the right to\ncurrent possession of the property; an easement is a nonpossessory interest in\n                                           6\n\fproperty. See Martin v. Amerman, 133 S.W.3d 262, 265–67 (Tex. 2004) (fence\nowner must sue under trespass to try title, not declaratory relief, on torn-down\nfence claim), superseded in part by statute, TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN.\n§ 37.004(c) (West 2008) (declaratory judgment act is applicable when sole issue is\nboundary-line dispute); Marcus Cable Assocs., L.P. v. Krohn, 90 S.W.3d 697,\n701–02 (Tex. 2002) (electric line easement on private land not an easement for\ncable television lines). The claims surrounding the water pipeline easement are not\ntrespass-to-try-title claims and do not constitute a suit to quiet title but, rather, are\nthe proper subject of Appellees’ declaratory judgment action.\n        Under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, the court “may award . . .\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.” TEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.009 (West 2008). We review a trial court’s\ndecision to award attorney’s fees under the UDJA for an abuse of discretion.\nRidge Oil Co. v. Guinn Invs., Inc., 148 S.W.3d 143, 163 (Tex. 2004) (citing\nBocquet v. Herring, 972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998)). We employ a hybrid analysis\nin which the “reasonable and necessary” requirements are questions of fact\ndetermined by the factfinder but the “equitable and just” requirements are\nquestions of law for the court. Id. at 161. The party seeking to recover attorney’s\nfees bears the burden of proof. Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1,\n10 (Tex. 1991). Based upon the summary judgment record in this case, we cannot\nsay that the trial court abused its discretion when it awarded trial court attorneys’\nfees.\n        As to the amount of the attorneys’ fees, the summary judgment proof\ncontained an affidavit by the trial attorney in which he gave his qualifications and\nexperience, reviewed the case, and opined that the trial court attorneys’ fees of\n$44,100 were reasonable and necessary in this case. The attorney did not segregate\nthose fees into amounts that were recoverable and amounts that were not.\n                                           7\n\fHowever, Smith did not object to that failure in the trial court, nor does she raise it\nhere; therefore, we need not further discuss it. See Green Int’l, Inc. v. Solis, 951\nS.W.2d 384, 389 (Tex. 1997).\n      Smith is correct in her argument that there is no summary judgment\nevidence that Appellees’ appellate attorneys’ fees are either reasonable or\nnecessary. There must be evidence to support an award of appellate attorney’s\nfees. Gilbert v. City of El Paso, 327 S.W.3d 332, 337–38 (Tex. App.—El Paso\n2010, no pet.). Further, appellate attorney’s fees must be conditioned on success in\nthe appeal. Id. Smith’s second issue on appeal is overruled insofar as it concerns\ntrial court attorneys’ fees, but the issue is sustained as to the award of appellate\nattorneys’ fees.\n                               The Pipeline Easement\n      Where a summary judgment does not specify the grounds on which it is\nbased, a reviewing court will uphold the order on any ground asserted by the\nmovant that is supported by the evidence. See Rogers v. Ricane Enters., Inc., 772\nS.W.2d 76, 79 (Tex. 1989). In those cases where a motion for summary judgment\nwas filed in which specific grounds were asserted, summary judgment cannot be\nupheld on grounds that were not asserted in the motion, even though the evidence\nsupports the unasserted grounds. McConnell v. Southside Indep. Sch. Dist., 858\nS.W.2d 337, 342 (Tex. 1993). Where, as here, the summary judgment specifies the\ngrounds on which the trial court based the summary judgment, we must limit our\nreview to those grounds. Cox v. Upjohn Co., 913 S.W.2d 225, 228 (Tex. App.—\nDallas 1995, no writ.).      In this case, the trial court specifically limited its\ndeclaration by attributing the existence of the easement to one acquired by\nprescription.\n      As part of her summary judgment proof in her response to Appellees’\nmotion for summary judgment—which also contained her own motion for\n                                          8\n\fsummary judgment—Smith attached her affidavit. In that affidavit, she stated that\nthe pipeline easement had been abandoned because of nonuse.          There is no\nsummary judgment proof by which the actual existence of the easement is\nchallenged. Pleadings do not constitute summary judgment proof. Clear Creek\nBasin Auth., 589 S.W.2d at 678. Abandonment is in the nature of an affirmative\ndefense because the party urging it implicitly confesses the existence of the\neasement. San Jacinto Sand Co. v. Sw. Bell Tel. Co., 426 S.W.2d 338, 344 (Tex.\nCiv. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1968, writ ref’d n.r.e.). In the posture of this\ncase, as the movant on this issue, the burden was upon Smith to raise a genuine\nissue of material fact regarding the affirmative defense of abandonment. Id.; see\nalso Garza v. Williams Bros. Constr. Co., 879 S.W.2d 290, 294–95 (Tex. App.—\nHouston [14th Dist.] 1994, no writ).\n      An abandonment does not occur unless there is an intent to abandon.\nMilligan v. Niebuhr, 990 S.W.2d 823, 826 (Tex. App.—Austin 1999, no pet.)\n(citing Dallas Cnty. v. Miller, 166 S.W.2d 922, 924 (Tex. 1942)). Nonuse alone\ndoes not result in abandonment of an easement; rather, the “circumstances must\ndisclose some definite act showing an intention to abandon.” Id. (quoting Miller,\n166 S.W.2d at 924). Here, Smith argued that the easement had been abandoned.\nBecause mere nonuse is the only summary judgment evidence of record, and\nbecause nonuse is insufficient to show abandonment of an easement, and because\nthere is no other summary judgment evidence that there had been an abandonment,\nthe trial court did not err when it declared that Appellees held the easement.\nSmith’s third issue on appeal is overruled.\n                                   This Court’s Ruling\n      Because the trial court has not disposed of Smith’s claim to the mineral\ninterest under the approximately 281.34-acre tract that remained after she\nconveyed the 85.64-acre tract, that claim is remanded to the trial court. Further,\n                                          9\n\fthe trial court’s judgment is modified to delete the award of appellate attorneys’\nfees. Otherwise, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n\n\n\n\n                                              MIKE WILLSON\n                                              JUSTICE\n\n\nApril 30, 2013\nPanel consists of: Wright, C.J.,\nMcCall, J., and Willson, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f",

She filed this lawsuit,\nand in her live pleading, under the heading of “Trespass to Try Title,” Smith\nsought to have Killion Partners, Ltd. “execute all necessary and proper instruments\n\n        1\n          In the notice of appeal, Appellees are listed as Richard Lee Killion, Killion Investments, Inc.,\nand Killion Partners, LP. Those names are used interchangeably throughout the record, and it is\nsometimes difficult to tell to whom or to what entity reference is being made. Additionally, Killion\nPartners, LP is sometimes referred to as Killion Partners, Ltd., and sometimes as Killion Partners. We\nwill refer to all of these parties as “Appellees.” Some portions of the final judgment refer only to Richard\nLee Killion, not to the Killion entities; however, we have not been asked to address that.\n                                                     2\n\fto quiet title to the M. Smith Ranch surface and minerals.” She also maintained\nthat, if a water pipeline easement had existed across her property, it had been\nabandoned.\n      Appellees answered Smith’s lawsuit and filed a counterclaim. Among other\nthings, in their second amended original answer, Appellees alleged that, under\nvarious legal theories, Smith was estopped from making her non-mineral interest\nclaims. Appellees also alleged that they were entitled to an easement by estoppel,\nan easement by implication, or an easement by prescription. In their counterclaim,\nAppellees additionally sought a declaratory judgment concerning “the rights under\nthe deed, contract and conveyance from Smith to Killion selling and conveying all\nher right title and interest in and to the real property describe [sic] in the deed\nbetween the parties Dated March 13, 2003.” Appellees sought eight specific\ndeclarations from the trial court.\n      Appellees filed a motion for summary judgment. Smith responded to the\nmotion for summary judgment, and as a part of that response, she filed her own\nmotion for summary judgment. Both of the motions were traditional ones. See\nTEX. R. CIV. P. 166a.       After a hearing on Appellees’ motion for summary\njudgment, the trial court entered judgment for Appellees that Richard Lee Killion\nhad an easement by prescription across Smith’s land to access certain water rights,\nthat Smith pay to Appellees $44,100 for attorneys’ fees, and that Smith pay an\nadditional $20,000 if the case was appealed to the court of appeals and another\n$15,000 if appealed to the Texas Supreme Court. The trial court also declared that\nRichard Lee Killion owned the water rights pertaining to the 85.64-acre tract he\nbought from Smith and that “Defendant/CounterPlaintiff” did not trespass on\nSmith’s property. These latter two declarations are not attacked in this appeal.\n      Smith does, however, present us with three issues on appeal. In her first\nissue, Smith argues that the trial court did not address her claim to remove the\n                                         3\n\fcloud on her mineral interest under the tract of land that remained after the sale of\nthe 85.64-acre tract to Appellees. In her second issue, Smith takes the position that\nthe trial court abused its discretion when it awarded attorneys’ fees for two\nreasons: (1) the declaratory judgment counterclaim was used solely as a vehicle to\nobtain attorneys’ fees and (2) there was no evidence raised in the trial court that the\nappellate attorneys’ fees were reasonable and necessary. Lastly, in her third issue,\nSmith urges us to find that the trial court erred when it granted summary judgment\non the pipeline easement issue because her “affidavit showed that the water\neasement had been abandoned by its non-use for more than 30 years.” We will\nbear in mind that these are the only three issues that we have been asked to\naddress.\n                       Standard of Review for Summary Judgments\n      We will apply the well-recognized standards of review for summary\njudgments.

If we were to say that the trial court denied Smith’s\nmotion for summary judgment as it pertained to her mineral interest, then it could\nhave done so only because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to the\nmineral interest claim or because the issue had been established against her as a\nmatter of law. TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c). If the trial court had found that a genuine\nissue of material fact existed, then it could not have entered summary judgment.\nId. Furthermore, the summary judgment evidence does not show that the issue was\nestablished against her as a matter of law. Consequently, the trial court did not\ndispose of the mineral issue. We agree with Smith that we should remand the\nmineral interest issue as it pertains to her approximately 281.34-acre tract (that\nwhich remained after she conveyed the 85.64-acre tract to Appellees) so that the\ntrial court might dispose of the issue.2 We sustain Issue One insofar as Smith\nasserts that the trial court did not dispose of the mineral interest claim.\n\n\n        2\n        We think that it is clear from pages two and three of Smith’s response to Appellees’ motion for\nsummary judgment that she is not claiming any mineral ownership in the 85.64 acres she conveyed to\nAppellees.\n                                                  5\n\f                                       Attorneys’ Fees\n      In her second issue, Smith first takes the position that the trial court abused\nits discretion when it awarded trial court attorneys’ fees to Appellees because they\nsought a declaratory judgment as a vehicle to obtain attorneys’ fees in a case that\nwas actually one in trespass to try title. As to appellate attorneys’ fees, Smith also\nargues that not only is there no summary judgment evidence that those fees were\nnecessary, but also there is no evidence that they were reasonable. She also takes\nissue with the fact that the appellate attorneys’ fees were not conditioned upon her\nsuccess on appeal.\n      Attorney’s fees are not recoverable in trespass-to-try-title actions or suits to\nquiet title.
