We grant the motion\n      for rehearing, withdraw our opinion and judgment of June 14, 2016, and issue this\n      opinion and a new judgment in their stead. Accordingly, we dismiss the motion for\n\f      Calhoun/Holiday Place, Inc., Artisan/American Corp., Vernon Young, and\n\nElizabeth Young (appellants) appeal from a final judgment, rendered upon trial to\n\nthe jury and to the bench, in favor of appellee, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.,\n\nsuccessor-by-merger to Wachovia Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo). In\n\nthree issues, appellants argue that (1) the trial court erred by admitting evidence of\n\nWells Fargo’s sale of the property for $675,000 in May 2013; (2) there is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that the property had a\n\nfair market value of $800,000 on the foreclosure date; and (3) the trial court erred\n\nby awarding attorney’s fees to Wells Fargo. We affirm.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      Vernon Young and his wife Elizabeth formed Calhoun/Holiday Place, Inc.\n\n(Calhoun) for the purpose of developing a gated, 120-unit residential subdivision in\n\nHouston known as Holiday Place. Calhoun purchased an undeveloped 6.371 acre\n\ntract of land located in central Houston for $950,000 (the Property) and borrowed\n\n$1,590,000 from Wells Fargo’s predecessor in interest to develop the project for\n\ndetached townhomes in 2006 (the Note). The Note was secured by a deed of trust on\n\nthe Property and guaranteed by Artisan/American Corp. and the Youngs.\n\n\n\n\n      en banc reconsideration as moot. See, e.g., Brookshire Bros. v. Smith, 176 S.W.3d\n      30, 41 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied).\n\n                                          2\n\f      The infrastructure was in place and the Property’s lots were ready for home\n\nconstruction by the fall of 2008. Unfortunately, environmental contamination on an\n\nadjacent industrial property owned by CES Environmental Services thwarted\n\nconstruction plans on the Property for several years. Local, state, and federal actions\n\nultimately led to the closing of CES and its bankruptcy in 2010. Appellants filed a\n\nlawsuit against CES in 2009 to recover damages caused by this delay in the\n\ndevelopment of the project. Vernon Young testified that he would have been able to\n\nbegin marketing and constructing townhomes on the Property in mid to late 2011,\n\nexcept for the fact that Wells Fargo decided to proceed with the foreclosure in\n\nSeptember 2011.\n\n      On September 22, 2011, Wells Fargo sued Calhoun for breach of the Note and\n\nArtisan/American and the Youngs for breach of their guaranty agreements. Wells\n\nFargo foreclosed on November 1, 2011, and purchased the Property with a credit bid\n\nof $532,570 at the foreclosure sale, leaving a deficiency of $1,415,652. Wells Fargo\n\nlater amended its petition and sought to recover on this deficiency amount. Wells\n\nFargo eventually sold the Property to a neighboring charter school for $675,000 in\n\nMay 2013, approximately eighteen months after the foreclosure sale.\n\n      Appellants answered and filed three counterclaims seeking a declaratory\n\njudgment with respect to Wells Fargo’s interest in the proceeds of appellants’ lawsuit\n\nagainst CES and a valuation of the Property pursuant to the Texas Property Code,\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fand asserting a claim for wrongful foreclosure with respect to any recovery in the\n\nCES lawsuit. The appellants’ declaratory judgment and wrongful foreclosure claims\n\nwere resolved in September 2012,2 and the only issue remaining to be tried was the\n\nfair market value of the Property on the date of the foreclosure sale.\n\n      Before trial, the parties stipulated that:\n\n          (1) the Note matured on January 23, 2009, and appellants failed to pay the\n              outstanding amounts due and owing under the Note;\n          (2) Wells Fargo foreclosed on the Property and sold it at auction on\n              November 1, 2011;\n          (3) Wells Fargo purchased the Property at the foreclosure sale for a credit\n              bid of $542,570; and\n          (4) appellants owed Wells Fargo $1,948,187.72 on November 1, 2011,\n              including all applicable interest and fees.\n\n      Three witnesses testified about the Property’s fair market value on November\n\n1, 2011: Wells Fargo’s appraiser, Phillip Barletta; appellants’ appraiser, William\n\nForrest; and Vernon Young.\n\n      Vernon Young testified that the Property had a fair market value of\n\n$2,400,000 on November 1, 2011. Young based his valuation on his experience as a\n\nhomebuilder, and specifically, what he thought the townhomes could sell for in the\n\nfuture, if they were built at all, and “what it would have cost” to develop the lots in\n\nNovember 2011. Appellants’ appraiser, Forrest, prepared a 2012 report in which he\n\n\n\n2\n      The CES lawsuit was settled, and the net proceeds of the suit, $629,786.44, were\n      deposited in the registry of the court subject to Wells Fargo’s security interest.\n\n                                            4\n\fassessed the Property’s fair market value to be $1.71 million as of the foreclosure\n\ndate, based on his analyses of comparable sales of homes and residential lots. Wells\n\nFargo’s appraiser, Barletta, prepared three reports in which he assessed the\n\nProperty’s fair market value to be $550,000 as of August 20, 2010, $590,000 as of\n\nAugust 26, 2011, and $650,000 as of May 2013. Barletta also prepared an October\n\n2013 report critiquing Forrest’s 2012 appraisal. Based on his 2011 and 2013\n\nappraisals, Barletta opined at trial that the fair market value of the Property on\n\nNovember 1, 2011 was between $590,000 and $650,000.\n\n      Forrest’s and Barletta’s appraisals of the Property share several similarities.\n\nAlthough Forrest and Barletta differed in their choice of comparable sales and their\n\nadjustments to those sales, their valuations of the individual lots was relatively\n\nclose—Barletta valued the lots at $14,500 each and Forrest valued them at $20,800\n\neach. Both experts also recognized that because lots in a subdivision sell over an\n\nextended period of time, they had to project the time it would take to sell all of the\n\nlots, i.e., the absorption rate, and then discount those future sales to a present value,\n\nas of November 1, 2011. The primary difference between the two appraisals is that\n\nBarletta projected that it would take several years longer to sell all of the lots than\n\nForrest. In addition to using a longer absorption rate, Barletta also used a higher\n\ndiscount rate because he perceived the Property’s future development to be riskier\n\nthan Forrest.\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      In his October 2013 report, Barletta criticized Forrest’s appraisal on a number\n\nof grounds. Specifically, Barletta took issue with Forrest’s comparison of the\n\nProperty’s small townhome lots with the sale of single-family homes in residential\n\nsubdivisions. According to Barletta, not only did the single-family homes used by\n\nForrest have lot sizes that were two to three-and-one-half times larger than the\n\nProperty’s lots, but the pool of buyers for single–family residences is traditionally\n\nmuch greater than the pool of buyers for townhomes. Barletta also noted that\n\nalthough Forrest “concede[d] that the [Property] is ‘stigmatized’” in his report and\n\nacknowledged that it usually takes ten years before stigmatized properties reclaim\n\ntheir previous values, Forrest “never consider[d] such ‘stigma’ in [his] actual\n\nanalyses” or made any adjustments to his aggressive absorption projections based\n\non stigma.\n\n      On cross-examination, Forrest testified that he based his appraisal of $1.7\n\nmillion on his assumption that, as of November 1, 2011, the Property was clear of\n\nany environmental contamination and was no longer stigmatized by CES’s\n\nenvironmental problems. He further testified that although it takes approximately\n\nten years before a property regains its pre-stigma value, the “stigmatism is usually\n\nover [after] three to four years and then [the] value starts continuing to rise.” Forrest\n\nalso acknowledged that although it is important to use sales data comparable to the\n\nsubject property when performing an appraisal, none of the sales he used to calculate\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fthe Property’s value were for similarly sized townhome lots. Forrest testified that his\n\nappraisal “did not take into consideration that [the Property] is adjacent to a property\n\nthat was previously contaminated.” He also testified that he did not know if any of\n\nthe residential subdivisions he included in his analysis were adjacent to an industrial\n\nproperty or a recently contaminated property.\n\n      Barletta’s 2010 and 2011 appraisals, Forrest’s 2012 appraisal, and Barletta’s\n\nreport criticizing Forrest’s appraisal were all admitted into evidence without\n\nobjection. Although appellants objected to Barletta’s 2013 appraisal based on the\n\nreport’s discussion of the May 2013 sale, the trial court overruled the objection.\n\n      At the conclusion of the testimony, the jury was asked to answer one question:\n\n“What was the Fair Market Value of the Property as of November 1, 2011?” “Market\n\nValue” was given its usual definition, without reference to the types of competent\n\nevidence described in the Texas Property Code. The trial court instructed the jury as\n\nfollows:\n\n      You are instructed that ‘Fair Market Value’ is the price the property\n      will bring when offered for sale by one who desires to sell, but is not\n      obligated to sell, and is bought by one who desires to buy, but is under\n      no necessity of buying.\n\nNovember 1, 2011 is the date Wells Fargo foreclosed on the Property. The jury\n\nanswered: $800,000.\n\n      The issue of attorney’s fees was subsequently tried to the bench. After the\n\nbench trial, the trial court signed a final judgment awarding Wells Fargo\n\n\n                                           7\n\f$1,148,187.72, which is the amount of debt stipulated to by the parties, minus the\n\n$800,000 fair market value of Property as found by the jury, plus $249,809.73 in\n\nprejudgment interest and post-judgment interest. The trial court also awarded Wells\n\nFargo $180,163.50 in attorney’s fees, $32,493.44 in expenses, and an additional\n\n$40,000 in conditional appellate attorney’s fees.\n\n      This appeal followed.\n\n                           Property Code Section 51.003\n\n      Property Code section 51.003 provides in part as follows:\n\n       (b) Any person against whom such a recovery is sought by motion may\n      request that the court in which the action is pending determine the fair\n      market value of the real property as of the date of the foreclosure sale.\n      The fair market value shall be determined by the finder of fact after the\n      introduction by the parties of competent evidence of the value.\n      Competent evidence of value may include, but is not limited to, the\n      following: (1) expert opinion testimony; (2) comparable sales; (3)\n      anticipated marketing time and holding costs; (4) cost of sale; and (5)\n      the necessity and amount of any discount to be applied to the future\n      sales price or the cashflow generated by the property to arrive at a\n      current fair market value.\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 51.003(b) (West 2014).\n\n                               Admission of Evidence\n\n      In their first issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by admitting\n\nreferences to the sales price of Wells Fargo’s post-foreclosure sale in Barletta’s trial\n\ntestimony and his July 19, 2013 appraisal report. Appellants argue that the evidence\n\nshould not have been admitted because the sale was not made under ordinary market\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fconditions. Specifically, appellants contend that the Property was not marketed for\n\nits highest and best use as a developed subdivision, and instead, was sold to a\n\nnon-profit school for expansion of its facilities.\n\n      Appellants filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude all evidence of the\n\npost-foreclosure sale, arguing that the evidence was inadmissible because there was\n\nno evidence showing the circumstances of the sale or how the Property was\n\nmarketed, and there was no evidence regarding the comparability of market\n\nconditions. See Village Place, Ltd. v. VP Shopping, LLC, 404 S.W.3d 115, 134 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.) (holding subsequent sale of property\n\nordinarily is not evidence of value on earlier date, absent evidence that later sale was\n\nmade under similar market conditions). The trial court explained that it was denying\n\nthe motion in limine because Wells Fargo’s post-foreclosure sales price was the type\n\nof evidence that appraisal experts relied upon when forming an opinion on the fair\n\nmarket value of a given property. Appellants made the same objection to the\n\nadmission of Barletta’s May 2013 appraisal that referred to the post-foreclosure sale.\n\nThe trial court overruled the objection and admitted the appraisal.\n\n      If the price at which real property is sold at a foreclosure sale is less than the\n\nunpaid balance of the indebtedness secured by the property, resulting in a deficiency,\n\nan action may be brought to recover the deficiency. See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN.\n\n§ 51.003(a) (West 2014). Any person sued for recovery of such a deficiency may\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\fask the court to determine the property’s fair market value as of the foreclosure-sale\n\ndate and if the property’s fair market value is greater than the sale price, the person\n\nbeing sued is entitled to an offset. See id. § 51.003(b), (c) (West 2014). Section\n\n51.003(b) states that the property’s fair market value shall be determined by the\n\nfactfinder after the parties introduce competent evidence of value. Id. § 51.003(b).\n\n       The Texas Supreme Court recently held that section 51.003(b) contemplates\n\nthe use of a post-foreclosure sales price as competent evidence of fair market value.\n\nSee PlainsCapital Bank v. Martin, 459 S.W.3d 550, 556 (Tex. 2015). Appellants\n\nargue that the supreme court’s opinion in PlainsCapital should not be applied\n\nretroactively to “justify [the trial court’s] ruling after the fact.” It is well established\n\nthat a Texas Supreme Court decision “operates retroactively unless [the] Court\n\nexercises its discretion to modify that application.” Bowen v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co.,\n\n837 S.W.2d 99, 100 (Tex. 1992). Because the Court did not indicate that its holding\n\nin PlainsCapital was intended only to operate prospectively, we will apply it\n\nretroactively.3\n\n\n\n\n3\n       Appellants also contend that we should disregard the Texas Supreme Court’s\n       opinion in PlainsCapital for purposes of our analysis because the exception to the\n       common definition of “fair market value” created in that opinion was not raised in\n       the trial court, and, instead, the jury was instructed to determine the Property’s fair\n       market value based on the commonly understood definition. Neither point, however,\n       is relevant to the question presented by appellants’ first issue—whether the trial\n       court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of the post-foreclosure sale.\n\n                                             10\n\f      Appellants also contend that PlainsCapital’s exception to the common\n\ndefinition of “fair market value” is inapplicable here because the Property was not\n\nmarketed for its highest or best use. PlainsCapital expressly declined to hold that\n\n“the future sales price” requires a “showing of comparable market conditions\n\nbetween the foreclosure sale and the future sale” because that “would be adding\n\nwords to § 51.003.” PlainsCapital, 459 S.W.3d at 556. In reaching its decision, the\n\ncourt held that evidence of a future sales price “will support a fair market value\n\nfinding under [Property Code section 51.003] even though that type of evidence\n\nmight not otherwise be competent in the common or historical fair market value\n\nconstruct.” Id. at 556–57. Accordingly, evidence of a property’s post-foreclosure\n\nsales price is admissible for purposes of section 51.003, regardless of the\n\ncircumstances of the sale. See id.\n\n      In light of the Supreme Court’s decision in PlainsCapital, we cannot say that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion when it admitted evidence of the post-foreclosure\n\nsale. See id. at 556; see generally Barnhart v. Morales, 459 S.W.3d 733, 742 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2015, no pet.) (holding appellate court can uphold\n\nevidentiary ruling on any legitimate basis, even if that basis was not raised in trial\n\ncourt).\n\n      We overrule appellants’ first issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f                           Legal and Factual Sufficiency\n\n      In their second issue, appellants argue that the evidence is legally and factually\n\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that the Property had a fair market value of\n\n$800,000 on the date of the foreclosure sale. A section 51.003 offset operates as an\n\naffirmative defense to a deficiency claim, and therefore, appellants bore the burden\n\nof proof on this issue. See PlainsCapital, 459 S.W.3d at 557.\n\nA.    Standard of Review\n\n      A party attacking the legal sufficiency of an adverse finding on an issue on\n\nwhich that party bears the burden of proof must demonstrate on appeal that the\n\nevidence establishes, as a matter of law, all vital facts in support of the issue, and it\n\nmay prevail on appeal only if no evidence supports the adverse finding and the\n\ncontrary position is conclusively established. See PlainsCapital, 459 S.W.3d at 557;\n\nDow Chem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex. 2001); see also City of Keller\n\nv. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 815–16 (Tex. 2005) (explaining nature of conclusive\n\nevidence). We consider all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict,\n\nand indulge every reasonable inference that would support it. City of Keller, 168\n\nS.W.3d at 822. In determining whether legally sufficient evidence supports the\n\nfinding under review, we consider evidence favorable to the finding, if a reasonable\n\nfact finder could consider it, and disregard evidence contrary to the finding, unless\n\na reasonable fact finder could not disregard it. Id. at 827.\n\n\n\n                                           12\n\f      When a party attacks the factual sufficiency of an adverse finding on an issue\n\non which he has the burden of proof, he “must demonstrate on appeal that the adverse\n\nfinding is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence.” Dow Chem.\n\nCo., 46 S.W.3d at 242. In reviewing a factual sufficiency challenge, we consider all\n\nof the evidence and set aside a verdict only if the evidence is so weak that the finding\n\nis clearly wrong and unjust. Id.\n\n      The jury is the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of\n\ntheir testimony. City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819. The jury may believe one witness\n\nand disbelieve another as it resolves inconsistencies in the testimony. Id. at 819–20.\n\nB.    Analysis\n\n      Appellants argue that the only evidence supporting the jury’s finding that the\n\nProperty had a fair market value of $800,000 on the date of foreclosure is Wells\n\nFargo’s post-foreclosure sale of the Property, which is inadmissible, and Barletta’s\n\nappraisals valuing the Property between $590,000 and $650,000, which are\n\ninsufficient to support a judgment.4\n\n\n\n\n4\n      Wells Fargo responds that even if this evidence is excluded, there is sufficient\n      evidence to support the jury’s finding of fair market value. We agree. Accordingly,\n      we will not consider Barletta’s appraisals of the Property, or his testimony valuing\n      the Property between $590,000 and $650,000, as competent evidence of the\n      Property’s fair market value for purpose of our sufficiency analysis.\n\n\n                                           13\n\f      At trial, appellants presented evidence that the Property had a fair market\n\nvalue of between $1.71 million and $2.4 million on November 1, 2011.5 Wells Fargo\n\nintroduced Barletta’s October 2013 report criticizing Forrest’s appraisal into\n\nevidence, and presented testimony that the Property was sold in May 2013 for\n\n$675,000. The testimony and evidence before the jury was uniform in showing that\n\nsome stigma had attached to the Property because of prior environmental\n\ncontamination problems on the adjacent tract. There was extensive testimony\n\nexplaining the different discounts to be applied to the value of the Property as a result\n\nof this stigma.\n\n      In light of our resolution of appellants’ first issue, we conclude that evidence\n\nof the May 2013 sale is “competent evidence” of the Property’s fair market value on\n\nNovember 1, 2011, the date of foreclosure. See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 51.003(b);\n\nPlainsCapital, 459 S.W.3d at 556–57. Thus, the jury’s finding of $800,000 was\n\nwithin the range of fair market values permitted by the evidence ($675,000 to\n\n$2,400,000). As the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of\n\ntheir testimony, it was within the jury’s province to credit Forrest’s appraisal of\n\n$1,710,000, but then reduce that value to $800,000 in light of the factors Barletta\n\n\n\n\n5\n      Although Wells Fargo argues that Vernon Young’s testimony is incompetent\n      evidence of the Property’s fair market value, it is not necessary for the Court to\n      address this issue in order to dispose of the appeal.\n\n\n                                           14\n\fraised in his October 2013 report, or points Forrest testified to on cross-examination.\n\nSee City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819\n\n      After considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, and\n\nindulging every reasonable inference that would support it, we conclude that there\n\nis legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that the Property had a fair\n\nmarket value of $800,000 on November 1, 2011. See PlainsCapital, 459 S.W.3d at\n\n557; see also Waterways on Intercoastal, Ltd. v. State, 283 S.W.3d 36, 46–47 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.) (holding evidence legally and factually\n\nsufficient to support jury’s fair market value finding because finding was within\n\nrange of evidence presented at trial). In light of the entire record, we cannot say that\n\nthe finding is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. See\n\nPlainsCapital, 459 S.W.3d at 557; see also Preston Reserve, L.L.C. v. Compass\n\nBank, 373 S.W.3d 652, 666 (Tex.

Appellants contend that the attorney’s fee award\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fshould be reversed because Property Code sections 51.003(b) and 51.005(b) do not\n\nauthorize an award of attorney’s fees, Wells Fargo was not a “prevailing party,” and\n\nWells Fargo failed to segregate its fees between claims for which attorney’s fees are\n\nrecoverable and claims for which they are not. Appellants also argue in the\n\nalternative that, even if the trial court was correct in awarding Wells Fargo some\n\namount of attorney’s fees, the court, nevertheless, erred by failing to take into\n\naccount the extent to which each party prevailed on the valuation issue and reducing\n\nthe amount of Wells Fargo’s fee award accordingly.\n\nA.    Standard of Review and Applicable Law\n\n      We review a trial court’s decision to award attorney’s fees for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Ridge Oil Co., Inc. v. Guinn Invs., Inc., 148 S.W.3d 143, 163 (Tex. 2004).\n\nTo recover attorney’s fees under Civil Practice and Remedies Code section 38.001,\n\na party must prevail on a cause of action for which attorney’s fees are recoverable\n\nand recover damages. See Intercontinental Grp. P’ship v. KB Home Lone Star L.P.,\n\n295 S.W.3d 650, 653 (Tex. 2009); see also Green Int’l, Inc. v.

In such\n\ncases, the language of the contract, not the statute, governs. See id.\n\n      Generally, the party seeking attorney’s fees must segregate its fees between\n\nclaims for which attorney’s fees are recoverable and claims for which they are not.\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fTony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v.

Analysis\n\n      Wells Fargo pleaded for attorney’s fees under Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode section 38.001 and the contractual attorney’s fee provisions in the Note and\n\nguaranty agreement. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. 38.001 (West 2014).\n\n      The Note’s attorney’s fees provision states:\n\n      If any holder of this note retains an attorney in connection with any\n      default or to collect, enforce or defend this note or any of the Loan\n      Documents in any lawsuit or in any probate, reorganization, bankruptcy\n      or other proceeding, or if Maker sues any holder in connection with this\n      note or any of the Loan Documents and does not prevail, then Maker\n      agrees to pay to each such holder, in addition to principal and interest,\n      all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such holder in trying to\n      collect this note or in any such proceeding, including reasonable\n      attorney’s fees.\n\nThus, the Note obligates appellants to pay Wells Fargo “all reasonable costs and\n\nexpenses incurred . . . in any such proceeding, including reasonable attorney’s fees,”\n\nif (1) Wells Fargo retains an attorney to collect on or enforce the Note or any of the\n\nguarantees6 in any lawsuit or other proceeding; or (2) appellants sue Wells Fargo “in\n\nconnection with this note or any of the Loan Documents and does not prevail.” The\n\ncontract does not condition Wells Fargo’s recovery of costs, expenses, and\n\nattorney’s fees on Wells Fargo being a prevailing party in the lawsuit. Accordingly,\n\nthe Note governs Wells Fargo’s right to recovery of attorney’s fees. See KB Home,\n\n\n\n\n6\n      The guaranty agreement is a “Loan Document.”\n\n\n                                         18\n\f295 S.W.3d at 653 (indicating when contract provision sets forth looser fee-recovery\n\nstandard than Chapter 38, contract language governs).7\n\n      This suit for breach of contract to recover the deficiency due on the Note is\n\nthe type of lawsuit contemplated by the fee-recovery provision. Furthermore, the\n\nNote’s fee-recovery provision entitles Wells Fargo to recover reasonable costs,\n\nexpenses, and attorney’s fees “incurred . . . in trying to collect this note or in any\n\nsuch proceeding.” This language is broad enough to encompass all of appellants’\n\ncounterclaims and affirmative defenses in the underlying lawsuit. Accordingly, there\n\nis no need to segregate the attorney’s fees in question. We hold that the Note’s\n\nunambiguous fee-recovery provision entitles Wells Fargo to recover all of its\n\nattorney’s fees incurred in the underlying lawsuit.\n\n      Alternatively, appellants argue that, even if the trial court was correct in\n\nawarding Wells Fargo some amount of attorney’s fees, the court, nevertheless, erred\n\nby failing to take into account the extent to which each party prevailed on the\n\nvaluation issue and reducing the amount of Wells Fargo’s fee award accordingly.\n\nSpecifically, appellants contend that “the amount involved” and “the results\n\nobtained” are key factors to be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of an\n\nattorney’s fee award. See Smith v. Patrick W.Y. Tam Trust, 296 S.W.3d 545, 548\n\n\n\n7\n      The guaranty agreement also contains a similarly broad fee and expense recovery\n      provision that is less restrictive than Chapter 38.\n\n\n                                         19\n\f(Tex. 2009). Appellants further contend that the trial court erred by ignoring the\n\nextent to which Wells Fargo did not succeed in its trial position because the court\n\nawarded Wells Fargo the full amount of its attorney’s fees, despite the fact that the\n\njury found that the fair market value of the property was greater than the value\n\nadvocated by Wells Fargo.\n\n      We review the amount of attorney’s fees awarded under a legal sufficiency\n\nstandard, viewing the evidence in a light that tends to support the disputed finding\n\nand disregarding evidence and inferences to the contrary. See EMC Mortg. Corp. v.\n\nDavis, 167 S.W.3d 406, 418 (Tex. App.—Austin 2005, pet. denied). “If more than a\n\nscintilla of evidence supports the challenged finding, the legal sufficiency challenge\n\nmust fail.” Id.\n\n      Although the “the amount involved and the results obtained” are relevant in\n\nassessing the reasonableness of a trial court’s determination of attorney’s fees, these\n\nare just two of several factors to be considered. Arthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry\n\nEquip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex. 1997). Other factors include the nature and\n\ndifficulty of the case, the time and labor spent, the legal skills and experience\n\nrequired, the attorney’s experience, reputation, and ability, and the fees customarily\n\ncharged in the area for similar legal services. See id. A trial court need not receive\n\nevidence on each Arthur Andersen factor and may “look at the entire record, the\n\nevidence presented on reasonableness, the amount in controversy, the common\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\fknowledge of the participants as lawyers and judges, and the relative success of the\n\nparties.” Jarvis v. Rocanville Corp., 298 S.W.3d 305, 318 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2009,\n\npet. denied); see Cole Chem. & Distrib., Inc. v. Gowing, 228 S.W.3d 684, 690 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, no pet.) (“To determine an appropriate fee award,\n\nthe trial judge is entitled to look at the entire record and to view the matter in light\n\nof the amount in controversy, the nature of the case, and his or her personal\n\nexperience as a lawyer and judge.”).\n\n      The record reflects that Wells Fargo bought the property at the foreclosure\n\nsale for $532,570, leaving a deficiency of $1,415,652 on the note. At trial, Wells\n\nFargo’s appraiser testified that the property was valued at between $590,000 and\n\n$650,000. Appellants’ expert testified that the property’s fair market value was $1.7\n\nmillion, and Young testified that the property was worth $2.4 million. The jury,\n\nhowever, disagreed with both sides and found that the property had a fair market\n\nvalue of $800,000. As a result of the jury’s finding, appellants’ offset against the\n\ndeficiency they owed to Wells Fargo on the note was greater than the offset that\n\nWells Fargo argued appellants were entitled to under the statute, but far less than the\n\noffset appellants were seeking.\n\n      Wells Fargo’s two attorney’s fees experts testified to some degree regarding\n\neach Arthur Andersen factor. In particular, one or both of the experts testified about\n\nthe time and labor spent on the case, the experience, reputation, and ability of each\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fof the attorneys and paralegals who were involved during the various stages of the\n\ncase, and the fees customarily charged in the area for similar legal services. With\n\nregard to “the amount involved and the results obtained,” one of Wells Fargo’s\n\nexperts testified that the company’s breach of contract claim was based on an\n\napproximately $1.5 million deficiency,8 and that if the jury had found that the\n\nproperty had a fair market value of $2.4 million, as Young testified, then Wells Fargo\n\nwould not have prevailed on its breach of contract claim at all because it would not\n\nhave had any damages.\n\n      Wells Fargo’s experts also testified that this was a complex case that involved\n\n“very complex UCC issues,” as well as matters relevant to commercial litigation and\n\nbankruptcy. Wells Fargo’s experts testified that that there were numerous issues that\n\nimpacted the fair market value of the property in this case, such as the environmental\n\ncontamination event on the adjacent CES property, and the fact that the foreclosure\n\noccurred during the Great Recession of 2008.\n\n      One expert opined that Wells Fargo’s fees were “reasonable and necessary”\n\n“given the complexity of the case, given the issues on not the only valuation of the\n\nproperty but given the issues surrounding . . . the CES litigation.”\n\n\n\n\n8\n      The parties stipulated that, at the time of trial, appellants owed $1,948,187.72 on the\n      note, which included all applicable interest and fees.\n\n\n                                            22\n\f      Wells Fargo’s second expert also testified that the amount of Wells Fargo’s\n\nattorney’s fees in this case was “influenced by the decisions [and] the tactics used\n\nby” appellants, such as appellants’ insistence on a jury trial, as opposed to a bench\n\ntrial. He further testified that appellants “chose, on numerous occasions, tactics that\n\ncaused [Wells Fargo] to have to expend additional attorney’s fees to move forward.\n\nFor example, although appellants eventually stipulated that Wells Fargo had a\n\nsecurity interest in the proceeds of appellants’ suit against CES, appellants initially\n\nchallenged Wells Fargo’s interest in the proceeds of the litigation and brought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim on that issue, which Wells Fargo was forced to defend\n\nagainst.\n\n      Based on the testimony of Wells Fargo’s experts, the trial court could have\n\ndecided that although Wells Fargo did not prevail at trial to the extent that it had\n\nhoped, $180,163.509 in attorney’s fees was, nevertheless, “reasonable and\n\nnecessary” in light of the expert’s testimony regarding the complexity of the case.\n\nSee Sibley v. RMA Partners, L.P./Sixth RMA Partners, L.P., 138 S.W.3d 455, 458-59\n\n(Tex. App.—Beaumont 2004, no pet.) (reasoning that trial court could have\n\nconsidered expert’s testimony that case was complicated and time consuming and\n\n\n\n9\n      Although Wells Fargo initially requested $204,343.14 in attorney’s fees, the\n      company reduced its request to $180,163.50 based on a mathematical error. The\n      trial court awarded Wells Fargo $180,163.50 in attorney’s fees, $32,493.44 in\n      expenses, plus contingent appellate attorney’s fees.\n\n\n                                          23\n\fupholding $82,748 attorney’s fee where client stood to recover approximately\n\n$43,000).\n\n      Accordingly, we further hold that there is sufficient evidence supporting the\n\namount of attorney’s fees awarded to Wells Fargo.\n\n      We overrule appellants’ third issue.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n      We affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Russell Lloyd\n                                              Justice\n\n\nPanel consists of Justices Massengale, Huddle, and Lloyd.\n\n\n\n\n                                        24\n\f",

In\n\nthree issues, appellants argue that (1) the trial court erred by admitting evidence of\n\nWells Fargo’s sale of the property for $675,000 in May 2013; (2) there is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that the property had a\n\nfair market value of $800,000 on the foreclosure date; and (3) the trial court erred\n\nby awarding attorney’s fees to Wells Fargo. We affirm.\n\n                                    Background\n\n      Vernon Young and his wife Elizabeth formed Calhoun/Holiday Place, Inc.\n\n(Calhoun) for the purpose of developing a gated, 120-unit residential subdivision in\n\nHouston known as Holiday Place. Calhoun purchased an undeveloped 6.371 acre\n\ntract of land located in central Houston for $950,000 (the Property) and borrowed\n\n$1,590,000 from Wells Fargo’s predecessor in interest to develop the project for\n\ndetached townhomes in 2006 (the Note). The Note was secured by a deed of trust on\n\nthe Property and guaranteed by Artisan/American Corp. and the Youngs.\n\n\n\n\n      en banc reconsideration as moot. See, e.g., Brookshire Bros. v.

Unfortunately, environmental contamination on an\n\nadjacent industrial property owned by CES Environmental Services thwarted\n\nconstruction plans on the Property for several years. Local, state, and federal actions\n\nultimately led to the closing of CES and its bankruptcy in 2010. Appellants filed a\n\nlawsuit against CES in 2009 to recover damages caused by this delay in the\n\ndevelopment of the project. Vernon Young testified that he would have been able to\n\nbegin marketing and constructing townhomes on the Property in mid to late 2011,\n\nexcept for the fact that Wells Fargo decided to proceed with the foreclosure in\n\nSeptember 2011.\n\n      On September 22, 2011, Wells Fargo sued Calhoun for breach of the Note and\n\nArtisan/American and the Youngs for breach of their guaranty agreements. Wells\n\nFargo foreclosed on November 1, 2011, and purchased the Property with a credit bid\n\nof $532,570 at the foreclosure sale, leaving a deficiency of $1,415,652. Wells Fargo\n\nlater amended its petition and sought to recover on this deficiency amount. Wells\n\nFargo eventually sold the Property to a neighboring charter school for $675,000 in\n\nMay 2013, approximately eighteen months after the foreclosure sale.\n\n      Appellants answered and filed three counterclaims seeking a declaratory\n\njudgment with respect to Wells Fargo’s interest in the proceeds of appellants’ lawsuit\n\nagainst CES and a valuation of the Property pursuant to the Texas Property Code,\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\fand asserting a claim for wrongful foreclosure with respect to any recovery in the\n\nCES lawsuit. The appellants’ declaratory judgment and wrongful foreclosure claims\n\nwere resolved in September 2012,2 and the only issue remaining to be tried was the\n\nfair market value of the Property on the date of the foreclosure sale.\n\n      Before trial, the parties stipulated that:\n\n          (1) the Note matured on January 23, 2009, and appellants failed to pay the\n              outstanding amounts due and owing under the Note;\n          (2) Wells Fargo foreclosed on the Property and sold it at auction on\n              November 1, 2011;\n          (3) Wells Fargo purchased the Property at the foreclosure sale for a credit\n              bid of $542,570; and\n          (4) appellants owed Wells Fargo $1,948,187.72 on November 1, 2011,\n              including all applicable interest and fees.\n\n      Three witnesses testified about the Property’s fair market value on November\n\n1, 2011: Wells Fargo’s appraiser, Phillip Barletta; appellants’ appraiser, William\n\nForrest; and Vernon Young.\n\n      Vernon Young testified that the Property had a fair market value of\n\n$2,400,000 on November 1, 2011. Young based his valuation on his experience as a\n\nhomebuilder, and specifically, what he thought the townhomes could sell for in the\n\nfuture, if they were built at all, and “what it would have cost” to develop the lots in\n\nNovember 2011. Appellants’ appraiser, Forrest, prepared a 2012 report in which he\n\n\n\n2\n      The CES lawsuit was settled, and the net proceeds of the suit, $629,786.44, were\n      deposited in the registry of the court subject to Wells Fargo’s security interest.\n\n                                            4\n\fassessed the Property’s fair market value to be $1.71 million as of the foreclosure\n\ndate, based on his analyses of comparable sales of homes and residential lots. Wells\n\nFargo’s appraiser, Barletta, prepared three reports in which he assessed the\n\nProperty’s fair market value to be $550,000 as of August 20, 2010, $590,000 as of\n\nAugust 26, 2011, and $650,000 as of May 2013. Barletta also prepared an October\n\n2013 report critiquing Forrest’s 2012 appraisal. Based on his 2011 and 2013\n\nappraisals, Barletta opined at trial that the fair market value of the Property on\n\nNovember 1, 2011 was between $590,000 and $650,000.\n\n      Forrest’s and Barletta’s appraisals of the Property share several similarities.\n\nAlthough Forrest and Barletta differed in their choice of comparable sales and their\n\nadjustments to those sales, their valuations of the individual lots was relatively\n\nclose—Barletta valued the lots at $14,500 each and Forrest valued them at $20,800\n\neach. Both experts also recognized that because lots in a subdivision sell over an\n\nextended period of time, they had to project the time it would take to sell all of the\n\nlots, i.e., the absorption rate, and then discount those future sales to a present value,\n\nas of November 1, 2011. The primary difference between the two appraisals is that\n\nBarletta projected that it would take several years longer to sell all of the lots than\n\nForrest. In addition to using a longer absorption rate, Barletta also used a higher\n\ndiscount rate because he perceived the Property’s future development to be riskier\n\nthan Forrest.\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      In his October 2013 report, Barletta criticized Forrest’s appraisal on a number\n\nof grounds. Specifically, Barletta took issue with Forrest’s comparison of the\n\nProperty’s small townhome lots with the sale of single-family homes in residential\n\nsubdivisions. According to Barletta, not only did the single-family homes used by\n\nForrest have lot sizes that were two to three-and-one-half times larger than the\n\nProperty’s lots, but the pool of buyers for single–family residences is traditionally\n\nmuch greater than the pool of buyers for townhomes. Barletta also noted that\n\nalthough Forrest “concede[d] that the [Property] is ‘stigmatized’” in his report and\n\nacknowledged that it usually takes ten years before stigmatized properties reclaim\n\ntheir previous values, Forrest “never consider[d] such ‘stigma’ in [his] actual\n\nanalyses” or made any adjustments to his aggressive absorption projections based\n\non stigma.\n\n      On cross-examination, Forrest testified that he based his appraisal of $1.7\n\nmillion on his assumption that, as of November 1, 2011, the Property was clear of\n\nany environmental contamination and was no longer stigmatized by CES’s\n\nenvironmental problems. He further testified that although it takes approximately\n\nten years before a property regains its pre-stigma value, the “stigmatism is usually\n\nover [after] three to four years and then [the] value starts continuing to rise.” Forrest\n\nalso acknowledged that although it is important to use sales data comparable to the\n\nsubject property when performing an appraisal, none of the sales he used to calculate\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fthe Property’s value were for similarly sized townhome lots. Forrest testified that his\n\nappraisal “did not take into consideration that [the Property] is adjacent to a property\n\nthat was previously contaminated.” He also testified that he did not know if any of\n\nthe residential subdivisions he included in his analysis were adjacent to an industrial\n\nproperty or a recently contaminated property.\n\n      Barletta’s 2010 and 2011 appraisals, Forrest’s 2012 appraisal, and Barletta’s\n\nreport criticizing Forrest’s appraisal were all admitted into evidence without\n\nobjection. Although appellants objected to Barletta’s 2013 appraisal based on the\n\nreport’s discussion of the May 2013 sale, the trial court overruled the objection.\n\n      At the conclusion of the testimony, the jury was asked to answer one question:\n\n“What was the Fair Market Value of the Property as of November 1, 2011?” “Market\n\nValue” was given its usual definition, without reference to the types of competent\n\nevidence described in the Texas Property Code. The trial court instructed the jury as\n\nfollows:\n\n      You are instructed that ‘Fair Market Value’ is the price the property\n      will bring when offered for sale by one who desires to sell, but is not\n      obligated to sell, and is bought by one who desires to buy, but is under\n      no necessity of buying.\n\nNovember 1, 2011 is the date Wells Fargo foreclosed on the Property. The jury\n\nanswered: $800,000.\n\n      The issue of attorney’s fees was subsequently tried to the bench. After the\n\nbench trial, the trial court signed a final judgment awarding Wells Fargo\n\n\n                                           7\n\f$1,148,187.72, which is the amount of debt stipulated to by the parties, minus the\n\n$800,000 fair market value of Property as found by the jury, plus $249,809.73 in\n\nprejudgment interest and post-judgment interest. The trial court also awarded Wells\n\nFargo $180,163.50 in attorney’s fees, $32,493.44 in expenses, and an additional\n\n$40,000 in conditional appellate attorney’s fees.\n\n      This appeal followed.\n\n                           Property Code Section 51.003\n\n      Property Code section 51.003 provides in part as follows:\n\n       (b) Any person against whom such a recovery is sought by motion may\n      request that the court in which the action is pending determine the fair\n      market value of the real property as of the date of the foreclosure sale.\n      The fair market value shall be determined by the finder of fact after the\n      introduction by the parties of competent evidence of the value.\n      Competent evidence of value may include, but is not limited to, the\n      following: (1) expert opinion testimony; (2) comparable sales; (3)\n      anticipated marketing time and holding costs; (4) cost of sale; and (5)\n      the necessity and amount of any discount to be applied to the future\n      sales price or the cashflow generated by the property to arrive at a\n      current fair market value.\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 51.003(b) (West 2014).\n\n                               Admission of Evidence\n\n      In their first issue, appellants argue that the trial court erred by admitting\n\nreferences to the sales price of Wells Fargo’s post-foreclosure sale in Barletta’s trial\n\ntestimony and his July 19, 2013 appraisal report. Appellants argue that the evidence\n\nshould not have been admitted because the sale was not made under ordinary market\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\fconditions. Specifically, appellants contend that the Property was not marketed for\n\nits highest and best use as a developed subdivision, and instead, was sold to a\n\nnon-profit school for expansion of its facilities.\n\n      Appellants filed a motion in limine seeking to exclude all evidence of the\n\npost-foreclosure sale, arguing that the evidence was inadmissible because there was\n\nno evidence showing the circumstances of the sale or how the Property was\n\nmarketed, and there was no evidence regarding the comparability of market\n\nconditions.

(holding subsequent sale of property\n\nordinarily is not evidence of value on earlier date, absent evidence that later sale was\n\nmade under similar market conditions). The trial court explained that it was denying\n\nthe motion in limine because Wells Fargo’s post-foreclosure sales price was the type\n\nof evidence that appraisal experts relied upon when forming an opinion on the fair\n\nmarket value of a given property. Appellants made the same objection to the\n\nadmission of Barletta’s May 2013 appraisal that referred to the post-foreclosure sale.\n\nThe trial court overruled the objection and admitted the appraisal.\n\n      If the price at which real property is sold at a foreclosure sale is less than the\n\nunpaid balance of the indebtedness secured by the property, resulting in a deficiency,\n\nan action may be brought to recover the deficiency.

Neither point, however,\n       is relevant to the question presented by appellants’ first issue—whether the trial\n       court abused its discretion by admitting evidence of the post-foreclosure sale.\n\n                                             10\n\f      Appellants also contend that PlainsCapital’s exception to the common\n\ndefinition of “fair market value” is inapplicable here because the Property was not\n\nmarketed for its highest or best use. PlainsCapital expressly declined to hold that\n\n“the future sales price” requires a “showing of comparable market conditions\n\nbetween the foreclosure sale and the future sale” because that “would be adding\n\nwords to § 51.003.” PlainsCapital, 459 S.W.3d at 556. In reaching its decision, the\n\ncourt held that evidence of a future sales price “will support a fair market value\n\nfinding under [Property Code section 51.003] even though that type of evidence\n\nmight not otherwise be competent in the common or historical fair market value\n\nconstruct.” Id. at 556–57.

Analysis\n\n      Appellants argue that the only evidence supporting the jury’s finding that the\n\nProperty had a fair market value of $800,000 on the date of foreclosure is Wells\n\nFargo’s post-foreclosure sale of the Property, which is inadmissible, and Barletta’s\n\nappraisals valuing the Property between $590,000 and $650,000, which are\n\ninsufficient to support a judgment.4\n\n\n\n\n4\n      Wells Fargo responds that even if this evidence is excluded, there is sufficient\n      evidence to support the jury’s finding of fair market value. We agree. Accordingly,\n      we will not consider Barletta’s appraisals of the Property, or his testimony valuing\n      the Property between $590,000 and $650,000, as competent evidence of the\n      Property’s fair market value for purpose of our sufficiency analysis.\n\n\n                                           13\n\f      At trial, appellants presented evidence that the Property had a fair market\n\nvalue of between $1.71 million and $2.4 million on November 1, 2011.5 Wells Fargo\n\nintroduced Barletta’s October 2013 report criticizing Forrest’s appraisal into\n\nevidence, and presented testimony that the Property was sold in May 2013 for\n\n$675,000. The testimony and evidence before the jury was uniform in showing that\n\nsome stigma had attached to the Property because of prior environmental\n\ncontamination problems on the adjacent tract. There was extensive testimony\n\nexplaining the different discounts to be applied to the value of the Property as a result\n\nof this stigma.\n\n      In light of our resolution of appellants’ first issue, we conclude that evidence\n\nof the May 2013 sale is “competent evidence” of the Property’s fair market value on\n\nNovember 1, 2011, the date of foreclosure. See TEX. PROP. CODE ANN. § 51.003(b);\n\nPlainsCapital, 459 S.W.3d at 556–57. Thus, the jury’s finding of $800,000 was\n\nwithin the range of fair market values permitted by the evidence ($675,000 to\n\n$2,400,000). As the sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and the weight of\n\ntheir testimony, it was within the jury’s province to credit Forrest’s appraisal of\n\n$1,710,000, but then reduce that value to $800,000 in light of the factors Barletta\n\n\n\n\n5\n      Although Wells Fargo argues that Vernon Young’s testimony is incompetent\n      evidence of the Property’s fair market value, it is not necessary for the Court to\n      address this issue in order to dispose of the appeal.\n\n\n                                           14\n\fraised in his October 2013 report, or points Forrest testified to on cross-examination.\n\nSee City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 819\n\n      After considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, and\n\nindulging every reasonable inference that would support it, we conclude that there\n\nis legally sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding that the Property had a fair\n\nmarket value of $800,000 on November 1, 2011.

Analysis\n\n      Wells Fargo pleaded for attorney’s fees under Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode section 38.001 and the contractual attorney’s fee provisions in the Note and\n\nguaranty agreement. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. 38.001 (West 2014).\n\n      The Note’s attorney’s fees provision states:\n\n      If any holder of this note retains an attorney in connection with any\n      default or to collect, enforce or defend this note or any of the Loan\n      Documents in any lawsuit or in any probate, reorganization, bankruptcy\n      or other proceeding, or if Maker sues any holder in connection with this\n      note or any of the Loan Documents and does not prevail, then Maker\n      agrees to pay to each such holder, in addition to principal and interest,\n      all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such holder in trying to\n      collect this note or in any such proceeding, including reasonable\n      attorney’s fees.\n\nThus, the Note obligates appellants to pay Wells Fargo “all reasonable costs and\n\nexpenses incurred . . . in any such proceeding, including reasonable attorney’s fees,”\n\nif (1) Wells Fargo retains an attorney to collect on or enforce the Note or any of the\n\nguarantees6 in any lawsuit or other proceeding; or (2) appellants sue Wells Fargo “in\n\nconnection with this note or any of the Loan Documents and does not prevail.” The\n\ncontract does not condition Wells Fargo’s recovery of costs, expenses, and\n\nattorney’s fees on Wells Fargo being a prevailing party in the lawsuit. Accordingly,\n\nthe Note governs Wells Fargo’s right to recovery of attorney’s fees. See KB Home,\n\n\n\n\n6\n      The guaranty agreement is a “Loan Document.”\n\n\n                                         18\n\f295 S.W.3d at 653 (indicating when contract provision sets forth looser fee-recovery\n\nstandard than Chapter 38, contract language governs).7\n\n      This suit for breach of contract to recover the deficiency due on the Note is\n\nthe type of lawsuit contemplated by the fee-recovery provision. Furthermore, the\n\nNote’s fee-recovery provision entitles Wells Fargo to recover reasonable costs,\n\nexpenses, and attorney’s fees “incurred . . . in trying to collect this note or in any\n\nsuch proceeding.” This language is broad enough to encompass all of appellants’\n\ncounterclaims and affirmative defenses in the underlying lawsuit. Accordingly, there\n\nis no need to segregate the attorney’s fees in question. We hold that the Note’s\n\nunambiguous fee-recovery provision entitles Wells Fargo to recover all of its\n\nattorney’s fees incurred in the underlying lawsuit.\n\n      Alternatively, appellants argue that, even if the trial court was correct in\n\nawarding Wells Fargo some amount of attorney’s fees, the court, nevertheless, erred\n\nby failing to take into account the extent to which each party prevailed on the\n\nvaluation issue and reducing the amount of Wells Fargo’s fee award accordingly.\n\nSpecifically, appellants contend that “the amount involved” and “the results\n\nobtained” are key factors to be considered in evaluating the reasonableness of an\n\nattorney’s fee award. See Smith v. Patrick W.Y. Tam Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895170\"><a href=\"/opinion/895170/smith-v-patrick-wy-tam-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 548\n\n\n\n7\n      The guaranty agreement also contains a similarly broad fee and expense recovery\n      provision that is less restrictive than Chapter 38.\n\n\n                                         19\n\f(Tex. 2009). Appellants further contend that the trial court erred by ignoring the\n\nextent to which Wells Fargo did not succeed in its trial position because the court\n\nawarded Wells Fargo the full amount of its attorney’s fees, despite the fact that the\n\njury found that the fair market value of the property was greater than the value\n\nadvocated by Wells Fargo.\n\n      We review the amount of attorney’s fees awarded under a legal sufficiency\n\nstandard, viewing the evidence in a light that tends to support the disputed finding\n\nand disregarding evidence and inferences to the contrary.

Corp. v.\n\nDavis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1629433\"><a href=\"/opinion/1629433/emc-mortg-corp-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 418 (Tex.

(“To determine an appropriate fee award,\n\nthe trial judge is entitled to look at the entire record and to view the matter in light\n\nof the amount in controversy, the nature of the case, and his or her personal\n\nexperience as a lawyer and judge.”).\n\n      The record reflects that Wells Fargo bought the property at the foreclosure\n\nsale for $532,570, leaving a deficiency of $1,415,652 on the note. At trial, Wells\n\nFargo’s appraiser testified that the property was valued at between $590,000 and\n\n$650,000. Appellants’ expert testified that the property’s fair market value was $1.7\n\nmillion, and Young testified that the property was worth $2.4 million. The jury,\n\nhowever, disagreed with both sides and found that the property had a fair market\n\nvalue of $800,000. As a result of the jury’s finding, appellants’ offset against the\n\ndeficiency they owed to Wells Fargo on the note was greater than the offset that\n\nWells Fargo argued appellants were entitled to under the statute, but far less than the\n\noffset appellants were seeking.\n\n      Wells Fargo’s two attorney’s fees experts testified to some degree regarding\n\neach Arthur Andersen factor. In particular, one or both of the experts testified about\n\nthe time and labor spent on the case, the experience, reputation, and ability of each\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fof the attorneys and paralegals who were involved during the various stages of the\n\ncase, and the fees customarily charged in the area for similar legal services. With\n\nregard to “the amount involved and the results obtained,” one of Wells Fargo’s\n\nexperts testified that the company’s breach of contract claim was based on an\n\napproximately $1.5 million deficiency,8 and that if the jury had found that the\n\nproperty had a fair market value of $2.4 million, as Young testified, then Wells Fargo\n\nwould not have prevailed on its breach of contract claim at all because it would not\n\nhave had any damages.\n\n      Wells Fargo’s experts also testified that this was a complex case that involved\n\n“very complex UCC issues,” as well as matters relevant to commercial litigation and\n\nbankruptcy. Wells Fargo’s experts testified that that there were numerous issues that\n\nimpacted the fair market value of the property in this case, such as the environmental\n\ncontamination event on the adjacent CES property, and the fact that the foreclosure\n\noccurred during the Great Recession of 2008.\n\n      One expert opined that Wells Fargo’s fees were “reasonable and necessary”\n\n“given the complexity of the case, given the issues on not the only valuation of the\n\nproperty but given the issues surrounding . . . the CES litigation.”\n\n\n\n\n8\n      The parties stipulated that, at the time of trial, appellants owed $1,948,187.72 on the\n      note, which included all applicable interest and fees.\n\n\n                                            22\n\f      Wells Fargo’s second expert also testified that the amount of Wells Fargo’s\n\nattorney’s fees in this case was “influenced by the decisions [and] the tactics used\n\nby” appellants, such as appellants’ insistence on a jury trial, as opposed to a bench\n\ntrial. He further testified that appellants “chose, on numerous occasions, tactics that\n\ncaused [Wells Fargo] to have to expend additional attorney’s fees to move forward.\n\nFor example, although appellants eventually stipulated that Wells Fargo had a\n\nsecurity interest in the proceeds of appellants’ suit against CES, appellants initially\n\nchallenged Wells Fargo’s interest in the proceeds of the litigation and brought a\n\ndeclaratory judgment claim on that issue, which Wells Fargo was forced to defend\n\nagainst.\n\n      Based on the testimony of Wells Fargo’s experts, the trial court could have\n\ndecided that although Wells Fargo did not prevail at trial to the extent that it had\n\nhoped, $180,163.509 in attorney’s fees was, nevertheless, “reasonable and\n\nnecessary” in light of the expert’s testimony regarding the complexity of the case.\n\nSee Sibley v.
