Those contracts include a\n\nwritten contract, entered into in 1997, and two oral contracts, entered into in\n\n2006, for roofing work on a commercial building owned by a McClincy entity.\n\n\n       1 McClincy v. Miller Roofing Enters. Inc.. noted at 168 Wn. App. 1001,\n2012 WL 1587914.\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/2\n\n\n\n\n       A bench trial in October 2010 culminated in a final judgment in favor of\n\nMcClincy in the amount of $1,388,193.59. Miller appealed, and this court\n\nreversed in part in an unpublished decision.\n\n       As to the written contract claim, this court held that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to support a particular finding, and it reversed the judgment to the\n\nextent of that claim.\n\n\n       As to the oral contract claims, this court held that it was unclear whether\n\nthese claims were barred by the statute of limitations, whether Miller waived the\n\naffirmative defense of untimely service of process, and when McClincy had\n\nnotice of the defects underlying its claims. This court noted that the damages on\n\nwhich the breach of written contract claim was based were not segregated from\n\nthe damages awarded for the breach of the oral contract claims. Accordingly,\n\nthis court reversed the judgment on the two oral contract claims and remanded\n\nfor further proceedings. In no way can the prior decision of this court be\n\nreasonably read as a \"do-over\" of the entire original trial.\n\n       In July 2012, following remand, Miller moved to amend its answer to\n\nassert 12 new affirmative defenses in addition to the seven defenses it previously\n\nasserted in the original trial. These new defenses included:\n\n              (8)       Untimely service of process.\n\n              (9)       Untimely notice of alleged defects.\n\n              (10)      There is a lack of privity between Plaintiff McClincy\n                        Brothers Floor Covering, Inc. and this Defendant and,\n                        therefore Plaintiff McClincy Brothers Floor Covering,\n                        Inc. lacks standing to pursue claims against\n                        Defendant.\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/3\n\n\n\n\n              (11)   The damages sustained by Plaintiffs are unavoidable\n                     from the standpoint of this Defendant.\n\n              (12)   Intervening and superseding cause.\n\n              (13)   Plaintiffs accepted the performance of Defendants.\n\n              (14)   Plaintiffs misused the product.\n\n              (15)   No warranty was provided or any applicable warranty\n                     expired.\n\n              (16)   Plaintiffs' claim is barred by the rules governing\n                     spoliation of evidence.\n\n              (17)   Plaintiffs' claim for repair costs will result in an unjust\n                     enrichment and substantial increase in the value of\n                     the property and its reasonable useful life.\n\n              (18)   Plaintiffs' claim and suit are barred by RCW\n                     4.16.326(1)(g).\n\n              (19)   The alleged breaches do not and will not adversely\n                     affect the performance of the building(s) and any\n                     adverse effect is merely technical and not significant\n                     to a reasonable person.[2]\n       In its motion for leave to amend, Miller argued that several of these\n\ndefenses were \"formalizing arguments made by Miller previously.\"\n\n       McClincy opposed the motion. McClincy correctly argued that the prior\n\ndecision of this court limited the scope of issues to be addressed on remand.\n\nMcClincy also argued that allowing the amendment would be prejudicial, that\n\nMiller waived these affirmative defenses, and that the defenses were barred by\n\nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n\n\n\n        Clerk's Papers at 9.\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/4\n\n\n\n\n       The trial court denied Miller's motion for leave to amend. It later entered\n\nan order and certified it for immediate review pursuant to CR 54(b) as a final\n\nappealable judgment.\n\n                          MOTION TO AMEND ANSWER\n\n\n       Miller argues that the trial court manifestly abused its discretion by\n\ndenying its motion for leave to amend the answer and affirmative defenses.\n\nSpecifically, it argues that Washington law permits amendments to pleadings\n\nafter remand and that the amendment is proper under CR 15. We hold that the\n\ntrial court properly exercised its discretion when it denied this motion.\n\n       The decision to grant leave to amend pleadings is within the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court.3 When reviewing the trial court's decision to grant or\n\nto deny leave to amend, the reviewing court applies a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion test.4\n\n       Our review of the trial court's exercise of discretion is guided by principles\n\nstated in In re Marriage of Littlefield and the authorities on which it relies.5 In that\n\ncase, the supreme court stated:\n\n              A court's decision is manifestly unreasonable if it is outside\n       the range of acceptable choices, given the facts and the applicable\n       legal standard; it is based on untenable grounds if the factual\n\n       3 Hines v. Todd Pac. Shipyards Corp.. 127 Wn. App. 356, 373-74, 112\nP.3d 522 (2005).\n\n       4 Herron v. Tribune Publ'q Co.. Inc., 108 Wn.2d 162, 165, 736 P.2d 249\n(1987) (citing Del Guzzi Constr. Co. v. Global Nw.. Ltd.. 105 Wn.2d 878, 888,\n719P.2d 120(1986)).\n\n       5 In re Marriage of Littlefield. 133 Wn.2d 39, 940 P.2d 1362 (1997).\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/5\n\n\n\n\n      findings are unsupported by the record; it is based on untenable\n       reasons if it is based on an incorrect standard or the facts do not\n      meet the requirements ofthe correct standard.[6]\n      Here, the trial court correctly construed the remand to be about limited\n\nissues, not the whole case. At oral argument, the trial court stated:\n\n              And they knocked out a few things, which I think narrows it.\n      In fact, they did take the time to narrow the issues on remand.\n      They didn't just say it's a do-over, they said specifically what I'm\n      to consider. They didn't say open up the record. They didn't\n      say open up discovery again. They said, directly, you need to\n      find enough evidence, one way or the other.\n\n\n\n            But I think it would be absolutely prejudicial to allow the\n       amendment at this late stage in the proceedings. It's like saying\n       everything that [Miller's prior counsel] did doesn't count.[7]\n       The question is whether the trial court's decision is outside the range of\n\nacceptable choices, given our prior decision and the facts and the applicable\n\nlegal standard.\n\n       Miller argues that \"longstanding Washington law\" broadly permits\n\namendments to pleadings after remand, citing to various cases. McClincy\n\nargues that because this case was remanded with instructions to retry only\n\ncertain discrete issues, circumstances in this case are \"starkly different\" from the\n\ncircumstances in the cases cited by Miller. Which of these contrasting views is\n\ncorrect under the circumstances of this case is at issue.\n\n\n\n       6Id at 47 (citing State v. Rundguist. 79 Wn. App. 786, 793, 905 P.2d 922\n(1995)).\n\n       7 Report of Proceedings (Oct. 30, 2012) at 17 (emphasis added).\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/6\n\n\n\n\n       Neither party cites the supreme court's opinion in Ennis v. Ring.8 But dicta\nin that case supports the trial court's decision.\n\n       That case involved two appeals.9 The original action was brought by court\n\ncommissioners for rent and for breach of lease.10 At the conclusion of the case,\n\nthe trial judge entered a judgment of dismissal without prejudice.11 The supreme\ncourt, on the first appeal, reversed in part with instructions to grant a new trial\n\nupon the causes of action which had been dismissed erroneously.12 On remand,\nthe lessees amended their answer to include a counterclaim.13 The case was\n\nappealed a second time, and the plaintiffs urged that \"the trial court should not\n\nhave permitted amendment of the answer to include an entirely new defense\n\nafter remand for retrial on specific issues.\"u In its opinion, the court stated:\n\"We have no quarrel with this contention, in proper circumstances, but it is clear it\n\nis not applicable to the instant case.\"15 Although this statement was dicta, it\n\n\n\n\n       8 56 Wn.2d 465,   341   P.2d 885 (1959).\n\n       9 Id at 469.\n\n       10 jd\n\n       11 Id\n\n       12 Id\n\n       13 Id\n\n       14 Id. at 470 (emphasis in original).\n\n       15 Id.\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/7\n\n\n\n\nsupports the trial court's exercise of discretion in this case. In sum, a \"remand for\n\nretrial on specific issues\" is different from a general remand.\n\n       Nonetheless, even if an amendment to a pleading in this circumstance is\n\nprocedurally proper, the amendment is still governed by CR 15. For that reason,\n\nwe next consider the decision under that rule.\n\n\n       CR 15(a) governs amendments of pleadings. The rule provides that leave\n\nto amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"16 The purpose ofthe\nrule is to \"facilitate proper decisions on the merits, to provide parties with\n\nadequate notice of the basis for claims and defenses asserted against them, and\n\nto allow amendment of the pleadings except where amendment would result in\n\nprejudice to the opposing party.\"17\n       The factors a court may consider in determining prejudice include undue\n\ndelay, unfair surprise, and whether the amendment is likely to result in jury\n\nconfusion, introduce remote issues, or lead to a lengthy trial.18 The timing ofa\nmotion to amend pleadings, in terms of the \"progress of litigation,\" may result in\n\nprejudice but otherwise is not dispositive.19 Similarly, the fact that an amendment\ncould have been included in an earlier pleading will not preclude amendment\n\n\n\n       16\n            CR 15(a).\n\n       17 Wilson v. Horslev. 137 Wn.2d 500, 505, 974 P.2d 316 (1999) (citing\nCaruso v. Local Union No. 690. 100 Wn.2d 343, 349, 670 P.2d 240 (1983)).\n\n       18 Herron, 108 Wn.2d at 165-66.\n\n       19 ]d at 166 (citing Caruso. 100 Wn.2d at 349-50)).\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/8\n\n\n\n\nabsent prejudice.20 Overall, the \"touchstone\" for the denial of a motion to amend\nis the prejudice such an amendment would cause to the nonmoving party.21 A\nshowing of actual prejudice must rise beyond conclusory assertions.22\n       Here, the trial court explicitly stated that its justification for the court's\n\ndenial of the motion was the prejudice that McClincy would endure:\n\n       I don't think that's what this opinion is telling me to do, is to reopen\n       the record on all issues and allow [Miller] to plead affirmative\n       defenses that were never pled by [Miller's prior counsel] in the first\n       place. That's prejudicial; that would be a manifest abuse of\n       discretion.[22]\n\n       The trial court's determination of prejudice is well supported. McClincy's\n\ncounsel argued to \"[pjrove up affirmative defenses that were not pled require[s]\n\nnew discovery, new evidence, [and] new expense.\"24 He stated that \"the\nprejudice is the time, the delay, and the extraordinary expense,\" and he argued\n\nthat \"[McClincy] doesn't have the resources available to [it].\"25\n       McClincy also submitted a declaration from its attorney outlining the\n\nimpact of such an amendment. McClincy's counsel indicated that some or all of\n\nthe 13 witnesses who testified at trial would have to be re-deposed, and some or\n\n\n       20 Caruso. 100 Wn.2d at 350.\n\n       21 Wilson. 137Wn.2dat505.\n\n       22 See Walla v. Johnson, 50 Wn. App. 879, 884, 751 P.2d 334 (1988);\nCaruso. 100 Wn.2d at 351.\n\n       23 Report of Proceedings (Oct. 30, 2012) at 18.\n       24 ]d at 14.\n\n       25 Id.\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/9\n\n\n\n\nall would have to be recalled for trial testimony. He stated that even if Miller did\n\nnot intend to engage in discovery, McClincy would still have to marshal evidence\n\nin opposition.\n\n       Although McClincy was not able to pinpoint the exact cost of relitigating\n\nthese issues, McClincy's arguments rise beyond mere conclusory assertions.\n\nMcClincy clearly identifies each defense that will require new evidence and\n\nexpert testimony.\n\n       In Oliver v. Flow International Corp., this court held that the opponent's\n\nshowing of prejudice was adequate to justify denial of a motion to amend the\n\ncomplaint because \"[a] new round ofdiscovery would have been necessary.\"26\nAs discussed above, this would be a similar concern here.\n\n       In sum, given the trial court's concern about reopening the record, and\n\nMcClincy's arguments that the amendment would be prejudicial, the trial court did\n\nnot manifestly abuse its discretion when it denied Miller's motion.\n\n       Miller makes a number of arguments that the amendment is proper under\n\nCR 15, but they are not persuasive. Accordingly, we reject all of them.\n\n       First, Miller argues that there is no prejudice to McClincy because\n\nMcClincy did not object to Miller's jury demand. That is irrelevant. Equally\n\nirrelevant is that no trial date has been set. The issue is not whether McClincy\n\nwould have ample time to conduct discovery, amend its complaint, or identify\n\n\n\n\n       26\n            137 Wn. App. 655, 664, 155 P.3d 140 (2006).\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/10\n\n\n\n\nnew witnesses. Rather, the issue is whether McClincy would have to do this at\n\nall. Thus, Miller's arguments are not helpful.\n\n       Second, Miller contends that McClincy's argument that it will have to\n\nreopen discovery at enormous cost is made \"without any evidentiary support, and\n\nfails to acknowledge recoveries by [McClincy].\" But, as discussed above, the\n\ndeclaration submitted by McClincy's counsel, as well as the arguments made at\n\noral argument, both demonstrate the expense that McClincy might incur if\n\ndiscovery was reopened. Although McClincy could not pinpoint the cost, this\n\nshowing was adequate. Additionally, Miller's suggestion that McClincy could\n\nmove for a protective order is irrelevant. Miller cites no authority for the\n\nproposition that this is the \"proper remedy\" for potential prejudice, or that this is to\n\nbe considered in a CR 15 analysis when determining whether the opposing party\n\nwill suffer prejudice. Thus, we reject these arguments.27\n       Third, Miller argues that the evidence establishes that \"Miller, and not\n\n[McClincy], would be severely prejudiced if Miller were forced to try this matter\n\nwithout some limited discovery.\" But again, Miller has cited no authority that\n\nrequires a court to consider prejudice to the moving party or that instructs a\n\ncourt to weigh the competing prejudices.\n\n       Fourth, Miller argues that many of these defenses are now appropriate \"in\n\nlight of the changed procedural posture of the case\" and that the issues are \"now\n\n\n\n       27 State v. Dennison, 115 Wn.2d 609, 629, 801 P.2d 193 (1990): Cowiche\nCanyon Conservancy v. Boslev, 118 Wn.2d 801, 809, 828 P.2d 549 (1992).\n\n\n                                              10\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/11\n\n\n\n\nreconfigured.\" Miller's argument has no weight. As discussed above, the issues\n\nare not \"reconfigured\" on remand.\n\n       Finally, Miller argues that several of the affirmative defenses are proper\n\nunder CR 15(b), which provides that \"[w]hen issues not raised [in] the pleadings\n\nare tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated as if\n\nthey had been raised in the pleadings.\"28 Miller argues that a number ofthese\ndefenses \"merely formalize arguments previously made by Miller.\"\n\n       Under CR 15(b), \"failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial\n\nof [those] issues.\" Accordingly, whether McClincy impliedly consented to any of\n\nthese defenses must still be addressed.\n\n\n       In determining whether the parties impliedly tried an issue, an appellate\n\ncourt will consider the record as a whole.29 But the record that is presently\n\nbefore this court in this review is very limited. It obviously is not the same record\n\nthat was before this court on the prior review. Thus, we are not able to make the\n\ndetermination about which of these defenses, if any, were impliedly consented to\n\nby McClincy in the prior trial. The trial court is in the best position to make this\n\ndetermination in the first instance. We defer to the trial court to make that\n\ndetermination in this case.\n\n       In this court's prior opinion, this court expressly directed the trial court, on\n\nremand, to consider whether Miller waived one of these defenses (service of\n\n\n       28\n            CR 15(b).\n\n       29 Dewey v. Tacoma Sch. Dist. No. 10, 95 Wn. App. 18, 26, 974 P.2d 847\n(1999).\n                                              11\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/12\n\n\n\n\nprocess). The trial court indicated in its oral ruling that it would follow this court's\n\ninstructions: \"I'm going to just go paragraph by paragraph, based on what their\n\nremand directs this Court to do.\"30 Accordingly, even if Miller's answer does not\nformally reflect the addition of these defenses, the trial court will consider the\n\nrelevant defenses, including any defenses that may have been impliedly\n\nconsented to, on remand.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not manifestly abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion for leave to amend. McClincy would be\n\nprejudiced by such an amendment. Further, whether there is a formal\n\namendment does not affect the trial court's limited review and consideration of\n\nthe relevant issues.\n\n          WAIVER, COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL, AND STARE DECISIS\n\n       McClincy argues that the proposed affirmative defenses are barred by\n\nwaiver, by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and by stare decisis. Because of\n\nour disposition, we need not address these arguments.\n\n       We affirm the order denying the motion to amend.\n\n\n                                                                           X\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n    '-US^t-y       Aca:                                  tyjud^\n       30 Report of Proceedings (Oct. 30, 2012) at 17.\n                                               12\n\f",

Those contracts include a\n\nwritten contract, entered into in 1997, and two oral contracts, entered into in\n\n2006, for roofing work on a commercial building owned by a McClincy entity.\n\n\n       1 McClincy v.

Miller appealed, and this court\n\nreversed in part in an unpublished decision.\n\n       As to the written contract claim, this court held that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to support a particular finding, and it reversed the judgment to the\n\nextent of that claim.\n\n\n       As to the oral contract claims, this court held that it was unclear whether\n\nthese claims were barred by the statute of limitations, whether Miller waived the\n\naffirmative defense of untimely service of process, and when McClincy had\n\nnotice of the defects underlying its claims. This court noted that the damages on\n\nwhich the breach of written contract claim was based were not segregated from\n\nthe damages awarded for the breach of the oral contract claims. Accordingly,\n\nthis court reversed the judgment on the two oral contract claims and remanded\n\nfor further proceedings. In no way can the prior decision of this court be\n\nreasonably read as a \"do-over\" of the entire original trial.\n\n       In July 2012, following remand, Miller moved to amend its answer to\n\nassert 12 new affirmative defenses in addition to the seven defenses it previously\n\nasserted in the original trial. These new defenses included:\n\n              (8)       Untimely service of process.\n\n              (9)       Untimely notice of alleged defects.\n\n              (10)      There is a lack of privity between Plaintiff McClincy\n                        Brothers Floor Covering, Inc. and this Defendant and,\n                        therefore Plaintiff McClincy Brothers Floor Covering,\n                        Inc. lacks standing to pursue claims against\n                        Defendant.\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/3\n\n\n\n\n              (11)   The damages sustained by Plaintiffs are unavoidable\n                     from the standpoint of this Defendant.\n\n              (12)   Intervening and superseding cause.\n\n              (13)   Plaintiffs accepted the performance of Defendants.\n\n              (14)   Plaintiffs misused the product.\n\n              (15)   No warranty was provided or any applicable warranty\n                     expired.\n\n              (16)   Plaintiffs' claim is barred by the rules governing\n                     spoliation of evidence.\n\n              (17)   Plaintiffs' claim for repair costs will result in an unjust\n                     enrichment and substantial increase in the value of\n                     the property and its reasonable useful life.\n\n              (18)   Plaintiffs' claim and suit are barred by RCW\n                     4.16.326(1)(g).\n\n              (19)   The alleged breaches do not and will not adversely\n                     affect the performance of the building(s) and any\n                     adverse effect is merely technical and not significant\n                     to a reasonable person.[2]\n       In its motion for leave to amend, Miller argued that several of these\n\ndefenses were \"formalizing arguments made by Miller previously.\"\n\n       McClincy opposed the motion. McClincy correctly argued that the prior\n\ndecision of this court limited the scope of issues to be addressed on remand.\n\nMcClincy also argued that allowing the amendment would be prejudicial, that\n\nMiller waived these affirmative defenses, and that the defenses were barred by\n\nthe doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n\n\n\n        Clerk's Papers at 9.\n\fNo. 69606-8-1/4\n\n\n\n\n       The trial court denied Miller's motion for leave to amend. It later entered\n\nan order and certified it for immediate review pursuant to CR 54(b) as a final\n\nappealable judgment.\n\n                          MOTION TO AMEND ANSWER\n\n\n       Miller argues that the trial court manifestly abused its discretion by\n\ndenying its motion for leave to amend the answer and affirmative defenses.\n\nSpecifically, it argues that Washington law permits amendments to pleadings\n\nafter remand and that the amendment is proper under CR 15. We hold that the\n\ntrial court properly exercised its discretion when it denied this motion.\n\n       The decision to grant leave to amend pleadings is within the sound\n\ndiscretion of the trial court.3 When reviewing the trial court's decision to grant or\n\nto deny leave to amend, the reviewing court applies a manifest abuse of\n\ndiscretion test.4\n\n       Our review of the trial court's exercise of discretion is guided by principles\n\nstated in In re Marriage of Littlefield and the authorities on which it relies.5 In that\n\ncase, the supreme court stated:\n\n              A court's decision is manifestly unreasonable if it is outside\n       the range of acceptable choices, given the facts and the applicable\n       legal standard; it is based on untenable grounds if the factual\n\n       3 Hines v.

At oral argument, the trial court stated:\n\n              And they knocked out a few things, which I think narrows it.\n      In fact, they did take the time to narrow the issues on remand.\n      They didn't just say it's a do-over, they said specifically what I'm\n      to consider. They didn't say open up the record. They didn't\n      say open up discovery again. They said, directly, you need to\n      find enough evidence, one way or the other.\n\n\n\n            But I think it would be absolutely prejudicial to allow the\n       amendment at this late stage in the proceedings.

For that reason,\n\nwe next consider the decision under that rule.\n\n\n       CR 15(a) governs amendments of pleadings. The rule provides that leave\n\nto amend \"shall be freely given when justice so requires.\"16 The purpose ofthe\nrule is to \"facilitate proper decisions on the merits, to provide parties with\n\nadequate notice of the basis for claims and defenses asserted against them, and\n\nto allow amendment of the pleadings except where amendment would result in\n\nprejudice to the opposing party.\"17\n       The factors a court may consider in determining prejudice include undue\n\ndelay, unfair surprise, and whether the amendment is likely to result in jury\n\nconfusion, introduce remote issues, or lead to a lengthy trial.18 The timing ofa\nmotion to amend pleadings, in terms of the \"progress of litigation,\" may result in\n\nprejudice but otherwise is not dispositive.19 Similarly, the fact that an amendment\ncould have been included in an earlier pleading will not preclude amendment\n\n\n\n       16\n            CR 15(a).\n\n       </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wilson</span> <span class=\"page\">v</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

That's prejudicial; that would be a manifest abuse of\n       discretion.[22]\n\n       The trial court's determination of prejudice is well supported.

Flow International Corp., this court held that the opponent's\n\nshowing of prejudice was adequate to justify denial of a motion to amend the\n\ncomplaint because \"[a] new round ofdiscovery would have been necessary.\"26\nAs discussed above, this would be a similar concern here.\n\n       In sum, given the trial court's concern about reopening the record, and\n\nMcClincy's arguments that the amendment would be prejudicial, the trial court did\n\nnot manifestly abuse its discretion when it denied Miller's motion.\n\n       Miller makes a number of arguments that the amendment is proper under\n\nCR 15, but they are not persuasive. Accordingly, we reject all of them.\n\n       First, Miller argues that there is no prejudice to McClincy because\n\nMcClincy did not object to Miller's jury demand. That is irrelevant. Equally\n\nirrelevant is that no trial date has been set. The issue is not whether McClincy\n\nwould have ample time to conduct discovery, amend its complaint, or identify\n\n\n\n\n       26\n            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">137</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

Rather, the issue is whether McClincy would have to do this at\n\nall. Thus, Miller's arguments are not helpful.\n\n       Second, Miller contends that McClincy's argument that it will have to\n\nreopen discovery at enormous cost is made \"without any evidentiary support, and\n\nfails to acknowledge recoveries by [McClincy].\" But, as discussed above, the\n\ndeclaration submitted by McClincy's counsel, as well as the arguments made at\n\noral argument, both demonstrate the expense that McClincy might incur if\n\ndiscovery was reopened. Although McClincy could not pinpoint the cost, this\n\nshowing was adequate. Additionally, Miller's suggestion that McClincy could\n\nmove for a protective order is irrelevant. Miller cites no authority for the\n\nproposition that this is the \"proper remedy\" for potential prejudice, or that this is to\n\nbe considered in a CR 15 analysis when determining whether the opposing party\n\nwill suffer prejudice. Thus, we reject these arguments.27\n       Third, Miller argues that the evidence establishes that \"Miller, and not\n\n[McClincy], would be severely prejudiced if Miller were forced to try this matter\n\nwithout some limited discovery.\" But again, Miller has cited no authority that\n\nrequires a court to consider prejudice to the moving party or that instructs a\n\ncourt to weigh the competing prejudices.\n\n       Fourth, Miller argues that many of these defenses are now appropriate \"in\n\nlight of the changed procedural posture of the case\" and that the issues are \"now\n\n\n\n       27 State v.

As discussed above, the issues\n\nare not \"reconfigured\" on remand.\n\n       Finally, Miller argues that several of the affirmative defenses are proper\n\nunder CR 15(b), which provides that \"[w]hen issues not raised [in] the pleadings\n\nare tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they shall be treated as if\n\nthey had been raised in the pleadings.\"28 Miller argues that a number ofthese\ndefenses \"merely formalize arguments previously made by Miller.\"\n\n       Under CR 15(b), \"failure so to amend does not affect the result of the trial\n\nof [those] issues.\" Accordingly, whether McClincy impliedly consented to any of\n\nthese defenses must still be addressed.\n\n\n       In determining whether the parties impliedly tried an issue, an appellate\n\ncourt will consider the record as a whole.29 But the record that is presently\n\nbefore this court in this review is very limited. It obviously is not the same record\n\nthat was before this court on the prior review. Thus, we are not able to make the\n\ndetermination about which of these defenses, if any, were impliedly consented to\n\nby McClincy in the prior trial. The trial court is in the best position to make this\n\ndetermination in the first instance. We defer to the trial court to make that\n\ndetermination in this case.\n\n       In this court's prior opinion, this court expressly directed the trial court, on\n\nremand, to consider whether Miller waived one of these defenses (service of\n\n\n       28\n            CR 15(b).\n\n       29 Dewey v.

The trial court indicated in its oral ruling that it would follow this court's\n\ninstructions: \"I'm going to just go paragraph by paragraph, based on what their\n\nremand directs this Court to do.\"30 Accordingly, even if Miller's answer does not\nformally reflect the addition of these defenses, the trial court will consider the\n\nrelevant defenses, including any defenses that may have been impliedly\n\nconsented to, on remand.\n\n       In sum, we conclude that the trial court did not manifestly abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion for leave to amend. McClincy would be\n\nprejudiced by such an amendment. Further, whether there is a formal\n\namendment does not affect the trial court's limited review and consideration of\n\nthe relevant issues.\n\n          WAIVER, COLLATERAL ESTOPPEL, AND STARE DECISIS\n\n       McClincy argues that the proposed affirmative defenses are barred by\n\nwaiver, by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, and by stare decisis. Because of\n\nour disposition, we need not address these arguments.\n\n       We affirm the order denying the motion to amend.\n\n\n                                                                           X\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n    '-US^t-y       Aca:                                  tyjud^\n       30 Report of Proceedings (Oct. 30, 2012) at 17.\n                                               12\n\f</pre>",
