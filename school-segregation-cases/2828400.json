Therefore, FPI’s\n  practice of requiring private contractors to purchase FPI\n  furniture as part of a turn-key facility construction does\n  not violate FPI's governing statutes.\n154 F. Supp. 2d at 1155-56.\n  The district court’s straightforward response to the issue at\nbar is directly on target. The plain language of section\n4122(a) prohibits sales “to the public,” but only “in\ncompetition with private enterprise.” 18 U.S.C. § 4122 (a).\nAs discussed in the context of the Coalition’s takings claim,\nthe public competes for the federal Office Furniture market\nonly to the extent UNICOR is not a mandatory source of\nsupply. Therefore, a sale to a private sector contractor as a\nmeans to enforce its statutory and regulatory mandatory\nsource of supply for federal agencies and departments\nnecessarily falls within UNICOR’s authority. As the district\ncourt definitively stated, “common sense” demonstrates that\nthe actual purchaser in this context is the federal agency or\ndepartment.\n  The Court recognizes the potential for abuse with\nUNICOR’s practice, although no actual improprieties have\nbeen demonstrated in case sub judice. The Coalition’s\nremedy rests not with the courts, but with the legislature.\n  VIII. CONCLUSION\n  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the order of the\ndistrict court, except those provisions concerning Count VIII\nof the complaint (the “Pass-Through Furniture” claim). With\nrespect to Count VIII, we REMAND the matter to the district\ncourt with instructions to VACATE its decision consistent\nwith our Opinion.\n\f",

L. No. 107-314, 116 Stat. 2458 (2002), that             constructing a facility. To allow a federal agency to\nmooted the Coalition’s claim. See (Letter from Assistant U.S.             escape the legal requirement of obtaining a waiver or\nAttorney Charles R. Gross, filed Feb. 3, 2003.) The notice                purchasing furniture from FPI simply by purchasing\nindicated that the legislation provided that private sector               furniture produced in the private sector using a\ncontractors employed on projects for the Department of                    subcontractor as a middle-man would subvert the will of\nDefense (“DOD”)were “permitted, but [] not required, to                   Congress. Moreover, when FPI engages in this practice,\npurchase products or services from UNICOR.” Id.                           it is not selling goods to the private sector because title\n                                                                          for those goods passes directly to the federal agency for\n\fNo. 01-2231    Coalition for Gov’t Procurement, et al.      89\n               v. Federal Prison Industries, Inc., et al.\n\n  whom the facility is being constructed. Therefore, FPI’s\n  practice of requiring private contractors to purchase FPI\n  furniture as part of a turn-key facility construction does\n  not violate FPI's governing statutes.\n154 F. Supp. 2d at 1155-56.\n  The district court’s straightforward response to the issue at\nbar is directly on target. The plain language of section\n4122(a) prohibits sales “to the public,” but only “in\ncompetition with private enterprise.” 18 U.S.C. § 4122 (a).\nAs discussed in the context of the Coalition’s takings claim,\nthe public competes for the federal Office Furniture market\nonly to the extent UNICOR is not a mandatory source of\nsupply. Therefore, a sale to a private sector contractor as a\nmeans to enforce its statutory and regulatory mandatory\nsource of supply for federal agencies and departments\nnecessarily falls within UNICOR’s authority. As the district\ncourt definitively stated, “common sense” demonstrates that\nthe actual purchaser in this context is the federal agency or\ndepartment.\n  The Court recognizes the potential for abuse with\nUNICOR’s practice, although no actual improprieties have\nbeen demonstrated in case sub judice. The Coalition’s\nremedy rests not with the courts, but with the legislature.\n  VIII. CONCLUSION\n  For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the order of the\ndistrict court, except those provisions concerning Count VIII\nof the complaint (the “Pass-Through Furniture” claim). With\nrespect to Count VIII, we REMAND the matter to the district\ncourt with instructions to VACATE its decision consistent\nwith our Opinion.\n\f</pre>",
