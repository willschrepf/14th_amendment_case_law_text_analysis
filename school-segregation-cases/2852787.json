Moran Judge.\n\nArgued January 17, 2002--Decided March 5, 2002\n\n\n\n  Before Flaum, Chief Judge, and Bauer, and\nEasterbrook, Circuit Judges.\n\n  Flaum, Chief Judge. Thirteen-year-old\nBeth B. and her parents appeal the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary\njudgment to the Lake Bluff School\nDistrict, affirming an administrative\ndecision that upheld the school\ndistrict’s recommendation to place Beth\nin a special education classroom. Beth is\nseverely mentally and physically\nchallenged. Her parents have long been\nfighting a battle to keep her in the\nregular education classroom: In 1997, the\nschool district first recommended that\nBeth continue her schooling in a special\neducation, or Educational Life Skills\n(\"ELS\"), program--a placement with which\nher parents disagreed. When it became\nclear that they and the district could\nnot reach a mutually satisfactory\nsolution, they requested a due process\nhearing under sec.1415(f) of the\nIndividuals with Disabilities Education\nAct (\"IDEA,\" or \"the Act\"), 20 U.S.C.\nsec.1400 et seq. The hearing commenced on\nOctober 25, 1999; in May 2000, the\nhearing officer ruled in favor of the\nschool district. Beth’s parents sought\n\freview in the district court and, on\nSeptember 10, 2001, the court affirmed\nthe hearing officer’s conclusion,\ngranting Lake Bluff’s motion for summary\njudgment. Beth and her parents now appeal\nto us. We recognize the difficult\ndecisions that Beth’s parents face, and\nwe appreciate the care and commitment\nwith which they participate in their\ndaughter’s education. However, after\nlooking to the language of the IDEA and\nthe congressional intent behind it, we\nconclude that the school district’s\nplacement does not violate the Act. For\nthe reasons stated herein, we affirm the\ndecision of the district court.\n\nI.   Background\n\n  Beth has Rett Syndrome, a neurological\ndisorder that almost exclusively affects\ngirls. It results in severe disabilities,\nboth cognitive and physical. Beth is\nnonverbal; she uses an instrument called\nan eye gaze, a board with various\npictures and symbols that she singles out\nwith eye contact, to communicate her\nwants and needs, as well as other\ncommunication devices that allow her to\nchoose among symbols or to hear messages\nrecorded by others. She relies on a\nwheelchair for mobility. She, like nearly\nall Rett sufferers, has an extreme lack\nof control over body movement. Although\nher mental capacity is difficult to\nassess precisely, due to her extreme\ncommunicative and motor impairments, some\nexperts contend that she has the\ncognitive ability of a twelve-to-\neighteen-month old infant. Others\nestimate that she has the ability of a\nfour-to-six-year old. She is unable to\nread or recognize numbers.\n\n  Beth has been educated in regular\nclassrooms at her neighborhood public\nschool for seven years. She is currently\nin the seventh grade at Lake Bluff Middle\nSchool with other thirteen-year-old\nchildren. Students in the seventh grade\nattend six 42-minute classes a day. They\nhave three-minute passing periods between\nclass. Beth’s aides help her travel from\nroom to room during the passing periods,\nalthough it is extremely difficult for\nher to do so in such a short time frame.\nSince the first grade, Beth has worked\nwith a one-on-one aide at all times and\nhas used an individualized curriculum\ntied in subject matter, as much as\n\fpossible, to that of the other students\nin the class. Beth’s current curriculum\nis geared toward someone at a preschool\nlevel. When her peers worked on\nmathematics, she was exposed to various\nnumbers. When the class studied\nmeteorology and weather patterns, she\nlooked at pictures of clouds. Beth cannot\nparticipate in class discussions or\nlectures.\n\n  The school district held an annual\nconference with Beth’s parents, teachers,\nand district administrators to review\nBeth’s individualized education program\n(\"IEP\"). After her second grade year, the\nschool district recommended at her IEP\nmeeting that Beth be placed in an ELS\nsetting. No appropriate special education\nenvironment exists in the Lake Bluff\nDistrict; Beth would have to attend\nschool in a neighboring school\ndistrict/1. The ELS program recommended\nby the district would be located in a\npublic school building and would serve\nstudents between the ages of six and\ntwenty one with mild, moderate, or severe\nhandicaps. Generally, six to eight\nstudents comprise one ELS classroom, and\nthe student-teacher ratio is one-to-one.\nELS students in the program are\nmainstreamed into regular education\nclassrooms during music, library, art,\ncomputer, and certain social studies and\nscience classes, and join other students\nat the school during lunch, recess,\nassemblies, and field trips.\nAdditionally, reverse mainstreaming is\nemployed; that is, regular education\nstudents come into the ELS classroom to\nallow for interaction between ELS and\nnon-ELS students.\n  Beth’s parents disagreed with Beth’s\nplacement in an ELS program, requested a\ndue process review under the IDEA, and\ninvoked the Act’s stay-put provision,\nwhich has allowed Beth to remain in the\nregular classroom at her neighborhood\nschool pending the resolution of this\nlitigation. 20 U.S.C. sec.1415(j).\n\nII.   Discussion\n\n  Beth’s parents argue that the school\ndistrict’s placement of Beth in an ELS\nclassroom violates the IDEA./2 The\ndistrict court erred, they contend, in\nupholding the administrative decision\nfinding otherwise. Although we review the\nschool board’s ultimate decision de novo\n\fbecause it is a mixed question of law and\nfact, we will reverse only if the\ndistrict court’s findings were clearly\nerroneous, absent a mistake of law.\nLaGrange, 184 F.3d at 915.\n\nA. Deference to the Findings of the\nAdministrative Hearing Officer\n\n  We find as an initial matter that the\ndistrict court gave proper weight to the\nfindings of the hearing officer at the\nadministrative proceedings. Because\nschool authorities are better suited than\nare federal judges to determine\neducational policy, the district court is\nrequired, in its independent evaluation\nof the evidence, to give due deference to\nthe results of the administrative\nproceedings. Id. (citing Heather S. v.\nWisconsin, 125 F.3d 1045 (7th Cir.\n1997)). The hearing officer correctly\napplied the burden of proof and found\nthat the district satisfactorily showed\nthat its proposed IEP was adequate under\nthe IDEA. The district was not required\nto prove that Beth received no\neducational benefit at her local school,\nas her parents suggest. We also find that\nthe hearing officer did not err as a\nmatter of law in failing to consider\nwhether the ELS placement was the least\nrestrictive environment;/3 he did\nconsider whether it was the least\nrestrictive appropriate environment, that\nis, whether Beth would be mainstreamed to\nthe maximum extent appropriate--the\nproper question under the LRE analysis\ndiscussed below. The district court,\ntherefore, did not err in giving\ndeference to the administrative decision\nafter independently evaluating the\nevidence and even, in this case, updating\nit with an evidentiary hearing.\n\nB. The IDEA\n\n  The IDEA, enacted in 1975 as The\nEducation of All Handicapped Children’s\nAct, entitles all children with\ndisabilities to access to public\neducation. Pub. L. No. 94-142, 89 Stat.\n773 (1975). It conditions federal funding\nfor educating disabled children on a\nstate’s compliance with certain\nconditions. A school district must\nprovide such children with a free\nappropriate public education (\"FAPE\"), 20\nU.S.C. sec.1412(1), together, to the\nmaximum extent appropriate, with\n\fnondisabled children (\"least restrictive\nenvironment\" or \"LRE\"). 20 U.S.C.\nsec.1412(5). The FAPE provision and LRE\nprovision are two sides of the same IEP\ncoin. The first requirement is absolute\nand focuses on the school district’s\nproposed placement--here, the ELS\nprogram; the second is relative and\nconcentrates on other placement options--\nhere, keeping Beth in the regular\nclassroom. The LRE requirement shows\nCongress’s strong preference in favor of\nmainstreaming, LaGrange, 184 F.3d at 915,\nbut does not require, or even suggest,\ndoing so when the regular classroom\nsetting provides an unsatisfactory\neducation. 34 C.F.R. sec.300.550(b)(2)\n(\"[S]pecial classes, separate schooling\nor other removal of children with\ndisabilities from the regular educational\nenvironment occurs only if the nature or\nseverity of the disability is such that\neducation in regular classes with the use\nof supplementary aids and services cannot\nbe achieved satisfactorily.\").\n\n1.   FAPE\n\n  We agree with the district court and the\nhearing officer, and find that the\ndistrict’s recommendation to place Beth\nin an ELS classroom satisfies the FAPE\nrequirement. In determining whether the\ndistrict’s placement of Beth meets the\nstandard, we must ask: \"First, has the\nState complied with the procedures set\nforth in the Act? And second, is the\nindividualized educational program\ndeveloped through the Act’s procedures\nreasonably calculated to enable the child\nto receive educational benefits?\" Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206-07\n(1982). No one contests that the program\nrecommended during Beth’s IEP review\npasses muster under this test; the FAPE\nmandate is, therefore, not at issue. Its\ndiscussion is required, however, because\nof the confusion that ensues when\nlanguage from the FAPE requirement and\nanalysis is misapplied to the LRE\ninquiry.\n\n  Beth’s parents confuse the FAPE side of\nthe coin with the LRE side. They contend\nthat Beth’s current placement satisfies\nthe Rowley standard because she received\nan educational benefit at Lake Bluff\nMiddle School. So long as the regular\nclassroom confers \"some educational\nbenefit\" to Beth, they argue, 458 U.S. at\n\f200, the school district cannot remove\nher from that setting. This language is\nmisplaced. The Rowley holding applies\nonly to the school district’s\nresponsibility to provide a FAPE--a\nrequirement that analyzes the\nappropriateness of the district’s\nplacement--not the appropriateness of the\nELS alternatives, including the regular\neducation classroom. As the district\ncourt properly noted, the FAPE\ndetermination is at the threshold of the\nplacement inquiry. Only with the\nsubsequent LRE analysis does the question\nof the educational benefit to Beth in the\nregular classroom arise; in that context,\nthe Rowley language does not apply. See\nalso Daniel R.R. v. Bd. of Educ., 874\nF.2d 1036, 1045 (5th Cir. 1989); A.W. v.\nNorthwest R-1 School Dist., 813 F.2d 158,\n163 (8th Cir. 1987); Roncker v. Walter,\n700 F.2d 1058, 1063 (6th Cir. 1983).\n\n2.  LRE\n  The core of this dispute involves\nwhether the school district’s decision to\nplace Beth in an ELS classroom violates\nthe LRE provision of the IDEA. Under this\nclause, the district must mainstream\nBeth--that is, provide her an education\nwith her nondisabled peers--to the\n\"greatest extent appropriate.\" 20 U.S.C.\nsec.1412(5). Again, Congress used the\nmodifier \"appropriate\" in stating the\nrequirements of the Act, limiting its\nmainstreaming mandate. The regular class\nroom would be a less restrictive\nenvironment than the ELS classroom. That\npoint is not at issue, however, because\nthe Lake Bluff school district is not\nrequired to educate Beth in such an\nenvironment unless doing so would be\nappropriate. The Supreme Court, although\nit has not yet interpreted the language\nof the LRE provision, has stated that\n\"[t]he Act’s use of the word\n’appropriate’ thus seems to reflect\nCongress’ recognition that some settings\nsimply are not suitable environments for\nthe participation of some handicapped\nchildren.\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 197 n. 21.\nThis case turns, then, on whether\neducating Beth in the regular classroom\n(or, more appropriately in the middle\nschool setting, classrooms) would be\nappropriate.\n\n  The relevant IDEA regulation provides\nthat children may not be removed from the\nregular classroom unless their education\n\fthere, with the use of supplementary aids\nand services, cannot be achieved\nsatisfactorily. 34 C.F.R.\nsec.300.550(b)(2). This preference for\nmainstreaming demands a hard look and a\ncareful analysis of the education Beth\nwas receiving at Lake Bluff Middle\nSchool. Beth’s parents rely on misplaced\nlanguage from Rowley to argue that so\nlong as she was receiving any benefit--\nimprovement in eye contact, or progress\nin responding to a request to \"look\" or\n\"touch\"--her removal would violate the\nLRE requirement. We cannot agree with\nthis definition of satisfactory\neducation.\n\n  Rowley requires, in its analysis of the\nFAPE provision, \"that the education to\nwhich access is provided be sufficient to\nconfer some educational benefit upon the\nhandicapped child.\" 458 U.S. at 200. The\nCourt’s rationale behind using this\nstandard was \"to leave the selection of\neducational policy and methods where they\ntraditionally have resided--with state\nand local school officials.\" Daniel R.R.,\n874 F.2d at 1044 (citing Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 207). The standard is intended to give\nschool districts \"flexibility in\neducational planning.\" Id. By applying it\nto the LRE directive and arguing that the\nschool district cannot remove Beth from\nthe regular classroom if she receives any\nbenefit there, Beth’s parents turn the\n\"some educational benefit\" language on\nits head. Instead of granting flexibility\nto educators and school officials, it\nplaces an extreme restriction on their\npolicymaking authority and the deference\nthey are owed; it essentially vitiates\nschool districts’ authority to place any\ndisabled children in separate special\neducation environments. Neither Congress\nnor the Supreme Court intended such a\nresult. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181, fn. 4\n(\"Congress recognized that regular\nclassrooms simply would not be a suitable\nsetting for the education of many\nhandicapped children.\").\n\n  Each student’s educational situation is\nunique. We find it unnecessary at this\npoint in time to adopt a formal test for\ndistrict courts uniformly to apply when\ndeciding LRE cases. The Act itself\nprovides enough of a framework for our\ndiscussion; if Beth’s education at Lake\nBluff Middle School was satisfactory, the\nschool district would be in violation of\n\fthe Act by removing her. If not, if its\nrecommended placement will mainstream her\nto the maximum appropriate extent, no\nviolation occurs. In this case we can say\nwith confidence that the Lake Bluff\nschool district’s decision to remove Beth\nfrom her regular school did not violate\nthe IDEA’s mandate to mainstream disabled\nchildren to the maximum extent\nappropriate. Beth was in class for about\nfifty percent of each day. Her academic\nprogress was virtually nonexistent and\nher developmental progress was limited.\nAlthough the school district provided her\nwith aides, communication devices,\ncomputerized books, and an individual\ncurriculum, she was receiving very little\nbenefit from her time there.\n\n  We agree with the school district’s\ndecision that a modicum of developmental\nachievement does not constitute a\nsatisfactory education. The ELS\nclassroom, so long as it includes reverse\nmainstreaming opportunities, as well as\ntime spent with nondisabled peers in\nnonacademic classes, during special\nprojects, lunch, and the like, is at an\nacceptable point along the \"continuum of\nservices\" between total integration and\ncomplete segregation, and satisfies the\nrequirement that Beth be mainstreamed to\nthe maximum extent appropriate. 34 C.F.R.\nsec.300.551; 20 U.S.C. sec.1412(5). The\nschool officials’ decision about how to\nbest educate Beth is based on expertise\nthat we cannot match. They relied on\nyears of evidence that Beth was not\nreceiving a satisfactory education in the\nregular classroom. The placement shows a\nconcern both for her development and for\nkeeping her mainstreamed, to an\nappropriate extent, with her nondisabled\npeers. We cannot hold that the Lake Bluff\nSchool District has failed to provide her\nwith the free, appropriate public\neducation where she is mainstreamed to\nthe maximum extent appropriate, to which\nshe is entitled under the IDEA. Although\nwe respect the input Beth’s parents have\ngiven regarding her placement and the\ntheir continued participation in IEP\ndecisionmaking, educators \"have the power\nto provide handicapped children with an\neducation they consider more appropriate\nthan that proposed by the parents.\"\nLachman v. Illinois State Bd. of Educ.,\n852 F.2d 290, 297 (7th Cir. 1988). We\nfind that the district’s proposed IEP,\nwhich includes reverse mainstreaming and\n\fprovides that Beth will take part in\ncertain regular-education classes, does\nnot violate the statutory LRE mandate.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n  For the reasons stated herein, we find\nthat the school district’s recommendation\nto place Beth in an ELS classroom does\nnot violate the IDEA. We AFFIRM the\ndecision of the district court.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 It is not yet determined at which school Beth’s\nclassroom will be. The district has recommended\nthat she be placed in an ELS class at a public\njunior high school, several of which are under an\nhour from Beth’s home.\n\n/2 Although the motion granted by the district court\nwas properly labeled one for summary judgment,\nthis type of IDEA decision does not fit neatly\ninto the generic definition of such a disposi-\ntion. Due to the unique procedural posture of\nthese cases, however, summary judgment has been\ndeemed appropriate even when facts are in dis-\npute, and is based on a preponderance of the\nevidence. Bd. of Educ. of LaGrange School Dist.\nNo. 105 v. Illinois State Bd. of Educ., 184 F.3d\n912, 914-15 (1999) (hereinafter LaGrange); A.P.\nv. McGrew, 1998 WL 808879 (N.D. Ill. Nov. 16,\n1998). As the district court below noted, its\ndecision is perhaps better described as judgment\non the record.\n\n/3 In fact, it is undisputed that keeping Beth\nmainstreamed in the regular classroom would be\nless restrictive than placing her in the ELS\nprogram.\n\f",

We also find that\nthe hearing officer did not err as a\nmatter of law in failing to consider\nwhether the ELS placement was the least\nrestrictive environment;/3 he did\nconsider whether it was the least\nrestrictive appropriate environment, that\nis, whether Beth would be mainstreamed to\nthe maximum extent appropriate--the\nproper question under the LRE analysis\ndiscussed below. The district court,\ntherefore, did not err in giving\ndeference to the administrative decision\nafter independently evaluating the\nevidence and even, in this case, updating\nit with an evidentiary hearing.\n\nB. The IDEA\n\n  The IDEA, enacted in 1975 as The\nEducation of All Handicapped Children’s\nAct, entitles all children with\ndisabilities to access to public\neducation. Pub. L. No. 94-142, 89 Stat.\n773 (1975). It conditions federal funding\nfor educating disabled children on a\nstate’s compliance with certain\nconditions. A school district must\nprovide such children with a free\nappropriate public education (\"FAPE\"), 20\nU.S.C. sec.1412(1), together, to the\nmaximum extent appropriate, with\n\fnondisabled children (\"least restrictive\nenvironment\" or \"LRE\"). 20 U.S.C.\nsec.1412(5). The FAPE provision and LRE\nprovision are two sides of the same IEP\ncoin. The first requirement is absolute\nand focuses on the school district’s\nproposed placement--here, the ELS\nprogram; the second is relative and\nconcentrates on other placement options--\nhere, keeping Beth in the regular\nclassroom. The LRE requirement shows\nCongress’s strong preference in favor of\nmainstreaming, LaGrange, 184 F.3d at 915,\nbut does not require, or even suggest,\ndoing so when the regular classroom\nsetting provides an unsatisfactory\neducation. 34 C.F.R. sec.300.550(b)(2)\n(\"[S]pecial classes, separate schooling\nor other removal of children with\ndisabilities from the regular educational\nenvironment occurs only if the nature or\nseverity of the disability is such that\neducation in regular classes with the use\nof supplementary aids and services cannot\nbe achieved satisfactorily.\").\n\n1.   FAPE\n\n  We agree with the district court and the\nhearing officer, and find that the\ndistrict’s recommendation to place Beth\nin an ELS classroom satisfies the FAPE\nrequirement. In determining whether the\ndistrict’s placement of Beth meets the\nstandard, we must ask: \"First, has the\nState complied with the procedures set\nforth in the Act? And second, is the\nindividualized educational program\ndeveloped through the Act’s procedures\nreasonably calculated to enable the child\nto receive educational benefits?\" Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206-07\n(1982). No one contests that the program\nrecommended during Beth’s IEP review\npasses muster under this test; the FAPE\nmandate is, therefore, not at issue. Its\ndiscussion is required, however, because\nof the confusion that ensues when\nlanguage from the FAPE requirement and\nanalysis is misapplied to the LRE\ninquiry.\n\n  Beth’s parents confuse the FAPE side of\nthe coin with the LRE side. They contend\nthat Beth’s current placement satisfies\nthe Rowley standard because she received\nan educational benefit at Lake Bluff\nMiddle School. So long as the regular\nclassroom confers \"some educational\nbenefit\" to Beth, they argue, 458 U.S. at\n\f200, the school district cannot remove\nher from that setting. This language is\nmisplaced. The Rowley holding applies\nonly to the school district’s\nresponsibility to provide a FAPE--a\nrequirement that analyzes the\nappropriateness of the district’s\nplacement--not the appropriateness of the\nELS alternatives, including the regular\neducation classroom. As the district\ncourt properly noted, the FAPE\ndetermination is at the threshold of the\nplacement inquiry. Only with the\nsubsequent LRE analysis does the question\nof the educational benefit to Beth in the\nregular classroom arise; in that context,\nthe Rowley language does not apply.

Bd. of Educ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"523168\"><a href=\"/opinion/523168/daniel-rr-v-state-board-of-education-el-paso-independent-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1045 (5th Cir. 1989); A.W. v.\nNorthwest R-1 School Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">813</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n163 (8th Cir. 1987); Roncker v.

LRE\n  The core of this dispute involves\nwhether the school district’s decision to\nplace Beth in an ELS classroom violates\nthe LRE provision of the IDEA. Under this\nclause, the district must mainstream\nBeth--that is, provide her an education\nwith her nondisabled peers--to the\n\"greatest extent appropriate.\" 20 U.S.C.\nsec.1412(5). Again, Congress used the\nmodifier \"appropriate\" in stating the\nrequirements of the Act, limiting its\nmainstreaming mandate. The regular class\nroom would be a less restrictive\nenvironment than the ELS classroom. That\npoint is not at issue, however, because\nthe Lake Bluff school district is not\nrequired to educate Beth in such an\nenvironment unless doing so would be\nappropriate. The Supreme Court, although\nit has not yet interpreted the language\nof the LRE provision, has stated that\n\"[t]he Act’s use of the word\n’appropriate’ thus seems to reflect\nCongress’ recognition that some settings\nsimply are not suitable environments for\nthe participation of some handicapped\nchildren.\" Rowley, 458 U.S. at 197 n. 21.\nThis case turns, then, on whether\neducating Beth in the regular classroom\n(or, more appropriately in the middle\nschool setting, classrooms) would be\nappropriate.\n\n  The relevant IDEA regulation provides\nthat children may not be removed from the\nregular classroom unless their education\n\fthere, with the use of supplementary aids\nand services, cannot be achieved\nsatisfactorily. 34 C.F.R.\nsec.300.550(b)(2). This preference for\nmainstreaming demands a hard look and a\ncareful analysis of the education Beth\nwas receiving at Lake Bluff Middle\nSchool. Beth’s parents rely on misplaced\nlanguage from Rowley to argue that so\nlong as she was receiving any benefit--\nimprovement in eye contact, or progress\nin responding to a request to \"look\" or\n\"touch\"--her removal would violate the\nLRE requirement. We cannot agree with\nthis definition of satisfactory\neducation.\n\n  Rowley requires, in its analysis of the\nFAPE provision, \"that the education to\nwhich access is provided be sufficient to\nconfer some educational benefit upon the\nhandicapped child.\" 458 U.S. at 200. The\nCourt’s rationale behind using this\nstandard was \"to leave the selection of\neducational policy and methods where they\ntraditionally have resided--with state\nand local school officials.\" Daniel R.R.,\n874 F.2d at 1044 (citing Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 207). The standard is intended to give\nschool districts \"flexibility in\neducational planning.\" Id. By applying it\nto the LRE directive and arguing that the\nschool district cannot remove Beth from\nthe regular classroom if she receives any\nbenefit there, Beth’s parents turn the\n\"some educational benefit\" language on\nits head. Instead of granting flexibility\nto educators and school officials, it\nplaces an extreme restriction on their\npolicymaking authority and the deference\nthey are owed; it essentially vitiates\nschool districts’ authority to place any\ndisabled children in separate special\neducation environments. Neither Congress\nnor the Supreme Court intended such a\nresult. Rowley, 458 U.S. at 181, fn. 4\n(\"Congress recognized that regular\nclassrooms simply would not be a suitable\nsetting for the education of many\nhandicapped children.\").\n\n  Each student’s educational situation is\nunique. We find it unnecessary at this\npoint in time to adopt a formal test for\ndistrict courts uniformly to apply when\ndeciding LRE cases. The Act itself\nprovides enough of a framework for our\ndiscussion; if Beth’s education at Lake\nBluff Middle School was satisfactory, the\nschool district would be in violation of\n\fthe Act by removing her. If not, if its\nrecommended placement will mainstream her\nto the maximum appropriate extent, no\nviolation occurs. In this case we can say\nwith confidence that the Lake Bluff\nschool district’s decision to remove Beth\nfrom her regular school did not violate\nthe IDEA’s mandate to mainstream disabled\nchildren to the maximum extent\nappropriate. Beth was in class for about\nfifty percent of each day. Her academic\nprogress was virtually nonexistent and\nher developmental progress was limited.\nAlthough the school district provided her\nwith aides, communication devices,\ncomputerized books, and an individual\ncurriculum, she was receiving very little\nbenefit from her time there.\n\n  We agree with the school district’s\ndecision that a modicum of developmental\nachievement does not constitute a\nsatisfactory education. The ELS\nclassroom, so long as it includes reverse\nmainstreaming opportunities, as well as\ntime spent with nondisabled peers in\nnonacademic classes, during special\nprojects, lunch, and the like, is at an\nacceptable point along the \"continuum of\nservices\" between total integration and\ncomplete segregation, and satisfies the\nrequirement that Beth be mainstreamed to\nthe maximum extent appropriate. 34 C.F.R.\nsec.300.551; 20 U.S.C. sec.1412(5). The\nschool officials’ decision about how to\nbest educate Beth is based on expertise\nthat we cannot match. They relied on\nyears of evidence that Beth was not\nreceiving a satisfactory education in the\nregular classroom. The placement shows a\nconcern both for her development and for\nkeeping her mainstreamed, to an\nappropriate extent, with her nondisabled\npeers. We cannot hold that the Lake Bluff\nSchool District has failed to provide her\nwith the free, appropriate public\neducation where she is mainstreamed to\nthe maximum extent appropriate, to which\nshe is entitled under the IDEA. Although\nwe respect the input Beth’s parents have\ngiven regarding her placement and the\ntheir continued participation in IEP\ndecisionmaking, educators \"have the power\nto provide handicapped children with an\neducation they consider more appropriate\nthan that proposed by the parents.\"\nLachman v. Illinois State Bd. of Educ.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"509040\"><a href=\"/opinion/509040/ronald-lachman-and-mary-ann-lachman-on-behalf-of-benjamin-lachman-a-minor/\"><span class=\"volume\">852</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 297 (7th Cir. 1988). We\nfind that the district’s proposed IEP,\nwhich includes reverse mainstreaming and\n\fprovides that Beth will take part in\ncertain regular-education classes, does\nnot violate the statutory LRE mandate.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n  For the reasons stated herein, we find\nthat the school district’s recommendation\nto place Beth in an ELS classroom does\nnot violate the IDEA. We AFFIRM the\ndecision of the district court.\n\nFOOTNOTES\n\n/1 It is not yet determined at which school Beth’s\nclassroom will be. The district has recommended\nthat she be placed in an ELS class at a public\njunior high school, several of which are under an\nhour from Beth’s home.\n\n/2 Although the motion granted by the district court\nwas properly labeled one for summary judgment,\nthis type of IDEA decision does not fit neatly\ninto the generic definition of such a disposi-\ntion. Due to the unique procedural posture of\nthese cases, however, summary judgment has been\ndeemed appropriate even when facts are in dis-\npute, and is based on a preponderance of the\nevidence.
