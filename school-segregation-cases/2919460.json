L. No. 103-465,\n\n§ 514, 108 Stat. 4809, 4976–81 (1994) (codified as amended at 17 U.S.C. §§\n\n104A, 109), which granted copyright protection to various foreign works that\n\nwere previously in the public domain in the United States. The district court\n\ngranted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, concluding that Section 514\n\nviolates plaintiffs’ freedom of expression under the First Amendment. In Case\n\nNo. 09-1234, the government appeals the district court’s order granting plaintiffs’\n\n\n      *\n       The Honorable Richard D. Cudahy, Senior Circuit Judge, United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                         3\n\fmotion for summary judgment and denying the government’s motion, arguing that\n\nSection 514 is a valid, content-neutral regulation of speech. In Case No. 09-1261,\n\nplaintiffs cross-appeal, contending that the statute is facially invalid and that they\n\nare entitled to injunctive relief. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291, we reverse the judgment of the district court and conclude that Section 514\n\nof the URAA is not violative of the First Amendment.\n\n                              I. Statutory Background\n\n      In 1989, the United States joined the Berne Convention for the Protection\n\nof Literary and Artistic Works (“Berne Convention”). The Berne Convention\n\nrequires each signatory to provide the same copyright protections to authors in\n\nother member countries that it provides to its own authors. Pursuant to Article\n\n18, when a country joins the Convention, it must provide copyright protection to\n\npreexisting foreign works even when those works were previously in the public\n\ndomain in that country. 1 However, when the United States joined the Berne\n\n\n      1\n          Article 18 of the Berne Convention provides:\n\n      (1)     This Convention shall apply to all works which, at the moment\n              of its coming into force, have not yet fallen into the public\n              domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the term of\n              protection.\n\n      (2)     If, however, through the expiry of the term of protection which\n              was previously granted, a work has fallen into the public domain\n              of the country where protection is claimed, that work shall not be\n              protected anew.\n                                                                           continue...\n\n                                           4\n\fConvention, the implementing legislation did not extend copyrights to any foreign\n\nworks that were already in the public domain in the United States. See Berne\n\nConvention Implementation Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-568, § 12 , 102 Stat. 2853,\n\n2860 (“Title 17, United States Code, as amended by this Act, does not provide\n\ncopyright protection for any work that is in the public domain in the United\n\nStates.”); see generally 7 William F. Patry, Patry on Copyright § 24:21 (2010).\n\n      In April 1994, the United States signed various trade agreements in the\n\nUruguay Round General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Included in this round\n\nof agreements was the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual\n\nProperty Rights (TRIPs). The TRIPs agreement required, in part, that its\n\nsignatories comply with Article 18 of the Berne Convention, and thus, extend\n\ncopyright protection to all works of foreign origin whose term of protection had\n\nnot expired. Unlike the Berne Convention, the TRIPs agreement provided for\n\n\n\n      1\n          ...continue\n\n      (3)      The application of this principle shall be subject to any\n               provisions contained in special conventions to that effect existing\n               or to be concluded between countries of the Union. In the\n               absence of such provisions, the respective countries shall\n               determine, each in so far as it is concerned, the conditions of\n               application of this principle.\n\n      (4)      The preceding provisions shall also apply in the case of new\n               accessions to the Union . . . .\n\nBerne Convention, art. 18, Sept. 9, 1886 (revised at Paris on July 24, 1971).\n\n                                            5\n\fdispute resolution before the World Trade Organization. See Patry on Copyright\n\nat § 24:1.\n\n      In order to comply with these international agreements, Congress enacted\n\nthe URAA. In particular, Section 514 of the URAA implements Article 18 of the\n\nBerne Convention. Section 514 “restores” 2 copyrights in foreign works that were\n\nformerly in the public domain in the United States for one of three specified\n\nreasons: failure to comply with formalities, lack of subject matter protection, or\n\nlack of national eligibility. See 17 U.S.C. § 104A(a), (h)(6)(C). Section 514 does\n\nnot restore copyrights in foreign works that entered the public domain through the\n\nexpiration of the term of protection. See id. § 104A(h)(6)(B).\n\n      In addition to restoring copyrights in preexisting foreign works, Section\n\n514 provides some protections for reliance parties 3 such as plaintiffs who had\n\n\n      2\n        Although Section 514 grants copyright protection to works that never\nobtained copyrights in the United States, as well as works that lost copyright\nprotection for failing to comply with various formalities, the parties refer to this\nas copyright “restoration,” and the statute likewise refers to “restored works,”\nsee 17 U.S.C. § 104A(h)(6). For clarity and consistency, we will as well.\n      3\n          A “reliance party” is defined as a person who:\n\n      (A) with respect to a particular work, engages in acts, before the source\n      country of that work becomes an eligible country, which would have\n      violated section 106 if the restored work had been subject to copyright\n      protection, and who, after the source country becomes an eligible\n      country, continues to engage in such acts;\n\n      (B) before the source country of a particular work becomes an eligible\n                                                                        continue...\n\n                                          6\n\fexploited these works prior to their restoration. See id. § 104A(d)(2)–(4). In\n\norder to enforce a restored copyright against a reliance party, a foreign copyright\n\nowner must either file notice with the Copyright Office within twenty-four\n\nmonths of restoration, id. § 104A(d)(2)(A)(i), or serve actual notice on the\n\nreliance party, id. § 104A(d)(2)(B)(i). A reliance party is liable for infringing\n\nacts that occur after the end of a twelve month grace period, starting from notice\n\nof restoration, id. § 104A(d)(2)(A)(ii)(I), (d)(2)(B)(ii)(I). Reliance parties may\n\nsell or otherwise dispose of restored works during this grace period, id. § 109(a),\n\nbut they cannot make additional copies during this time, id.\n\n§ 104A(d)(2)(A)(ii)(III), (d)(2)(B)(ii)(III).\n\n      Section 514 provides further protections for reliance parties who, prior to\n\nrestoration, created a derivative work 4 that was based on a restored work. Under\n\n\n      3\n       ...continue\n      country, makes or acquires 1 or more copies or phonorecords of that\n      work; or\n\n      (C) as the result of the sale or other disposition of a derivative work\n      covered under subsection (d)(3), or significant assets of a person\n      described in subparagraph (A) or (B), is a successor, assignee, or\n      licensee of that person.\n\n17 U.S.C. § 104(A)(h)(4).\n      4\n        “A ‘derivative work’ is a work based upon one or more preexisting works,\nsuch as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion\npicture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or\nany other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work\n                                                                         continue...\n\n                                           7\n\fSection 514, “a reliance party may continue to exploit that derivative work for the\n\nduration of the restored copyright if the reliance party pays to the owner of the\n\nrestored copyright reasonable compensation . . . .” Id. § 104A(d)(3)(A). If the\n\nparties are unable to agree on reasonable compensation, a federal court will\n\ndetermine the amount of compensation. See id. § 104A(d)(3)(B).\n\n                    II. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      The factual background is not in dispute. Plaintiffs are orchestra\n\nconductors, educators, performers, publishers, film archivists, and motion picture\n\ndistributors who have relied on artistic works in the public domain for their\n\nlivelihoods. They perform, distribute, and sell public domain works. The late\n\nplaintiff Kapp created a derivative work—a sound recording based on several\n\ncompositions by Dmitri Shostakovich. Section 514 of the URAA provided\n\ncopyright protection to these foreign works, removing them from the public\n\ndomain in the United States. As a result, plaintiffs are either prevented from\n\nusing these works or are required to pay licensing fees to the copyright\n\nholders—fees that are often cost-prohibitive for plaintiffs.\n\n      Plaintiffs filed this action, challenging the constitutionality of the\n\nCopyright Term Extension Act, Pub. L. No 105-298, § 102(b), (d), 112 Stat. 2827,\n\n\n      4\n       ...continue\nconsisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nwhich, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a ‘derivative\nwork’.” 17 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n                                          8\n\f2827–28 (1998), and Section 514 of the URAA, seeking declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief. Initially, the district court granted summary judgment to the\n\ngovernment. On appeal, we concluded that plaintiffs’ challenge to the Copyright\n\nTerm Extension Act was foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Eldred v.\n\nAshcroft, 537 U.S. 186 (2003). See Golan v. Gonzales, 501 F.3d 1179, 1182\n\n(10th Cir. 2007) (“Golan I”). We also held that “[Section] 514 of the URAA\n\nha[d] not exceeded the limitations inherent in the Copyright Clause” of the United\n\nStates Constitution. Id. 5 We recognized that “legislation promulgated pursuant to\n\nthe Copyright Clause must still comport with other express limitations of the\n\nConstitution,” id. at 1187, and concluded that plaintiffs had “shown sufficient free\n\nexpression interests in works removed from the public domain to require First\n\nAmendment scrutiny of [Section] 514,” id. at 1182. We then remanded the case\n\nto the district court to “assess whether [Section] 514 is content-based or content-\n\nneutral,” id. at 1196, and to apply the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny.\n\n      On remand, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The\n\ngovernment and plaintiffs agreed that Section 514 is a content-neutral regulation\n\nof speech, and thus should be subject to intermediate scrutiny. The district court\n\nconcluded that “to the extent Section 514 suppresses the right of reliance parties\n\n\n      5\n        The Constitution provides Congress with the power “To promote the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and\nInventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” U.S.\nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 8.\n\n                                          9\n\fto use works they exploited while the works were in the public domain,” Section\n\n514 was unconstitutional. Golan v. Holder, 611 F. Supp. 2d 1165, 1177 (D. Colo.\n\n2009). Consequently, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary\n\njudgment, and denied the government’s motion.\n\n      The government timely appealed the district court’s order, arguing that\n\nSection 514 of the URAA does not violate the First Amendment. Plaintiffs cross-\n\nappealed, arguing that the district court failed to provide all of the relief that they\n\nrequested. Specifically, plaintiffs request that we adjudicate their facial challenge\n\nto Section 514, direct the district court to enjoin Attorney General Holder from\n\nenforcing the statute, and order the Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters to\n\ncancel the copyright registrations of restored works.\n\n                     III. Government’s Appeal (No. 09-1234)\n\n      “We review de novo challenges to the constitutionality of a statute.” Am.\n\nTarget Adver., Inc. v. Giani, 199 F.3d 1241, 1247 (10th Cir. 2000). Because this\n\ncase implicates the First Amendment, “we have ‘an obligation to make an\n\nindependent examination of the whole record in order to make sure that the\n\njudgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free\n\nexpression.’” Citizens for Peace in Space v. City of Colorado Springs, 477 F.3d\n\n1212, 1219 (10th Cir. 2007) (quoting Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United\n\nStates, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499 (1984)).\n\n      The parties agree that Section 514 of the URAA is a content-neutral\n\n                                           10\n\fregulation of speech, and thus, is subject to intermediate scrutiny. Although their\n\nposition is “not controlling given our special standard of de novo review,” id. at\n\n1220, we agree that Section 514 is a content-neutral regulation of speech.\n\n      In determining whether a regulation is content-neutral or content-based,\n\n“‘the government’s purpose in enacting the regulation is the controlling\n\nconsideration.”’ Z.J. Gifts D-2, L.L.C. v. City of Aurora, 136 F.3d 683, 686\n\n(10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791\n\n(1989) (brackets omitted)). The primary inquiry “is whether the government has\n\nadopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it\n\nconveys.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 791. “If the regulation serves purposes unrelated to\n\nthe content of expression it is considered neutral, even if it has an incidental\n\neffect on some speakers or messages but not others.” Z.J. Gifts, 136 F.3d at 686\n\n(quotations and citation omitted). On its face, Section 514 is content-neutral.\n\nMoreover, there is no indication that the government adopted Section 514\n\n“‘because of agreement or disagreement with the message [that the regulated\n\nspeech] conveys.”’ See Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 642\n\n(1994) (“Turner I”) (brackets omitted, quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 791). Congress\n\nprimarily enacted Section 514 to comply with the United States’ international\n\nobligations and to protect American authors’ rights abroad. Therefore, we agree\n\nthat it is a content-neutral regulation.\n\n      In reviewing the constitutionality of a content-neutral regulation of speech,\n\n                                           11\n\fwe apply “an intermediate level of scrutiny, because in most cases [such\n\nregulations] pose a less substantial risk of excising certain ideas or viewpoints\n\nfrom the public dialogue.” Id. (internal citation omitted). Applying intermediate\n\nscrutiny, a content-neutral statute “will be sustained under the First Amendment if\n\nit advances important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free\n\nspeech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further\n\nthose interests.” Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. 180, 189 (1997)\n\n(“Turner II”).\n\n      The government argues on appeal that Section 514 is narrowly tailored to\n\nadvancing three important governmental interests: (1) attaining indisputable\n\ncompliance with international treaties and multilateral agreements, (2) obtaining\n\nlegal protections for American copyright holders’ interests abroad, and (3)\n\nremedying past inequities of foreign authors who lost or never obtained\n\ncopyrights in the United States. We hold that the government has demonstrated a\n\nsubstantial interest in protecting American copyright holders’ interests abroad,\n\nand Section 514 is narrowly tailored to advance that interest. 6 Consequently, the\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that Section 514 violates plaintiffs’ First\n\n\n      6\n         Accordingly, we do not reach the validity of the government’s first or\nthird asserted interests, i.e., that Section 514 advances the government’s interest\nin “indisputable compliance” with the Berne Convention, Appellant’s Br. at 30, or\nthat it remedies historic inequities of foreign authors who lost or never obtained\ncopyrights in the United States. We offer no opinion on whether these asserted\ninterests, by themselves, are sufficient to withstand intermediate scrutiny.\n\n                                          12\n\fAmendment rights.\n\n                              A. Governmental Interest\n\n  1. Section 514 addresses a substantial or important governmental interest.\n\n       In order for a statute to survive intermediate scrutiny, the statute must be\n\ndirected at an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the\n\nsuppression of free expression. See Turner I, 512 U.S. at 662. We have no\n\ndifficulty in concluding that the government’s interest in securing protections\n\nabroad for American copyright holders satisfies this standard.\n\n       Copyright serves to advance both the economic and expressive interests of\n\nAmerican authors. See Eldred, 537 U.S. at 211–13. In addition to creating\n\neconomic incentives that further expression, copyright also serves authors’ First\n\nAmendment interests. “[F]reedom of thought and expression ‘includes both the\n\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.’” Harper &\n\nRow Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enter., 471 U.S. 539, 559 (1985) (quoting Wooley\n\nv. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977)); see also Eldred, 537 U.S. at 221. “Courts\n\nand commentators have recognized that copyright . . . serve[s] this countervailing\n\nFirst Amendment value” of the freedom not to speak. Harper & Row, 471 U.S. at\n\n560.\n\n       Plaintiffs contend that the government does not have an important interest\n\nin a “reallocation of speech interests” between American reliance parties and\n\nAmerican copyright holders. Appellees’ Br. at 48. However, the Supreme Court\n\n                                          13\n\fhas recognized that not all First Amendment interests are equal. See Eldred, 537\n\nU.S. at 221. “The First Amendment securely protects the freedom to make—or\n\ndecline to make—one’s own speech; it bears less heavily when speakers assert the\n\nright to make other people’s speeches.” Id. Although plaintiffs have First\n\nAmendment interests, see Golan I, 501 F.3d at 1194, so too do American authors.\n\n      Securing foreign copyrights for American works preserves the authors’\n\neconomic and expressive interests. These interests are at least as important or\n\nsubstantial as other interests that the Supreme Court has found to be sufficiently\n\nimportant or substantial to satisfy intermediate scrutiny. See, e.g., Members of\n\nCity Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 807 (1984) (“The problem\n\naddressed by this ordinance–the visual assault . . . presented by an accumulation\n\nof signs posted on public property–constitutes a significant substantive evil within\n\nthe City’s power to prohibit.”). Accordingly, Section 514 advances an important\n\nor substantial governmental interest unrelated to the suppression of free\n\nexpression.\n\n                      2. Section 514 addresses a real harm.\n\n      The government’s asserted interest cannot be merely important in the\n\nabstract—the statute must be directed at a real, and not merely conjectural, harm.\n\nTurner I, 512 U.S. at 664 (plurality opinion). Thus, we must examine whether\n\nSection 514 was “designed to address a real harm, and whether [it] will alleviate\n\n[that harm] in a material way.” See Turner II, 520 U.S. at 195. In undertaking\n\n                                         14\n\fthis review, we “must accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of\n\nCongress. Our sole obligation is to assure that, in formulating its judgments,\n\nCongress has drawn reasonable inferences based on substantial evidence.” Id.\n\n(quotations and citation omitted).\n\n      “[S]ubstantiality is to be measured in this context by a standard more\n\ndeferential than we accord to judgments of an administrative agency.” Id. This\n\ndeferential standard is warranted for two important reasons. First, Congress is\n\n“far better equipped” as an institution “to amass and evaluate the vast amounts of\n\ndata bearing upon the legislative questions.” Id. (quotations and citation\n\nomitted). Second, we owe Congress “an additional measure of deference out of\n\nrespect for its authority to exercise the legislative power.” Id. at 196.\n\n      Even in the realm of First Amendment questions where Congress must\n      base its conclusions upon substantial evidence, deference must be\n      accorded to its findings as to the harm to be avoided and to the remedial\n      measures adopted for that end, lest we infringe on traditional legislative\n      authority to make predictive judgments . . . .\n\nId.\n\n      Additionally, the other branches’ judgments regarding foreign affairs\n\nwarrant special deference from the courts. See Citizens for Peace in Space, 477\n\nF.3d at 1221 (“Courts have historically given special deference to other branches\n\nin matters relating to foreign affairs, international relations, and national security;\n\neven when constitutional rights are invoked by a plaintiff.”). The Supreme Court\n\nhas “consistently acknowledged that the nuances of the foreign policy of the\n\n                                          15\n\fUnited States are much more the province of the Executive Branch and Congress\n\nthan of [the courts].” Crosby v. Nat’l Foreign Trade Council, 530 U.S. 363, 386\n\n(2000) (quotations and alterations omitted); see also Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S.\n\n222, 242 (1984) (noting the “classical deference to the political branches in\n\nmatters of foreign policy”); First Nat’l City Bank v. Banco Nacional de Cuba, 406\n\nU.S. 759, 765 (1972) (discussing the “judicial deference to the exclusive power of\n\nthe Executive over conduct of relations with other sovereign powers and the\n\npower of the Senate to advise and consent on the making of treaties”). As such,\n\nwe apply considerable deference to Congress and the Executive in making\n\ndecisions that require predictive judgments in the areas of foreign affairs.\n\n      To be clear, we do not suggest that Congress’s decisions regarding foreign\n\naffairs are entirely immune from the requirements of the First Amendment. See\n\nTurner I, 512 U.S. at 666 (plurality opinion) (“That Congress’ predictive\n\njudgments are entitled to substantial deference does not mean, however, that they\n\nare insulated from meaningful judicial review altogether.”); see also Boos v.\n\nBarry, 485 U.S. 312, 323 (1988) (“[I]t is well established that no agreement with\n\na foreign nation can confer power on the Congress, or on any other branch of\n\nGovernment, which is free from the restraints of the Constitution.” (quotations\n\nand citation omitted)). Rather, we merely acknowledge that in undertaking our\n\nconstitutional review of a content-neutral statute, Congress’s predictive judgments\n\nare entitled to “substantial deference,” Turner II, 520 U.S. at 195, and in this\n\n                                          16\n\fparticular context, our review of Congress’s predictive judgments is further\n\ninformed by the special deference that Congress and the Executive Branch\n\ndeserve in matters of foreign affairs.\n\n      Turning to the issue at hand, prior to enacting Section 514 of the URAA,\n\nCongress heard testimony addressing the interests of American copyright holders.\n\nIn particular, American works were unprotected in several foreign countries, to\n\nthe detriment of the United States’ interests. See General Agreement on Tariffs\n\nand Trade (GATT): Intellectual Property Provisions: Joint Hearing on H.R. 4894\n\nand S. 2368 Before the Subcomm. on Intellectual Property and Judicial\n\nAdministration of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary and the Subcomm. on Patents,\n\nCopyrights, and Trademarks of the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 103d Cong., 2d\n\nSess., 262 (1994) [hereinafter “Joint Hearings”] (statement of Jason S. Berman,\n\nChairman and CEO of the Recording Industry Association of America) (“[T]here\n\nare vastly more US works currently unprotected in foreign markets than foreign\n\nones here, and the economic consequences of [granting retroactive copyright\n\nprotection] are dramatically in favor of US industries.”). 7 By some estimates,\n\nbillions of dollars were being lost each year because foreign countries were not\n\nproviding copyright protections to American works that were in the public domain\n\n\n      7\n        The parties have cited to portions of the Congressional hearings regarding\nthe intellectual property provisions of the Uruguay Round Agreements. We take\njudicial notice of the entirety of these hearings. See Adarand Constructors, Inc.\nv. Slater, 228 F.3d 1147, 1168 n.12 (10th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                         17\n\fabroad. See id. at 246 (statement of Eric Smith, Executive Director and General\n\nCounsel of the International Intellectual Property Alliance) (“Literally billions of\n\ndollars have been and will be lost every year by U.S. authors, producers and\n\npublishers because of the failure of many of our trading partners to protect U.S.\n\nworks which were created prior to the date the U.S. established copyright\n\nrelations with that country, or, for other reasons, these works have fallen\n\nprematurely out of copyright in that country.”).\n\n      Congress had substantial evidence from which it could reasonably conclude\n\nthat the ongoing harms to American authors were real and not merely conjectural.\n\nAround the globe, American works were being exploited without the copyright\n\nowners’ consent and without providing compensation. Thus, there was a\n\n“substantial basis to support Congress’ conclusion that a real threat justified\n\nenactment of” Section 514 of the URAA. See Turner II, 520 U.S. at 196.\n\n   3. Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that Section 514 would\n                            alleviate these harms.\n\n      Next, we must determine whether there was substantial evidence from\n\nwhich Congress could conclude that Section 514 would alleviate these harms to\n\nAmerican copyright holders. See id. at 213. At the Joint Hearings, Congress\n\nheard testimony that by refusing to restore copyrights in foreign works in the\n\npublic domain, the United States was not in compliance with its obligations under\n\nthe Berne Convention. See Joint Hearings at 137 (statement of Ira Shapiro,\n\n\n                                          18\n\fGeneral Counsel, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative) (“It is likely that other\n\n[World Trade Organization] members would challenge the current U.S.\n\nimplementation of Berne Article 18 . . . .”); id at 248 (statement of Eric Smith)\n\n(“Many of our trading partners, particularly in Europe, have made it clear to this\n\ncountry that they consider us in violation of our obligations under Article 18.”).\n\nIn addition, the United States’ refusal to restore foreign copyrights was harming\n\nAmerican authors’ interests abroad: foreign countries were following the United\n\nStates’ example of refusing to restore copyrights in works in the public domain.\n\nSee id. at 137 (statement of Ira Shapiro) (“Some other countries, such as Thailand\n\nand Russia, have refused to protect U.S. works in the public domain in their\n\nterritory citing the U.S. interpretation of Berne Article 18 as justification.”).\n\n      Further, the United States’ trading partners had represented that they would\n\nrestore American copyrights only if the United States restored foreign copyrights.\n\nSee id. at 249 n.2 (statement of Eric Smith) (“The Russian government has made\n\nclear that it will provide retroactive protection for ‘works’ only if the U.S.\n\nreciprocates with retroactive protection for Russian works.”). Foreign countries\n\nwere willing to provide, at most, reciprocal copyright protections to American\n\nworks. See id. at 120 (Appendix to Statement of Bruce Lehman, Assistant\n\nSecretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks) (“When\n\nwe have urged others to provide protection for our industries’ repertoire of\n\nexisting copyrighted works, we are often confronted with the position that such\n\n                                           19\n\fprotection will be provided there when we protect their works in the same manner\n\nhere in the United States. Clearly, providing for such protection for existing\n\nworks in our own law will improve our position in future negotiations.”).\n\nMoreover, the United States had an opportunity to set an example for copyright\n\nrestoration for other countries. See id. at 225 (statement of Irwin Karp, Counsel,\n\nCommittee for Literary Studies) (“U.S. retroactive protection for foreign works in\n\nour public domain may induce other countries with whom we recently established\n\ncopyright relations to grant retroactive protection to contemporary U.S. works\n\nthat previously fell into their public domains.”). Thus, if the United States\n\nwanted certain protections for American authors, it had to provide those\n\nprotections for foreign authors.\n\n       Plaintiffs aver that Congress was presented with evidence regarding the\n\nneed to restore copyrights generally, but that there was no evidence that Congress\n\nneeded to provide limited protections for reliance parties. According to plaintiffs,\n\nthere is “no support for the conclusion that enacting more stringent measures\n\nagainst reliance parties . . . would have any impact whatsoever on the behavior of\n\nforeign countries.” Appellees’ Br. at 46. To the contrary, Congress heard\n\ntestimony that the United States’ chosen method and scope of copyright\n\nrestoration would impact other nations that were similarly deciding how to restore\n\ncopyrights.\n\n      In particular, Congress heard testimony that the United States could set an\n\n                                         20\n\fexample regarding copyright restoration, and other countries might mirror the\n\nUnited States’ approach. For example, Ira Shapiro, General Counsel of the Office\n\nof the United States Trade Representative, testified that “the choices made in our\n\nimplementation of the TRIPs agreement will set an example for other countries as\n\ngovernments decide on their own implementing legislation as well as influence\n\nfuture disputes over the obligations of the Agreement.” Joint Hearings at 136; see\n\nalso id. at 134 (“U.S. leadership in achieving prompt approval of the Uruguay\n\nRound Agreements and effective implementation of the obligations in those\n\nagreements is vital and will set the pattern for other countries to follow.”).\n\nAdditionally, Eric Smith, speaking on behalf of a consortium of trade associations\n\nwhose members represented both American copyright industries and reliance\n\nparties, testified as follows:\n\n             The fact is that what the United States does in this area will carry\n      great weight in the international community. If we interpret Article 18\n      and the TRIPS provisions to deny protection or significantly limit its\n      scope, our trading partners – just now considering their own\n      implementing legislation – will feel free to simply mirror our views. If\n      the largest exporter of copyrighted material in the world takes the\n      position that we have no, or only limited, obligations, the United States\n      will have little credibility in convincing particularly the new nations\n      with whom we are just starting copyright relations to give us the\n      expansive protection that we need.\n\nJoint Hearings at 247 (emphases added); see also id. at 248 (“[T]aking this action\n\nin the ‘implementing’ legislation will convey clearly the view of the U.S. that it\n\nbelieves that other countries are similarly required to adopt the same position in\n\n\n                                          21\n\fpending legislation or otherwise clarify that foreign preexisting works must be\n\nfully recaptured and protected.” (emphases added)); id. at 131 (testimony of Ira\n\nShapiro) (“[A]s the world leader, it is critically important that we implement fully\n\nin the retroactivity area.”); id. at 291 (testimony of Jason S. Berman) (“[T]he\n\nRussians simply said to the United States negotiators . . . that they will interpret\n\ntheir obligations on retroactivity in exactly the same manner that the United\n\nStates interprets its obligations. So what we are doing here, I believe, is\n\nestablishing by virtue of what we do the ground rule for retroactivity.”); id. at 256\n\n(statement of Jack Valenti, President and CEO of the Motion Picture Association\n\nof America) (“If the U.S. ‘retroactively’ protects works from, for example,\n\nRussia, the former Soviet Republics, the former Eastern Bloc countries, South\n\nKorea, China, then we have every reason to expect those countries to protect\n\npreviously produced American creative works.”). Thus, Congress heard\n\ntestimony from a number of witnesses that the United States’ position on the\n\nscope of copyright restoration—which necessarily includes the enforcement\n\nagainst reliance parties—was critical to the United States’ ability to obtain similar\n\nprotections for American copyright holders.\n\n      Further, Congress squarely faced the need to balance the interests of\n\nAmerican copyright holders and American reliance parties. 8 In his opening\n\n\n      8\n          The testimony to Congress was primarily concerned with reliance parties’\n                                                                        continue...\n\n                                          22\n\fremarks, Senator DeConcini stated:\n\n              The conventional wisdom within the U.S. copyright community\n      is that through the restoration of copyright protection to foreign authors\n      we will get more than we give because U.S. authors will be able to\n      retrieve far more works in foreign countries than foreign authors will\n      retrieve here in the United States.\n              ....\n              . . . [I]f we set out to restore copyright protection to foreign\n      works, we must provide protection that is complete and meaningful. By\n      the same token, we must ensure that copyright restoration provides\n      reliance users a sufficient opportunity to recoup their investment.\n\nId. at 81–82 (Statement of Sen. DeConcini). Congress also heard from Eric\n\nSmith, who testified that the bills under consideration would\n\n      provide a careful balance between the need, on the one hand, to\n      establish a “model” provision which other countries could follow in\n      order to secure effective restoration of our copyrights abroad and the\n      need, on the other hand, to balance the rights of foreign authors whose\n      works are restored in the U.S. with the domestic users that may have\n      relied on the public domain status of the work in making investments.\n\nId. at 252.\n\n      In spite of this testimony, plaintiffs contend that the government’s interest\n\nis too speculative to satisfy intermediate scrutiny. Although we require\n\n“substantial evidence” in order to satisfy intermediate scrutiny, see Turner I, 512\n\nU.S. at 667 (plurality opinion), the evidentiary requirement is not as onerous as\n\nplaintiffs would have us impose. The Supreme Court has cautioned that imposing\n\n\n\n      8\n       ...continue\npossible claims under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs\nhave not brought such a claim in the case at bar.\n\n                                         23\n\ftoo strict of an evidentiary requirement on Congress is “an improper burden for\n\ncourts to impose on the Legislative Branch.” Turner II, 520 U.S. at 213\n\n(quotation omitted). An overly demanding “amount of detail is as unreasonable in\n\nthe legislative context as it is constitutionally unwarranted. Congress is not\n\nobligated, when enacting its statutes, to make a record of the type that an\n\nadministrative agency or court does to accommodate judicial review.” Id.\n\n      “Sound policymaking often requires legislators to forecast future events\n\nand to anticipate the likely impact of these events based on deductions and\n\ninferences for which complete empirical support may be unavailable.” Turner I,\n\n512 U.S. at 665 (plurality opinion). Past conduct may be the best—and\n\nsometimes only—evidence available to Congress in making predictive judgments.\n\nCf. Ward, 491 U.S. at 800 (“Absent [the regulation at issue], the city’s interest\n\nwould have been served less well, as is evidenced by the complaints about\n\nexcessive volume generated by respondent’s past concerts.”). We think that this\n\nis especially true in areas that involve predictions of foreign relations and\n\ndiplomacy, where empirical data will rarely be available, and to which\n\nconsiderable deference is owed to Congress and the Executive.\n\n      Plaintiffs direct our attention to evidence in the Congressional record that\n\ncontradicted the view that other countries would follow the United States’\n\napproach to copyright restoration. More specifically, Irwin Karp stated:\n\n             When these countries grant retroactivity, the theory goes, they\n\n                                          24\n\f      will deny their reliance interests real protection – if we do so now. But\n      this is only a theory, and an unlikely one. Most foreign countries,\n      including the Commonwealth countries, already grant us retroactivity.\n      They will not change their laws to restrict protection of their reliance\n      parties. Nor will the few important countries who presently do not\n      retroactively protect U.S. works[.] When they do grant retroactivity\n      they can decide what protection they will grant to their reliance\n      interests. There is nothing to stop them from adopting the British et al\n      buy-out provision.\n\nJoint Hearings at 231; see also id. at 224 (“[T]here is absolutely no guarantee that\n\nthey are stupid enough to adopt the reliance-party provisions you are being asked\n\nto adopt.”). However, as detailed above, this was not the only evidence in the\n\nrecord regarding the potential effect of the United States’ position on copyright\n\nrestoration. Congress also heard testimony that if it wanted foreign countries to\n\nprovide strong protections for American authors, Congress needed to provide like\n\nprotections for foreign authors. See id. at 242 (testimony of Eric Smith) (“With\n\nus taking a strong and principled stand here in this country, we can leverage\n\nretroactive protection abroad. I almost entirely disagree with Mr. Karp on this\n\npoint. I think the chances of us obtaining good retroactive protection is quite\n\nstrong if we have this tool behind us.”).\n\n      Although Congress was presented with evidence that its position on\n\ncopyright restoration might not guarantee reciprocation, it does not follow that\n\nSection 514 is unconstitutional. “The Constitution gives to Congress the role of\n\nweighing conflicting evidence in the legislative process.” Turner II, 520 U.S. at\n\n199. Thus, we must determine “whether, given conflicting views . . ., Congress\n\n                                            25\n\fhad substantial evidence for making the judgment that it did.” Id. at 208. In\n\nother words, “[t]he question is not whether Congress, as an objective matter, was\n\ncorrect to determine” that limited protections for reliance parties were\n\n“necessary” to garner similar protections from foreign countries. See id. at 211.\n\n“Rather, the question is whether the legislative conclusion was reasonable and\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record before Congress.” Id.\n\n      In making that determination, we are not to reweigh the evidence de\n      novo, or to replace Congress’ factual predictions with our own. Rather,\n      we are simply to determine if the standard is satisfied. If it is, summary\n      judgment for [the government] is appropriate regardless of whether the\n      evidence is in conflict.\n\nId. (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n      Considering the deference that Congress is owed, particularly in areas of\n\nforeign relations, we conclude that Congress’s judgments were supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. The testimony before Congress indicated that the United\n\nStates’ historically lax position on copyright restoration had been an obstacle to\n\nthe protection that the United States was seeking for its own copyright owners.\n\nWitnesses further testified that many countries would provide no greater\n\nprotections to American authors than the United States gave to their foreign\n\ncounterparts. There was also testimony that the chosen method of restoring\n\nforeign copyrights would have great weight in the international community and\n\ncould induce other countries to follow the United States’ lead, although Congress\n\nheard some testimony that other countries would not necessarily follow the United\n\n                                          26\n\fStates’ approach. Consequently, Congress was presented with substantial\n\nevidence that Section 514 would advance the government’s interest in protecting\n\nAmerican copyright holders “in a direct and effective way.” See id. at 213\n\n(quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 800). The United States’ ability to protect American\n\nworks abroad would be achieved less effectively absent Section 514, and\n\ntherefore, the government’s interest is genuinely advanced by restoring foreign\n\ncopyrights with limited protections for reliance parties such as plaintiffs.\n\nSee Ward, 491 U.S. at 799.\n\n     B. Section 514 does not burden substantially more speech than necessary.\n\n      Under intermediate scrutiny, we must also determine whether Section 514\n\nis narrowly tailored to further the government’s interests. See Ward, 491 U.S. at\n\n798. “Content-neutral regulations do not pose the same inherent dangers to free\n\nexpression that content-based regulations do,” and therefore, the government has\n\na degree of latitude in choosing how to further its asserted interest. Turner II,\n\n520 U.S. at 213 (quotations and citation omitted). Accordingly, “the\n\n[g]overnment may employ the means of its choosing so long as the regulation\n\npromotes a substantial governmental interest that would be achieved less\n\neffectively absent the regulation and does not burden substantially more speech\n\nthan is necessary to further that interest.” Id. at 213–14 (internal quotations,\n\nellipses, and citation omitted). Further, the regulation need not be the least-\n\nrestrictive alternative of advancing the government’s interest. Id. at 217–18.\n\n                                          27\n\f                       1. Section 514 is narrowly tailored.\n\n      The “[g]overnment may not regulate expression in such a manner that a\n\nsubstantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.”\n\nWard, 491 U.S. at 799. “[T]he essence of narrow tailoring” is when a regulation\n\n“focuses on the source of the evils the [government] seeks to eliminate . . .\n\nwithout at the same time banning or significantly restricting a substantial quantity\n\nof speech that does not create the same evils.” Id. at 799 n.7. That is, when “the\n\nburden imposed by [a regulation] is congruent to the benefits it affords,” that\n\nregulation is narrowly tailored. Turner II, 520 U.S. at 215–16.\n\n      In the case at bar, the burdens imposed on the reliance parties are congruent\n\nwith the benefits Section 514 affords American copyright holders. 9 As discussed\n\nabove, the government has a substantial interest in securing protections for\n\nAmerican works in foreign countries. Further, Congress heard testimony that the\n\nUnited States could expect foreign countries to provide only as much protection\n\nto American copyright holders as the United States would provide to foreign\n\n\n\n      9\n        We note that copyright includes several “built-in” First Amendment\nprotections. Eldred, 537 U.S. at 219–20. The idea/expression dichotomy ensures\nthat only particular expressions, and not ideas themselves, are subject to\ncopyright protection. Id. Additionally, the fair use defense allows individuals to\nuse expressions contained in a copyrighted work under certain circumstances,\nincluding “criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching . . . scholarship, or\nresearch . . . and even for parody.” Id. (quotations and citation omitted). Section\n514 does not disturb these traditional, built-in protections, and thus, such\nprotected speech remains unburdened.\n\n                                         28\n\fcopyright holders, and other countries might follow the United States’ example.\n\nIn other words, the United States needed to impose the same burden on American\n\nreliance parties that it sought to impose on foreign reliance parties. Thus, the\n\nbenefit that the government sought to provide to American authors is congruent\n\nwith the burden that Section 514 imposes on reliance parties. The burdens on\n\nspeech are therefore directly focused to the harms that the government sought to\n\nalleviate. “This is the essence of narrow tailoring.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 799 n.7.\n\n     2. Alternatives do not undermine the narrow tailoring of Section 514.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that “the Government could have complied with the\n\nBerne Convention while providing significantly stronger protection for the First\n\nAmendment interests of reliance parties like the Plaintiffs here.” Appellees’ Br.\n\nat 30. According to plaintiffs, Article 18 of the Berne Convention provides\n\nconsiderable discretion that allows the government to provide greater protections\n\nfor reliance parties. The government responds that the Berne Convention requires\n\nonly transitional protections for reliance parties.\n\n      The parties’ arguments about what the Berne Convention requires and\n\npermits are beside the point. As discussed above, the government’s interest is not\n\nlimited to compliance with the Berne Convention. Rather, its interest includes\n\nsecuring protections for American copyright owners in foreign countries, which\n\nincludes providing copyright protection against foreign reliance parties. Thus, it\n\nis immaterial whether, as plaintiffs contend, the government could have complied\n\n                                          29\n\fwith the minimal obligations of the Berne Convention and granted stronger\n\nprotections for American reliance parties. If Congress had provided stronger\n\nprotections to American reliance parties such as plaintiffs, many foreign countries\n\nmay have provided similar protections for their own reliance parties, thereby\n\nproviding less protection for American authors. Thus, even assuming for\n\npurposes of this appeal that the United States could have provided stronger\n\nprotections for American reliance parties while complying with the minimum\n\nrequirements of the Berne Convention, Section 514 does not burden substantially\n\nmore speech than necessary to further the government’s interest.\n\n      Moreover, in concluding that Section 514 is not narrowly tailored, the\n\ndistrict court and plaintiffs relied on other countries’ approaches to implementing\n\nthe Berne Convention, specifically, the United Kingdom model. However, we are\n\nnot persuaded that the constitutionality of Section 514 is undermined by the\n\navailability of the United Kingdom model.\n\n      First, the “less restrictive-alternative analysis has never been a part of the\n\ninquiry into the validity of content-neutral regulations on speech.” Turner II, 520\n\nU.S. at 217 (quotations and citation omitted). A statute must be “narrowly\n\ntailored to serve the government’s legitimate, content-neutral interests,” but it\n\n“need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so.” Ward, 491\n\nU.S. at 798. As long as the government does not burden substantially more\n\nspeech than necessary to advance an important interest, we will not invalidate a\n\n                                          30\n\fstatute simply because “the government’s interest could be adequately served by\n\nsome less-speech-restrictive alternative.” Id. at 800.\n\n      Second, to the extent that the United Kingdom model is relevant to our\n\ninquiry, it is not such an obvious and substantially less-speech-restrictive\n\nalternative that it undermines the validity of Section 514. Although not necessary\n\nto the intermediate scrutiny analysis, the existence of less-speech-restrictive\n\nalternatives may be relevant to determining whether Section 514 is narrowly\n\ntailored. See U.S. West, Inc. v. FCC, 182 F.3d 1224, 1238 (10th Cir. 1999)\n\n(analyzing government restriction on commercial speech under intermediate\n\nscrutiny). “‘The availability of less burdensome alternatives to reach the stated\n\ngoal signals that the fit between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen to\n\naccomplish those ends may be too imprecise to withstand First Amendment\n\nscrutiny.’ This is particularly true when such alternatives are obvious and restrict\n\nsubstantially less speech.” Id. (quoting 44 Liqourmart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517\n\nU.S. 484, 529 (1996) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). We do not suggest that the\n\nexistence of a less restrictive alternative is dispositive. See Turner II, 520 U.S. at\n\n217–18 (reaffirming that the presence of a less-restrictive alternative will not\n\nnecessarily invalidate a regulation under intermediate scrutiny). “We merely\n\nrecognize the reality that the existence of an obvious and substantially less\n\nrestrictive means for advancing the desired government objective [may] indicate[]\n\na lack of narrow tailoring.” U.S. West, 182 F.3d at 1238 n.11.\n\n                                          31\n\f      With this in mind, we turn to plaintiffs’ suggestion that there were less\n\nrestrictive means of restoring foreign copyrights. 10 Although no country has\n\nprovided full, permanent exemptions for reliance parties, other countries have\n\nprovided limited protections for reliance parties. The chief alternative discussed\n\nby plaintiffs and the district court is the United Kingdom model. See Golan, 611\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 1174 (“Several member nations—including Germany, Hungary, the\n\nUnited Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand—provide accommodations that are\n\ntemporally permanent so long as certain conditions are met.”); Appellees’ Br. at\n\n34 (“The provisions implemented by the United Kingdom and a dozen other\n\nsignatories confirm what the text of Berne makes clear: permanent protection of\n\nreliance interests is permissible.”). However, the United Kingdom model is not\n\nan obvious and substantially less restrictive alternative.\n\n      Under the United Kingdom model, a “reliance party is allowed to continue\n\nmaking those uses of the work it had made, or incurred commitments to make,\n\nbefore its copyright is restored. But the reliance party can be ‘bought out’ by the\n\nowner of the restored copyright.” Irwin Karp, Final Report, Berne Article 18\n\nStudy on Retroactive United States Copyright Protection for Berne and Other\n\n\n\n      10\n        We note that plaintiffs do not argue—and there is no indication in the\nrecord—that the United States could have provided strong protections for\nAmerican reliance parties and obtained strong protections for American copyright\nholders. To the contrary, the evidence before Congress suggested that other\ncountries had resisted such one-sided arrangements.\n\n                                         32\n\fWorks, 20 Colum.-VLA J.L. & Arts 157, 180 (1996). Thus, copyright owners can\n\n“‘buy back’ their rights immediately after the entry into force of the law restoring\n\ncopyright; and thus, there is no ‘grace period’” similar to Section 514.\n\nAppellant’s App., Vol. I at 159.\n\n      The United Kingdom model is not substantially less restrictive of speech\n\nthan Section 514 of the URAA. In the United Kingdom, a copyright owner\n\ncannot enforce the copyright against a reliance party unless the owner “buys out”\n\nthe reliance party. Under Section 514, a copyright owner cannot enforce the\n\ncopyright against a reliance party unless the owner files notice with the Copyright\n\nOffice or serves notice on a reliance party. 17 U.S.C. § 104A(d)(2). Moreover,\n\nunder Section 514, reliance parties have twelve months to continue exploiting the\n\nworks, although they cannot continue to make copies of the restored work. Id. §\n\n104A(d)(2)(A)(ii)(III), (d)(2)(B)(ii)(III). Under the United Kingdom model,\n\nhowever, the reliance party’s interests are immediately terminated upon buy-out.\n\nThus, under both systems, reliance parties receive qualified protection insofar as a\n\nreliance party can continue to exploit a work until the copyright owner does\n\nsomething: either buy out the reliance party (United Kingdom model) or file\n\nnotice (Section 514). Ultimately, both approaches provide the copyright owner\n\nwith the ability to terminate the reliance party’s interests. The only significant\n\ndifference is that under the United Kingdom model, the reliance party receives\n\ncompensation from the owner, while under Section 514, the reliance party has a\n\n                                          33\n\ftwelve month grace period to continue exploiting the work.\n\n       Further, the United Kingdom model is not far more protective of speech\n\ninterests of reliance parties who have created derivative works, such as the late\n\nplaintiff Kapp. Section 514 allows these reliance parties to continue to use a\n\nderivative work as long as they pay “reasonable compensation” to the copyright\n\nowner. See 17 U.S.C. § 104A(d)(3)(A). The United Kingdom model, on the\n\nother hand, apparently provides no such protection for creators of derivative\n\nworks. In a sense, the two models are mirror images of each other. Under\n\nSection 514, a reliance party can continue to exploit a derivative work as long as\n\nhe pays compensation to the owner of the original copyright. In the United\n\nKingdom, an author of a derivative work can continue to exploit the new work\n\nuntil the owner pays compensation to the reliance party.\n\n       We cannot say that one approach is clearly more protective of speech\n\ninterests than the other. Although the United Kingdom model is arguably more\n\nprotective of reliance parties’ economic interests, we cannot say that it is\n\nsubstantially more protective of reliance parties’ expressive interests. Moreover,\n\neven if the United Kingdom model is marginally more protective of speech\n\ninterests,\n\n       when evaluating a content-neutral regulation which incidentally burdens\n       speech, we will not invalidate the preferred remedial scheme because\n       some alternative solution is marginally less intrusive on a speaker’s\n       First Amendment interests. So long as the means chosen are not\n       substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government’s\n\n                                          34\n\f      interest, the regulation will not be invalid simply because a court\n      concludes that the government’s interest could be adequately served by\n      some less-speech-restrictive alternative.\n\nTurner II, 520 U.S. at 217–18 (internal citations, quotations, and ellipses\n\nomitted).\n\n      At its core, plaintiffs’ challenge to Section 514 “reflect[s] little more than\n\ndisagreement over the level of protection” that reliance parties should receive.\n\nSee id. at 224. Congress sought to balance the interests between American\n\ncopyright holders and American reliance parties. In so doing, Congress crafted a\n\nnuanced statute that offered some protections for both of these competing\n\ninterests. It is not our role to opine on the best method of striking this balance. A\n\nstatute’s “validity does not turn on a [court’s] agreement with the responsible\n\ndecisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant\n\ngovernment interests.” Id. at 218 (quotations and citation omitted). Plaintiffs\n\nmay have preferred a different method of restoring copyrights in foreign works,\n\nbut that is not what the Constitution requires; as long as the government has not\n\nburdened substantially more speech than necessary to further an important\n\ninterest, the First Amendment does not permit us to second guess Congress’s\n\nlegislative choice. “We cannot displace Congress’ judgment respecting content-\n\nneutral regulations with our own, so long as its policy is grounded on reasonable\n\nfactual findings supported by evidence that is substantial for a legislative\n\ndetermination.” Id. at 224.\n\n                                          35\n\f      We conclude that because Section 514 advances a substantial government\n\ninterest, and it does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to\n\nadvance that interest, it is consistent with the First Amendment. Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court erred in ruling that Section 514 violates plaintiffs’ freedom of\n\nexpression.\n\n                    IV. Plaintiffs’ Cross-Appeal (No. 09-1261)\n\n      Plaintiffs have cross-appealed, arguing that Section 514 is unconstitutional\n\non its face. More specifically, “[p]laintiffs contend that removing works from the\n\npublic domain of copyright (as distinct from patents) is an illegitimate means\n\nregardless of the end or the importance of the interest.” Appellee’s Br. at 56\n\n(emphasis omitted). Facial challenges to statutes are generally disfavored as\n\n“[f]acial invalidation is, manifestly, strong medicine that has been employed by\n\nthe [Supreme] Court sparingly and only as a last resort.” Nat’l Endowment for\n\nthe Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 580 (1998) (quotations and citation omitted). As\n\nsuch, plaintiffs bear a “heavy burden” in raising a facial constitutional challenge.\n\nSee id. (quotations omitted). They have not met this burden, as their arguments\n\non appeal are largely foreclosed by our conclusion that Section 514 does not\n\nviolate their freedom of expression, as well as by our previous decision in Golan\n\nI, which we are not free to revisit, as law of the case, see McIlravy v. Kerr-\n\nMcGee Coal Corp., 204 F.3d 1031, 1034 (10th Cir. 2000) (“The law of the case\n\ndoctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should\n\n                                          36\n\fcontinue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.”\n\n(quotations, alterations, and citations omitted)).\n\n      Plaintiffs assert that “there must be a ‘bright line’ drawn around the public\n\ndomain . . . .” Appellees’ Reply Br. at 6–7. But in Golan I, we rejected plaintiffs’\n\nargument “that, in the context of copyright, the public domain is a threshold that\n\nCongress may not traverse in both directions.” Golan I, 501 F.3d at 1187\n\n(quotation omitted). We stated that\n\n      [t]he clear import of Eldred is that Congress has expansive powers when\n      it legislates under the Copyright Clause, and this court may not interfere\n      so long as Congress has rationally exercised its authority. Here, we do\n      not believe that the decision to comply with the Berne Convention,\n      which secures copyright protections for American works abroad, is so\n      irrational or so unrelated to the aims of the Copyright Clause that it\n      exceeds the reach of congressional power.\n\nId. (internal citation omitted). We held that Section 514 was within Congress’s\n\nArticle I powers, and therefore, Congress had the authority to extend copyright to\n\nworks that were in the public domain. See id.\n\n      Of course, while Congress may have the authority under Article I to enact\n\nSection 514, it “must still comport with other express limitations of the\n\nConstitution.” Id. Plaintiffs have cast their facial challenge to Section 514 in\n\nterms of “the First Amendment, the contours of which may be informed by the\n\nProgress [or Copyright] Clause.” Appellees’ Br. at 53. However, plaintiffs have\n\nprovided no legal support for their claim that the First Amendment—either by\n\nitself or informed by any other provision of the Constitution—draws such\n\n                                          37\n\fabsolute, bright lines around the public domain, and we are aware of no such\n\nauthority.\n\n      Plaintiffs’ only legal authority is Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497 (1954),\n\nbut their reliance on Bolling is without merit. In Bolling, the Supreme Court\n\nannounced that “[s]egregation in public education [wa]s not reasonably related to\n\nany proper governmental objective” and held “that racial segregation in the public\n\nschools of the District of Columbia [wa]s a denial of the due process of law\n\nguaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.” Id. at 500. The Due\n\nProcess analysis in Bolling does not inform plaintiffs’ argument that the First\n\nAmendment makes the public domain of copyright absolutely inviolable. Instead,\n\nthe First Amendment places the same restrictions on copyright restoration under\n\nSection 514 that it imposes on all other content-neutral regulations of speech. See\n\nGolan I, 501 F.3d at 1196.\n\n      In sum, Congress acted within its authority under the Copyright Clause in\n\nenacting Section 514. See id. at 1187. Further, Section 514 does not violate\n\nplaintiffs’ freedom of speech under the First Amendment because it advances an\n\nimportant governmental interest, and it is not substantially broader than necessary\n\nto advance that interest. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district\n\ncourt and REMAND with instructions to grant summary judgment in favor of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fgovernment. 11\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         Because we conclude that Section 514 does not violate plaintiffs’\nfreedom of expression under the First Amendment, they are not entitled to\ninjunctive relief.\n\n                                        39\n\f",

L. No. 103-465,\n\n§ 514, 108 Stat. 4809, 4976–81 (1994) (codified as amended at 17 U.S.C. §§\n\n104A, 109), which granted copyright protection to various foreign works that\n\nwere previously in the public domain in the United States. The district court\n\ngranted plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, concluding that Section 514\n\nviolates plaintiffs’ freedom of expression under the First Amendment. In Case\n\nNo. 09-1234, the government appeals the district court’s order granting plaintiffs’\n\n\n      *\n       The Honorable Richard D. Cudahy, Senior Circuit Judge, United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\n                                         3\n\fmotion for summary judgment and denying the government’s motion, arguing that\n\nSection 514 is a valid, content-neutral regulation of speech. In Case No. 09-1261,\n\nplaintiffs cross-appeal, contending that the statute is facially invalid and that they\n\nare entitled to injunctive relief. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291, we reverse the judgment of the district court and conclude that Section 514\n\nof the URAA is not violative of the First Amendment.\n\n                              I. Statutory Background\n\n      In 1989, the United States joined the Berne Convention for the Protection\n\nof Literary and Artistic Works (“Berne Convention”). The Berne Convention\n\nrequires each signatory to provide the same copyright protections to authors in\n\nother member countries that it provides to its own authors. Pursuant to Article\n\n18, when a country joins the Convention, it must provide copyright protection to\n\npreexisting foreign works even when those works were previously in the public\n\ndomain in that country. 1 However, when the United States joined the Berne\n\n\n      1\n          Article 18 of the Berne Convention provides:\n\n      (1)     This Convention shall apply to all works which, at the moment\n              of its coming into force, have not yet fallen into the public\n              domain in the country of origin through the expiry of the term of\n              protection.\n\n      (2)     If, however, through the expiry of the term of protection which\n              was previously granted, a work has fallen into the public domain\n              of the country where protection is claimed, that work shall not be\n              protected anew.\n                                                                           continue...\n\n                                           4\n\fConvention, the implementing legislation did not extend copyrights to any foreign\n\nworks that were already in the public domain in the United States. See Berne\n\nConvention Implementation Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-568, § 12 , 102 Stat. 2853,\n\n2860 (“Title 17, United States Code, as amended by this Act, does not provide\n\ncopyright protection for any work that is in the public domain in the United\n\nStates.”); see generally 7 William F. Patry, Patry on Copyright § 24:21 (2010).\n\n      In April 1994, the United States signed various trade agreements in the\n\nUruguay Round General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Included in this round\n\nof agreements was the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual\n\nProperty Rights (TRIPs). The TRIPs agreement required, in part, that its\n\nsignatories comply with Article 18 of the Berne Convention, and thus, extend\n\ncopyright protection to all works of foreign origin whose term of protection had\n\nnot expired. Unlike the Berne Convention, the TRIPs agreement provided for\n\n\n\n      1\n          ...continue\n\n      (3)      The application of this principle shall be subject to any\n               provisions contained in special conventions to that effect existing\n               or to be concluded between countries of the Union. In the\n               absence of such provisions, the respective countries shall\n               determine, each in so far as it is concerned, the conditions of\n               application of this principle.\n\n      (4)      The preceding provisions shall also apply in the case of new\n               accessions to the Union . . . .\n\nBerne Convention, art. 18, Sept. 9, 1886 (revised at Paris on July 24, 1971).\n\n                                            5\n\fdispute resolution before the World Trade Organization. See Patry on Copyright\n\nat § 24:1.\n\n      In order to comply with these international agreements, Congress enacted\n\nthe URAA. In particular, Section 514 of the URAA implements Article 18 of the\n\nBerne Convention. Section 514 “restores” 2 copyrights in foreign works that were\n\nformerly in the public domain in the United States for one of three specified\n\nreasons: failure to comply with formalities, lack of subject matter protection, or\n\nlack of national eligibility. See 17 U.S.C. § 104A(a), (h)(6)(C). Section 514 does\n\nnot restore copyrights in foreign works that entered the public domain through the\n\nexpiration of the term of protection. See id. § 104A(h)(6)(B).\n\n      In addition to restoring copyrights in preexisting foreign works, Section\n\n514 provides some protections for reliance parties 3 such as plaintiffs who had\n\n\n      2\n        Although Section 514 grants copyright protection to works that never\nobtained copyrights in the United States, as well as works that lost copyright\nprotection for failing to comply with various formalities, the parties refer to this\nas copyright “restoration,” and the statute likewise refers to “restored works,”\nsee 17 U.S.C. § 104A(h)(6). For clarity and consistency, we will as well.\n      3\n          A “reliance party” is defined as a person who:\n\n      (A) with respect to a particular work, engages in acts, before the source\n      country of that work becomes an eligible country, which would have\n      violated section 106 if the restored work had been subject to copyright\n      protection, and who, after the source country becomes an eligible\n      country, continues to engage in such acts;\n\n      (B) before the source country of a particular work becomes an eligible\n                                                                        continue...\n\n                                          6\n\fexploited these works prior to their restoration. See id. § 104A(d)(2)–(4). In\n\norder to enforce a restored copyright against a reliance party, a foreign copyright\n\nowner must either file notice with the Copyright Office within twenty-four\n\nmonths of restoration, id. § 104A(d)(2)(A)(i), or serve actual notice on the\n\nreliance party, id. § 104A(d)(2)(B)(i). A reliance party is liable for infringing\n\nacts that occur after the end of a twelve month grace period, starting from notice\n\nof restoration, id. § 104A(d)(2)(A)(ii)(I), (d)(2)(B)(ii)(I). Reliance parties may\n\nsell or otherwise dispose of restored works during this grace period, id. § 109(a),\n\nbut they cannot make additional copies during this time, id.\n\n§ 104A(d)(2)(A)(ii)(III), (d)(2)(B)(ii)(III).\n\n      Section 514 provides further protections for reliance parties who, prior to\n\nrestoration, created a derivative work 4 that was based on a restored work. Under\n\n\n      3\n       ...continue\n      country, makes or acquires 1 or more copies or phonorecords of that\n      work; or\n\n      (C) as the result of the sale or other disposition of a derivative work\n      covered under subsection (d)(3), or significant assets of a person\n      described in subparagraph (A) or (B), is a successor, assignee, or\n      licensee of that person.\n\n17 U.S.C. § 104(A)(h)(4).\n      4\n        “A ‘derivative work’ is a work based upon one or more preexisting works,\nsuch as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion\npicture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or\nany other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted. A work\n                                                                         continue...\n\n                                           7\n\fSection 514, “a reliance party may continue to exploit that derivative work for the\n\nduration of the restored copyright if the reliance party pays to the owner of the\n\nrestored copyright reasonable compensation . . . .” Id. § 104A(d)(3)(A). If the\n\nparties are unable to agree on reasonable compensation, a federal court will\n\ndetermine the amount of compensation. See id. § 104A(d)(3)(B).\n\n                    II. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n      The factual background is not in dispute. Plaintiffs are orchestra\n\nconductors, educators, performers, publishers, film archivists, and motion picture\n\ndistributors who have relied on artistic works in the public domain for their\n\nlivelihoods. They perform, distribute, and sell public domain works. The late\n\nplaintiff Kapp created a derivative work—a sound recording based on several\n\ncompositions by Dmitri Shostakovich. Section 514 of the URAA provided\n\ncopyright protection to these foreign works, removing them from the public\n\ndomain in the United States. As a result, plaintiffs are either prevented from\n\nusing these works or are required to pay licensing fees to the copyright\n\nholders—fees that are often cost-prohibitive for plaintiffs.\n\n      Plaintiffs filed this action, challenging the constitutionality of the\n\nCopyright Term Extension Act, Pub. L. No 105-298, § 102(b), (d), 112 Stat. 2827,\n\n\n      4\n       ...continue\nconsisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nwhich, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship, is a ‘derivative\nwork’.” 17 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n                                          8\n\f2827–28 (1998), and Section 514 of the URAA, seeking declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief. Initially, the district court granted summary judgment to the\n\ngovernment. On appeal, we concluded that plaintiffs’ challenge to the Copyright\n\nTerm Extension Act was foreclosed by the Supreme Court’s decision in Eldred v.\n\nAshcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122254\"><a href=\"/opinion/122254/eldred-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003).

We also held that “[Section] 514 of the URAA\n\nha[d] not exceeded the limitations inherent in the Copyright Clause” of the United\n\nStates Constitution. Id. 5 We recognized that “legislation promulgated pursuant to\n\nthe Copyright Clause must still comport with other express limitations of the\n\nConstitution,” id. at 1187, and concluded that plaintiffs had “shown sufficient free\n\nexpression interests in works removed from the public domain to require First\n\nAmendment scrutiny of [Section] 514,” id. at 1182. We then remanded the case\n\nto the district court to “assess whether [Section] 514 is content-based or content-\n\nneutral,” id. at 1196, and to apply the appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny.\n\n      On remand, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The\n\ngovernment and plaintiffs agreed that Section 514 is a content-neutral regulation\n\nof speech, and thus should be subject to intermediate scrutiny. The district court\n\nconcluded that “to the extent Section 514 suppresses the right of reliance parties\n\n\n      5\n        The Constitution provides Congress with the power “To promote the\nProgress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and\nInventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.” U.S.\nConst. art. I, § 8, cl. 8.\n\n                                          9\n\fto use works they exploited while the works were in the public domain,” Section\n\n514 was unconstitutional. Golan v.

Consequently, the district court granted plaintiffs’ motion for summary\n\njudgment, and denied the government’s motion.\n\n      The government timely appealed the district court’s order, arguing that\n\nSection 514 of the URAA does not violate the First Amendment. Plaintiffs cross-\n\nappealed, arguing that the district court failed to provide all of the relief that they\n\nrequested. Specifically, plaintiffs request that we adjudicate their facial challenge\n\nto Section 514, direct the district court to enjoin Attorney General Holder from\n\nenforcing the statute, and order the Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters to\n\ncancel the copyright registrations of restored works.\n\n                     III.

Gifts, 136 F.3d at 686\n\n(quotations and citation omitted). On its face, Section 514 is content-neutral.\n\nMoreover, there is no indication that the government adopted Section 514\n\n“‘because of agreement or disagreement with the message [that the regulated\n\nspeech] conveys.”’ See Turner Broad.

Congress\n\nprimarily enacted Section 514 to comply with the United States’ international\n\nobligations and to protect American authors’ rights abroad.

We hold that the government has demonstrated a\n\nsubstantial interest in protecting American copyright holders’ interests abroad,\n\nand Section 514 is narrowly tailored to advance that interest. 6 Consequently, the\n\ndistrict court erred in concluding that Section 514 violates plaintiffs’ First\n\n\n      6\n         Accordingly, we do not reach the validity of the government’s first or\nthird asserted interests, i.e., that Section 514 advances the government’s interest\nin “indisputable compliance” with the Berne Convention, Appellant’s Br. at 30, or\nthat it remedies historic inequities of foreign authors who lost or never obtained\ncopyrights in the United States. We offer no opinion on whether these asserted\ninterests, by themselves, are sufficient to withstand intermediate scrutiny.\n\n                                          12\n\fAmendment rights.\n\n                              A.

Section 514 addresses a substantial or important governmental interest.\n\n       In order for a statute to survive intermediate scrutiny, the statute must be\n\ndirected at an important or substantial governmental interest unrelated to the\n\nsuppression of free expression. See Turner I, 512 U.S. at 662. We have no\n\ndifficulty in concluding that the government’s interest in securing protections\n\nabroad for American copyright holders satisfies this standard.\n\n       Copyright serves to advance both the economic and expressive interests of\n\nAmerican authors. See Eldred, 537 U.S. at 211–13. In addition to creating\n\neconomic incentives that further expression, copyright also serves authors’ First\n\nAmendment interests. “[F]reedom of thought and expression ‘includes both the\n\nright to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.’” Harper &\n\nRow Publishers, Inc. v.

Section 514 addresses a real harm.\n\n      The government’s asserted interest cannot be merely important in the\n\nabstract—the statute must be directed at a real, and not merely conjectural, harm.\n\nTurner I, 512 U.S. at 664 (plurality opinion). Thus, we must examine whether\n\nSection 514 was “designed to address a real harm, and whether [it] will alleviate\n\n[that harm] in a material way.” See Turner II, 520 U.S. at 195. In undertaking\n\n                                         14\n\fthis review, we “must accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments of\n\nCongress.

This\n\ndeferential standard is warranted for two important reasons. First, Congress is\n\n“far better equipped” as an institution “to amass and evaluate the vast amounts of\n\ndata bearing upon the legislative questions.” Id. (quotations and citation\n\nomitted). Second, we owe Congress “an additional measure of deference out of\n\nrespect for its authority to exercise the legislative power.” Id. at 196.\n\n      Even in the realm of First Amendment questions where Congress must\n      base its conclusions upon substantial evidence, deference must be\n      accorded to its findings as to the harm to be avoided and to the remedial\n      measures adopted for that end, lest we infringe on traditional legislative\n      authority to make predictive judgments . . . .\n\nId.\n\n      Additionally, the other branches’ judgments regarding foreign affairs\n\nwarrant special deference from the courts.

See id. at 246 (statement of Eric Smith, Executive Director and General\n\nCounsel of the International Intellectual Property Alliance) (“Literally billions of\n\ndollars have been and will be lost every year by U.S. authors, producers and\n\npublishers because of the failure of many of our trading partners to protect U.S.\n\nworks which were created prior to the date the U.S. established copyright\n\nrelations with that country, or, for other reasons, these works have fallen\n\nprematurely out of copyright in that country.”).\n\n      Congress had substantial evidence from which it could reasonably conclude\n\nthat the ongoing harms to American authors were real and not merely conjectural.\n\nAround the globe, American works were being exploited without the copyright\n\nowners’ consent and without providing compensation. Thus, there was a\n\n“substantial basis to support Congress’ conclusion that a real threat justified\n\nenactment of” Section 514 of the URAA. See Turner II, 520 U.S. at 196.\n\n   3. Substantial evidence supported the conclusion that Section 514 would\n                            alleviate these harms.\n\n      Next, we must determine whether there was substantial evidence from\n\nwhich Congress could conclude that Section 514 would alleviate these harms to\n\nAmerican copyright holders. See id. at 213. At the Joint Hearings, Congress\n\nheard testimony that by refusing to restore copyrights in foreign works in the\n\npublic domain, the United States was not in compliance with its obligations under\n\nthe Berne Convention. See Joint Hearings at 137 (statement of Ira Shapiro,\n\n\n                                          18\n\fGeneral Counsel, Office of the U.S. Trade Representative) (“It is likely that other\n\n[World Trade Organization] members would challenge the current U.S.\n\nimplementation of Berne Article 18 . . . .”); id at 248 (statement of Eric Smith)\n\n(“Many of our trading partners, particularly in Europe, have made it clear to this\n\ncountry that they consider us in violation of our obligations under Article 18.”).\n\nIn addition, the United States’ refusal to restore foreign copyrights was harming\n\nAmerican authors’ interests abroad: foreign countries were following the United\n\nStates’ example of refusing to restore copyrights in works in the public domain.\n\nSee id. at 137 (statement of Ira Shapiro) (“Some other countries, such as Thailand\n\nand Russia, have refused to protect U.S. works in the public domain in their\n\nterritory citing the U.S. interpretation of Berne Article 18 as justification.”).\n\n      Further, the United States’ trading partners had represented that they would\n\nrestore American copyrights only if the United States restored foreign copyrights.\n\nSee id. at 249 n.2 (statement of Eric Smith) (“The Russian government has made\n\nclear that it will provide retroactive protection for ‘works’ only if the U.S.\n\nreciprocates with retroactive protection for Russian works.”). Foreign countries\n\nwere willing to provide, at most, reciprocal copyright protections to American\n\nworks. See id. at 120 (Appendix to Statement of Bruce Lehman, Assistant\n\nSecretary of Commerce and Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks) (“When\n\nwe have urged others to provide protection for our industries’ repertoire of\n\nexisting copyrighted works, we are often confronted with the position that such\n\n                                           19\n\fprotection will be provided there when we protect their works in the same manner\n\nhere in the United States. Clearly, providing for such protection for existing\n\nworks in our own law will improve our position in future negotiations.”).\n\nMoreover, the United States had an opportunity to set an example for copyright\n\nrestoration for other countries. See id. at 225 (statement of Irwin Karp, Counsel,\n\nCommittee for Literary Studies) (“U.S. retroactive protection for foreign works in\n\nour public domain may induce other countries with whom we recently established\n\ncopyright relations to grant retroactive protection to contemporary U.S. works\n\nthat previously fell into their public domains.”). Thus, if the United States\n\nwanted certain protections for American authors, it had to provide those\n\nprotections for foreign authors.\n\n       Plaintiffs aver that Congress was presented with evidence regarding the\n\nneed to restore copyrights generally, but that there was no evidence that Congress\n\nneeded to provide limited protections for reliance parties. According to plaintiffs,\n\nthere is “no support for the conclusion that enacting more stringent measures\n\nagainst reliance parties . . . would have any impact whatsoever on the behavior of\n\nforeign countries.” Appellees’ Br. at 46. To the contrary, Congress heard\n\ntestimony that the United States’ chosen method and scope of copyright\n\nrestoration would impact other nations that were similarly deciding how to restore\n\ncopyrights.\n\n      In particular, Congress heard testimony that the United States could set an\n\n                                         20\n\fexample regarding copyright restoration, and other countries might mirror the\n\nUnited States’ approach. For example, Ira Shapiro, General Counsel of the Office\n\nof the United States Trade Representative, testified that “the choices made in our\n\nimplementation of the TRIPs agreement will set an example for other countries as\n\ngovernments decide on their own implementing legislation as well as influence\n\nfuture disputes over the obligations of the Agreement.” Joint Hearings at 136; see\n\nalso id. at 134 (“U.S. leadership in achieving prompt approval of the Uruguay\n\nRound Agreements and effective implementation of the obligations in those\n\nagreements is vital and will set the pattern for other countries to follow.”).\n\nAdditionally, Eric Smith, speaking on behalf of a consortium of trade associations\n\nwhose members represented both American copyright industries and reliance\n\nparties, testified as follows:\n\n             The fact is that what the United States does in this area will carry\n      great weight in the international community. If we interpret Article 18\n      and the TRIPS provisions to deny protection or significantly limit its\n      scope, our trading partners – just now considering their own\n      implementing legislation – will feel free to simply mirror our views. If\n      the largest exporter of copyrighted material in the world takes the\n      position that we have no, or only limited, obligations, the United States\n      will have little credibility in convincing particularly the new nations\n      with whom we are just starting copyright relations to give us the\n      expansive protection that we need.\n\nJoint Hearings at 247 (emphases added); see also id. at 248 (“[T]aking this action\n\nin the ‘implementing’ legislation will convey clearly the view of the U.S. that it\n\nbelieves that other countries are similarly required to adopt the same position in\n\n\n                                          21\n\fpending legislation or otherwise clarify that foreign preexisting works must be\n\nfully recaptured and protected.” (emphases added)); id. at 131 (testimony of Ira\n\nShapiro) (“[A]s the world leader, it is critically important that we implement fully\n\nin the retroactivity area.”); id. at 291 (testimony of Jason S. Berman) (“[T]he\n\nRussians simply said to the United States negotiators . . . that they will interpret\n\ntheir obligations on retroactivity in exactly the same manner that the United\n\nStates interprets its obligations. So what we are doing here, I believe, is\n\nestablishing by virtue of what we do the ground rule for retroactivity.”); id. at 256\n\n(statement of Jack Valenti, President and CEO of the Motion Picture Association\n\nof America) (“If the U.S. ‘retroactively’ protects works from, for example,\n\nRussia, the former Soviet Republics, the former Eastern Bloc countries, South\n\nKorea, China, then we have every reason to expect those countries to protect\n\npreviously produced American creative works.”). Thus, Congress heard\n\ntestimony from a number of witnesses that the United States’ position on the\n\nscope of copyright restoration—which necessarily includes the enforcement\n\nagainst reliance parties—was critical to the United States’ ability to obtain similar\n\nprotections for American copyright holders.\n\n      Further, Congress squarely faced the need to balance the interests of\n\nAmerican copyright holders and American reliance parties. 8 In his opening\n\n\n      8\n          The testimony to Congress was primarily concerned with reliance parties’\n                                                                        continue...\n\n                                          22\n\fremarks, Senator DeConcini stated:\n\n              The conventional wisdom within the U.S. copyright community\n      is that through the restoration of copyright protection to foreign authors\n      we will get more than we give because U.S. authors will be able to\n      retrieve far more works in foreign countries than foreign authors will\n      retrieve here in the United States.\n              ....\n              . . . [I]f we set out to restore copyright protection to foreign\n      works, we must provide protection that is complete and meaningful. By\n      the same token, we must ensure that copyright restoration provides\n      reliance users a sufficient opportunity to recoup their investment.\n\nId. at 81–82 (Statement of Sen. DeConcini). Congress also heard from Eric\n\nSmith, who testified that the bills under consideration would\n\n      provide a careful balance between the need, on the one hand, to\n      establish a “model” provision which other countries could follow in\n      order to secure effective restoration of our copyrights abroad and the\n      need, on the other hand, to balance the rights of foreign authors whose\n      works are restored in the U.S. with the domestic users that may have\n      relied on the public domain status of the work in making investments.\n\nId. at 252.\n\n      In spite of this testimony, plaintiffs contend that the government’s interest\n\nis too speculative to satisfy intermediate scrutiny. Although we require\n\n“substantial evidence” in order to satisfy intermediate scrutiny, see Turner I, 512\n\nU.S. at 667 (plurality opinion), the evidentiary requirement is not as onerous as\n\nplaintiffs would have us impose. The Supreme Court has cautioned that imposing\n\n\n\n      8\n       ...continue\npossible claims under the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs\nhave not brought such a claim in the case at bar.\n\n                                         23\n\ftoo strict of an evidentiary requirement on Congress is “an improper burden for\n\ncourts to impose on the Legislative Branch.” Turner II, 520 U.S. at 213\n\n(quotation omitted). An overly demanding “amount of detail is as unreasonable in\n\nthe legislative context as it is constitutionally unwarranted. Congress is not\n\nobligated, when enacting its statutes, to make a record of the type that an\n\nadministrative agency or court does to accommodate judicial review.” Id.\n\n      “Sound policymaking often requires legislators to forecast future events\n\nand to anticipate the likely impact of these events based on deductions and\n\ninferences for which complete empirical support may be unavailable.” Turner I,\n\n512 U.S. at 665 (plurality opinion). Past conduct may be the best—and\n\nsometimes only—evidence available to Congress in making predictive judgments.\n\nCf. Ward, 491 U.S. at 800 (“Absent [the regulation at issue], the city’s interest\n\nwould have been served less well, as is evidenced by the complaints about\n\nexcessive volume generated by respondent’s past concerts.”). We think that this\n\nis especially true in areas that involve predictions of foreign relations and\n\ndiplomacy, where empirical data will rarely be available, and to which\n\nconsiderable deference is owed to Congress and the Executive.\n\n      Plaintiffs direct our attention to evidence in the Congressional record that\n\ncontradicted the view that other countries would follow the United States’\n\napproach to copyright restoration. More specifically, Irwin Karp stated:\n\n             When these countries grant retroactivity, the theory goes, they\n\n                                          24\n\f      will deny their reliance interests real protection – if we do so now. But\n      this is only a theory, and an unlikely one. Most foreign countries,\n      including the Commonwealth countries, already grant us retroactivity.\n      They will not change their laws to restrict protection of their reliance\n      parties. Nor will the few important countries who presently do not\n      retroactively protect U.S. works[.] When they do grant retroactivity\n      they can decide what protection they will grant to their reliance\n      interests. There is nothing to stop them from adopting the British et al\n      buy-out provision.\n\nJoint Hearings at 231; see also id. at 224 (“[T]here is absolutely no guarantee that\n\nthey are stupid enough to adopt the reliance-party provisions you are being asked\n\nto adopt.”). However, as detailed above, this was not the only evidence in the\n\nrecord regarding the potential effect of the United States’ position on copyright\n\nrestoration. Congress also heard testimony that if it wanted foreign countries to\n\nprovide strong protections for American authors, Congress needed to provide like\n\nprotections for foreign authors. See id. at 242 (testimony of Eric Smith) (“With\n\nus taking a strong and principled stand here in this country, we can leverage\n\nretroactive protection abroad. I almost entirely disagree with Mr. Karp on this\n\npoint. I think the chances of us obtaining good retroactive protection is quite\n\nstrong if we have this tool behind us.”).\n\n      Although Congress was presented with evidence that its position on\n\ncopyright restoration might not guarantee reciprocation, it does not follow that\n\nSection 514 is unconstitutional. “The Constitution gives to Congress the role of\n\nweighing conflicting evidence in the legislative process.” Turner II, 520 U.S. at\n\n199. Thus, we must determine “whether, given conflicting views . . ., Congress\n\n                                            25\n\fhad substantial evidence for making the judgment that it did.” Id. at 208. In\n\nother words, “[t]he question is not whether Congress, as an objective matter, was\n\ncorrect to determine” that limited protections for reliance parties were\n\n“necessary” to garner similar protections from foreign countries. See id. at 211.\n\n“Rather, the question is whether the legislative conclusion was reasonable and\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record before Congress.” Id.\n\n      In making that determination, we are not to reweigh the evidence de\n      novo, or to replace Congress’ factual predictions with our own. Rather,\n      we are simply to determine if the standard is satisfied. If it is, summary\n      judgment for [the government] is appropriate regardless of whether the\n      evidence is in conflict.\n\nId. (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n\n      Considering the deference that Congress is owed, particularly in areas of\n\nforeign relations, we conclude that Congress’s judgments were supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence. The testimony before Congress indicated that the United\n\nStates’ historically lax position on copyright restoration had been an obstacle to\n\nthe protection that the United States was seeking for its own copyright owners.\n\nWitnesses further testified that many countries would provide no greater\n\nprotections to American authors than the United States gave to their foreign\n\ncounterparts. There was also testimony that the chosen method of restoring\n\nforeign copyrights would have great weight in the international community and\n\ncould induce other countries to follow the United States’ lead, although Congress\n\nheard some testimony that other countries would not necessarily follow the United\n\n                                          26\n\fStates’ approach. Consequently, Congress was presented with substantial\n\nevidence that Section 514 would advance the government’s interest in protecting\n\nAmerican copyright holders “in a direct and effective way.” See id. at 213\n\n(quoting Ward, 491 U.S. at 800). The United States’ ability to protect American\n\nworks abroad would be achieved less effectively absent Section 514, and\n\ntherefore, the government’s interest is genuinely advanced by restoring foreign\n\ncopyrights with limited protections for reliance parties such as plaintiffs.\n\nSee Ward, 491 U.S. at 799.\n\n     B. Section 514 does not burden substantially more speech than necessary.\n\n      Under intermediate scrutiny, we must also determine whether Section 514\n\nis narrowly tailored to further the government’s interests. See Ward, 491 U.S. at\n\n798. “Content-neutral regulations do not pose the same inherent dangers to free\n\nexpression that content-based regulations do,” and therefore, the government has\n\na degree of latitude in choosing how to further its asserted interest. Turner II,\n\n520 U.S. at 213 (quotations and citation omitted). Accordingly, “the\n\n[g]overnment may employ the means of its choosing so long as the regulation\n\npromotes a substantial governmental interest that would be achieved less\n\neffectively absent the regulation and does not burden substantially more speech\n\nthan is necessary to further that interest.” Id. at 213–14 (internal quotations,\n\nellipses, and citation omitted). Further, the regulation need not be the least-\n\nrestrictive alternative of advancing the government’s interest. Id. at 217–18.\n\n                                          27\n\f                       1. Section 514 is narrowly tailored.\n\n      The “[g]overnment may not regulate expression in such a manner that a\n\nsubstantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.”\n\nWard, 491 U.S. at 799. “[T]he essence of narrow tailoring” is when a regulation\n\n“focuses on the source of the evils the [government] seeks to eliminate . . .\n\nwithout at the same time banning or significantly restricting a substantial quantity\n\nof speech that does not create the same evils.” Id. at 799 n.7. That is, when “the\n\nburden imposed by [a regulation] is congruent to the benefits it affords,” that\n\nregulation is narrowly tailored. Turner II, 520 U.S. at 215–16.\n\n      In the case at bar, the burdens imposed on the reliance parties are congruent\n\nwith the benefits Section 514 affords American copyright holders. 9 As discussed\n\nabove, the government has a substantial interest in securing protections for\n\nAmerican works in foreign countries. Further, Congress heard testimony that the\n\nUnited States could expect foreign countries to provide only as much protection\n\nto American copyright holders as the United States would provide to foreign\n\n\n\n      9\n        We note that copyright includes several “built-in” First Amendment\nprotections. Eldred, 537 U.S. at 219–20. The idea/expression dichotomy ensures\nthat only particular expressions, and not ideas themselves, are subject to\ncopyright protection. Id. Additionally, the fair use defense allows individuals to\nuse expressions contained in a copyrighted work under certain circumstances,\nincluding “criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching . . . scholarship, or\nresearch . . . and even for parody.” Id. (quotations and citation omitted). Section\n514 does not disturb these traditional, built-in protections, and thus, such\nprotected speech remains unburdened.\n\n                                         28\n\fcopyright holders, and other countries might follow the United States’ example.\n\nIn other words, the United States needed to impose the same burden on American\n\nreliance parties that it sought to impose on foreign reliance parties. Thus, the\n\nbenefit that the government sought to provide to American authors is congruent\n\nwith the burden that Section 514 imposes on reliance parties. The burdens on\n\nspeech are therefore directly focused to the harms that the government sought to\n\nalleviate. “This is the essence of narrow tailoring.” Ward, 491 U.S. at 799 n.7.\n\n     2. Alternatives do not undermine the narrow tailoring of Section 514.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend that “the Government could have complied with the\n\nBerne Convention while providing significantly stronger protection for the First\n\nAmendment interests of reliance parties like the Plaintiffs here.” Appellees’ Br.\n\nat 30. According to plaintiffs, Article 18 of the Berne Convention provides\n\nconsiderable discretion that allows the government to provide greater protections\n\nfor reliance parties. The government responds that the Berne Convention requires\n\nonly transitional protections for reliance parties.\n\n      The parties’ arguments about what the Berne Convention requires and\n\npermits are beside the point. As discussed above, the government’s interest is not\n\nlimited to compliance with the Berne Convention. Rather, its interest includes\n\nsecuring protections for American copyright owners in foreign countries, which\n\nincludes providing copyright protection against foreign reliance parties. Thus, it\n\nis immaterial whether, as plaintiffs contend, the government could have complied\n\n                                          29\n\fwith the minimal obligations of the Berne Convention and granted stronger\n\nprotections for American reliance parties. If Congress had provided stronger\n\nprotections to American reliance parties such as plaintiffs, many foreign countries\n\nmay have provided similar protections for their own reliance parties, thereby\n\nproviding less protection for American authors. Thus, even assuming for\n\npurposes of this appeal that the United States could have provided stronger\n\nprotections for American reliance parties while complying with the minimum\n\nrequirements of the Berne Convention, Section 514 does not burden substantially\n\nmore speech than necessary to further the government’s interest.\n\n      Moreover, in concluding that Section 514 is not narrowly tailored, the\n\ndistrict court and plaintiffs relied on other countries’ approaches to implementing\n\nthe Berne Convention, specifically, the United Kingdom model. However, we are\n\nnot persuaded that the constitutionality of Section 514 is undermined by the\n\navailability of the United Kingdom model.\n\n      First, the “less restrictive-alternative analysis has never been a part of the\n\ninquiry into the validity of content-neutral regulations on speech.” Turner II, 520\n\nU.S. at 217 (quotations and citation omitted). A statute must be “narrowly\n\ntailored to serve the government’s legitimate, content-neutral interests,” but it\n\n“need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so.” Ward, 491\n\nU.S. at 798. As long as the government does not burden substantially more\n\nspeech than necessary to advance an important interest, we will not invalidate a\n\n                                          30\n\fstatute simply because “the government’s interest could be adequately served by\n\nsome less-speech-restrictive alternative.” Id. at 800.\n\n      Second, to the extent that the United Kingdom model is relevant to our\n\ninquiry, it is not such an obvious and substantially less-speech-restrictive\n\nalternative that it undermines the validity of Section 514. Although not necessary\n\nto the intermediate scrutiny analysis, the existence of less-speech-restrictive\n\nalternatives may be relevant to determining whether Section 514 is narrowly\n\ntailored. See U.S. West, Inc. v. FCC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"158478\"><a href=\"/opinion/158478/u-s-west-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1238 (10th Cir. 1999)\n\n(analyzing government restriction on commercial speech under intermediate\n\nscrutiny). “‘The availability of less burdensome alternatives to reach the stated\n\ngoal signals that the fit between the legislature’s ends and the means chosen to\n\naccomplish those ends may be too imprecise to withstand First Amendment\n\nscrutiny.’ This is particularly true when such alternatives are obvious and restrict\n\nsubstantially less speech.” Id. (quoting 44 Liqourmart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118023\"><a href=\"/opinion/118023/44-liquormart-inc-v-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">484</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 529 (1996) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). We do not suggest that the\n\nexistence of a less restrictive alternative is dispositive. See Turner II, 520 U.S. at\n\n217–18 (reaffirming that the presence of a less-restrictive alternative will not\n\nnecessarily invalidate a regulation under intermediate scrutiny). “We merely\n\nrecognize the reality that the existence of an obvious and substantially less\n\nrestrictive means for advancing the desired government objective [may] indicate[]\n\na lack of narrow tailoring.” U.S. West, 182 F.3d at 1238 n.11.\n\n                                          31\n\f      With this in mind, we turn to plaintiffs’ suggestion that there were less\n\nrestrictive means of restoring foreign copyrights. 10 Although no country has\n\nprovided full, permanent exemptions for reliance parties, other countries have\n\nprovided limited protections for reliance parties. The chief alternative discussed\n\nby plaintiffs and the district court is the United Kingdom model. See Golan, 611\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 1174 (“Several member nations—including Germany, Hungary, the\n\nUnited Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand—provide accommodations that are\n\ntemporally permanent so long as certain conditions are met.”); Appellees’ Br. at\n\n34 (“The provisions implemented by the United Kingdom and a dozen other\n\nsignatories confirm what the text of Berne makes clear: permanent protection of\n\nreliance interests is permissible.”). However, the United Kingdom model is not\n\nan obvious and substantially less restrictive alternative.\n\n      Under the United Kingdom model, a “reliance party is allowed to continue\n\nmaking those uses of the work it had made, or incurred commitments to make,\n\nbefore its copyright is restored. But the reliance party can be ‘bought out’ by the\n\nowner of the restored copyright.” Irwin Karp, Final Report, Berne Article 18\n\nStudy on Retroactive United States Copyright Protection for Berne and Other\n\n\n\n      10\n        We note that plaintiffs do not argue—and there is no indication in the\nrecord—that the United States could have provided strong protections for\nAmerican reliance parties and obtained strong protections for American copyright\nholders. To the contrary, the evidence before Congress suggested that other\ncountries had resisted such one-sided arrangements.\n\n                                         32\n\fWorks, 20 Colum.-VLA J.L. & Arts 157, 180 (1996). Thus, copyright owners can\n\n“‘buy back’ their rights immediately after the entry into force of the law restoring\n\ncopyright; and thus, there is no ‘grace period’” similar to Section 514.\n\nAppellant’s App., Vol. I at 159.\n\n      The United Kingdom model is not substantially less restrictive of speech\n\nthan Section 514 of the URAA. In the United Kingdom, a copyright owner\n\ncannot enforce the copyright against a reliance party unless the owner “buys out”\n\nthe reliance party. Under Section 514, a copyright owner cannot enforce the\n\ncopyright against a reliance party unless the owner files notice with the Copyright\n\nOffice or serves notice on a reliance party. 17 U.S.C. § 104A(d)(2). Moreover,\n\nunder Section 514, reliance parties have twelve months to continue exploiting the\n\nworks, although they cannot continue to make copies of the restored work. Id. §\n\n104A(d)(2)(A)(ii)(III), (d)(2)(B)(ii)(III). Under the United Kingdom model,\n\nhowever, the reliance party’s interests are immediately terminated upon buy-out.\n\nThus, under both systems, reliance parties receive qualified protection insofar as a\n\nreliance party can continue to exploit a work until the copyright owner does\n\nsomething: either buy out the reliance party (United Kingdom model) or file\n\nnotice (Section 514). Ultimately, both approaches provide the copyright owner\n\nwith the ability to terminate the reliance party’s interests. The only significant\n\ndifference is that under the United Kingdom model, the reliance party receives\n\ncompensation from the owner, while under Section 514, the reliance party has a\n\n                                          33\n\ftwelve month grace period to continue exploiting the work.\n\n       Further, the United Kingdom model is not far more protective of speech\n\ninterests of reliance parties who have created derivative works, such as the late\n\nplaintiff Kapp. Section 514 allows these reliance parties to continue to use a\n\nderivative work as long as they pay “reasonable compensation” to the copyright\n\nowner. See 17 U.S.C. § 104A(d)(3)(A). The United Kingdom model, on the\n\nother hand, apparently provides no such protection for creators of derivative\n\nworks. In a sense, the two models are mirror images of each other. Under\n\nSection 514, a reliance party can continue to exploit a derivative work as long as\n\nhe pays compensation to the owner of the original copyright. In the United\n\nKingdom, an author of a derivative work can continue to exploit the new work\n\nuntil the owner pays compensation to the reliance party.\n\n       We cannot say that one approach is clearly more protective of speech\n\ninterests than the other. Although the United Kingdom model is arguably more\n\nprotective of reliance parties’ economic interests, we cannot say that it is\n\nsubstantially more protective of reliance parties’ expressive interests. Moreover,\n\neven if the United Kingdom model is marginally more protective of speech\n\ninterests,\n\n       when evaluating a content-neutral regulation which incidentally burdens\n       speech, we will not invalidate the preferred remedial scheme because\n       some alternative solution is marginally less intrusive on a speaker’s\n       First Amendment interests. So long as the means chosen are not\n       substantially broader than necessary to achieve the government’s\n\n                                          34\n\f      interest, the regulation will not be invalid simply because a court\n      concludes that the government’s interest could be adequately served by\n      some less-speech-restrictive alternative.\n\nTurner II, 520 U.S. at 217–18 (internal citations, quotations, and ellipses\n\nomitted).\n\n      At its core, plaintiffs’ challenge to Section 514 “reflect[s] little more than\n\ndisagreement over the level of protection” that reliance parties should receive.\n\nSee id. at 224. Congress sought to balance the interests between American\n\ncopyright holders and American reliance parties. In so doing, Congress crafted a\n\nnuanced statute that offered some protections for both of these competing\n\ninterests. It is not our role to opine on the best method of striking this balance. A\n\nstatute’s “validity does not turn on a [court’s] agreement with the responsible\n\ndecisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant\n\ngovernment interests.” Id. at 218 (quotations and citation omitted). Plaintiffs\n\nmay have preferred a different method of restoring copyrights in foreign works,\n\nbut that is not what the Constitution requires; as long as the government has not\n\nburdened substantially more speech than necessary to further an important\n\ninterest, the First Amendment does not permit us to second guess Congress’s\n\nlegislative choice. “We cannot displace Congress’ judgment respecting content-\n\nneutral regulations with our own, so long as its policy is grounded on reasonable\n\nfactual findings supported by evidence that is substantial for a legislative\n\ndetermination.” Id. at 224.\n\n                                          35\n\f      We conclude that because Section 514 advances a substantial government\n\ninterest, and it does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to\n\nadvance that interest, it is consistent with the First Amendment. Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict court erred in ruling that Section 514 violates plaintiffs’ freedom of\n\nexpression.\n\n                    IV. Plaintiffs’ Cross-Appeal (No. 09-1261)\n\n      Plaintiffs have cross-appealed, arguing that Section 514 is unconstitutional\n\non its face. More specifically, “[p]laintiffs contend that removing works from the\n\npublic domain of copyright (as distinct from patents) is an illegitimate means\n\nregardless of the end or the importance of the interest.” Appellee’s Br. at 56\n\n(emphasis omitted). Facial challenges to statutes are generally disfavored as\n\n“[f]acial invalidation is, manifestly, strong medicine that has been employed by\n\nthe [Supreme] Court sparingly and only as a last resort.” Nat’l Endowment for\n\nthe Arts v. Finley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118240\"><a href=\"/opinion/118240/national-endowment-for-arts-v-finley/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (1998) (quotations and citation omitted). As\n\nsuch, plaintiffs bear a “heavy burden” in raising a facial constitutional challenge.\n\nSee id. (quotations omitted). They have not met this burden, as their arguments\n\non appeal are largely foreclosed by our conclusion that Section 514 does not\n\nviolate their freedom of expression, as well as by our previous decision in Golan\n\nI, which we are not free to revisit, as law of the case, see McIlravy v. Kerr-\n\nMcGee Coal Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159281\"><a href=\"/opinion/159281/mcilravy-v-kerr-mcgee-coal/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1034 (10th Cir. 2000) (“The law of the case\n\ndoctrine posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should\n\n                                          36\n\fcontinue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.”\n\n(quotations, alterations, and citations omitted)).\n\n      Plaintiffs assert that “there must be a ‘bright line’ drawn around the public\n\ndomain . . . .” Appellees’ Reply Br. at 6–7. But in Golan I, we rejected plaintiffs’\n\nargument “that, in the context of copyright, the public domain is a threshold that\n\nCongress may not traverse in both directions.” Golan I, 501 F.3d at 1187\n\n(quotation omitted). We stated that\n\n      [t]he clear import of Eldred is that Congress has expansive powers when\n      it legislates under the Copyright Clause, and this court may not interfere\n      so long as Congress has rationally exercised its authority. Here, we do\n      not believe that the decision to comply with the Berne Convention,\n      which secures copyright protections for American works abroad, is so\n      irrational or so unrelated to the aims of the Copyright Clause that it\n      exceeds the reach of congressional power.\n\nId. (internal citation omitted). We held that Section 514 was within Congress’s\n\nArticle I powers, and therefore, Congress had the authority to extend copyright to\n\nworks that were in the public domain. See id.\n\n      Of course, while Congress may have the authority under Article I to enact\n\nSection 514, it “must still comport with other express limitations of the\n\nConstitution.” Id. Plaintiffs have cast their facial challenge to Section 514 in\n\nterms of “the First Amendment, the contours of which may be informed by the\n\nProgress [or Copyright] Clause.” Appellees’ Br. at 53. However, plaintiffs have\n\nprovided no legal support for their claim that the First Amendment—either by\n\nitself or informed by any other provision of the Constitution—draws such\n\n                                          37\n\fabsolute, bright lines around the public domain, and we are aware of no such\n\nauthority.\n\n      Plaintiffs’ only legal authority is Bolling v. Sharpe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105222\"><a href=\"/opinion/105222/bolling-v-sharpe/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1954),\n\nbut their reliance on Bolling is without merit. In Bolling, the Supreme Court\n\nannounced that “[s]egregation in public education [wa]s not reasonably related to\n\nany proper governmental objective” and held “that racial segregation in the public\n\nschools of the District of Columbia [wa]s a denial of the due process of law\n\nguaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution.” Id. at 500. The Due\n\nProcess analysis in Bolling does not inform plaintiffs’ argument that the First\n\nAmendment makes the public domain of copyright absolutely inviolable. Instead,\n\nthe First Amendment places the same restrictions on copyright restoration under\n\nSection 514 that it imposes on all other content-neutral regulations of speech. See\n\nGolan I, 501 F.3d at 1196.\n\n      In sum, Congress acted within its authority under the Copyright Clause in\n\nenacting Section 514. See id. at 1187. Further, Section 514 does not violate\n\nplaintiffs’ freedom of speech under the First Amendment because it advances an\n\nimportant governmental interest, and it is not substantially broader than necessary\n\nto advance that interest. Accordingly, we REVERSE the judgment of the district\n\ncourt and REMAND with instructions to grant summary judgment in favor of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fgovernment. 11\n\n\n\n\n      11\n         Because we conclude that Section 514 does not violate plaintiffs’\nfreedom of expression under the First Amendment, they are not entitled to\ninjunctive relief.\n\n                                        39\n\f</pre>",
