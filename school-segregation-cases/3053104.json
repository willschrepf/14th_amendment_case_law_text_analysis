This case arises out of a decision made by the\n\ndefendants, the principals and owners of Burbank Apartments\n\n(Burbank), not to renew Burbank's project-based Section 8\n\nhousing assistance payments contract (HAP) with the United\n\nStates Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) when\n\nits forty-year mortgage subsidy contract expired on March 31,\n\n2011.    In lieu of those project-based subsidies, the defendants\n\nopted instead to accept from its tenants Section 8 enhanced\n\nvouchers, enabling tenants living in units subsidized on a\n\nproject basis to remain as tenants under an alternative Federal\n\nhousing program.4   See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f (2012).\n\n\n     4\n       The Section 8 subsidy program, 42 U.S.C. § 1437f (2012),\nis a voluntary program by which eligible low income families are\nable to affordably rent housing units from private property\n\f                                                                   3\n\n\n    The plaintiffs, comprised of current and potential Burbank\n\ntenants, complained that Burbank's decision violated § 3604 of\n\nthe Federal Fair Housing Act (FHA or Title VIII), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3601 et seq. (2012), and the Massachusetts antidiscrimination\n\nlaw, G. L. c. 151B, § 4, both by virtue of intentional\n\ndiscrimination as well as disparate impact on members of\n\notherwise protected classes of citizens.   In particular, the\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the defendants' decision not to renew\n\ntheir HAP would have a disproportionately negative effect on\n\npeople of color, the disabled and elderly, female-headed\n\nhouseholds, recipients of public and rental assistance, and\n\nfamilies with children (collectively, members of protected\n\nclasses).\n\n    In March, 2011, the plaintiffs moved to enjoin the\n\ndefendants from allowing Burbank's project-based HAP to lapse;\n\nthe defendants demurred, and a Housing Court judge (motion\n\njudge) denied the injunction.   The plaintiffs filed an amended\n\ncomplaint in June, 2011, which the defendants moved to dismiss\n\nfor failure to state a claim, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P.\n\n12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), and oral arguments were held\n\non January 25, 2012.   On December 31, 2014, the motion judge\n\n\n\n\nowners using rent subsidies from the Federal government.   See\nFiggs v. Boston Hous. Auth., 469 Mass. 354, 362 (2014).\n\f                                                                     4\n\n\ngranted the defendants' motion to dismiss.    The plaintiffs\n\nappealed.\n\n    The plaintiffs' housing discrimination claims, based on the\n\ntheory of disparate impact, raise an issue of first impression\n\nin Massachusetts concerning the relationship among Section 8,\n\nthe FHA, and the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute\n\n(together the fair housing statutes).    Specifically, can a\n\nprivate building owner's decision not to renew participation in\n\nthe project-based Section 8 subsidy program in favor of tenant-\n\nbased Section 8 subsidies be the basis of a disparate impact\n\nclaim when such decision was otherwise permitted by both Federal\n\nand State statutes, as well as by contract?    And, if so, what\n\nare the pleading requirements for making out such a claim?\n\n    In his comprehensive memorandum of decision and order, the\n\nmotion judge determined that a disparate impact claim under\n\nthese circumstances is not legally cognizable, and never reached\n\nthe second question.   Subsequently, the United States Supreme\n\nCourt released its decision in Texas Dep't of Hous. & Community\n\nAffairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct.\n\n2507, 2525 (2015) (Inclusive Communities), holding that claims,\n\nsuch as this one, based on the theory of disparate impact are\n\ngenerally cognizable under the FHA.     We granted the plaintiffs'\n\napplication for direct appellate review to consider their\n\nallegations in the context of the FHA, as well as the potential\n\f                                                                     5\n\n\nfor similar claims under Massachusetts antidiscrimination law,\n\nand to examine the impact of the Inclusive Communities decision.\n\n     We affirm the decision of the motion judge granting the\n\nmotion to dismiss, although on somewhat different grounds.      We\n\nconclude that even where the property owner has acted in accord\n\nwith statute, regulation, and contract, a disparate impact claim\n\nunder the fair housing statutes can be brought, subject to\n\nrigorous pleading requirements.    The plaintiffs in the present\n\ncase, however, have not satisfied those requirements.5\n\n     1.   Background.   a.   Statutory background.   In 1965,\n\nCongress, under the auspices of the National Housing Act of\n\n1934, approved a mortgage insurance program known as § 221(d)(3)\n\nof the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C. § 1715l(d)(3) (2012).\n\nSee 12 U.S.C. § 1701s(a).    Pursuant to § 221(d)(3), which was\n\n\"designed to assist private industry in providing housing for\n\nlow and moderate income families and displaced families,\" 12\n\nU.S.C. § 1715l(a), HUD can offer below market interest rate\n\n\n     5\n       We acknowledge the amicus briefs submitted by the Greater\nBoston Real Estate Board, the National Leased Housing\nAssociation, the National Affordable Housing Management\nAssociation, and the Massachusetts Association of Realtors; the\nNational Apartment Association and the National Multifamily\nHousing Council; the Sargent Shriver National Center on Poverty\nLaw, Housing Justice Center, and National Housing Trust; the\nDepartment of Housing & Community Development; Lawyers'\nCommittee for Civil Rights Under Law and Lawyers' Committee of\nCivil Rights and Economic Justice; and the Fair Housing Center\nof Greater Boston, the Boston Tenant Coalition, City Life/Vida\nUrbana, and the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau.\n\f                                                                    6\n\n\n(BMIR) mortgage loans to private property owners in exchange for\n\nan agreement from those owners to provide affordable housing.6\n\nSee 12 U.S.C. § 1715l(d)(3).   The regulatory agreements, and the\n\nattached mortgages, may have up to forty-year terms, 12 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1701s(a), but permit the owners to opt to pay down those\n\nmortgages and withdraw from the program after twenty years.    12\n\nU.S.C. § 1715l(g)(4)(A).\n\n     The Section 8 housing program was enacted in 1974 for the\n\npurpose of \"aiding low-income families in obtaining a decent\n\nplace to live and of promoting economically mixed housing.\"    42\n\nU.S.C. § 1437f(a).7   See Figgs v. Boston Hous. Auth., 469 Mass.\n\n354, 362 (2014); Feemster v. BSA Ltd. Partnership, 471 F. Supp.\n\n2d 87, 91 (D. D.C. 2007), aff'd, 548 F.3d 1063 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\nHousing assistance through Section 8 is obtained through either\n\n\"tenant-based\" or \"project-based\" subsidies.   24 C.F.R.\n\n§ 982.1(b)(1) (2015).   Both forms are funded by the Federal\n\ngovernment and administered by State or local public housing\n\nagencies (PHAs).   See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(a); 24 C.F.R.\n\n     6\n       At the time of the defendants' initial agreement under\n§ 221(d)(3) of the National Housing Act, 12 U.S.C.\n§ 1715l(d)(3), the United States Federal Housing Administration,\na predecessor to the United States Department of Housing and\nUrban Development, was responsible for insurance under\n§ 221(d)(3).\n     7\n       We are aware that 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437a and 1437f were\namended in December, 2015. The amendments do not apply to the\nportions of the statutes relevant to this case. See Pub. L. No.\n114-94.\n\f                                                                     7\n\n\n§ 982.1(a)(1).     For project-based assistance, the \"rental\n\nassistance is paid for families who live in specific housing\n\ndevelopments or units.\"    24 C.F.R. § 982.1(b)(1).   Tenant-based\n\nassistance, on the other hand, is appurtenant to the tenant, and\n\nthe \"assisted unit is selected by the family,\" so that the\n\ntenant may opt to \"rent a unit anywhere . . . in the\n\njurisdiction of a PHA that runs a voucher program.\"     Id.    See 42\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1437f(r); 24 C.F.R. §§ 982.353(a) (2010), 982.355(a)\n\n(2015).   After Congress enacted the Section 8 program in 1974,\n\nmany of the units built with the assistance of the § 221(d)(3)\n\nmortgage program were transferred to project-based Section 8\n\nrent subsidies, including many of those at Burbank.    See\n\nFeemster, supra.\n\n    In 1987, and in response to subsequent concerns that owners\n\noperating under § 221(d)(3) regulatory agreements were opting to\n\npay down their mortgages early and opt out of the Section 8\n\nprogram, see Franconia Assocs. v. United States, 536 U.S. 129,\n\n136 (2002), citing H. R. Rep. No. 100-122, at 53 (1987)\n\n(interpreting 1994 version of 42 U.S.C. § 1472[c][4][B]).\n\nCongress enacted the Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation\n\nAct of 1987 (ELIHPA) to provide incentives for continued\n\nparticipation by property owners.     Franconia Assocs., supra,\n\nciting 42 U.S.C. § 1472(c)(4)(B) (1994 ed. and Supp. V).\n\nCongress also later provided further protection for tenants,\n\f                                                                    8\n\n\nincluding eligibility for tenant-based vouchers on the\n\nexpiration of a project-based HAP.     12 U.S.C. § 4113 (2012).\n\nPursuant to that statute, where an owner opted to terminate or\n\ndiscontinue project-based subsidies, low income tenants in the\n\nunits previously subject to that program automatically would be\n\neligible for Section 8 mobile vouchers, see 12 U.S.C. § 4113(a),\n\nand, in some instances, enhanced vouchers.    See 12 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4113(f).   Further, property owners opting out of project-based\n\nsubsidies -- but continuing to maintain the property for\n\nresidential rental occupancy -- are required to accept the\n\ntenant-based Section 8 subsidies for which their tenants were\n\nautomatically eligible.    12 U.S.C. § 4113(d).\n\n    In 2009, the Legislature enacted cognate legislation, G. L.\n\nc. 40T (c. 40T), which addresses the rights and obligations of\n\nowners operating with project-based Section 8 subsidies.      See\n\nG. L. c. 40T, § 1.   See also St. 2009, c. 159, § 1.   Like the\n\nequivalent Federal statutes, c. 40T provides substantive\n\nprotections for tenants previously occupying units covered by\n\nproject-based subsidies.    See, e.g., G. L. c. 40T, §§ 2 (b), 7.\n\nSee also 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(8)(B).    Also consonant with\n\nFederal law, however, c. 40T does not restrict owners from\n\nprepaying their mortgages or opting out of their subsidy\n\ncontracts after doing so.    See G. L. c. 40T, § 2 (a) (\"Nothing\n\f                                                                   9\n\n\nherein shall prohibit the owner from taking actions to terminate\n\nan affordability restriction\").\n\n     The distinctions between project-based and tenant-based\n\nsubsidies (and among the various tenant-based subsidies\n\nthemselves) are not insignificant.   Generally, all Section 8\n\ntenants contribute a portion of their income to the rent based\n\non an income indicator, amounting to the higher of thirty per\n\ncent of their monthly adjusted income or ten per cent of their\n\nmonthly gross income.8   See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437f(o)(2)(A),\n\n1437a(a)(1).   There are, however, variations on the general\n\nscheme depending on the subsidy program, including who is\n\nresponsible for determining a unit's rental price.   For project-\n\nbased entities, the PHA is responsible for setting rental prices\n\nfor specific units.   See 24 C.F.R. §§ 983.301 (2014), 983.302\n\n(2006).9\n\n     Rental prices for tenants holding tenant-based vouchers, on\n\nthe other hand, are negotiated between the owner and the tenant.\n\n24 C.F.R. § 982.506 (1999).   The Secretary of HUD sets a\n\n\"payment standard\" applicable to the units selected by the\n\ntenant, based on the fair market rental value of the unit, and\n\n     8\n       Gross income is all income, while adjusted income is gross\nincome minus deductions and allowances. See 24 C.F.R. § 5.611\n(2000).\n     9\n       The PHA will redetermine the rent value upon request of\nthe owner or after a decrease in the unit's fair market value.\n24 C.F.R. § 983.302 (2006).\n\f                                                                  10\n\n\nin accordance with HUD regulation.   See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1437f(o)(1)(A)-(B).   Where the rent established in negotiation\n\nbetween the owner and the tenant exceeds the established payment\n\nstandard, the PHA will pay only the difference between the\n\nincome indicator and the payment standard, as opposed to the\n\nrental value, meaning that holders of tenant-based vouchers may\n\nbe subject to paying a greater portion of their income than\n\ntenants living in project-based units.    See id. at\n\n§ 1437f(o)(2)(B).\n\n    Enhanced vouchers, a more protective variation on the\n\ntenant-based subsidy, insulate holders from these rent\n\nvariances, as their rent payments are still determined based on\n\nthe difference between the income indicator and the rent, even\n\nif that rent exceeds the payment standard.    Id. at\n\n§ 1437f(t)(1)(B).    In either tenant-based subsidy scenario,\n\nhowever, the rental value negotiation between an owner and\n\ntenant-based subsidy holder is subject to PHA approval, meaning\n\nthat PHAs can opt not to approve a rental agreement and refuse\n\nto pay the subsidy if the PHA determines that the rent is not\n\n\"reasonable.\"   See 24 C.F.R. § 982.507 (2014); 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1437f(o)(10)(B).   Because rents are established by the PHA\n\nunder the project-based subsidy program, tenants living in\n\f                                                                    11\n\n\nproject-based units are not subject to any reasonableness\n\ndetermination.10\n\n     b.    Factual and procedural background.11   The seven named\n\nplaintiffs in the amended complaint are an amalgamation of\n\ncurrent Burbank tenants, prospective tenants, and organizations\n\nthat represent the interests of other Burbank tenants and more\n\nprospective Burbank residents in the community.     The four\n\nindividual plaintiffs, En Ci Guan, Richard Webster, Byron\n\nAlford, and Satisha Cleckley, are all members of protected\n\nclasses.    Prior to the defendants' decision not to renew their\n\nSection 8 HAP, Guan and Webster lived in units supported by\n\nSection 8 project-based subsidies.    Alford was a resident of a\n\nBurbank unit not supported by the Section 8 project-based\n\nsubsidy, and Cleckley was a nontenant who had sought to apply\n\nfor an apartment at Burbank.    Neither Alford nor Cleckley was\n\never in receipt of the project-based subsidy.     The individual\n\nplaintiffs claimed that the decision to allow the project-based\n\nsubsidy to lapse discriminates against current Burbank tenants\n\n\n     10\n       Tenants with tenant-based subsidies may also be subject\nto rescreening for eligibility. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(6)(B).\nThis is not true for tenants living in units supported by\nproject-based subsidies. 24 C.F.R. § 983.255 (2010).\n     11\n       We draw the facts from the allegations in the complaint,\nas well as exhibits attached thereto, which we accept as true,\nand matters of public record. See Ortiz v. Examworks, Inc., 470\nMass. 784, 785 n.3 (2015); Schaer v. Brandeis Univ., 432 Mass.\n474, 477 (2000).\n\f                                                                   12\n\n\nand potential Burbank tenants in the Fenway community.    The\n\nthree organizational plaintiffs, Burbank Apartments Tenant\n\nAssociation, made up of tenants who reside at Burbank; the\n\nMassachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit\n\ncorporation that works with homeless individuals and families;\n\nand the Fenway Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit\n\ncorporation devoted to enhancing diversity in the Fenway\n\nneighborhood, alleged that the loss of low income housing at\n\nBurbank would harm the neighborhood.   The defendants are the\n\nprincipals and owners of Burbank.12\n\n     Burbank is a scattered site 173-unit rental development\n\nlocated in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston.   Beginning in\n\n1970, the defendants began renovation of Burbank with the\n\nassistance of a federally insured and subsidized § 221(d)(3)\n\nBMIR mortgage loan.   See 12 U.S.C. § 1715l(d)(3).   Pursuant to\n\ntheir regulatory agreement with HUD, the defendants were\n\nobligated to lease the Burbank apartments to low or moderate\n\nincome families for \"so long as the contract of mortgage\n\ninsurance continues in effect.\"   The defendants' mortgage was to\n\n\n     12\n       Burbank Apartments is owned and managed by defendant\nBurbank Apartments Company. Burbank Apartments Corporation is\nthe general partner of Burbank Apartments Company; First Realty\nManagement Corporation manages Burbank Apartments on behalf of\nBurbank Apartments Company; William K. Kargman is principal of\nBurbank Apartments Corporation and First Realty Management\nCorporation; and Robert M. Kargman is principal of Burbank\nApartments Corporation.\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\nbe fully paid by April 1, 2011, with prepayment of the mortgage\n\npermitted as of April 1, 1991.\n\n     In 1982, the eligible tenants occupying Burbank's units\n\nbegan to receive support from project-based Section 8\n\nsubsidies.13   Sixty-seven of the 173 units were designated as\n\nproject-based Section 8 units.\n\n     The defendants opted not to prepay their loan in 1991.\n\nInstead, they signed an ELIPHA use agreement14 in 1994,\n\nspecifying that HUD \"shall not require the [defendants] to renew\n\nor extend any assistance contract beyond [April 1, 2011,] and\n\nshall not subject the [defendants] to more onerous requirements\n\nthan those which exist under the Section 8 program.\"    The use\n\nagreement remained in effect for the balance of the HAP.\n\n     In 2010, the defendants provided a one-year notice of\n\nexpiration to HUD and the subsidized tenants at Burbank, as\n\nrequired by both Federal and State statute.15   See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1437f(c)(8); G. L. c. 40T § 2 (b).   As of April, 2011 (when\n\nthe HAP ended), tenants in 129 of the 173 units at Burbank\n\n     13\n       Prior to 1982, low income tenants at Burbank received\nrental assistance under a predecessor to the Section 8 program.\n     14\n        The agreement provided that sixty-seven units would be\nset aside to very low income families; seventy-five units for\nlower income families; and twenty-eight units to moderate income\nfamilies (allotting affordability restrictions on 170 of the 173\nunits).\n     15\n       Notice was sent in February, March, and May, 2010. It is\nundisputed that the defendants satisfied the notice requirement.\n\f                                                                    14\n\n\n(including each of the three individual plaintiffs who were\n\nexisting tenants) were deemed eligible for the enhanced voucher\n\nprogram.16    As a consequence of Burbank's decision to leave the\n\nproject-based subsidy program, the Boston Housing Authority\n\nobtained funding for a total of 171 new Section 8 enhanced\n\nvouchers, which can be retained by the city of Boston regardless\n\nof whether they would be used at Burbank.\n\n     As alleged in the complaint, Burbank tenants, including\n\nthose receiving Section 8 subsidies, are, on average, more\n\ndiverse than the surrounding neighborhood, and have a lower\n\nincome than the area median.    For example, as of December 16,\n\n2010, sixty-five per cent of the Section 8 households at the\n\ndevelopment had heads of household who were either persons of\n\ncolor, Hispanic, or both.    On the other hand, the population of\n\nthe Fenway zip code area is sixty-six per cent white, and the\n\nimmediate census tract is seventy-three per cent white and only\n\nsix per cent African-American.     In addition, the majority of\n\nprospective tenants who were on the waiting list for project-\n\nbased Section 8 units at Burbank were members of protected\n\nclasses.     As of December, 2009, two-thirds of the prospective\n\ntenants on the waiting list were persons of color, and in\n\n     16\n       In addition to the tenants occupying the sixty-seven\nunits that were previously part of the project-based Section 8\nprogram, sixty-two other Burbank apartments also were deemed\neligible to receive Section 8 enhanced vouchers due to the\ndefendants' decision not to renew the project-based subsidies.\n\f                                                                    15\n\n\nDecember, 2010, only one of the responding eighty prospective\n\ntenants on the waiting list identified himself or herself as\n\n\"white.\"\n\n    The plaintiffs' amended complaint raised two claims.      The\n\nfirst count alleged subsidy discrimination, in violation of\n\nG. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10), because Guan and Webster, who were\n\nreceiving the project-based subsidies prior to April 1, 2011,\n\nwould no longer be eligible for such subsidies.   Further subsidy\n\ndiscrimination was alleged under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (5) and\n\n(10), because applicants and prospective applicants for the\n\nproject-based units, including Cleckley and Alford, claimed that\n\nthe defendants' decision rendered them ineligible for a\n\nsufficient housing subsidy, and they are therefore unable to\n\nafford market rents at Burbank.\n\n    The second count alleged that the defendants' decision not\n\nto renew the HAP was unlawful because it was discriminatory,\n\nbased on both disparate treatment and disparate impact, in\n\nviolation of G. L. c. 151B, § 4, and 42 U.S.C. § 3604.\n\n    The judge granted the defendants' motion to dismiss both\n\ncounts of the amended complaint, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12\n\n(b) (6), for failure to state a claim on which relief can be\n\ngranted.   With respect to the first count, subsidy\n\ndiscrimination under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10), the judge ruled\n\nthat the defendants \"lawfully transitioned from one form of\n\f                                                                    16\n\n\nSection 8 subsidy (project-based) to another form of Section 8\n\nsubsidy (individual enhanced Section 8 vouchers) as [they were]\n\npermitted to do under [F]ederal law.\"     The tenant plaintiffs\n\nwere therefore not unlawfully discriminated against when they\n\nreceived the enhanced vouchers as opposed to the project-based\n\nsubsidies.    The judge dismissed the prospective applicants'\n\nG. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10), claims as too speculative and\n\nindefinite.\n\n    As for the second count, the judge dismissed the claim for\n\nintentional discrimination (a ruling that the plaintiffs have\n\nnot appealed), and adopted a per se rule that precludes\n\ndisparate impact liability where the decision not to renew a\n\nproject-based subsidy was reached in compliance with applicable\n\nstatutes and regulations.\n\n    2.    Discussion.    We review the allowance of a motion to\n\ndismiss de novo, accepting as true the facts alleged in the\n\nplaintiffs' amended complaint and exhibits attached thereto, and\n\nfavorable inferences that reasonably can be drawn from them, see\n\nCoghlin Elec. Contractors, Inc. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co., 472 Mass.\n\n549, 553 (2015).     We also take into consideration matters of\n\npublic record.     See Schaer v. Brandeis Univ., 432 Mass. 474, 477\n\n(2000).   Those alleged facts, and reasonable inferences drawn\n\ntherefrom, must plausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.       See\n\nFlagg v. AliMed, Inc., 466 Mass. 23, 26-27 (2013), quoting\n\f                                                                   17\n\n\nIannacchino v. Ford Motor Co., 451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008).    The\n\nfacts, therefore, \"must be enough to raise a right to relief\n\nabove the speculative level.\"   Iannacchino, supra, quoting Bell\n\nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (Twombly).\n\nWhile \"detailed factual allegations\" are not required at the\n\npleading stage, mere \"labels and conclusions\" will not survive a\n\nmotion to dismiss.    Iannacchino, supra, quoting Twombly, supra.\n\n     On appeal, the plaintiffs pursue a discrimination claim\n\nbecause, as they argue, the defendants' decision has -- and\n\ninevitably will continue to -- challenge integration efforts and\n\nperpetuate the segregation that has plagued Boston, generally,\n\nand the Fenway neighborhood, specifically.17   The plaintiffs\n\nargue that the defendants' decision not to renew their HAP\n\nsubjects the defendants to subsidy discrimination, in violation\n\nof G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10); and housing discrimination, in\n\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), (b) and G. L. c. 151B, §§ 4\n\n(6), (7), and (11).   Neither shoe fits.18\n\n\n     17\n       According to a Boston Globe article summarizing the\nfindings of the 2015 Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies\nreport, \"[d]evelopers aren’t building enough units suitable for\nfamilies or for senior citizens, and high development costs make\nit hard to produce new housing that a low- or middle-income\nrenter can afford.\" Study Finds Rents Soaring as Apartment\nSupply Lags, Boston Globe, Dec. 10, 2015, at C3.\n     18\n       The defendants' argument that § 4122(a) of the Low-Income\nHousing Preservation and Resident Home Ownership Act of 1990, 12\nU.S.C. §§ 4101 et seq. (prohibiting any State law that \"[1]\nrestricts or inhibits the payment of any mortgage . . . ; [2]\n\f                                                                  18\n\n\n     a.   Subsidy discrimination under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (5),\n\n(10).   The plaintiffs, in the first count of their complaint,\n\ncontend that the defendants' decision not to renew the project-\n\nbased Section 8 subsidies constitutes public assistance\n\ndiscrimination under G. L. c. 151B, §§ 4 (5) and (10).\n\n     It is \"an unlawful practice . . . to discriminate against\n\nany . . . tenant receiving [F]ederal, [S]tate, or local housing\n\nsubsidies . . . because of any requirement of such . . . housing\n\n\n\nrestricts or inhibits an owner . . . from receiving the\nauthorized annual return . . . ; [or] [3] is inconsistent with\nany provision of this subchapter\") preempts G. L. c. 151B, § 4\n(10), is inapposite. The defendants argue that G. L. c. 151B,\n§ 4, is preempted both by express preemption and by conflict\npreemption. Neither applies in this case. The express\npreemption argument is overcome by 12 U.S.C. § 4122(b), which\nmakes clear that the policy covered in § 4122(a) does not affect\nlaws of general applicability, such as State fair housing laws,\nwhich are \"not inconsistent with the provisions of this\nsubchapter.\" Nothing in G. L. c. 151B, § 4, is inconsistent\nwith Federal law. See, e.g., Attorney Gen. v. Brown, 400 Mass.\n826, 829-830 (1987) (\"Both G. L. c. 151B, § 4 [10] and 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1437f [1982] share a common goal, i.e., affordable, decent\nhousing for those of low income\"; no preemption of G. L.\nc. 151B, § 4 [10]). The conflict preemption argument can\nlikewise be disposed of by our case law. See id. at 830 (\"The\nFederal statute merely creates the scheme and sets out the\nguidelines for the funding and implementation of the program.\n. . . It does not preclude State regulation\").\n\n     The defendants also argue that G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10),\nwould constitute an unconstitutional regulatory taking under the\nFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We reject\nthis argument, because even if we were to determine that G. L.\nc. 151B, § 4, precluded the defendants from deciding not to\nrenew their project-based subsidy contract, the defendants still\nwould \"continue to derive significant economic benefit from\ntheir property as a whole.\" Blair v. Department of Conservation\nand Recreation, 457 Mass. 634, 645 (2010).\n\f                                                                   19\n\n\nsubsidy program,\" G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10), or to \"aid[ or] abet\"\n\nsuch a violation.19   G. L. c. 151B, §§ 4 (5), (10).   See DiLiddo\n\nv. Oxford St. Realty, Inc., 450 Mass. 66, 78 (2007).     General\n\nLaws c. 151B, § 4 (10), has the goal of providing \"affordable,\n\ndecent housing for those of low income.\"    Attorney Gen. v.\n\nBrown, 400 Mass. 826, 830 (1987).    \"[T]he decision not to enroll\n\nin a voluntary governmental program by itself [does not]\n\nconstitute[] unlawful discrimination under G. L. c. 151B, § 4\n\n(10).\"    Hennessey v. Berger, 403 Mass. 648, 652 (1988).\n\nHowever, the voluntary nature of a program does not preclude the\n\napplication of State law \"mandating participation [in the\n\nvoluntary Federal program] absent some valid nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for not participating.\"    Brown, supra.20   In short,\n\n\n\n     19\n       Paragraph ninety-six of the plaintiffs' complaint alleges\nsubsidy discrimination under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (5), along with\n§ 4 (10). A case finding a defendant liable for subsidy\ndiscrimination under § 4 (5)'s \"aid[ing or] abet[ing]\" language\nalone has neither been called to our attention nor disclosed by\nour own research; we will therefore consider the subsidy\ndiscrimination claim under § 4 (5) only as a base line for the\n§ 4 (10) claim.\n     20\n       We recognize that the defendants' use agreement\nspecifically provided that it \"shall not require the\n[defendants] to renew or extend any assistance contract beyond\n[April 1, 2011,] and shall not subject the [defendants] to more\nonerous requirements than those which exist under the Section 8\nprogram.\" Federal and State statutes likewise indicate that the\ndefendants were under no legal obligation to renew or enter into\na new project-based HAP contract when the use agreement ended.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(8)(A) (providing protections for\ntenants after project-based subsidies end, and therefore\n\f                                                                   20\n\n\nalthough the defendants are not obligated to participate in the\n\nproject-based subsidy program, that fact alone does not shield\n\nthem from an adequately pleaded claim.   The plaintiffs, however,\n\nhave failed to adequately plead such a claim.\n\n     The plaintiffs' subsidy discrimination claim plays out\n\ndifferently for the various groups.   We begin with the claim\n\nmade by Guan.21   His claim relies largely on the assertion that\n\nhe will be injured by the change in subsidy program because the\n\nenhanced vouchers he received are less favorable than the\n\nproject-based subsidies.   Beyond bare \"labels and conclusions,\"\n\nIannacchino, 451 Mass. at 636, quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555,\n\nthe plaintiffs allege no facts to suggest that the decision to\n\nopt out of the project-based subsidy program violated the fair\n\nhousing statutes or was discriminatory in nature.   Every\n\nparticipant in the project-based subsidy program prior to its\n\nnonrenewal was deemed eligible for an enhanced voucher, which\n\nthe defendants accepted and encouraged their tenants (both those\n\n\n\n\nindicating that Federal government recognized that programs\nwould eventually end); G. L. c. 40T §§ 2 (a), 7 (same).\n     21\n       Richard Webster, who was, like En Ci Guan, living in a\nunit supported by project-based subsidies, passed away during\npendency of the case, or he would have been included in this\ngroup.\n\f                                                                    21\n\n\nformerly part of the project-based program and those who were\n\nnot but received enhanced vouchers) to continue to use.22\n\n     This case does not present a situation in which the\n\nproperty owner has placed a barrier on tenancy due to the\n\nproffer of a certain form of subsidy, and not provided for an\n\nalternative means to remain in the unit.   Contrast DiLiddo, 450\n\nMass. at 72.   Instead, it is the lawful replacement of one form\n\nof subsidy (project-based) with another (tenant-based), both of\n\nwhich allowed the tenants to remain in their units.   It is\n\nindeed telling that every former participant in the project-\n\nbased subsidy -- including Guan -- continued to occupy his or\n\nher unit after the HAP lapsed, relying instead on the tenant-\n\nbased enhanced voucher subsidies.   It is therefore apparent that\n\nthe defendants were willing to accept, as the Federal statute\n\nrequires, and even accommodate, tenants who were receiving\n\nhousing subsidies.\n\n     Moreover, it is not apparent that receipt of the enhanced\n\nvouchers has, or will, disadvantage these plaintiffs.23    At any\n\n\n     22\n       The February 18, 2010, notification sent to the tenants\nby the defendants explicitly stated that \"[w]e want our\nresidents to stay at Burbank Apartments\" and that \"[t]he owners\nand staff are working to provide assistance to our residents.\"\n     23\n       Allegations in the complaint imply that the protection\nafforded low income tenants by enhanced vouchers are not\nequivalent to that offered by project-based subsidies. Those\nallegations include that the enhanced vouchers lose their\nenhanced status if the tenant leaves Burbank, that tenants can\n\f                                                                   22\n\n\nrate, even if we were to assume that receipt of the project-\n\nbased subsidies is more favorable than the enhanced vouchers,\n\nwhat the law requires is that the defendants not discriminate\n\nagainst public assistance recipients in general, not that they\n\nmust provide the best -- or any particular -- form of rental\n\nassistance.\n\n    The next group consists of the nonparticipating plaintiffs,\n\nAlford and Cleckley.   These plaintiffs allege that the decision\n\nnot to renew the project-based subsidy constituted\n\ndiscrimination because they sought to apply for the project-\n\nbased subsidy.   They further allege that they and others will be\n\nexcluded from Burbank at some time in the future, whether or not\n\nthey have tenant-based subsidies.\n\n    We agree with the motion judge that these plaintiffs have\n\nfailed to state a claim under G. L. c. 151B, §§ 4 (5) and (10).\n\n\nbe deemed ineligible for the enhanced vouchers, that the units\nin which tenants were previously living would no longer be\nsubsidized, and that they are more politically vulnerable, more\nlikely to be the target of budget cuts, and have more\ndetrimental program rules. Such allegations are, as they apply\nto the to the participating tenant plaintiffs, both speculative\nand indefinite in nature. See Iannacchino v. Ford Motor Co.,\n451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008), quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly,\n550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007) (Twombly). The plaintiffs also allege\nthat tenants using tenant-based subsidies are subject to a\ngreater extent to fluctuations in rent prices. However, nothing\nin the complaint indicates that the defendants raised the rental\nvalue beyond any level of reasonableness, such that a PHA may\nopt not to approve the lease or cover the rent. In any event,\nthese concerns border on being \"labels and conclusions,\" which\ncarry less weight in our analysis. See Iannacchino, supra,\nquoting Twombly, supra.\n\f                                                                   23\n\n\nIt is not only the speculative and indefinite nature of the\n\nclaims that is their death knell.    Simply put, the complaint\n\ncontains no allegations that the defendants have discriminated\n\nagainst any tenant receiving Section 8 subsidies, or that the\n\ndefendants have refused to consider the applications of\n\nprospective tenants because of such subsidies.    As to the\n\nallegation that the defendants will no longer accept the\n\nproject-based subsidies, which these plaintiffs claim may be the\n\nbasis of their claim of subsidy discrimination, those subsidies\n\nare appurtenant not to the tenant (or prospective tenant), but\n\nto the rental unit.24\n\n     The plaintiffs have therefore failed to allege facts\n\n\"plausibly suggesting,\" Iannacchino, 451 Mass. at 636, quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S at 555, that the defendants' decision violated\n\nG. L. c. 151B, §§ 4 (5) or (10).    The defendants did not\n\ndiscriminate against \"a tenant receiving\" a housing subsidy, but\n\ninstead lawfully transitioned from one form of Section 8 subsidy\n\nto another, as is permitted under the Federal regulations.\n\n     b.   Discriminatory housing accommodation.   The plaintiffs\n\ntake issue with the motion judge's determination that the\n\ndefendants' decision not to renew their HAP contract is immune\n\nfrom a disparate impact challenge under the fair housing\n\n     24\n       This same analysis precludes Cleckley's \"independent\nbasis\" for relief under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10), for\ndiscrimination against a \"recipient of . . . public assistance.\"\n\f                                                                     24\n\n\nstatutes.     They contend that precluding such a claim would be\n\nakin to reading an unwarranted exception for otherwise legal\n\nnonrenewal of a Section 8 HAP into the overriding discrimination\n\nproscriptions of the fair housing statutes.     We agree.\n\n    i.    Disparate impact claims under the FHA and the cognate\n\nMassachusetts fair housing statute.     Disparate impact occurs\n\nwhen a decision \"disproportionately disadvantage[s]\" members of\n\na protected class.     See Lopez v. Commonwealth, 463 Mass. 696,\n\n712 (2012).    See also Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2513,\n\n2521.   There is no \"single test\" to demonstrate disparate\n\nimpact.   Langlois v. Abington Hous. Auth., 207 F.3d 43, 50 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).\n\n    We begin with the general framework for Federal housing\n\ndiscrimination claims pursuant to the FHA.     Claims under the FHA\n\nmay be alleged under either disparate treatment or disparate\n\nimpact theories.     See Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2518,\n\n2524-2525 (extrapolating disparate impact theory under Title\n\nVIII from similar precedent, set by Griggs v. Duke Power Co.,\n\n401 U.S. 424, 431 [1971], construing Federal employment\n\ndiscrimination statute claims under Title VII).     However, while\n\nthe Supreme Court has concluded that discrimination claims based\n\non a disparate impact theory may be brought under the FHA, we\n\nhave yet to determine whether such a fair housing claim could\n\nalso be pleaded based on discriminatory impact under the\n\f                                                                    25\n\n\nCommonwealth's antidiscrimination law.    We conclude that such a\n\nclaim is cognizable.\n\n    In School Comm. of Braintree v. Massachusetts Comm'n\n\nAgainst Discrimination, 377 Mass. 424 (1979) (Braintree), we\n\nrecognized that, like Title VII, the Massachusetts employment\n\ndiscrimination statute, G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (1), \"proscribes not\n\nonly overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in\n\nform, but discriminatory in operation.\"    Id. at 429 n.10,\n\nquoting Griggs, supra.   We later expanded our disparate impact\n\njurisprudence to claims under G. L. c. 151B, § 4A (interference\n\nclaims).   See Lopez, 463 Mass. at 710-711.   Although we have not\n\nconsidered whether disparate impact claims apply to G. L.\n\nc. 151B, § 4, in its entirety, the Appeals Court has further\n\nbroadened disparate impact application to other subsections of\n\nG. L. c. 151B.   See Porio v. Department of Revenue, 80 Mass.\n\nApp. Ct. 57, 68-69 (2011) (reviewing disparate impact claim\n\nunder § 4 [1C]).\n\n    Our decision to amplify our disparate impact analysis\n\nderives from the language of the statute and the purpose of our\n\nhousing discrimination laws, which, like those preventing\n\nemployment discrimination, seek to eradicate discrimination in\n\nall its forms, be they based on intent or effect.\n\n\"[A]ntidiscrimination laws must be construed to encompass\n\ndisparate-impact claims when their text refers to the\n\f                                                                   26\n\n\nconsequences of actions and not just to the mindset of actors,\n\nand where that interpretation is consistent with statutory\n\npurpose.\"   Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2518.\n\nGeneral Laws c. 151B, §§ 4 (6), (7) and (11), prohibit conduct\n\nthat results in a \"refus[al] to rent or lease or sell or\n\nnegotiate for sale\" on the basis of membership in a protected\n\nclass.   This language indicates that it is not only the intent\n\nbehind discriminatory housing actions that the Legislature\n\nsought to punish, but also the consequences of such actions.\n\n    Our conclusion is also tethered to the policy underlying\n\nthe fair housing statutes.   See Inclusive Communities, supra at\n\n2521 (\"[r]ecognition of disparate-impact claims is consistent\n\nwith the FHA's central purpose\").   After all, it is a steadfast\n\nprinciple in the affordable housing context that \"[c]onduct that\n\nhas the necessary and foreseeable consequence of perpetuating\n\nsegregation can be as deleterious as purposefully discriminatory\n\nconduct in frustrating the national commitment to replace the\n\nghettos by truly integrated and balanced living patterns\"\n\n(quotation and citation omitted).

Therefore, just as\n\nthe Supreme Court deduced, based on precedent from Title VII,\n\nthat a disparate impact theory of liability could appropriately\n\nbe brought under Title VIII in the housing context, we too\n\f                                                                   27\n\n\nconclude from our employment discrimination precedent that such\n\na theory of liability is cognizable under G. L. c. 151B, §§ 4\n\n(6), (7), and (11).\n\n    ii.   Disparate impact claims under fair housing statutes\n\nwhere the defendant acted in accord with law.   Having concluded\n\nthat disparate impact claims are generally cognizable under the\n\nfair housing statutes, we must determine whether they may arise\n\nin the context before us.   The defendants urge us to embrace a\n\nper se rule precluding disparate impact liability under the fair\n\nhousing statutes where a property owner has acted in accord with\n\nstatute, regulation, and contract, absent evidence of\n\nintentional discrimination.   We decline to adopt such a rule.\n\n    Our analysis begins again with the policy behind the fair\n\nhousing statutes, namely, to \"provide[] a clear national policy\n\nagainst discrimination in housing.\"   H. R. Rep. No. 100-711,\n\n100th Cong., 2d Sess., 15 (1988).   See 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (\"It is\n\nthe policy of the United States to provide, within\n\nconstitutional limitations, for fair housing throughout the\n\nUnited States\"); G. L. c. 151B, § 9 (Commonwealth's\n\nantidiscrimination statutes, including its fair housing\n\nstatutes, \"shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment\n\nof its purposes, and any law inconsistent with any provision of\n\nthis chapter shall not apply\").   See also Trafficante v.\n\nMetropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205, 211 (1972) (FHA\n\f                                                                  28\n\n\nimplements \"policy that Congress considered to be of the highest\n\npriority\"); Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. v. Boston Carmen's\n\nUnion, Local 589, Amalgamated Transit Union, 454 Mass. 19, 26\n\n(2009) (antidiscrimination policy under G.

Police\n\nDep't of Boston, 434 Mass. 233, 241 (2001) (\"We construe G. L.\n\nc. 151B, § 4, to . . . the fullest effect\").    The statute's\n\n\"broad and inclusive compass,\" therefore, is accorded \"generous\n\nconstruction\" (quotations omitted).    Edmonds v. Oxford House,\n\nInc., 514 U.S. 725, 731 (1995), quoting Trafficante, supra at\n\n209, 212.\n\n    Our canons of statutory construction militate toward the\n\nsame result.   The defendants argue that, where \"a general\n\nstatute and a specific statute cannot be reconciled, the general\n\nstatute must yield to the specific statute\" (citation omitted).\n\nHennessey, 403 Mass. at 651.   They also assert that we must give\n\nfull effect and force to the legislative intent in managing the\n\nsubsidy program, such that property owners would have some\n\nflexibility in choosing to eschew participation in the Section 8\n\nsubsidy program.   This would require a determination that the\n\nspecific statutes (those allowing for nonrenewal of project-\n\nbased HAPs) take precedence over general fair housing policies\n\n(against discrimination in housing).   The judge below agreed,\n\f                                                                 29\n\n\ndetermining that, although the general policy behind the fair\n\nhousing statutes is to stamp out discrimination, Congress and\n\nthe Legislature indicated a specific intent to manage the manner\n\nin which the Federal subsidy programs should be operated.\n\n     But support for such an interpretation is not so clear cut.\n\nAlthough a fundamental precondition to satisfying the goals of\n\nthe fair housing statutes is incentivizing private owners,\n\nthrough federally subsidized loans and tax breaks, to offer\n\naffordable housing,25 it is also a goal to ensure that such\n\nprograms and the private owners they subsidize do not act in a\n\ndiscriminatory manner with regard to such housing.   It is a\n\nbalance of those interests that Congress and the Legislature\n\nsought to strike with the fair housing statutes and regulations.\n\n     Adopting a bright-line rule prohibiting disparate impact\n\nliability where a property owner follows the project-based\n\n     25\n       This goal has become increasingly important recently in\nBoston. See City Will Raise its Fees on Builders, Boston Globe,\nDec. 9, 2015, at A1 (\"Developers will have to pay nearly double\nthe current fees to put up luxury buildings in Boston's hottest\nneighborhoods, with the money going to expand the city's stock\nof affordable housing, according to an executive order to be\nsigned [December 9, 2015,] by Mayor Martin J. Walsh\"); Lower\nPrice Housing On Rise, Boston Globe, July 7, 2015, at A1 (\"So\nfar in 2015, the city has permitted 450 units of low-income\nfamilies, up 25 percent from the same period last year\");\nBoston's Struggle With Income Segregation, Boston Globe, March\n6, 2016, at A1 (\"In 1970, just 8 percent of families in Boston\nand the surrounding cities and towns lived in the poorest\nneighborhoods. Now, the figure is more than twice as high -- 20\npercent. Over the same period, the proportion of families\nliving in the wealthiest neighborhoods has nearly tripled, from\n6 percent to 16 percent\").\n\f                                                                  30\n\n\nSection 8 statutory scheme, absent evidence of intentional\n\ndiscrimination, would run counter to those policies preventing\n\nhousing discrimination in all forms that were delineated by both\n\nCongress and the Legislature.   We will not shoehorn into the\n\nfair housing statutes what HUD would describe as an \"additional\n\nexemption[] [that] would be contrary to Congressional intent.\"\n\n78 Fed. Reg. 11460, 11477 (2013).   See id. at 11460; Inclusive\n\nCommunities, 135 S. Ct. at 2514 (citing HUD regulations\n\nfavorably).   See also DiLiddo, 450 Mass. at 77 (declining to\n\nread exception into G. L. c. 151B, § 4 [10], as contrary to \"the\n\nstatute's clear terms\").   Therefore, although the defendants\n\nnever committed a breach of their Section 8 contract, followed\n\nthe Federal and State requirements in deciding not to renew the\n\nproject-based subsidies, and subsequently accepted the enhanced\n\nvouchers, this alone does not end the inquiry.   Instead, our\n\ndisparate impact analysis will consider whether such actions\n\nwere sufficient to insulate protected classes from\n\ndiscriminatory negative impacts the defendants might have\n\ncaused.   Graoch Assocs. No. 33, L.P. v. Louisville/Jefferson\n\nCounty Metro Human Relations Comm'n, 508 F.3d 366, 377 (6th Cir.\n\n2007) (Graoch) (\"The mere fact that a landlord often can\n\nwithdraw from Section 8 without violating the terms of Section 8\n\nor the FHA does not mean that withdrawal from Section 8 never\n\ncan constitute a violation of the FHA\"); Brown, 400 Mass. at 830\n\f                                                                   31\n\n\n(\"It does not follow that, merely because Congress provided for\n\nvoluntary participation, the States are precluded from mandating\n\nparticipation absent some valid nondiscriminatory reason for not\n\nparticipating\").\n\n     We therefore choose not to adopt the motion judge's\n\ninterpretation.    Although, \"[i]n the absence of explicit\n\nlegislative commands to the contrary, we construe statutes to\n\nharmonize and not to undercut each other,\" School Comm. of\n\nNewton v. Newton Sch. Custodians Ass'n, Local 454, 438 Mass.\n\n739, 751 (2003), we perceive no contrary commands in the fair\n\nhousing statutes, nor a specific intent supplied to trump the\n\noverarching general principle.    Indeed, the statutes are\n\nharmonious:   Congress created a comprehensive incentive program\n\nto encourage property owners to continue to offer Section 8\n\nsubsidies in order to increase affordable housing.    See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1437f.    Because it became obvious that those property\n\nowners would inevitably opt to prepay their mortgages -- or\n\neventually not renew their Section 8 contract -- Congress, and\n\nthen the Legislature, through G. L. c. 40T,26 again stepped in to\n\nensure that the previously contracted property owners would\n\nmaintain an efficient, fair, and nondiscriminatory post-HAP\n\n     26\n       In an amicus brief, the Department of Housing & Community\nDevelopment expresses the policy behind G. L. c. 40T as \"both\nencourag[ing] the continuing existence of affordable housing and\nprotect[ing] tenants in the event that an affordability\nrestriction is terminated.\"\n\f                                                                       32\n\n\nrental regime.     In so doing, a notice requirement was\n\ninstituted, and Congress obligated the owners to accept the\n\nmobile or enhanced vouchers.     See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f; G. L.\n\nc. 40T, § 2 (b).\n\n    The statutes and regulations creating Section 8 contracts,\n\nand those regarding ending such contracts, are therefore\n\nharmonious in their goals:     incentivizing efforts to combat\n\nsegregation, and protecting residents living in affordable\n\nhousing while maintaining economical mechanisms by which\n\nproperty owners can effectuate such a purpose.     Because the\n\ndefendants in this case have benefited -- starting with the\n\nfederally subsidized loans to undertake substantial renovations\n\non Burbank Apartments in the early 1970s -- from the incentives\n\nafforded by the Section 8 project-based subsidies, it is\n\nincumbent on them, should they choose to eschew such benefits,\n\nto do so in a manner that is in conformity with the legislative\n\naspirations based on which they initially entered into the\n\nSection 8 contract.    This is evidenced by the fact that Congress\n\nhas provided a program of enhanced vouchers, under which\n\nproperty owners like the defendants must act if they do not\n\nrenew their HAP.    See 12 U.S.C. § 4113(d).   This Federal\n\nrequirement underscores that, although Section 8 participation\n\nis initially voluntary, the policy ramifications that attend\n\nsuch participation endure beyond the term of the contract.       See\n\f                                                                   33\n\n\nGraoch, 508 F.3d at 376-377 (\"[T]o say that Section 8\n\nparticipation is 'voluntary' is only to say that a landlord does\n\nnot break the law by declining to participate. . . .    [A]lmost\n\nevery action that could create disparate-impact liability under\n\nthe FHA is voluntary\").27\n\n     This result is in accord with fair housing precedent, as\n\nviolating a regulation or breaking the law has never been a\n\nprerequisite to disparate impact liability.   See, e.g., Graoch,\n\nsupra at 376 n.5, 377 (court \"reject[ed] a categorical rule\n\nagainst disparate-impact challenges to withdrawals\" of private\n\nproperty owners from Section 8 voucher program, even though such\n\nwithdrawal from voluntary program was in accordance with statute\n\nand regulation:   \"[a]lthough Congress created the Section 8\n\nprogram six years after passing the FHA, . . . it did not\n\ninclude language indicating that Section 8 landlords should be\n\nexempt from any FHA requirements\").   We therefore do not agree\n\nwith the judgment below that the defendants' compliance with\n\nFederal and State regulations and statutes is a per se bar to\n\ndisparate impact liability.   Instead, we conclude that the\n\n     27\n       We acknowledge the decisions in Salute v. Stratford\nGreens Garden Apartments, 136 F.3d 293, 302 (2d Cir. 1998), and\nKnapp v. Eagle Prop. Mgt. Corp., 54 F.3d 1272, 1280-1281 (7th\nCir. 1995), concluding that disparate impact claims cannot\nresult from an owner's decision not to renew a project-based\nSection 8 subsidy contract. It is our view, however, that these\ndecisions, in concluding that an action need be otherwise\nviolative of the law before facing a disparate impact claim,\nignore the legislative policies behind the fair housing regime.\n\f                                                                  34\n\n\ngeneral and the specific interests of the fair housing statutes\n\nare not mutually exclusive, and a disparate impact claim is\n\ncognizable even if a defendant who is a private owner adheres to\n\nstatutory, regulatory, and contractual obligations.\n\n     iii.   Pleading requirements.   Having concluded that\n\ndisparate impact claims are cognizable under G. L. c. 151B, § 4\n\n(6), (7), and (11), as they are under the FHA, we must now\n\nexplicate pleading requirements for such claims.   In so doing,\n\nwe will follow the burden-shifting framework laid out by HUD and\n\nadopted by the Supreme Court in Inclusive Communities, 135 S.\n\nCt. at 2424-2425.28   See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\n\nResources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837, 843 (1984) (court\n\ndefers to HUD's implementing regulations as long as they are\n\n\"permissible construction of the statute\").   See also\n\nImplementation of the Fair Housing Act's Discriminatory Effects\n\nStandard, 78 Fed. Reg. 11460, 11461 (2013); Inclusive\n\nCommunities, 135 S. Ct. at 2514-2516.    The first step in the\n\nburden-shifting analysis is germane to the present case.     To\n\nestablish a prima facie case for disparate impact housing\n\ndiscrimination under the FHA, and therefore survive a motion to\n\ndismiss, the plaintiffs bear the burden of alleging facts\n\n     28\n       \"When interpreting . . . specific provisions of G. L.\nc. 151B . . . we consider Federal case law construing cognate\nprovisions of the Fair Housing Act unless we discern a reason to\ndepart from those decisions.\" Andover Hous. Auth. v. Shkolnik,\n443 Mass. 300, 306 (2005).\n\f                                                                      35\n\n\nshowing that the \"challenged practice caused or predictably will\n\ncause a discriminatory effect.\"       Inclusive Communities, supra at\n\n2514, quoting 24 C.F.R. § 100.500 (c) (1) (2014).\n\n    The Supreme Court emphasized the need to balance the\n\ninterests of both property owners and protected classes by\n\nrequiring a rigorous examination on the merits at the pleading\n\nstage.   See Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523.        To avoid\n\nthe risk of \"interpreting disparate-impact liability to be so\n\nexpansive as to inject racial considerations into every housing\n\ndecision,\" id. at 2524, courts must \"examine with care whether\n\nplaintiff[s] ha[ve] made out a prima facie case of disparate\n\nimpact.\"   Id. at 2523.    Fair housing claims based on the theory\n\nof disparate impact should therefore be limited to \"avoid the\n\nserious constitutional questions that might arise.\"          Id. at\n\n2522.    Such a showing, for instance, may not be \"imposed based\n\nsolely on a showing of a statistical disparity.\"       Id.     More\n\nparticularly, the plaintiffs cannot satisfy this burden \"[i]f a\n\nstatistical discrepancy is caused by factors other than the\n\ndefendant's policy.\"      Id. at 2514.   Instead, the plaintiffs must\n\nmeet a \"robust causality requirement,\" id. at 2523, by\n\n\"point[ing] to a defendant's policy or policies causing that\n\n[statistical] disparity.\"      Id.   A practice or policy is\n\n\"contrary to the disparate-impact requirement [if it creates]\n\n'artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers'\" that create\n\f                                                               36\n\n\ndiscriminatory effects or perpetuate segregation.   Id. at 2524,\n\nquoting Griggs, 401 U.S. at 431.29\n\n\n\n\n     29\n       The explication of the Supreme Court's pleading\nrequirements established in Texas Dep't of Hous. & Community\nAffairs v. The Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 135 S. Ct.\n2507 (2015) (Inclusive Communities), for disparate impact claims\nunder the FHA leaves a number of questions unanswered. Our\nunderstanding is that the Court's call for \"adequate\nsafeguards,\" including a \"robust causality requirement,\" id. at\n2523, indicates a higher burden for disparate impact plaintiffs\nunder the FHA than under Title VII. Contrast Swierkiewicz v.\nSorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 511 (2002) (plaintiffs need not plead\nprima facie case to survive motion to dismiss under Title VII);\nLopez v. Commonwealth, 463 Mass. 696, 712 n.20 (2012)\n(\"Statistical data, which generally is the source of evidence of\ndisparate impact, will be required at later stages of the\nproceedings . . . but is not required at the pleading stage\"\n[citation omitted]). The Court justifies such a heightened\npleading requirement by surmising that \"prompt resolution of\nthese cases is important.\" Inclusive Communities, supra at\n2523.\n\n     A handful of courts have interpreted the pleading\nrequirements imposed by the Court in Inclusive Communities.\nEach one has subjected the disparate impact claims to the\nrigorous prima facie consideration called for by the Supreme\nCourt. See, e.g., Merritt vs. Countrywide Fin. Corp., U.S.\nDist. Ct., No. 09-cv-01179-BLF (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2015)\n(allowing plaintiffs to amend complaint after dismissal for\nfailure to show disparate impact or to identify specific policy\nthat causally links to alleged disparity); Ellis vs.\nMinneapolis, U.S. Dist.

Application to the present case.    The fair housing\n\nstatutes make it unlawful to \"make unavailable or deny[] a\n\ndwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,\n\nfamilial status, or national origin,\" and bar discrimination\n\n\"against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\n. . . rental of a dwelling . . . because of race, color,\n\nreligion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\"     42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3604(a)-(b).   See G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (6), (7), and (11).\n\nBased on the Supreme Court's pleading requirements, the\n\nplaintiffs must meet a \"robust causality requirement\" in order\n\nto show that a policy by the defendants created a\n\ndisproportionately negative statistical discrepancy in available\n\nhousing for members of a protected class.     See Inclusive\n\nCommunities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523; 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a)-(b); G. L.\n\nc. 151B, § 4 (6), (7), and (11).   The plaintiffs have failed to\n\nsatisfy such pleading requirements.\n\n    The plaintiffs' housing discrimination claims are applied\n\nto two classes of individuals, the current tenants (with\n\nproject-based subsidies before the HAP lapsed) and the\n\nprospective tenants (whether or not they are on the waiting\n\nlist).   The claim for the current tenants boils down to two\n\nfacts:    (1) the defendants' decision not to renew their project-\n\nbased Section 8 subsidy contract has denied and will deny or\n\f                                                                    38\n\n\nwithhold housing from current low income tenants; (2) such\n\ntenants are disproportionately members of protected classes.\n\n    The plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded disparate\n\nimpact discrimination as to the existing tenants at Burbank.\n\nIndeed, the amended complaint does not set forth any harm to\n\nplausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.   See Flagg, 466\n\nMass. at 26-27.   All of the tenants previously enjoying the\n\nSection 8 project-based subsidies were deemed eligible for\n\nenhanced vouchers, which not only allow them to remain in their\n\napartments at Burbank, but also to choose to live at another\n\nproperty while still receiving Section 8 benefits.    The\n\nplaintiffs have not pointed to anything other than speculative\n\nprospective harm to these tenants.   See part 2.a, supra.     The\n\nsuggestion that at some point in the future rents might increase\n\nbeyond the level covered by the enhanced vouchers, or, because\n\nenhanced vouchers are subject to rescreening, some tenants might\n\nbe found ineligible at some point in the future, is inadequate\n\nto state a claim under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6).\n\n    The claim that the defendants' decision disproportionately\n\ndisadvantaged the prospective tenants is also tenuous.      This\n\nclaim likewise is premised on two facts:   (1) the prospective\n\ntenants on the waiting list are disproportionately members of\n\nprotected classes; (2) without the benefit of project-based\n\nsubsidies, the prospective tenants will almost invariably not be\n\f                                                                    39\n\n\nable to afford to live in the sixty-seven project-based\n\nsubsidized units in which they might at some point in time have\n\nhad the chance to live absent the defendants' decision.    The\n\nclaim presents two problems.   First, it is speculative and\n\nindefinite.   There is no guarantee that any of the individuals\n\non the waiting list would have had the opportunity to take\n\nadvantage of the Section 8 housing at Burbank even if the\n\nproject-based HAP was renewed; prospective tenants' eligibility\n\nto move into the sixty-seven project-based units does not\n\nnecessarily mean they would actually, at some point in the\n\nfuture, have such an opportunity.   Indeed, the complaint offers\n\nno facts, beyond bare \"labels and conclusions,\" Iannacchino, 451\n\nMass. at 636, quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, that, even if\n\nthose sixty-seven units did become available in the future, the\n\nprospective tenants who are members of a protected class would\n\nhave the opportunity to move in.    Second, and more importantly,\n\nthe allegations do not meet the \"robust causality requirement\"\n\nin showing that the defendants' actions resulted in a\n\nstatistical disparity, thereby supporting a claim that the\n\ndefendants disproportionately disadvantaged members of a\n\nprotected class.   See Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523.\n\nIn the present case, it is apparent that, as of April 1, 2011,\n\nwhen the project-based subsidy ended, more tenants inhabiting\n\nBurbank units were eligible for Section 8 subsidies (129) than\n\f                                                                   40\n\n\never before (sixty-seven when the project-based subsidies\n\nended).   There were, then, more low and middle income tenants\n\n(who, based on the plaintiffs' statistics, are\n\ndisproportionately members of protected classes) eligible for\n\nfederally subsidized Section 8 housing (whether the enhanced\n\nvouchers are as beneficial as the project-based subsidies or\n\nnot) because of the defendants' decision.   The plaintiffs\n\ntherefore have not shown that the defendant's decision not to\n\nrenew their HAP has resulted in a disproportionately negative\n\nimpact on members of protected classes, and, in any event, they\n\ncannot meet the robust causality requirement necessary to\n\nsatisfy a prima facie disparate impact claim.\n\n    The effect of the defendants' decision not to renew the\n\nproject-based subsidies is therefore distinguishable from the\n\n\"heartland\" cases of disparate impact liability, id. at 2522, in\n\nwhich the defendant's actions unfairly function to \"exclude\n\n[members of protected classes] from certain neighborhoods\n\nwithout any sufficient justification,\" id., by, say, demolishing\n\na development and making it wholly unavailable.   See Charleston\n\nHous. Auth. v. United States Dep't of Agric., 419 F.3d 729, 733-\n\n734 (8th Cir. 2005) (owner's decision to discontinue Section 8\n\nsubsidies, prepay mortgage, and demolish building would have\n\nbeen illegal as resulting in disparate impact on existing and\n\nprospective African-American tenants).   See also Huntington v.\n\f                                                                  41\n\n\nHuntington Branch, Nat'l Assoc. for the Advancement of Colored\n\nPeople, 488 U.S. 15, 16-18 (1988) (overturning zoning law\n\nrestricting construction of multifamily housing projects to part\n\nof town where fifty-two per cent of residents were people of\n\ncolor in town that was ninety-eight per cent Caucasian and four\n\nper cent African-American).   It is likewise different from other\n\ncases in which the defendant's actions did or would alone have\n\ncaused a statistical disparity based on membership in a\n\nprotected class.   See, e.g., Greater New Orleans Fair Hous.\n\nAction Ctr. v. St. Bernard Parish, 641 F. Supp. 2d 563, 569,\n\n577-578 (E.D. La. 2009) (invalidating ordinance allowing only\n\n\"blood relative[s]\" to rent housing units in section of city\n\nwhere residents were \"88.3% Caucasian and 7.6% African-\n\nAmerican\").\n\n    We are not presented here with a case in which the property\n\nowner's actions exacerbated the differences between the project-\n\nbased and tenant-based subsidies.   The complaint does not, for\n\ninstance, indicate that the defendants raised the rent for the\n\nBurbank units to such a degree that the PHA refused to pay them\n\nas unreasonable.   See 24 C.F.R. § 982.507; 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1437f(o)(10)(B) (PHAs allowed to refuse to pay unreasonable\n\nrents).   Had the defendants done so, thereby causing a\n\ndisproportionate disadvantage for tenants of protected classes\n\nwho had no other means to supplement the rental costs, it is\n\f                                                                    42\n\n\npossible that such actions would have resulted in a complaint\n\nthat satisfied the \"robust causality requirement\" necessary to\n\nplead a disparate impact liability claim.    Here, however, there\n\nis no evidence to show that the tenants occupying the sixty-\n\nseven units previously subsidized by project-based Section 8\n\nsubsidies are negatively affected by the currently offered\n\nSection 8 enhanced vouchers, nor is there any indication that\n\nthe defendants' decision will lead to a disproportionate\n\ndisadvantage to members of protected classes living in Burbank,\n\nspecifically, and the Fenway neighborhood, generally (whether\n\nthey sought to rent a project-based unit at Burbank or not).\n\n    We do not discern any alleged action by the defendants that\n\njustifies the imposition of disparate impact liability under the\n\ncircumstances, as the plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded\n\nthat the defendants' decision will cause any discriminatory\n\neffect.   See Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2514, quoting\n\n24 C.F.R. § 100.500(c)(1) (2014).    As a consequence, the\n\nplaintiffs have failed sufficiently to plead a prima facie case\n\nof disparate impact discrimination under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a)\n\nand (b), as well as under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (6), (7), and (11).\n\n    3.    Conclusion.   For the foregoing reasons, the allowance\n\nof the defendants' motion to dismiss both counts of the\n\nplaintiffs' amended complaint is affirmed.\n\n                                     So ordered.\n\f",

In lieu of those project-based subsidies, the defendants\n\nopted instead to accept from its tenants Section 8 enhanced\n\nvouchers, enabling tenants living in units subsidized on a\n\nproject basis to remain as tenants under an alternative Federal\n\nhousing program.4   See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f (2012).\n\n\n     4\n       The Section 8 subsidy program, 42 U.S.C. § 1437f (2012),\nis a voluntary program by which eligible low income families are\nable to affordably rent housing units from private property\n\f                                                                   3\n\n\n    The plaintiffs, comprised of current and potential Burbank\n\ntenants, complained that Burbank's decision violated § 3604 of\n\nthe Federal Fair Housing Act (FHA or Title VIII), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3601 et seq. (2012), and the Massachusetts antidiscrimination\n\nlaw, G. L. c. 151B, § 4, both by virtue of intentional\n\ndiscrimination as well as disparate impact on members of\n\notherwise protected classes of citizens.   In particular, the\n\nplaintiffs alleged that the defendants' decision not to renew\n\ntheir HAP would have a disproportionately negative effect on\n\npeople of color, the disabled and elderly, female-headed\n\nhouseholds, recipients of public and rental assistance, and\n\nfamilies with children (collectively, members of protected\n\nclasses).\n\n    In March, 2011, the plaintiffs moved to enjoin the\n\ndefendants from allowing Burbank's project-based HAP to lapse;\n\nthe defendants demurred, and a Housing Court judge (motion\n\njudge) denied the injunction.

The plaintiffs\n\nappealed.\n\n    The plaintiffs' housing discrimination claims, based on the\n\ntheory of disparate impact, raise an issue of first impression\n\nin Massachusetts concerning the relationship among Section 8,\n\nthe FHA, and the Massachusetts antidiscrimination statute\n\n(together the fair housing statutes).    Specifically, can a\n\nprivate building owner's decision not to renew participation in\n\nthe project-based Section 8 subsidy program in favor of tenant-\n\nbased Section 8 subsidies be the basis of a disparate impact\n\nclaim when such decision was otherwise permitted by both Federal\n\nand State statutes, as well as by contract?    And, if so, what\n\nare the pleading requirements for making out such a claim?\n\n    In his comprehensive memorandum of decision and order, the\n\nmotion judge determined that a disparate impact claim under\n\nthese circumstances is not legally cognizable, and never reached\n\nthe second question.   Subsequently, the United States Supreme\n\nCourt released its decision in Texas Dep't of Hous. & Community\n\nAffairs v.

Tenant-based\n\nassistance, on the other hand, is appurtenant to the tenant, and\n\nthe \"assisted unit is selected by the family,\" so that the\n\ntenant may opt to \"rent a unit anywhere . . . in the\n\njurisdiction of a PHA that runs a voucher program.\"     Id.

No. 100-122, at 53 (1987)\n\n(interpreting 1994 version of 42 U.S.C. § 1472[c][4][B]).\n\nCongress enacted the Emergency Low-Income Housing Preservation\n\nAct of 1987 (ELIHPA) to provide incentives for continued\n\nparticipation by property owners.     Franconia Assocs., supra,\n\nciting 42 U.S.C. § 1472(c)(4)(B) (1994 ed. and Supp. V).\n\nCongress also later provided further protection for tenants,\n\f                                                                    8\n\n\nincluding eligibility for tenant-based vouchers on the\n\nexpiration of a project-based HAP.     12 U.S.C. § 4113 (2012).\n\nPursuant to that statute, where an owner opted to terminate or\n\ndiscontinue project-based subsidies, low income tenants in the\n\nunits previously subject to that program automatically would be\n\neligible for Section 8 mobile vouchers, see 12 U.S.C. § 4113(a),\n\nand, in some instances, enhanced vouchers.    See 12 U.S.C.\n\n§ 4113(f).   Further, property owners opting out of project-based\n\nsubsidies -- but continuing to maintain the property for\n\nresidential rental occupancy -- are required to accept the\n\ntenant-based Section 8 subsidies for which their tenants were\n\nautomatically eligible.    12 U.S.C. § 4113(d).\n\n    In 2009, the Legislature enacted cognate legislation, G. L.\n\nc. 40T (c. 40T), which addresses the rights and obligations of\n\nowners operating with project-based Section 8 subsidies.      See\n\nG. L. c. 40T, § 1.   See also St. 2009, c. 159, § 1.   Like the\n\nequivalent Federal statutes, c. 40T provides substantive\n\nprotections for tenants previously occupying units covered by\n\nproject-based subsidies.    See, e.g., G. L. c. 40T, §§ 2 (b), 7.\n\nSee also 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(8)(B).    Also consonant with\n\nFederal law, however, c. 40T does not restrict owners from\n\nprepaying their mortgages or opting out of their subsidy\n\ncontracts after doing so.    See G. L. c. 40T, § 2 (a) (\"Nothing\n\f                                                                   9\n\n\nherein shall prohibit the owner from taking actions to terminate\n\nan affordability restriction\").\n\n     The distinctions between project-based and tenant-based\n\nsubsidies (and among the various tenant-based subsidies\n\nthemselves) are not insignificant.   Generally, all Section 8\n\ntenants contribute a portion of their income to the rent based\n\non an income indicator, amounting to the higher of thirty per\n\ncent of their monthly adjusted income or ten per cent of their\n\nmonthly gross income.8   See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1437f(o)(2)(A),\n\n1437a(a)(1).   There are, however, variations on the general\n\nscheme depending on the subsidy program, including who is\n\nresponsible for determining a unit's rental price.   For project-\n\nbased entities, the PHA is responsible for setting rental prices\n\nfor specific units.   See 24 C.F.R. §§ 983.301 (2014), 983.302\n\n(2006).9\n\n     Rental prices for tenants holding tenant-based vouchers, on\n\nthe other hand, are negotiated between the owner and the tenant.\n\n24 C.F.R. § 982.506 (1999).   The Secretary of HUD sets a\n\n\"payment standard\" applicable to the units selected by the\n\ntenant, based on the fair market rental value of the unit, and\n\n     8\n       Gross income is all income, while adjusted income is gross\nincome minus deductions and allowances. See 24 C.F.R. § 5.611\n(2000).\n     9\n       The PHA will redetermine the rent value upon request of\nthe owner or after a decrease in the unit's fair market value.\n24 C.F.R. § 983.302 (2006).\n\f                                                                  10\n\n\nin accordance with HUD regulation.   See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1437f(o)(1)(A)-(B).   Where the rent established in negotiation\n\nbetween the owner and the tenant exceeds the established payment\n\nstandard, the PHA will pay only the difference between the\n\nincome indicator and the payment standard, as opposed to the\n\nrental value, meaning that holders of tenant-based vouchers may\n\nbe subject to paying a greater portion of their income than\n\ntenants living in project-based units.    See id. at\n\n§ 1437f(o)(2)(B).\n\n    Enhanced vouchers, a more protective variation on the\n\ntenant-based subsidy, insulate holders from these rent\n\nvariances, as their rent payments are still determined based on\n\nthe difference between the income indicator and the rent, even\n\nif that rent exceeds the payment standard.    Id. at\n\n§ 1437f(t)(1)(B).    In either tenant-based subsidy scenario,\n\nhowever, the rental value negotiation between an owner and\n\ntenant-based subsidy holder is subject to PHA approval, meaning\n\nthat PHAs can opt not to approve a rental agreement and refuse\n\nto pay the subsidy if the PHA determines that the rent is not\n\n\"reasonable.\"   See 24 C.F.R. § 982.507 (2014); 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1437f(o)(10)(B).   Because rents are established by the PHA\n\nunder the project-based subsidy program, tenants living in\n\f                                                                    11\n\n\nproject-based units are not subject to any reasonableness\n\ndetermination.10\n\n     b.    Factual and procedural background.11   The seven named\n\nplaintiffs in the amended complaint are an amalgamation of\n\ncurrent Burbank tenants, prospective tenants, and organizations\n\nthat represent the interests of other Burbank tenants and more\n\nprospective Burbank residents in the community.     The four\n\nindividual plaintiffs, En Ci Guan, Richard Webster, Byron\n\nAlford, and Satisha Cleckley, are all members of protected\n\nclasses.    Prior to the defendants' decision not to renew their\n\nSection 8 HAP, Guan and Webster lived in units supported by\n\nSection 8 project-based subsidies.    Alford was a resident of a\n\nBurbank unit not supported by the Section 8 project-based\n\nsubsidy, and Cleckley was a nontenant who had sought to apply\n\nfor an apartment at Burbank.    Neither Alford nor Cleckley was\n\never in receipt of the project-based subsidy.     The individual\n\nplaintiffs claimed that the decision to allow the project-based\n\nsubsidy to lapse discriminates against current Burbank tenants\n\n\n     10\n       Tenants with tenant-based subsidies may also be subject\nto rescreening for eligibility. See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(o)(6)(B).\nThis is not true for tenants living in units supported by\nproject-based subsidies. 24 C.F.R. § 983.255 (2010).\n     11\n       We draw the facts from the allegations in the complaint,\nas well as exhibits attached thereto, which we accept as true,\nand matters of public record.

The\n\nthree organizational plaintiffs, Burbank Apartments Tenant\n\nAssociation, made up of tenants who reside at Burbank; the\n\nMassachusetts Coalition for the Homeless, a nonprofit\n\ncorporation that works with homeless individuals and families;\n\nand the Fenway Community Development Corporation, a nonprofit\n\ncorporation devoted to enhancing diversity in the Fenway\n\nneighborhood, alleged that the loss of low income housing at\n\nBurbank would harm the neighborhood.   The defendants are the\n\nprincipals and owners of Burbank.12\n\n     Burbank is a scattered site 173-unit rental development\n\nlocated in the Fenway neighborhood of Boston.   Beginning in\n\n1970, the defendants began renovation of Burbank with the\n\nassistance of a federally insured and subsidized § 221(d)(3)\n\nBMIR mortgage loan.   See 12 U.S.C. § 1715l(d)(3).   Pursuant to\n\ntheir regulatory agreement with HUD, the defendants were\n\nobligated to lease the Burbank apartments to low or moderate\n\nincome families for \"so long as the contract of mortgage\n\ninsurance continues in effect.\"   The defendants' mortgage was to\n\n\n     12\n       Burbank Apartments is owned and managed by defendant\nBurbank Apartments Company. Burbank Apartments Corporation is\nthe general partner of Burbank Apartments Company; First Realty\nManagement Corporation manages Burbank Apartments on behalf of\nBurbank Apartments Company; William K. Kargman is principal of\nBurbank Apartments Corporation and First Realty Management\nCorporation; and Robert M. Kargman is principal of Burbank\nApartments Corporation.\n\f                                                                  13\n\n\nbe fully paid by April 1, 2011, with prepayment of the mortgage\n\npermitted as of April 1, 1991.\n\n     In 1982, the eligible tenants occupying Burbank's units\n\nbegan to receive support from project-based Section 8\n\nsubsidies.13   Sixty-seven of the 173 units were designated as\n\nproject-based Section 8 units.\n\n     The defendants opted not to prepay their loan in 1991.\n\nInstead, they signed an ELIPHA use agreement14 in 1994,\n\nspecifying that HUD \"shall not require the [defendants] to renew\n\nor extend any assistance contract beyond [April 1, 2011,] and\n\nshall not subject the [defendants] to more onerous requirements\n\nthan those which exist under the Section 8 program.\"    The use\n\nagreement remained in effect for the balance of the HAP.\n\n     In 2010, the defendants provided a one-year notice of\n\nexpiration to HUD and the subsidized tenants at Burbank, as\n\nrequired by both Federal and State statute.15   See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1437f(c)(8); G. L. c. 40T § 2 (b).   As of April, 2011 (when\n\nthe HAP ended), tenants in 129 of the 173 units at Burbank\n\n     13\n       Prior to 1982, low income tenants at Burbank received\nrental assistance under a predecessor to the Section 8 program.\n     14\n        The agreement provided that sixty-seven units would be\nset aside to very low income families; seventy-five units for\nlower income families; and twenty-eight units to moderate income\nfamilies (allotting affordability restrictions on 170 of the 173\nunits).\n     15\n       Notice was sent in February, March, and May, 2010. It is\nundisputed that the defendants satisfied the notice requirement.\n\f                                                                    14\n\n\n(including each of the three individual plaintiffs who were\n\nexisting tenants) were deemed eligible for the enhanced voucher\n\nprogram.16    As a consequence of Burbank's decision to leave the\n\nproject-based subsidy program, the Boston Housing Authority\n\nobtained funding for a total of 171 new Section 8 enhanced\n\nvouchers, which can be retained by the city of Boston regardless\n\nof whether they would be used at Burbank.\n\n     As alleged in the complaint, Burbank tenants, including\n\nthose receiving Section 8 subsidies, are, on average, more\n\ndiverse than the surrounding neighborhood, and have a lower\n\nincome than the area median.    For example, as of December 16,\n\n2010, sixty-five per cent of the Section 8 households at the\n\ndevelopment had heads of household who were either persons of\n\ncolor, Hispanic, or both.    On the other hand, the population of\n\nthe Fenway zip code area is sixty-six per cent white, and the\n\nimmediate census tract is seventy-three per cent white and only\n\nsix per cent African-American.     In addition, the majority of\n\nprospective tenants who were on the waiting list for project-\n\nbased Section 8 units at Burbank were members of protected\n\nclasses.     As of December, 2009, two-thirds of the prospective\n\ntenants on the waiting list were persons of color, and in\n\n     16\n       In addition to the tenants occupying the sixty-seven\nunits that were previously part of the project-based Section 8\nprogram, sixty-two other Burbank apartments also were deemed\neligible to receive Section 8 enhanced vouchers due to the\ndefendants' decision not to renew the project-based subsidies.\n\f                                                                    15\n\n\nDecember, 2010, only one of the responding eighty prospective\n\ntenants on the waiting list identified himself or herself as\n\n\"white.\"\n\n    The plaintiffs' amended complaint raised two claims.      The\n\nfirst count alleged subsidy discrimination, in violation of\n\nG. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10), because Guan and Webster, who were\n\nreceiving the project-based subsidies prior to April 1, 2011,\n\nwould no longer be eligible for such subsidies.   Further subsidy\n\ndiscrimination was alleged under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (5) and\n\n(10), because applicants and prospective applicants for the\n\nproject-based units, including Cleckley and Alford, claimed that\n\nthe defendants' decision rendered them ineligible for a\n\nsufficient housing subsidy, and they are therefore unable to\n\nafford market rents at Burbank.\n\n    The second count alleged that the defendants' decision not\n\nto renew the HAP was unlawful because it was discriminatory,\n\nbased on both disparate treatment and disparate impact, in\n\nviolation of G. L. c. 151B, § 4, and 42 U.S.C. § 3604.\n\n    The judge granted the defendants' motion to dismiss both\n\ncounts of the amended complaint, pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12\n\n(b) (6), for failure to state a claim on which relief can be\n\ngranted.   With respect to the first count, subsidy\n\ndiscrimination under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10), the judge ruled\n\nthat the defendants \"lawfully transitioned from one form of\n\f                                                                    16\n\n\nSection 8 subsidy (project-based) to another form of Section 8\n\nsubsidy (individual enhanced Section 8 vouchers) as [they were]\n\npermitted to do under [F]ederal law.\"     The tenant plaintiffs\n\nwere therefore not unlawfully discriminated against when they\n\nreceived the enhanced vouchers as opposed to the project-based\n\nsubsidies.    The judge dismissed the prospective applicants'\n\nG. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10), claims as too speculative and\n\nindefinite.\n\n    As for the second count, the judge dismissed the claim for\n\nintentional discrimination (a ruling that the plaintiffs have\n\nnot appealed), and adopted a per se rule that precludes\n\ndisparate impact liability where the decision not to renew a\n\nproject-based subsidy was reached in compliance with applicable\n\nstatutes and regulations.\n\n    2.    Discussion.    We review the allowance of a motion to\n\ndismiss de novo, accepting as true the facts alleged in the\n\nplaintiffs' amended complaint and exhibits attached thereto, and\n\nfavorable inferences that reasonably can be drawn from them, see\n\nCoghlin Elec.

Iannacchino, supra, quoting Twombly, supra.\n\n     On appeal, the plaintiffs pursue a discrimination claim\n\nbecause, as they argue, the defendants' decision has -- and\n\ninevitably will continue to -- challenge integration efforts and\n\nperpetuate the segregation that has plagued Boston, generally,\n\nand the Fenway neighborhood, specifically.17   The plaintiffs\n\nargue that the defendants' decision not to renew their HAP\n\nsubjects the defendants to subsidy discrimination, in violation\n\nof G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10); and housing discrimination, in\n\nviolation of 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a), (b) and G. L. c. 151B, §§ 4\n\n(6), (7), and (11).   Neither shoe fits.18\n\n\n     17\n       According to a Boston Globe article summarizing the\nfindings of the 2015 Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies\nreport, \"[d]evelopers aren’t building enough units suitable for\nfamilies or for senior citizens, and high development costs make\nit hard to produce new housing that a low- or middle-income\nrenter can afford.\" Study Finds Rents Soaring as Apartment\nSupply Lags, Boston Globe, Dec. 10, 2015, at C3.\n     18\n       The defendants' argument that § 4122(a) of the Low-Income\nHousing Preservation and Resident Home Ownership Act of 1990, 12\nU.S.C. §§ 4101 et seq. (prohibiting any State law that \"[1]\nrestricts or inhibits the payment of any mortgage . . . ; [2]\n\f                                                                  18\n\n\n     a.   Subsidy discrimination under G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (5),\n\n(10).   The plaintiffs, in the first count of their complaint,\n\ncontend that the defendants' decision not to renew the project-\n\nbased Section 8 subsidies constitutes public assistance\n\ndiscrimination under G. L. c. 151B, §§ 4 (5) and (10).\n\n     It is \"an unlawful practice . . . to discriminate against\n\nany . . . tenant receiving [F]ederal, [S]tate, or local housing\n\nsubsidies . . . because of any requirement of such . . . housing\n\n\n\nrestricts or inhibits an owner . . . from receiving the\nauthorized annual return . . . ; [or] [3] is inconsistent with\nany provision of this subchapter\") preempts G. L. c. 151B, § 4\n(10), is inapposite. The defendants argue that G. L. c. 151B,\n§ 4, is preempted both by express preemption and by conflict\npreemption. Neither applies in this case. The express\npreemption argument is overcome by 12 U.S.C. § 4122(b), which\nmakes clear that the policy covered in § 4122(a) does not affect\nlaws of general applicability, such as State fair housing laws,\nwhich are \"not inconsistent with the provisions of this\nsubchapter.\" Nothing in G. L. c. 151B, § 4, is inconsistent\nwith Federal law. See, e.g., Attorney Gen. v. Brown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2062332\"><a href=\"/opinion/2062332/attorney-general-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 829-830 (1987) (\"Both G.

The conflict preemption argument can\nlikewise be disposed of by our case law. See id. at 830 (\"The\nFederal statute merely creates the scheme and sets out the\nguidelines for the funding and implementation of the program.\n. . . It does not preclude State regulation\").\n\n     The defendants also argue that G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (10),\nwould constitute an unconstitutional regulatory taking under the\nFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We reject\nthis argument, because even if we were to determine that G. L.\nc. 151B, § 4, precluded the defendants from deciding not to\nrenew their project-based subsidy contract, the defendants still\nwould \"continue to derive significant economic benefit from\ntheir property as a whole.\" Blair v.

L. c. 151B, § 4 (5), along with\n§ 4 (10). A case finding a defendant liable for subsidy\ndiscrimination under § 4 (5)'s \"aid[ing or] abet[ing]\" language\nalone has neither been called to our attention nor disclosed by\nour own research; we will therefore consider the subsidy\ndiscrimination claim under § 4 (5) only as a base line for the\n§ 4 (10) claim.\n     20\n       We recognize that the defendants' use agreement\nspecifically provided that it \"shall not require the\n[defendants] to renew or extend any assistance contract beyond\n[April 1, 2011,] and shall not subject the [defendants] to more\nonerous requirements than those which exist under the Section 8\nprogram.\" Federal and State statutes likewise indicate that the\ndefendants were under no legal obligation to renew or enter into\na new project-based HAP contract when the use agreement ended.\nSee 42 U.S.C. § 1437f(c)(8)(A) (providing protections for\ntenants after project-based subsidies end, and therefore\n\f                                                                   20\n\n\nalthough the defendants are not obligated to participate in the\n\nproject-based subsidy program, that fact alone does not shield\n\nthem from an adequately pleaded claim.   The plaintiffs, however,\n\nhave failed to adequately plead such a claim.\n\n     The plaintiffs' subsidy discrimination claim plays out\n\ndifferently for the various groups.   We begin with the claim\n\nmade by Guan.21   His claim relies largely on the assertion that\n\nhe will be injured by the change in subsidy program because the\n\nenhanced vouchers he received are less favorable than the\n\nproject-based subsidies.   Beyond bare \"labels and conclusions,\"\n\nIannacchino, 451 Mass. at 636, quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555,\n\nthe plaintiffs allege no facts to suggest that the decision to\n\nopt out of the project-based subsidy program violated the fair\n\nhousing statutes or was discriminatory in nature.   Every\n\nparticipant in the project-based subsidy program prior to its\n\nnonrenewal was deemed eligible for an enhanced voucher, which\n\nthe defendants accepted and encouraged their tenants (both those\n\n\n\n\nindicating that Federal government recognized that programs\nwould eventually end); G. L. c. 40T §§ 2 (a), 7 (same).\n     21\n       Richard Webster, who was, like En Ci Guan, living in a\nunit supported by project-based subsidies, passed away during\npendency of the case, or he would have been included in this\ngroup.\n\f                                                                    21\n\n\nformerly part of the project-based program and those who were\n\nnot but received enhanced vouchers) to continue to use.22\n\n     This case does not present a situation in which the\n\nproperty owner has placed a barrier on tenancy due to the\n\nproffer of a certain form of subsidy, and not provided for an\n\nalternative means to remain in the unit.   Contrast DiLiddo, 450\n\nMass. at 72.   Instead, it is the lawful replacement of one form\n\nof subsidy (project-based) with another (tenant-based), both of\n\nwhich allowed the tenants to remain in their units.   It is\n\nindeed telling that every former participant in the project-\n\nbased subsidy -- including Guan -- continued to occupy his or\n\nher unit after the HAP lapsed, relying instead on the tenant-\n\nbased enhanced voucher subsidies.   It is therefore apparent that\n\nthe defendants were willing to accept, as the Federal statute\n\nrequires, and even accommodate, tenants who were receiving\n\nhousing subsidies.\n\n     Moreover, it is not apparent that receipt of the enhanced\n\nvouchers has, or will, disadvantage these plaintiffs.23    At any\n\n\n     22\n       The February 18, 2010, notification sent to the tenants\nby the defendants explicitly stated that \"[w]e want our\nresidents to stay at Burbank Apartments\" and that \"[t]he owners\nand staff are working to provide assistance to our residents.\"\n     23\n       Allegations in the complaint imply that the protection\nafforded low income tenants by enhanced vouchers are not\nequivalent to that offered by project-based subsidies. Those\nallegations include that the enhanced vouchers lose their\nenhanced status if the tenant leaves Burbank, that tenants can\n\f                                                                   22\n\n\nrate, even if we were to assume that receipt of the project-\n\nbased subsidies is more favorable than the enhanced vouchers,\n\nwhat the law requires is that the defendants not discriminate\n\nagainst public assistance recipients in general, not that they\n\nmust provide the best -- or any particular -- form of rental\n\nassistance.\n\n    The next group consists of the nonparticipating plaintiffs,\n\nAlford and Cleckley.   These plaintiffs allege that the decision\n\nnot to renew the project-based subsidy constituted\n\ndiscrimination because they sought to apply for the project-\n\nbased subsidy.

Simply put, the complaint\n\ncontains no allegations that the defendants have discriminated\n\nagainst any tenant receiving Section 8 subsidies, or that the\n\ndefendants have refused to consider the applications of\n\nprospective tenants because of such subsidies.    As to the\n\nallegation that the defendants will no longer accept the\n\nproject-based subsidies, which these plaintiffs claim may be the\n\nbasis of their claim of subsidy discrimination, those subsidies\n\nare appurtenant not to the tenant (or prospective tenant), but\n\nto the rental unit.24\n\n     The plaintiffs have therefore failed to allege facts\n\n\"plausibly suggesting,\" Iannacchino, 451 Mass. at 636, quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S at 555, that the defendants' decision violated\n\nG.

They also assert that we must give\n\nfull effect and force to the legislative intent in managing the\n\nsubsidy program, such that property owners would have some\n\nflexibility in choosing to eschew participation in the Section 8\n\nsubsidy program.   This would require a determination that the\n\nspecific statutes (those allowing for nonrenewal of project-\n\nbased HAPs) take precedence over general fair housing policies\n\n(against discrimination in housing).

It is a\n\nbalance of those interests that Congress and the Legislature\n\nsought to strike with the fair housing statutes and regulations.\n\n     Adopting a bright-line rule prohibiting disparate impact\n\nliability where a property owner follows the project-based\n\n     25\n       This goal has become increasingly important recently in\nBoston.

Therefore, although the defendants\n\nnever committed a breach of their Section 8 contract, followed\n\nthe Federal and State requirements in deciding not to renew the\n\nproject-based subsidies, and subsequently accepted the enhanced\n\nvouchers, this alone does not end the inquiry.

Indeed, the statutes are\n\nharmonious:   Congress created a comprehensive incentive program\n\nto encourage property owners to continue to offer Section 8\n\nsubsidies in order to increase affordable housing.    See 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1437f.    Because it became obvious that those property\n\nowners would inevitably opt to prepay their mortgages -- or\n\neventually not renew their Section 8 contract -- Congress, and\n\nthen the Legislature, through G. L. c. 40T,26 again stepped in to\n\nensure that the previously contracted property owners would\n\nmaintain an efficient, fair, and nondiscriminatory post-HAP\n\n     26\n       In an amicus brief, the Department of Housing & Community\nDevelopment expresses the policy behind G. L. c. 40T as \"both\nencourag[ing] the continuing existence of affordable housing and\nprotect[ing] tenants in the event that an affordability\nrestriction is terminated.\"\n\f                                                                       32\n\n\nrental regime.     In so doing, a notice requirement was\n\ninstituted, and Congress obligated the owners to accept the\n\nmobile or enhanced vouchers.     See 42 U.S.C. § 1437f; G. L.\n\nc. 40T, § 2 (b).\n\n    The statutes and regulations creating Section 8 contracts,\n\nand those regarding ending such contracts, are therefore\n\nharmonious in their goals:     incentivizing efforts to combat\n\nsegregation, and protecting residents living in affordable\n\nhousing while maintaining economical mechanisms by which\n\nproperty owners can effectuate such a purpose.     Because the\n\ndefendants in this case have benefited -- starting with the\n\nfederally subsidized loans to undertake substantial renovations\n\non Burbank Apartments in the early 1970s -- from the incentives\n\nafforded by the Section 8 project-based subsidies, it is\n\nincumbent on them, should they choose to eschew such benefits,\n\nto do so in a manner that is in conformity with the legislative\n\naspirations based on which they initially entered into the\n\nSection 8 contract.    This is evidenced by the fact that Congress\n\nhas provided a program of enhanced vouchers, under which\n\nproperty owners like the defendants must act if they do not\n\nrenew their HAP.    See 12 U.S.C. § 4113(d).   This Federal\n\nrequirement underscores that, although Section 8 participation\n\nis initially voluntary, the policy ramifications that attend\n\nsuch participation endure beyond the term of the contract.       See\n\f                                                                   33\n\n\nGraoch, 508 F.3d at 376-377 (\"[T]o say that Section 8\n\nparticipation is 'voluntary' is only to say that a landlord does\n\nnot break the law by declining to participate. . . .    [A]lmost\n\nevery action that could create disparate-impact liability under\n\nthe FHA is voluntary\").27\n\n     This result is in accord with fair housing precedent, as\n\nviolating a regulation or breaking the law has never been a\n\nprerequisite to disparate impact liability.   See, e.g., Graoch,\n\nsupra at 376 n.5, 377 (court \"reject[ed] a categorical rule\n\nagainst disparate-impact challenges to withdrawals\" of private\n\nproperty owners from Section 8 voucher program, even though such\n\nwithdrawal from voluntary program was in accordance with statute\n\nand regulation:   \"[a]lthough Congress created the Section 8\n\nprogram six years after passing the FHA, . . . it did not\n\ninclude language indicating that Section 8 landlords should be\n\nexempt from any FHA requirements\").

See Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523.        To avoid\n\nthe risk of \"interpreting disparate-impact liability to be so\n\nexpansive as to inject racial considerations into every housing\n\ndecision,\" id. at 2524, courts must \"examine with care whether\n\nplaintiff[s] ha[ve] made out a prima facie case of disparate\n\nimpact.\"   Id. at 2523.    Fair housing claims based on the theory\n\nof disparate impact should therefore be limited to \"avoid the\n\nserious constitutional questions that might arise.\"          Id. at\n\n2522.    Such a showing, for instance, may not be \"imposed based\n\nsolely on a showing of a statistical disparity.\"       Id.     More\n\nparticularly, the plaintiffs cannot satisfy this burden \"[i]f a\n\nstatistical discrepancy is caused by factors other than the\n\ndefendant's policy.\"      Id. at 2514.

See, e.g., Merritt vs. Countrywide Fin. Corp., U.S.\nDist. Ct., No. 09-cv-01179-BLF (N.D. Cal. Sept. 17, 2015)\n(allowing plaintiffs to amend complaint after dismissal for\nfailure to show disparate impact or to identify specific policy\nthat causally links to alleged disparity); Ellis vs.\nMinneapolis, U.S. Dist.

Application to the present case.    The fair housing\n\nstatutes make it unlawful to \"make unavailable or deny[] a\n\ndwelling to any person because of race, color, religion, sex,\n\nfamilial status, or national origin,\" and bar discrimination\n\n\"against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\n. . . rental of a dwelling . . . because of race, color,\n\nreligion, sex, familial status, or national origin.\"     42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 3604(a)-(b).   See G. L. c. 151B, § 4 (6), (7), and (11).\n\nBased on the Supreme Court's pleading requirements, the\n\nplaintiffs must meet a \"robust causality requirement\" in order\n\nto show that a policy by the defendants created a\n\ndisproportionately negative statistical discrepancy in available\n\nhousing for members of a protected class.     See Inclusive\n\nCommunities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523; 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(a)-(b); G. L.\n\nc. 151B, § 4 (6), (7), and (11).   The plaintiffs have failed to\n\nsatisfy such pleading requirements.\n\n    The plaintiffs' housing discrimination claims are applied\n\nto two classes of individuals, the current tenants (with\n\nproject-based subsidies before the HAP lapsed) and the\n\nprospective tenants (whether or not they are on the waiting\n\nlist).   The claim for the current tenants boils down to two\n\nfacts:    (1) the defendants' decision not to renew their project-\n\nbased Section 8 subsidy contract has denied and will deny or\n\f                                                                    38\n\n\nwithhold housing from current low income tenants; (2) such\n\ntenants are disproportionately members of protected classes.\n\n    The plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded disparate\n\nimpact discrimination as to the existing tenants at Burbank.\n\nIndeed, the amended complaint does not set forth any harm to\n\nplausibly suggest an entitlement to relief.   See Flagg, 466\n\nMass. at 26-27.   All of the tenants previously enjoying the\n\nSection 8 project-based subsidies were deemed eligible for\n\nenhanced vouchers, which not only allow them to remain in their\n\napartments at Burbank, but also to choose to live at another\n\nproperty while still receiving Section 8 benefits.    The\n\nplaintiffs have not pointed to anything other than speculative\n\nprospective harm to these tenants.   See part 2.a, supra.     The\n\nsuggestion that at some point in the future rents might increase\n\nbeyond the level covered by the enhanced vouchers, or, because\n\nenhanced vouchers are subject to rescreening, some tenants might\n\nbe found ineligible at some point in the future, is inadequate\n\nto state a claim under Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6).\n\n    The claim that the defendants' decision disproportionately\n\ndisadvantaged the prospective tenants is also tenuous.      This\n\nclaim likewise is premised on two facts:   (1) the prospective\n\ntenants on the waiting list are disproportionately members of\n\nprotected classes; (2) without the benefit of project-based\n\nsubsidies, the prospective tenants will almost invariably not be\n\f                                                                    39\n\n\nable to afford to live in the sixty-seven project-based\n\nsubsidized units in which they might at some point in time have\n\nhad the chance to live absent the defendants' decision.    The\n\nclaim presents two problems.   First, it is speculative and\n\nindefinite.   There is no guarantee that any of the individuals\n\non the waiting list would have had the opportunity to take\n\nadvantage of the Section 8 housing at Burbank even if the\n\nproject-based HAP was renewed; prospective tenants' eligibility\n\nto move into the sixty-seven project-based units does not\n\nnecessarily mean they would actually, at some point in the\n\nfuture, have such an opportunity.   Indeed, the complaint offers\n\nno facts, beyond bare \"labels and conclusions,\" Iannacchino, 451\n\nMass. at 636, quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555, that, even if\n\nthose sixty-seven units did become available in the future, the\n\nprospective tenants who are members of a protected class would\n\nhave the opportunity to move in.    Second, and more importantly,\n\nthe allegations do not meet the \"robust causality requirement\"\n\nin showing that the defendants' actions resulted in a\n\nstatistical disparity, thereby supporting a claim that the\n\ndefendants disproportionately disadvantaged members of a\n\nprotected class.   See Inclusive Communities, 135 S. Ct. at 2523.\n\nIn the present case, it is apparent that, as of April 1, 2011,\n\nwhen the project-based subsidy ended, more tenants inhabiting\n\nBurbank units were eligible for Section 8 subsidies (129) than\n\f                                                                   40\n\n\never before (sixty-seven when the project-based subsidies\n\nended).   There were, then, more low and middle income tenants\n\n(who, based on the plaintiffs' statistics, are\n\ndisproportionately members of protected classes) eligible for\n\nfederally subsidized Section 8 housing (whether the enhanced\n\nvouchers are as beneficial as the project-based subsidies or\n\nnot) because of the defendants' decision.   The plaintiffs\n\ntherefore have not shown that the defendant's decision not to\n\nrenew their HAP has resulted in a disproportionately negative\n\nimpact on members of protected classes, and, in any event, they\n\ncannot meet the robust causality requirement necessary to\n\nsatisfy a prima facie disparate impact claim.\n\n    The effect of the defendants' decision not to renew the\n\nproject-based subsidies is therefore distinguishable from the\n\n\"heartland\" cases of disparate impact liability, id. at 2522, in\n\nwhich the defendant's actions unfairly function to \"exclude\n\n[members of protected classes] from certain neighborhoods\n\nwithout any sufficient justification,\" id., by, say, demolishing\n\na development and making it wholly unavailable.

It is likewise different from other\n\ncases in which the defendant's actions did or would alone have\n\ncaused a statistical disparity based on membership in a\n\nprotected class.

The complaint does not, for\n\ninstance, indicate that the defendants raised the rent for the\n\nBurbank units to such a degree that the PHA refused to pay them\n\nas unreasonable.   See 24 C.F.R. § 982.507; 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1437f(o)(10)(B) (PHAs allowed to refuse to pay unreasonable\n\nrents).   Had the defendants done so, thereby causing a\n\ndisproportionate disadvantage for tenants of protected classes\n\nwho had no other means to supplement the rental costs, it is\n\f                                                                    42\n\n\npossible that such actions would have resulted in a complaint\n\nthat satisfied the \"robust causality requirement\" necessary to\n\nplead a disparate impact liability claim.    Here, however, there\n\nis no evidence to show that the tenants occupying the sixty-\n\nseven units previously subsidized by project-based Section 8\n\nsubsidies are negatively affected by the currently offered\n\nSection 8 enhanced vouchers, nor is there any indication that\n\nthe defendants' decision will lead to a disproportionate\n\ndisadvantage to members of protected classes living in Burbank,\n\nspecifically, and the Fenway neighborhood, generally (whether\n\nthey sought to rent a project-based unit at Burbank or not).\n\n    We do not discern any alleged action by the defendants that\n\njustifies the imposition of disparate impact liability under the\n\ncircumstances, as the plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded\n\nthat the defendants' decision will cause any discriminatory\n\neffect.
