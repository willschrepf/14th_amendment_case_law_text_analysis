BELTRAN\ntransfer into the jail’s “gang module,” where he was attacked\nand injured by three other inmates. Solis appeals the district\ncourt’s verdict, following a bench trial, in favor of defendant\nMiguel Beltran, as well as the district court’s grant of sum-\nmary judgment in favor of the remaining defendants. We\nreverse the district court’s grant of summary judgment on the\nground that Solis was not given fair notice of the requirements\nand consequences of a summary judgment motion, as required\nby Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d 952 (9th Cir. 1998) (en banc).\nWe also reverse the verdict in favor of Beltran because the\ndistrict court erred in denying Solis a jury trial, and the error\nwas not harmless.\n\nI.   Background\n\n   Solis is an ex-member of a gang known as the Mexican\nMafia, or “La Eme.” He is currently serving a sentence of life\nwithout parole as a result of his conviction of first-degree\nmurder. Following his arrest on that charge, Solis was placed\nin the Los Angeles County jail.\n\n   According to Solis, he informed a female intake official\nduring his processing at the jail that he was an ex-member of\nthe Mexican Mafia and was therefore a “high control risk” in\nneed of special protection. The official told him to notify the\ndeputies at his cell block once he arrived. At that time, Solis\nwas required to fill out a “Segregation Assessment” form so\nthat his housing classification could be determined. He stated\non the form that he had been affiliated with gangs and that he\nhad never served as a police informant or witness for the state.\nIn response to the question, “Do you fear for your safety\nwhile in this facility?” Solis answered “No.” According to\nSolis, he did fear for his safety but answered “No” because\nactive gang members were present when he was filling out the\nform, and answering “Yes” would have drawn their attention\nto him. Solis was placed in Module 4700, which houses “gen-\neral population” inmates who are not under protective custody\nand are not segregated from other inmates.\n\f                COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN                   1439\n   Solis asserts that, shortly after arriving in Module 4700, he\nspoke informally with Deputy Miguel Beltran (“Beltran”), an\nofficer in the “Operation Safe Jail” (“OSJ”) unit, which was\nresponsible for gathering intelligence on gang activity in the\njail. Solis claims that he told Beltran he was “in trouble”\nbecause he was an ex-gang member who should have been in\nprotective custody, and that he showed Beltran several docu-\nments proving that he was a gang dropout. According to Solis,\nBeltran responded, “We’ll interview you.” Beltran denies ever\nhaving had such a conversation with Solis.\n\n   Solis asserts that on July 14, 1999, members of the OSJ\nunit interviewed him along with several other prisoners from\nModule 4700. He states that he believes that the primary\ninterviewer was named “Vargas” but that Beltran was present\nas well. According to Solis, he told his interviewers that he\nwas an ex-member of the Mexican Mafia and showed them\nthe documents confirming his status. He claims that “Vargas”\nthen asked him to be an informant for OSJ. Solis asserts that\nwhen he refused and requested placement in protective cus-\ntody, “Vargas” threatened to put him in the “gang module,”\na unit that houses active gang members. Solis objected, but\nwas nevertheless transferred to the “gang module” that same\nday.2\n\n   Two weeks later, around July 28, 1999, Solis was assaulted\nby three inmates in the gang module. He asserts that during\nthe beating, one of the assailants mentioned Beltran by name,\nstating, “Beltran was the one that gave you up, punk.” On\nAugust 2, as Solis was walking to the shower area, he\nreported the assault to Deputy John Gutierrez. He explained\nthat this was his first chance to report the beating because it\nwas the first time he had not been in the presence of his\nassailants since the attack. Gutierrez observed that Solis had\n  2\n    That Solis was transferred to the gang module is undisputed. As the\ndistrict court found, “There is no question that an event occurred, which\nchanged Plaintiff’s cell assignment . . . .”\n\f1440             COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nbruises on his torso, forearms, neck, and eye, and escorted\nhim to the clinic for medical attention. That day, Solis was\ntransferred out of the gang module to Module 3700.\n\n   On February 11, 2002, Solis filed a pro se complaint in fed-\neral court against Beltran, “Vargas,” Sheriff Lee Baca, the\nCounty of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s\nDepartment (“Defendants”),3 alleging violations of his civil\nrights under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988.\nHe argued, inter alia, that the Defendants retaliated against\nhim for refusing to “snitch” by placing him in the gang mod-\nule with knowledge of the attendant dangers, and that such\nretaliation was a custom or practice of the County.4 In his\ncomplaint he demanded a jury trial, both in the caption and at\nthe end of the pleading.\n\n   On September 20, 2004, the district court received the first\nof Solis’s two requests for appointment of counsel. The court\nrejected the request on the ground that no proof of service was\nattached to the motion. On November 3, 2004, the court filed\nan Order for Jury Trial, which set a trial date of April 5, 2005,\nand contained instructions regarding discovery, pretrial settle-\nment, and the submission of motions, instructions, and exhib-\nits in preparation for trial. At the bottom of the section\nrequiring the submission of jury instructions and special ver-\ndict forms, the order stated, “Failure of counsel to strictly fol-\nlow the provisions of this section . . . SHALL CONSTITUTE\nA WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL in all civil cases.”\n   3\n     The complaint also included various John and Jane Does, representing\ncustodial and medical personnel of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s\nDepartment. The district court did not mention these parties in any of its\nrulings.\n   4\n     A municipality may be held liable for the unconstitutional acts of its\nofficials if those acts were done pursuant to a “policy or custom” of the\nmunicipality. See Monell v. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 694\n(1978).\n\f              COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN              1441\n   On January 19, 2005, the Defendants filed a motion for\nsummary judgment, to which Solis filed an opposition on\nFebruary 22. The Defendants then filed objections to Solis’s\nsummary judgment opposition, complaining that the opposi-\ntion was filed nine days late, did not contain a separate state-\nment of undisputed facts, and was supported only by hearsay\nor documents that had not been properly disclosed. The dis-\ntrict court accepted Solis’s untimely opposition and granted\nthe Defendants summary judgment as to Solis’s Monell claim\nand his § 1986 claim. It also dismissed Solis’s claims against\nSheriff Baca, noting that Solis had “not shown any evidence\nthat Sheriff Baca should be held individually liable.” The\ncourt did find, however, that Solis had presented enough evi-\ndence to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect\nto Beltran, and thus denied summary judgment on Solis’s\n§§ 1981, 1983, and 1985 claims against him.\n\n   Two weeks later, during a March 21, 2005, pretrial confer-\nence at which Solis appeared telephonically, the district court\nstated that Solis “did not file a jury demand” and had waived\njury trial “due to the non-submission of required pretrial doc-\numents.” Noting that Solis’s confinement was a “substantial\nbarrier to his attendance at trial,” the district court announced\nthat it would conduct the trial as a “Court Trial by videotape\ndepositions.” Solis subsequently filed a second request for\nappointment of counsel, explaining that his education was\nlimited to an eighth-grade level, that he had no legal educa-\ntion and limited access to legal materials, and that the case\ninvolved complex legal issues that required discovery of doc-\numents and depositions of a number of witnesses. He also\nreiterated his demand for a jury trial. The district court denied\nthe request for counsel without explanation.\n\n   Having reviewed the videotaped depositions and corre-\nsponding transcripts of Solis, Beltran, and Gutierrez, the dis-\ntrict court issued its “Statement of Decision” on July 14,\n2005. Finding that there was “no question that an event\noccurred which changed [Solis’s] cell assignment and directly\n\f1442           COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nled to [Solis’s] injuries,” the district court criticized Beltran\nfor being “less than forthcoming with regard to the presenta-\ntion of evidence” that should have been in his immediate con-\ntrol. The district court also concluded that Solis’s “version as\nto many of the events seems more credible than that of Defen-\ndant’s witnesses.” Nevertheless, the district court ruled in Bel-\ntran’s favor on the ground that Solis was “unable to provide\nsufficient evidence to sustain a finding of liability.” There was\nno separate order setting forth the judgment apart from the\nStatement of Decision. The district court ordered Solis to pay\na bill of costs in the amount of $1,115 for trial and deposition\nfees.\n\n   Solis filed a Notice of Appeal on October 18, 2005. He\nargues that (1) summary judgment was improper; (2) the dis-\ntrict court deprived him of his right to a jury by adjudicating\nhis claim against Beltran via a bench trial “by videotape depo-\nsitions,” and that, in any event, the district court’s verdict in\nfavor of Beltran was wrong on the merits; and (3) the district\ncourt abused its discretion in refusing to appoint Solis coun-\nsel. We address each issue in turn.\n\nII.    Discussion\n\n                       A.   Jurisdiction\n\n   [1] As a preliminary matter, we reject the Defendants’ con-\ntention that this Court lacks jurisdiction because Solis’s notice\nof appeal was untimely. Notice of appeal must be filed within\n30 days “after the judgment . . . is entered,” subject to certain\nexceptions. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). A judgment is not\n“entered” for the purposes of Rule 4(a) unless it complies\nwith Rules 58(a) and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7); Beaudry Motor Co. v. Abko\nProps., Inc., 780 F.2d 751, 754 (9th Cir. 1986). Rule 58(a)(1)\nrequires that every judgment be set forth on a separate docu-\nment, with certain exceptions not applicable here. Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 58(a)(1). Rule 79(a) details the civil docketing procedure\n\f                 COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN                     1443\nto be followed by the district court clerk when entering the\njudgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 79(a). When judgment is not set\nforth on a separate document as required by Rule 58(a)(1), it\nis considered “entered” when 150 days have run from nota-\ntion in the civil docket. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii).\n\n   [2] The district court’s “Statement of Decision” was issued\non July 14, 2005, and entered on the docket, in accordance\nwith Rule 79(a), on July 15, 2005. The district court did not,\nhowever, set forth the judgment on a separate document as\nrequired by Rule 58(a)(1).5 Therefore, judgment was not “en-\ntered” until December 12, 2005, 150 days after the Statement\nof Decision was noted in the civil docket. As a result, Solis’s\nOctober 18, 2005, Notice of Appeal was timely, see Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (“A notice of appeal filed after the court\nannounces a decision or order—but before the entry of the\njudgment or order—is treated as filed on the date of and after\nthe entry.”), and we accordingly have jurisdiction to consider\nSolis’s claims on appeal.\n\n                      B.    Summary Judgment\n\n  Solis argues that the district court’s grant of summary judg-\nment in favor of the Defendants (excluding Beltran) was inap-\npropriate because he was not given fair notice of the\nrequirements and consequences of a summary judgment\nmotion, as required by Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d 952 (9th\nCir. 1998) (en banc). We review a district court’s grant of\n  5\n   Central District of California Local Rule 58-6 states that “[n]otation in\nthe civil docket of entry of a memorandum of decision, an opinion of the\nCourt, or a minute order of the Clerk shall not constitute entry of judgment\npursuant to F.R. Civ. P. 58 and 79(a) unless specifically ordered by the\njudge.” The district judge in this case did not include any language in the\nStatement of Decision indicating that he was ordering the notation of the\nStatement in the civil docket to constitute entry of judgment. See Radio\nTelevision Espanola S.A. v. New World Entm’t, Ltd., 183 F.3d 922, 931-\n32 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\f1444            COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nsummary judgment de novo. Lynn v. Sheet Metal Workers’\nInt’l Ass’n, 804 F.2d 1472, 1477 (9th Cir. 1986).\n\n   [3] In Rand, we reaffirmed the longstanding principle that\na pro se prisoner is entitled to fair notice of the requirements\nand consequences of the summary judgment rule. Rand, 154\nF.3d at 959. We further held that either the district court or the\nsummary judgment movant may provide the prisoner with\nnotice,6 and that “[i]f the movant provides the notice, it must\nbe in a separate form that the plaintiff will recognize as given\npursuant to the court’s requirement. It may not be provided\nwithin the summary judgment motion or in the papers ordi-\nnarily filed in support of the motion.” Id. at 960. Finally, we\noutlined the contents required for sufficient notice, holding\nthat the notice “must be phrased in ordinary, understandable\nlanguage” and that it must inform the prisoner both of his\n“right to file counter-affidavits or other responsive evidentiary\nmaterials” and, “most importantly, . . . of the effect of losing\non summary judgment.” Id.\n\n   [4] Here, neither the district court nor the Defendants pro-\nvided the notice Rand requires. The district court issued\ninstructions regarding preparation for trial in its “Order for\nJury Trial.” Under the heading “Motions for Summary Judg-\nment or Partial Summary Judgment,” the district court stated\nonly that “[m]otions for summary judgment or partial sum-\nmary judgment shall be filed as soon as practical, however, in\nno event later than the motion cut-off date.” Its order con-\ntained no instructions regarding either the requirements of\nresponding to or the consequences of losing on summary\njudgment. Specifically, the district court’s order did not alert\nSolis “to the fact that the failure to [file responsive evidentiary\nmaterials] might result in the entry of summary judgment\nagainst” him, Rand, 154 F.3d at 960, and it certainly did not\n  6\n   In doing so, we explicitly overruled Arreola v. Mangaong, 65 F.3d\n801, 802 (9th Cir. 1995) (per curiam), which held that the notice must be\ngiven by the district court itself.\n\f                 COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN                     1445\n“inform [Solis] that if the motion for summary judgment is\ngranted, [his] case will be over,” id.\n\n   [5] Nor did the Defendants provide, “in a separate form” as\nrequired by Rand, any notice describing the procedural\nrequirements Solis must meet in countering the summary\njudgment motion or the consequences of failing to meet those\nrequirements, including the fact that losing on summary judg-\nment would mean the effective termination of his case.7 See\nid. at 960-61; see also id. at 962 (holding that the defendants’\ntwo-page notice of rules relating to summary judgment,\nalthough it alerted the pro se prisoner of his right to file\nresponsive materials and the consequences of failing to do so,\nwas nevertheless insufficient because it was not phrased in\nordinary language and did not inform the plaintiff of the effect\nof losing on summary judgment).\n\n   [6] Thus, because Solis was not given fair notice,\ndemanded by Rand, of the requirements and consequences of\na summary judgment motion, we reverse the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of all defendants other\nthan Beltran and remand all claims that were dismissed at that\nstage, with one exception: we agree with the district court that\nSolis’s § 1986 claim was untimely,8 and therefore we affirm\n  7\n     Not only did the Defendants fail to inform Solis of the proper proce-\ndures for responding to a summary judgment motion, they sought to take\nadvantage of Solis’s lack of understanding regarding those procedural\nrequirements. Defendants’ “Objections to Plaintiff’s Opposition to Sum-\nmary Judgment” focused almost exclusively on Solis’s failure to meet the\nprocedural and evidentiary requirements of countering a summary judg-\nment motion—it complained that Solis’s opposition was filed nine days\nlate, did not contain a separate statement of undisputed facts, and was sup-\nported only by hearsay or documents that had not been properly disclosed.\n   8\n     Section 1986 provides that “no action under the provisions of this sec-\ntion shall be sustained which is not commenced within one year after the\ncause of action has accrued.” 42 U.S.C. § 1986. Solis filed his federal\ncomplaint in February 2002, nearly three years after his alleged injuries\ntook place.\n\f1446            COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nthe grant of summary judgment as to that claim. Otherwise,\nwe decline to conduct harmless error analysis, as “harmless\nerror review is inappropriate in most cases” of Rand violation,\nid. at 961, and this is not the “unusual case where the harm-\nlessness of the failure to give the required notice may be\nestablished on the record or by judicial notice,” id. See also\nid. at 960-61 (holding that harmlessness analysis may be\nappropriate where the record clearly shows that the plaintiff\nhad received Rand notice in prior litigation or that he “has a\ncomplete understanding of Rule 56’s requirements gained\nfrom some other source”).9\n\n                            C.   Jury Trial\n\n   Solis also argues that the district court erred in holding a\nbench trial “by videotape depositions” instead of a jury trial\nto adjudicate his claims against Beltran, and that such error\nwarrants reversal of its verdict in favor of that defendant.\nWhether a party is entitled to a jury trial is a question of law\nwe review de novo. Frost v. Agnos, 152 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th\nCir. 1998). “The unconstitutional denial of a jury trial must be\nreversed unless the error is harmless.” United States v. Cal.\nMobile Home Park Mgmt. Co., 107 F.3d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir.\n1997).\n\n   The Seventh Amendment guarantees the right to a trial by\njury “[i]n Suits at common law, where the value in contro-\nversy shall exceed twenty dollars.” U.S. Const. Am. VII. Like\nother constitutional rights, the right to a jury trial in civil suits\ncan be waived. United States v. Moore, 340 U.S. 616, 621\n(1951); Kulas v. Flores, 255 F.3d 780, 784 (9th Cir. 2001);\nsee also 8 Moore’s Federal Practice § 38.52[1][b] (3d ed.\n2006). “Because the right to a jury trial is a fundamental right\n  9\n    That Solis met the requirements for countering summary judgment as\nto one defendant does not mean that he necessarily understood all that was\nrequired or what the consequences would be if he did not meet those\nrequirements as to the others.\n\f                 COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN                        1447\nguaranteed to our citizenry by the Constitution,” however,\n“courts should indulge every reasonable presumption against\nwaiver.” Pradier v. Elespuru, 641 F.2d 808, 811 (9th Cir.\n1981); see also Aetna Ins. Co. v. Kennedy, 301 U.S. 389, 393\n(1937).\n\n   [7] Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 38(b) requires a party\nwishing to assert the right of trial by jury to “demand a trial\nby jury . . . by (1) serving upon the other parties a demand\ntherefor in writing at any time after the commencement of the\naction and not later than 10 days after the service of the last\npleading directed to such issue, and (2) filing the demand as\nrequired by Rule 5(d).” The rule also specifies that “[s]uch\ndemand may be indorsed upon a pleading of the party.” Fed.\nR. Civ. P. 38(b).10 A party’s failure to serve and file the\ndemand in the manner specified in Rule 38(b) constitutes a\nwaiver of the right to a trial by jury. Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(d).\nOnce a demand for jury trial has been properly made, how-\never, it “may not be withdrawn without the consent of the par-\nties.” Id. “Rule 39(a) . . . sets forth the manner in which this\nconsent may be granted.” Reid Bros. Logging Co. v. Ketchi-\nkan Pulp Co., 699 F.2d 1292, 1304 n.20 (9th Cir. 1983). It\nrequires consent to be made “by written stipulation filed with\nthe court or by an oral stipulation made in open court and\nentered in the record.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 39(a)(1).11\n  10\n      In the Central District of California, Local Rule 38-1 further provides\nthat “[i]f the demand for jury trial is included in a pleading, it shall be set\nforth at the end thereof and be signed by the attorney for the party making\nthe demand. The caption of such a pleading shall also contain the follow-\ning: ‘DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL.’ ”\n   11\n      Effective December 1, 2007, the language of Rules 38 and 39 were\n“amended as part of the general restyling of the Civil Rules to make them\nmore easily understood and to make style and terminology consistent\nthroughout the rules.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 38 & 39 advisory committee notes.\nRule 38(b) now states that a party “may demand a jury trial by: (1) serving\nthe other parties with a written demand—which may be included in a\npleading—no later than 10 days after the last pleading directed to the issue\nis served; and (2) filing the demand in accordance with Rule 5(d)”; Rule\n\f1448             COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\n   The district court stated two reasons for its decision to con-\nduct a bench trial rather than a jury trial with respect to Solis’s\nclaim against Beltran. First, the district court found that Solis\n“did not file a jury demand.” Second, the district court stated\nthat Solis had waived his right to a trial by jury “due to the\nnon-submission of required pretrial documents.” We hold that\nboth of the district court’s reasons for denying Solis a jury\ntrial were faulty: Solis clearly demanded a jury trial and never\nwithdrew that demand, and the district court’s imposition of\na penalty of forfeiture of that right for failing to comply with\na procedural pre-trial requirement was invalid. Because the\ndistrict court’s denial of a jury trial was not harmless error, we\nreverse the district court’s verdict against Solis and remand\nfor a new trial, this time by jury.\n\n  1.    Solis demanded a trial by jury.\n\n   [8] The district court’s finding that Solis “did not file a jury\ndemand” was plainly in error. Solis included the words “DE-\nMAND FOR JURY TRIAL” in the caption of his complaint\nas well as on the last page, which also contained the unambig-\nuous statement, “Plaintiff hereby requests a trial by jury.”\nThus, it is clear that Solis complied with both the spirit and\nthe letter of Federal Rule 38(b), as well as Local Rule 38-1,\nby unequivocally demanding a jury trial in both the caption\nand at the end of his pleading.\n\n   [9] Moreover, there can be no question that both the district\ncourt and the Defendants were aware of Solis’s demand for a\njury trial: the district court entered an “Order for Jury Trial,”\n\n38(d) now states that a “proper demand may be withdrawn only if the par-\nties consent”; and Rule 39(a)(1) now states that, once a demand is made,\nthe trial “must be by jury unless . . . the parties or their attorneys file a\nstipulation to a nonjury trial or so stipulate on the record.” These changes\nto the rules’ wording were “intended to be stylistic only,” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n38 & 39 advisory committee notes, and have no effect on the substance\nof our decision.\n\f               COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN              1449\nthe case was docketed for jury trial, and the Defendants filed\nproposed jury instructions with the court. Indeed, the Defen-\ndants do not dispute on appeal that they were aware of Solis’s\nrequest. Therefore, because Solis’s jury demand was “suffi-\nciently clear to alert” both the Defendants and the district\ncourt “that a jury trial [wa]s requested,” Lutz v. Glendale\nUnion High Sch., 403 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir. 2005), the\ndistrict court’s finding that Solis “did not file a jury demand”\nwas clearly erroneous.\n\n  2.   Solis did not waive his right to a jury trial.\n\n   The district court also found, as a separate ground for deny-\ning Solis a jury trial, that Solis had waived his right to a trial\nby jury “due to the non-submission of required pretrial\ndocuments”—specifically, Solis’s failure to file proposed jury\ninstructions and special verdict forms, despite the district\ncourt’s warning in its Order for Jury Trial that failure to do\nso would “CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL in\nall civil cases.”\n\n   [10] When a party properly files a jury demand under the\nrequirements of Rule 38(b), he has satisfied all that is required\nby the Rules to avoid waiver, and his jury demand “may not\nbe withdrawn without the consent of the parties.” Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 38(d); see also Pradier, 641 F.2d at 810. The district\njudge’s waiver provision required Solis to satisfy additional\nprocedural requirements beyond filing a jury demand—\nnamely, the filing of jury instructions and special verdict\nforms—or to forfeit his jury trial right. This rule was clearly\ninconsistent with Rule 38(d)’s limitation of waiver to the fail-\nure to file a jury demand and consequently cannot be\nenforced. See Pradier, 641 F.2d at 810 (“[I]f Local Rule 22\nis inconsistent with Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(b), it cannot be\nenforced.”); Rutledge v. Elec. Hose & Rubber Co., 511 F.2d\n668, 674 (9th Cir. 1975) (holding a local rule valid where its\n“requirements . . . do not conflict with any of the provisions\nof Rule 38”).\n\f1450           COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\n   [11] “The demand for a jury trial having been properly\nmade under Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(b), the failure to fulfill an addi-\ntional requirement of a local rule . . . cannot constitute a\nwaiver of a trial by jury.” Pradier, 641 F.2d at 811. Solis\nproperly demanded a jury trial pursuant to the requirements of\nRule 38(b). The district court’s determination that his failure\nto file proposed jury instructions and special verdict forms\nconstituted a waiver of his right to a trial by jury was there-\nfore erroneous.\n\n  3.   Solis did not consent to the withdrawal of his jury\n       demand.\n\n   The Defendants argue, nevertheless, that by “participat[ing]\nin the [bench trial], inform[ing] the court of the witnesses he\nintended to call, and . . . not contest[ing] or object[ing] to the\ncourt’s finding of a waiver of jury trial,” Solis effectively con-\nsented to the bench trial. We find this argument without merit.\n\n   Rule 38(d) states unequivocally that a “demand for trial by\njury . . . may not be withdrawn without the consent of the par-\nties,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(d) (emphasis added), and Rule 39(a)\nspecifies that such consent must be made by written or oral\nstipulation. There is no dispute that Solis did not stipulate,\neither orally or in writing, to consent to a bench trial. Thus,\nit is clear that, under Federal Rules 38 and 39, Solis never\nwithdrew his jury trial demand.\n\n   [12] Nevertheless, this court has held that “knowing partici-\npation in a bench trial without objection is sufficient to consti-\ntute a jury waiver,” the literal requirements of Rule 39(a)\nnotwithstanding. White v. McGinnis, 903 F.2d 699, 703 (9th\nCir. 1990) (en banc). We have made clear, however, that this\nnarrow exception to the formal requirements of Rules 38 and\n39 applies only when the party claiming the jury trial right is\nattempting to act strategically—participating in the bench trial\nin the hopes of achieving a favorable outcome, then asserting\nlack of consent to the bench trial when the result turns out to\n\f               COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN               1451\nbe unfavorable to him. See Fuller v. City of Oakland, 47 F.3d\n1522, 1531 (9th Cir. 1995) (stating that a primary rationale\nbehind White is the principle that “a party ought not to have\ntwo bites at the procedural apple”). In White, for example,\nalthough the district court set the case for a bench trial despite\nthe appellant’s timely jury trial demand, the appellant “never\nbrought his prior jury demand to the district court’s attention\nduring the five and one-half month period between the bench\ntrial notice and the trial,” “sat through the entire bench trial\nand never once objected to the absence of a jury while his\ncounsel vigorously argued his case to the judge,” and did not\n“notify the court of its mistake before it entered judgment\nagainst him.” White, 903 F.2d at 700. We held that the appel-\nlant’s “vigorous participation in [the] bench trial, without so\nmuch as a mention of a jury” constituted a “knowledgeable\nrelinquishment of the prior jury demand.” Id. at 703. In avoid-\ning an overly rigid application of Rule 39, we emphasized the\nequities involved, stressing that because the appellant “chose\nto argue his case fully before the district judge,” it was “not\nunjust to hold him to that commitment.” Id.\n\n   [13] Not every participation in a bench trial constitutes con-\nsent to the waiver of a jury trial, however. When a party par-\nticipates in the bench trial ordered by the trial court while\ncontinuing to demand a jury trial, his “continuing objection”\nis “sufficient to preserve his right to appeal the denial of his\nrequest for a jury.” United States v. Nordbrock, 941 F.2d 947,\n950 (9th Cir. 1991); see also California Mobile Home, 107\nF.3d at 1380 (noting that “no Court has expanded [White] to\nfind a waiver of a right to a jury trial where a plaintiff actively\ncontests the district court’s decision to refuse the demand”);\nWhite, 903 F.2d at 703 (holding that “knowing participation\nin a bench trial without objection” constitutes a jury waiver)\n(emphasis added). This is because the party in such a case is\nnot seeking “two bites at the procedural apple” like the appel-\nlant in White. Fuller, 47 F.3d at 1531. Rather, when a trial\ncourt denies a party a jury trial despite the party’s continuing\ndemand, the party has little choice but to accede to the trial\n\f1452             COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\ncourt’s ruling and participate in the bench trial. See Nord-\nbrock, 941 F.2d at 950 (“His assent to the [bench trial] was\nreasonable in light of the court’s earlier ruling that implicitly\ndenied the demand for a jury trial.”). Reluctant participation\nin a bench trial does not waive one’s Seventh Amendment\nright to a jury trial under White’s narrow exception to Rule\n39(a).\n\n   [14] In this case, it is clear that Solis was not seeking “two\nbites at the procedural apple” by “participating” in the “Court\nTrial by videotape depositions.” Once the district court found,\nerroneously, that Solis had waived his right to a jury trial,\nSolis had little option but to make his objection known and go\nforward with the bench trial as best he could. That he did so\ndoes not constitute “knowledgeable relinquishment of the\nprior jury demand.” White, 903 F.2d at 703. Like the appellant\nin Nordbrock, Solis did bring his prior jury demand to the dis-\ntrict court’s attention during the “period between the bench\ntrial notice and the trial.” White, 903 F.2d at 700. He noted\nthat demand in his second motion for counsel, filed after the\ndistrict court found that he had waived his jury right.12 Fur-\nthermore, in contrast to the appellant in White, Solis’s “partic-\nipation” in the bench trial was far from “vigorous,” see id. at\n703—the “trial” consisted solely of the court’s review of vid-\neotaped deposition testimony, during which the parties were\nnot even present. Therefore, indulging “every reasonable pre-\nsumption against the waiver of the jury trial,” Nordbrock, 941\nF.2d at 950 (citing Pradier, 641 F.2d at 811), as we are bound\nto do, we hold that Solis did not, by participating in the dis-\n  12\n     Although Solis included his statement that he had “demanded a jury\ntrial” in his motion for counsel, rather than in a separate filing, we con-\nstrue it as a “continuing demand” under Nordbrock pursuant to our “policy\nof liberal construction in favor of pro se litigants,” Rand, 154 F.3d at 957;\nsee also Abassi v. INS, 305 F.3d 1028, 1032 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[W]e have\nconsistently held that procedural requirements should be more liberally\nconstrued for pro se litigants.”). Moreover, it appears that at that time\nSolis believed that he was still entitled to and would receive a trial by jury.\n\f              COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN              1453\ntrict court’s bench trial by videotape depositions, consent to\nthe withdrawal of his prior jury demand.\n\n  4.   The district court’s erroneous denial of a jury trial was\n       not harmless.\n\n   [15] Having concluded that the district court erred in deny-\ning Solis a jury trial, we must determine whether that error\nwas harmless. See Fuller, 47 F.3d at 1533. “The denial will\nbe harmless only if ‘no reasonable jury could have found for\nthe losing party, and the trial court could have granted a\ndirected verdict for the prevailing party.’ ” Id. (quoting Davis\n& Cox v. Summa Corp., 751 F.2d 1507, 1517 (9th Cir. 1985)).\n\n   We hold that the district court’s denial of Solis’s jury trial\nright was not harmless. Solis needed to prove the constitu-\ntional violation he asserted—namely, that Beltran acted with\ndeliberate indifference in failing to protect him from attacks\nby other inmates, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, see\nHearns v. Terhune, 413 F.3d 1036, 1040 (9th Cir. 2005)—by\nonly a preponderance of the evidence. See Tatum v. City &\nCounty of San Francisco, 441 F.3d 1090, 1094 (9th Cir.\n2006). Deliberate indifference occurs when “the official acted\nor failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of\nserious harm.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 841 (1990).\nSolis testified that he twice told Beltran that he was a gang\ndrop-out and that he presented documentary evidence to Bel-\ntran establishing his status as an ex-Eme member, thereby\nputting Beltran—who himself testified that he had authority\nto change Solis’s housing assignment—on notice that a trans-\nfer to the gang module could foreseeably result in Solis being\nattacked. Solis also testified that one of the inmates who\nassaulted him implicated Beltran directly in Solis’s transfer to\nthe gang unit, stating that “Beltran was the one that gave\n[him] up.” Beltran, in turn, offered no explanation for Solis’s\ntransfer; his defense amounted to little more than a bald denial\nof any knowledge of or interaction with Solis. The district\ncourt itself found Beltran’s presentation of evidence “less than\n\f1454             COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nforthcoming,” and determined that Solis’s “version as to\nmany of the events seem[ed] more credible than that of [Bel-\ntran’s] witnesses.”\n\n   [16] Given the relative credibility of the witnesses, a rea-\nsonable jury could have found that Solis, through his docu-\nments establishing his ex-gang member status as well as\nthrough his testimony that Beltran was aware of that status,\nproved by a preponderance of the evidence that Beltran acted\nwith deliberate indifference in transferring him to the gang\nmodule. Compare Frost, 152 F.3d at 1131. Therefore, the dis-\ntrict court’s erroneous denial of a jury trial was not harmless\nand, consequently, we remand for retrial of Solis’s case\nbefore a jury.13\n\n            D.    Request for appointment of counsel\n\n   Finally, Solis argues that the district court abused its discre-\ntion in denying his request for the appointment of counsel.\nTitle 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1) permits the district court, in its\ndiscretion, to “request an attorney to represent any person\nunable to afford counsel.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1); see also\nAgyeman v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 390 F.3d 1101, 1103 (9th Cir.\n2004), cert. denied sub nom. Gerber v. Agyeman, 545 U.S.\n1128 (2005). In this case, Solis twice requested the appoint-\nment of counsel. The district court rejected Solis’s first\nrequest on the ground that no proof of service was attached.\nIn denying Solis’s second request, the district court stated\nonly that “[t]he Court has reviewed the motion for appoint-\n  13\n    Solis requests that we reverse the district court’s finding in favor of\nBeltran and direct a verdict for him. Although we believe that a reasonable\njury could have found for Solis on the evidence presented, we do not\nbelieve that his evidence was so strong that no reasonable jury could have\nfound for Beltran, see Ritchie v. United States, 451 F.3d 1019, 1023 (9th\nCir. 2006) (“[J]udgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if no rea-\nsonable jury could find in favor of the non-moving party.”), and therefore\nwe decline to direct a verdict in Solis’s favor.\n\f               COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN               1455\nment of counsel, filed by plaintiff on April 28, 2005. The\nmotion is denied.”\n\n   [17] We note that a jury trial will occur in this case, and\nthat Solis is incarcerated in a penal institution and is without\nlegal training. In fact, his education ended at the eighth grade\nlevel. He is ill-suited to conduct a trial. We also note that\nthere may well be merit to his claims. However, because the\ndistrict court failed to articulate its reasons for denying Solis’s\nrequest, we cannot determine on appellate review whether its\ndenial constituted an abuse of discretion. See United Nat’l Ins.\nCo. v. R & D Latex Corp., 141 F.3d 916, 919 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(“[M]eaningful appellate review for abuse of discretion is\nforeclosed when the district court fails to articulate its reason-\ning.”); United States v. 30.64 Acres of Land, 795 F.2d 796,\n804 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that the district court “does not\ndischarge [its] duty [under § 1915(e)(1)] if it makes no\nattempt to request the assistance of volunteer counsel or,\nwhere the record is not otherwise clear, explain its failure to\ndo so”). Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s order\ndenying Solis’s motion to appoint counsel and instruct the\ndistrict court on remand to reconsider his request. If the dis-\ntrict court should, after considering all the relevant factors,\nincluding those mentioned above, decide once again to deny\nSolis’s motion for appointment of counsel, it must provide an\nadequate explanation of its reasons such that its decision may\nbe reviewed by us on appeal.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n   Because Solis was not provided notice of the requirements\nand consequences of summary judgement, as required by\nRand, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary judg-\nment in favor of the defendants other than Beltran and remand\nall dismissed claims involving them (except for Solis’s\nuntimely § 1986 claim). We also reverse the district court’s\nverdict in favor of Beltran and remand for a new trial before\na jury. The district court erred in denying Solis a jury trial: he\n\f1456           COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nproperly demanded such a trial; his failure to submit specified\npretrial documents cannot constitute a waiver of the jury\nright; and his “participation” in the bench trial did not amount\nto consent to a waiver of his prior jury demand. The failure\nto afford Solis a jury trial was not harmless error, as a reason-\nable jury could have found that Beltran violated Solis’s con-\nstitutional rights. Finally, we reverse the district court’s denial\nof Solis’s request for appointment of counsel and remand on\nthat issue as well. Because our reversal means that Beltran is\nno longer the “prevailing party,” we vacate the bill of costs\nordered against Solis. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d).\n\n  The case is REVERSED and REMANDED, and the bill of\ncosts is VACATED.\n\f",

Background\n\n   Solis is an ex-member of a gang known as the Mexican\nMafia, or “La Eme.” He is currently serving a sentence of life\nwithout parole as a result of his conviction of first-degree\nmurder. Following his arrest on that charge, Solis was placed\nin the Los Angeles County jail.\n\n   According to Solis, he informed a female intake official\nduring his processing at the jail that he was an ex-member of\nthe Mexican Mafia and was therefore a “high control risk” in\nneed of special protection. The official told him to notify the\ndeputies at his cell block once he arrived. At that time, Solis\nwas required to fill out a “Segregation Assessment” form so\nthat his housing classification could be determined. He stated\non the form that he had been affiliated with gangs and that he\nhad never served as a police informant or witness for the state.\nIn response to the question, “Do you fear for your safety\nwhile in this facility?” Solis answered “No.” According to\nSolis, he did fear for his safety but answered “No” because\nactive gang members were present when he was filling out the\nform, and answering “Yes” would have drawn their attention\nto him. Solis was placed in Module 4700, which houses “gen-\neral population” inmates who are not under protective custody\nand are not segregated from other inmates.\n\f                COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN                   1439\n   Solis asserts that, shortly after arriving in Module 4700, he\nspoke informally with Deputy Miguel Beltran (“Beltran”), an\nofficer in the “Operation Safe Jail” (“OSJ”) unit, which was\nresponsible for gathering intelligence on gang activity in the\njail. Solis claims that he told Beltran he was “in trouble”\nbecause he was an ex-gang member who should have been in\nprotective custody, and that he showed Beltran several docu-\nments proving that he was a gang dropout. According to Solis,\nBeltran responded, “We’ll interview you.” Beltran denies ever\nhaving had such a conversation with Solis.\n\n   Solis asserts that on July 14, 1999, members of the OSJ\nunit interviewed him along with several other prisoners from\nModule 4700. He states that he believes that the primary\ninterviewer was named “Vargas” but that Beltran was present\nas well. According to Solis, he told his interviewers that he\nwas an ex-member of the Mexican Mafia and showed them\nthe documents confirming his status. He claims that “Vargas”\nthen asked him to be an informant for OSJ. Solis asserts that\nwhen he refused and requested placement in protective cus-\ntody, “Vargas” threatened to put him in the “gang module,”\na unit that houses active gang members. Solis objected, but\nwas nevertheless transferred to the “gang module” that same\nday.2\n\n   Two weeks later, around July 28, 1999, Solis was assaulted\nby three inmates in the gang module. He asserts that during\nthe beating, one of the assailants mentioned Beltran by name,\nstating, “Beltran was the one that gave you up, punk.” On\nAugust 2, as Solis was walking to the shower area, he\nreported the assault to Deputy John Gutierrez. He explained\nthat this was his first chance to report the beating because it\nwas the first time he had not been in the presence of his\nassailants since the attack. Gutierrez observed that Solis had\n  2\n    That Solis was transferred to the gang module is undisputed. As the\ndistrict court found, “There is no question that an event occurred, which\nchanged Plaintiff’s cell assignment . . . .”\n\f1440             COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nbruises on his torso, forearms, neck, and eye, and escorted\nhim to the clinic for medical attention. That day, Solis was\ntransferred out of the gang module to Module 3700.\n\n   On February 11, 2002, Solis filed a pro se complaint in fed-\neral court against Beltran, “Vargas,” Sheriff Lee Baca, the\nCounty of Los Angeles, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s\nDepartment (“Defendants”),3 alleging violations of his civil\nrights under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988.\nHe argued, inter alia, that the Defendants retaliated against\nhim for refusing to “snitch” by placing him in the gang mod-\nule with knowledge of the attendant dangers, and that such\nretaliation was a custom or practice of the County.4 In his\ncomplaint he demanded a jury trial, both in the caption and at\nthe end of the pleading.\n\n   On September 20, 2004, the district court received the first\nof Solis’s two requests for appointment of counsel. The court\nrejected the request on the ground that no proof of service was\nattached to the motion. On November 3, 2004, the court filed\nan Order for Jury Trial, which set a trial date of April 5, 2005,\nand contained instructions regarding discovery, pretrial settle-\nment, and the submission of motions, instructions, and exhib-\nits in preparation for trial. At the bottom of the section\nrequiring the submission of jury instructions and special ver-\ndict forms, the order stated, “Failure of counsel to strictly fol-\nlow the provisions of this section . . . SHALL CONSTITUTE\nA WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL in all civil cases.”\n   3\n     The complaint also included various John and Jane Does, representing\ncustodial and medical personnel of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s\nDepartment. The district court did not mention these parties in any of its\nrulings.\n   4\n     A municipality may be held liable for the unconstitutional acts of its\nofficials if those acts were done pursuant to a “policy or custom” of the\nmunicipality.

BELTRAN              1441\n   On January 19, 2005, the Defendants filed a motion for\nsummary judgment, to which Solis filed an opposition on\nFebruary 22. The Defendants then filed objections to Solis’s\nsummary judgment opposition, complaining that the opposi-\ntion was filed nine days late, did not contain a separate state-\nment of undisputed facts, and was supported only by hearsay\nor documents that had not been properly disclosed. The dis-\ntrict court accepted Solis’s untimely opposition and granted\nthe Defendants summary judgment as to Solis’s Monell claim\nand his § 1986 claim. It also dismissed Solis’s claims against\nSheriff Baca, noting that Solis had “not shown any evidence\nthat Sheriff Baca should be held individually liable.” The\ncourt did find, however, that Solis had presented enough evi-\ndence to create a genuine issue of material fact with respect\nto Beltran, and thus denied summary judgment on Solis’s\n§§ 1981, 1983, and 1985 claims against him.\n\n   Two weeks later, during a March 21, 2005, pretrial confer-\nence at which Solis appeared telephonically, the district court\nstated that Solis “did not file a jury demand” and had waived\njury trial “due to the non-submission of required pretrial doc-\numents.” Noting that Solis’s confinement was a “substantial\nbarrier to his attendance at trial,” the district court announced\nthat it would conduct the trial as a “Court Trial by videotape\ndepositions.” Solis subsequently filed a second request for\nappointment of counsel, explaining that his education was\nlimited to an eighth-grade level, that he had no legal educa-\ntion and limited access to legal materials, and that the case\ninvolved complex legal issues that required discovery of doc-\numents and depositions of a number of witnesses. He also\nreiterated his demand for a jury trial. The district court denied\nthe request for counsel without explanation.\n\n   Having reviewed the videotaped depositions and corre-\nsponding transcripts of Solis, Beltran, and Gutierrez, the dis-\ntrict court issued its “Statement of Decision” on July 14,\n2005. Finding that there was “no question that an event\noccurred which changed [Solis’s] cell assignment and directly\n\f1442           COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nled to [Solis’s] injuries,” the district court criticized Beltran\nfor being “less than forthcoming with regard to the presenta-\ntion of evidence” that should have been in his immediate con-\ntrol. The district court also concluded that Solis’s “version as\nto many of the events seems more credible than that of Defen-\ndant’s witnesses.” Nevertheless, the district court ruled in Bel-\ntran’s favor on the ground that Solis was “unable to provide\nsufficient evidence to sustain a finding of liability.” There was\nno separate order setting forth the judgment apart from the\nStatement of Decision. The district court ordered Solis to pay\na bill of costs in the amount of $1,115 for trial and deposition\nfees.\n\n   Solis filed a Notice of Appeal on October 18, 2005. He\nargues that (1) summary judgment was improper; (2) the dis-\ntrict court deprived him of his right to a jury by adjudicating\nhis claim against Beltran via a bench trial “by videotape depo-\nsitions,” and that, in any event, the district court’s verdict in\nfavor of Beltran was wrong on the merits; and (3) the district\ncourt abused its discretion in refusing to appoint Solis coun-\nsel. We address each issue in turn.\n\nII.    Discussion\n\n                       A.   Jurisdiction\n\n   [1] As a preliminary matter, we reject the Defendants’ con-\ntention that this Court lacks jurisdiction because Solis’s notice\nof appeal was untimely. Notice of appeal must be filed within\n30 days “after the judgment . . . is entered,” subject to certain\nexceptions. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). A judgment is not\n“entered” for the purposes of Rule 4(a) unless it complies\nwith Rules 58(a) and 79(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7); Beaudry Motor Co. v.

Rule 58(a)(1)\nrequires that every judgment be set forth on a separate docu-\nment, with certain exceptions not applicable here. Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 58(a)(1). Rule 79(a) details the civil docketing procedure\n\f                 COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN                     1443\nto be followed by the district court clerk when entering the\njudgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 79(a). When judgment is not set\nforth on a separate document as required by Rule 58(a)(1), it\nis considered “entered” when 150 days have run from nota-\ntion in the civil docket. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii).\n\n   [2] The district court’s “Statement of Decision” was issued\non July 14, 2005, and entered on the docket, in accordance\nwith Rule 79(a), on July 15, 2005. The district court did not,\nhowever, set forth the judgment on a separate document as\nrequired by Rule 58(a)(1).5 Therefore, judgment was not “en-\ntered” until December 12, 2005, 150 days after the Statement\nof Decision was noted in the civil docket. As a result, Solis’s\nOctober 18, 2005, Notice of Appeal was timely, see Fed. R.\nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (“A notice of appeal filed after the court\nannounces a decision or order—but before the entry of the\njudgment or order—is treated as filed on the date of and after\nthe entry.”), and we accordingly have jurisdiction to consider\nSolis’s claims on appeal.\n\n                      B.    Summary Judgment\n\n  Solis argues that the district court’s grant of summary judg-\nment in favor of the Defendants (excluding Beltran) was inap-\npropriate because he was not given fair notice of the\nrequirements and consequences of a summary judgment\nmotion, as required by Rand v. Rowland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757675\"><a href=\"/opinion/757675/lee-a-rand-v-james-rowland-nadim-khoury-md-william-bunnell-roy-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">952</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th\nCir. 1998) (en banc).

Civ. P. 58 and 79(a) unless specifically ordered by the\njudge.” The district judge in this case did not include any language in the\nStatement of Decision indicating that he was ordering the notation of the\nStatement in the civil docket to constitute entry of judgment.

Rand, 154\nF.3d at 959. We further held that either the district court or the\nsummary judgment movant may provide the prisoner with\nnotice,6 and that “[i]f the movant provides the notice, it must\nbe in a separate form that the plaintiff will recognize as given\npursuant to the court’s requirement. It may not be provided\nwithin the summary judgment motion or in the papers ordi-\nnarily filed in support of the motion.” Id. at 960. Finally, we\noutlined the contents required for sufficient notice, holding\nthat the notice “must be phrased in ordinary, understandable\nlanguage” and that it must inform the prisoner both of his\n“right to file counter-affidavits or other responsive evidentiary\nmaterials” and, “most importantly, . . . of the effect of losing\non summary judgment.” Id.\n\n   [4] Here, neither the district court nor the Defendants pro-\nvided the notice Rand requires. The district court issued\ninstructions regarding preparation for trial in its “Order for\nJury Trial.” Under the heading “Motions for Summary Judg-\nment or Partial Summary Judgment,” the district court stated\nonly that “[m]otions for summary judgment or partial sum-\nmary judgment shall be filed as soon as practical, however, in\nno event later than the motion cut-off date.” Its order con-\ntained no instructions regarding either the requirements of\nresponding to or the consequences of losing on summary\njudgment. Specifically, the district court’s order did not alert\nSolis “to the fact that the failure to [file responsive evidentiary\nmaterials] might result in the entry of summary judgment\nagainst” him, Rand, 154 F.3d at 960, and it certainly did not\n  6\n   In doing so, we explicitly overruled Arreola v. Mangaong, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"703953\"><a href=\"/opinion/703953/rafael-arreola-v-mo-mangaong/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">801</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802 (9th Cir. 1995) (per curiam), which held that the notice must be\ngiven by the district court itself.\n\f                 COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN                     1445\n“inform [Solis] that if the motion for summary judgment is\ngranted, [his] case will be over,” id.\n\n   [5] Nor did the Defendants provide, “in a separate form” as\nrequired by Rand, any notice describing the procedural\nrequirements Solis must meet in countering the summary\njudgment motion or the consequences of failing to meet those\nrequirements, including the fact that losing on summary judg-\nment would mean the effective termination of his case.7 See\nid. at 960-61; see also id. at 962 (holding that the defendants’\ntwo-page notice of rules relating to summary judgment,\nalthough it alerted the pro se prisoner of his right to file\nresponsive materials and the consequences of failing to do so,\nwas nevertheless insufficient because it was not phrased in\nordinary language and did not inform the plaintiff of the effect\nof losing on summary judgment).\n\n   [6] Thus, because Solis was not given fair notice,\ndemanded by Rand, of the requirements and consequences of\na summary judgment motion, we reverse the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of all defendants other\nthan Beltran and remand all claims that were dismissed at that\nstage, with one exception: we agree with the district court that\nSolis’s § 1986 claim was untimely,8 and therefore we affirm\n  7\n     Not only did the Defendants fail to inform Solis of the proper proce-\ndures for responding to a summary judgment motion, they sought to take\nadvantage of Solis’s lack of understanding regarding those procedural\nrequirements. Defendants’ “Objections to Plaintiff’s Opposition to Sum-\nmary Judgment” focused almost exclusively on Solis’s failure to meet the\nprocedural and evidentiary requirements of countering a summary judg-\nment motion—it complained that Solis’s opposition was filed nine days\nlate, did not contain a separate statement of undisputed facts, and was sup-\nported only by hearsay or documents that had not been properly disclosed.\n   8\n     Section 1986 provides that “no action under the provisions of this sec-\ntion shall be sustained which is not commenced within one year after the\ncause of action has accrued.” 42 U.S.C. § 1986. Solis filed his federal\ncomplaint in February 2002, nearly three years after his alleged injuries\ntook place.\n\f1446            COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nthe grant of summary judgment as to that claim. Otherwise,\nwe decline to conduct harmless error analysis, as “harmless\nerror review is inappropriate in most cases” of Rand violation,\nid. at 961, and this is not the “unusual case where the harm-\nlessness of the failure to give the required notice may be\nestablished on the record or by judicial notice,” id. See also\nid. at 960-61 (holding that harmlessness analysis may be\nappropriate where the record clearly shows that the plaintiff\nhad received Rand notice in prior litigation or that he “has a\ncomplete understanding of Rule 56’s requirements gained\nfrom some other source”).9\n\n                            C.   Jury Trial\n\n   Solis also argues that the district court erred in holding a\nbench trial “by videotape depositions” instead of a jury trial\nto adjudicate his claims against Beltran, and that such error\nwarrants reversal of its verdict in favor of that defendant.\nWhether a party is entitled to a jury trial is a question of law\nwe review de novo.

BELTRAN\n   The district court stated two reasons for its decision to con-\nduct a bench trial rather than a jury trial with respect to Solis’s\nclaim against Beltran. First, the district court found that Solis\n“did not file a jury demand.” Second, the district court stated\nthat Solis had waived his right to a trial by jury “due to the\nnon-submission of required pretrial documents.” We hold that\nboth of the district court’s reasons for denying Solis a jury\ntrial were faulty: Solis clearly demanded a jury trial and never\nwithdrew that demand, and the district court’s imposition of\na penalty of forfeiture of that right for failing to comply with\na procedural pre-trial requirement was invalid. Because the\ndistrict court’s denial of a jury trial was not harmless error, we\nreverse the district court’s verdict against Solis and remand\nfor a new trial, this time by jury.\n\n  1.    Solis demanded a trial by jury.\n\n   [8] The district court’s finding that Solis “did not file a jury\ndemand” was plainly in error. Solis included the words “DE-\nMAND FOR JURY TRIAL” in the caption of his complaint\nas well as on the last page, which also contained the unambig-\nuous statement, “Plaintiff hereby requests a trial by jury.”\nThus, it is clear that Solis complied with both the spirit and\nthe letter of Federal Rule 38(b), as well as Local Rule 38-1,\nby unequivocally demanding a jury trial in both the caption\nand at the end of his pleading.\n\n   [9] Moreover, there can be no question that both the district\ncourt and the Defendants were aware of Solis’s demand for a\njury trial: the district court entered an “Order for Jury Trial,”\n\n38(d) now states that a “proper demand may be withdrawn only if the par-\nties consent”; and Rule 39(a)(1) now states that, once a demand is made,\nthe trial “must be by jury unless . . . the parties or their attorneys file a\nstipulation to a nonjury trial or so stipulate on the record.” These changes\nto the rules’ wording were “intended to be stylistic only,” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n38 & 39 advisory committee notes, and have no effect on the substance\nof our decision.\n\f               COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN              1449\nthe case was docketed for jury trial, and the Defendants filed\nproposed jury instructions with the court. Indeed, the Defen-\ndants do not dispute on appeal that they were aware of Solis’s\nrequest. Therefore, because Solis’s jury demand was “suffi-\nciently clear to alert” both the Defendants and the district\ncourt “that a jury trial [wa]s requested,” Lutz v. Glendale\nUnion High Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789866\"><a href=\"/opinion/789866/claudette-lutz-v-glendale-union-high-school-district-no-205-governing/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1061</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1064 (9th Cir. 2005), the\ndistrict court’s finding that Solis “did not file a jury demand”\nwas clearly erroneous.\n\n  2.   Solis did not waive his right to a jury trial.\n\n   The district court also found, as a separate ground for deny-\ning Solis a jury trial, that Solis had waived his right to a trial\nby jury “due to the non-submission of required pretrial\ndocuments”—specifically, Solis’s failure to file proposed jury\ninstructions and special verdict forms, despite the district\ncourt’s warning in its Order for Jury Trial that failure to do\nso would “CONSTITUTE A WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL in\nall civil cases.”\n\n   [10] When a party properly files a jury demand under the\nrequirements of Rule 38(b), he has satisfied all that is required\nby the Rules to avoid waiver, and his jury demand “may not\nbe withdrawn without the consent of the parties.” Fed. R. Civ.\nP. 38(d); see also Pradier, 641 F.2d at 810. The district\njudge’s waiver provision required Solis to satisfy additional\nprocedural requirements beyond filing a jury demand—\nnamely, the filing of jury instructions and special verdict\nforms—or to forfeit his jury trial right. This rule was clearly\ninconsistent with Rule 38(d)’s limitation of waiver to the fail-\nure to file a jury demand and consequently cannot be\nenforced. See Pradier, 641 F.2d at 810 (“[I]f Local Rule 22\nis inconsistent with Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(b), it cannot be\nenforced.”); Rutledge v. Elec.

BELTRAN\n   [11] “The demand for a jury trial having been properly\nmade under Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(b), the failure to fulfill an addi-\ntional requirement of a local rule . . . cannot constitute a\nwaiver of a trial by jury.” Pradier, 641 F.2d at 811. Solis\nproperly demanded a jury trial pursuant to the requirements of\nRule 38(b). The district court’s determination that his failure\nto file proposed jury instructions and special verdict forms\nconstituted a waiver of his right to a trial by jury was there-\nfore erroneous.\n\n  3.   Solis did not consent to the withdrawal of his jury\n       demand.\n\n   The Defendants argue, nevertheless, that by “participat[ing]\nin the [bench trial], inform[ing] the court of the witnesses he\nintended to call, and . . . not contest[ing] or object[ing] to the\ncourt’s finding of a waiver of jury trial,” Solis effectively con-\nsented to the bench trial. We find this argument without merit.\n\n   Rule 38(d) states unequivocally that a “demand for trial by\njury . . . may not be withdrawn without the consent of the par-\nties,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 38(d) (emphasis added), and Rule 39(a)\nspecifies that such consent must be made by written or oral\nstipulation. There is no dispute that Solis did not stipulate,\neither orally or in writing, to consent to a bench trial. Thus,\nit is clear that, under Federal Rules 38 and 39, Solis never\nwithdrew his jury trial demand.\n\n   [12] Nevertheless, this court has held that “knowing partici-\npation in a bench trial without objection is sufficient to consti-\ntute a jury waiver,” the literal requirements of Rule 39(a)\nnotwithstanding. White v. McGinnis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"541810\"><a href=\"/opinion/541810/edward-allen-white-v-wayne-mcginnis/\"><span class=\"volume\">903</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 703 (9th\nCir. 1990) (en banc). We have made clear, however, that this\nnarrow exception to the formal requirements of Rules 38 and\n39 applies only when the party claiming the jury trial right is\nattempting to act strategically—participating in the bench trial\nin the hopes of achieving a favorable outcome, then asserting\nlack of consent to the bench trial when the result turns out to\n\f               COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN               1451\nbe unfavorable to him. See Fuller v. City of Oakland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689912\"><a href=\"/opinion/689912/patricia-fuller-v-city-of-oakland-california-george-hart-antonio-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1522</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1531 (9th Cir. 1995) (stating that a primary rationale\nbehind White is the principle that “a party ought not to have\ntwo bites at the procedural apple”). In White, for example,\nalthough the district court set the case for a bench trial despite\nthe appellant’s timely jury trial demand, the appellant “never\nbrought his prior jury demand to the district court’s attention\nduring the five and one-half month period between the bench\ntrial notice and the trial,” “sat through the entire bench trial\nand never once objected to the absence of a jury while his\ncounsel vigorously argued his case to the judge,” and did not\n“notify the court of its mistake before it entered judgment\nagainst him.” White, 903 F.2d at 700. We held that the appel-\nlant’s “vigorous participation in [the] bench trial, without so\nmuch as a mention of a jury” constituted a “knowledgeable\nrelinquishment of the prior jury demand.” Id. at 703. In avoid-\ning an overly rigid application of Rule 39, we emphasized the\nequities involved, stressing that because the appellant “chose\nto argue his case fully before the district judge,” it was “not\nunjust to hold him to that commitment.” Id.\n\n   [13] Not every participation in a bench trial constitutes con-\nsent to the waiver of a jury trial, however. When a party par-\nticipates in the bench trial ordered by the trial court while\ncontinuing to demand a jury trial, his “continuing objection”\nis “sufficient to preserve his right to appeal the denial of his\nrequest for a jury.” United States v. Nordbrock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566429\"><a href=\"/opinion/566429/united-states-v-neil-t-nordbrock/\"><span class=\"volume\">941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">947</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n950 (9th Cir. 1991); see also California Mobile Home, 107\nF.3d at 1380 (noting that “no Court has expanded [White] to\nfind a waiver of a right to a jury trial where a plaintiff actively\ncontests the district court’s decision to refuse the demand”);\nWhite, 903 F.2d at 703 (holding that “knowing participation\nin a bench trial without objection” constitutes a jury waiver)\n(emphasis added). This is because the party in such a case is\nnot seeking “two bites at the procedural apple” like the appel-\nlant in White. Fuller, 47 F.3d at 1531. Rather, when a trial\ncourt denies a party a jury trial despite the party’s continuing\ndemand, the party has little choice but to accede to the trial\n\f1452             COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\ncourt’s ruling and participate in the bench trial. See Nord-\nbrock, 941 F.2d at 950 (“His assent to the [bench trial] was\nreasonable in light of the court’s earlier ruling that implicitly\ndenied the demand for a jury trial.”). Reluctant participation\nin a bench trial does not waive one’s Seventh Amendment\nright to a jury trial under White’s narrow exception to Rule\n39(a).\n\n   [14] In this case, it is clear that Solis was not seeking “two\nbites at the procedural apple” by “participating” in the “Court\nTrial by videotape depositions.” Once the district court found,\nerroneously, that Solis had waived his right to a jury trial,\nSolis had little option but to make his objection known and go\nforward with the bench trial as best he could. That he did so\ndoes not constitute “knowledgeable relinquishment of the\nprior jury demand.” White, 903 F.2d at 703. Like the appellant\nin Nordbrock, Solis did bring his prior jury demand to the dis-\ntrict court’s attention during the “period between the bench\ntrial notice and the trial.” White, 903 F.2d at 700. He noted\nthat demand in his second motion for counsel, filed after the\ndistrict court found that he had waived his jury right.12 Fur-\nthermore, in contrast to the appellant in White, Solis’s “partic-\nipation” in the bench trial was far from “vigorous,” see id. at\n703—the “trial” consisted solely of the court’s review of vid-\neotaped deposition testimony, during which the parties were\nnot even present. Therefore, indulging “every reasonable pre-\nsumption against the waiver of the jury trial,” Nordbrock, 941\nF.2d at 950 (citing Pradier, 641 F.2d at 811), as we are bound\nto do, we hold that Solis did not, by participating in the dis-\n  12\n     Although Solis included his statement that he had “demanded a jury\ntrial” in his motion for counsel, rather than in a separate filing, we con-\nstrue it as a “continuing demand” under Nordbrock pursuant to our “policy\nof liberal construction in favor of pro se litigants,” Rand, 154 F.3d at 957;\nsee also Abassi v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779344\"><a href=\"/opinion/779344/taufiq-moh-abassi-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1032 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[W]e have\nconsistently held that procedural requirements should be more liberally\nconstrued for pro se litigants.”). Moreover, it appears that at that time\nSolis believed that he was still entitled to and would receive a trial by jury.\n\f              COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN              1453\ntrict court’s bench trial by videotape depositions, consent to\nthe withdrawal of his prior jury demand.\n\n  4.   The district court’s erroneous denial of a jury trial was\n       not harmless.\n\n   [15] Having concluded that the district court erred in deny-\ning Solis a jury trial, we must determine whether that error\nwas harmless. See Fuller, 47 F.3d at 1533. “The denial will\nbe harmless only if ‘no reasonable jury could have found for\nthe losing party, and the trial court could have granted a\ndirected verdict for the prevailing party.’ ” Id. (quoting Davis\n& Cox v. Summa Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"446532\"><a href=\"/opinion/446532/davis-cox-a-partnership-plaintiff-appelleecross-appellant-v-summa/\"><span class=\"volume\">751</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1507</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1517 (9th Cir. 1985)).\n\n   We hold that the district court’s denial of Solis’s jury trial\nright was not harmless. Solis needed to prove the constitu-\ntional violation he asserted—namely, that Beltran acted with\ndeliberate indifference in failing to protect him from attacks\nby other inmates, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, see\nHearns v. Terhune, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790904\"><a href=\"/opinion/790904/clarence-leonard-hearns-jr-v-cal-terhune-robert-powell-correctional/\"><span class=\"volume\">413</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1040 (9th Cir. 2005)—by\nonly a preponderance of the evidence. See Tatum v. City &\nCounty of San Francisco, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793740\"><a href=\"/opinion/793740/verlie-tatum-and-verlie-tatum-as-successor-in-interest-of-glenn-fullard/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1090</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1094 (9th Cir.\n2006). Deliberate indifference occurs when “the official acted\nor failed to act despite his knowledge of a substantial risk of\nserious harm.” Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 841 (1990).\nSolis testified that he twice told Beltran that he was a gang\ndrop-out and that he presented documentary evidence to Bel-\ntran establishing his status as an ex-Eme member, thereby\nputting Beltran—who himself testified that he had authority\nto change Solis’s housing assignment—on notice that a trans-\nfer to the gang module could foreseeably result in Solis being\nattacked. Solis also testified that one of the inmates who\nassaulted him implicated Beltran directly in Solis’s transfer to\nthe gang unit, stating that “Beltran was the one that gave\n[him] up.” Beltran, in turn, offered no explanation for Solis’s\ntransfer; his defense amounted to little more than a bald denial\nof any knowledge of or interaction with Solis. The district\ncourt itself found Beltran’s presentation of evidence “less than\n\f1454             COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nforthcoming,” and determined that Solis’s “version as to\nmany of the events seem[ed] more credible than that of [Bel-\ntran’s] witnesses.”\n\n   [16] Given the relative credibility of the witnesses, a rea-\nsonable jury could have found that Solis, through his docu-\nments establishing his ex-gang member status as well as\nthrough his testimony that Beltran was aware of that status,\nproved by a preponderance of the evidence that Beltran acted\nwith deliberate indifference in transferring him to the gang\nmodule. Compare Frost, 152 F.3d at 1131. Therefore, the dis-\ntrict court’s erroneous denial of a jury trial was not harmless\nand, consequently, we remand for retrial of Solis’s case\nbefore a jury.13\n\n            D.    Request for appointment of counsel\n\n   Finally, Solis argues that the district court abused its discre-\ntion in denying his request for the appointment of counsel.\nTitle 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1) permits the district court, in its\ndiscretion, to “request an attorney to represent any person\nunable to afford counsel.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(1); see also\nAgyeman v. Corr. Corp. of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788531\"><a href=\"/opinion/788531/emmanuel-senyo-agyeman-v-corrections-corporation-of-america-zurich/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1103 (9th Cir.\n2004), cert. denied sub nom.

In this case, Solis twice requested the appoint-\nment of counsel. The district court rejected Solis’s first\nrequest on the ground that no proof of service was attached.\nIn denying Solis’s second request, the district court stated\nonly that “[t]he Court has reviewed the motion for appoint-\n  13\n    Solis requests that we reverse the district court’s finding in favor of\nBeltran and direct a verdict for him. Although we believe that a reasonable\njury could have found for Solis on the evidence presented, we do not\nbelieve that his evidence was so strong that no reasonable jury could have\nfound for Beltran, see Ritchie v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794703\"><a href=\"/opinion/794703/wayne-ritchie-v-united-states-of-america-robert-v-lashbrook-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1019</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1023 (9th\nCir. 2006) (“[J]udgment as a matter of law is appropriate only if no rea-\nsonable jury could find in favor of the non-moving party.”), and therefore\nwe decline to direct a verdict in Solis’s favor.\n\f               COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN               1455\nment of counsel, filed by plaintiff on April 28, 2005. The\nmotion is denied.”\n\n   [17] We note that a jury trial will occur in this case, and\nthat Solis is incarcerated in a penal institution and is without\nlegal training. In fact, his education ended at the eighth grade\nlevel. He is ill-suited to conduct a trial. We also note that\nthere may well be merit to his claims. However, because the\ndistrict court failed to articulate its reasons for denying Solis’s\nrequest, we cannot determine on appellate review whether its\ndenial constituted an abuse of discretion. See United Nat’l Ins.\nCo. v. R & D Latex Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"753062\"><a href=\"/opinion/753062/98-cal-daily-op-serv-2502-98-daily-journal-dar-3457-united-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 919 (9th Cir. 1998)\n(“[M]eaningful appellate review for abuse of discretion is\nforeclosed when the district court fails to articulate its reason-\ning.”); United States v. 30.64 Acres of Land, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"473089\"><a href=\"/opinion/473089/united-states-v-3064-acres-of-land-more-or-less-situated-in-klickitat/\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n804 (9th Cir. 1986) (holding that the district court “does not\ndischarge [its] duty [under § 1915(e)(1)] if it makes no\nattempt to request the assistance of volunteer counsel or,\nwhere the record is not otherwise clear, explain its failure to\ndo so”). Accordingly, we reverse the district court’s order\ndenying Solis’s motion to appoint counsel and instruct the\ndistrict court on remand to reconsider his request. If the dis-\ntrict court should, after considering all the relevant factors,\nincluding those mentioned above, decide once again to deny\nSolis’s motion for appointment of counsel, it must provide an\nadequate explanation of its reasons such that its decision may\nbe reviewed by us on appeal.\n\nIII.   Conclusion\n\n   Because Solis was not provided notice of the requirements\nand consequences of summary judgement, as required by\nRand, we reverse the district court’s grant of summary judg-\nment in favor of the defendants other than Beltran and remand\nall dismissed claims involving them (except for Solis’s\nuntimely § 1986 claim). We also reverse the district court’s\nverdict in favor of Beltran and remand for a new trial before\na jury. The district court erred in denying Solis a jury trial: he\n\f1456           COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES v. BELTRAN\nproperly demanded such a trial; his failure to submit specified\npretrial documents cannot constitute a waiver of the jury\nright; and his “participation” in the bench trial did not amount\nto consent to a waiver of his prior jury demand. The failure\nto afford Solis a jury trial was not harmless error, as a reason-\nable jury could have found that Beltran violated Solis’s con-\nstitutional rights. Finally, we reverse the district court’s denial\nof Solis’s request for appointment of counsel and remand on\nthat issue as well. Because our reversal means that Beltran is\nno longer the “prevailing party,” we vacate the bill of costs\nordered against Solis. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d).\n\n  The case is REVERSED and REMANDED, and the bill of\ncosts is VACATED.\n\f</pre>",
