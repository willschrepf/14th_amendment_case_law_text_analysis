Starbranch, in\n                            connection with a property owners’ association that\n                            was allegedly invalidly formed. CR6-25.\n\nTrial Court:                The Honorable Jeff Shadwick, 55th District Court,\n                            Harris County, Texas, cause number 2013-14192.\n\nTrial Court Proceedings:    In 2013, Crowell settled with all of the defendants,\n                            except for Starbranch. CR866-908 (App. 4). In 2015,\n                            Crowell filed her Motion for Summary Judgment on\n                            Attorneys’ Fees against Starbranch. CR366-674.\n                            Subsequently, Starbranch filed a motion to dismiss\n                            Crowell’s action for declaratory judgment arguing the\n                            claim was moot. 1st Supp. CR7-122.\n\nTrial Court’s Disposition: The trial court did not find Starbranch liable to\n                           Crowell or declare the respective rights and interests of\n                           Crowell and Starbranch. However, the trial court did\n                           grant Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\n                           Attorneys’ Fees, in part, awarding attorneys’ fees in\n                           the amount of $26,462.00 against Starbranch. CR917.\n                           The order became final and appealable on April 28,\n                           2015, when the trial court entered a final judgment\n                           denying Starbranch’s motion for reconsideration and\n                           motion to dismiss. CR1059-60.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xi\n\f                                 ISSUE PRESENTED\n\n      Did the trial court err by granting Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\non Attorneys’ Fees?\n\n   A. Did the trial court err by awarding attorneys’ fees when Crowell’s claim for\n\n      declaratory relief merely duplicated the issues set forth in her action to quiet\n\n      title?\n\n   B. Did the trial court err by deciding a fact question on reasonable and\n\n      necessary attorneys’ fees that was reserved for the jury?\n\n   C. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by awarding fees that were neither\n\n      equitable nor just?\n\n   D. Did the trial court err by granting any relief to Crowell because there were\n\n      fact issues as to the amount of reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees?\n\n   E. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by considering evidence filed after the\n\n      submission date and which Starbranch did not have the opportunity to\n\n      controvert?\n\n   F. Did the trial court err by granting more relief than was requested in\n\n      Crowell’s motion?\n\n\n\n\n                                         xii\n\f                            STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\n   A. Overview\n\n      This appeal arises from Appellee Elizabeth Howard Crowell’s suit to quite\n\ntitle and declaratory judgment action seeking the same relief. CR19-21. Crowell\n\nsued a property owners’ association, its officers and directors, and all of the\n\nassociation members, claiming the association was not properly formed. CR6-25.\n\n      Among the defendants was Appellant Eileen K. Starbranch, who was not an\n\nofficer or director but instead a mere member of the association.           CR6-25.\n\nStarbranch has never been found liable for anything, and the trial court made no\n\ndeclarations concerning the respective rights and interests of Crowell and\n\nStarbranch. CR1040 (App. 2); CR1059-60 (App. 1). Crowell’s suit to quiet title,\n\nand her duplicative declaratory judgment action, were dismissed without any\n\nfinding of liability or declaration against Starbranch. CR1040 (App. 2); CR1059-\n\n60 (App. 1).\n\n      Yet the trial court, on summary judgment, ordered Starbranch to pay\n\nCrowell $26,462.00 in attorneys’ fees. CR917 (App. 3). That order underlies\n\nStarbranch’s appeal, and the facts germane to this appeal are as follows:\n\n   B. The parties and their relationships\n\n      In March 2009, Crowell acquired over 25,000 square feet of property in the\n\nJandor Gardens subdivision with the following address: 5326 Institute Lane,\n\n\n                                         1\n\fHouston, Texas 77005 (hereinafter, the “Property”). CR75; 92. Crowell and all\n\nof the defendants, including Starbranch, are homeowners in the Jandor Gardens\n\nsubdivision. CR7-9.\n\n      In 2012, several of the homeowners in Jandor Gardens formed a property\n\nowners’ association for Jandor Gardens. CR99-124. The name of the property\n\nowners’ association was the “Jandor Gardens Association, Inc.,” a Texas nonprofit\n\ncorporation (hereinafter, the “Association”). CR100.\n\n      To form a property owners’ association, a petition committee must be\n\nformed first. Tex. Prop. Code § 204.006(a). Defendants Anna Stock, Fred Sharifi,\n\nand Wyman H. Herendeen served on the petition committee for the Association.\n\nCR154-157.     Defendant Ron Whitte incorporated the Association. CR217-21.\n\nDefendants Rick Rambo, Ron Witte, and Wyman H. Herendeen served as the\n\ninitial directors for the Association. CR101; 191; 218-219.\n\n      Starbranch did not serve as either an officer or a director for the Association.\n\nCR217-21. In addition, Starbranch did not serve on the petition committee for the\n\nAssociation.   CR154-157.     Instead, Starbranch was simply a member of the\n\nAssociation. CR755-58; 181; 211; 260; 302.\n\n      Starbranch has never asserted any interest in Crowell’s Property. CR758. In\n\nfact, Starbranch has disclaimed any and all interest in Crowell’s Property. CR758.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f      C. Neighbors ask Starbranch to execute signature pages for the\n         Association.\n\n         It was not Starbranch’s idea to form the Association. CR755-58. On or\n\nabout November 8, 2012, Starbranch was in her vehicle exiting her garage onto\n\nDora Street, one of the streets in Jandor Gardens. CR756. While doing so, about\n\nfour or five people claiming to be homeowners in Jandor Gardens stopped her and\n\nstated that they were forming the Association. CR756. They asked Starbranch to\n\nexecute one of more signature pages in connection with the Association. CR756.\n\nStarbranch executed the signature pages presented to her. CR181; 211; 260; 302.\n\n         On or about November 18, 2012, Starbranch noticed that one or more\n\nsignature pages in connection with the Association were left on her front doorstep.\n\nCR756. Starbranch picked up the document, signed where necessary, and then left\n\nthe document on her front doorstep. CR756.\n\n         Starbranch did not sign two of the instruments that Crowell sought to declare\n\nas void in the trial court. Starbranch did not sign the “Notice of Formation of\n\nPetition Committee”1 or the “Petition Pursuant to Property Code § 204.006 To\n\nCreate The Jandor Gardens Association, Inc.,” 2 which were the subjects of the first\n\nand fourth declarations sought by Crowell in her later suit to quiet title and\n\nduplicative declaratory judgment action. CR20.\n\n\n1\n    CR154-57.\n2\n    CR100-04.\n\n\n                                           3\n\f      Starbranch never proposed or circulated the instruments that created the\n\nAssociation. CR756. In addition, Starbranch did not file any instruments in the\n\nHarris County real property records in connection with the Association. CR756.\n\nIn short, Starbranch did nothing more than give her okay to the Association idea\n\nproposed by others. CR755-58.\n\n   D. Crowell files suit.\n\n      In her Original Petition, Crowell asserted an action to quiet title against all\n\nof the defendants, including Starbranch, wherein she alleged as follows:\n\n      the documents filed by Defendants [including Starbranch] in the real\n      property records (see Harris County Clerk File Nos. 20120521806,\n      20120521807, 20120521808, 201205436661, and 2012054016216)\n      are clouds or encumbrances on Ms. Crowell’s right of ownership of\n      the Property, which affect impair Ms. Crowell's title to the Property.\n      Ms. Crowell seeks to nullify the effect of these disputed filings and\n      encumbrances. Ms. Crowell is entitled to a judgment that sets aside\n      these improper filings and removes them as clouds on her title.\n\n      CR21.\n\nCrowell sought the same the relief in her claim for declaratory relief against all of\n\nthe defendants, including Starbranch. CR19-20. On April 7, 2013, a jury trial was\n\nrequested and the jury fee was paid. CR56-58; 1093.\n\n      The following defendants did nothing more that than approve instruments\n\nprepared by the Association: Eileen K. Starbranch, George L. Parker, Eva K.\n\nParker, Garret S. Madderra, Georgia W. Hitchcock, James Carper, and Eric\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fMazziotta. CR106-114; 167-185; 197-215; 246-264; 275-283; 293-302. Crowell\n\nlater dismissed each of these defendants, except for Starbranch, from the lawsuit.\n\nCR26-46; 59-61; 65-68; 72-74.\n\n      The Association was never Starbranch’s idea, and she did not oppose the\n\nrelief that Crowell sought in her action to quiet title and in her declaratory\n\njudgment action (although Starbranch did contest her liability). CR724-810. In\n\nfact, upon learning that Crowell wanted Starbranch to execute a Rescission of Real\n\nProperty Filings in connection with the Association, Starbranch voluntarily\n\nexecuted the same and filed it in the real property records. CR755-767.\n\n   E. Termination of the Association in 2013.\n\n      On June 24, 2013, Crowell filed her Motion for Summary Judgment as to\n\nLiability against several of the defendants in this lawsuit. CR75-344. In her\n\nsummary judgment motion, Crowell sought partial summary judgment on her\n\naction for declaratory judgment and her action to quiet title. CR75-344; 368.\n\n      On August 19, 2013, this Court granted Crowell’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment as to Liability against several of the defendants in the lawsuit. CR345-\n\n346. However, because Starbranch had not made an appearance in this lawsuit\n\nwhen the Motion for Summary Judgment as to Liability was filed and granted, the\n\norder granting partial summary judgment was not entered against Starbranch.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fCR722-23. Starbranch has never been found liable for anything. CR1059-60\n\n(App. 1).\n\n      On October 15, 2013, Crowell entered into a settlement agreement with the\n\nAssociation, Sarah Whiting, Ron Witte, Lawrence E. Plotsky, Rick Rambo,\n\nFrances Rambo, David D. Stock, Anna L. Stock, Wyman H. Herendeen, Mary\n\nHerendeen, Fereidoon Sharifi, Soody Sharifi, Edward G. Rizk, Billie Rizk,\n\nBenjamin Levit, Erica Levit, Walter J. Taylor, and Anita J. Taylor (the “Settling\n\nDefendants”) wherein the Settling Defendants agreed to “terminate the\n\n[Association] by filing a Certificate of Termination of a Domestic Nonprofit\n\nCorporation or Cooperative Association with the Secretary of State.” CR866-908\n\n(App. 4). On November 20, 2013, the Settling Defendants filed the Certificate of\n\nTermination as to Jandor Gardens Association, Inc. with the Texas Secretary of\n\nState. 1st Supp. CR120-22 (App. 5). In the settlement agreement, Crowell and the\n\nSettling Defendants also agreed as follows:\n\n      4. Filing of Order.\n\n      The Parties acknowledge and agree that Crowell will file a certified\n      copy of the Order signed October 8, 2013, which is attached as\n      Exhibit C, in the real property records. The Parties acknowledge and\n      agree that they have waived any right to appeal the Order.\n\n      5. Applicable Deed Restrictions.\n\n      All Parties hereto acknowledge that the 1929 deed restrictions of\n      Jandor Gardens, recorded in Volume 811, Pages 285-286 of the Deed\n\n\n                                         6\n\f       Records of Harris County, Texas, remain in effect, and all Parties\n       hereto agree to comply with the deed restrictions.\n\n       CR868 (App. 4).\n\nOn December 5, 2013, Crowell filed the trial court’s order, dated October 8, 2013,\n\nin the real property records for Harris County. CR790-94. Filing the trial court’s\n\nOctober 8, 2013, order in the real property records removed the cloud of title on\n\nthe Property that had been created by the Association. CR368.3\n\n    F. The trial court grants Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\n       Attorneys’ Fees against Starbranch.\n\n       On February 25, 2015, Crowell filed her Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nAttorney’s Fees against Starbranch seeking $71,345.80 in attorneys’ fees, incurred\n\nby Crowell between February 28, 2013, and October 1, 2014. CR366-674. In that\n\nmotion, Crowell claimed that she had obtained an August 19, 2013, summary\n\njudgment order on her action to quiet title and her claim for declaratory relief\n\nagainst Starbranch. CR368.4 Starbranch filed a motion for reconsideration of the\n\nsummary judgment order, 5 arguing that the order could not have been against\n\nStarbranch because “[w]hen Crowell filed and served her Motion for Summary\n\n3\n  In her Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees, Crowell admitted the following: in\n2013, the trial court “granted Ms. Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability, thereby\nnullifying the actions of defendants’ bogus POA . . . .” CR368.\n4\n  In her Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees, Crowell made the following claim:\n“On August 19, 2013, [the trial court] granted Ms. Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\nLiability, thereby nullifying the actions of defendants’ bogus POA, and establishing the liability\nof the defendants in this case with respect to certain causes of action including Ms. Crowell’s\naction for declaratory judgment.” CR368.\n5\n  CR675-708.\n\n\n                                                7\n\fJudgment on Liability, this Court did not even have jurisdiction over Starbranch.”\n\nCR677.\n\n      On March 10, 2015, the trial court entered an order ruling as follows:\n\n      ORDERED that the August 19, 2013 Order Granting Motion for\n      Summary Judgment did not apply to Starbranch since Starbranch was\n      not a party at that time. The Motion for Reconsideration is MOOT.\n\n      ORDERED that the Court will consider Plaintiff’s Motion for\n      Summary Judgment as to Liability (filed 6-24-13) and its application\n      to Starbranch by submission on March 30, 2015, along with Plaintiff’s\n      Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees.\n\n      CR722-23.\n\n      Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment as to Liability, filed on June 14,\n\n2013, sought the following five declarations concerning the respective rights and\n\ninterests of Crowell and Starbranch:\n\n      1) the “Notice of Formation of Petition Committee” filed November\n         8, 2012 (Harris Co, Clerk File No. 20120521806) has no force and\n         effect, is nullified, and is no longer a cloud on the title to, and right\n         of ownership of, the Property;\n\n      2) the “Petition Approval” filed November 8, 2012 (Harris County\n         Clerk File No. 20120521807) has no force and effect, is nullified,\n         and is no longer a cloud on the title to, and right of ownership of,\n         the Property;\n\n      3) the “Petition and First Amendment to Declaration for Jandor\n         Gardens” filed November 8, 2012 (Harris County Clerk File No.\n         20120521808) has no force and effect, is nullified, and is no longer\n         a cloud on the title to, and right of ownership of, the Property;\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      4) the “Petition Pursuant to Property Code § 204.006 To Create The\n         Jandor Gardens Association, Inc.” filed November 19, 2012\n         (Harris County Clerk File No. 201205436661) has no force and\n         effect, is nullified, and is no longer a cloud on the title to, and right\n         of ownership of, the Property; and\n\n      5) the “First Amendment to Declaration for Jandor Gardens” filed\n         November 20, 2012 (Harris County Clerk File No. 20120540162)\n         has no force and effect, is nullified, and is no longer a cloud on the\n         title to, and right or ownership of, the Property.\n\n         CR88-89.\n\nIn other words, Crowell sought declarations to nullify the same five documents that\n\nshe sought to nullify in her action to quiet title against Starbranch. Compare CR21\n\nwith CR88-89.\n\n      On March 23, 2015, Starbranch filed her Response to Crowell’s Motion for\n\nSummary Judgment as to Liability and Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\non Attorneys’ Fees. CR724-810. Starbranch filed the Affidavit of Nelson S.\n\nEbaugh and the Affidavit of Eileen K. Starbranch, M.D. in response to the\n\nattorneys’ fee affidavit submitted by Crowell. CR755-83.          Mr. Ebaugh testified\n\nthat “it is unreasonable to assess $71,354.80 against Starbranch when Crowell’s\n\nattorneys have spent so little time prosecuting Crowell’s declaratory judgment\n\naction against Starbranch.” CR771. In addition, Starbranch objected to Crowell’s\n\nfailure to segregate nonrecoverable fees from recoverable fees and Crowell’s\n\nfailure to segregate the fees owed by different parties. CR747-50.\n\n\n\n\n                                           9\n\f       On April 1, 2015, two days after the submission date for Crowell’s summary\n\njudgment motions, Crowell filed a “Motion to Consider the Supplement to the\n\nAffidavit of John B. Shely Filed in Connection with the Pending Motions on\n\nSummary Judgment as to Attorneys’ Fees” (hereinafter, the “Motion to Consider\n\nthe Supplemental Affidavit”) that raised new and independent summary-judgment\n\ngrounds. CR834-63; 1st Supp. CR3-6. The Supplement to the Affidavit of John B.\n\nShely identified $19,345.506 in attorneys’ fees that Crowell had not requested in\n\nher Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees. Compare CR366-480 with\n\nCR836-63 and 1st Supp. CR3-6. Shely claimed that Crowell incurred $19,345.50\n\nin attorneys’ fees between November 3, 2014, and March 28, 2015. CR836-63; 1st\n\nSupp. CR3-6.\n\n       In her Motion to Consider the Supplemental Affidavit, Crowell stated that\n\nshe decided to submit the Supplement to the Affidavit of John B. Shely to the trial\n\ncourt because:\n\n       [It] describes additional fees incurred by Ms. Crowell in connection\n       with the pending motions on summary judgment as to attorneys’ fees\n       and for work performed on other litigation activities related solely to\n       Defendant Dr. Eileen K. Starbranch since November 1, 2014. These\n       fees are not included in the pending filings.\n\n       Consideration of the Supplement will allow the Court to\n       simultaneously evaluate the most recent attorneys’ fees incurred by\n\n\n6\n Calculated from the addition of the following amounts: $6,110.50 (November-December 2014),\n$5,848.00 (January-February 2015), and $7,387.00 (March 2015).\n\n\n                                            10\n\f      Ms. Crowell along with those previously submitted and will promote\n      judicial efficiency in resolving matters currently before the Court.\n\n      CR834-35.\n\nCrowell did not serve a notice identifying when the Motion to Consider the\n\nSupplemental Affidavit would be set for hearing or for submission.\n\n      On April 6, 2015, the trial court entered an interlocutory summary judgment\n\norder that neither granted nor denied Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment as\n\nto Liability against Starbranch.    CR917 (App. 3).     Instead of declaring the\n\nrespective rights and interests of Crowell and Starbranch, the summary judgment\n\norder simply provided as follows:\n\n      Plaintiff Elizabeth Howard Crowell is awarded judgment for\n      attorneys’ fees in the amount of 26,462.00 [sic], from Defendant\n      Eileen K. Starbranch. This amount reflects the unrebutted $19,245.50\n      set out in John Shely’s April 1, 2015 affidavit and $7,116.50 awarded\n      from the amounts requested in Crowell’s February 25, 2015, motion.\n      To the extent the full amount requested by Plaintiff was not awarded,\n      this Court is sustaining the objections raised by Starbranch.\n\n      CR917 (App. 3).\n\nIn other words, the trial court reduced the amount of attorneys’ fees initially\n\nrequested on February 25, 2015, from $71,345.80 to $7,116.50. Compare CR371\n\nwith CR917 (App. 3). In addition, the trial court reduced the amount of attorneys’\n\nfees requested on April 1, 2015, from $19,345.50 to $19,245.50. Compare CR836-\n\n63 and 1st Supp. CR3-6 with CR917 (App. 3).\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f   G. The trial court grants Starbranch’s motion to dismiss Crowell’s action\n      for declaratory judgment as moot.\n\n      On April 3, 2015, Starbranch filed a motion to dismiss Crowell’s claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief as moot because the Association was terminated in 2013 pursuant\n\nto a settlement agreement. 1st Supp. CR7-122. Crowell did not file a response to\n\nthis motion. On April 22, 2015, the trial court entered an interlocutory order\n\nstating “that Plaintiff Elizabeth Howard Crowell’s action for declaratory judgment\n\nthat she filed against Starbranch is dismissed because the claim is moot.” CR1040\n\n(App. 2) (underline in original).\n\n      On April 24, 2015, Starbranch filed a motion to vacate any order or\n\njudgment previously issued and to dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction. 1st\n\nSupp. CR124-26. The trial court did not rule on this motion.\n\n   H. Order and Final Judgment leads to this appeal.\n\n      On April 16, 2015, Starbranch filed an amended motion for reconsideration\n\nobjecting to the trial court’s consideration of Crowell’s late evidence filed after the\n\nsubmission date for Crowell’s summary judgment motions. CR981-1011. In her\n\namended motion for reconsideration, Starbranch identified her objections to\n\nCrowell’s late evidence and presented affidavits controverting Crowell’s late\n\nevidence. CR981-1011.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      In Crowell’s Response to Starbranch’s Post Judgment Motions, Crowell\n\nrequested the denial of Starbranch’s amended motion for reconsideration and\n\nvarious other post-trial motions filed by Starbranch. CR1041-43. On April 28,\n\n2015, the trial court granted Crowell’s request and entered an Order and Final\n\nJudgment denying Starbranch’s amended motion for reconsideration and awarded\n\nCrowell “attorneys’ fees in the amount of $26,462.00 from Defendant Eileen K.\n\nStarbranch.” CR1059-60 (App. 1). In its Order and Final Judgment, the trial court\n\nheld as follows:\n\n      On April 6, 2015, the Court entered an order resolving Crowell’s\n      claim for declaratory relief . . . (the “Summary Judgment Order”) . . . .\n\n      *     *      *\n\n      On April 22, 2015, the Court entered an [o]rder . . . dismissing\n      Crowell’s claim for declaratory relief as moot because it was resolved\n      by the Summary Judgment Order.\n\n      CR1060 (App. 1).\n\nThe trial court never made any declaration of the respective rights and interests of\n\nCrowell and Starbranch. CR1059-60 (App. 1). Finally, the trial court made the\n\nfollowing statement in its Order and Final Judgment:\n\n      The Court has considered Starbranch’s objections and took them into\n      account in carefully reviewing the subject attorneys’ fees. The Court\n      eliminated requested fees that were not segregated or were related\n      solely to parties other than Starbranch. Fees were awarded only for\n      causes of action which support attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f      CR1059 (App. 1).\n\n                              SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Crowell misused the Declaratory Judgments Act by duplicating the relief she\n\nalready sought in her action to quiet title in a claim for declaratory relief. Crowell\n\nviolated the rule that a party cannot use the Declaratory Judgments Act as a vehicle\n\nto obtain otherwise impermissible attorneys’ fees. Consequently, the judgment\n\nmust be reversed and a take-nothing judgment rendered.            For several other\n\nindependent reasons, the trial court erred or abused its discretion by awarding\n\nattorneys’ fees against Starbranch.\n\n      The trial court improperly usurped the jury’s fact-finding role during a\n\nsummary-judgment proceeding. For instance, the trial court unilaterally reduced\n\nthe amount of attorneys’ fees initially requested in Crowell’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on attorneys’ fees from $71,345.80 to $7,116.50.           Accordingly, the\n\nattorneys’ fee award should be reversed and the case should be remanded to the\n\ntrial court for further proceedings.\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys’ fees that were\n\nneither equitable nor just.    The trial court awarded attorneys’ fees under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act before it even declared the representative rights and\n\ninterests of Crowell and Starbranch. In addition, Starbranch was not even a proper\n\nparty to Crowell’s declaratory judgment action. Finally, there is no evidence that\n\n\n                                         14\n\fStarbranch prolonged the case or prevented a complete and final resolution to this\n\ncase. For each of these independent reasons, the attorneys’ fee award should be\n\nreversed and a take nothing judgment rendered or, in the alternative, remanded to\n\nthe trial court for further proceedings.\n\n      The trial court improperly issued a summary judgment even though the\n\nsummary judgment evidence raised several genuine issues of material fact. The\n\nEbaugh Affidavit and the Starbranch Affidavit each raised genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact.   In addition, genuine issues of material fact necessarily existed\n\nbecause the trial court sustained Starbranch’s objections to Crowell’s failure to\n\nsegregate her attorneys’ fees. Finally, Crowell’s own evidence established the\n\nexistence of genuine issues of material fact.      For each of these independent\n\nreasons, the attorneys’ fee award should be reversed and the case should be\n\nremanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion by considering evidence filed after the\n\nsubmission date and which Starbranch did not have the opportunity to controvert.\n\nTwo days after the submission date on her Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nAttorneys’ Fees, Crowell filed new evidence supporting a ground for summary\n\njudgment that had not been sought in Crowell’s initial summary judgment motion.\n\nBecause the motion was not supported by good cause and the new evidence unduly\n\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fprejudiced Starbranch, the attorneys’ fee award should be reversed and the case\n\nshould be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n      The trial court improperly awarded more relief than was requested in\n\nCrowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees. The new evidence\n\nsubmitted by Crowell two days after the submission date for the summary\n\njudgment motion entailed an independent ground for summary judgment that had\n\nnot been sought in Crowell’s summary judgment motion. Accordingly, this Court\n\nshould reverse and remand as to the attorneys’ fees which were never specifically\n\nrequested in Crowell’s summary judgment motion.\n\n                                     ARGUMENT\n\n      This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment under a de novo standard.\n\nValence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex. 2005). Questions of\n\nlaw are reviewed “without deference to a lower court’s conclusion.” State v. Heal,\n\n917 S.W.2d 6, 9 (Tex. 1996). “When reviewing a summary judgment, [this Court]\n\n‘must examine the entire record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant,\n\nindulging every reasonable inference and resolving any doubts against the\n\nmotion.’” Yancy v. United Surgical Partners Int’l, Inc., 236 S.W.3d 778, 782\n\n(Tex. 2007) (italics in original).\n\n      For several independent reasons, the trial court erred by granting Crowell’s\n\nMotion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees.              First, the Declaratory\n\n\n                                         16\n\fJudgments Act cannot be used as a vehicle to obtain otherwise impermissible\n\nattorneys’ fees. Second, the trial court improperly usurped the jury’s fact-finding\n\nrole during a summary-judgment proceeding.          Third, the summary judgment\n\nevidence raised genuine issues of material fact. Fourth, the trial court granted\n\nCrowell more relief than was requested in her Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nAttorneys’ Fees.\n\n      In addition, for at least a couple of independent reasons, the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by granting Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nAttorneys’ Fees. First, the trial court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys’\n\nfees against Starbranch under circumstances that were neither equitable nor just.\n\nSecond, the trial court abused its discretion by considering evidence filed after the\n\nsubmission date and which Starbranch did not have the opportunity to controvert.\n\n   A. The Declaratory Judgments Act cannot be used as a vehicle to obtain\n      otherwise impermissible attorneys’ fees.\n\n      Crowell has misused the Declaratory Judgments Act. Crowell duplicated the\n\nrelief she already sought in her action to quiet title via declaration. Thus, any\n\naward of attorneys’ fees for Crowell’s declaratory judgment action violates the rule\n\nthat “a party cannot use the [Declaratory Judgments Act] as a vehicle to obtain\n\notherwise impermissible attorney’s fees.” MBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands\n\nOperating Co., 292 S.W.3d 660, 669 (Tex. 2009).\n\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f      As the Texas Supreme Court has explained, “[i]f repleading a claim as a\n\ndeclaratory judgment could justify a fee award, attorney’s fees would be available\n\nfor all parties in all cases. That would repeal not only the American Rule\n\n[prohibiting fee awards unless specifically provided by contract or statute] but also\n\nthe limits imposed on fee awards in other statutes.” Id. For these reasons, “[a]\n\ndeclaratory judgment action may not be used solely to obtain attorney’s fees that\n\nare not otherwise authorized by statute or to settle disputes already pending before\n\na court.” Sw. Guar. Trust Co. v. Hardy Road 13.4 Joint Venture, 981 S.W.2d 951,\n\n956 (Tex. App.–Houston [1st Dist.] 1998, pet. denied).\n\n       The phrases “action to quiet title” and “suit to quiet title” are used\n\ninterchangeably and refer to the same claim.        E.g., U.S. Nat'l Bank Ass’n v.\n\nJohnson, No. 01-10-00837-CV, 2011 WL 6938507, at *2-3 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] Dec. 30, 2011, no pet.) (mem. op.). “[T]he term ‘suit to quiet title’ has\n\nbeen used broadly in reference to legal disputes regarding (1) title to, and\n\npossession of, real property—a trespass-to-try-title action, and (2) validity of other\n\n‘clouds’ which indirectly have an adverse effect on an undisputed owner’s title to\n\nreal property.” Parker v. Hunegnaw, 364 S.W.3d 398, 402 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2012, no pet.). In other words, an action to quiet title and an action to\n\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fremove a cloud on title are one and the same. 7                    “[A] suit . . . to remove\n\nencumbrances, or remove a cloud or quiet title may be maintained even though the\n\nadversary is not actually occupying or in possession of the land.” Texan Dev. Co.\n\nv. Hodges, 237 S.W.2d 436, 439 (Tex. Civ. App.—Amarillo 1951, no writ). In\n\nfact, an action to quiet title may be asserted, as done so by Crowell in this case,\n\nwhere any instrument 8 “would cast a cloud on the owner’s enjoyment of the\n\nproperty.” Mortg. Elec. Registration Sys., Inc. v. Groves, No. 14–10–00090–CV,\n\n2011 WL 1364070, at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Apr. 12, 2011, pet.\n\ndenied) (mem. op.). Attorneys’ fees are not recoverable in an action to quiet title.\n\nSw. Guar. Trust Co., 981 S.W.2d at 957.\n\n       Here, an examination of the pleadings reveals that Crowell’s declaratory-\n\njudgment action duplicated her action to quiet title. Crowell sought a declaration\n\nthat five documents filed in connection with the property owners’ association have\n\n“no force and effect,” are “nullified” and are “no longer a cloud on Ms. Crowell’s\n\ntitle to, and right of ownership of, the Property . . . .” CR19-20. In her action to\n\nquiet title, Crowell alleged as follows:\n\n7\n  Lonnie E. Griffith, Jr., J.D., 74 C.J.S. Quieting Title § 3 (April 2015) (Texas does “not observe\nthe distinction between an action to quiet title and to remove a cloud on title, treating the actions\nas one and the same”).\n8\n  Hahn v. Love, 321 S.W.3d 517, 531 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied) (“A\ncloud on title exists when an outstanding claim or encumbrance is shown, which on its face, if\nvalid, would affect or impair the title of the owner of the property.” . . . “Any deed, contract,\njudgment or other instrument not void on its face that purports to convey an interest in or make\nany charge upon the land of a true owner, the invalidity of which would require proof, is a cloud\nupon the legal title of the owner.”).\n\n\n                                                 19\n\f       the [five] documents filed by Defendants in the real property records\n       (see Harris County Clerk File Nos. 20120521806, 20120521807,\n       20120521808, 201205436661, and 2012054016216) are clouds or\n       encumbrances on Ms. Crowell’s right of ownership of the Property,\n       which affect or impair Ms. Crowell’s title to the Property. Ms.\n       Crowell seeks to nullify the effect of these disputed filings and\n       encumbrances. Ms. Crowell is entitled to a judgment that sets aside\n       these improper filings and removes them as clouds on her title.\n\n       CR21.\n\nIn other words, Crowell sought the same relief in her claim for declaratory relief\n\nthat she sought in her action to quiet title. CR19-21. Because Crowell’s claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief merely duplicated the issues set forth in her action to quiet title,\n\nCrowell is not entitled to attorney’s fees based on her claim for declaratory relief.\n\nWise v. Conklin, No. 01–13–00840–CV, 2015 WL 1778612, at *8 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] Apr. 16, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.) (collecting cases and\n\naffirming the trial court’s denial of Crowell’s claim for attorneys’ fees because the\n\nUDJA could not be used to recover attorney's fees for a suit brought to remove\n\ncloud from title); Sw. Guar. Trust Co., 981 S.W.2d at 956 (“Attorney’s fees are not\n\navailable in a suit to quiet title or to remove cloud on title.”).\n\n       In addition, in her claim for declaratory relief, Crowell did not seek to\n\nconstrue any terms of the instruments filed by the Association.             CR19-21.\n\nConsequently, Crowell’s declaratory judgment action could offer her no more\n\nrelief than her action to quiet title.\n\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\f      For these reasons, this Court should reverse the portion of the trial court's\n\njudgment awarding attorneys’ fees to Crowell and render judgment that Crowell\n\ntake nothing on her requests for attorneys’ fees. Universal Printing Co. v. Premier\n\nVictorian Homes, Inc., 73 S. W.3d 283, 296 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001,\n\npet. denied) (“There is no basis for declaratory relief when a party is seeking in the\n\nsame action a different, enforceable remedy, and a judicial declaration would add\n\nnothing to what would be implicit or express in a final judgment for the\n\nenforceable remedy.”); Sw. Guar. Trust, 981 S.W.2d at 956. (denying request for\n\nattorneys’ fees where the declaratory judgment action simply sought to nullify the\n\nclouds of title rather than to construe the terms of the challenged instruments).\n\nBecause Crowell only obtained attorneys’ fees from Starbranch, and Crowell\n\ncannot recover attorneys’ fees under her claim for declaratory relief as a matter of\n\nlaw, the judgment must be reversed and a take-nothing judgment rendered.\n\n   B. The trial court improperly usurped the jury’s fact-finding role during a\n      summary-judgment proceeding.\n\n      “Pursuant to Section 37.009, the judge is to determine whether an award of\n\nattorney’s fees is equitable and just; however, even when declaratory relief has\n\nbeen determined by summary judgment, the issue of whether attorney’s fees are\n\nreasonable and necessary is a question of fact for the jury to determine when the\n\njury is the trier of fact.” Fuqua v. Oncor Elec. Delivery Co., 315 S.W.3d 552, 559-\n\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f60 (Tex. App.—Eastland 2010, pet. denied) (citing City of Garland v.

CR56-58; 1093.         “A jury\n\nrequest by one party inures to the benefit of all other parties.” 9              Consequently,\n\nStarbranch always had a right to a jury trial in this case. Starbranch never waived\n\nher right to a jury trial in this case.\n\n       Here, Crowell submitted an affidavit stating that $71,354.80 was a\n\nreasonable amount for the legal services rendered as of February 24, 2015.\n\nCR386-468.

For these reasons, this Court reversed the trial court’s\n\nsummary judgment on the attorney’s fee award and remanded the case for trial. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                          24\n\f      As in McGlown, the trial court below was not authorized to engage in fact\n\nfinding at the summary judgment stage.\n\n      The summary judgment rule does not provide for a trial by deposition\n      or affidavit. The rule provides a method for summarily ending a case\n      involving only a question of law and no genuine fact issues. See\n      Gaines v. Hamman, 163 Tex. 618, 358 S.W.2d 557, 563 (1962). The\n      trial court must determine whether fact issues exist, not weigh the\n      evidence or its credibility and try the case on affidavits. Gulbenkian,\n      252 S.W.2d at 931.\n\n      Thompson v. Community Health Inv. Corp., 892 S.W.2d 440, 441-42\n      (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995), rev'd on other grounds, 923 S.W.2d 569\n      (Tex. 1996).\n\nFor these reasons, the amount of Crowell’s reasonable attorneys’ fee is still a\n\nfactual issue to be tried. Accordingly, the attorneys’ fee award should be reversed\n\nand the case should be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n   C. The attorneys’ fees are neither equitable nor just.\n\n      In a declaratory judgment action, the trial “court may award costs and\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.” Tex. Civ. Prac.\n\n& Rem. Code § 37.009. Though a question of law, the determination of whether\n\nattorneys’ fees are equitable and just under the Texas Declaratory Judgment Act is\n\nreviewed for an abuse of discretion. Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 20-21. “[A] clear\n\nfailure by the trial court to analyze or apply the law correctly will constitute an\n\nabuse of discretion.” Walker v. Packer, 827 S.W.2d 833, 840 (Tex. 1992). In\n\naddition, “[i]t is an abuse of discretion for a trial court to rule . . . without\n\n\n                                         25\n\fsupporting evidence.” Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21. “[I]n reviewing an attorney fee\n\naward under the [Declaratory Judgments] Act, the court of appeals must determine\n\nwhether the trial court abused its discretion by awarding fees . . . when the award\n\nwas inequitable or unjust.” Id. at 21; State & Cnty. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. ex rel. S.\n\nUnited Gen. Agency of Tex. v. Walker, 228 S.W.3d 404, 407 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth 2007, no pet.) (“A court of appeals will determine that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion in granting attorney’s fees in a declaratory judgment action if ‘the\n\naward was inequitable or unjust as a matter of law.’”).\n\n      For at least three independent reasons, the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nawarding fees that were not equitable and just. First, the trial court awarded\n\nattorneys’ fees before it even made any declarations between Crowell and\n\nStarbranch or determined that Starbranch had any liability at all.           Second,\n\nStarbranch was not even a proper party to Crowell’s claim for declaratory relief.\n\nThird, despite Crowell’s bald claim to the contrary, Starbranch did not prevent a\n\ncomplete and final resolution to this case.\n\n             1. The trial court awarded attorneys’ fees before it even declared\n                the respective rights and interests of Crowell and Starbranch.\n\n      “Only after the trial court declares the parties’ rights under the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act, [should the trial court address] whether the evidence is\n\nfactually sufficient to support a finding that the fees are reasonable and necessary\n\n\n\n\n                                          26\n\fand determine if the award is equitable and just.”      VICC Homeowners’ Ass’n v.\n\nLos Campeones, Inc., 143 S.W.3d 832, 839-40 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 2004,\n\nno pet.) (Castillo, J., concurring). In support of this holding, Justice Castillo\n\nreasoned as follows:\n\n      A claim for attorney fees under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments\n      Act is not severable from the merits of the declaratory judgment\n      action itself. See Dalisa, Inc. v. Bradford, 81 S.W.3d 876, 880 (Tex.\n      App.—Austin 2002, no pet.). “‘That a suit for the statutory attorney’s\n      fees as a separate action could not be maintained is evident from the\n      wording of the statute . . . . The attorney’s fees, while not costs,\n      partake of the nature of the costs of suit and are assessed in\n      accordance with the judgment’ reached in the proceeding.” Dalisa,\n      Inc., 81 S.W.3d at 881 (quoting Huff v. Fidelity Union Life Ins. Co.,\n      158 Tex. 433, 312 S.W.2d 493, 501 (1958)). I conclude that the\n      reasonableness, necessity, equitableness, and justness of an award of\n      attorney fees in a declaratory judgment action necessarily are related\n      to the trial court’s declaration of the rights of the parties. I would hold\n      that an award of attorney fees in this case must abide the declaration\n      itself.\n\n      Id. at 839.\n\n      Here, the trial court awarded attorneys’ fees before it even declared the\n\nrespective rights and interests of Crowell and Starbranch. “The purpose of the\n\n[Declaratory Judgments] Act is to provide a procedural device whereby litigants\n\ncan obtain a judicial determination of a controversy.” Kennesaw Life & Accident\n\nIns. Co. v. Goss, 694 S.W.2d 115, 117 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1985,\n\nwrit ref'd n.r.e.) The Act is not a “vehicle to recover attorney’s fees.” City of\n\nCarrollton v. RIHR Inc., 308 S.W.3d 444, 454–55 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, pet.\n\n\n                                          27\n\fdenied). In fact, “fees are not permissible under § 37.009 where [the declaration is\n\nsought] solely for the purpose of obtaining attorney’s fees.” Tanglewood Homes\n\nAss’n, Inc. v. Feldman, 436 S.W.3d 48, 69 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2014,\n\nno pet. h.).\n\n       Because an attorneys’ fee award is merely ancillary to a declaration under\n\nthe Act, and an attorney fee award is “not severable from the merits of the\n\ndeclaratory judgment action itself,” it is inequitable and unjust as a matter of law to\n\naward attorneys’ fees under the Act until a declaration of the rights of the parties\n\nhas been made. Cf. Crown Asset Mgmt., LLC v. Short, No. 01-08-00042-CV, 2009\n\nWL 1025729, at *4 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist .] 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.)\n\n(“In the instant case, the trial court’s award of attorney's fees to Short for his\n\ndeclaratory judgment action was inequitable and unjust because . . . Short produced\n\nno evidence to support his claim for declaratory judgment.”). To hold otherwise\n\nwould turn the American Rule, prohibiting fee awards unless specifically provided\n\nby contract or statute, on its head. It also would put the cart before the horse by\n\nallowing a party to recover attorneys’ fees without the court first determining\n\nliability.\n\n       For these reasons, the award of attorneys’ fees was neither equitable nor just\n\nand the trial court abused its discretion in making the award. Accordingly, the\n\n\n\n\n                                          28\n\fattorneys’ fee award should be reversed and the case should be remanded to the\n\ntrial court for further proceedings.\n\n             2. It is inequitable and unjust to award attorneys’ fees against a\n                person who was not even a proper party to the declaratory\n                judgment action.\n\n      Because Starbranch raised a fact issue on her defense that she has never been\n\na proper party in this case, it was inequitable and unjust as a matter of law for the\n\ntrial court to assess attorneys’ fees against Starbranch. If anything, the trial court\n\nshould have awarded attorneys’ fees against Crowell for unnecessarily joining\n\nStarbranch as a party in this lawsuit, “causing her to incur fees that she otherwise\n\nwould not have had to incur.” E.g. State and Cty. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 228 S.W.3d\n\nat 411 (holing it was just and equitable to award attorneys’ fees to a party that was\n\nunnecessarily joined in a declaratory judgment action).\n\n      In her response to Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability,\n\nStarbranch asserted that she was not a proper party to Crowell’s declaratory\n\njudgment action. CR740-43. Significantly, Crowell’s evidence did not identify\n\nStarbranch as either an officer or a board member of the Association. CR 217-21.\n\nCrowell’s evidence demonstrated that Starbranch was nothing more than a member\n\nof the Association.     CR 181; 211; 260; 302. Consequently, Crowell’s own\n\nsummary-judgment evidence raised a fact issue as to whether Starbranch was a\n\nproper party to the declaratory judgment action. Starbranch also produced\n\n\n                                         29\n\fsummary-judgment evidence that raised a fact issue as to whether she was a proper\n\nparty to Plaintiff’s declaratory judgment action. CR755-62.\n\n      A property owners association, its officers, and board members are proper\n\nparties to a landowner’s claim for declaratory relief. Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code §§\n\n22.221 and 22.235. However, “[t]he members of a [nonprofit] corporation are not\n\npersonally liable for a debt, liability, or obligation of the corporation.” Tex. Bus.\n\nOrgs. Code § 22.152.      To show that she was not a proper party, Starbranch\n\nexplained in her response to Crowell’s summary judgment motions that she was\n\nnothing more than a member of the Association and that she had never asserted an\n\ninterest in the Property. CR 740-743.\n\n      In sum, it is undisputed that the Association was a nonprofit corporation.\n\nCR 100. It is undisputed that Starbranch was neither an officer nor a board\n\nmember for the property owners’ association. CR 217-21. Starbranch testified\n\nthat she had never asserted any interest in Crowell’s Property. CR 758. In fact,\n\nStarbranch disclaimed any and all interest in Crowell’s Property. CR 758. Under\n\nthese facts, Section 22.152 shielded Starbranch from personal liability arising out\n\nof her participation as a member in the Association. Cf. Reiner v. Ehrlich, 66 A.3d\n\n1132, 1143 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2013) (affirming dismissal of Plaintiff’s\n\ndeclaratory judgment action against individual homeowners due to homeowners’\n\nimmunity from liability under Md. Code Ann., Cts. & Jud. Proc. § 5-422); 65 AM.\n\n\n                                         30\n\fJUR. 2d Quieting Title § 63 (Database updated May 2015) (“An action to quiet title\n\nlies against those who, at the time it is instituted, are the present claimants to the\n\nland under the instruments that creates the cloud.”).\n\n      In Reiner, a married couple sought declaratory relief not only against the\n\nhomeowners association but also against sixteen individual homeowners in the\n\ncommunity. Reiner , 66 A.3d. at 1134-35. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim for declaratory relief against the individual homeowners because under\n\nMaryland law the homeowners were immune from liability as long as they were\n\nacting within the scope of their duties under the homeowners’ association. Id. at\n\n1143. Under Texas law, Starbranch is similarly shielded from personal liability\n\narising out of her participation as a member in the Association at issue in this case.\n\nTex. Bus. Orgs. Code § 22.152.\n\n      This conclusion is supported by Crowell’s decision to dismiss defendants\n\nthat were similarly situated to Starbranch.        Like Starbranch, the following\n\ndefendants did nothing more that than approve instruments prepared by the petition\n\ncommittee or another representative of the Association: George L. Parker, Eva K.\n\nParker, Garret S. Madderra, Georgia W. Hitchcock, James Carper, and Eric\n\nMazziotta. CR106-114; 167-185; 197-215; 246-264; 275-283; 293-302. Crowell\n\ndismissed each of these defendants from the lawsuit, and none paid any attorneys’\n\nfees. CR26-46; 59-61; 65-68; 72-74. When Crowell dismissed these defendants\n\n\n                                         31\n\fbefore obtaining any judgment in the lawsuit, Crowell knew that they were not\n\nproper parties to a declaratory judgment action.\n\n         In addition, it is important to note that Starbranch did not even sign two of\n\nthe instruments that Crowell sought to declare as void. It is undisputed that\n\nStarbranch did not sign the “Notice of Formation of Petition Committee” 10 or the\n\n“Petition Pursuant to Property Code § 204.006 To Create The Jandor Gardens\n\nAssociation, Inc.,”11 which are the subjects of the first and fourth declarations\n\nsought in Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability.                  CR20.\n\nConsequently, even if she was not shielded from liability under the Texas Business\n\nOrganizations Code, Starbranch could not have been a proper party to the first and\n\nfourth declarations sought against her. After all, there can be no controversy\n\nbetween Crowell and Starbranch in connection with documents that Starbranch did\n\nnot even sign. Bonham State Bank v. Beadle, 907 S.W.2d 465, 467 (Tex. 1995)\n\n(“To constitute a justiciable controversy, there must exist a real and substantial\n\ncontroversy involving genuine conflict of tangible interests and not merely a\n\ntheoretical dispute.”).\n\n         Viewed in the light most favorable to Starbranch, the evidence demonstrated\n\nthat Starbranch was not a proper party to the declaratory judgment action or suit to\n\nquiet title. Cf. Kennesaw Life & Accident Ins. Co, 694 S.W.2d at 118 (holding that\n\n10\n     CR154-57.\n11\n     CR100-04.\n\n\n                                           32\n\fdeclaratory judgment was inappropriate against a party in an action to remove a\n\ncloud on plaintiff’s title to real property, even though the party may have played a\n\nrole in creating the cloud, because the party had disclaimed any interest in the\n\nproperty and was not in possession of the property). Consequently, if a take-\n\nnothing judgment is not rendered, this Court should reverse the trial court's\n\njudgment awarding attorneys’ fees to Crowell and remand for trial.\n\n             3. There is no evidence that Starbranch prolonged the case or\n                prevented a complete and final resolution to this case.\n\n      The only evidence presented to the trial court regarding whether it was\n\nequitable or just to assess attorney’s fees against Starbranch was the conclusory\n\nand self-serving affidavit testimony of Crowell’s lead attorney, John B. Shely. CR\n\n386-389.\n\n      Shely testified “[f]inal resolution of the suit . . . has been drawn out by the\n\nfailure of Starbranch to file an answer for over fourteen months, despite being\n\nserved with process, and by her failure to rescind her signature to various\n\ndocuments at issue in the case.” CR 389. Nowhere does Shely testify how or why\n\nfinal resolution of the suit depended upon Starbranch’s appearance in this lawsuit\n\nor rescission of her signatures. In fact, final resolution of the suit did not depend\n\nupon whether Starbranch appeared in this suit or rescinded her signatures; it\n\ndepended on settlement with the proper parties to the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                         33\n\f      Before Starbranch even made an appearance in this suit, Crowell had already\n\nobtained all the relief that she sought through her suit to quiet title and her\n\nduplicative declaratory judgment action. CR345-46. In 2013, Crowell entered into\n\na global settlement with the Association, its officers and directors. CR866-908\n\n(App. 4).   The global settlement agreement removed all clouds of title and\n\nterminated the Association. CR866-908 (App. 4). In other words, Crowell’s claim\n\nfor declaratory relief was completely resolved in 2013 prior to Starbranch’s\n\nappearance. CR866-908 (App. 4); 1st Supp. CR 119-22; CR 790-94.\n\n      Moreover, as explained above, Starbranch has never been a proper party to\n\nthis lawsuit. See Argument C(2). Consequently, despite Crowell’s claim to the\n\ncontrary, Starbranch could not have prolonged the case or “prevent[ed] a complete\n\nand final resolution to this case.” CR371. For these reasons, Shely’s testimony is\n\nconclusory and therefore not competent summary judgment evidence. Texas\n\nDivision-Tranter v. Carrozza, 876 S.W.2d 312, 314 (Tex. 1994) (holding\n\nconclusory statements in support of a motion for summary judgment are “not\n\ncompetent summary judgment evidence”).\n\n      An affidavit is conclusory if it states a conclusion “without any explanation”\n\nor asks the fact-finder to “take my word for it.” Arkoma Basin Exploration Co. v.\n\nFMF Assocs. 1990-A Ltd., 249 S.W.3d 380, 389 (Tex. 2008); see also BLACK’S\n\nLAW DICTIONARY 308 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “conclusory” as “[e]xpressing a\n\n\n                                        34\n\ffactual inference without stating the underlying facts on which the inference is\n\nbased”).\n\n      A conclusory statement does not provide the underlying facts to\n      support the conclusion. Dolcefino v. Randolph, 19 S.W.3d 906, 930\n      (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2000, pet. denied). A conclusory\n      statement may set forth an unsupported legal conclusion or\n      unsupported factual conclusion. S & I Mgmt., Inc. v. Sungju Choi, 331\n      S.W.3d 849, 856 (Tex. App.–Dallas 2011, no pet.); Choctaw Props.,\n      L.L.C. v. Aledo Indep. Sch. Dist., 127 S.W.3d 235, 242 (Tex. App.—\n      Waco 2003, no pet.). Conclusory affidavits are not sufficient to raise\n      fact issues because they are not credible or susceptible to being\n      readily controverted. Ryland Group v. Hood, 924 S.W.2d 120, 122\n      (Tex. 1996) (per curiam). Objections that statements in an affidavit\n      are conclusory assert defects of substance, which may be raised on\n      appeal for the first time. S & Mgmt., Inc., 331 S.W.3d at 856;\n      Rockwall Commons Assocs., Ltd., 331 S.W.3d at 507.\n\n      Pipkin v. Kroger Texas, L.P., 383 S.W.3d 655, 670 (Tex. App.—\n      Houston [14th Dist.] 2012, pet. denied).\n\nSimply put, Crowell offered no competent evidence to establish it was equitable or\n\njust to assess attorneys’ fees against Starbranch.\n\n      Crowell offered no other grounds for supporting her claim that attorneys’\n\nfees against Starbranch were just and equitable. Because there is no evidence that\n\nStarbranch prolonged the case or prevented a complete and final resolution to this\n\ncase, it was inequitable and unjust as a matter of law for the district court to assess\n\nattorneys’ fees against Starbranch. Bocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21 (“It is an abuse of\n\ndiscretion for a trial court to rule . . . without supporting evidence.”); Crown Asset\n\nMgmt., LLC, 2009 WL 1025729, at *4 (“In the instant case, the trial court’s award\n\n\n                                          35\n\fof attorney’s fees to Short for his declaratory judgment action was inequitable and\n\nunjust because . . . Short produced no evidence to support his claim for declaratory\n\njudgment.”). Accordingly, the attorneys’ fee award should be reversed and a take\n\nnothing judgment rendered or, in the alternative, remanded to the trial court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n      D. The summary judgment evidence raised genuine issues of material fact.\n\n         “The award of attorney’s fees in a summary judgment is improper unless the\n\nevidence of the reasonableness of those fees is uncontroverted.” Guity v. C.C.I.\n\nEnter., Co., 54 S.W.3d 526, 528 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.).\n\nBecause Starbranch introduced the affidavit of Nelson S. Ebaugh 12 and the\n\naffidavit of Eileen K. Starbranch 13 in response to Crowell’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on attorneys’ fees, Starbranch created genuine issues of fact regarding\n\nthe reasonableness of the fees that precluded the granting of summary judgment\n\nunder Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c). Jay Petroleum, L.L.C. v. EOG Res., Inc., 332\n\nS.W.3d 534, 542-43 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied) (holding it\n\nwas improper to award attorneys' fees in partial summary judgment because\n\nappellant raised a fact issue by submitting a controverting affidavit from its\n\nattorney); General Elec. Supply Co., 857 S.W.2d at 601 (“The only authority we\n\nfind permitting the award of attorneys’ fees on a summary judgment does not apply\n\n12\n     CR 769-94\n13\n     CR 755-62\n\n\n                                         36\n\funless the evidence of the reasonableness of those fees is uncontroverted; it does\n\nnot apply when, as here, conflicting affidavits from opposing attorneys are\n\npresented.”) (collecting cases).\n\n      For several independent reasons, the summary judgment evidence raised\n\ngenuine issues of material fact as to whether the attorneys’ fees were reasonable\n\nand necessary. First, the Affidavit of Nelson S. Ebaugh controverted Crowell’s\n\nsummary judgment evidence.         Second, the Affidavit of Eileen K. Starbranch\n\ncontroverted Crowell’s summary judgment evidence.           Third, Crowell’s own\n\nevidence established the existence of genuine issues of material fact on her claim\n\nfor attorneys’ fees.\n\n             1. The Affidavit of Nelson S. Ebaugh raised genuine issues of\n                material fact.\n\n      “As a general rule, the party seeking to recover attorney’s fees carries the\n\nburden of proof.” Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex.\n\n1991). “Although courts should consider several factors when awarding attorney’s\n\nfees, a short hand version of these considerations is that the trial court may award\n\nthose fees that are ‘reasonable and necessary’ for the prosecution of the suit.” Id.\n\nWhether an award of attorneys’ fees is reasonable and necessary is a fact question.\n\nBocquet, 972 S.W.2d at 21 (interpreting the Declaratory Judgments Act to allow a\n\njury, not the trial court, to determine the amount of “reasonable and necessary”\n\nattorney’s fees).\n\n                                         37\n\f      In the Affidavit of John B. Shely, Shely testified that $71,354.80 was “a\n\nreasonable fee for the work which has been performed by Andrews Kurth in this\n\nmatter as of the date of this affidavit . . . .” CR387. Starbranch controverted this\n\nopinion with the Affidavit of Nelson S. Ebaugh. Ebaugh testified as follows:\n\n      [I]t is my opinion that the amount of $71,354.80 sought by Crowell\n      against Starbranch is unreasonable because Crowell has only served\n      one request for disclosure on Starbranch, has only served one request\n      for production on Starbranch, has not taken any depositions in this\n      case, and has not filed any discovery motions against Starbranch in\n      this case. Under the circumstances, it is unreasonable to assess\n      $71,354.80 against Starbranch when Crowell’s attorneys have spent\n      so little time prosecuting Crowell’s declaratory judgment action\n      against Starbranch.\n\n      CR 771.\n\nConsequently, the Ebaugh Affidavit raised a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether $71,354.80 was a reasonable and necessary fee for the prosecution of\n\nCrowell’s claim for declaratory relief against Starbranch. Engel v. Pettit, 713\n\nS.W.2d 770, 771-73 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1986, no writ) (holding that\n\ntrial court erred in granting summary judgment because of fact issue raised by\n\nattorney’s fees affidavit of nonmovant). The remainder of Ebaugh’s affidavit\n\ncreated additional genuine issues of material fact. For instance, paragraphs four\n\nand five of the Ebaugh Affidavit also controverted Shely’s opinion that $71,354.80\n\nwas “a reasonable fee for the work which has been performed by Andrews Kurth\n\nin this matter as of the date of this affidavit . . . .” CR770-771; 387. Because the\n\n\n                                        38\n\fevidence was sufficient to raise genuine issues of material fact, the trial court erred\n\nin granting summary judgment in favor of Crowell.\n\n                  2. The Affidavit of Eileen K. Starbranch raised genuine issues of\n                     material fact.\n\n         In the Affidavit of John B. Shely, Shely testified as follows:\n\n         Starbranch was served with the correspondence attached as Exhibit 4-\n         E contemporaneously when the lawsuit was served on her. She did not\n         respond to me regarding Exhibit 4-E nor did she rescind her signature\n         to the documents in issue.\n\n         CR389.\n\nIn her affidavit, Starbranch contradicted this statement by testifying as follows:\n\n         In his affidavit attached to Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n         on Attorneys’ Fees as Exhibit 4, John B. Shely claims that, on July 1,\n         2013, I was served with a letter and its enclosure entitled ‘Rescission\n         of Real Property Filings.’ However, I did not receive this letter\n         inviting me to execute the ‘Rescission of Real Property Filings’ when\n         Mr. Shely claimed it was served upon me. The first time that I saw\n         the letter and its enclosure was as an attachment to Crowell’s Motion\n         for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees as Exhibit 4-E.\n\n         CR758.\n\nConsequently, the Starbranch Affidavit raised a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether Starbranch had ever been served with Exhibit 4-E 14, a letter and its\n\nenclosure entitled ‘Rescission of Real Property Filings,’ before February 25, 2015.\n\nBecause the evidence was sufficient to raise a genuine issue of material fact, as to\n\n\n\n14\n     CR 475-79.\n\n\n                                            39\n\fwhether Starbranch prolonged the litigation, the trial court erred in granting\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Crowell.\n\n             3. Genuine issues of material fact necessarily existed because the\n                trial court sustained Starbranch’s objection to Crowell’s\n                failure to segregate.\n\n      “A party seeking to recover attorney’s fees has the burden to show that the\n\nfees were reasonable and necessary which, among other things, requires the party\n\nto show the fees were incurred on a claim that allows recovery of such fees.”\n\nGoldman v. Olmstead, 414 S.W.3d 346, 367 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2013, pet.\n\ndenied). The trial court sustained Starbranch’s objections to Crowell’s failure to\n\nsegregate nonrecoverable fees from recoverable fees and Crowell’s failure to\n\nsegregate the fees owed by different parties.         CR 917.     Consequently, as\n\nacknowledged by the trial court, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nhow much of the attorneys’ fees, if any, incurred by Crowell should have been\n\napportioned to her claim for declaratory relief against Starbranch.\n\n      “[T]he need to segregate attorney’s fees is a question of law, while the\n\nextent to which certain claims can or cannot be segregated is a mixed question of\n\nlaw and fact.” Ca Partners v. Spears, 274 S.W.3d 51, 81 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2008, pet. denied) (citing Tony Gullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212\n\nS.W.3d 299, 312-13 (Tex.2006)). Once the trial court has decided that attorneys’\n\nfees need to be segregated, only under limited circumstances may the trial court\n\n\n                                         40\n\fparticipate in the segregation of attorneys’ fees. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 341. For\n\nexample, a court may decide as a matter of law whether overcoming an affirmative\n\ndefense was necessary to prevail on a claim under which attorneys’ fees are\n\nrecoverable. Id. However, “when . . . it cannot be denied that at least some of the\n\nattorney’s fees are attributable only to claims for which fees are not recoverable,\n\nsegregation of fees ought to be required and the jury ought to decide the rest.” Id.\n\nBecause some of the attorneys’ fees that Crowell sought were “attributable only to\n\nclaims for which fees are not recoverable,” Starbranch was entitled to have a jury,\n\nnot the trial court, segregate Crowell’s attorneys’ fees.\n\n      In sum, as acknowledged by the trial court, the summary judgment evidence\n\nraised a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the attorneys’ fees sought were\n\nappropriately segregated. Accordingly, the attorneys’ fees award should be\n\nreversed and remanded to the trial court for a jury, not the judge, to segregate the\n\nattorneys’ fees. AMX Enters., L.L.P. v. Master Realty Corp., 283 S.W.3d 506, 523\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2009, no pet.) (“remand is required to calculate the\n\nsegregated award”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          41\n\f            4. Crowell’s own evidence established the existence of genuine\n               issues of material fact.\n\n      Crowell presented contradictory evidence as to the amount of reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys’ fees incurred by her. First, Crowell introduced the Affidavit\n\nof John B. Shely wherein Shely testified as follows:\n\n      In my opinion, a sum equal to $71,354.80 is a reasonable fee for the\n      work which has been performed by Andrews Kurth in this matter as of\n      the date of this affidavit [February 24, 2015].\n\n      CR387.\n\nIn other words, Shely claimed that $71,354.80 was a reasonable and necessary fee\n\nfor representing Crowell from February 28, 2013, through February 24, 2015.\n\nThen, Crowell introduced the Supplement to the Affidavit of John B. Shely\n\nwherein Shely claimed that reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees incurred by\n\nCrowell from November 3, 2014, through March 28, 2015, amounted to\n\n$19,345.50. 1st Supp. CR3-6. These two affidavits were inconsistent with one\n\nanother because they each identified a different amount for the allegedly\n\nreasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees incurred between November 3, 2014, and\n\nFebruary 24, 2015. Armbruster v. Memorial Southwest Hosp., 857 S.W.2d 938,\n\n941 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1993, no writ) (“The movant’s own evidence\n\nmay establish the existence of a genuine issue of material fact . . . .”). Given the\n\nconflicting evidence presented by Crowell on the amount of her reasonable and\n\n\n\n\n                                        42\n\fnecessary attorney’s fees between November 3, 2014, and February 24, 2015, there\n\nare genuine issues of material fact as to the amount of her reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys’ fees.\n\n   E. The trial court abused its discretion by considering evidence filed after\n      the submission date and which Starbranch did not have the opportunity\n      to controvert.\n\n      A trial court’s decision to allow evidence to be filed after the submission\n\ndate on a motion for summary judgment and before summary judgment is rendered\n\nis reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Beavers v. Goose Creek Consol. I.S.D., 884\n\nS.W.2d 932, 935 (Tex. App.—Waco, 1994, writ denied). Late-filed summary\n\njudgment evidence may be considered by the trial court only upon a showing of (1)\n\ngood cause, and (2) no undue prejudice. Caldwell v. Carrollton Air Conditioning,\n\nInc., No. 07-05-0241-CV, 2007 WL 2390425, at *6 (Tex. App.—Amarillo Aug.\n\n22, 2007, pet. denied) (mem. op.) (citing Wheeler v. Green, 157 S.W.3d 439, 442\n\n(Tex.2005)); see also Carpenter v. Cimarron Hydrocarbons Corp., 98 S.W.3d 682,\n\n686 (Tex.2002) (“Our rules . . . provide that a trial court may permit an act to be\n\ndone after a period prescribed in other procedural rules upon a showing of ‘good\n\ncause.’ Tex. R. Civ. P. 5.”). “Good cause exists when a failure was the result of\n\naccident or mistake and not intentional or the result of conscious indifference.” Id.\n\n“Undue prejudice depends on whether allowing late submission will delay trial or\n\nsignificantly hamper the opposing party’s ability to prepare for it.” Id.\n\n\n                                          43\n\f      Two days after the submission date on her Motion for Summary Judgment\n\non Attorneys’ Fees, Crowell filed new evidence, entitled the “Supplement to the\n\nAffidavit of John B. Shely.” 1st Supp. CR3-6. The Supplement to the Affidavit of\n\nJohn B. Shely identified $19,345.50 in additional attorneys’ fees that Crowell had\n\nnot requested in her Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees. Compare\n\nCR366-480 with CR836-63 and 1st Supp. CR3-6. Significantly, Crowell failed to\n\ndemonstrate that her late filing of evidence was accidental instead of intentional or\n\nthe result of conscious indifference. CR836-63; 1st Supp. CR3-6.        In addition,\n\nCrowell failed to demonstrate that her late filing would not cause Starbranch undue\n\nprejudice. CR836-63; 1st Supp. CR3-6.\n\n      Without giving Starbranch an appropriate opportunity to object or otherwise\n\nrespond, and less than a week after Crowell filed the new evidence, the trial court\n\nawarded $19,245.50 (of the $19,345.50 sought in Crowell’s Motion to Consider\n\nthe Supplemental Affidavit). CR917 (App. 3).\n\n      Starbranch filed an amended motion for reconsideration objecting to the trial\n\ncourt’s consideration of the new evidence. CR 981-1011. In her amended motion\n\nfor reconsideration, Starbranch identified her objections to Crowell’s new evidence\n\nand presented affidavits controverting Crowell’s new evidence. CR 981-1011. The\n\ntrial court denied Starbranch’s motion for reconsideration. CR 1059-60 (App. 1).\n\n\n\n\n                                         44\n\f      Because summary judgment is a “harsh remedy,” the notice requirements of\n\nthe rule must be “strictly construed.” Sams v. N.L. Indus., Inc., 735 S.W.2d 486,\n\n487 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, no writ). Starbranch should have been\n\ngiven notice of when the trial court would consider Crowell’s new evidence. Tex.\n\nR. Civ. P. 21 (b) (“An application to the court for an order and notice of any\n\nhearing thereon, not presented during a hearing or a trial, must be served upon all\n\nother parties not less than three days before the time specified for the hearing,\n\nunless otherwise provided by these rules or shortened by the court.”). However,\n\nCrowell did not provide Starbranch with notice of either a hearing or a submission\n\ndate on Crowell’s Motion to Consider the Supplemental Affidavit. Consequently,\n\nStarbranch had no way of knowing how long she had to respond to Crowell’s new\n\nevidence. Under these circumstances, Starbranch was unduly prejudiced.\n\n      To give Starbranch a full opportunity to respond to Crowell’s new evidence,\n\nStarbranch should have been given notice of a hearing or submission date on\n\nCrowell’s Motion to Consider the Supplemental Affidavit and adequate time to\n\nrespond to Crowell’s new evidence.      Without notice of when Crowell’s new\n\nevidence would be considered by the trial court or an opportunity to object or\n\notherwise respond to the new evidence, Starbranch was unduly prejudiced. Cf.\n\nSanders v. Capitol Area Council, 930 S.W.2d 905, 911 (Tex. App.—Austin 1996,\n\nno writ) (“[A]llowing arguments made in the movant’s reply to be considered, after\n\n\n                                        45\n\fthe fact, as independent grounds for summary judgment would subvert the orderly\n\nprocess contemplated by rule 166a and put the nonmovant to an unfair burden.”);\n\nExtended Services Program, Inc. v. First Extended Serv. Corp., 601 S.W.2d 469,\n\n470 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1980, writ ref'd n.r.e.) (“To hold otherwise would\n\npermit the movant to take unfair advantage of the nonmovant by permitting the\n\nmovant to serve his summary judgment evidence on the nonmovant on the seventh\n\nday before the hearing, thus requiring the nonmovant’s response to depend upon\n\nleave of the court. This would be untenable under our summary judgment\n\npractice.”).\n\n      For these reasons, the trial court abused its discretion by entering summary\n\njudgment based upon new evidence that was not supported by good cause and that\n\nunduly prejudiced Starbranch. Accordingly, the attorneys’ fee award should be\n\nreversed and the case should be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n   F. The trial court granted more relief than was requested in Crowell’s\n      Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees.\n\n      A “motion for summary judgment must itself state specific grounds on\n\nwhich judgment is sought.” McConnell v. Southside Independent School Dist., 858\n\nS.W.2d 337, 339 (Tex. 1993). “The motion for summary judgment must stand or\n\nfall on the grounds it specifically and expressly sets forth.” Id. “[A] summary\n\njudgment cannot be sustained on a ground not specifically set forth in the motion.”\n\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\fId. “[A] literal reading of Rule 166a(c) and [other] authorities indicate that the\n\nmotion itself must state the grounds.” Id. (bold in original).\n\n      In other words, a movant may not file supplemental evidence to amend her\n\nmotion for summary judgment or to raise new and independent summary-judgment\n\ngrounds. Cf. McConnell, 858 S.W.2d at 339 (“When a motion for summary\n\njudgment asserts grounds A and B, it cannot be upheld on grounds C and D, which\n\nwere not asserted, even if the summary judgment proof supports them and the\n\nresponding party did not except to the motion.”); Highland Capital Management,\n\nL.P. v. Ryder Scott Co., 402 S.W.3d 719, 740 n.12 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2012, no pet.) (“A movant is not entitled to use its reply to amend its motion\n\nfor summary judgment or to raise new and independent summary-judgment\n\ngrounds.”).\n\n      In her motion for summary judgment on attorneys’ fees, Crowell specifically\n\nsought $71,354.80 because, “[a]s outlined in Mr. Shely’s affidavit, $71,354.80 is a\n\nreasonable fee given the actions of Starbranch and other defendants after Ms.\n\nCrowell purchased property intended for her home and other development.” CR\n\n370-71. This amount represented the fees allegedly incurred by Crowell between\n\nFebruary 28, 2013, and October 1, 2014. CR 386-479. Crowell’s motion did not\n\nexpressly seek the recovery of any other attorneys’ fees incurred by Crowell. CR\n\n366-72.\n\n\n                                          47\n\f       Without demonstrating good cause,15 Crowell filed her Motion to Consider\n\nthe Supplemental Affidavit after the submission date for the summary judgment\n\nmotion. Compare CR836-63 and 1st Supp. CR3-6 with CR722-23. As expressly\n\nacknowledged by Crowell, she filed her Motion to Consider the Supplemental\n\nAffidavit to raise new and independent summary judgment grounds that she had\n\nnot presented in her summary judgment motion. CR834-35. Crowell submitted\n\nthe supplement to the affidavit of John B. Shely to the trial court because:\n\n       [It] describes additional fees incurred by Ms. Crowell in connection\n       with the pending motions on summary judgment as to attorneys’ fees\n       and for work performed on other litigation activities related solely to\n       Defendant Dr. Eileen K. Starbranch since November 1, 2014. These\n       fees are not included in the pending filings.\n\n       Consideration of the Supplement will allow the Court to\n       simultaneously evaluate the most recent attorneys’ fees incurred by\n       Ms. Crowell along with those previously submitted and will promote\n       judicial efficiency in resolving matters currently before the Court.\n\n       CR834-35 (bold and italics added for emphasis).\n\nAccording to Crowell’s lead counsel, the attorneys’ fees incurred since November\n\n1, 2014, totaled $19,345.50. 1st Supp. CR3-6. The trial court awarded most of\n\nthese fees (i.e., $19,245.50) even though they entailed a new and independent\n\nground for summary judgment that had not been sought in Crowell’s initial\n\n\n\n15\n  Carpenter, 98 S.W.3d at 686 (“Our rules . . . provide that a trial court may permit an act to be\ndone after a period prescribed in other procedural rules upon a showing of ‘good cause.’ Tex.

Compare CR366-480 with CR836-63 and 1st Supp.\n\nCR3-6.\n\n      The trial court erred by awarding $19,245.50 which was never specifically\n\nrequested in Crowell’s summary judgment motion.          Tex. R. Civ. P. 166a(c);\n\nHourani v. Katzen, 305 S.W.3d 239, 255 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009,\n\npet. denied) (“A trial court errs in granting more relief than was requested” in the\n\nsummary judgment motion); LaGoye v.

(“a trial court\n\ncannot grant more relief than was requested by a motion for summary judgment”).\n\n       “When, as here, a trial court grants more relief by summary judgment than\n\nrequested, by disposing of issues never presented to it, the interests of judicial\n\neconomy demand that [this Court] reverse and remand as to those issues, but\n\naddress the merits of the properly presented claims.” Positive Feed, Inc. v.\n\nGuthmann, 4 S.W.3d 879, 881 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.).\n\nAccordingly, this Court should reverse and remand as to $19,245.50 which was\n\nnever specifically requested in Crowell’s summary judgment motion.\n\n                            CONCLUSION AND PRAYER\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, Starbranch respectfully requests that the Court\n\nreverse the district court’s judgment and render judgment that Crowell take nothing\n\non her claim for attorneys’ fees under the Declaratory Judgments Act.\n\n\n                                        49\n\f      Alternatively, Starbranch requests that the Court modify the judgment to\n\ndismiss the claim for declaratory relief and remand for a new trial on attorneys’\n\nfees.

Purchaser appealed.\n\n\n\nHoldings: The Court of Appeals, Terry Jennings, J., held that:\n\n[1] abstract judgment recorded after vendor sold real property to purchaser could not have created\nlien on real property, as required to support claim for slander of title;\n\n[2] wife did not willfully and intentionally interfere with purchaser's subsequent attempt to sell\nhouse, as required to support claim for tortious interference with contract; and\n\n[3] action for declaratory judgment that abstract of judgment “had no force or effect on property,”\nwas one for removal of cloud on property for which attorney fees were not available.\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In three issues, Wise contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\nsupport the trial court's judgment and the trial court erred in denying her request for attorney's fees.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n\n\n                                                 Background\n\nIn her third amended petition, Wise alleged that on or about July 6, 2010, she purchased from\nWarren Clay Fry a piece of property located at 20210 Pittsford, Katy, Harris County, Texas 77450\n(the “Pittsford Property”). In connection with the transaction, Wise performed a title search, which\nshowed that the property was unencumbered. Following her purchase, Wise renovated the Pittsford\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     3\n\fWise v. Conklin, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2015)\n2015 WL 1778612\n\nProperty and received an offer to buy the property. As Wise and her buyers prepared to close\nthe transaction, the title company discovered that Fry's ex-wife, Conklin, had filed an Abstract of\nJudgment against Fry approximately one month after Wise had purchased the Pittsford Property.\nAccording to Wise, the abstract affected her ability to transfer the property to her buyers because\nit clouded her title. Wise attempted to resolve the title issue with Conklin and her attorney, Patrick\nO'Fiel. However, Conklin refused to “release the property.” Because of the “cloud on the title,”\nWise suffered damages, including loss of a sale, lost business opportunities, lost profits, and\nexpenses in maintaining the property. Wise sought removal of the alleged cloud from the title,\ndamages for slander of title and tortious interference with a contract, and attorney's fees.\n\nAt trial, Wise testified that she entered into a contract to purchase the Pittsford Property from\nFry for $86,000.00. The title company checked the property's title and determined “there were\nno encumbrances, no liens, and the property was free and clear.” Fry executed and recorded the\ndeed, which transferred the property to Wise on July 23, 2010. Following her purchase, Wise\nrenovated the Pittsford Property with the help of her construction superintendent, Michael Dunn.\nIn connection with the renovations, she incurred expenses of $62,104.59, plus $20,500.00 for\nDunn's services and expenses. Subsequently, she entered into a contract to sell the property to\nJohn Lawrence and Aline Morales Packard for the purchase price of $206,500.00. She stood to\nmake a profit of $37,895.41 on the sale.\n\nWise, however, could not close the sale with Lawrence and Packard because “the title was ...\ncloudy” due to the Abstract of Judgment recorded on August 19, 2010 by Conklin. The abstract\nstated that Conklin had received a judgment against Fry for $375,609.50 on November 12, 2009. 1\n\n *2 Upon learning of the abstract, Wise and Dunn attempted to contact Conklin and O'Fiel to\nexplain their problem with selling the Pittsford Property. Conklin told Wise that “she would do\nnothing to help.” And O'Fiel told Wise that “he could do nothing” and “his client [Conklin] refused\nto release the lien.”\n\nOn October 26, 2010, Wise wrote a letter to Conklin and O'Fiel explaining that she could not sell\nthe Pittsford Property to Lawrence and Packard because of the “clouded title” and requesting that\nthey “please lift th[e] cloud.” She received no response. On November 29, 2010, Wise's attorney\nsent, by certified mail to O'Fiel, a letter in which she explained that the abstract “resulted in\nclouding ... Wise's title to th[e] property” and caused Wise to lose her sale of the property “because\nthe title company refused to issue title insurance.” Wise's attorney requested that Conklin sign a\n“Partial Release of Abstract of Judgment for ... Wise's property.” O'Fiel did not respond. Wise\nstated that she did not know why Conklin would not release the abstract and could not “get into\n[her] mind to know that” but opined that Conklin felt “[r]etaliation against the house” and “anger.”\n\n\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Six or seven months\nafter the entry of that judgment, O'Fiel filed the Abstract of Judgment. He subsequently received a\ntelephone call from “somebody” asking about the abstract and for a release of it. O'Fiel looked into\nthe matter, but did not release the abstract. O'Fiel admitted to receiving Wise's personal letter and\nher attorney's letter, with a proposed Partial Release of the Abstract of Judgment, and stated that he\nhad been notified by “[s]omebody ... claim[ing] that a title company would not issue [a] policy.”\n\nFinally, Lennon Wright, Wise's trial attorney, testified that his rate is $350.00 per hour and Wise\nhad incurred $1,750.00 in reasonable and necessary attorney's fees related to the removal of cloud\nfrom title.\n\nThe trial court rendered a take-nothing judgment against Wise on her claims for slander of title\nand tortious interference with a contract. And it issued findings of fact and conclusions of law.\nThe trial court did not award Wise attorney's fees related to her action to remove a cloud from the\ntitle, upon which the court had previously granted Wise summary judgment.\n\n\n\n                                           Sufficiency of Evidence\n\nIn her first issue, Wise argues that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to support the\ntrial court's finding and conclusion of law that Conklin did not commit slander of title because\n“[t]he refusal to release a lien created by an abstracted judgment on a homestead which results in\na loss of a sale can constitute a slander of title.” In her third issue, Wise argues that the evidence\nis legally and factually insufficient to support the trial court's conclusion of law that Conklin did\nnot tortiously interfere with her contract to sell the Pittsford Property to Lawrence and Packard\nbecause she “entered into a valid earnest money contract for the sale of the property,” Conklin “had\nactual knowledge of ... the contract that existed between [Wise] and the purchasers [and] ... a clear\ncut indication about what would happen if she continued to refuse to release the lien,” Conklin's\n“refusal to release the Abstract of Judgment was the proximate cause of [Wise's] damages,” and\nWise “sustained damage” by losing the sale of the property.\n\n *3 In an appeal from a judgment rendered after a trial to the court, the trial court's findings of\nfact have the same weight as a jury's verdict, and we review the legal and factual sufficiency\nof the evidence supporting them, just as we would review a jury's findings.

Conklin, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2015)\n2015 WL 1778612\n\nthat the abstracted judgment clouded [her] title and made it impossible for her to sell” the Pittsford\nProperty.\n\nTo recover in an action for slander of title, a party must allege and prove: (1) uttering and publishing\nof disparaging words; (2) falsity; (3) malice; (4) special damages; (5) possession of an estate or\ninterest in the property disparaged; and (6) the loss of a specific sale. SeeWilliams v. Jennings,\n755 S.W.2d 874, 879 (Tex.App.–Houston [14th Dist.] 1988, writ denied). In her brief, Wise only\naddresses the last element, loss of a specific sale. Notably absent from her brief is any discussion,\nanalysis, argument, or supporting authorities addressing the other necessary five elements of her\nslander of title claim.\n\n *4 A party that raises a legal-sufficiency challenge to a finding on an issue on which she bears the\nburden proof must demonstrate that the evidence conclusively establishes all vital facts to support\nthe issue. SeeDow Chem., 46 S.W.3d at 241. And a party challenging the factual sufficiency of a\nfinding regarding an issue on which she has the burden of proof must demonstrate that the adverse\nfinding is against the great weight and preponderance of the evidence. See id. By not offering any\ndiscussion, analysis, argument, or supporting authorities related to all of the required elements of\nher slander of title claim, Wise cannot maintain her legal and factual-sufficiency challenges.\n\nFurther, an appellant's brief must contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions made\nwith appropriate citations to authorities and to the record. TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i). A failure\nto provide substantive analysis of an issue or cite appropriate authority waives the complaint.\nSeeRichard v. Cornerstone Constructors, Inc., 921 S.W.2d 465, 469 (Tex.App.–Houston [1st\nDist.] 1996, writ denied). Accordingly, we hold that Wise has waived her challenge to the trial\ncourt's finding of fact and conclusion of law that Conklin did not commit slander of title. SeeTEX.\nR. APP. P. 38.1(i); Fredonia State Bank v. Gen. Am. Life Ins. Co., 881 S.W.2d 279, 284–85\n(Tex.1994) (appellate court may deem points of error waived due to inadequate briefing).\n\n[2] Moreover, we note that the basis for Wise's slander of title claim is fundamentally flawed.\nWise asserts that Conklin's “refusal to release the lien created by [the] abstracted judgment ...\nwhich result[ed] in a loss of a sale” of the Pittsford Property constitutes slander of title. However,\nthe filing of the Abstract of Judgment by Conklin did not place a lien on the Pittsford Property. 2\n\nA properly recorded and indexed abstract of judgment creates a lien on a judgment debtor's real\nproperty that is located in the county in which the abstract is recorded and indexed. TEX. PROP.\nCODE ANN.. § 52.001 (Vernon Supp. 2014). Thus, once a judgment in favor of a judgment\ncreditor has been secured, the creditor may wish to record an abstract of judgment in order to\ncreate a lien to attach to the judgment debtor's real property and to provide notice to subsequent\npurchasers and encumbrancers of the existence of the judgment against the debtor and the lien. See\nid.; Noble Mortg. & Invs., LLC v. D & M Vision Invs., LLC, 340 S.W.3d 65, 81 (Tex.App.–Houston\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Nix Trust, 126 S.W.3d 242, 247 (Tex.App.–San\nAntonio 2003, pet. denied).\n\nNotably, however, the recording and indexing of a judgment creditor's abstract of judgment only\nimpacts real property owned by the judgment debtor. SeeTEX. PROP. CODE ANN.. § 52.001\n(duly recorded abstract of judgment “constitutes a lien on the real property of the defendant located\nin the county in which the abstract is recorded and indexed” (emphasis added)); First State Bank\nv. Jones, 107 Tex. 623, 183 S.W. 874, 876 (1916); Gaona v. Gonzales, 997 S.W.2d 784, 786\n(Tex.App.–Austin 1999, no pet.); Ferguson v. Kuehn, 246 S.W. 674, 675–76 (Tex.Civ.App.–\nAustin 1922, no writ). In other words, the recording and indexing of an abstract of judgment\nwill not attach a lien to a property unless it is actually owned by the judgment debtor at the time\nof the abstract's recording. SeeSmith v. Sumeer Homes, Inc., No. 05–11–01632–CV, 2013 WL\n2467252, at *3–5 (Tex.App.–Dallas June 6, 2013, pet. denied) (mem. op.); Gamer v.

Donald, 286 S.W.2d 260, 263 (Tex.Civ.App.–Beaumont 1955, no writ)\n(when judgment abstracted only after judgment debtor conveyed property to another individual,\njudgment did not create lien on property). Thus, in order to determine whether an abstract of\njudgment creates a lien on a particular piece of real property, it is imperative to determine who\nowned the property at the time the abstract was recorded. SeeGaona, 997 S.W.2d at 786.\n\n *5 Here, Conklin's divorce attorney, O'Fiel, testified that as a result of divorce proceedings\nbetween Conklin and Fry, the previous owner of the Pittsford Property, Conklin secured a\njudgment of approximately $375,000.00 against Fry on November 12, 2009. Six or seven months\nafter entry of that judgment, O'Fiel filed the Abstract of Judgment August 19, 2010.\n\nThere is no evidence, and Wise does not argue, that she was involved in the Conklin–Fry divorce\nproceedings or the judgment obtained by Conklin in those proceedings was against anyone other\nthan Fry. Also, it is undisputed that the Abstract of Judgment was not recorded until after Fry\nhad sold the Pittsford Property and Wise had become its owner. Given these circumstances, the\nAbstract of Judgment could not, as a matter of law, have created a lien on the Pittsford Property or\naffected it in any way. SeeSmith, 2013 WL 2467252, at *3–5 (abstract of judgment cannot create\nlien on property not actually owned by judgment debtor at time of recording); Pacific Fin., 286\nS.W.2d at 263 (where judgment abstracted after judgment debtor conveyed property to another,\njudgment did not create lien on property); Gamer, 41 S.W.2d at 359 (abstract of judgment cannot\nrelate back and create lien on property no longer owned by judgment debtor at time of filing);\nFirst Nat'l Bank of McAllen v.

SeeLeslie v. W. Steel Co., 202 F.Supp.\n27, 28 (S.D.Tex.1962) (applying Texas law and explaining, “[t]he holder of a judgment has an\ninherent right to have h[er] judgment abstracted and recorded, and there is no duty of the holder of\nsuch judgment to issue any release to parties owning land who are not mentioned in said abstract\njudgment”). While it is unfortunate that the title company, utilized by Wise and her buyers for the\nattempted sale of the Pittsford Property, did not understand that the Abstract of Judgment had no\neffect on the Pittsford Property, blame cannot be placed on Conklin for this misunderstanding.\n\nWe overrule Wise's first issue.\n\n\nTortious Interference\n [3] Wise next asserts that she “has satisfied each required element” of her claim for tortious\ninterference with a contract.\n\nTo establish a cause of action for tortious interference, a plaintiff must prove that (1) a contract\nsubject to interference exists; (2) the defendant committed a willful and intentional act of\ninterference with the contract; (3) the act proximately caused injury; and (4) the plaintiff sustained\nactual damages or loss. ACS Invs., Inc. v. McLaughlin, 943 S.W.2d 426, 430 (Tex.1997). Because\nit is dispositive, we focus on Conklin's alleged willful and intentional act of interference.\n\n *6 Interference is tortious only if it is intentional. SeeSouthwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. John Carlo\nTex., Inc., 843 S.W.2d 470, 472 (Tex.1992). The intent required is the intent to interfere, not just\nintent to do the particular act done. See id. To establish a willful and intentional act of interference,\nthere must be evidence that a party was more than a willing participant; it must knowingly induce\none of the contracting parties to breach its obligations. SeeBrowning–Ferris, Inc. v. Reyna, 865\nS.W.2d 925, 927 (Tex.1993); Funes v. Villatoro, 352 S.W.3d 200, 213 (Tex.App.–Houston [14th\nDist.] 2011, pet. denied).\n\nHere, Wise asserts that “the evidence is convincing that [she] made clear to Conklin and her\nattorney that she was going to lose the sale of the Pittsford [Property], which was under contract,\nif the property was not released from the abstract .... [and] Conklin acted maliciously towards her\nby intentionally refusing to execute a release of lien on property to which [Conklin] had no right,\ntitle or interest.”\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Conklin, Not Reported in S.W.3d (2015)\n2015 WL 1778612\n\n\n\nThe evidence presented at trial, however, does not establish that Conklin acted with the requisite\nintent in refusing to release the Abstract of Judgment. O'Fiel, Conklin's divorce attorney, testified\nthat he filed the Abstract of Judgment six or seven months after Conklin had obtained a judgment\nagainst Fry. He subsequently received a call from “somebody” asking about the abstract and\nwhether he would release it. O'Fiel ultimately did not “take any actions to release the Abstract of\nJudgment” and did not “intend[ ] to release [it].” As he explained:\n\n            After I realized that the abstract was filed after [Fry] sold [the Pittsford Property],\n            it didn't really make a whole lot of sense of why somebody would need a release\n            of an abstract that doesn't affect the property. It just didn't make any sense.... I\n            didn't know the details. All I know is I get calls from these people that I've never\n            met before that have never had any involvement with me stating that they want\n            something that I couldn't understand why they needed it, because it didn't affect\n            their property anymore.\n\nAlthough O'Fiel stated that he had been notified by “somebody ... claim[ing] that a title company\nwould not issue [a] policy,” he noted that he thought the title company could make “an exception”\nand he did not know “how far they [went] with the policy.” Further, “[a]fter [his] conversation\nwith the title company, [he did not] recall any other communications with them,” therefore, as far\nas he knew, “they could have figured out a way” around the alleged title problem. We hold that\nO'Fiel's testimony does not establish a willful and intentional act of interference with a contract\nby Conklin.\n\nFurther, we note that Wise did not call Conklin as a witness, and Wise, herself, testified that she did\nnot know why Conklin did not release the Abstract of Judgment and could not “get into [Conklin's]\nmind to know that.” This evidence does not show a “willful and intentional act of interference.”\nSeeACS Invs., 943 S.W.2d at 430.\n\nWe conclude that the trial court correctly applied the law to the facts of the case. Accordingly,\nwe hold that the trial court did not err in concluding that Conklin did not tortiously interfere with\nWise's contract. SeeBMC Software, 83 S.W.3d at 794.\n\nWe overrule Wise's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                 Attorney's Fees\n\n[4] In her second issue, Wise argues that the trial court erred in not awarding her attorney's fees\nbecause she “filed this suit as a Declaratory Judgment action in order to remove the cloud on the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

CODE ANN.. § 37.009 (Vernon 2008) (“In any proceeding\nunder this chapter, the court may award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney's fees as are\nequitable and just.”). Because the grant or denial of attorney's fees is within the sound discretion\nof the trial court, its judgment will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear showing\nthat it abused its discretion.

It is Wise's burden\nto bring a record showing that the trial court abused its discretion. SeeSimon v. York Crane &\nRigging Co., 739 S.W.2d 793, 795 (Tex.1987).\n\nIn her petition, Wise labeled her suit to remove “cloud” from the Pittsford Property's title as a\ndeclaratory judgment action, and she sought a declaration that “the abstract of [judgment had] no\nforce and effect against” the property. Wise moved for partial summary judgment on this claim,\nwhich the trial court granted. She did not move for summary judgment on her attorney's fees claim.\nAt trial, Wright, Wise's attorney, testified that his rate is $350.00 per hour and he incurred a total\nof $1,750.00 in reasonable and necessary attorney's fees related to the removal of cloud from title.\n\nAlthough Wise asserts that she is entitled to attorney's fees under the UDJA, “[a] declaratory\njudgment action may not be used solely to obtain attorney's fees that are not otherwise authorized\nby statute or to settle disputes already pending before a court.” Southwestern Guar.

(the Association) sued one of its property\nowners, Willie McGlown, Jr., for his failure to timely pay assessments levied against him. The\ntrial court granted the Association's motion for summary judgment, and awarded actual damages\nand attorney's fees. McGlown, proceeding pro se, appeals, contending that the trial court erred in\ngranting summary judgment because contested issues remain for trial. We agree and reverse.\n\n\n\n                                                Background\n\nThe Association Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (declaration) of Ashford\nPark requires each lot owner to pay assessments imposed by the board of directors of the\nAssociation. The declaration, as well as Texas statute, allows the Association to charge a lot owner\ninterest, late charges, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees if that owner does not timely pay an\nassessment. The declaration also reserves to the Association a continuing lien against the lot to\nsecure any outstanding assessments. According to the Association's pleadings, McGlown failed\nto pay his homeowners' assessment, amounting to more than $2,144.75, including interest, costs,\nand attorney's fees.\n\nThe Association sent a request for admissions of fact to McGlown by certified and first class mail\non or about October 13, 2006. The certified mail was returned unclaimed; the first-class mail was\nnot returned. The record reveals that, while McGlown still had legal representation, his counsel\nsought to undo the deemed admissions through a motion to strike, but the record does not contain\nany ruling on that motion.\n\nIn December 2006, the Association moved for summary judgment based on the deemed\nadmissions, an affidavit from the Association's records custodian, and an attorney's fees affidavit\nexecuted by its own attorney. In his response, McGlown challenged the validity of the deemed\nadmissions, provided a copy of correspondence showing that he had sent a $457.00 check to the\nAssociation representing the amount of the assessment plus late fees before receiving a demand\nletter for $3,646.90, and challenged the reasonableness of the attorney's fees sought.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Ashford Park Homeowners Ass'n, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2009)\n2009 WL 1635310\n\nOn April 8, 2008, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the Association, and\nawarded $1,372.50 in damages and $5,000 in attorney's fees, as well as fees for defense of the\njudgment on appeal and pre- and post-judgment interest. On May 8, 2008, McGlown filed his\n“Objections to Judgment,” in which he contended that the trial court erred in granting the attorney's\nfees award and that fact issues existed concerning whether the Association had agreed to accept\nthe tendered payment, and requested that the judgment be reversed and that “[he] be given [his]\nday in court.”\n\n\n\n                                                 Discussion\n\nStandard of Review\nMcGlown has asserted a general complaint that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.\nSee Malooly Bros. Inc. v. Napier, 461 S.W.2d 119, 121 (Tex.1970). We review a trial court's\nsummary judgment de novo. Valence Operating Co. v. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d 656, 661 (Tex.2005);\nProvident Life Accid. Ins. Co. v. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex.2003). In a traditional motion\nfor summary judgment, the movant has the burden to show that no genuine issue of material fact\nexists and that the trial court must grant a judgment as a matter of law. TEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c);\nKPMG Peat Marwick v. Harrison County Hous. Fin. Corp., 988 S.W.2d 746, 748 (Tex.1999). We\nreview the evidence in a light favorable to the nonmovant and indulge every reasonable inference\nin the nonmovant's favor. Dorsett, 164 S.W.3d at 661; Knott, 128 S.W.3d at 215;Sci. Spectrum,\nInc. v. Martinez, 941 S.W.2d 910, 911 (Tex.1997).\n\n *2 Summary judgments must stand on their own merits. M.D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor Inst. v.\nWillrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 23 (Tex.2000). The nonmovant has no burden to respond to a traditional\nsummary judgment motion unless the movant conclusively establishes its cause of action. See\nid.;Rhone-Poulenc, Inc. v. Steel, 997 S.W.2d 217, 222-23 (Tex.1999); City of Houston v. Clear\nCreek Basin Auth., 589 S.W.2d 671, 678 (Tex.1979); see also Grace v. Titanium Electrode Prods.,\nInc., 227 S.W.3d 293, 297 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.).\n\n\nDid the Association meet its burden of proof?\nThe Association's claim against McGlown is essentially one for breach of the declaration. To prove\na breach of contract cause of action, the plaintiff bears the burden to show (1) the existence of a\nvalid contract; (2) performance or tendered performance by the plaintiff; (3) breach of the contract\nby the defendant; and (4) damages sustained as a result of the breach. Valero Mkt'g & Supply Co. v.\nKalama Int'l, 51 S.W.3d 345, 351 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.). McGlown admits\nthat he failed to timely pay the 2006 assessment owed to the Association under the declaration.\nWe examine, then, whether the Association conclusively proved actual damages and attorney's\nfees as required to satisfy its summary judgment burden.\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                   3\n\fMcGlown v. Ashford Park Homeowners Ass'n, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2009)\n2009 WL 1635310\n\n\n\n\nProof of actual damages\nAs proof of actual damages, the Association provided with its summary judgment motion an\naffidavit from its records custodian, who, after making recitals to satisfy the evidentiary rule for\nbusiness records, declared that “[t]he account reflecting the maintenance charges and costs of\ncollection assessed against [McGlown's] property is attached hereto as Exhibit ‘1.’ “ Exhibit 1,\nhowever, is not attached to the record custodian's affidavit, and was not included with either the\noriginal or amended motion for summary judgment. In addition, we have reviewed the requests\nfor admission and none ask McGlown to admit the amount of actual damages sought by the\nAssociation. Aside from the reference to the omitted Exhibit 1 accounting, no evidence supports\nthe amount of actual damages awarded in the summary judgment. Resolving all doubts against the\nAssociation, therefore, we hold that it failed to meet its summary judgment burden on damages\nbecause it did not submit competent proof of them. SeeTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n\nProof of attorney's fees\nNext, we consider whether the Association's evidence supports the attorney's fees award. As a\ngeneral rule, the party seeking to recover attorney's fees carries the burden of proof. Stewart\nTitle Guar. Co. v. Sterling, 822 S.W.2d 1, 10 (Tex.1991). Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice\nand Remedies Code, which the Association invoked here, affords the party seeking fees the\npresumption that the usual and customary fees for the eligible claim are reasonable. TEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. §§ 38.001, 38.003 (Vernon 2008). This presumption, however,\nis subject to rebuttal, and McGlown has challenged the reasonableness of the Association's fee\ndemand. SeeTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN . § 38.003. In reviewing the reasonableness\nof an attorney's fees award, the court considers:\n\n   *3 (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the\n     skill required to perform the legal service properly;\n\n  (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other\n     employment by the lawyer;\n\n  (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;\n\n  (4) the amount involved and the results obtained;\n\n  (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;\n\n  (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n  (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Ashford Park Homeowners Ass'n, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2009)\n2009 WL 1635310\n\n\n  (8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent on results obtained or uncertainty of collection before\n     the legal services have been rendered.\n\nArthur Andersen & Co. v. Perry Equip. Corp., 945 S.W.2d 812, 818 (Tex.1997) (citing TEX.\nDISCIPLINARY R. PROF'L CONDUCT 1.04). The amount of attorney's fees sought also must\nbear some reasonable relationship to the amount in controversy. USAA County Mut. Ins. Co.\nv. Cook, 241 S.W.3d 93, 103 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.). Although proof of\nthe number of hours and corresponding hourly rate are not necessarily required, the trial court\ngenerally relies on evidence of hours expended and the attorney's stated hourly rate to determine\nwhether the requested fee is reasonable for the nature and extent of the services performed. McGee\nv. Deere & Co., No. 03-04-00222-CV, 2005 WL 670505, *4 (Tex.App.-Austin Mar. 24, 2005,\npet. denied) (mem.op.) (citing Collins v. Guinn, 102 S.W.3d 825, 836 (Tex.App.-Texarkana 2003,\npet. denied)).\n\nIn this case, the Association's own attorney executed the attorney's fees affidavit in support of\nits summary judgment motion. Uncontroverted testimony of an interested witness will establish\nattorney's fees sought are reasonable and necessary as a matter of law if (1) the testimony could\nreadily be contradicted if untrue; (2) the testimony is clear, direct, and positive; and (3) there are\nno circumstances tending to discredit or impeach the testimony.Rosenblatt v. Freedom Life Ins.\nCo. of Am., 240 S.W.3d 315, 321 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.)(citing Ragsdale v.\nProgressive Voters League, 801 S.W.2d 880, 882 (Tex.1990)).\n\nThe Association's attorney describes his professional experience and itemizes activities he\nidentifies as “the services that are necessary to handle a collection matter which is similar in nature\nto the above-entitled and numbered cause.”The attorney avers that “the total amount of attorney's\nfees and expenses incurred by Ashford Park Homeowners Association, Inc. in the prosecution of\nthis lawsuit is $7,620.00,” and, after reciting the reasonableness factors, opines that such sum “is\na reasonable attorney's fee and is in accordance with the attorney's fees normally and customarily\ncharged in litigation of the type now before the Court.”\n\n *4 This affidavit does not satisfy the Association's summary judgment burden. First, the affidavit\ndoes not identify the services actually performed on behalf of the Association in this lawsuit,\nitemize the hours expended, or identify the attorney's hourly rate. The absence of these objective\ncriteria prevents the affidavit from being readily controvertible.\n\nSecond, controverting evidence before the trial court bars summary judgment on the Association's\nattorney's fees claim. In his response, McGlown challenged the reasonableness of the Association's\nfee request with evidence that (1) he tendered a $457.20 check for payment of his dues, plus late\ncharges, before he was served with any documents from an attorney, including the Association's\ndemand letter, (2) the Association delayed in opening the mail containing the tendered check for\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Ashford Park Homeowners Ass'n, Inc., Not Reported in S.W.3d (2009)\n2009 WL 1635310\n\nseveral days, and (3) after an additional delay, the Association returned the check and demanded\nthe sum of $3,646.90.\n\nThe trial court's judgment awards only $5,000.00 in fees, less than the amount sought by the\nAssociation. It reflects that the trial court was duly concerned about the issue, but the court was\nnot authorized to make a fact finding at this stage. See Guity v. C.C.I. Enter. Co., 54 S.W.3d 526,\n528 (Tex.App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, no pet.). (holding that, when summary judgment record\ncontains evidence contesting reasonableness of the attorney's fees requested, trial court may not\nresolve issue on summary judgment); see also Rosenblatt, 240 S.W.3d at 321. Accordingly, we\nreverse the trial court's summary judgment on the attorney's fee award.\n\n\n\n                                                Conclusion\n\nThe Association failed to meet its summary judgment burden to conclusively prove the amount of\nactual damages and its reasonable and necessary attorney's fees. We therefore reverse the judgment\nand remand the cause for trial.\n\n\nAll Citations\n\nNot Reported in S.W.3d, 2009 WL 1635310\n\nEnd of Document                                           © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

Starbranch, in\n                            connection with a property owners’ association that\n                            was allegedly invalidly formed. CR6-25.\n\nTrial Court:                The Honorable Jeff Shadwick, 55th District Court,\n                            Harris County, Texas, cause number 2013-14192.\n\nTrial Court Proceedings:    In 2013, Crowell settled with all of the defendants,\n                            except for Starbranch. CR866-908 (App. 4). In 2015,\n                            Crowell filed her Motion for Summary Judgment on\n                            Attorneys’ Fees against Starbranch. CR366-674.\n                            Subsequently, Starbranch filed a motion to dismiss\n                            Crowell’s action for declaratory judgment arguing the\n                            claim was moot. 1st Supp. CR7-122.\n\nTrial Court’s Disposition: The trial court did not find Starbranch liable to\n                           Crowell or declare the respective rights and interests of\n                           Crowell and Starbranch. However, the trial court did\n                           grant Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\n                           Attorneys’ Fees, in part, awarding attorneys’ fees in\n                           the amount of $26,462.00 against Starbranch. CR917.\n                           The order became final and appealable on April 28,\n                           2015, when the trial court entered a final judgment\n                           denying Starbranch’s motion for reconsideration and\n                           motion to dismiss. CR1059-60.\n\n\n\n\n                                        xi\n\f                                 ISSUE PRESENTED\n\n      Did the trial court err by granting Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment\n\non Attorneys’ Fees?\n\n   A. Did the trial court err by awarding attorneys’ fees when Crowell’s claim for\n\n      declaratory relief merely duplicated the issues set forth in her action to quiet\n\n      title?\n\n   B. Did the trial court err by deciding a fact question on reasonable and\n\n      necessary attorneys’ fees that was reserved for the jury?\n\n   C. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by awarding fees that were neither\n\n      equitable nor just?\n\n   D. Did the trial court err by granting any relief to Crowell because there were\n\n      fact issues as to the amount of reasonable and necessary attorneys’ fees?\n\n   E. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by considering evidence filed after the\n\n      submission date and which Starbranch did not have the opportunity to\n\n      controvert?\n\n   F. Did the trial court err by granting more relief than was requested in\n\n      Crowell’s motion?\n\n\n\n\n                                         xii\n\f                            STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\n   A. Overview\n\n      This appeal arises from Appellee Elizabeth Howard Crowell’s suit to quite\n\ntitle and declaratory judgment action seeking the same relief. CR19-21. Crowell\n\nsued a property owners’ association, its officers and directors, and all of the\n\nassociation members, claiming the association was not properly formed. CR6-25.\n\n      Among the defendants was Appellant Eileen K. Starbranch, who was not an\n\nofficer or director but instead a mere member of the association.           CR6-25.\n\nStarbranch has never been found liable for anything, and the trial court made no\n\ndeclarations concerning the respective rights and interests of Crowell and\n\nStarbranch. CR1040 (App. 2); CR1059-60 (App. 1). Crowell’s suit to quiet title,\n\nand her duplicative declaratory judgment action, were dismissed without any\n\nfinding of liability or declaration against Starbranch. CR1040 (App. 2); CR1059-\n\n60 (App. 1).\n\n      Yet the trial court, on summary judgment, ordered Starbranch to pay\n\nCrowell $26,462.00 in attorneys’ fees. CR917 (App. 3). That order underlies\n\nStarbranch’s appeal, and the facts germane to this appeal are as follows:\n\n   B. The parties and their relationships\n\n      In March 2009, Crowell acquired over 25,000 square feet of property in the\n\nJandor Gardens subdivision with the following address: 5326 Institute Lane,\n\n\n                                         1\n\fHouston, Texas 77005 (hereinafter, the “Property”). CR75; 92. Crowell and all\n\nof the defendants, including Starbranch, are homeowners in the Jandor Gardens\n\nsubdivision. CR7-9.\n\n      In 2012, several of the homeowners in Jandor Gardens formed a property\n\nowners’ association for Jandor Gardens. CR99-124. The name of the property\n\nowners’ association was the “Jandor Gardens Association, Inc.,” a Texas nonprofit\n\ncorporation (hereinafter, the “Association”). CR100.\n\n      To form a property owners’ association, a petition committee must be\n\nformed first. Tex. Prop. Code § 204.006(a). Defendants Anna Stock, Fred Sharifi,\n\nand Wyman H. Herendeen served on the petition committee for the Association.\n\nCR154-157.     Defendant Ron Whitte incorporated the Association. CR217-21.\n\nDefendants Rick Rambo, Ron Witte, and Wyman H. Herendeen served as the\n\ninitial directors for the Association. CR101; 191; 218-219.\n\n      Starbranch did not serve as either an officer or a director for the Association.\n\nCR217-21. In addition, Starbranch did not serve on the petition committee for the\n\nAssociation.   CR154-157.     Instead, Starbranch was simply a member of the\n\nAssociation. CR755-58; 181; 211; 260; 302.\n\n      Starbranch has never asserted any interest in Crowell’s Property. CR758. In\n\nfact, Starbranch has disclaimed any and all interest in Crowell’s Property. CR758.\n\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\f      C. Neighbors ask Starbranch to execute signature pages for the\n         Association.\n\n         It was not Starbranch’s idea to form the Association. CR755-58. On or\n\nabout November 8, 2012, Starbranch was in her vehicle exiting her garage onto\n\nDora Street, one of the streets in Jandor Gardens. CR756. While doing so, about\n\nfour or five people claiming to be homeowners in Jandor Gardens stopped her and\n\nstated that they were forming the Association. CR756. They asked Starbranch to\n\nexecute one of more signature pages in connection with the Association. CR756.\n\nStarbranch executed the signature pages presented to her. CR181; 211; 260; 302.\n\n         On or about November 18, 2012, Starbranch noticed that one or more\n\nsignature pages in connection with the Association were left on her front doorstep.\n\nCR756. Starbranch picked up the document, signed where necessary, and then left\n\nthe document on her front doorstep. CR756.\n\n         Starbranch did not sign two of the instruments that Crowell sought to declare\n\nas void in the trial court. Starbranch did not sign the “Notice of Formation of\n\nPetition Committee”1 or the “Petition Pursuant to Property Code § 204.006 To\n\nCreate The Jandor Gardens Association, Inc.,” 2 which were the subjects of the first\n\nand fourth declarations sought by Crowell in her later suit to quiet title and\n\nduplicative declaratory judgment action. CR20.\n\n\n1\n    CR154-57.\n2\n    CR100-04.\n\n\n                                           3\n\f      Starbranch never proposed or circulated the instruments that created the\n\nAssociation. CR756. In addition, Starbranch did not file any instruments in the\n\nHarris County real property records in connection with the Association. CR756.\n\nIn short, Starbranch did nothing more than give her okay to the Association idea\n\nproposed by others. CR755-58.\n\n   D. Crowell files suit.\n\n      In her Original Petition, Crowell asserted an action to quiet title against all\n\nof the defendants, including Starbranch, wherein she alleged as follows:\n\n      the documents filed by Defendants [including Starbranch] in the real\n      property records (see Harris County Clerk File Nos. 20120521806,\n      20120521807, 20120521808, 201205436661, and 2012054016216)\n      are clouds or encumbrances on Ms. Crowell’s right of ownership of\n      the Property, which affect impair Ms. Crowell's title to the Property.\n      Ms. Crowell seeks to nullify the effect of these disputed filings and\n      encumbrances. Ms. Crowell is entitled to a judgment that sets aside\n      these improper filings and removes them as clouds on her title.\n\n      CR21.\n\nCrowell sought the same the relief in her claim for declaratory relief against all of\n\nthe defendants, including Starbranch. CR19-20. On April 7, 2013, a jury trial was\n\nrequested and the jury fee was paid. CR56-58; 1093.\n\n      The following defendants did nothing more that than approve instruments\n\nprepared by the Association: Eileen K. Starbranch, George L. Parker, Eva K.\n\nParker, Garret S. Madderra, Georgia W. Hitchcock, James Carper, and Eric\n\n\n\n\n                                         4\n\fMazziotta. CR106-114; 167-185; 197-215; 246-264; 275-283; 293-302. Crowell\n\nlater dismissed each of these defendants, except for Starbranch, from the lawsuit.\n\nCR26-46; 59-61; 65-68; 72-74.\n\n      The Association was never Starbranch’s idea, and she did not oppose the\n\nrelief that Crowell sought in her action to quiet title and in her declaratory\n\njudgment action (although Starbranch did contest her liability). CR724-810. In\n\nfact, upon learning that Crowell wanted Starbranch to execute a Rescission of Real\n\nProperty Filings in connection with the Association, Starbranch voluntarily\n\nexecuted the same and filed it in the real property records. CR755-767.\n\n   E. Termination of the Association in 2013.\n\n      On June 24, 2013, Crowell filed her Motion for Summary Judgment as to\n\nLiability against several of the defendants in this lawsuit. CR75-344. In her\n\nsummary judgment motion, Crowell sought partial summary judgment on her\n\naction for declaratory judgment and her action to quiet title. CR75-344; 368.\n\n      On August 19, 2013, this Court granted Crowell’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment as to Liability against several of the defendants in the lawsuit. CR345-\n\n346. However, because Starbranch had not made an appearance in this lawsuit\n\nwhen the Motion for Summary Judgment as to Liability was filed and granted, the\n\norder granting partial summary judgment was not entered against Starbranch.\n\n\n\n\n                                         5\n\fCR722-23. Starbranch has never been found liable for anything. CR1059-60\n\n(App. 1).\n\n      On October 15, 2013, Crowell entered into a settlement agreement with the\n\nAssociation, Sarah Whiting, Ron Witte, Lawrence E. Plotsky, Rick Rambo,\n\nFrances Rambo, David D. Stock, Anna L. Stock, Wyman H. Herendeen, Mary\n\nHerendeen, Fereidoon Sharifi, Soody Sharifi, Edward G. Rizk, Billie Rizk,\n\nBenjamin Levit, Erica Levit, Walter J. Taylor, and Anita J. Taylor (the “Settling\n\nDefendants”) wherein the Settling Defendants agreed to “terminate the\n\n[Association] by filing a Certificate of Termination of a Domestic Nonprofit\n\nCorporation or Cooperative Association with the Secretary of State.” CR866-908\n\n(App. 4). On November 20, 2013, the Settling Defendants filed the Certificate of\n\nTermination as to Jandor Gardens Association, Inc. with the Texas Secretary of\n\nState. 1st Supp. CR120-22 (App. 5). In the settlement agreement, Crowell and the\n\nSettling Defendants also agreed as follows:\n\n      4. Filing of Order.\n\n      The Parties acknowledge and agree that Crowell will file a certified\n      copy of the Order signed October 8, 2013, which is attached as\n      Exhibit C, in the real property records. The Parties acknowledge and\n      agree that they have waived any right to appeal the Order.\n\n      5. Applicable Deed Restrictions.\n\n      All Parties hereto acknowledge that the 1929 deed restrictions of\n      Jandor Gardens, recorded in Volume 811, Pages 285-286 of the Deed\n\n\n                                         6\n\f       Records of Harris County, Texas, remain in effect, and all Parties\n       hereto agree to comply with the deed restrictions.\n\n       CR868 (App. 4).\n\nOn December 5, 2013, Crowell filed the trial court’s order, dated October 8, 2013,\n\nin the real property records for Harris County. CR790-94. Filing the trial court’s\n\nOctober 8, 2013, order in the real property records removed the cloud of title on\n\nthe Property that had been created by the Association. CR368.3\n\n    F. The trial court grants Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\n       Attorneys’ Fees against Starbranch.\n\n       On February 25, 2015, Crowell filed her Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nAttorney’s Fees against Starbranch seeking $71,345.80 in attorneys’ fees, incurred\n\nby Crowell between February 28, 2013, and October 1, 2014. CR366-674.

Mr. Ebaugh testified\n\nthat “it is unreasonable to assess $71,354.80 against Starbranch when Crowell’s\n\nattorneys have spent so little time prosecuting Crowell’s declaratory judgment\n\naction against Starbranch.” CR771.

CR834-63; 1st Supp. CR3-6. The Supplement to the Affidavit of John B.\n\nShely identified $19,345.506 in attorneys’ fees that Crowell had not requested in\n\nher Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees. Compare CR366-480 with\n\nCR836-63 and 1st Supp. CR3-6. Shely claimed that Crowell incurred $19,345.50\n\nin attorneys’ fees between November 3, 2014, and March 28, 2015. CR836-63; 1st\n\nSupp. CR3-6.\n\n       In her Motion to Consider the Supplemental Affidavit, Crowell stated that\n\nshe decided to submit the Supplement to the Affidavit of John B. Shely to the trial\n\ncourt because:\n\n       [It] describes additional fees incurred by Ms. Crowell in connection\n       with the pending motions on summary judgment as to attorneys’ fees\n       and for work performed on other litigation activities related solely to\n       Defendant Dr. Eileen K.

CR917 (App. 3).     Instead of declaring the\n\nrespective rights and interests of Crowell and Starbranch, the summary judgment\n\norder simply provided as follows:\n\n      Plaintiff Elizabeth Howard Crowell is awarded judgment for\n      attorneys’ fees in the amount of 26,462.00 [sic], from Defendant\n      Eileen K. Starbranch. This amount reflects the unrebutted $19,245.50\n      set out in John Shely’s April 1, 2015 affidavit and $7,116.50 awarded\n      from the amounts requested in Crowell’s February 25, 2015, motion.\n      To the extent the full amount requested by Plaintiff was not awarded,\n      this Court is sustaining the objections raised by Starbranch.\n\n      CR917 (App. 3).\n\nIn other words, the trial court reduced the amount of attorneys’ fees initially\n\nrequested on February 25, 2015, from $71,345.80 to $7,116.50. Compare CR371\n\nwith CR917 (App. 3). In addition, the trial court reduced the amount of attorneys’\n\nfees requested on April 1, 2015, from $19,345.50 to $19,245.50. Compare CR836-\n\n63 and 1st Supp. CR3-6 with CR917 (App. 3).\n\n\n\n\n                                       11\n\f   G. The trial court grants Starbranch’s motion to dismiss Crowell’s action\n      for declaratory judgment as moot.\n\n      On April 3, 2015, Starbranch filed a motion to dismiss Crowell’s claim for\n\ndeclaratory relief as moot because the Association was terminated in 2013 pursuant\n\nto a settlement agreement. 1st Supp. CR7-122. Crowell did not file a response to\n\nthis motion. On April 22, 2015, the trial court entered an interlocutory order\n\nstating “that Plaintiff Elizabeth Howard Crowell’s action for declaratory judgment\n\nthat she filed against Starbranch is dismissed because the claim is moot.” CR1040\n\n(App. 2) (underline in original).\n\n      On April 24, 2015, Starbranch filed a motion to vacate any order or\n\njudgment previously issued and to dismiss the case for want of jurisdiction. 1st\n\nSupp. CR124-26. The trial court did not rule on this motion.\n\n   H. Order and Final Judgment leads to this appeal.\n\n      On April 16, 2015, Starbranch filed an amended motion for reconsideration\n\nobjecting to the trial court’s consideration of Crowell’s late evidence filed after the\n\nsubmission date for Crowell’s summary judgment motions. CR981-1011. In her\n\namended motion for reconsideration, Starbranch identified her objections to\n\nCrowell’s late evidence and presented affidavits controverting Crowell’s late\n\nevidence. CR981-1011.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f      In Crowell’s Response to Starbranch’s Post Judgment Motions, Crowell\n\nrequested the denial of Starbranch’s amended motion for reconsideration and\n\nvarious other post-trial motions filed by Starbranch. CR1041-43. On April 28,\n\n2015, the trial court granted Crowell’s request and entered an Order and Final\n\nJudgment denying Starbranch’s amended motion for reconsideration and awarded\n\nCrowell “attorneys’ fees in the amount of $26,462.00 from Defendant Eileen K.\n\nStarbranch.” CR1059-60 (App. 1). In its Order and Final Judgment, the trial court\n\nheld as follows:\n\n      On April 6, 2015, the Court entered an order resolving Crowell’s\n      claim for declaratory relief . . .

CR1059-60 (App. 1). Finally, the trial court made the\n\nfollowing statement in its Order and Final Judgment:\n\n      The Court has considered Starbranch’s objections and took them into\n      account in carefully reviewing the subject attorneys’ fees. The Court\n      eliminated requested fees that were not segregated or were related\n      solely to parties other than Starbranch. Fees were awarded only for\n      causes of action which support attorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f      CR1059 (App. 1).\n\n                              SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Crowell misused the Declaratory Judgments Act by duplicating the relief she\n\nalready sought in her action to quiet title in a claim for declaratory relief. Crowell\n\nviolated the rule that a party cannot use the Declaratory Judgments Act as a vehicle\n\nto obtain otherwise impermissible attorneys’ fees. Consequently, the judgment\n\nmust be reversed and a take-nothing judgment rendered.            For several other\n\nindependent reasons, the trial court erred or abused its discretion by awarding\n\nattorneys’ fees against Starbranch.\n\n      The trial court improperly usurped the jury’s fact-finding role during a\n\nsummary-judgment proceeding. For instance, the trial court unilaterally reduced\n\nthe amount of attorneys’ fees initially requested in Crowell’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on attorneys’ fees from $71,345.80 to $7,116.50.           Accordingly, the\n\nattorneys’ fee award should be reversed and the case should be remanded to the\n\ntrial court for further proceedings.\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys’ fees that were\n\nneither equitable nor just.    The trial court awarded attorneys’ fees under the\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act before it even declared the representative rights and\n\ninterests of Crowell and Starbranch. In addition, Starbranch was not even a proper\n\nparty to Crowell’s declaratory judgment action. Finally, there is no evidence that\n\n\n                                         14\n\fStarbranch prolonged the case or prevented a complete and final resolution to this\n\ncase. For each of these independent reasons, the attorneys’ fee award should be\n\nreversed and a take nothing judgment rendered or, in the alternative, remanded to\n\nthe trial court for further proceedings.\n\n      The trial court improperly issued a summary judgment even though the\n\nsummary judgment evidence raised several genuine issues of material fact. The\n\nEbaugh Affidavit and the Starbranch Affidavit each raised genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact.   In addition, genuine issues of material fact necessarily existed\n\nbecause the trial court sustained Starbranch’s objections to Crowell’s failure to\n\nsegregate her attorneys’ fees. Finally, Crowell’s own evidence established the\n\nexistence of genuine issues of material fact.      For each of these independent\n\nreasons, the attorneys’ fee award should be reversed and the case should be\n\nremanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n      The trial court abused its discretion by considering evidence filed after the\n\nsubmission date and which Starbranch did not have the opportunity to controvert.\n\nTwo days after the submission date on her Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nAttorneys’ Fees, Crowell filed new evidence supporting a ground for summary\n\njudgment that had not been sought in Crowell’s initial summary judgment motion.\n\nBecause the motion was not supported by good cause and the new evidence unduly\n\n\n\n\n                                           15\n\fprejudiced Starbranch, the attorneys’ fee award should be reversed and the case\n\nshould be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.\n\n      The trial court improperly awarded more relief than was requested in\n\nCrowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Attorneys’ Fees. The new evidence\n\nsubmitted by Crowell two days after the submission date for the summary\n\njudgment motion entailed an independent ground for summary judgment that had\n\nnot been sought in Crowell’s summary judgment motion. Accordingly, this Court\n\nshould reverse and remand as to the attorneys’ fees which were never specifically\n\nrequested in Crowell’s summary judgment motion.\n\n                                     ARGUMENT\n\n      This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment under a de novo standard.\n\nValence Operating Co. v.

First, the Declaratory\n\n\n                                         16\n\fJudgments Act cannot be used as a vehicle to obtain otherwise impermissible\n\nattorneys’ fees. Second, the trial court improperly usurped the jury’s fact-finding\n\nrole during a summary-judgment proceeding.          Third, the summary judgment\n\nevidence raised genuine issues of material fact. Fourth, the trial court granted\n\nCrowell more relief than was requested in her Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nAttorneys’ Fees.\n\n      In addition, for at least a couple of independent reasons, the trial court\n\nabused its discretion by granting Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on\n\nAttorneys’ Fees. First, the trial court abused its discretion by awarding attorneys’\n\nfees against Starbranch under circumstances that were neither equitable nor just.\n\nSecond, the trial court abused its discretion by considering evidence filed after the\n\nsubmission date and which Starbranch did not have the opportunity to controvert.\n\n   A. The Declaratory Judgments Act cannot be used as a vehicle to obtain\n      otherwise impermissible attorneys’ fees.\n\n      Crowell has misused the Declaratory Judgments Act. Crowell duplicated the\n\nrelief she already sought in her action to quiet title via declaration. Thus, any\n\naward of attorneys’ fees for Crowell’s declaratory judgment action violates the rule\n\nthat “a party cannot use the [Declaratory Judgments Act] as a vehicle to obtain\n\notherwise impermissible attorney’s fees.” MBM Fin.

To hold otherwise\n\nwould turn the American Rule, prohibiting fee awards unless specifically provided\n\nby contract or statute, on its head. It also would put the cart before the horse by\n\nallowing a party to recover attorneys’ fees without the court first determining\n\nliability.\n\n       For these reasons, the award of attorneys’ fees was neither equitable nor just\n\nand the trial court abused its discretion in making the award. Accordingly, the\n\n\n\n\n                                          28\n\fattorneys’ fee award should be reversed and the case should be remanded to the\n\ntrial court for further proceedings.\n\n             2.

If anything, the trial court\n\nshould have awarded attorneys’ fees against Crowell for unnecessarily joining\n\nStarbranch as a party in this lawsuit, “causing her to incur fees that she otherwise\n\nwould not have had to incur.” E.g. State and Cty. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 228 S.W.3d\n\nat 411 (holing it was just and equitable to award attorneys’ fees to a party that was\n\nunnecessarily joined in a declaratory judgment action).\n\n      In her response to Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability,\n\nStarbranch asserted that she was not a proper party to Crowell’s declaratory\n\njudgment action. CR740-43. Significantly, Crowell’s evidence did not identify\n\nStarbranch as either an officer or a board member of the Association. CR 217-21.\n\nCrowell’s evidence demonstrated that Starbranch was nothing more than a member\n\nof the Association.     CR 181; 211; 260; 302. Consequently, Crowell’s own\n\nsummary-judgment evidence raised a fact issue as to whether Starbranch was a\n\nproper party to the declaratory judgment action. Starbranch also produced\n\n\n                                         29\n\fsummary-judgment evidence that raised a fact issue as to whether she was a proper\n\nparty to Plaintiff’s declaratory judgment action. CR755-62.\n\n      A property owners association, its officers, and board members are proper\n\nparties to a landowner’s claim for declaratory relief. Tex. Bus. Orgs. Code §§\n\n22.221 and 22.235. However, “[t]he members of a [nonprofit] corporation are not\n\npersonally liable for a debt, liability, or obligation of the corporation.” Tex. Bus.\n\nOrgs. Code § 22.152.      To show that she was not a proper party, Starbranch\n\nexplained in her response to Crowell’s summary judgment motions that she was\n\nnothing more than a member of the Association and that she had never asserted an\n\ninterest in the Property. CR 740-743.\n\n      In sum, it is undisputed that the Association was a nonprofit corporation.\n\nCR 100. It is undisputed that Starbranch was neither an officer nor a board\n\nmember for the property owners’ association. CR 217-21. Starbranch testified\n\nthat she had never asserted any interest in Crowell’s Property. CR 758. In fact,\n\nStarbranch disclaimed any and all interest in Crowell’s Property. CR 758.

Proc. § 5-422); 65 AM.\n\n\n                                         30\n\fJUR. 2d Quieting Title § 63 (Database updated May 2015) (“An action to quiet title\n\nlies against those who, at the time it is instituted, are the present claimants to the\n\nland under the instruments that creates the cloud.”).\n\n      In Reiner, a married couple sought declaratory relief not only against the\n\nhomeowners association but also against sixteen individual homeowners in the\n\ncommunity. Reiner , 66 A.3d. at 1134-35. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim for declaratory relief against the individual homeowners because under\n\nMaryland law the homeowners were immune from liability as long as they were\n\nacting within the scope of their duties under the homeowners’ association. Id. at\n\n1143. Under Texas law, Starbranch is similarly shielded from personal liability\n\narising out of her participation as a member in the Association at issue in this case.\n\nTex. Bus. Orgs. Code § 22.152.\n\n      This conclusion is supported by Crowell’s decision to dismiss defendants\n\nthat were similarly situated to Starbranch.        Like Starbranch, the following\n\ndefendants did nothing more that than approve instruments prepared by the petition\n\ncommittee or another representative of the Association: George L. Parker, Eva K.\n\nParker, Garret S. Madderra, Georgia W. Hitchcock, James Carper, and Eric\n\nMazziotta. CR106-114; 167-185; 197-215; 246-264; 275-283; 293-302. Crowell\n\ndismissed each of these defendants from the lawsuit, and none paid any attorneys’\n\nfees. CR26-46; 59-61; 65-68; 72-74. When Crowell dismissed these defendants\n\n\n                                         31\n\fbefore obtaining any judgment in the lawsuit, Crowell knew that they were not\n\nproper parties to a declaratory judgment action.\n\n         In addition, it is important to note that Starbranch did not even sign two of\n\nthe instruments that Crowell sought to declare as void. It is undisputed that\n\nStarbranch did not sign the “Notice of Formation of Petition Committee” 10 or the\n\n“Petition Pursuant to Property Code § 204.006 To Create The Jandor Gardens\n\nAssociation, Inc.,”11 which are the subjects of the first and fourth declarations\n\nsought in Crowell’s Motion for Summary Judgment on Liability.                  CR20.\n\nConsequently, even if she was not shielded from liability under the Texas Business\n\nOrganizations Code, Starbranch could not have been a proper party to the first and\n\nfourth declarations sought against her. After all, there can be no controversy\n\nbetween Crowell and Starbranch in connection with documents that Starbranch did\n\nnot even sign. Bonham State Bank v. Beadle, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1742324\"><a href=\"/opinion/1742324/bonham-state-bank-v-beadle/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">465</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 467 (Tex. 1995)\n\n(“To constitute a justiciable controversy, there must exist a real and substantial\n\ncontroversy involving genuine conflict of tangible interests and not merely a\n\ntheoretical dispute.”).\n\n         Viewed in the light most favorable to Starbranch, the evidence demonstrated\n\nthat Starbranch was not a proper party to the declaratory judgment action or suit to\n\nquiet title. Cf. Kennesaw Life & Accident Ins. Co, 694 S.W.2d at 118 (holding that\n\n10\n     CR154-57.\n11\n     CR100-04.\n\n\n                                           32\n\fdeclaratory judgment was inappropriate against a party in an action to remove a\n\ncloud on plaintiff’s title to real property, even though the party may have played a\n\nrole in creating the cloud, because the party had disclaimed any interest in the\n\nproperty and was not in possession of the property). Consequently, if a take-\n\nnothing judgment is not rendered, this Court should reverse the trial court's\n\njudgment awarding attorneys’ fees to Crowell and remand for trial.\n\n             3. There is no evidence that Starbranch prolonged the case or\n                prevented a complete and final resolution to this case.\n\n      The only evidence presented to the trial court regarding whether it was\n\nequitable or just to assess attorney’s fees against Starbranch was the conclusory\n\nand self-serving affidavit testimony of Crowell’s lead attorney, John B. Shely. CR\n\n386-389.\n\n      Shely testified “[f]inal resolution of the suit . . . has been drawn out by the\n\nfailure of Starbranch to file an answer for over fourteen months, despite being\n\nserved with process, and by her failure to rescind her signature to various\n\ndocuments at issue in the case.” CR 389. Nowhere does Shely testify how or why\n\nfinal resolution of the suit depended upon Starbranch’s appearance in this lawsuit\n\nor rescission of her signatures. In fact, final resolution of the suit did not depend\n\nupon whether Starbranch appeared in this suit or rescinded her signatures; it\n\ndepended on settlement with the proper parties to the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                         33\n\f      Before Starbranch even made an appearance in this suit, Crowell had already\n\nobtained all the relief that she sought through her suit to quiet title and her\n\nduplicative declaratory judgment action. CR345-46. In 2013, Crowell entered into\n\na global settlement with the Association, its officers and directors. CR866-908\n\n(App. 4).   The global settlement agreement removed all clouds of title and\n\nterminated the Association. CR866-908 (App. 4). In other words, Crowell’s claim\n\nfor declaratory relief was completely resolved in 2013 prior to Starbranch’s\n\nappearance. CR866-908 (App. 4); 1st Supp. CR 119-22; CR 790-94.\n\n      Moreover, as explained above, Starbranch has never been a proper party to\n\nthis lawsuit. See Argument C(2). Consequently, despite Crowell’s claim to the\n\ncontrary, Starbranch could not have prolonged the case or “prevent[ed] a complete\n\nand final resolution to this case.” CR371. For these reasons, Shely’s testimony is\n\nconclusory and therefore not competent summary judgment evidence. Texas\n\nDivision-Tranter v.

Ebaugh testified as follows:\n\n      [I]t is my opinion that the amount of $71,354.80 sought by Crowell\n      against Starbranch is unreasonable because Crowell has only served\n      one request for disclosure on Starbranch, has only served one request\n      for production on Starbranch, has not taken any depositions in this\n      case, and has not filed any discovery motions against Starbranch in\n      this case. Under the circumstances, it is unreasonable to assess\n      $71,354.80 against Starbranch when Crowell’s attorneys have spent\n      so little time prosecuting Crowell’s declaratory judgment action\n      against Starbranch.\n\n      CR 771.\n\nConsequently, the Ebaugh Affidavit raised a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether $71,354.80 was a reasonable and necessary fee for the prosecution of\n\nCrowell’s claim for declaratory relief against Starbranch.

The remainder of Ebaugh’s affidavit\n\ncreated additional genuine issues of material fact.

The Affidavit of Eileen K. Starbranch raised genuine issues of\n                     material fact.\n\n         In the Affidavit of John B.

Shely claims that, on July 1,\n         2013, I was served with a letter and its enclosure entitled ‘Rescission\n         of Real Property Filings.’ However, I did not receive this letter\n         inviting me to execute the ‘Rescission of Real Property Filings’ when\n         Mr. Shely claimed it was served upon me.

Genuine issues of material fact necessarily existed because the\n                trial court sustained Starbranch’s objection to Crowell’s\n                failure to segregate.\n\n      “A party seeking to recover attorney’s fees has the burden to show that the\n\nfees were reasonable and necessary which, among other things, requires the party\n\nto show the fees were incurred on a claim that allows recovery of such fees.”\n\nGoldman v.

Consequently, as\n\nacknowledged by the trial court, there was a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nhow much of the attorneys’ fees, if any, incurred by Crowell should have been\n\napportioned to her claim for declaratory relief against Starbranch.\n\n      “[T]he need to segregate attorney’s fees is a question of law, while the\n\nextent to which certain claims can or cannot be segregated is a mixed question of\n\nlaw and fact.” Ca Partners v.

Crowell’s own evidence established the existence of genuine\n               issues of material fact.\n\n      Crowell presented contradictory evidence as to the amount of reasonable and\n\nnecessary attorneys’ fees incurred by her. First, Crowell introduced the Affidavit\n\nof John B.

Compare\n\nCR366-480 with CR836-63 and 1st Supp. CR3-6. Significantly, Crowell failed to\n\ndemonstrate that her late filing of evidence was accidental instead of intentional or\n\nthe result of conscious indifference. CR836-63; 1st Supp. CR3-6.

In three issues, Wise contends that the evidence is legally and factually insufficient to\nsupport the trial court's judgment and the trial court erred in denying her request for attorney's fees.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n\n\n                                                 Background\n\nIn her third amended petition, Wise alleged that on or about July 6, 2010, she purchased from\nWarren Clay Fry a piece of property located at 20210 Pittsford, Katy, Harris County, Texas 77450\n(the “Pittsford Property”). In connection with the transaction, Wise performed a title search, which\nshowed that the property was unencumbered. Following her purchase, Wise renovated the Pittsford\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters. No claim to original U.S. Government Works.                     3\n\fWise v.

As Wise and her buyers prepared to close\nthe transaction, the title company discovered that Fry's ex-wife, Conklin, had filed an Abstract of\nJudgment against Fry approximately one month after Wise had purchased the Pittsford Property.\nAccording to Wise, the abstract affected her ability to transfer the property to her buyers because\nit clouded her title. Wise attempted to resolve the title issue with Conklin and her attorney, Patrick\nO'Fiel. However, Conklin refused to “release the property.” Because of the “cloud on the title,”\nWise suffered damages, including loss of a sale, lost business opportunities, lost profits, and\nexpenses in maintaining the property. Wise sought removal of the alleged cloud from the title,\ndamages for slander of title and tortious interference with a contract, and attorney's fees.\n\nAt trial, Wise testified that she entered into a contract to purchase the Pittsford Property from\nFry for $86,000.00. The title company checked the property's title and determined “there were\nno encumbrances, no liens, and the property was free and clear.” Fry executed and recorded the\ndeed, which transferred the property to Wise on July 23, 2010. Following her purchase, Wise\nrenovated the Pittsford Property with the help of her construction superintendent, Michael Dunn.\nIn connection with the renovations, she incurred expenses of $62,104.59, plus $20,500.00 for\nDunn's services and expenses. Subsequently, she entered into a contract to sell the property to\nJohn Lawrence and Aline Morales Packard for the purchase price of $206,500.00. She stood to\nmake a profit of $37,895.41 on the sale.\n\nWise, however, could not close the sale with Lawrence and Packard because “the title was ...\ncloudy” due to the Abstract of Judgment recorded on August 19, 2010 by Conklin. The abstract\nstated that Conklin had received a judgment against Fry for $375,609.50 on November 12, 2009. 1\n\n *2 Upon learning of the abstract, Wise and Dunn attempted to contact Conklin and O'Fiel to\nexplain their problem with selling the Pittsford Property. Conklin told Wise that “she would do\nnothing to help.” And O'Fiel told Wise that “he could do nothing” and “his client [Conklin] refused\nto release the lien.”\n\nOn October 26, 2010, Wise wrote a letter to Conklin and O'Fiel explaining that she could not sell\nthe Pittsford Property to Lawrence and Packard because of the “clouded title” and requesting that\nthey “please lift th[e] cloud.” She received no response. On November 29, 2010, Wise's attorney\nsent, by certified mail to O'Fiel, a letter in which she explained that the abstract “resulted in\nclouding ...

Six or seven months\nafter the entry of that judgment, O'Fiel filed the Abstract of Judgment. He subsequently received a\ntelephone call from “somebody” asking about the abstract and for a release of it. O'Fiel looked into\nthe matter, but did not release the abstract. O'Fiel admitted to receiving Wise's personal letter and\nher attorney's letter, with a proposed Partial Release of the Abstract of Judgment, and stated that he\nhad been notified by “[s]omebody ... claim[ing] that a title company would not issue [a] policy.”\n\nFinally, Lennon Wright, Wise's trial attorney, testified that his rate is $350.00 per hour and Wise\nhad incurred $1,750.00 in reasonable and necessary attorney's fees related to the removal of cloud\nfrom title.\n\nThe trial court rendered a take-nothing judgment against Wise on her claims for slander of title\nand tortious interference with a contract.

However,\nthe filing of the Abstract of Judgment by Conklin did not place a lien on the Pittsford Property. 2\n\nA properly recorded and indexed abstract of judgment creates a lien on a judgment debtor's real\nproperty that is located in the county in which the abstract is recorded and indexed.

All I know is I get calls from these people that I've never\n            met before that have never had any involvement with me stating that they want\n            something that I couldn't understand why they needed it, because it didn't affect\n            their property anymore.\n\nAlthough O'Fiel stated that he had been notified by “somebody ... claim[ing] that a title company\nwould not issue [a] policy,” he noted that he thought the title company could make “an exception”\nand he did not know “how far they [went] with the policy.” Further, “[a]fter [his] conversation\nwith the title company, [he did not] recall any other communications with them,” therefore, as far\nas he knew, “they could have figured out a way” around the alleged title problem. We hold that\nO'Fiel's testimony does not establish a willful and intentional act of interference with a contract\nby Conklin.\n\nFurther, we note that Wise did not call Conklin as a witness, and Wise, herself, testified that she did\nnot know why Conklin did not release the Abstract of Judgment and could not “get into [Conklin's]\nmind to know that.” This evidence does not show a “willful and intentional act of interference.”\nSeeACS Invs., 943 S.W.2d at 430.\n\nWe conclude that the trial court correctly applied the law to the facts of the case. Accordingly,\nwe hold that the trial court did not err in concluding that Conklin did not tortiously interfere with\nWise's contract. SeeBMC Software, 83 S.W.3d at 794.\n\nWe overrule Wise's third issue.\n\n\n\n                                                 Attorney's Fees\n\n[4] In her second issue, Wise argues that the trial court erred in not awarding her attorney's fees\nbecause she “filed this suit as a Declaratory Judgment action in order to remove the cloud on the\n\n\n              © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

(the Association) sued one of its property\nowners, Willie McGlown, Jr., for his failure to timely pay assessments levied against him. The\ntrial court granted the Association's motion for summary judgment, and awarded actual damages\nand attorney's fees. McGlown, proceeding pro se, appeals, contending that the trial court erred in\ngranting summary judgment because contested issues remain for trial. We agree and reverse.\n\n\n\n                                                Background\n\nThe Association Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (declaration) of Ashford\nPark requires each lot owner to pay assessments imposed by the board of directors of the\nAssociation. The declaration, as well as Texas statute, allows the Association to charge a lot owner\ninterest, late charges, costs, and reasonable attorney's fees if that owner does not timely pay an\nassessment. The declaration also reserves to the Association a continuing lien against the lot to\nsecure any outstanding assessments. According to the Association's pleadings, McGlown failed\nto pay his homeowners' assessment, amounting to more than $2,144.75, including interest, costs,\nand attorney's fees.\n\nThe Association sent a request for admissions of fact to McGlown by certified and first class mail\non or about October 13, 2006. The certified mail was returned unclaimed; the first-class mail was\nnot returned. The record reveals that, while McGlown still had legal representation, his counsel\nsought to undo the deemed admissions through a motion to strike, but the record does not contain\nany ruling on that motion.\n\nIn December 2006, the Association moved for summary judgment based on the deemed\nadmissions, an affidavit from the Association's records custodian, and an attorney's fees affidavit\nexecuted by its own attorney. In his response, McGlown challenged the validity of the deemed\nadmissions, provided a copy of correspondence showing that he had sent a $457.00 check to the\nAssociation representing the amount of the assessment plus late fees before receiving a demand\nletter for $3,646.90, and challenged the reasonableness of the attorney's fees sought.\n\n\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.

In addition, we have reviewed the requests\nfor admission and none ask McGlown to admit the amount of actual damages sought by the\nAssociation. Aside from the reference to the omitted Exhibit 1 accounting, no evidence supports\nthe amount of actual damages awarded in the summary judgment. Resolving all doubts against the\nAssociation, therefore, we hold that it failed to meet its summary judgment burden on damages\nbecause it did not submit competent proof of them. SeeTEX.R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n\nProof of attorney's fees\nNext, we consider whether the Association's evidence supports the attorney's fees award. As a\ngeneral rule, the party seeking to recover attorney's fees carries the burden of proof. Stewart\nTitle Guar. Co. v.

Chapter 38 of the Texas Civil Practice\nand Remedies Code, which the Association invoked here, affords the party seeking fees the\npresumption that the usual and customary fees for the eligible claim are reasonable. TEX. CIV.\nPRAC. & REM.CODE ANN. §§ 38.001, 38.003 (Vernon 2008). This presumption, however,\nis subject to rebuttal, and McGlown has challenged the reasonableness of the Association's fee\ndemand. SeeTEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM.CODE ANN . § 38.003. In reviewing the reasonableness\nof an attorney's fees award, the court considers:\n\n   *3 (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the\n     skill required to perform the legal service properly;\n\n  (2) the likelihood that the acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other\n     employment by the lawyer;\n\n  (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services;\n\n  (4) the amount involved and the results obtained;\n\n  (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the circumstances;\n\n  (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client;\n\n  (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and\n\n\n             © 2015 Thomson Reuters.
