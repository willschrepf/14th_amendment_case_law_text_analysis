Indeed, the improvement of a school site would seem to be involved necessarily in the general act of providing schoolhouses which is expressly authorized in the statute and would seem to be sufficiently broad to include every detail of providing a schoolhouse, including the preparation of the ground upon which it stands and by which it is surrounded. In the Bradbury case, the narrow construction given the word \"acquire\" was based largely upon the fact that two companion statutes, one providing for waterworks and the other for power plants, had been amended at the same time, and that in only one of them was the express power to enlarge, repair, etc., included, while in the other, such express power was not included; and it was no doubt properly considered that the inclusion of the express words in one of the statutes and their omission in the other, argued an intention to omit the power where the express language was omitted. We think the Bradbury case is thus distinguishable from the present case, and the power to improve school sites within the bonding statute does not conflict the earlier case.</p>\n<p>\"The word 'acquire' has a broad meaning, including both purchase and construction. The expression does not indicate the purpose of acquiring two systems, one by purchase, the other by construction. In connection with the context, it means the acquisition of but one system, including the purchase of such property and the erection of such structures as may be necessary to accomplish that purpose.\" <em>Clark v. City of Los</em><em>Angeles</em>, <cross_reference>160 Cal. 30</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>116 P. 722</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>729</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>As to the objection that it expressed more than one purpose, in <em>Howard v. Independent School District</em>, <cross_reference>17 Idaho 537</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>106 Pac. 692</cross_reference>, the court had under consideration a notice, in so far as it is material here, as follows; <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 808</span> </p>\n<p>\"That the proceeds from the sale of such bonds shall be devoted exclusively for the purpose of providing said district with additional schoolhouse grounds and erecting a schoolhouse thereon near the site of the present high school building in the city of Lewiston at an estimated cost of $40,000; and for the purpose of providing said district with additional schoolhouse grounds and erecting a four room schoolhouse thereon near Ninth Avenue and Twenty-sixth Street, in the city of Lewiston, at an estimated cost of $12,000 (said schoolhouse to be erected in such a manner that additional rooms may be added thereto whenever the necessities therefor may require without materially damaging such building) and for the purpose of providing said district with additional schoolhouse grounds and erecting a two room schoolhouse thereon in one of the Lewiston Orchard Tracts at an estimated cost of $3000; and for the purpose of furnishing each of said school buildings with proper and necessary furniture, apparatus and fixtures.\"</p>\n<p>In the Howard case, <em>supra</em>, the total of the bond issue was $55,000. Segregated in the notice were three items of expenditure. The court held that but one purpose was stated and that it was not necessary that each item be stated separately so that the voter could vote on each item.</p>\n<p>The use of the word \"purpose\" in sec. 3, art. 8, of the constitution was intended in the broad and general sense of whether an indebtedness over the yearly income should be incurred by the municipality or body concerned, and, of course, for the specific but general purpose indicated; but it does not seem to us that the \"purpose\" meant that a vote should be on each item of expenditure contemplated, but rather, the general \"purpose\" of borrowing money for the general purpose contemplated. Sec. 18, art. 11, of the California constitution (p. 1xxxv, Henning's General Laws of California) is similar to sec. 3, art. 8 of the Idaho constitution, and under the California constitution, a statute joining purposes for one vote is allowed. (<em>Antelope Valley Union High School District v.</em><em>McClellan</em>, <cross_reference>55 Cal.App. 244</cross_reference>, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 809</span> <cross_reference>203 P. 147</cross_reference>; <em>State ex rel. School District v. Gordon</em>,<cross_reference>223 Mo. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>122 S.W. 1008</cross_reference>.)</p>\n<p>The design of the statute was to provide that the voters should decide upon the issuance of bonds, not the items for which they should be expended. The statute in the first instance limits the purposes for which bonds may be issued by a district, and secondly, no doubt, the board would be restricted in its expenditure of the money to the purposes enumerated in the notice. The purpose requiring the consent of the voters, however, is whether bonds shall issue, not what the proceeds shall be spent on. That is already regulated by statute. Of course, the voter is entitled to know, and the statute so provides what the money is to be used for, but that is not made by statute an essential question for his consideration.</p>\n<p>In other words, school districts are limited in issuing bonds to the purposes specified but as to a bond election, the \"purpose\" is the incurring of an indebtedness as a whole to be expended as specified.</p>\n<p>As to any surplus going into the sinking fund and the general fund under sec. 57, chap. 215, 1921 Session Laws, 457, that is a matter of bookkeeping. It is true that the wording of the various statutory provisions as to the purposes for which school districts may issue bonds has been changed from legislative session to legislative session. Some are conjunctive, some are disjunctive; but the above analysis seems to us correct.</p>\n<p>In the instant case there are four items but all are germane to the one purpose &#8212; that of providing schools and equipment for the district. Mere numbers do not make inappropriate the principle of the Howard case to the case at bar; hence but one purpose was contained in the notice.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is further substantiated by <em>Corker v. Village</em><em>of Mountain Home</em>, <cross_reference>20 Idaho 32</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>116 P. 108</cross_reference>; <em>Ostrander v. City</em><em>of Salmon</em>, <cross_reference>20 Idaho 153</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>117 P. 692</cross_reference>; <em>Independent Highway</em><em>District v. Ada County</em>, <cross_reference>24 Idaho 416</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>134 P. 542</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Cary v. Blodgett</em>, <cross_reference>10 Cal.App. 463</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>102 P. 668</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>671</cross_reference>, the court said: <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 810</span> </p>\n<p>\"The duty of determining the necessity for the expenditure and the propriety of submitting it to the electors and the particular phraseology in which it shall be expressed is cast upon the trustees subject to a reasonable and practicable regard for the right and privilege of the electors to be informed as to the purposes and cost of the proposed improvement that they may exercise at the polls an intelligent and discriminating judgment as to their own interests and the public welfare.\"</p>\n<p>Within the purview of the above case, the notice in the instant case was clear though not particularly specific. But the legislature has not required that it be specific.</p>\n<p>Similar notices have been held sufficient in the following cases: <em>Parks v.

(<em>Morse v. Granite County</em>, <cross_reference>44 Mont. 78</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>119 P. 286</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>290</cross_reference>.)</p>\n<p>Plaintiff contends that the bonds may not be issued to \"move bungalows.\" Section 57, <em>supra</em>, specifically authorizes the board to \"build or provide\" one or more school houses. The legislature evidently intended by the use of the word \"provide\" to differentiate and add to the powers given by the word \"build.\" In statutes of this kind, words shall be given their usual and ordinary meaning. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 811</span> \nThe word \"provide\" is defined in Funk and Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary as follows:</p>\n<p>\"To make, procure, or furnish for future use; obtain so as to have ready or on hand when needed; prepare; to furnish with supplies or prerequisites; put into a state of preparation.\"</p>\n<p>Webster's New International Dictionary defines \"provide\" as follows:</p>\n<p>\"To foresee; to look out for in advance; to prepare; to supply; afford; contribute; to furnish; supply.\"</p>\n<p>From these definitions it is apparent that the word \"provide\" has a broad meaning sufficient to include almost any means whereby schoolhouses are made available. The question of the right of the board to move a school is not involved herein. Before a board may move a schoolhouse, such removal must be authorized by a vote of two-thirds of the district. Subdivision 10, section 46, 1921 Session Laws, 447. To provide for such purposes is in no way involved with the right to move. The question here is for what purpose the district is authorized to issue bonds under the word \"provide.\" Moving a schoolhouse or other house certainly might be one way of \"providing\" a schoolhouse.</p>\n<p>The election having been held, the statutes regulatory thereof will be held to be directory unless it appears that the failure to give proper notice or the failure to comply with some other provision of the election laws has affected the result of the election. (<em>Sizemore v. Board of County</em><em>Commissioners</em>, <cross_reference>36 Idaho 184</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>210 P. 137</cross_reference>; <em>Weisgerber v. Nez</em><em>Perce County</em>, <cross_reference>33 Idaho 670</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>197 P. 562</cross_reference>; <em>Town of Grove v.</em><em>Haskell</em>, <cross_reference>24 Okl. 707</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>104 P. 56</cross_reference>; <em>Seymour v.

St. 39, 47 P. 958.)</p>\n<p>The above holding is in harmony with and justified by sec. 16, chap. 215, 1921 Session Laws, 436.</p>\n<p>Under the above cases, the division of the district and the designation of the polling places in 1921, instead of in 1927, is not sufficient to overthrow the election even though the division should have been made for the immediate <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 812</span> \nelection rather than in some previous year. Furthermore, the stipulation of facts, together with the next to the last paragraph in the above notice, indicates that the statute with regard to dividing the district has been substantially complied with.</p>\n<p>The alternative writ heretofore issued is quashed.</p>\n<p>Costs to defendants.</p>\n<p>Budge and Taylor, JJ., and Brinck, D.J., concur.</p>\n<p>Wm.

Segregated in the notice were three items of expenditure. The court held that but one purpose was stated and that it was not necessary that each item be stated separately so that the voter could vote on each item.</p>\n<p>The use of the word \"purpose\" in sec. 3, art. 8, of the constitution was intended in the broad and general sense of whether an indebtedness over the yearly income should be incurred by the municipality or body concerned, and, of course, for the specific but general purpose indicated; but it does not seem to us that the \"purpose\" meant that a vote should be on each item of expenditure contemplated, but rather, the general \"purpose\" of borrowing money for the general purpose contemplated. Sec. 18, art. 11, of the California constitution (p. 1xxxv, Henning's General Laws of California) is similar to sec. 3, art. 8 of the Idaho constitution, and under the California constitution, a statute joining purposes for one vote is allowed.

The statute in the first instance limits the purposes for which bonds may be issued by a district, and secondly, no doubt, the board would be restricted in its expenditure of the money to the purposes enumerated in the notice. The purpose requiring the consent of the voters, however, is whether bonds shall issue, not what the proceeds shall be spent on. That is already regulated by statute. Of course, the voter is entitled to know, and the statute so provides what the money is to be used for, but that is not made by statute an essential question for his consideration.</p>\n<p>In other words, school districts are limited in issuing bonds to the purposes specified but as to a bond election, the \"purpose\" is the incurring of an indebtedness as a whole to be expended as specified.</p>\n<p>As to any surplus going into the sinking fund and the general fund under sec. 57, chap. 215, 1921 Session Laws, 457, that is a matter of bookkeeping. It is true that the wording of the various statutory provisions as to the purposes for which school districts may issue bonds has been changed from legislative session to legislative session. Some are conjunctive, some are disjunctive; but the above analysis seems to us correct.</p>\n<p>In the instant case there are four items but all are germane to the one purpose &#8212; that of providing schools and equipment for the district. Mere numbers do not make inappropriate the principle of the Howard case to the case at bar; hence but one purpose was contained in the notice.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is further substantiated by <em>Corker v.

The legislature evidently intended by the use of the word \"provide\" to differentiate and add to the powers given by the word \"build.\" In statutes of this kind, words shall be given their usual and ordinary meaning. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 811</span> \nThe word \"provide\" is defined in Funk and Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary as follows:</p>\n<p>\"To make, procure, or furnish for future use; obtain so as to have ready or on hand when needed; prepare; to furnish with supplies or prerequisites; put into a state of preparation.\"</p>\n<p>Webster's New International Dictionary defines \"provide\" as follows:</p>\n<p>\"To foresee; to look out for in advance; to prepare; to supply; afford; contribute; to furnish; supply.\"</p>\n<p>From these definitions it is apparent that the word \"provide\" has a broad meaning sufficient to include almost any means whereby schoolhouses are made available. The question of the right of the board to move a school is not involved herein. Before a board may move a schoolhouse, such removal must be authorized by a vote of two-thirds of the district. Subdivision 10, section 46, 1921 Session Laws, 447. To provide for such purposes is in no way involved with the right to move. The question here is for what purpose the district is authorized to issue bonds under the word \"provide.\" Moving a schoolhouse or other house certainly might be one way of \"providing\" a schoolhouse.</p>\n<p>The election having been held, the statutes regulatory thereof will be held to be directory unless it appears that the failure to give proper notice or the failure to comply with some other provision of the election laws has affected the result of the election.

Laws, chap. 215, secs. 15, 16, 46, 47, 47A; chaps. 185-259.)\n\nThe statute requiring the district to be divided into precincts is directory only and the failure of the board to make such division will not invalidate the election.
