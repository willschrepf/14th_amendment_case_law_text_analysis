(Audiotext)\n\nand Connections U.S.A., Inc. (Connections) appeal after a jury verdict in their\n\nfavor, alleging several errors in both the judgment and in the court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees. Defendant-Appellant U.S. Telecom, Inc. (Sprint) cross-appeals\n\nfrom the judgment against it. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and\n\n\n      *\n        This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\fwe affirm as to everything but attorney’s fees.\n\n      Audiotext and Connections are known, in telecommunications argot, as\n\ninformation providers (IPs). They offer interactive messages and live operators,\n\non a pay-per-call basis, via long distance 900 numbers. Audiotext and\n\nConnections offered sports information and psychic, astrological, dating, and\n\npornographic programs. The consumer placing calls is known as the end user.\n\nAudiotext and Connections each entered into two consecutive information\n\nprovider contracts (IP contracts) with Sprint for long-distance pay-per-call\n\nservice. Sprint, an interexchange carrier (IXC), was obliged under the contracts\n\nto carry Plaintiffs’ 900 calls over its long distance network, bill and collect\n\ncharges from the end users, and remit the monies to Plaintiffs. In return,\n\nPlaintiffs paid Sprint transport and billing and collection fees. Over the duration\n\nof the contracts, Plaintiffs paid Sprint more than $3,000,000 in service fees.\n\n      Evidence presented at trial indicated Sprint induced Plaintiffs to enter into\n\nthe contracts by representing that it could supply 900-number coverage for the\n\nwhole country, except for insignificant rural pockets where Plaintiffs were not\n\nadvertising anyway. It became apparent during the course of the contracts,\n\nhowever, that Sprint was not remitting payment to the IPs for a significant volume\n\nof calls the IPs serviced. Further evidence showed large areas of unequal\n\naccess—areas in which AT&T had the ability to bill and collect for 900 calls but\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fother carriers did not. In these areas Sprint needed to enter into a contract with\n\nthe local telephone company (LEC) and regional Bell operating company (RBOC)\n\nin order to bill to and collect from the end user. When Sprint began offering 900\n\nservice in 1989, it had no billing agreements with any LEC or RBOC. During\n\n1990 Sprint entered into billing contracts with only six of the 1200 to 1400 LECs\n\nand RBOCs in the United States. Sprint created internal reports and maps of\n\nunequal access areas, showing where it did and did not have the ability to bill and\n\ncollect for 900 calls. Although it could have opened up 900 access to its long\n\ndistance network only in areas in which it could bill for calls directly or had\n\ncontracted with a LEC and RBOC for billing services, Sprint deliberately opened\n\n900 access to calls from the entire country.\n\n      Connections entered into its first IP contract with Sprint in 1989, and\n\nAudiotext followed in 1990. Although its inability to collect and bill for unequal\n\naccess calls was well-known to Sprint, it failed to inform the IPs of the problem.\n\n      When Audiotext and Connections became aware of the substantial disparity\n\nbetween the number of calls they serviced and the number Sprint paid them for,\n\nthey brought the problem to Sprint’s attention. Sprint responded with surprise\n\nand assured Audiotext and Connections that the problem was not caused by any\n\ndeficiency on its part. When the problem persisted and Plaintiffs pursued their\n\ncomplaints, Sprint gave a variety of excuses, transferred Plaintiffs’ accounts to\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fother Sprint representatives, and released misleading reports about the non-equal\n\naccess issue.\n\n      In July 1991, Audiotext installed equipment which allowed it to recognize\n\nwhether incoming 900 number calls were accompanied by complete billing\n\ninformation, or ANI, which included the end user’s name and address. It became\n\nimmediately apparent Sprint was transporting a significant number of calls\n\nunaccompanied by ANI. For each of these calls Sprint collected from Audiotext\n\nits transport and billing fees but could not bill the end user, and so could not\n\nremit to Audiotext its charge for the call. Audiotext set up its equipment to block\n\ncalls without complete ANI, and confronted Sprint with the problem. Sprint\n\nadmitted it was unable to bill in most non-equal access areas. Connections\n\nindependently discovered the non-equal access problem in September 1991.\n\nSprint withdrew from the 900 number business within the next month.\n\n      A jury found Sprint had fraudulently induced and breached its IP contracts\n\nwith both Audiotext and Connections. The jury awarded compensatory damages\n\non all claims except Connections’ fraud claim. After a separate inquiry the jury\n\nawarded Audiotext $15,000,000 in punitive damages, but the district court\n\nreduced the amount to $2,222,368.20 pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. § 768.73 (West\n\n1996). The court refused the jury’s request for permission to change its verdict to\n\naward Connections compensatory fraud damages, and also denied Plaintiffs’\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\frequest for prejudgment interest. The court later granted in part the Plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for attorney’s fees, but awarded only $401,280.00 of the requested\n\n$1,618,294.49.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend the district court erred in (1) refusing to allow the jury to\n\namend its verdict, (2) reducing the award of punitive damages, (3) denying\n\nprejudgment interest under Kansas law, and (4) reducing the award of attorney’s\n\nfees. In its cross-appeal, Sprint first raises several reasons why the district court\n\nerred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on Audiotext’s fraud\n\nclaim. Second, Sprint argues the court erred in failing to limit contract damages\n\nas required under the terms of the IP contracts, and, third, erred in failing to\n\nenforce an IP contract provision regarding chargebacks. Finally Sprint argues for\n\na new trial on the ground that the inappropriately admitted fraud evidence tainted\n\nthe contract verdict. The parties agree that in this diversity case Florida law\n\ngoverns the tort claims and Kansas law controls the contract claims. Because\n\nSprint’s issues, if they have merit, would be dispositive, we address them first.\n\n      We review de novo the denial of judgment as a matter of law. See Taylor\n\nv. Cooper Tire and Rubber Co., 130 F.3d 1395, 1399 (10th Cir. 1997). Judgment\n\nas a matter of law is appropriate “[i]f during a trial by jury a party has been fully\n\nheard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a\n\nreasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). In\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fsupport of its contention that judgment as a matter of law should have been\n\ngranted against Audiotext’s fraud claim, Sprint argues first that the plain language\n\nof the IP contracts precludes reliance on its precontractual misrepresentations.\n\nRelying on the general rule that representations preceding or accompanying a\n\nwritten contract are merged into the final written contract, Sprint argues its pre-\n\ncontract misrepresentations as to coverage could not be relied upon in light of this\n\ncontract language: Sprint “will use its best efforts to maximize coverage for\n\nbilling and collection by entering into billing and collection agreements with as\n\nmany LECs as possible.” XV Aplt. Exh. App. at 3802; XIX Aplt. Exh. App. at\n\n4591. This clause, according to Sprint, clearly informed Audiotext that Sprint did\n\nnot have full billing and collection capability, because otherwise there would be\n\nno need for Sprint to make further efforts to maximize billing coverage.\n\n      A claim of fraud based on oral misrepresentations is barred if a later\n\ncontract adequately deals with the alleged misrepresentation. See Englezios v.\n\nBatmasian, 593 So. 2d 1077, 1078 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992). Sprint’s\n\nmisrepresentations had to do with “coverage,” an ambiguous term that was never\n\nclarified in the oral representations or defined in the parties’ contract. The\n\nmisrepresentations obscured Sprint’s extensive areas of non-equal access, which\n\nwere never addressed in the contract. Sprint’s contractual promise was to\n\n“maximize coverage” by contracting with LECs. Because the contract neither\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdefined coverage nor addressed non-equal access, it did not adequately deal with\n\nthe oral misrepresentations, and consequently did not bar the fraud claim based on\n\nthem.\n\n        Sprint also points to the merger and integration clauses in the IP contracts,\n\nwhich provide that the written contracts supersede all prior representations and\n\nconstitute the parties’ whole agreement. It is well settled in Florida that such\n\nclauses will not bar evidence of fraud in the inducement of the contract. See\n\nNobles v. Citizens Mortgage Corp., 479 So. 2d 822 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985).\n\n        Sprint’s next contention is that there was no evidence Audiotext’s first IP\n\ncontract was fraudulently induced, and that particular claim should not have been\n\nsubmitted to the jury. Although the substantive fraud issues are governed by\n\nFlorida law, federal law determines whether the evidence is sufficient to submit\n\nthe case to a jury. See Taylor, 130 F.3d at 1399.\n\n        Judgment as a matter of law is proper only when the evidence and all\n        inferences from it, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n        nonmoving party, is ‘so patently in favor of the moving party that a\n        jury verdict in favor of the opposing party would be improper and\n        would have to be set aside by the trial judge.’\n\nId. (quoting Peterson v. Hager, 724 F.2d 851, 853-54 (10th Cir.1984)). Sprint\n\nargues that Mr. Gifford, Audiotext’s president at the time of its first IP contract\n\nand the officer who executed the contract, did not testify at trial, and\n\nconsequently no evidence exists that Sprint misrepresented anything to him or\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fomitted to tell him anything. Sprint’s argument turns on its further allegation that\n\nMr. Gifford was the only Audiotext representative involved in the first IP\n\nagreement. But here it is mistaken. Sprint’s own employee, Diane Thomas\n\nBland, testified it was she who began Sprint’s business relationship with\n\nAudiotext, and she dealt with Michael Pardes at Audiotext before the first IP\n\nagreement. See XI Aplt. App. at 2546-48. She testified she made representations\n\nabout coverage to Mr. Pardes at that time. See id. The court did not err in\n\nsubmitting this claim to the jury.\n\n      Sprint’s next argument against Audiotext’s fraud claim is that the alleged\n\nmisrepresentations concern the heart of the parties’ agreement in the IP contracts,\n\nand consequently Florida’s economic loss rule limits Audiotext to its rights under\n\nthe contracts. The Florida Supreme Court has held that a claim for fraud in the\n\ninducement of a contract is an independent tort which is not barred by the\n\neconomic loss rule, and which may proceed alongside a claim for breach of the\n\ncontract. See HTP, Ltd. v. Lineas Aeras Costarricenses, S.A., 685 So. 2d 1238,\n\n1240 (Fla. 1996).\n\n      Fraud in the inducement presents a special situation where parties to\n      a contract appear to negotiate freely—which normally would\n      constitute grounds for invoking the economic loss doctrine—but\n      where in fact the ability of one party to negotiate fair terms and make\n      an informed decision is undermined by the other party’s fraudulent\n      behavior. . . .\n\nId. (quoting Huron Tool & Engineering Co. v. Precision Consulting Servs., Inc.,\n\n                                        -8-\n\f532 N.W.2d 541, 545 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995). Sprint makes a further distinction:\n\nif the substance of the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations is inseparable from\n\nwhat is promised in the contract, an action for fraud is barred and the plaintiff\n\nmust rely on the promises for which he bargained. See Hotels of Key Largo, Inc.\n\nv. RHI Hotels, Inc., 694 So. 2d 74, 78 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.), review denied, 700\n\nSo. 2d 685 (Fla. 1997). Conversely, if the misrepresentations are distinct from\n\nthe promises in the contract, the fraud claim is not barred by the economic loss\n\nrule. See HTP, 685 So. 2d at 1239. In our view this is merely another avenue to\n\narrive at our earlier conclusion: Sprint’s fraudulent misrepresentations were not\n\nadequately addressed in the contract. Because the fraud is distinct from the\n\nsubstance of the IP contracts, the claim was not barred by the economic loss\n\ndoctrine. See id. at 1239-40.\n\n      Sprint argues Audiotext failed to prove fraud damages that are separate and\n\ndistinct from its contract damages. We review the district court’s decision on\n\nwhether the damage award was duplicative for clear error, because of the factual\n\nnature of the inquiry. See Mason v. Oklahoma Turnpike Auth., 115 F.3d 1442,\n\n1459 (10th Cir. 1997), appeal decided by Mason v. Oklahoma Turnpike Auth.,\n\n124 F.3d 217 (10th Cir. 1997). “[I]t is firmly established that damages for fraud\n\nmay not be recovered when they merely duplicate those sustained as a result of a\n\nconcomitant breach of contract.” National Aircraft Servs., Inc. v. Aeroserv Int’l,\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fInc., 544 So. 2d 1063, 1065 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1989). Audiotext’s contract\n\ndamages compensated it for service fees paid to Sprint in return for which Sprint\n\ndid not perform its obligations. Among these failures was the thirteen percent\n\ndeviation between the number of billable calls that reached Audiotext’s 900\n\nprograms and the number of calls Sprint actually billed. Although no unbilled\n\ncalls reached Audiotext after it began blocking calls without ANI, Audiotext\n\ncontinued to receive a smaller volume of business than it would have had Sprint\n\nnot misrepresented its billing capacity. Audiotext’s fraud damages compensated\n\nit for revenue lost because of this smaller volume of calls after blocking. The\n\ndistrict court made this distinction and ordered remittitur of fraud damages that\n\nduplicated the contract recovery. The remaining fraud damages were properly\n\nrecovered. See Williams v. Peak Resorts Int’l Inc., 676 So. 2d 513, 516 (Fla.\n\nDist. Ct. App. 1996).\n\n      Sprint next complains that the district court improperly held it had a duty to\n\ndisclose to Audiotext any material fact which Audiotext did not have an equal\n\nopportunity to discover. It argues the proper standard is that it need only have\n\ndisclosed what Audiotext could not have learned through diligent inquiry. Sprint\n\nalso complains the court did not properly distinguish between active\n\nmisrepresentation and nondisclosure. That distinction has been severely criticized\n\nby the Florida Supreme Court. See Johnson v. Davis, 480 So. 2d 625, 628 (Fla.\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\f1985) (“[W]here failure to disclose a material fact is calculated to induce a false\n\nbelief, the distinction between concealment and affirmative representations is\n\ntenuous. Both proceed from the same motives and are attended with the same\n\nconsequences; both are violative of the principles of fair dealing and good faith;\n\nboth are calculated to produce the same result; and, in fact, both essentially have\n\nthe same effect.”). The standard of diligent inquiry Sprint attempts to impose on\n\nAudiotext was rejected by the Florida Supreme Court eighteen years ago. See\n\nBesett v. Basnett, 389 So. 2d 995, 998 (Fla. 1980) (“We hold that a recipient may\n\nrely on the truth of a representation, even though its falsity could have been\n\nascertained had he made an investigation, unless he knows the representation to\n\nbe false or its falsity is obvious to him.”). In Johnson, the court stated Florida\n\nlaw held “that where the parties are dealing at arm’s length and facts lie equally\n\nopen to both parties, with equal opportunity of examination, mere nondisclosure\n\ndoes not constitute a fraudulent concealment.” Johnson, 480 So. 2d at 628\n\n(emphasis added). Although the court criticized this rule as not in conformity\n\n“with current notions of justice, equity and fair dealing,” and in the context of\n\nresidential real estate transactions imposed a higher duty of disclosure, see id. at\n\n628-29, it follows even from the narrower rule that where the parties do not have\n\nequal opportunity to examine, nondisclosure may be fraudulent.\n\n      Sprint also quotes Watkins v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, 622 So. 2d 1063, 1065-66\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1993), review denied, 634 So. 2d 629 (Fla. 1994) in support\n\nof its nondisclosure standard. However Watkins states, immediately following the\n\npassage Sprint quotes, that the plaintiff in that case failed to plead any facts\n\nsupporting an unequal opportunity to discover. The district court did not err in\n\nformulating Florida law.\n\n      Sprint next argues several infirmities in the award of contract damages.\n\nFirst, it argues the court failed to limit damages in accord with contractual\n\nlimitation clauses. Second, it argues that the court improperly reversed itself after\n\ntrial by holding that certain language in the limitation clauses was ambiguous.\n\nThird, it argues the court improperly held that the jury had decided the ambiguous\n\nquestion when the jury had not been instructed to do so.\n\n      We review contractual language and the determination of ambiguity de\n\nnovo. See Mid-West Conveyor Co. v. Jervis B. Webb Co., 92 F.3d 992, 995 (10th\n\nCir. 1996). The IP agreements provided: “IN NO EVENT SHALL [SPRINT] BE\n\nLIABLE FOR: (1) ANY INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL OR\n\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY\n\nDAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE INTERRUPTION OR\n\nDISCONTINUANCE OF THE SERVICES FURNISHED BY [SPRINT] . . . OR\n\nANY LOST REVENUES OR PROFITS OF IP. . . .” II Aplt. Exh. App. at 323;\n\nXV Aplt. Exh. App. at 3639, 3802; XIX Aplt. Exh. App. at 4592. Sprint argues\n\n\n                                         - 12 -\n\fPlaintiffs’ contract damages were for lost profits or revenues, in violation of its\n\ncontractual exemption from “consequential damages.” Id. We agree with the\n\ndistrict court that Plaintiffs’ contract damages do not arise from lost profits or\n\nrevenues. Although Audiotext’s fraud damages compensated it for lost revenue,\n\nthe contract damages for both Plaintiffs arose from service fees Sprint charged\n\nthem and which, under the contract, were subject to recovery in the event of\n\nSprint’s breach.\n\n      The contract also provided as follows: “[Sprint’s] entire liability resulting\n\nfrom [its] failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement shall be\n\nIP’s actual, direct damages as might be provable in a court of law, but not to\n\nexceed the amount paid to [Sprint] for monthly services pursuant to this\n\nAgreement.” II Aplt. Exh. App. at 323; XV Aplt. Exh. App. at 3639, 3802; XIX\n\nAplt. Exh. App. at 4592. The district court first held the monthly services\n\nlimitation was an unambiguous contract provision which it would apply as a\n\nmatter of law. In response to a motion for reconsideration, the court reversed\n\nitself and acknowledged there was more than one reasonable interpretation of\n\nwhat amounts were properly included within “monthly services.” Because\n\nambiguous contract provisions are questions of fact for the jury, the court held\n\nthat all parties had had the opportunity to present their interpretations to the jury,\n\nand the jury had obviously found Plaintiffs’ evidence convincing.\n\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\f      The district court was correct in concluding “monthly services” was\n\nambiguous. See City of Wichita v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 24 F.3d 1282,\n\n1287 (10th Cir. 1994) (applying Kansas law and holding the contract term “gross\n\nreceipts from noncompetitive services” ambiguous). The two competing\n\nreasonable interpretations were that the term included either all monthly charges\n\npaid to Sprint, or only flat fees recurring each month. Sprint argues the latter\n\nview is the unambiguous plain meaning of the clause because Plaintiffs’\n\ninterpretation—that the amount includes the total monthly fees paid to\n\nSprint—would render the word “monthly” superfluous. We disagree. Under\n\nPlaintiffs’ interpretation monthly services are still distinguished from one-time\n\nflat fees paid to Sprint to begin service. See II Aplt. Exh. App. at 328.\n\n      Sprint argues the court erred in determining after trial that the issue had\n\nbeen decided by the jury even though no instruction was given on the matter.\n\nSprint did not timely object to the court’s failure to give an instruction, however,\n\nand has thus waived its claim. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51. Although Sprint suggests\n\nit was prejudiced by the court’s initial determination that the provision was\n\nunambiguous, depriving it of the opportunity to present evidence on the matter,\n\nwe note that Sprint called an expert in billing charges to testify as to the meaning\n\nof the monthly services limitation. We find no plain error. See Unit Drilling Co.\n\nv. Enron Oil & Gas Co., 108 F.3d 1186, 1190-91 (10th Cir. 1997).\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\f      Sprint’s next major argument is that the district court failed to enforce a\n\nprovision of the IP contracts relating to chargebacks, and thus improperly allowed\n\nPlaintiffs damages under this rubric. Chargebacks refer to 900 fees billed to and\n\ndisputed by the end user, which, as a result of that dispute, are deemed\n\nuncollectible. A multitude of reasons could support the determination that a 900\n\nfee was uncollectible; the end user might deny all knowledge of the call, for\n\nexample, or claim a minor had made the call, or he might simply refuse to pay.\n\nThe first IP agreements provide that if any single phone number’s monthly\n\nchargebacks exceeded $20.00, the IP would bear the loss, and where the\n\nchargebacks per phone number per month were less, Sprint would bear them. The\n\nsecond IP contracts lowered the threshold to $10.00. Sprint argues the Plaintiffs\n\ncalculated their damages to include chargebacks that were properly assessed to\n\nthem under these contract provisions.\n\n      Some disagreement, however, existed as to the definition of “chargeback.”\n\nPlaintiffs point to a Factoring Agreement between Sprint and Audiotext which\n\ndefines chargeback as “the amount of any IP Account for any Billing Period\n\nwhich is disputed by an end-user and which is determined by [Sprint] to be\n\nuncollectible.” XIX Aplt. Exh. App. at 4574 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs\n\nmaintain their chargeback damages were based on those instances in which Sprint\n\nfailed to “determine” the charges to be “uncollectible.” Plaintiffs proved this at\n\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\ftrial through Sprint’s witnesses and by offering in evidence the reason code Sprint\n\nlisted next to each chargeback, along with the reason code tables. The reasons for\n\nthe chargebacks indicate many of them—although disputed by the end user—were\n\nnot determined by Sprint to be uncollectible. Plaintiffs’ evidence also indicated\n\nthat callers repeatedly took advantage of their programs, denied all knowledge or\n\nrefused to pay, and requested an adjustment. See I Aplt. Supp. App. at 72–163,\n\nIII Aplt. Supp. App. at 675–822. Although Sprint contends that adjustments were\n\ngranted by LECs, and Sprint was bound by their decisions on billing matters,\n\nSprint’s private arrangements with LECs did not bind the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’\n\nbilling agreements were with Sprint, and they were entitled to hold Sprint to its\n\nword. Sprint presented its view of chargebacks to the jury, and the jury\n\napparently believed that much of what Sprint failed to collect from end users were\n\nnot “chargebacks” under the IP agreements, and thus not subject to the\n\nchargeback threshold.\n\n      Sprint’s final argument is that the improper submission of fraud claims\n\ntainted the jury’s consideration of the contract claims. This argument fails in the\n\nwake of our holding that the fraud claims were properly submitted to the jury.\n\n      We turn now to the issues raised by Plaintiffs in the main appeal. We\n\nreview for abuse of discretion Connections’ claim that the court erred in refusing\n\nto resubmit to the jury the verdict on its compensatory fraud damages. See Unit\n\n\n                                        - 16 -\n\fDrilling, 108 F.3d at 1192. Although the jury found that Sprint fraudulently\n\ninduced Connections to enter the IP contracts, it entered zero in the space for\n\nConnections’ compensatory fraud damages. On the special verdict form\n\nimmediately following these findings, an interrogatory stated that if the jury had\n\nfound Sprint defrauded Connections, and if it awarded Connections compensatory\n\nfraud damages, then it should decide whether Connections was entitled to punitive\n\ndamages. Although it had not satisfied both parts of the question’s predicate, the\n\njury answered that Connections was entitled to punitive damages. See V Aplt.\n\nApp. at 957-58. When the jury realized that its finding of no compensatory fraud\n\ndamages prevented it from awarding punitive damages to Connections, it wrote\n\nthe court a note:\n\n      it was not our intention to absolve Sprint from punitive damages with\n      regard to Connections’ fraud claim against them—we simply could\n      not decipher the fraud amount asked for. The verdict forms for\n      Connections asked for 7 figures—we were able to derive 6 figures\n      from Art Levinson’s testimony and Exhibit number 1980. Missing\n      was the figure for damages due to fraud. We all agreed to award the\n      entire amounts asked for plus punitive damages . . . . We were not\n      aware that by leaving the fraud amount at zero Sprint would not have\n      to pay punitive damages to Connections.\n\nXII Aplt. App. at 3049.\n\n      Connections argues the special verdict was inconsistent and the court was\n\nrequired to resubmit it to the jury for clarification. See Unit Drilling, 108 F.3d at\n\n1191. In reviewing this claim we must accept any reasonable view of the case\n\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\fthat will conform to the verdict. See Patton v. TIC United Corp., 77 F.3d 1235,\n\n1241 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, 518 U.S. 1005 (1996). We think it clear the jury\n\nsimply failed to follow the court’s instructions in the special interrogatory.\n\nAccording to those instructions the jury’s factual finding of zero compensatory\n\nfraud damages precludes its determination that punitive damages were\n\nappropriate. See Stoddard v. School Dist. No. 1, 590 F.2d 829, 835 (10th Cir.\n\n1979). Where predicate factual findings have been rendered in special\n\ninterrogatories, an erroneous legal conclusion by the jury may be disregarded.\n\nSee Ratigan v. New York Central R.R., 291 F.2d 548, 555 (2d Cir.), cert. denied,\n\n368 U.S. 891 (1961). The jury’s misperception of the legal effect of its\n\ncompensatory damages finding provides no basis on which to allow it to alter that\n\nfactual finding. From the jury’s note it is apparent that Connections failed in its\n\nburden of persuasion on this issue, and the court was well within its discretion in\n\nrefusing to send the issue back to the jury. Although Connections argues in its\n\nreply brief that under Florida law punitive damages for fraud may be awarded in\n\nthe absence of compensatory fraud damages, see Ault v. Lohr, 538 So. 2d 454,\n\n456 (Fla. 1989), it did not raise this point in the district court. Because\n\nConnections has not complied with Tenth Cir. R. 28.2(b) by demonstrating where\n\nin the 13,000-page record it was raised and ruled on, we deem the point waived.\n\nSee Harolds Stores, Inc. v. Dillard Dep’t Stores, Inc., 82 F.3d 1533, 1540 n.3\n\n\n                                         - 18 -\n\f(10th Cir.), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 297 (1996).\n\n      We review de novo Audiotext’s claim that the district court misinterpreted\n\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 768.73 by applying it to Audiotext’s award of punitive damages.\n\nSee City of Wichita v. United States Gypsum Co., 72 F.3d 1491, 1495 (10th Cir.\n\n1996). The statute provides:\n\n             (1) (a) In any civil action based on negligence, strict liability,\n      products liability, misconduct in commercial transactions,\n      professional liability, or breach of warranty, and involving willful,\n      wanton, or gross misconduct, the judgment for the total amount of\n      punitive damages awarded to a claimant may not exceed three times\n      the amount of compensatory damages awarded to each person\n      entitled thereto by the trier of fact, except as provided in paragraph\n      (b).\n             (b) If any award for punitive damages exceeds the limitation\n      specified in paragraph (a), the award is presumed to be excessive and\n      the defendant is entitled to remittitur of the amount in excess of the\n      limitation unless the claimant demonstrates to the court by clear and\n      convincing evidence that the award is not excessive in light of the\n      facts and circumstances which were presented to the trier of fact.\n\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 768.73(1)(b) (West 1996). Audiotext raises four arguments on\n\nthis claim. First, it argues its fraudulent inducement claim does not constitute\n\n“misconduct in commercial transactions,” id., and thus the statute does not apply\n\nto its punitive damage award. Second, it argues that even if the statute does\n\napply, the district court erred in trebling only Audiotext’s compensatory fraud\n\ndamages instead of its total compensatory damages in arriving at the statutory\n\ncap. Third, it argues the district court erred in finding it had not rebutted by clear\n\nand convincing evidence the presumption of excessiveness under § 768.73(1)(b).\n\n                                         - 19 -\n\fFourth, it contends that even if the court did not commit a legal error in applying\n\nthe statute, it abused its discretion in denying Audiotext’s motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment by removing the punitive damages cap.\n\n      The statute does not define “misconduct in commercial transactions” and\n\nFlorida courts have not addressed the issue presented to us, but we think the\n\nstatute’s plain meaning covers Sprint’s fraud in its commercial relationship with\n\nAudiotext. The Florida Supreme Court has held that a legitimate objective of\n\n§ 768.73 is to “discourage punitive damage claims.” Gordon v. State, 608 So. 2d\n\n800, 802 (Fla. 1992), cert. denied, 507 U.S. 1005 (1993). It has also held that\n\n“misconduct in commercial transactions” covers intentional torts, in particular the\n\ntort of malicious prosecution. See Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Mancusi, 632 So.\n\n2d 1352, 1357-58 (Fla. 1994). In Mancusi, the plaintiff thought he had rented a\n\ncar from Alamo for one month; however the rental contract indicated a rental\n\nperiod of one week. Sometime after the week had elapsed, Alamo had Mancusi\n\narrested and prosecuted. Mancusi sued Alamo for malicious prosecution, won\n\ncompensatory and punitive damage awards, and the Florida Supreme Court held\n\nthat “misconduct in commercial transactions” covered the punitive award. See id.\n\nat 1354-58. 1 We believe this indicates a flexible and common-sense reading of\n\n\n      1\n       Although Audiotext asserts Mancusi’s holding on this point is dictum\nbecause the court ultimately held the statute did not apply retroactively to\nMancusi’s cause of action, we believe it still provides an authoritative indication\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fthe misconduct phrase. Audiotext argues that because the phrase says\n\n“misconduct in a commercial transaction,” it does not apply to its misconduct\n\nbefore the IP agreements. While this textual argument has appeal, we do not\n\nthink the Florida courts would read the statute in such a technical fashion. The\n\nentire relationship between Sprint and Audiotext was commercial, and we believe\n\ntheir pre-contract negotiations fall within the ordinary meaning of “commercial\n\ntransaction.” In Mancusi, the Court held that an intentional tort which occurred\n\nafter the expiration of the one-week rental contract was “during the course of the\n\ncommercial transaction” and was “the direct result of that commercial\n\ntransaction.” Id. at 1357. Similar logic brings commercial contract negotiations\n\nwithin the scope of the statutory phrase. But Audiotext’s technical argument is\n\nperhaps better met with another: an element of fraudulent inducement is damages,\n\nsee Baker v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, 661 So. 2d 128, 131 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\n\n1995), review denied, 669 So. 2d 252 (Fla. 1996) and damages did not begin to\n\naccrue until the IP contracts were executed. Therefore part of Sprint’s\n\nmisconduct occurred “in” the commercial transactions. Audiotext also relies on\n\nScheidt v. Klein, 956 F.2d 963, 970 (10th Cir. 1992), in which we included the\n\ndictum “common law fraud does not appear to fall within the explicitly delimited\n\nscope of section 768.73(1) . . . .” Id. Scheidt was decided prior to Mancusi, and\n\n\n\nof how Florida courts would interpret the statute.\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\fthe quoted statement was not necessary to our decision because we held the\n\nargument to which it applied had been waived. See id.\n\n      Audiotext argues next that the district court erred in trebling only its\n\ncompensatory fraud damages and excluding contract damages when calculating\n\nthe punitive damage cap. Audiotext relies on the language of the statute and\n\nChristenson & Assocs. v. Palumbo-Tucker, 656 So. 2d 266 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\n\n1995) for its contention that the total compensatory damage award for all claims\n\nshould have been trebled to calculate the cap. The relevant statutory language\n\nstates: “the total amount of punitive damages awarded to a claimant may not\n\nexceed three times the amount of compensatory damages awarded to each person .\n\n. . .” Fla. Stat. Ann. § 768.73(1)(a). Christenson held that prejudgment interest\n\nshould be included in the compensatory damage award before trebling. See\n\nChristenson, 656 So. 2d at 266 (“Certainly, there is nothing in section 768.73\n\nauthorizing judges to separate the various elements composing the bundle of\n\ncompensatory damages and discard from the punitive damages formula those\n\nelements that the judge personally deems unwise.”). Although Christenson’s\n\nlanguage is broad, it does not support Audiotext’s reading. Section 768.73\n\nappears under the statutory chapter “Torts,” and we believe it must be read in that\n\ncontext. Under Audiotext’s interpretation, unrelated claims compensated in one\n\nlawsuit would all be trebled so long as punitive damages were awarded on one of\n\n\n                                        - 22 -\n\fthe claims. Further, Audiotext’s interpretation would violate Florida’s rule that\n\npunitive damages may not be recovered for breach of contract. See Lewis v.\n\nGuthartz, 428 So. 2d 222, 223 (Fla. 1982). Punitive damages are recoverable for\n\nthe independent tort of fraud, and it is to that claim the statute refers.\n\n      Audiotext next complains that the district court erred in finding it had not\n\nmet its statutory burden of demonstrating to the court by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that the punitive damage award was not excessive. We review the\n\ncourt’s finding for clear error. See FDIC v. Hamilton, 122 F.3d 854, 860 (10th\n\nCir. 1997). Further, we owe deference to the district court’s opportunity to judge\n\nthe credibility and weight of evidence, see Salve Regina College v. Russell, 499\n\nU.S. 225, 233 (1991), and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the trial\n\ncourt, see Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985). We\n\nhave reviewed the record and cannot say the court clearly erred in finding\n\nAudiotext did not meet its high burden. 2 Moreover, having reviewed de novo the\n\ndistrict court’s interpretation of Fla. Stat. Ann. § 768.73, we see no reason to\n\ntraverse the same ground using the more deferential abuse of discretion standard\n\n\n      2\n        In its effort to convince us the punitive damage award was not excessive,\nAudiotext cites more than once to Continental Trend Resources, Inc. v. OXY\nUSA Inc., 44 F.3d 1465 (10th Cir. 1995). That decision was vacated and\nremanded by the Supreme Court. See OXY USA Inc. v. Continental Trend\nResources, Inc., 517 U.S. 1216 (1996), on remand, Continental Trend Resources,\nInc. v. OXY USA Inc., 101 F.3d 634 (10th Cir. 1996) (reducing punitive damages\nfrom $30,000,000 to $6,000,000), cert. denied, 117 S. Ct. 1846 (1997).\n\n                                          - 23 -\n\funder which Audiotext complains about the denial of its motion to alter or amend\n\nthe judgment.\n\n      Both Audiotext and Connections contend the district court erred in denying\n\nthem prejudgment interest on their contract damages under Kansas law. We\n\nreview the denial of prejudgment interest for abuse of discretion, see Frymire v.\n\nAmpex Corp., 61 F.3d 757, 772 (10th Cir. 1995), cert. dismissed, 519 U.S. 1182\n\n(1996), but consider the underlying question of statutory interpretation de novo,\n\nsee Driver Music Cos. v. Commercial Union Ins. Co., 94 F.3d 1428, 1433 (10th\n\nCir. 1996). Kan. Stat. Ann. § 16-201 (West 1996) provides:\n\n      Creditors shall be allowed to receive interest . . . for any money after it\n      becomes due; for money lent or money due on settlement of account, from\n      the day of liquidating the account and ascertaining the balance; . . . for\n      money due and withheld by an unreasonable and vexatious delay of\n      payment or settlement of accounts . . . .\n\nId. Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to prejudgment interest on both statutory\n\ngrounds: first, that the contract damages due them were liquidated; second, that\n\nSprint unreasonably and vexatiously withheld payments which were due and\n\nowing to Plaintiffs.\n\n      “A claim becomes liquidated when both the amount due and the date on\n\nwhich it is due are fixed and certain, or when the same become definitely\n\nascertainable by mathematical computation.” Plains Resources, Inc. v. Gable, 682\n\nP.2d 653, 657 (Kan. 1984). Disputes as to underlying liability are irrelevant\n\n\n                                        - 24 -\n\fprovided the amount of damages is certain. See Royal College Shop, Inc. v.\n\nNorthern Ins. Co., 895 F.2d 670, 674 (10th Cir. 1990). The amount of damages\n\nwas the subject of extensive trial testimony and involved complex statistical\n\nprocedures and aggregations, some of which were hotly disputed. Audiotext’s\n\nown representative testified as to how he had arrived at the 73% damage figure\n\nfor excessive chargebacks: “Yeah. What I felt was reasonable is what came out to\n\nabout 73—.” I Aplee. App. at 133. We think it obvious the damages were not\n\nliquidated.\n\n      The trial court has discretionary power to award interest as an element of\n\ndamages even if the primary damages are not liquidated. See Lightcap v. Mobil\n\nOil Corp., 562 P.2d 1, 16 (Kan.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 876 (1977). Guided by\n\nconsiderations of fairness and equity, such an award is intended to fully\n\ncompensate a party injured through vexatious withholding of monies owed. See\n\nid. at 16. The award is dependent, of course, on the trial court’s discretion, to\n\nwhich we defer because it had the opportunity to scrutinize the evidence, assess\n\ncredibility and probativeness, and balance the equities. See Royal College Shop,\n\n895 F.2d at 675–76. We find no abuse of that discretion.\n\n      Plaintiffs finally argue the district court abused its discretion in awarding\n\nthem a substantially reduced amount of attorney’s fees. The IP agreements\n\nprovided that “[i]n the event of legal action by either of the parties hereto,” the\n\n\n                                         - 25 -\n\fparty in whose favor final judgment is entered is entitled to attorney fees, costs,\n\nand expenses from the losing party. See, e.g., XIX Aplt. Exh. App. at 4596.\n\nPlaintiffs’ counsel requested compensation for 7,160 hours at an average rate of\n\n$236.75, for a total of $1,618,294.49, plus $332,865.55 in expenses. The district\n\ncourt awarded $350,000 in fees and $51,280 in expenses. Plaintiffs protest the\n\ncourt’s decision to award fees only for claims on which they succeeded, its failure\n\nto fully explain its reductions to the fee award, its failure to consider the degree\n\nof success they achieved, and its decision to “simply make a general reduction”\n\ninstead of cutting particularized hours based on specific findings. VIII Aplt. App.\n\nat 2031.\n\n      When a court awards attorney fees pursuant to a contract, as opposed to a\n\nstatute, we have recognized that its duty is to ensure the nonbreaching party is\n\nmade whole and receives the benefit of its bargain. See United States ex rel.\n\nC.J.C., Inc. v. Western States Mechanical Contractors, Inc., 834 F.2d 1533, 1547-\n\n48 (10th Cir. 1987). Because these purposes are fundamentally different from\n\nthose underlying statutory fee awards, we have held that the close scrutiny applied\n\nto statutory fee awards should not be applied to contractual awards, see id.; Public\n\nServ. Co. of Colo. v. Continental Cas. Co., 26 F.3d 1508, 1520 & n.11 (10th Cir.\n\n1994), which should be routinely awarded. See Public Serv. Co. of Colo., 26 F.3d\n\nat 1520-21. The trial court’s task is not to fix a reasonable fee, as it is in\n\n\n                                          - 26 -\n\fstatutory awards, but only to determine whether the requested fee is “inequitable\n\nor unreasonable,” in which case it may reduce the fee accordingly. See C.J.C.,\n\nInc., 834 F.2d at 1549. Kansas law governs the contractual award of fees. See\n\nPublic Serv. Co. of Colo., 26 F.3d at 1520.\n\n      The district court properly stated Kansas standards for determining the\n\nreasonableness of the fee, and we cannot find that it abused its discretion in\n\nfixing a rate or in separating reasonable from unreasonable categories of fees.\n\nNor did the court abuse its discretion in declining to give great weight to the\n\nplaintiffs’ degree of success. See C.J.C., Inc., 834 F.2d at 1547-50 (holding court\n\nis not bound to consider federal statutory fee factors). However the court refused\n\nto subtract the categories of unreasonable billings from the total in order to arrive\n\nat a reasonable fee. Instead it simply picked a figure it thought reasonable. We\n\nconsider such a general reduction an abuse of discretion. The court must\n\narticulate some rational method by which it arrives at a reasonable fee. See\n\nC.J.C., Inc., 834 F.2d at 1550 (holding that in contractual fee award “it remains\n\nimportant for the district court to provide a ‘concise but clear explanation’ of its\n\nreasons for any adjustments to the fee award.”) (quoting Mares v. Credit Bureau\n\nof Raton, 801 F.2d 1197, 1201 (10th Cir.1986) (quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461\n\nU.S. 424, 437 (1983))).\n\n      Although the court stated that Plaintiffs had not totaled their billings for\n\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\feach separate claim, and refused to “scour through nearly 500 pages of unindexed\n\nbilling statements,” VIII Aplt. App. at 2030, we know of nothing requiring\n\nPlaintiffs to index or segregate their charges for various claims. We have held\n\nthat contractual fee claimants need not meticulously describe each task billed.\n\nSee Public Serv. Co. of Colo., 26 F.3d at 1520 (“While the absence of specific\n\ntask descriptions may preclude an award of fees in cases arising under a federal\n\nfee-shifting statute . . . the same degree of specificity is not required in the\n\ncontext of contractual fee awards.”). Cf. id. at 1521 (holding court need not comb\n\nvoluminous billing records to ferret out certain hours which opposing party\n\ncomplained about but failed to draw to the court’s attention). If the court wishes\n\nto cut time spent on claims which were not ultimately successful, it should do so\n\nand recalculate the fee to arrive at a reasonable figure. See id. (affirming trial\n\ncourt’s use of lodestar approach and specific deduction of unreasonable billings).\n\n      AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.\n\n                                         Entered for the Court\n\n                                         Paul J.

(Audiotext)\n\nand Connections U.S.A., Inc. (Connections) appeal after a jury verdict in their\n\nfavor, alleging several errors in both the judgment and in the court’s award of\n\nattorney’s fees. Defendant-Appellant U.S. Telecom, Inc. (Sprint) cross-appeals\n\nfrom the judgment against it. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and\n\n\n      *\n        This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the\ndoctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. This court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\fwe affirm as to everything but attorney’s fees.\n\n      Audiotext and Connections are known, in telecommunications argot, as\n\ninformation providers (IPs). They offer interactive messages and live operators,\n\non a pay-per-call basis, via long distance 900 numbers. Audiotext and\n\nConnections offered sports information and psychic, astrological, dating, and\n\npornographic programs. The consumer placing calls is known as the end user.\n\nAudiotext and Connections each entered into two consecutive information\n\nprovider contracts (IP contracts) with Sprint for long-distance pay-per-call\n\nservice. Sprint, an interexchange carrier (IXC), was obliged under the contracts\n\nto carry Plaintiffs’ 900 calls over its long distance network, bill and collect\n\ncharges from the end users, and remit the monies to Plaintiffs. In return,\n\nPlaintiffs paid Sprint transport and billing and collection fees. Over the duration\n\nof the contracts, Plaintiffs paid Sprint more than $3,000,000 in service fees.\n\n      Evidence presented at trial indicated Sprint induced Plaintiffs to enter into\n\nthe contracts by representing that it could supply 900-number coverage for the\n\nwhole country, except for insignificant rural pockets where Plaintiffs were not\n\nadvertising anyway. It became apparent during the course of the contracts,\n\nhowever, that Sprint was not remitting payment to the IPs for a significant volume\n\nof calls the IPs serviced. Further evidence showed large areas of unequal\n\naccess—areas in which AT&T had the ability to bill and collect for 900 calls but\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fother carriers did not. In these areas Sprint needed to enter into a contract with\n\nthe local telephone company (LEC) and regional Bell operating company (RBOC)\n\nin order to bill to and collect from the end user. When Sprint began offering 900\n\nservice in 1989, it had no billing agreements with any LEC or RBOC. During\n\n1990 Sprint entered into billing contracts with only six of the 1200 to 1400 LECs\n\nand RBOCs in the United States. Sprint created internal reports and maps of\n\nunequal access areas, showing where it did and did not have the ability to bill and\n\ncollect for 900 calls. Although it could have opened up 900 access to its long\n\ndistance network only in areas in which it could bill for calls directly or had\n\ncontracted with a LEC and RBOC for billing services, Sprint deliberately opened\n\n900 access to calls from the entire country.\n\n      Connections entered into its first IP contract with Sprint in 1989, and\n\nAudiotext followed in 1990. Although its inability to collect and bill for unequal\n\naccess calls was well-known to Sprint, it failed to inform the IPs of the problem.\n\n      When Audiotext and Connections became aware of the substantial disparity\n\nbetween the number of calls they serviced and the number Sprint paid them for,\n\nthey brought the problem to Sprint’s attention. Sprint responded with surprise\n\nand assured Audiotext and Connections that the problem was not caused by any\n\ndeficiency on its part. When the problem persisted and Plaintiffs pursued their\n\ncomplaints, Sprint gave a variety of excuses, transferred Plaintiffs’ accounts to\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fother Sprint representatives, and released misleading reports about the non-equal\n\naccess issue.\n\n      In July 1991, Audiotext installed equipment which allowed it to recognize\n\nwhether incoming 900 number calls were accompanied by complete billing\n\ninformation, or ANI, which included the end user’s name and address. It became\n\nimmediately apparent Sprint was transporting a significant number of calls\n\nunaccompanied by ANI. For each of these calls Sprint collected from Audiotext\n\nits transport and billing fees but could not bill the end user, and so could not\n\nremit to Audiotext its charge for the call. Audiotext set up its equipment to block\n\ncalls without complete ANI, and confronted Sprint with the problem. Sprint\n\nadmitted it was unable to bill in most non-equal access areas. Connections\n\nindependently discovered the non-equal access problem in September 1991.\n\nSprint withdrew from the 900 number business within the next month.\n\n      A jury found Sprint had fraudulently induced and breached its IP contracts\n\nwith both Audiotext and Connections. The jury awarded compensatory damages\n\non all claims except Connections’ fraud claim. After a separate inquiry the jury\n\nawarded Audiotext $15,000,000 in punitive damages, but the district court\n\nreduced the amount to $2,222,368.20 pursuant to Fla. Stat. Ann. § 768.73 (West\n\n1996). The court refused the jury’s request for permission to change its verdict to\n\naward Connections compensatory fraud damages, and also denied Plaintiffs’\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\frequest for prejudgment interest. The court later granted in part the Plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for attorney’s fees, but awarded only $401,280.00 of the requested\n\n$1,618,294.49.\n\n      Plaintiffs contend the district court erred in (1) refusing to allow the jury to\n\namend its verdict, (2) reducing the award of punitive damages, (3) denying\n\nprejudgment interest under Kansas law, and (4) reducing the award of attorney’s\n\nfees. In its cross-appeal, Sprint first raises several reasons why the district court\n\nerred in denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law on Audiotext’s fraud\n\nclaim. Second, Sprint argues the court erred in failing to limit contract damages\n\nas required under the terms of the IP contracts, and, third, erred in failing to\n\nenforce an IP contract provision regarding chargebacks. Finally Sprint argues for\n\na new trial on the ground that the inappropriately admitted fraud evidence tainted\n\nthe contract verdict. The parties agree that in this diversity case Florida law\n\ngoverns the tort claims and Kansas law controls the contract claims. Because\n\nSprint’s issues, if they have merit, would be dispositive, we address them first.\n\n      We review de novo the denial of judgment as a matter of law. See Taylor\n\nv. Cooper Tire and Rubber Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"155653\"><a href=\"/opinion/155653/taylor-v-cooper-tire-rubber/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1395</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1399 (10th Cir. 1997). Judgment\n\nas a matter of law is appropriate “[i]f during a trial by jury a party has been fully\n\nheard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a\n\nreasonable jury to find for that party on that issue.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1). In\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fsupport of its contention that judgment as a matter of law should have been\n\ngranted against Audiotext’s fraud claim, Sprint argues first that the plain language\n\nof the IP contracts precludes reliance on its precontractual misrepresentations.\n\nRelying on the general rule that representations preceding or accompanying a\n\nwritten contract are merged into the final written contract, Sprint argues its pre-\n\ncontract misrepresentations as to coverage could not be relied upon in light of this\n\ncontract language: Sprint “will use its best efforts to maximize coverage for\n\nbilling and collection by entering into billing and collection agreements with as\n\nmany LECs as possible.” XV Aplt. Exh. App. at 3802; XIX Aplt. Exh. App. at\n\n4591. This clause, according to Sprint, clearly informed Audiotext that Sprint did\n\nnot have full billing and collection capability, because otherwise there would be\n\nno need for Sprint to make further efforts to maximize billing coverage.\n\n      A claim of fraud based on oral misrepresentations is barred if a later\n\ncontract adequately deals with the alleged misrepresentation. See Englezios v.\n\nBatmasian, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1089973\"><a href=\"/opinion/1089973/englezios-v-batmasian/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1077</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1078 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992). Sprint’s\n\nmisrepresentations had to do with “coverage,” an ambiguous term that was never\n\nclarified in the oral representations or defined in the parties’ contract. The\n\nmisrepresentations obscured Sprint’s extensive areas of non-equal access, which\n\nwere never addressed in the contract. Sprint’s contractual promise was to\n\n“maximize coverage” by contracting with LECs. Because the contract neither\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fdefined coverage nor addressed non-equal access, it did not adequately deal with\n\nthe oral misrepresentations, and consequently did not bar the fraud claim based on\n\nthem.\n\n        Sprint also points to the merger and integration clauses in the IP contracts,\n\nwhich provide that the written contracts supersede all prior representations and\n\nconstitute the parties’ whole agreement. It is well settled in Florida that such\n\nclauses will not bar evidence of fraud in the inducement of the contract. See\n\nNobles v. Citizens Mortgage Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1103706\"><a href=\"/opinion/1103706/nobles-v-citizens-mortgage-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">822</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1985).\n\n        Sprint’s next contention is that there was no evidence Audiotext’s first IP\n\ncontract was fraudulently induced, and that particular claim should not have been\n\nsubmitted to the jury. Although the substantive fraud issues are governed by\n\nFlorida law, federal law determines whether the evidence is sufficient to submit\n\nthe case to a jury. See Taylor, 130 F.3d at 1399.\n\n        Judgment as a matter of law is proper only when the evidence and all\n        inferences from it, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n        nonmoving party, is ‘so patently in favor of the moving party that a\n        jury verdict in favor of the opposing party would be improper and\n        would have to be set aside by the trial judge.’\n\nId. (quoting Peterson v. Hager, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429497\"><a href=\"/opinion/429497/clayton-peterson-v-raymond-hager-dba-hagers-flying-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 853-54 (10th Cir.1984)). Sprint\n\nargues that Mr. Gifford, Audiotext’s president at the time of its first IP contract\n\nand the officer who executed the contract, did not testify at trial, and\n\nconsequently no evidence exists that Sprint misrepresented anything to him or\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fomitted to tell him anything. Sprint’s argument turns on its further allegation that\n\nMr. Gifford was the only Audiotext representative involved in the first IP\n\nagreement. But here it is mistaken. Sprint’s own employee, Diane Thomas\n\nBland, testified it was she who began Sprint’s business relationship with\n\nAudiotext, and she dealt with Michael Pardes at Audiotext before the first IP\n\nagreement. See XI Aplt. App. at 2546-48. She testified she made representations\n\nabout coverage to Mr. Pardes at that time. See id. The court did not err in\n\nsubmitting this claim to the jury.\n\n      Sprint’s next argument against Audiotext’s fraud claim is that the alleged\n\nmisrepresentations concern the heart of the parties’ agreement in the IP contracts,\n\nand consequently Florida’s economic loss rule limits Audiotext to its rights under\n\nthe contracts. The Florida Supreme Court has held that a claim for fraud in the\n\ninducement of a contract is an independent tort which is not barred by the\n\neconomic loss rule, and which may proceed alongside a claim for breach of the\n\ncontract. See HTP, Ltd. v. Lineas Aeras Costarricenses, S.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1851642\"><a href=\"/opinion/1851642/htp-ltd-v-lineas-aereas-costarricenses/\"><span class=\"volume\">685</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1240 (Fla. 1996).\n\n      Fraud in the inducement presents a special situation where parties to\n      a contract appear to negotiate freely—which normally would\n      constitute grounds for invoking the economic loss doctrine—but\n      where in fact the ability of one party to negotiate fair terms and make\n      an informed decision is undermined by the other party’s fraudulent\n      behavior. . . .\n\nId. (quoting Huron Tool & Engineering Co. v. Precision Consulting Servs., Inc.,\n\n                                        -8-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2216275\"><a href=\"/opinion/2216275/huron-tool-and-engineering-co-v-precision-consulting-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">541</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 545 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995). Sprint makes a further distinction:\n\nif the substance of the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations is inseparable from\n\nwhat is promised in the contract, an action for fraud is barred and the plaintiff\n\nmust rely on the promises for which he bargained. See Hotels of Key Largo, Inc.\n\nv. RHI Hotels, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1843756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1843756/hotels-of-key-largo-inc-v-rhi-hotels/\"><span class=\"volume\">694</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (Fla.

Conversely, if the misrepresentations are distinct from\n\nthe promises in the contract, the fraud claim is not barred by the economic loss\n\nrule. See HTP, 685 So. 2d at 1239. In our view this is merely another avenue to\n\narrive at our earlier conclusion: Sprint’s fraudulent misrepresentations were not\n\nadequately addressed in the contract. Because the fraud is distinct from the\n\nsubstance of the IP contracts, the claim was not barred by the economic loss\n\ndoctrine. See id. at 1239-40.\n\n      Sprint argues Audiotext failed to prove fraud damages that are separate and\n\ndistinct from its contract damages. We review the district court’s decision on\n\nwhether the damage award was duplicative for clear error, because of the factual\n\nnature of the inquiry. See Mason v. Oklahoma Turnpike Auth., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741895\"><a href=\"/opinion/741895/ronald-k-mason-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-oklahoma-turnpike/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1442</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1459 (10th Cir. 1997), appeal decided by Mason v.

Dist. Ct. App. 1989). Audiotext’s contract\n\ndamages compensated it for service fees paid to Sprint in return for which Sprint\n\ndid not perform its obligations. Among these failures was the thirteen percent\n\ndeviation between the number of billable calls that reached Audiotext’s 900\n\nprograms and the number of calls Sprint actually billed. Although no unbilled\n\ncalls reached Audiotext after it began blocking calls without ANI, Audiotext\n\ncontinued to receive a smaller volume of business than it would have had Sprint\n\nnot misrepresented its billing capacity. Audiotext’s fraud damages compensated\n\nit for revenue lost because of this smaller volume of calls after blocking. The\n\ndistrict court made this distinction and ordered remittitur of fraud damages that\n\nduplicated the contract recovery. The remaining fraud damages were properly\n\nrecovered. See Williams v. Peak Resorts Int’l Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1720091\"><a href=\"/opinion/1720091/williams-v-peak-resorts-intern-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">676</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 516 (Fla.\n\nDist. Ct. App. 1996).\n\n      Sprint next complains that the district court improperly held it had a duty to\n\ndisclose to Audiotext any material fact which Audiotext did not have an equal\n\nopportunity to discover. It argues the proper standard is that it need only have\n\ndisclosed what Audiotext could not have learned through diligent inquiry. Sprint\n\nalso complains the court did not properly distinguish between active\n\nmisrepresentation and nondisclosure. That distinction has been severely criticized\n\nby the Florida Supreme Court. See Johnson v. Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1646494\"><a href=\"/opinion/1646494/johnson-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 628 (Fla.\n\n\n                                        - 10 -\n\f1985) (“[W]here failure to disclose a material fact is calculated to induce a false\n\nbelief, the distinction between concealment and affirmative representations is\n\ntenuous. Both proceed from the same motives and are attended with the same\n\nconsequences; both are violative of the principles of fair dealing and good faith;\n\nboth are calculated to produce the same result; and, in fact, both essentially have\n\nthe same effect.”). The standard of diligent inquiry Sprint attempts to impose on\n\nAudiotext was rejected by the Florida Supreme Court eighteen years ago. See\n\nBesett v. Basnett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1693682\"><a href=\"/opinion/1693682/besett-v-basnett/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">995</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 998 (Fla. 1980) (“We hold that a recipient may\n\nrely on the truth of a representation, even though its falsity could have been\n\nascertained had he made an investigation, unless he knows the representation to\n\nbe false or its falsity is obvious to him.”). In Johnson, the court stated Florida\n\nlaw held “that where the parties are dealing at arm’s length and facts lie equally\n\nopen to both parties, with equal opportunity of examination, mere nondisclosure\n\ndoes not constitute a fraudulent concealment.” Johnson, 480 So. 2d at 628\n\n(emphasis added). Although the court criticized this rule as not in conformity\n\n“with current notions of justice, equity and fair dealing,” and in the context of\n\nresidential real estate transactions imposed a higher duty of disclosure, see id. at\n\n628-29, it follows even from the narrower rule that where the parties do not have\n\nequal opportunity to examine, nondisclosure may be fraudulent.\n\n      Sprint also quotes Watkins v. NCNB Nat’l Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1151790\"><a href=\"/opinion/1151790/watkins-v-ncnb-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1065-66\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\f(Fla.

However Watkins states, immediately following the\n\npassage Sprint quotes, that the plaintiff in that case failed to plead any facts\n\nsupporting an unequal opportunity to discover. The district court did not err in\n\nformulating Florida law.\n\n      Sprint next argues several infirmities in the award of contract damages.\n\nFirst, it argues the court failed to limit damages in accord with contractual\n\nlimitation clauses. Second, it argues that the court improperly reversed itself after\n\ntrial by holding that certain language in the limitation clauses was ambiguous.\n\nThird, it argues the court improperly held that the jury had decided the ambiguous\n\nquestion when the jury had not been instructed to do so.\n\n      We review contractual language and the determination of ambiguity de\n\nnovo.

Although Audiotext’s fraud damages compensated it for lost revenue,\n\nthe contract damages for both Plaintiffs arose from service fees Sprint charged\n\nthem and which, under the contract, were subject to recovery in the event of\n\nSprint’s breach.\n\n      The contract also provided as follows: “[Sprint’s] entire liability resulting\n\nfrom [its] failure to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement shall be\n\nIP’s actual, direct damages as might be provable in a court of law, but not to\n\nexceed the amount paid to [Sprint] for monthly services pursuant to this\n\nAgreement.” II Aplt. Exh. App. at 323; XV Aplt. Exh. App. at 3639, 3802; XIX\n\nAplt. Exh. App. at 4592. The district court first held the monthly services\n\nlimitation was an unambiguous contract provision which it would apply as a\n\nmatter of law. In response to a motion for reconsideration, the court reversed\n\nitself and acknowledged there was more than one reasonable interpretation of\n\nwhat amounts were properly included within “monthly services.” Because\n\nambiguous contract provisions are questions of fact for the jury, the court held\n\nthat all parties had had the opportunity to present their interpretations to the jury,\n\nand the jury had obviously found Plaintiffs’ evidence convincing.\n\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\f      The district court was correct in concluding “monthly services” was\n\nambiguous. See City of Wichita v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670628\"><a href=\"/opinion/670628/city-of-wichita-kansas-a-kansas-municipal-corporation-v-southwestern/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1287 (10th Cir. 1994) (applying Kansas law and holding the contract term “gross\n\nreceipts from noncompetitive services” ambiguous). The two competing\n\nreasonable interpretations were that the term included either all monthly charges\n\npaid to Sprint, or only flat fees recurring each month. Sprint argues the latter\n\nview is the unambiguous plain meaning of the clause because Plaintiffs’\n\ninterpretation—that the amount includes the total monthly fees paid to\n\nSprint—would render the word “monthly” superfluous. We disagree. Under\n\nPlaintiffs’ interpretation monthly services are still distinguished from one-time\n\nflat fees paid to Sprint to begin service. See II Aplt. Exh. App. at 328.\n\n      Sprint argues the court erred in determining after trial that the issue had\n\nbeen decided by the jury even though no instruction was given on the matter.\n\nSprint did not timely object to the court’s failure to give an instruction, however,\n\nand has thus waived its claim. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51. Although Sprint suggests\n\nit was prejudiced by the court’s initial determination that the provision was\n\nunambiguous, depriving it of the opportunity to present evidence on the matter,\n\nwe note that Sprint called an expert in billing charges to testify as to the meaning\n\nof the monthly services limitation. We find no plain error. See Unit Drilling Co.\n\nv.

Chargebacks refer to 900 fees billed to and\n\ndisputed by the end user, which, as a result of that dispute, are deemed\n\nuncollectible. A multitude of reasons could support the determination that a 900\n\nfee was uncollectible; the end user might deny all knowledge of the call, for\n\nexample, or claim a minor had made the call, or he might simply refuse to pay.\n\nThe first IP agreements provide that if any single phone number’s monthly\n\nchargebacks exceeded $20.00, the IP would bear the loss, and where the\n\nchargebacks per phone number per month were less, Sprint would bear them. The\n\nsecond IP contracts lowered the threshold to $10.00. Sprint argues the Plaintiffs\n\ncalculated their damages to include chargebacks that were properly assessed to\n\nthem under these contract provisions.\n\n      Some disagreement, however, existed as to the definition of “chargeback.”\n\nPlaintiffs point to a Factoring Agreement between Sprint and Audiotext which\n\ndefines chargeback as “the amount of any IP Account for any Billing Period\n\nwhich is disputed by an end-user and which is determined by [Sprint] to be\n\nuncollectible.” XIX Aplt. Exh. App. at 4574 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs\n\nmaintain their chargeback damages were based on those instances in which Sprint\n\nfailed to “determine” the charges to be “uncollectible.” Plaintiffs proved this at\n\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\ftrial through Sprint’s witnesses and by offering in evidence the reason code Sprint\n\nlisted next to each chargeback, along with the reason code tables. The reasons for\n\nthe chargebacks indicate many of them—although disputed by the end user—were\n\nnot determined by Sprint to be uncollectible. Plaintiffs’ evidence also indicated\n\nthat callers repeatedly took advantage of their programs, denied all knowledge or\n\nrefused to pay, and requested an adjustment. See I Aplt. Supp. App. at 72–163,\n\nIII Aplt. Supp. App. at 675–822. Although Sprint contends that adjustments were\n\ngranted by LECs, and Sprint was bound by their decisions on billing matters,\n\nSprint’s private arrangements with LECs did not bind the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs’\n\nbilling agreements were with Sprint, and they were entitled to hold Sprint to its\n\nword. Sprint presented its view of chargebacks to the jury, and the jury\n\napparently believed that much of what Sprint failed to collect from end users were\n\nnot “chargebacks” under the IP agreements, and thus not subject to the\n\nchargeback threshold.\n\n      Sprint’s final argument is that the improper submission of fraud claims\n\ntainted the jury’s consideration of the contract claims. This argument fails in the\n\nwake of our holding that the fraud claims were properly submitted to the jury.\n\n      We turn now to the issues raised by Plaintiffs in the main appeal. We\n\nreview for abuse of discretion Connections’ claim that the court erred in refusing\n\nto resubmit to the jury the verdict on its compensatory fraud damages. See Unit\n\n\n                                        - 16 -\n\fDrilling, 108 F.3d at 1192. Although the jury found that Sprint fraudulently\n\ninduced Connections to enter the IP contracts, it entered zero in the space for\n\nConnections’ compensatory fraud damages. On the special verdict form\n\nimmediately following these findings, an interrogatory stated that if the jury had\n\nfound Sprint defrauded Connections, and if it awarded Connections compensatory\n\nfraud damages, then it should decide whether Connections was entitled to punitive\n\ndamages. Although it had not satisfied both parts of the question’s predicate, the\n\njury answered that Connections was entitled to punitive damages. See V Aplt.\n\nApp. at 957-58. When the jury realized that its finding of no compensatory fraud\n\ndamages prevented it from awarding punitive damages to Connections, it wrote\n\nthe court a note:\n\n      it was not our intention to absolve Sprint from punitive damages with\n      regard to Connections’ fraud claim against them—we simply could\n      not decipher the fraud amount asked for. The verdict forms for\n      Connections asked for 7 figures—we were able to derive 6 figures\n      from Art Levinson’s testimony and Exhibit number 1980. Missing\n      was the figure for damages due to fraud. We all agreed to award the\n      entire amounts asked for plus punitive damages . . . . We were not\n      aware that by leaving the fraud amount at zero Sprint would not have\n      to pay punitive damages to Connections.\n\nXII Aplt. App. at 3049.\n\n      Connections argues the special verdict was inconsistent and the court was\n\nrequired to resubmit it to the jury for clarification. See Unit Drilling, 108 F.3d at\n\n1191. In reviewing this claim we must accept any reasonable view of the case\n\n\n                                         - 17 -\n\fthat will conform to the verdict. See Patton v.

We think it clear the jury\n\nsimply failed to follow the court’s instructions in the special interrogatory.\n\nAccording to those instructions the jury’s factual finding of zero compensatory\n\nfraud damages precludes its determination that punitive damages were\n\nappropriate. See Stoddard v. School Dist.

The jury’s misperception of the legal effect of its\n\ncompensatory damages finding provides no basis on which to allow it to alter that\n\nfactual finding. From the jury’s note it is apparent that Connections failed in its\n\nburden of persuasion on this issue, and the court was well within its discretion in\n\nrefusing to send the issue back to the jury.

Ann. § 768.73 by applying it to Audiotext’s award of punitive damages.\n\nSee City of Wichita v. United States Gypsum Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710263\"><a href=\"/opinion/710263/city-of-wichita-kansas-v-united-states-gypsum-company-a-delaware/\"><span class=\"volume\">72</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1495 (10th Cir.\n\n1996). The statute provides:\n\n             (1) (a) In any civil action based on negligence, strict liability,\n      products liability, misconduct in commercial transactions,\n      professional liability, or breach of warranty, and involving willful,\n      wanton, or gross misconduct, the judgment for the total amount of\n      punitive damages awarded to a claimant may not exceed three times\n      the amount of compensatory damages awarded to each person\n      entitled thereto by the trier of fact, except as provided in paragraph\n      (b).\n             (b) If any award for punitive damages exceeds the limitation\n      specified in paragraph (a), the award is presumed to be excessive and\n      the defendant is entitled to remittitur of the amount in excess of the\n      limitation unless the claimant demonstrates to the court by clear and\n      convincing evidence that the award is not excessive in light of the\n      facts and circumstances which were presented to the trier of fact.\n\nFla. Stat. Ann. § 768.73(1)(b) (West 1996). Audiotext raises four arguments on\n\nthis claim. First, it argues its fraudulent inducement claim does not constitute\n\n“misconduct in commercial transactions,” id., and thus the statute does not apply\n\nto its punitive damage award. Second, it argues that even if the statute does\n\napply, the district court erred in trebling only Audiotext’s compensatory fraud\n\ndamages instead of its total compensatory damages in arriving at the statutory\n\ncap. Third, it argues the district court erred in finding it had not rebutted by clear\n\nand convincing evidence the presumption of excessiveness under § 768.73(1)(b).\n\n                                         - 19 -\n\fFourth, it contends that even if the court did not commit a legal error in applying\n\nthe statute, it abused its discretion in denying Audiotext’s motion to alter or\n\namend the judgment by removing the punitive damages cap.\n\n      The statute does not define “misconduct in commercial transactions” and\n\nFlorida courts have not addressed the issue presented to us, but we think the\n\nstatute’s plain meaning covers Sprint’s fraud in its commercial relationship with\n\nAudiotext. The Florida Supreme Court has held that a legitimate objective of\n\n§ 768.73 is to “discourage punitive damage claims.” Gordon v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1842561\"><a href=\"/opinion/1842561/gordon-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">608</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 802 (Fla. 1992), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). It has also held that\n\n“misconduct in commercial transactions” covers intentional torts, in particular the\n\ntort of malicious prosecution. See Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc. v. Mancusi, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1102947\"><a href=\"/opinion/1102947/alamo-rent-a-car-inc-v-mancusi/\"><span class=\"volume\">632</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 1352, 1357-58 (Fla. 1994). In Mancusi, the plaintiff thought he had rented a\n\ncar from Alamo for one month; however the rental contract indicated a rental\n\nperiod of one week. Sometime after the week had elapsed, Alamo had Mancusi\n\narrested and prosecuted. Mancusi sued Alamo for malicious prosecution, won\n\ncompensatory and punitive damage awards, and the Florida Supreme Court held\n\nthat “misconduct in commercial transactions” covered the punitive award. See id.\n\nat 1354-58. 1 We believe this indicates a flexible and common-sense reading of\n\n\n      1\n       Although Audiotext asserts Mancusi’s holding on this point is dictum\nbecause the court ultimately held the statute did not apply retroactively to\nMancusi’s cause of action, we believe it still provides an authoritative indication\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\fthe misconduct phrase. Audiotext argues that because the phrase says\n\n“misconduct in a commercial transaction,” it does not apply to its misconduct\n\nbefore the IP agreements. While this textual argument has appeal, we do not\n\nthink the Florida courts would read the statute in such a technical fashion. The\n\nentire relationship between Sprint and Audiotext was commercial, and we believe\n\ntheir pre-contract negotiations fall within the ordinary meaning of “commercial\n\ntransaction.” In Mancusi, the Court held that an intentional tort which occurred\n\nafter the expiration of the one-week rental contract was “during the course of the\n\ncommercial transaction” and was “the direct result of that commercial\n\ntransaction.” Id. at 1357. Similar logic brings commercial contract negotiations\n\nwithin the scope of the statutory phrase. But Audiotext’s technical argument is\n\nperhaps better met with another: an element of fraudulent inducement is damages,\n\nsee Baker v. United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1142941\"><a href=\"/opinion/1142941/baker-v-united-services-auto-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">661</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 131 (Fla.

Therefore part of Sprint’s\n\nmisconduct occurred “in” the commercial transactions. Audiotext also relies on\n\nScheidt v. Klein, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"577770\"><a href=\"/opinion/577770/william-b-scheidt-and-wanda-c-scheidt-v-william-randolph-klein/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 970 (10th Cir. 1992), in which we included the\n\ndictum “common law fraud does not appear to fall within the explicitly delimited\n\nscope of section 768.73(1) . . . .” Id. Scheidt was decided prior to Mancusi, and\n\n\n\nof how Florida courts would interpret the statute.\n\n                                        - 21 -\n\fthe quoted statement was not necessary to our decision because we held the\n\nargument to which it applied had been waived. See id.\n\n      Audiotext argues next that the district court erred in trebling only its\n\ncompensatory fraud damages and excluding contract damages when calculating\n\nthe punitive damage cap. Audiotext relies on the language of the statute and\n\nChristenson & Assocs. v. Palumbo-Tucker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\n\n1995) for its contention that the total compensatory damage award for all claims\n\nshould have been trebled to calculate the cap. The relevant statutory language\n\nstates: “the total amount of punitive damages awarded to a claimant may not\n\nexceed three times the amount of compensatory damages awarded to each person .\n\n. . .” Fla. Stat. Ann. § 768.73(1)(a). Christenson held that prejudgment interest\n\nshould be included in the compensatory damage award before trebling. See\n\nChristenson, 656 So. 2d at 266 (“Certainly, there is nothing in section 768.73\n\nauthorizing judges to separate the various elements composing the bundle of\n\ncompensatory damages and discard from the punitive damages formula those\n\nelements that the judge personally deems unwise.”). Although Christenson’s\n\nlanguage is broad, it does not support Audiotext’s reading. Section 768.73\n\nappears under the statutory chapter “Torts,” and we believe it must be read in that\n\ncontext. Under Audiotext’s interpretation, unrelated claims compensated in one\n\nlawsuit would all be trebled so long as punitive damages were awarded on one of\n\n\n                                        - 22 -\n\fthe claims. Further, Audiotext’s interpretation would violate Florida’s rule that\n\npunitive damages may not be recovered for breach of contract. See Lewis v.\n\nGuthartz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1800659\"><a href=\"/opinion/1800659/lewis-v-guthartz/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 223 (Fla. 1982). Punitive damages are recoverable for\n\nthe independent tort of fraud, and it is to that claim the statute refers.\n\n      Audiotext next complains that the district court erred in finding it had not\n\nmet its statutory burden of demonstrating to the court by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that the punitive damage award was not excessive. We review the\n\ncourt’s finding for clear error. See FDIC v.

Kan. Stat. Ann. § 16-201 (West 1996) provides:\n\n      Creditors shall be allowed to receive interest . . . for any money after it\n      becomes due; for money lent or money due on settlement of account, from\n      the day of liquidating the account and ascertaining the balance; . . . for\n      money due and withheld by an unreasonable and vexatious delay of\n      payment or settlement of accounts . . . .\n\nId. Plaintiffs argue they are entitled to prejudgment interest on both statutory\n\ngrounds: first, that the contract damages due them were liquidated; second, that\n\nSprint unreasonably and vexatiously withheld payments which were due and\n\nowing to Plaintiffs.\n\n      “A claim becomes liquidated when both the amount due and the date on\n\nwhich it is due are fixed and certain, or when the same become definitely\n\nascertainable by mathematical computation.” Plains Resources, Inc. v.

Disputes as to underlying liability are irrelevant\n\n\n                                        - 24 -\n\fprovided the amount of damages is certain. See Royal College Shop, Inc. v.\n\nNorthern Ins.

The amount of damages\n\nwas the subject of extensive trial testimony and involved complex statistical\n\nprocedures and aggregations, some of which were hotly disputed. Audiotext’s\n\nown representative testified as to how he had arrived at the 73% damage figure\n\nfor excessive chargebacks: “Yeah. What I felt was reasonable is what came out to\n\nabout 73—.” I Aplee. App. at 133. We think it obvious the damages were not\n\nliquidated.\n\n      The trial court has discretionary power to award interest as an element of\n\ndamages even if the primary damages are not liquidated. See Lightcap v. Mobil\n\nOil Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1265995\"><a href=\"/opinion/1265995/lightcap-v-mobil-oil-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (Kan.), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977). Guided by\n\nconsiderations of fairness and equity, such an award is intended to fully\n\ncompensate a party injured through vexatious withholding of monies owed. See\n\nid. at 16. The award is dependent, of course, on the trial court’s discretion, to\n\nwhich we defer because it had the opportunity to scrutinize the evidence, assess\n\ncredibility and probativeness, and balance the equities. See Royal College Shop,\n\n895 F.2d at 675–76. We find no abuse of that discretion.\n\n      Plaintiffs finally argue the district court abused its discretion in awarding\n\nthem a substantially reduced amount of attorney’s fees. The IP agreements\n\nprovided that “[i]n the event of legal action by either of the parties hereto,” the\n\n\n                                         - 25 -\n\fparty in whose favor final judgment is entered is entitled to attorney fees, costs,\n\nand expenses from the losing party. See, e.g., XIX Aplt. Exh. App. at 4596.\n\nPlaintiffs’ counsel requested compensation for 7,160 hours at an average rate of\n\n$236.75, for a total of $1,618,294.49, plus $332,865.55 in expenses. The district\n\ncourt awarded $350,000 in fees and $51,280 in expenses. Plaintiffs protest the\n\ncourt’s decision to award fees only for claims on which they succeeded, its failure\n\nto fully explain its reductions to the fee award, its failure to consider the degree\n\nof success they achieved, and its decision to “simply make a general reduction”\n\ninstead of cutting particularized hours based on specific findings. VIII Aplt. App.\n\nat 2031.\n\n      When a court awards attorney fees pursuant to a contract, as opposed to a\n\nstatute, we have recognized that its duty is to ensure the nonbreaching party is\n\nmade whole and receives the benefit of its bargain. See United States ex rel.\n\nC.J.C., Inc. v. Western States Mechanical Contractors, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498428\"><a href=\"/opinion/498428/the-united-states-of-america-for-the-use-of-cjc-inc-a-new-mexico/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1533</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1547-\n\n48 (10th Cir. 1987). Because these purposes are fundamentally different from\n\nthose underlying statutory fee awards, we have held that the close scrutiny applied\n\nto statutory fee awards should not be applied to contractual awards, see id.; Public\n\nServ. Co. of Colo. v. Continental Cas. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672338\"><a href=\"/opinion/672338/public-service-company-of-colorado-a-colorado-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1508</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1520 & n.11 (10th Cir.\n\n1994), which should be routinely awarded. See Public Serv. Co. of Colo., 26 F.3d\n\nat 1520-21. The trial court’s task is not to fix a reasonable fee, as it is in\n\n\n                                          - 26 -\n\fstatutory awards, but only to determine whether the requested fee is “inequitable\n\nor unreasonable,” in which case it may reduce the fee accordingly. See C.J.C.,\n\nInc., 834 F.2d at 1549. Kansas law governs the contractual award of fees. See\n\nPublic Serv. Co. of Colo., 26 F.3d at 1520.\n\n      The district court properly stated Kansas standards for determining the\n\nreasonableness of the fee, and we cannot find that it abused its discretion in\n\nfixing a rate or in separating reasonable from unreasonable categories of fees.\n\nNor did the court abuse its discretion in declining to give great weight to the\n\nplaintiffs’ degree of success. See C.J.C., Inc., 834 F.2d at 1547-50 (holding court\n\nis not bound to consider federal statutory fee factors). However the court refused\n\nto subtract the categories of unreasonable billings from the total in order to arrive\n\nat a reasonable fee. Instead it simply picked a figure it thought reasonable. We\n\nconsider such a general reduction an abuse of discretion. The court must\n\narticulate some rational method by which it arrives at a reasonable fee. See\n\nC.J.C., Inc., 834 F.2d at 1550 (holding that in contractual fee award “it remains\n\nimportant for the district court to provide a ‘concise but clear explanation’ of its\n\nreasons for any adjustments to the fee award.”) (quoting Mares v. Credit Bureau\n\nof Raton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"476752\"><a href=\"/opinion/476752/caldo-mares-and-sally-mares-his-wife-v-credit-bureau-of-raton-and-janet/\"><span class=\"volume\">801</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1201 (10th Cir.1986) (quoting Hensley v.

App. at 2030, we know of nothing requiring\n\nPlaintiffs to index or segregate their charges for various claims. We have held\n\nthat contractual fee claimants need not meticulously describe each task billed.\n\nSee Public Serv. Co. of Colo., 26 F.3d at 1520 (“While the absence of specific\n\ntask descriptions may preclude an award of fees in cases arising under a federal\n\nfee-shifting statute . . . the same degree of specificity is not required in the\n\ncontext of contractual fee awards.”). Cf. id. at 1521 (holding court need not comb\n\nvoluminous billing records to ferret out certain hours which opposing party\n\ncomplained about but failed to draw to the court’s attention). If the court wishes\n\nto cut time spent on claims which were not ultimately successful, it should do so\n\nand recalculate the fee to arrive at a reasonable figure. See id.
