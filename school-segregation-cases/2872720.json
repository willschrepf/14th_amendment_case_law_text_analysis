Cavanaugh\n    _______________________________________\n\n       Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                   APRIL 20, 2005\n\nBefore: ROTH, MCKEE AND ALDISERT, Circuit Judges.\n\n                (Filed: August 18, 2005)\n\n               _____________________\n\n                     OPINION\n              _______________________\n\fPER CURIAM\n\n       Lorenzo Oliver, an inmate of the East Jersey state prison (EJSP), filed a § 1983\n\ncomplaint in November 2000, which he amended in January 2003, alleging that the\n\ndefendants retaliated against him for filing a civil suit against the New Jersey prison\n\nsystem from March 2000 through May 2000, by (1) preventing him from visiting his sick\n\nmother and from attending her funeral (Count I - defendants Robinson and Cathel); (2)\n\nremoving about $25 from his prison inmate account for commissary items that he never\n\nreceived (Count II - defendant Garrett); (3) subjecting him to torture with an “electrical\n\ndevice” which affected anything made of metal in his cell, including his bunk bed (Count\n\nIII - defendants Moore and Robinson); and (4) filing false disciplinary charges against\n\nhim that were later dismissed (Count IV - defendant Barnes). He claimed that the alleged\n\nelectrical torture by defendants Robinson and Moore also violated his Eighth Amendment\n\nrights and denied him access to the courts. He sought injunctive relief and damages.1\n\n       The defendants moved for summary judgment, claiming non-exhaustion of the\n\nretaliation claims, and that, even assuming exhaustion of the torture claim, it should be\n\ndismissed on its merits. In reply, Oliver argued substantial compliance with the prison’s\n\nadministrative remedy process, contending that he properly exhausted all of his claims,\n\nalthough he did not follow the inmate grievance procedure by using the prescribed\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         By order entered May 29, 2001, the District Court denied Oliver’s motion for a\ninjunctive relief. Oliver is not appealing this order.\n\n                                              2\n\f“administrative remedy form” (ARF) in every instance. He claimed that “it shouldn’t\n\nmatter what particular paper a complaint is written on” as long as the defendants were\n\naware of the alleged constitutional violations. He also claimed that in 1999, he was\n\nplaced in segregation when he attempted to have the ARF signed by the required prison\n\nauthority, and that ever since, he has placed his ARFs in the Administrative mailbox\n\ninstead of delivering them to the custody supervisor. The District Court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of the defendants on Counts I, II, and IV for failure to exhaust and\n\ndismissed those claims without prejudice. The District Court granted summary judgment\n\non the torture claim on the merits, ruling that Oliver failed to produce any evidence to\n\nsuggest that an electrical device was used upon him, or that Moore or Robinson were in\n\nany way involved. Oliver timely appealed.\n\n       We review de novo an order granting summary judgment. Saldana v. K Mart\n\nCorp., 260 F.3d 228, 231 (3d Cir. 2001). Summary judgment is proper when, viewing the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, there is no genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Id. at 232;\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). Once the moving party has carried the initial burden of showing\n\nthat no genuine issue of material fact exists, the “nonmoving party cannot rely upon\n\nconclusory allegations in its pleadings or in memoranda and briefs to establish a genuine\n\nissue of material fact.” Pastore v. Bell Telephone Co. of Pennsylvania, 24 F.3d 508, 511-\n\n12 (3d Cir. 1994). Rather, the nonmoving party “must make a showing sufficient to\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\festablish the existence of every element essential to his case, based on the affidavits or by\n\nthe depositions and admissions on file.” Harter v. GAF Corp., 967 F.2d 846, 852 (3d Cir.\n\n1992).\n\n         We will affirm the District Court’s judgment on Count III substantially for the\n\nreasons set forth in the District Court’s opinion. Oliver admitted in his deposition that he\n\nhad no basis for alleging that Moore or Robinson were involved in his alleged torture\n\nexcept his belief that they were. Oliver’s belief is insufficient evidence to support his\n\nclaim, and thus we find that the District Court properly granted summary judgment in the\n\ndefendants’ favor. As for Counts I, II, and IV, we will affirm the District Court order\n\ngranting summary judgment and dismissing these claims for non-exhaustion, as further\n\ndiscussed below.\n\n         The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PLRA”) prohibits an inmate from\n\nbringing a civil rights suit alleging specific acts of unconstitutional conduct by prison\n\nofficials until the inmate has exhausted available administrative remedies. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997e(a) (2001). The exhaustion requirement of the PLRA applies to grievance\n\nprocedures “regardless of the relief offered by the administrative procedures.” Booth v.\n\nChurner, 523 U.S. 731, 741 (2001); see also Nyhuis v. Reno, 204 F.3d 65, 78 (3d Cir.\n\n2000) (explaining that “the PLRA amended § 1997e(a) in such a way as to make\n\nexhaustion of all administrative remedies mandatory–whether or not they provide the\n\ninmate-plaintiff with the relief he says he desires in his federal action”). A prisoner must\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fproperly exhaust administrative remedies or risk procedural default. See Spruill v. Gillis,\n\n372 F.3d 218 (3d Cir. 2004). To determine whether a prisoner has properly exhausted\n\nadministrative remedies, the court looks to the prison grievance procedure, not federal\n\nlaw. Id. at 231. However, “[c]ompliance with the administrative remedy scheme will be\n\nsatisfactory if it is substantial.” Spruill, 372 F.3d at 232 (quoting Nyhuis, 204 F.3d at 77-\n\n78); Cf. Camp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d 279 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       In support of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants submitted an\n\naffidavit indicating that a search of the files and databases containing ARFs and inmate\n\nrequest forms revealed no such forms from Oliver alleging the same retaliatory acts\n\ncomplained of in this case. The defendants also submitted the affidavit of Terrance\n\nMoore, Administrator of the EJSP, stating that a search of his records revealed no\n\ncorrespondence from Oliver concerning the alleged retaliatory denial of hospital and\n\nfuneral visits, the alleged retaliatory removal of money from Oliver’s prison account, or\n\nthe alleged retaliatory filing of false disciplinary charges. Oliver, however, submitted a\n\nletter to Commissioner Terhune regarding the denial of a hospital visit, stating in\n\npertinent part that “[t]he Administration is retaliating against me for filing a (sic) appeal\n\nat the State Appellate Court in Oliver v. Department of Corrections,” see Appellant’s\n\nBrief at PA 9, letters to Garrett, Moore, and Terhune regarding money taken from his\n\ninmate account in retaliation for his having filed a civil rights complaint in state court, Id.\n\nat PA 12, PA 15, and PA 16, and an incomplete ARF addressed to Moore and dated May\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f24, 2000, regarding false disciplinary charges allegedly imposed to “punish” Oliver for\n\nfiling an answer to the prison’s motion to dismiss his civil rights case, see Oliver\n\nAffidavit in opposition to motion for summary judgment (Docket # 76), at PA 123.\n\n       The Defendants countered that even if the afore-mentioned letters were sent to\n\nGarrett, Moore, and Terhune, they do not comply with the EJSP remedy procedure\n\nbecause he failed to use the proper ARF. They maintain that Oliver has not substantially\n\ncomplied because he failed to file ARFs for Counts I, II, and IV prior to filing suit.\n\nFinally, the defendants contend that the letters do not mention the retaliatory conduct\n\nalleged in the complaint and fail to identify the defendants by name.2\n\n       According to EJSP’s provision in the “Inmate Handbook,” entitled\n\n“Administrative Remedy (Inmate Grievance),” the prison grievance process provides “an\n\navenue for all inmates to express their problems knowing that a complaint will be\n\ninvestigated by an appropriate staff member.” Appellees’ App. at Sa5. The inmate\n\ncompletes a multi-part ARF, and submits the ARF to his custody supervisor, who signs\n\nand dates the ARF and returns a copy of the signed and dated form to the inmate. Id.\n\nEvery attempt at resolving the matter at the housing unit or departmental level should be\n\nmade before resorting to the Administrative Remedy process. Id. The Handbook does\n\nnot provide an investigation process or set any time limits for filing an ARF or for\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         Contrary to the defendants’ assertion, Oliver’s letter/complaints pertaining to\nCounts I, II and IV, all mention retaliation as the motive for the conduct complained of.\n\n                                              6\n\fresponding to one. There is no express provision in the Handbook for appeal or review\n\nby an ultimate administrative authority.3 And, there is no requirement that the inmate\n\nidentify in the ARF the parties against whom he complains.\n\n       The District Court summarily dismissed Counts I, II, and IV without addressing\n\nthe issue of Oliver’s substantial compliance. Oliver’s submissions appear to contradict\n\nthe defendants’ assertions that they did not receive any correspondence with regard to the\n\nincidents alleged in Counts I, II, and IV, and arguably raise a question of fact. Viewing\n\nthe facts in the light most favorable to Oliver and assuming that the letter/complaints were\n\nin fact delivered to their intended recipients, however, we conclude that the\n\nletter/complaints do not constitute substantial compliance because there is no evidence\n\nthat the prison’s administrative remedy was not available.\n\n       The availability of administrative remedies to a prisoner is a question of law. See\n\nRay v. Kertes, 285 F.3d 287, 291 (3d Cir. 2002). The PLRA does not require exhaustion\n\nof all remedies. Rather it requires exhaustion of such administrative remedies “as are\n\navailable.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Camp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d at 281. An administrative\n\nremedy may be found to be unavailable where a prisoner is prevented by prison\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The absence of an express provision detailing a review process apparently has\nresulted in some confusion about the availability of review in this case. Although the\ndefendants maintain that exhaustion of administrative remedy is complete upon the return\nof the ARF by the appropriate supervisor, Oliver is under the impression that he may\nappeal a denial to the Administrator and then to the Commissioner. See Appellant’s\nBrief, at 11.\n\n                                             7\n\fauthorities from pursuing the prison grievance process. See e.g., Camp 219 F.3d at 280-\n\n81 (finding that inmate put on grievance restriction); Brown v. Croak, 312 F.3d 109, 112\n\n(3d Cir. 2002) (noting that prison security officials told inmate he must wait to file a\n\ngrievance until the investigation was complete). And, as we held in Camp, prison\n\nauthorities may also waive the exhaustion requirement if the ultimate administrative\n\nauthority fully examines the inmate’s complaint on the merits, regardless of whether the\n\ncomplaint complied with the prison grievance process or not. See 219 F.2d at 281.\n\n       In Oliver’s case, we find no record evidence indicating that the defendants\n\nprevented him from using the administrative remedy provided in the Inmate Handbook.\n\nOliver claims that he had problems getting his ARF’s filed in 1999, but he does not claim\n\nthat the defendants prevented him from filing ARFs at any time in 2000. In fact, the\n\nrecord shows that Oliver successfully filed ARFs in August 1999, and in April, June,\n\nJuly, August, and September 2000. See Appellees’ App. at Sa10-Sa21. All of the ARFs\n\nwere duly investigated and disposed of by the administrative authority. Id. Because the\n\nHandbook sets no time limit for filing an ARF, it appears that Oliver could have filed\n\nARFs regarding the incidents complained of in Counts I, II, and IV at any time.\n\nUndoubtedly, the EJSP Administrative Remedy process was available to Oliver\n\nthroughout 2000. Moreover, Oliver does not claim, and we find no record evidence that\n\nthe defendants waived the exhaustion requirement by rendering a ruling on the merits of\n\nhis complaints.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\f",

Rather, the nonmoving party “must make a showing sufficient to\n\n\n\n                                             3\n\festablish the existence of every element essential to his case, based on the affidavits or by\n\nthe depositions and admissions on file.” Harter v.

Oliver admitted in his deposition that he\n\nhad no basis for alleging that Moore or Robinson were involved in his alleged torture\n\nexcept his belief that they were. Oliver’s belief is insufficient evidence to support his\n\nclaim, and thus we find that the District Court properly granted summary judgment in the\n\ndefendants’ favor. As for Counts I, II, and IV, we will affirm the District Court order\n\ngranting summary judgment and dismissing these claims for non-exhaustion, as further\n\ndiscussed below.\n\n         The Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (“PLRA”) prohibits an inmate from\n\nbringing a civil rights suit alleging specific acts of unconstitutional conduct by prison\n\nofficials until the inmate has exhausted available administrative remedies. 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1997e(a) (2001). The exhaustion requirement of the PLRA applies to grievance\n\nprocedures “regardless of the relief offered by the administrative procedures.” Booth v.\n\nChurner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 741 (2001); see also Nyhuis v.

A prisoner must\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fproperly exhaust administrative remedies or risk procedural default. See Spruill v.

To determine whether a prisoner has properly exhausted\n\nadministrative remedies, the court looks to the prison grievance procedure, not federal\n\nlaw. Id. at 231. However, “[c]ompliance with the administrative remedy scheme will be\n\nsatisfactory if it is substantial.” Spruill, 372 F.3d at 232 (quoting Nyhuis, 204 F.3d at 77-\n\n78); Cf. Camp v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769513\"><a href=\"/opinion/769513/ronald-camp-v-edward-brennan-superintendent-brooks-deputy-superintendent/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 2000).\n\n       In support of their motion for summary judgment, the defendants submitted an\n\naffidavit indicating that a search of the files and databases containing ARFs and inmate\n\nrequest forms revealed no such forms from Oliver alleging the same retaliatory acts\n\ncomplained of in this case. The defendants also submitted the affidavit of Terrance\n\nMoore, Administrator of the EJSP, stating that a search of his records revealed no\n\ncorrespondence from Oliver concerning the alleged retaliatory denial of hospital and\n\nfuneral visits, the alleged retaliatory removal of money from Oliver’s prison account, or\n\nthe alleged retaliatory filing of false disciplinary charges. Oliver, however, submitted a\n\nletter to Commissioner Terhune regarding the denial of a hospital visit, stating in\n\npertinent part that “[t]he Administration is retaliating against me for filing a (sic) appeal\n\nat the State Appellate Court in Oliver v. Department of Corrections,” see Appellant’s\n\nBrief at PA 9, letters to Garrett, Moore, and Terhune regarding money taken from his\n\ninmate account in retaliation for his having filed a civil rights complaint in state court, Id.\n\nat PA 12, PA 15, and PA 16, and an incomplete ARF addressed to Moore and dated May\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f24, 2000, regarding false disciplinary charges allegedly imposed to “punish” Oliver for\n\nfiling an answer to the prison’s motion to dismiss his civil rights case, see Oliver\n\nAffidavit in opposition to motion for summary judgment (Docket # 76), at PA 123.\n\n       The Defendants countered that even if the afore-mentioned letters were sent to\n\nGarrett, Moore, and Terhune, they do not comply with the EJSP remedy procedure\n\nbecause he failed to use the proper ARF. They maintain that Oliver has not substantially\n\ncomplied because he failed to file ARFs for Counts I, II, and IV prior to filing suit.\n\nFinally, the defendants contend that the letters do not mention the retaliatory conduct\n\nalleged in the complaint and fail to identify the defendants by name.2\n\n       According to EJSP’s provision in the “Inmate Handbook,” entitled\n\n“Administrative Remedy (Inmate Grievance),” the prison grievance process provides “an\n\navenue for all inmates to express their problems knowing that a complaint will be\n\ninvestigated by an appropriate staff member.” Appellees’ App. at Sa5. The inmate\n\ncompletes a multi-part ARF, and submits the ARF to his custody supervisor, who signs\n\nand dates the ARF and returns a copy of the signed and dated form to the inmate. Id.\n\nEvery attempt at resolving the matter at the housing unit or departmental level should be\n\nmade before resorting to the Administrative Remedy process. Id. The Handbook does\n\nnot provide an investigation process or set any time limits for filing an ARF or for\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         Contrary to the defendants’ assertion, Oliver’s letter/complaints pertaining to\nCounts I, II and IV, all mention retaliation as the motive for the conduct complained of.\n\n                                              6\n\fresponding to one. There is no express provision in the Handbook for appeal or review\n\nby an ultimate administrative authority.3 And, there is no requirement that the inmate\n\nidentify in the ARF the parties against whom he complains.\n\n       The District Court summarily dismissed Counts I, II, and IV without addressing\n\nthe issue of Oliver’s substantial compliance. Oliver’s submissions appear to contradict\n\nthe defendants’ assertions that they did not receive any correspondence with regard to the\n\nincidents alleged in Counts I, II, and IV, and arguably raise a question of fact. Viewing\n\nthe facts in the light most favorable to Oliver and assuming that the letter/complaints were\n\nin fact delivered to their intended recipients, however, we conclude that the\n\nletter/complaints do not constitute substantial compliance because there is no evidence\n\nthat the prison’s administrative remedy was not available.\n\n       The availability of administrative remedies to a prisoner is a question of law. See\n\nRay v. Kertes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"777097\"><a href=\"/opinion/777097/frederick-t-ray-v-co-kertes-co-stolz-co-reed-co-rogers-lt-nash/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 291 (3d Cir. 2002). The PLRA does not require exhaustion\n\nof all remedies. Rather it requires exhaustion of such administrative remedies “as are\n\navailable.” 42 U.S.C. § 1997e(a); Camp v. Brennan, 219 F.3d at 281. An administrative\n\nremedy may be found to be unavailable where a prisoner is prevented by prison\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          The absence of an express provision detailing a review process apparently has\nresulted in some confusion about the availability of review in this case. Although the\ndefendants maintain that exhaustion of administrative remedy is complete upon the return\nof the ARF by the appropriate supervisor, Oliver is under the impression that he may\nappeal a denial to the Administrator and then to the Commissioner. See Appellant’s\nBrief, at 11.\n\n                                             7\n\fauthorities from pursuing the prison grievance process. See e.g., Camp 219 F.3d at 280-\n\n81 (finding that inmate put on grievance restriction); Brown v. Croak, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780005\"><a href=\"/opinion/780005/samuel-e-brown-v-paul-croak-food-service-manager-ii-donald-sharpp-food/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112\n\n(3d Cir. 2002) (noting that prison security officials told inmate he must wait to file a\n\ngrievance until the investigation was complete). And, as we held in Camp, prison\n\nauthorities may also waive the exhaustion requirement if the ultimate administrative\n\nauthority fully examines the inmate’s complaint on the merits, regardless of whether the\n\ncomplaint complied with the prison grievance process or not. See 219 F.2d at 281.\n\n       In Oliver’s case, we find no record evidence indicating that the defendants\n\nprevented him from using the administrative remedy provided in the Inmate Handbook.\n\nOliver claims that he had problems getting his ARF’s filed in 1999, but he does not claim\n\nthat the defendants prevented him from filing ARFs at any time in 2000. In fact, the\n\nrecord shows that Oliver successfully filed ARFs in August 1999, and in April, June,\n\nJuly, August, and September 2000. See Appellees’ App. at Sa10-Sa21. All of the ARFs\n\nwere duly investigated and disposed of by the administrative authority. Id. Because the\n\nHandbook sets no time limit for filing an ARF, it appears that Oliver could have filed\n\nARFs regarding the incidents complained of in Counts I, II, and IV at any time.\n\nUndoubtedly, the EJSP Administrative Remedy process was available to Oliver\n\nthroughout 2000. Moreover, Oliver does not claim, and we find no record evidence that\n\nthe defendants waived the exhaustion requirement by rendering a ruling on the merits of\n\nhis complaints.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fFor the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n\n\n\n                                     9\n\f</pre>",
