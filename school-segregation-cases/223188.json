Based on the Supreme Court's opinion in Lodge, we vacated our prior decision and held that the at-large system for electing Escambia County commissioners violated the fourteenth amendment.

Under this system candidates run for numbered places corresponding to the districts in which they live, but each must be elected by the voters of the entire county.  There is no majority-vote requirement for the general election, although candidates must obtain a majority of the votes cast in the party primaries to win party nomination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As of the date of trial, four blacks had run for the county commission, none of whom had been elected.  Plaintiffs brought this action claiming that the county's at-large election system unconstitutionally dilutes their votes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that blacks comprise seventeen percent of the registered voters of Escambia County and that in elections in which black candidates had run for the County Commission there had been a consistent pattern of racially polarized voting.  The court found that the at-large system, coupled with the above factors, prevented black candidates from obtaining a majority of the votes in the County Commission elections.  Having concluded that the at-large system had such discriminatory effect, the district court considered whether its purpose was discriminatory.  Although the court found that the at-large system had not been enacted for a discriminatory purpose, it concluded that the scheme had been maintained for such a purpose.  In finding intentional discrimination, the court relied on a variety of factors, including the adverse effects of past discrimination by the state and county governments on blacks' exercise of their suffrage rights and participation in the political system, the depressed socioeconomic status of blacks in the county, the tenuousness of the state policy behind the at-large system, and other features of the election system that enhanced its discriminatory effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our prior decision, we determined that the evidence in the record fully supported the district court's factual findings.   Escambia II, 688 F.2d at 969.  We again make this finding.  Our task, then, is to apply the factual findings of the district court to the recently amended Voting Rights Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. APPLICATION OF SECTION 2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, Congress amended section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1973, to read as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) No voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied by any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, as provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) A violation of (a) of this section is established if, based on the totality of the circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class of citizens protected by subsection (a) of this section in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.  The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered:  Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case of first impression.  In both United States v. Dallas County Commission, 739 F.2d 1529 (11th Cir.1984), and United States v. Marengo County Commission, 731 F.2d 1546 (11th Cir.1984), appeal dismissed, cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 105 S.Ct. 375, 83 L.Ed.2d 371 (1984), the Eleventh Circuit has applied the amended section 2 to claims of voter dilution as a result of at-large election systems.  Thus, many of the preliminary issues in this case have already been resolved.  We have held that section 2 is constitutional under Congress' enforcement power under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, Marengo 731 F.2d at 1556-63;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  that section 2 applies to voter dilution cases, id. at 1555-56;  and that the amended version of section 2 applies to cases, such as this, commenced prior to passage of the amendment.   Id. at 1553-55;  see also Dallas, 739 F.2d at 1534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Marengo court fully delineated the standard for assessing alleged violations under the amended section 2.  The court stated:  \"Congress wished to eliminate any intent requirement from section 2, and therefore changed the terms of Sec. 2(a), 42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1973(a) (West Supp.)  (1983), to forbid any practice that 'results in' discrimination.\"    Id. at 1563.  The amendment intended \"to restore the legal standard that governed voter discrimination decisions before the Supreme Court decided Mobile v. Bolden.\"    Id. at 1550 (footnote omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   The Marengo court summarized the new test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language and history of the statute make clear several points.  First, discriminatory intent need not be shown to establish a violation.  Second, at-large elections are not prohibited per se, nor does a lack of proportional representation automatically require a finding of a violation.  At the same time, however, the absence of minority elected officials may be considered as an indicium of violation, and an at-large system will violate the statute if it results in a denial of equal participation.  Congress noted that some at-large systems diluted black votes, and would be vulnerable under the amended statute.  1982 Senate Report at 6.  Third, section 2 focuses not on whether minority groups receive adequate public services but on whether minorities have an equal right to participate in the political process.  See id. at 36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Senate Report gives particular approval to the jurisprudence developed by the former Fifth Circuit in cases immediately following White v. Regester [412 U.S. 755, 93 S.Ct. 2332, 37 L.Ed.2d 314 (1973) ] most notably Zimmer v. McKeithen, 5 Cir.1973, 485 F.2d 1297 (en banc ), aff'd per curiam sub nom.  East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall, 1976, 424 U.S. 636, 96 S.Ct. 1083, 47 L.Ed.2d 296.    Zimmer listed a number of factors to be considered in dilution cases.

Racially Polarized Voting</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although no factor is indispensable, the legislative history of the amendment to section 2 indicates that racially polarized voting will ordinarily be the keystone of a dilution case.    Marengo at 1566.  Defendants contend that voting in Escambia County is not polarized.  This contention is not supported by the evidence.  As we stated in Escambia II:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that blacks constitute twenty percent of the population and seventeen percent of the registered voters of Escambia County.  Although black citizens had run for County Commission on four occasions, no black candidate had ever won an election.  None of the blacks who ran was able to obtain the majority votes necessary to win the Democratic primary.  The court found that in each of the cases in which a black candidate ran for County Commission the voting had been severely polarized along racial lines.  In other words, \"whenever a black challenges a white for countywide office, a consistent majority of the whites who vote will consistently vote for the black's opponent.  [\"  McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla., PCA No. 77-0432, slip op. at 12.]  The court found that the numerical minority of blacks coupled with the white block vote prevented blacks from obtaining a majority of votes in the county.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 965-66.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also assert that prior voting statistics are the result of the failure of blacks to nominate outstanding black candidates or any black person since 1970.  As noted in both Marengo and Dallas, \"the failure of the blacks to solicit white votes may be caused by the effects of past discrimination ....\"  Dallas County, 739 F.2d at 1536;  accord Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1567.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p>B.

As stated by the Marengo court:A history of discrimination is important evidence of both discriminatory intent and discriminatory results.  A history of pervasive purposeful discrimination may provide strong circumstantial evidence that the present-day acts of elected officials are motivated by the same purpose, or by a desire to perpetuate the effects of that discrimination.   Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279.  Under the results test, the inquiry is more direct:  past discrimination can severely impair the present-day ability of minorities to participate on an equal footing in the political process.  Past discrimination may cause blacks to register or vote in lower numbers than whites.  Past discrimination may also lead to present socioeconomic disadvantages, which in turn can reduce participation and influence in political affairs.   See Zimmer, 485 F.2d at 1306.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">731 F.2d at 1567 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the present case, the district court found that the County Commission and School Board election systems \"had their genesis in the midst of a concerted state effort to institutionalize white supremacy.\"    McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla., PCA No. 77-0432, slip op. at 4 (N.D.Fla., July 10, 1978).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, discrimination against minorities outside of the electoral system cannot be ignored in assessing that system.  When there is clear evidence of present socioeconomic or political disadvantage resulting from past discrimination, the burden is on defendants to show that reduced political participation is the result of something besides this discrimination.

The court below found plentiful evidence of such discrimination.  State-enforced segregation has created two separate societies in Escambia County in which churches, clubs, neighborhoods and, until recently, schools in the county have remained segregated by race.  The lower court found that this \"continued separation [of blacks] from the dominant white society\" not only has \"left blacks in an inferior social and economic position, with generally inferior education,\" but has \"helped reduce black voting strength and participation in government.\"    McMillan v.

Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1571.  Defendants claim that the at-large system is preferable because it makes the commission responsive to the needs of the whole county.  The district court found, however, that \"the residence district of each commissioner is more or less regarded as the district of that commissioner for which he has responsibility and for whose needs he is the particular advocate on the commission.\"    McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla., PCA No. 77-0432, slip op. at 30.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a>   Thus, the district court concluded that the policy behind the at-large system for electing county commissioners is tenuous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>E.

In addition, prior to this litigation, no black had been elected to the Escambia County School Board<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> and only two blacks had been elected to the Pensacola City Council.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that black access to the political process is evidenced by the fact that twenty percent of the Escambia County Democratic Executive Committee is black.  This committee, however, is elected from districts (precincts) rather than at-large.  Thus, we agree with plaintiffs that the racial composition of the Democratic committee shows that the election structure does make a difference.  Nor does the fact that no black ran for the Commission between 1970 and the time this litigation commenced, help defendants.  Rather, the lack of black candidates is a likely result of a racially discriminatory system.    See McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla., PCA No. 77-0432, slip op. at 10.

Other Factors</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not find three of the \"typical factors\" listed in the Senate Report:  denial of access to a slating process;  overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns;  a significant lack of responsiveness on the part of elected officials to the particular needs of the members of the minority group.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a>   The district court also found no significant difference currently existing between black and white voter registration.  The lower court, however, found that \"other barriers ... effectively operate to preclude access for blacks.\"    McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla., PCA No. 77-0432, slip op. at 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lack of these factors, however, does not lead this court to hold for the defendants.  In Marengo, the court found no slating process working against plaintiffs.  The Marengo court also found no evidence of racial appeals, but noted that \"[i]n the seventies overt political racism was less prevalent than in the sixties\" yet, \"the continuing effects of past discrimination are still with us.\"    731 F.2d at 1571.  Thus, absence of such evidence of discrimination \"should not weigh heavily against a plaintiff proceeding under the results test of section 2.\"    Id.  Similarly, while responsiveness is an important factor under the intent test it \"is considerably less important under the results test.\"   Id. at 1572.   See N.A.A.C.P. v. Gadsden County, 691 F.2d 978, 983 (11th Cir.1982).  There are two reasons for this:  \"First, Sec. 2 protects the access of minorities not simply to the fruits of government but to participation in the process itself....  Second, responsiveness is a highly subjective matter, and the subjectivity is at odds with the emphasis of section 2 on objective factors.\"   Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1572.  See also S.Rep. No. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 29, n. 116, reprinted in 1982 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Ad.News 207 n. 116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of these, or any other, factors is not conclusive under the section 2 \"totality of the circumstances\" test.  As the Marengo court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>No formula for aggregating the factors applies in every case.  Some authorities suggest that a finding of discriminatory result is compelled when the plaintiffs show racially polarized voting combined with an absence of minority elected officials.   See NAACP v. Gadsden County, 691 F.2d at 982-83;  Note, The Constitutional Significance of the Discriminatory Effects of At-Large Elections, 91 Yale L.J. 974, 998 (1982).  Others have argued that discriminatory effect is irrebuttably established when these factors are combined with a history of discrimination and present socioeconomic disparities between races.    See Blacks United For Lasting Leadership, Inc. v. City of Shreveport, 5th Cir.1978, 571 F.2d 248, 257, (Wisdom, J., dissenting);  Hartman, [Racial Vote Dilution and Separation of Powers:  An Explanation of the Conflict Between the Judicial \"Intent\" and the Legislative \"Results\" Standards ] 50 Geo.Wash.L.Rev.  [689,] 729-32 [ (1982) ].  Certainly, when the plaintiffs established these factors and no others weigh strongly against the plaintiffs' case, dilution must be found.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">731 F.2d at 1574.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs in the present case have, indeed, shown that these factors are present, as well as the other indications of discriminatory result discussed in this opinion.  We agree with the district court that \"[i]n sum, a preponderance of the evidence shows that the election system of the board of county commissioners effectively dilutes the votes of black citizens.\"    McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla., PCA No. 77-0432, slip op. at 32.  Thus, we find that the record shows a clear violation of the results test adopted by Congress in section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, this court already has determined that the at-large election system was maintained for a discriminatory purpose and thus violated the fourteenth amendment.   Escambia II, 688 F.2d at 969.  This showing of intent is sufficient to constitute a violation of section 2 just as we found that it was sufficient to constitute a violation of the fourteenth amendment.  The results test of section 2 was intended to be a less stringent standard that substantially lessened the burdens on plaintiffs.  Moreover, Congress intended that fulfilling either the more restrictive intent test or the results test would be sufficient to show a violation of section 2.  The Senate Report states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p>The amendment to the language of Section 2 is designed to make clear that plaintiffs need not prove discriminatory purpose in the adoption or maintenance of the challenged system or practice in order to establish a violation.

Although Lodge reaffirmed the holding of Bolden that evidence of purposeful discrimination is required to sustain an equal protection challenge to an election system, it reflected a more favorable view of the Zimmer factors and a greater deference to the findings of the district court than did the analysis of the Bolden plurality.   Escambia II, 688 F.2d at 964-65</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The original complaint in this case listed as defendants Escambia County and the members of the Board of County Commissioners, individually and in their official capacities.  During the course of the litigation three of the commissioners were replaced by gubernatorial appointments.  In 1983, all five incumbent commissioners ran for election or reelection pursuant to the single-member district plan ordered by the district court.  Four of the incumbents were defeated.  The new commissioners took office on November 15, 1983.  On December 1, 1983 the Commission voted 3-2 to direct the Commission's attorneys to substitute the new commissioners into the litigation and to file motions to withdraw from the case.  On January 5, 1984, the Commission voted 3-2 to adopt an election plan which, in relevant aspects, is identical to the court-ordered plan</p>\n        <p>This course of events raised numerous questions as to who had standing to pursue this appeal and whether the appeal is now moot.  We find, however, that the plain words of the Supreme Court's opinion, Escambia County, Fla. v. McMillan, --- U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct. 1577, 80 L.Ed.2d 36 (1984), are controlling.</p>\n        <p>In note 1 the Court stated that \"[o]nly former and present individual members of the Board are now before the Court as appellants.\"    Id.  The Court elaborated in note 4:</p>\n        <p>Aside from the two present commissioners who dissented from [the Board's vote to dismiss the appeal] ... several former commissioners, who lost their seats in the subsequent court-ordered election, remain before the Court.  Contrary to appellees' contention, the former commissioners were not automatically dismissed as appellants when they left office, and the Jurisdictional Statement did not limit them to participation in the appeal in their \"official capacity.\"    Juris. Statement 1.</p>\n        <p>Id. 104 S.Ct. at 1578.  Thus, the county qua county is no longer a party to this litigation, notwithstanding the fact that the county was awarded costs in the Supreme Court for its prior involvement in this litigation.</p>\n        <p>The Supreme Court also determined that this case was not moot, stating:</p>\n        <p>Appellees have not suggested that the appeal is moot as to the issues of liability or that appellants have no live interest in the controversy.</p>\n        <p>Appellees do contend that the issue of appropriate remedy is moot, a contention that we need not reach in light of our disposition of the case.</p>\n        <p>Id.  Likewise, this court is only concerned with liability and does not reach the question of remedy which is being appealed separately and is still pending in this court, No. 83-3275.</p>\n        <p>Appellants also claim that appellees should be \"stayed from litigating this case\" until they pay the judgment for costs awarded against them by the Supreme Court.  This argument is not supported by the precedent put forth in appellants' brief.  Moreover, appellants are the moving party;  appellees cannot be barred from submitting responsive briefs.  In addition, staying the litigation would only preserve the status quo, a situation favored by the appellees not the appellants.</p>\n        <p>For these reasons, we reach the merits of this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The full background of this case is set out in this court's two vacated opinions, Escambia I, 638 F.2d 1239, and Escambia II, 688 F.2d 960.

Under this system candidates run for numbered places corresponding to the districts in which they live, but each must be elected by the voters of the entire county.  There is no majority-vote requirement for the general election, although candidates must obtain a majority of the votes cast in the party primaries to win party nomination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As of the date of trial, four blacks had run for the county commission, none of whom had been elected.

The court found that the at-large system, coupled with the above factors, prevented black candidates from obtaining a majority of the votes in the County Commission elections.  Having concluded that the at-large system had such discriminatory effect, the district court considered whether its purpose was discriminatory.  Although the court found that the at-large system had not been enacted for a discriminatory purpose, it concluded that the scheme had been maintained for such a purpose.  In finding intentional discrimination, the court relied on a variety of factors, including the adverse effects of past discrimination by the state and county governments on blacks' exercise of their suffrage rights and participation in the political system, the depressed socioeconomic status of blacks in the county, the tenuousness of the state policy behind the at-large system, and other features of the election system that enhanced its discriminatory effect.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our prior decision, we determined that the evidence in the record fully supported the district court's factual findings.

APPLICATION OF SECTION 2</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1982, Congress amended section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.

The extent to which members of a protected class have been elected to office in the State or political subdivision is one circumstance which may be considered:  Provided, That nothing in this section establishes a right to have members of a protected class elected in numbers equal to their proportion in the population.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is not a case of first impression.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></span> (1984), the Eleventh Circuit has applied the amended section 2 to claims of voter dilution as a result of at-large election systems.  Thus, many of the preliminary issues in this case have already been resolved.  We have held that section 2 is constitutional under Congress' enforcement power under the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments, Marengo 731 F.2d at 1556-63;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  that section 2 applies to voter dilution cases, id. at 1555-56;  and that the amended version of section 2 applies to cases, such as this, commenced prior to passage of the amendment.   Id. at 1553-55;  see also Dallas, 739 F.2d at 1534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Marengo court fully delineated the standard for assessing alleged violations under the amended section 2.  The court stated:  \"Congress wished to eliminate any intent requirement from section 2, and therefore changed the terms of Sec. 2(a), 42 U.S.C.A. Sec. 1973(a) (West Supp.)  (1983), to forbid any practice that 'results in' discrimination.\"    Id. at 1563.  The amendment intended \"to restore the legal standard that governed voter discrimination decisions before the Supreme Court decided Mobile v. Bolden.\"    Id. at 1550 (footnote omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a>   The Marengo court summarized the new test:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language and history of the statute make clear several points.  First, discriminatory intent need not be shown to establish a violation.  Second, at-large elections are not prohibited per se, nor does a lack of proportional representation automatically require a finding of a violation.  At the same time, however, the absence of minority elected officials may be considered as an indicium of violation, and an at-large system will violate the statute if it results in a denial of equal participation.  Congress noted that some at-large systems diluted black votes, and would be vulnerable under the amended statute.  1982 Senate Report at 6.

Marengo at 1566.  Defendants contend that voting in Escambia County is not polarized.  This contention is not supported by the evidence.  As we stated in Escambia II:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that blacks constitute twenty percent of the population and seventeen percent of the registered voters of Escambia County.  Although black citizens had run for County Commission on four occasions, no black candidate had ever won an election.  None of the blacks who ran was able to obtain the majority votes necessary to win the Democratic primary.  The court found that in each of the cases in which a black candidate ran for County Commission the voting had been severely polarized along racial lines.  In other words, \"whenever a black challenges a white for countywide office, a consistent majority of the whites who vote will consistently vote for the black's opponent.  [\"  McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla., PCA No. 77-0432, slip op. at 12.]  The court found that the numerical minority of blacks coupled with the white block vote prevented blacks from obtaining a majority of votes in the county.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 965-66.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also assert that prior voting statistics are the result of the failure of blacks to nominate outstanding black candidates or any black person since 1970.

As stated by the Marengo court:A history of discrimination is important evidence of both discriminatory intent and discriminatory results.

Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. at 624, 102 S.Ct. at 3279.  Under the results test, the inquiry is more direct:  past discrimination can severely impair the present-day ability of minorities to participate on an equal footing in the political process.  Past discrimination may cause blacks to register or vote in lower numbers than whites.  Past discrimination may also lead to present socioeconomic disadvantages, which in turn can reduce participation and influence in political affairs.

The court below found plentiful evidence of such discrimination.  State-enforced segregation has created two separate societies in Escambia County in which churches, clubs, neighborhoods and, until recently, schools in the county have remained segregated by race.  The lower court found that this \"continued separation [of blacks] from the dominant white society\" not only has \"left blacks in an inferior social and economic position, with generally inferior education,\" but has \"helped reduce black voting strength and participation in government.\"    McMillan v.

Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1571.  Defendants claim that the at-large system is preferable because it makes the commission responsive to the needs of the whole county.

This committee, however, is elected from districts (precincts) rather than at-large.  Thus, we agree with plaintiffs that the racial composition of the Democratic committee shows that the election structure does make a difference.  Nor does the fact that no black ran for the Commission between 1970 and the time this litigation commenced, help defendants.  Rather, the lack of black candidates is a likely result of a racially discriminatory system.    See McMillan v. Escambia County, Fla., PCA No. 77-0432, slip op. at 10.

In Marengo, the court found no slating process working against plaintiffs.  The Marengo court also found no evidence of racial appeals, but noted that \"[i]n the seventies overt political racism was less prevalent than in the sixties\" yet, \"the continuing effects of past discrimination are still with us.\"    731 F.2d at 1571.  Thus, absence of such evidence of discrimination \"should not weigh heavily against a plaintiff proceeding under the results test of section 2.\"    Id.  Similarly, while responsiveness is an important factor under the intent test it \"is considerably less important under the results test.\"   Id. at 1572.   See N.A.A.C.P. v.

There are two reasons for this:  \"First, Sec. 2 protects the access of minorities not simply to the fruits of government but to participation in the process itself....  Second, responsiveness is a highly subjective matter, and the subjectivity is at odds with the emphasis of section 2 on objective factors.\"   Marengo, 731 F.2d at 1572.  See also S.Rep.

This showing of intent is sufficient to constitute a violation of section 2 just as we found that it was sufficient to constitute a violation of the fourteenth amendment.  The results test of section 2 was intended to be a less stringent standard that substantially lessened the burdens on plaintiffs.  Moreover, Congress intended that fulfilling either the more restrictive intent test or the results test would be sufficient to show a violation of section 2.

During the course of the litigation three of the commissioners were replaced by gubernatorial appointments.  In 1983, all five incumbent commissioners ran for election or reelection pursuant to the single-member district plan ordered by the district court.  Four of the incumbents were defeated.  The new commissioners took office on November 15, 1983.  On December 1, 1983 the Commission voted 3-2 to direct the Commission's attorneys to substitute the new commissioners into the litigation and to file motions to withdraw from the case.  On January 5, 1984, the Commission voted 3-2 to adopt an election plan which, in relevant aspects, is identical to the court-ordered plan</p>\n        <p>This course of events raised numerous questions as to who had standing to pursue this appeal and whether the appeal is now moot.

The Court elaborated in note 4:</p>\n        <p>Aside from the two present commissioners who dissented from [the Board's vote to dismiss the appeal] ... several former commissioners, who lost their seats in the subsequent court-ordered election, remain before the Court.  Contrary to appellees' contention, the former commissioners were not automatically dismissed as appellants when they left office, and the Jurisdictional Statement did not limit them to participation in the appeal in their \"official capacity.\"    Juris. Statement 1.</p>\n        <p>Id. 104 S.Ct. at 1578.  Thus, the county qua county is no longer a party to this litigation, notwithstanding the fact that the county was awarded costs in the Supreme Court for its prior involvement in this litigation.</p>\n        <p>The Supreme Court also determined that this case was not moot, stating:</p>\n        <p>Appellees have not suggested that the appeal is moot as to the issues of liability or that appellants have no live interest in the controversy.</p>\n        <p>Appellees do contend that the issue of appropriate remedy is moot, a contention that we need not reach in light of our disposition of the case.</p>\n        <p>Id.  Likewise, this court is only concerned with liability and does not reach the question of remedy which is being appealed separately and is still pending in this court, No. 83-3275.</p>\n        <p>Appellants also claim that appellees should be \"stayed from litigating this case\" until they pay the judgment for costs awarded against them by the Supreme Court.  This argument is not supported by the precedent put forth in appellants' brief.  Moreover, appellants are the moving party;  appellees cannot be barred from submitting responsive briefs.
