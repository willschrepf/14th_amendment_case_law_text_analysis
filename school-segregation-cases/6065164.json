The district court, relying on the\n\ndiscussion of speculative injury from Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, 133 S. Ct.\n\n1138 (2013), held that the allegations in the complaint were too speculative to establish\n\nArticle III standing. We conclude that Clapper’s analysis of speculative injury does not\n\ncontrol this case, since the central allegations here are not speculative. Accordingly, as\n\nfor Wikimedia, we vacate and remand because it makes allegations sufficient to survive a\n\nfacial challenge to standing. As for the other Plaintiffs, we affirm because the complaint\n\ndoes not contain enough well-pleaded facts entitled to the presumption of truth to\n\nestablish their standing.\n\n\n\n                                            I.\n\n                                           A.\n\n       Before diving into the details of Plaintiffs’ complaint, we provide an overview of\n\nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq., the statute\n\nfrom which the government derives its authority to conduct Upstream surveillance.\n\n       Congress enacted FISA in 1978 to regulate electronic surveillance undertaken to\n\ngather foreign intelligence information. David S. Kris & J. Douglas Wilson, National\n\nSecurity Investigations and Prosecutions § 3:8 (2d ed.), Westlaw (database updated Aug.\n\n2016) (hereinafter Kris & Wilson); see also 50 U.S.C. § 1801 (defining electronic\n\n\n                                            4\n\fsurveillance).    FISA created two specialized courts—the Foreign Intelligence\n\nSurveillance Court (the “FISC”), from which the government generally must obtain\n\nauthorization before conducting electronic surveillance, and the Foreign Intelligence\n\nSurveillance Court of Review, which has jurisdiction to review the denial of a FISA\n\napplication for electronic surveillance. Kris & Wilson § 5:1. As originally enacted,\n\nFISA required the government to demonstrate probable cause to believe that the target of\n\nits surveillance was “a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,” and that the facility\n\nor place at which surveillance would be directed was “being used, or is about to be used,\n\nby a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.” 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2); see also\n\nKris & Wilson § 7:2.\n\n       “Until 2008, FISA applied only to investigative conduct inside the United States.”\n\nKris & Wilson § 4:2. That changed through the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which\n\nauthorized the government to acquire foreign-intelligence information by targeting for up\n\nto one year non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be abroad. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.\n\nFISA Section 702, 50 U.S.C. § 1881a, sets forth the process for obtaining that authority.\n\n       Generally, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence initiate\n\nthe process by submitting a “certification” regarding the proposed surveillance to the\n\nFISC for approval. Id. § 1881a(g)(1)(A). That certification must attest, inter alia, that:\n\n       (1) procedures are in place “that . . . are reasonably designed” to ensure that\n       an acquisition is “limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be\n       located outside” the United States; (2) minimization procedures adequately\n       restrict the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of nonpublic\n       information about unconsenting U.S. persons . . .; (3) guidelines have been\n       adopted to ensure compliance with targeting limits and the Fourth\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Amendment; and (4) the procedures and guidelines . . . comport with the\n       Fourth Amendment.\n\nClapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1145 (quoting 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(g)(2)).\n\n       The FISC reviews the certification to ensure that it contains the statutorily required\n\nelements and has targeting and minimization procedures that are both consistent with the\n\nFourth Amendment and are “reasonably designed” to meet certain requirements. Id. In\n\nparticular, the FISC must find that the targeting procedures are “reasonably designed” to:\n\n(i) ensure that acquisition “is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be\n\nlocated outside the United States,” and (ii) “prevent the intentional acquisition of” wholly\n\ndomestic communications. 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i)(2)(B). The FISC must also find that the\n\nminimization procedures are “reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique\n\nof the particular surveillance, to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the\n\ndissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United\n\nStates persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and\n\ndisseminate foreign intelligence information.” Id. § 1801(h)(1); see id. § 1881a(i)(2)(C)\n\n(referring to § 1801(h)).\n\n       Section 702 prohibits the intentional targeting of “any person known at the time of\n\nacquisition to be located in the United States,” id. § 1881a(b), but allows the government\n\nto intercept communications between a U.S. person inside the country and a foreigner\n\nabroad targeted by intelligence officials, see id. § 1881a(a)–(b); see also Kris & Wilson\n\n§ 17:5. Furthermore, surveillance under Section 702 may be conducted for purposes\n\nother than counterterrorism—the statute defines “foreign intelligence information” to\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fmean, among other things, information that relates to “the conduct of the foreign affairs\n\nof the United States,” 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e)(2)(B)—and the government need not identify\n\n“the specific facilities, places, premises, or property at which” it will direct surveillance,\n\nid. § 1881a(g)(4).\n\n       The absence of particularity and probable cause requirements in Section 702\n\nsurveillance allows the government to monitor the communications of thousands of\n\nindividuals and groups under a single FISC Order. See Office of the Director of National\n\nIntelligence, Calendar Year 2014 Statistical Transparency Report 1–2 (2015) (stating\n\nthat in 2014 the government used its authority pursuant to Section 702 to target an\n\nestimated 92,707 persons, groups, and entities under one FISC Order). 1 Furthermore, the\n\nminimization procedures allow the government to retain communications—including\n\nthose of U.S. persons—if the government concludes that they contain “foreign\n\nintelligence” information. See Kris & Wilson §§ 9:5, 17:5.\n\n       The government has acknowledged that it conducts two forms of surveillance\n\nunder Section 702—PRISM and Upstream. See Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight\n\nBoard, Report on the Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to Section 702 of the\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act 7 (2014) (hereinafter PCLOB Report). 2            Only\n\nUpstream is at issue here. Though the government has disclosed some information about\n\n\n\n\n       1\n           Plaintiffs’ complaint incorporates this document.\n       2\n           Plaintiffs’ complaint incorporates this report.\n\n\n                                                7\n\fUpstream, most technical details of the surveillance process remain classified. See Jewel\n\nv. Nat’l Sec. Agency, 810 F.3d 622, 627 (9th Cir. 2015).\n\n                                           B.\n\n      In June 2015, Plaintiffs—educational, legal, human rights, and media\n\norganizations—filed their first amended complaint wherein they ask for, among other\n\nthings, a declaration that Upstream surveillance violates the First and Fourth\n\nAmendments, an order permanently enjoining the NSA from conducting Upstream\n\nsurveillance, and an order directing the NSA “to purge all records of Plaintiffs’\n\ncommunications in their possession obtained pursuant to Upstream surveillance.” J.A.\n\n84.\n\n      Plaintiffs make two central allegations.      First, in what we refer to as the\n\nWikimedia Allegation, Wikimedia alleges that “the sheer volume of [its] communications\n\nmakes it virtually certain that the NSA has intercepted, copied, and reviewed at least\n\nsome of [its] communications.” 3 J.A. 46. Second, in what we refer to as the Dragnet\n\nAllegation, all nine Plaintiffs allege that in the course of conducting Upstream\n\nsurveillance the NSA is “intercepting, copying, and reviewing substantially all” text-\n\nbased communications entering and leaving the United States, including their own. J.A.\n\n46.   After setting forth supporting background relevant to each, we describe the\n\nWikimedia and Dragnet Allegations.\n\n\n\n      3\n          Though all nine Plaintiffs made this allegation, only Wikimedia pursues it on\nappeal.\n\n\n                                            8\n\f                                             1.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that “Upstream surveillance involves the NSA’s seizing and\n\nsearching the [I]nternet communications of U.S. citizens and residents en masse as those\n\ncommunications travel across the [I]nternet ‘backbone’ in the United States.” J.A. 40.\n\n“The [I]nternet backbone is the network of high-capacity cables, switches, and routers\n\n[administered by telecommunications-service providers] that facilitates both domestic\n\nand international communication via the [I]nternet.”               J.A. 40.    It includes “the\n\napproximately 49 international submarine cables that carry [I]nternet communications\n\ninto and out of the United States and that land at approximately 43 different points within\n\nthe country.” J.A. 42.\n\n       The NSA performs Upstream surveillance by first identifying a target and then\n\nidentifying “selectors” for that target. Selectors are the specific means by which the\n\ntarget communicates, such as e-mail addresses or telephone numbers. Selectors cannot\n\nbe keywords (e.g., “bomb”) or names of targeted individuals (e.g., “Bin Laden”).\n\n       The     NSA   then   “tasks”    selectors     for   collection    and   sends   them to\n\ntelecommunications-service providers. Those providers must assist the government in\n\nintercepting   communications    to,    from,       or   “about”   the   selectors.    “About”\n\ncommunications are those that contain a tasked selector in their content, but are not to or\n\nfrom the target. “For instance, a communication between two third parties might be\n\nacquired because it contains a targeted email address in the body of the communication.”\n\nPCLOB Report at 119.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f      We note an important distinction between Internet transactions and Internet\n\ncommunications.       While Upstream surveillance “is intended to acquire Internet\n\ncommunications, it does so through the acquisition of Internet transactions.” PCLOB\n\nReport at 39. An example illustrates the point. When an individual sends an email on the\n\nInternet, the message is broken up into one or more “data packets” which are transmitted\n\nacross the Internet backbone to their destination and, upon arrival, reassembled by the\n\nrecipient’s computer to reconstruct the communication. The individual data packets\n\ngenerated by a single email can take “different routes [across the backbone] to their\n\ncommon destination.”         PCLOB Report at 125.           Relatedly, when two people\n\ncommunicate, the data packets from the target can take a different path along the\n\nbackbone than the data packets to the target. “The government describes an Internet\n\n‘transaction’ as ‘a complement of packets traversing the Internet that together may be\n\nunderstood by a device on the Internet and, where applicable, rendered in an intelligible\n\nform to the user of that device.’” Redacted, 2011 WL 10945618, at *9 n.23 (FISA Ct.\n\nOct. 3, 2011) (quoting a government submission to the FISC). 4 An Internet transaction\n\ncan comprise one or many discrete communications.\n\n      “To identify and acquire Internet transactions associated with the Section 702-\n\ntasked selectors on the Internet backbone, Internet transactions are first filtered to\n\neliminate potential domestic transactions, and then are screened to capture only\n\ntransactions containing a tasked selector. Unless transactions pass both these screens,\n\n\n      4\n          Plaintiffs’ complaint incorporates this FISC opinion.\n\n\n                                             10\n\fthey are not ingested into government databases.” PCLOB Report at 37. “If a single\n\ndiscrete communication within [a multi-communication transaction] is to, from, or about\n\na Section 702-tasked selector, and at least one end of the transaction is foreign, the NSA\n\nwill acquire the entire [multi-communication transaction].” PCLOB Report at 39. Once\n\nacquired, communications are subject to FISC-approved minimization procedures. The\n\nNSA’s minimization procedures, for example, limit the types of queries that analysts can\n\nconduct across data sets of Section 702-acquired information.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that Upstream surveillance works in practice as follows. First, the\n\nNSA copies “substantially all international text-based communications—and many\n\ndomestic ones—flowing across certain high-capacity cables, switches, and routers” by\n\n“[u]sing surveillance devices installed at key access points along the [I]nternet\n\nbackbone.” J.A. 43. Second, it “attempts to filter out and discard some wholly domestic\n\ncommunications,” though that effort “is incomplete.” J.A. 43. Third, it reviews the full\n\ncontent of the copied communications for targeted selectors, including IP addresses. J.A.\n\n43. Finally, it “retains [and with few restrictions analyzes] all communications that\n\ncontain selectors associated with its targets, as well as those that happen to be bundled\n\nwith them in transit.” J.A. 44.\n\n                                            2.\n\n       Wikimedia asserts that the NSA is intercepting, copying, and reviewing at least\n\nsome of its communications in the course of Upstream surveillance, “even if the NSA\n\nconducts Upstream surveillance on only a single [I]nternet backbone link.” J.A. 49.\n\nWikimedia, “the operator of one of the most-visited websites in the world,” alleges that it\n\n\n                                            11\n\f“engages in more than one trillion international communications each year, with\n\nindividuals who are located in virtually every country on earth.” J.A. 56. According to\n\nWikimedia, Upstream surveillance implicates three categories of its communications:\n\n(1) communications with its community members; (2) internal “log” communications,\n\nwhich include users’ IP addresses and the URLs of webpages sought by users; and\n\n(3) communications between its staff and individuals around the world. J.A. 55–56.\n\n      Wikimedia further alleges that “[g]iven the relatively small number of\n\ninternational chokepoints,” 5 the volume of its communications, and the geographical\n\ndiversity of the people with whom it communicates, its “communications almost certainly\n\ntraverse every international backbone link connecting the United States with the rest of\n\nthe world.” J.A. 47–48. And, Wikimedia alleges, “in order for the NSA to reliably\n\nobtain communications to, from, or about its targets in the way it has described, the\n\ngovernment must be copying and reviewing all the international text-based\n\ncommunications that travel across a given link.” J.A. 48.\n\n      That last allegation is so, says Wikimedia, because “as a technical matter, the\n\ngovernment cannot know beforehand which communications will contain selectors\n\nassociated with its targets, and therefore it must copy and review all international text-\n\nbased communications transiting [a] circuit in order to identify those of interest.” J.A.\n\n48. That is because data packets that constitute a communication “travel independently\n\n\n      5\n        By “chokepoint,” Wikimedia refers to the 49 international submarine cables and\nthe “limited number” of terrestrial cables that carry Internet communications into and out\nof the United States. J.A. 47–48.\n\n\n                                           12\n\fof one another, intermingled with packets of other communications in the stream of\n\ndata,” and “the packets of interest cannot be segregated from other, unrelated packets in\n\nadvance.” J.A. 49. Thus, the NSA must “copy all such packets traversing a given\n\nbackbone link, so that it can reassemble and review the transiting communications.” J.A.\n\n49.\n\n       Tying these allegations together, Wikimedia asserts that if the NSA is monitoring\n\na single [I]nternet backbone link, then the NSA is intercepting, copying, and reviewing at\n\nleast some of Wikimedia’s communications. According to Wikimedia, “the NSA has\n\nconfirmed that it conducts Upstream surveillance at more than one point along the\n\n[I]nternet backbone.” J.A. 49. In addition to the PCLOB Report’s confirmation of the\n\nprogram’s existence, Wikimedia points to a purported NSA slide which shows that a\n\nsingle telecommunications-service provider is facilitating Upstream surveillance at\n\n“seven major international chokepoints in the United States” and a purported NSA\n\ndocument which states that the NSA is expending significant resources to “create\n\ncollection/processing capabilities at many of the chokepoints operated by U.S.\n\nproviders.” J.A. 50–51.\n\n       Wikimedia has “an acute privacy interest in its communications” because its\n\n“mission and existence depend on its ability to ensure that readers and editors can explore\n\nand contribute to [its websites] privately when they choose to do so.” J.A. 59–60. It has,\n\nin response to Upstream surveillance, taken burdensome steps to protect “the privacy of\n\nits communications and the confidentiality of the information it thereby receives.” J.A.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f60–61.        Among other things, Wikimedia has “self-censor[ed] communications or\n\nforgo[ne] electronic communications altogether.” J.A. 64.\n\n         Finally, the first amended complaint alleges that “even if one assumes a\n\n0.00000001% chance . . . of the NSA copying and reviewing any particular\n\ncommunication, the odds of the government copying and reviewing at least one of the\n\nPlaintiffs’     communications   in   a   one-year   period   would   be    greater   than\n\n99.9999999999%.” J.A. 46–47. This is an extension of the allegation that Wikimedia\n\nengages in more than one trillion international communications each year.\n\n                                            3.\n\n         In the Dragnet Allegation, Plaintiffs say that “given the way the government has\n\ndescribed Upstream surveillance, it has a strong incentive to intercept communications at\n\nas many backbone chokepoints as possible.” J.A. 49. Thus, “[i]f the government’s aim is\n\nto ‘comprehensively’ and ‘reliably’ obtain communications to, from, and about targets\n\nscattered around the world, it must conduct Upstream surveillance at many different\n\nbackbone chokepoints.” J.A. 50.\n\n         Plaintiffs allege that the nature of online communication, including that data\n\npackets to a target can take different routes than data packets from a target, makes this\n\nconclusion “especially true.” J.A. 50. They also incorporate into their complaint a New\n\nYork Times article asserting that the NSA “is temporarily copying and then sifting\n\nthrough the contents of what is apparently most e-mails and other text-based\n\ncommunications that cross the border.” J.A. 51.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f       Furthermore, Plaintiffs often communicate with individuals whom the NSA is\n\nlikely to target through Upstream surveillance, and “[a] significant amount of the\n\ninformation that [they] exchange over the [I]nternet is ‘foreign intelligence information.’”\n\nJ.A. 52. “Because of ongoing government surveillance, including Upstream surveillance,\n\nPlaintiffs have had to take burdensome and sometimes costly measures to” protect “the\n\nconfidentiality of their sensitive information.” J.A. 52. Upstream surveillance compels\n\nthem to censor their own communications and, in some instances, to forgo electronic\n\ncommunications altogether.\n\n       Finally, Joshua Dratel, a member of Plaintiff National Association of Criminal\n\nDefense Lawyers, also challenges Upstream surveillance. One of Dratel’s clients “has\n\nreceived notice of [Section 702 surveillance], and [Dratel] previously represented a client\n\nin another case where officials have told Congress that the government used [Section 702\n\nsurveillance] in the course of its investigation.” J.A. 68–69.\n\n                                             C.\n\n       The government moved to dismiss for lack of standing and submitted evidence,\n\nincluding declarations by Robert Lee and Alan Salzberg. The Lee Declaration challenges\n\nPlaintiffs’ assertion that, as a technical matter, the NSA must be copying all data packets\n\nthat traverse a given backbone link.        The Salzberg Declaration attacks Plaintiffs’\n\nprobability calculation that there’s a greater than 99.9999999999% chance that the NSA\n\nis copying and reviewing their communications.\n\n       The district court, relying on Clapper, held that Plaintiffs had failed to establish\n\nstanding because their allegations “depend on suppositions and speculation, with no basis\n\n\n                                             15\n\fin fact, about how the NSA implements Upstream surveillance.” J.A. 190. The court\n\ncharacterized the government’s motion as a facial challenge, and thus did not consider\n\neither declaration. Because so much of the district court’s opinion depends on Clapper,\n\nwe summarize that case first.\n\n                                             1.\n\n        In Clapper, plaintiffs (including six of the nine Plaintiffs here, but not including\n\nDratel or Wikimedia) lodged a facial challenge to Section 702 on the day that the law\n\nwent into effect, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 133 S. Ct. at 1145–46. They\n\nalleged that their work required them to “engage in sensitive and sometimes privileged\n\ntelephone and e-mail communications with . . . individuals located abroad” who were\n\n“likely targets of surveillance under” Section 702. Id. at 1145. Plaintiffs had two\n\nseparate theories of Article III standing: (1) there was an “objectively reasonable\n\nlikelihood” that their communications would be intercepted in the future pursuant to\n\nSection 702 surveillance, and (2) they were forced to undertake costly and burdensome\n\nmeasures to avoid a substantial risk of surveillance. Id. at 1146. They did not, however,\n\nhave “actual knowledge of the Government’s [Section 702] targeting practices.” Id. at\n\n1148.\n\n        The Supreme Court held that neither injury established standing at the summary\n\njudgment stage.     The theory of standing based on interception of communications\n\n“relie[d] on a highly attenuated chain of possibilities, [which did] not satisfy the\n\nrequirement that threatened injury must be certainly impending.” Id. at 1147–48. The\n\nCourt broke the speculative chain into five parts:\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       (1) the Government will decide to target the communications of non-U.S.\n       persons with whom [plaintiffs] communicate; (2) in doing so, the\n       Government will choose to invoke its authority under [Section 702] rather\n       than utilizing another method of surveillance; (3) the Article III judges who\n       serve on the [FISC] will conclude that the Government’s proposed\n       surveillance procedures satisfy [Section 702’s] many safeguards and are\n       consistent with the Fourth Amendment; (4) the Government will succeed in\n       intercepting the communications of [plaintiffs’] contacts; and (5)\n       [plaintiffs] will be parties to the particular communications that the\n       Government intercepts.\n\nId. at 1148.\n\n       “[A]t the summary judgment stage,” the Court noted, plaintiffs “can no longer rest\n\non mere allegations [to establish standing], but must set forth by affidavit or other\n\nevidence specific facts.”    Id. at 1148–49 (alteration and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The Clapper plaintiffs, however, had no “specific facts demonstrating that the\n\ncommunications of their foreign contacts w[ould] be targeted.” Id. at 1149.\n\n       The assertion of harm based on measures taken to avoid surveillance also didn’t\n\nsuffice. Because “the harm [plaintiffs] s[ought] to avoid [wa]s not certainly impending,”\n\nthe Court explained, they couldn’t “manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on\n\nthemselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm.” Id. at 1151. In other\n\nwords, plaintiffs had failed to show that “[a]ny ongoing injuries” they were suffering\n\nwere “fairly traceable” to Section 702 surveillance. Id. The Court suggested, however,\n\nthat a lawyer who represented a target of Section 702 surveillance might have standing.\n\nId. at 1154.\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f                                             2.\n\n       Applying these principles, the district court in this case reasoned that while\n\n       more is known about the nature and capabilities of NSA surveillance than\n       was known at the time of Clapper, . . . no more is known about whether\n       Upstream surveillance actually intercepts all or substantially all\n       international text-based Internet communications, including plaintiffs’\n       communications. . . . Indeed, plaintiffs’ reliance on the government’s\n       capacity and motivation to collect substantially all international text-based\n       Internet communications is precisely the sort of speculative reasoning\n       foreclosed by Clapper.\n\nJ.A. 192. The court supported that conclusion with two observations relevant here: (1) it\n\nis unclear whether the NSA is “using [its] surveillance equipment to its full potential” to\n\nintercept “all communications passing through” chokepoints upon which the NSA has\n\ninstalled surveillance equipment, and (2) “the fact that all NSA surveillance practices\n\nmust survive FISC review . . . suggests that the NSA is not using its surveillance\n\nequipment to its full potential.” J.A. 190–91.\n\n       The district court also rejected the argument that Clapper “does not control here\n\nbecause plaintiffs are different from the Clapper plaintiffs.” J.A. 194. The court focused\n\non Dratel and Wikimedia. With respect to Dratel, the court concluded that the allegations\n\nfailed to “plausibly establish that the information gathered from the two instances of\n\nSection 702 surveillance was the product of Upstream surveillance,” and that it “appears\n\nsubstantially more likely that PRISM collection was used in [those] cases.” J.A. 195.\n\n       As for Wikimedia, the court found that “the statistical analysis on which the\n\nargument rests [(i.e., the probability calculation that there’s a greater than\n\n99.9999999999% chance that the NSA is copying and reviewing Wikimedia’s\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fcommunications)] is incomplete and riddled with assumptions,” and that “[l]ogically\n\nantecedent to plaintiffs’ flawed statistical analysis are plaintiffs’ speculative claims about\n\nUpstream surveillance based on limited knowledge of Upstream surveillance’s technical\n\nfeatures and ‘strategic imperatives.’” 6 See J.A. 197–99.\n\n       From the district court’s dismissal of their complaint for lack of standing,\n\nPlaintiffs appeal.\n\n\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We review the district court’s decision de novo, Columbia Gas Transmission\n\nCorp. v. Drain, 237 F.3d 366, 369 (4th Cir. 2001), and proceed as follows. First, we lay\n\nout the framework for deciding whether a plaintiff has established standing at the motion-\n\nto-dismiss stage.    Then, we review the Wikimedia and Dragnet Allegations to see\n\nwhether either establishes standing. We conclude that the Wikimedia Allegation does\n\nand the Dragnet Allegation does not.\n\n                                             A.\n\n                                              1.\n\n       Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to “Cases”\n\nand “Controversies.” U.S. Const. art. III, § 2. “The doctrine of standing gives meaning\n\nto these constitutional limits by ‘identify[ing] those disputes which are appropriately\n\n\n       6\n         The “speculative claims” that the court referred to all relate to Wikimedia’s\nallegation that the NSA is “using Upstream surveillance to copy all or substantially all\ncommunications passing through” chokepoints which the NSA surveils. J.A. 199.\n\n\n                                             19\n\fresolved through the judicial process.’” Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 134 S. Ct.\n\n2334, 2341 (2014) (alteration in original) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\n\nU.S. 555, 560 (1992)). To establish standing, a plaintiff must show: (1) an injury in fact;\n\n(2) a sufficient causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of; and\n\n(3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Id.\n\n       “To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered ‘an\n\ninvasion of a legally protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or\n\nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.’” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540,\n\n1548 (2016) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). “For an injury to be particularized, it must\n\naffect the plaintiff in a personal and individual way.” Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). “The fact that an injury may be suffered by a large number of people does not\n\nof itself make that injury a nonjusticiable generalized grievance.” Id. at 1548 n.7. The\n\npurpose of the imminence requirement “is to ensure that the alleged injury is not too\n\nspeculative for Article III purposes.” Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1147. The “threatened injury\n\nmust be certainly impending to constitute injury in fact, and . . . [a]llegations of possible\n\nfuture injury are not sufficient.” Id. (second alteration in original) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n       “[E]ach element [of standing] must be supported in the same way as any other\n\nmatter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree\n\nof evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561.\n\n“A defendant may challenge [standing at the motion-to-dismiss stage] in one of two\n\nways: facially or factually.” Beck v. McDonald, 848 F.3d 262, 270 (4th Cir. 2017). In a\n\n\n                                             20\n\ffacial challenge, the defendant contends that the complaint “fails to allege facts upon\n\nwhich [standing] can be based,” and the plaintiff “is afforded the same procedural\n\nprotection” that exists on a motion to dismiss. Adams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th\n\nCir. 1982).    In a factual challenge, the defendant contends “that the jurisdictional\n\nallegations of the complaint [are] not true.” Id. In that event, a trial court may look\n\nbeyond the complaint “and in an evidentiary hearing determine if there are facts to\n\nsupport the jurisdictional allegations.” Id.\n\n       “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual\n\nmatter, accepted as true, ‘to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft\n\nv. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,\n\n570 (2007)). We accept as true all well-pleaded facts in a complaint and construe them in\n\nthe light most favorable to the plaintiff. SD3, LLC v. Black & Decker (U.S.) Inc., 801\n\nF.3d 412, 422 (4th Cir. 2015). Indeed, a court cannot “favor[] its perception of the\n\nrelevant events over the narrative offered by the complaint,” thereby “recasting\n\n‘plausibility’ into ‘probability.’” Id. at 430. However, legal conclusions pleaded as\n\nfactual allegations, “unwarranted inferences,” “unreasonable conclusions,” and “naked\n\nassertions devoid of further factual enhancement” are not entitled to the presumption of\n\ntruth. Id. at 422.\n\n                                               2.\n\n       The Third Circuit recently applied many of these principles in Schuchardt v.\n\nPresident of the United States, where it held that, “at least as a facial matter,” a complaint\n\nchallenging PRISM surveillance—the other form of publicly acknowledged Section 702\n\n\n                                               21\n\fsurveillance—“plausibly stated an injury in fact” sufficient to establish standing. 839\n\nF.3d 336, 338 (3d Cir. 2016). Under PRISM surveillance, the government purportedly\n\nobtains “user communications exchanged using services provided by several large U.S.\n\ncompanies” directly from those companies’ servers. Id. at 340.\n\n       Schuchardt’s central allegation was that the NSA is “intercepting, monitoring and\n\nstoring the content of all or substantially all of the e-mail sent by American citizens, [and\n\nthus] his own online communications had been seized in the dragnet.”             Id. at 341\n\n(emphasis omitted). In support of that allegation, Schuchardt stated that he used online\n\nservices targeted by PRISM surveillance and incorporated into his complaint “excerpts of\n\nthe classified materials” made public through newspaper articles and filings in other\n\ncases. Id. at 341. The complaint and its exhibits described the “technical means through\n\nwhich PRISM purportedly achieves a nationwide email dragnet” and were “replete with\n\ndetails confirming PRISM’s operational scope and capabilities.” Id. at 350.\n\n       For example, a slide from a purported NSA presentation “identif[ied] company\n\nnames and the dates they began cooperating with” the NSA, while another exhibit\n\n“indicate[d] . . . that the degree of access those providers granted enables the Government\n\nto query their facilities at will for ‘real-time interception of an individual’s [I]nternet\n\nactivity.’” Id. at 349–50 (citations omitted). Another purported NSA slide “confirm[ed]\n\nthat—consistent with a dragnet capturing ‘all or substantially all of the e–mail sent by\n\nAmerican citizens’—the scale of the data collected by PRISM is so vast that the\n\nGovernment reported difficulty processing it according ‘to the norms’ to which [it has]\n\nbecome accustomed.” Id. at 350 (alteration in original) (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                             22\n\f      The Third Circuit bifurcated its analysis. First, it found Schuchardt’s allegations\n\nsufficiently particularized to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.     Id. at 345–46.\n\nThough PRISM surveillance is “universal in scope,” the harm that Schuchardt alleged\n\nwas “unmistakably personal”—“he ha[d] a constitutional right to maintain the privacy of\n\nhis personal communications, online or otherwise.” Id. Moreover, “the fact that [many\n\nothers] may share a similar interest d[id] not change [the injury’s] individualized nature\n\nbecause Schuchardt’s allegations ma[de] clear that he [wa]s among the persons” targeted\n\nby PRISM. Id. at 346 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Second, the court credited Schuchardt’s allegations as true for the purpose of\n\nresolving the facial challenge to his complaint. Id. at 346–50. The level of detail in the\n\ncomplaint—sufficient to describe “the technical means through which PRISM\n\npurportedly” functions and to “confirm[] PRISM’s operational scope and capabilities”—\n\nmade his allegation about “the Government’s virtual dragnet” plausible. Id. at 349–50.\n\nIn doing so, the Third Circuit made clear that Schuchardt’s reliance on exhibits was not\n\ndisfavored, and that “[d]espite Clapper’s observation that the standing inquiry is\n\n‘especially rigorous’ in matters touching on ‘intelligence gathering and foreign affairs,’”\n\nit knew of no instance where a court had “imposed a heightened pleading standard for\n\ncases implicating national security,” and thus “assume[d] without deciding that” one did\n\nnot apply. Id. at 348 n.8, 348–49 (quoting Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1147).\n\n      We find the Third Circuit’s approach persuasive and bifurcate our analyses of the\n\nWikimedia and Dragnet Allegations in similar fashion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\f                                             B.\n\n                                              1.\n\n       As a reminder, the Wikimedia Allegation is that the NSA is intercepting, copying,\n\nand reviewing at least some of Wikimedia’s communications in the course of Upstream\n\nsurveillance, “even if the NSA conducts Upstream surveillance on only a single [I]nternet\n\nbackbone link.” J.A. 49.\n\n       We conclude that this allegation satisfies the three elements of Article III standing.\n\nWe begin with injury in fact. See Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (defining injury in fact as\n\nthe invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or\n\nimminent). The allegation that the NSA is intercepting and copying communications\n\nsuffices to show an invasion of a legally protected interest—the “Fourth Amendment\n\nright to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.” Schuchardt, 839 F.3d at 353;\n\nsee also Am. Civil Liberties Union v. Clapper, 785 F.3d 787, 801 (2d Cir. 2015) (holding\n\nat motion-to-dismiss stage that complaint challenging NSA’s bulk telephone metadata\n\ncollection program established standing to assert a Fourth Amendment violation where\n\nalleged injury was “collection, and maintenance in a government database, of records\n\nrelating to” plaintiffs).\n\n       The injury is also concrete and particularized, despite “[t]he fact that [it is]\n\nsuffered by a large number of people,” because Wikimedia says that the NSA is seizing\n\nits own communications through Upstream surveillance. See Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548\n\nn.7; accord Schuchardt, 839 F.3d at 346. And, finishing up with the injury-in-fact\n\nelement, the injury “is not too speculative for Article III purposes.” Clapper, 133 S. Ct.\n\n\n                                             24\n\fat 1147. Indeed, there’s nothing speculative about it—the interception of Wikimedia’s\n\ncommunications is an actual injury that has already occurred.\n\n       The Wikimedia Allegation also satisfies the other two elements of Article III\n\nstanding. Upstream surveillance is the direct cause of the alleged injury, and there’s no\n\nreason to doubt that the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would redress the\n\nharm. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61 (providing that the injury must be “fairly traceable”\n\nto the conduct complained of and “likely” to be redressed by a favorable decision).\n\n       However, just because this allegation satisfies the elements of Article III standing\n\ndoesn’t mean that we must accept it as true for the purpose of resolving the government’s\n\nfacial challenge to the complaint. Thus, we proceed to the second part of our analysis to\n\ndecide whether the Wikimedia Allegation is plausible.\n\n       Wikimedia alleges three key facts that are entitled to the presumption of truth.\n\nFirst, “[g]iven the relatively small number of international chokepoints,” the volume of\n\nWikimedia’s communications, and the geographical diversity of the people with whom it\n\ncommunicates,    Wikimedia’s     “communications     almost     certainly   traverse   every\n\ninternational backbone link connecting the United States with the rest of the world.” J.A.\n\n47–48. 7\n\n\n       7\n          On appeal, Wikimedia attempts to rephrase this allegation so that it reads,\n“Wikimedia’s communications traverse every major [I]nternet circuit entering or leaving\nthe United States.” Appellants’ Br. at 24. We look, however, to the wording of the\ncomplaint. That said, the plausibility pleading regime doesn’t automatically invalidate\nallegations that contain probabilistic-sounding words. For the purpose of deciding\nwhether the Wikimedia Allegation is plausible, we find this supporting allegation, based\nas it is upon other factual allegations, to be well-pleaded. Indeed, Wikimedia need only\n(Continued)\n\n                                            25\n\f       Second, “in order for the NSA to reliably obtain communications to, from, or\n\nabout its targets in the way it has described, the government,” for technical reasons that\n\nWikimedia goes into at length, “must be copying and reviewing all the international text-\n\nbased communications that travel across a given link” upon which it has installed\n\nsurveillance equipment. J.A. 48. Because details about the collection process remain\n\nclassified, Wikimedia can’t precisely describe the technical means that the NSA employs.\n\nInstead, it spells out the technical rules of how the Internet works and concludes that,\n\ngiven that the NSA is conducting Upstream surveillance on a backbone link, the rules\n\nrequire that the NSA do so in a certain way.\n\n       We would never confuse the plausibility of this conclusion with that accorded to\n\nNewton’s laws of motion. But accepting the technical rules about the Internet as true,\n\nand given that Wikimedia is applying them in an appropriate context (i.e., it uses the rules\n\nto explain the technical means through which Upstream surveillance functions), we find\n\nthis conclusion reasonable and entitled to the presumption of truth.\n\n       Third, per the PCLOB Report and a purported NSA slide, “the NSA has confirmed\n\nthat it conducts Upstream surveillance at more than one point along the [I]nternet\n\nbackbone.” J.A. 49–51. Together, these allegations are sufficient to make plausible the\n\nconclusion that the NSA is intercepting, copying, and reviewing at least some of\n\n\n“state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Construing, as we must, all well-pleaded facts in the light\nmost favorable to Wikimedia, SD3, 801 F.3d at 422, Wikimedia’s claim that its\n“communications almost certainly traverse” every chokepoint is enough to satisfy the\nplausibility requirement. J.A. 48.\n\n\n                                            26\n\fWikimedia’s communications. To put it simply, Wikimedia has plausibly alleged that its\n\ncommunications travel all of the roads that a communication can take, and that the NSA\n\nseizes all of the communications along at least one of those roads.\n\n       Thus, at least at this stage of the litigation, Wikimedia has standing to sue for a\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment. And, because Wikimedia has self-censored its\n\nspeech and sometimes forgone electronic communications in response to Upstream\n\nsurveillance, it also has standing to sue for a violation of the First Amendment. See Am.\n\nCivil Liberties Union, 785 F.3d at 802 (holding that complaint established standing to\n\nassert First Amendment violation in addition to Fourth Amendment violation because\n\n“[w]hen the government collects appellants’ metadata, appellants’ members’ interests in\n\nkeeping their associations and contacts private are implicated, and any potential ‘chilling\n\neffect’ is created at that point”); see also Cooksey v. Futrell, 721 F.3d 226, 235 (4th Cir.\n\n2013) (“In First Amendment cases, the injury-in-fact element is commonly satisfied by a\n\nsufficient showing of self-censorship, which occurs when a claimant is chilled from\n\nexercising his right to free expression.”) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n\n                                             2.\n\n       The government resists this conclusion, asserting that the Wikimedia Allegation\n\n“rest[s] on speculation as to the scope and scale of Upstream collection, and the means by\n\nwhich that collection is accomplished.” Appellees’ Br. at 23. The district court said\n\nmuch the same, and the best way to address this contention is by examining the ways in\n\nwhich that court misapplied Clapper’s discussion of speculative injury.\n\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\f       Unlike in Clapper, where the plaintiffs based their theories of standing on\n\nprospective or threatened injury and actions taken in response thereto, Wikimedia\n\npleaded an actual and ongoing injury, which renders Clapper’s certainly-impending\n\nanalysis inapposite here. Compare Schuchardt, 839 F.3d at 351 (distinguishing Clapper\n\nand its discussion of a “speculative chain of possibilities” because plaintiff’s “alleged\n\n[Fourth Amendment] injury has already occurred insofar as he claims the NSA seized his\n\nemails”), with Beck, 848 F.3d at 267–69, 274–75 (applying Clapper’s certainly\n\nimpending standard to a motion to dismiss an action under the Privacy Act of 1974, and\n\nfinding plaintiff’s allegation that “her information ‘will eventually be misused as a result\n\nof’” a data breach that compromised her personal information too speculative to establish\n\nstanding).\n\n       In other words, the Wikimedia Allegation is different in kind than the facts (or\n\nlack thereof) alleged in Clapper to establish standing at summary judgment. That brings\n\nus to our next point. By relying so heavily on Clapper, the district court blurred the line\n\nbetween the distinct burdens for establishing standing at the motion-to-dismiss and\n\nsummary-judgment stages of litigation.        Put another way, what may perhaps be\n\nspeculative at summary judgment can be plausible on a motion to dismiss.\n\n       For example, the district court characterized Wikimedia’s allegations as\n\n“speculative” based upon its own observation that it’s unclear whether the NSA is “using\n\n[its] surveillance equipment to its full potential” to intercept “all communications passing\n\nthrough” chokepoints upon which the NSA has installed surveillance equipment. J.A.\n\n190, 198–99. That observation might be appropriate with the benefit of an evidentiary\n\n\n                                            28\n\frecord at summary judgment, but coming as it did on a motion to dismiss, it had the\n\neffect of rejecting Wikimedia’s well-pleaded allegations and impermissibly injecting an\n\nevidentiary issue into a plausibility determination. See Schuchardt, 839 F.3d at 347–48\n\n(citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); SDR, 801 F.3d at 431.\n\n       The district court made the same mistake by speculating that “the fact that all NSA\n\nsurveillance practices must survive FISC review . . . suggests that the NSA is not using\n\nits surveillance equipment to its full potential.” J.A. 190–91. Wikimedia’s reliance at the\n\nmotion-to-dismiss stage on publicly disclosed information about Upstream surveillance,\n\npurported NSA documents, technical rules about how the Internet works, and its\n\nunderstanding of its own operations is not, as the district court put it, “precisely the sort\n\nof speculative reasoning foreclosed by” Clapper’s discussion of how much factual\n\nmaterial is necessary to satisfy the certainly-impending prong of the injury-in-fact\n\nelement of Article III standing at summary judgment. J.A. 192. 8\n\n       That’s not to say that all of Wikimedia’s allegations as to injury are both plausible\n\nand actual or imminent. For example, the district court was right to take issue with\n\nWikimedia’s probability calculation, which “is incomplete and riddled with\n\nassumptions.” J.A. 197. But we need not look further into that allegation’s deficiencies,\n\nbecause Wikimedia doesn’t need it to establish standing.\n\n       We also reject the government’s argument that Wikimedia hasn’t pleaded enough\n\nfacts to establish injury flowing from its intercepted communications. To the contrary,\n\n       8\n        Like the Third Circuit, we assume without deciding that a heightened pleading\nstandard does not apply to national security cases.\n\n\n                                             29\n\fWikimedia’s detailed allegations suffice to plausibly establish cognizable injuries under\n\nthe First and Fourth Amendments. See Rakas v. Illinois, 439 U.S. 128, 140 (1978)\n\n(providing that the “definition of [Fourth Amendment] rights is more properly placed\n\nwithin the purview of substantive Fourth Amendment law than within that of standing”);\n\nCooksey, 721 F.3d at 235 (“The leniency of First Amendment standing manifests itself\n\nmost commonly in the doctrine’s first element: injury-in-fact.”). At this stage of the\n\nlitigation, that is enough.\n\n       Finally, we decline the government’s invitation to consider its evidence, including\n\nthe two declarations, which it says “supports the district court’s analysis and undermines\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations about how they surmise Upstream surveillance operates.”\n\nAppellees’ Br. at 23. The district court treated the government’s motion to dismiss as a\n\nfacial challenge to the complaint and didn’t consider the government’s evidence. We will\n\nfollow suit and not look beyond the complaint and documents incorporated by reference\n\ntherein. See Beck, 848 F.3d at 270 (explaining the differences between facial and factual\n\nchallenges to standing). The government is free to bring a factual challenge on remand,\n\nwhere the district court in the first instance may consider Wikimedia’s argument—should\n\nit choose to raise it again—that the intertwined nature of the jurisdictional and merits\n\nquestions precludes such a challenge. 9\n\n\n\n\n       9\n       We decline to decide whether Wikimedia has established third-party standing.\nWikimedia may, of course, raise that argument on remand.\n\n\n                                           30\n\f                                             ***\n\n       We now turn to the Dragnet Allegation, which is that the NSA is “intercepting,\n\ncopying, and reviewing substantially all” text-based communications entering and\n\nleaving the United States. J.A. 46. The district court arrived at the correct conclusion as\n\nto whether this allegation establishes standing, but only by incorrectly analogizing to\n\nClapper. As we explain below, the reason this allegation fails to establish standing is that\n\nit does not contain enough well-pleaded facts entitled to the presumption of truth.\n\n                                             C.\n\n                                              1.\n\n       The Dragnet and Wikimedia Allegations share much in common. Because each\n\nalleges the same particularized and ongoing cognizable injuries, our analysis of the\n\ninjury-in-fact, traceability, and redressability elements of Article III standing with respect\n\nto the Wikimedia Allegation also applies here. But there’s a key difference in the scope\n\nof the two allegations. In the Dragnet Allegation, Plaintiffs must plausibly establish that\n\nthe NSA is intercepting “substantially all” text-based communications entering and\n\nleaving the United States, whereas it’s sufficient for purposes of the Wikimedia\n\nAllegation to show that the NSA is conducting Upstream surveillance on a single\n\nbackbone link. Because Plaintiffs don’t assert enough facts about Upstream’s operational\n\nscope to plausibly allege a dragnet, they have no Article III standing.\n\n       In support of a dragnet and in addition to the assertions in the Wikimedia\n\nAllegation, Plaintiffs allege the following: (1) “given the way the government has\n\ndescribed Upstream surveillance,” including that its “aim is to ‘comprehensively’ and\n\n\n                                             31\n\f‘reliably’ obtain communications to, from, and about targets scattered around the world,”\n\nthe NSA “has a strong incentive to intercept communications at as many backbone\n\nchokepoints as possible,” and indeed “must” be doing so “at many different backbone\n\nchokepoints,” J.A. 49–50; (2) the technical rules governing online communications make\n\nthis conclusion “especially true,” J.A. 50; and (3) a New York Times article asserts that\n\nthe NSA “is temporarily copying and then sifting through the contents of what is\n\napparently most e-mails and other text-based communications that cross the border,” J.A.\n\n51.\n\n       We hold that these allegations, even when supplemented by the Wikimedia\n\nAllegation, including that the NSA is conducting Upstream surveillance on at least seven\n\nbackbone links, 10 are insufficient to make plausible the claim that the NSA is intercepting\n\n“substantially all” text-based communications entering and leaving the United States.\n\n       To begin with, the New York Times article is effectively a recitation of the Dragnet\n\nAllegation, and as such we ascribe little significance to it. The dissent takes issue with\n\nour treatment of this article because—as it must—it predates the complaint. Our friend\n\n       10\n          Plaintiffs also reference “another NSA document [which] states that, in support\nof FAA [(i.e., the FISA Amendments Act of 2008)] surveillance, the ‘NSA has expended\na significant amount of resources to create collection/processing capabilities at many of\nthe chokepoints operated by U.S. providers.’” J.A. 51 (emphasis added). As Plaintiffs\nnote, there are “at least two kinds of surveillance” under the Act—PRISM and Upstream.\nJ.A. 40. Pointedly, and unlike in numerous other allegations throughout their complaint,\nincluding the immediately preceding one which references an “NSA slide illustrat[ing]\nthe Upstream surveillance facilitated by just a single provider . . . at seven . . .\nchokepoints,” J.A. 50, Plaintiffs decline to specify which type of surveillance the NSA\ndocument refers to. Accordingly, we accept this allegation as true, but give it little\nweight.\n\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fmisses the point. The article makes a broad statement almost identical to the Dragnet\n\nAllegation.   Under the dissent’s view, one expansive allegation is enough to make\n\nplausible another almost-identical allegation. That is not the law.\n\n       Furthermore, we accept as true Plaintiffs’ allegation about what the NSA is\n\nincentivized to do, but even so, that fact, without more, doesn’t establish a dragnet. That\n\nleaves Plaintiffs with their allegation about what the NSA “must” be doing, a contention\n\nthat lacks sufficient factual support to get “across the line from conceivable to plausible.”\n\nSee Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.\n\n       A point of emphasis—we are not rejecting the allegation because it’s phrased as\n\nan absolute. Indeed, we’ve already credited as true Plaintiffs’ allegation that the NSA\n\n“must be copying and reviewing all the international text-based communications that\n\ntravel across” backbone links which the NSA is surveilling. J.A. 48. We did so because\n\nWikimedia applied the rules governing Internet communications to Upstream\n\nsurveillance’s stated purpose to arrive at a reasonable conclusion about the technical\n\nmeans through which Upstream functions on the backbone links which the NSA surveils.\n\nOne ground for that conclusion’s reasonableness is that given that the NSA is surveilling\n\na link, the rules governing Internet communications necessarily affect, to some degree,\n\nthe way it surveils that link.\n\n       By contrast, in the Dragnet allegation, Plaintiffs seek to use the theory governing\n\nInternet communications in conjunction with Upstream surveillance’s stated purpose to\n\narrive at an allegation about what the program’s operational scope must be. But neither\n\ntheory nor purpose says anything about what the NSA is doing from an operational\n\n\n                                             33\n\fstandpoint. While both are relevant factors, without more they can’t establish a dragnet.\n\nIn that sense, the facts alleged here are far different than those in Schuchardt, where the\n\nplaintiff plausibly pleaded a dragnet under PRISM surveillance by describing “the\n\ntechnical means through which PRISM” functions and by “confirming PRISM’s\n\noperational scope and capabilities” through exhibits “replete with details.” 839 F.3d at\n\n349–50. Those exhibits included purported NSA slides which listed “company names\n\nand the dates they began cooperating with the” NSA and “confirm[ed] that . . . the scale\n\nof the data collected by PRISM is so vast that the Government [had] difficulty processing\n\nit according ‘to the norms to which [it had] become accustomed.’” Id. at 350.\n\n       The last hope for the Dragnet Allegation, then, is to supplement the “must”\n\nallegation with facts detailing Upstream’s operational scope. But even accepting the\n\nallegation that one telecommunications-service provider is facilitating Upstream\n\nsurveillance at 7 of the approximately 49 chokepoints, we still don’t think that Plaintiffs\n\nhave plausibly alleged a dragnet. The allegations here fall short of the level of detail in\n\nSchuchardt, and were we to accept Plaintiffs’ approach to standing, we would sanction\n\nthe extrapolation of the plausible from the conceivable.\n\n       Our recent decision in SD3 is not to the contrary. There, we considered the\n\nplausibility of a complaint alleging an antitrust conspiracy in violation of the Sherman\n\nAntitrust Act. 801 F.3d at 423. We explained that for such a “claim to survive . . . a\n\nplaintiff must plead parallel conduct and something ‘more.’”         Id. at 424 (quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 557)).         “That more,” we said, “must consist of further\n\ncircumstances pointing toward a meeting of the minds.” Id. (alteration and internal\n\n\n                                            34\n\fquotation marks omitted). The plaintiff in SD3 was able to establish that “more” by\n\nalleging the who, what, when, where, and why of a group boycott. Id. at 429–31.\n\n          Plaintiffs use our treatment of the “why” element in SD3 to attach special\n\nsignificance to their allegation that the NSA has a strong incentive to establish a dragnet.\n\nBut context is key. We observed in SD3 that “motivation for common action is a key\n\ncircumstantial fact.” Id. at 431 (emphasis added) (alteration and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     It should come as no surprise that motive is an important factor when\n\nestablishing an antitrust conspiracy.       SD3 does not, however, stand for the broad\n\nproposition that motivation is always of special significance in plausibly pleading an\n\ninjury.\n\n          Relatedly, the level of detail in the SD3 complaint is of a different magnitude than\n\nthe one here, and further supports our conclusion about the implausibility of the Dragnet\n\nAllegation. For example, the SD3 plaintiff “identifie[d] the particular time, place, and\n\nmanner in which the boycott initially formed” and gave “the means by which the\n\ndefendants sealed their boycott agreement: a majority vote.” Id. at 430. Those are the\n\nsorts of operational details, albeit in a case concerning a different subject matter, that are\n\nby and large absent here and which we think are vital to render plausible an allegation as\n\nsweeping as the one Plaintiffs posit. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558 (“[A] district court\n\nmust retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a\n\npotentially massive factual controversy to proceed.”); Swanson v. Citibank, N.A., 614\n\nF.3d 400, 405 (7th Cir. 2010) (“A more complex case involving financial derivatives, or\n\ntax fraud that the parties tried hard to conceal, or antitrust violations, will require more\n\n\n                                               35\n\fdetail, both to give the opposing party notice of what the case is all about and to show\n\nhow, in the plaintiff’s mind at least, the dots should be connected.”).\n\n       The dissent says that this analysis is flawed because the NSA’s inability to predict\n\na communication’s path paired with its desire to “comprehensively acquire\n\ncommunications” renders plausible the allegation of a dragnet. The dissent thinks that’s a\n\n“logical extension” of our crediting as true Wikimedia’s allegation that the NSA reviews\n\nall communications that flow across each link that it surveils. Clearly, there are some\n\nsimilarities, in the sense that each allegation depends, in part, on the application of\n\ninternet theory to a statement about Upstream’s purpose. But, perhaps because it fails to\n\ngrapple with any of the relevant case law, the dissent misses two subtle but key\n\ndistinctions.\n\n       The allegation that we credit as true uses theory to explain how the NSA is doing\n\nsomething, given a defined operational scope. Moreover, that theory necessarily affects\n\nthe way the NSA does what we know it to be doing. Conversely, the allegation that we\n\ndo not credit as true uses theory to define scope. And, there’s no direct link between that\n\ntheory (the NSA doesn’t know a communication’s route) and operational scope. The\n\ndissent’s analysis has no limiting principle and, if adopted, would dilute the plausibility\n\npleading standard to a near-nullity.\n\n       In sum, Plaintiffs lack standing to sue for a violation of the Fourth Amendment\n\nunder the Dragnet Allegation because they can’t plausibly show that the NSA is\n\nintercepting their communications via a dragnet. From there, it follows that they also\n\nlack standing to sue for a violation of the First Amendment because “[a]llegations of a\n\n\n                                             36\n\fsubjective ‘chill’ are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective\n\nharm or a threat of specific future harm.” Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1152 (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13–14 (1972)). Nor can Plaintiffs establish\n\nstanding on the ground that Upstream surveillance compels them to take burdensome and\n\ncostly measures. The Dragnet Allegation’s implausibility leaves them with nothing more\n\nthan “fears of hypothetical future harm,” and they “cannot manufacture standing merely\n\nby inflicting harm on themselves based on” those fears. Id. at 1151. 11\n\n                                            2.\n\n       Before concluding, we briefly address the dissent’s contention that our analysis of\n\nthe non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs’ standing is superfluous.\n\n       Article III of the Constitution requires that we determine whether the non-\n\nWikimedia Plaintiffs have standing because the complaint rests upon the premise that the\n\nNSA is seizing each Plaintiff’s unique communications.          As such, it includes the\n\nfollowing request for individualized relief: “Order Defendants to purge all records of\n\nPlaintiffs’ communications in their possession obtained pursuant to Upstream\n\nsurveillance.” J.A. 84. Thus, the Constitution requires that each Plaintiff be able to\n\nplausibly allege the Fourth Amendment injury in fact that the NSA has seized its\n\ncommunications, because if a Plaintiff cannot do so it doesn’t have standing to, among\n\n       11\n          We reach the same conclusion as to Joshua Dratel, who is a member of the\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He too cannot show that his\ncommunications are being intercepted via a dragnet, and the district court correctly held\nthat the claim that one of his clients “has received notice of [Section 702 surveillance]”\ndidn’t plausibly allege that the NSA targeted his client with Upstream surveillance. J.A.\n68.\n\n\n                                            37\n\fother things, seek an order requiring the NSA to purge its records. To hold otherwise\n\nwould be to sanction a shortcut around “the irreducible constitutional minimum of\n\nstanding.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560.\n\n       Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433 (2009), and Village of Arlington Heights v.\n\nMetropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), are not to the contrary.\n\nEach case is quite different from ours, rendering inapplicable the standing-avoidance\n\ndoctrine which the dissent reads them to embody. 12 Critically, in those cases each party\n\nfor whom standing was at issue requested identical relief. Horne, 557 U.S. at 443;\n\nVillage of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 258. Thus, once the Court decided that a single\n\nparty had standing, it made no difference to the resolution of either case whether any\n\nother party had standing. See Horne, 557 U.S. at 446 & n.2 (concluding that school\n\nsuperintendent had standing to seek vacatur of a district court’s orders in their entirety\n\nand declining to consider whether state legislators also had standing to pursue identical\n\nrelief); Village of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 264 & n.9 (concluding that one\n\nindividual plaintiff had standing to pursue declaratory and injunctive relief and declining\n\nto consider whether other individuals had standing to pursue identical relief); see also,\n\ne.g., Sec’y of the Interior v. California, 464 U.S. 312, 319 n.3 (1984) (“Since the State of\n\n\n       12\n          As for the dissent’s invocation of then-Judge Roberts’s notable quotable that “if\nit is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more,” context is key—\nthat remark in a concurrence had nothing to do with standing, but rather pertained to the\njudge’s disagreement with the majority’s application of the Chevron doctrine. See PDK\nLabs. Inc. v. Drug Enf’t Admin., 362 F.3d 786, 799, 803–04 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J.,\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment). We don’t disagree with the general\nsentiment.

Instead,\n\nthey fall into two different camps when it comes to demonstrating whether the NSA is\n\nseizing their communications. Moreover, the district court made an affirmative finding\n\nthat none of the Plaintiffs had standing. Under these circumstances, we find it wholly\n\nappropriate (indeed necessary) to address fully this threshold question.\n\n\n\n                                             III.\n\n       For the reasons given, we vacate that portion of the district court’s judgment\n\ndismissing the complaint as to Wikimedia and remand for proceedings consistent with\n\nthis opinion.

However, because I would find that the\n\nnon-Wikimedia Plaintiffs also have standing, I respectfully dissent in part.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       In order to explain my disagreement with the majority, I briefly recount the\n\nrelevant allegations in this case, taken as true, of course, at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nPlaintiffs make essentially two sets of factual allegations: the first explaining how\n\ninternational internet communications function and the second describing how the NSA\n\nsurveils international internet communications as they enter and exit the United States.\n\n       First, Plaintiffs allege that internet communications are governed by certain\n\ntechnical rules as they travel from sender to recipient. The majority of international\n\ninternet communications that move through the United States are transmitted through\n\nforty-nine submarine cables and a limited number of terrestrial cables. These cables\n\n(combined with the cables and networks that transmit domestic internet communications)\n\nare known as the internet backbone, and the different physical entry and exit points into\n\nthe United States are known as backbone links. The junctions where these cables meet\n\nare chokepoints through which nearly all international internet traffic passes. Internet\n\ncommunications do not flow along the backbone as discrete and intact entities but instead\n\nare broken into smaller packets of information. The packets that make up a single\n\ninternet communication travel to their common destination independently from one\n\nanother — in the process becoming intermingled with packets from unrelated\n\n                                             40\n\fcommunications — and are reassembled only once they reach their destination. Each\n\npacket reaches its destination following a different and wholly unpredictable path, which\n\nis determined by rapidly changing factors such as network conditions. Because packets\n\ntravel along independent and dynamic paths, communications sent between two\n\nindividuals in “real-time” can traverse different backbone links “even though the end\n\npoints are the same.” J.A. 50. Similarly, a single individual’s communications sent at\n\ndifferent times can traverse different backbone links.\n\n       Second, based on the government’s disclosures and media reports, Plaintiffs allege\n\nthat the NSA is surveilling internet communications as they travel along the internet\n\nbackbone, a practice known as Upstream surveillance. The NSA accomplishes this by\n\ninstalling surveillance devices at backbone links, which allow the agency to copy the\n\ninternet communications traversing these links.          The NSA searches the copied\n\ncommunications for selectors. Selectors are “specific communications facilit[ies]” (e.g.\n\nemail address, telephone numbers, and IP addresses) associated with the NSA’s foreign\n\nsurveillance targets. PCLOB Report 32. The NSA retains communications sent to or\n\nfrom a selector as well as communications containing a selector in their content, which\n\nare known as “about communications.” About communications are not necessarily sent\n\nto or from a foreign surveillance target. According to the government’s disclosures,\n\nsurveillance of about communications is necessary because the NSA seeks to\n\n“comprehensively acquire communications that are sent to or from its targets.” Id. at 10.\n\nWith respect to the scope of Upstream surveillance, the New York Times reported that,\n\nthrough the use of this form of surveillance, the NSA is copying “what is apparently most\n\n                                            41\n\fe-mails and other text-based communications that cross the border.” J.A. 51. Plaintiffs\n\nalso quote an NSA document that states the “NSA has expended a significant amount of\n\nresources to create collection/processing capabilities at many of the chokepoints operated\n\nby U.S. providers through which international communications enter and leave the\n\nUnited States.” Id.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       I agree with the majority’s analysis concluding that Clapper v. Amnesty\n\nInternational USA, 133 S. Ct. 1138 (2013), does not control this case and that —\n\naccepted as true, as they must be — Plaintiffs’ allegations satisfy the three elements of\n\nstanding. The majority also correctly finds that the factual allegations necessary to\n\nestablish Wikimedia’s standing are plausible.      However, the majority errs, both by\n\nreaching out to decide the issue of the non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs’ standing 1 and, as well,\n\n\n       1\n          See Horne v. Flores, 557 U.S. 433, 446 (2009) (“Because the Superintendent\nclearly has standing to challenge the lower courts’ decisions, we need not consider\nwhether the legislators also have standing to do so.”); Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro.\nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 264 and n.9 (1977) (holding because “one individual\nplaintiff . . . has demonstrated standing,” the Court “need not consider whether the other\nindividual and corporate plaintiffs have standing to maintain the suit”). The majority’s\n“same relief” gloss on Horne and Arlington Heights completely reads out of Justice\nAlito’s opinion in Horne the following sentence: “[I]n all standing inquiries, the critical\nquestion is whether at least one petitioner has alleged such a personal stake in the\noutcome of the controversy as to warrant his invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.”\nHorne, 557 U.S. at 445 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In any event,\nthis case actually fits within the majority’s “same relief” paradigm because all plaintiffs\nseek declaratory and injunctive relief intended to shut down the government’s Upstream\nsurveillance program. The mere fact that a “purging order” of the sort contemplated by\nthe majority would operate only to “purge” seized communications of a particular\nplaintiff is a thin reed indeed on which to base the majority’s unnecessary door-closing\nresult.\n(Continued)\n                                            42\n\fin the answer it gives to the question it need not even reach in holding that the non-\n\nWikimedia Plaintiffs’ lack standing because the pertinent allegations are not plausible.\n\n       In order to find that Wikimedia has standing in this action, the majority credits as\n\ntrue three factual allegations. First, because Wikimedia sends and receives so many\n\ninternational internet communications, its communications travel across every internet\n\nbackbone link. Second, based on the government’s disclosures, the NSA is surveilling at\n\nleast one backbone link. Third, the NSA intercepts and copies every packet that passes\n\nthrough the backbone link(s) being surveilled (what the majority calls the Wikimedia\n\nAllegation). The third allegation is not based on Plaintiffs’ knowledge of the NSA’s\n\nsurveillance techniques. Instead, the majority finds this factual allegation is plausible\n\n\n\n\n        It is not clear to me why the majority elects to ignore the Chief Justice’s sage\nadmonition: “[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more.”\nPDK Labs., Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 362 F.3d 786, 799 (D.C. Cir. 2004)\n(Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). The majority’s assertion\nto the contrary notwithstanding, I think I know dicta when I see it, and here I see dicta.\nIf, in fact, the Wikimedia Plaintiffs go on to prove their claims in this case, i.e., establish\na violation of the Fourth Amendment as to themselves, it is beyond my capacity to\nconjure a rational basis on which the non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs would not be entitled to\nsimilar relief from seizures effected pursuant to the Upstream program and of course, the\ndismissal here of the non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs will be without prejudice. S. Walk at\nBroadlands Homeowner's Ass’n v. OpenBand at Broadlands, LLC, 713 F.3d 175, 185\n(4th Cir. 2013).\n        In sum, the day cannot be far off when defendants in a broad array of multi-\nplaintiff cases will point to the majority’s holding in this case as authority requiring\nalready short-handed and overworked federal district judges to separately assess the\nstanding of each and every plaintiff in complex, impact litigation. Needless to say, we\nshould avoid imposing such a requirement in the absence of the absolute necessity that\nwe do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                              43\n\fbecause it is based on Upstream surveillance’s stated purpose and the technical rules that\n\ngovern internet communications.       The logical chain is as follows: The NSA has\n\nacknowledged that it uses Upstream surveillance to target “about communications,”\n\nwhich contain a selector in the content of the communication. Before it can search the\n\ncontents of an internet communication that has been broken up into discrete packets\n\nwhile in transit, the NSA must copy and reassemble all of the packets that make up the\n\ncommunication. However, packets from targeted communications cannot be segregated\n\nfrom the packets of unrelated communications. Thus, in order to “reliably” intercept\n\ntargeted communications, the NSA must copy all of the packets that flow across a\n\nbackbone link so that the government can be assured that it has captured all of the packets\n\nthat make up the targeted communication (and in the process capturing unrelated\n\npackets). J.A. 48–49.\n\n       Conversely, under the majority’s “crabbed plausibility analysis,” see Woods v.\n\nCity of Greensboro, --- F.3d ---, ---, 2017 WL 1754898, *2 (4th Cir. 2017), the non-\n\nWikimedia Plaintiffs are denied standing because, in the majority’s view, those Plaintiffs\n\nrely on an implausible guess regarding Upstream surveillance’s operational scope. For\n\nthe non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs to have standing, according to the majority, Plaintiffs must\n\nplausibly allege an additional fact beyond those discussed with respect to Wikimedia: the\n\nNSA is surveilling most backbone links (what the majority calls the Dragnet Allegation).\n\nJust as with the Wikimedia Allegation, Plaintiffs base this factual allegation on Upstream\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\fsurveillance’s stated purpose and the technical rules governing internet communications. 2\n\nHowever, the majority finds this allegation implausible because it believes that “neither\n\ntheory nor purpose says anything about what the NSA is doing from an operational\n\nstandpoint.” Op. at 33. This misapprehends the full scope of Plaintiffs’ allegations.\n\n        Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the NSA surveils most backbone links\n\nbecause — based on the technical rules governing internet communications — the agency\n\ncannot know which link the communications it targets will traverse when they enter or\n\nleave the United States. The path that packets take along the internet backbone is\n\ndetermined dynamically based on unpredictable conditions. Thus, a communication sent\n\nby a surveillance target can enter the United States through one backbone link, but an\n\nimmediate response returned to the surveillance target can traverse a different backbone\n\nlink.   Similarly, communications sent by a surveillance target at different times or\n\nlocations can traverse different backbone links.      Given this technical limitation, the\n\ngovernment’s    disclosure    that   the   NSA    seeks    to   “comprehensively     acquire\n\ncommunications that are sent to or from its targets,” J.A. 49, renders Plaintiffs’ allegation\n\nplausible.   If the NSA cannot know which backbone link its targets’ internet\n\n\n\n        2\n         Plaintiffs provide additional support for this allegation by corroborating it with a\nN.Y. Times report, which stated that the NSA is surveilling “most e-mails and other text-\nbased communications that cross the border.” J.A. 51. The majority finds that this report\nis entitled to “little significance” because it “is effectively a recitation of” Plaintiffs’\nallegation. Op. at 32. The N.Y. Times report predates the complaint, however; thus, the\nallegation is a “recitation” of the factual news report, not the other way around.\nMoreover, the fact that Plaintiffs based their allegation on factual news reporting rather\nthan their own conjecture means the allegation is entitled to more weight not less.\n\n                                             45\n\fcommunications will traverse, then the only way it can comprehensively acquire its\n\ntargets’ communications is by surveilling virtually every backbone link.\n\n       This allegation is essentially a logical extension of Plaintiffs’ earlier allegation that\n\nthe NSA must copy every communication that flows across a backbone link it surveils.\n\nJust as it is plausible that the government must copy all of the packets that flow through a\n\nbackbone link in order to “reliably” capture the packets that make up a targeted internet\n\ncommunication, because the government does not know across which backbone link a\n\ncommunication will travel, it is also plausible that the government must monitor virtually\n\nevery link in order to “comprehensively” capture its targets’ communications. Given that\n\nwe review here a motion to dismiss and not a motion for summary judgment, the\n\nnon-Wikimedia Plaintiffs have provided enough factual support to their allegation to\n\nsurvive dismissal.\n\n                                              III.\n\n       For the reasons set forth, while I discern no need whatsoever to review the district\n\ncourt’s legal determination of the non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs’ standing, I respectfully\n\ndissent from the majority opinion’s unnecessary resolution of that issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                              46\n\f",

The district court, relying on the\n\ndiscussion of speculative injury from Clapper v. Amnesty International USA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"821306\"><a href=\"/opinion/821306/clapper-v-amnesty-international-usa/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1138</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2013), held that the allegations in the complaint were too speculative to establish\n\nArticle III standing. We conclude that Clapper’s analysis of speculative injury does not\n\ncontrol this case, since the central allegations here are not speculative. Accordingly, as\n\nfor Wikimedia, we vacate and remand because it makes allegations sufficient to survive a\n\nfacial challenge to standing. As for the other Plaintiffs, we affirm because the complaint\n\ndoes not contain enough well-pleaded facts entitled to the presumption of truth to\n\nestablish their standing.\n\n\n\n                                            I.\n\n                                           A.\n\n       Before diving into the details of Plaintiffs’ complaint, we provide an overview of\n\nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (“FISA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1801 et seq., the statute\n\nfrom which the government derives its authority to conduct Upstream surveillance.\n\n       Congress enacted FISA in 1978 to regulate electronic surveillance undertaken to\n\ngather foreign intelligence information. David S. Kris & J. Douglas Wilson, National\n\nSecurity Investigations and Prosecutions § 3:8 (2d ed.), Westlaw (database updated Aug.\n\n2016) (hereinafter Kris & Wilson); see also 50 U.S.C. § 1801 (defining electronic\n\n\n                                            4\n\fsurveillance).    FISA created two specialized courts—the Foreign Intelligence\n\nSurveillance Court (the “FISC”), from which the government generally must obtain\n\nauthorization before conducting electronic surveillance, and the Foreign Intelligence\n\nSurveillance Court of Review, which has jurisdiction to review the denial of a FISA\n\napplication for electronic surveillance. Kris & Wilson § 5:1. As originally enacted,\n\nFISA required the government to demonstrate probable cause to believe that the target of\n\nits surveillance was “a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,” and that the facility\n\nor place at which surveillance would be directed was “being used, or is about to be used,\n\nby a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power.” 50 U.S.C. § 1805(a)(2); see also\n\nKris & Wilson § 7:2.\n\n       “Until 2008, FISA applied only to investigative conduct inside the United States.”\n\nKris & Wilson § 4:2. That changed through the FISA Amendments Act of 2008, which\n\nauthorized the government to acquire foreign-intelligence information by targeting for up\n\nto one year non-U.S. persons reasonably believed to be abroad. See 50 U.S.C. § 1881a.\n\nFISA Section 702, 50 U.S.C. § 1881a, sets forth the process for obtaining that authority.\n\n       Generally, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence initiate\n\nthe process by submitting a “certification” regarding the proposed surveillance to the\n\nFISC for approval. Id. § 1881a(g)(1)(A). That certification must attest, inter alia, that:\n\n       (1) procedures are in place “that . . . are reasonably designed” to ensure that\n       an acquisition is “limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be\n       located outside” the United States; (2) minimization procedures adequately\n       restrict the acquisition, retention, and dissemination of nonpublic\n       information about unconsenting U.S. persons . . .; (3) guidelines have been\n       adopted to ensure compliance with targeting limits and the Fourth\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\f       Amendment; and (4) the procedures and guidelines . . . comport with the\n       Fourth Amendment.\n\nClapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1145 (quoting 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(g)(2)).\n\n       The FISC reviews the certification to ensure that it contains the statutorily required\n\nelements and has targeting and minimization procedures that are both consistent with the\n\nFourth Amendment and are “reasonably designed” to meet certain requirements. Id. In\n\nparticular, the FISC must find that the targeting procedures are “reasonably designed” to:\n\n(i) ensure that acquisition “is limited to targeting persons reasonably believed to be\n\nlocated outside the United States,” and (ii) “prevent the intentional acquisition of” wholly\n\ndomestic communications. 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(i)(2)(B). The FISC must also find that the\n\nminimization procedures are “reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique\n\nof the particular surveillance, to minimize the acquisition and retention, and prohibit the\n\ndissemination, of nonpublicly available information concerning unconsenting United\n\nStates persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and\n\ndisseminate foreign intelligence information.” Id. § 1801(h)(1); see id. § 1881a(i)(2)(C)\n\n(referring to § 1801(h)).\n\n       Section 702 prohibits the intentional targeting of “any person known at the time of\n\nacquisition to be located in the United States,” id. § 1881a(b), but allows the government\n\nto intercept communications between a U.S. person inside the country and a foreigner\n\nabroad targeted by intelligence officials, see id. § 1881a(a)–(b); see also Kris & Wilson\n\n§ 17:5. Furthermore, surveillance under Section 702 may be conducted for purposes\n\nother than counterterrorism—the statute defines “foreign intelligence information” to\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fmean, among other things, information that relates to “the conduct of the foreign affairs\n\nof the United States,” 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e)(2)(B)—and the government need not identify\n\n“the specific facilities, places, premises, or property at which” it will direct surveillance,\n\nid. § 1881a(g)(4).\n\n       The absence of particularity and probable cause requirements in Section 702\n\nsurveillance allows the government to monitor the communications of thousands of\n\nindividuals and groups under a single FISC Order. See Office of the Director of National\n\nIntelligence, Calendar Year 2014 Statistical Transparency Report 1–2 (2015) (stating\n\nthat in 2014 the government used its authority pursuant to Section 702 to target an\n\nestimated 92,707 persons, groups, and entities under one FISC Order). 1 Furthermore, the\n\nminimization procedures allow the government to retain communications—including\n\nthose of U.S. persons—if the government concludes that they contain “foreign\n\nintelligence” information. See Kris & Wilson §§ 9:5, 17:5.\n\n       The government has acknowledged that it conducts two forms of surveillance\n\nunder Section 702—PRISM and Upstream. See Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight\n\nBoard, Report on the Surveillance Program Operated Pursuant to Section 702 of the\n\nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act 7 (2014) (hereinafter PCLOB Report). 2            Only\n\nUpstream is at issue here.

First, in what we refer to as the\n\nWikimedia Allegation, Wikimedia alleges that “the sheer volume of [its] communications\n\nmakes it virtually certain that the NSA has intercepted, copied, and reviewed at least\n\nsome of [its] communications.” 3 J.A. 46. Second, in what we refer to as the Dragnet\n\nAllegation, all nine Plaintiffs allege that in the course of conducting Upstream\n\nsurveillance the NSA is “intercepting, copying, and reviewing substantially all” text-\n\nbased communications entering and leaving the United States, including their own. J.A.\n\n46.   After setting forth supporting background relevant to each, we describe the\n\nWikimedia and Dragnet Allegations.\n\n\n\n      3\n          Though all nine Plaintiffs made this allegation, only Wikimedia pursues it on\nappeal.\n\n\n                                            8\n\f                                             1.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that “Upstream surveillance involves the NSA’s seizing and\n\nsearching the [I]nternet communications of U.S. citizens and residents en masse as those\n\ncommunications travel across the [I]nternet ‘backbone’ in the United States.” J.A. 40.\n\n“The [I]nternet backbone is the network of high-capacity cables, switches, and routers\n\n[administered by telecommunications-service providers] that facilitates both domestic\n\nand international communication via the [I]nternet.”               J.A. 40.    It includes “the\n\napproximately 49 international submarine cables that carry [I]nternet communications\n\ninto and out of the United States and that land at approximately 43 different points within\n\nthe country.” J.A. 42.\n\n       The NSA performs Upstream surveillance by first identifying a target and then\n\nidentifying “selectors” for that target. Selectors are the specific means by which the\n\ntarget communicates, such as e-mail addresses or telephone numbers. Selectors cannot\n\nbe keywords (e.g., “bomb”) or names of targeted individuals (e.g., “Bin Laden”).\n\n       The     NSA   then   “tasks”    selectors     for   collection    and   sends   them to\n\ntelecommunications-service providers. Those providers must assist the government in\n\nintercepting   communications    to,    from,       or   “about”   the   selectors.    “About”\n\ncommunications are those that contain a tasked selector in their content, but are not to or\n\nfrom the target. “For instance, a communication between two third parties might be\n\nacquired because it contains a targeted email address in the body of the communication.”\n\nPCLOB Report at 119.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f      We note an important distinction between Internet transactions and Internet\n\ncommunications.       While Upstream surveillance “is intended to acquire Internet\n\ncommunications, it does so through the acquisition of Internet transactions.” PCLOB\n\nReport at 39. An example illustrates the point. When an individual sends an email on the\n\nInternet, the message is broken up into one or more “data packets” which are transmitted\n\nacross the Internet backbone to their destination and, upon arrival, reassembled by the\n\nrecipient’s computer to reconstruct the communication. The individual data packets\n\ngenerated by a single email can take “different routes [across the backbone] to their\n\ncommon destination.”         PCLOB Report at 125.           Relatedly, when two people\n\ncommunicate, the data packets from the target can take a different path along the\n\nbackbone than the data packets to the target. “The government describes an Internet\n\n‘transaction’ as ‘a complement of packets traversing the Internet that together may be\n\nunderstood by a device on the Internet and, where applicable, rendered in an intelligible\n\nform to the user of that device.’” Redacted, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2011</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">10945618</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *9 n.23 (FISA Ct.\n\nOct. 3, 2011) (quoting a government submission to the FISC). 4 An Internet transaction\n\ncan comprise one or many discrete communications.\n\n      “To identify and acquire Internet transactions associated with the Section 702-\n\ntasked selectors on the Internet backbone, Internet transactions are first filtered to\n\neliminate potential domestic transactions, and then are screened to capture only\n\ntransactions containing a tasked selector. Unless transactions pass both these screens,\n\n\n      4\n          Plaintiffs’ complaint incorporates this FISC opinion.\n\n\n                                             10\n\fthey are not ingested into government databases.” PCLOB Report at 37. “If a single\n\ndiscrete communication within [a multi-communication transaction] is to, from, or about\n\na Section 702-tasked selector, and at least one end of the transaction is foreign, the NSA\n\nwill acquire the entire [multi-communication transaction].” PCLOB Report at 39. Once\n\nacquired, communications are subject to FISC-approved minimization procedures. The\n\nNSA’s minimization procedures, for example, limit the types of queries that analysts can\n\nconduct across data sets of Section 702-acquired information.\n\n       Plaintiffs allege that Upstream surveillance works in practice as follows. First, the\n\nNSA copies “substantially all international text-based communications—and many\n\ndomestic ones—flowing across certain high-capacity cables, switches, and routers” by\n\n“[u]sing surveillance devices installed at key access points along the [I]nternet\n\nbackbone.” J.A. 43. Second, it “attempts to filter out and discard some wholly domestic\n\ncommunications,” though that effort “is incomplete.” J.A. 43. Third, it reviews the full\n\ncontent of the copied communications for targeted selectors, including IP addresses. J.A.\n\n43. Finally, it “retains [and with few restrictions analyzes] all communications that\n\ncontain selectors associated with its targets, as well as those that happen to be bundled\n\nwith them in transit.” J.A. 44.\n\n                                            2.\n\n       Wikimedia asserts that the NSA is intercepting, copying, and reviewing at least\n\nsome of its communications in the course of Upstream surveillance, “even if the NSA\n\nconducts Upstream surveillance on only a single [I]nternet backbone link.” J.A. 49.\n\nWikimedia, “the operator of one of the most-visited websites in the world,” alleges that it\n\n\n                                            11\n\f“engages in more than one trillion international communications each year, with\n\nindividuals who are located in virtually every country on earth.” J.A. 56. According to\n\nWikimedia, Upstream surveillance implicates three categories of its communications:\n\n(1) communications with its community members; (2) internal “log” communications,\n\nwhich include users’ IP addresses and the URLs of webpages sought by users; and\n\n(3) communications between its staff and individuals around the world. J.A. 55–56.\n\n      Wikimedia further alleges that “[g]iven the relatively small number of\n\ninternational chokepoints,” 5 the volume of its communications, and the geographical\n\ndiversity of the people with whom it communicates, its “communications almost certainly\n\ntraverse every international backbone link connecting the United States with the rest of\n\nthe world.” J.A. 47–48. And, Wikimedia alleges, “in order for the NSA to reliably\n\nobtain communications to, from, or about its targets in the way it has described, the\n\ngovernment must be copying and reviewing all the international text-based\n\ncommunications that travel across a given link.” J.A. 48.\n\n      That last allegation is so, says Wikimedia, because “as a technical matter, the\n\ngovernment cannot know beforehand which communications will contain selectors\n\nassociated with its targets, and therefore it must copy and review all international text-\n\nbased communications transiting [a] circuit in order to identify those of interest.” J.A.\n\n48. That is because data packets that constitute a communication “travel independently\n\n\n      5\n        By “chokepoint,” Wikimedia refers to the 49 international submarine cables and\nthe “limited number” of terrestrial cables that carry Internet communications into and out\nof the United States. J.A. 47–48.\n\n\n                                           12\n\fof one another, intermingled with packets of other communications in the stream of\n\ndata,” and “the packets of interest cannot be segregated from other, unrelated packets in\n\nadvance.” J.A. 49. Thus, the NSA must “copy all such packets traversing a given\n\nbackbone link, so that it can reassemble and review the transiting communications.” J.A.\n\n49.\n\n       Tying these allegations together, Wikimedia asserts that if the NSA is monitoring\n\na single [I]nternet backbone link, then the NSA is intercepting, copying, and reviewing at\n\nleast some of Wikimedia’s communications. According to Wikimedia, “the NSA has\n\nconfirmed that it conducts Upstream surveillance at more than one point along the\n\n[I]nternet backbone.” J.A. 49. In addition to the PCLOB Report’s confirmation of the\n\nprogram’s existence, Wikimedia points to a purported NSA slide which shows that a\n\nsingle telecommunications-service provider is facilitating Upstream surveillance at\n\n“seven major international chokepoints in the United States” and a purported NSA\n\ndocument which states that the NSA is expending significant resources to “create\n\ncollection/processing capabilities at many of the chokepoints operated by U.S.\n\nproviders.” J.A. 50–51.\n\n       Wikimedia has “an acute privacy interest in its communications” because its\n\n“mission and existence depend on its ability to ensure that readers and editors can explore\n\nand contribute to [its websites] privately when they choose to do so.” J.A. 59–60. It has,\n\nin response to Upstream surveillance, taken burdensome steps to protect “the privacy of\n\nits communications and the confidentiality of the information it thereby receives.” J.A.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f60–61.        Among other things, Wikimedia has “self-censor[ed] communications or\n\nforgo[ne] electronic communications altogether.” J.A. 64.\n\n         Finally, the first amended complaint alleges that “even if one assumes a\n\n0.00000001% chance . . . of the NSA copying and reviewing any particular\n\ncommunication, the odds of the government copying and reviewing at least one of the\n\nPlaintiffs’     communications   in   a   one-year   period   would   be    greater   than\n\n99.9999999999%.” J.A. 46–47. This is an extension of the allegation that Wikimedia\n\nengages in more than one trillion international communications each year.\n\n                                            3.\n\n         In the Dragnet Allegation, Plaintiffs say that “given the way the government has\n\ndescribed Upstream surveillance, it has a strong incentive to intercept communications at\n\nas many backbone chokepoints as possible.” J.A. 49. Thus, “[i]f the government’s aim is\n\nto ‘comprehensively’ and ‘reliably’ obtain communications to, from, and about targets\n\nscattered around the world, it must conduct Upstream surveillance at many different\n\nbackbone chokepoints.” J.A. 50.\n\n         Plaintiffs allege that the nature of online communication, including that data\n\npackets to a target can take different routes than data packets from a target, makes this\n\nconclusion “especially true.” J.A. 50. They also incorporate into their complaint a New\n\nYork Times article asserting that the NSA “is temporarily copying and then sifting\n\nthrough the contents of what is apparently most e-mails and other text-based\n\ncommunications that cross the border.” J.A. 51.\n\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f       Furthermore, Plaintiffs often communicate with individuals whom the NSA is\n\nlikely to target through Upstream surveillance, and “[a] significant amount of the\n\ninformation that [they] exchange over the [I]nternet is ‘foreign intelligence information.’”\n\nJ.A. 52. “Because of ongoing government surveillance, including Upstream surveillance,\n\nPlaintiffs have had to take burdensome and sometimes costly measures to” protect “the\n\nconfidentiality of their sensitive information.” J.A. 52. Upstream surveillance compels\n\nthem to censor their own communications and, in some instances, to forgo electronic\n\ncommunications altogether.\n\n       Finally, Joshua Dratel, a member of Plaintiff National Association of Criminal\n\nDefense Lawyers, also challenges Upstream surveillance. One of Dratel’s clients “has\n\nreceived notice of [Section 702 surveillance], and [Dratel] previously represented a client\n\nin another case where officials have told Congress that the government used [Section 702\n\nsurveillance] in the course of its investigation.” J.A. 68–69.\n\n                                             C.\n\n       The government moved to dismiss for lack of standing and submitted evidence,\n\nincluding declarations by Robert Lee and Alan Salzberg. The Lee Declaration challenges\n\nPlaintiffs’ assertion that, as a technical matter, the NSA must be copying all data packets\n\nthat traverse a given backbone link.        The Salzberg Declaration attacks Plaintiffs’\n\nprobability calculation that there’s a greater than 99.9999999999% chance that the NSA\n\nis copying and reviewing their communications.\n\n       The district court, relying on Clapper, held that Plaintiffs had failed to establish\n\nstanding because their allegations “depend on suppositions and speculation, with no basis\n\n\n                                             15\n\fin fact, about how the NSA implements Upstream surveillance.” J.A. 190. The court\n\ncharacterized the government’s motion as a facial challenge, and thus did not consider\n\neither declaration. Because so much of the district court’s opinion depends on Clapper,\n\nwe summarize that case first.\n\n                                             1.\n\n        In Clapper, plaintiffs (including six of the nine Plaintiffs here, but not including\n\nDratel or Wikimedia) lodged a facial challenge to Section 702 on the day that the law\n\nwent into effect, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 133 S. Ct. at 1145–46. They\n\nalleged that their work required them to “engage in sensitive and sometimes privileged\n\ntelephone and e-mail communications with . . . individuals located abroad” who were\n\n“likely targets of surveillance under” Section 702. Id. at 1145. Plaintiffs had two\n\nseparate theories of Article III standing: (1) there was an “objectively reasonable\n\nlikelihood” that their communications would be intercepted in the future pursuant to\n\nSection 702 surveillance, and (2) they were forced to undertake costly and burdensome\n\nmeasures to avoid a substantial risk of surveillance. Id. at 1146. They did not, however,\n\nhave “actual knowledge of the Government’s [Section 702] targeting practices.” Id. at\n\n1148.\n\n        The Supreme Court held that neither injury established standing at the summary\n\njudgment stage.     The theory of standing based on interception of communications\n\n“relie[d] on a highly attenuated chain of possibilities, [which did] not satisfy the\n\nrequirement that threatened injury must be certainly impending.” Id. at 1147–48. The\n\nCourt broke the speculative chain into five parts:\n\n\n                                             16\n\f       (1) the Government will decide to target the communications of non-U.S.\n       persons with whom [plaintiffs] communicate; (2) in doing so, the\n       Government will choose to invoke its authority under [Section 702] rather\n       than utilizing another method of surveillance; (3) the Article III judges who\n       serve on the [FISC] will conclude that the Government’s proposed\n       surveillance procedures satisfy [Section 702’s] many safeguards and are\n       consistent with the Fourth Amendment; (4) the Government will succeed in\n       intercepting the communications of [plaintiffs’] contacts; and (5)\n       [plaintiffs] will be parties to the particular communications that the\n       Government intercepts.\n\nId. at 1148.\n\n       “[A]t the summary judgment stage,” the Court noted, plaintiffs “can no longer rest\n\non mere allegations [to establish standing], but must set forth by affidavit or other\n\nevidence specific facts.”    Id. at 1148–49 (alteration and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). The Clapper plaintiffs, however, had no “specific facts demonstrating that the\n\ncommunications of their foreign contacts w[ould] be targeted.” Id. at 1149.\n\n       The assertion of harm based on measures taken to avoid surveillance also didn’t\n\nsuffice. Because “the harm [plaintiffs] s[ought] to avoid [wa]s not certainly impending,”\n\nthe Court explained, they couldn’t “manufacture standing merely by inflicting harm on\n\nthemselves based on their fears of hypothetical future harm.” Id. at 1151. In other\n\nwords, plaintiffs had failed to show that “[a]ny ongoing injuries” they were suffering\n\nwere “fairly traceable” to Section 702 surveillance. Id. The Court suggested, however,\n\nthat a lawyer who represented a target of Section 702 surveillance might have standing.\n\nId. at 1154.\n\n\n\n\n                                            17\n\f                                             2.\n\n       Applying these principles, the district court in this case reasoned that while\n\n       more is known about the nature and capabilities of NSA surveillance than\n       was known at the time of Clapper, . . . no more is known about whether\n       Upstream surveillance actually intercepts all or substantially all\n       international text-based Internet communications, including plaintiffs’\n       communications. . . . Indeed, plaintiffs’ reliance on the government’s\n       capacity and motivation to collect substantially all international text-based\n       Internet communications is precisely the sort of speculative reasoning\n       foreclosed by Clapper.\n\nJ.A. 192. The court supported that conclusion with two observations relevant here: (1) it\n\nis unclear whether the NSA is “using [its] surveillance equipment to its full potential” to\n\nintercept “all communications passing through” chokepoints upon which the NSA has\n\ninstalled surveillance equipment, and (2) “the fact that all NSA surveillance practices\n\nmust survive FISC review . . . suggests that the NSA is not using its surveillance\n\nequipment to its full potential.” J.A. 190–91.\n\n       The district court also rejected the argument that Clapper “does not control here\n\nbecause plaintiffs are different from the Clapper plaintiffs.” J.A. 194. The court focused\n\non Dratel and Wikimedia. With respect to Dratel, the court concluded that the allegations\n\nfailed to “plausibly establish that the information gathered from the two instances of\n\nSection 702 surveillance was the product of Upstream surveillance,” and that it “appears\n\nsubstantially more likely that PRISM collection was used in [those] cases.” J.A. 195.\n\n       As for Wikimedia, the court found that “the statistical analysis on which the\n\nargument rests [(i.e., the probability calculation that there’s a greater than\n\n99.9999999999% chance that the NSA is copying and reviewing Wikimedia’s\n\n\n\n                                             18\n\fcommunications)] is incomplete and riddled with assumptions,” and that “[l]ogically\n\nantecedent to plaintiffs’ flawed statistical analysis are plaintiffs’ speculative claims about\n\nUpstream surveillance based on limited knowledge of Upstream surveillance’s technical\n\nfeatures and ‘strategic imperatives.’” 6 See J.A. 197–99.\n\n       From the district court’s dismissal of their complaint for lack of standing,\n\nPlaintiffs appeal.\n\n\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We review the district court’s decision de novo, Columbia Gas Transmission\n\nCorp. v.

Under PRISM surveillance, the government purportedly\n\nobtains “user communications exchanged using services provided by several large U.S.\n\ncompanies” directly from those companies’ servers. Id. at 340.\n\n       Schuchardt’s central allegation was that the NSA is “intercepting, monitoring and\n\nstoring the content of all or substantially all of the e-mail sent by American citizens, [and\n\nthus] his own online communications had been seized in the dragnet.”             Id. at 341\n\n(emphasis omitted). In support of that allegation, Schuchardt stated that he used online\n\nservices targeted by PRISM surveillance and incorporated into his complaint “excerpts of\n\nthe classified materials” made public through newspaper articles and filings in other\n\ncases. Id. at 341. The complaint and its exhibits described the “technical means through\n\nwhich PRISM purportedly achieves a nationwide email dragnet” and were “replete with\n\ndetails confirming PRISM’s operational scope and capabilities.” Id. at 350.\n\n       For example, a slide from a purported NSA presentation “identif[ied] company\n\nnames and the dates they began cooperating with” the NSA, while another exhibit\n\n“indicate[d] . . . that the degree of access those providers granted enables the Government\n\nto query their facilities at will for ‘real-time interception of an individual’s [I]nternet\n\nactivity.’” Id. at 349–50 (citations omitted). Another purported NSA slide “confirm[ed]\n\nthat—consistent with a dragnet capturing ‘all or substantially all of the e–mail sent by\n\nAmerican citizens’—the scale of the data collected by PRISM is so vast that the\n\nGovernment reported difficulty processing it according ‘to the norms’ to which [it has]\n\nbecome accustomed.” Id. at 350 (alteration in original) (citations omitted).\n\n\n                                             22\n\f      The Third Circuit bifurcated its analysis. First, it found Schuchardt’s allegations\n\nsufficiently particularized to satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement.     Id. at 345–46.\n\nThough PRISM surveillance is “universal in scope,” the harm that Schuchardt alleged\n\nwas “unmistakably personal”—“he ha[d] a constitutional right to maintain the privacy of\n\nhis personal communications, online or otherwise.” Id. Moreover, “the fact that [many\n\nothers] may share a similar interest d[id] not change [the injury’s] individualized nature\n\nbecause Schuchardt’s allegations ma[de] clear that he [wa]s among the persons” targeted\n\nby PRISM. Id. at 346 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Second, the court credited Schuchardt’s allegations as true for the purpose of\n\nresolving the facial challenge to his complaint. Id. at 346–50. The level of detail in the\n\ncomplaint—sufficient to describe “the technical means through which PRISM\n\npurportedly” functions and to “confirm[] PRISM’s operational scope and capabilities”—\n\nmade his allegation about “the Government’s virtual dragnet” plausible. Id. at 349–50.\n\nIn doing so, the Third Circuit made clear that Schuchardt’s reliance on exhibits was not\n\ndisfavored, and that “[d]espite Clapper’s observation that the standing inquiry is\n\n‘especially rigorous’ in matters touching on ‘intelligence gathering and foreign affairs,’”\n\nit knew of no instance where a court had “imposed a heightened pleading standard for\n\ncases implicating national security,” and thus “assume[d] without deciding that” one did\n\nnot apply. Id. at 348 n.8, 348–49 (quoting Clapper, 133 S. Ct. at 1147).\n\n      We find the Third Circuit’s approach persuasive and bifurcate our analyses of the\n\nWikimedia and Dragnet Allegations in similar fashion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span>\n\f                                             <span class=\"reporter\">Barb.</span>\n\n                                              <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n       As a reminder, the Wikimedia Allegation is that the NSA is intercepting, copying,\n\nand reviewing at least some of Wikimedia’s communications in the course of Upstream\n\nsurveillance, “even if the NSA conducts Upstream surveillance on only a single [I]nternet\n\nbackbone link.” J.A. 49.\n\n       We conclude that this allegation satisfies the three elements of Article III standing.\n\nWe begin with injury in fact. See Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548 (defining injury in fact as\n\nthe invasion of a legally protected interest that is concrete and particularized and actual or\n\nimminent). The allegation that the NSA is intercepting and copying communications\n\nsuffices to show an invasion of a legally protected interest—the “Fourth Amendment\n\nright to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.” Schuchardt, 839 F.3d at 353;\n\nsee also Am.

See Spokeo, 136 S. Ct. at 1548\n\nn.7; accord Schuchardt, 839 F.3d at 346.

Indeed, there’s nothing speculative about it—the interception of Wikimedia’s\n\ncommunications is an actual injury that has already occurred.\n\n       The Wikimedia Allegation also satisfies the other two elements of Article III\n\nstanding. Upstream surveillance is the direct cause of the alleged injury, and there’s no\n\nreason to doubt that the requested injunctive and declaratory relief would redress the\n\nharm. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560–61 (providing that the injury must be “fairly traceable”\n\nto the conduct complained of and “likely” to be redressed by a favorable decision).\n\n       However, just because this allegation satisfies the elements of Article III standing\n\ndoesn’t mean that we must accept it as true for the purpose of resolving the government’s\n\nfacial challenge to the complaint. Thus, we proceed to the second part of our analysis to\n\ndecide whether the Wikimedia Allegation is plausible.\n\n       Wikimedia alleges three key facts that are entitled to the presumption of truth.\n\nFirst, “[g]iven the relatively small number of international chokepoints,” the volume of\n\nWikimedia’s communications, and the geographical diversity of the people with whom it\n\ncommunicates,    Wikimedia’s     “communications     almost     certainly   traverse   every\n\ninternational backbone link connecting the United States with the rest of the world.” J.A.\n\n47–48. 7\n\n\n       7\n          On appeal, Wikimedia attempts to rephrase this allegation so that it reads,\n“Wikimedia’s communications traverse every major [I]nternet circuit entering or leaving\nthe United States.” Appellants’ Br. at 24. We look, however, to the wording of the\ncomplaint. That said, the plausibility pleading regime doesn’t automatically invalidate\nallegations that contain probabilistic-sounding words. For the purpose of deciding\nwhether the Wikimedia Allegation is plausible, we find this supporting allegation, based\nas it is upon other factual allegations, to be well-pleaded. Indeed, Wikimedia need only\n(Continued)\n\n                                            25\n\f       Second, “in order for the NSA to reliably obtain communications to, from, or\n\nabout its targets in the way it has described, the government,” for technical reasons that\n\nWikimedia goes into at length, “must be copying and reviewing all the international text-\n\nbased communications that travel across a given link” upon which it has installed\n\nsurveillance equipment. J.A. 48. Because details about the collection process remain\n\nclassified, Wikimedia can’t precisely describe the technical means that the NSA employs.\n\nInstead, it spells out the technical rules of how the Internet works and concludes that,\n\ngiven that the NSA is conducting Upstream surveillance on a backbone link, the rules\n\nrequire that the NSA do so in a certain way.\n\n       We would never confuse the plausibility of this conclusion with that accorded to\n\nNewton’s laws of motion. But accepting the technical rules about the Internet as true,\n\nand given that Wikimedia is applying them in an appropriate context (i.e., it uses the rules\n\nto explain the technical means through which Upstream surveillance functions), we find\n\nthis conclusion reasonable and entitled to the presumption of truth.\n\n       Third, per the PCLOB Report and a purported NSA slide, “the NSA has confirmed\n\nthat it conducts Upstream surveillance at more than one point along the [I]nternet\n\nbackbone.” J.A. 49–51. Together, these allegations are sufficient to make plausible the\n\nconclusion that the NSA is intercepting, copying, and reviewing at least some of\n\n\n“state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face,” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 570). Construing, as we must, all well-pleaded facts in the light\nmost favorable to Wikimedia, SD3, 801 F.3d at 422, Wikimedia’s claim that its\n“communications almost certainly traverse” every chokepoint is enough to satisfy the\nplausibility requirement. J.A. 48.\n\n\n                                            26\n\fWikimedia’s communications. To put it simply, Wikimedia has plausibly alleged that its\n\ncommunications travel all of the roads that a communication can take, and that the NSA\n\nseizes all of the communications along at least one of those roads.\n\n       Thus, at least at this stage of the litigation, Wikimedia has standing to sue for a\n\nviolation of the Fourth Amendment. And, because Wikimedia has self-censored its\n\nspeech and sometimes forgone electronic communications in response to Upstream\n\nsurveillance, it also has standing to sue for a violation of the First Amendment. See Am.\n\nCivil Liberties Union, 785 F.3d at 802 (holding that complaint established standing to\n\nassert First Amendment violation in addition to Fourth Amendment violation because\n\n“[w]hen the government collects appellants’ metadata, appellants’ members’ interests in\n\nkeeping their associations and contacts private are implicated, and any potential ‘chilling\n\neffect’ is created at that point”); see also Cooksey v. Futrell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">721</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">226</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 235 (4th Cir.\n\n2013) (“In First Amendment cases, the injury-in-fact element is commonly satisfied by a\n\nsufficient showing of self-censorship, which occurs when a claimant is chilled from\n\nexercising his right to free expression.”) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).\n\n                                             2.\n\n       The government resists this conclusion, asserting that the Wikimedia Allegation\n\n“rest[s] on speculation as to the scope and scale of Upstream collection, and the means by\n\nwhich that collection is accomplished.” Appellees’ Br. at 23. The district court said\n\nmuch the same, and the best way to address this contention is by examining the ways in\n\nwhich that court misapplied Clapper’s discussion of speculative injury.\n\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\f       Unlike in Clapper, where the plaintiffs based their theories of standing on\n\nprospective or threatened injury and actions taken in response thereto, Wikimedia\n\npleaded an actual and ongoing injury, which renders Clapper’s certainly-impending\n\nanalysis inapposite here. Compare Schuchardt, 839 F.3d at 351 (distinguishing Clapper\n\nand its discussion of a “speculative chain of possibilities” because plaintiff’s “alleged\n\n[Fourth Amendment] injury has already occurred insofar as he claims the NSA seized his\n\nemails”), with Beck, 848 F.3d at 267–69, 274–75 (applying Clapper’s certainly\n\nimpending standard to a motion to dismiss an action under the Privacy Act of 1974, and\n\nfinding plaintiff’s allegation that “her information ‘will eventually be misused as a result\n\nof’” a data breach that compromised her personal information too speculative to establish\n\nstanding).\n\n       In other words, the Wikimedia Allegation is different in kind than the facts (or\n\nlack thereof) alleged in Clapper to establish standing at summary judgment. That brings\n\nus to our next point. By relying so heavily on Clapper, the district court blurred the line\n\nbetween the distinct burdens for establishing standing at the motion-to-dismiss and\n\nsummary-judgment stages of litigation.        Put another way, what may perhaps be\n\nspeculative at summary judgment can be plausible on a motion to dismiss.\n\n       For example, the district court characterized Wikimedia’s allegations as\n\n“speculative” based upon its own observation that it’s unclear whether the NSA is “using\n\n[its] surveillance equipment to its full potential” to intercept “all communications passing\n\nthrough” chokepoints upon which the NSA has installed surveillance equipment. J.A.\n\n190, 198–99. That observation might be appropriate with the benefit of an evidentiary\n\n\n                                            28\n\frecord at summary judgment, but coming as it did on a motion to dismiss, it had the\n\neffect of rejecting Wikimedia’s well-pleaded allegations and impermissibly injecting an\n\nevidentiary issue into a plausibility determination. See Schuchardt, 839 F.3d at 347–48\n\n(citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556); SDR, 801 F.3d at 431.\n\n       The district court made the same mistake by speculating that “the fact that all NSA\n\nsurveillance practices must survive FISC review . . . suggests that the NSA is not using\n\nits surveillance equipment to its full potential.” J.A. 190–91. Wikimedia’s reliance at the\n\nmotion-to-dismiss stage on publicly disclosed information about Upstream surveillance,\n\npurported NSA documents, technical rules about how the Internet works, and its\n\nunderstanding of its own operations is not, as the district court put it, “precisely the sort\n\nof speculative reasoning foreclosed by” Clapper’s discussion of how much factual\n\nmaterial is necessary to satisfy the certainly-impending prong of the injury-in-fact\n\nelement of Article III standing at summary judgment. J.A. 192. 8\n\n       That’s not to say that all of Wikimedia’s allegations as to injury are both plausible\n\nand actual or imminent. For example, the district court was right to take issue with\n\nWikimedia’s probability calculation, which “is incomplete and riddled with\n\nassumptions.” J.A. 197. But we need not look further into that allegation’s deficiencies,\n\nbecause Wikimedia doesn’t need it to establish standing.\n\n       We also reject the government’s argument that Wikimedia hasn’t pleaded enough\n\nfacts to establish injury flowing from its intercepted communications. To the contrary,\n\n       8\n        Like the Third Circuit, we assume without deciding that a heightened pleading\nstandard does not apply to national security cases.\n\n\n                                             29\n\fWikimedia’s detailed allegations suffice to plausibly establish cognizable injuries under\n\nthe First and Fourth Amendments.

At this stage of the\n\nlitigation, that is enough.\n\n       Finally, we decline the government’s invitation to consider its evidence, including\n\nthe two declarations, which it says “supports the district court’s analysis and undermines\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations about how they surmise Upstream surveillance operates.”\n\nAppellees’ Br. at 23. The district court treated the government’s motion to dismiss as a\n\nfacial challenge to the complaint and didn’t consider the government’s evidence. We will\n\nfollow suit and not look beyond the complaint and documents incorporated by reference\n\ntherein. See Beck, 848 F.3d at 270 (explaining the differences between facial and factual\n\nchallenges to standing). The government is free to bring a factual challenge on remand,\n\nwhere the district court in the first instance may consider Wikimedia’s argument—should\n\nit choose to raise it again—that the intertwined nature of the jurisdictional and merits\n\nquestions precludes such a challenge. 9\n\n\n\n\n       9\n       We decline to decide whether Wikimedia has established third-party standing.\nWikimedia may, of course, raise that argument on remand.\n\n\n                                           30\n\f                                             ***\n\n       We now turn to the Dragnet Allegation, which is that the NSA is “intercepting,\n\ncopying, and reviewing substantially all” text-based communications entering and\n\nleaving the United States. J.A. 46. The district court arrived at the correct conclusion as\n\nto whether this allegation establishes standing, but only by incorrectly analogizing to\n\nClapper. As we explain below, the reason this allegation fails to establish standing is that\n\nit does not contain enough well-pleaded facts entitled to the presumption of truth.\n\n                                             C.\n\n                                              1.\n\n       The Dragnet and Wikimedia Allegations share much in common. Because each\n\nalleges the same particularized and ongoing cognizable injuries, our analysis of the\n\ninjury-in-fact, traceability, and redressability elements of Article III standing with respect\n\nto the Wikimedia Allegation also applies here. But there’s a key difference in the scope\n\nof the two allegations. In the Dragnet Allegation, Plaintiffs must plausibly establish that\n\nthe NSA is intercepting “substantially all” text-based communications entering and\n\nleaving the United States, whereas it’s sufficient for purposes of the Wikimedia\n\nAllegation to show that the NSA is conducting Upstream surveillance on a single\n\nbackbone link. Because Plaintiffs don’t assert enough facts about Upstream’s operational\n\nscope to plausibly allege a dragnet, they have no Article III standing.\n\n       In support of a dragnet and in addition to the assertions in the Wikimedia\n\nAllegation, Plaintiffs allege the following: (1) “given the way the government has\n\ndescribed Upstream surveillance,” including that its “aim is to ‘comprehensively’ and\n\n\n                                             31\n\f‘reliably’ obtain communications to, from, and about targets scattered around the world,”\n\nthe NSA “has a strong incentive to intercept communications at as many backbone\n\nchokepoints as possible,” and indeed “must” be doing so “at many different backbone\n\nchokepoints,” J.A. 49–50; (2) the technical rules governing online communications make\n\nthis conclusion “especially true,” J.A. 50; and (3) a New York Times article asserts that\n\nthe NSA “is temporarily copying and then sifting through the contents of what is\n\napparently most e-mails and other text-based communications that cross the border,” J.A.\n\n51.\n\n       We hold that these allegations, even when supplemented by the Wikimedia\n\nAllegation, including that the NSA is conducting Upstream surveillance on at least seven\n\nbackbone links, 10 are insufficient to make plausible the claim that the NSA is intercepting\n\n“substantially all” text-based communications entering and leaving the United States.\n\n       To begin with, the New York Times article is effectively a recitation of the Dragnet\n\nAllegation, and as such we ascribe little significance to it. The dissent takes issue with\n\nour treatment of this article because—as it must—it predates the complaint. Our friend\n\n       10\n          Plaintiffs also reference “another NSA document [which] states that, in support\nof FAA [(i.e., the FISA Amendments Act of 2008)] surveillance, the ‘NSA has expended\na significant amount of resources to create collection/processing capabilities at many of\nthe chokepoints operated by U.S. providers.’” J.A. 51 (emphasis added). As Plaintiffs\nnote, there are “at least two kinds of surveillance” under the Act—PRISM and Upstream.\nJ.A. 40. Pointedly, and unlike in numerous other allegations throughout their complaint,\nincluding the immediately preceding one which references an “NSA slide illustrat[ing]\nthe Upstream surveillance facilitated by just a single provider . . . at seven . . .\nchokepoints,” J.A. 50, Plaintiffs decline to specify which type of surveillance the NSA\ndocument refers to. Accordingly, we accept this allegation as true, but give it little\nweight.\n\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fmisses the point. The article makes a broad statement almost identical to the Dragnet\n\nAllegation.   Under the dissent’s view, one expansive allegation is enough to make\n\nplausible another almost-identical allegation. That is not the law.\n\n       Furthermore, we accept as true Plaintiffs’ allegation about what the NSA is\n\nincentivized to do, but even so, that fact, without more, doesn’t establish a dragnet. That\n\nleaves Plaintiffs with their allegation about what the NSA “must” be doing, a contention\n\nthat lacks sufficient factual support to get “across the line from conceivable to plausible.”\n\nSee Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.\n\n       A point of emphasis—we are not rejecting the allegation because it’s phrased as\n\nan absolute. Indeed, we’ve already credited as true Plaintiffs’ allegation that the NSA\n\n“must be copying and reviewing all the international text-based communications that\n\ntravel across” backbone links which the NSA is surveilling. J.A. 48. We did so because\n\nWikimedia applied the rules governing Internet communications to Upstream\n\nsurveillance’s stated purpose to arrive at a reasonable conclusion about the technical\n\nmeans through which Upstream functions on the backbone links which the NSA surveils.\n\nOne ground for that conclusion’s reasonableness is that given that the NSA is surveilling\n\na link, the rules governing Internet communications necessarily affect, to some degree,\n\nthe way it surveils that link.\n\n       By contrast, in the Dragnet allegation, Plaintiffs seek to use the theory governing\n\nInternet communications in conjunction with Upstream surveillance’s stated purpose to\n\narrive at an allegation about what the program’s operational scope must be. But neither\n\ntheory nor purpose says anything about what the NSA is doing from an operational\n\n\n                                             33\n\fstandpoint. While both are relevant factors, without more they can’t establish a dragnet.\n\nIn that sense, the facts alleged here are far different than those in Schuchardt, where the\n\nplaintiff plausibly pleaded a dragnet under PRISM surveillance by describing “the\n\ntechnical means through which PRISM” functions and by “confirming PRISM’s\n\noperational scope and capabilities” through exhibits “replete with details.” 839 F.3d at\n\n349–50. Those exhibits included purported NSA slides which listed “company names\n\nand the dates they began cooperating with the” NSA and “confirm[ed] that . . . the scale\n\nof the data collected by PRISM is so vast that the Government [had] difficulty processing\n\nit according ‘to the norms to which [it had] become accustomed.’” Id. at 350.\n\n       The last hope for the Dragnet Allegation, then, is to supplement the “must”\n\nallegation with facts detailing Upstream’s operational scope. But even accepting the\n\nallegation that one telecommunications-service provider is facilitating Upstream\n\nsurveillance at 7 of the approximately 49 chokepoints, we still don’t think that Plaintiffs\n\nhave plausibly alleged a dragnet. The allegations here fall short of the level of detail in\n\nSchuchardt, and were we to accept Plaintiffs’ approach to standing, we would sanction\n\nthe extrapolation of the plausible from the conceivable.\n\n       Our recent decision in SD3 is not to the contrary. There, we considered the\n\nplausibility of a complaint alleging an antitrust conspiracy in violation of the Sherman\n\nAntitrust Act. 801 F.3d at 423. We explained that for such a “claim to survive . . . a\n\nplaintiff must plead parallel conduct and something ‘more.’”         Id. at 424 (quoting\n\nTwombly, 550 U.S. at 557)).         “That more,” we said, “must consist of further\n\ncircumstances pointing toward a meeting of the minds.” Id. (alteration and internal\n\n\n                                            34\n\fquotation marks omitted). The plaintiff in SD3 was able to establish that “more” by\n\nalleging the who, what, when, where, and why of a group boycott. Id. at 429–31.\n\n          Plaintiffs use our treatment of the “why” element in SD3 to attach special\n\nsignificance to their allegation that the NSA has a strong incentive to establish a dragnet.\n\nBut context is key. We observed in SD3 that “motivation for common action is a key\n\ncircumstantial fact.” Id. at 431 (emphasis added) (alteration and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     It should come as no surprise that motive is an important factor when\n\nestablishing an antitrust conspiracy.       SD3 does not, however, stand for the broad\n\nproposition that motivation is always of special significance in plausibly pleading an\n\ninjury.\n\n          Relatedly, the level of detail in the SD3 complaint is of a different magnitude than\n\nthe one here, and further supports our conclusion about the implausibility of the Dragnet\n\nAllegation. For example, the SD3 plaintiff “identifie[d] the particular time, place, and\n\nmanner in which the boycott initially formed” and gave “the means by which the\n\ndefendants sealed their boycott agreement: a majority vote.” Id. at 430. Those are the\n\nsorts of operational details, albeit in a case concerning a different subject matter, that are\n\nby and large absent here and which we think are vital to render plausible an allegation as\n\nsweeping as the one Plaintiffs posit. See Twombly, 550 U.S. at 558 (“[A] district court\n\nmust retain the power to insist upon some specificity in pleading before allowing a\n\npotentially massive factual controversy to proceed.”); Swanson v. Citibank, N.A., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"151889\"><a href=\"/opinion/151889/swanson-v-citibank-na/\"><span class=\"volume\">614</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 405 (7th Cir. 2010) (“A more complex case involving financial derivatives, or\n\ntax fraud that the parties tried hard to conceal, or antitrust violations, will require more\n\n\n                                               35\n\fdetail, both to give the opposing party notice of what the case is all about and to show\n\nhow, in the plaintiff’s mind at least, the dots should be connected.”).\n\n       The dissent says that this analysis is flawed because the NSA’s inability to predict\n\na communication’s path paired with its desire to “comprehensively acquire\n\ncommunications” renders plausible the allegation of a dragnet. The dissent thinks that’s a\n\n“logical extension” of our crediting as true Wikimedia’s allegation that the NSA reviews\n\nall communications that flow across each link that it surveils. Clearly, there are some\n\nsimilarities, in the sense that each allegation depends, in part, on the application of\n\ninternet theory to a statement about Upstream’s purpose. But, perhaps because it fails to\n\ngrapple with any of the relevant case law, the dissent misses two subtle but key\n\ndistinctions.\n\n       The allegation that we credit as true uses theory to explain how the NSA is doing\n\nsomething, given a defined operational scope. Moreover, that theory necessarily affects\n\nthe way the NSA does what we know it to be doing. Conversely, the allegation that we\n\ndo not credit as true uses theory to define scope. And, there’s no direct link between that\n\ntheory (the NSA doesn’t know a communication’s route) and operational scope. The\n\ndissent’s analysis has no limiting principle and, if adopted, would dilute the plausibility\n\npleading standard to a near-nullity.\n\n       In sum, Plaintiffs lack standing to sue for a violation of the Fourth Amendment\n\nunder the Dragnet Allegation because they can’t plausibly show that the NSA is\n\nintercepting their communications via a dragnet. From there, it follows that they also\n\nlack standing to sue for a violation of the First Amendment because “[a]llegations of a\n\n\n                                             36\n\fsubjective ‘chill’ are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific present objective\n\nharm or a threat of specific future harm.” Clapper, 133 S.

Nor can Plaintiffs establish\n\nstanding on the ground that Upstream surveillance compels them to take burdensome and\n\ncostly measures. The Dragnet Allegation’s implausibility leaves them with nothing more\n\nthan “fears of hypothetical future harm,” and they “cannot manufacture standing merely\n\nby inflicting harm on themselves based on” those fears. Id. at 1151. 11\n\n                                            2.\n\n       Before concluding, we briefly address the dissent’s contention that our analysis of\n\nthe non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs’ standing is superfluous.\n\n       Article III of the Constitution requires that we determine whether the non-\n\nWikimedia Plaintiffs have standing because the complaint rests upon the premise that the\n\nNSA is seizing each Plaintiff’s unique communications.          As such, it includes the\n\nfollowing request for individualized relief: “Order Defendants to purge all records of\n\nPlaintiffs’ communications in their possession obtained pursuant to Upstream\n\nsurveillance.” J.A. 84. Thus, the Constitution requires that each Plaintiff be able to\n\nplausibly allege the Fourth Amendment injury in fact that the NSA has seized its\n\ncommunications, because if a Plaintiff cannot do so it doesn’t have standing to, among\n\n       11\n          We reach the same conclusion as to Joshua Dratel, who is a member of the\nNational Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He too cannot show that his\ncommunications are being intercepted via a dragnet, and the district court correctly held\nthat the claim that one of his clients “has received notice of [Section 702 surveillance]”\ndidn’t plausibly allege that the NSA targeted his client with Upstream surveillance.

However, because I would find that the\n\nnon-Wikimedia Plaintiffs also have standing, I respectfully dissent in part.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       In order to explain my disagreement with the majority, I briefly recount the\n\nrelevant allegations in this case, taken as true, of course, at this stage of the proceedings.\n\nPlaintiffs make essentially two sets of factual allegations: the first explaining how\n\ninternational internet communications function and the second describing how the NSA\n\nsurveils international internet communications as they enter and exit the United States.\n\n       First, Plaintiffs allege that internet communications are governed by certain\n\ntechnical rules as they travel from sender to recipient. The majority of international\n\ninternet communications that move through the United States are transmitted through\n\nforty-nine submarine cables and a limited number of terrestrial cables. These cables\n\n(combined with the cables and networks that transmit domestic internet communications)\n\nare known as the internet backbone, and the different physical entry and exit points into\n\nthe United States are known as backbone links. The junctions where these cables meet\n\nare chokepoints through which nearly all international internet traffic passes. Internet\n\ncommunications do not flow along the backbone as discrete and intact entities but instead\n\nare broken into smaller packets of information. The packets that make up a single\n\ninternet communication travel to their common destination independently from one\n\nanother — in the process becoming intermingled with packets from unrelated\n\n                                             40\n\fcommunications — and are reassembled only once they reach their destination. Each\n\npacket reaches its destination following a different and wholly unpredictable path, which\n\nis determined by rapidly changing factors such as network conditions. Because packets\n\ntravel along independent and dynamic paths, communications sent between two\n\nindividuals in “real-time” can traverse different backbone links “even though the end\n\npoints are the same.” J.A. 50. Similarly, a single individual’s communications sent at\n\ndifferent times can traverse different backbone links.\n\n       Second, based on the government’s disclosures and media reports, Plaintiffs allege\n\nthat the NSA is surveilling internet communications as they travel along the internet\n\nbackbone, a practice known as Upstream surveillance. The NSA accomplishes this by\n\ninstalling surveillance devices at backbone links, which allow the agency to copy the\n\ninternet communications traversing these links.          The NSA searches the copied\n\ncommunications for selectors. Selectors are “specific communications facilit[ies]” (e.g.\n\nemail address, telephone numbers, and IP addresses) associated with the NSA’s foreign\n\nsurveillance targets. PCLOB Report 32. The NSA retains communications sent to or\n\nfrom a selector as well as communications containing a selector in their content, which\n\nare known as “about communications.” About communications are not necessarily sent\n\nto or from a foreign surveillance target. According to the government’s disclosures,\n\nsurveillance of about communications is necessary because the NSA seeks to\n\n“comprehensively acquire communications that are sent to or from its targets.” Id. at 10.\n\nWith respect to the scope of Upstream surveillance, the New York Times reported that,\n\nthrough the use of this form of surveillance, the NSA is copying “what is apparently most\n\n                                            41\n\fe-mails and other text-based communications that cross the border.” J.A. 51. Plaintiffs\n\nalso quote an NSA document that states the “NSA has expended a significant amount of\n\nresources to create collection/processing capabilities at many of the chokepoints operated\n\nby U.S. providers through which international communications enter and leave the\n\nUnited States.” Id.\n\n                                            II.\n\n       I agree with the majority’s analysis concluding that Clapper v.

However, the majority errs, both by\n\nreaching out to decide the issue of the non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs’ standing 1 and, as well,\n\n\n       1\n          See Horne v.

In any event,\nthis case actually fits within the majority’s “same relief” paradigm because all plaintiffs\nseek declaratory and injunctive relief intended to shut down the government’s Upstream\nsurveillance program. The mere fact that a “purging order” of the sort contemplated by\nthe majority would operate only to “purge” seized communications of a particular\nplaintiff is a thin reed indeed on which to base the majority’s unnecessary door-closing\nresult.\n(Continued)\n                                            42\n\fin the answer it gives to the question it need not even reach in holding that the non-\n\nWikimedia Plaintiffs’ lack standing because the pertinent allegations are not plausible.\n\n       In order to find that Wikimedia has standing in this action, the majority credits as\n\ntrue three factual allegations. First, because Wikimedia sends and receives so many\n\ninternational internet communications, its communications travel across every internet\n\nbackbone link. Second, based on the government’s disclosures, the NSA is surveilling at\n\nleast one backbone link. Third, the NSA intercepts and copies every packet that passes\n\nthrough the backbone link(s) being surveilled (what the majority calls the Wikimedia\n\nAllegation). The third allegation is not based on Plaintiffs’ knowledge of the NSA’s\n\nsurveillance techniques. Instead, the majority finds this factual allegation is plausible\n\n\n\n\n        It is not clear to me why the majority elects to ignore the Chief Justice’s sage\nadmonition: “[I]f it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more.”\nPDK Labs., Inc. v.

Needless to say, we\nshould avoid imposing such a requirement in the absence of the absolute necessity that\nwe do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                              43\n\fbecause it is based on Upstream surveillance’s stated purpose and the technical rules that\n\ngovern internet communications.       The logical chain is as follows: The NSA has\n\nacknowledged that it uses Upstream surveillance to target “about communications,”\n\nwhich contain a selector in the content of the communication. Before it can search the\n\ncontents of an internet communication that has been broken up into discrete packets\n\nwhile in transit, the NSA must copy and reassemble all of the packets that make up the\n\ncommunication. However, packets from targeted communications cannot be segregated\n\nfrom the packets of unrelated communications. Thus, in order to “reliably” intercept\n\ntargeted communications, the NSA must copy all of the packets that flow across a\n\nbackbone link so that the government can be assured that it has captured all of the packets\n\nthat make up the targeted communication (and in the process capturing unrelated\n\npackets). J.A. 48–49.\n\n       Conversely, under the majority’s “crabbed plausibility analysis,” see Woods v.\n\nCity of Greensboro, --- F.3d ---, ---, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2017</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1754898</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *2 (4th Cir. 2017), the non-\n\nWikimedia Plaintiffs are denied standing because, in the majority’s view, those Plaintiffs\n\nrely on an implausible guess regarding Upstream surveillance’s operational scope. For\n\nthe non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs to have standing, according to the majority, Plaintiffs must\n\nplausibly allege an additional fact beyond those discussed with respect to Wikimedia: the\n\nNSA is surveilling most backbone links (what the majority calls the Dragnet Allegation).\n\nJust as with the Wikimedia Allegation, Plaintiffs base this factual allegation on Upstream\n\n\n\n\n                                            44\n\fsurveillance’s stated purpose and the technical rules governing internet communications. 2\n\nHowever, the majority finds this allegation implausible because it believes that “neither\n\ntheory nor purpose says anything about what the NSA is doing from an operational\n\nstandpoint.” Op. at 33. This misapprehends the full scope of Plaintiffs’ allegations.\n\n        Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that the NSA surveils most backbone links\n\nbecause — based on the technical rules governing internet communications — the agency\n\ncannot know which link the communications it targets will traverse when they enter or\n\nleave the United States. The path that packets take along the internet backbone is\n\ndetermined dynamically based on unpredictable conditions. Thus, a communication sent\n\nby a surveillance target can enter the United States through one backbone link, but an\n\nimmediate response returned to the surveillance target can traverse a different backbone\n\nlink.   Similarly, communications sent by a surveillance target at different times or\n\nlocations can traverse different backbone links.      Given this technical limitation, the\n\ngovernment’s    disclosure    that   the   NSA    seeks    to   “comprehensively     acquire\n\ncommunications that are sent to or from its targets,” J.A. 49, renders Plaintiffs’ allegation\n\nplausible.   If the NSA cannot know which backbone link its targets’ internet\n\n\n\n        2\n         Plaintiffs provide additional support for this allegation by corroborating it with a\nN.Y. Times report, which stated that the NSA is surveilling “most e-mails and other text-\nbased communications that cross the border.” J.A. 51. The majority finds that this report\nis entitled to “little significance” because it “is effectively a recitation of” Plaintiffs’\nallegation. Op. at 32. The N.Y. Times report predates the complaint, however; thus, the\nallegation is a “recitation” of the factual news report, not the other way around.\nMoreover, the fact that Plaintiffs based their allegation on factual news reporting rather\nthan their own conjecture means the allegation is entitled to more weight not less.\n\n                                             45\n\fcommunications will traverse, then the only way it can comprehensively acquire its\n\ntargets’ communications is by surveilling virtually every backbone link.\n\n       This allegation is essentially a logical extension of Plaintiffs’ earlier allegation that\n\nthe NSA must copy every communication that flows across a backbone link it surveils.\n\nJust as it is plausible that the government must copy all of the packets that flow through a\n\nbackbone link in order to “reliably” capture the packets that make up a targeted internet\n\ncommunication, because the government does not know across which backbone link a\n\ncommunication will travel, it is also plausible that the government must monitor virtually\n\nevery link in order to “comprehensively” capture its targets’ communications. Given that\n\nwe review here a motion to dismiss and not a motion for summary judgment, the\n\nnon-Wikimedia Plaintiffs have provided enough factual support to their allegation to\n\nsurvive dismissal.\n\n                                              III.\n\n       For the reasons set forth, while I discern no need whatsoever to review the district\n\ncourt’s legal determination of the non-Wikimedia Plaintiffs’ standing, I respectfully\n\ndissent from the majority opinion’s unnecessary resolution of that issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                              46\n\f</pre>",
