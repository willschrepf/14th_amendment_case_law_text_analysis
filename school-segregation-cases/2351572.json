CRONE, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Pending before the court is Defendant J.A.M. Distributing Company's (\"J.A.M.\") Motion for Summary Judgment (#36). J.A.M. moves for summary judgment on an action brought by Plaintiff Richard C. Martin (\"Martin\") alleging racial discrimination in employment and retaliation arising under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (\"Section 1981\"), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2000h-6 (\"Title VII\"), and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.001-21.306 (\"TCHRA\"). Having reviewed the pending motion, the submissions of the parties, the pleadings, and the applicable law, the court is of the opinion that summary judgment is not warranted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On September 9, 2003, Jonas Wolfe (\"Wolfe\"), the Area Manager for J.A.M.'s Beaumont, Texas, region, hired Martin, an African-American male, to work as a bobtail driver in J.A.M.'s Beaumont terminal. J.A.M. buys, sells, and transports fuel, oils, and lubricants throughout the United States, maintaining facilities in Houston, Beaumont, Galveston, Dallas, and Lufkin, Texas. In June 2007, J.A.M. trained Martin to become a transport driver. The responsibilities of such a position include picking up trailers of petroleum products from J.A.M.'s customers and delivering them to its storage facilities for unloading into storage tanks.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, June 27, 2007, James Bush (\"Bush\"), a Caucasian co-worker, dispatched Martin to pick up a trailer containing the lubricant DTE 26 from the ExxonMobil facility in Beaumont and to unload it into a tank of DTE 26 on J.A.M.'s premises for storage purposes. Upon his return, Martin and Bush completed a Tank Farm Unloading Checklist required by J.A.M. for the purpose of identifying the driver unloading the lubricant, in this case, Martin, and the supervising employee, referred to as the spotter, Bush, and to confirm that the unloading occurred at the proper location and in accordance with company guidelines. As the spotter, Bush was required to serve as a secondary check by verifying that the correct trailer was brought to the J.A.M. premises and that the correct product was unloaded into <span class=\"star-pagination\">*828</span> the storage tank by taking a sample of the lubricant. Although Bush signed the bottom of the checklist confirming that Martin had transported the correct trailer, approximately twenty-five to thirty minutes later, Martin discovered that he had picked up the wrong trailer and subsequently cross-contaminated two different products. Martin immediately notified Bush of the mistake. At that time, Bush called their supervisor, Wolfe, to inform him of the cross-contamination. Wolfe told Martin and Bush that he would meet with them the next day to discuss the incident.</p>\n<p>The following day, June 28, 2007, Wolfe met with Martin and Bush to talk about the cross-contamination. During the meeting, Wolfe suspended Martin without pay for two days  June 28 and June 29, 2007. Additionally, Wolfe filled out a Notice of Disciplinary Suspension for Martin, which Bush signed as a witness. According to Martin, Wolfe did not issue Bush any type of disciplinary action at the meeting.<sup>[1]</sup> Martin contends that, at the end of the meeting, he reminded Wolfe that he would be out on vacation for the week of July 4, 2007, and that Wolfe verbally approved his vacation at this time. Wolfe maintains that he told Martin he could not accommodate his request, indicating that he would approve Martin's vacation for only July 5 and July 6, 2007.</p>\n<p>On Friday, June 29, 2007, Martin called J.A.M.'s Safety Director Owen Olson (\"Olson\") to report what he perceived to be disparate treatment between himself and Bush. Martin expressed his dismay that Bush had not been suspended following the cross-contamination incident, when both he and Bush admitted they shared responsibility for the occurrence. Subsequently, Olson reported the complaint to Wolfe and Cindy Garbutt (\"Garbutt\"), J.A.M.'s Human Resource Manager.</p>\n<p>Martin failed to report to work for the week of July 2 through July 6, 2007. Martin alleges that he spent this week on vacation with his family and that he called his supervisor's office to check in on Monday, July 2, 2007, and Tuesday, July 3, 2007. Martin further maintains that on July 2, 2007, Wolfe instructed Bush to remove Martin from the work schedule for July 3, 2007, and not to place him back on the schedule until further notice. J.A.M. concedes that Wednesday, July 4, 2007, was a company holiday in observance of Independence Day, on which Martin was not scheduled to work, and that Martin was approved for vacation on July 5 and 6, 2007. Thus, for the week of July 2, 2007, J.A.M. asserts that Martin failed to call or report to work only on July 2 and 3, 2007.</p>\n<p>Martin also failed to report to work on Monday, July 9, 2007. In explaining his absence, Martin claims that on July 8, 2007, he called Wolfe's cellular telephone to notify him of the death of his childhood friend's grandmother, Madea. According to Martin, he received Wolfe's permission to miss work on the following day, July 9, 2007. To the contrary, Wolfe asserts that Martin never received permission to miss work on July 9, 2007.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*829</span> Following his return to work, on July 10, 2007, J.A.M. maintains that Wolfe terminated Martin for his failure to report to work on three consecutive work days  July 2, 3, and 9, 2007, in violation of J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. Specifically, the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Regular attendance on the job is important to J.A.M. Distributing Company's operations. Frequent or unexplained absences from work, or tardiness in reporting for work, will seriously affect an employee's performance and evaluation. As a result, J.A.M. will discipline employees for tardiness and absenteeism up to and including termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>If an employee fails to report to work and does not notify his/her supervisor for three (3) consecutive days, the employee will be considered to have \"voluntarily resigned\" their duties and responsibilities as a J.A.M. employee.</i></blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis in original). Martin contends that despite his pleading with Wolfe to let him keep his job, Wolfe stated, \"I can't find it in my heart to forgive you . . . for saying that I discriminated against you; and I'm going to have to terminate you.\"</p>\n<p>In December 2007, Martin filed a charge of discrimination and retaliation with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (\"EEOC\"). On May 14, 2008, the EEOC issued Martin a Notice of Right to Sue letter. Subsequently, on May 29, 2008, Martin initiated this action, alleging that he was terminated because of his race and in retaliation for reporting acts of discrimination to J.A.M.'s Safety Department in violation of Section 1981, Title VII, and the TCHRA. In its Second Amended Answer, filed August 20, 2008, J.A.M. denies that Martin's termination was the result of any discriminatory or retaliatory conduct. On April 3, 2009, J.A.M. filed the instant motion seeking summary judgment on the claims asserted by Martin, arguing that he cannot establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of employment discrimination or retaliation and is unable to show J.A.M.'s reason for terminating his employment was a pretext for racial discrimination or retaliation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Summary Judgment Standard</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment \"shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R.CIV.P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <i>Celotex Corp. v.

In its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. asserts that Martin's unexcused absences for three consecutive work days violate the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. J.A.M. argues that, as a result of this violation, Wolfe terminated Martin on July 10, 2007. Martin, however, contends that his termination was racially motivated.</p>\n<p>Where there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff must initially establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination by satisfying a multi-factor test from which a discriminatory motive may be inferred, thus creating a rebuttable presumption of intentional discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 142-43, 120 S.Ct. 2097; <i>Alvarado,</i> 492 F.3d at 611; <i>Burrell v. Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Bottling Group, Inc.,</i> 482 F.3d 408, 411 (5th Cir.2007); <i>Turner,</i> 476 F.3d at 345. To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory discharge under Title VII, a plaintiff may show that:</p>\n<blockquote>(1) he is a member of a protected class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) he was qualified for the position;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) he was discharged; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*833</span> (4) he was replaced by someone outside the protected class.</blockquote>\n<p><i>See </i><i>Fahim,</i> 551 F.3d at 350; <i>Alvarado,</i> 492 F.3d at 611; <i>McCoy,</i> 492 F.3d at 556; <i>Turner,</i> 476 F.3d at 345; <i>Frank v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 347 F.3d 130, 137 (5th Cir.2003). In this case, Martin was later replaced by Cilton Williams, an African-American male. Nevertheless, \"it is well settled that, although replacement with a nonmember of the protected class is evidence of discriminatory intent, it is not essential to the establishment of a <i>prima facie</i> case under Title VII.\" <i>Williams v. Trader Publ'g Co.,</i> 218 F.3d 481, 485 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <i>Hornsby v. Conoco, Inc.,</i> 777 F.2d 243, 246-47 (5th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p>Thus, in the alternative, a plaintiff may establish a <i>prima facie</i> case by demonstrating that he is a member of a protected class, he was qualified for the position, and similarly situated persons outside the class were treated more favorably than he. <i>See </i><i>Fahim,</i> 551 F.3d at 350; <i>Alvarado,</i> 492 F.3d at 611; <i>McCoy,</i> 492 F.3d at 557; <i>Septimus v. University of Houston,</i> 399 F.3d 601, 609 (5th Cir.2005); <i>Laxton,</i> 333 F.3d at 579 n. 1. To establish a prima facie case in this manner, the plaintiff must show that employees not of his protected class received preferential treatment under circumstances nearly identical to his. <i>See </i><i>Berquist v. Washington Mut. Bank,</i> 500 F.3d 344, 353 (5th Cir.2007), <i>cert. denied,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 1124, 169 L.Ed.2d 950 (2008); <i>Culwell v.

Ctr.,</i> 245 F.3d 507, 514 (5th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p>Moreover, in work-rule violation cases, such as this, \"a Title VII plaintiff may establish a <i>prima facie</i> case by showing `either that he did not violate the rule or that, if he did, white employees who engaged in similar acts were not punished similarly.'\" <i>Mayberry v. Vought Aircraft Co.,</i> 55 F.3d 1086, 1090 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <i>Green v. Armstrong Rubber Co.,</i> 612 F.2d 967, 968 (5th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 449 U.S. 879, 101 S.Ct. 227, 66 L.Ed.2d 102 (1980)); <i>see </i><i>Greene v. Potter,</i> 240 Fed. Appx. 657, 660 (5th Cir.2007). To establish disparate discipline, the plaintiff must show that other employees were treated more favorably under circumstances \"nearly identical\" to his. <i>See </i><i>Mayberry,</i> 55 F.3d at 1090 (citing <i>Little v. Republic Ref. Co.,</i> 924 F.2d 93, 97 (5th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p>Here, Martin attempts to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case by asserting that he did not violate J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy, but that, assuming he did, J.A.M. engaged in disparate treatment because a similarly situated, non-African-American employee was treated more favorably under nearly identical circumstances.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>a. <i>No Violation of Work Rule</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Martin contends that he did not violate J.A.M.'s Absenteeism and Tardiness Policy because he had permission to take a vacation during the time period when he allegedly failed to report to work and, on numerous occasions, he contacted his supervisor during his absence. Martin asserts that during his meeting with Wolfe on Thursday, June 28, 2007, he reminded him that he would be out on vacation for the week of July 4, 2007. At deposition, Martin testified that the following conversation transpired:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: So, during the meeting, when you actually reminded Jonas [Wolfe] that you were supposed to be off July the 2nd through July the 6th, what did hehow did he respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: During the meeting when I was suspended I remember saying \"Well, he's going to\"I remember him telling me \"You're suspended for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*834</span> Thursday, [June 28, 2007] and you're suspended for Friday[, June 29, 2007].\" And I said \"Well, now, you know next week I'm on vacation.\" He goes \"Yeah. I know you're on vacation next week.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: When you said that you were on vacation \"next week,\" did you specifically tell Jonas which days you wanted or you were planning to be on vacation; or did you just say \"next week\"?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: \"I'm on vacation all next week.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Ok. And what  and did he approve that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: He knew it. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p>Conversely, Wolfe maintains that Martin did not have his permission to miss work on Monday, July 2, 2007, or Tuesday, July 3, 2007. Wolfe, however, admits that he permitted Martin to take vacation on Thursday, July 5, 2007, and Friday, July 6, 2007.<sup>[2]</sup> At deposition, Wolfe recalled a different version of the conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: Did Mr. Martin remind you during this meeting that the following week he had a planned vacation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: He did not remind me. It was the very first time I had heard about the vacation plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Okay. It was during this meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: It was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: What did Mr. Martin tell you about his vacation plans?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Both him and Jim [Bush] acknowledged that they had discussed and talked about him taking the following week off, in which I vividly remember actually leaning over my desk and telling Rick [Martin] that I needed him back at work Monday[, July 2, 2007,] and Tuesday[, July 3, 2007,] and that I would meet him in the middle and give him vacation for Thursday[, July 5, 2007,] and Friday[, July 6, 2007]. We had Wednesday[, July 4, 2007,] off as a holiday.</blockquote>\n<p>In any event, on July 2 and July 3, 2007, Martin did not report to work. In its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. contends that Martin failed to report to work on these days in direct violation of Wolfe's instructions. Martin responds that he spent July 2 through July 6, 2007, on an approved vacation with his family and on July 2, 2007, and July 3, 2007, he called his supervisor at the Beaumont terminal to check-in. Martin's cellular telephone records indicate that on July 2, 2007, he made three outgoing calls to J.A.M.'s Beaumont office  the first at 8:49 a.m., lasting one minute, the second at 8:50 a.m., lasting two minutes, and the third at 11:38 a.m., lasting three minutes. At deposition, Wolfe denied receiving any calls or voicemails from Martin on July 2, 2007. On July 3, 2007, Martin's cellular telephone records show that he placed a call, lasting eight minutes, to J.A.M.'s Beaumont office at 7:42 a.m.<sup>[3]</sup> Moreover, Bush revealed at deposition that, on July 2, 2007, Wolfe instructed him to take Martin off the schedule for July 3, 2007, and not to schedule him again until further notice. Martin, therefore, argues that he was not scheduled to work on July 3, 2007. Nevertheless, J.A.M. maintains that Martin did not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*835</span> have permission to miss work on July 2 and July 3, 2007.</p>\n<p>Martin further asserts that on Sunday, July 8, 2007, he again called Wolfe's cellular telephone to inform him of the death of his childhood friend's grandmother, Madea. Indeed, Martin's cellular telephone records demonstrate that on July 8, 2007, he placed a call lasting one minute to Wolfe's work cellular telephone at 8:26 p.m. Martin contends that during this call he received permission from Wolfe to miss work on the following day, July 9, 2007.<sup>[4]</sup> Wolfe denies giving Martin permission and asserts that he does not recollect receiving a call from Martin. At deposition, however, Wolfe recalled that upon arriving at work on the morning of July 9, 2007, his office informed him that Martin had called to say that his grandmother had passed away. Nonetheless, J.A.M. asserts that Martin's absence on July 9, 2007, was not excused.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, July 10, 2007, when Martin returned to work, Wolfe terminated him. In its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. asserts that Martin was terminated because he failed to report to work, as scheduled on three consecutive dates  July 2, 3, and 9, 2007, and did not call to notify Wolfe, in violation of J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy.<sup>[5]</sup> In its reply to Martin's response to its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. argues that \"the evidence is clear that Mr. Wolfe did not approve Martin's vacation for July 2, 2007, and July 3, 2007, and Mr. Martin failed to call in to get approval for an additional day off on July 9, 2007; this failure by Mr. Martin resulted in three consecutive work days of unexcused absences.\" The court, however, finds the record on the issue unclear.</p>\n<p>J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy explicitly provides that an employee is considered to have \"voluntarily resigned\" if he neither shows up for work nor notifies his supervisor for three consecutive days. Based on these circumstances, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Martin's actions did not violate the policy. While Martin does not dispute that he was absent from work on July 2, 3, and 9, 2007, a fact issue exists as to whether he had permission to miss work or notified his supervisor of his anticipated absence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Disparate Treatment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Alternatively, Martin argues that even if he violated the Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy, he has adduced evidence demonstrating that Bush, a Caucasian co-worker, was not punished similarly. Martin contends that Bush was treated in a more lenient fashion after they both admitted to violating J.A.M.'s Tank Farm Unloading Checklist Policy. Martin asserts that, in the meeting on June 28, 2007, Wolfe issued Martin a Notice of Suspension and suspended him without pay for two days, while Wolfe did not discipline Bush, who was not allegedly suspended until after Martin complained of disparate treatment to Olson. Although Martin questions whether Bush was ever suspended, he argues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*836</span> that even if he was, the two employees were still treated differently when they both subsequently violated a company policy. Martin maintains that both his and Bush's Notice of Suspension indicate that a repeated infraction would result in termination. Martin asserts that, when he allegedly violated the Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy, he was terminated; but, when Bush allegedly violated a company safety policy, he merely received a warning.</p>\n<p>J.A.M. contends that Martin's argument fails because Martin and Bush were not involved in or accused of the same violation for which Martin was ultimately terminated. The court agrees. Fifth Circuit precedent establishes that employees who engage in different violations of company policy are not similarly situated. <i>See </i><i>Smith v. Wal-Mart Stores,</i> 891 F.2d 1177, 1180 (5th Cir.1990); <i>Sagaral v. Wal-Mart Stores Tex. LP,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d 782, 799 (S.D.Tex.2007); <i>Tabatchnik v. Continental Airlines,</i> No. H-06-1095, 2006 WL 3499524, at *5 (S.D.Tex. Dec. 5, 2006); <i>see also </i><i>Okoye,</i> 245 F.3d at 514. \"[T]he conduct at issue is not nearly identical when the difference between the plaintiff's conduct and that of those alleged to be similarly situated accounts for the difference in treatment received from the employer.\" <i>Wallace,</i> 271 F.3d at 221. Martin has alleged that the adverse employment action that he suffered was his termination on July 10, 2007,<sup>[6]</sup> and J.A.M. responded by asserting that Martin was terminated for violating the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. The conduct for which Martin was terminated was not nearly identical to the conduct for which Bush was later disciplined.<sup>[7]</sup> Accordingly, the court finds that Martin has failed to raise a fact issue as to whether he was treated differently than Bush. <i>See </i><i>Okoye,</i> 245 F.3d at 514 (citing <i>Little,</i> 924 F.2d at 97; <i>Smith,</i> 891 F.2d at 1180).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Martin is unable to identify any employee who received more favorable treatment under the Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. At deposition, Martin was asked to identify any employee who, without permission, missed work in violation of company policy and was not disciplined. He responded, \"I don't know any of them.\" Therefore, the court finds that Martin's evidence does not support his contention that he was treated differently from another employee outside of his protected class. Accordingly, he fails to make a <i>prima facie</i> case on this basis.</p>\n<p>Although Martin has not established that an employee outside of his protected class received preferential treatment under nearly identical circumstances, the court nonetheless finds that he has established a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*837</span> based on his termination for a work-rule violation that he arguably did not violate. The court, therefore, continues its analysis under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because Martin has raised a genuine issue of fact with regard to his alleged work-rule violation and resulting discharge, J.A.M. must set forth an adequate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Once the plaintiff establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulatebut not provea legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. <i>Raytheon Co. v.

J.A.M. presents unrebutted evidence of a company policy stating that an employee who fails to report to work and does not notify his supervisor for three consecutive days will be considered to have voluntarily resigned and that the employer will discipline an employee for tardiness and absenteeism up to and including termination. In his affidavit, dated April 3, 2009, Wolfe details the circumstances surrounding Martin's termination, stating, in pertinent part: \"During that meeting I terminated Mr. Martin because of his failure to report to work, as scheduled on three consecutive work daysJuly 2, 3, and 9, 2007, and failure to obtain permission from me for the unexcused absences in advance in violation of `J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy.'\" Hence, the court finds that J.A.M. has articulated a specific, nondiscriminatory reason for Martin's dischargeviolation of the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism Policywhich permits the conclusion that Martin's termination was not based on discriminatory animus, thus satisfying J.A.M.'s burden on production.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Pretext for Discrimination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having found both a prima facie case for discrimination and a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Martin's termination, to prevail, Martin \"`must provide some evidence, direct or circumstantial, to rebut each of the employer's proffered reasons and allow the jury to infer that the employer's explanation was a pretext for discrimination.'\" <i>Rutherford v.

Martin adduces the following evidence in support of his contention. On July 23, 2007, in response to Martin's application with the Texas Workforce Commission for unemployment benefits, Garbutt gave the following explanation for Martin's termination:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*840</span> Due to not following written policy and procedures of using a checklist to verify correct product, trailer, tank  bulk lubricants were off-loaded from tank trailer into the wrong tank  thus costing the company approximately $50,000.00.</blockquote>\n<p>Nevertheless, in an e-mail to Garbutt dated July 25, 2007, Wolfe described his reasoning, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>1. He made a HUGE error (more so than the spotter-he had complete responsibility for the load-he was dispatched as THE driver-HE backed up to the wrong trailer)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. He did not show up for work for 3 days after his suspension and did not contact me directly</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. He really pissed me off by accusing me of discriminating against him AFTER I saved his job!!!!!</blockquote>\n<p>Subsequently, on December 4, 2007, Martin filed a charge of racial discrimination and retaliation with the EEOC. On January 7, 2008, Wolfe responded to an inquiry regarding Martin's termination and provided a summary of events surrounding his discharge:</p>\n<blockquote> June 27, 2007. Rick Martin failed to comply with company unloading procedures (attached) that resulted in product contamination and a financial loss in excess of $50,000 to the company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> June 28, 2007. As a result of product unloading error, Rick Martin and Jim Bush (co-worker involved in unloading error) were given a two day suspension from work without pay. (suspension forms in HR file)</blockquote>\n<blockquote> July 2 &amp; 3, 2007. Rick Martin did not report to work as scheduled and failed to contact supervisor with notification of absence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote> July 10, 2007. Rick Martin was terminated for not reporting to work as scheduled.</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, in an affidavit dated January 23, 2008, Wolfe states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>4. Mr. Martin failed to return to work on Monday, July 2, 2007, did not come into work on July 3, 4, or 5, and failed to contact me regarding this absence as required by J.A.M. policy. Under J.A.M. policy, failure to appear for work for three consecutive days without calling in results in termination. I did not retaliate against Mr. Martin for claiming he was discriminated against; I terminated him because he did not report to work as scheduled and did not contact me as required.</blockquote>\n<p>On January 24, 2008, J.A.M. submitted Wolfe's affidavit and its Position Statement in response to the claims made in Martin's EEOC Charge of Discrimination. J.A.M. maintains that Martin \"was terminated for failing to return to work as scheduled and failing to contact his supervisor regarding his absence as required.\"</p>\n<p>At deposition on March 10, 2009, Wolfe testified that Martin was a no call, no show for July 2, 3, and 7, 2007:</p>\n<blockquote>A: I asked Mr. Martin to come to work on Monday, July 2nd, and Tuesday, July 3rd. I granted him permission to take vacation the 5th and the 6th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: And by requiring him to come to work on July 2nd and 3rd, you denied his request for vacation, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Yes, for those two days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: And you granted him vacation for Thursday-Wednesday, which was a holiday, Thursday and Friday, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p>Following his deposition, in an affidavit dated April 3, 2009, Wolfe states that he granted Martin's vacation request for only July 5, 2007, and July 6, 2007. Wolfe further asserts that during their meeting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*841</span> on Tuesday, July 10, 2007, \"I terminated Mr. Martin because of his failure to report to work as scheduled on three consecutive work daysJuly 2, 3, and 9, 2007, and failure to obtain permission from me in advance in violation of J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy.\"</p>\n<p>The court notes that there is no evidence of formal documentation indicating that Martin violated J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy until Wolfe's statement on January 7, 2008, following Martin's filing of his charge of discrimination and retaliation with the EEOC. In fact, based on Wolfe's deposition testimony, it is questionable whether he ever told Martin that he was being terminated for violating the Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. Rather, Wolfe explained that the bulk of their conversation on July 10, 2007, surrounded Martin's report of discrimination:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: You speak [sic] to Mr. Martin when you arrived at the office on the 10th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: And what was the contents of that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Well, unfortunately it probably mostly surrounded about-surrounded the claims of mistreatment. From a personal level I wanted to understand from him how he felt that I mistreated him when I felt completely opposite, and consequently it did end with his termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: What did you ask him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: \"Explain to me, Rick [Martin], how you feel like I mistreated you. I was told by Owen [Olsen] that you felt like you had been mistreated when in fact I went against the recommendation for termination and kept you on board as an employee. How was that unfair?\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And I actually even went on to let him knowhe had mentioned that he contacted an attorney, that he was that serious about that, and so still in a confused state, I wanted for my own gratification an understanding of how he felt I mistreated him.</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, at deposition, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: Why did you terminate Mr. Martin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Because he did not show up to work when he was scheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: What did you tell Mr. Martin was the reason for his termination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: I don't recall telling him. And let me explain. After we talkedexcuse me, during our conversation, in which I explained the nature of my intent for suspension and went on to recap from my point of view what has happened with events leading up to that moment, with him looking for a job the day of the incident, him acknowledging to me that he would show up on Monday and Tuesday and didn't, was an indication that he was gone. I did not expect him to come back. He said at that moment, quote, Are you firing me? And I said, Yes. I did not have to offer that.</blockquote>\n<p>In sum, Martin urges that the evidence demonstrates pretext based on the shifting and inconsistent explanations provided by J.A.M. for his termination. J.A.M. counters that the minor discrepancies pointed out by Martin were merely clerical errors or innocent oversights. J.A.M. argues that its management has consistently testified that Martin was terminated for violating the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism policy.</p>\n<p>Pretext may be inferred where the defendant has provided inconsistent or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*842</span> conflicting explanations for its conduct at different times. <i>See </i><i>Nasti,</i> 492 F.3d at 594 (citing <i>Read v.

Sears Roebuck &amp; Co.,</i> 243 F.3d 846, 852-53 (4th Cir.2001)). Moreover, when a defendant offers inconsistent explanations for termination, the plaintiff is not required to produce additional evidence of discrimination or retaliation for the defendant's reason to terminate him. <i>See id.</i> (citing <i>Gee,</i> 289 F.3d at 348).

Here, Martin indisputably engaged in protected activity when he reported the alleged discrimination to J.A.M.'s Safety Department, thus establishing the first element of a <i>prima face</i> case of retaliation. <i>See </i><i>Ackel v.

As the Fifth Circuit has commented:</p>\n<blockquote>At first glance, the ultimate issue in an unlawful retaliation casewhether the defendant discriminated against the plaintiff <i>because</i> the plaintiff engaged in conduct protected by Title VIIseems identical to the third element of the plaintiffs prima facie casewhether a <i>causal</i> link exists between the adverse employment action and the protected activity. However, the standards of proof applicable to these questions differ significantly.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Long,</i> 88 F.3d at 305 n. 4 (emphasis in original). In order to establish the requisite causal link, a plaintiff need not prove that his protected activity was the sole factor in motivating the employer's challenged decision. <i>See </i><i>Mauder v. Metropolitan Transit Auth.,</i> 446 F.3d 574, 583 (5th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 549 U.S. 884, 127 S.Ct. 230, 166 L.Ed.2d 147 (2006) (citation omitted); <i>Gee,</i> 289 F.3d at 345; <i>Evans,</i> 246 F.3d at 354; <i>Medina,</i> 238 F.3d at 684; <i>Long,</i> 88 F.3d at 305 n. 4. Rather, a causal link is established when the evidence demonstrates that the employer's decision to take adverse action was based in part on knowledge of the employee's protected activity. <i>See </i><i>Ackel,</i> 339 F.3d at 385-86 (citing <i>Medina,</i> 238 F.3d at 684); <i>Sherrod v. American Airlines, Inc.,</i> 132 F.3d 1112, 1122 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p>To establish the causation element, the plaintiff must present either \"direct evidence of retaliation,\" or \"circumstantial evidence creating a rebuttable presumption of retaliation.\" <i>Washburn,</i> 504 F.3d at 510 (quoting <i>Fabela v. Socorro Indep. Sch. Dist.,</i> 329 F.3d 409, 414-15 (5th Cir.2003)); <i>Fierros v. Texas Dep't of Health,</i> 274 F.3d 187, 192 (5th Cir.2001). When the plaintiff attempts to establish retaliatory intent using circumstantial evidence, the Fifth Circuit has held that the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting analysis applies. <i>See </i><i>Strong,</i> 482 F.3d at 805; <i>Turner,</i> 476 F.3d at 346; <i>Septimus,</i> 399 F.3d at 607-08. Under this framework, after the plaintiff establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case of retaliation, the burden shifts to the defendant to proffer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its actions. <i>See </i><i>Strong,</i> 482 F.3d at 805; <i>Baker,</i> 430 F.3d at 754-55; <i>Gee,</i> 289 F.3d at 345. If the employer meets its burden, the employee may nevertheless prevail by showing that the reasons given by the employer are a pretext for retaliation. <i>See </i><i>Strong,</i> 482 F.3d at 806; <i>Septimus,</i> 399 F.3d at 608; <i>Gee,</i> 289 F.3d at 345. Under a pretext theory, to carry his ultimate burden, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the adverse employment action would not have occurred \"but for\" the employee's participation in the protected activity. <i>See </i><i>Strong,</i> 482 F.3d at 806; <i>Septimus,</i> 399 F.3d at 608; <i>Mato,</i> 267 F.3d at 450.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the plaintiff submits direct evidence of discriminatory animus, then he is entitled to bypass the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework usually applied. <i>See </i><i>Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.

Texas Tech Univ.,</i> 80 F.3d 1042, 1048 (5th Cir.1996)). The statement should directly link the adverse employment action at issue with the alleged discriminatory motive. <i>See </i><i>Jones,</i> 212 Fed. Appx. at 273. The fact that the plaintiff was the only witness to the statement and there is no corroborating testimony does not preclude the evidence from being sufficient to defeat summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Gillaspy,</i> 278 Fed.Appx. at 311-12; <i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195. \"In deciding whether [Martin] established the element of causation under the direct evidence path, the district court must refrain from weighing the evidence and preemptively determining whether and which inferences a reasonable jury is likely to draw.\" <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 416. \"Instead, in deciding which evidentiary framework applies, the district court must ask whether the direct evidence truly standing alone, is sufficient to support the conclusion that a nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Barrett Computer Servs., Inc. v.

In the e-mail, as stated above, Wolfe explained one motivation for Martin's termination: \"He really pissed me off by accusing me of discriminating against him AFTER I saved his job!!!!!\" The evidence presented in the e-mail demonstrates that Wolfe's motivation for terminating Martin was at least in part retaliatory. Hence, Wolfe's statement precludes summary judgment because it presents a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether \"retaliatory animus in part motivated or was a substantial factor in the contested employment action.\" <i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195 (citing <i>Brown,</i> 989 F.2d at 861; <i>Vance v.

He told me thathe asked me did I go to another management [sic] in the company and say that he had discriminated against me; and I said \"Well I talked to Owen.\" And he [said] \"Rick [Martin] I just can't find it in my heart to forgive you foryou know, for what you done. Let me can't find it in my heart to forgive to forgive you for saying that I discriminated against you; and I'm going to have to terminate you.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Although Wolfe admits that the majority of his conversation with Martin involved the accusation of disparate treatment, he does not recall making the statement ascribed to him above. Despite Wolfe's denial of the statement and the fact that there were no witnesses to this conversation, \"for summary judgment purposes, the court must assume the truth of [Martin's] claim.\" <i>Gillaspy,</i> 278 Fed.Appx. at 311 (citing <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 150-51, 120 S.Ct. 2097); <i>see </i><i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195.</p>\n<p>The court finds that Martin's direct evidence standing alone is sufficient to create a casual nexus between Martin's complaint of discrimination and his termination. Therefore, because Martin has sufficiently alleged and supported the elements of his claim, he is allowed to bypass the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting framework. <i>See </i><i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 417. Rather, J.A.M. must establish that despite Wolfe's inclusion of the improper criterion among the reasons proffered for terminating Martin, J.A.M. would have reached the same employment decision had Martin never complained of disparate treatment. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Jones,</i> 212 Fed.Appx. at 273; <i>Jones,</i> 427 F.3d at 993; <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 415.</p>\n<p>Essentially, J.A.M. \"must prove that it would have terminated any employee who performed or behaved as [Martin] had,\" regardless of whether he had reported discrimination. <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 417. There appears to be ample evidence in the record supporting the notion that J.A.M. was motivated to terminate Martin because of his violation of the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. Additionally, J.A.M. has provided evidence that other non-African American employees have been disciplined under this policy.</p>\n<p>\"However, providing unrebutted evidence of a legitimate reason for the adverse employment decision is not sufficient to secure summary judgment under the direct evidence calculus.\" <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 418; <i>see </i><i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195. In other words, even if a defendant successfully presents evidence that the adverse action would have occurred even in the absence of a retaliatory purpose, this does not mean he will prevail on his summary judgment motion. <i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195. Therefore, the court finds that summary judgment on Martin's retaliation claim is inappropriate. The direct evidence presents a \"genuine issue of material fact regarding whether `[retaliatory] animus in part motivated or was a substantial factor in the contested employment action.'\" <i>See </i><i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195 (quoting <i>Brown,</i> 989 F.2d at 861); <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 418; <i>accord </i><i>Vance,</i> 209 F.3d at 442.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that Martin has presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his claims of racial discrimination and retaliation under Title VII, Section 1981, and the TCHRA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*847</span> Therefore, summary judgment is DENIED, and Martin may proceed to trial on these claims.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Wolfe asserts that he planned to fill out a suspension form closer to the time Bush would be suspended. A Notice of Disciplinary Suspension signed by Bush and Wolfe on July 12, 2007, indicates that Bush was suspended for two days  July 10 and July 11, 2007, for his involvement in the cross-contamination incident. The witness signature line is blank, suggesting there was not a witness present when Wolfe issued the notice. Martin avers that Wolfe allegedly suspended Bush only after Martin made a complaint to the Safety Department regarding the disciplinary action taken against him. He further asserts that Bush's suspension was merely an attempt to mask the discriminatory action taken by J.A.M. in its initial suspension of Martin.</p>\n<p>[2]  Wednesday, July 4, 2007, was a company holiday in observance of Independence Day. Neither party disputes that Martin was not required to work on the Fourth of July.</p>\n<p>[3]  Martin's cellular telephone records also indicate that, on July 6, 2007, he placed two calls to Wolfe's work cellular telephone. The first call, made at 2:40 p.m., lasted one minute, and the second call, made at 8:18 p.m., lasted one minute.</p>\n<p>[4]  On July 9, 2007, Martin also placed three outgoing calls from his cellular telephone to the J.A.M. Beaumont office. The first call, placed at 11:04 a.m., lasted three minutes, the second call, placed at 12:52 p.m., lasted five minutes, and the third call, placed at 4:37 p.m., lasted two minutes.</p>\n<p>[5]  Martin's Termination of Employment form indicates that his termination was effective July 10, 2007, and contains the signatures of Martin, Wolfe, and Alicia Weaver (\"Weaver\"), a purported witness. The form provides no explanation for Martin's termination. Wolfe concedes that Weaver was not a witness to Martin's termination. Rather, Weaver signed the document at a later time. In its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. also admits that only Martin and Wolfe were present during the meeting on July 10, 2007.</p>\n<p>[6]  On page 26 of Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Martin states that, \"it is undisputed that Defendant terminated Plaintiff; therefore, Defendant's action is an adverse employment action under Title VII and Defendant's challenge on this issue is disingenuous.\" Martin does not raise a disparate treatment claim regarding his suspension for violating J.A.M.'s Tank Farm Unloading Checklist Policy. Accordingly, the court will not address this issue.</p>\n<p>[7]  As evidence of his claim, Martin submits an Employee Warning Notice for an infraction Bush committed on October 17, 2007, involving the accuracy of payroll and Texas Department of Transportation driver logs. This report does not bolster Martin's claim because it demonstrates that Bush committed a violation of a policy different from the one breached by Martin. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 891 F.2d at 1180 (finding that employees who engage in different violations of company policy are not similarly situated); <i>Sagaral,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 799-800; <i>Tabatchnik,</i> 2006 WL 3499524, at *5 (stating that courts generally hold that employees who have violated different rules are not considered nearly identical); <i>see also </i><i>Okoye,</i> 245 F.3d at 514.</p>\n<p>[8]  \"The framework for analyzing a retaliation claim is the same as that used in the employment discrimination context.\" <i>Rios,</i> 252 F.3d at 380; <i>accord </i><i>Perez v. Region 20 Educ. Serv. Ctr.,</i> 307 F.3d 318, 325 (5th Cir.2002); <i>Medina v. Ramsey Steel Co.,</i> 238 F.3d 674, 684 (5th Cir.2001). Racial discrimination and retaliation claims based on § 1981 are also considered under the Title VII rubric of analysis. <i>See </i><i>Raggs v. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co.,</i> 278 F.3d 463, 469 (5th Cir.2002). \"[R]etaliation claims under § 1981 and Title VII ... are parallel causes of action. Each requires proof of the same elements in order to establish liability.\" <i>Foley,</i> 355 F.3d at 340 n. 8. Retaliation claims under the TCHRA are also guided by the same analysis that applies to claims of retaliation under Title VII. <i>See </i><i>Shackelford,</i> 190 F.3d at 404 n. 2 (\"[T]he law governing claims under the TCHRA and Title VII is identical\"). Therefore, determining whether Martin has raised material issues of fact with respect to his Title VII retaliation claim will generally resolve the same issues in the context of his TCHRA retaliation claim.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Fifth Circuit has held that \"`the mere fact that some adverse action is taken after an employee engages in some protected activity will not always be enough for a prima facie case. . . . Title VII's protection against retaliation does not permit EEO complainants to disregard work rules or job requirements.'\" <i>Raggs,</i> 278 F.3d at 472 (quoting <i>Swanson v. General Servs. Admin.,</i> 110 F.3d 1180, 1188 n. 3 (5th Cir.1997)). As shown below, however, in this case, the record contains direct evidence in the form of Wolfe's statement that he terminated Martin, in part, because he complained of racial discrimination. Therefore, the fact that Martin's alleged violation of company policy took place following his report of discriminatory conduct does not prevent him from establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case of retaliation.</p>\n\n</div>",

CRONE, District Judge.</p>\n<p>Pending before the court is Defendant J.A.M. Distributing Company's (\"J.A.M.\") Motion for Summary Judgment (#36). J.A.M. moves for summary judgment on an action brought by Plaintiff Richard C. Martin (\"Martin\") alleging racial discrimination in employment and retaliation arising under the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 (\"Section 1981\"), Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-2000h-6 (\"Title VII\"), and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act, TEX. LAB. CODE ANN. § 21.001-21.306 (\"TCHRA\"). Having reviewed the pending motion, the submissions of the parties, the pleadings, and the applicable law, the court is of the opinion that summary judgment is not warranted.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>On September 9, 2003, Jonas Wolfe (\"Wolfe\"), the Area Manager for J.A.M.'s Beaumont, Texas, region, hired Martin, an African-American male, to work as a bobtail driver in J.A.M.'s Beaumont terminal. J.A.M. buys, sells, and transports fuel, oils, and lubricants throughout the United States, maintaining facilities in Houston, Beaumont, Galveston, Dallas, and Lufkin, Texas. In June 2007, J.A.M. trained Martin to become a transport driver. The responsibilities of such a position include picking up trailers of petroleum products from J.A.M.'s customers and delivering them to its storage facilities for unloading into storage tanks.</p>\n<p>On Wednesday, June 27, 2007, James Bush (\"Bush\"), a Caucasian co-worker, dispatched Martin to pick up a trailer containing the lubricant DTE 26 from the ExxonMobil facility in Beaumont and to unload it into a tank of DTE 26 on J.A.M.'s premises for storage purposes. Upon his return, Martin and Bush completed a Tank Farm Unloading Checklist required by J.A.M. for the purpose of identifying the driver unloading the lubricant, in this case, Martin, and the supervising employee, referred to as the spotter, Bush, and to confirm that the unloading occurred at the proper location and in accordance with company guidelines. As the spotter, Bush was required to serve as a secondary check by verifying that the correct trailer was brought to the J.A.M. premises and that the correct product was unloaded into <span class=\"star-pagination\">*828</span> the storage tank by taking a sample of the lubricant. Although Bush signed the bottom of the checklist confirming that Martin had transported the correct trailer, approximately twenty-five to thirty minutes later, Martin discovered that he had picked up the wrong trailer and subsequently cross-contaminated two different products. Martin immediately notified Bush of the mistake. At that time, Bush called their supervisor, Wolfe, to inform him of the cross-contamination. Wolfe told Martin and Bush that he would meet with them the next day to discuss the incident.</p>\n<p>The following day, June 28, 2007, Wolfe met with Martin and Bush to talk about the cross-contamination. During the meeting, Wolfe suspended Martin without pay for two days  June 28 and June 29, 2007. Additionally, Wolfe filled out a Notice of Disciplinary Suspension for Martin, which Bush signed as a witness. According to Martin, Wolfe did not issue Bush any type of disciplinary action at the meeting.<sup>[1]</sup> Martin contends that, at the end of the meeting, he reminded Wolfe that he would be out on vacation for the week of July 4, 2007, and that Wolfe verbally approved his vacation at this time. Wolfe maintains that he told Martin he could not accommodate his request, indicating that he would approve Martin's vacation for only July 5 and July 6, 2007.</p>\n<p>On Friday, June 29, 2007, Martin called J.A.M.'s Safety Director Owen Olson (\"Olson\") to report what he perceived to be disparate treatment between himself and Bush. Martin expressed his dismay that Bush had not been suspended following the cross-contamination incident, when both he and Bush admitted they shared responsibility for the occurrence. Subsequently, Olson reported the complaint to Wolfe and Cindy Garbutt (\"Garbutt\"), J.A.M.'s Human Resource Manager.</p>\n<p>Martin failed to report to work for the week of July 2 through July 6, 2007. Martin alleges that he spent this week on vacation with his family and that he called his supervisor's office to check in on Monday, July 2, 2007, and Tuesday, July 3, 2007. Martin further maintains that on July 2, 2007, Wolfe instructed Bush to remove Martin from the work schedule for July 3, 2007, and not to place him back on the schedule until further notice. J.A.M. concedes that Wednesday, July 4, 2007, was a company holiday in observance of Independence Day, on which Martin was not scheduled to work, and that Martin was approved for vacation on July 5 and 6, 2007. Thus, for the week of July 2, 2007, J.A.M. asserts that Martin failed to call or report to work only on July 2 and 3, 2007.</p>\n<p>Martin also failed to report to work on Monday, July 9, 2007. In explaining his absence, Martin claims that on July 8, 2007, he called Wolfe's cellular telephone to notify him of the death of his childhood friend's grandmother, Madea. According to Martin, he received Wolfe's permission to miss work on the following day, July 9, 2007. To the contrary, Wolfe asserts that Martin never received permission to miss work on July 9, 2007.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*829</span> Following his return to work, on July 10, 2007, J.A.M. maintains that Wolfe terminated Martin for his failure to report to work on three consecutive work days  July 2, 3, and 9, 2007, in violation of J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. Specifically, the policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote>Regular attendance on the job is important to J.A.M. Distributing Company's operations. Frequent or unexplained absences from work, or tardiness in reporting for work, will seriously affect an employee's performance and evaluation. As a result, J.A.M. will discipline employees for tardiness and absenteeism up to and including termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><i>If an employee fails to report to work and does not notify his/her supervisor for three (3) consecutive days, the employee will be considered to have \"voluntarily resigned\" their duties and responsibilities as a J.A.M. employee.</i></blockquote>\n<p>(emphasis in original). Martin contends that despite his pleading with Wolfe to let him keep his job, Wolfe stated, \"I can't find it in my heart to forgive you . . . for saying that I discriminated against you; and I'm going to have to terminate you.\"</p>\n<p>In December 2007, Martin filed a charge of discrimination and retaliation with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission (\"EEOC\"). On May 14, 2008, the EEOC issued Martin a Notice of Right to Sue letter. Subsequently, on May 29, 2008, Martin initiated this action, alleging that he was terminated because of his race and in retaliation for reporting acts of discrimination to J.A.M.'s Safety Department in violation of Section 1981, Title VII, and the TCHRA. In its Second Amended Answer, filed August 20, 2008, J.A.M. denies that Martin's termination was the result of any discriminatory or retaliatory conduct. On April 3, 2009, J.A.M. filed the instant motion seeking summary judgment on the claims asserted by Martin, arguing that he cannot establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of employment discrimination or retaliation and is unable to show J.A.M.'s reason for terminating his employment was a pretext for racial discrimination or retaliation.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Summary Judgment Standard</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment \"shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED. R.CIV.P. 56(c). The party seeking summary judgment bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for its motion and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions on file, and affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <i>Celotex Corp. v.

On June 28, 2007, Wolfe suspended Martin for two days without pay, following his violation of the company's Tank Farm Unloading Checklist Policy. Martin's Notice of Disciplinary Suspension for this incident provided that the next step for a repeated infraction would be termination. In its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. asserts that Martin's unexcused absences for three consecutive work days violate the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. J.A.M. argues that, as a result of this violation, Wolfe terminated Martin on July 10, 2007. Martin, however, contends that his termination was racially motivated.</p>\n<p>Where there is no direct evidence of discrimination, the plaintiff must initially establish a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination by satisfying a multi-factor test from which a discriminatory motive may be inferred, thus creating a rebuttable presumption of intentional discrimination. <i>See </i><i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 142-43, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Martin asserts that during his meeting with Wolfe on Thursday, June 28, 2007, he reminded him that he would be out on vacation for the week of July 4, 2007. At deposition, Martin testified that the following conversation transpired:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: So, during the meeting, when you actually reminded Jonas [Wolfe] that you were supposed to be off July the 2nd through July the 6th, what did hehow did he respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: During the meeting when I was suspended I remember saying \"Well, he's going to\"I remember him telling me \"You're suspended for <span class=\"star-pagination\">*834</span> Thursday, [June 28, 2007] and you're suspended for Friday[, June 29, 2007].\" And I said \"Well, now, you know next week I'm on vacation.\" He goes \"Yeah. I know you're on vacation next week.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: When you said that you were on vacation \"next week,\" did you specifically tell Jonas which days you wanted or you were planning to be on vacation; or did you just say \"next week\"?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: \"I'm on vacation all next week.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Ok. And what  and did he approve that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: He knew it. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p>Conversely, Wolfe maintains that Martin did not have his permission to miss work on Monday, July 2, 2007, or Tuesday, July 3, 2007. Wolfe, however, admits that he permitted Martin to take vacation on Thursday, July 5, 2007, and Friday, July 6, 2007.<sup>[2]</sup> At deposition, Wolfe recalled a different version of the conversation:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: Did Mr. Martin remind you during this meeting that the following week he had a planned vacation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: He did not remind me. It was the very first time I had heard about the vacation plans.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: Okay. It was during this meeting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: It was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: What did Mr. Martin tell you about his vacation plans?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Both him and Jim [Bush] acknowledged that they had discussed and talked about him taking the following week off, in which I vividly remember actually leaning over my desk and telling Rick [Martin] that I needed him back at work Monday[, July 2, 2007,] and Tuesday[, July 3, 2007,] and that I would meet him in the middle and give him vacation for Thursday[, July 5, 2007,] and Friday[, July 6, 2007]. We had Wednesday[, July 4, 2007,] off as a holiday.</blockquote>\n<p>In any event, on July 2 and July 3, 2007, Martin did not report to work. In its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. contends that Martin failed to report to work on these days in direct violation of Wolfe's instructions. Martin responds that he spent July 2 through July 6, 2007, on an approved vacation with his family and on July 2, 2007, and July 3, 2007, he called his supervisor at the Beaumont terminal to check-in. Martin's cellular telephone records indicate that on July 2, 2007, he made three outgoing calls to J.A.M.'s Beaumont office  the first at 8:49 a.m., lasting one minute, the second at 8:50 a.m., lasting two minutes, and the third at 11:38 a.m., lasting three minutes. At deposition, Wolfe denied receiving any calls or voicemails from Martin on July 2, 2007. On July 3, 2007, Martin's cellular telephone records show that he placed a call, lasting eight minutes, to J.A.M.'s Beaumont office at 7:42 a.m.<sup>[3]</sup> Moreover, Bush revealed at deposition that, on July 2, 2007, Wolfe instructed him to take Martin off the schedule for July 3, 2007, and not to schedule him again until further notice. Martin, therefore, argues that he was not scheduled to work on July 3, 2007. Nevertheless, J.A.M. maintains that Martin did not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*835</span> have permission to miss work on July 2 and July 3, 2007.</p>\n<p>Martin further asserts that on Sunday, July 8, 2007, he again called Wolfe's cellular telephone to inform him of the death of his childhood friend's grandmother, Madea. Indeed, Martin's cellular telephone records demonstrate that on July 8, 2007, he placed a call lasting one minute to Wolfe's work cellular telephone at 8:26 p.m. Martin contends that during this call he received permission from Wolfe to miss work on the following day, July 9, 2007.<sup>[4]</sup> Wolfe denies giving Martin permission and asserts that he does not recollect receiving a call from Martin. At deposition, however, Wolfe recalled that upon arriving at work on the morning of July 9, 2007, his office informed him that Martin had called to say that his grandmother had passed away. Nonetheless, J.A.M. asserts that Martin's absence on July 9, 2007, was not excused.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, July 10, 2007, when Martin returned to work, Wolfe terminated him. In its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. asserts that Martin was terminated because he failed to report to work, as scheduled on three consecutive dates  July 2, 3, and 9, 2007, and did not call to notify Wolfe, in violation of J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy.<sup>[5]</sup> In its reply to Martin's response to its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. argues that \"the evidence is clear that Mr. Wolfe did not approve Martin's vacation for July 2, 2007, and July 3, 2007, and Mr. Martin failed to call in to get approval for an additional day off on July 9, 2007; this failure by Mr. Martin resulted in three consecutive work days of unexcused absences.\" The court, however, finds the record on the issue unclear.</p>\n<p>J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy explicitly provides that an employee is considered to have \"voluntarily resigned\" if he neither shows up for work nor notifies his supervisor for three consecutive days. Based on these circumstances, a reasonable trier of fact could find that Martin's actions did not violate the policy. While Martin does not dispute that he was absent from work on July 2, 3, and 9, 2007, a fact issue exists as to whether he had permission to miss work or notified his supervisor of his anticipated absence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>b. <i>Disparate Treatment</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Alternatively, Martin argues that even if he violated the Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy, he has adduced evidence demonstrating that Bush, a Caucasian co-worker, was not punished similarly. Martin contends that Bush was treated in a more lenient fashion after they both admitted to violating J.A.M.'s Tank Farm Unloading Checklist Policy. Martin asserts that, in the meeting on June 28, 2007, Wolfe issued Martin a Notice of Suspension and suspended him without pay for two days, while Wolfe did not discipline Bush, who was not allegedly suspended until after Martin complained of disparate treatment to Olson. Although Martin questions whether Bush was ever suspended, he argues <span class=\"star-pagination\">*836</span> that even if he was, the two employees were still treated differently when they both subsequently violated a company policy. Martin maintains that both his and Bush's Notice of Suspension indicate that a repeated infraction would result in termination. Martin asserts that, when he allegedly violated the Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy, he was terminated; but, when Bush allegedly violated a company safety policy, he merely received a warning.</p>\n<p>J.A.M. contends that Martin's argument fails because Martin and Bush were not involved in or accused of the same violation for which Martin was ultimately terminated. The court agrees. Fifth Circuit precedent establishes that employees who engage in different violations of company policy are not similarly situated. <i>See </i><i>Smith v.

Martin has alleged that the adverse employment action that he suffered was his termination on July 10, 2007,<sup>[6]</sup> and J.A.M. responded by asserting that Martin was terminated for violating the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. The conduct for which Martin was terminated was not nearly identical to the conduct for which Bush was later disciplined.<sup>[7]</sup> Accordingly, the court finds that Martin has failed to raise a fact issue as to whether he was treated differently than Bush. <i>See </i><i>Okoye,</i> 245 F.3d at 514 (citing <i>Little,</i> 924 F.2d at 97; <i>Smith,</i> 891 F.2d at 1180).</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Martin is unable to identify any employee who received more favorable treatment under the Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. At deposition, Martin was asked to identify any employee who, without permission, missed work in violation of company policy and was not disciplined. He responded, \"I don't know any of them.\" Therefore, the court finds that Martin's evidence does not support his contention that he was treated differently from another employee outside of his protected class. Accordingly, he fails to make a <i>prima facie</i> case on this basis.</p>\n<p>Although Martin has not established that an employee outside of his protected class received preferential treatment under nearly identical circumstances, the court nonetheless finds that he has established a <i>prima facie</i> case of discrimination <span class=\"star-pagination\">*837</span> based on his termination for a work-rule violation that he arguably did not violate. The court, therefore, continues its analysis under the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> framework.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Legitimate, Nondiscriminatory Reason</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because Martin has raised a genuine issue of fact with regard to his alleged work-rule violation and resulting discharge, J.A.M. must set forth an adequate, nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Once the plaintiff establishes a <i>prima facie</i> case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to articulatebut not provea legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its employment decision. <i>Raytheon Co. v.

J.A.M. presents unrebutted evidence of a company policy stating that an employee who fails to report to work and does not notify his supervisor for three consecutive days will be considered to have voluntarily resigned and that the employer will discipline an employee for tardiness and absenteeism up to and including termination. In his affidavit, dated April 3, 2009, Wolfe details the circumstances surrounding Martin's termination, stating, in pertinent part: \"During that meeting I terminated Mr. Martin because of his failure to report to work, as scheduled on three consecutive work daysJuly 2, 3, and 9, 2007, and failure to obtain permission from me for the unexcused absences in advance in violation of `J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy.'\" Hence, the court finds that J.A.M. has articulated a specific, nondiscriminatory reason for Martin's dischargeviolation of the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism Policywhich permits the conclusion that Martin's termination was not based on discriminatory animus, thus satisfying J.A.M.'s burden on production.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. <i>Pretext for Discrimination</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Having found both a prima facie case for discrimination and a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for Martin's termination, to prevail, Martin \"`must provide some evidence, direct or circumstantial, to rebut each of the employer's proffered reasons and allow the jury to infer that the employer's explanation was a pretext for discrimination.'\" <i>Rutherford v.

Rick Martin was terminated for not reporting to work as scheduled.</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, in an affidavit dated January 23, 2008, Wolfe states the following:</p>\n<blockquote>4. Mr. Martin failed to return to work on Monday, July 2, 2007, did not come into work on July 3, 4, or 5, and failed to contact me regarding this absence as required by J.A.M. policy. Under J.A.M. policy, failure to appear for work for three consecutive days without calling in results in termination. I did not retaliate against Mr. Martin for claiming he was discriminated against; I terminated him because he did not report to work as scheduled and did not contact me as required.</blockquote>\n<p>On January 24, 2008, J.A.M. submitted Wolfe's affidavit and its Position Statement in response to the claims made in Martin's EEOC Charge of Discrimination. J.A.M. maintains that Martin \"was terminated for failing to return to work as scheduled and failing to contact his supervisor regarding his absence as required.\"</p>\n<p>At deposition on March 10, 2009, Wolfe testified that Martin was a no call, no show for July 2, 3, and 7, 2007:</p>\n<blockquote>A: I asked Mr. Martin to come to work on Monday, July 2nd, and Tuesday, July 3rd. I granted him permission to take vacation the 5th and the 6th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: And by requiring him to come to work on July 2nd and 3rd, you denied his request for vacation, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Yes, for those two days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: And you granted him vacation for Thursday-Wednesday, which was a holiday, Thursday and Friday, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p>Following his deposition, in an affidavit dated April 3, 2009, Wolfe states that he granted Martin's vacation request for only July 5, 2007, and July 6, 2007. Wolfe further asserts that during their meeting <span class=\"star-pagination\">*841</span> on Tuesday, July 10, 2007, \"I terminated Mr. Martin because of his failure to report to work as scheduled on three consecutive work daysJuly 2, 3, and 9, 2007, and failure to obtain permission from me in advance in violation of J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy.\"</p>\n<p>The court notes that there is no evidence of formal documentation indicating that Martin violated J.A.M.'s Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy until Wolfe's statement on January 7, 2008, following Martin's filing of his charge of discrimination and retaliation with the EEOC. In fact, based on Wolfe's deposition testimony, it is questionable whether he ever told Martin that he was being terminated for violating the Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. Rather, Wolfe explained that the bulk of their conversation on July 10, 2007, surrounded Martin's report of discrimination:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: You speak [sic] to Mr. Martin when you arrived at the office on the 10th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: And what was the contents of that conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Well, unfortunately it probably mostly surrounded about-surrounded the claims of mistreatment. From a personal level I wanted to understand from him how he felt that I mistreated him when I felt completely opposite, and consequently it did end with his termination.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: What did you ask him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: \"Explain to me, Rick [Martin], how you feel like I mistreated you. I was told by Owen [Olsen] that you felt like you had been mistreated when in fact I went against the recommendation for termination and kept you on board as an employee. How was that unfair?\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And I actually even went on to let him knowhe had mentioned that he contacted an attorney, that he was that serious about that, and so still in a confused state, I wanted for my own gratification an understanding of how he felt I mistreated him.</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, at deposition, the following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote>Q: Why did you terminate Mr. Martin?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: Because he did not show up to work when he was scheduled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Q: What did you tell Mr. Martin was the reason for his termination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote>A: I don't recall telling him. And let me explain. After we talkedexcuse me, during our conversation, in which I explained the nature of my intent for suspension and went on to recap from my point of view what has happened with events leading up to that moment, with him looking for a job the day of the incident, him acknowledging to me that he would show up on Monday and Tuesday and didn't, was an indication that he was gone. I did not expect him to come back. He said at that moment, quote, Are you firing me? And I said, Yes. I did not have to offer that.</blockquote>\n<p>In sum, Martin urges that the evidence demonstrates pretext based on the shifting and inconsistent explanations provided by J.A.M. for his termination. J.A.M. counters that the minor discrepancies pointed out by Martin were merely clerical errors or innocent oversights. J.A.M. argues that its management has consistently testified that Martin was terminated for violating the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism policy.</p>\n<p>Pretext may be inferred where the defendant has provided inconsistent or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*842</span> conflicting explanations for its conduct at different times. <i>See </i><i>Nasti,</i> 492 F.3d at 594 (citing <i>Read v.

If testimony of an employer's statement is presented as evidence, however, it must be specific. <i>See </i><i>Washburn,</i> 504 F.3d at 510; <i>Jones,</i> 212 Fed.Appx. at 273 (citing <i>Wallace v. Texas Tech Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"9024\"><a href=\"/opinion/9024/wallace-v-texas-tech-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></a></span>, 1048 (5th Cir.1996)). The statement should directly link the adverse employment action at issue with the alleged discriminatory motive. <i>See </i><i>Jones,</i> 212 Fed. Appx. at 273. The fact that the plaintiff was the only witness to the statement and there is no corroborating testimony does not preclude the evidence from being sufficient to defeat summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Gillaspy,</i> 278 Fed.Appx. at 311-12; <i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195. \"In deciding whether [Martin] established the element of causation under the direct evidence path, the district court must refrain from weighing the evidence and preemptively determining whether and which inferences a reasonable jury is likely to draw.\" <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 416. \"Instead, in deciding which evidentiary framework applies, the district court must ask whether the direct evidence truly standing alone, is sufficient to support the conclusion that a nexus exists between the protected activity and the adverse employment action.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Barrett Computer Servs., Inc. v.

In the e-mail, as stated above, Wolfe explained one motivation for Martin's termination: \"He really pissed me off by accusing me of discriminating against him AFTER I saved his job!!!!!\" The evidence presented in the e-mail demonstrates that Wolfe's motivation for terminating Martin was at least in part retaliatory. Hence, Wolfe's statement precludes summary judgment because it presents a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether \"retaliatory animus in part motivated or was a substantial factor in the contested employment action.\" <i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195 (citing <i>Brown,</i> 989 F.2d at 861; <i>Vance v.

He told me thathe asked me did I go to another management [sic] in the company and say that he had discriminated against me; and I said \"Well I talked to Owen.\" And he [said] \"Rick [Martin] I just can't find it in my heart to forgive you foryou know, for what you done. Let me can't find it in my heart to forgive to forgive you for saying that I discriminated against you; and I'm going to have to terminate you.\"</blockquote>\n<p>Although Wolfe admits that the majority of his conversation with Martin involved the accusation of disparate treatment, he does not recall making the statement ascribed to him above. Despite Wolfe's denial of the statement and the fact that there were no witnesses to this conversation, \"for summary judgment purposes, the court must assume the truth of [Martin's] claim.\" <i>Gillaspy,</i> 278 Fed.Appx. at 311 (citing <i>Reeves,</i> 530 U.S. at 150-51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2097</span></a></span>); <i>see </i><i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195.</p>\n<p>The court finds that Martin's direct evidence standing alone is sufficient to create a casual nexus between Martin's complaint of discrimination and his termination. Therefore, because Martin has sufficiently alleged and supported the elements of his claim, he is allowed to bypass the <i>McDonnell Douglas</i> burden-shifting framework. <i>See </i><i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 417. Rather, J.A.M. must establish that despite Wolfe's inclusion of the improper criterion among the reasons proffered for terminating Martin, J.A.M. would have reached the same employment decision had Martin never complained of disparate treatment. <i>See id.; see also </i><i>Jones,</i> 212 Fed.Appx. at 273; <i>Jones,</i> 427 F.3d at 993; <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 415.</p>\n<p>Essentially, J.A.M. \"must prove that it would have terminated any employee who performed or behaved as [Martin] had,\" regardless of whether he had reported discrimination. <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 417. There appears to be ample evidence in the record supporting the notion that J.A.M. was motivated to terminate Martin because of his violation of the company's Tardiness and Absenteeism Policy. Additionally, J.A.M. has provided evidence that other non-African American employees have been disciplined under this policy.</p>\n<p>\"However, providing unrebutted evidence of a legitimate reason for the adverse employment decision is not sufficient to secure summary judgment under the direct evidence calculus.\" <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 418; <i>see </i><i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195. In other words, even if a defendant successfully presents evidence that the adverse action would have occurred even in the absence of a retaliatory purpose, this does not mean he will prevail on his summary judgment motion. <i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195. Therefore, the court finds that summary judgment on Martin's retaliation claim is inappropriate. The direct evidence presents a \"genuine issue of material fact regarding whether `[retaliatory] animus in part motivated or was a substantial factor in the contested employment action.'\" <i>See </i><i>Fierros,</i> 274 F.3d at 195 (quoting <i>Brown,</i> 989 F.2d at 861); <i>Fabela,</i> 329 F.3d at 418; <i>accord </i><i>Vance,</i> 209 F.3d at 442.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Based on the foregoing analysis, the Court finds that Martin has presented sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to his claims of racial discrimination and retaliation under Title VII, Section 1981, and the TCHRA. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*847</span> Therefore, summary judgment is DENIED, and Martin may proceed to trial on these claims.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Wolfe asserts that he planned to fill out a suspension form closer to the time Bush would be suspended. A Notice of Disciplinary Suspension signed by Bush and Wolfe on July 12, 2007, indicates that Bush was suspended for two days  July 10 and July 11, 2007, for his involvement in the cross-contamination incident. The witness signature line is blank, suggesting there was not a witness present when Wolfe issued the notice. Martin avers that Wolfe allegedly suspended Bush only after Martin made a complaint to the Safety Department regarding the disciplinary action taken against him. He further asserts that Bush's suspension was merely an attempt to mask the discriminatory action taken by J.A.M. in its initial suspension of Martin.</p>\n<p>[2]  Wednesday, July 4, 2007, was a company holiday in observance of Independence Day. Neither party disputes that Martin was not required to work on the Fourth of July.</p>\n<p>[3]  Martin's cellular telephone records also indicate that, on July 6, 2007, he placed two calls to Wolfe's work cellular telephone. The first call, made at 2:40 p.m., lasted one minute, and the second call, made at 8:18 p.m., lasted one minute.</p>\n<p>[4]  On July 9, 2007, Martin also placed three outgoing calls from his cellular telephone to the J.A.M. Beaumont office. The first call, placed at 11:04 a.m., lasted three minutes, the second call, placed at 12:52 p.m., lasted five minutes, and the third call, placed at 4:37 p.m., lasted two minutes.</p>\n<p>[5]  Martin's Termination of Employment form indicates that his termination was effective July 10, 2007, and contains the signatures of Martin, Wolfe, and Alicia Weaver (\"Weaver\"), a purported witness. The form provides no explanation for Martin's termination. Wolfe concedes that Weaver was not a witness to Martin's termination. Rather, Weaver signed the document at a later time. In its motion for summary judgment, J.A.M. also admits that only Martin and Wolfe were present during the meeting on July 10, 2007.</p>\n<p>[6]  On page 26 of Plaintiff's Response to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment, Martin states that, \"it is undisputed that Defendant terminated Plaintiff; therefore, Defendant's action is an adverse employment action under Title VII and Defendant's challenge on this issue is disingenuous.\" Martin does not raise a disparate treatment claim regarding his suspension for violating J.A.M.'s Tank Farm Unloading Checklist Policy. Accordingly, the court will not address this issue.</p>\n<p>[7]  As evidence of his claim, Martin submits an Employee Warning Notice for an infraction Bush committed on October 17, 2007, involving the accuracy of payroll and Texas Department of Transportation driver logs. This report does not bolster Martin's claim because it demonstrates that Bush committed a violation of a policy different from the one breached by Martin. <i>See </i><i>Smith,</i> 891 F.2d at 1180 (finding that employees who engage in different violations of company policy are not similarly situated); <i>Sagaral,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 799-800; <i>Tabatchnik,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3499524</span></span>, at *5 (stating that courts generally hold that employees who have violated different rules are not considered nearly identical); <i>see also </i><i>Okoye,</i> 245 F.3d at 514.</p>\n<p>[8]  \"The framework for analyzing a retaliation claim is the same as that used in the employment discrimination context.\" <i>Rios,</i> 252 F.3d at 380; <i>accord </i><i>Perez v. Region 20 Educ. Serv. Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779449\"><a href=\"/opinion/779449/daniel-m-perez-v-region-20-education-service-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span>, 325 (5th Cir.2002); <i>Medina v. Ramsey Steel Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"23003\"><a href=\"/opinion/23003/medina-v-ramsey-steel-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span>, 684 (5th Cir.2001). Racial discrimination and retaliation claims based on § 1981 are also considered under the Title VII rubric of analysis. <i>See </i><i>Raggs v. Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776314\"><a href=\"/opinion/776314/herman-raggs-v-mississippi-power-light-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">463</span></a></span>, 469 (5th Cir.2002). \"[R]etaliation claims under § 1981 and Title VII ... are parallel causes of action. Each requires proof of the same elements in order to establish liability.\" <i>Foley,</i> 355 F.3d at 340 n. 8. Retaliation claims under the TCHRA are also guided by the same analysis that applies to claims of retaliation under Title VII. <i>See </i><i>Shackelford,</i> 190 F.3d at 404 n. 2 (\"[T]he law governing claims under the TCHRA and Title VII is identical\"). Therefore, determining whether Martin has raised material issues of fact with respect to his Title VII retaliation claim will generally resolve the same issues in the context of his TCHRA retaliation claim.</p>\n<p>[9]  The Fifth Circuit has held that \"`the mere fact that some adverse action is taken after an employee engages in some protected activity will not always be enough for a prima facie case. . . . Title VII's protection against retaliation does not permit EEO complainants to disregard work rules or job requirements.'\" <i>Raggs,</i> 278 F.3d at 472 (quoting <i>Swanson v. General Servs. Admin.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739317\"><a href=\"/opinion/739317/75-fair-emplpraccas-bna-483-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44797-tommy-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span>, 1188 n. 3 (5th Cir.1997)). As shown below, however, in this case, the record contains direct evidence in the form of Wolfe's statement that he terminated Martin, in part, because he complained of racial discrimination. Therefore, the fact that Martin's alleged violation of company policy took place following his report of discriminatory conduct does not prevent him from establishing a <i>prima facie</i> case of retaliation.</p>\n\n</div>",
