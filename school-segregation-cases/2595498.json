Sciarra, on the\n         brief).\n\n         Lauren A. Jensen, Deputy Attorney General,\n         argued the cause for respondents (John J.\n         Hoffman, Acting Attorney General, attorney;\n         Michelle Lyn Miller, Assistant Attorney\n         General, of counsel; Ms. Jensen, on the\n         brief).\n\f         Benjamin Yaster argued the cause for amicus\n         curiae Save Our Schools New Jersey (Gibbons\n         P.C., attorneys; Mr. Yaster and Lawrence S.\n         Lustberg, on the brief).\n\n    The opinion of the court was delivered by\n\nASHRAFI, J.A.D.\n\n    In this appeal, we consider whether the New Jersey State\n\nBoard of Education could lawfully adopt regulations to permit\n\nexisting, successful charter schools to open satellite locations\n\nwithin their districts of residence.   We conclude the\n\nregulations are a valid exercise of the State Board's\n\nadministrative authority.\n\n    The Education Law Center (ELC) challenges the State Board's\n\nadoption of two amended regulations and the repeal of a third\n\napplicable under the Charter School Program Act of 1995 (the\n\nAct), N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-1 to -18.   Save Our Schools New Jersey,\n\nwhich describes itself as a volunteer-led organization of\n\nparents and concerned residents of New Jersey, supports ELC's\n\nappeal as an amicus curiae.\n\n    ELC and Save Our Schools contend that the State Board\n\nexceeded its statutory authority and acted arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously when it: (1) amended N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a)(1)(iv)\n\nto authorize the addition of satellite campuses to some existing\n\ncharter schools; (2) amended N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.2 to define the\n\n\n\n\n                               2                            A-2816-12T3\n\fterm \"satellite campus\"; and (3) repealed N.J.A.C. 6A:11-\n\n2.6(a)(2), which had barred existing charter schools from\n\namending their charters to alter the mission, goals, or\n\nobjectives of the school.   ELC and Save Our Schools contend that\n\nthe revised regulations are an expansion of the charter school\n\nprogram and that such an expansion may be accomplished only by\n\nthe Legislature enacting new laws, not by the State Board and\n\nthe Commissioner of Education through administrative action.\n\nSave Our Schools adds that the regulatory amendments risk\n\ncreating charter schools that will fail, and the failures will\n\nhave a disproportionate impact on impoverished school children\n\nin under-performing school districts.\n\n    We conclude that the State Board had the statutory\n\nauthority to amend and repeal its regulations as it did, and\n\nthat the speculative policy arguments advanced by Save Our\n\nSchools may be better addressed to the Legislature or to\n\nindividual charter school expansions than as a facial attack on\n\nthe amended regulations.    We affirm the State Board's action in\n\nadopting and repealing the challenged regulations.\n\n                                 I.\n\n    \"A charter school [is] a public school operated under a\n\ncharter granted by the [C]ommissioner [of Education], which is\n\noperated independently of a local board of education and is\n\n\n\n\n                                 3                          A-2816-12T3\n\fmanaged by a board of trustees.\"     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-3(a).\n\nCharter schools are funded primarily by taxes collected from the\n\npublic that would otherwise fund traditional public education.\n\nSee N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-12.   A charter school may not enroll\n\nstudents on the basis of selective criteria such as\n\n\"intellectual or athletic ability,\" and it may not discriminate\n\non the basis of \"measures of achievement or aptitude, status as\n\na handicapped person, proficiency in the English language, or\n\nany other basis that would be illegal if used by a [public]\n\nschool district.\"    N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-7.     A charter school may,\n\nhowever, \"limit admission . . . to areas of concentration of the\n\nschool, such as mathematics, science, or the arts,\" and it may\n\n\"establish reasonable criteria to evaluate prospective\n\nstudents.\"   Ibid.\n\n    The legislative purpose of authorizing charter schools is\n\nto promote educational reform \"by providing a mechanism for the\n\nimplementation of a variety of educational approaches which may\n\nnot be available in the traditional public school classroom.\"\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:36A-2.   The Legislature found that \"the\n\nestablishment of a charter school program is in the best\n\ninterests of the students of this State and it is therefore the\n\npublic policy of the State to encourage and facilitate the\n\ndevelopment of charter schools.\"     Ibid.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4                            A-2816-12T3\n\f      The Legislature granted to the State Board the authority to\n\nadopt such rules and regulations as are \"necessary to effectuate\n\nthe provisions of\" the enabling legislation.    N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-\n\n18.   The first series of regulations under the Act were adopted\n\nby the State Board in July 1997.    29 N.J.R. 3492(a) (Aug. 4,\n\n1997); N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.1 to -6.4.\n\n      Together with the statutory criteria, see N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-\n\n4, -4.1, -5, the regulations subject a proposed charter school\n\nto a rigorous application process.     See N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1.\n\nAmong the many requirements, the application must state the\n\nschool's educational goals and objectives, the admission\n\ncriteria for students, the assessment methods that will\n\ndetermine whether students are achieving the stated goals of the\n\nschool, and the address and description of the physical building\n\nin which the school will be located.    Ibid.   The application\n\nprocess also includes an in-depth interview of representatives\n\nof the school with the Commissioner of Education and a\n\npreparedness visit with personnel from the Department of\n\nEducation.   Ibid.\n\n      Once a charter school has been established, the\n\nCommissioner must assess annually whether the school is meeting\n\nthe goals stated in its charter.     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16(a).     If\n\nthe school violates any provision of its charter, the\n\n\n\n\n                                5                              A-2816-12T3\n\fCommissioner may revoke the charter, place the school on\n\nprobationary status, require the school to take corrective\n\naction, or reject renewal of the charter for a subsequent term.\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:36A-17.\n\n       Since adoption of the original implementing regulations in\n\n1997, charter schools have been permitted to \"apply to the\n\nCommissioner for an amendment to the charter . . . .\"     N.J.A.C.\n\n6A:11-2.6; 29 N.J.R. 3492(a).     However, the original regulations\n\nprohibited an amendment that would alter the mission, goals or\n\nobjectives of the existing charter school, N.J.A.C. 6A:11-\n\n2.6(a)(2) (repealed), and they made no reference to satellite\n\ncampuses.    29 N.J.R. 3492(a).\n\n       The Department of Education proposed the challenged\n\nregulatory changes in May 2012 by means of the formal process\n\nfor amending the charter school regulations.     See N.J.A.C. 6A:6-\n\n3.1.   ELC submitted written comments to the State Board opposing\n\n\"strongly\" the proposed new regulations on the ground that they\n\npermitted expansion of the State's charter school program\n\nthrough regulation rather than legislative action.    The State\n\nBoard reviewed comments from ELC and others and made some\n\nchanges to the proposed amendments, but it did not rescind or\n\nmodify the proposed regulatory changes that are the subject of\n\nthis appeal.    After the State Board published notice of the\n\n\n\n\n                                  6                          A-2816-12T3\n\fproposed amendments in the New Jersey Register, 44 N.J.R.\n\n2151(a) (Sept. 4, 2012), a sixty-day public comment period\n\nopened, and the State Board took public testimony on the\n\nproposed changes.   Over ELC's continuing objections, the State\n\nBoard amended N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a) on December 5, 2012, to\n\nauthorize satellite campuses in some school districts.     45\n\nN.J.R. 26(a) (Jan. 7, 2013).\n\n    As amended, N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a) now states:\n\n         A charter school may apply to the\n         Commissioner for an amendment to the charter\n         following the final granting of the charter.\n         1. Examples of what a charter school may\n         seek an amendment include, but are not\n         limited to, the following:\n\n         i.   Expanding enrollment;\n         ii. Expanding grade levels;\n         iii. Changing or adding a district or region\n         of residence; or\n         iv. Opening a new satellite campus.\n\n    The Board also defined the term \"satellite campus,\"\n\nlimiting its application to certain school districts in\n\nunderprivileged areas:\n\n         \"Satellite campus\" means a school facility,\n         located within a district with a priority\n         school[1] or a former Abbott District as of\n\n\n1\n  \"Priority school\" is defined as \"a school that demonstrates\nvery low levels of success in either school wide student\nproficiency rates or overall graduation rates as determined by\ncriteria at N.J.A.C. 6A:33-2.1(b).\" N.J.A.C. 6A:33-1.3.\n\n\n\n\n                                7                           A-2816-12T3\n\f         July 1, 2012,[2] operated by a charter school\n         under the school's charter that is in\n         addition to the facility identified in the\n         charter school application or charter, if\n         subsequently amended.\n\n         [N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.2.]\n\n    Lastly, the Board repealed N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a)(2), which\n\npreviously stated that an \"amendment shall not change the\n\nmission, goals and objectives of a charter school.\"\n\n                                II.\n\n    ELC asserts that the State Board exceeded its statutory\n\nauthority in adopting the satellite campus regulations, and\n\nacted arbitrarily and capriciously in repealing N.J.A.C. 6A:11-\n\n2.6(a)(2).   Save Our Schools adds that the \"regulations, as\n\nwritten . . . in effect, allow[] new charter schools to be\n\ncreated under the guise of 'satellite campuses' without being\n\nsubjected to the rigorous application and review process that\n\nthe Legislature envisioned.\"   See In re Proposed Quest Acad.\n\nCharter Sch. of Montclair Founders Grp., 216 N.J. 370, 374-77\n\n(2013); N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1.    The Board responds that \"satellite\n\n2\n  \"[F]ormer Abbott District\" refers to the thirty-one New Jersey\npublic school districts that were designated as \"special needs\"\nor \"Abbott districts,\" Abbott v. Burke, 196 N.J. 544, 548, 563\n(2008), for purposes of receiving State funding and implementing\nprograms to improve the educational services provided in those\ndistricts. The Legislature's adoption of the School Funding\nReform Act of 2008, N.J.S.A. 18A:7F-43 to -63, supplanted the\ndesignation of \"Abbott districts.\" See Abbott v. Burke, 206\nN.J. 332 (2011).\n\n\n\n                                 8                          A-2816-12T3\n\fcampuses are directly in line with the express legislative\n\npolices underlying the [Act].\"\n\n    In an appeal such as this, we are not \"bound by [a\n\ngovernment] agency's interpretation of a statute or its\n\ndetermination of a strictly legal issue.\"      Russo v. Bd. of Trs.,\n\n206 N.J. 14, 27 (2011) (quoting Mayflower Sec. Co. v. Bureau of\n\nSec. 64 N.J. 85, 93 (1973)).     \"[W]e apply de novo review to an\n\nagency's interpretation of a statute or case law.\"      Ibid.     Our\n\n\"obligation is to determine and give effect to the Legislature's\n\nintent\" in enacting the statute.      N.J. Ass'n of Sch. Adm'rs v.\n\nSchundler, 211 N.J. 535, 549 (2012); see also Wilson ex rel.\n\nManzano v. City of Jersey City, 209 N.J. 558, 572 (2012) (the\n\ncourt's \"paramount goal in interpreting a statute is to give\n\neffect to the Legislature's intent.\").\n\n    At the same time, we must accord deference to\n\nadministrative agency actions, including the agency's adoption\n\nof regulations and rules to implement legislative directives.\n\n\"That approach reflects the specialized expertise agencies\n\npossess to enact technical regulations and evaluate issues that\n\nrulemaking invites.\"   Schundler, supra, 211 N.J. at 549.       An\n\nagency's regulations carry a presumption of validity, and the\n\nburden is on the challenging party to rebut that presumption.\n\nId. at 548.\n\n\n\n\n                                  9                             A-2816-12T3\n\f       A properly adopted regulation may only be set aside \"if it\n\nis proved to be arbitrary or capricious or if it plainly\n\ntransgresses the statute it purports to effectuate . . . or if\n\nit alters the terms of the statute or frustrates the policy\n\nembodied in it.\"    In re Repeal of N.J.A.C. 6:28, 204 N.J.

Long, 75 N.J. 544, 561\n\n(1978)).    A regulation frustrates a statute when it is\n\ninconsistent with the statute, extends the statute beyond the\n\nLegislature's intent, or \"violates . . . express or implied\n\nlegislative policies.\"     See In re Petitions for Rulemaking,\n\nN.J.A.C. 10:82-1.2 & 10:82-4.1, 117 N.J. 311, 325 (1989); accord\n\nN.J.

Super. 588, 596\n\n(App. Div. 2012), certif. denied, 213 N.J. 536 (2013).\n\n       The Legislature's grant of administrative authority is\n\nconstrued liberally \"to enable the agency to accomplish its\n\nstatutory responsibilities and . . . effectuate fully the\n\nlegislative intent.\"     Hearing Aid Dispensers, supra, 75 N.J. at\n\n562.   In assessing the scope of delegated authority, courts\n\n\"look beyond the specific terms of the enabling act to the\n\nstatutory policy sought to be achieved by examining the entire\n\nstatute in light of its surroundings and objectives.\"      Ibid.\n\n\n\n\n                                  10                         A-2816-12T3\n\f\"[T]he absence of an express statutory authorization in the\n\nenabling legislation will not preclude administrative agency\n\naction where, by reasonable implication, that action can be said\n\nto promote or advance the policies and findings that served as\n\nthe driving force for the enactment of the legislation.\"       N.J.\n\nState League of Municipalities v. Dep't of Cmty. Affairs, 158\n\nN.J. 211, 223 (1999) (quoting A.A. Mastrangelo, Inc., v. Comm'r,\n\nDep't of Envtl. Prot., 90 N.J. 666, 683-84 (1982)).\n\n    In conjunction with these principles of administrative law,\n\nthe usual rules of statutory interpretation require courts first\n\nto examine the plain language of a statute.    Headen v. Jersey\n\nCity Bd. of Educ., 212 N.J. 437, 448 (2012).    If the plain\n\nlanguage is clear, that meaning must be given effect, and the\n\ncourt's inquiry is complete.    O'Connell v. State, 171 N.J. 484,\n\n488 (2002).\n\n    In this case, the plain language of the pertinent statutes\n\ndoes not resolve the dispute.   The Legislature granted to the\n\nState Board the authority to promulgate regulations and\n\namendments to the charter school program.     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-18.\n\nThe Legislature did not expressly authorize satellite campuses,\n\nbut it also did not expressly prohibit them.\n\n    The State Board emphasizes the Legislature's overarching\n\npurpose to encourage and facilitate the development of charter\n\n\n\n\n                                 11                         A-2816-12T3\n\fschools.   The Act expressly set forth its purposes in N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-2, the Legislature finding and declaring that:\n\n           [T]he establishment of charter schools as\n           part of this State's program of public\n           education can assist in promoting\n           comprehensive educational reform by\n           providing a mechanism for the implementation\n           of a variety of educational approaches which\n           may not be available in the traditional\n           public school classroom. Specifically,\n           charter schools offer the potential to\n           improve pupil learning; increase for\n           students and parents the educational choices\n           available when selecting the learning\n           environment which they feel may be the most\n           appropriate; encourage the use of different\n           and innovative learning methods; establish a\n           new form of accountability for schools;\n           require the measurement of learning\n           outcomes; make the school the unit for\n           educational improvement; and establish new\n           professional opportunities for teachers.\n\n    ELC acknowledges these purposes of the Act but argues that\n\nother statutory provisions demonstrate the Legislature's intent\n\nnot to permit expansion of the charter school program without\n\nits own express approval.     ELC points to the specificity of the\n\nprocedures laid out for establishing a charter school, N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-4, and the detailed, wide-ranging information that must\n\nbe included in an application for a charter, N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-5.\n\nIt also cites a subsection of the Act expressly prohibiting\n\nexpansion or modification of the charter school program without\n\nprior legislative approval.     N.J.S.A. 18A:36-16(e).\n\n\n\n\n                                  12                        A-2816-12T3\n\f    If this last-cited statutory provision expressly prohibits\n\nany action by the State Board that has the effect of expanding\n\nthe charter school program, our inquiry is at an end — satellite\n\ncampuses are not permitted.   But we do not read N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-16(e) as ELC urges.   ELC cites the concluding sentence\n\nof that subsection, which states: \"The commissioner may not\n\nimplement any recommended expansion, modification, or\n\ntermination of the program until the Legislature acts on that\n\nrecommendation.\"   But as the State Board argues, the quoted\n\nsentence should not be read in isolation from the rest of\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16 and the entire Act.\n\n    Subsection (a) of N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16 requires that the\n\nCommissioner annually assess and conduct a comprehensive review\n\nof each charter school.   Subsection (b) requires each charter\n\nschool to submit an annual report to the Commissioner and others\n\nto facilitate the Commissioner's assessment and review.     With\n\nrespect to the specific issue raised in this appeal, in\n\nsubsections (c) through (e), the Legislature directed a review\n\nof the entire, State-wide charter school program.   Those\n\nsubsections directed the Commissioner to hold public hearings by\n\nApril 1, 2001, as a part of a comprehensive review of the\n\nState's entire charter school program; to \"commission an\n\nindependent study of the charter school program\"; and to issue\n\n\n\n\n                                13                          A-2816-12T3\n\fto the Governor, the Legislature, and the State Board by October\n\n1, 2001, \"an evaluation of the charter school program.\"\n\n    The requirement for a State-wide review, six years after\n\nthe Legislature authorized charter schools in 1995, was enacted\n\nas an amendment to the Act in 2000.    L. 2000, c. 142, § 3\n\n(effective Nov. 2, 2000).   The Legislature set deadlines in 2001\n\nfor the Commissioner's evaluation and report, which was to\n\ncontain specific, listed items of information based on public\n\nhearings and the Commissioner's independent study of the State-\n\nwide program.   N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16(e).    The prohibition\n\nspecified in the last sentence of subsection (e) refers to that\n\nsix-year report and its recommendations.    It does not refer\n\ngenerally to any modification of the charter school program that\n\nmay otherwise be authorized by the Act.\n\n    A broad reading of N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16(e) as ELC urges\n\nwould contravene the legislative purpose of encouraging\n\ninnovative educational methodology through the charter school\n\nprogram.   See In re Grant of Charter to Merit Preparatory\n\nCharter Sch. of Newark, 435 N.J. Super. 273, 281 (App. Div.),\n\ncertif. denied, ___ N.J. ___ (2014).   We do not read the Act as\n\nrequiring legislative action for every type of amendment to\n\nexisting school charters that might have the effect of expanding\n\nthe school's educational program.\n\n\n\n\n                                14                            A-2816-12T3\n\f    Making a more concrete argument, ELC contends that the Act\n\ndid not authorize expansion of an existing charter school beyond\n\nits initially-approved physical building.     ELC contends the term\n\n\"charter school\" means \"one building\" because the historic\n\nmeaning of \"school\" is a single building.     We are not persuaded.\n\nThe Act authorizes charter schools to acquire by purchase,\n\nlease, or gift real property for use as a school facility,\n\neither from public or from private sources.     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-\n\n6(c).   The Act does not limit charter schools to acquiring only\n\none building.\n\n    Furthermore, nothing in the Act or the prior regulations\n\nprohibits an existing charter school from expanding its\n\noperations with the acquisition or use of additional buildings\n\nrather than expanding only within its original building.     In the\n\ncase of an existing charter school that seeks to expand into\n\nadditional physical space, it makes little sense to require a\n\nwhole new application and the resulting review process.    While a\n\nsatellite campus is not the same as expanding into additional\n\nphysical space immediately adjacent to the existing facility,\n\nthe satellite campus would still be part of the same school.      A\n\nschool is more than a building.    It is an educational program,\n\nand the teaching, administrative, and operational staff that\n\ndevises and runs the program.   Site unity is an appropriate\n\n\n\n\n                                  15                        A-2816-12T3\n\fconsideration in evaluating the potential success or problems of\n\na proposed charter school, but a remote site does not make a\n\nwholly different school.\n\n    More to the point, \"[i]n determining whether a particular\n\nadministrative act enjoys statutory authorization, the reviewing\n\ncourt may look beyond the specific terms of the enabling act to\n\nthe statutory policy sought to be achieved.\"    Hearing Aid\n\nDispensers, supra, 75 N.J. at 562.   Here, the Legislature\n\nintended that the Act provide options and opportunities of\n\npublic education for parents and children.     See Merit\n\nPreparatory Charter Sch., supra, 435 N.J. Super. at 281.\n\nPermitting the addition of a new building for purposes of\n\nexpanding a successful charter school is consistent with these\n\nlegislative purposes of the Act.\n\n    Neither the Act nor the prior regulations prohibited a\n\ncharter school from expanding its services by means of an\n\namendment to its charter.   We are persuaded by the State Board's\n\nargument that: \"Under the charter amendment regulations, charter\n\nschools have long been permitted to apply for amendments to\n\nincrease enrollment, add additional grade levels, and add or\n\nchange a district of residence,\" and \"permitting certain\n\n[existing, successful] charter schools to establish a satellite\n\ncampus is . . . a natural extension of the schools' ability to\n\n\n\n\n                                16                            A-2816-12T3\n\fexpand enrollment and grade levels.\"    Thus, according to the\n\nState Board, \"the establishment of a satellite campus is simply\n\nanother means through which a high performing charter school may\n\nseek to expand.\"\n\n    ELC and Save Our Schools express strong misgivings about\n\npermitting expansion to new locations by means of amendment of a\n\nschool's charter rather than by the school submitting an initial\n\napplication pursuant to the Act for the satellite location.\n\nThey claim the amendment procedure shortcuts the Legislature's\n\nintent that charter schools undergo a rigorous and searching\n\napplication process.   See J.D. ex rel. Scipio-Derrick v. Davy,\n\n415 N.J. Super. 375, 380-81 (App. Div. 2010).    They contend that\n\na correct reading of the Act requires that the State Board and\n\nthe Department of Education conduct a full initial review before\n\na satellite location can be approved.\n\n    The State Board responds that a repetition of the full\n\napplication process is not needed because an existing charter\n\nschool has already undergone that review and, what is more, a\n\nsatellite campus would be authorized only for an existing\n\ncharter school that has proven it can operate successfully.      The\n\nState Board argues that beginning a new application process\n\nwould unnecessarily hamper expansion of successful charter\n\nschools that seek to serve more pupils.\n\n\n\n\n                                17                          A-2816-12T3\n\f     We agree that the addition of a satellite campus is more\n\nlike the expansion of grade and enrollment levels than the\n\nopening of an entirely new charter school.   Contrary to ELC's\n\nargument, the amended regulations do not allow a satellite\n\ncampus in a district other than in the district or region\n\nalready served by an existing charter school.   The State Board\n\nacknowledged in its brief and in oral argument before us that\n\nthe definition of \"satellite campus\" in N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1\n\nrefers to a separate location but in the same school district as\n\nthe existing charter school, or within the contiguous school\n\ndistricts that are the regional district of residence of a\n\ncharter school.3   ELC expresses unfounded fear that the\n\nCommissioner will approve \"far flung\" satellite campuses without\n\nadequate evaluation of the proposed building, the demographics\n\nof the area, the school program, and the school staff.\n\n     Save Our Schools is concerned that the Commissioner and the\n\nDepartment of Education will not adequately evaluate satellite\n\ncampuses for the physical safety and suitability of the site for\n\neducational use.   This argument is speculative and not borne out\n\n3\n  A charter school is located in a \"district of residence,\" which\nis defined as \"the school district in which a charter school\nfacility is physically located; if a charter school is approved\nwith a region of residence comprised of contiguous school\ndistricts, that region is the charter school's district of\nresidence.\" N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.2.\n\n\n\n\n                                18                          A-2816-12T3\n\fby any facts.   In proposing the amended regulations, the\n\nDepartment of Education commented: \"Facilities identified by an\n\namendment request for a satellite campus are subject to the same\n\nreview and approval procedures for new charter school facilities\n\n. . . .\"    45 N.J.R. 26(a).   We must assume the Commissioner will\n\nrequire an adequate evaluation of a proposed satellite campus\n\nsite and reject any charter amendment that fails to meet\n\nappropriate standards for a school building.     If a proposed\n\ncampus presents safety concerns or is otherwise unsuitable for\n\nthe educational needs of children, Save Our Schools or other\n\ninterested parties should raise specific objections to the\n\nproposed amended charter.\n\n    Similarly, Save Our Schools argues that the charter\n\namendment procedures circumvent the constitutional requirement\n\nthat the Commissioner take into account the potential effect of\n\na charter school on this State's anti-discrimination laws and\n\npolicies.    It posits that, because the regulations only allow\n\nsatellite campuses to open \"within a district with a priority\n\nschool or former Abbott District,\" N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.2, \"the\n\nincreased risk of charter school failure at satellite campuses\n\nwill be borne disproportionately by impoverished communities and\n\ncommunities of color.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  19                        A-2816-12T3\n\f    As our Supreme Court recently explained, constitutional and\n\nstatutory law imposes requirements with which the Commissioner\n\nmust comply when evaluating an application for a charter school:\n\n         First, the Commissioner must assess the\n         racial impact that a charter school\n         applicant will have on the district of\n         residence in which the charter school will\n         operate and must use the full panoply of\n         [his or her] powers to avoid segregation\n         resulting from the grant of a charter school\n         application. Second, if the local school\n         district demonstrates with some specificity\n         that the constitutional requirements of a\n         thorough and efficient education would be\n         jeopardized by [the district's] loss of the\n         funds to be allocated to a charter school,\n         the Commissioner is obligated to evaluate\n         carefully the impact that loss of funds\n         would have on the ability of the district of\n         residence to deliver a thorough and\n         efficient education.\n\n         [Quest Academy Charter Sch., supra, 216 N.J.\n         at 377-78 (quotation marks and citations\n         omitted).]\n\n    In Quest Academy, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the\n\nCommissioner had promised to be \"exceedingly careful in the\n\napproval of charter schools because of the impact that a wrong\n\ndecision will have on students who attend a charter school that\n\nfalters, or worse, fails to provide an educational program that\n\nsatisfies the constitutional standard of a thorough and\n\nefficient education.\"   Id. at 388.   Charter amendments are not\n\napproved without careful review by the Department of Education\n\nand the Commissioner, and the public's opportunity to\n\n\n\n                                20                         A-2816-12T3\n\fparticipate through their representatives on the local board of\n\neducation.   See N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(c).   The Legislature granted\n\nto the Commissioner discretion initially to approve or reject a\n\ncharter and further discretion to approve or reject amendments\n\nto a charter.   We have no basis on this record to speculate that\n\nthe Commissioner will not apply statutory and constitutional\n\nrequirements when reviewing a proposed amendment to add a\n\nsatellite campus to an existing charter school.\n\n    ELC and Save Our Schools argue, nevertheless, that the\n\namended regulations do not require notice of a proposed charter\n\namendment to be disseminated to all the same persons and\n\nentities as the notices that must be served for an initial\n\napplication for a charter.   For purposes of an initial\n\napplication, the applicant must serve notice on the \"the\n\nCommissioner and the local board of education.\"    N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-4(c).   In turn, the Commissioner must notify \"the\n\nmembers of the State Legislature, school superintendents, and\n\nmayors and governing bodies of all legislative districts, school\n\ndistricts, or municipalities in which there are students who\n\nwill be eligible for enrollment in the charter school.\"     Ibid.\n\nIn contrast, a proposed amendment to an existing school charter\n\nrequires notice only to \"the Commissioner and the district\n\nboard(s) of education or State district superintendent(s) of the\n\n\n\n\n                                21                            A-2816-12T3\n\fdistrict of residence of a charter school.\"   N.J.A.C. 6A:11-\n\n2.6(a)(2).\n\n    We cannot say that notice of all charter amendments should\n\nbe disseminated as widely as the notice of an original\n\napplication.   Some amendments may be minor, and the array of\n\npersons and offices receiving notice of the initial application\n\nare unlikely to be interested in each such modification of a\n\ncharter.   Because the local boards where the charter school is\n\nlocated will receive notice of a proposal to add a satellite\n\ncampus, there is little danger that the narrower notice\n\nrequirements for amendments will allow a charter school to sneak\n\nunannounced into a new location by means of a satellite campus.\n\nWe will not interfere with the administrative authority of the\n\nState Board and impose stricter notice requirements on the\n\namendment process in the absence of evidence that the current\n\nrequirement is inadequate.\n\n    Finally, ELC and Save Our Schools argue that the State\n\nBoard's repeal of N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a)(2) was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious because the charter amendment process should never be\n\nused to change \"the mission, goals and objectives of a charter\n\nschool.\"   In its responses to public comment on the new\n\nregulations, the Department of Education explained that the\n\nrestriction contained in the prior regulation \"runs counter to\n\n\n\n\n                                22                         A-2816-12T3\n\fthe Department's goal of enabling charter schools to\n\ncontinuously improve and grow quality programs.\"   44 N.J.R.\n\n2151(a).\n\n    Nothing in the enabling legislation required that the\n\n\"mission, goals and objectives of a charter school\" remain\n\nstatic as initially set forth in the school's application.     As a\n\ncharter school expands, its original mission statements may also\n\nrequire expansion.   The repeal of N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a)(2) was\n\nno doubt intended to eliminate an obstacle to favorable\n\nexpansion or modification of a charter school's program.    It was\n\nwithin the authority of the State Board, and not an arbitrary or\n\ncapricious administrative action.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                23                         A-2816-12T3\n\f",

Sciarra, on the\n         brief).\n\n         Lauren A.

We conclude the\n\nregulations are a valid exercise of the State Board's\n\nadministrative authority.\n\n    The Education Law Center (ELC) challenges the State Board's\n\nadoption of two amended regulations and the repeal of a third\n\napplicable under the Charter School Program Act of 1995 (the\n\nAct), N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-1 to -18.   Save Our Schools New Jersey,\n\nwhich describes itself as a volunteer-led organization of\n\nparents and concerned residents of New Jersey, supports ELC's\n\nappeal as an amicus curiae.\n\n    ELC and Save Our Schools contend that the State Board\n\nexceeded its statutory authority and acted arbitrarily and\n\ncapriciously when it: (1) amended N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a)(1)(iv)\n\nto authorize the addition of satellite campuses to some existing\n\ncharter schools; (2) amended N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.2 to define the\n\n\n\n\n                               2                            A-2816-12T3\n\fterm \"satellite campus\"; and (3) repealed N.J.A.C. 6A:11-\n\n2.6(a)(2), which had barred existing charter schools from\n\namending their charters to alter the mission, goals, or\n\nobjectives of the school.   ELC and Save Our Schools contend that\n\nthe revised regulations are an expansion of the charter school\n\nprogram and that such an expansion may be accomplished only by\n\nthe Legislature enacting new laws, not by the State Board and\n\nthe Commissioner of Education through administrative action.\n\nSave Our Schools adds that the regulatory amendments risk\n\ncreating charter schools that will fail, and the failures will\n\nhave a disproportionate impact on impoverished school children\n\nin under-performing school districts.\n\n    We conclude that the State Board had the statutory\n\nauthority to amend and repeal its regulations as it did, and\n\nthat the speculative policy arguments advanced by Save Our\n\nSchools may be better addressed to the Legislature or to\n\nindividual charter school expansions than as a facial attack on\n\nthe amended regulations.    We affirm the State Board's action in\n\nadopting and repealing the challenged regulations.\n\n                                 I.\n\n    \"A charter school [is] a public school operated under a\n\ncharter granted by the [C]ommissioner [of Education], which is\n\noperated independently of a local board of education and is\n\n\n\n\n                                 3                          A-2816-12T3\n\fmanaged by a board of trustees.\"     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-3(a).\n\nCharter schools are funded primarily by taxes collected from the\n\npublic that would otherwise fund traditional public education.\n\nSee N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-12.   A charter school may not enroll\n\nstudents on the basis of selective criteria such as\n\n\"intellectual or athletic ability,\" and it may not discriminate\n\non the basis of \"measures of achievement or aptitude, status as\n\na handicapped person, proficiency in the English language, or\n\nany other basis that would be illegal if used by a [public]\n\nschool district.\"    N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-7.     A charter school may,\n\nhowever, \"limit admission . . . to areas of concentration of the\n\nschool, such as mathematics, science, or the arts,\" and it may\n\n\"establish reasonable criteria to evaluate prospective\n\nstudents.\"   Ibid.\n\n    The legislative purpose of authorizing charter schools is\n\nto promote educational reform \"by providing a mechanism for the\n\nimplementation of a variety of educational approaches which may\n\nnot be available in the traditional public school classroom.\"\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:36A-2.   The Legislature found that \"the\n\nestablishment of a charter school program is in the best\n\ninterests of the students of this State and it is therefore the\n\npublic policy of the State to encourage and facilitate the\n\ndevelopment of charter schools.\"     Ibid.\n\n\n\n\n                                 4                            A-2816-12T3\n\f      The Legislature granted to the State Board the authority to\n\nadopt such rules and regulations as are \"necessary to effectuate\n\nthe provisions of\" the enabling legislation.    N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-\n\n18.   The first series of regulations under the Act were adopted\n\nby the State Board in July 1997.    29 N.J.R. 3492(a) (Aug. 4,\n\n1997); N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.1 to -6.4.\n\n      Together with the statutory criteria, see N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-\n\n4, -4.1, -5, the regulations subject a proposed charter school\n\nto a rigorous application process.     See N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1.\n\nAmong the many requirements, the application must state the\n\nschool's educational goals and objectives, the admission\n\ncriteria for students, the assessment methods that will\n\ndetermine whether students are achieving the stated goals of the\n\nschool, and the address and description of the physical building\n\nin which the school will be located.

The application\n\nprocess also includes an in-depth interview of representatives\n\nof the school with the Commissioner of Education and a\n\npreparedness visit with personnel from the Department of\n\nEducation.   Ibid.\n\n      Once a charter school has been established, the\n\nCommissioner must assess annually whether the school is meeting\n\nthe goals stated in its charter.     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16(a).     If\n\nthe school violates any provision of its charter, the\n\n\n\n\n                                5                              A-2816-12T3\n\fCommissioner may revoke the charter, place the school on\n\nprobationary status, require the school to take corrective\n\naction, or reject renewal of the charter for a subsequent term.\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:36A-17.\n\n       Since adoption of the original implementing regulations in\n\n1997, charter schools have been permitted to \"apply to the\n\nCommissioner for an amendment to the charter . . . .\"     N.J.A.C.\n\n6A:11-2.6; 29 N.J.R. 3492(a).     However, the original regulations\n\nprohibited an amendment that would alter the mission, goals or\n\nobjectives of the existing charter school, N.J.A.C. 6A:11-\n\n2.6(a)(2) (repealed), and they made no reference to satellite\n\ncampuses.    29 N.J.R. 3492(a).\n\n       The Department of Education proposed the challenged\n\nregulatory changes in May 2012 by means of the formal process\n\nfor amending the charter school regulations.     See N.J.A.C. 6A:6-\n\n3.1.   ELC submitted written comments to the State Board opposing\n\n\"strongly\" the proposed new regulations on the ground that they\n\npermitted expansion of the State's charter school program\n\nthrough regulation rather than legislative action.    The State\n\nBoard reviewed comments from ELC and others and made some\n\nchanges to the proposed amendments, but it did not rescind or\n\nmodify the proposed regulatory changes that are the subject of\n\nthis appeal.    After the State Board published notice of the\n\n\n\n\n                                  6                          A-2816-12T3\n\fproposed amendments in the New Jersey Register, 44 N.J.R.\n\n2151(a) (Sept. 4, 2012), a sixty-day public comment period\n\nopened, and the State Board took public testimony on the\n\nproposed changes.   Over ELC's continuing objections, the State\n\nBoard amended N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a) on December 5, 2012, to\n\nauthorize satellite campuses in some school districts.     45\n\nN.J.R. 26(a) (Jan. 7, 2013).\n\n    As amended, N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a) now states:\n\n         A charter school may apply to the\n         Commissioner for an amendment to the charter\n         following the final granting of the charter.\n         1. Examples of what a charter school may\n         seek an amendment include, but are not\n         limited to, the following:\n\n         i.   Expanding enrollment;\n         ii. Expanding grade levels;\n         iii. Changing or adding a district or region\n         of residence; or\n         iv. Opening a new satellite campus.\n\n    The Board also defined the term \"satellite campus,\"\n\nlimiting its application to certain school districts in\n\nunderprivileged areas:\n\n         \"Satellite campus\" means a school facility,\n         located within a district with a priority\n         school[1] or a former Abbott District as of\n\n\n1\n  \"Priority school\" is defined as \"a school that demonstrates\nvery low levels of success in either school wide student\nproficiency rates or overall graduation rates as determined by\ncriteria at N.J.A.C. 6A:33-2.1(b).\" N.J.A.C. 6A:33-1.3.\n\n\n\n\n                                7                           A-2816-12T3\n\f         July 1, 2012,[2] operated by a charter school\n         under the school's charter that is in\n         addition to the facility identified in the\n         charter school application or charter, if\n         subsequently amended.\n\n         [N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.2.]\n\n    Lastly, the Board repealed N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a)(2), which\n\npreviously stated that an \"amendment shall not change the\n\nmission, goals and objectives of a charter school.\"\n\n                                II.\n\n    ELC asserts that the State Board exceeded its statutory\n\nauthority in adopting the satellite campus regulations, and\n\nacted arbitrarily and capriciously in repealing N.J.A.C. 6A:11-\n\n2.6(a)(2).

The Legislature granted to the\n\nState Board the authority to promulgate regulations and\n\namendments to the charter school program.     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-18.\n\nThe Legislature did not expressly authorize satellite campuses,\n\nbut it also did not expressly prohibit them.\n\n    The State Board emphasizes the Legislature's overarching\n\npurpose to encourage and facilitate the development of charter\n\n\n\n\n                                 11                         A-2816-12T3\n\fschools.   The Act expressly set forth its purposes in N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-2, the Legislature finding and declaring that:\n\n           [T]he establishment of charter schools as\n           part of this State's program of public\n           education can assist in promoting\n           comprehensive educational reform by\n           providing a mechanism for the implementation\n           of a variety of educational approaches which\n           may not be available in the traditional\n           public school classroom. Specifically,\n           charter schools offer the potential to\n           improve pupil learning; increase for\n           students and parents the educational choices\n           available when selecting the learning\n           environment which they feel may be the most\n           appropriate; encourage the use of different\n           and innovative learning methods; establish a\n           new form of accountability for schools;\n           require the measurement of learning\n           outcomes; make the school the unit for\n           educational improvement; and establish new\n           professional opportunities for teachers.\n\n    ELC acknowledges these purposes of the Act but argues that\n\nother statutory provisions demonstrate the Legislature's intent\n\nnot to permit expansion of the charter school program without\n\nits own express approval.     ELC points to the specificity of the\n\nprocedures laid out for establishing a charter school, N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-4, and the detailed, wide-ranging information that must\n\nbe included in an application for a charter, N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-5.\n\nIt also cites a subsection of the Act expressly prohibiting\n\nexpansion or modification of the charter school program without\n\nprior legislative approval.     N.J.S.A. 18A:36-16(e).\n\n\n\n\n                                  12                        A-2816-12T3\n\f    If this last-cited statutory provision expressly prohibits\n\nany action by the State Board that has the effect of expanding\n\nthe charter school program, our inquiry is at an end — satellite\n\ncampuses are not permitted.   But we do not read N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-16(e) as ELC urges.   ELC cites the concluding sentence\n\nof that subsection, which states: \"The commissioner may not\n\nimplement any recommended expansion, modification, or\n\ntermination of the program until the Legislature acts on that\n\nrecommendation.\"   But as the State Board argues, the quoted\n\nsentence should not be read in isolation from the rest of\n\nN.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16 and the entire Act.\n\n    Subsection (a) of N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16 requires that the\n\nCommissioner annually assess and conduct a comprehensive review\n\nof each charter school.   Subsection (b) requires each charter\n\nschool to submit an annual report to the Commissioner and others\n\nto facilitate the Commissioner's assessment and review.     With\n\nrespect to the specific issue raised in this appeal, in\n\nsubsections (c) through (e), the Legislature directed a review\n\nof the entire, State-wide charter school program.   Those\n\nsubsections directed the Commissioner to hold public hearings by\n\nApril 1, 2001, as a part of a comprehensive review of the\n\nState's entire charter school program; to \"commission an\n\nindependent study of the charter school program\"; and to issue\n\n\n\n\n                                13                          A-2816-12T3\n\fto the Governor, the Legislature, and the State Board by October\n\n1, 2001, \"an evaluation of the charter school program.\"\n\n    The requirement for a State-wide review, six years after\n\nthe Legislature authorized charter schools in 1995, was enacted\n\nas an amendment to the Act in 2000.    L. 2000, c. 142, § 3\n\n(effective Nov. 2, 2000).   The Legislature set deadlines in 2001\n\nfor the Commissioner's evaluation and report, which was to\n\ncontain specific, listed items of information based on public\n\nhearings and the Commissioner's independent study of the State-\n\nwide program.   N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16(e).    The prohibition\n\nspecified in the last sentence of subsection (e) refers to that\n\nsix-year report and its recommendations.    It does not refer\n\ngenerally to any modification of the charter school program that\n\nmay otherwise be authorized by the Act.\n\n    A broad reading of N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-16(e) as ELC urges\n\nwould contravene the legislative purpose of encouraging\n\ninnovative educational methodology through the charter school\n\nprogram.   See In re Grant of Charter to Merit Preparatory\n\nCharter Sch. of Newark, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J. Super.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (App. Div.),\n\ncertif. denied, ___ N.J. ___ (2014).   We do not read the Act as\n\nrequiring legislative action for every type of amendment to\n\nexisting school charters that might have the effect of expanding\n\nthe school's educational program.\n\n\n\n\n                                14                            A-2816-12T3\n\f    Making a more concrete argument, ELC contends that the Act\n\ndid not authorize expansion of an existing charter school beyond\n\nits initially-approved physical building.     ELC contends the term\n\n\"charter school\" means \"one building\" because the historic\n\nmeaning of \"school\" is a single building.     We are not persuaded.\n\nThe Act authorizes charter schools to acquire by purchase,\n\nlease, or gift real property for use as a school facility,\n\neither from public or from private sources.     N.J.S.A. 18A:36A-\n\n6(c).   The Act does not limit charter schools to acquiring only\n\none building.\n\n    Furthermore, nothing in the Act or the prior regulations\n\nprohibits an existing charter school from expanding its\n\noperations with the acquisition or use of additional buildings\n\nrather than expanding only within its original building.     In the\n\ncase of an existing charter school that seeks to expand into\n\nadditional physical space, it makes little sense to require a\n\nwhole new application and the resulting review process.    While a\n\nsatellite campus is not the same as expanding into additional\n\nphysical space immediately adjacent to the existing facility,\n\nthe satellite campus would still be part of the same school.      A\n\nschool is more than a building.    It is an educational program,\n\nand the teaching, administrative, and operational staff that\n\ndevises and runs the program.   Site unity is an appropriate\n\n\n\n\n                                  15                        A-2816-12T3\n\fconsideration in evaluating the potential success or problems of\n\na proposed charter school, but a remote site does not make a\n\nwholly different school.\n\n    More to the point, \"[i]n determining whether a particular\n\nadministrative act enjoys statutory authorization, the reviewing\n\ncourt may look beyond the specific terms of the enabling act to\n\nthe statutory policy sought to be achieved.\"    Hearing Aid\n\nDispensers, supra, 75 N.J. at 562.   Here, the Legislature\n\nintended that the Act provide options and opportunities of\n\npublic education for parents and children.     See Merit\n\nPreparatory Charter Sch., supra, 435 N.J. Super. at 281.\n\nPermitting the addition of a new building for purposes of\n\nexpanding a successful charter school is consistent with these\n\nlegislative purposes of the Act.\n\n    Neither the Act nor the prior regulations prohibited a\n\ncharter school from expanding its services by means of an\n\namendment to its charter.   We are persuaded by the State Board's\n\nargument that: \"Under the charter amendment regulations, charter\n\nschools have long been permitted to apply for amendments to\n\nincrease enrollment, add additional grade levels, and add or\n\nchange a district of residence,\" and \"permitting certain\n\n[existing, successful] charter schools to establish a satellite\n\ncampus is . . . a natural extension of the schools' ability to\n\n\n\n\n                                16                            A-2816-12T3\n\fexpand enrollment and grade levels.\"    Thus, according to the\n\nState Board, \"the establishment of a satellite campus is simply\n\nanother means through which a high performing charter school may\n\nseek to expand.\"\n\n    ELC and Save Our Schools express strong misgivings about\n\npermitting expansion to new locations by means of amendment of a\n\nschool's charter rather than by the school submitting an initial\n\napplication pursuant to the Act for the satellite location.\n\nThey claim the amendment procedure shortcuts the Legislature's\n\nintent that charter schools undergo a rigorous and searching\n\napplication process.

Super.</span> <span class=\"page\">375</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 380-81 (App. Div. 2010).    They contend that\n\na correct reading of the Act requires that the State Board and\n\nthe Department of Education conduct a full initial review before\n\na satellite location can be approved.\n\n    The State Board responds that a repetition of the full\n\napplication process is not needed because an existing charter\n\nschool has already undergone that review and, what is more, a\n\nsatellite campus would be authorized only for an existing\n\ncharter school that has proven it can operate successfully.      The\n\nState Board argues that beginning a new application process\n\nwould unnecessarily hamper expansion of successful charter\n\nschools that seek to serve more pupils.\n\n\n\n\n                                17                          A-2816-12T3\n\f     We agree that the addition of a satellite campus is more\n\nlike the expansion of grade and enrollment levels than the\n\nopening of an entirely new charter school.   Contrary to ELC's\n\nargument, the amended regulations do not allow a satellite\n\ncampus in a district other than in the district or region\n\nalready served by an existing charter school.   The State Board\n\nacknowledged in its brief and in oral argument before us that\n\nthe definition of \"satellite campus\" in N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.1\n\nrefers to a separate location but in the same school district as\n\nthe existing charter school, or within the contiguous school\n\ndistricts that are the regional district of residence of a\n\ncharter school.3   ELC expresses unfounded fear that the\n\nCommissioner will approve \"far flung\" satellite campuses without\n\nadequate evaluation of the proposed building, the demographics\n\nof the area, the school program, and the school staff.\n\n     Save Our Schools is concerned that the Commissioner and the\n\nDepartment of Education will not adequately evaluate satellite\n\ncampuses for the physical safety and suitability of the site for\n\neducational use.   This argument is speculative and not borne out\n\n3\n  A charter school is located in a \"district of residence,\" which\nis defined as \"the school district in which a charter school\nfacility is physically located; if a charter school is approved\nwith a region of residence comprised of contiguous school\ndistricts, that region is the charter school's district of\nresidence.\" N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.2.\n\n\n\n\n                                18                          A-2816-12T3\n\fby any facts.   In proposing the amended regulations, the\n\nDepartment of Education commented: \"Facilities identified by an\n\namendment request for a satellite campus are subject to the same\n\nreview and approval procedures for new charter school facilities\n\n. . . .\"    45 N.J.R. 26(a).   We must assume the Commissioner will\n\nrequire an adequate evaluation of a proposed satellite campus\n\nsite and reject any charter amendment that fails to meet\n\nappropriate standards for a school building.     If a proposed\n\ncampus presents safety concerns or is otherwise unsuitable for\n\nthe educational needs of children, Save Our Schools or other\n\ninterested parties should raise specific objections to the\n\nproposed amended charter.\n\n    Similarly, Save Our Schools argues that the charter\n\namendment procedures circumvent the constitutional requirement\n\nthat the Commissioner take into account the potential effect of\n\na charter school on this State's anti-discrimination laws and\n\npolicies.    It posits that, because the regulations only allow\n\nsatellite campuses to open \"within a district with a priority\n\nschool or former Abbott District,\" N.J.A.C. 6A:11-1.2, \"the\n\nincreased risk of charter school failure at satellite campuses\n\nwill be borne disproportionately by impoverished communities and\n\ncommunities of color.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                  19                        A-2816-12T3\n\f    As our Supreme Court recently explained, constitutional and\n\nstatutory law imposes requirements with which the Commissioner\n\nmust comply when evaluating an application for a charter school:\n\n         First, the Commissioner must assess the\n         racial impact that a charter school\n         applicant will have on the district of\n         residence in which the charter school will\n         operate and must use the full panoply of\n         [his or her] powers to avoid segregation\n         resulting from the grant of a charter school\n         application. Second, if the local school\n         district demonstrates with some specificity\n         that the constitutional requirements of a\n         thorough and efficient education would be\n         jeopardized by [the district's] loss of the\n         funds to be allocated to a charter school,\n         the Commissioner is obligated to evaluate\n         carefully the impact that loss of funds\n         would have on the ability of the district of\n         residence to deliver a thorough and\n         efficient education.\n\n         [Quest Academy Charter Sch., supra, 216 N.J.\n         at 377-78 (quotation marks and citations\n         omitted).]\n\n    In Quest Academy, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the\n\nCommissioner had promised to be \"exceedingly careful in the\n\napproval of charter schools because of the impact that a wrong\n\ndecision will have on students who attend a charter school that\n\nfalters, or worse, fails to provide an educational program that\n\nsatisfies the constitutional standard of a thorough and\n\nefficient education.\"   Id. at 388.   Charter amendments are not\n\napproved without careful review by the Department of Education\n\nand the Commissioner, and the public's opportunity to\n\n\n\n                                20                         A-2816-12T3\n\fparticipate through their representatives on the local board of\n\neducation.   See N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(c).   The Legislature granted\n\nto the Commissioner discretion initially to approve or reject a\n\ncharter and further discretion to approve or reject amendments\n\nto a charter.   We have no basis on this record to speculate that\n\nthe Commissioner will not apply statutory and constitutional\n\nrequirements when reviewing a proposed amendment to add a\n\nsatellite campus to an existing charter school.\n\n    ELC and Save Our Schools argue, nevertheless, that the\n\namended regulations do not require notice of a proposed charter\n\namendment to be disseminated to all the same persons and\n\nentities as the notices that must be served for an initial\n\napplication for a charter.   For purposes of an initial\n\napplication, the applicant must serve notice on the \"the\n\nCommissioner and the local board of education.\"    N.J.S.A.\n\n18A:36A-4(c).   In turn, the Commissioner must notify \"the\n\nmembers of the State Legislature, school superintendents, and\n\nmayors and governing bodies of all legislative districts, school\n\ndistricts, or municipalities in which there are students who\n\nwill be eligible for enrollment in the charter school.\"     Ibid.\n\nIn contrast, a proposed amendment to an existing school charter\n\nrequires notice only to \"the Commissioner and the district\n\nboard(s) of education or State district superintendent(s) of the\n\n\n\n\n                                21                            A-2816-12T3\n\fdistrict of residence of a charter school.\"   N.J.A.C. 6A:11-\n\n2.6(a)(2).\n\n    We cannot say that notice of all charter amendments should\n\nbe disseminated as widely as the notice of an original\n\napplication.   Some amendments may be minor, and the array of\n\npersons and offices receiving notice of the initial application\n\nare unlikely to be interested in each such modification of a\n\ncharter.   Because the local boards where the charter school is\n\nlocated will receive notice of a proposal to add a satellite\n\ncampus, there is little danger that the narrower notice\n\nrequirements for amendments will allow a charter school to sneak\n\nunannounced into a new location by means of a satellite campus.\n\nWe will not interfere with the administrative authority of the\n\nState Board and impose stricter notice requirements on the\n\namendment process in the absence of evidence that the current\n\nrequirement is inadequate.\n\n    Finally, ELC and Save Our Schools argue that the State\n\nBoard's repeal of N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a)(2) was arbitrary and\n\ncapricious because the charter amendment process should never be\n\nused to change \"the mission, goals and objectives of a charter\n\nschool.\"   In its responses to public comment on the new\n\nregulations, the Department of Education explained that the\n\nrestriction contained in the prior regulation \"runs counter to\n\n\n\n\n                                22                         A-2816-12T3\n\fthe Department's goal of enabling charter schools to\n\ncontinuously improve and grow quality programs.\"   44 N.J.R.\n\n2151(a).\n\n    Nothing in the enabling legislation required that the\n\n\"mission, goals and objectives of a charter school\" remain\n\nstatic as initially set forth in the school's application.     As a\n\ncharter school expands, its original mission statements may also\n\nrequire expansion.   The repeal of N.J.A.C. 6A:11-2.6(a)(2) was\n\nno doubt intended to eliminate an obstacle to favorable\n\nexpansion or modification of a charter school's program.    It was\n\nwithin the authority of the State Board, and not an arbitrary or\n\ncapricious administrative action.\n\n    Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                23                         A-2816-12T3\n\f</pre>",
