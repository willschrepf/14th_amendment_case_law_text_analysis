When respondent’s family\nsupport system fell apart, she relinquished custody of her two-month-old daughter to the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Subsequently, the DHHS took\nrespondent’s newborn son into care. Although the child protective proceedings persisted for\nmore than three years and the DHHS was well aware of respondent’s special needs, the case\nservice plan never included reasonable accommodations to provide respondent a meaningful\nopportunity to benefit. Absent such accommodations, the DHHS failed in its statutory duty to\nmake reasonable efforts to reunify the family unit. And absent reasonable efforts, the DHHS\nlacked clear and convincing evidence to support the statutory grounds cited in the termination\npetition. We therefore vacate the circuit court’s order terminating respondent’s parental rights to\nher two minor children and remand for reconsideration following the provision of necessary\naccommodated services.\n\n                        I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        Psychological testing revealed that respondent has a Full Scale IQ of 70, placing her in\nthe second percentile and borderline range of intellectual functioning.             Her Verbal\nComprehension index is 66, within the extremely low range. Her scores related to perceptual\nreasoning, processing speed, and working memory are equally low. Caseworkers commented on\nthe overt appearance of respondent’s impairment upon meeting her, as well as noting her\ndifficulty in communicating on the telephone, her shyness and hesitancy, and her flat affect.\nChild Protective Services (CPS) had been intermittently involved in respondent’s life since she\nwas seven years old. Despite this early intervention and respondent’s obvious cognitive or\ndevelopmental impairments, she never received special education services as a child.\n\n       Respondent’s mother, CB, is also cognitively impaired. For many years, CB’s mother\nlived with CB and her four children to assist in running the household. Following the\n                                                -1-\n\fgrandmother’s death, the family’s wellbeing dramatically declined. In November 2011, CPS\nintervened and removed CB’s minor children from her care. At that time, respondent (by then an\nadult), her boyfriend (AH), and CB’s boyfriend, Steven Butler, a registered child sex offender,\nalso lived in the home. Respondent’s younger sister accused Butler of rape, but CB did not end\ntheir relationship.1 A CPS worker advised the pregnant respondent that she would be required to\nmake other living arrangements upon her child’s birth but provided no services or assistance to\nthe young, disabled mother.\n\n        Respondent’s daughter, DH, was born on January 29, 2012.2 CB subsequently threatened\nto evict respondent and the infant. On April 10, 2012, respondent appeared at the CPS office.\nShe told CPS worker Cordell Huckaby that she was about to be homeless and felt overwhelmed\nby trying to care for two-month-old DH on her own. Huckaby reported that respondent\n“displayed abnormal behavior that presented concerns that she may have some untreated mental\nhealth issues.” Huckaby spent more than four hours with respondent. With CB’s help, Huckaby\ncontacted various family members and friends to find housing for respondent and DH.\nRespondent’s grandmother in Cleveland, Ohio offered mother and baby a home, as did a local\nfamily friend. Respondent declined both placements, and the DHHS took DH into care on an\nemergency basis and placed her with a nonrelative.\n\n        The circuit court did not adjudicate respondent unfit for another ten months; respondent\nbore no fault for this dealy. In the meantime, due to a series of CPS and DHHS errors,\nrespondent was denied parenting time. Huckaby was the only official present at the initial child\nprotective hearings. He indicated that parenting time sessions had to be arranged through the\nDHHS caseworker. However, Huckaby was uncertain of the caseworker’s identity. When\nrespondent attempted to contact the DHHS to arrange visits, her messages received no follow up.\n\n        In late October 2012, the DHHS finally assigned a caseworker who appeared willing and\nable to assist respondent. Beth Houle initially had difficulty connecting with respondent, noting\nthat “she was extremely hard to understand when she left messages.” Houle arranged for\nsupervised parenting time sessions starting December 12, 2012.\n\n        An adjudication trial was finally conducted on January 28, 2013, and Houle created an\n“Updated Service Plan” for respondent. This plan was actually the first service plan provided.\nDespite that DH had been in care for 10 months and CPS had been involved with respondent\nsince November 2011, no services had yet been offered. Under the January 2013 case service\nplan, respondent was required to undergo a psychological evaluation, participate in therapy and\nparenting classes, visit the child for three hours each week, earn her GED, and find employment\nand a home. Respondent, pregnant with her second child, was then bouncing between the homes\nof various relatives.\n\n\n1\n In the proceedings related to CB’s parental rights, respondent asserted that Butler had raped her\nwhen she was 18 years old.\n2\n  Shortly after DH’s birth, a protective order was entered precluding AH’s contact with his\ndaughter, leaving respondent to care for the child alone.\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f        Respondent gave birth to her son, EB, on February 7, 2013. An aunt offered to give\nrespondent and the baby a home but the DHHS deemed the placement inappropriate.\nAccordingly, the DHHS immediately took EB into care and placed him with his sister. At the\npreliminary hearing regarding EB’s placement, a CPS worker, Jacqueline Baskerville,\nacknowledged that respondent has “emotional . . . and cognitive . . . issues - - impairments.” The\nFebruary 13, 2013 petition to take EB into care recited, “According to Hutzel Hospital social\nworker Vernice Muldrew, [respondent] was given a psychiatric evaluation and it was determined\nthat she should reside in an adult foster care home as she will need assistance with her daily\ncare.”\n\n        Despite the recommendation that respondent be placed in adult foster care, she found\nherself living in a homeless shelter upon her hospital release. During a February 19, 2013\ninterview with DHHS work Joseph Emerinini, respondent expressed confusion as to why her\nchildren were in care, apparently forgetting that she had requested DH’s placement. Emerinini\nelaborated:\n\n       [Respondent] appears to have some intellectual impairments. [Respondent] has\n       difficulties in making decisions . . . . When leaving voice messages she is hard to\n       understand, slurring words and during one message appeared to be coaxed by\n       someone on what to say. [Respondent] only has completion of 9th grade\n       education and has a hard time understanding simple tasks. [Respondent] . . . was\n       not able to write in complete sentences.\n\nWhile respondent could read to some extent, Emerinini described her comprehension level as\nlow.\n\n       Case notes throughout the report also revealed Houle’s concerns about respondent’s\ncapacity and abilities. On February 26, 2013, Houle informed respondent’s therapist, Shelita\nRichmond, that respondent “is in need of guidance and understanding of how to be independent\nand self sufficient[.]” Houle described respondent as “quiet” and as needing specific direction\nbecause she would not do anything beyond the instructions given. Houle advised the parenting\nclass coordinator that respondent “appears to have some cognitive delays and does not\nunderstand some things presented to her, and things need to be explained to her in simple terms.”\n\n       The circuit court judge assigned to the matter also seemed to recognize respondent’s\nimpairment given the manner in which he spoke to respondent on the record. For example, at the\nadjudication trial in relation to EB, the court instructed:\n\n       [Respondent], you need to speak up as if you’re mad at me so this nice young\n       lady in front of me can prepare a transcript; okay?\n\n               And oh, by the way, I only eat attorneys; okay?\n\n                                             * * *\n\n              I’m going to ask you to do something that’s really very rude. Your\n       attorney is going to ask you questions. Could you answer them facing this nice\n       young lady in front of me so she can prepare a good transcript of this.\n\n                                               -3-\n\fThe only time that respondent said anything beyond “yes” or “no” at any proceeding was at that\ntrial. An attorney asked respondent whether she suffered from depression and she indicated,\n“When I get around people I be mad.”\n\n       Respondent was not evaluated by a psychologist and psychiatrist for the purposes of the\ncase service plan until May 2013. Before that time, and without benefit of the knowledge of\nrespondent’s cognitive abilities, the DHHS referred her for parenting classes and therapy. The\nagency also referred respondent to Focus Hope for GED preparation classes and employment\nand job skills training, with no concept of whether she could benefit from those services. Houle\ndid note that the initiation of the various services had to be staggered because “[i]t appears that\ntoo much given to [respondent] at a time is overwhelming for her.” Houle also secured the\nappointment of a “parent partner” for respondent. However, that individual never testified at any\nhearing and the record is devoid of information regarding any assistance that person may have\nprovided.\n\n        As noted, testing revealed that respondent had “low cognitive functioning.” The\npsychologist reported that respondent’s scores and lack of “insight” revealed that “she may be\nlimited in her ability to independently manage more complex activities of daily living.” The\npsychologist recommended “behavioral therapy that utilizes in-session role-playing to address\nconcerns.” The psychologist further opined, “It may be beneficial to administer a measure of\nadaptive functioning to determine specific strengths and weaknesses with regard to activities of\ndaily living.” Neither recommendation was ever implemented.\n\n       Instead, for the next two years, the DHHS continued to provide services geared toward a\nparent of average cognitive functioning.3 Richmond provided more hands-on assistance during\ntherapy sessions. She actively worked with respondent in her search for employment, Section 8\nhousing, and Social Security Disability (SSD) income. None of these attempts were fruitful.\nHoule was sensitive to respondent’s needs, but did not seek out specialized wrap-around services\ndesigned to assist the cognitively impaired.\n\n       The DHHS continued to search for an appropriate relative who could provide housing\nand parenting assistance to respondent. She moved in with her uncle, his girlfriend, and their\nchildren in May 2013, and remained in their home for nearly the entirety of the proceedings.\nAlthough respondent’s uncle was willing to provide additional assistance to respondent, he was\nnot willing to have the children placed in his home. Respondent’s grandmother in Cleveland,\nOhio indicated that respondent and the children could be placed with her. However, given her\nadvanced age, the grandmother asserted that respondent would be entirely responsible for the\nchildren’s care. The DHHS found respondent ill-equipped to handle that responsibility.\n\n       The DHHS eventually transitioned respondent’s services to Michigan Rehabilitation\nCenter, Northeast Guidance Center, and then Care Link. Although these agencies provide in-\n\n\n3\n Counsel for the DHHS had no objection to extending the case beyond the traditional 15 month\nperiod, acknowledging that respondent required additional time to benefit from services given\nher cognitive impairment.\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fdepth services to the cognitively impaired, respondent was not referred for that type of\nassistance. Instead, respondent merely continued in parenting classes and therapy through these\nproviders. In the summer of 2014, Yasmin Gibson replaced Houle as the caseworker assigned to\nthe case. After that assignment, respondent’s prospects quickly went downhill. Even two\nmonths after her assignment, Gibson knew very little about the status of respondent’s case.\nGibson did not understand the level of respondent’s impairment and had made no follow-up with\nrespondent’s service providers. She also abruptly discontinued assisting respondent in her bid to\nsecure Section 8 housing and SSD income.\n\n        Given the change in DHHS personnel, respondent’s attorney, Julie Gilflix, took a more\nproactive role. She requested that the DHHS transfer respondent’s services to the Neighborhood\nServices Organization (NSO), which would provide intensive services even beyond the child\nprotective proceedings. NSO secures employment opportunities for the cognitively impaired, as\nwell as assistance in “supportive housing,” educational support, and parenting classes.4 Gilflix\nexpressed concern that the DHHS had not provided her client “intense services” and was “not\nworking with her individually” or “looking at her individual needs.” Gilflix was dismayed that\nGibson assumed respondent could independently find a job when she “need[ed] assistance in\nreading” and completing the necessary applications. The circuit court dismissed Gilflix’s\nconcerns, stating “I really don’t think workers should be in the business of taking parents by the\nhand.”\n\n        At a November 7, 2014 hearing, Gibson finally indicated that she was investigating the\npossibility of transferring respondent’s services to NSO. For the next six months, Gibson made\nexcuses and blamed the agencies for providing inaccurate information on how to secure the\nproper type of services for respondent. Finally, at a May 30, 2015 hearing, after which the\ncircuit court ordered the DHHS to file a termination petition, Gibson reported that NSO denied\nrespondent’s application for services because the agencies that had been providing services\nthroughout the proceedings could have been providing intensive wrap-around services for the\ncognitively impaired all along. Apparently neither Gibson nor Houle had ever investigated that\npossibility or referred respondent for the correct type of services.\n\n        On June 18, 2015, more than three years after DH had been taken into care, and despite\nthat the DHHS had never secured services geared toward assisting a cognitively impaired parent,\nthe DHHS filed a supplemental petition seeking termination. The petition cited that respondent\nhad never taken her GED or secured housing or income. The DHHS continued that respondent\nhad not benefited from services to the point she could safely parent her children.\n\n       Gibson was the only witness at the termination hearing. The DHHS did not call any\nservice providers or respondent’s therapist. The department presented absolutely no evidence,\nbeyond Gibson’s assertions, regarding whether specialized services would have assisted\nrespondent in safely parenting her children. By the time of the termination hearing, respondent\nhad moved in with her grandmother in Cleveland. Accordingly, Gibson opined that further\n\n\n4\n See Neighborhood Service Organization, <http://www.nso-mi.org/index.php> accessed April\n18, 2016).\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fservices would be impossible. In closing argument, Gilflix challenged Gibson’s claims, noting\nthat “reasonable efforts have not been made” and that respondent’s residence in Cleveland was\nnot permanent. Despite these pleas, the circuit court terminated respondent’s parental rights\nunder MCL 712A.19b(3)(c)(i) (grounds leading to adjudication have not been remedied and\ncannot be remedied within a reasonable time) and (g) (failure to provide proper care and\ncustody).\n\n                                   II. LEGAL BACKGROUND\n\n        Parents have a “fundamental liberty interest . . . in the care, custody, and management of\ntheir child[ren],” a right that “does not evaporate simply because they have not been model\nparents.” Santosky v Kramer, 455 US 745, 753; 102 S Ct 1388; 71 L Ed 2d 599 (1982). In\nMichigan, a court may terminate a person’s parental rights when clear and convincing evidence\nsupports at least one ground elucidated in MCL 712A.19b(3). Before the court may consider\ntermination, however, the DHHS must exert “reasonable efforts” to maintain the child in her or\nher parents’ care, MCL 712A.18f(1), (4), and make “reasonable efforts to reunite the child and\nfamily.” MCL 712A.19a(2).5 Reasonable efforts at reunification are made through a case\nservice plan. See In re Mason, 486 Mich 142, 156; 782 NW2d 747 (2010); MCL 712A.18f(3).\nThe need to make “reasonable efforts” stems from federal law. Pursuant to 45 CFR 1356.21(b),\nto remain eligible for foster care maintenance payments under Title IV-E, state agencies “must\nmake reasonable efforts to maintain the family unit.”\n\n        The reasonableness of the efforts provided affects the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting the grounds for termination. In re Fried, 266 Mich App 535, 541; 702 NW2d 192\n(2005). However, neither the federal nor the state statutes define the “reasonable efforts”\nnecessary to reunify or maintain the family unit. We know from our Supreme Court’s\ndifferentiation of “reasonable” from “active” efforts under the Indian Child Welfare Act that\n“reasonable efforts” include a DHHS worker “making a referral for services and attempt[ing] to\nengage the family in services.” In re JL, 483 Mich 300, 322 n 15; 770 NW2d 853 (2009). Our\ncourts have not expressly defined the parameters of necessary services.\n\n        This system is complicated when the parent involved in a child protective proceeding\nsuffers from some type of disability. According to Rocking the Cradle: Ensuring the Rights of\nParents with Disabilities and Their Children, National Council on Disability (September 27,\n2012), p 90: “Systematic discrimination by state courts, child welfare agencies, and legislatures\nagainst parents with disabilities and their families” have led to the removal of children from the\ncare of disabled parents “with alarming frequency.”6 Parents with intellectual and psychiatric\n\n\n5\n   The statute provides that reasonable reunification efforts are not required in limited\ncircumstances, such as where the parent has been convicted in the killing or serious injury of the\nchild’s sibling, has had his or her parental rights terminated to the child’s sibling, is a registered\nsex offender, or if aggravated circumstances exist under MCL 722.638(1) or (2). MCL\n712A.19a(2).\n6\n  Available at <https://www.ncd.gov/publications/2012/Sep272012/Ch13> (accessed April 18,\n2016).\n\n\n                                                 -6-\n\fdisabilities face the steepest obstacles, experiencing discrimination based on stereotyping, “lack\nof individualized assessments,” and the failure to provide the types of services needed for the\nindividual to benefit. Protecting the Rights of Parents and Prospective Parents with Disabilities:\nTechnical Assistance for State and Local Child Welfare Agencies and Courts Under Title II of\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services and Department of Justice, p 2.7 This discrimination is not new\nand has previously been approved by our country’s highest court. In Buck v Bell, 274 US 200,\n207; 71 L Ed 1000 (1927), Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. lauded forced sterilization of the\nmentally incompetent “who are manifestly unfit [to] continu[e] their kind.” As a result of\ninstitutional discrimination, parents with intellectual disabilities “lose[] children at a rate of 40\npercent to 80 percent.” Rocking the Cradle, p 263. And termination is often based on the fact\nthat the parent does “not receive services that address the effects of their disability on parenting.”\nTermination of Parental Rights of Parents with Mental Disabilities, Judge David L. Bazelon\nCenter for Mental Health Law, p 2.8\n\n        When a disabled parent is a party to child protective proceedings, Section 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 USC 794, and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of\n1990 (ADA), 42 USC 12131 et seq., control the nature of the services that must be provided.\nTitle II of the ADA provides that “no qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of\nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.”\n42 USC 12132. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act similarly provides that qualified disabled\npersons shall not “be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be\nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance”\n“solely by reason of her or his disability.” 29 USC 794(a). In adopting these acts, “Congress\nacknowledged that society’s accumulated myths and fears about disability and disease are as\nhandicapping as are the physical limitations that flow from actual impairment.” School Bd of\nNassau Co, Fl v Arline, 480 US 273, 284; 107 S Ct 1123; 94 L Ed 2d 307 (1987).\n\n       As stated by this Court in In re Terry, 240 Mich App 14, 25-26; 610 NW2d 563 (2000):\n\n              [T]he ADA . . . require[s] a public agency, such as the Family\n       Independence Agency (FIA), to make reasonable accommodations for those\n       individuals with disabilities so that all persons may receive the benefits of public\n       programs and services. Thus, the reunification services and programs provided\n       by the FIA must comply with the ADA. . . . [W]e discern no conflict between the\n       ADA and Michigan’s Juvenile Code. Under MCL 712A.18f(4), before entering\n       an order of disposition, the court must determine whether the FIA has made\n       “reasonable efforts” to rectify the conditions that led to its involvement in the\n\n\n7\n    Available at <http://www.ada.gov/doj_hhs_ta/child_welfare_ta.html> (accessed April 18,\n2016).\n8\n    Available at   <http://www.peapods.us/UserFiles/File/Termination%20of%20Parental%\n20Rights%20of%20Parents%20with%20Mental%20Disabilities.pdf> (accessed April 18, 2016).\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f       case. Thus, the state legislative requirement that the FIA make reasonable efforts\n       to reunite a family is consistent with the ADA’s directive that disabilities be\n       reasonably accommodated. In other words, if the FIA fails to take into account\n       the parents’ limitations or disabilities and make any reasonable accommodations,\n       then it cannot be found that reasonable efforts were made to reunite the family.\n       [Emphasis added.]\n\n       The federal Departments of Health and Human Services and Justice have described,\n“Two principles that are fundamental to Title II of the ADA and Section 504 are: (1)\nindividualized treatment; and (2) full and equal opportunity.” Protecting the Rights of Parents\nand Prospective Parents with Disabilities, p 4. In this vein, 28 CFR 35.130(b) provides:\n\n       (1) A public entity, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or\n       through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of disability --\n\n               (i) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to\n       participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;\n\n               (ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to\n       participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that\n       afforded others;\n\n                (iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or\n       service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same\n       result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that\n       provided to others;\n\n               (iv) Provide different or separate aids, benefits, or services to individuals\n       with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to\n       others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with\n       disabilities with aids, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided\n       to others;\n\n                                               * * *\n\n       (2) A public entity may not deny a qualified individual with a disability the\n       opportunity to participate in services, programs, or activities that are not separate\n       or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or\n       activities.\n\n                                               * * *\n\n       (7) A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or\n       procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the\n       basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the\n       modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or\n       activity.\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f45 CFR 84.4 provides substantively identical protection to “qualified handicapped” individuals.\n\n       Taken together, [the various provisions of 28 CFR 35.130(b), and by extension 45\n       CFR 84.4,] are intended to prohibit exclusion and segregation of individuals with\n       disabilities and the denial of equal opportunities enjoyed by others, based on,\n       among other things, presumptions, patronizing attitudes, fears, and stereotypes\n       about individuals with disabilities. Consistent with these standards, public entities\n       are required to ensure that their actions are based on facts applicable to\n       individuals and not on presumptions as to what a class of individuals with\n       disabilities can or cannot do. [28 CFR Part 35, Appendix B, § 35.130.]\n\n                                      III. PRESERVATION\n\n       Before we reach the substance of this case, we must resolve whether respondent\npreserved her challenge to the level of services provided.\n\n       As discussed in Terry, 240 Mich App at 26:\n\n               Any claim that the FIA is violating the ADA must be raised in a timely\n       manner . . . so that any reasonable accommodations can be made. Accordingly, if\n       a parent believes that the FIA is unreasonably refusing to accommodate a\n       disability, the parent should claim a violation of her rights under the ADA, either\n       when a service plan is adopted or soon afterward. The court may then address the\n       parent’s claim under the ADA. Where a disabled person fails to make a timely\n       claim that the services provided are inadequate to her particular needs, she may\n       not argue that petitioner failed to comply with the ADA at a dispositional hearing\n       regarding whether to terminate her parental rights. In such a case, her sole remedy\n       is to commence a separate action for discrimination under the ADA. At the\n       dispositional hearing, the family court’s task is to determine, as a question of fact,\n       whether petitioner made reasonable efforts to reunite the family, without\n       reference to the ADA.5\n\n       _________________________________________________________________\n\n       5 Any claim that the parent’s rights under the ADA were violated must be raised\n       well before a dispositional hearing regarding whether to terminate her parental\n       rights, and the failure to timely raise the issue constitutes a waiver. The focus at\n       the dispositional hearing must be on the parent’s rights to the child and the best\n       interests of the child under the Juvenile Code, and the parties and the court should\n       not allow themselves to be distracted by arguments regarding the parent’s rights\n       under the ADA. Given that the court must consider whether reasonable efforts\n       were made to reunite the family, precluding specific reference to the ADA at the\n       dispositional hearing is not likely to make any difference in terms of the outcome.\n       [Emphasis added.]\n\n       __________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f       Gilflix did not raise an ADA challenge at the time the case service plan was adopted.\nNeither did she wait until the termination hearing. On January 15, 2014, Gilflix inquired\nwhether the DHHS could provide “one-on-one parenting help” for respondent and caseworker\nHoule promised to investigate this option. Gilflix specifically expressed concern that the DHHS\nwas not providing the type of services necessary to accommodate her client’s disability on\nAugust 13, 2014, and continuously repeated her concerns thereafter. Gilflix requested that\nrespondent receive specialized services for the developmentally disabled, the court ordered such\nservices, and caseworker Gibson engaged in a series of errors ensuring that the services were\nnever provided. The DHHS did not file its supplemental petition seeking termination until 10\nmonths after Gilflix’s specific request for ADA-compliant services. The termination hearing\ntook place on July 27, 2015, nearly a year after Gilflix first expressed her concern. Given the\nlength of time between Gilflix’s objection and the termination proceedings, respondent’s\nchallenges are not waived under Terry.9\n\n        We note, however, that experts have challenged the legitimacy of requiring parents to\nraise an ADA defense so long before the termination hearing. “[F]amily court cases do not\nalways proceed . . . smoothly,” and the need to file an objection may not be apparent until later in\nthe proceedings. Cecka, No Chance to Prove Themselves: The Rights of Mentally Disabled\nParents Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and State Law, 15 Va J Soc Pol’y & L 112,\n126 (2007). The court might order reasonable accommodation in services, but the DHHS’s\nfailure to provide such accommodations may not immediately leap to counsel’s attention. Id. at\n128. Moreover, the introduction of waiver principles is misplaced because a parent who raises\nsuch an objection “is not attempting to litigate the violation in family court;” rather, the parent is\nchallenging the evidentiary support for the termination. Id. at 125.\n\n                           IV. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS\n\n        We now turn to the question of how reasonable accommodations are made in child\nprotective proceedings. The DHHS directs that its workers “must recognize the individuality of\nall clients and their needs, as well as the extent of their capacities for self-determination” and\n“tailor[]” services “to meet each client’s needs and to recognize the unique aspects of each case.”\nServices General Requirements Manual, SRM 101, p 2.10 The DHHS gives its workers\n“examples of reasonable efforts,” including emergency caretakers, daycare and homemaker\nservices, counseling, emergency shelter and financial assistance, parenting classes, self-help\ngroups, mental health and substance abuse services, “home-based family services,” and\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Respondent also argues that her trial counsel was ineffective in failing to raise her ADA\nchallenge earlier in the proceedings. As we conclude that counsel did not waive review of this\nissue, we need not consider this claim.\n10\n     The    February       1, 2013 version  of    this  section  is   available at\n<http://www.mfia.state.mi.us/OLMWEB/EX/SR/Public/SRM/101.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks>\n(accessed April 18, 2016).\n\n\n                                                -10-\n\fvocational training. Children’s Foster Care Manual, FOM 722-06, pp 10-11.11 The DHHS\nacknowledges, “It is only when timely and intensive services are provided to families that\nagencies and courts can make informed decisions about a parent’s ability to protect and care for\nhis/her children.” Id. at 15. The lack of investigation and services leaves “a ‘hole’ in the\nevidence” upon which the circuit court must base its ultimate decision. In re Rood, 483 Mich 73,\n127; 763 NW2d 587 (2009) (YOUNG, J.).\n\n        The Children’s Foster Care Manual’s section on “special accommodations” makes no\nspecific mention of how to assist mentally, developmentally, or cognitively disabled parents,\ngiving individualized attention only to accommodations for the deaf and non-English speakers.\nFOM 722-06F.12 Nationwide, “[l]ittle focus has been directed at providing parenting support\nand services as part of general support for people with intellectual disabilities . . . .” Rocking the\nCradle, p 263. In “most jurisdictions,” reunification services “often do not address the parent’s\ndisability fully.” Smith, Fit Through Unfairness: The Termination of Parental Rights Due to a\nParent’s Mental Challenges, 5 Charlotte L Rev 377, 401 (2014). Not having standards or a\nspecialized protocol to deal with cognitively impaired parents creates a serious challenge for\ncourts and caseworkers given that, as in this case, “[s]ocial workers are apt to have little or no\ntraining or experience in teaching mentally retarded adults; worse, research indicates that many\nmay have no interest in the subject.” Hayman, Presumptions of Justice: Law, Politics, and the\nMentally Retarded Parent, 103 Harv L Rev 1202, 1224 (1990).\n\n        Several government and scholarly sources are helpful in defining the types of reasonable\naccommodations that nevertheless must be made. The focal point of any reasonable\naccommodation analysis must be whether the services were individualized. Persons with\nintellectual disabilities “are markedly diverse as a group.” Id. at 1213. Their conditions arise\nfrom different sources, they exhibit various symptoms, and they operate at varying levels of\ncompetence. Id. at 1213-1215. Accordingly, “[i]ndividuals with disabilities must be treated on a\ncase-by-case basis consistent with facts and objective evidence.” Protecting the Rights of\nParents and Prospective Parents with Disabilities, p 4. The bar for reunification need not be\nlowered; rather “services must be adapted to meet the needs of a parent . . . who has a disability\nto provide meaningful and equal access to the benefit.” Id. at 5.\n\n        Another common theme is that of interdependence, rather than forcing a parent to\ndemonstrate the ability to independently parent a child. As noted in Presumptions of the Law,\n103 Harv L Rev at 1253, “The law’s insistence that the mentally retarded parent be measured\n‘standing alone’ . . . fails to take seriously the social experience of many mentally retarded\npersons.” Those with intellectual disabilities are often socialized to depend on family, peers, and\n\n\n11\n     The     February      1, 2014 version  of   this  section   is  available at\n<http://dhhs.michigan.gov/OLMWEB/EX/FO/Public/FOM/722-06.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks>\n(accessed April 18, 2016).\n12\n      The     May     1,   2015     version of  this  section                  is     available  at\n<http://dhhs.michigan.gov/OLMWEB/EX/FO/Public/FOM/722-06F.pdf#                           pagemode=\nbookmarks> (accessed April 18, 2016).\n\n\n                                                -11-\n\fservice providers to achieve maximum success. Id. at 1253-1254; Fit Through Unfairness, 5\nCharlotte L Rev at 387-388. In this vein, “[s]uccessful intervention strategies for mentally\nretarded parents might include foster placements of both parent and child, group homes,\ntemporary live-in training programs, and parent-child daycare centers.” Presumptions of the\nLaw, 103 Harv L Rev at 1256.\n\n        Experts also recommend the use of agencies and service providers experienced in dealing\nwith persons with intellectual disabilities. Specialized agencies provide complete life training\nservices, the benefits of which spill over into the child protective proceedings. Accordingly, the\nDHHS could coordinate reunification services with such providers. Protecting the Rights of\nParents and Prospective Parents with Disabilities, pp 15-16; Watkins, Beyond Status: The\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and the Parental Rights of People Labeled Developmentally\nDisabled or Mentally Retarded, 83 Cal L Rev 1415, 1474 (1995). Specially trained personnel\navailable at these agencies understand that goals must be defined “in terms of concrete tasks”\nthat are easier to “comprehend and master.” Presumptions of the Law, 103 Harv L Rev at 1234.\nThey recognize that instructions must be simplified, and that visual aids, “repetition, routine, and\nfeedback” are vital. Kerr, The Application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to the\nTermination of the Parental Rights of Individuals with Mental Disabilities, 16 J of Contemp\nHealth L & Pol’y 387, 424-425 (2000). The education and experience of the workers will also\nlimit the extent to which parents with an intellectual disability are “judged against conventional\nnorms for behavior.” Presumptions of the Law, 103 Harv L Rev at 1228. As noted by Hayman,\nfor the untrained, “inarticulateness is perceived as stubbornness or stupidity; shyness or\nuncertainty, as indifference; and fear and insecurity, as aggression.” Id.\n\n        The concept of giving disabled parents additional time to benefit from services is also of\nimport. State and federal law generally requires the responsible agency to seek termination of a\nparent’s rights if the child has been in foster care for 15 out of the previous 22 months. MCL\n712A.19a(6); 42 USC 675(5)(E); 45 CFR 1356.21(i). Under Michigan law, the state may delay\nin filing a termination petition when “[c]ompelling reasons” exist or when the DHHS has not\nprovided the family “with the services the state considers necessary.” MCL 712A.19a(b)(b), (c).\nThese “time lines are often challenging—if not impossible—to comply with” for parents with\ncertain disabilities. Rocking the Cradle, p 103. Parents with intellectual disabilities require the\nopportunity to make “steady but slow progress.” Id. Using the exceptions in the federal and\nstate statutes supports the needs of the parent without compromising the needs of the child.\nProtecting the Rights of Parents and Prospective Parents with Disabilities, p 14.\n\n        Michigan caselaw is sparse regarding the level of services necessary to reasonably\naccommodate a disabled parent. In re Newman, 189 Mich App 61; 472 NW2d 38 (1991),\nexemplifies our cases involving the absence of reasonable efforts. There, the children were\ntaken into care based on unsafe and filthy conditions in the home. Id. at 63. The state assigned\nan aide to assist the cognitively impaired mother in learning how to maintain a clean home. Id.\nat 66. The DHHS’s predecessor knew when the aide was assigned that the mother “because of\nher limited intellectual capacity, need[ed] hands-on instruction, most probably repeatedly.” Id.\nThe aide purchased cleaning supplies for the mother but “stopped going into the house because it\nwas so dirty.” Id. As noted by this Court:\n\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\f       This was the person who was supposed to help respondents remedy this problem,\n       but she refused. How then can we say there is no reasonable likelihood that the\n       conditions in the home would not be rectified within a reasonable time when the\n       one person who could have helped respondents remedy the conditions refused to\n       do so? [Id.]\n\n        In re Boursaw, 239 Mich App 161; 607 NW2d 408 (1999), concerned a mother suffering\nfrom mental illness. She was provided intensive mental health services throughout the\nproceedings and her therapist opined that with additional time, she might be able to safely parent\nher child. This Court found the lower court’s termination decision “premature” as the evidence\nsupported that the mother may be able to parent her child within a reasonable time. Id. at 177.\nBoursaw implies that psychiatric treatment may require time beyond the normal statutory limits\nof a child protective proceeding and that a parent’s rights cannot be arbitrarily terminated at the\nend of a set period.\n\n        Terry, 240 Mich App at 16, involved a “developmentally disabled” mother. The mother\nsought out services from “the Developmental Disabilities program at Genesee County\nCommunity Mental Health,” which coordinated its services with those provided in the child\nprotective proceedings. Id. at 17. As in this case, the respondent experienced difficulty “in\nfollowing through with tasks such as finding housing.” Id. She lacked positive parenting role\nmodels as she had been abused as a child. Id. The respondent’s therapist believed she could\nattain “basic parenting skills” with “an additional two to three years” of training, “but that she\nwould always need assistance during difficult or stressful periods.” Id. The caseworker opined\nthat the “[r]espondent needed someone to live with her, not just oversee her progress.” Id. at 18-\n19. Unfortunately, the respondent had no friends or family who could provide that support. Id.\nat 19.\n\n       Although this Court deemed waived the respondent’s challenge to the level of services\nprovided in Terry, id. at 27, the panel noted that it would have rejected her claims in any event.\n\n       It is undisputed that respondent was provided with extensive services, and there is\n       no evidence that she was denied any services that are available to parents with\n       greater cognitive abilities. The caseworkers were aware of respondent’s\n       intellectual limitations and would repeat instructions multiple times and remind\n       her when tasks had to be completed. Respondent received assistance through\n       GCCMH to address both personal and parenting problems in a program that was\n       tailored to developmentally disabled persons. An arrangement under which\n       respondent lived in the children’s foster home was attempted but proved\n       unsuccessful. Petitioner had no other services available that would address\n       respondent’s deficiencies while allowing her to keep her children. The ADA does\n       not require petitioner to provide respondent with full-time, live-in assistance with\n       her children. See Bartell v Lohiser, 12 F Supp 2d 640, 650 (ED Mich, 1998). [Id.\n       at 27-28.]\n\n\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\f       A handful of unpublished opinions of this Court have also addressed whether reasonable\naccommodations were made in providing services to a disabled parent.13 In In re Rice,\nunpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 12, 2013 (Docket No.\n315766), unpub op at 2, this Court found reasonable accommodations where a psychologist\nevaluated the respondent and recommended tailored services, each service provider was notified\nregarding the respondent’s special needs, and the providers expressly indicated that they\nmodified their services for the respondent, with “methods such as repetition and role modeling.”\n\n        This Court also found that reasonable accommodations were made in In re Ali-Maliki,\nunpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 19, 2015 (Docket No.\n321420). In that case, the DHHS provided services to the cognitively impaired mother for more\nthan four years. Id., unpub op at 2-3. These services included “individual therapy, parenting\nclasses, two evaluations at the Clinic for Child Studies, two psychological evaluations, a\npsychiatric evaluation, supervised visitations, family therapy, Wraparound services, a parenting\ncoach, and a parent partner. She also received services from an infant mental health specialist.”\nId., unpub op at 3. The respondent was given the opportunity to parent her children while living\nwith her parents who provided assistance, but even that proved too much. Id., unpub op at 1.\nThis Court ultimately agreed with the circuit court’s assessment that reasonable efforts had been\nmade, but that “the evidence amply demonstrates that respondent’s limited cognitive abilities\ncould not be accommodated to the degree necessary to enable her to parent the five children, four\nof whom have severe special needs.” Id., unpub op at 4.\n\n        In In re White, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 29,\n2012 (Docket No. 305411), unpub op at 2, the developmentally disabled and cognitively\nimpaired mother ceded custody of her children to CPS in part “because she was overwhelmed.”\nThe record demonstrated that the respondent starting receiving services “long before the children\nwere removed.” Id., unpub op at 4. And during the proceedings, the DHHS “provided\nrespondent with family-reunification services to correct her parenting skills and coping deficits;\nshe received psychological evaluations, parent-child bond evaluations, in-home parent classes,\nin-home parent coaching from an infant mental-health specialist, in-home community-living\nsupport services for home management, and supervised parenting time.” Id., unpub op at 2-3.\nThese services were modified to accommodate the respondent’s special needs. “She received\nhands-on demonstrations and proctoring that were consistent with the evaluating psychologist’s\nrecommendations.” Id., unpub op at 4. As the respondent had not benefitted from the extended,\nintensive services, this Court affirmed the circuit court’s termination decision.\n\n        In another case, however, this Court found termination supported when “it became\napparent that there were no services available that could help respondent-appellant parent his\nchildren because he was not capable of attaining the requisite level of parenting skills needed to\nparent the children.” In re Pomaville, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals,\n\n\n\n13\n   Unpublished Court of Appeals opinions are not binding, but may be considered persuasive or\ninstructive. Paris Meadows, LLC v City of Kentwood, 287 Mich App 136, 145 n 3; 783 NW2d\n133 (2010).\n\n\n                                              -14-\n\fissued January 13, 2004 (Docket No. 247168), unpub op at 2. The respondent-father in that case\nwas categorized as “developmentally delayed,” had an IQ of 54, and could not read. Id. The\nstate “accounted for and reasonably accommodated respondent-appellant’s disability in its efforts\nto reunify the family by locating parenting classes to accommodate his reading disability,\nattempting to locate services that would enable respondent to parent his children and referring\nhim to two doctors to evaluate his ability to parent with his disability.” Id. Where the parent\ncannot benefit even from modified services, however, termination is in the best interests of the\nchildren, this Court determined. Id.\n\n        Michigan jurisprudence has thereby recognized that reasonable accommodations must be\ntailored to the individual, to meaningfully that person in benefitting from services. Our courts\nhave implied that a cognitively impaired parent could maintain custody of his or her child even if\nhe or she requires assistance from a family member to safely care for the child but has not gone\nso far as to require the DHHS to consider an assistive housing arrangement such as parenting in a\ngroup home or a parent-child foster placement. This Court has recognized the benefit of the\nDHHS coordinating child protective services with organizations that serve the disabled\ncommunity. And this Court has cited with approval lower court decisions to delay the initiation\nof termination proceedings when a disabled parent requires additional time to benefit from\nservices because of their disability.\n\n        Given the dearth of Michigan caselaw on point, we also reviewed the jurisprudence of\nour sister states. We found instructive to our current analysis In re Victoria M, 207 Cal App 3d\n1317; 255 Cal Rptr 498 (1989). The respondent-mother in that matter had an IQ of 72, placing\nher “in the borderline range of intelligence.” Id. at 1321-1322. She had taken special education\nclasses as a child and as an adult, “used social services agencies in the community extensively.”\nId. The county department of social services (DSS) took the mother’s three children into care\nbecause the family was chronically homeless and the children were underfed, filthy, and infested\nwith lice. Id. at 1322. Despite that the mother had “obvious handicaps,” id. at 1328, and that the\nDSS had intervened with the family in the past, id. at 1327, the DSS waited 16 months to provide\npsychological testing to assess the mother’s level of intellectual functioning. Id. at 1324. In the\nmeantime, the mother was referred for generalized services and those providers questioned\nwhether the mother could benefit given her obvious limitations. Id. at 1323-1324. The DSS was\naware that specialized services for the developmentally disabled were available; it referred the\nmother’s son for such services at Valley Mountain Regional Center (VMRC). Id. at 1323-1324\nand n 4. The mother eventually secured services for herself through VMRC, but the DSS failed\nto monitor her progress or coordinate with the agency. Id. at 1324, 1330. Of great concern, the\nDSS also provided little to no assistance in the very areas that brought the children into care.\nHer parenting class coordinator failed to address “health and hygiene concerns” with mother,\nincorrectly believing that she understood these concepts. Id. at 1328. And despite mother’s\nhomelessness and extremely low income, the caseworker simply directed her to a local housing\nauthority and told her to read the newspaper to find housing. Id.\n\n       The California Court of Appeals found “[t]he record . . . clear that no accommodation\nwas made for [the mother’s] special needs in providing reunification services.” Id. at 1329. The\ncourt continued that the mother “obviously is developmentally disabled” and “[h]er disability\nshould have been apparent to those assessing the suitability of services offered to her.” Id. The\ncaseworker had already referred one of the children to VMRC, a “[r]egional center[] . . .\n\n                                               -15-\n\fspecifically designed to provide services to persons such as” the mother, but took no steps to\nsecure similar assistance for her. Id. at 1329-1330. Given the insufficiency of the services\nprovided, termination could not be supported by clear and convincing evidence on the ground\nthat the mother had not benefitted from services. Id. We find In re Victoria M virtually\nindistinguishable from the case at bar, and adopt its reasoning.\n\n        Drawing from the caselaw, federal and state law and regulations, and the plethora of\nexpert opinions on the topic, we take this opportunity to clarify what a court and the DHHS must\ndo when faced with a parent with a known or suspected intellectual, cognitive, or developmental\nimpairment. In such situations, neither the court nor the DHHS may sit back and wait for the\nparent to assert his or her right to reasonable accommodations. Rather, the DHHS must offer\nevaluations to determine the nature and extent of the parent’s disability and to secure\nrecommendations for tailoring necessary reunification services to the individual. The DHHS\nmust then endeavor to locate agencies that can provide services geared toward assisting the\nparent to overcome obstacles to reunification. If no local agency catering to the needs of such\nindividuals exists, the DHHS must ensure that the available service providers modify or adjust\ntheir programs to allow the parent an opportunity to benefit equal to that of a nondisabled parent.\nIf it becomes clear that the parent will only be able to safely care for his or her children in a\nsupportive environment, the DHHS must search for potential relatives or friends willing and able\nto provide a home for all. And if the DHHS shirks these duties, the circuit court must order\ncompliance. Moreover, consistent with MCL 712A.19a(6), if there is a delay in providing the\nparent reasonably accommodated services or if the evidence supports that the parent could safely\ncare for his or her children within a reasonable time given a reasonable extension of the services\nperiod, the court would not be required to order the filing of a termination period merely because\nthe child has been in foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months.\n\n        We emphasize that these requirements are not intended to stymie child protective\nproceedings to the detriment of the children involved. However, “[t]he goal of reunification of\nthe family must not be lost in the laudable attempt to make sure that children are not languishing\nin foster care while termination proceedings drag on and on.” Boursaw, 239 Mich App at 176-\n177. In the event that reasonable accommodations are made but the parent fails to demonstrate\nsufficient benefit such that he or she can safely parent the child, then the court may proceed to\ntermination. See In re Frey, 297 Mich App 242, 248; 824 NW2d 569 (2012); In re Gazella, 264\nMich App 668, 676; 692 NW2d 708 (2005). If honest and careful evaluation reveals that no\nlevel or type of services could possibly remediate the parent to the point he or she could safely\ncare for the child, termination need not be unnecessarily delayed. Yet, such assessment may not\nbe based on stereotypes or assumptions or an unwillingness to make the required effort to\naccommodate the parent’s needs.\n\n                         V. APPLICATION TO THE CURRENT CASE\n\n        The DHHS did not fulfill its duties in this case, and the circuit court failed to adequately\nrecognize that shortcoming. The DHHS should have suspected (and likely knew) before the\nonset of these child protective proceedings that respondent is cognitively impaired. Houle,\nBaskerville, and Emerinini noted respondent’s disability upon first meeting her. Huckaby did\nnot describe respondent as cognitively impaired, but believed she at least suffered from mental\nillness. As respondent’s compromised intellectual abilities were readily apparent, the DHHS\n\n                                               -16-\n\fworkers involved in CB’s child protective proceedings were on notice by November 2011 that\nrespondent required assistance. And no worker involved in the current proceedings has denied\nthe obvious nature of respondent’s condition.\n\n        Instead of acting post haste to secure psychological and psychiatric evaluations to\ndetermine whether reasonably accommodated services were necessary or offered potential\nbenefit, the DHHS waited until May 2013—13 months after DH came into care—to secure these\nevaluations. In the meantime, the DHHS failed to make adequate efforts to provide respondent\nwith parenting time, effectively denying her contact with her daughter for eight months.\n\n        Further, the DHHS failed to reconsider respondent’s service plan after respondent was\npsychologically evaluated. The results of respondent’s psychological evaluation were grim,\nrevealing that respondent fell into the low and extremely low range on various assessments. She\ncould read but lacked comprehension of the material perused and could not write in complete\nsentences. Yet, the DHHS ordered respondent to earn a GED and find employment and housing,\nand never revisited these mechanically-generated requirements. The psychologist recommended\n“administer[ing] a measure of adaptive functioning to determine specific strengths and\nweaknesses with regard to activities of daily living.”14 This was never done. The result was that\nthe DHHS ordered respondent to climb mountains that she could not possibly surmount.\nSpecifically, respondent likely will never be able to read and comprehend the contents of a GED\nexam, hold down employment without an onsite mentor, or live independently. A service plan\nthat ignored these realities was simply unreasonable and not individually tailored to the parent’s\nneeds.\n\n        Following the evaluations, the DHHS failed to consider whether respondent required\nspecialized services for the cognitively impaired. The record establishes that several agencies\nprovide wrap-around services for the cognitively impaired in the metropolitan Detroit area.\nRespondent was even referred for generalized services at some of those agencies. Yet, the\nDHHS did not seek to have respondent placed in any of the programs geared toward the\ncognitively impaired until several months after Gilflix objected in August 2014. The DHHS then\ndelayed referring respondent for the proper type of services until the very eve of the termination\nhearing. Its employee made a half-hearted attempt to transfer respondent’s services to the\nagency respondent’s counsel recommended, failed to follow up in a timely manner, and\nultimately denied respondent the type of services she required for several months. Although\nHoule informed the regular service providers that respondent was cognitively impaired and\n\n\n\n14\n   “Adaptive functioning” is “the relative ability of a person to effectively interact with society\non all levels and care for one’s self; affected by one’s willingness to practice skills and pursue\nopportunities for improvement on all levels. Often used to describe levels of mental retardation.”\n<http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/adaptive+functioning> (accessed April 18,\n2016). “Tests of adaptive functioning evaluate the social and emotional maturity of a child,\nrelative to his or her peers. They also help to evaluate life skills and abilities.” Reynolds,\nZupanick, & Dombeck, Tests of Adaptive Functioning, <https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/\ntests-of-adaptive-functioning/> (accessed April 18, 2016).\n\n\n                                               -17-\n\frequired explicit and simple instruction, this was inadequate when more intensive services from\nspecialized agencies were readily available.\n\n        The record is also devoid of information regarding the content of the parenting classes,\njob training, and GED preparation courses in which respondent participated. The psychologist\nnoted that respondent required “in-session role-playing” to address concerns. Respondent also\nhad difficulty reading and comprehending written material. The DHHS presented no witnesses\nfrom any service provider to describe how material was presented to respondent. Accordingly,\nwe cannot know whether the limited accommodations recommended by the DHHS were even\nimplemented in practice. And while the caseworkers testified that respondent’s therapist\nprovided a higher level of hands-on services to assist respondent in meeting her goals, that\ntherapist was never presented to describe her role or respondent’s progress. The DHHS also\nfailed to present the parent partner who was apparently assigned to offer more in-depth\nassistance, and made no record of his particular services.\n\n        Certain evidence suggested that respondent may never achieve the ability to safely parent\nher children independently. As a result, the DHHS actively searched for a friend or family\nmember to take in both mother and children and provide assistance with childcare. Respondent’s\ngrandmother in Ohio offered the family a home, but only if respondent was solely responsible for\nthe children’s care. The DHHS deemed this an inappropriate placement. However, the record is\ndevoid of information regarding whether local services would be available to respondent in Ohio\nso that she could safely parent her children in her grandmother’s home with some outside\nassistance.\n\n        Ultimately, respondent may be unable to overcome the conditions that brought her\nchildren into care. We readily acknowledge that even with appropriate assistive services she\nmay be unable to safely parent her children. Investigation may reveal that no home is available\nto respondent where she may provide for her children without, or even with, outside assistance.\nGiven the inadequate reunification services provided thus far, however, any such conclusion is\npremature. Accordingly, we must vacate the termination decision and remand for the provision\nof services with reasonable accommodation made for respondent’s cognitive impairment.\n\n        We vacate the termination decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           /s/ Elizabeth L. Gleicher\n                                                           /s/ Mark J.

When respondent’s family\nsupport system fell apart, she relinquished custody of her two-month-old daughter to the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services (DHHS). Subsequently, the DHHS took\nrespondent’s newborn son into care. Although the child protective proceedings persisted for\nmore than three years and the DHHS was well aware of respondent’s special needs, the case\nservice plan never included reasonable accommodations to provide respondent a meaningful\nopportunity to benefit. Absent such accommodations, the DHHS failed in its statutory duty to\nmake reasonable efforts to reunify the family unit. And absent reasonable efforts, the DHHS\nlacked clear and convincing evidence to support the statutory grounds cited in the termination\npetition. We therefore vacate the circuit court’s order terminating respondent’s parental rights to\nher two minor children and remand for reconsideration following the provision of necessary\naccommodated services.\n\n                        I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        Psychological testing revealed that respondent has a Full Scale IQ of 70, placing her in\nthe second percentile and borderline range of intellectual functioning.             Her Verbal\nComprehension index is 66, within the extremely low range. Her scores related to perceptual\nreasoning, processing speed, and working memory are equally low. Caseworkers commented on\nthe overt appearance of respondent’s impairment upon meeting her, as well as noting her\ndifficulty in communicating on the telephone, her shyness and hesitancy, and her flat affect.\nChild Protective Services (CPS) had been intermittently involved in respondent’s life since she\nwas seven years old. Despite this early intervention and respondent’s obvious cognitive or\ndevelopmental impairments, she never received special education services as a child.\n\n       Respondent’s mother, CB, is also cognitively impaired. For many years, CB’s mother\nlived with CB and her four children to assist in running the household. Following the\n                                                -1-\n\fgrandmother’s death, the family’s wellbeing dramatically declined. In November 2011, CPS\nintervened and removed CB’s minor children from her care. At that time, respondent (by then an\nadult), her boyfriend (AH), and CB’s boyfriend, Steven Butler, a registered child sex offender,\nalso lived in the home. Respondent’s younger sister accused Butler of rape, but CB did not end\ntheir relationship.1 A CPS worker advised the pregnant respondent that she would be required to\nmake other living arrangements upon her child’s birth but provided no services or assistance to\nthe young, disabled mother.\n\n        Respondent’s daughter, DH, was born on January 29, 2012.2 CB subsequently threatened\nto evict respondent and the infant. On April 10, 2012, respondent appeared at the CPS office.\nShe told CPS worker Cordell Huckaby that she was about to be homeless and felt overwhelmed\nby trying to care for two-month-old DH on her own. Huckaby reported that respondent\n“displayed abnormal behavior that presented concerns that she may have some untreated mental\nhealth issues.” Huckaby spent more than four hours with respondent. With CB’s help, Huckaby\ncontacted various family members and friends to find housing for respondent and DH.\nRespondent’s grandmother in Cleveland, Ohio offered mother and baby a home, as did a local\nfamily friend. Respondent declined both placements, and the DHHS took DH into care on an\nemergency basis and placed her with a nonrelative.\n\n        The circuit court did not adjudicate respondent unfit for another ten months; respondent\nbore no fault for this dealy. In the meantime, due to a series of CPS and DHHS errors,\nrespondent was denied parenting time. Huckaby was the only official present at the initial child\nprotective hearings. He indicated that parenting time sessions had to be arranged through the\nDHHS caseworker. However, Huckaby was uncertain of the caseworker’s identity. When\nrespondent attempted to contact the DHHS to arrange visits, her messages received no follow up.\n\n        In late October 2012, the DHHS finally assigned a caseworker who appeared willing and\nable to assist respondent. Beth Houle initially had difficulty connecting with respondent, noting\nthat “she was extremely hard to understand when she left messages.” Houle arranged for\nsupervised parenting time sessions starting December 12, 2012.\n\n        An adjudication trial was finally conducted on January 28, 2013, and Houle created an\n“Updated Service Plan” for respondent. This plan was actually the first service plan provided.\nDespite that DH had been in care for 10 months and CPS had been involved with respondent\nsince November 2011, no services had yet been offered. Under the January 2013 case service\nplan, respondent was required to undergo a psychological evaluation, participate in therapy and\nparenting classes, visit the child for three hours each week, earn her GED, and find employment\nand a home. Respondent, pregnant with her second child, was then bouncing between the homes\nof various relatives.\n\n\n1\n In the proceedings related to CB’s parental rights, respondent asserted that Butler had raped her\nwhen she was 18 years old.\n2\n  Shortly after DH’s birth, a protective order was entered precluding AH’s contact with his\ndaughter, leaving respondent to care for the child alone.\n\n\n                                               -2-\n\f        Respondent gave birth to her son, EB, on February 7, 2013. An aunt offered to give\nrespondent and the baby a home but the DHHS deemed the placement inappropriate.\nAccordingly, the DHHS immediately took EB into care and placed him with his sister. At the\npreliminary hearing regarding EB’s placement, a CPS worker, Jacqueline Baskerville,\nacknowledged that respondent has “emotional . . . and cognitive . . . issues - - impairments.” The\nFebruary 13, 2013 petition to take EB into care recited, “According to Hutzel Hospital social\nworker Vernice Muldrew, [respondent] was given a psychiatric evaluation and it was determined\nthat she should reside in an adult foster care home as she will need assistance with her daily\ncare.”\n\n        Despite the recommendation that respondent be placed in adult foster care, she found\nherself living in a homeless shelter upon her hospital release. During a February 19, 2013\ninterview with DHHS work Joseph Emerinini, respondent expressed confusion as to why her\nchildren were in care, apparently forgetting that she had requested DH’s placement. Emerinini\nelaborated:\n\n       [Respondent] appears to have some intellectual impairments. [Respondent] has\n       difficulties in making decisions . . . . When leaving voice messages she is hard to\n       understand, slurring words and during one message appeared to be coaxed by\n       someone on what to say. [Respondent] only has completion of 9th grade\n       education and has a hard time understanding simple tasks. [Respondent] . . . was\n       not able to write in complete sentences.\n\nWhile respondent could read to some extent, Emerinini described her comprehension level as\nlow.\n\n       Case notes throughout the report also revealed Houle’s concerns about respondent’s\ncapacity and abilities. On February 26, 2013, Houle informed respondent’s therapist, Shelita\nRichmond, that respondent “is in need of guidance and understanding of how to be independent\nand self sufficient[.]” Houle described respondent as “quiet” and as needing specific direction\nbecause she would not do anything beyond the instructions given. Houle advised the parenting\nclass coordinator that respondent “appears to have some cognitive delays and does not\nunderstand some things presented to her, and things need to be explained to her in simple terms.”\n\n       The circuit court judge assigned to the matter also seemed to recognize respondent’s\nimpairment given the manner in which he spoke to respondent on the record. For example, at the\nadjudication trial in relation to EB, the court instructed:\n\n       [Respondent], you need to speak up as if you’re mad at me so this nice young\n       lady in front of me can prepare a transcript; okay?\n\n               And oh, by the way, I only eat attorneys; okay?\n\n                                             * * *\n\n              I’m going to ask you to do something that’s really very rude. Your\n       attorney is going to ask you questions. Could you answer them facing this nice\n       young lady in front of me so she can prepare a good transcript of this.\n\n                                               -3-\n\fThe only time that respondent said anything beyond “yes” or “no” at any proceeding was at that\ntrial. An attorney asked respondent whether she suffered from depression and she indicated,\n“When I get around people I be mad.”\n\n       Respondent was not evaluated by a psychologist and psychiatrist for the purposes of the\ncase service plan until May 2013. Before that time, and without benefit of the knowledge of\nrespondent’s cognitive abilities, the DHHS referred her for parenting classes and therapy. The\nagency also referred respondent to Focus Hope for GED preparation classes and employment\nand job skills training, with no concept of whether she could benefit from those services. Houle\ndid note that the initiation of the various services had to be staggered because “[i]t appears that\ntoo much given to [respondent] at a time is overwhelming for her.” Houle also secured the\nappointment of a “parent partner” for respondent. However, that individual never testified at any\nhearing and the record is devoid of information regarding any assistance that person may have\nprovided.\n\n        As noted, testing revealed that respondent had “low cognitive functioning.” The\npsychologist reported that respondent’s scores and lack of “insight” revealed that “she may be\nlimited in her ability to independently manage more complex activities of daily living.” The\npsychologist recommended “behavioral therapy that utilizes in-session role-playing to address\nconcerns.” The psychologist further opined, “It may be beneficial to administer a measure of\nadaptive functioning to determine specific strengths and weaknesses with regard to activities of\ndaily living.” Neither recommendation was ever implemented.\n\n       Instead, for the next two years, the DHHS continued to provide services geared toward a\nparent of average cognitive functioning.3 Richmond provided more hands-on assistance during\ntherapy sessions. She actively worked with respondent in her search for employment, Section 8\nhousing, and Social Security Disability (SSD) income. None of these attempts were fruitful.\nHoule was sensitive to respondent’s needs, but did not seek out specialized wrap-around services\ndesigned to assist the cognitively impaired.\n\n       The DHHS continued to search for an appropriate relative who could provide housing\nand parenting assistance to respondent. She moved in with her uncle, his girlfriend, and their\nchildren in May 2013, and remained in their home for nearly the entirety of the proceedings.\nAlthough respondent’s uncle was willing to provide additional assistance to respondent, he was\nnot willing to have the children placed in his home. Respondent’s grandmother in Cleveland,\nOhio indicated that respondent and the children could be placed with her. However, given her\nadvanced age, the grandmother asserted that respondent would be entirely responsible for the\nchildren’s care. The DHHS found respondent ill-equipped to handle that responsibility.\n\n       The DHHS eventually transitioned respondent’s services to Michigan Rehabilitation\nCenter, Northeast Guidance Center, and then Care Link. Although these agencies provide in-\n\n\n3\n Counsel for the DHHS had no objection to extending the case beyond the traditional 15 month\nperiod, acknowledging that respondent required additional time to benefit from services given\nher cognitive impairment.\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fdepth services to the cognitively impaired, respondent was not referred for that type of\nassistance. Instead, respondent merely continued in parenting classes and therapy through these\nproviders. In the summer of 2014, Yasmin Gibson replaced Houle as the caseworker assigned to\nthe case. After that assignment, respondent’s prospects quickly went downhill. Even two\nmonths after her assignment, Gibson knew very little about the status of respondent’s case.\nGibson did not understand the level of respondent’s impairment and had made no follow-up with\nrespondent’s service providers. She also abruptly discontinued assisting respondent in her bid to\nsecure Section 8 housing and SSD income.\n\n        Given the change in DHHS personnel, respondent’s attorney, Julie Gilflix, took a more\nproactive role. She requested that the DHHS transfer respondent’s services to the Neighborhood\nServices Organization (NSO), which would provide intensive services even beyond the child\nprotective proceedings. NSO secures employment opportunities for the cognitively impaired, as\nwell as assistance in “supportive housing,” educational support, and parenting classes.4 Gilflix\nexpressed concern that the DHHS had not provided her client “intense services” and was “not\nworking with her individually” or “looking at her individual needs.” Gilflix was dismayed that\nGibson assumed respondent could independently find a job when she “need[ed] assistance in\nreading” and completing the necessary applications. The circuit court dismissed Gilflix’s\nconcerns, stating “I really don’t think workers should be in the business of taking parents by the\nhand.”\n\n        At a November 7, 2014 hearing, Gibson finally indicated that she was investigating the\npossibility of transferring respondent’s services to NSO. For the next six months, Gibson made\nexcuses and blamed the agencies for providing inaccurate information on how to secure the\nproper type of services for respondent. Finally, at a May 30, 2015 hearing, after which the\ncircuit court ordered the DHHS to file a termination petition, Gibson reported that NSO denied\nrespondent’s application for services because the agencies that had been providing services\nthroughout the proceedings could have been providing intensive wrap-around services for the\ncognitively impaired all along. Apparently neither Gibson nor Houle had ever investigated that\npossibility or referred respondent for the correct type of services.\n\n        On June 18, 2015, more than three years after DH had been taken into care, and despite\nthat the DHHS had never secured services geared toward assisting a cognitively impaired parent,\nthe DHHS filed a supplemental petition seeking termination. The petition cited that respondent\nhad never taken her GED or secured housing or income. The DHHS continued that respondent\nhad not benefited from services to the point she could safely parent her children.\n\n       Gibson was the only witness at the termination hearing. The DHHS did not call any\nservice providers or respondent’s therapist. The department presented absolutely no evidence,\nbeyond Gibson’s assertions, regarding whether specialized services would have assisted\nrespondent in safely parenting her children. By the time of the termination hearing, respondent\nhad moved in with her grandmother in Cleveland. Accordingly, Gibson opined that further\n\n\n4\n See Neighborhood Service Organization, <http://www.nso-mi.org/index.php> accessed April\n18, 2016).\n\n\n                                               -5-\n\fservices would be impossible. In closing argument, Gilflix challenged Gibson’s claims, noting\nthat “reasonable efforts have not been made” and that respondent’s residence in Cleveland was\nnot permanent. Despite these pleas, the circuit court terminated respondent’s parental rights\nunder MCL 712A.19b(3)(c)(i) (grounds leading to adjudication have not been remedied and\ncannot be remedied within a reasonable time) and (g) (failure to provide proper care and\ncustody).\n\n                                   II.

In\nMichigan, a court may terminate a person’s parental rights when clear and convincing evidence\nsupports at least one ground elucidated in MCL 712A.19b(3).

In other words, if the FIA fails to take into account\n       the parents’ limitations or disabilities and make any reasonable accommodations,\n       then it cannot be found that reasonable efforts were made to reunite the family.\n       [Emphasis added.]\n\n       The federal Departments of Health and Human Services and Justice have described,\n“Two principles that are fundamental to Title II of the ADA and Section 504 are: (1)\nindividualized treatment; and (2) full and equal opportunity.” Protecting the Rights of Parents\nand Prospective Parents with Disabilities, p 4. In this vein, 28 CFR 35.130(b) provides:\n\n       (1) A public entity, in providing any aid, benefit, or service, may not, directly or\n       through contractual, licensing, or other arrangements, on the basis of disability --\n\n               (i) Deny a qualified individual with a disability the opportunity to\n       participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service;\n\n               (ii) Afford a qualified individual with a disability an opportunity to\n       participate in or benefit from the aid, benefit, or service that is not equal to that\n       afforded others;\n\n                (iii) Provide a qualified individual with a disability with an aid, benefit, or\n       service that is not as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same\n       result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement as that\n       provided to others;\n\n               (iv) Provide different or separate aids, benefits, or services to individuals\n       with disabilities or to any class of individuals with disabilities than is provided to\n       others unless such action is necessary to provide qualified individuals with\n       disabilities with aids, benefits, or services that are as effective as those provided\n       to others;\n\n                                               * * *\n\n       (2) A public entity may not deny a qualified individual with a disability the\n       opportunity to participate in services, programs, or activities that are not separate\n       or different, despite the existence of permissibly separate or different programs or\n       activities.\n\n                                               * * *\n\n       (7) A public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or\n       procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the\n       basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the\n       modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or\n       activity.\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f45 CFR 84.4 provides substantively identical protection to “qualified handicapped” individuals.\n\n       Taken together, [the various provisions of 28 CFR 35.130(b), and by extension 45\n       CFR 84.4,] are intended to prohibit exclusion and segregation of individuals with\n       disabilities and the denial of equal opportunities enjoyed by others, based on,\n       among other things, presumptions, patronizing attitudes, fears, and stereotypes\n       about individuals with disabilities.

PRESERVATION\n\n       Before we reach the substance of this case, we must resolve whether respondent\npreserved her challenge to the level of services provided.\n\n       As discussed in Terry, 240 Mich App at 26:\n\n               Any claim that the FIA is violating the ADA must be raised in a timely\n       manner . . . so that any reasonable accommodations can be made. Accordingly, if\n       a parent believes that the FIA is unreasonably refusing to accommodate a\n       disability, the parent should claim a violation of her rights under the ADA, either\n       when a service plan is adopted or soon afterward. The court may then address the\n       parent’s claim under the ADA. Where a disabled person fails to make a timely\n       claim that the services provided are inadequate to her particular needs, she may\n       not argue that petitioner failed to comply with the ADA at a dispositional hearing\n       regarding whether to terminate her parental rights. In such a case, her sole remedy\n       is to commence a separate action for discrimination under the ADA. At the\n       dispositional hearing, the family court’s task is to determine, as a question of fact,\n       whether petitioner made reasonable efforts to reunite the family, without\n       reference to the ADA.5\n\n       _________________________________________________________________\n\n       5 Any claim that the parent’s rights under the ADA were violated must be raised\n       well before a dispositional hearing regarding whether to terminate her parental\n       rights, and the failure to timely raise the issue constitutes a waiver. The focus at\n       the dispositional hearing must be on the parent’s rights to the child and the best\n       interests of the child under the Juvenile Code, and the parties and the court should\n       not allow themselves to be distracted by arguments regarding the parent’s rights\n       under the ADA. Given that the court must consider whether reasonable efforts\n       were made to reunite the family, precluding specific reference to the ADA at the\n       dispositional hearing is not likely to make any difference in terms of the outcome.\n       [Emphasis added.]\n\n       __________________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\f       Gilflix did not raise an ADA challenge at the time the case service plan was adopted.\nNeither did she wait until the termination hearing. On January 15, 2014, Gilflix inquired\nwhether the DHHS could provide “one-on-one parenting help” for respondent and caseworker\nHoule promised to investigate this option. Gilflix specifically expressed concern that the DHHS\nwas not providing the type of services necessary to accommodate her client’s disability on\nAugust 13, 2014, and continuously repeated her concerns thereafter. Gilflix requested that\nrespondent receive specialized services for the developmentally disabled, the court ordered such\nservices, and caseworker Gibson engaged in a series of errors ensuring that the services were\nnever provided. The DHHS did not file its supplemental petition seeking termination until 10\nmonths after Gilflix’s specific request for ADA-compliant services. The termination hearing\ntook place on July 27, 2015, nearly a year after Gilflix first expressed her concern. Given the\nlength of time between Gilflix’s objection and the termination proceedings, respondent’s\nchallenges are not waived under Terry.9\n\n        We note, however, that experts have challenged the legitimacy of requiring parents to\nraise an ADA defense so long before the termination hearing. “[F]amily court cases do not\nalways proceed . . . smoothly,” and the need to file an objection may not be apparent until later in\nthe proceedings. Cecka, No Chance to Prove Themselves: The Rights of Mentally Disabled\nParents Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and State Law, 15 Va J Soc Pol’y & L 112,\n126 (2007). The court might order reasonable accommodation in services, but the DHHS’s\nfailure to provide such accommodations may not immediately leap to counsel’s attention. Id. at\n128. Moreover, the introduction of waiver principles is misplaced because a parent who raises\nsuch an objection “is not attempting to litigate the violation in family court;” rather, the parent is\nchallenging the evidentiary support for the termination. Id. at 125.\n\n                           IV. REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS\n\n        We now turn to the question of how reasonable accommodations are made in child\nprotective proceedings. The DHHS directs that its workers “must recognize the individuality of\nall clients and their needs, as well as the extent of their capacities for self-determination” and\n“tailor[]” services “to meet each client’s needs and to recognize the unique aspects of each case.”\nServices General Requirements Manual, SRM 101, p 2.10 The DHHS gives its workers\n“examples of reasonable efforts,” including emergency caretakers, daycare and homemaker\nservices, counseling, emergency shelter and financial assistance, parenting classes, self-help\ngroups, mental health and substance abuse services, “home-based family services,” and\n\n\n\n\n9\n  Respondent also argues that her trial counsel was ineffective in failing to raise her ADA\nchallenge earlier in the proceedings. As we conclude that counsel did not waive review of this\nissue, we need not consider this claim.\n10\n     The    February       1, 2013 version  of    this  section  is   available at\n<http://www.mfia.state.mi.us/OLMWEB/EX/SR/Public/SRM/101.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks>\n(accessed April 18, 2016).\n\n\n                                                -10-\n\fvocational training. Children’s Foster Care Manual, FOM 722-06, pp 10-11.11 The DHHS\nacknowledges, “It is only when timely and intensive services are provided to families that\nagencies and courts can make informed decisions about a parent’s ability to protect and care for\nhis/her children.” Id. at 15. The lack of investigation and services leaves “a ‘hole’ in the\nevidence” upon which the circuit court must base its ultimate decision. In re Rood, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">483</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich.</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n127; 763 NW2d 587 (2009) (YOUNG, J.).\n\n        The Children’s Foster Care Manual’s section on “special accommodations” makes no\nspecific mention of how to assist mentally, developmentally, or cognitively disabled parents,\ngiving individualized attention only to accommodations for the deaf and non-English speakers.\nFOM 722-06F.12 Nationwide, “[l]ittle focus has been directed at providing parenting support\nand services as part of general support for people with intellectual disabilities . . . .” Rocking the\nCradle, p 263. In “most jurisdictions,” reunification services “often do not address the parent’s\ndisability fully.” Smith, Fit Through Unfairness: The Termination of Parental Rights Due to a\nParent’s Mental Challenges, 5 Charlotte L Rev 377, 401 (2014). Not having standards or a\nspecialized protocol to deal with cognitively impaired parents creates a serious challenge for\ncourts and caseworkers given that, as in this case, “[s]ocial workers are apt to have little or no\ntraining or experience in teaching mentally retarded adults; worse, research indicates that many\nmay have no interest in the subject.” Hayman, Presumptions of Justice: Law, Politics, and the\nMentally Retarded Parent, 103 Harv L Rev 1202, 1224 (1990).\n\n        Several government and scholarly sources are helpful in defining the types of reasonable\naccommodations that nevertheless must be made. The focal point of any reasonable\naccommodation analysis must be whether the services were individualized. Persons with\nintellectual disabilities “are markedly diverse as a group.” Id. at 1213. Their conditions arise\nfrom different sources, they exhibit various symptoms, and they operate at varying levels of\ncompetence. Id. at 1213-1215. Accordingly, “[i]ndividuals with disabilities must be treated on a\ncase-by-case basis consistent with facts and objective evidence.” Protecting the Rights of\nParents and Prospective Parents with Disabilities, p 4. The bar for reunification need not be\nlowered; rather “services must be adapted to meet the needs of a parent . . . who has a disability\nto provide meaningful and equal access to the benefit.” Id. at 5.\n\n        Another common theme is that of interdependence, rather than forcing a parent to\ndemonstrate the ability to independently parent a child. As noted in Presumptions of the Law,\n103 Harv L Rev at 1253, “The law’s insistence that the mentally retarded parent be measured\n‘standing alone’ . . . fails to take seriously the social experience of many mentally retarded\npersons.” Those with intellectual disabilities are often socialized to depend on family, peers, and\n\n\n11\n     The     February      1, 2014 version  of   this  section   is  available at\n<http://dhhs.michigan.gov/OLMWEB/EX/FO/Public/FOM/722-06.pdf#pagemode=bookmarks>\n(accessed April 18, 2016).\n12\n      The     May     1,   2015     version of  this  section                  is     available  at\n<http://dhhs.michigan.gov/OLMWEB/EX/FO/Public/FOM/722-06F.pdf#                           pagemode=\nbookmarks> (accessed April 18, 2016).\n\n\n                                                -11-\n\fservice providers to achieve maximum success.

In this vein, “[s]uccessful intervention strategies for mentally\nretarded parents might include foster placements of both parent and child, group homes,\ntemporary live-in training programs, and parent-child daycare centers.” Presumptions of the\nLaw, 103 Harv L Rev at 1256.\n\n        Experts also recommend the use of agencies and service providers experienced in dealing\nwith persons with intellectual disabilities. Specialized agencies provide complete life training\nservices, the benefits of which spill over into the child protective proceedings. Accordingly, the\nDHHS could coordinate reunification services with such providers. Protecting the Rights of\nParents and Prospective Parents with Disabilities, pp 15-16; Watkins, Beyond Status: The\nAmericans with Disabilities Act and the Parental Rights of People Labeled Developmentally\nDisabled or Mentally Retarded, 83 Cal L Rev 1415, 1474 (1995). Specially trained personnel\navailable at these agencies understand that goals must be defined “in terms of concrete tasks”\nthat are easier to “comprehend and master.” Presumptions of the Law, 103 Harv L Rev at 1234.\nThey recognize that instructions must be simplified, and that visual aids, “repetition, routine, and\nfeedback” are vital. Kerr, The Application of the Americans with Disabilities Act to the\nTermination of the Parental Rights of Individuals with Mental Disabilities, 16 J of Contemp\nHealth L & Pol’y 387, 424-425 (2000). The education and experience of the workers will also\nlimit the extent to which parents with an intellectual disability are “judged against conventional\nnorms for behavior.” Presumptions of the Law, 103 Harv L Rev at 1228. As noted by Hayman,\nfor the untrained, “inarticulateness is perceived as stubbornness or stupidity; shyness or\nuncertainty, as indifference; and fear and insecurity, as aggression.” Id.\n\n        The concept of giving disabled parents additional time to benefit from services is also of\nimport. State and federal law generally requires the responsible agency to seek termination of a\nparent’s rights if the child has been in foster care for 15 out of the previous 22 months. MCL\n712A.19a(6); 42 USC 675(5)(E); 45 CFR 1356.21(i). Under Michigan law, the state may delay\nin filing a termination petition when “[c]ompelling reasons” exist or when the DHHS has not\nprovided the family “with the services the state considers necessary.” MCL 712A.19a(b)(b), (c).\nThese “time lines are often challenging—if not impossible—to comply with” for parents with\ncertain disabilities. Rocking the Cradle, p 103. Parents with intellectual disabilities require the\nopportunity to make “steady but slow progress.” Id. Using the exceptions in the federal and\nstate statutes supports the needs of the parent without compromising the needs of the child.\nProtecting the Rights of Parents and Prospective Parents with Disabilities, p 14.\n\n        Michigan caselaw is sparse regarding the level of services necessary to reasonably\naccommodate a disabled parent.

The caseworker opined\nthat the “[r]espondent needed someone to live with her, not just oversee her progress.” Id. at 18-\n19. Unfortunately, the respondent had no friends or family who could provide that support. Id.\nat 19.\n\n       Although this Court deemed waived the respondent’s challenge to the level of services\nprovided in Terry, id. at 27, the panel noted that it would have rejected her claims in any event.\n\n       It is undisputed that respondent was provided with extensive services, and there is\n       no evidence that she was denied any services that are available to parents with\n       greater cognitive abilities. The caseworkers were aware of respondent’s\n       intellectual limitations and would repeat instructions multiple times and remind\n       her when tasks had to be completed. Respondent received assistance through\n       GCCMH to address both personal and parenting problems in a program that was\n       tailored to developmentally disabled persons. An arrangement under which\n       respondent lived in the children’s foster home was attempted but proved\n       unsuccessful. Petitioner had no other services available that would address\n       respondent’s deficiencies while allowing her to keep her children. The ADA does\n       not require petitioner to provide respondent with full-time, live-in assistance with\n       her children. See Bartell v Lohiser, 12 F Supp 2d 640, 650 (ED Mich, 1998). [Id.\n       at 27-28.]\n\n\n\n\n                                               -13-\n\f       A handful of unpublished opinions of this Court have also addressed whether reasonable\naccommodations were made in providing services to a disabled parent.13 In In re Rice,\nunpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 12, 2013 (Docket No.\n315766), unpub op at 2, this Court found reasonable accommodations where a psychologist\nevaluated the respondent and recommended tailored services, each service provider was notified\nregarding the respondent’s special needs, and the providers expressly indicated that they\nmodified their services for the respondent, with “methods such as repetition and role modeling.”\n\n        This Court also found that reasonable accommodations were made in In re Ali-Maliki,\nunpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 19, 2015 (Docket No.\n321420). In that case, the DHHS provided services to the cognitively impaired mother for more\nthan four years. Id., unpub op at 2-3. These services included “individual therapy, parenting\nclasses, two evaluations at the Clinic for Child Studies, two psychological evaluations, a\npsychiatric evaluation, supervised visitations, family therapy, Wraparound services, a parenting\ncoach, and a parent partner. She also received services from an infant mental health specialist.”\nId., unpub op at 3. The respondent was given the opportunity to parent her children while living\nwith her parents who provided assistance, but even that proved too much. Id., unpub op at 1.\nThis Court ultimately agreed with the circuit court’s assessment that reasonable efforts had been\nmade, but that “the evidence amply demonstrates that respondent’s limited cognitive abilities\ncould not be accommodated to the degree necessary to enable her to parent the five children, four\nof whom have severe special needs.” Id., unpub op at 4.\n\n        In In re White, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued March 29,\n2012 (Docket No. 305411), unpub op at 2, the developmentally disabled and cognitively\nimpaired mother ceded custody of her children to CPS in part “because she was overwhelmed.”\nThe record demonstrated that the respondent starting receiving services “long before the children\nwere removed.” Id., unpub op at 4. And during the proceedings, the DHHS “provided\nrespondent with family-reunification services to correct her parenting skills and coping deficits;\nshe received psychological evaluations, parent-child bond evaluations, in-home parent classes,\nin-home parent coaching from an infant mental-health specialist, in-home community-living\nsupport services for home management, and supervised parenting time.” Id., unpub op at 2-3.\nThese services were modified to accommodate the respondent’s special needs. “She received\nhands-on demonstrations and proctoring that were consistent with the evaluating psychologist’s\nrecommendations.” Id., unpub op at 4. As the respondent had not benefitted from the extended,\nintensive services, this Court affirmed the circuit court’s termination decision.\n\n        In another case, however, this Court found termination supported when “it became\napparent that there were no services available that could help respondent-appellant parent his\nchildren because he was not capable of attaining the requisite level of parenting skills needed to\nparent the children.” In re Pomaville, unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals,\n\n\n\n13\n   Unpublished Court of Appeals opinions are not binding, but may be considered persuasive or\ninstructive.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 145 n 3; 783 NW2d\n133 (2010).\n\n\n                                              -14-\n\fissued January 13, 2004 (Docket No. 247168), unpub op at 2. The respondent-father in that case\nwas categorized as “developmentally delayed,” had an IQ of 54, and could not read. Id. The\nstate “accounted for and reasonably accommodated respondent-appellant’s disability in its efforts\nto reunify the family by locating parenting classes to accommodate his reading disability,\nattempting to locate services that would enable respondent to parent his children and referring\nhim to two doctors to evaluate his ability to parent with his disability.” Id. Where the parent\ncannot benefit even from modified services, however, termination is in the best interests of the\nchildren, this Court determined. Id.\n\n        Michigan jurisprudence has thereby recognized that reasonable accommodations must be\ntailored to the individual, to meaningfully that person in benefitting from services. Our courts\nhave implied that a cognitively impaired parent could maintain custody of his or her child even if\nhe or she requires assistance from a family member to safely care for the child but has not gone\nso far as to require the DHHS to consider an assistive housing arrangement such as parenting in a\ngroup home or a parent-child foster placement. This Court has recognized the benefit of the\nDHHS coordinating child protective services with organizations that serve the disabled\ncommunity. And this Court has cited with approval lower court decisions to delay the initiation\nof termination proceedings when a disabled parent requires additional time to benefit from\nservices because of their disability.\n\n        Given the dearth of Michigan caselaw on point, we also reviewed the jurisprudence of\nour sister states. We found instructive to our current analysis In re Victoria M, 207 Cal App 3d\n1317; 255 Cal Rptr 498 (1989). The respondent-mother in that matter had an IQ of 72, placing\nher “in the borderline range of intelligence.” Id. at 1321-1322. She had taken special education\nclasses as a child and as an adult, “used social services agencies in the community extensively.”\nId. The county department of social services (DSS) took the mother’s three children into care\nbecause the family was chronically homeless and the children were underfed, filthy, and infested\nwith lice. Id. at 1322. Despite that the mother had “obvious handicaps,” id. at 1328, and that the\nDSS had intervened with the family in the past, id. at 1327, the DSS waited 16 months to provide\npsychological testing to assess the mother’s level of intellectual functioning. Id. at 1324. In the\nmeantime, the mother was referred for generalized services and those providers questioned\nwhether the mother could benefit given her obvious limitations. Id. at 1323-1324. The DSS was\naware that specialized services for the developmentally disabled were available; it referred the\nmother’s son for such services at Valley Mountain Regional Center (VMRC). Id. at 1323-1324\nand n 4. The mother eventually secured services for herself through VMRC, but the DSS failed\nto monitor her progress or coordinate with the agency. Id. at 1324, 1330. Of great concern, the\nDSS also provided little to no assistance in the very areas that brought the children into care.\nHer parenting class coordinator failed to address “health and hygiene concerns” with mother,\nincorrectly believing that she understood these concepts. Id. at 1328. And despite mother’s\nhomelessness and extremely low income, the caseworker simply directed her to a local housing\nauthority and told her to read the newspaper to find housing. Id.\n\n       The California Court of Appeals found “[t]he record . . . clear that no accommodation\nwas made for [the mother’s] special needs in providing reunification services.” Id. at 1329. The\ncourt continued that the mother “obviously is developmentally disabled” and “[h]er disability\nshould have been apparent to those assessing the suitability of services offered to her.” Id. The\ncaseworker had already referred one of the children to VMRC, a “[r]egional center[] . . .\n\n                                               -15-\n\fspecifically designed to provide services to persons such as” the mother, but took no steps to\nsecure similar assistance for her. Id. at 1329-1330. Given the insufficiency of the services\nprovided, termination could not be supported by clear and convincing evidence on the ground\nthat the mother had not benefitted from services. Id. We find In re Victoria M virtually\nindistinguishable from the case at bar, and adopt its reasoning.\n\n        Drawing from the caselaw, federal and state law and regulations, and the plethora of\nexpert opinions on the topic, we take this opportunity to clarify what a court and the DHHS must\ndo when faced with a parent with a known or suspected intellectual, cognitive, or developmental\nimpairment. In such situations, neither the court nor the DHHS may sit back and wait for the\nparent to assert his or her right to reasonable accommodations. Rather, the DHHS must offer\nevaluations to determine the nature and extent of the parent’s disability and to secure\nrecommendations for tailoring necessary reunification services to the individual. The DHHS\nmust then endeavor to locate agencies that can provide services geared toward assisting the\nparent to overcome obstacles to reunification. If no local agency catering to the needs of such\nindividuals exists, the DHHS must ensure that the available service providers modify or adjust\ntheir programs to allow the parent an opportunity to benefit equal to that of a nondisabled parent.\nIf it becomes clear that the parent will only be able to safely care for his or her children in a\nsupportive environment, the DHHS must search for potential relatives or friends willing and able\nto provide a home for all. And if the DHHS shirks these duties, the circuit court must order\ncompliance. Moreover, consistent with MCL 712A.19a(6), if there is a delay in providing the\nparent reasonably accommodated services or if the evidence supports that the parent could safely\ncare for his or her children within a reasonable time given a reasonable extension of the services\nperiod, the court would not be required to order the filing of a termination period merely because\nthe child has been in foster care for 15 out of the last 22 months.\n\n        We emphasize that these requirements are not intended to stymie child protective\nproceedings to the detriment of the children involved. However, “[t]he goal of reunification of\nthe family must not be lost in the laudable attempt to make sure that children are not languishing\nin foster care while termination proceedings drag on and on.” Boursaw, 239 Mich App at 176-\n177. In the event that reasonable accommodations are made but the parent fails to demonstrate\nsufficient benefit such that he or she can safely parent the child, then the court may proceed to\ntermination. See In re Frey, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">297</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248; 824 NW2d 569 (2012); In re Gazella, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">264</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mich. App.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 676; 692 NW2d 708 (2005). If honest and careful evaluation reveals that no\nlevel or type of services could possibly remediate the parent to the point he or she could safely\ncare for the child, termination need not be unnecessarily delayed. Yet, such assessment may not\nbe based on stereotypes or assumptions or an unwillingness to make the required effort to\naccommodate the parent’s needs.\n\n                         V. APPLICATION TO THE CURRENT CASE\n\n        The DHHS did not fulfill its duties in this case, and the circuit court failed to adequately\nrecognize that shortcoming. The DHHS should have suspected (and likely knew) before the\nonset of these child protective proceedings that respondent is cognitively impaired. Houle,\nBaskerville, and Emerinini noted respondent’s disability upon first meeting her. Huckaby did\nnot describe respondent as cognitively impaired, but believed she at least suffered from mental\nillness. As respondent’s compromised intellectual abilities were readily apparent, the DHHS\n\n                                               -16-\n\fworkers involved in CB’s child protective proceedings were on notice by November 2011 that\nrespondent required assistance. And no worker involved in the current proceedings has denied\nthe obvious nature of respondent’s condition.\n\n        Instead of acting post haste to secure psychological and psychiatric evaluations to\ndetermine whether reasonably accommodated services were necessary or offered potential\nbenefit, the DHHS waited until May 2013—13 months after DH came into care—to secure these\nevaluations. In the meantime, the DHHS failed to make adequate efforts to provide respondent\nwith parenting time, effectively denying her contact with her daughter for eight months.\n\n        Further, the DHHS failed to reconsider respondent’s service plan after respondent was\npsychologically evaluated. The results of respondent’s psychological evaluation were grim,\nrevealing that respondent fell into the low and extremely low range on various assessments. She\ncould read but lacked comprehension of the material perused and could not write in complete\nsentences. Yet, the DHHS ordered respondent to earn a GED and find employment and housing,\nand never revisited these mechanically-generated requirements. The psychologist recommended\n“administer[ing] a measure of adaptive functioning to determine specific strengths and\nweaknesses with regard to activities of daily living.”14 This was never done. The result was that\nthe DHHS ordered respondent to climb mountains that she could not possibly surmount.\nSpecifically, respondent likely will never be able to read and comprehend the contents of a GED\nexam, hold down employment without an onsite mentor, or live independently. A service plan\nthat ignored these realities was simply unreasonable and not individually tailored to the parent’s\nneeds.\n\n        Following the evaluations, the DHHS failed to consider whether respondent required\nspecialized services for the cognitively impaired. The record establishes that several agencies\nprovide wrap-around services for the cognitively impaired in the metropolitan Detroit area.\nRespondent was even referred for generalized services at some of those agencies. Yet, the\nDHHS did not seek to have respondent placed in any of the programs geared toward the\ncognitively impaired until several months after Gilflix objected in August 2014. The DHHS then\ndelayed referring respondent for the proper type of services until the very eve of the termination\nhearing. Its employee made a half-hearted attempt to transfer respondent’s services to the\nagency respondent’s counsel recommended, failed to follow up in a timely manner, and\nultimately denied respondent the type of services she required for several months. Although\nHoule informed the regular service providers that respondent was cognitively impaired and\n\n\n\n14\n   “Adaptive functioning” is “the relative ability of a person to effectively interact with society\non all levels and care for one’s self; affected by one’s willingness to practice skills and pursue\nopportunities for improvement on all levels. Often used to describe levels of mental retardation.”\n<http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/adaptive+functioning> (accessed April 18,\n2016). “Tests of adaptive functioning evaluate the social and emotional maturity of a child,\nrelative to his or her peers. They also help to evaluate life skills and abilities.” Reynolds,\nZupanick, & Dombeck, Tests of Adaptive Functioning, <https://www.mentalhelp.net/articles/\ntests-of-adaptive-functioning/> (accessed April 18, 2016).\n\n\n                                               -17-\n\frequired explicit and simple instruction, this was inadequate when more intensive services from\nspecialized agencies were readily available.\n\n        The record is also devoid of information regarding the content of the parenting classes,\njob training, and GED preparation courses in which respondent participated. The psychologist\nnoted that respondent required “in-session role-playing” to address concerns. Respondent also\nhad difficulty reading and comprehending written material. The DHHS presented no witnesses\nfrom any service provider to describe how material was presented to respondent. Accordingly,\nwe cannot know whether the limited accommodations recommended by the DHHS were even\nimplemented in practice. And while the caseworkers testified that respondent’s therapist\nprovided a higher level of hands-on services to assist respondent in meeting her goals, that\ntherapist was never presented to describe her role or respondent’s progress. The DHHS also\nfailed to present the parent partner who was apparently assigned to offer more in-depth\nassistance, and made no record of his particular services.\n\n        Certain evidence suggested that respondent may never achieve the ability to safely parent\nher children independently. As a result, the DHHS actively searched for a friend or family\nmember to take in both mother and children and provide assistance with childcare. Respondent’s\ngrandmother in Ohio offered the family a home, but only if respondent was solely responsible for\nthe children’s care. The DHHS deemed this an inappropriate placement. However, the record is\ndevoid of information regarding whether local services would be available to respondent in Ohio\nso that she could safely parent her children in her grandmother’s home with some outside\nassistance.\n\n        Ultimately, respondent may be unable to overcome the conditions that brought her\nchildren into care. We readily acknowledge that even with appropriate assistive services she\nmay be unable to safely parent her children. Investigation may reveal that no home is available\nto respondent where she may provide for her children without, or even with, outside assistance.\nGiven the inadequate reunification services provided thus far, however, any such conclusion is\npremature. Accordingly, we must vacate the termination decision and remand for the provision\nof services with reasonable accommodation made for respondent’s cognitive impairment.\n\n        We vacate the termination decision and remand for further proceedings consistent with\nthis opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.\n\n\n\n\n                                                           /s/ Elizabeth L. Gleicher\n                                                           /s/ Mark J.
