We disagree. “[T]he appropriate standard of review in cases where a judge imposes a\nsentence of life without parole on a juvenile defendant is a common three-fold standard . . . .”\nPeople v Hyatt, ___ Mich App ___, ___; ___ NW2d ___ (2016) (Docket No. 325741); slip op at\n25. The trial court’s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, questions of law are reviewed\nde novo, and the court’s ultimate determination as to an appropriate sentence is reviewed for an\nabuse of discretion. Id.\n\n       In Miller, 132 S Ct at 2460, the United States Supreme Court held that a sentence of\n“mandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates\nthe Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on ‘cruel and unusual punishments.’ ”\n\n       Mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his\n       chronological age and its hallmark features—among them, immaturity,\n       impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking\n       into account the family and home environment that surrounds him—and from\n       which he cannot usually extricate himself—no matter how brutal or\n       dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense, including\n       the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer\n       pressures may have affected him. Indeed, it ignores that he might have been\n       charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated\n       with youth—for example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors\n       (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys. . . .\n       And finally, this mandatory punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation\n       even when the circumstances most suggest it. [Id. at 2468.]\n\n“By making youth (and all that accompanies it) irrelevant to imposition of that harshest prison\nsentence, such a scheme poses too great a risk of disproportionate punishment.” Id. at 2469.\nThe Supreme Court declined to consider the defendants’ arguments for a categorical prohibition\nof life without parole sentences for juveniles but stated that “appropriate occasions for\nsentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.” Id. The Supreme\nCourt noted that it was difficult to distinguish “at this early age between the juvenile offender\nwhose crimes reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose\ncrime reflects irreparable corruption.” Id. (quotation marks and citations omitted). “Although\nwe do not foreclose a sentencer’s ability to make that judgment in homicide cases, we require it\nto take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against\nirrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.” Id.\n\n        Following the issuance of Miller, our Legislature enacted MCL 769.25, which became\neffective on March 4, 2014. See 2014 PA 22. The statute applies to a defendant who was less\nthan 18 years old at the time he or she committed the offense. MCL 769.25(1). The prosecutor\nmay file a motion to sentence a defendant convicted of first-degree murder to life without parole.\nMCL 769.25(2) and (3). If the prosecutor files such a motion in conformance with the statutory\nrequirements, the trial court must conduct a hearing at which the court considers the factors listed\n\n                                                -2-\n\fin Miller and any other relevant criteria, including the defendant’s prison record. MCL\n769.25(6). At the hearing, the trial court must specify the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances and the reasons for the sentence imposed; the court may consider evidence\npresented at trial and evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. MCL 769.25(7). If the trial\ncourt declines to impose a life without parole sentence, the court must impose a sentence in\nwhich the maximum term is at least 60 years and the minimum term is between 25 and 40 years.\nMCL 769.25(9).\n\n        Although the trial court’s ultimate determination of the appropriate sentence is reviewed\nfor an abuse of discretion, “the imposition of a juvenile life-without-parole sentence requires a\nheightened degree of scrutiny regarding whether a life-without-parole sentence is proportionate\nto a particular juvenile offender, and even under this deferential standard, an appellate court\nshould view such a sentence as inherently suspect.” Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 26.\n“[A]ppellate review of a juvenile life-without-parole sentence cannot be a mere rubber-stamping\nof the penalty handed out by the sentencing court.” Id. Although such a sentence is not\npresumed to be unconstitutional, a searching inquiry into the record must be undertaken with\n“the understanding that, more likely than not, the sentence imposed is disproportionate.” Id. A\nsentencing court abuses its discretion if it “ ‘fails to consider a relevant factor that should have\nreceived significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or\nconsiders only appropriate factors but nevertheless commits a clear error of judgment by arriving\nat a sentence that lies outside the limited range of choice dictated by the facts of the case.’ ” Id.\nat 27, quoting United States v Haack, 403 F3d 997, 1004 (CA 8, 2005).\n\n        In Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 27-28, this Court concluded that the trial court\nhad failed to adhere to the directives in Miller and its progeny “about the rarity with which a life-\nwithout-parole sentence should be imposed.” Although the trial court in Hyatt focused on the\nMiller factors, “the court gave no credence to Miller’s repeated warnings that a life-without-\nparole sentence should only be imposed on the rare or uncommon juvenile offender.” Hyatt, ___\nMich App at ___; slip op at 28. Moreover, the trial court in Hyatt had emphasized a\npsychologist’s opinion that the defendant’s prognosis for change in the next five years was poor;\nthe focus on a five-year period was inconsistent with the holding in Miller “that a life-without-\nparole sentence will be proportionate for the juvenile who is irreparably corrupt and incapable of\nchange – not one who is incapable of change within the next five years.” Id. This Court\ntherefore remanded the case for resentencing and directed the trial court “to not only consider the\nMiller factors, but to decide whether this individual is the truly rare juvenile mentioned in Miller\nwho is incorrigible and incapable of reform.” Id.\n\n        In the present case, the trial court did not err in analyzing each of the Miller factors and\nfinding that defendant is the rare juvenile offender who is irreparably corrupt. The trial court\nexpressed full appreciation of the rarity of the circumstances in which a juvenile offender will be\ndeemed incapable of reformation. The court quoted and discussed relevant portions of the\nholding and analysis in Miller, and noted the admonition in Miller that appropriate occasions to\nsentence juveniles to life without parole will be uncommon. Then, after analyzing the Miller\nfactors, the trial court concluded “that defendant’s case presents precisely what the Supreme\nCourt characterized as the ‘rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.’ ”\nAccordingly, the trial court accorded appropriate recognition and made pertinent findings\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fregarding the rarity of circumstances warranting a life without parole sentence for a juvenile\noffender.\n\n        Moreover, the trial court’s conclusion that defendant is the rare juvenile offender for\nwhom a life without parole sentence is warranted was supported by the court’s accurate analysis\nof the Miller factors. We will now discuss each of the Miller factors.\n\n        The first factor concerns defendant’s age and its hallmark features. Miller, 132 S Ct at\n2468. Defendant was 17 years and 8 months old when he committed the offenses (in marked\ncontrast to the 14-year-old defendants in Miller, 132 S Ct at 24602). The record refutes any\nclaim that the hallmark features of adolescence identified in Miller, 132 S Ct at 2468, including\nimmaturity, impetuosity, and a failure to appreciate risks and consequences, played any role in\ndefendant’s crimes. This was not, as in Miller, 132 S Ct at 2465, a mere botched robbery that\nturned into a killing. Defendant engaged in an unusually horrific, disturbing, and violent crime\nspree that extended over a three-day period. Defendant, aided by codefendant Robert Taylor,\nbrazenly and forcibly kidnapped and carjacked Matt Landry in broad daylight outside a\nrestaurant, punched and dragged him by the neck, drove his car, held him captive for at least\nseven hours, used his ATM card to steal his money and buy numerous items. He then took\nLandry to a drug house where defendant bought and consumed crack cocaine. Finally, defendant\ntook Landry to a nearby vacant house where he killed him in a brutal execution style by shooting\nhim in the back of the head. Defendant then committed additional violent crimes over the next\ntwo days, including robbing a bank and its customers, kidnapping a bank customer, and another\ncarjacking. Landry’s significantly decomposed body was found two days later inside the vacant\nburned out house where he had been shot in the back of the head. From the position of the body,\nit appeared that Landry had been kneeling at the time of his murder. Defendant’s criminal\nactions over an extended period of time are not reflective of a merely immature or impetuous\nadolescent who fails to appreciate risks and consequences.\n\n       Defendant relies on testimony by Dr. Daniel P. Keating, defendant’s expert in cognitive\nand brain development in adolescents, about a developmental maturity mismatch in which an\nadolescent’s limbic system matures more quickly than the prefrontal cortex. This testimony has\nminimal bearing on these facts, and Dr. Keating did not meet or interview defendant. He was\n\n\n\n2\n  The Supreme Court in Miller indicated that it is appropriate to take into account the differences\nbetween juveniles of different ages. In particular, when explaining the flaws of a scheme of\nmandatory life imprisonment without parole for juveniles, the Miller Court said: “Under these\nschemes, every juvenile will receive the same sentence as every other—the 17-year-old and the\n14-year-old, the shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable household and the child from\na chaotic and abusive one.” Miller, 132 S Ct at 2467-2468. The Miller majority criticized the\ndissents in Miller for repeatedly referring to 17-year-olds who have committed heinous offenses\nand comparing those defendants to the 14-year-old defendants in Miller. The Miller majority\nexplained: “Our holding requires factfinders to attend to exactly such circumstances – to take\ninto account the differences among defendants and crimes. By contrast, the sentencing schemes\nthat the dissents find permissible altogether preclude considering these factors.” Id. at 2469 n 8.\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fonly addressing generic brain science. Defendant’s reliance on Dr. Keating’s testimony that the\nprefrontal cortex is not fully developed until a person reaches his or her middle twenties fails to\nconsider that an offender who is only four months older than defendant is subject to a mandatory\nlife without parole sentence. Dr. Keating acknowledged that a person who is 17 years and 8\nmonths old is not significantly different in brain development from an 18-year-old person. Also,\nWilliam Ladd, who was defendant’s lawyer guardian ad litem (LGAL) for many years, testified\nthat defendant fell within the middle range in terms of maturity of the 5,000 to 8,000 children\nwith whom Ladd had worked in his 30 years of experience. In sum, defendant’s chronological\nage and its hallmark features do not weigh in favor of mitigation.\n\n        The next factor concerns defendant’s family and home environment. Miller, 132 S Ct at\n2468. The trial court correctly noted that there was uncontroverted testimony that defendant had\na terrible family and home environment, having been subjected to abuse and neglect by relatives\nin the United States after having been sent here from Lebanon as a child. Defendant was placed\nin at least 10 foster homes. He was diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and pediatric seizures.\nServices meant to address his special needs were not continuously provided. Further, cultural\nand linguistic considerations were not adequately taken into account. As defendant was moved\nfrom one foster care placement to another, he lost the ability to form attachments with parental\nfigures and became more oriented toward being out on the streets, eventually becoming involved\nin gangs. In school, defendant struggled academically and began getting into fights and\nexhibiting disrespect to his teachers. Defendant had juvenile delinquency cases for assault and\ndrug offenses; he pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and became a delinquent court ward. In light\nof the terrible circumstances of defendant’s family and home environment, the trial court\nproperly weighed this factor in favor of defendant and against a life without parole sentence.\n\n        The next factor is “the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of\n[defendant’s] participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have\naffected him.” Miller, 132 S Ct at 2468. As discussed, defendant actively participated in the\ncrimes. There is no indication that any family or peer pressure led defendant to commit the\ncrimes. Defendant held Landry captive for at least seven hours, used his ATM card to obtain\nLandry’s money, purchased multiple items with that money, took Landry to a drug house where\ndefendant consumed crack cocaine, and then took Landry to a nearby vacant house where\ndefendant shot Landry in the back of the head in a cold-blooded execution-style murder.\nDefendant then committed additional violent crimes over the next two days and used Landry’s\nvehicle as a getaway car. Defendant had more than ample opportunity to abandon his criminal\nacts during the many hours that he held Landry captive and used his money before killing him in\na brutal fashion. Given defendant’s extensive participation in these disturbing criminal acts and\nthe absence of any family or peer pressure on defendant, the trial court did not err in heavily\nweighing this factor against defendant and concluding that it did not favor mitigation.\n\n         The next Miller factor is whether defendant “might have been charged and convicted of a\nlesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth—for example, his inability to deal\nwith police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his\nown attorneys.” Miller, 132 S Ct at 2468. The trial court correctly noted that there is no\nevidence of any incapacities of youth that rendered defendant unable to participate in his defense\nor that led him to implicate himself. This factor therefore did not weigh in favor of mitigation.\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f        The final factor is the possibility of rehabilitation suggested by the circumstances.\nMiller, 132 S Ct at 2468. Dr. Keating explained that a person’s prospects for rehabilitation are\nassociated with his or her developmental history. Negative experiences and behaviors during a\nperson’s developmental period increase the probability that the person will not succeed in rising\nabove difficulties. Some people do not change; the worse the circumstances, the more likely that\nthe person will not overcome their circumstances. Greater rehabilitation challenges exist for\nsomeone who purposely shot another.\n\n        Dr. Lyle Danuloff, a clinical psychologist who met with defendant for more than four\nhours over three different visits, explained that when defendant committed the crimes in this\ncase, he was unattached in human relationships, living on the streets, and living an amoral life\n“with the sense of what do I need and what do I need to do to get my needs met. He lived in the\nmoment and did not live with any sense of right and wrong.” When defendant committed the\ncrimes, he was AWOL from his last placement, running the streets with other young people,\nconsuming marijuana, selling drugs, and lacking any personhood in terms of relating to other\npeople as fellow human beings rather than objects to meet his needs. Dr. Danuloff thinks that\ndefendant has experienced turning points in his development. Defendant “got lucky” because he\nwas placed in segregation where he is alone in his cell 23 hours a day and because he learned\nabout the Miller decision, so he now has a hope of someday obtaining a parole hearing. While\nalone in his cell, defendant began to read the Bible and other books to learn how people treat one\nanother and the difference between righteousness and evil. Dr. Danuloff opined that the\npossibility of a parole hearing motivated defendant to begin to explore himself and try to\nunderstand who he is, what he did, and why he did it. In Dr. Danuloff’s view, defendant is\nbeginning to have a very primitive and embryonic capacity to explore himself and ask questions\nabout himself. Defendant stopped getting misconduct tickets in prison. Defendant also became\na prison barber and a representative of his prison housing unit.\n\n        Dr. Danuloff testified that defendant said that “[e]ven a Godly person can punish people\nwho bring harm to them. Even God did this.” When asked whether what he did in this case was\nrighteous or evil, defendant said that “it was a little bit of both.” Defendant explained, “[W]ell, I\ndidn’t have any choice. It’s how I was, it’s how I lived, it’s how I behaved.” Defendant said, “I\ncouldn’t think of anything else to do. I was in a situation and I had to get—and I had to take care\nof the situation I was in.” When asked how his actions were evil, defendant said that he hurt\npeople badly, which indicates to Dr. Danuloff “the embryonic development of personhood.” Dr.\nDanuloff thinks defendant is in the rudimentary stages of growing up by using people like Jesus\nand Muhammad as teachers and internalizing what he reads. Dr. Danuloff indicated that there is\nno way for a psychologist to predict how a person will behave in the future.\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Danuloff acknowledged that people normally cannot fix\npsychological problems by themselves and that psychotherapy is needed. Psychotherapy\nrequires introspection and a willingness to work on oneself. Dr. Danuloff agreed that he saw\ndefendant in the structured prison setting years after the crimes were committed and that he\ncannot say what defendant would be like if released.\n\n        The trial court correctly concluded that this factor did not favor mitigation. Although the\ndifficulty of defendant’s upbringing weighs in his favor, it also indicates that he faces significant\nchallenges in improving himself, as reflected in the testimony of Dr. Keating and Dr. Danuloff.\n\n                                                -6-\n\fWe share the trial court’s concern about defendant’s comments to Dr. Danuloff reflecting that\ndefendant thinks his actions in this case were partially righteous and that he did not have a\nchoice. As discussed, defendant had more than ample opportunity to abandon his criminal\nactivity in the many hours that he held Landry captive before brutally killing him. Hence,\ndefendant’s abhorrent belief that his actions were partially righteous and that he had no choice\nbut to behave as he did, despite the horrific nature of his criminal acts committed over an\nextended period of time, indicates that defendant’s prospects for rehabilitation are extremely\nremote or nonexistent. Defendant continued engaging in assaultive behavior after being\nincarcerated for the present offenses. He assaulted or attempted to assault staff personnel at the\nMacomb County Jail several times. After being transferred to prison, defendant incurred 23\nmisconduct tickets. Four of the tickets were for fighting, two were for engaging in threatening\nbehavior, two were for possessing a weapon, one was for assault and battery of another prisoner,\nand another one was for assault resulting in serious physical injury to another prisoner. The fact\nthat defendant stopped misbehaving in prison after learning of Miller does not necessarily reflect\na rudimentary moral awakening, as Dr. Danuloff claimed. Defendant’s improved behavior is just\nas, if not more, likely to reflect manipulation designed to obtain a lesser sentence, as the trial\ncourt found. This conclusion is also consistent with defendant’s earlier diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder and the manipulative behaviors associated with that condition. Dr. Danuloff\ntestified that persons diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder do not generally participate\nin psychotherapy unless mandated to do so and that the prognosis for such mandatory treatment\nis not positive. Moreover, even if defendant is beginning to exhibit a very rudimentary or\nembryonic capacity for self-exploration, we note Dr. Danuloff’s testimony supports the trial\ncourt’s conclusion that defendant is unlikely to make significant progress without intensive\nprofessional assistance, and no basis exists to conclude that he will receive intensive professional\nassistance in prison and achieve full rehabilitation. The trial court properly concluded that\ndefendant’s prospects for rehabilitation are negligible.\n\n       Overall, our review of the record indicates that the trial court accurately analyzed each of\nthe Miller factors and correctly concluded that defendant is the rare juvenile offender whose\ncrime reflects irreparable corruption. The trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in\ndetermining that defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n\n        Defendant next argues that the trial court erred in failing to empanel a jury at the Miller\nresentencing hearing. We disagree. This issue presents a question of law, which is reviewed de\nnovo. Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 2. Because defendant failed to preserve this issue\nby raising it below, People v Metamora Water Serv, Inc, 276 Mich App 376, 382; 741 NW2d 61\n(2007), our review is for plain error affecting substantial rights, People v Carines, 460 Mich 750,\n763-764; 597 NW2d 130 (1999).\n\n       In People v Skinner, 312 Mich App 15, 20; 877 NW2d 482 (2015), rejected by Hyatt, ___\nMich App at ___; slip op at 21, the majority of a panel of this Court held “that the Sixth\nAmendment mandates that juveniles convicted of homicide who face the possibility of a\nsentence of life without the possibility of parole have a right to have their sentences determined\nby a jury.” In People v Perkins, ___ Mich App ___, ___; ___ NW2d ___ (2016) (Docket Nos.\n323454, 323876, 325741); vacated in part by People v Perkins, unpublished order of the Court of\nAppeals, entered February 12, 2016 (Docket Nos. 323454, 323876, 325741), and superseded in\npart by Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 1, 21, another panel of this Court followed\n\n                                                -7-\n\fSkinner only because it was obligated to do so, MCR 7.215(J)(2), and stated its opinion that\nSkinner was wrongly decided.

The Hyatt conflict panel summarized its analysis as follows:\n\n               In sum, we find that Miller’s individualized sentencing mandate, as\n       incorporated by MCL 769.25, does not run afoul of Sixth Amendment precedent.\n       A judge, not a jury, is to make the determination of whether to impose a life-\n       without-parole sentence or a term-of-years sentence under MCL 769.25.\n       Accordingly, we reject the result reached in Skinner and conclude that the prior\n       panel in this case was correct in its analysis. [Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op\n       at 21.]\n\nTherefore, the trial court in this case did not err by failing to empanel a jury at the Miller hearing\nbecause the conflict panel in Hyatt rejected the portion of Skinner on which defendant relies.\n\n       We affirm.\n\n                                                              /s/ Jane E.

Riordan\n\n\n\n\n3\n Before the issuance of the conflict panel’s opinion in Hyatt, the conflict panel issued an order\nvacating an earlier order that had consolidated Perkins, Hyatt, and another case, so that only\nHyatt proceeded before the conflict panel. See People v Perkins, unpublished order of the Court\nof Appeals, issued April 26, 2016 (Docket Nos. 323454, 323876, 325741).

The trial court’s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, questions of law are reviewed\nde novo, and the court’s ultimate determination as to an appropriate sentence is reviewed for an\nabuse of discretion. Id.\n\n       In Miller, 132 S Ct at 2460, the United States Supreme Court held that a sentence of\n“mandatory life without parole for those under the age of 18 at the time of their crimes violates\nthe Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on ‘cruel and unusual punishments.’ ”\n\n       Mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his\n       chronological age and its hallmark features—among them, immaturity,\n       impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking\n       into account the family and home environment that surrounds him—and from\n       which he cannot usually extricate himself—no matter how brutal or\n       dysfunctional. It neglects the circumstances of the homicide offense, including\n       the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer\n       pressures may have affected him. Indeed, it ignores that he might have been\n       charged and convicted of a lesser offense if not for incompetencies associated\n       with youth—for example, his inability to deal with police officers or prosecutors\n       (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his own attorneys. . . .\n       And finally, this mandatory punishment disregards the possibility of rehabilitation\n       even when the circumstances most suggest it. [Id. at 2468.]\n\n“By making youth (and all that accompanies it) irrelevant to imposition of that harshest prison\nsentence, such a scheme poses too great a risk of disproportionate punishment.” Id. at 2469.\nThe Supreme Court declined to consider the defendants’ arguments for a categorical prohibition\nof life without parole sentences for juveniles but stated that “appropriate occasions for\nsentencing juveniles to this harshest possible penalty will be uncommon.” Id. The Supreme\nCourt noted that it was difficult to distinguish “at this early age between the juvenile offender\nwhose crimes reflects unfortunate yet transient immaturity, and the rare juvenile offender whose\ncrime reflects irreparable corruption.” Id. (quotation marks and citations omitted). “Although\nwe do not foreclose a sentencer’s ability to make that judgment in homicide cases, we require it\nto take into account how children are different, and how those differences counsel against\nirrevocably sentencing them to a lifetime in prison.” Id.\n\n        Following the issuance of Miller, our Legislature enacted MCL 769.25, which became\neffective on March 4, 2014. See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">PA</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The statute applies to a defendant who was less\nthan 18 years old at the time he or she committed the offense. MCL 769.25(1). The prosecutor\nmay file a motion to sentence a defendant convicted of first-degree murder to life without parole.\nMCL 769.25(2) and (3). If the prosecutor files such a motion in conformance with the statutory\nrequirements, the trial court must conduct a hearing at which the court considers the factors listed\n\n                                                -2-\n\fin Miller and any other relevant criteria, including the defendant’s prison record. MCL\n769.25(6). At the hearing, the trial court must specify the aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances and the reasons for the sentence imposed; the court may consider evidence\npresented at trial and evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. MCL 769.25(7). If the trial\ncourt declines to impose a life without parole sentence, the court must impose a sentence in\nwhich the maximum term is at least 60 years and the minimum term is between 25 and 40 years.\nMCL 769.25(9).\n\n        Although the trial court’s ultimate determination of the appropriate sentence is reviewed\nfor an abuse of discretion, “the imposition of a juvenile life-without-parole sentence requires a\nheightened degree of scrutiny regarding whether a life-without-parole sentence is proportionate\nto a particular juvenile offender, and even under this deferential standard, an appellate court\nshould view such a sentence as inherently suspect.” Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 26.\n“[A]ppellate review of a juvenile life-without-parole sentence cannot be a mere rubber-stamping\nof the penalty handed out by the sentencing court.” Id. Although such a sentence is not\npresumed to be unconstitutional, a searching inquiry into the record must be undertaken with\n“the understanding that, more likely than not, the sentence imposed is disproportionate.” Id. A\nsentencing court abuses its discretion if it “ ‘fails to consider a relevant factor that should have\nreceived significant weight, gives significant weight to an improper or irrelevant factor, or\nconsiders only appropriate factors but nevertheless commits a clear error of judgment by arriving\nat a sentence that lies outside the limited range of choice dictated by the facts of the case.’ ” Id.\nat 27, quoting United States v Haack, 403 F3d 997, 1004 (CA 8, 2005).\n\n        In Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 27-28, this Court concluded that the trial court\nhad failed to adhere to the directives in Miller and its progeny “about the rarity with which a life-\nwithout-parole sentence should be imposed.” Although the trial court in Hyatt focused on the\nMiller factors, “the court gave no credence to Miller’s repeated warnings that a life-without-\nparole sentence should only be imposed on the rare or uncommon juvenile offender.” Hyatt, ___\nMich App at ___; slip op at 28. Moreover, the trial court in Hyatt had emphasized a\npsychologist’s opinion that the defendant’s prognosis for change in the next five years was poor;\nthe focus on a five-year period was inconsistent with the holding in Miller “that a life-without-\nparole sentence will be proportionate for the juvenile who is irreparably corrupt and incapable of\nchange – not one who is incapable of change within the next five years.” Id. This Court\ntherefore remanded the case for resentencing and directed the trial court “to not only consider the\nMiller factors, but to decide whether this individual is the truly rare juvenile mentioned in Miller\nwho is incorrigible and incapable of reform.” Id.\n\n        In the present case, the trial court did not err in analyzing each of the Miller factors and\nfinding that defendant is the rare juvenile offender who is irreparably corrupt. The trial court\nexpressed full appreciation of the rarity of the circumstances in which a juvenile offender will be\ndeemed incapable of reformation. The court quoted and discussed relevant portions of the\nholding and analysis in Miller, and noted the admonition in Miller that appropriate occasions to\nsentence juveniles to life without parole will be uncommon. Then, after analyzing the Miller\nfactors, the trial court concluded “that defendant’s case presents precisely what the Supreme\nCourt characterized as the ‘rare juvenile offender whose crime reflects irreparable corruption.’ ”\nAccordingly, the trial court accorded appropriate recognition and made pertinent findings\n\n\n                                                -3-\n\fregarding the rarity of circumstances warranting a life without parole sentence for a juvenile\noffender.\n\n        Moreover, the trial court’s conclusion that defendant is the rare juvenile offender for\nwhom a life without parole sentence is warranted was supported by the court’s accurate analysis\nof the Miller factors. We will now discuss each of the Miller factors.\n\n        The first factor concerns defendant’s age and its hallmark features. Miller, 132 S Ct at\n2468. Defendant was 17 years and 8 months old when he committed the offenses (in marked\ncontrast to the 14-year-old defendants in Miller, 132 S Ct at 24602). The record refutes any\nclaim that the hallmark features of adolescence identified in Miller, 132 S Ct at 2468, including\nimmaturity, impetuosity, and a failure to appreciate risks and consequences, played any role in\ndefendant’s crimes. This was not, as in Miller, 132 S Ct at 2465, a mere botched robbery that\nturned into a killing. Defendant engaged in an unusually horrific, disturbing, and violent crime\nspree that extended over a three-day period. Defendant, aided by codefendant Robert Taylor,\nbrazenly and forcibly kidnapped and carjacked Matt Landry in broad daylight outside a\nrestaurant, punched and dragged him by the neck, drove his car, held him captive for at least\nseven hours, used his ATM card to steal his money and buy numerous items. He then took\nLandry to a drug house where defendant bought and consumed crack cocaine. Finally, defendant\ntook Landry to a nearby vacant house where he killed him in a brutal execution style by shooting\nhim in the back of the head. Defendant then committed additional violent crimes over the next\ntwo days, including robbing a bank and its customers, kidnapping a bank customer, and another\ncarjacking. Landry’s significantly decomposed body was found two days later inside the vacant\nburned out house where he had been shot in the back of the head. From the position of the body,\nit appeared that Landry had been kneeling at the time of his murder. Defendant’s criminal\nactions over an extended period of time are not reflective of a merely immature or impetuous\nadolescent who fails to appreciate risks and consequences.\n\n       Defendant relies on testimony by Dr. Daniel P. Keating, defendant’s expert in cognitive\nand brain development in adolescents, about a developmental maturity mismatch in which an\nadolescent’s limbic system matures more quickly than the prefrontal cortex. This testimony has\nminimal bearing on these facts, and Dr. Keating did not meet or interview defendant. He was\n\n\n\n2\n  The Supreme Court in Miller indicated that it is appropriate to take into account the differences\nbetween juveniles of different ages. In particular, when explaining the flaws of a scheme of\nmandatory life imprisonment without parole for juveniles, the Miller Court said: “Under these\nschemes, every juvenile will receive the same sentence as every other—the 17-year-old and the\n14-year-old, the shooter and the accomplice, the child from a stable household and the child from\na chaotic and abusive one.” Miller, 132 S Ct at 2467-2468. The Miller majority criticized the\ndissents in Miller for repeatedly referring to 17-year-olds who have committed heinous offenses\nand comparing those defendants to the 14-year-old defendants in Miller. The Miller majority\nexplained: “Our holding requires factfinders to attend to exactly such circumstances – to take\ninto account the differences among defendants and crimes. By contrast, the sentencing schemes\nthat the dissents find permissible altogether preclude considering these factors.” Id. at 2469 n 8.\n\n\n                                                -4-\n\fonly addressing generic brain science. Defendant’s reliance on Dr. Keating’s testimony that the\nprefrontal cortex is not fully developed until a person reaches his or her middle twenties fails to\nconsider that an offender who is only four months older than defendant is subject to a mandatory\nlife without parole sentence. Dr. Keating acknowledged that a person who is 17 years and 8\nmonths old is not significantly different in brain development from an 18-year-old person. Also,\nWilliam Ladd, who was defendant’s lawyer guardian ad litem (LGAL) for many years, testified\nthat defendant fell within the middle range in terms of maturity of the 5,000 to 8,000 children\nwith whom Ladd had worked in his 30 years of experience. In sum, defendant’s chronological\nage and its hallmark features do not weigh in favor of mitigation.\n\n        The next factor concerns defendant’s family and home environment. Miller, 132 S Ct at\n2468. The trial court correctly noted that there was uncontroverted testimony that defendant had\na terrible family and home environment, having been subjected to abuse and neglect by relatives\nin the United States after having been sent here from Lebanon as a child. Defendant was placed\nin at least 10 foster homes. He was diagnosed with ADHD, depression, and pediatric seizures.\nServices meant to address his special needs were not continuously provided. Further, cultural\nand linguistic considerations were not adequately taken into account. As defendant was moved\nfrom one foster care placement to another, he lost the ability to form attachments with parental\nfigures and became more oriented toward being out on the streets, eventually becoming involved\nin gangs. In school, defendant struggled academically and began getting into fights and\nexhibiting disrespect to his teachers. Defendant had juvenile delinquency cases for assault and\ndrug offenses; he pleaded guilty to misdemeanors and became a delinquent court ward. In light\nof the terrible circumstances of defendant’s family and home environment, the trial court\nproperly weighed this factor in favor of defendant and against a life without parole sentence.\n\n        The next factor is “the circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of\n[defendant’s] participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have\naffected him.” Miller, 132 S Ct at 2468. As discussed, defendant actively participated in the\ncrimes. There is no indication that any family or peer pressure led defendant to commit the\ncrimes. Defendant held Landry captive for at least seven hours, used his ATM card to obtain\nLandry’s money, purchased multiple items with that money, took Landry to a drug house where\ndefendant consumed crack cocaine, and then took Landry to a nearby vacant house where\ndefendant shot Landry in the back of the head in a cold-blooded execution-style murder.\nDefendant then committed additional violent crimes over the next two days and used Landry’s\nvehicle as a getaway car. Defendant had more than ample opportunity to abandon his criminal\nacts during the many hours that he held Landry captive and used his money before killing him in\na brutal fashion. Given defendant’s extensive participation in these disturbing criminal acts and\nthe absence of any family or peer pressure on defendant, the trial court did not err in heavily\nweighing this factor against defendant and concluding that it did not favor mitigation.\n\n         The next Miller factor is whether defendant “might have been charged and convicted of a\nlesser offense if not for incompetencies associated with youth—for example, his inability to deal\nwith police officers or prosecutors (including on a plea agreement) or his incapacity to assist his\nown attorneys.” Miller, 132 S Ct at 2468. The trial court correctly noted that there is no\nevidence of any incapacities of youth that rendered defendant unable to participate in his defense\nor that led him to implicate himself. This factor therefore did not weigh in favor of mitigation.\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f        The final factor is the possibility of rehabilitation suggested by the circumstances.\nMiller, 132 S Ct at 2468. Dr. Keating explained that a person’s prospects for rehabilitation are\nassociated with his or her developmental history. Negative experiences and behaviors during a\nperson’s developmental period increase the probability that the person will not succeed in rising\nabove difficulties. Some people do not change; the worse the circumstances, the more likely that\nthe person will not overcome their circumstances. Greater rehabilitation challenges exist for\nsomeone who purposely shot another.\n\n        Dr. Lyle Danuloff, a clinical psychologist who met with defendant for more than four\nhours over three different visits, explained that when defendant committed the crimes in this\ncase, he was unattached in human relationships, living on the streets, and living an amoral life\n“with the sense of what do I need and what do I need to do to get my needs met. He lived in the\nmoment and did not live with any sense of right and wrong.” When defendant committed the\ncrimes, he was AWOL from his last placement, running the streets with other young people,\nconsuming marijuana, selling drugs, and lacking any personhood in terms of relating to other\npeople as fellow human beings rather than objects to meet his needs. Dr. Danuloff thinks that\ndefendant has experienced turning points in his development. Defendant “got lucky” because he\nwas placed in segregation where he is alone in his cell 23 hours a day and because he learned\nabout the Miller decision, so he now has a hope of someday obtaining a parole hearing. While\nalone in his cell, defendant began to read the Bible and other books to learn how people treat one\nanother and the difference between righteousness and evil. Dr. Danuloff opined that the\npossibility of a parole hearing motivated defendant to begin to explore himself and try to\nunderstand who he is, what he did, and why he did it. In Dr. Danuloff’s view, defendant is\nbeginning to have a very primitive and embryonic capacity to explore himself and ask questions\nabout himself. Defendant stopped getting misconduct tickets in prison. Defendant also became\na prison barber and a representative of his prison housing unit.\n\n        Dr. Danuloff testified that defendant said that “[e]ven a Godly person can punish people\nwho bring harm to them. Even God did this.” When asked whether what he did in this case was\nrighteous or evil, defendant said that “it was a little bit of both.” Defendant explained, “[W]ell, I\ndidn’t have any choice. It’s how I was, it’s how I lived, it’s how I behaved.” Defendant said, “I\ncouldn’t think of anything else to do. I was in a situation and I had to get—and I had to take care\nof the situation I was in.” When asked how his actions were evil, defendant said that he hurt\npeople badly, which indicates to Dr. Danuloff “the embryonic development of personhood.” Dr.\nDanuloff thinks defendant is in the rudimentary stages of growing up by using people like Jesus\nand Muhammad as teachers and internalizing what he reads. Dr. Danuloff indicated that there is\nno way for a psychologist to predict how a person will behave in the future.\n\n       On cross-examination, Dr. Danuloff acknowledged that people normally cannot fix\npsychological problems by themselves and that psychotherapy is needed. Psychotherapy\nrequires introspection and a willingness to work on oneself. Dr. Danuloff agreed that he saw\ndefendant in the structured prison setting years after the crimes were committed and that he\ncannot say what defendant would be like if released.\n\n        The trial court correctly concluded that this factor did not favor mitigation. Although the\ndifficulty of defendant’s upbringing weighs in his favor, it also indicates that he faces significant\nchallenges in improving himself, as reflected in the testimony of Dr. Keating and Dr. Danuloff.\n\n                                                -6-\n\fWe share the trial court’s concern about defendant’s comments to Dr. Danuloff reflecting that\ndefendant thinks his actions in this case were partially righteous and that he did not have a\nchoice. As discussed, defendant had more than ample opportunity to abandon his criminal\nactivity in the many hours that he held Landry captive before brutally killing him. Hence,\ndefendant’s abhorrent belief that his actions were partially righteous and that he had no choice\nbut to behave as he did, despite the horrific nature of his criminal acts committed over an\nextended period of time, indicates that defendant’s prospects for rehabilitation are extremely\nremote or nonexistent. Defendant continued engaging in assaultive behavior after being\nincarcerated for the present offenses. He assaulted or attempted to assault staff personnel at the\nMacomb County Jail several times. After being transferred to prison, defendant incurred 23\nmisconduct tickets. Four of the tickets were for fighting, two were for engaging in threatening\nbehavior, two were for possessing a weapon, one was for assault and battery of another prisoner,\nand another one was for assault resulting in serious physical injury to another prisoner. The fact\nthat defendant stopped misbehaving in prison after learning of Miller does not necessarily reflect\na rudimentary moral awakening, as Dr. Danuloff claimed. Defendant’s improved behavior is just\nas, if not more, likely to reflect manipulation designed to obtain a lesser sentence, as the trial\ncourt found. This conclusion is also consistent with defendant’s earlier diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder and the manipulative behaviors associated with that condition. Dr. Danuloff\ntestified that persons diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder do not generally participate\nin psychotherapy unless mandated to do so and that the prognosis for such mandatory treatment\nis not positive. Moreover, even if defendant is beginning to exhibit a very rudimentary or\nembryonic capacity for self-exploration, we note Dr. Danuloff’s testimony supports the trial\ncourt’s conclusion that defendant is unlikely to make significant progress without intensive\nprofessional assistance, and no basis exists to conclude that he will receive intensive professional\nassistance in prison and achieve full rehabilitation. The trial court properly concluded that\ndefendant’s prospects for rehabilitation are negligible.\n\n       Overall, our review of the record indicates that the trial court accurately analyzed each of\nthe Miller factors and correctly concluded that defendant is the rare juvenile offender whose\ncrime reflects irreparable corruption. The trial court therefore did not abuse its discretion in\ndetermining that defendant should be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\n\n        Defendant next argues that the trial court erred in failing to empanel a jury at the Miller\nresentencing hearing.

App.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20; 877 NW2d 482 (2015), rejected by Hyatt, ___\nMich App at ___; slip op at 21, the majority of a panel of this Court held “that the Sixth\nAmendment mandates that juveniles convicted of homicide who face the possibility of a\nsentence of life without the possibility of parole have a right to have their sentences determined\nby a jury.” In People v Perkins, ___ Mich App ___, ___; ___ NW2d ___ (2016) (Docket Nos.\n323454, 323876, 325741); vacated in part by People v Perkins, unpublished order of the Court of\nAppeals, entered February 12, 2016 (Docket Nos. 323454, 323876, 325741), and superseded in\npart by Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 1, 21, another panel of this Court followed\n\n                                                -7-\n\fSkinner only because it was obligated to do so, MCR 7.215(J)(2), and stated its opinion that\nSkinner was wrongly decided. In Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op at 21, a conflict panel of\nthis Court3 rejected the analysis in Skinner and expressed agreement with the original panel in\nPerkins. The Hyatt conflict panel summarized its analysis as follows:\n\n               In sum, we find that Miller’s individualized sentencing mandate, as\n       incorporated by MCL 769.25, does not run afoul of Sixth Amendment precedent.\n       A judge, not a jury, is to make the determination of whether to impose a life-\n       without-parole sentence or a term-of-years sentence under MCL 769.25.\n       Accordingly, we reject the result reached in Skinner and conclude that the prior\n       panel in this case was correct in its analysis. [Hyatt, ___ Mich App at ___; slip op\n       at 21.]\n\nTherefore, the trial court in this case did not err by failing to empanel a jury at the Miller hearing\nbecause the conflict panel in Hyatt rejected the portion of Skinner on which defendant relies.\n\n       We affirm.\n\n                                                              /s/ Jane E. Markey\n                                                              /s/ Michael J. Riordan\n\n\n\n\n3\n Before the issuance of the conflict panel’s opinion in Hyatt, the conflict panel issued an order\nvacating an earlier order that had consolidated Perkins, Hyatt, and another case, so that only\nHyatt proceeded before the conflict panel. See People v Perkins, unpublished order of the Court\nof Appeals, issued April 26, 2016 (Docket Nos. 323454, 323876, 325741). That is why the\nconflict panel’s opinion was decided under a different case name.\n\n\n                                                 -8-\n\f</pre>",
