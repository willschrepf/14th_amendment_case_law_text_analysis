Because we conclude the trial court erred in failing to\n\ndecide the substantive legal issue presented by the competing summary judgment motions, we\n\nreverse and remand for further proceedings in the trial court.\n\f                                                                                    04-11-00076-CV\n\n\n                           BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n       Dora Gulley made a claim under her homeowners insurance policy for damage caused by\n\nfoundation movement resulting from a below-slab plumbing leak. State Farm found the damage\n\nwas covered under the Dwelling Foundation Endorsement to the policy which covered “settling,\n\ncracking, shrinking, bulging, or expansion of the foundation . . . caused by . . . leakage of water\n\n. . . within a plumbing . . . system;” therefore, Gulley’s claim was subject to the endorsement’s\n\n15% coverage limitation. Gulley accepted the payment, but later sued State Farm for breach of\n\ncontract contending she was entitled to additional benefits under a different policy endorsement\n\nshe had purchased, the Water Damage Endorsement which covered “deterioration . . . caused by\n\nthe continuous or repeated . . . leakage of water . . . from a plumbing system.”\n\n       Both parties filed competing summary judgment motions asserting their particular\n\ninterpretation of the endorsements to the insurance policy was conclusively established as a\n\nmatter of law. Plaintiff Gulley filed a traditional motion for partial summary judgment asserting\n\nthe damage was covered under the Water Damage Endorsement, as well as the Dwelling\n\nFoundation Endorsement under which she had already recovered. State Farm filed a cross-\n\nmotion for traditional summary judgment asserting the damage was covered under only the\n\nDwelling Foundation Endorsement, and was therefore subject to the 15% cap. State Farm’s\n\nmotion also included a no-evidence portion with respect to Gulley’s claim for additional living\n\nexpenses.\n\n       On July 10, 2009, the trial court signed a general order denying both summary judgment\n\nmotions. Thereafter, Gulley filed a second motion for partial summary judgment with additional\n\nevidence, and State Farm filed a motion to reconsider its cross-motion for summary judgment as\n\nwell as a new “Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Actual Injury Rule, Non-Fortuitous\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                      04-11-00076-CV\n\n\nLoss, and Non-Segregation of Claimed Damage.” After hearing arguments, the trial court signed\n\na general order denying all the motions on June 9, 2010. Both parties then filed motions to\n\nreconsider their summary judgment motions.\n\n        On January 12, 2011, the trial judge signed an order stating that, upon reconsideration,\n\nthe court was still of the same opinion and ruled that both parties’ summary judgment motions\n\nwere denied. Within the same written order, the court authorized an immediate interlocutory\n\nappeal under section 51.014(d). Section 51.014(d) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode authorizes, under certain circumstances, an interlocutory appeal of an order in a civil case\n\nthat would not otherwise be appealable on an accelerated basis. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 51.014(d). Under subsection (d), a trial court may issue a written order for a permissive\n\ninterlocutory appeal in a civil action if: (1) the parties agree that the order involves a controlling\n\nquestion of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion; (2) an\n\nimmediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the\n\nlitigation; and (3) the parties agree to the order. Id. The trial court’s order recited that all three\n\ncriteria were met in this case.\n\n        The parties and trial court agreed in the order that the following was a “controlling\n\nquestion of law” on which there is “substantial ground for difference of opinion” and that “an\n\nimmediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the\n\nlitigation:”\n\n        Whether damage to walls, floors, roofs or ceilings caused solely by foundation\n        movement resulting from a below-slab plumbing leak is covered under either the\n        Dwelling Foundation Endorsement (to Plaintiff’s Homeowners Policy) or the\n        Policy’s Water Damage Endorsement.\n\nThe parties and trial court have jointly presented this controlling legal question to us, and agree\n\nthat the choice to apply “either the Dwelling Foundation Endorsement . . . or the Policy’s Water\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                                                                  04-11-00076-CV\n\n\nDamage Endorsement” (emphasis added) is the controlling legal issue in the case, resolution of\n\nwhich will materially advance termination of the litigation. Based on the parties’ stipulation to\n\nthe “controlling legal question,” and the trial court’s endorsement of the controlling legal\n\nquestion, we must assume there is no disputed issue of material fact that would preclude\n\nsummary judgment. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\n       Generally, an order denying a summary judgment motion is not appealable because it is\n\nan interlocutory order and not a final judgment. Humphreys v. Caldwell, 888 S.W.2d 469, 470\n\n(Tex. 1994). It is well-settled that an interlocutory order that does not dispose of all issues\n\nagainst all parties is not immediately appealable, except in narrow situations expressly\n\nauthorized by statute. Gross v. Innes, 988 S.W.2d 727, 729 (Tex. 1998) (per curiam); Jack B.\n\nAnglin Co., Inc. v. Tipps, 842 S.W.2d 266, 272 (Tex. 1992). Section 51.014 designates the civil\n\norders that may be appealed on an interlocutory basis, and is strictly construed. TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014; Bally Total Fitness Corp. v. Jackson, 53 S.W.3d 352, 355 (Tex.\n\n2001). Subsection (d) of section 51.014 permits an agreed interlocutory appeal of otherwise un-\n\nappealable orders, including the denial of a summary judgment motion, upon the trial court’s\n\ncertification of the statutory requirements, i.e., an agreed controlling question of law on which\n\nthere is substantial ground for disagreement and on which an immediate appeal may materially\n\nadvance the ultimate resolution of the case. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(d).\n\n\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\f                                                                                               04-11-00076-CV\n\n\n        Here, the court’s orders 1 being appealed denied both parties’ cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment grounded on competing interpretations of the insurance policy’s endorsements. In its\n\nJanuary 12, 2011 order reconsidering and again denying the competing summary judgment\n\nmotions, the court expressly stated that it was not making a substantive decision as to which\n\ninterpretation of the policy’s endorsements was correct, even though in the same order it\n\nstipulated that the “controlling legal question” was which one of two possible interpretations was\n\ncorrect as a matter of law. Specifically, the court stated,\n\n        [I]n the parties’ motions for summary judgment, Plaintiff and Defendant argued\n        the Dwelling Foundation Endorsement and the Water Damage Endorsement\n        should be interpreted as a matter of law. The Court, in entering the Orders\n        denying the motions for summary judgment, declined to adopt any\n        interpretation of the Policy’s Dwelling Foundation Endorsement or the Policy’s\n        Water Damage Endorsement.\n\n(emphasis added). If, as represented by the parties and the court in the agreed “controlling legal\n\nquestion” presented on appeal, there are no disputed fact issues, then one or the other of the\n\ncompeting interpretations of the policy endorsements had to be correct “as a matter of law.” See\n\nNat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Crocker, 246 S.W.3d 603, 606 (Tex. 2008) (an insurance policy is\n\ninterpreted according to contract law principles).            By failing to decide which endorsement\n\napplied, the trial court failed to comply with its duty to rule on the substantive legal issue, instead\n\nopting to ask this Court to make the initial “matter of law” decision through an agreed\n\ninterlocutory appeal. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c) (“The judgment sought shall be rendered\n\nforthwith if . . . [the summary judgment evidence] show[s] that . . . there is no genuine issue as to\n\n\n\n\n1\n  The trial court authorized this immediate appeal from “the Orders denying the motions for summary judgment,”\nwhich includes the July 10, 2009 order denying the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment, the June 9, 2010\norder denying Gulley’s second summary judgment motion and State Farm’s motion to reconsider its original cross-\nmotion for summary judgment, and the January 12, 2011 order reconsidering and again denying the summary\njudgment motions.\n\n                                                     -5-\n\f                                                                                      04-11-00076-CV\n\n\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issues\n\nexpressly set out in the motion . . . .”).\n\n        Under our reading of the statute, section 51.014(d) does not contemplate use of an\n\nimmediate appeal as a mechanism to present, in effect, a “certified question” to this Court similar\n\nto the procedure used by federal appellate courts in certifying a determinative question of state\n\nlaw to the Texas Supreme Court. See, e.g., TEX. R. APP. P. 58.1 (permitting Texas Supreme\n\nCourt to answer certified questions of state law from federal appellate courts); Fin. Indus. Corp.\n\nv. XL Specialty Ins. Co., 285 S.W.3d 877, 877-79 (Tex. 2009) (answering a certified\n\n“determinative question” of state law from the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth\n\nCircuit). We have found no reported case in which section 51.014(d) was used in this manner to\n\npresent an intermediate court of appeals with a “controlling legal question” prior to the trial court\n\nmaking a substantive ruling on the legal issue.\n\n        The legislature’s institution of the procedure authorizing a trial court to certify an\n\nimmediate appeal of an interlocutory order was premised on the trial court having first made a\n\nsubstantive ruling on the controlling legal issue being appealed. See House Comm. on Civil\n\nPractices, Bill Analysis, Tex. H.B. 978, 77th Leg., R.S. (2001) (explaining that the addition of\n\nsubsection (d) would promote judicial efficiency by “allowing the trial court to certify a question\n\nfor appeal” when “the trial court rules on an issue that is pivotal in a case but about which there\n\nis legitimate disagreement”).       The following cases illustrate the intended use of section\n\n51.014(d), in situations where the trial court has made a substantive ruling on a pivotal issue of\n\nlaw. See, e.g., Kimbrell v. Molinet, 288 S.W.3d 464, 465-66 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2008),\n\naff’d, No. 09-0544, 2011 WL 182230 (Tex. Jan. 21, 2011) (addressing agreed interlocutory\n\nappeal from trial court’s denial of a summary judgment motion asserting physician-defendant’s\n\n\n\n                                                  -6-\n\f                                                                                     04-11-00076-CV\n\n\njoinder in medical malpractice case was barred by limitations, and determining the controlling\n\nquestion of law as to which statute of limitations applied); Northside Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Dubose,\n\nNo. 04-06-00517-CV, 2007 WL 1481661, at *1 (Tex. App.—San Antonio May 23, 2007, no\n\npet.) (mem. op.) (on cross-motions for summary judgment the trial court held that school district\n\nhad waived its right to contest compensability of employee’s workers’ compensation claim, and\n\nthereafter certified the issue of waiver as the controlling question on agreed interlocutory\n\nappeal); Stolte v. County of Guadalupe, No. 04-04-00083-CV, 2004 WL 2597443 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio 2004, no pet.) (agreed interlocutory appeal from denial of summary judgment in\n\nwhich trial court concluded county had inherent authority to reject plat application in the interest\n\nof public health); Enterprise Products Partners, L.P. v. Mitchell, No. 01-09-00653-CV, 2011\n\nWL 693700 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] Feb. 10, 2011, no pet. h.) (trial court ruled Texas,\n\nnot Mississippi, law applied to lawsuit and certified choice of law question as the controlling\n\nlegal question for agreed interlocutory appeal); Comcast Cable of Plano, Inc. v. City of Plano,\n\n315 S.W.3d 673 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2010, no pet.) (on agreed interlocutory appeal, court of\n\nappeals addressed the controlling question of law as to whether the city’s claim for breach of a\n\nfranchise agreement was preempted by federal law after trial court denied Comcast’s summary\n\njudgment motion based on preemption).\n\n       Here, although the trial court ministerially ruled on the competing summary judgment\n\nmotions by denying them both, it expressly declined to make a substantive decision on the\n\n“matter of law” interpretation of the policy. Section 51.014(d) is not intended to relieve the trial\n\ncourt of its role in deciding substantive issues of law properly presented to it. Given the\n\nstipulation by the parties and trial court that the competing summary judgment motions turned on\n\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\f                                                                                                    04-11-00076-CV\n\n\na pure question of law as to whether the Water Damage Endorsement applies, we conclude the\n\ntrial court erred in declining to decide the substantive legal issue presented by this appeal. 2\n\n         Accordingly, we reverse and remand to the trial court for it to make a substantive\n\ndecision on the “matter of law” question presented by the parties’ competing summary judgment\n\nmotions.\n\n                                                               Phylis J. Speedlin, Justice\n\n\n\n\n2\n Despite the unusual use of the statute in this appeal, it appears from the record that the statutory requirements for\nan agreed interlocutory appeal have technically been met. See TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(d).\nTherefore, we do have jurisdiction over this appeal.\n\n                                                        -8-\n\f",

Thereafter, Gulley filed a second motion for partial summary judgment with additional\n\nevidence, and State Farm filed a motion to reconsider its cross-motion for summary judgment as\n\nwell as a new “Motion for Summary Judgment Regarding Actual Injury Rule, Non-Fortuitous\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f                                                                                      04-11-00076-CV\n\n\nLoss, and Non-Segregation of Claimed Damage.” After hearing arguments, the trial court signed\n\na general order denying all the motions on June 9, 2010. Both parties then filed motions to\n\nreconsider their summary judgment motions.\n\n        On January 12, 2011, the trial judge signed an order stating that, upon reconsideration,\n\nthe court was still of the same opinion and ruled that both parties’ summary judgment motions\n\nwere denied. Within the same written order, the court authorized an immediate interlocutory\n\nappeal under section 51.014(d). Section 51.014(d) of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode authorizes, under certain circumstances, an interlocutory appeal of an order in a civil case\n\nthat would not otherwise be appealable on an accelerated basis. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE\n\nANN. § 51.014(d). Under subsection (d), a trial court may issue a written order for a permissive\n\ninterlocutory appeal in a civil action if: (1) the parties agree that the order involves a controlling\n\nquestion of law as to which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion; (2) an\n\nimmediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the\n\nlitigation; and (3) the parties agree to the order. Id. The trial court’s order recited that all three\n\ncriteria were met in this case.\n\n        The parties and trial court agreed in the order that the following was a “controlling\n\nquestion of law” on which there is “substantial ground for difference of opinion” and that “an\n\nimmediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the\n\nlitigation:”\n\n        Whether damage to walls, floors, roofs or ceilings caused solely by foundation\n        movement resulting from a below-slab plumbing leak is covered under either the\n        Dwelling Foundation Endorsement (to Plaintiff’s Homeowners Policy) or the\n        Policy’s Water Damage Endorsement.\n\nThe parties and trial court have jointly presented this controlling legal question to us, and agree\n\nthat the choice to apply “either the Dwelling Foundation Endorsement . . . or the Policy’s Water\n\n                                                 -3-\n\f                                                                                  04-11-00076-CV\n\n\nDamage Endorsement” (emphasis added) is the controlling legal issue in the case, resolution of\n\nwhich will materially advance termination of the litigation. Based on the parties’ stipulation to\n\nthe “controlling legal question,” and the trial court’s endorsement of the controlling legal\n\nquestion, we must assume there is no disputed issue of material fact that would preclude\n\nsummary judgment. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 166a(c).\n\n                                           ANALYSIS\n\n       Generally, an order denying a summary judgment motion is not appealable because it is\n\nan interlocutory order and not a final judgment.

Section 51.014 designates the civil\n\norders that may be appealed on an interlocutory basis, and is strictly construed. TEX. CIV. PRAC.\n\n& REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014; Bally Total Fitness Corp. v.

Subsection (d) of section 51.014 permits an agreed interlocutory appeal of otherwise un-\n\nappealable orders, including the denial of a summary judgment motion, upon the trial court’s\n\ncertification of the statutory requirements, i.e., an agreed controlling question of law on which\n\nthere is substantial ground for disagreement and on which an immediate appeal may materially\n\nadvance the ultimate resolution of the case. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 51.014(d).\n\n\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\f                                                                                               04-11-00076-CV\n\n\n        Here, the court’s orders 1 being appealed denied both parties’ cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment grounded on competing interpretations of the insurance policy’s endorsements. In its\n\nJanuary 12, 2011 order reconsidering and again denying the competing summary judgment\n\nmotions, the court expressly stated that it was not making a substantive decision as to which\n\ninterpretation of the policy’s endorsements was correct, even though in the same order it\n\nstipulated that the “controlling legal question” was which one of two possible interpretations was\n\ncorrect as a matter of law. Specifically, the court stated,\n\n        [I]n the parties’ motions for summary judgment, Plaintiff and Defendant argued\n        the Dwelling Foundation Endorsement and the Water Damage Endorsement\n        should be interpreted as a matter of law. The Court, in entering the Orders\n        denying the motions for summary judgment, declined to adopt any\n        interpretation of the Policy’s Dwelling Foundation Endorsement or the Policy’s\n        Water Damage Endorsement.\n\n(emphasis added). If, as represented by the parties and the court in the agreed “controlling legal\n\nquestion” presented on appeal, there are no disputed fact issues, then one or the other of the\n\ncompeting interpretations of the policy endorsements had to be correct “as a matter of law.” See\n\nNat’l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Crocker, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1402084\"><a href=\"/opinion/1402084/national-union-fire-ins-v-crocker/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">603</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 606 (Tex. 2008) (an insurance policy is\n\ninterpreted according to contract law principles).            By failing to decide which endorsement\n\napplied, the trial court failed to comply with its duty to rule on the substantive legal issue, instead\n\nopting to ask this Court to make the initial “matter of law” decision through an agreed\n\ninterlocutory appeal.

See, e.g., TEX. R. APP. P. 58.1 (permitting Texas Supreme\n\nCourt to answer certified questions of state law from federal appellate courts); Fin. Indus. Corp.\n\nv. XL Specialty Ins.

We have found no reported case in which section 51.014(d) was used in this manner to\n\npresent an intermediate court of appeals with a “controlling legal question” prior to the trial court\n\nmaking a substantive ruling on the legal issue.\n\n        The legislature’s institution of the procedure authorizing a trial court to certify an\n\nimmediate appeal of an interlocutory order was premised on the trial court having first made a\n\nsubstantive ruling on the controlling legal issue being appealed.

The following cases illustrate the intended use of section\n\n51.014(d), in situations where the trial court has made a substantive ruling on a pivotal issue of\n\nlaw. See, e.g., Kimbrell v.
