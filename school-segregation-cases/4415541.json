We affirm.\n\n\n                                              1\n\fI.     BACKGROUND\n\n{2}     We divide our narrative of the facts into two parts: (A) facts relevant to Defendant’s\nmotion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, and (B) facts relevant to Defendant’s challenge\nto the sufficiency of the evidence in support of his conviction for conspiracy to commit\nforgery. We adopt the district court’s findings of fact with respect to its denial of\nDefendant’s speedy trial motion to the extent its findings are supported by substantial\nevidence. State v. Spearman, 2012-NMSC-023, ¶ 19, 283 P.3d 272. Similarly, we recite the\nfacts relevant to Defendant’s sufficiency of the evidence challenge to his conviction in the\nlight most favorable to the jury’s guilty verdict. See State v. Chavez, 2009-NMSC-035, ¶ 11,\n146 N.M. 434, 211 P.3d 891.\n\nA.     Facts Relevant to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss on Speedy Trial Grounds\n\n{3}    On November 12, 2010, the State filed a criminal complaint in magistrate court\ncharging Defendant with four counts of forgery in violation of NMSA 1978, Section 30-16-\n10(A), (B) (2006). Defendant was arrested on November 19, 2010. On December 9, 2010,\nDefendant was charged in district court by grand jury indictment of four counts of forgery\nand one count of conspiracy to commit forgery. The State dismissed the magistrate court\ncase without prejudice the following day.\n\n{4}     Defendant was arraigned on the district court criminal complaint on December 27,\n2010. The district court set Defendant’s bond at $15,000. On January 21, 2011, Aric\nElsenheimer, Defendant’s public defender, filed an entry of appearance and request for\ndiscovery, as well as a demand for speedy trial. On February 21, 2011, Mr. Elsenheimer filed\na written motion for a reduction of Defendant’s bond.\n\n{5}    On February 25, 2011, the State moved to join Defendant’s case with pending cases\nagainst his two alleged co-conspirators. The district court entered notices scheduling a\nhearing on the State’s joinder motion and Defendant’s motion to reduce bond for April 7,\n2011. On April 4, 2011, for reasons unexplained in the record, the district court vacated the\nmotion hearing.\n\n{6}      On May 2, 2011, Pedro Pineda filed an entry of appearance on Defendant’s behalf.\n(Mr. Elsenheimer did not file a motion to withdraw or substitute, but it appears that this was\nthe effect of Mr. Pineda’s entry of appearance because Mr. Elsenheimer did not participate\nin the case from this point onward.) On July 25, 2011, Defendant posted bond and was\nreleased from incarceration. On August 22, 2011, the district court entered a notice\nscheduling a jury trial for Defendant’s charges on October 4, 2011. On September 29, 2011,\nthe State filed a motion to continue the October 4, 2011, trial referencing its pending motion\nto join Defendant’s case with one of his alleged co-conspirator’s. The motion stated that\n“Defense counsel, [Mr.] Pineda, does not oppose this [m]otion.” On September 30, 2011, the\ndistrict court granted the State’s motion to continue and vacated the October 4, 2011, trial\nsetting.\n\n                                              2\n\f{7}    On February 2, 2012, the State filed a request for a hearing on its motion to join. A\nhearing on the motion was scheduled to take place on February 15, 2012, and on February\n16, 2012, the State filed an amended motion to join that sought to join Defendant’s case with\nthe case against only one of Defendant’s alleged co-conspirators, Richard M. Tow.1\nDefendant’s attorney did not oppose the motion. On February 17, 2012, the district court\nentered an order joining Defendant’s case with Mr. Tow’s. On March 13, 2012, the district\ncourt entered a notice setting a jury trial for April 26, 2012.\n\n{8}     On April 11, 2012, Defendant filed a pro se motion to dismiss counsel. In the motion,\nDefendant asserted that his attorney, Mr. Pineda, had failed to communicate with him and\nthat his right to a speedy trial had been violated. Defendant noted “[m]y trial is [set for] the\n26th of April, and I need an [a]ttorney to prepare for my trial because I am innocent and I\nam taking this case to trial.” Defendant’s motion was mailed to the district court in an\nenvelope that listed the Luna County Detention Center as a return address. On April 13,\n2012, the district court scheduled a hearing on Defendant’s pro se motion to take place on\nApril 19, 2012.\n\n{9}     On April 18, 2012, Defendant’s attorney filed a motion to withdraw. In it, Mr. Pineda\nasserted that Defendant’s pro se motion to dismiss him as his attorney had caused “the\nattorney client relationship [to] deteriorate[] beyond repair[.]” Mr. Pineda argued that\nDefendant’s assertion that he had never met or communicated with his attorney was refuted\nby the fact that the arguments in his motion to dismiss counsel were based on information\nthat could only be gleaned from discovery that the State had provided to Mr. Pineda, which\nMr. Pineda had in turn provided to Defendant. Mr. Pineda asserted that Defendant had been\narrested for a probation violation on September 8, 2011, and again released on October 13,\n2011, but had failed to comply with a condition of release requiring him to stay in contact\nwith his attorney. Mr. Pineda also stated that Defendant was arrested for another probation\nviolation on February 14, 2012, and that “he has been incarcerated ever since.” Mr. Pineda\nexplained that Defendant’s dissatisfaction with Mr. Pineda likely stemmed from his being\n“very unhappy” with the State’s plea offer, which Mr. Pineda had conveyed to Defendant.\nFinally, Mr. Pineda stated that “Defendant . . . [has] consulted with local attorney Mike\nLilley, [and] Mr. Lilley told [Defendant] he would sue me and he would take over\n[Defendant’s] criminal case as well.”\n\n{10} On April 19, 2012, Defendant, again pro se, filed a motion for setting and telephonic\nhearing, in which he asserted that the indictment against him should be dismissed for “due\nprocess” and speedy trial violations. The district court held a hearing on April 20, 2012. At\nthe beginning of the hearing, Defendant explained that he had filed a separate motion for a\n\n\n       1\n         Although this information is not part of the record, Defendant represents in his brief\nin chief that the reason the State no longer sought to join his case with the other alleged co-\nconspirator’s case was because that co-conspirator had pleaded guilty to the charges against\nher.\n\n                                               3\n\ftelephonic hearing because he lived in Deming, New Mexico. Defendant also admitted that\nhe had in fact met with Mr. Pineda once.\n\n{11} Defendant disputed that he had hired another attorney to replace and sue Mr. Pineda,\nexplaining that Mr. Pineda’s assertion in his motion to withdraw must have been the result\nof a “misunderstanding.” In response, Mr. Pineda called his assistant to give testimony as\na witness. Mr. Pineda’s assistant testified that she had only spoken to Defendant once, when\nDefendant had called from jail to say that he planned to hire Mr. Lilley to sue Mr. Pineda for\nunstated reasons and to represent Defendant in his criminal case.\n\n{12} The prosecutor explained that the State’s primary concern was how the delay that\nwould result from granting Defendant’s motion to dismiss his attorney would be assigned\nfor speedy trial purposes. Notwithstanding these concerns, the district court granted\nDefendant’s motion to dismiss counsel and Mr. Pineda’s motion to withdraw. The district\ncourt stated that “it appears to this court that the parties will not be prepared for trial” and\ndirected Mr. Pineda to prepare form orders granting each motion and continuing the trial.\nThe district court asked Defendant personally whether he approved the “form” of the orders,\nand Defendant orally did so.\n\n{13} On May 11, 2012, the district court entered orders granting Defendant’s oral motion\nto continue, his motion to dismiss counsel, and Mr. Pineda’s motion to withdraw as counsel.\nThe district court reset Defendant’s jury trial for July 31, 2012. On June 11, 2012,\nDefendant’s replacement contract defender, Peter Giovannini, filed a notice of appearance,\ndemand for discovery, and a speedy trial demand.\n\n{14} On July 23, 2012, Defendant’s attorney filed a motion to vacate the July 31, 2012,\njury trial. The motion cited Defendant’s confusion as to who in fact was representing him,\nDefendant’s request to take statements by several witnesses for the State and witnesses that\nDefendant intended to call to testify in his defense at trial. The motion stated that\n“[u]ndersigned counsel agrees that any delay arising from this continuance should be\nattributed to the defense for purposes of any speedy trial analysis.” The district court granted\nDefendant’s motion to continue and vacated the July 31, 2012 trial setting, which was reset\nfor October 11, 2012.\n\n{15} On September 25, 2012, Defendant’s attorney filed a motion to vacate the October\n11, 2012, trial setting, stating that Defendant had been released from prison to serve the\nremainder of his sentence at a halfway house, and that “Defendant . . . is unable to\ncommunicate with undersigned counsel regarding [this case] because [he] is fearful that the\n[halfway house] will give him an ‘unsuccessful release’ from the program[,] which will\nviolate his probation.” The motion explained that “if the [halfway house] is aware of pending\ncharges, he will be released from the program.” The motion stated that “[u]ndersigned\ncounsel and Defendant respectfully request that this matter be vacated and rescheduled after\nApril[] 2014 to allow [D]efendant . . . to successfully complete the [halfway house\ns]ubstance [a]buse [t]reatment [p]rogram[.]” The State opposed the motion.\n\n                                               4\n\f{16} On October 3, 2012, the district court held a hearing on Defendant’s motion to\ncontinue. Defendant was not in attendance but his attorney reiterated that Defendant wanted\nto stay the proceedings until after April 2014 in order to allow him an opportunity to\nsuccessfully complete the terms of his probation in an unrelated case. The State explained\nits opposition to the motion, arguing that granting Defendant’s motion to continue would\nraise speedy trial problems and cause “hardship” to the parties. Finally, the State called a\nprobation officer as a witness, who testified that Defendant had left the halfway house\nbecause of a “medical injury.” The witness also testified that he had seen text messages\nDefendant had sent to in September to the mother of Defendant’s son stating that he was “on\nthe run.”\n\n{17} The district court recessed the hearing in order for the attorneys for the State and\nDefendant to attempt to locate Defendant. After the recess, both the State’s attorney and\nDefendant’s attorney said they were unable to locate Defendant, and that he was not at the\nLuna County Detention Center. The district court did not rule on Defendant’s motion to\ncontinue and issued a bench warrant for Defendant’s arrest.\n\n{18} On October 9, 2012, Defendant’s attorney filed another motion to continue. The\nmotion stated that on the same day as the hearing on Defendant’s earlier motion to continue,\n“Defendant . . . contacted [Mr. Giovannini’s] office stating he was release[d] from the\n[halfway house] to have surgery but he would return to the program[.]” The motion also\nstated that “[u]ndersigned counsel agrees that any delay arising from this continuance should\nbe attributed to the defense for purposes of any speedy trial analysis.” The State did not\noppose Defendant’s renewed motion to continue. The district court granted the motion.\n\n{19} On October 29, 2012, the State filed a request for a jury trial setting, and a few days\nlater the district court entered a notice setting trial for December 17, 2012. On November 9,\n2012, the court held a hearing in which it heard from Defendant’s attorney that Defendant\nhad in fact been in custody in another jurisdiction, so the bench warrant for failing to appear\nhad been issued in error. On December 13, 2012, the State moved to review Defendant’s\nconditions of release. The State acknowledged that Defendant was in custody in Deming on\nOctober 3, 2012, when the court held its hearing on Defendant’s earlier motion to continue.\nBut the State contended that Defendant’s conditions of release should be reviewed because\n“Defense counsel . . . has informed the State that . . . Defendant has failed to maintain\ncontact with defense counsel, and there are no assurances that . . . Defendant will appear for\ntrial on the scheduled trial date.” The district court did not hold a hearing or otherwise\ndispose of the State’s motion to review Defendant’s conditions of release. Instead, it appears\nto have simply continued the December 2012 trial setting to April 10, 2013.\n\n{20} On April 9, 2013, the day before trial, Defendant submitted a pro se motion to\ninvestigate and a motion to dismiss. In the motion to dismiss, Defendant made two\narguments: (1) his arrest was unlawful, and (2) his right to a speedy trial had been violated.\nWith respect to his speedy trial claim, Defendant argued that his case was simple and that\nthe nearly two-and-one-half-year delay between his arrest and trial violated his right to a\n\n                                              5\n\fspeedy trial.\n\n{21} The court heard argument on Defendant’s motion to dismiss on the morning of trial\non April 10, 2013. The district court denied Defendant’s motion to dismiss based on an\nunlawful arrest, and Defendant has not appealed that ruling. With respect to the claim that\nhis right to a speedy trial had been violated, Defendant argued that his case was simple and\nthat the length of the delay resulted in a violation of his right to a speedy trial. Defendant’s\nattorney indicated that Defendant’s motion likely did not have any merit because he had\n“absconded” for a significant period of time between his arrest and the trial and, therefore,\nwas himself responsible for much of the delay. Defendant conceded that he had absconded,\nsaying “[y]eah, my mom was really sick.”\n\n{22} After the State’s attorney responded, Defendant’s attorney asked to be allowed to\ncorrect statements he had made earlier. Defendant’s attorney stated:\n\n       [Defendant] felt compelled to leave [the halfway house] because he had to\n       have a surgery. Actually, they asked him to leave because of a medical\n       problem that he had told them about and told them that he needed to get\n       treatment on. So that changes the whole complexion of things.\n\nThe State responded that the halfway house Defendant was living in was a long-term\ninpatient program, which requires its patients to stay for a year to eighteen months. The State\nargued that Defendant “can’t . . . really [have] been planning on going to trial in this case if\nhe . . . [was in] an inpatient program for that length of time. And, again, if he left that\nprogram and ended up with a warrant, that still counts against [D]efendant and counts\nagainst his vigorous assertion of his right to a speedy trial[.]”\n\n{23} The district court orally recited the history of the case and made certain findings of\nfact that we review in greater detail in our discussion of Defendant’s speedy trial argument\nlater in this Opinion. The court found that “most of the delay has been charged to\n[D]efendant; therefore, [the court] denies your motion to dismiss [on speedy trial grounds].”\nAfter trial, the district court entered a written order denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss\nthat again assigned most of the delay to Defendant and additionally found that “Defendant\nhas not vigorously asserted the right to a speedy trial and there is no prejudice to . . .\nDefendant[.]”\n\nB.      Facts Relevant to Defendant’s Sufficiency of the Evidence Argument\n\n{24} Immediately after denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss, the court convened a jury\nvenire, selected a jury, and proceeded to trial.\n\n{25} Clorinda Barela testified that her daughter was living with Defendant in 2010.\nDefendant and her daughter had a son, and in September 2010, Ms. Barela had written a\ncheck for $10 to her grandson in order to purchase candy he was selling for a school\n\n                                               6\n\ffundraiser. Ms. Barela saw that the check she had written was instead cashed for $200 at a\nWalmart. Ms. Barela obtained copies of receipts for the merchandise that had been\npurchased with the check and reported the issue to the police. Ms. Barela learned that her\ndaughter had been identified as one of the individuals who had used the check at the\nWalmart.\n\n{26} Juliet Barela testified that her mother had given her son a check for a fundraiser and\nthat Defendant had erased the amount for which the check was originally made and replaced\nit with $200 or $250. Juliet Barela said that Defendant had given her the check, she went into\nWalmart and purchased items with the check, and then returned the items for cash. Juliet\nBarela testified that she kept $30 of the proceeds, while Defendant kept the rest.\n\n{27} The State presented the testimony of Jack Waggoner. Mr. Waggoner testified that in\nOctober 2010, a check he had written to his telephone company was stolen from the mailbox\nin front of his house. On October 28, 2010, Mr. Waggoner’s wife received a call from a\ncheck cashing business asking her whether her husband had hired anyone to perform work\naround the house for $250. When he went to the check cashing business to investigate, Mr.\nWaggoner was given a check he recognized to be the check he had written to Qwest, but it\nwas made out to a man named Richard Tow. That check was admitted into evidence.\n\n{28} The State also presented the testimony of Velia Hernandez, the clerk at the check\ncashing business Mr. Waggoner had referenced in his direct testimony. Ms. Hernandez\ntestified that on October 28, 2010, a man had attempted to cash a check that she felt did not\nlook “like . . . a legit check.” Ms. Hernandez called 411 to look up the phone number of Mr.\nWaggoner, who was identified on the check as the check’s owner. When she called Mr.\nWaggoner, his wife answered, and told her not to cash the check. Ms. Hernandez then called\nthe police, and the man who had come to cash the check fled.\n\n{29} The State called Mr. Tow to testify. Mr. Tow testified that Defendant had given him\na check for some yard work he had performed for Defendant’s relatives. Mr. Tow testified\nthat he had initially tried to cash the check at a Wells Fargo, but decided to leave because\nthe line for the teller was too long. Mr. Tow testified that he went to a nearby check cashing\nbusiness to try and cash the check. He testified that the cashier appeared to have “a problem\nwith the check. . . . I asked her if there was a problem, and she nodded to me that there was.\nSo I left, went back and got in the vehicle and left. And [Defendant] was very upset with me.\nI remember he yelled at me, told me, well, why the hell did I leave the check there[?]”\n\n{30} Mr. Tow testified that Defendant was an acquaintance. Mr. Tow said that he had let\nDefendant borrow his truck, on the condition that Defendant purchase some new tires for the\ntruck. Mr. Tow testified that Defendant had new tires put on the truck at Walmart and gave\nhim a receipt for the $821.78 purchase. Although Mr. Tow recognized the description of his\nvehicle on the Walmart work order, he did not recognize the name of the person who had\nordered the work, identified as “Marcos Silva.”\n\n\n                                              7\n\f{31} Finally, the State presented the testimony of Las Cruces Police Detective Frank\nTorres. Detective Torres testified that he was contacted by a man named Orton Keats, who\nhad told police that a check he had written to pay a bill had been converted to a higher\namount. Detective Torres was able to verify that Mr. Keats’s check had been used to\npurchase a set of four tires at WalMart for $821.78. Detective Torres also obtained the work\norder from Walmart, which provided a license plate for the vehicle that the tires were\ninstalled on: Mr. Tow’s truck.\n\n{32} Detective Torres also testified that he investigated a police report made by Marcey\nCarter. Detective Torres testified that Ms. Carter had written a check to pay a bill and put\nit into her mailbox for mailing. Ms. Carter discovered that the check had cleared, but for a\ndifferent amount, and had been used at Walmart. Detective Torres obtained surveillance\nfootage from Walmart showing a man wearing white cowboy boots and a Dallas Cowboys\nsweatshirt making a purchase with Ms. Carter’s check. Detective Torres testified that Mr.\nTow had identified Defendant as the man in the surveillance video because Defendant\nalways wears white cowboy boots.\n\n{33} At the close of the State’s case, Defendant moved for a directed verdict on all of the\ncharges against him, which the district court denied. The jury acquitted Defendant of the four\nforgery charges but returned a guilty verdict on the conspiracy to commit forgery charge.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n{34} Defendant raises two arguments on appeal: (A) there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport the jury’s guilty verdict on the indictment’s conspiracy to commit forgery charge,\nand (B) the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy\ntrial grounds. We address each argument in turn.\n\nA.     There Was Sufficient Evidence for a Rational Jury to Conclude That Defendant\n       Had Conspired to Commit Forgery\n\n{35} Defendant’s first issue on appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting the jury’s guilty verdict on the conspiracy to commit forgery charge. When a\ndefendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction, we\nreview the record to determine whether\n\n       sufficient evidence was adduced to support the underlying charge. The test\n       for sufficiency of the evidence is whether substantial evidence of either a\n       direct or circumstantial nature exists to support a verdict of guilt beyond a\n       reasonable doubt with respect to every element essential to a conviction.\n       When considering the sufficiency of the evidence, [an appellate court] does\n       not evaluate the evidence to determine whether some hypothesis could be\n       designed which is consistent with a finding of innocence. Instead, [the\n       reviewing courts] view the evidence as a whole and indulge all reasonable\n\n                                              8\n\f       inferences in favor of the jury’s verdict while at the same time asking\n       whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n       the crime beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\n\nState v. Sena, 2008-NMSC-053, ¶ 10, 144 N.M. 821, 192 P.3d 1198 (internal quotation\nmarks and citations omitted).\n\n{36} Conspiracy consists of “knowingly combining with another for the purpose of\ncommitting a felony within or without [New Mexico].” NMSA 1978, § 30-28-2(A) (1979).\nThe jury was given an instruction modeled after UJI 14-2810 NMRA, the pattern jury\ninstruction for conspiracy. That instruction read as follows:\n\n                 For you to find [D]efendant guilty of conspiracy to commit forgery\n       . . ., the [S]tate must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt\n       each of the following elements of the crime:\n\n              1.      [D]efendant and another person by words or acts agreed\n       together to commit forgery;\n\n              2.      [D]efendant and the other person intended to commit forgery;\n\n            3.      This happened in New Mexico on or between July 1, 2010 and\n       November 1, 2010.\n\n{37} The jury was also given four instructions corresponding to each forgery charge. The\ninstructions stated:\n\n                For you to find [D]efendant guilty of forgery as charged in Count[s\n       1, 2, 3, or 4,] the [S]tate must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable\n       doubt each of the following elements of the crime:\n\n               1.     [D]efendant changed a genuine check so that its effect was\n       different from the original;\n\n              2.     At the time, [D]efendant intended to injure, deceive[,] or cheat\n       [Clarinda Barela, Jack Waggoner, Orton Keats, Marcey Carter,] or another;\n\n            3.      This happened in New Mexico on or between July 1, 2010 and\n       November 1, 2010.\n\nThus, in order for the jury to find Defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit forgery, it\nneeded to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that between July 1 and November 1, 2010,\nDefendant had by words or acts agreed to change a genuine check so that its effect was\ndifferent from the original, with intent to injure Clarinda Barela, Jack Waggoner, Orton\n\n                                             9\n\fKeats, Marcey Carter, or another.\n\n{38} Defendant concedes that the State established beyond a reasonable doubt that “four\npersonal checks belonging to four different people were washed and passed at four different\ntimes[,]” but argues that the “single Walmart image of him leaving the store . . . [at the] time\nof the passing of one check in question and the self-serving statements of two co-defendants”\nwas insufficient to establish that Defendant washed and passed the checks. But the jury need\nnot have been convinced that Defendant was the one who washed or passed checks; it only\nneeded to conclude that Defendant had entered into an agreement with another (presumably\neither Mr. Tow or Juliet Barela) to wash and pass the checks. See, e.g., State v. Olguin, 1994-\nNMCA-050, ¶ 36, 118 N.M. 91, 879 P.2d 92 (“[W]e . . . uphold the conviction for\nconspiracy, notwithstanding that one of the underlying crimes may not have been supported\nby sufficient evidence.”), aff'd in part, set aside in part by 1995-NMSC-077, 120 N.M. 740,\n906 P.2d 731.\n\n{39} Defendant next takes issue with the sufficiency of the State’s proof of an agreement.\nWe note that conspiracies may be (and often are) proven with circumstantial evidence. See\nState v. Sheets, 1981-NMCA-064, ¶ 13, 96 N.M. 75, 628 P.2d 320. Defendant appears to\nacknowledge that the circumstantial evidence alone is enough to resolve this argument\nagainst him because Mr. Tow and Juliet Barela both offered testimony from which a jury\ncould infer the existence of a conspiracy: Mr. Tow’s testimony that Defendant had agreed\nto obtain a new set of tires for Mr. Tow’s truck in exchange for letting Defendant borrow it;\nand Juliet Barela’s testimony that she and Defendant had agreed to wash and use her\nmother’s check at Walmart, sharing the proceeds. By characterizing the testimony of Mr.\nTow and Juliet Barela as “self-serving,” Defendant is in essence conceding that his\nsufficiency of the evidence challenge to his conviction for conspiracy turns on a challenge\nto the jury’s decision to credit the testimony of Mr. Tow and Juliet Barela, a decision which\nwe are powerless to review on appeal. See State v. Nichols, 2006-NMCA-017, ¶ 9, 139 N.M.\n72, 128 P.3d 500; see also State v. Hernandez, 1993-NMSC-007, ¶ 69, 115 N.M. 6, 846 P.2d\n312 (recognizing that the appellate courts’ . . . “duty on appeal is neither to substitute our\njudgment for that of the jury nor reweigh the evidence”). The fact that the jury acquitted\nDefendant of the offenses that formed the object of the charged conspiracy is not controlling\nor determinative. See State v. Armijo, 1931-NMSC-008, ¶ 7, 35 N.M. 533, 2 P.2d 1075 (“It\nis quite possible for [the defendants] to have conspired to commit [larceny], without having\ncommitted, the larceny.”); see also State v. Gilbert, 1982-NMCA-081, ¶ 20, 98 N.M. 77, 644\nP.2d 1066 (recognizing that “the crime of conspiracy is complete when the felonious\nagreement is reached”).\n\n{40} For the foregoing reasons, we reject Defendant’s sufficiency of the evidence\nchallenge to his conviction for conspiracy to commit forgery.\n\nB.     The District Court Did Not Err in Denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss on\n       Speedy Trial Grounds\n\n\n                                              10\n\f{41} The Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution\nprovides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy .\n. . trial[.]” U.S. Const. amend. VI. “The heart of the right to a speedy trial is preventing\nprejudice to the accused.” State v. Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 12, 146 N.M. 499, 212 P.3d\n387. The right to a speedy trial “is unique among the constitutional guarantees afforded a\ncriminal defendant because of the concomitant ‘societal interest in bringing an accused to\ntrial.’ ” State v. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 4, 366 P.3d 1121 (quoting Garza, 2009-NMSC-\n038, ¶ 12). “As a result, merely showing delay in bringing an accused’s case to trial is not\nenough to establish a speedy trial violation; rather, [the appellate courts] must scrutinize\nevery claimed violation to determine whether the accused has suffered an actual and\narticulable deprivation of the right to a speedy trial.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 4 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n{42} We evaluate Defendant’s claim that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was\nviolated using the four factors set out in Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514, 530 (1972): “(1) the\nlength of the delay in bringing the case to trial, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) the\ndefendant’s assertion of the right to a speedy trial; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant\ncaused by the delay.” Id.; see also Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 5.\n\n1.     Length of Delay\n\n{43} “The first factor, the length of delay, has a dual function: it acts as a triggering\nmechanism for considering the four Barker factors if the delay crosses the threshold of being\npresumptively prejudicial, and it is an independent factor to consider in evaluating whether\na speedy trial violation has occurred.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008,¶ 22. As to the first function,\nour Supreme Court “[has] established benchmarks for presumptively prejudicial delay\naccording to the complexity of a case: one year for a simple case, 15 months for a case of\nintermediate complexity, and 18 months for a complex case.” Id. ¶ 22 (citing Garza, 2009-\nNMSC-038, ¶ 48). In this case, the State concedes (and we agree) that the twenty-nine\nmonth, twenty-two day-long delay between Defendant’s arrest and his trial is sufficient to\ntrigger further analysis for a speedy trial violation regardless of the complexity of the case.\n\n{44} As to the second, “independent” function that the first Barker factor performs, our\nSupreme Court has stated that “[t]he length of delay is an objective determination that is\ncapable of measurement with some precision, and once established, it colors the rest of the\nspeedy trial analysis. A delay that crosses the threshold for presumptive prejudice\nnecessarily weighs in favor of the accused; the only question is, how heavily?” Serros, 2016-\nNMSC-008, ¶ 26. Importantly, “the parties’ fault in causing the delay is irrelevant to the\nanalysis” of this factor. Id. “A delay that scarcely crosses the bare minimum needed to\ntrigger judicial examination of the claim is of little help to a defendant claiming a speedy\ntrial violation.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “Conversely, an\nextraordinary delay . . . weighs heavily in favor of a defendant’s speedy trial claim, bearing\nin mind that no single factor is dispositive of whether a violation has occurred.” Id.; See\nGarza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 24.\n\n                                              11\n\f{45} As an initial matter, we note that our Supreme Court in Serros did not explain how\nto determine the difference between a presumptively prejudicial delay that “scarcely crosses\nthe bare minimum needed” and provides “little help to a defendant” versus the additional\nlength of delay that would be considered “extraordinary” and that “weighs heavily in favor\nof a defendant’s speedy trial claim.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In\nSerros, our Supreme Court concluded that weighing the first factor heavily in the\ndefendant’s favor was not a “difficult question” because the fifty-one month long delay\nbetween the defendant’s arrest and the dismissal of his indictment for speedy trial violations\nwas far in excess of the amount needed to create a presumption of prejudice. Id. ¶ 24.\n\n{46} Here, the nearly twenty-nine month delay between Defendant’s arrest and his trial\nis more than the “bare minimum needed” to show presumptive prejudice, but significantly\nshorter than the fifty-one month delay that Serros concluded weighed heavily in the\ndefendant’s favor as a matter of course. Id. ¶ 26 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). Moreover, the district court in this case did not make an express finding as to the\ncomplexity of Defendant’s case. The complexity of this case does not matter to our\ndetermination of presumptive prejudice because the amount of delay is sufficient to trigger\na speedy trial analysis regardless of the case’s complexity. See id. ¶ 23 (concluding the delay\npresumptively prejudicial without determining the case’s complexity). But with respect to\nhow we are to evaluate this length of delay factor, the complexity of this case takes on\nconsiderable importance. If the case is classified as simple, then the delay exceeds the\nthreshold for presumptive prejudice by seventeen months; if intermediate, fourteen; if\ncomplex, only eleven. See id. ¶ 22 (recognizing that the amount of time that must elapse for\ndelay to become presumptively prejudicial is “one year for a simple case, 15 months for a\ncase of intermediate complexity, and 18 months for a complex case” (citing Garza, 2009-\nNMSC-038, ¶ 48)).\n\n{47} The State argues that this is a case of “intermediate” complexity based on “the\nnumber of potential witnesses and scenarios that were involved.” Specifically, the State\nasserts that it was required to prepare for a trial involving testimony of the checks’ owners,\nthe employees of the businesses where Defendant allegedly passed the checks off, records\ncustodians who could lay the foundation for the admission of surveillance camera footage,\nand any law enforcement personnel involved in the investigations that led to Defendant’s\narrest. We agree that the State’s assessment of this case’s complexity is reasonable, and\naccordingly, find that the length of the delay in this case was fourteen months in excess of\nthe amount necessary to trigger judicial scrutiny.\n\n{48} In Serros, our Supreme Court concluded that a fifty-one month delay between the\ndefendant’s arrest and the dismissal of the indictment against him on speedy trial grounds\nwas “extreme” and therefore justified weighing the first Barker factor heavily in the\ndefendant’s favor. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 24. By contrast, in Garza, our Supreme Court\ndetermined that a delay that only exceeded the amount required to trigger further judicial\nanalysis by a month and six days “was not extraordinary and [did] not weigh heavily in [the\nd]efendant’s favor.” Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 24. Here, the delay in this case exceeds the\n\n                                              12\n\famount required to trigger further analysis by fourteen months. This delay is far more than\nthe “bare minimum needed to trigger judicial examination of the claim.” Id. (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that this factor weighs\nheavily in Defendant’s favor.\n\n2.     The Reasons Behind the Delay\n\n{49} The district court found that most of the delay in this case was attributable to\nDefendant. As we have stated above, we give deference to the district court’s finding of fact\nthat Defendant caused most of the delay in this case, to the extent it is supported by\nsubstantial evidence in the record. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 20.\n\n{50} Defendant argues that the State is responsible for twenty-four out of the twenty-nine\nmonths of delay in this case. Defendant asserts that the delay between February 2011 and\nFebruary 2012 was caused by the State’s filing of a motion to join Defendant’s case with that\nof his alleged co-conspirators’ and the district court’s negligent failure to timely rule on the\nmotion. Defendant argues that the State is responsible for another two months of delay\ncaused by its mistaken belief that Defendant had absconded from custody when he was in\nfact in prison, thus causing the district court to issue a bench warrant and continue the\nOctober 2012 trial setting to December 2012. Finally, Defendant argues that he should not\nbe held responsible for the delays between April 2012 and April 2013, which Defendant\nargues was caused by motions to continue filed by his trial counsel which he did not consent\nto filing. We assess and assign responsibility for the delays in this case chronologically.\n\n{51} We agree with Defendant that the delay caused by the State’s motion to join (and the\ndistrict court’s failure to rule on the motion) is properly weighed in Defendant’s favor.\nAccordingly, twelve of the twenty-nine month period of delay in this case weighs in\nDefendant’s favor. In doing so, we reject the State’s argument that the delay should not be\nweighed against it because the motion had merit and was ultimately granted as unopposed\nin modified form. Whatever the merit of the motion, the State’s decision to file it occasioned\nthe district court’s delay until it ruled on the motion. Accordingly, this period of time is\nappropriately weighed more heavily against the State. See Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶¶ 26-\n30 (noting that delays caused by administrative burdens on the court system are typically\nweighed slightly in the defendant’s favor, but the more “protracted” the delay, the more\nheavily it is weighed in the defendant’s favor).\n\n{52} We disagree with Defendant’s assertion that the period of delay from April 2012 to\nApril 2013 is the fault of the State. Defendant argues that he asserted his right to a speedy\ntrial by filing a pro se motion to dismiss his attorney in which he also demanded to proceed\nto trial. We are mindful that the right to a speedy trial and the right to effective assistance\nof counsel are not mutually exclusive. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 81. In this regard, when\nassessing a period of delay caused by a defendant’s pro se motion to discharge his attorney,\nour Supreme Court identified the reasonableness of such a request as the relevant inquiry in\ndetermining whether to assign the resultant delay to the defendant or the state. Id. ¶¶ 53-54.\n\n                                              13\n\fAs we explain below, we think that there is substantial evidence to support the district\ncourt’s finding that Defendant, not his counsel, is responsible for this period of delay.\n\n{53} In his pro se motion to dismiss his attorney, filed about two weeks before the April\n2012 trial setting, Defendant asserted that his attorney was not communicating with him, not\npreparing his case for trial, and not providing him with discovery. But against these\nassertions of fact, Defendant’s attorney said that he had communicated with Defendant, was\npreparing the case for trial, and had provided Defendant with discovery from the State.\nAlthough Mr. Pineda did not submit an affidavit or otherwise testify to his assertions of fact,\nneither did Defendant. Moreover, Mr. Pineda called his administrative assistant to testify that\nDefendant had called and told her that he had obtained another attorney who would be suing\nMr. Pineda and taking over Defendant’s case. Because Defendant had denied making such\nan assertion, Mr. Pineda’s assistant’s testimony undermined Defendant’s credibility and\nprovided the district court with a substantial basis for concluding that Defendant’s effort to\nfire his attorney was a “last-minute plea[] to change counsel [that] should be []viewed\nskeptically[,]” not a reasonable invocation of his right to effective trial counsel. Id. ¶ 53.\nAccordingly, we assign to Defendant the delay caused by the district court’s continuance of\nthe April 26, 2012, trial date to July 31, 2012.\n\n{54} Defendant’s replacement counsel moved to continue the July 31, 2012, trial date\nbased on the need to conduct additional investigation. Defendant’s attorney stated that\nDefendant had been under the mistaken impression that counsel for his co-Defendant, Mr.\nTow, was his attorney, and that this caused several weeks of delay. Once this\nmisunderstanding had been cleared up, Defendant requested that his attorney conduct\nadditional investigation and track down additional witnesses who Defendant wanted to call\nto testify in his defense. Although these requests are hardly unreasonable, it does not follow\nthat any delay that resulted must be weighed against the State. The district court did not err\nin concluding that Defendant should be assigned responsibility for the delay caused by\ncontinuing the July 31, 2012, trial setting to October 11, 2012.\n\n{55} We disagree as well with Defendant that the State caused the delay between October\n2012 and December 2012. This period of delay was not caused by the district court’s\nmistaken issuance of a bench warrant for Defendant’s arrest, as defendant argues; rather, it\nwas caused by Defendant’s attorney filing a motion at Defendant’s behest that trial be\ncontinued until after April 2014 in order to allow Defendant to finish an inpatient treatment\nprogram at a halfway house. It is worth noting that the State opposed Defendant’s motion\nto continue, arguing that granting the motion would create speedy trial concerns. The State\nalso presented evidence at the hearing on the motion that tended to refute Defendant’s claim\nthat he was actually enrolled in an inpatient treatment program. To be sure, confusion over\nDefendant’s location might have caused the district court to mistakenly issue a bench\nwarrant and may have figured into the district court’s decision to delay the trial. But the\noccasion for the delay in the first place was Defendant’s request to continue the trial for\nnearly two years, which the State opposed, and Defendant’s decision to leave the halfway\nhouse to seek medical attention, which contributed to the confusion over Defendant’s\n\n                                              14\n\flocation. We see no error in the district court’s determination that Defendant should be held\nresponsible for this period of delay.\n\n{56} Although the district court did not enter an order or otherwise explain why it was\ncontinuing the December 17, 2012, trial setting, it appears that the reason for the continuance\nwas the State’s December 13, 2012, motion to revoke Defendant’s conditions of release. In\nthat motion, the State stated that it had been told by Defendant’s attorney that “Defendant\nhas failed to maintain contact with defense counsel, and there are no assurances that . . .\nDefendant will appear for trial on the scheduled trial date.” Defendant later conceded on the\nmorning of trial that he had failed to stay in contact with his attorney. Although it is not clear\nwhether Defendant failed to stay in contact with his attorney in order to purposefully delay\nthe December 17, 2012, trial, this evidence provided a sufficient basis for the district court\nto find that Defendant “affirmatively cause[d] or acquiesce[d]” in this period of delay.\nSerros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 74.\n\n{57} In sum, twelve months of the delay in this case can be assigned to the State;\nDefendant caused or acquiesced in the remaining sixteen months’ delay. Since the majority\nof the delay in this case was caused by Defendant, we conclude that application of the\nsecond Barker factor “tip[s] the balance back in favor of the societal interest in bringing [the\nd]efendant to trial” and ultimately weighs in favor of the State. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008,\n¶ 28 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n3.      Defendant’s Assertion of the Right to a Speedy Trial\n\n{58} The third Barker factor looks to “the frequency and force of the objections[,] as\nopposed to attaching significant weight to a purely pro forma objection.” Barker, 407 U.S.\nat 529. The right to a speedy trial is\n\n        fundamental in nature so that a failure to assert [it] does not constitute\n        waiver, but the timeliness and vigor with which the right is asserted may be\n        considered as an indication of whether a defendant was denied needed access\n        to speedy trial over his objection or whether the issue was raised on appeal\n        as [an] afterthought.\n\nGarza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 32.\n\n{59} Here, Defendant argues that the two speedy trial demands filed by his appointed\nattorneys and his pro se invocations of the right to a speedy trial in his first motion to dismiss\nhis attorney, his motion for a telephonic setting, and his motion to dismiss the indictment\nfiled on the eve of trial in April 2013 demonstrate that he frequently and forcefully asserted\nhis right to a speedy trial.\n\n{60} In Garza, our Supreme Court held that the defendant’s single speedy trial demand,\n“preceding his motion to dismiss, tucked within the waiver of arraignment and not guilty\n\n                                               15\n\fplea, was sufficient to assert his right.” Id. ¶ 34. The Court noted that although the\ndefendant’s single invocation of his right to a speedy trial “was not especially vigorous[,]”\nthe fact that the defendant had not otherwise acquiesced in the delay required the third\nBarker factor to be weighed slightly in his favor. Id.\n\n{61} Here, Defendant invoked his right to a speedy trial five times—twice through his\nlawyers, and three times through pro se motions to discharge his attorney, set a telephonic\nhearing, and to dismiss the indictment. Although Defendant invoked his right to a speedy\ntrial many more times than the defendant did in Garza, this fact is mitigated by the context\nof Defendant’s invocations of the right to a speedy trial: as we have explained above,\nDefendant’s first two pro se motions to dismiss were filed on the eve of trial and sought a\nnew attorney as the primary relief. Defendant’s pro se motion to dismiss was likewise filed\non the eve of his April 2013 trial, which ultimately went forward after it was denied. And\nagainst Defendant’s invocations of his right to a speedy trial, Defendant at least once sought\nto delay his trial by more than two years in order to avoid violating his conditions of release\nfor an unrelated criminal conviction.\n\n{62} Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court’s finding that\nDefendant did not frequently or forcefully invoke his right to a speedy trial lacks a\nsubstantial basis. See Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 32 (quoting Sisneros v. State, 121 P.3d\n790, 800 (Wyo. 2005), for the proposition that the third Barker factor should be weighed\nneutrally where the defendant “demanded a speedy trial throughout the proceedings, but\n‘also engaged in procedural maneuvers which had the result of delaying the trial’ ”).\nAccordingly, we cannot reverse the district court’s ultimate finding to weigh the third Barker\nfactor neutrally.\n\n4.     The Prejudice to Defendant Caused by the Delay\n\n{63} The United States Supreme Court in Barker explained the “actual prejudice” prong\nof the constitutional speedy trial analysis as follows:\n\n       Prejudice . . . should be assessed in the light of the interests of [the]\n       defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect. This Court\n       has identified three such interests: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial\n       incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii)\n       to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\n\n407 U.S. at 532; see State v. Maddox, 2008-NMSC-062, ¶ 32, 145 N.M. 242, 195 P.3d 1254,\nabrogated on other grounds by Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶¶ 47-48.\n\n{64} “Ordinarily, a defendant bears the burden of proof on this factor by showing\n‘particularized prejudice’ when claiming a speedy trial violation.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008,\n¶ 86 (quoting Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 39). “However, if the length of delay and the\nreasons for the delay weigh heavily in [the] defendant’s favor and [the] defendant has\n\n                                              16\n\fasserted his right and not acquiesced to the delay, then the defendant need not show\nprejudice for a court to conclude that the defendant’s right has been violated.” Serros, 2016-\nNMSC-008, ¶ 86 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n{65} At the hearing on Defendant’s final motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, the\ndistrict court explained why it concluded Defendant had failed to demonstrate particularized\nprejudice. The court stated:\n\n       [W]ithout going through all the dates of when he was arrested, where he was\n       arrested and why he was arrested, [I am] unable to state whether he served\n       any—much, if any, pretrial incarceration time on this case. I know he was\n       brought here from Luna County, so he’s currently in custody in Luna County.\n       So I don’t think there is going to be [any] impressive pretrial incarceration.\n       With regard to it having any impact on his ability to mount a defense, I’ve\n       heard nothing about that today.\n\n{66} Defendant first argues that the district court erred by assigning the burden of proving\nprejudice instead of requiring the State to prove the absence of prejudice. But Salandre v.\nState, 1991-NMSC-016, 111 N.M. 422, 806 P.2d 562, the case that Defendant cites in\nsupport of this proposition, was modified by Garza, which expressly held that Salandre\nshould not be read to impose on the State a burden of disproving prejudice. See Garza, 2009-\nNMSC-038, ¶¶ 15-24 (“In light of the overwhelming consensus among the federal Circuit\nCourts of Appeals and our policy of providing a functional analysis based on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case, we abolish [Salandre’s] presumption that a defendant’s right to\na speedy trial has been violated based solely on the threshold determination that the length\nof delay is ‘presumptively prejudicial.’ ”). Under Garza, Defendant bears the burden to\nidentify and sufficiently establish particularized prejudice stemming from the presumptively\nprejudicial delays in this case.\n\n{67} In this regard, Defendant argues that his pro se motions to dismiss his attorney and\ndismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds “express[] overwhelming concern over the\nstatus of his case[.]” Defendant also points out that he was incarcerated for a significant\nportion of the delays at issue. These facts, Defendant claims, refute the district court’s\nconclusion that Defendant did not suffer particularized prejudice as a result of the\npresumptively prejudicial delays in this case.\n\n{68} The problem with this argument is that it depends on two factual inferences that the\ndistrict court was free to ignore given evidence tending to refute Defendant’s claim that he\nhad long been asserting his speedy trial rights and had not caused the delays at issue. The\nfirst inference is that Defendant’s expressions of “overwhelming concern over the status of\nhis case” in his pro se motions were sincere. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 88 (finding\nparticularized prejudice prejudice based on lengthy pretrial incarceration based on the\ndefendant’s “unchallenged testimony at the hearing on his motion to dismiss, in which he\ndescribed his living conditions for the previous four years”). Here, Defendant’s attorney\n\n                                             17\n\fprovided evidence that Defendant was seeking to fire him not because of a lack of\ncommunication but because he was unhappy with the State’s plea offer, and Defendant had\ndeliberately sought to sabotage the attorney-client relationship by seeking out another\nattorney and threatening to sue him. Given this evidence, the district court could permissibly\nview Defendant’s speedy trial complaints as part of an effort to derail the case on the eve of\ntrial, not a genuine desire for finality.\n\n{69} The second inference is that Defendant’s pretrial incarceration was caused by the\ndelays in this case. As Defendant concedes, he was released on bond roughly six months\nafter his arrest. While this period of incarceration can certainly be considered prejudicial in\nthe present case, it cannot simply be lumped together with the periods of incarceration that\nresulted from Defendant’s parole violations in unrelated cases, as the district court noted in\nits oral findings on prejudice. Properly assigned, it is clear that Defendant was incarcerated\nbased upon the instant charges for at most six months of the total period of delay at issue in\nthis case. We do not think that the prejudice Defendant suffered as a result of his\nincarceration after his arrest in the present case is enough to find that Defendant was\nprejudiced by the entire twenty-nine month delay in this case. Cf. Id., 2016-NMSC-008, ¶\n93 (upholding a district court’s finding of prejudice arising from the defendant’s\nincarceration in administrative segregation for the entire period of pretrial delay). Indeed,\nthe record indicates Defendant was in and out of jail following his initial satisfaction of bail\nin this case based upon his own actions before and after the relevant arrest and release from\nincarceration in the present case.\n\n{70} Defendant finally argues that because of the delays in bringing his case to trial, he\nsuffered particularized prejudice because he lost the opportunity to serve his sentence in this\ncase concurrently with his sentences for unrelated criminal convictions. See State v. Zurla,\n1990-NMSC-011, ¶ 23, 109 N.M. 640, 789 P.2d 588 (“[The appellate courts] believe loss\nof the possibility of serving concurrent sentences did constitute an aspect of prejudice.”). But\nZurla, which Defendant cites in support of his argument, weighed the second Barker factor\nheavily against the state, finding that its negligence was the cause of all of the delays at\nissue. Zurla, 1990-NMSC-011, ¶¶ 14-17. Here, as we have already explained, a significant\namount of the delay in this case was caused by Defendant. Without explaining how the\ndelays caused by the State (rather than those caused by Defendant) resulted in Defendant’s\nlost opportunity to serve concurrent sentences, we do not think Defendant has demonstrated\nparticularized prejudice on this ground.\n\n{71} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court correctly found that\nDefendant had failed to demonstrate particularized prejudice arising from the delays in this\ncase.\n\n5.     Balancing the Factors\n\n{72} To recapitulate, the first Barker factor strongly favors Defendant; the nearly twenty-\nnine month long delay in this case exceeds the amount of time that a criminal case of\n\n                                              18\n\fintermediate complexity is presumed to require. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 23.\nHowever, this is the only Barker factor that ultimately weighs in Defendant’s favor. As for\nthe second Barker factor, Defendant expressed his desire to bring his case to trial but\ninconsistently interposed numerous delays and requested continuances of scheduled trial\ndates, all reasons for delay that weigh in the State’s favor. We attach particular importance\nto Defendant’s repeated efforts to delay trial by more than two years in order to prioritize\nfulfilling his conditions of probation in an unrelated case. Ultimately, the district court\naccurately weighed this second Barker factor in favor of the State. Defendant’s inconsistent\nassertions of his speedy trial right while simultaneously requesting continuances of trial\nsettings also supported the district court’s determination regarding the third Barker factor,\na reasonably vigorous assertion of one’s right to a speedy trial. We conclude that assigning\nneutrality to this third Barker factor was not error under the facts presented in this case.\nFinally, Defendant failed to identify or establish particularized prejudice under the fourth\nBarker factor. As a result, our de novo review of all four speedy trial factors support the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that Defendant’s speedy trial rights were not violated.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n{73} We affirm the district court’s denial of Defendant’s motion to dismiss on speedy trial\ngrounds. We also reject Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\nhis conviction for conspiracy to commit forgery.\n\n{74}   Defendant’s conviction is affirmed.\n\n{75}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                              ____________________________________\n                                              J.

Facts Relevant to Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss on Speedy Trial Grounds\n\n{3}    On November 12, 2010, the State filed a criminal complaint in magistrate court\ncharging Defendant with four counts of forgery in violation of NMSA 1978, Section 30-16-\n10(A), (B) (2006). Defendant was arrested on November 19, 2010. On December 9, 2010,\nDefendant was charged in district court by grand jury indictment of four counts of forgery\nand one count of conspiracy to commit forgery. The State dismissed the magistrate court\ncase without prejudice the following day.\n\n{4}     Defendant was arraigned on the district court criminal complaint on December 27,\n2010. The district court set Defendant’s bond at $15,000. On January 21, 2011, Aric\nElsenheimer, Defendant’s public defender, filed an entry of appearance and request for\ndiscovery, as well as a demand for speedy trial. On February 21, 2011, Mr. Elsenheimer filed\na written motion for a reduction of Defendant’s bond.\n\n{5}    On February 25, 2011, the State moved to join Defendant’s case with pending cases\nagainst his two alleged co-conspirators. The district court entered notices scheduling a\nhearing on the State’s joinder motion and Defendant’s motion to reduce bond for April 7,\n2011. On April 4, 2011, for reasons unexplained in the record, the district court vacated the\nmotion hearing.\n\n{6}      On May 2, 2011, Pedro Pineda filed an entry of appearance on Defendant’s behalf.\n(Mr. Elsenheimer did not file a motion to withdraw or substitute, but it appears that this was\nthe effect of Mr. Pineda’s entry of appearance because Mr. Elsenheimer did not participate\nin the case from this point onward.) On July 25, 2011, Defendant posted bond and was\nreleased from incarceration. On August 22, 2011, the district court entered a notice\nscheduling a jury trial for Defendant’s charges on October 4, 2011. On September 29, 2011,\nthe State filed a motion to continue the October 4, 2011, trial referencing its pending motion\nto join Defendant’s case with one of his alleged co-conspirator’s. The motion stated that\n“Defense counsel, [Mr.] Pineda, does not oppose this [m]otion.” On September 30, 2011, the\ndistrict court granted the State’s motion to continue and vacated the October 4, 2011, trial\nsetting.\n\n                                              2\n\f{7}    On February 2, 2012, the State filed a request for a hearing on its motion to join. A\nhearing on the motion was scheduled to take place on February 15, 2012, and on February\n16, 2012, the State filed an amended motion to join that sought to join Defendant’s case with\nthe case against only one of Defendant’s alleged co-conspirators, Richard M. Tow.1\nDefendant’s attorney did not oppose the motion. On February 17, 2012, the district court\nentered an order joining Defendant’s case with Mr. Tow’s. On March 13, 2012, the district\ncourt entered a notice setting a jury trial for April 26, 2012.\n\n{8}     On April 11, 2012, Defendant filed a pro se motion to dismiss counsel. In the motion,\nDefendant asserted that his attorney, Mr. Pineda, had failed to communicate with him and\nthat his right to a speedy trial had been violated. Defendant noted “[m]y trial is [set for] the\n26th of April, and I need an [a]ttorney to prepare for my trial because I am innocent and I\nam taking this case to trial.” Defendant’s motion was mailed to the district court in an\nenvelope that listed the Luna County Detention Center as a return address. On April 13,\n2012, the district court scheduled a hearing on Defendant’s pro se motion to take place on\nApril 19, 2012.\n\n{9}     On April 18, 2012, Defendant’s attorney filed a motion to withdraw. In it, Mr. Pineda\nasserted that Defendant’s pro se motion to dismiss him as his attorney had caused “the\nattorney client relationship [to] deteriorate[] beyond repair[.]” Mr. Pineda argued that\nDefendant’s assertion that he had never met or communicated with his attorney was refuted\nby the fact that the arguments in his motion to dismiss counsel were based on information\nthat could only be gleaned from discovery that the State had provided to Mr. Pineda, which\nMr. Pineda had in turn provided to Defendant. Mr. Pineda asserted that Defendant had been\narrested for a probation violation on September 8, 2011, and again released on October 13,\n2011, but had failed to comply with a condition of release requiring him to stay in contact\nwith his attorney. Mr. Pineda also stated that Defendant was arrested for another probation\nviolation on February 14, 2012, and that “he has been incarcerated ever since.” Mr. Pineda\nexplained that Defendant’s dissatisfaction with Mr. Pineda likely stemmed from his being\n“very unhappy” with the State’s plea offer, which Mr. Pineda had conveyed to Defendant.\nFinally, Mr. Pineda stated that “Defendant . . . [has] consulted with local attorney Mike\nLilley, [and] Mr. Lilley told [Defendant] he would sue me and he would take over\n[Defendant’s] criminal case as well.”\n\n{10} On April 19, 2012, Defendant, again pro se, filed a motion for setting and telephonic\nhearing, in which he asserted that the indictment against him should be dismissed for “due\nprocess” and speedy trial violations. The district court held a hearing on April 20, 2012. At\nthe beginning of the hearing, Defendant explained that he had filed a separate motion for a\n\n\n       1\n         Although this information is not part of the record, Defendant represents in his brief\nin chief that the reason the State no longer sought to join his case with the other alleged co-\nconspirator’s case was because that co-conspirator had pleaded guilty to the charges against\nher.\n\n                                               3\n\ftelephonic hearing because he lived in Deming, New Mexico. Defendant also admitted that\nhe had in fact met with Mr. Pineda once.\n\n{11} Defendant disputed that he had hired another attorney to replace and sue Mr. Pineda,\nexplaining that Mr. Pineda’s assertion in his motion to withdraw must have been the result\nof a “misunderstanding.” In response, Mr. Pineda called his assistant to give testimony as\na witness. Mr. Pineda’s assistant testified that she had only spoken to Defendant once, when\nDefendant had called from jail to say that he planned to hire Mr. Lilley to sue Mr. Pineda for\nunstated reasons and to represent Defendant in his criminal case.\n\n{12} The prosecutor explained that the State’s primary concern was how the delay that\nwould result from granting Defendant’s motion to dismiss his attorney would be assigned\nfor speedy trial purposes. Notwithstanding these concerns, the district court granted\nDefendant’s motion to dismiss counsel and Mr. Pineda’s motion to withdraw. The district\ncourt stated that “it appears to this court that the parties will not be prepared for trial” and\ndirected Mr. Pineda to prepare form orders granting each motion and continuing the trial.\nThe district court asked Defendant personally whether he approved the “form” of the orders,\nand Defendant orally did so.\n\n{13} On May 11, 2012, the district court entered orders granting Defendant’s oral motion\nto continue, his motion to dismiss counsel, and Mr. Pineda’s motion to withdraw as counsel.\nThe district court reset Defendant’s jury trial for July 31, 2012. On June 11, 2012,\nDefendant’s replacement contract defender, Peter Giovannini, filed a notice of appearance,\ndemand for discovery, and a speedy trial demand.\n\n{14} On July 23, 2012, Defendant’s attorney filed a motion to vacate the July 31, 2012,\njury trial. The motion cited Defendant’s confusion as to who in fact was representing him,\nDefendant’s request to take statements by several witnesses for the State and witnesses that\nDefendant intended to call to testify in his defense at trial. The motion stated that\n“[u]ndersigned counsel agrees that any delay arising from this continuance should be\nattributed to the defense for purposes of any speedy trial analysis.” The district court granted\nDefendant’s motion to continue and vacated the July 31, 2012 trial setting, which was reset\nfor October 11, 2012.\n\n{15} On September 25, 2012, Defendant’s attorney filed a motion to vacate the October\n11, 2012, trial setting, stating that Defendant had been released from prison to serve the\nremainder of his sentence at a halfway house, and that “Defendant . . . is unable to\ncommunicate with undersigned counsel regarding [this case] because [he] is fearful that the\n[halfway house] will give him an ‘unsuccessful release’ from the program[,] which will\nviolate his probation.” The motion explained that “if the [halfway house] is aware of pending\ncharges, he will be released from the program.” The motion stated that “[u]ndersigned\ncounsel and Defendant respectfully request that this matter be vacated and rescheduled after\nApril[] 2014 to allow [D]efendant . . . to successfully complete the [halfway house\ns]ubstance [a]buse [t]reatment [p]rogram[.]” The State opposed the motion.\n\n                                               4\n\f{16} On October 3, 2012, the district court held a hearing on Defendant’s motion to\ncontinue. Defendant was not in attendance but his attorney reiterated that Defendant wanted\nto stay the proceedings until after April 2014 in order to allow him an opportunity to\nsuccessfully complete the terms of his probation in an unrelated case. The State explained\nits opposition to the motion, arguing that granting Defendant’s motion to continue would\nraise speedy trial problems and cause “hardship” to the parties. Finally, the State called a\nprobation officer as a witness, who testified that Defendant had left the halfway house\nbecause of a “medical injury.” The witness also testified that he had seen text messages\nDefendant had sent to in September to the mother of Defendant’s son stating that he was “on\nthe run.”\n\n{17} The district court recessed the hearing in order for the attorneys for the State and\nDefendant to attempt to locate Defendant. After the recess, both the State’s attorney and\nDefendant’s attorney said they were unable to locate Defendant, and that he was not at the\nLuna County Detention Center. The district court did not rule on Defendant’s motion to\ncontinue and issued a bench warrant for Defendant’s arrest.\n\n{18} On October 9, 2012, Defendant’s attorney filed another motion to continue. The\nmotion stated that on the same day as the hearing on Defendant’s earlier motion to continue,\n“Defendant . . . contacted [Mr. Giovannini’s] office stating he was release[d] from the\n[halfway house] to have surgery but he would return to the program[.]” The motion also\nstated that “[u]ndersigned counsel agrees that any delay arising from this continuance should\nbe attributed to the defense for purposes of any speedy trial analysis.” The State did not\noppose Defendant’s renewed motion to continue. The district court granted the motion.\n\n{19} On October 29, 2012, the State filed a request for a jury trial setting, and a few days\nlater the district court entered a notice setting trial for December 17, 2012. On November 9,\n2012, the court held a hearing in which it heard from Defendant’s attorney that Defendant\nhad in fact been in custody in another jurisdiction, so the bench warrant for failing to appear\nhad been issued in error. On December 13, 2012, the State moved to review Defendant’s\nconditions of release. The State acknowledged that Defendant was in custody in Deming on\nOctober 3, 2012, when the court held its hearing on Defendant’s earlier motion to continue.\nBut the State contended that Defendant’s conditions of release should be reviewed because\n“Defense counsel . . . has informed the State that . . . Defendant has failed to maintain\ncontact with defense counsel, and there are no assurances that . . . Defendant will appear for\ntrial on the scheduled trial date.” The district court did not hold a hearing or otherwise\ndispose of the State’s motion to review Defendant’s conditions of release. Instead, it appears\nto have simply continued the December 2012 trial setting to April 10, 2013.\n\n{20} On April 9, 2013, the day before trial, Defendant submitted a pro se motion to\ninvestigate and a motion to dismiss. In the motion to dismiss, Defendant made two\narguments: (1) his arrest was unlawful, and (2) his right to a speedy trial had been violated.\nWith respect to his speedy trial claim, Defendant argued that his case was simple and that\nthe nearly two-and-one-half-year delay between his arrest and trial violated his right to a\n\n                                              5\n\fspeedy trial.\n\n{21} The court heard argument on Defendant’s motion to dismiss on the morning of trial\non April 10, 2013. The district court denied Defendant’s motion to dismiss based on an\nunlawful arrest, and Defendant has not appealed that ruling. With respect to the claim that\nhis right to a speedy trial had been violated, Defendant argued that his case was simple and\nthat the length of the delay resulted in a violation of his right to a speedy trial. Defendant’s\nattorney indicated that Defendant’s motion likely did not have any merit because he had\n“absconded” for a significant period of time between his arrest and the trial and, therefore,\nwas himself responsible for much of the delay. Defendant conceded that he had absconded,\nsaying “[y]eah, my mom was really sick.”\n\n{22} After the State’s attorney responded, Defendant’s attorney asked to be allowed to\ncorrect statements he had made earlier. Defendant’s attorney stated:\n\n       [Defendant] felt compelled to leave [the halfway house] because he had to\n       have a surgery. Actually, they asked him to leave because of a medical\n       problem that he had told them about and told them that he needed to get\n       treatment on. So that changes the whole complexion of things.\n\nThe State responded that the halfway house Defendant was living in was a long-term\ninpatient program, which requires its patients to stay for a year to eighteen months. The State\nargued that Defendant “can’t . . . really [have] been planning on going to trial in this case if\nhe . . . [was in] an inpatient program for that length of time. And, again, if he left that\nprogram and ended up with a warrant, that still counts against [D]efendant and counts\nagainst his vigorous assertion of his right to a speedy trial[.]”\n\n{23} The district court orally recited the history of the case and made certain findings of\nfact that we review in greater detail in our discussion of Defendant’s speedy trial argument\nlater in this Opinion. The court found that “most of the delay has been charged to\n[D]efendant; therefore, [the court] denies your motion to dismiss [on speedy trial grounds].”\nAfter trial, the district court entered a written order denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss\nthat again assigned most of the delay to Defendant and additionally found that “Defendant\nhas not vigorously asserted the right to a speedy trial and there is no prejudice to . . .\nDefendant[.]”\n\nB.      Facts Relevant to Defendant’s Sufficiency of the Evidence Argument\n\n{24} Immediately after denying Defendant’s motion to dismiss, the court convened a jury\nvenire, selected a jury, and proceeded to trial.\n\n{25} Clorinda Barela testified that her daughter was living with Defendant in 2010.\nDefendant and her daughter had a son, and in September 2010, Ms. Barela had written a\ncheck for $10 to her grandson in order to purchase candy he was selling for a school\n\n                                               6\n\ffundraiser. Ms. Barela saw that the check she had written was instead cashed for $200 at a\nWalmart. Ms. Barela obtained copies of receipts for the merchandise that had been\npurchased with the check and reported the issue to the police. Ms. Barela learned that her\ndaughter had been identified as one of the individuals who had used the check at the\nWalmart.\n\n{26} Juliet Barela testified that her mother had given her son a check for a fundraiser and\nthat Defendant had erased the amount for which the check was originally made and replaced\nit with $200 or $250. Juliet Barela said that Defendant had given her the check, she went into\nWalmart and purchased items with the check, and then returned the items for cash. Juliet\nBarela testified that she kept $30 of the proceeds, while Defendant kept the rest.\n\n{27} The State presented the testimony of Jack Waggoner. Mr. Waggoner testified that in\nOctober 2010, a check he had written to his telephone company was stolen from the mailbox\nin front of his house. On October 28, 2010, Mr. Waggoner’s wife received a call from a\ncheck cashing business asking her whether her husband had hired anyone to perform work\naround the house for $250. When he went to the check cashing business to investigate, Mr.\nWaggoner was given a check he recognized to be the check he had written to Qwest, but it\nwas made out to a man named Richard Tow. That check was admitted into evidence.\n\n{28} The State also presented the testimony of Velia Hernandez, the clerk at the check\ncashing business Mr. Waggoner had referenced in his direct testimony. Ms. Hernandez\ntestified that on October 28, 2010, a man had attempted to cash a check that she felt did not\nlook “like . . . a legit check.” Ms. Hernandez called 411 to look up the phone number of Mr.\nWaggoner, who was identified on the check as the check’s owner. When she called Mr.\nWaggoner, his wife answered, and told her not to cash the check. Ms. Hernandez then called\nthe police, and the man who had come to cash the check fled.\n\n{29} The State called Mr. Tow to testify. Mr. Tow testified that Defendant had given him\na check for some yard work he had performed for Defendant’s relatives. Mr. Tow testified\nthat he had initially tried to cash the check at a Wells Fargo, but decided to leave because\nthe line for the teller was too long. Mr. Tow testified that he went to a nearby check cashing\nbusiness to try and cash the check. He testified that the cashier appeared to have “a problem\nwith the check. . . . I asked her if there was a problem, and she nodded to me that there was.\nSo I left, went back and got in the vehicle and left. And [Defendant] was very upset with me.\nI remember he yelled at me, told me, well, why the hell did I leave the check there[?]”\n\n{30} Mr. Tow testified that Defendant was an acquaintance. Mr. Tow said that he had let\nDefendant borrow his truck, on the condition that Defendant purchase some new tires for the\ntruck. Mr. Tow testified that Defendant had new tires put on the truck at Walmart and gave\nhim a receipt for the $821.78 purchase. Although Mr. Tow recognized the description of his\nvehicle on the Walmart work order, he did not recognize the name of the person who had\nordered the work, identified as “Marcos Silva.”\n\n\n                                              7\n\f{31} Finally, the State presented the testimony of Las Cruces Police Detective Frank\nTorres. Detective Torres testified that he was contacted by a man named Orton Keats, who\nhad told police that a check he had written to pay a bill had been converted to a higher\namount. Detective Torres was able to verify that Mr. Keats’s check had been used to\npurchase a set of four tires at WalMart for $821.78. Detective Torres also obtained the work\norder from Walmart, which provided a license plate for the vehicle that the tires were\ninstalled on: Mr. Tow’s truck.\n\n{32} Detective Torres also testified that he investigated a police report made by Marcey\nCarter. Detective Torres testified that Ms. Carter had written a check to pay a bill and put\nit into her mailbox for mailing. Ms. Carter discovered that the check had cleared, but for a\ndifferent amount, and had been used at Walmart. Detective Torres obtained surveillance\nfootage from Walmart showing a man wearing white cowboy boots and a Dallas Cowboys\nsweatshirt making a purchase with Ms. Carter’s check. Detective Torres testified that Mr.\nTow had identified Defendant as the man in the surveillance video because Defendant\nalways wears white cowboy boots.\n\n{33} At the close of the State’s case, Defendant moved for a directed verdict on all of the\ncharges against him, which the district court denied. The jury acquitted Defendant of the four\nforgery charges but returned a guilty verdict on the conspiracy to commit forgery charge.\n\nII.    DISCUSSION\n\n{34} Defendant raises two arguments on appeal: (A) there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport the jury’s guilty verdict on the indictment’s conspiracy to commit forgery charge,\nand (B) the district court erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on speedy\ntrial grounds. We address each argument in turn.\n\nA.     There Was Sufficient Evidence for a Rational Jury to Conclude That Defendant\n       Had Conspired to Commit Forgery\n\n{35} Defendant’s first issue on appeal challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\nsupporting the jury’s guilty verdict on the conspiracy to commit forgery charge. When a\ndefendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction, we\nreview the record to determine whether\n\n       sufficient evidence was adduced to support the underlying charge. The test\n       for sufficiency of the evidence is whether substantial evidence of either a\n       direct or circumstantial nature exists to support a verdict of guilt beyond a\n       reasonable doubt with respect to every element essential to a conviction.\n       When considering the sufficiency of the evidence, [an appellate court] does\n       not evaluate the evidence to determine whether some hypothesis could be\n       designed which is consistent with a finding of innocence. Instead, [the\n       reviewing courts] view the evidence as a whole and indulge all reasonable\n\n                                              8\n\f       inferences in favor of the jury’s verdict while at the same time asking\n       whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of\n       the crime beyond a reasonable doubt[.]\n\nState v.

That instruction read as follows:\n\n                 For you to find [D]efendant guilty of conspiracy to commit forgery\n       . . ., the [S]tate must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt\n       each of the following elements of the crime:\n\n              1.      [D]efendant and another person by words or acts agreed\n       together to commit forgery;\n\n              2.      [D]efendant and the other person intended to commit forgery;\n\n            3.      This happened in New Mexico on or between July 1, 2010 and\n       November 1, 2010.\n\n{37} The jury was also given four instructions corresponding to each forgery charge. The\ninstructions stated:\n\n                For you to find [D]efendant guilty of forgery as charged in Count[s\n       1, 2, 3, or 4,] the [S]tate must prove to your satisfaction beyond a reasonable\n       doubt each of the following elements of the crime:\n\n               1.     [D]efendant changed a genuine check so that its effect was\n       different from the original;\n\n              2.     At the time, [D]efendant intended to injure, deceive[,] or cheat\n       [Clarinda Barela, Jack Waggoner, Orton Keats, Marcey Carter,] or another;\n\n            3.      This happened in New Mexico on or between July 1, 2010 and\n       November 1, 2010.\n\nThus, in order for the jury to find Defendant guilty of conspiracy to commit forgery, it\nneeded to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that between July 1 and November 1, 2010,\nDefendant had by words or acts agreed to change a genuine check so that its effect was\ndifferent from the original, with intent to injure Clarinda Barela, Jack Waggoner, Orton\n\n                                             9\n\fKeats, Marcey Carter, or another.\n\n{38} Defendant concedes that the State established beyond a reasonable doubt that “four\npersonal checks belonging to four different people were washed and passed at four different\ntimes[,]” but argues that the “single Walmart image of him leaving the store . . . [at the] time\nof the passing of one check in question and the self-serving statements of two co-defendants”\nwas insufficient to establish that Defendant washed and passed the checks. But the jury need\nnot have been convinced that Defendant was the one who washed or passed checks; it only\nneeded to conclude that Defendant had entered into an agreement with another (presumably\neither Mr. Tow or Juliet Barela) to wash and pass the checks.

Defendant appears to\nacknowledge that the circumstantial evidence alone is enough to resolve this argument\nagainst him because Mr. Tow and Juliet Barela both offered testimony from which a jury\ncould infer the existence of a conspiracy: Mr. Tow’s testimony that Defendant had agreed\nto obtain a new set of tires for Mr. Tow’s truck in exchange for letting Defendant borrow it;\nand Juliet Barela’s testimony that she and Defendant had agreed to wash and use her\nmother’s check at Walmart, sharing the proceeds. By characterizing the testimony of Mr.\nTow and Juliet Barela as “self-serving,” Defendant is in essence conceding that his\nsufficiency of the evidence challenge to his conviction for conspiracy turns on a challenge\nto the jury’s decision to credit the testimony of Mr. Tow and Juliet Barela, a decision which\nwe are powerless to review on appeal.

The District Court Did Not Err in Denying Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss on\n       Speedy Trial Grounds\n\n\n                                              10\n\f{41} The Speedy Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution\nprovides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy .\n. . trial[.]” U.S. Const. amend. VI. “The heart of the right to a speedy trial is preventing\nprejudice to the accused.” State v. Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 12, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">499</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"891580\"><a href=\"/opinion/891580/state-v-garza/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">387</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The right to a speedy trial “is unique among the constitutional guarantees afforded a\ncriminal defendant because of the concomitant ‘societal interest in bringing an accused to\ntrial.’ ” State v. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 4, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1121</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (quoting Garza, 2009-NMSC-\n038, ¶ 12). “As a result, merely showing delay in bringing an accused’s case to trial is not\nenough to establish a speedy trial violation; rather, [the appellate courts] must scrutinize\nevery claimed violation to determine whether the accused has suffered an actual and\narticulable deprivation of the right to a speedy trial.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 4 (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n{42} We evaluate Defendant’s claim that his Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial was\nviolated using the four factors set out in Barker v. Wingo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108590\"><a href=\"/opinion/108590/barker-v-wingo/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 530 (1972): “(1) the\nlength of the delay in bringing the case to trial, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) the\ndefendant’s assertion of the right to a speedy trial; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant\ncaused by the delay.” Id.; see also Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 5.\n\n1.     Length of Delay\n\n{43} “The first factor, the length of delay, has a dual function: it acts as a triggering\nmechanism for considering the four Barker factors if the delay crosses the threshold of being\npresumptively prejudicial, and it is an independent factor to consider in evaluating whether\na speedy trial violation has occurred.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008,¶ 22. As to the first function,\nour Supreme Court “[has] established benchmarks for presumptively prejudicial delay\naccording to the complexity of a case: one year for a simple case, 15 months for a case of\nintermediate complexity, and 18 months for a complex case.” Id. ¶ 22 (citing Garza, 2009-\nNMSC-038, ¶ 48). In this case, the State concedes (and we agree) that the twenty-nine\nmonth, twenty-two day-long delay between Defendant’s arrest and his trial is sufficient to\ntrigger further analysis for a speedy trial violation regardless of the complexity of the case.\n\n{44} As to the second, “independent” function that the first Barker factor performs, our\nSupreme Court has stated that “[t]he length of delay is an objective determination that is\ncapable of measurement with some precision, and once established, it colors the rest of the\nspeedy trial analysis. A delay that crosses the threshold for presumptive prejudice\nnecessarily weighs in favor of the accused; the only question is, how heavily?” Serros, 2016-\nNMSC-008, ¶ 26. Importantly, “the parties’ fault in causing the delay is irrelevant to the\nanalysis” of this factor. Id. “A delay that scarcely crosses the bare minimum needed to\ntrigger judicial examination of the claim is of little help to a defendant claiming a speedy\ntrial violation.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “Conversely, an\nextraordinary delay . . . weighs heavily in favor of a defendant’s speedy trial claim, bearing\nin mind that no single factor is dispositive of whether a violation has occurred.” Id.; See\nGarza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 24.\n\n                                              11\n\f{45} As an initial matter, we note that our Supreme Court in Serros did not explain how\nto determine the difference between a presumptively prejudicial delay that “scarcely crosses\nthe bare minimum needed” and provides “little help to a defendant” versus the additional\nlength of delay that would be considered “extraordinary” and that “weighs heavily in favor\nof a defendant’s speedy trial claim.” Id. (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). In\nSerros, our Supreme Court concluded that weighing the first factor heavily in the\ndefendant’s favor was not a “difficult question” because the fifty-one month long delay\nbetween the defendant’s arrest and the dismissal of his indictment for speedy trial violations\nwas far in excess of the amount needed to create a presumption of prejudice. Id. ¶ 24.\n\n{46} Here, the nearly twenty-nine month delay between Defendant’s arrest and his trial\nis more than the “bare minimum needed” to show presumptive prejudice, but significantly\nshorter than the fifty-one month delay that Serros concluded weighed heavily in the\ndefendant’s favor as a matter of course. Id. ¶ 26 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted). Moreover, the district court in this case did not make an express finding as to the\ncomplexity of Defendant’s case. The complexity of this case does not matter to our\ndetermination of presumptive prejudice because the amount of delay is sufficient to trigger\na speedy trial analysis regardless of the case’s complexity. See id. ¶ 23 (concluding the delay\npresumptively prejudicial without determining the case’s complexity). But with respect to\nhow we are to evaluate this length of delay factor, the complexity of this case takes on\nconsiderable importance. If the case is classified as simple, then the delay exceeds the\nthreshold for presumptive prejudice by seventeen months; if intermediate, fourteen; if\ncomplex, only eleven. See id. ¶ 22 (recognizing that the amount of time that must elapse for\ndelay to become presumptively prejudicial is “one year for a simple case, 15 months for a\ncase of intermediate complexity, and 18 months for a complex case” (citing Garza, 2009-\nNMSC-038, ¶ 48)).\n\n{47} The State argues that this is a case of “intermediate” complexity based on “the\nnumber of potential witnesses and scenarios that were involved.” Specifically, the State\nasserts that it was required to prepare for a trial involving testimony of the checks’ owners,\nthe employees of the businesses where Defendant allegedly passed the checks off, records\ncustodians who could lay the foundation for the admission of surveillance camera footage,\nand any law enforcement personnel involved in the investigations that led to Defendant’s\narrest. We agree that the State’s assessment of this case’s complexity is reasonable, and\naccordingly, find that the length of the delay in this case was fourteen months in excess of\nthe amount necessary to trigger judicial scrutiny.\n\n{48} In Serros, our Supreme Court concluded that a fifty-one month delay between the\ndefendant’s arrest and the dismissal of the indictment against him on speedy trial grounds\nwas “extreme” and therefore justified weighing the first Barker factor heavily in the\ndefendant’s favor. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 24. By contrast, in Garza, our Supreme Court\ndetermined that a delay that only exceeded the amount required to trigger further judicial\nanalysis by a month and six days “was not extraordinary and [did] not weigh heavily in [the\nd]efendant’s favor.” Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 24. Here, the delay in this case exceeds the\n\n                                              12\n\famount required to trigger further analysis by fourteen months. This delay is far more than\nthe “bare minimum needed to trigger judicial examination of the claim.” Id. (internal\nquotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, we conclude that this factor weighs\nheavily in Defendant’s favor.\n\n2.     The Reasons Behind the Delay\n\n{49} The district court found that most of the delay in this case was attributable to\nDefendant. As we have stated above, we give deference to the district court’s finding of fact\nthat Defendant caused most of the delay in this case, to the extent it is supported by\nsubstantial evidence in the record. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 20.\n\n{50} Defendant argues that the State is responsible for twenty-four out of the twenty-nine\nmonths of delay in this case. Defendant asserts that the delay between February 2011 and\nFebruary 2012 was caused by the State’s filing of a motion to join Defendant’s case with that\nof his alleged co-conspirators’ and the district court’s negligent failure to timely rule on the\nmotion. Defendant argues that the State is responsible for another two months of delay\ncaused by its mistaken belief that Defendant had absconded from custody when he was in\nfact in prison, thus causing the district court to issue a bench warrant and continue the\nOctober 2012 trial setting to December 2012. Finally, Defendant argues that he should not\nbe held responsible for the delays between April 2012 and April 2013, which Defendant\nargues was caused by motions to continue filed by his trial counsel which he did not consent\nto filing. We assess and assign responsibility for the delays in this case chronologically.\n\n{51} We agree with Defendant that the delay caused by the State’s motion to join (and the\ndistrict court’s failure to rule on the motion) is properly weighed in Defendant’s favor.\nAccordingly, twelve of the twenty-nine month period of delay in this case weighs in\nDefendant’s favor. In doing so, we reject the State’s argument that the delay should not be\nweighed against it because the motion had merit and was ultimately granted as unopposed\nin modified form. Whatever the merit of the motion, the State’s decision to file it occasioned\nthe district court’s delay until it ruled on the motion. Accordingly, this period of time is\nappropriately weighed more heavily against the State. See Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶¶ 26-\n30 (noting that delays caused by administrative burdens on the court system are typically\nweighed slightly in the defendant’s favor, but the more “protracted” the delay, the more\nheavily it is weighed in the defendant’s favor).\n\n{52} We disagree with Defendant’s assertion that the period of delay from April 2012 to\nApril 2013 is the fault of the State. Defendant argues that he asserted his right to a speedy\ntrial by filing a pro se motion to dismiss his attorney in which he also demanded to proceed\nto trial. We are mindful that the right to a speedy trial and the right to effective assistance\nof counsel are not mutually exclusive. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 81. In this regard, when\nassessing a period of delay caused by a defendant’s pro se motion to discharge his attorney,\nour Supreme Court identified the reasonableness of such a request as the relevant inquiry in\ndetermining whether to assign the resultant delay to the defendant or the state. Id. ¶¶ 53-54.\n\n                                              13\n\fAs we explain below, we think that there is substantial evidence to support the district\ncourt’s finding that Defendant, not his counsel, is responsible for this period of delay.\n\n{53} In his pro se motion to dismiss his attorney, filed about two weeks before the April\n2012 trial setting, Defendant asserted that his attorney was not communicating with him, not\npreparing his case for trial, and not providing him with discovery. But against these\nassertions of fact, Defendant’s attorney said that he had communicated with Defendant, was\npreparing the case for trial, and had provided Defendant with discovery from the State.\nAlthough Mr. Pineda did not submit an affidavit or otherwise testify to his assertions of fact,\nneither did Defendant. Moreover, Mr. Pineda called his administrative assistant to testify that\nDefendant had called and told her that he had obtained another attorney who would be suing\nMr. Pineda and taking over Defendant’s case. Because Defendant had denied making such\nan assertion, Mr. Pineda’s assistant’s testimony undermined Defendant’s credibility and\nprovided the district court with a substantial basis for concluding that Defendant’s effort to\nfire his attorney was a “last-minute plea[] to change counsel [that] should be []viewed\nskeptically[,]” not a reasonable invocation of his right to effective trial counsel. Id. ¶ 53.\nAccordingly, we assign to Defendant the delay caused by the district court’s continuance of\nthe April 26, 2012, trial date to July 31, 2012.\n\n{54} Defendant’s replacement counsel moved to continue the July 31, 2012, trial date\nbased on the need to conduct additional investigation. Defendant’s attorney stated that\nDefendant had been under the mistaken impression that counsel for his co-Defendant, Mr.\nTow, was his attorney, and that this caused several weeks of delay. Once this\nmisunderstanding had been cleared up, Defendant requested that his attorney conduct\nadditional investigation and track down additional witnesses who Defendant wanted to call\nto testify in his defense. Although these requests are hardly unreasonable, it does not follow\nthat any delay that resulted must be weighed against the State. The district court did not err\nin concluding that Defendant should be assigned responsibility for the delay caused by\ncontinuing the July 31, 2012, trial setting to October 11, 2012.\n\n{55} We disagree as well with Defendant that the State caused the delay between October\n2012 and December 2012. This period of delay was not caused by the district court’s\nmistaken issuance of a bench warrant for Defendant’s arrest, as defendant argues; rather, it\nwas caused by Defendant’s attorney filing a motion at Defendant’s behest that trial be\ncontinued until after April 2014 in order to allow Defendant to finish an inpatient treatment\nprogram at a halfway house. It is worth noting that the State opposed Defendant’s motion\nto continue, arguing that granting the motion would create speedy trial concerns. The State\nalso presented evidence at the hearing on the motion that tended to refute Defendant’s claim\nthat he was actually enrolled in an inpatient treatment program. To be sure, confusion over\nDefendant’s location might have caused the district court to mistakenly issue a bench\nwarrant and may have figured into the district court’s decision to delay the trial. But the\noccasion for the delay in the first place was Defendant’s request to continue the trial for\nnearly two years, which the State opposed, and Defendant’s decision to leave the halfway\nhouse to seek medical attention, which contributed to the confusion over Defendant’s\n\n                                              14\n\flocation. We see no error in the district court’s determination that Defendant should be held\nresponsible for this period of delay.\n\n{56} Although the district court did not enter an order or otherwise explain why it was\ncontinuing the December 17, 2012, trial setting, it appears that the reason for the continuance\nwas the State’s December 13, 2012, motion to revoke Defendant’s conditions of release. In\nthat motion, the State stated that it had been told by Defendant’s attorney that “Defendant\nhas failed to maintain contact with defense counsel, and there are no assurances that . . .\nDefendant will appear for trial on the scheduled trial date.” Defendant later conceded on the\nmorning of trial that he had failed to stay in contact with his attorney. Although it is not clear\nwhether Defendant failed to stay in contact with his attorney in order to purposefully delay\nthe December 17, 2012, trial, this evidence provided a sufficient basis for the district court\nto find that Defendant “affirmatively cause[d] or acquiesce[d]” in this period of delay.\nSerros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 74.\n\n{57} In sum, twelve months of the delay in this case can be assigned to the State;\nDefendant caused or acquiesced in the remaining sixteen months’ delay. Since the majority\nof the delay in this case was caused by Defendant, we conclude that application of the\nsecond Barker factor “tip[s] the balance back in favor of the societal interest in bringing [the\nd]efendant to trial” and ultimately weighs in favor of the State. Serros, 2016-NMSC-008,\n¶ 28 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n3.      Defendant’s Assertion of the Right to a Speedy Trial\n\n{58} The third Barker factor looks to “the frequency and force of the objections[,] as\nopposed to attaching significant weight to a purely pro forma objection.” Barker, 407 U.S.\nat 529. The right to a speedy trial is\n\n        fundamental in nature so that a failure to assert [it] does not constitute\n        waiver, but the timeliness and vigor with which the right is asserted may be\n        considered as an indication of whether a defendant was denied needed access\n        to speedy trial over his objection or whether the issue was raised on appeal\n        as [an] afterthought.\n\nGarza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 32.\n\n{59} Here, Defendant argues that the two speedy trial demands filed by his appointed\nattorneys and his pro se invocations of the right to a speedy trial in his first motion to dismiss\nhis attorney, his motion for a telephonic setting, and his motion to dismiss the indictment\nfiled on the eve of trial in April 2013 demonstrate that he frequently and forcefully asserted\nhis right to a speedy trial.\n\n{60} In Garza, our Supreme Court held that the defendant’s single speedy trial demand,\n“preceding his motion to dismiss, tucked within the waiver of arraignment and not guilty\n\n                                               15\n\fplea, was sufficient to assert his right.” Id. ¶ 34. The Court noted that although the\ndefendant’s single invocation of his right to a speedy trial “was not especially vigorous[,]”\nthe fact that the defendant had not otherwise acquiesced in the delay required the third\nBarker factor to be weighed slightly in his favor. Id.\n\n{61} Here, Defendant invoked his right to a speedy trial five times—twice through his\nlawyers, and three times through pro se motions to discharge his attorney, set a telephonic\nhearing, and to dismiss the indictment. Although Defendant invoked his right to a speedy\ntrial many more times than the defendant did in Garza, this fact is mitigated by the context\nof Defendant’s invocations of the right to a speedy trial: as we have explained above,\nDefendant’s first two pro se motions to dismiss were filed on the eve of trial and sought a\nnew attorney as the primary relief. Defendant’s pro se motion to dismiss was likewise filed\non the eve of his April 2013 trial, which ultimately went forward after it was denied. And\nagainst Defendant’s invocations of his right to a speedy trial, Defendant at least once sought\nto delay his trial by more than two years in order to avoid violating his conditions of release\nfor an unrelated criminal conviction.\n\n{62} Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court’s finding that\nDefendant did not frequently or forcefully invoke his right to a speedy trial lacks a\nsubstantial basis. See Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 32 (quoting Sisneros v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">790</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800 (Wyo. 2005), for the proposition that the third Barker factor should be weighed\nneutrally where the defendant “demanded a speedy trial throughout the proceedings, but\n‘also engaged in procedural maneuvers which had the result of delaying the trial’ ”).\nAccordingly, we cannot reverse the district court’s ultimate finding to weigh the third Barker\nfactor neutrally.\n\n4.     The Prejudice to Defendant Caused by the Delay\n\n{63} The United States Supreme Court in Barker explained the “actual prejudice” prong\nof the constitutional speedy trial analysis as follows:\n\n       Prejudice . . . should be assessed in the light of the interests of [the]\n       defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect. This Court\n       has identified three such interests: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial\n       incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii)\n       to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\n\n407 U.S. at 532; see State v. Maddox, 2008-NMSC-062, ¶ 32, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2636528\"><a href=\"/opinion/2636528/state-v-maddox/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\nabrogated on other grounds by Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶¶ 47-48.\n\n{64} “Ordinarily, a defendant bears the burden of proof on this factor by showing\n‘particularized prejudice’ when claiming a speedy trial violation.” Serros, 2016-NMSC-008,\n¶ 86 (quoting Garza, 2009-NMSC-038, ¶ 39). “However, if the length of delay and the\nreasons for the delay weigh heavily in [the] defendant’s favor and [the] defendant has\n\n                                              16\n\fasserted his right and not acquiesced to the delay, then the defendant need not show\nprejudice for a court to conclude that the defendant’s right has been violated.” Serros, 2016-\nNMSC-008, ¶ 86 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n{65} At the hearing on Defendant’s final motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, the\ndistrict court explained why it concluded Defendant had failed to demonstrate particularized\nprejudice. The court stated:\n\n       [W]ithout going through all the dates of when he was arrested, where he was\n       arrested and why he was arrested, [I am] unable to state whether he served\n       any—much, if any, pretrial incarceration time on this case. I know he was\n       brought here from Luna County, so he’s currently in custody in Luna County.\n       So I don’t think there is going to be [any] impressive pretrial incarceration.\n       With regard to it having any impact on his ability to mount a defense, I’ve\n       heard nothing about that today.\n\n{66} Defendant first argues that the district court erred by assigning the burden of proving\nprejudice instead of requiring the State to prove the absence of prejudice. But Salandre v.\nState, 1991-NMSC-016, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379626\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379626/salandre-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1379626\"><a href=\"/opinion/1379626/salandre-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">806</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the case that Defendant cites in\nsupport of this proposition, was modified by Garza, which expressly held that Salandre\nshould not be read to impose on the State a burden of disproving prejudice. See Garza, 2009-\nNMSC-038, ¶¶ 15-24 (“In light of the overwhelming consensus among the federal Circuit\nCourts of Appeals and our policy of providing a functional analysis based on the facts and\ncircumstances of each case, we abolish [Salandre’s] presumption that a defendant’s right to\na speedy trial has been violated based solely on the threshold determination that the length\nof delay is ‘presumptively prejudicial.’ ”). Under Garza, Defendant bears the burden to\nidentify and sufficiently establish particularized prejudice stemming from the presumptively\nprejudicial delays in this case.\n\n{67} In this regard, Defendant argues that his pro se motions to dismiss his attorney and\ndismiss the indictment on speedy trial grounds “express[] overwhelming concern over the\nstatus of his case[.]” Defendant also points out that he was incarcerated for a significant\nportion of the delays at issue. These facts, Defendant claims, refute the district court’s\nconclusion that Defendant did not suffer particularized prejudice as a result of the\npresumptively prejudicial delays in this case.\n\n{68} The problem with this argument is that it depends on two factual inferences that the\ndistrict court was free to ignore given evidence tending to refute Defendant’s claim that he\nhad long been asserting his speedy trial rights and had not caused the delays at issue. The\nfirst inference is that Defendant’s expressions of “overwhelming concern over the status of\nhis case” in his pro se motions were sincere. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 88 (finding\nparticularized prejudice prejudice based on lengthy pretrial incarceration based on the\ndefendant’s “unchallenged testimony at the hearing on his motion to dismiss, in which he\ndescribed his living conditions for the previous four years”). Here, Defendant’s attorney\n\n                                             17\n\fprovided evidence that Defendant was seeking to fire him not because of a lack of\ncommunication but because he was unhappy with the State’s plea offer, and Defendant had\ndeliberately sought to sabotage the attorney-client relationship by seeking out another\nattorney and threatening to sue him. Given this evidence, the district court could permissibly\nview Defendant’s speedy trial complaints as part of an effort to derail the case on the eve of\ntrial, not a genuine desire for finality.\n\n{69} The second inference is that Defendant’s pretrial incarceration was caused by the\ndelays in this case. As Defendant concedes, he was released on bond roughly six months\nafter his arrest. While this period of incarceration can certainly be considered prejudicial in\nthe present case, it cannot simply be lumped together with the periods of incarceration that\nresulted from Defendant’s parole violations in unrelated cases, as the district court noted in\nits oral findings on prejudice. Properly assigned, it is clear that Defendant was incarcerated\nbased upon the instant charges for at most six months of the total period of delay at issue in\nthis case. We do not think that the prejudice Defendant suffered as a result of his\nincarceration after his arrest in the present case is enough to find that Defendant was\nprejudiced by the entire twenty-nine month delay in this case. Cf. Id., 2016-NMSC-008, ¶\n93 (upholding a district court’s finding of prejudice arising from the defendant’s\nincarceration in administrative segregation for the entire period of pretrial delay). Indeed,\nthe record indicates Defendant was in and out of jail following his initial satisfaction of bail\nin this case based upon his own actions before and after the relevant arrest and release from\nincarceration in the present case.\n\n{70} Defendant finally argues that because of the delays in bringing his case to trial, he\nsuffered particularized prejudice because he lost the opportunity to serve his sentence in this\ncase concurrently with his sentences for unrelated criminal convictions. See State v. Zurla,\n1990-NMSC-011, ¶ 23, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1345613\"><a href=\"/opinion/1345613/zurla-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.M.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1345613\"><a href=\"/opinion/1345613/zurla-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">588</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (“[The appellate courts] believe loss\nof the possibility of serving concurrent sentences did constitute an aspect of prejudice.”). But\nZurla, which Defendant cites in support of his argument, weighed the second Barker factor\nheavily against the state, finding that its negligence was the cause of all of the delays at\nissue. Zurla, 1990-NMSC-011, ¶¶ 14-17. Here, as we have already explained, a significant\namount of the delay in this case was caused by Defendant. Without explaining how the\ndelays caused by the State (rather than those caused by Defendant) resulted in Defendant’s\nlost opportunity to serve concurrent sentences, we do not think Defendant has demonstrated\nparticularized prejudice on this ground.\n\n{71} For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the district court correctly found that\nDefendant had failed to demonstrate particularized prejudice arising from the delays in this\ncase.\n\n5.     Balancing the Factors\n\n{72} To recapitulate, the first Barker factor strongly favors Defendant; the nearly twenty-\nnine month long delay in this case exceeds the amount of time that a criminal case of\n\n                                              18\n\fintermediate complexity is presumed to require. See Serros, 2016-NMSC-008, ¶ 23.\nHowever, this is the only Barker factor that ultimately weighs in Defendant’s favor. As for\nthe second Barker factor, Defendant expressed his desire to bring his case to trial but\ninconsistently interposed numerous delays and requested continuances of scheduled trial\ndates, all reasons for delay that weigh in the State’s favor. We attach particular importance\nto Defendant’s repeated efforts to delay trial by more than two years in order to prioritize\nfulfilling his conditions of probation in an unrelated case. Ultimately, the district court\naccurately weighed this second Barker factor in favor of the State. Defendant’s inconsistent\nassertions of his speedy trial right while simultaneously requesting continuances of trial\nsettings also supported the district court’s determination regarding the third Barker factor,\na reasonably vigorous assertion of one’s right to a speedy trial. We conclude that assigning\nneutrality to this third Barker factor was not error under the facts presented in this case.\nFinally, Defendant failed to identify or establish particularized prejudice under the fourth\nBarker factor. As a result, our de novo review of all four speedy trial factors support the\ndistrict court’s conclusion that Defendant’s speedy trial rights were not violated.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n{73} We affirm the district court’s denial of Defendant’s motion to dismiss on speedy trial\ngrounds. We also reject Defendant’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting\nhis conviction for conspiracy to commit forgery.\n\n{74}   Defendant’s conviction is affirmed.\n\n{75}   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n\n                                              ____________________________________\n                                              J.
