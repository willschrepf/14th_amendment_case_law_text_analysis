He challenges the\n\nreasonableness of the fee award, the court's decision to assess the entire award\n\nagainst his estate, and the court's decision to enter its judgment immediately. He\n\nalso moves to supplement the record with the guardian's inventory report and\n\nbudget.    Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in approving\n\nCastilleja's fee petition and in giving the guardian discretion to apportion the fee\n\naward and Hays did not timely appeal the court's decision to enter its judgment\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/2\n\n\n\n\nimmediately, we affirm. Because Hays's motion to supplement the record fails to\n\nmeet RAP 9.11(a)'s requirements, we deny his motion.\n\n                                     FACTS\n\n\n      Arthur D. Hays accumulated substantial wealth operating a wholesale\n\ndistributing business and acquiring real property to store his merchandise. He is\n\nthe trustee and beneficiary of the Hays Family Trust. When his wife died in 1980,\n\nher estate was transferred into this trust.   He has been the manager of Hays\n\nElliott Properties LLC (HEP) since he created it in 1999.         HEP owns and\n\nmanages real property.    In 2000, Hays created three irrevocable trusts.     Each\n\ntrust owns shares of HEP. Castilleja, Hays's daughter, became the successor\n\ntrustee of each trust in 2008. Hays also maintains a collection of vintage vehicles\n\nand owns the Hays Distributing Corporation, a wholesale distributing business.\n\nAdditionally, he owns property in Suquamish, Washington, that is part of the\n\nHays Millers Bay Limited Partnership; a residence in the Magnolia neighborhood\n\nin Seattle; a condominium in the Alki area; and real estate on West Commodore\n\nWay. The case involves assets valued at approximately $28 million.\n\n       In March 2011, Castilleja filed a petition seeking the appointment of a\n\nguardian of Hays's estate. Hays's son Howard supported the guardianship, but\n\nHays and his son Robert opposed it. On November 18, 2011, after a six-day\n\nbench trial, the trial court found Hays incapacitated as to his estate. The court\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/3\n\n\n\n\nappointed an independent professional guardian, finding, \"There is family conflict\n\nand all of Mr. Hays' children at any given time could stand to benefit from any\n\ndecision or error that Mr. Hays might make, thus making appointment of a\n\nguardian independent of the family necessary.\"\n\n       In the November 18 order, the court also concluded that Castilleja should\n\nrecover her reasonable costs and          attorney fees incurred bringing the\n\nguardianship action.   The court's order provides for the determination of the\n\nreasonableness of these fees \"under the lodestar measure by separate motion.\"\n\nThe court ordered the guardian to file an inventory of Hays's property within three\n\nmonths.\n\n\n       On February 1, 2012, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of\n\nCastilleja for $380,592.92, representing $352,755.36 in attorney fees and\n\n$27,837.56 in costs.     The judgment authorized the guardian to pay it and\n\nprovided for payment from \"the guardianship estate and/or any other asset/entity\n\nin which Mr. Arthur Hays has a beneficial interest.\"\n\n      On February 29, Hays filed a notice of appeal, seeking review of both the\n\nFebruary 1, 2012, order and designated portions of the November 18, 2011,\n\norder. On May 7, 2012, Hays filed a motion to supplement the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/4\n\n\n\n\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n      We apply a two-part standard to review a trial court judgment awarding\n\nattorney fees: \"(1) we review de novo whether there is a legal basis for awarding\n\nattorney fees by statute, under contract, or in equity and (2) we review a\n\ndiscretionary decision to award or deny attorney fees and the reasonableness of\n\nany attorney fee award for an abuse of discretion.\"1 The parties do not dispute\n\nthe statutory basis2 for the court's authority to award attorney fees. Thus, we\n\napply the second part of this review standard.\n\n      When reviewing a trial court's decision for abuse of discretion, we will\n\nuphold the decision unless it is \"'manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on\n\nuntenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.'\"3 A court makes a manifestly\n\nunreasonable decision if it falls outside the range of acceptable choices, given\n\nthe facts and the applicable legal standard; a court bases its decision on\n\nuntenable grounds if the record does not support the court's factual findings; a\n\n\n      1 Gander v.

We reject these\n\narguments.\n\n       First, Hays claims that the trial court should have stated how the factors\n\nenumerated in RPC 1.5(a) affected its fee decision.        RPC 1.5(a) states, in\n\nrelevant part,\n\n       The factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of\n       a fee include the following:\n              (1) the time and labor required, the novelty and difficulty of\n       the questions involved, and the skill requisite to perform the legal\n       service properly;\n\n       4 In re Marriage of Littlefield. 133 Wn.2d 39, 47, 940 P.2d 1362 (1997)\n(citing State v. Rundguist, 79 Wn. App. 786, 793, 905 P.2d 922 (1995)).\n                                        -5-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/6\n\n\n\n             (2) the likelihood, if apparent to the client, that the\n       acceptance of the particular employment will preclude other\n       employment by the lawyer;\n             (3) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal\n       services;\n              (4) the amount involved and the results obtained;\n              (5) the time limitations imposed by the client or by the\n       circumstances;\n              (6) the nature and length of the professional relationship with\n       the client;\n               (7) the experience, reputation, and ability of the lawyer or\n       lawyers performing the services;\n               (8) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; and\n               (9) the terms of the fee agreement between the lawyer and\n       the client, including whether the fee agreement or confirming writing\n       demonstrates that the client had received a reasonable and fair\n       disclosure of material elements of the fee agreement and of the\n       lawyer's billing practices.[5]\n       Specifically, Hays asserts that the court failed to apply the first, third,\n\nfourth, and seventh factors and that \"had the trial court properly considered the\n\nrelevant factors, it would have reached the inevitable conclusion that the total\n\nfees were excessive for the establishment of a guardianship of the estate.\" He\n\nbases this assertion upon the absence of any specific finding applying these\n\nfactors.   He contends that the case presented no novel issues about the\n\nestablishment of a guardianship; that Castilleja's attorneys offered excessive and\n\nirrelevant evidence; that the participation of two attorneys produced an excessive\n\ncombined hourly rate, although the individual rate for each attorney was\n\nreasonable; that counsel expended considerable time presenting irrelevant\n\n\n       5 Hays cites the former rule, which contained only eight factors. The\ncurrent rule includes nine factors.\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/7\n\n\n\n\nevidence of assets Hays previously transferred to HEP, which had an operating\n\nagreement addressing the incapacity of its manager; and that Castilleja's\n\nattorneys should have been more efficient because of their experience in\n\nguardianship law and \"excellent reputations\" in providing representation in\n\nguardianship proceedings.\n\n       Hays cites In re Guardianship of Hallauer6 to support his contention, but\n\nhe cites the plaintiff's argument in the case rather than the court's holding. In\n\nfact, in Hallauer, we cited our Supreme Court's unanimous decision in McNearv\n\nv. American Cvanimid Co.,7 that to determine whether attorney fees are\n\nreasonable, the factors in RPC 1.5(a) \"should be used as 'guidelines.'\"8 More\n\nrecently, in Mahler v. Szucs.9 our Supreme Court held, \"[CJourts should be\n\nguided in calculating fee awards by the lodestar method in determining an award\n\nof attorney fees as costs.\" Additionally, \"[tjhis methodology can be supplemented\n\nby an analysis of the factors set forth in RPC 1.5(a) which guide members of the\n\nBar as to the reasonableness ofa fee.\"10 RCW 11.96A.150 governs attorney fee\n\nawards in guardianship proceedings. It states, \"In exercising its discretion under\n\nthis section, the court may consider any and all factors that it deems to be\n\n      644Wn.App. 795, 723 P.2d 1161 (1986).\n      7 105 Wn.2d 136, 143, 712 P.2d 845 (1986).\n      8 Hallauer. 44 Wn.

As part of its analysis of the reasonableness of the\n\nnumber of hours that counsel expended, the court considered \"the results\n\nobtained, the work performed, and the contested nature of the proceedings.\"\n\nThe trial court affirmatively found that the time expended did \"not reflect any\n\nsignificant redundancy, waste or unnecessary services.\"\n\n       In Hays's second challenge to the fee award, he contends that the trial\n\ncourt failed to apply the lodestar method when determining if the requested\n\nattorney fees and costs were reasonable.     He claims that the court \"failed to\n\nproperly articulate how it determined that the number of hours expended was\n\nreasonable.\" He further alleges, \"It appears the trial court simply accepted the\n\nnumbers stated by Mrs. Castilleja's counsel and signed the order, without any\n\nindependent review of the reasonableness of amounts billed.\"\n\n\n\n\n       11 RCW 11.96A. 150(1).\n                                       -8-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/9\n\n\n\n\n      Generally, Washington courts apply the lodestar method to calculate\n\nattorney fees.12   The court awarding attorney fees makes its independent\n\ndetermination about the reasonableness of the fees requested.13\n\n      To apply the lodestar method, the court considers first the number of\n\nhours reasonably expended on the matter.14 \"'[T]he attorneys must provide\n\nreasonable documentation of the work performed.'\"15 This documentation must\n\ninclude at least (1) the number of hours worked, (2) the type of work performed,\n\nand (3) the category of attorney who performed the work.16 The court does not\nneed to conduct an hour-by-hour analysis of each lawyer's time sheets, so long\n\nas the court provides a consideration of the relevant factors and reasons\n\nsufficient to review the amount of the fee award.17 \"The awarding court should\n\ntake into account the hours spent on unsuccessful claims, duplicated effort, or\n\notherwise unproductive time.\"18\n\n\n       12 Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 433.\n      13 McGreevv v.

The trial court's November 18 order includes 68 findings of fact\n\nand 11 conclusions of law, which provides some indication of the complexity of\n\nthe contested issues. In the February 1 order, the court stated, \"To assess the\n\nreasonableness of the attorneys' fees requested by the Petitioner, the Court\n\n       19 McGreevv, 90 Wn.

He\n\nalso characterized Castilleja's attorneys as \"very ethical and very honest\" and\n\nstated that he \"had a very high opinion of the services they provide.\"\n\n      To perform its supervisory function, the trial court must make findings of\n\nfact and conclusions of law.26 Because the court made the findings required\n\nunder the lodestar method and because the court's findings support its\n\nconclusions of law and decision, we conclude that the trial court applied the\n\nlodestar method correctly.\n\n\n      26 Mahler, 135 Wn.2d at 435.\n                                       -11-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/12\n\n\n\n\n       In Hays's third challenge, he contends that the court did not adequately\n\nconsider his objections to the petition: \"Rather than engaging in a substantive\n\nanalysis, the trial court simply concluded that all fees were reasonable. The trial\n\ncourt should have entered findings indicating its consideration of and conclusions\n\nregarding the following specific objections raised by Mr. Hays.\" Hays objected on\n\nfive grounds: (1) fees incurred in presenting evidence on \"irrelevant issues\" and\n\npursuing unsuccessful claims; (2) fees incurred from the presence of two\n\nattorneys at trial; (3) fees incurred seeking discovery from Hays's former and\n\ncurrent attorneys;   (4) \"vague or     block billings that make it difficult or\n\nimpossible ... to determine whether the fees relate to the successful claims\";\n\nand (5) \"unnecessary costs,\" including costs for \"computerized legal research.\"\n\n       In the February 1 order, the trial court made a number of findings of fact\n\nand conclusions of law.     The court found that \"[t]he billing statements were\n\nsufficient and not vague\"; \"[t]he attorneys' fees and costs itemized in the billing\n\nstatements were reasonable and necessary, and should be approved\"; \"[t]he\n\nbilling records do not reflect any significant redundancy, waste or unnecessary\n\nservices\"; and \"[t]he court specifically rejects the arguments made by Mr. Hays\n\nregarding] the reasonableness of the fees or the manner in which the case was\n\npresented.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/13\n\n\n\n\n       Hays claims that In re Guardianship of Ivarsson27 requires the trial court to\n\nundertake a \"substantive analysis . . . which culminates in an explicit finding that\n\nthe requested fees are reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case.\"\n\nHays also relies upon Absher Construction Co. v. Kent School District No. 415,28\n\nwhich states, \"The court may discount hours spent on unsuccessful claims,\n\nduplicated effort, or otherwise unproductive time.\" Additionally, Hays argues that\n\nthe fee petition \"failed to segregate those fees incurred to establish a\n\nguardianship of the estate from those incurred on all other issues, including Mr.\n\nHays' prior estate planning, his management of HEP, and distributive issues\n\ndiscussed prior to the guardianship.\" Finally, Hays cites In re Estate of Larson29\n\nto argue that the attorney fee award may not include \"fees incurred in seeking\n\npayment of or defending objections to approval of fees.\"\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Hays's\n\nobjections to Castilleja's fee petition.    Hays cites no authority that requires the\n\ncourt to make a written finding stating its rationale for approving each specific\n\nitem in the fee petition. Hays's reliance on Ivarsson is misplaced. In Ivarsson,\n\nthe court denied a coguardian's request for attorney fees because the record\n\ncontained only the attorney's time records.           The court required additional\n\n       27 60 Wn.2d 733, 375 P.2d 509 (1962).\n       28 79 Wn.

Additionally, Absher Construction Co. does not require the court to\n\ndiscount certain hours. Again, RCW 11.96A.150(1) gives the court discretion to\n\ndecide what factors to consider, and counsel for Hays agreed at oral argument\n\nthat Castilleja's attorneys performed no unnecessary work or spent excessive\n\ntime on necessary work.\n\n       Further, it is well settled that if a statute is inconsistent with the common\n\nlaw, the statute abrogates the common law.31 Larson held that \"an attorney in\nprobate is not entitled to additional fees for attorneys and experts in proving the\n\nreasonableness of his fee in the final report.\"32 But RCW 11.96A.150 gives the\n\ntrial court broad discretion to include such fees in the award in an equitable\n\nmanner.   To the extent that Larson conflicts with the court's discretion under\n\nRCW 11.96A.150, the statute has abrogated that holding.33 Moreover, in Absher\nConstruction Co., we approved computer research expenses, concluding, \"The\n\nuse of computer-aided legal research is a norm in contemporary legal practice.\n\n\n       30 Ivarsson, 60 Wn.2d at 744.\n       31 State v.

Because the court's assessment was not\n\nmanifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds or reasons, we hold that\n\nthe February 1 order adequately addressed Hays's objections.\n\n       In addition to challenging the reasonableness of the attorney fees, Hays\n\nclaims that the trial court abused its discretion by failing \"to properly apportion\n\nwhat fees are to be paid by Mrs. Castilleja, by Mr. Hays and by the other entities\n\nbenefitted,\" including Hays's limited liability company and the trusts. He asserts\n\nthat \"[t]he only fees and costs properly assessed against Mr. Hays are those that\n\nwere incurred in seeking the appointment of a guardian of the estate.\"\n\nSpecifically, Hays contends that he should not be responsible for fees incurred\n\nbefore the guardianship proceeding commenced, fees that the attorneys incurred\n\nin recovering their fees and costs, and fees incurred after the guardianship was\n\nestablished because he claims that those actions did not benefit him.\n\n\n       In In re Estate of Black,35 the court stated,\n\n             The touchstone of an award of attorney fees from the estate\n      is whether the litigation resulted in a substantial benefit to the\n      estate. This does not mean that attorney fees may never be\n\n      34 Absher Const. Co.. 79 Wn. App. at 849.\n      35116 Wn.

There is no firm rule. .. . The trial court\n      must evaluate the particular action to determine if its benefit to the\n      estate was substantial.\n\nBut RCW 11.96A. 150(1) states,\n\n      Either the superior court or any court on an appeal may, in its\n      discretion, order costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to be\n      awarded to any party: (a) From any party to the proceedings; (b)\n      from   the   assets   of   the   estate   or   trust   involved   in   the\n      proceedings. . . . The court may order the costs, including\n      reasonable attorneys' fees, to be paid in such amount and in such\n      manner as the court determines to be equitable. In exercising its\n      discretion under this section, the court may consider any and all\n      factors that it deems to be relevant and appropriate, which factors\n      may but need not include whether the litigation benefits the estate\n      or trust involved.\n\n      In the November 18 order, the trial court stated, \"The Petitioner's request\n\nfor fees is governed by RCW 11.96A.150.\" It concluded, \"The court finds that it is\n\nequitable to award Petitioner her reasonable costs and attorneys' fees to be paid\n\nfrom the guardianship estate and/or any other asset/entity in which Mr. Arthur\n\nHays has a beneficial interest.\" The court noted, \"[T]he petition for guardianship\n\nwas filed in good faith, was necessary to protect Mr. Hays' assets and property\n\ninterests, and benefitted Mr. Hays' estate by resulting in the appointment of a\n\nguardian of the estate of Mr. Hays.\" On the court's February 1 order approving\n\nthe fee petition, the judge wrote, \"The fees and costs may be allocated to Hays\n\nElliott Properties LLC, Hays Distributing Corp., and Arthur D. Hays individually as\n\ndetermined by the guardian.\"\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/17\n\n\n\n\n       We do not accept Hays's arguments.         While Hays concedes that the\n\nlimited liability company and the trusts were not parties to the guardianship\n\nproceedings, he argues that the fact they benefitted from the guardianship\n\nwarrants apportioning some of the fees and costs to those entities. Hays cites jn\n\nre Guardianship of McKean36 for the notion that \"it is appropriate to allocate fees\n\n'amongst those who created the need for the guardianship.'\" But, in McKean, the\n\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the trial court ordered a party to pay the\n\nguardianship's attorney fees simply \"because the guardianship could not.\"37 In\n\nthat case, the trial court acted improperly because \"the simple ability to pay does\n\nnot provide an equitable basis for the award.       Rather, equity requires some\n\nfinding of fault that in fairness requires a party to pay.\"38 As an example, the\n\ncourt cited Gillespie v. Seattle-First National Bank,39 where the court concluded\n\nthat even absent bad faith or self-dealing, it was equitable to assess attorney\n\nfees against the trustee where, but for its breach of fiduciary duty, the\n\nbeneficiaries would not have needed to incur the fees.           Here, no evidence\n\nsuggests any fault as to the other entities. Accordingly, the court did not err by\n\ngiving the guardian discretion to allocate the fees and costs.\n\n\n\n       36 136 Wn.

This argument conflicts\n\nwith RCW 11.88.090(5)(f)(iv), which requires the guardian ad litem to investigate\n\nalternatives to guardianship.\n\n       Hays also cites Larson, In re Estate of Riemcke,40 and In re Guardianship\nof Adamec41 to support his claim that attorneys may not recover fees incurred in\n\nseeking fees.   These cases do not apply here.        As discussed above, RCW\n\n11.96A.150 abrogated Larson.       Riemcke held that a personal representative\n\ncannot collect attorney fees to the extent that the representative incurred the fees\n\nto protect his or her own interests as a beneficiary of the estate and not in\n\nfurtherance of its administration.42   Hay identifies no evidence showing that\n\nCastilleja benefitted in such an individual capacity.       Adamec concerned a\n\nguardian seeking fees under RCW 11.92.180,43 which does not apply here. The\n\"fees incurred after the guardianship\" concerned the attorneys' discussions with\n\ntheir client. Despite Hays's assertion, no evidence indicates that the matters they\n\ndiscussed were unrelated to establishing the guardianship or that the actions did\n\nnot benefit the estate.     The trial court properly exercised its discretion to\n\n\n\n\n       40 80 Wn.2d 722, 497 P.2d 1319 (1972).\n       41 100 Wn.2d 166, 667 P.2d 1085 (1983).\n       42 Riemcke, 80 Wn.2d at 735-36.\n       43 Adamec, 100 Wn.2d at 178-79.\n                                        -18-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/19\n\n\n\n\ndetermine the amount of and manner of paying the judgment.              Therefore, we\n\nreject this claim.\n\n       In addition to these specific objections to the fee petition, Hays asserts for\n\nthe first time on appeal that this court should deduct the specific fees he cites\n\nand then reduce the remainder by one half. He did not raise this argument in the\n\ntrial court and he cites no authority to support it, so we decline to consider it.44\n\n       Hays also alleges that \"it was inequitable for the court to direct entry of a\n\njudgment, with interest accruing at 12%, immediately, thereby unnecessarily\n\ndepleting Mr. Hays' estate.\" He argues that the court's actions were improper\n\nbecause (1) \"Mr. Hays does not have sufficient cash assets with which to pay the\n\nfees and he no longer has control of his assets\" and (2) the court \"should have\n\nexercised its discretion as to 'the manner of payment' of the approved fees under\n\nRCW 11.96A.150 to delay entry of the judgment at least until the guardian's\n\ninventory and petition for order authorizing disbursements was presented and\n\napproved.\"\n\n       With the exception of Hays's challenge to the interest on the judgment, as\n\nto this claim his appeal is untimely. Under RAP 2.2(a)(1), a party has a right to\n\nappeal a final judgment \"regardless of whether the judgment reserves for future\n\n\n\n       44 See RAP 2.5(a) (\"The appellate court may refuse to review any claim of\nerror which was not raised in the trial court.\").\n                                          -19-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/20\n\n\n\n\ndetermination an award of attorney fees or costs.\"45 RAP 5.2(a) requires filing a\n\nnotice of appeal within 30 days after the trial court enters its decision. While RAP\n\n2.4(b) allows a party to timely appeal a trial court's attorney fee decision, it\n\n\"makes clear that such an appeal does not allow a decision entered before the\n\naward of attorney fees to be reviewed (i.e., it does not bring up for review the\n\njudgment on the merits) unless timely notice of appeal was filed on that\n\ndecision.\"46\n\n       Here, Hays filed a notice of appeal more than 30 days after the court\n\nentered a judgment granting Castilleja's fee request but within 30 days of its\n\ndecision approving her fee petition. Because Hays's notice of appeal challenging\n\nthe court's decision to assess attorney fees against him was untimely, we do not\n\naddress it.\n\n\n       Although Hays timely challenges the interest on the judgment, his claim\n\nlacks merit.   Under RCW 4.56.110(4), \"judgments shall bear interest from the\n\ndate of entry.\" RCW 19.52.020(1 )(a) sets the interest amount at 12 percent per\n\nannum. Therefore, the court properly ordered that the principal judgment bear\n\ninterest at 12 percent per annum.\n\n\n\n\n       45 Carrara, LLC v. Ron & E Enters., Inc., 137 Wn.

He argues that these\n\ndocuments are necessary to determine (1) whether the court should have\n\nordered him to pay all of Castilleja's fees and costs, without allocating them to\n\nother entities, and (2) whether the court should have entered a judgment against\n\nhim before he demonstrated an ability to pay the judgment.\n\n      RAP 9.11(a) permits this court to allow a party to supplement the record\n\nwhere the party establishes each of six criteria, including, \"the additional\n\nevidence would probably change the decision being reviewed.\"47 First, Hays\noffers no reason that the inventory report and budget would probably change the\n\ndecision to enter a judgment against Hays's estate and give the guardian\n\ndiscretion to allocate the payment of the judgment; rather, he merely contends\n\n\n      47 The six criteria are\n\n         (1) additional proof of facts is needed to fairly resolve the issues\n         on review, (2) the additional evidence would probably change the\n         decision being reviewed, (3) it is equitable to excuse a party's\n         failure to present the evidence to the trial court, (4) the remedy\n         available to a party through postjudgment motions in the trial\n         court is inadequate or unnecessarily expensive, (5) the appellate\n         court remedy of granting a new trial is inadequate or\n         unnecessarily expensive, and (6) it would be inequitable to\n         decide the case solely on the evidence already taken in the trial\n         court.\n\n\nRAP 9.11(a).\n                                       -21-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/22\n\n\n\n\nthat the documents are \"necessary to resolve the issues\" that he asserts on\n\nappeal. The remainder of his motion asks us to revisit the trial court's November\n\n18 judgment that he does not timely challenge. Because Hays fails to establish\n\nall of the requirements in RAP 9.11(a), we deny his motion to supplement the\n\nrecord.\n\n\n          Both parties request costs and attorney fees incurred on appeal. Because\n\nCastilleja is the prevailing party, she filed the petition for guardianship in good\n\nfaith, the guardianship benefitted Hays, and she did not file the petition out of\n\npersonal interest or for personal gain, we award her costs and reasonable\n\nattorney fees under RAP 18.1 and RCW 11.96A.150.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n\n          Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\n\nfees and costs and acted within its discretion to order Hays's estate to pay the\n\nentire award and because Hays did not timely appeal the court's judgment\n\nassessing fees against his estate, we affirm the trial court's February 1 order and\n\naward costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal to Castilleja upon\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/23\n\n\n\n\nher compliance with applicable court rules.

He challenges the\n\nreasonableness of the fee award, the court's decision to assess the entire award\n\nagainst his estate, and the court's decision to enter its judgment immediately. He\n\nalso moves to supplement the record with the guardian's inventory report and\n\nbudget.

Because Hays's motion to supplement the record fails to\n\nmeet RAP 9.11(a)'s requirements, we deny his motion.\n\n                                     FACTS\n\n\n      Arthur D. Hays accumulated substantial wealth operating a wholesale\n\ndistributing business and acquiring real property to store his merchandise. He is\n\nthe trustee and beneficiary of the Hays Family Trust. When his wife died in 1980,\n\nher estate was transferred into this trust.   He has been the manager of Hays\n\nElliott Properties LLC (HEP) since he created it in 1999.         HEP owns and\n\nmanages real property.    In 2000, Hays created three irrevocable trusts.     Each\n\ntrust owns shares of HEP. Castilleja, Hays's daughter, became the successor\n\ntrustee of each trust in 2008. Hays also maintains a collection of vintage vehicles\n\nand owns the Hays Distributing Corporation, a wholesale distributing business.\n\nAdditionally, he owns property in Suquamish, Washington, that is part of the\n\nHays Millers Bay Limited Partnership; a residence in the Magnolia neighborhood\n\nin Seattle; a condominium in the Alki area; and real estate on West Commodore\n\nWay. The case involves assets valued at approximately $28 million.\n\n       In March 2011, Castilleja filed a petition seeking the appointment of a\n\nguardian of Hays's estate. Hays's son Howard supported the guardianship, but\n\nHays and his son Robert opposed it. On November 18, 2011, after a six-day\n\nbench trial, the trial court found Hays incapacitated as to his estate. The court\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/3\n\n\n\n\nappointed an independent professional guardian, finding, \"There is family conflict\n\nand all of Mr. Hays' children at any given time could stand to benefit from any\n\ndecision or error that Mr. Hays might make, thus making appointment of a\n\nguardian independent of the family necessary.\"\n\n       In the November 18 order, the court also concluded that Castilleja should\n\nrecover her reasonable costs and          attorney fees incurred bringing the\n\nguardianship action.   The court's order provides for the determination of the\n\nreasonableness of these fees \"under the lodestar measure by separate motion.\"\n\nThe court ordered the guardian to file an inventory of Hays's property within three\n\nmonths.\n\n\n       On February 1, 2012, the trial court entered a judgment in favor of\n\nCastilleja for $380,592.92, representing $352,755.36 in attorney fees and\n\n$27,837.56 in costs.     The judgment authorized the guardian to pay it and\n\nprovided for payment from \"the guardianship estate and/or any other asset/entity\n\nin which Mr. Arthur Hays has a beneficial interest.\"\n\n      On February 29, Hays filed a notice of appeal, seeking review of both the\n\nFebruary 1, 2012, order and designated portions of the November 18, 2011,\n\norder. On May 7, 2012, Hays filed a motion to supplement the record.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/4\n\n\n\n\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n\n      We apply a two-part standard to review a trial court judgment awarding\n\nattorney fees: \"(1) we review de novo whether there is a legal basis for awarding\n\nattorney fees by statute, under contract, or in equity and (2) we review a\n\ndiscretionary decision to award or deny attorney fees and the reasonableness of\n\nany attorney fee award for an abuse of discretion.\"1 The parties do not dispute\n\nthe statutory basis2 for the court's authority to award attorney fees. Thus, we\n\napply the second part of this review standard.\n\n      When reviewing a trial court's decision for abuse of discretion, we will\n\nuphold the decision unless it is \"'manifestly unreasonable, or exercised on\n\nuntenable grounds, or for untenable reasons.'\"3 A court makes a manifestly\n\nunreasonable decision if it falls outside the range of acceptable choices, given\n\nthe facts and the applicable legal standard; a court bases its decision on\n\nuntenable grounds if the record does not support the court's factual findings; a\n\n\n      1 Gander v.

He contends that the case presented no novel issues about the\n\nestablishment of a guardianship; that Castilleja's attorneys offered excessive and\n\nirrelevant evidence; that the participation of two attorneys produced an excessive\n\ncombined hourly rate, although the individual rate for each attorney was\n\nreasonable; that counsel expended considerable time presenting irrelevant\n\n\n       5 Hays cites the former rule, which contained only eight factors.

In\n\nfact, in Hallauer, we cited our Supreme Court's unanimous decision in McNearv\n\nv.

Kent School District No. 415,28\n\nwhich states, \"The court may discount hours spent on unsuccessful claims,\n\nduplicated effort, or otherwise unproductive time.\" Additionally, Hays argues that\n\nthe fee petition \"failed to segregate those fees incurred to establish a\n\nguardianship of the estate from those incurred on all other issues, including Mr.\n\nHays' prior estate planning, his management of HEP, and distributive issues\n\ndiscussed prior to the guardianship.\" Finally, Hays cites In re Estate of Larson29\n\nto argue that the attorney fee award may not include \"fees incurred in seeking\n\npayment of or defending objections to approval of fees.\"\n\n       The trial court did not abuse its discretion when it rejected Hays's\n\nobjections to Castilleja's fee petition.

Because the court's assessment was not\n\nmanifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds or reasons, we hold that\n\nthe February 1 order adequately addressed Hays's objections.\n\n       In addition to challenging the reasonableness of the attorney fees, Hays\n\nclaims that the trial court abused its discretion by failing \"to properly apportion\n\nwhat fees are to be paid by Mrs. Castilleja, by Mr. Hays and by the other entities\n\nbenefitted,\" including Hays's limited liability company and the trusts. He asserts\n\nthat \"[t]he only fees and costs properly assessed against Mr. Hays are those that\n\nwere incurred in seeking the appointment of a guardian of the estate.\"\n\nSpecifically, Hays contends that he should not be responsible for fees incurred\n\nbefore the guardianship proceeding commenced, fees that the attorneys incurred\n\nin recovering their fees and costs, and fees incurred after the guardianship was\n\nestablished because he claims that those actions did not benefit him.\n\n\n       In In re Estate of Black,35 the court stated,\n\n             The touchstone of an award of attorney fees from the estate\n      is whether the litigation resulted in a substantial benefit to the\n      estate.

There is no firm rule. .. . The trial court\n      must evaluate the particular action to determine if its benefit to the\n      estate was substantial.\n\nBut RCW 11.96A. 150(1) states,\n\n      Either the superior court or any court on an appeal may, in its\n      discretion, order costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, to be\n      awarded to any party: (a) From any party to the proceedings; (b)\n      from   the   assets   of   the   estate   or   trust   involved   in   the\n      proceedings. . . . The court may order the costs, including\n      reasonable attorneys' fees, to be paid in such amount and in such\n      manner as the court determines to be equitable. In exercising its\n      discretion under this section, the court may consider any and all\n      factors that it deems to be relevant and appropriate, which factors\n      may but need not include whether the litigation benefits the estate\n      or trust involved.\n\n      In the November 18 order, the trial court stated, \"The Petitioner's request\n\nfor fees is governed by RCW 11.96A.150.\" It concluded, \"The court finds that it is\n\nequitable to award Petitioner her reasonable costs and attorneys' fees to be paid\n\nfrom the guardianship estate and/or any other asset/entity in which Mr. Arthur\n\nHays has a beneficial interest.\" The court noted, \"[T]he petition for guardianship\n\nwas filed in good faith, was necessary to protect Mr. Hays' assets and property\n\ninterests, and benefitted Mr. Hays' estate by resulting in the appointment of a\n\nguardian of the estate of Mr. Hays.\" On the court's February 1 order approving\n\nthe fee petition, the judge wrote, \"The fees and costs may be allocated to Hays\n\nElliott Properties LLC, Hays Distributing Corp., and Arthur D. Hays individually as\n\ndetermined by the guardian.\"\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/17\n\n\n\n\n       We do not accept Hays's arguments.         While Hays concedes that the\n\nlimited liability company and the trusts were not parties to the guardianship\n\nproceedings, he argues that the fact they benefitted from the guardianship\n\nwarrants apportioning some of the fees and costs to those entities. Hays cites jn\n\nre Guardianship of McKean36 for the notion that \"it is appropriate to allocate fees\n\n'amongst those who created the need for the guardianship.'\" But, in McKean, the\n\nCourt of Appeals concluded that the trial court ordered a party to pay the\n\nguardianship's attorney fees simply \"because the guardianship could not.\"37 In\n\nthat case, the trial court acted improperly because \"the simple ability to pay does\n\nnot provide an equitable basis for the award.       Rather, equity requires some\n\nfinding of fault that in fairness requires a party to pay.\"38 As an example, the\n\ncourt cited Gillespie v. Seattle-First National Bank,39 where the court concluded\n\nthat even absent bad faith or self-dealing, it was equitable to assess attorney\n\nfees against the trustee where, but for its breach of fiduciary duty, the\n\nbeneficiaries would not have needed to incur the fees.           Here, no evidence\n\nsuggests any fault as to the other entities. Accordingly, the court did not err by\n\ngiving the guardian discretion to allocate the fees and costs.\n\n\n\n       36 </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Wash.

This argument conflicts\n\nwith RCW 11.88.090(5)(f)(iv), which requires the guardian ad litem to investigate\n\nalternatives to guardianship.\n\n       Hays also cites Larson, In re Estate of Riemcke,40 and In re Guardianship\nof Adamec41 to support his claim that attorneys may not recover fees incurred in\n\nseeking fees.   These cases do not apply here.        As discussed above, RCW\n\n11.96A.150 abrogated Larson.       Riemcke held that a personal representative\n\ncannot collect attorney fees to the extent that the representative incurred the fees\n\nto protect his or her own interests as a beneficiary of the estate and not in\n\nfurtherance of its administration.42   Hay identifies no evidence showing that\n\nCastilleja benefitted in such an individual capacity.       Adamec concerned a\n\nguardian seeking fees under RCW 11.92.180,43 which does not apply here. The\n\"fees incurred after the guardianship\" concerned the attorneys' discussions with\n\ntheir client. Despite Hays's assertion, no evidence indicates that the matters they\n\ndiscussed were unrelated to establishing the guardianship or that the actions did\n\nnot benefit the estate.

Therefore, we\n\nreject this claim.\n\n       In addition to these specific objections to the fee petition, Hays asserts for\n\nthe first time on appeal that this court should deduct the specific fees he cites\n\nand then reduce the remainder by one half. He did not raise this argument in the\n\ntrial court and he cites no authority to support it, so we decline to consider it.44\n\n       Hays also alleges that \"it was inequitable for the court to direct entry of a\n\njudgment, with interest accruing at 12%, immediately, thereby unnecessarily\n\ndepleting Mr. Hays' estate.\" He argues that the court's actions were improper\n\nbecause (1) \"Mr. Hays does not have sufficient cash assets with which to pay the\n\nfees and he no longer has control of his assets\" and (2) the court \"should have\n\nexercised its discretion as to 'the manner of payment' of the approved fees under\n\nRCW 11.96A.150 to delay entry of the judgment at least until the guardian's\n\ninventory and petition for order authorizing disbursements was presented and\n\napproved.\"\n\n       With the exception of Hays's challenge to the interest on the judgment, as\n\nto this claim his appeal is untimely. Under RAP 2.2(a)(1), a party has a right to\n\nappeal a final judgment \"regardless of whether the judgment reserves for future\n\n\n\n       44 See RAP 2.5(a) (\"The appellate court may refuse to review any claim of\nerror which was not raised in the trial court.\").\n                                          -19-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/20\n\n\n\n\ndetermination an award of attorney fees or costs.\"45 RAP 5.2(a) requires filing a\n\nnotice of appeal within 30 days after the trial court enters its decision. While RAP\n\n2.4(b) allows a party to timely appeal a trial court's attorney fee decision, it\n\n\"makes clear that such an appeal does not allow a decision entered before the\n\naward of attorney fees to be reviewed (i.e., it does not bring up for review the\n\njudgment on the merits) unless timely notice of appeal was filed on that\n\ndecision.\"46\n\n       Here, Hays filed a notice of appeal more than 30 days after the court\n\nentered a judgment granting Castilleja's fee request but within 30 days of its\n\ndecision approving her fee petition. Because Hays's notice of appeal challenging\n\nthe court's decision to assess attorney fees against him was untimely, we do not\n\naddress it.\n\n\n       Although Hays timely challenges the interest on the judgment, his claim\n\nlacks merit.   Under RCW 4.56.110(4), \"judgments shall bear interest from the\n\ndate of entry.\" RCW 19.52.020(1 )(a) sets the interest amount at 12 percent per\n\nannum. Therefore, the court properly ordered that the principal judgment bear\n\ninterest at 12 percent per annum.\n\n\n\n\n       45 Carrara, LLC v.

He argues that these\n\ndocuments are necessary to determine (1) whether the court should have\n\nordered him to pay all of Castilleja's fees and costs, without allocating them to\n\nother entities, and (2) whether the court should have entered a judgment against\n\nhim before he demonstrated an ability to pay the judgment.\n\n      RAP 9.11(a) permits this court to allow a party to supplement the record\n\nwhere the party establishes each of six criteria, including, \"the additional\n\nevidence would probably change the decision being reviewed.\"47 First, Hays\noffers no reason that the inventory report and budget would probably change the\n\ndecision to enter a judgment against Hays's estate and give the guardian\n\ndiscretion to allocate the payment of the judgment; rather, he merely contends\n\n\n      47 The six criteria are\n\n         (1) additional proof of facts is needed to fairly resolve the issues\n         on review, (2) the additional evidence would probably change the\n         decision being reviewed, (3) it is equitable to excuse a party's\n         failure to present the evidence to the trial court, (4) the remedy\n         available to a party through postjudgment motions in the trial\n         court is inadequate or unnecessarily expensive, (5) the appellate\n         court remedy of granting a new trial is inadequate or\n         unnecessarily expensive, and (6) it would be inequitable to\n         decide the case solely on the evidence already taken in the trial\n         court.\n\n\nRAP 9.11(a).\n                                       -21-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/22\n\n\n\n\nthat the documents are \"necessary to resolve the issues\" that he asserts on\n\nappeal. The remainder of his motion asks us to revisit the trial court's November\n\n18 judgment that he does not timely challenge. Because Hays fails to establish\n\nall of the requirements in RAP 9.11(a), we deny his motion to supplement the\n\nrecord.\n\n\n          Both parties request costs and attorney fees incurred on appeal. Because\n\nCastilleja is the prevailing party, she filed the petition for guardianship in good\n\nfaith, the guardianship benefitted Hays, and she did not file the petition out of\n\npersonal interest or for personal gain, we award her costs and reasonable\n\nattorney fees under RAP 18.1 and RCW 11.96A.150.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n\n          Because the trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorney\n\nfees and costs and acted within its discretion to order Hays's estate to pay the\n\nentire award and because Hays did not timely appeal the court's judgment\n\nassessing fees against his estate, we affirm the trial court's February 1 order and\n\naward costs and reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal to Castilleja upon\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\fNO. 68419-1-1/23\n\n\n\n\nher compliance with applicable court rules.
