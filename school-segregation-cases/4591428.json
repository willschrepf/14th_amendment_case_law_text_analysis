Section 201.051   of the\nTax Code provides:        “There is imposed a tax on each producer    of gas.”\nSection   201.052 further     provides:\n\n                        (a) The tax imposed by this     chapter\n                     is at the rate   of 7.5 percent     of the\n                     market value  of gas produced   and saved\n                     in this state by the producer.\n\nSections   201.101     and 201.102   respectively       provide:\n\n               The market value   of gas             is its   value  at   the\n            mouth of the well from which             it is produced.\n\n                If gas is sold for cash only,       the tax shall be\n            computed on the producer’s       gross    cash receipts.\n            Payments from the purchaser      of gas to a producer\n            for the purpose     of reimbursing     the producer     for\n            taxes due under this     chapter   are not part of the\n            gross cash receipts.\n\n        Section    201.001(5)      defines  producer     to include     royalty   owner.\nThe state,       however,     has been held to be exempt from severance               tax\nliability      even though as a royalty      owner it falls      within   the statutory\ndefinition      of producer.        Group Number 1 Oil Corporation         v. Sheppard,\n89 S.W.2d       1021 (Tex.      Civ.   App. - Austin      1935. writ    ref’d).    Under\nsection     201.051,    the tax collection      obligation     is imposed on the gas\nproducer.\n\n      Returning   to the above hypothetical.      further   assume that there\nhas been no increase      in severance    tax since     the execution    of the\ncontract   between   “A” and “B”.

Thus, the state’s    royalty     of twenty percent   of\nthe market value     of the gross production     is a minimum of $1.064.80,\nnot $1.000.00.    The royalty    due may be higher     than that if comparable\nsales dictate   that result   but it cannot be less.\n\n        Certain     producers,     in advocating       the second     royalty      calculation\nmethod noted above,          have contended       that it is inequitable          to reach the\nforegoing      conclusion      because    to do so results        in the state        receiving\nmore for its portion            of total    production     than the producer          receives.\nUnder the approach           advocated     by those producers,         both the state          and\nthe producer        would be compensated          at a rate of $5.00 per mcf net of\nseverance      tax.     This result      strikes    those producers       as the only just\nresult.       The result,        however,     is   that   the state      receives       a lower\nroyalty     than the producer        who is liable       for severance       tax.     Severance\ntax liability         is a cost of doing business            to which the state           is not\nsubject.       Adopting     a formula to protect        producers    from that expense is\nno more justified            than adopting       one which takes        into    account,       for\nexample,     federal     income tax liability.\n\n      The argument     made by those               producers    seems premised   on the\nmisapprehension    that the severance             tax is paid on particular     units of\ngas, like an ad valorem tax.      It is            not.   It is a tax on the privilege\nof engaging     in the business     of            producing    gas  in Texas   which   is\ncomputed on the basis of the amount                of gas produced.\n\n        The conclusion         advocated      by those     producers     does not,        in any\n event,     follow      from the analysis         which    they make.        If     the state’s\n fractional        part of production,        that is.    the percentage         of production\n reflected        in   the   state’s      royalty    share.     is.   as those         producers\n advocate       it    should    be.    segregated     from    the    total      production      in\n measuring        the royalties      due to the state           the result         is a higher\n royalty      than that      resulting      from the calculation           advocated      by the\n\n\n\n                                            p.   2002\n\fMr. Bob Armstrong        - Page 4          (Mw-550)\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Land Off ice.          The result       of that analysis           is that there are.\nin effect.      two sales of gas:          one    sale   of   200   mcf   of  gas at $5.00 per\nmcf reflecting       the state’s       share,      and   one   sale    of   800  mcf of gas at\n$5.405 per mcf,       reflecting      the   producer’  s     share.      Since   the   producer’s\nshare is a directly          comparable      sale under free market conditions,                  the\ncharacterization       of the transaction           between “A” and “B” in that manner\nresults     in the state         receiving        200 mcf times           $5.405     per mcf or\n$1,081.00     rather     than the $1,064.80            resulting      from the General        Land\nOffice’s     method of calculation.              That result,        however.     is artificial\nsince    the     transaction      is,     in fact,        only    one sale        of   gas.     The\npurchaser      has agreed      to pay and the producer                 baa agreed       to accept\n$5.324.00     for 1000 mcf of gas, not $1.000.00                 for 200 mcf and $4.324.00\n for 800 mcf.\n\n        Thus,    absent    price  controls,    the    state’s      royalty       is   to be\ncalculated       on the basis     of   the entire      consideration         paid    to the\nstate’s      lessee    for   the production    from the state           lease     including\nseverance      tax reimbursement.     Whether the existence         of the Natural Gas\nPolicy    Act of 1978 (hereinafter       NGPA). 15 U.S.C.       section     3301 et seq.,\nalters     this    result   as to production      covered     by its      terms will        be\ndiscussed.     next.\n\n        The NGPA sets    ceiling prices on initial  sales   of                     natural     gas.\nTitle    15, section  3320 of the United States Code provides:\n\n                    (a)    a price     for the first   sale of natural      gas\n               shall     not be considered         to exceed     the maximum\n               lawful     price..   . if such first      sale  price   exceeds\n               the maximum lawful          price  to the extent      necessary\n               to      recover      --     (1)   State     Severance      taxes\n               attributable       to the production     of such natural      gas\n               borne by the seller....\n\n Thus, one who has natural            gas which has not previously        been sold can\n sell    that gas for the applicable            ceiling   price   plus any applicable\n severance       taxes for which that individual          is liable.      The fact    that\n section     201.001     of the Tax Code defines        producer    to include    royalty\n owner and that the state,            although  nominally    a producer    where it owns\n royalty      interests,    is exempt from severance          tax liability     does not\n make the state a seller          within    the meaning of the NGPA and. therefore,\n subject     to the price     limitations.\n\n        If we amend the foregoing          hypothetical       so that the gas            produced\n by “A” is subject         to the NGPA’s price        ceiling     and the base           contract\n price    of $5.00 per mcf of gas is the ceiling                price,    we have        the same\n economic     result    between “A” and “8”.        The royalty        calculation          issue.\n however,      requires     additional    analysis      due to the supreme                 court’s\n holding    in Exxon v. Middleton.         613 S.W.2d 240 (Tex.            1981).        that the\n stat”8     of    g=s    under    federal   price     control       is   relevant          to    the\n determination       of market value for royalty         calculation      purposes.\n\n\n\n\n                                              p.   2003\n\fMr. Bob Armstrong       - Page 5       (NW-550)\n\n\n\n\n        As noted     above,      the    transaction      between     “A” and “B” can be\ncharacterized     as, in effect,          two sales:      one of the state’s      200 mcf of\ngas, as to which no severance               tax is due for the $5.00 ceiling            price;\nand one of “A’s” 800 mcf of gas, as to vhich severance                       tax is due for\nthe     $5.00   ceiling        price     plus     $.405    per    mcf   as   severance       tax\nreimbursement.         If     this     characterization        is  legitimate’      then     the\nstate’s     gas sold      for    $5.00    per mcf and the sale           of ‘A’s”     gas for\n$5.405 per mcf is not a comparable                  sale under the Middleton       analysis.\nFrom “B’ a” perspective,             however’     the transaction       appears   different.\n‘B’ purchases      1000 mcf of gas for $5’324.00,               or for $5.324 per mcf.\n\n      As noted above,       the severance      tax is an occupation        tax not an ad\nvalorem    tax.      The use      in our hypothetical           of  80% of     the   total\nproduction    as a basis       of calculating        the severance    tax due from “A”\ndoes not imply that          there    are two sales       of gas.      That calculation\nmerely reflects       an allocation     of the tax liability       resulting     from that\nproduction      activity.       The tax     liability      is  necessary     because    the\nseverance    tax statute      defines    producer     to include   royalty    owner.    The\nNGPA does not purport         to limit    the amount of royalty       which may be paid\nfor gas produced.\n\n       The state    owns a royalty     interest.    A royalty    owner’s      right  to\nreceive     payment of the money due upon production            is a contractual\nright   to a money judgment.       Shell Oil Company v. State,      442 S.W.2d 457\n(Tex. Civ. App. - Houston [14th Dist.]           1969, writ ref’d    n.r.e.).       The\nresult    in that case is not inconsistent          with the taxability          of the\nroyalty    interest   as an interest     in real property   under the ad valorem\ntax statutes.\n\n       We note that a federal          district    court   in Oklahoma has construed\nsection    3320 of the United          States   Code differently.       See Hoover and\nBracken Energies,       Inc.   v. United States         Department   ofthe     Interior,\nNo. 81-461-T      (W.D. Okla.,     filed    Nov. 18, 1981).       However,  this ruling\nis    not   binding    upon    us,      it   is  on appeal,       and appears      to    be\ninconsistent     with Mobil Oil Corporation            v. Federal    Power Commission,\n463 F.2d 256 (D.C. Cir. 1972).\n\n      In summary, there       is only one sale of 1000 mcf of gas and the\nstate    is    entitled,   as its   royalty,   to a minimum of    20% of  the\nconsideration       paid by “8” and received    by “A” in that sale.   “A” is\nmaking,     just    as in the free   market situation,   one sale  of gas for\n$5.00 per mcf plus any severance        taxes due.\n\n     The foregoing  result   is to be distinguished                 from the result   under\nthe NGPA, 15 U.S.C.    section   3316(b),   Intrastate                Rollover  Contracts.\nPart (2)(A)  of that subsection   provides:\n\n              In    the    case      of     any    first  sale  under     any\n              [intrastate]      roll-over       contract of natural   gas...\n              which constitutes         a State government’s...      natural\n              w*      production,        or     royalty   share   or   other\n\n\n\n                                           p.   2004\n\fMr. Bob Armstrong        - Page 6          (MW-550)\n\n\n\n\n              interests...    in   natural    gas   production...                the\n              maximum lawful      price...    shall    be   the              maximum\n              lawful price...    under section    3312.\n\n       This constitutes          an exception         to a general        rule      under section\n3316(b)     which provides          for   a maximum price          of $1.00         (adjusted      for\ninflation)       or    the    old     contract      price,    whichever         is     higher,     for\nintrastate      rollover      contract     gas.     This price       will   generally        be less\nthan that allowed         for the natural         gas constituting        the state's         royalty\nshare.      The   effect     of   section      3316(b)     of  the   NGPA    is     to   create     tvo\ncategories      of gas,      that is.       to   work   the   kind    of   segregation         of   the\nhypothetical        100 mcf of gas which certain                producers        have advocated.\nThe fact       that    the terms of the NGPA do not alter                          the state        law\nregarding      the obligations          among the parties           is irrelevant.             By its\nvery    terms,    section      3316 segregates,          for the purpose           of determining\nprice,     the gas attributable           to the state's         royalty     interest       from the\nremainder of the gas produced.\n\n                                           SUMMARY\n\n                   The state's     royalty     on gas is calculated          on the\n               basis of the market value of the gas produced,                    but\n               is    in no event        less     than \"the      price     paid     or\n               offered     to the producer.\"          There is no basis            in\n               law for the treatment           of the sale as, in effect,\n               two     sales    at   different       prices'       one    of    that\n               percentage     of the gas equal to the state's               royalty\n               percentage      and one of the remainder               of the gas\n               produced.

Thus, the state’s    royalty     of twenty percent   of\nthe market value     of the gross production     is a minimum of $1.064.80,\nnot $1.000.00.    The royalty    due may be higher     than that if comparable\nsales dictate   that result   but it cannot be less.\n\n        Certain     producers,     in advocating       the second     royalty      calculation\nmethod noted above,          have contended       that it is inequitable          to reach the\nforegoing      conclusion      because    to do so results        in the state        receiving\nmore for its portion            of total    production     than the producer          receives.\nUnder the approach           advocated     by those producers,         both the state          and\nthe producer        would be compensated          at a rate of $5.00 per mcf net of\nseverance      tax.     This result      strikes    those producers       as the only just\nresult.       The result,        however,     is   that   the state      receives       a lower\nroyalty     than the producer        who is liable       for severance       tax.     Severance\ntax liability         is a cost of doing business            to which the state           is not\nsubject.       Adopting     a formula to protect        producers    from that expense is\nno more justified            than adopting       one which takes        into    account,       for\nexample,     federal     income tax liability.\n\n      The argument     made by those               producers    seems premised   on the\nmisapprehension    that the severance             tax is paid on particular     units of\ngas, like an ad valorem tax.      It is            not.   It is a tax on the privilege\nof engaging     in the business     of            producing    gas  in Texas   which   is\ncomputed on the basis of the amount                of gas produced.\n\n        The conclusion         advocated      by those     producers     does not,        in any\n event,     follow      from the analysis         which    they make.        If     the state’s\n fractional        part of production,        that is.    the percentage         of production\n reflected        in   the   state’s      royalty    share.     is.   as those         producers\n advocate       it    should    be.    segregated     from    the    total      production      in\n measuring        the royalties      due to the state           the result         is a higher\n royalty      than that      resulting      from the calculation           advocated      by the\n\n\n\n                                            p.   2002\n\fMr. Bob Armstrong        - Page 4          (Mw-550)\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Land Off ice.          The result       of that analysis           is that there are.\nin effect.      two sales of gas:          one    sale   of   200   mcf   of  gas at $5.00 per\nmcf reflecting       the state’s       share,      and   one   sale    of   800  mcf of gas at\n$5.405 per mcf,       reflecting      the   producer’  s     share.      Since   the   producer’s\nshare is a directly          comparable      sale under free market conditions,                  the\ncharacterization       of the transaction           between “A” and “B” in that manner\nresults     in the state         receiving        200 mcf times           $5.405     per mcf or\n$1,081.00     rather     than the $1,064.80            resulting      from the General        Land\nOffice’s     method of calculation.              That result,        however.     is artificial\nsince    the     transaction      is,     in fact,        only    one sale        of   gas.     The\npurchaser      has agreed      to pay and the producer                 baa agreed       to accept\n$5.324.00     for 1000 mcf of gas, not $1.000.00                 for 200 mcf and $4.324.00\n for 800 mcf.\n\n        Thus,    absent    price  controls,    the    state’s      royalty       is   to be\ncalculated       on the basis     of   the entire      consideration         paid    to the\nstate’s      lessee    for   the production    from the state           lease     including\nseverance      tax reimbursement.     Whether the existence         of the Natural Gas\nPolicy    Act of 1978 (hereinafter       NGPA). 15 U.S.C.       section     3301 et seq.,\nalters     this    result   as to production      covered     by its      terms will        be\ndiscussed.     next.\n\n        The NGPA sets    ceiling prices on initial  sales   of                     natural     gas.\nTitle    15, section  3320 of the United States Code provides:\n\n                    (a)    a price     for the first   sale of natural      gas\n               shall     not be considered         to exceed     the maximum\n               lawful     price..   . if such first      sale  price   exceeds\n               the maximum lawful          price  to the extent      necessary\n               to      recover      --     (1)   State     Severance      taxes\n               attributable       to the production     of such natural      gas\n               borne by the seller....\n\n Thus, one who has natural            gas which has not previously        been sold can\n sell    that gas for the applicable            ceiling   price   plus any applicable\n severance       taxes for which that individual          is liable.      The fact    that\n section     201.001     of the Tax Code defines        producer    to include    royalty\n owner and that the state,            although  nominally    a producer    where it owns\n royalty      interests,    is exempt from severance          tax liability     does not\n make the state a seller          within    the meaning of the NGPA and. therefore,\n subject     to the price     limitations.\n\n        If we amend the foregoing          hypothetical       so that the gas            produced\n by “A” is subject         to the NGPA’s price        ceiling     and the base           contract\n price    of $5.00 per mcf of gas is the ceiling                price,    we have        the same\n economic     result    between “A” and “8”.        The royalty        calculation          issue.\n however,      requires     additional    analysis      due to the supreme                 court’s\n holding    in Exxon v.

If     this     characterization        is  legitimate’      then     the\nstate’s     gas sold      for    $5.00    per mcf and the sale           of ‘A’s”     gas for\n$5.405 per mcf is not a comparable                  sale under the Middleton       analysis.\nFrom “B’ a” perspective,             however’     the transaction       appears   different.\n‘B’ purchases      1000 mcf of gas for $5’324.00,               or for $5.324 per mcf.\n\n      As noted above,       the severance      tax is an occupation        tax not an ad\nvalorem    tax.      The use      in our hypothetical           of  80% of     the   total\nproduction    as a basis       of calculating        the severance    tax due from “A”\ndoes not imply that          there    are two sales       of gas.      That calculation\nmerely reflects       an allocation     of the tax liability       resulting     from that\nproduction      activity.       The tax     liability      is  necessary     because    the\nseverance    tax statute      defines    producer     to include   royalty    owner.    The\nNGPA does not purport         to limit    the amount of royalty       which may be paid\nfor gas produced.\n\n       The state    owns a royalty     interest.    A royalty    owner’s      right  to\nreceive     payment of the money due upon production            is a contractual\nright   to a money judgment.       Shell Oil Company v.
