No. 07-cv-01076)\n                       District Judge: Honorable Malcolm Muir\n\n\n                    Submitted Pursuant to Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                                    June 11, 2008\n\n               Before: AMBRO, FUENTES and FISHER, Circuit Judges\n\n                                  (Filed: July 14, 2008 )\n\n\n\n\n                                        OPINION\n\n\nPER CURIAM\n\n      This is an appeal from the District Court’s denial of William Greer’s petition for\n\nwrit of habeas corpus. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n       In June 2007, Appellant, a federal prisoner formerly confined at the Federal Prison\nCamp (FPC-Devens) and Federal Medical Center in Devens (FMC-Devens) in\n\fMassachusetts and now incarcerated in Pennsylvania, initiated a pro se petition for writ of\nhabeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Appellant’s petition contended that his Fifth\nand Eighth Amendment rights were violated during the course of a prison disciplinary\nhearing, where he was found to have committed Conduct Which Disrupts or Interferes\nwith the Security or Orderly Running of the Institution, a violation of Disciplinary Code\nSection 199 (“Section 199”). Disciplinary proceedings were initiated after prison\nofficials at FMC-Devens discovered a cell phone which they traced back to Greer. On\nNovember 16, 2006 Greer was served with an incident report for Use of a Telephone for\nAbuses other than Criminal Activity, a violation of Disciplinary Code Section 305 and\nPossession of Anything not Authorized, a violation of Disciplinary Code Section 197.\nDue to the seriousness of the charges, the Unit Disciplinary Committee (“UDC”) referred\nthe charges to a Disciplinary Hearing Officer (“DHO”). On November 29, the DHO\nadvised Greer that instead of being charged with violations of Sections 197 and 305, he\nwas being charged with a violation of Section 199. On December 6, after rescheduling\nthe hearing in order to give Greer a chance to prepare his defense, the DHO found that\nGreer committed the charged offense and sanctioned him to 45 days of disciplinary\nsegregation, a two year loss of telephone privileges, disallowance of forty days of good\nconduct time, and recommended a disciplinary transfer from FPC-Devens.\n        Greer, in his petition, claimed that he received inadequate notice of the charges,\nthat there was insufficient evidence of misconduct relied upon to find him guilty, and that\nthe DHO was biased in making his ruling. On November 30, 2007 the District Court\ndenied the petition, and Greer filed a timely notice of appeal.1\n        We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a). We\nreview a District Court’s denial of habeas corpus relief de novo. Vega v. United States,\n493 F.3d 310, 314 (3d Cir. 2007).\n        In Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974), the United States Supreme Court\nacknowledged that the loss of good time credits may create a liberty interest protected by\nthe Due Process Clause. While Greer is a federal prisoner, and therefore his case is\ngoverned by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, we assume the federal\ngovernment may also confer such liberty interests on prisoners. See Vega, 493 F.3d at\n317 n.4. Greer’s due process rights, however, are limited to: 1) an impartial decision-\nmaking body; 2) twenty-four hour advance notice of the charges; 3) an opportunity to call\nwitnesses and present documentary evidence; 4) assistance from a representative; and 5) a\nwritten decision explaining the evidence relied upon. Wolff, 418 U.S. at 563-67.\n        For substantially the reasons given by the District Court, we conclude that Greer\nreceived all of the required procedural rights set forth in Wolff. Despite Greer’s\n\n\n\n       1\n       Greer does not challenge the District Court’s ruling on the sufficiency of the\nevidence.\n\n                                            -2-\n\fargument to the contrary, nothing in the Bureau of Prisons regulations prevents the DHO\nfrom changing the offense charge in the Incident Report prior to a disciplinary hearing.\nGreer had notice that possession of a cell phone would be treated as Conduct Which\nDisrupts or Interferes with the Security or Orderly Running of the Institution since the\nwarden issued a memorandum to the prison population on June 15, 2006 explicitly stating\nthat prisoners would be charged under Section 199 for possession of a cell phone.\nMoreover, after the change in the charging document, Greer had one week to marshal\nevidence in support of his defense to the charge of violating Section 199. The District\nCourt correctly determined that the DHO did not violate Greer’s due process rights by\nchanging the Incident Report to reflect a more appropriate offense in line with prison\npolicy.\n        Greer’s second argument, that because the DHO changed the charging document\nhe became the “charging officer” and therefore violated his duty to be an impartial\ndecision maker, is likewise meritless. Greer presented no evidence that the DHO was\ninvolved in reporting or investigating the cell phone incident, or was in any way\npersonally or substantially involved in the circumstances underlying charge. See 28\nC.F.R. § 541.16(b); see also Meyers v. Alldredge, 492 F.2d 296, 306 (3d Cir. 1974) (“the\nrequirement of an impartial tribunal prohibits only those officials who have a direct\npersonal or otherwise substantial involvement . . . in the circumstances underlying the\ncharge from sitting on the disciplinary body”). Therefore, we cannot say that the District\nCourt erred in dismissing Greer’s procedural due process arguments.\n        We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f",
