No. 01-CR-701-2)\n      District Judge: Honorable Joseph E.

In particular, he challenges his conviction for\n\nattempted murder of a federal agent and soliciting murder-for-hire on two related\n\ngrounds: first, he argues that the District Court erred in granting the Government’s motion\n\nin limine to preclude him from asserting a defense of duress to the attempted murder\n\ncharges; and second, he argues that the District Court erred in refusing to administer a\n\njury instruction on the defense of duress after he testified at trial that his cellmate\n\nassaulted him and threatened him with death and/or physical violence. Naovasaisri also\n\nchallenges his sentence under United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005). For the\n\nreasons stated below, we will affirm his conviction, but remand for resentencing in light\n\nof Booker.\n\n                                        I. Background\n\n       As we write solely for the parties, our recitation of the facts will be limited to those\n\nnecessary to our determination. On October 23, 2001, a team of FBI agents, headed by\n\nSpecial Agent Joseph Gilson, arrested Naovasaisri and his girlfriend in San Diego,\n\nCalifornia, in connection with an investigation of an international Thai sex-trafficking\n\norganization.1 Following Naovasaisri’s arrest, Special Agent Gilson interviewed and took\n\n\n       1\n        The organization recruited and smuggled impoverished Thai women into the\nUnited States to serve as prostitutes at brothels, massage parlors, and tanning salons,\nincluding some in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n                                               2\n\fa statement from him. On October 30, 2001, a federal grand jury sitting in Newark, New\n\nJersey returned a one-count Indictment charging Naovasaisri with conspiracy to transport\n\nThai aliens within the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), and\n\nconspiracy to transport Thai aliens in interstate and foreign commerce for prostitution in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421. Naovasaisri was eventually arraigned in New Jersey on\n\nDecember 28, 2001; Special Agent Gilson was present at the proceeding. Naovasaisri\n\nwas then detained in the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia (“FDC-Philadelphia”).\n\n       On January 6, 2002, Ronald Johnson, an FDC-Philadelphia detainee in a separate\n\ncase, sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey stating that\n\nhis cellmate, Naovasaisri, told him, inter alia, that he wanted Johnson to find him a\n\nhitman to kill the FBI agent assigned to his case. According to Johnson, Naovasaisri\n\ndescribed the FBI agent’s physical appearance and referred to him as “Joe.” Johnson met\n\nwith FBI and INS agents on January 25, 2002, and described to them Naovasaisri’s plot to\n\nhire someone to kill the FBI agent whose description matched that of Special Agent\n\nGilson. Johnson told them that Naovasaisri said that if Special Agent Gilson were killed,\n\nthe case against him would be dismissed and that he would pay for the murder once the\n\nmoney seized in the underlying case was returned to him. Johnson gave the agents a\n\nletter written by Naovasaisri stating that he needed Special Agent Gilson killed\n\nimmediately and discussing how he intended to pay for the murder.\n\n       On February 1, 2002, the FBI instructed Johnson that, if Naovasaisri approached\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fhim again to hire someone to kill Special Agent Gilson, he should say that his “Uncle\n\nMo” (in reality an undercover FBI agent) might be willing to do it. Later that week,\n\nNaovasaisri gaive Johnson a letter for him to give to his Uncle Mo discussing how\n\nNaovasaisri would pay for the murder and concluding, “If I not in jail I do [Special Agent\n\nGilson] my self but I in jail. I need you trus [sic] me.”\n\n       On February 8, 2002, Naovasaisri spoke by telephone from FDC-Philadelphia to\n\nan undercover FBI agent whom Johnson introduced as his Uncle Mo. Naovasaisri\n\ndiscussed hiring Uncle Mo to kill Special Agent Gilson, whom he referred to as “Bald\n\nEagle,” and how he would pay for the proposed murder. During the following months,\n\nNaovasaisri exchanged several letters with Uncle Mo through Johnson. Some were in\n\nThai—Johnson could not speak or write Thai but was instructed to tell Naovasaisri that\n\nUncle Mo had a friend who could read Thai—and others were in English. The focus of\n\nthe correspondence was how Naovasaisri could pay Uncle Mo for Special Agent Gilson’s\n\nmurder. Eventually, Naovasaisri offered his Infiniti automobile to Uncle Mo as a down\n\npayment.\n\n       On July 19, 2002, Johnson, at the FBI’s instructions, told Naovasaisri that Uncle\n\nMo was ready to murder Bald Eagle and wanted confirmation that the Infiniti would be\n\navailable to help him escape to Mexico after the murder. In a subsequent letter to Uncle\n\nMo, Naovasaisri wrote that he had told his sister to “give you my car I want you to do\n\nBald Eagle.” Naovasaisri gave Uncle Mo his sister’s home address and cellphone\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fnumber, and said that Bald Eagle’s last name was “gilnson or gilson.” 2\n\n       On August 1, 2002, Uncle Mo called Naovasaisri’s sister in California to discuss\n\npicking up the Infiniti from her. Naovasaisri’s sister claimed that she was waiting for a\n\ntelephone call from Naovasaisri before she would turn over the car. Shortly thereafter,\n\nthe sting operation ended, and Naovasaisri was moved to another cell and informed that\n\nhe faced charges of attempted murder and soliciting murder-for-hire. It was at that point\n\nthat Naovasaisri began suggesting that the plot to kill Special Agent Gilson was\n\nJohnson’s idea, and that Johnson had forced him to participate in it.\n\n       On April 23, 2003, a federal grand jury returned a five-count Superseding\n\nIndictment that charged Naovasaisri with the following crimes: transportation of aliens\n\nwithin the United States, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii); transportation of aliens\n\nin interstate commerce for prostitution, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2421; conspiracy to\n\ntransport aliens, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 371; attempt to kill a United States officer,\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1114; and use of mail to facilitate a murder, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1958.\n\n       Prior to trial, Naovasaisri gave notice that he intended to assert a duress defense to\n\nCounts Four and Five, the attempted murder charges. According to Naovasaisri, Johnson\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         However, in the only letter to Naovasaisri’s sister on this issue, Naovasaisri wrote\nthat if anyone came for the car, she should “simply insist that you don’t know anything\nabout it and let them contact me.” As the Government points out, this letter may have\nbeen written in August, after the sting operation concluded.\n\n                                              5\n\fforced him to write letters to, and engage in a telephone conversation with, Johnson’s\n\nUncle Mo, the undercover FBI Special Agent posing as a hitman. On December 1, 2003,\n\nthe Government filed a motion in limine to preclude Naovasaisri’s defense of duress.\n\nAfter conducting an evidentiary hearing on December 4, 2003, at which Naovasaisri\n\ndeclined to testify, the District Court granted the Government’s motion.\n\n       Naovasaisri’s jury trial commenced on December 4, 2003. On December 17,\n\n2003, the jury convicted Naovasaisri on all five counts contained in the Superseding\n\nIndictment. On December 23, 2003, Naovasaisri moved for a new trial, pursuant to Rule\n\n33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, arguing that the District Court erred in\n\nrefusing to permit the defense of duress at trial. The District Court denied the motion on\n\nJanuary 21, 2004. On May 21, 2004, after imposing a sentencing enhancement for\n\nobstruction of justice, the District Court sentenced Naovasaisri under mandatory\n\nSentencing Guidelines to 210 months’ imprisonment to be followed by three years of\n\nsupervised release. This appeal followed.\n\n                                        II. Discussion\n\n       Naovasaisri asserts three challenges to his conviction and sentence. First, he\n\nclaims that the District Court erred when it granted the Government’s motion in limine to\n\npreclude him from asserting a defense of duress to the attempted murder charges.\n\nSecond, he claims that the District Court erred when it refused to administer a jury\n\ninstruction on the defense of duress after he testified at trial that his cellmate assaulted\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fhim and threatened him with death and/or physical violence. Finally, he claims that he is\n\nentitled to resentencing under Booker. These arguments are addressed in turn.\n\n       A.      The Duress Defense\n\n       Naovasaisri argues that he was denied due process of law and a fair trial as\n\nguaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution when the District\n\nCourt granted the Government’s motion in limine to preclude the defense of duress at\n\ntrial. The Government contends that, under federal law, duress is never a defense to\n\ncrimes that require the intent to commit murder and, in the alternative, that Naovasaisri\n\nfailed to make out a prima facie case of duress sufficient to entitle him to present the issue\n\nto the jury.\n\n       Whether the defense of duress is available, as a matter of law, to a charge of\n\nattempted murder is a question of first impression in this circuit.3 However, we need not\n\nreach the question here because we agree with the District Court that, even if duress was a\n\ndefense available to Naovasaisri, he was not entitled to present the defense to the jury\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         As the Government points out, every Circuit to decide whether duress or coercion\nis a defense to crimes requiring the intent to commit murder has concluded that it is not.\nSee United States v. LaFleur, 971 F.2d 200, 206 (9th Cir. 1991) (holding that “consistent\nwith the common law rule, a defendant should not be excused from taking the life of an\ninnocent third person because of the threat of harm to himself”; “duress is not a valid\ndefense to § 1111(a) first degree murder”); United States v. Buchanan, 529 F.2d 1148,\n1153 (7th Cir. 1975) (holding that “coercion is not a defense to murder” under 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1114); R.I. Rec. Ctr., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 177 F.2d 603, 605 (1st Cir. 1949)\n(observing that it is “established” that “coercion or necessity will never excuse taking the\nlife of an innocent person”).\n\n                                              7\n\fbecause he failed to make out a prima facie case of duress.\n\n       Where “an affirmative defense consists of several elements and testimony\n\nsupporting one element is insufficient to sustain it even if believed, the trial court and jury\n\nneed not be burdened with testimony supporting other elements of the defense.” United\n\nStates v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 416 (1980). This rule applies where, as here, the issue is\n\nraised in a pretrial motion. See United States v. Miller, 59 F.3d 417, 421 n.1 (3d Cir.\n\n1995) (“A court may rule on a pretrial motion to preclude a defendant from presenting a\n\nduress defense where the government contends that the evidence in support of that\n\nposition would be legally insufficient.”).\n\n       To assert a defense of duress at trial, Naovasaisri was required to proffer evidence\n\nshowing: “(1) an immediate threat of death or serious bodily injury; (2) a well-grounded\n\nfear that the threat will be carried out; and (3) no reasonable opportunity to escape the\n\nthreatened harm.” Miller, 59 at 422 (quoting United States v. One 107.9 Acre Parcel of\n\nLand, 898 F.2d 396, 399 (3d Cir. 1990)). The Miller Court also recognized a fourth\n\nelement of duress: “that a defendant should not recklessly place h[im]self in a situation in\n\nwhich [he] would be forced to engage in criminal conduct.” Id. (citing United States v.\n\nPaolello, 951 F.2d 537, 541 (3d Cir. 1991)).\n\n       In view of the evidence presented at the pre-trial hearing and during the trial, we\n\nagree with the District Court’s conclusion that Naovasaisri failed to proffer evidence that\n\nhe had “no reasonable opportunity to escape the threatened harm.” Naovasaisri declined\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fto testify at the pre-trial hearing and he proffered only an unsworn statement that Johnson\n\nhad threatened his life and that he was afraid Johnson would carry out the threat. The\n\nGovernment, on the other hand, called a Bureau of Prisons official from FDC-\n\nPhiladelphia to testify about the opportunities Naovasaisri had to inform FDC-\n\nPhiladelphia staff of Johnson’s threats and seek protection from Johnson. At the\n\nconclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the District Court first ruled that duress is not a\n\ndefense to murder or attempted murder. The District Court also ruled, in the alternative,\n\nthat Naovasaisri failed to establish a prima facie case of duress. Specifically, the District\n\nCourt found that Naovasaisri had not presented evidence showing that there was “no\n\nreasonable opportunity to escape the threatened harm.” 4\n\n       Despite the District Court’s ruling on the Government’s motion in limine,\n\nNaovasaisri was permitted to testify at trial about Johnson’s alleged threats. However, on\n\ncross-examination, Naovasaisri conceded that he had numerous opportunities to report the\n\nthreats and seek protection from Johnson. For example, Naovasaisri testified that his cell\n\nwas equipped with a “duress button” that, if pressed, would have immediately summoned\n\nFDC-Philadelphia officials, and that a prison guard was stationed in his unit around the\n\nclock. He also testified that he met with or saw numerous individuals during the eight-\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         According to the District Court, “there are numerous opportunities to make\nknown to prison officials you’re having a problem, that you feel threatened. And it’s also\nclear that they will act and they will not take a risk; in other words, they won’t say, [‘]well\nthis is false, therefore go back to your cell.[’]”\n\n                                              9\n\fmonth period specified by the Superseding Indictment—he met with his attorney,\n\nrepresentatives of the Royal Thai Consulate, and FDC-Philadelphia counselors and\n\nmedical personnel. In addition, Naovasaisri wrote letters to his sister in Thai, which he\n\nknew Johnson did not understand, and spoke to her on the telephone on an almost daily\n\nbasis. Furthermore, Naovasaisri conceded that if he had told FDC-Philadelphia officials\n\nabout Johnson’s threats, he and Johnson would have been separated immediately and\n\nplaced into different cell blocs. Nonetheless, Naovasaisri never complained to anyone\n\nabout Johnson’s threats until after he was charged with attempting to hire someone to kill\n\nSpecial Agent Gilson. Nor did he present evidence that it would have been unreasonable\n\nfor him to report Johnson’s threats.5 For these reasons, we find that the District Court did\n\nnot err when it precluded Naovasaisri from presenting a defense of duress at trial because\n\nhe failed to establish a prima facie case of duress.6 See Miller, 59 F.3d at 422 (rejecting\n\n       5\n         Rather, he offered only speculation that he would have been harmed if he reported\nJohnson’s threats. Cf. United States v. Riffe, 28 F.3d 565, 568 (6th Cir. 1994) (ruling that\na duress defense was available where defendant “had a well-founded fear that going to\nprison officials might have placed him in more danger”). In Riffe, the defendant testified\nthat the basis for his belief that prison officials could not protect him if he refused to\nsmuggle marijuana into the prison for gang members was that he had been previously\nstabbed in the chest while “in protective segregation after giving up a name to prison\nofficials,” and a friend was murdered “after a similar incident in another institution.” Id.\n       6\n        Naovasaisri also argues that the District Court erred because it “seemingly\nadopted a per se ban on a duress defense in situations where the threatened individual is\nan inmate with the potential for informing prison officials of the sitautiton.” (NB at 18\n(citing Riffe, 28 F.3d 565.) On the contrary, the District Court did not adopt such a per se\nban; rather, it ruled, inter alia, that Naovasaisri had failed to proffer evidence that he\nlacked “a reasonable opportunity to go to law enforcement, . . . make known [his] fear\nand get protection.”\n\n                                             10\n\fduress defense where defendant failed to report threats despite having “ample opportunity\n\n. . . to communicate her claims of duress to law enforcement officials”); see also Bailey,\n\n444 U.S. at 410 (“[I]f there was a reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law ‘a\n\nchoice both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to avoid the threatened harm,’ the\n\ndefenses [of duress and necessity] will fail.”) (citation omitted).\n\n       B.     The Jury Charge\n\n       Naovasaisri next contends that the District Court’s refusal to instruct the jury on\n\nthe defense of duress denied him his fundamental constitutional rights to a fair trial and\n\ndue process of law. “As a general proposition a defendant is entitled to an instruction as\n\nto any recognized defense for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury\n\nto find in his favor.” Mathews v. United States, 485 U.S. 58, 63 (1988). Putting aside the\n\nquestion whether duress is a “recognized defense” to attempted murder, there was not\n\n“evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find” in Naovasaisri’s favor on a defense of\n\nduress, as discussed above. Accordingly, Naovasaisri was not entitled to a jury\n\ninstruction on the defense of duress.\n\n       Naovasaisri also suggests that the jury instruction given by the District Court\n\nserved to confuse the jury with respect to the issues of duress and coercion. After\n\npermitting Naovasaisri to testify about Johnson’s threats, the District Court instructed the\n\njury that, although duress was not a defense to the attempted murder charges, the jury\n\ncould “consider evidence of coercion or duress in deciding whether or not [Naovasaisri],\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fin fact, acted with the intent to have Mr. Gilson murdered.”\n\n       The District Court first provided counsel with a proposed charge on duress during\n\nNaovasaisri’s testimony. The District Court also advised counsel that they would have\n\ntwo chances to object to particular charges: during the charge conference and after the\n\ncharge was read to the jury. At the charge conference, Naovasaisri’s counsel stated that\n\nhe found “the charge to be fine in all respects, even including” the charge concerning\n\nduress. Similarly, after the District Court read the charge to the jury, Naovasaisri’s\n\ncounsel indicated that he had “no objections” to the charge. Thus, because Naovasaisri\n\ndid not object to the charge at trial, he must demonstrate plain error, see Untied States v.\n\nWest Indies Transport, Inc., 127 F.3d 299, 311 (3d Cir. 1997), which he has failed to do.\n\n       C.     Naovasaisri’s Sentence\n\n       By letter dated May 23, 2005, Naovasaisri requests a remand for resentencing\n\nunder United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005). Naovasaisri also argues that,\n\nbecause he committed his offense before the Supreme Court decided Booker, the ex post\n\nfacto principles inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prevent the\n\nre-imposition of a sentence that includes an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. In a\n\nreply letter dated July 25, 2005, the Government consents to Naovasaisri’s request for a\n\nremand and resentencing under Booker but urges this Court to follow the Fifth, Seventh,\n\nand Eleventh Circuits and reject Naovasaisri’s ex post facto argument. See United States\n\nv. Jamison, 416 F.3d 538 (7th Cir. 2005); United States v. Scroggins, 411 F.3d 572 (5th\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\fCir. 2005); United States v. Duncan, 400 F.3d 1297 (11th Cir. 2005).\n\n       Having determined that issues with respect to Booker are best determined by the\n\nDistrict Court in the first instance, we vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in\n\naccordance with that opinion.\n\n                                     III. Conclusion\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, we affirm Naovasaisri’s conviction, but vacate\n\nhis sentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n                                            13\n\f",

For the\n\nreasons stated below, we will affirm his conviction, but remand for resentencing in light\n\nof Booker.\n\n                                        I. Background\n\n       As we write solely for the parties, our recitation of the facts will be limited to those\n\nnecessary to our determination. On October 23, 2001, a team of FBI agents, headed by\n\nSpecial Agent Joseph Gilson, arrested Naovasaisri and his girlfriend in San Diego,\n\nCalifornia, in connection with an investigation of an international Thai sex-trafficking\n\norganization.1 Following Naovasaisri’s arrest, Special Agent Gilson interviewed and took\n\n\n       1\n        The organization recruited and smuggled impoverished Thai women into the\nUnited States to serve as prostitutes at brothels, massage parlors, and tanning salons,\nincluding some in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n                                               2\n\fa statement from him. On October 30, 2001, a federal grand jury sitting in Newark, New\n\nJersey returned a one-count Indictment charging Naovasaisri with conspiracy to transport\n\nThai aliens within the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), and\n\nconspiracy to transport Thai aliens in interstate and foreign commerce for prostitution in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 2421. Naovasaisri was eventually arraigned in New Jersey on\n\nDecember 28, 2001; Special Agent Gilson was present at the proceeding. Naovasaisri\n\nwas then detained in the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia (“FDC-Philadelphia”).\n\n       On January 6, 2002, Ronald Johnson, an FDC-Philadelphia detainee in a separate\n\ncase, sent a letter to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of New Jersey stating that\n\nhis cellmate, Naovasaisri, told him, inter alia, that he wanted Johnson to find him a\n\nhitman to kill the FBI agent assigned to his case. According to Johnson, Naovasaisri\n\ndescribed the FBI agent’s physical appearance and referred to him as “Joe.” Johnson met\n\nwith FBI and INS agents on January 25, 2002, and described to them Naovasaisri’s plot to\n\nhire someone to kill the FBI agent whose description matched that of Special Agent\n\nGilson. Johnson told them that Naovasaisri said that if Special Agent Gilson were killed,\n\nthe case against him would be dismissed and that he would pay for the murder once the\n\nmoney seized in the underlying case was returned to him. Johnson gave the agents a\n\nletter written by Naovasaisri stating that he needed Special Agent Gilson killed\n\nimmediately and discussing how he intended to pay for the murder.\n\n       On February 1, 2002, the FBI instructed Johnson that, if Naovasaisri approached\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fhim again to hire someone to kill Special Agent Gilson, he should say that his “Uncle\n\nMo” (in reality an undercover FBI agent) might be willing to do it. Later that week,\n\nNaovasaisri gaive Johnson a letter for him to give to his Uncle Mo discussing how\n\nNaovasaisri would pay for the murder and concluding, “If I not in jail I do [Special Agent\n\nGilson] my self but I in jail. I need you trus [sic] me.”\n\n       On February 8, 2002, Naovasaisri spoke by telephone from FDC-Philadelphia to\n\nan undercover FBI agent whom Johnson introduced as his Uncle Mo. Naovasaisri\n\ndiscussed hiring Uncle Mo to kill Special Agent Gilson, whom he referred to as “Bald\n\nEagle,” and how he would pay for the proposed murder. During the following months,\n\nNaovasaisri exchanged several letters with Uncle Mo through Johnson. Some were in\n\nThai—Johnson could not speak or write Thai but was instructed to tell Naovasaisri that\n\nUncle Mo had a friend who could read Thai—and others were in English. The focus of\n\nthe correspondence was how Naovasaisri could pay Uncle Mo for Special Agent Gilson’s\n\nmurder. Eventually, Naovasaisri offered his Infiniti automobile to Uncle Mo as a down\n\npayment.\n\n       On July 19, 2002, Johnson, at the FBI’s instructions, told Naovasaisri that Uncle\n\nMo was ready to murder Bald Eagle and wanted confirmation that the Infiniti would be\n\navailable to help him escape to Mexico after the murder. In a subsequent letter to Uncle\n\nMo, Naovasaisri wrote that he had told his sister to “give you my car I want you to do\n\nBald Eagle.” Naovasaisri gave Uncle Mo his sister’s home address and cellphone\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fnumber, and said that Bald Eagle’s last name was “gilnson or gilson.” 2\n\n       On August 1, 2002, Uncle Mo called Naovasaisri’s sister in California to discuss\n\npicking up the Infiniti from her. Naovasaisri’s sister claimed that she was waiting for a\n\ntelephone call from Naovasaisri before she would turn over the car. Shortly thereafter,\n\nthe sting operation ended, and Naovasaisri was moved to another cell and informed that\n\nhe faced charges of attempted murder and soliciting murder-for-hire. It was at that point\n\nthat Naovasaisri began suggesting that the plot to kill Special Agent Gilson was\n\nJohnson’s idea, and that Johnson had forced him to participate in it.\n\n       On April 23, 2003, a federal grand jury returned a five-count Superseding\n\nIndictment that charged Naovasaisri with the following crimes: transportation of aliens\n\nwithin the United States, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii); transportation of aliens\n\nin interstate commerce for prostitution, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2421; conspiracy to\n\ntransport aliens, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 371; attempt to kill a United States officer,\n\npursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1114; and use of mail to facilitate a murder, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1958.\n\n       Prior to trial, Naovasaisri gave notice that he intended to assert a duress defense to\n\nCounts Four and Five, the attempted murder charges. According to Naovasaisri, Johnson\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         However, in the only letter to Naovasaisri’s sister on this issue, Naovasaisri wrote\nthat if anyone came for the car, she should “simply insist that you don’t know anything\nabout it and let them contact me.” As the Government points out, this letter may have\nbeen written in August, after the sting operation concluded.\n\n                                              5\n\fforced him to write letters to, and engage in a telephone conversation with, Johnson’s\n\nUncle Mo, the undercover FBI Special Agent posing as a hitman. On December 1, 2003,\n\nthe Government filed a motion in limine to preclude Naovasaisri’s defense of duress.\n\nAfter conducting an evidentiary hearing on December 4, 2003, at which Naovasaisri\n\ndeclined to testify, the District Court granted the Government’s motion.\n\n       Naovasaisri’s jury trial commenced on December 4, 2003. On December 17,\n\n2003, the jury convicted Naovasaisri on all five counts contained in the Superseding\n\nIndictment. On December 23, 2003, Naovasaisri moved for a new trial, pursuant to Rule\n\n33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, arguing that the District Court erred in\n\nrefusing to permit the defense of duress at trial. The District Court denied the motion on\n\nJanuary 21, 2004. On May 21, 2004, after imposing a sentencing enhancement for\n\nobstruction of justice, the District Court sentenced Naovasaisri under mandatory\n\nSentencing Guidelines to 210 months’ imprisonment to be followed by three years of\n\nsupervised release. This appeal followed.\n\n                                        II. Discussion\n\n       Naovasaisri asserts three challenges to his conviction and sentence. First, he\n\nclaims that the District Court erred when it granted the Government’s motion in limine to\n\npreclude him from asserting a defense of duress to the attempted murder charges.\n\nSecond, he claims that the District Court erred when it refused to administer a jury\n\ninstruction on the defense of duress after he testified at trial that his cellmate assaulted\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fhim and threatened him with death and/or physical violence. Finally, he claims that he is\n\nentitled to resentencing under Booker. These arguments are addressed in turn.\n\n       A.      The Duress Defense\n\n       Naovasaisri argues that he was denied due process of law and a fair trial as\n\nguaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution when the District\n\nCourt granted the Government’s motion in limine to preclude the defense of duress at\n\ntrial. The Government contends that, under federal law, duress is never a defense to\n\ncrimes that require the intent to commit murder and, in the alternative, that Naovasaisri\n\nfailed to make out a prima facie case of duress sufficient to entitle him to present the issue\n\nto the jury.\n\n       Whether the defense of duress is available, as a matter of law, to a charge of\n\nattempted murder is a question of first impression in this circuit.3 However, we need not\n\nreach the question here because we agree with the District Court that, even if duress was a\n\ndefense available to Naovasaisri, he was not entitled to present the defense to the jury\n\n\n\n\n       3\n         As the Government points out, every Circuit to decide whether duress or coercion\nis a defense to crimes requiring the intent to commit murder has concluded that it is not.\nSee United States v.

This rule applies where, as here, the issue is\n\nraised in a pretrial motion. See United States v.

One 107.9 Acre Parcel of\n\nLand, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"538393\"><a href=\"/opinion/538393/united-states-v-one-1079-acre-parcel-of-land-located-in-warren-township/\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">396</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 (3d Cir. 1990)). The Miller Court also recognized a fourth\n\nelement of duress: “that a defendant should not recklessly place h[im]self in a situation in\n\nwhich [he] would be forced to engage in criminal conduct.” Id. (citing United States v.\n\nPaolello, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573891\"><a href=\"/opinion/573891/united-states-v-anthony-j-paolello-anthony-j-paolello/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541 (3d Cir. 1991)).\n\n       In view of the evidence presented at the pre-trial hearing and during the trial, we\n\nagree with the District Court’s conclusion that Naovasaisri failed to proffer evidence that\n\nhe had “no reasonable opportunity to escape the threatened harm.” Naovasaisri declined\n\n\n\n                                               8\n\fto testify at the pre-trial hearing and he proffered only an unsworn statement that Johnson\n\nhad threatened his life and that he was afraid Johnson would carry out the threat. The\n\nGovernment, on the other hand, called a Bureau of Prisons official from FDC-\n\nPhiladelphia to testify about the opportunities Naovasaisri had to inform FDC-\n\nPhiladelphia staff of Johnson’s threats and seek protection from Johnson. At the\n\nconclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the District Court first ruled that duress is not a\n\ndefense to murder or attempted murder. The District Court also ruled, in the alternative,\n\nthat Naovasaisri failed to establish a prima facie case of duress. Specifically, the District\n\nCourt found that Naovasaisri had not presented evidence showing that there was “no\n\nreasonable opportunity to escape the threatened harm.” 4\n\n       Despite the District Court’s ruling on the Government’s motion in limine,\n\nNaovasaisri was permitted to testify at trial about Johnson’s alleged threats. However, on\n\ncross-examination, Naovasaisri conceded that he had numerous opportunities to report the\n\nthreats and seek protection from Johnson. For example, Naovasaisri testified that his cell\n\nwas equipped with a “duress button” that, if pressed, would have immediately summoned\n\nFDC-Philadelphia officials, and that a prison guard was stationed in his unit around the\n\nclock. He also testified that he met with or saw numerous individuals during the eight-\n\n\n\n\n       4\n         According to the District Court, “there are numerous opportunities to make\nknown to prison officials you’re having a problem, that you feel threatened. And it’s also\nclear that they will act and they will not take a risk; in other words, they won’t say, [‘]well\nthis is false, therefore go back to your cell.[’]”\n\n                                              9\n\fmonth period specified by the Superseding Indictment—he met with his attorney,\n\nrepresentatives of the Royal Thai Consulate, and FDC-Philadelphia counselors and\n\nmedical personnel. In addition, Naovasaisri wrote letters to his sister in Thai, which he\n\nknew Johnson did not understand, and spoke to her on the telephone on an almost daily\n\nbasis. Furthermore, Naovasaisri conceded that if he had told FDC-Philadelphia officials\n\nabout Johnson’s threats, he and Johnson would have been separated immediately and\n\nplaced into different cell blocs. Nonetheless, Naovasaisri never complained to anyone\n\nabout Johnson’s threats until after he was charged with attempting to hire someone to kill\n\nSpecial Agent Gilson. Nor did he present evidence that it would have been unreasonable\n\nfor him to report Johnson’s threats.5 For these reasons, we find that the District Court did\n\nnot err when it precluded Naovasaisri from presenting a defense of duress at trial because\n\nhe failed to establish a prima facie case of duress.6 See Miller, 59 F.3d at 422 (rejecting\n\n       5\n         Rather, he offered only speculation that he would have been harmed if he reported\nJohnson’s threats. Cf. United States v. Riffe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673450\"><a href=\"/opinion/673450/united-states-v-leonard-p-riffe/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 568 (6th Cir. 1994) (ruling that\na duress defense was available where defendant “had a well-founded fear that going to\nprison officials might have placed him in more danger”). In Riffe, the defendant testified\nthat the basis for his belief that prison officials could not protect him if he refused to\nsmuggle marijuana into the prison for gang members was that he had been previously\nstabbed in the chest while “in protective segregation after giving up a name to prison\nofficials,” and a friend was murdered “after a similar incident in another institution.” Id.\n       6\n        Naovasaisri also argues that the District Court erred because it “seemingly\nadopted a per se ban on a duress defense in situations where the threatened individual is\nan inmate with the potential for informing prison officials of the sitautiton.” (NB at 18\n(citing Riffe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"673450\"><a href=\"/opinion/673450/united-states-v-leonard-p-riffe/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) On the contrary, the District Court did not adopt such a per se\nban; rather, it ruled, inter alia, that Naovasaisri had failed to proffer evidence that he\nlacked “a reasonable opportunity to go to law enforcement, . . . make known [his] fear\nand get protection.”\n\n                                             10\n\fduress defense where defendant failed to report threats despite having “ample opportunity\n\n. . . to communicate her claims of duress to law enforcement officials”); see also Bailey,\n\n444 U.S. at 410 (“[I]f there was a reasonable, legal alternative to violating the law ‘a\n\nchoice both to refuse to do the criminal act and also to avoid the threatened harm,’ the\n\ndefenses [of duress and necessity] will fail.”) (citation omitted).\n\n       B.     The Jury Charge\n\n       Naovasaisri next contends that the District Court’s refusal to instruct the jury on\n\nthe defense of duress denied him his fundamental constitutional rights to a fair trial and\n\ndue process of law. “As a general proposition a defendant is entitled to an instruction as\n\nto any recognized defense for which there exists evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury\n\nto find in his favor.” Mathews v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112012\"><a href=\"/opinion/112012/mathews-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">58</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (1988). Putting aside the\n\nquestion whether duress is a “recognized defense” to attempted murder, there was not\n\n“evidence sufficient for a reasonable jury to find” in Naovasaisri’s favor on a defense of\n\nduress, as discussed above. Accordingly, Naovasaisri was not entitled to a jury\n\ninstruction on the defense of duress.\n\n       Naovasaisri also suggests that the jury instruction given by the District Court\n\nserved to confuse the jury with respect to the issues of duress and coercion. After\n\npermitting Naovasaisri to testify about Johnson’s threats, the District Court instructed the\n\njury that, although duress was not a defense to the attempted murder charges, the jury\n\ncould “consider evidence of coercion or duress in deciding whether or not [Naovasaisri],\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\fin fact, acted with the intent to have Mr. Gilson murdered.”\n\n       The District Court first provided counsel with a proposed charge on duress during\n\nNaovasaisri’s testimony. The District Court also advised counsel that they would have\n\ntwo chances to object to particular charges: during the charge conference and after the\n\ncharge was read to the jury. At the charge conference, Naovasaisri’s counsel stated that\n\nhe found “the charge to be fine in all respects, even including” the charge concerning\n\nduress. Similarly, after the District Court read the charge to the jury, Naovasaisri’s\n\ncounsel indicated that he had “no objections” to the charge. Thus, because Naovasaisri\n\ndid not object to the charge at trial, he must demonstrate plain error, see Untied States v.\n\nWest Indies Transport, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"747168\"><a href=\"/opinion/747168/united-states-v-west-indies-transport-inc-at-no-96-7063-wit-equipment/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 311 (3d Cir. 1997), which he has failed to do.\n\n       C.     Naovasaisri’s Sentence\n\n       By letter dated May 23, 2005, Naovasaisri requests a remand for resentencing\n\nunder United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005). Naovasaisri also argues that,\n\nbecause he committed his offense before the Supreme Court decided Booker, the ex post\n\nfacto principles inherent in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prevent the\n\nre-imposition of a sentence that includes an obstruction-of-justice enhancement. In a\n\nreply letter dated July 25, 2005, the Government consents to Naovasaisri’s request for a\n\nremand and resentencing under Booker but urges this Court to follow the Fifth, Seventh,\n\nand Eleventh Circuits and reject Naovasaisri’s ex post facto argument.
