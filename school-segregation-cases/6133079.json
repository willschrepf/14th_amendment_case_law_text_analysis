Terrell appeals from his April 27, 2016 judgment entry of conviction,\n\nfollowing a jury trial on one count of trafficking in cocaine, a felony of the first degree, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), as set forth in count one of the indictment; possession of\n\f                                                                                          -2-\n\n\ncocaine, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), as set forth in count\n\ntwo of the indictment; and aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2925.11, as set forth in count three of the indictment. The indictment\n\nalso contained a forfeiture specification as to counts one through three.         The court\n\nmerged counts one and two and the State elected to proceed to disposition on count one.\n\nThe court sentenced Terrell to 11 years for trafficking in cocaine and one year for\n\naggravated possession of drugs, to be served consecutively.\n\n       {¶ 2} Terrell was indicted on May 26, 2015, and he filed a motion to suppress on\n\nAugust 6, 2015. The events surrounding Terrell’s arrest occurred at the Marriott Hotel in\n\nSpringfield, and in his motion to suppress, Terrell asserted that the arresting officers’\n\nencounter with him there was without reasonable, articulable suspicion, that Terrell’s\n\nconsent to the search of his person was involuntary, that the search warrant the officers\n\nobtained for Terrell’s hotel room was not supported by probable cause, and that Terrell\n\nhad an expectation of privacy in his hotel room. The motion was set for a hearing on\n\nAugust 21, 2015, and on August 11, 2015, Terrell moved for an extension of time. The\n\nhearing was rescheduled for October 2, 2015.\n\n       {¶ 3} On that date, William McMahan testified that he previously worked as a\n\ncontract security guard for Elite Investigation and Security Group, and that he was so\n\nemployed on March 31, April 1, 2015. He testified that he was assigned to the Marriott\n\nHotel in Springfield at the time, having worked there for approximately five months.\n\nMcMahan stated that he was assigned to the third shift, from 11:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m.\n\nHe stated that he was familiar with a typical evening at the hotel. The following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\f                                                                                       -3-\n\n\n             Q. * * * And going to the evening of March 31st and the morning of\n\n      April 1st, did you see something that led you to call the police department\n\n      that evening?\n\n             A. I did.\n\n             Q. Just tell us everything that was going on that led up to you\n\n      making the decision to call the police department that evening?\n\n             A. I noticed some activity in the parking lot, a couple of different\n\n      people showing up, and then they would meet with the person in the van,\n\n      leave, and then he would leave and come back a few minutes later, go up\n\n      to his room, come back down, and leave again, come back, go up. It\n\n      became repetitious.\n\n             It had happened one time prior before. I really didn’t pay that much\n\n      attention to it at that time. This time it became a little more apparent.\n\n             Q. And the time prior before, are you talking about a different day\n\n      altogether?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. And was that involving the same person?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. And was that person a guest in the hotel?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\nMcMahan identified Terrell as the person he observed.\n\n      {¶ 4} When asked if Terrell’s behavior was unusual for the parking lot of the hotel,\n\nMcMahan responded, “Absolutely.” He testified, “To me, it looked like a meet, maybe\n\f                                                                                          -4-\n\n\nthey were meeting up to either collect or supply with drugs, I’m assuming. The first time,\n\n* * * the same vehicle had showed up prior to him coming down from his room, and then\n\nthis time that vehicle had showed up, as well. So I just had to assume that there was\n\nsomething going on.” McMahan stated that it is not common for him to contact the police\n\nin the course of his shift, and that the “main reason that I called was the odor of marijuana\n\nwhen I walked by the van.”\n\n       {¶ 5} McMahan stated that the police arrived at the scene at approximately 2:30\n\na.m., and that he was in the parking lot at the time. The following exchange occurred:\n\n              Q. And at some point, are you there when the Defendant, Andre\n\n       Terrell, is out of his vehicle and next to a police vehicle and they’re talking\n\n       to him?\n\n              A. Yes. Actually, when the police arrived, I stayed in my vehicle\n\n       for, approximately, a minute just to make note of what time they,\n\n       approximately, showed up. And then I got out and went over and stood\n\n       closer to the police vehicle just to hear what was going on.\n\n              Q. * * * And what, did you observe the interaction between the officer\n\n       and the Defendant? Was the officer patting him down or what was going\n\n       on?\n\n              A. It was questioning while he was in the van at first, and then from\n\n       what I witnessed, it was the odor of what was coming out of the van that got\n\n       him out of the van.    Then it seemed to be the normal questions, do you\n\n       have anything on you?\n\n              Q. Did you hear the officer ask Mr. Terrell if he could search his\n\f                                                                                       -5-\n\n\n       person?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\n              Q. What was Mr. Terrell’s response?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\n              Q. Did you also, you knew that Mr. Terrell was a guest in the hotel;\n\n       is that correct?\n\n              A. I did.\n\n              Q. And did you provide the police with information about what [sic],\n\n       where he was staying at that time?\n\n              A. From what the front desk had told me, yes.\n\n       {¶ 6} When asked on cross-examination to describe Terrell’s comings and goings\n\non the night of his arrest, McMahan testified as follows:\n\n              Normally about, it seemed it was around midnight that he had come\n\n       down. There was a vehicle that pulled in to meet with him. It was a dark\n\n       blue Tahoe, I believe. I didn’t really get to see what was going on as far as\n\n       that goes, but when he did leave, he would leave for roughly 20 minutes\n\n       and then come back, go up to the room for five, ten minutes, come back\n\n       down, and leave, that was after that person had already left.\n\nMcMahan testified that he observed this sequence of events four times.          McMahan\n\nstated that smoking is not allowed in the hotel, and that it was common for him to observe\n\nguests smoking outside the hotel, as well as in their cars when it was cold outside.\n\n       {¶ 7} Officer Jared Osborne testified that he is employed by the Springfield Police\n\nDepartment, and that he conducts uniformed patrol, having been so employed for over\n\f                                                                                       -6-\n\n\nseven years. Osborne testified that he was dispatched to the Springfield Marriott on April\n\n1, 2015, at approximately 2:30 a.m. Osborne stated that there “was a drug complaint\n\ncalled in by staff at the Marriott that was relaying information for a security guard that\n\nworked there, including specific information about the identity of a vehicle that was\n\ninvolved.” The following exchange occurred:\n\n             Q. And tell me what happens when you arrive on scene.\n\n             A. I locate the vehicle that they had dispatched us out there to\n\n      check. It was a white Dodge Grand Caravan. When I got into the parking\n\n      lot, I immediately picked out the van. When I pulled up to it, I observed a\n\n      male getting out of the passenger seat. I went up to the male, identified\n\n      him as Aaron Minter, and as the door was opened, I could smell a very\n\n      strong odor of raw, burnt marijuana coming from the car, or from the van.\n\n      I just began asking Mr. Minter simple questions about what he was doing\n\n      there, how long they had been there, and he didn’t really want to answer a\n\n      whole lot.\n\n             But he, ultimately, told me that he was there to visit Mr. Terrell. He\n\n      was friends with him. The van is, kind of, tall. I had another officer that\n\n      was there who was speaking with Mr. Terrell on the other side of the van,\n\n      and I told him that I had smelled marijuana and was going to search the\n\n      van.\n\n             Upon searching the van, I found a bag with, it had a plastic container\n\n      in it, contained scissors, and some M&M packages containing small bags\n\n      of marijuana. At some point during this search, I heard over my portable\n\f                                                                                -7-\n\n\nradio that Officer McCarty had detained Mr. Terrell.\n\n       I wondered what was going on. I didn’t see this but I had stopped\n\nwhat I was doing, and he was placing Mr. Terrell in the back of the cruiser.\n\nAnd he had showed me what appeared to be, I initially thought it might be\n\nmethamphetamine or some type of designer drug that was inside a clear\n\nbaggy [sic] that he had got from Mr. Terrell’s right front pocket.\n\n       Q.   At that point in time, did Officer McCarty contact Detective\n\nMitchell on how to proceed from there?\n\n       A. Correct.\n\n       Q. And while he was doing that, did you speak briefly to Mr. Terrell?\n\n       A. I did.\n\n       Q. And what did you tell him?\n\n       A. I read Mr. Terrell his Miranda Rights. He nodded, stated that he\n\nunderstood. He initially told me that, I also heard him say that he was there\n\nin Room 615, and he had told me that he was there to visit a female that\n\nwas at the hotel.\n\n       When I started asking who the female was and how he gets ahold of\n\nher, he didn’t want to tell me, and I remember also asking him if we were\n\nable to get ahold of this female, would she give us consent to search the\n\nroom that she was in. And he said that he didn’t want to get her in trouble,\n\nand, at that point, he didn’t want to answer any more questions.\n\n       Q. * * * Did that all occur while he was in the back of the cruiser?\n\n       A. Correct.\n\f                                                                                        -8-\n\n\n              Q. Were you involved in the search of his person at all?\n\n              A. No.\n\n              Q. And Officer McCarty had the primary interaction with Mr. Terrell\n\n       at the scene up until that point?\n\n              A. Correct.\n\n       {¶ 8} Osborne testified that after Detective Mitchell responded to the hotel and\n\nspoke to the officers on the scene, Mitchell left to obtain a search warrant. The following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n              Q. Prior to that time, were you instructed to go secure Room 623 at\n\n       the hotel?\n\n              A.    I   was.    After   we   had   found   the   suspected    meth-\n\n       amphetamine/designer drug, after calling Detective Mitchell I went up to the\n\n       room, initially checked it for people. That’s it. Left the room and stayed\n\n       there until the search warrant was brought up.\n\n              Q. Did the hotel give you access to the room or did you have to force\n\n       entry by breaking the door?\n\n              A. No. They gave us a key card to the room to gain access.\n\n              Q. Was anybody in the room?\n\n              A. No.\n\n              Q. Did you search through any of the areas in the room or were you\n\n       just looking for people to make sure that nobody was able to destroy\n\n       anything?\n\n              A. I was just looking for people. I didn’t open anything or touch\n\f                                                                                      -9-\n\n\n      anything.\n\n      {¶ 9} On cross-examination, Osborne testified that Minter was exiting the front\n\npassenger seat of Terrell’s van as Osborne pulled up to the vehicle. Osborne stated that\n\nhe believed the vehicle was a rental. He stated that he did not ask permission to search\n\nthe van. At the time, he testified that McCarty was on the driver’s side of the van.\n\nOsborne stated that he could hear McCarty and Terrell talking on the other side of the\n\nvan, but he could not make out what they were saying. Osborne stated that he did not\n\nhear Terrell consent to a search of his person.\n\n      {¶ 10} According to Osborne, Terrell’s room was on the sixth floor. When asked\n\nwhy he proceeded to the room, Osborne responded, “To, basically do a sweep of the\n\nroom to make sure that there was nobody inside of it and exit the room. After that, just\n\nstayed there so nobody could gain access to the room while they were in the process of\n\nobtaining the search warrant.” The following exchange occurred:\n\n             Q. Did you have any reason to believe there were other people in\n\n      the room?\n\n             A. I didn’t know, and that’s why I done that.\n\n             Q. But nobody had ever said that there were other people in the\n\n      room; is that correct?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             Q. And were you, did you have any reason to believe that any\n\n      crimes were being committed in the room at that point?\n\n             A. There was, I believe, personally believe that there was some\n\n      type of drug activity going on in there because the Caravan smelled like\n\f                                                                               -10-\n\n\nmarijuana. Mr. Terrell and Mr. Minter are both career criminals for being\n\ndrug dealers. There was a security guard telling us that he thought there\n\nwas drug activity going on between the two of them with contraband. I\n\nbelieved that there was some type of trafficking going on inside the room.\n\n       Q. * * * And the specific room, could you smell marijuana emitting\n\nfrom the hotel room?\n\n       A. No. I couldn’t smell marijuana coming from the room.\n\n***\n\n       Q. And why did you, I guess, classify Mr. Minter and Mr. Terrell as\n\ncareer criminals. How do you qualify that?\n\n       A. That’s just something that we identify certain people with in our\n\ndepartment with their prior activity.\n\n       Q. * * * And when you say prior activity, what do you mean\n\nspecifically?\n\n       A. If he’s been arrested for possession, dealing drugs before.   It’s\n\njust something that our dispatcher would notify us of when we were, if we\n\nwere to go out and run somebody’s name and check them for warrant.\n\n       Q. What did you hear from outside of Mr. Terrell’s room, Room\n\n623? Could you hear any noises coming from inside the room?\n\n       A. No.\n\n       Q. So you had no reason to believe somebody inside was in need\n\nof assistance or anything like that; is that correct?\n\n       A. That’s correct.\n\f                                                                                      -11-\n\n\n              Q. Did you suspect that there were armed individuals in the room\n\n       for any reason?\n\n              A. No.\n\n              Q. So I guess to go back to your previous testimony, your intention\n\n       was to go in the room and do what?\n\n              A. Just make sure there was nobody inside of the room to destroy\n\n       anything that would be inside.\n\n              ***\n\n              Q. * * * And how long were you in Room 623 at this point?\n\n              A. I would say I was in there less than 10 seconds.\n\n              Q. And how much prior in time to the search warrant coming did\n\n       you enter Mr. Terrell’s room?\n\n              A. It was a couple hours. I don’t recall exactly how long it was.\n\n       {¶ 11} Detective Gerald Mitchell testified that he is assigned to the intelligence\n\nunit, which is commonly referred to as the drug unit, in the Springfield Police Division,\n\nhaving been so employed for over three years. He testified that on April1, 2015, at about\n\n3:00 a.m., he received a phone call from McCarty about suspected drug activity at the\n\nSpringfield Marriott.    He stated that he learned that the officers had recovered “a\n\nsubstance that they believed was meth, as well as some marijuana.”         According to\n\nMitchell, there “had been some disagreement between, or difference between what room\n\n[Terrell] said he was in and what room the hotel said he was actually in, and I asked\n\nOfficer McCarty to inform Mr. Terrell of his rights and ask him, again, what room he was\n\nin and if he would give consent to search that room.” Mitchell testified that he then\n\f                                                                                       -12-\n\n\nreceived a return call from McCarty advising him that “Officer Osborne had informed and\n\nasked [Terrell] what room he was in. Ultimately, he said he was not a guest at the hotel,\n\nthat he was meeting a female in Room 615.”\n\n      {¶ 12} Mitchell stated that he later responded to the hotel, and the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n             Q. * * * What did you do when you got on scene?\n\n             A. First thing I did was I spoke with Officer McCarty, took some\n\n      photographs of the evidence that he had collected, and, at that point, I\n\n      believe I searched the van. My primary goal was to find the hotel key, hotel\n\n      key for 623.\n\n             Q. So you had been informed that there was a room key at some\n\n      point and you were looking to see if you could find it in the van?\n\n             A. Yes. Officer McCarty advised that upon initial contact with Mr.\n\n      Terrell, Mr. Terrell showed him a room key that said Marriott on it, and after\n\n      he had arrested him, he could not find that same key.\n\n             Q. Did he also show you the items that were found in Mr. Terrell’s\n\n      pockets?\n\n             A. He did.\n\n             Q. Describe those items for me.\n\n             A.      There was a crystalline substance, and there was some\n\n      marijuana. I don’t recall whether that was from his pockets or from the\n\n      vehicle. There was a notepad or notebook with what appeared to be dollar\n\n      amounts written on it and some names.\n\f                                                                                        -13-\n\n\n             Q. And did you attempt to conduct what is commonly called a field\n\n      test on the crystalline substance?\n\n             A. I did.\n\n             Q. And what were the results of that?\n\n             A. The results indicated the presence of either amphetamines or\n\n      analogues of MDMA.\n\n             Q. And the notebook that was in his pocket, was one of the names\n\n      written on there Ills, I-L-L-S?\n\n             A. I don’t recall how it was spelled, but it was Ills, yes.\n\n             Q. Do you know a person who goes by the name of ILLS in the city\n\n      of Springfield?\n\n             A. I do.\n\n             Q. And who is that?\n\n             A. Aaron Minter.\n\n      {¶ 13} Mitchell stated that he was aware that Terrell had been advised of his rights,\n\nand that he spoke to Terrell in the back of the cruiser and asked if he would consent to a\n\nsearch of his room. According to Mitchell, Terrell advised him that he wanted to speak\n\nto his attorney. He testified that Terrell did not appear to be intoxicated. The following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n             Q. You then sought to get a search warrant for hotel room 623,\n\n      correct?\n\n             A. Right.\n\n             Q. And prior to that, knowing that you were intending to do so, about\n\f                                                                                        -14-\n\n\n      how long would that have taken or how long did it take to get the search\n\n      warrant from that time until it was actually signed? * * *\n\n             A. I remember getting to the hotel around 4:00 a.m. I believe we\n\n      executed the search warrant after 9:00 a.m., so we would have had the\n\n      search warrant signed sometime between 8:00 and 9:00 after a judge would\n\n      have arrived at work.\n\n             Q. And because of that long period of time, were you interested in\n\n      securing the hotel room?\n\n               ***\n\n               A. Yes.\n\n             Q. And did you enter the room and secure it so that nothing could\n\n      leave before the search warrant was obtained?\n\n               A. I did not. Sergeant Bennett did.\n\n             Q. But you were aware that that had taken place?\n\n             A. I was aware, yes.\n\nOn cross-examination, Mitchell stated that he did not find a room key in the van in the\n\ncourse of his search.\n\n      {¶ 14} Officer Tyler McCarty testified that he has been a police officer with the\n\nCity of Springfield for over six years. He stated that on April 1, 2015, he was dispatched\n\nto the Springfield Marriott, and that the “call was there was a white van parked on the lot\n\nwith two occupants. They looked suspicious. They kept going in and out of the hotel to\n\nthe van, and the caller thought it might have been drug activity.” The following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\f                                                                                 -15-\n\n\n       Q. * * * Tell us what happens when you arrive on scene. What do\n\nyou see?\n\n       A. I pulled in right after my partner, Officer Osborne. He was the\n\nfirst one to pull up to the van, located him right away. As I was pulling up\n\nbehind him, I saw a driver getting out, and there was a passenger getting\n\nout on the passenger front side.\n\n       Officer Osborne went up to the passenger side. I went up to the\n\ndriver’s side. As I was coming up to the driver’s side, I made contact with\n\nMr. Terrell. He already had his door shut, and I just started talking to him.\n\n       ***\n\n       Q. Do you recall your conversation?\n\n       A. As soon as I started walking up to Mr. Terrell and talking to him,\n\nhe told me that he was [a] guest at the hotel. He told me he was staying\n\nthere. There was a security guard for the hotel sitting in his car in the lot,\n\nand he started pointing to the security guard saying, he knows I’m staying\n\nhere. He’s seen me in and out the past few days.\n\n       Q. Did he show you a room key of some kind, as well?\n\n       A. He did.\n\n       Q. And do you recall what room he told you he was staying in?\n\n       A. I believe he said 615.\n\n       Q. And around that time, did Officer Osborne inform you he was\n\ngoing to search the vehicle?\n\n       A.    Yes.   Officer Osborne told me he could smell the odor of\n\f                                                                                         -16-\n\n\n       marijuana coming from the vehicle and that he was going to search it.\n\n              Q. And what did you do with Mr. Terrell at that time?\n\n              A.   I asked Mr. Terrell if I could check to make sure if he had\n\n       anything on him, any weapons, or drugs or anything of that nature. He said\n\n       he didn’t. I asked if he minded if I searched him. He said he didn’t. I\n\n       asked Mr. Terrell if he actually minded if I checked inside his pockets. He\n\n       said he did not. And the security guard was standing next to me the whole\n\n       time that went on.\n\n              Q. And was Mr. Terrell in handcuffs at that point in time?\n\n              A. No, sir.\n\n              Q. And then you checked his pockets after he gave you permission\n\n       to do so?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\n              Q. Did you find anything inside?\n\n              A. I found a small M&Ms bottle with a small plastic baggy [sic] of\n\n       marijuana, and then the smaller right pocket I found a bag of a rocklike\n\n       substance that we were not sure what it was at that time.\n\nMcCarty stated that Terrell did not make any statements about the substance, and that\n\nMcCarty did not ask any questions about it.\n\n       {¶ 15} McCarty stated that the “security guard had came back out after going\n\ninside and checking the rooms, and he told us that, I think it was Room 623 that Mr. Terrell\n\nwas actually staying in.” The following exchange occurred regarding the search of Room\n\n623:\n\f                                                                                    -17-\n\n\n             Q. And at some point did you actually enter the room to make sure\n\n      nobody was inside?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. How did that actually happen? * * *\n\n             A. We were told just to secure the room. If we heard anybody in\n\n      there or thought anybody was in there, you know, just briefly walk through\n\n      and check for people, not anything else. We stood out of the room for\n\n      about a minute, a couple of minutes or so, approximately.\n\n             And we could hear what we thought was people talking inside so we\n\n      knocked on the door several times and asked people to come out. Nobody\n\n      was answering, nobody was responding, then we entered the room, briefly\n\n      walked through to make sure there was no people in there, and it was\n\n      actually, the TV was on and the volume was down kind of low.\n\n             Q. And did you leave the room and wait until a search warrant had\n\n      actually been obtained before any further searching occurred?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n      {¶ 16} On cross-examination, McCarty was shown a copy of an “inner office”\n\ncompleted by him on April 1, 2015, and he was given an opportunity to read it over. The\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n             Q. * * * So in the report, what did you say Mr. Terrell, what his\n\n      response was to whether or not you could search him?\n\n             A. I then asked Mr. Terrell if he had anything illegal on his person\n\n      and he replied that he did not. I asked Mr. Terrell if I could check his\n\f                                                                                      -18-\n\n\n      pockets, and he stated that he did not care. I then asked Mr. Terrell if I\n\n      could reach into his pockets to check them, and, again, he replied that he\n\n      did not care.\n\n               Q. Did you take, I don’t care, as an affirmative response that you\n\n      could?\n\n               A. Yes.\n\n               Q. Officer, was this a weapons pat down?\n\n               A. Just was pat down for anything illegal. So I asked if I could\n\n      search him before I even patted him down or looked into his pockets.\n\n               Q. So this was a search for illegal contraband?\n\n               A. Yes.\n\n               Q. And what was the cause for this search for illegal contraband\n\n      again?\n\n               A. Officer Osborne smelling marijuana coming from the vehicle.\n\nMcCarty stated that Terrell was not under arrest at the time of the pat down, but that he\n\nwas being detained based upon the odor of marijuana from the van.\n\n      {¶ 17} The following exchange occurred regarding Room 623:\n\n               Q. And you rode up the elevator how many floors?\n\n               A. Six.\n\n               Q. And did you believe that, and what was the intent of going into\n\n      the room at that point?\n\n               A. Just to secure it.\n\n               Q. And, well, secure it from what?\n\f                                                                                 -19-\n\n\n         A. Make sure there was nobody in there that could destroy any\n\npossible evidence before we could search it.\n\n         Q. And did you have any reason to believe there was anyone in\n\nthere?\n\n         A. Yes.\n\n         Q. And what was that?\n\n         A. Mr. Terrell said, at some point, he was with some female in the\n\nroom.\n\n         ***\n\n         Q. How long were you in the room?\n\n         A. Maybe a minute or less.\n\n         ***\n\n         Q. And what did you do when you entered the room? Can you just\n\nwalk us through that?\n\n         A.    I entered the room, I believe, to the right.    There was a\n\nbathroom. You just kept going, and there was a couple beds and then it\n\ndead-ended into the wall. So just walk straight and looked in between the\n\nbeds and the bed and wall, came back out, and I believe somebody just\n\nwalked in the bathroom and checked in the shower to make sure nobody\n\nwas in there and we left.\n\n         Q. * * * And how many people were in the room with you at this point?\n\n         A. I can’t remember.\n\n         ***\n\f                                                                                      -20-\n\n\n             Q.   Did you notice anybody opening drawers or looking in any\n\n      cabinets or - -\n\n             A. No.\n\n             Q. * * * If you were searching for people, did you knock on the door\n\n      prior to entering the room?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. Did you receive any response from inside?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             Q. Why did you, at that point, not, I guess, just stand guard at the\n\n      door? Why did you feel the need to enter the room?\n\n             A. Because we could hear voices inside, very faint voices, so we\n\n      thought maybe somebody was inside.\n\n             Q. And those voices were emitting from the television set; is that\n\n      correct?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. So when you opened the door and saw that the television set\n\n      was on, I guess why, at that point, did you feel it necessary to continue to\n\n      search the room?\n\n             A. Because we were making sure that that was the only thing they\n\n      were coming from was the TV.\n\n      {¶ 18} On recross-examination, the following exchange occurred regarding the pat\n\ndown search of Terrell: “Q. * * * After testimony and you reading your report again, did\n\nMr. Terrell at any point give an affirmative yes to the question whether or not you could\n\f                                                                                         -21-\n\n\nsearch him? A. No. He didn’t give an affirmative no either.”\n\n       {¶ 19} At the conclusion of the hearing, the following exchange occurred:\n\n              MR. PICEK: The State would have no further witnesses. We would\n\n       have the search warrant, which has been marked as State’s Exhibit No.1.\n\n       Your Honor signed that search warrant. At least, my understanding is, at\n\n       least, that portion of the motion to suppress should go to another judge to\n\n       rule on.\n\n              They’re [sic] challenged to whether the search warrant should have\n\n       been issued. * * *\n\n              THE COURT: * * *With respect to the search warrant, whether or\n\n       not that should have been issued, certainly I’ll recuse myself from that\n\n       portion of the motion and refer that to the administrative judge who will most\n\n       likely assign that to Judge O’Neill to review. * * *.”\n\n       {¶ 20} On October 5, 2015, the trial court issued an Entry that provides, “* * * the\n\nCourt finds that a portion of the subject of the defendant’s motion is a search warrant that\n\nthis judge signed. THEREFORE, this case is TRANSFERRED to the Administrative\n\nJudge * * * to assign to another judge for the limited purpose of hearing the portion of\n\ndefendant’s motion to suppress that deals with the search warrant. * * * .”\n\n       {¶ 21} On October 13, 2015, the “State of Ohio’s Closing Argument for\n\nSuppression Hearing” was filed. The State asserted that the arresting officers had a\n\nreasonable suspicion to detain Terrell, that he consented to a search of his person, and\n\nthat the search of his vehicle was supported by probable cause. On October 16, 2015,\n\nTerrell filed “Defendant’s Brief in Support of Suppression.” On October 27, 2015, the\n\f                                                                                        -22-\n\n\ncourt issued an Entry that provides that “Defendant’s motion to suppress is OVERRULED\n\nfor the reasons set forth in State’s written closing argument.” Terrell filed a Notice of\n\nAppeal of the trial court’s decision, which this Court dismissed on the State’s motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of a final appealable order.\n\n       {¶ 22} On November 9, 2015, a hearing was held on the remaining portion of\n\nTerrell’s motion to suppress before the newly assigned judge. The following exchange\n\noccurred at the start of the hearing:\n\n              MR. PICEK: A hearing was held before Judge Rastatter, regarding\n\n       the parts of the motion that do not deal with the search warrant. Mainly,\n\n       regarding an encounter with the Defendant and law enforcement that was\n\n       in the parking lot of a hotel and the search of his person, at that time. That\n\n       has been ruled on in the State’s favor. The only issues remaining were the\n\n       Defendant’s motion to suppress are what, I believe, [sic] are under\n\n       subsections F and G, regarding the search warrant.         It’s beginning on\n\n       page, 13, I believe, of the Defendant’s motion.\n\n              THE COURT: Section F says, the search warrant that was created\n\n       by Detective Mitchell was defective. And G says that the Defendant has\n\n       an expectation of privacy at the hotel room and that the search of the hotel\n\n       room was unconstitutional. Those are the two parts of the motion to be\n\n       presented, the argument before the court today.\n\n       {¶ 23} A copy of the search warrant for room 623 at the Marriott was marked as\n\nan exhibit, along with an accompanying affidavit. The State indicated that, “[r]egarding\n\nwhether the Defendant has [an] expectation of privacy in his hotel room, this room was\n\f                                                                                          -23-\n\n\nchecked out under his name and it is, obviously, the State’s position that it is his room,\n\nso we’d agree. But, they had a search warrant.” The State noted that the “remainder\n\nof the challenge of the search warrant is solely regarding whether there was sufficient\n\nprobable cause.”\n\n       {¶ 24} After a discussion off the record, the court indicated its understanding that\n\nthe parties agreed to submit the matter to it based upon the exhibit and the written\n\narguments already submitted. The State indicated that this “is a review of whether or not\n\nthe issuing Magistrate had substantial basis on which to find probable cause. I don’t see\n\nany need to argue any further. The State believes that there is more than sufficient\n\nevidence contained in the affidavit for the Court to find probable cause.”\n\n       {¶ 25} The April 1, 2015 affidavit of Detective Gerrald Mitchell provides as follows:\n\n              * * * Detective Gerrald Mitchell, Jr. of the Springfield Police Division,\n\n       who being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says that on the 1st of\n\n       April, 2015, Hotel Room 623 at the Courtyard by Marriott located as 100 S.\n\n       Fountain Ave., Springfield, Clark County, Ohio, does contain certain\n\n       evidence of criminal acts, to wit: Heroin, cocaine, marihuana, controlled\n\n       substance analogs, drug paraphernalia, items used to transport, package,\n\n       or prepare drugs for sale, money, financial records of drug trafficking\n\n       activity, items showing an ownership or possessory interest in the residence\n\n       and any items located therein, instrumentalities and proceeds of drug\n\n       trafficking, firearms, cellular telephones (contact lists, text messages, call\n\n       history, photographs, videos, application data, location data, and other\n\n       documents and data) and any other evidence of trafficking or possession of\n\f                                                                                  -24-\n\n\ndrugs in violation of sections 2925.03 and 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised\n\nCode and Affiant further says that he believes, and has good cause to\n\nbelieve, that such things are concealed at the above described location.\n\n         The facts upon which Affiant bases said belief are:\n\n         1. Affiant, Detective Gerrald Mitchell Jr., is employed by the City of\n\nSpringfield Police Division and has been so since January of 2007. I have\n\nbeen assigned to the Springfield Police Intelligence Unit from May 2012 to\n\nthe present date. I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Criminal Justice\n\nLeadership from Urbana University.        I have successfully completed the\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration’s Basic Narcotics Investigator course. I\n\nhave also received training to forensically extract data from mobile devices.\n\nMy certifications include Cellebrite Certified Logical Operator and Cellebrite\n\nCertified Physical Analyst.\n\n         2.   The Springfield Police Division has been investigating Andre\n\nTerrell (DOB 7/17/1978; * * *) for trafficking in drugs over the past several\n\nyears.\n\n         3. In 1998, Terrell was sentenced to 3 years in prison in Clark\n\nCounty Case 98-CR-0477 for possession of drugs (crack). In 2003, he was\n\nconvicted of possession of cocaine and sentenced to 3 years community\n\ncontrol.      In 2004, he was convicted of trafficking in drugs and again\n\nsentenced to 2 years of community control.\n\n         4. In July 2014, Sgt. Bennett and I met with a confidential source\n\n(CS #1261). CS # 1261 has provided information in the past about drug\n\f                                                                                 -25-\n\n\ntraffickers which has led to the issuance of a search warrant, seizure of\n\nsignificant amounts of illegal drugs, and convictions. CS #1261 stated that\n\nTerrell was still currently selling illegal drugs in the Springfield area,\n\nincluding cocaine, and provided a current phone number for Terrell.\n\n       5. I also spoke to a confidential source (CS #1251). CS #1251 in\n\nthe past has provided information that Terrell sells cocaine and heroin.\n\n       6. Within the past month, CS #1251 told me that Terrell was still\n\ncurrently selling heroin.\n\n       7. In February 2015, I contacted CS #1261 and CS #1251 to ask\n\nfor any current phone numbers for Terrell. CS #1251 provided the same\n\nphone number CS #1261 had previously provided in July of 2014, as well\n\nas a second, new number. CS #1261 provided me with the same second,\n\nnewer number as CS #1251.\n\n       8.    On April 1, 2015 at approximately 2:30 AM, Officers Tyler\n\nMcCarty and Jerod Osborne of the Springfield Police Division were\n\ndispatched to the Marriott Hotel at 100 S. Fountain Ave., Springfield, Clark\n\nCounty, Ohio, on report of two men in a white van in the parking lot, one of\n\nwhom had been recently staying in the hotel, and he was seen regularly\n\ngoing from the hotel back out to the car. The caller also stated that they\n\nbelieved there to be drug activity going on based on what they were\n\nobserving.\n\n       9. Officers arrived on scene shortly after being dispatched and\n\napproached a White Dodge Minivan with Illinois Plate P42-1003.             The\n\f                                                                                 -26-\n\n\npassenger, later identified as Aaron Minter, was getting out of the vehicle\n\nas Officer Osborne arrived.      Officer Osborne quickly approached the\n\nvehicle and noticed the odor of raw and burnt marijuana. Officer McCarty\n\nthen arrived as the driver, later identified as Andre Terrell was exiting the\n\nvehicle and shut the driver’s door. Terrell immediately stated that he was\n\na guest at the hotel, and pointed to a security guard, stating, “He’s seen me\n\nhere for the past few nights he can tell you.”\n\n       10. Officer McCarty asked Terrell if he had a key, which Terrell\n\nshowed to him. The key said “Marriott” on it. He then handed the key\n\nback to Terrell. Officer McCarty asked which room Terrell was in and he\n\nstated “615.” Officer Osborne indicated that he was going to search the\n\nvehicle based upon the plain smell of marijuana giving probable cause to\n\nsearch the vehicle.    Officer McCarty asked Terrell if he could check if\n\nTerrell had anything illegal on him, he said he did not care. Officer McCarty\n\nasked if he could actually go into Terrell’s pockets, again he said he did not\n\ncare. Officer McCarty located in his left pants pocket a cylindrical shaped\n\nM&Ms container which contained a small bag of marijuana. In his right\n\nwatch pocket he found a plastic bag containing what he thought may be\n\nmethamphetamine. Terrell was placed into handcuffs at that time. Officer\n\nMcCarty also located a notebook in his pocket, discussed below, which\n\ncontained a ledger.      Terrell was also in possession of two cellular\n\ntelephones.\n\n       11. Later, the suspected methamphetamine was field tested, and\n\f                                                                              -27-\n\n\nthe field test indicated the presence of either amphetamine or analogs of\n\nMDM (ecstasy).\n\n      12.    Inside the vehicle, Officer Osborne located another box\n\ncontaining additional M&Ms containers with marijuana inside. At that time,\n\nMinter was also placed in handcuffs and placed in a police vehicle. Officer\n\nMcCarty made contact with hotel staff and was advised that Terrell was\n\nactually staying in Room 623, and the room was currently booked in his\n\nname. Officer McCarty contacted me at that time for advice on how to\n\nproceed.\n\n      13. Officers then returned to speak to Terrell and Officer Osborne\n\nadvised him of his rights. Terrell was again asked what room he was in,\n\nand he again said 615. Officer Osborne then asked for consent to search\n\nthe room, and Terrell then said that he was actually not staying there, but\n\nwas supposed to meet some girl who has a room there, but she hadn’t\n\nshown up yet. When asked, Terrell stated he did not know the female’s\n\nname, or how to get ahold of her. He then stated he did not have a room at\n\nthe hotel, but that he previously was staying in Room 615.\n\n      14. The hotel provided me with copies of the invoices for Terrell’s\n\ncurrent and recent stays at the hotel. The records showed that Terrell\n\nstayed at the Courtyard by Marriott, 100 S. Fountain Ave., checking in at\n\n8:12 PM on March 25, and checking out at 1:20 PM on March 26, staying\n\nin Room 615. He then checked in again on March 31, 2015 at 10:32 PM,\n\nthis time staying in Room 623.\n\f                                                                                    -28-\n\n\n       15. I arrived on scene at approximately 4:00 AM. Officers showed\n\nme what they had found on Terrell’s person and I conducted the above\n\nmentioned field test. I located in Terrell’s wallet a key card for a Marriott\n\nhotel; however, hotel staff indicated that the key was not for the hotel at 100\n\nS. Fountain Ave. Officer McCarty also indicated that the key I found in the\n\nwallet was not the key that Terrell had shown him earlier. I also located in\n\nTerrell’s belongings the ledger that Officer McCarty had located in Terrell’s\n\npocket, with listed names of known drug traffickers in Springfield, with\n\ndifferent numbers, presumably dollar amounts listed next to their names,\n\nand with several lines crossed out, and the same name appearing multiple\n\ntimes. A photograph of a page of the ledger is attached hereto as Exhibit\n\nA. Of note are the lines reading “Juve 1000,” multiple lines with the name\n\n“Ills,” “Tylic – 290,” “Dew 1500”, “Sam”. “Juve” is a known nickname for\n\nJerrell Fleming, who is known to me to be a drug trafficker in Springfield.\n\n“Ills” is a known nickname for Aaron Minter, the passenger in the vehicle\n\nwith Terrell. “Tylic” is likely to be Tilic Beal, also a known drug trafficker in\n\nSpringfield. The numbers likely indicate dollar amounts possibly owed to\n\nTerrell for various types and amounts of illegal drugs.\n\n       16.   I then searched the van in which Terrell and Minter were\n\nlocated. My goal was to located [sic] the room key that Terrell had shown\n\nOfficer McCarty. I located some empty plastic bags in different places\n\ninside the van. I also located a box of freezer bags sitting on top of one of\n\nthe seats in the rear of the van. Under the dashboard area, I saw three\n\f                                                                                   -29-\n\n\ncoffee cups wrapped in plastic like the kind commonly found in hotel rooms.\n\nIn the far rear storage area of the van, there were multiple plastic grocery\n\nbags, and approximately 12-15 tennis balls. Most [of] the tennis balls had\n\nholes cut into the hollow interior, and at least one was cut further open. I\n\nopened up the tennis balls and found nothing inside them.             I located\n\nnothing else inside the van that could explain why the tennis balls were\n\npresent; however, I do believe that they could be a unique method of\n\ncovertly transporting illegal drugs. I did not locate the Marriott key card that\n\nTerrell showed Officer McCarty. The key card was not found on Terrell’s\n\nperson or in his belongings.\n\n       17. The security guard at the hotel provided further information.\n\nHe stated that the “large male,” referring to Aaron Minter, had arrived in the\n\nvehicle which was currently parked next to the van. That vehicle is\n\nregistered to another person with the last name Minter. He stated that on\n\nMarch 25, the same evening as Terrell’s previous stay at the hotel, he\n\nobserved suspicious behavior by Terrell in the parking lot of the hotel. He\n\nobserved Terrell meet with a Blue Tahoe in the parking lot, and Terrell and\n\nthe Blue Tahoe would repeatedly leave and return after about 20-30\n\nminutes, go up to the room, and also would sit in the vehicles in the parking\n\nlot for periods of time. Due to his suspicions, the security guard drove\n\nthrough the parking lot a few times, upon which Terrell approached him on\n\nfoot and said “So you know I’m a guest here, in case you were going to call\n\nthe cops.”\n\f                                                                                  -30-\n\n\n       18. The security guard described similar behavior on the night of\n\nMarch 31, again involving the same Blue Tahoe, as well as Aaron Minter\n\nand his vehicle. Again they went up to the room, then they would leave for\n\n30 minutes and come back, multiple times, and sit for around 20-30 minutes\n\nin the vehicles in the parking lot at night. This suspicious behavior led the\n\nsecurity guard to believe drug activity was occurring, which led him to\n\ncontact law enforcement.\n\n       19. Based upon all of the foregoing, including Terrell’s attempt to\n\nconceal that he had a hotel room, his inconsistent answers regarding the\n\nhotel room, his apparent attempt to hide or get rid of the key to Hotel Room\n\n623, the observations of the security guard at the hotel, the ledger in\n\nTerrell’s pocket, and all of my training and experience, I believe it is highly\n\nlikely that Hotel Room 623 at the Marriott at 100 S. Fountain Ave.,\n\nSpringfield, Clark County, Ohio, will contain illegal narcotics and other\n\nevidence and proceeds of trafficking in drugs by Andre Terrell.\n\n       20. The following assertions are all based upon affiant and other\n\ndetectives of the drug unit’s training and experience:\n\n              • drug traffickers commonly use multiple cellular telephones\n\n       to communicate with buyers and sellers of narcotics via text\n\n       messaging and telephone calls, and said cellular telephones will\n\n       often contain evidence of drug trafficking such as text messages,\n\n       telephone calls, photographs, call history, application data, and other\n\n       electronic documents;\n\f                                                                                         -31-\n\n\n                     • narcotics traffickers typically maintain on hand large\n\n              amounts of U.S. currency in order to maintain and finance their\n\n              ongoing narcotics business;\n\n                     • narcotics traffickers maintain books, records, receipts, notes,\n\n              ledgers, and other papers relating to the transportation, ordering,\n\n              sale and distribution of controlled substances;\n\n                     • drug traffickers commonly have in their possession, firearms\n\n              used to protect and secure their property, narcotics, and money.\n\n              Said Affiant further says that on or about April 1, 2015 Hotel Room\n\n       623 at the Courtyard by Marriott located at 100 S. Fountain Ave.,\n\n       Springfield, Clark County, Ohio, does possess and conceal said things, or\n\n       some part thereof, at the place described above, then and there well\n\n       knowing the same violates section 2925.03 and 2925.11 of the Ohio\n\n       Revised Code as aforesaid.\n\n       {¶ 26} In overruling the portion of Terrell’s motion addressed to the search warrant,\n\nthe court indicated as follows:\n\n              The Court finds that the affidavit accompanying the aforementioned\n\n       warrant contains sufficient indicia of probable cause to pass muster under\n\n       the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n              Upon being presented with the information contained in the affidavit,\n\n       a reasonably prudent person would believe that there is a fair probability\n\n       that the place to be searched contained evidence of a crime. Therefore,\n\n       the Court concludes that the issuing judge had a substantial basis for\n\f                                                                                         -32-\n\n\n       concluding that probable cause existed.\n\n       {¶ 27} We note that on May 6, 2016, in his “Request to File Transcript,” Terrell\n\nrequested the transcripts of the two-day jury trial and of disposition. On July 8, 2016, the\n\ntranscript from the November 9, 2015 suppression hearing was filed. On July 13, 2016,\n\nthe video deposition of Megan Snyder and the deposition transcript were filed, along with\n\nthe trial transcript. On July 27, 2016, Terrell filed a “Motion for Extension of Time Within\n\nWhich to File Appellant’s Brief,” asserting that “an extension is necessary due to the\n\nvoluminous nature of the transcript; the need to supplement the record with exhibits and\n\nsuppression transcripts; and counsel will need sufficient time to review all of the\n\ntranscripts, and finalize Appellant’s Merit Brief.” Appellant’s brief was filed on September\n\n1, 2016, pursuant to this Court’s order, and no request to supplement the record was\n\nreceived from Terrell.\n\n       {¶ 28} Terrell asserts four assignments of error herein. His first assignment of\n\nerror is as follows:\n\n              THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT’S\n\n       MOTION TO SUPPRESS WHEN THE AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF THE\n\n       SEARCH WARRANT WAS FACIALLY DEFICIENT, OVERBROAD, AND\n\n       LACKED PROBABLE CAUSE.\n\n       {¶ 29} Terrell asserts that the “issuing judge improperly considered stale evidence\n\nprovided by Confidential Informants (‘CS’) in ruling that the search warrant contained\n\nsufficient probable cause. Further, the dated prior convictions of Appellant listed in the\n\naffidavit are stale and add no value to a probable cause determination.” Terrell asserts\n\nthat specifically, “paragraphs four through seven of Detective Mitchell’s affidavit contain\n\f                                                                                          -33-\n\n\nstale information obtained from confidential sources.” He asserts that the “affidavit also\n\nfails to demonstrate any evidence that Appellant was engaged in a continuing course of\n\ncriminal conduct.”\n\n       {¶ 30} Terrell argues further that in “addition to being stale, the information\n\nprovided by the confidential sources lacks any indicia of veracity, credibility, or basis of\n\nknowledge of the sources; and Detective Mitchell fails to demonstrate the sources[’]\n\nreliability through averment or corroboration.” According to Terrell, “statements from two\n\nconfidential sources and an unidentified caller allegedly from the Marriott Hotel were\n\nincluded in the affidavit by Detective Mitchell. All three of these sources allege facts\n\nwhich implicate Appellant in a crime, so the basis of their knowledge of the crime is called\n\ninto question.” Terrell argues that the “statements lack any degree of detail, do not\n\nindicate that they are based on the first-hand knowledge or personal observation of the\n\nsource, and lack reliability.”\n\n       {¶ 31} Regarding CS #1251, Terrell argues that based “on the information in the\n\naffidavit, it is impossible to determine if the CS was relating their own personal knowledge,\n\nor passing on a rumor they heard on the street. The complete lack of detail or indication\n\nof personal observation fails to demonstrate the source[’]s basis of knowledge, and\n\nprecludes a finding [of] probable cause.” Terrell asserts that the “affidavit contains no\n\naverment from the affiant as to the past reliability of CS #1251,” and that the “affidavit\n\nalso lacks police corroboration to potentially cure any defects in reliability,” such as “the\n\nuse of a controlled buy.”\n\n       {¶ 32} Regarding CS #1261, Terrell asserts that the information provided by him\n\nor her “is as devoid of specifics or indications of the source’s basis of such knowledge as\n\f                                                                                         -34-\n\n\nthat provided by CS #1251, but the affidavit does contain an averment to the reliability of\n\nCS #1261.” According to Terrell, however, “even where an affiant specifically avers to\n\nthe past reliability of a source, probable cause may not be found where an affidavit\n\ncontains no factual basis for a source’s knowledge.”\n\n       {¶ 33} Terrell asserts that State v. Dalpiaz, 151 Ohio App.3d 257, 2002-Ohio-7346,\n\n783 N.E.2d 976 (11th Dist.), is “strikingly similar” to the matter herein. He asserts as\n\nfollows:\n\n              The affidavit in the case at bar includes information from sources of\n\n       even more doubtful reliability, and provides significantly less specific\n\n       information than the informant in Dalpiaz.       The affiant states that the\n\n       Springfield Police Division has been investigating Appellant for trafficking in\n\n       drugs for several years. Affidavit, ¶ 2. Assuming this statement is true, the\n\n       most significant piece of evidence obtained by the Springfield Police over a\n\n       several year investigation is apparently that two confidential informants\n\n       provided the same alleged phone number for Appellant.             Considering\n\n       many lawful citizens who are not drug traffickers have phone numbers, that\n\n       two sources provided the same phone number for Appellant is useless in\n\n       demonstrating probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant; even if\n\n       the Springfield Police had verified that the number the sources provided\n\n       actually was Appellant’s.\n\n       {¶ 34} Terrell next argues that “Detective Mitchell intentionally, or with conscious\n\nindifference, presents several of his own inferences as empirical fact in the affidavit,”\n\nnamely “when he stated that the words in a notebook found in Appellant’s pocket were\n\f                                                                                          -35-\n\n\nthe nicknames of specific individuals, that those individuals were known drug traffickers,\n\nand that those drug traffickers were located in Springfield.” Terrell argues that Mitchell’s\n\nconclusion “that the numbers in the notebook indicate money specific individuals owed to\n\nAppellant for the sale of illegal drugs * * * involves an extremely complex and attenuated\n\nlogical leap.” Terrell asserts that “testimony given at trial indicates Detective Mitchell’s\n\ninclusion of undisclosed inferences as empirical fact in the affidavit were acts of\n\nmalfeasance or misfeasance.” Terrell argues that “Beau Collins, a Detective with the\n\nSpringfield drug unit since April, 2009, stated that he believes that the nickname Juve is\n\nassociated with a man named Jermaine Fleming, and Jerrell Fleming goes by the\n\nnickname ‘senior’. Trial Transcript, page 351, lines 18-19.”\n\n       {¶ 35} Terrell argues that “Detective Mitchell attached one page of the notebook\n\nto his affidavit, but omitted two others.”   He asserts that the “existence of these pages\n\nis never mentioned in the affidavit, nor were they submitted to the magistrate.” Terrell\n\nconcludes that the “omission of these pages, along with Detective Mitchell’s undisclosed\n\ninferences, deprived the magistrate of the opportunity to independently review the\n\nevidence and form his own inferences based upon the totality of the circumstances.”\n\n       {¶ 36} Terrell next asserts that the “affidavit in support of the search warrant\n\nsubmitted by Detective Mitchell contains no information indicating that Room 623 was\n\nbeing used by Appellant for drug trafficking.” Terrell asserts that the matter herein is\n\n“strikingly similar” to State v. Perez, 2015-Ohio-1753, 32 N.E.3d 1010 (2d Dist.). Terrell\n\nargues that therein “this Court held that an individual’s possession of a significant quantity\n\nof drugs or other evidence of drug trafficking does not establish probable cause to search\n\ntheir home without some additional evidentiary link.” Terrell asserts as follows:\n\f                                                                                           -36-\n\n              * * * Unlike the defendant in Perez, Appellant was not found with any\n\n       large amount of drugs; no evidence of an investigation of Appellant at any\n\n       other location is included; no reliable informant provided any specific\n\n       information about illegal items in Appellant’s possession, the affidavit does\n\n       not indicate that any unusually large amount of cash was found on Appellant\n\n       when he was searched outside his van; and the affidavit does not even\n\n       allege that anyone witnessed Appellant actually selling drugs.\n\n              The sole evidence of Appellant’s actual activity inside the hotel is that\n\n       a security guard saw Appellant enter and exit the hotel a number of times;\n\n       and sit around in his vehicle for 20-30 minutes at a time, sometimes with a\n\n       guest. * * * Observed conduct that is consistent with innocent as well as\n\n       criminal activity creates, at best, a suspicion of illegal activity, and is not\n\n       sufficient to establish probable cause.\n\n       {¶ 37} Finally, Terrell asserts that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule\n\ndoes not apply herein. He argues that the “sheer number of deficiencies and the overt\n\nlack of probable cause make it clear that no reasonable police officer acting in good faith\n\ncould have relied on the warrant.”\n\n       {¶ 38} The State responds that “the search warrant explains the ongoing drug unit\n\ninvestigation that relate[s] to Appellant and his history of drug related activity.       This\n\nhistorical information is provided to explain why Appellant’s activity observed on the\n\nevening in question shows that he was engaging in drug trafficking and not simply going\n\nto his car to smoke.” The State argues that the “historical information about Appellant’s\n\ndrug activity is provided to give context to the action observed on the evening in question.”\n\f                                                                                         -37-\n\n\nThe State relies upon the testimony of the security guard at the suppression hearing of\n\nOctober 2, 2015.\n\n       {¶ 39} Regarding the confidential informants, the State asserts that “as to CS\n\n#1261, the affidavit does include information related to the reliability of that source in\n\nparagraph #4. The information from CS #1251 is used to corroborate the information\n\nprovided from CS #1261 and show the pattern of Appellant’s conduct related to drug\n\ntrafficking.” The State asserts that the “information from the confidential informants is\n\nnot used in the affidavit to show that he was trafficking in drugs on March 31, 2015 in\n\nparticular and therefore there is nothing in the record to suggest that the court improperly\n\nconsidered the historical evidence from the confidential informants.”\n\n       {¶ 40} The State further argues that Mitchell’s assertion in the affidavit that the\n\nledger retrieved from Terrell contained information about known drug dealers “is not an\n\ninappropriate inference to be made by a drug unit detective familiar with the known drug\n\ndealers in Springfield.” According to the State, “this Court cannot consider testimony from\n\ntrial when reviewing suppression rulings.”\n\n       {¶ 41} The State asserts that the matter herein is distinct from Perez, and that the\n\n“evidence presented to the judge in the search warrant does provide a sufficient nexus\n\nbetween Appellant’s trafficking activity and the hotel room.”       The State asserts that\n\n“certainly the officers executing the search warrant in this case acted in good faith as they\n\nwere conducting a search pursuant to a search warrant signed by a judge.”\n\n       {¶ 42} In Reply, Terrell asserts that the “state cannot create a continuing course of\n\nconduct by arguing that, because Appellant was convicted of a drug offense eleven years\n\nago, he must still be involved in drug trafficking.” He asserts that his prior conviction\n\f                                                                                       -38-\n\n\ndoes not support the warrant. He asserts that “the only information, other than a phone\n\nnumber allegedly belonging to Appellant, provided by CS #1261 was provided in July,\n\n2014. The State fails to address the staleness of this information, and then argues that\n\nunreliable information corroborates stale information.”\n\n      {¶ 43} Terrell asserts as follows:\n\n             * * * The affidavit allows a search of Appellant’s hotel room for\n\n      evidence of drug trafficking, specifically including cocaine and heroin. The\n\n      sole reference to either cocaine or heroin included in the affidavit stems\n\n      from the statements of Confidential Sources.         It is axiomatic that an\n\n      affidavit could not demonstrate probable cause to search for evidence of a\n\n      crime that the affidavit makes literally no reference to. Considering there\n\n      is no basis upon which the issuing magistrate could have relied in issuing a\n\n      search warrant for cocaine and heroin; it is clear that, contrary to the\n\n      assertion of the State, this historical information was improperly considered\n\n      by the court.\n\n             The state has admitted that the Confidential Source information was\n\n      not even intended to demonstrate that Appellant was trafficking in drugs on\n\n      the night in question. The State cannot show a sufficient nexus between\n\n      the alleged crimes of possession of cocaine and heroin, and the hotel room\n\n      in question, where the State admits that the only information in the affidavit\n\n      even referencing cocaine or heroin does not create, and was never intended\n\n      to create, such a nexus.\n\n      {¶ 44} Terrell asserts that “Detective Mitchell included undisclosed inferences\n\f                                                                                          -39-\n\n\nregarding his conclusions that the words in a ledger found on Appellant were nicknames\n\nof specific people” who were known drug dealers, and that the “State’s sole argument in\n\nresponse is that Detective Mitchell’s inference regarding allegedly known nicknames was\n\nnot an inappropriate inference.” Terrell further argues that none of the pages of the\n\nledger “contain any overt references to narcotics, and none of them include dollar signs\n\nor any other representation that the numerals are actual dollar amounts.” He asserts\n\nthat the inclusion of “only the page of notebook that supports his undisclosed inference\n\nhighlights his overt, and apparently successful, attempt to preclude the issuing magistrate\n\nfrom making his determination based upon a full and fair review of the totality of the\n\ncircumstances.”\n\n       {¶ 45} Terrell asserts that “there is absolutely no evidence connecting actual drug\n\nactivity to Appellant’s hotel room.” He asserts that there “was no large amount of cash\n\nor drugs found on Appellant, in his vehicle, on Mr. Minter, or in Mr. Minter’s vehicle; yet\n\nthe State claims the perfectly legal activity of walking in and out of a hotel multiple times\n\ndemonstrates a sufficient nexus to connect Appellant and his hotel room to drug\n\ntrafficking.” Terrell asserts that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule should\n\nnot be applied.\n\n       {¶ 46} The Fourth Amendment provides that “no Warrants shall issue, but upon\n\nprobable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to\n\nbe searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” Crim.R. 41(C)(2) provides in part\n\nthat the “finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay in whole or in part,\n\nprovided there is a substantial basis for believing the source of the hearsay to be credible\n\nand for believing that there is a factual basis for the information furnished.”\n\f                                                                                        -40-\n\n      {¶ 47} As noted by the Supreme Court of Ohio, in State v. Castagnola, 145 Ohio\n\nSt.3d 1, 2015-Ohio-1565, 46 N.E.3d 638, ¶ 34:\n\n             Central to the Fourth Amendment is the probable cause requirement.\n\n      While a probable cause determination for an arrest warrant is similar in\n\n      nature to that for a search warrant, a search warrant inquiry is much more\n\n      complex and presents special considerations.         2 LaFave, Search and\n\n      Seizure, Section 3.1(b)(5th Ed. 2012). Special considerations to be taken\n\n      into account when determining whether to issue a search warrant include\n\n      how stale the information relied upon is, when the facts relied upon\n\n      occurred, and whether there is a nexus between the alleged crime, the\n\n      objects to be seized, and the place to be searched. Id., Section 3.7(a),(b),\n\n      and (d).\n\n      {¶ 48} As this Court has previously determined:\n\n             “In determining the sufficiency of probable cause in an affidavit\n\n      submitted in support of a search warrant, ‘[t]he task of the issuing magistrate\n\n      is simply to make a practical, common-sense decision whether, given all the\n\n      circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the “veracity”\n\n      and “basis of knowledge” of persons supplying hearsay information, there\n\n      is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a\n\n      particular place.’ ” State v. George, 45 Ohio St.3d 325, 544 N.E.2d 640\n\n      (1989), paragraph one of the syllabus, quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S.\n\n      213, 238-239, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).\n\n             “In reviewing the sufficiency of probable cause in an affidavit\n\f                                                                                        -41-\n\n\n       submitted in support of a search warrant issued by a magistrate, neither a\n\n       trial court nor an appellate court should substitute its judgment for that of\n\n       the magistrate by conducting a de novo determination as to whether the\n\n       affidavit contains sufficient probable cause upon which that court would\n\n       issue the search warrant.” Id. at paragraph two of the syllabus.    “Rather,\n\n       the duty of a reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a\n\n       substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. In conducting\n\n       any after-the-fact scrutiny of an affidavit submitted in support of a search\n\n       warrant, trial and appellate courts should accord great deference to the\n\n       magistrate’s determination of probable cause, and doubtful or marginal\n\n       cases in this area should be resolved in favor of upholding the warrant.” Id.\n\nState v. Terrell, 2d Dist. Clark No. 2011-CA-57, 2013-Ohio-124, ¶ 8-9.\n\n       {¶ 49} “Probable cause determinations are limited to the four corners of the\n\nunderlying affidavit.” State v. Hale, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23582, 2010-Ohio-2389, ¶\n\n20.\n\n       {¶ 50} We conclude that, viewing the totality of the circumstances, the affidavit in\n\nsupport of the search warrant herein provided adequate probable cause for the issuance\n\nof the warrant. Regarding Terrell’s assertion that his prior convictions constitute stale\n\ninformation, we conclude that they provide background and context for the officers’\n\nongoing involvement in investigating Terrell, and bear some relevancy to Terrell’s conduct\n\nthat night.\n\n       {¶ 51} Regarding paragraphs four through seven of the affidavit, we note that\n\nMitchell attested to the veracity of CS #1261, noting that he or she “has provided\n\f                                                                                       -42-\n\n\ninformation in the past about drug traffickers which has led to the issuance of a search\n\nwarrant, seizure of significant amounts of illegal drugs, and convictions.” While Terrell\n\nasserts that the information regarding his phone numbers is stale, in February 2015, CS\n\n# 1251 corroborated the phone number provided by CS #1261 in July 2014, as well as\n\nan additional number that matched the second number also provided by CS #1261. Both\n\ninformants advised that Terrell was selling illegal drugs.\n\n       {¶ 52} Most significantly, Terrell ignores the events of the night of his arrest.\n\nOfficers McCarty and Osborne were dispatched to the hotel on a report of suspected drug\n\nactivity. Upon Osborne’s approach of Terrell’s vehicle, he smelled marijuana, and he\n\nretrieved marijuana and what he believed to be methamphetamine from Terrell’s person.\n\nMitchell also located a ledger, the contents of which, in his experience, were consistent\n\nwith drug trafficking, namely the names of known drug dealers next to what Mitchell\n\nbelieved were dollar amounts representing money owed to Terrell for drugs.\n\nCorroborative of the information provided by the confidential sources, Terrell was also in\n\npossession of two cell phones. Additional marijuana was found inside Terrell’s vehicle.\n\nTerrell initially stated that he was staying in Room 615, then stated that did not have a\n\nroom at the hotel but was there to meet “some girl” whose name he did not know.\n\nMitchell subsequently learned that Terrell was registered at Room 623, having previously\n\nstayed at the hotel in Room 615 five days earlier. The security guard advised Mitchell\n\nthat he had personally observed Terrell engage in suspicious behavior that he believed\n\nwas drug activity in the hotel parking lot on March 26, 2015, and similar behavior on the\n\nnight of March 31, 2015. The guard advised Mitchell that Terrell and Minter on both\n\noccasions “went up to the room, then would leave for 30 minutes and come back, multiple\n\f                                                                                           -43-\n\n\ntimes, and sit for around 20-30 minutes in the vehicles in the parking lot at night.”\n\n       {¶ 53} In Dalpiaz, the police had evidence that Dalpiaz was cultivating marijuana.\n\nId., ¶ 28. As the Eleventh District noted:\n\n                The affidavit attached to the July 7 warrant contains the following\n\n       statements concerning [Chief Detective] Doak’s sources of information:\n\n       “[t]he affiant has received information that [appellant] makes frequent trips\n\n       both in the morning and evening hours * * *”; “[appellant] has been seen\n\n       making these trips * * *”; “[appellant] is commonly known to carry a firearm\n\n       on his side during these trips * * *”; “[a]ccording to confidential sources, this\n\n       individual has not worked * * * for several years”; “[t]he Portage County\n\n       Sheriff’s Office has received information that the cultivation of marijuana is\n\n       [appellant’s] only source of income”; and “[w]e have received information in\n\n       the past and currently know that [appellant] is known to booby trap the areas\n\n       where he cultivates marijuana.” Nowhere does the affidavit suggest that\n\n       this information was received from reliable sources. In fact, much of the\n\n       information provided in the affidavit is not even attributed to a particular\n\n       source or to particular sources.\n\n                In view of the complete absence of any indication of the reliability of\n\n       the sources that provided Doak with the information concerning appellant’s\n\n       activities outlined in the affidavit, the affidavit failed to establish probable\n\n       cause for the issuance of the search warrant, and appellant’s third\n\n       assignment of error is well taken.\n\nId., ¶ 36-37.\n\f                                                                                         -44-\n\n\n       {¶ 54} We cannot conclude, as does Terrell, that the affidavit herein is “strikingly\n\nsimilar” to that in Dalpiaz. The information in Mitchell’s affidavit is attributed to two\n\nspecific confidential sources, the observations of the security guard on March 26 and 31,\n\nand the observations of McCarty, Osborne and Mitchell, who interacted with Terrell.\n\n       {¶ 55} Regarding Terrell’s assertion that Mitchell presented his own inferences as\n\nempirical fact, we disagree. Mitchell has been employed by the City of Springfield Police\n\nDivision since January 2007, and he has been trained in narcotics enforcement.\n\nMitchell’s averments, in paragraph 15 of the affidavit, regarding the known nicknames of\n\nMinter and of specific drug traffickers in Springfield, are based on Mitchell’s personal\n\nknowledge. Further, based upon his experience, it is a reasonable inference that the\n\nnumbers in the ledger alongside the nicknames “likely indicate dollar amounts owed to\n\nTerrell for various types and amounts of illegal drugs.”\n\n       {¶ 56} The distinction between the matter herein and Castagnola is instructive.\n\nCastagnola admitted in a text message to “Source May” that he damaged the vehicles of\n\nDavid Maistros, a prosecutor. Id., ¶ 3. The text message indicated that Castagnola\n\n“ ‘[f]ound his address and went to his house * * *.’ ” Id., ¶ 6.   The affidavit provided to\n\nobtain the search warrant paraphrased the exchange between Castagnola and “Source\n\nMay” in part as follows: “Castagnola then says that he found Maistros online in the clerk\n\nof courts because he [Maistros] got a parking ticket several years ago.” Id., ¶ 8. “The\n\ndetective did not state in the search-warrant affidavit the internet-access capability or\n\nother capabilities of Castagnola’s cell phone.” Id., ¶ 9. “Nor did the search-warrant\n\naffidavit provide information, beyond the ‘online’ inference, to indicate that Castagnola\n\nhad conducted an online search for Maistros’s address or that a computer that was used\n\f                                                                                          -45-\n\nto conduct such a search was located in Castagnola’s residence.” Id. Upon execution\n\nof the warrant, child pornography was found on one of Castagnola’s computers. Id., ¶\n\n13.\n\n      {¶ 57} The Supreme Court of Ohio determined in part as follows:\n\n             In short, while there was probable cause to believe that Castagnola\n\n      had searched for [the prosecutor’s] address, the method of his search was\n\n      not clear.    We affirmatively reject the trial court’s assertion that in\n\n      determining whether an affidavit supports probable cause to issue a search\n\n      warrant, a magistrate can infer “online” activities by people of a certain age.\n\n      We further reject the trial court’s supposition that statements sent by text\n\n      message admitting criminal activity create a substantial basis for concluding\n\n      that evidence of a crime will be found on a computer. Similarly, we are not\n\n      inclined to leap to the conclusion that the information stored on a phone will\n\n      necessarily be backed up on a computer. Although we are in the computer\n\n      age, records of court activity still exist in paper form and are available to the\n\n      public in clerk of courts’ offices around the state.\n\nId., ¶ 63. The Castagnola Court determined that “the affiant negligently usurped the\n\ninference-drawing authority of the magistrate and * * * under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.” Id., ¶ 65.\n\n      {¶ 58} Herein, Mitchell’s averments are based on his personal knowledge of the\n\nidentities of the nicknames of Minter and the drug traffickers, and his inference regarding\n\nthe purpose of the ledger, containing names and numbers, is not attenuated, as the\n\ninference in Castagnola, but rather is reasonable based upon Mitchell’s experience.\n\f                                                                                         -46-\n\n\nFinally, we note that Mitchell attached the page of the ledger to the affidavit that he\n\nbelieved to be relevant to his investigation, again based upon his experience.\n\n       {¶ 59}    We agree with the State that Terrell’s reliance upon the testimony of Beau\n\nCollins in the trial transcript to attempt to discredit Mitchell’s reasonable inferences is\n\nmisplaced. In State v. Harris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26810, 2016-Ohio-7097, ¶ 3, this\n\nCourt emphasized that “when reviewing suppression rulings, we consider only the\n\nevidence before the trial court at the suppression hearing; we cannot consider any\n\nadditional evidence presented at a subsequent trial.”\n\n       {¶ 60} Regarding Terrell’s assertion that the affidavit lacked a nexus between the\n\ndrugs found on his person and in his hotel room, we disagree. In Perez, upon which Terrell\n\nrelies, this Court noted as follows:\n\n                The affidavit in support of the June 27 warrant indicates that Perez\n\n       was involved in drug trafficking and that evidence of that trafficking was\n\n       located in his home. He also used his truck to conduct drug transactions\n\n       away from his home. Upon the search of Perez’s truck and subsequent\n\n       investigation, police discovered that Perez recently rented a storage unit at\n\n       the Stop-N-Lock on Linden Avenue.            Based on this information, a\n\n       reasonable police officer might suspect that the previously-seen, but not yet\n\n       located weapons and additional evidence of drug trafficking might be found\n\n       in the storage unit. However, a reasonable belief, without some evidentiary\n\n       support, is not enough for a search warrant.\n\nId., ¶ 19.\n\n       {¶ 61} Unlike in Perez, we conclude that there is sufficient evidentiary support of a\n\f                                                                                         -47-\n\n\nnexus between the alleged crime of drug trafficking, the objects to be seized, and Room\n\n623. As noted above, Terrell was the subject of a drug trafficking investigation, and the\n\nsecurity guard reported activity consistent with drug trafficking to Mitchell occurring on\n\ntwo occasions, namely March 25 and the night of Terrell’s arrest. It was reasonable to\n\ninfer that in the course of his comings and goings, as described by the security guard,\n\nTerrell transported drugs to purchasers. While the amount of drugs retrieved from Terrell\n\nwas not large, his ledger and his possession of more than one cell phone suggest an\n\nongoing drug trafficking activity. His evasive answers about his room further suggest the\n\npotential presence of contraband that he sought to conceal. Finally, Mitchell confirmed\n\nthat Terrell was the registered guest of Room 623 on the night of his arrest, and the\n\nregistered guest of Room 615 on March 25.\n\n       {¶ 62} For the foregoing reasons, and deferring to the magistrate’s determination\n\nof probable cause, we conclude that the facts in the affidavit provided a substantial basis\n\nfor finding probable cause to believe that drugs likely were present in Room 623.\n\nAccordingly, we need not address Terrell’s assertion regarding the good faith exception.\n\nTerrell’s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶ 63} Terrell’s second assignment of error is as follows:\n\n              THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT’S\n\n       MOTION TO SUPPRESS WHEN THE WARRANT WAS SO LACKING IN\n\n       PARTICULARITY AS TO BE FACIALLY DEFICIENT, AND THE\n\n       EXECUTING         OFFICERS        FLAGRANTLY        DISREGARDED          THE\n\n       LIMITATIONS THE WARRANT DID CONTAIN.\n\n       {¶ 64} Terrell asserts that the warrant lacks particularity, and that our standard of\n\f                                                                                          -48-\n\n\nreview is de novo. Terrell notes that “specifically the warrant states that the police should\n\nseize, items showing an ownership or possessory interest in the residence and any items\n\nlocated therein.” He further argues that the “warrant states that the contents of cell\n\nphones subject to seizure include ‘contact lists, text messages, call history, photographs,\n\nvideos, application data, location data, and other documents and data.’ ” According to\n\nTerrell, “the warrant gave the officers carte blanche to seize whatever they might think\n\nincriminating or useful to them.” Terrell directs our attention to the trial testimony of\n\nDetective Scott Curnutte, whose “statement that he was searching for anything that might\n\nbe interesting explicitly shows that the officers executing the search warrant were in no\n\nway limited by the express terms in the warrant, and that he arrived at Room 623 with the\n\nintent to participate in the type of ‘general rummaging’ and exploratory search expressly\n\nprohibited by the Fourth Amendment.”\n\n       {¶ 65} Finally, again citing the trial transcript, Terrell asserts that the “officers\n\nexecuting the search warrant seized a candle warmer, a coffee cup, a bottle of Patron\n\ntequila, the box the bottle of Patron came in, several glasses, empty Kroger shopping\n\nbags, and wrist watch * * *. None of these items have any possible relation to drug\n\ntrafficking.”\n\n       {¶ 66} Regarding the particularity of the warrant, as noted in Castagnola:\n\n                Courts addressing the particularity requirement of the Fourth\n\n       Amendment are concerned with two issues. The first issue is whether the\n\n       warrant provides sufficient information to “guide and control” the judgment\n\n       of the executing officers in what to seize. United States v. Upham, 168\n\n       F.3d 532, 535 (1st Cir.1999). The second issue is whether the category as\n\f                                                                                          -49-\n\n       specified is too broad in that it includes items that should not be seized. See\n\n       United States v. Kow, 58 F.3d 423, 427 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\nId., at 79. “Catchall provisions of warrants also ‘ “must be read in conjunction with the\n\nlist of particularly described items which preceded it pertaining to the crimes alleged.” * *\n\n* ’ ”. State v. Hale, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23582, 2010-Ohio-2389, ¶ 43 (citation\n\nomitted) .\n\n       {¶ 67} We note that Terrell did not raise the particularity of the warrant or the scope\n\nof the search before the trial court. The only issue before the trial court at the hearing\n\non November 9, 2015, and the only issue the court addressed, was whether there was\n\nsufficient probable cause to support the issuance of the warrant. We conclude that Terrell\n\nwaived all but plain error as to the issues that he now asserts by failing to raise them in\n\nthe trial court. State v. Zwick, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2013 CA 4, 2014-Ohio-230, ¶ 18. (“In\n\nhis motion to suppress, Zwick challenged the issuance of the search warrants, not\n\nwhether the seizure of items pursuant to the warrants exceeded the scope of the warrants.\n\nBecause Zwick failed to raise the scope of the warrants in the trial court, he has waived\n\nall but plain error on that issue.”)\n\n       {¶ 68} The portions of the warrant referring to the contents of cell phones and\n\n“any” items located in Terrell’s hotel room must be read in conjunction with the list of\n\nparticularly described items before them in the warrant. When the listed items, namely\n\n“[h]eroin, cocaine, marijuana, controlled substance analogs, drug paraphernalia, items\n\nused to transport, package, or prepare drugs for sale, money, financial records of drug\n\ntrafficking activity,* * *” are properly read in conjunction with the broader, “catchall”\n\nprovisions regarding the hotel room and the phones, plain error is not demonstrated.\n\f                                                                                          -50-\n\n\n       {¶ 69} Regarding the non-contraband items listed above seized in the course of\n\nthe search, there was no evidence before the trial court regarding any items seized. As\n\nnoted above, in addressing the trial court’s decision on the motion to suppress, we will\n\nnot consider the testimony adduced at trial. Plain error is not demonstrated, and for the\n\nforegoing reasons, Terrell’s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶ 70} Terrell’s third assignment of error is as follows:\n\n              THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT OVERRULED THE MOTION\n\n       TO SUPPRESS, BECAUSE THE OFFICER PAT SEARCHED [sic]\n\n       APPELLANT       ABSENT      A   REASONABLE         SUSPICION       THAT     HE\n\n       POSSESSED A WEAPON,                AND ANY CONSENT WAS GIVEN\n\n       INVOLUNTARILY.\n\n       {¶ 71} Terrell argues that “McCarty stated at trial that the search he conducted\n\nwas not for weapons, Appellant had given him no reason to believe he had a weapon,\n\nand that he was specifically looking for evidence of drugs.” Terrell asserts that there is\n\n“some discrepancy in the record as to whether or not Officer McCarty searched Appellant\n\nbefore or after Officer Osborne indicated that he smelled marijuana from the vehicle; but\n\nin either case, Appellant’s rights were violated.”\n\n       {¶ 72} Terrell directs our attention to this Court’s decision in State v. Alexander, 2d\n\nDist. Montgomery No. 18205, 2000 WL 1062064 (Aug. 4, 2000). Therein, one officer\n\napproached a vehicle in a hotel parking lot at 11:30 p.m. Id., *1. The officer smelled a\n\nstrong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle. Id. When the driver of the vehicle\n\ncould not produce identification and exhibited “assertive movements,” the officer decided\n\nto pat him down for officer safety. Id., *2. This Court noted that smoking marijuana is not\n\f                                                                                          -51-\n\n\n“an especially serious offense,” and that there was “nothing in the record to suggest that\n\nAlexander was a drug dealer.” Id., *3. The Court concluded that “the strong odor of\n\nmarijuana, indicative of Alexander’s use of marijuana, even if he was not buying or selling\n\nmarijuana, justified Smith in conducting a limited pat-down search for weapons when he\n\ndecided it was necessary to place Alexander in the back of his police cruiser to separate\n\nhim from the other occupant of the car, while Alexander’s identification was being\n\nverified.” Id., *4. Terrell asserts that “[u]nlike in Alexander, Officer McCarty expressly\n\nstates that the search was not for weapons, and was done to locate drugs. There was\n\nno concern expressed regarding officer safety, and the ‘close call’ found in Alexander\n\nbecomes an obvious violation in those circumstances.”\n\n       {¶ 73} Alternatively, Terrell argues that if he “was not in custody and entitled to the\n\nprotections of Miranda at the time of the search, then Appellant was unlawfully detained,\n\nand his consent was not freely or voluntarily given.” According to Terrell, if “the search\n\nwas made prior to Officer Osborne detecting the smell of marijuana, th[e]n Officer\n\nMcCarty had absolutely no reason to search Appellant; and detaining a hotel guest for\n\nsitting in their vehicle outside the hotel would be asinine.” Terrell argues that if he was\n\nsearched after Osborne indicated that he intended to search the vehicle based upon the\n\nsmell of marijuana, “then Appellant was already aware that a search of his vehicle was\n\ngoing to be performed without his consent, and without the officers even asking for his\n\nconsent, so he would have no reason to think that refusing to allow Officer McCarty to\n\nsearch his person would actually have any effect whatsoever on whether the search was\n\nperformed.”\n\n       {¶ 74} Terrell asserts that the “State will likely argue that Appellant consented to\n\f                                                                                       -52-\n\n\nthe search because he said, ‘I don’t care’, in response to the search request. Appellant’s\n\nstatement was not an affirmative waiver of his constitutional rights, it was resignation\n\nbased on his understanding that a search would be conducted no matter what he said.”\n\nTerrell asserts as follows:\n\n              * * * Appellant was apprehensive of elevating the confrontation with\n\n       Officer McCarty, and believed refusing consent would only create a far more\n\n       contentious atmosphere, and that Officer McCarty would search him\n\n       anyway. After being read his rights, Appellant refused to consent to a\n\n       search of his hotel room; but when Officer McCarty asked to search him,\n\n       Appellant had not been read his rights, and didn’t believe he had the ability\n\n       to refuse, because no one had told him he could. Appellant did not willingly\n\n       and voluntarily consent to a search, he resigned himself to the inevitable,\n\n       and said that he did not care.\n\n       {¶ 75} The State responds that “when looking at the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the consent it is clear that there was consent for the officers to search\n\nAppellant’s person.” According to the State, “Officer McCarty testified at the suppression\n\nhearing that he asked Appellant if he minded if Officer McCarty searched him and that\n\nAppellant responded that he didn’t care.” The State further asserts that “Officer McCarty\n\nalso testified that he asked Appellant specifically if he could check inside his p[o]ckets\n\nand appellant again responded that he didn’t care.” The State argues that Terrell’s\n\n“consent to search his person was heard by the hotel security officer who testified at the\n\nsuppression hearing that Appellant consented to the search.” According to the State,\n\nthere “was no evidence presented at the suppression hearing to counter the consent\n\f                                                                                          -53-\n\n\ngiven,” and officers “are not required to inform a subject that they can refuse to search for\n\nconsent to be effective.” The State notes that Terrell “had no problem” refusing consent\n\nto search his hotel room.\n\n       {¶ 76} In reply, Terrell argues as follows:\n\n              Appellant’s arguments that he believed he could not refuse consent,\n\n       and that he did not refuse out of fear, are not separate arguments, but two\n\n       parts of a whole.      At the time Officer McCarty requested to search\n\n       Appellant, Officer Osborne had already indicated that Appellant’s vehicle\n\n       would be searched without his consent. Appellant had not been read his\n\n       Miranda rights, knew that his vehicle was being searched without his\n\n       consent, and; according to Officer McCarty, Appellant was being detained.\n\n       * * * Under these circumstances, Appellant believed that if he did attempt to\n\n       refuse consent, he would be searched anyway; and feared that any attempt\n\n       to refuse would only result in creating a more confrontational situation with\n\n       the officers.\n\n       {¶ 77} Terrell acknowledges that he refused consent to search his hotel room, but\n\nnotes that “this was after Officer Osborne informed Appellant of his Miranda rights.\n\nAppellant’s understanding that he could effectively and safely refuse to consent to a\n\nsearch of his hotel room was a direct byproduct [sic] of being informed through Miranda\n\nthat his rights would be honored.” According to Terrell, the State “may be correct that\n\nofficers are not necessarily required to inform a suspect of his rights prior to a request for\n\nconsent in all circumstances, but officers are certainly required to do so when a suspect\n\nis in custody, and Officer McCarty openly admits that Appellant was being detained.”\n\f                                                                                          -54-\n\n\nFinally, Terrell notes that “Officer McCarty admits that Appellant’s statement that he did\n\nnot care was not an affirmative yes.”\n\n       {¶ 78} As this Court has previously noted:\n\n              “Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question\n\n       of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court\n\n       assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to\n\n       resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.” State\n\n       v. Koon, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26296, 2015-Ohio-1326, ¶ 13 quoting\n\n       State v. Burnside, 100 Ohio St.3d 152, 2003-Ohio-5372, 797 N.E.2d 71, ¶\n\n       8. “Consequently, an appellate court must accept the trial court's findings of\n\n       fact if they are supported by competent, credible evidence. Accepting these\n\n       facts as true, the appellate court must then independently determine,\n\n       without deference to the conclusion of the trial court, whether the facts\n\n       satisfy the applicable legal standard.” Id. The application of the law to the\n\n       trial court's findings of fact is subject to a de novo standard of review. State\n\n       v. Gordon, 5th Dist.

Consent to a search that is obtained by threats or force, or granted\n\n      only in submission to a claim of lawful authority, is invalid. Id. Such “lawful\n\n      authority” is an express or implied false claim by police that they can\n\n      immediately proceed to make the search in any event. Bumper v.

Montgomery No. 25945, 2014-Ohio-4853, ¶ 28.\n\n      {¶ 83} As this Court previously noted:\n\n               Courts and commentators have recognized that “consent [to search]\n\n      may be implied by the circumstances surrounding the search, by the\n\f                                                                                       -57-\n\n\n      person’s prior actions or agreements, or by the person’s failure to object to\n\n      the search.” Kuras, et al., Warrantless Searches and Seizures (2002), 90\n\n      Geo.L.J. 1130, 1172. “Thus a search may be lawful even if the person\n\n      giving consent does not recite the talismanic phrase ‘You have my\n\n      permission to search.’ * * *.”\n\nState v. Lane, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21501, 2006-Ohio-6830, ¶ 40.\n\n      {¶ 84} We initially note that Terrell mischaracterizes McCarty’s testimony in\n\nasserting that the search he conducted of Terrell’s person was not for weapons.\n\nMcCarty testified that he was dispatched to the Marriott on the report of “suspicious”\n\noccupants in a vehicle engaged in suspected drug activity, namely coming and going from\n\nthe hotel parking lot after making repeated trips to a room inside the hotel. McCarty\n\ntestified that he and Osborne approached the vehicle described in the dispatch, and that\n\nthereafter Osborne, from the passenger side, informed McCarty that he intended to\n\nsearch the vehicle based upon a very strong odor of marijuana. McCarty testified that\n\nhe requested Terrell’s permission to search for “any weapons, or drugs or anything of that\n\nnature.” (Emphasis added.) We note that “Ohio courts have long recognized that persons\n\nwho engage in illegal drug activities are often armed with a weapon. * * * State v. Evans,\n\n67 Ohio St.3d 405, 413, 1993-Ohio-186.” State v. Martin, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n20270, 2004-Ohio-2738, ¶ 17.\n\n      {¶ 85} We further note that the facts in Alexander are distinguishable from the\n\nmatter herein; in Alexander, “the only drug violation for which Smith had a reasonable\n\nand articulable suspicion at the time of the pat-down search was the smoking of\n\nmarijuana,” and only one officer had approached Alexander’s vehicle. Id., *4. Here, two\n\f                                                                                        -58-\n\n\nofficers responded to a report of drug activity, namely suspected drug trafficking, and the\n\nfacts herein are accordingly more compelling than in Alexander to justify a pat down\n\nsearch.\n\n       {¶ 86} Further, we conclude that the record demonstrates that Terrell consented\n\nto the search and did not merely submit to a claim of authority. On direct examination,\n\nMcCarty stated that Terrell indicated that he did not mind if McCarty searched him, and\n\nMcMahan testified that Terrell consented to a search of his person. While McCarty’s\n\nreport indicated that Terrell responded that he “did not care,” when asked for his consent\n\nto search, nothing in the record demonstrates that Terrell refused to give consent;\n\nMcCarty testified, Terrell “didn’t give an affirmative no.” As noted above, consent may be\n\nimplied by a person’s failure to object to the search.\n\n       {¶ 87} Further, as the State notes, in State v. Iacona, 9th Dist. Medina No. CA\n\n2891-M, 2000 WL 277911 (March 15, 2000), the defendant therein argued that the trial\n\ncourt erred in denying her motion to suppress, since law enforcement “illegally detained\n\nthe Iacona family and * * * their consent to a search of the home was not voluntary.” Id.,\n\n*8. The officer in Iacona “arrived at the home of Defendant after he received a dispatch\n\nthat there was a dead baby in the basement of the home. Upon arrival, the patrolman\n\nwas greeted by Defendant’s mother, who invited him into the home.” Id., *9. The officer\n\nadvised defendant’s mother of the nature of the dispatch, and verbal consent to search\n\nthe premises was provided by her in response to the officer’s request, namely, “You mind\n\nif I take a look down the basement?” Id., *9. Mrs. Iacona responded, “No. I don’t care.”\n\nId.   The Ninth District determined that the search of the residence “was conducted\n\npursuant to a valid consent.” Id., *10.\n\f                                                                                         -59-\n\n\n       {¶ 88} Finally, we note that there is no evidence in the record before us of coercive\n\npolice conduct, or that Terrell was under duress, and there is no suggestion in the officers’\n\ntestimony that Terrell’s judgment was impaired. That Terrell indicated to Osborne that\n\nhe did not want to answer questions about the female whom he was allegedly at the hotel\n\nto visit, and that he indicated to Mitchell, when asked for permission to search the room,\n\nthat he wanted to speak to his attorney, suggest that Terrell was aware of his right to\n\nrefuse consent. Finally, whether Terrell’s consent was voluntarily given is a question of\n\nfact, and the trial court clearly credited McCarty’s testimony, and we defer to the trial\n\ncourt’s assessment of credibility. Under the totality of the circumstances, we find that\n\nTerrell’s third assignment of error lacks merit, and it is accordingly overruled.\n\n       {¶ 89} Terrell’s fourth assignment of error is as follows:\n\n              THE UNWARRANTED “PROTECTIVE SWEEP” OF APPELLANT’S\n\n       HOTEL ROOM WAS A VIOLATION OF APPELLANT’S FOURTH\n\n       AMENDMENT RIGHTS, AND WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY ANY EXIGENT\n\n       CIRCUMSTANCES.\n\n       {¶ 90} Terrell asserts as follows:\n\n              * * * The State will attempt to argue that Officer McCarty claims to\n\n       have heard the TV on in the room, and this created a reasonable fear that\n\n       there might be another person in the room to destroy evidence. Officer\n\n       McCarty is the only officer present during that search who claims to have\n\n       heard the television on; however, even if true, it had absolutely no bearing\n\n       on the officer’s decision to enter the room. Further, upon entering the\n\n       room, it was immediately apparent to the officers that the TV was on, yet\n\f                                                                                          -60-\n\n\n       they proceeded with their “protective sweep” anyway.\n\n              This was not a scenario where the officers walked upstairs, knocked\n\n       on the door, and heard frantic movement, or the frequent flushing of a toilet,\n\n       leading them to believe that evidence actually was being destroyed, and\n\n       necessitating that the officers kick the door down to preserve the evidence\n\n       of the offense. Instead, the officers obtained a key from the front desk\n\n       before they went upstairs. They had no reason to suspect evidence was\n\n       being destroyed, nor a reason to believe that anyone was in the room, they\n\n       had simply decided before they even got in the elevator that they were going\n\n       to check in the room and make sure. Whether Officer McCarty heard the\n\n       television when he arrived had no impact on the officers’ decision.\n\n       {¶ 91} Terrell argues that “officers admitted at trial that they had no knowledge or\n\nreasonable belief that there was anyone else in the hotel room. Further, the officers\n\ncertainly did not have a reasonable belief that the destruction of evidence was imminent,\n\nbecause at the time they made the warrantless entry the officers had no specific reason\n\nto believe that there even was evidence to destroy.”\n\n       {¶ 92} According to Terrell, trial testimony “indicates that the officers never had\n\nthe lights of their vehicle on when they pulled into the hotel. Appellant was in sight of the\n\npolice at all times, and there is certainly no indication that he made a phone call during\n\nthe encounter with the police.” He argues that if a third party was present in Room 623,\n\n“it is extremely unlikely that they would be aware of what was going on in the parking lot,\n\nor know to start destroying evidence. Further, the officers indicated at trial that it was at\n\nleast forty-five minutes between their initial interaction with Appellant, and the search of\n\f                                                                                         -61-\n\n\nRoom 623.” Terrell asserts that if “a third party was in the room, and unaware of the\n\npolice, then the police created any exigency which may have existed by walking up to the\n\nroom and announcing themselves, rather than simply waiting outside until a warrant could\n\nbe obtained.”\n\n      {¶ 93} The State responds that the “initial entry into the hotel room was based on\n\nexigent circumstances and only made for the purpose of securing the room to ensure that\n\nno evidence was destroyed.” The State asserts that “the officers had a reasonable belief\n\nthat someone else might be inside the hotel room because Appellant told Officer Osborn\n\nthat there was a female in the hotel room that he was there to visit.” According to the\n\nState, it “is also reasonable that that person in the room could destroy evidence because\n\nsomeone in a hotel room, expecting Appellant to return to the room as he had been doing\n\nall evening, could have easily looked out the window and seen Appellant interacting with\n\nofficers and destroyed evidence.” The State notes that Officer McCarty heard someone\n\nspeaking, knocked on the door without response, and that such a circumstance “could\n\nlead to a reasonable belief that someone was in the room and destroying evidence.”\n\n      {¶ 94} The State argues that even if this Court finds that “the initial entry into the\n\nroom was unlawful, it did not affect the search conducted pursuant to the search warrant.”\n\nAccording to the State, “all of the evidence obtained in this case is wholly dependent and\n\nin no way the product of the initial warrantless entry into the residence.” The State notes\n\nthat both “officer Osborne and Officer McCarty testified at the suppression hearing that\n\nthey were in the hotel room for less than a minute and they only ensured that there was\n\nno one in the room that could destroy evidence.”\n\n      {¶ 95} In reply, Terrell argues, regarding the State’s assertion that the officers\n\f                                                                                           -62-\n\n\nbelieved someone else might be inside the hotel room, that “Detective Mitchell’s affidavit\n\nshows that this is not true. The affidavit states that Appellant told Officer Osborn that he\n\nwas at the hotel to meet a woman, but that she had not shown up yet.” According to\n\nTerrell, the “State cannot base a claim of exigent circumstances on this statement of\n\nAppellant, because Appellant said that the woman was not there.”\n\n         {¶ 96} Further, Terrell asserts that “it is clear that the officers did not believe\n\nAppellant about either the presence of a woman, or his room number.                  Appellant\n\nindicated that his room was 615, but officers searched Room 623 after speaking with hotel\n\nstaff. The officers were further informed that only one person was staying in the hotel\n\nroom.”\n\n         {¶ 97} Finally, Terrell asserts as follows:\n\n                The State’s argument that an exigent circumstance was created\n\n         because Officer McCarty heard voices inside the room when officers were\n\n         outside of it is similarly flawed. The voices were actually the television, and\n\n         no one was in the room. The officers arrived at the room with every intent\n\n         of entering it, regardless of any sounds they may have heard from inside.\n\n         The officers obtained a key to the room from the front desk before ever\n\n         going near the room, and the only reason to obtain the key is to open the\n\n         door. The State cannot claim that an exigency was created by any voices\n\n         Officer McCarty thought he heard when the officers went to the room with\n\n         every intention of entering it.\n\n         {¶ 98} As this Court has previously noted:\n\n                “It is well recognized that police may enter a home without a warrant\n\f                                                                                 -63-\n\n\nwhere they have probable cause to search and exigent circumstances exist\n\njustifying the entry.” State v.

Therefore, any entry based upon exigent\n\ncircumstances is “ ‘strictly circumscribed by the exigencies which justif[ied]\n\nits initiation.’ ” State v.

Nelson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. CA9363,\n\n1986 WL 9504, *6 (Aug. 22, 1986):\n\n              * * * Segura holds that when the information on which a search\n\n       warrant was secured came from an independent source and not from the\n\n       original entry, evidence obtained lawfully under the warrant was admissible.\n\n       Under such circumstances the illegality of the original entry is irrelevant on\n\n       the admission of evidence and the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine not\n\n       applicable.\n\n       {¶ 101} As noted above, the officers were dispatched to the scene on a report of\n\nsuspected drug activity that involved Terrell repeatedly appearing in the parking lot and\n\nreturning to his room in the hotel, activity that had occurred on a previous occasion. As\n\nfurther noted above, Terrell was deceptive about the circumstances of his presence at\n\nthe hotel. He was further misleading about the presence of the alleged female guest.\n\nTerrell initially advised Osborne that he was there to visit the female. Mitchell testified\n\nthat he learned from McCarty (via Osborne) that Terrell indicated that he was not a guest\n\nat the hotel but was visiting the female in Room 615. McCarty, however, testified that\n\nTerrell advised him that he was a guest at the hotel, in Room 615, and that McMahan\n\ncould vouch for his status as a registered guest.\n\f                                                                                        -66-\n\n\n       {¶ 102} Osborne testified that he was instructed to secure Room 623, the room to\n\nwhich the officers eventually confirmed Terrell was registered. Osborne stated that he\n\n“checked it for people. That’s it.”   He stated that he “didn’t open anything or touch\n\nanything.” Osborne stated that he did so because he “didn’t know” if anyone was inside\n\nthe room. Osborne, an experienced officer, stated that he believed that “there was some\n\ntype of drug activity going on in” the hotel room based upon the strong odor of marijuana\n\ncoming from the van, his familiarity with Terrell’s and Minter’s criminal history involving\n\ndrug activity, and the report of suspected drug activity at the hotel by McMahan. Osborne\n\nstated that he was inside the room for “less than ten seconds” to “make sure there was\n\nnobody inside of the room to destroy anything that could be inside.”\n\n       {¶ 103} Consistent with Osborne’s testimony, McCarty testified that his intent in\n\nentering the room was “to secure it,” and to make “sure there was nobody in there that\n\ncould destroy any possible evidence before we could search it.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nMcCarty testified that he had reason to believe someone was inside the room because\n\nTerrell indicated “at some point, he was with some female in the room.” Like Osborne,\n\nMcCarty testified that the sweep of the room was limited in time and scope. He stated\n\nthat he was in the room “[m]aybe a minute or less,” and that as he walked through the\n\nroom he checked between the beds and in the shower for people. Unlike Osborne,\n\nMcCarty further testified that he heard “very faint voices” emanating from the room,\n\nthereby bolstering his concern that the room was occupied. We note that while Terrell\n\nasserts that the officers learned from the front desk that the room was registered to him\n\nalone, such that he was the sole occupant of the room, hotel personnel may not know if\n\na registered guest has visitors.\n\f                                                                                          -67-\n\n\n       {¶ 104} Most significantly, in the course of entering and securing the room pending\n\nthe search warrant, the officers did not retrieve any evidence.       In other words, the\n\ninformation that served as the basis for the search warrant, as noted above, came from\n\nsources independent of the original protective sweep. For the foregoing reasons, we\n\nconclude that Terrell’s fourth assigned error lacks merit. It is accordingly overruled.\n\n       {¶ 105} On January 18, 2017, Terrell filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental\n\nbrief, as well as a supplemental brief, and this Court granted the motion on January 24,\n\n2017. Terrell directed this Court’s attention to State v. Gonzales, Ohio Supreme Court\n\nSlip Opinion No. 2016-Ohio-8319 (“Gonzales I”), asserting two assignments of error as\n\nfollows:\n\n              APPELLANT’S CONVICTION TO [sic] A FELONY OF THE FIRST\n\n       DEGREE UNDER R.C. §2925.11(C)(4)(e); AND A FELONY OF THE FIRST\n\n       DEGREE UNDER §2925.03(C)(4)(f); WERE NOT SUPPORTED BY\n\n       SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND WERE AGAINST THE MANIFEST\n\n       WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE PURSUANT TO THE OHIO SUPREME\n\n       COURT’S DECISION IN STATE V. GONZALES.\n\n              And,\n\n              THE TRIAL COURT’S JURY INSTRUCTION AND APPELLANT’S\n\n       SENTENCE       TO    A   MANDATORY         TERM     OF    INCARCERATION\n\n       CONSTITUTE PLAIN ERROR.\n\n       {¶ 106} We initially note that Megan Snyder testified at trial that she is a forensic\n\nscientist in the drug chemistry section of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations. She\n\ntestified via video deposition at trial that she tested two samples of substances retrieved\n\f                                                                                      -68-\n\n\nfrom Terrell’s hotel room and confirmed that they were cocaine. She stated that one of\n\nthe samples weighed 42.53 grams, and one of them weighed 42.34 grams, for a total\n\nweight of 84.87 grams.\n\n      {¶ 107} As this Court previously noted:\n\n             When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, he is\n\n      arguing that the State presented inadequate evidence on each element of\n\n      the offense to sustain the verdict as a matter of law. State v. Hawn, 138\n\n      Ohio App.3d 449, 471 N.E.2d 594 (2d Dist. 2000). “An appellate court's\n\n      function when reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal\n\n      conviction is to examine the evidence admitted at trial to determine whether\n\n      such evidence, if believed, would convince the average mind of the\n\n      defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The relevant inquiry is\n\n      whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the\n\n      prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential\n\n      elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” State v. Jenks,\n\n      61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus.\n\n             Our analysis is different when reviewing a manifest-weight\n\n      argument. When a conviction is challenged on appeal as being against the\n\n      weight of the evidence, an appellate court “reviewing the entire record,\n\n      weighs the evidence and all reasonable inferences, considers the credibility\n\n      of witnesses and determines whether in resolving conflicts in the evidence,\n\n      the jury clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of\n\n      justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered. The\n\f                                                                                         -69-\n\n\n      discretionary power to grant a new trial should be exercised only in the\n\n      exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the\n\n      conviction.” State v.

Barnes, 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 2002-Ohio-68, 759 N.E.2d 1240. Under\n\n      the plain error doctrine, errors affecting substantial rights may be noticed on\n\n      appeal although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court.\n\n      Crim.R. 52(B).\n\nState v. Henley, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26604, 2015-Ohio-4113, ¶ 10.\n\n      {¶ 111} Rafael Gonzales was convicted of possession of cocaine, and the jury\n\nfound that “the amount of cocaine involved equaled or exceeded 100 grams.” Gonzales\n\nI, ¶ 5. Gonzales received a mandatory sentence of 11 years. Id. In Gonzales I, the\n\nSupreme Court of Ohio recognized a conflict between State v. Gonzales, 6th District\n\nWood No. WD-13-086, 2015-Ohio-461, ¶ 47 (“Because the state failed to introduce\n\nevidence as to the purity or weight of the cocaine in this case, we find that appellant’s\n\npenalty enhancement under R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)(f) must be reversed and vacated.”), and\n\nthis Court’s decision in State v. Smith, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2010-CA-36, 2011-Ohio-2568,\n\n¶ 12 (“Case law does not support Smith’s claim that the State was required to segregate\n\nthe cocaine from the other ingredients in the substance.”). The Court considered the\n\nfollowing certified question: “Must the state, in prosecuting cocaine offenses involving\n\nmixed substances under R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)[(b)] through (f), prove that the weight of the\n\ncocaine meets the statutory threshold, excluding the weight of any filler materials used in\n\nthe mixture?” Gonzales I, ¶ 1.\n\n      {¶ 112} The Supreme Court noted that it found “nothing in the language of R.C.\n\n2925.11(C)(4)(f) to be ambiguous.        By its plain terms, the statute prohibits the\n\f                                                                                           -72-\n\npossession of 100 grams or more of cocaine.” Id., ¶ 20. The Court concluded that “in\n\nprosecuting cocaine-possession offenses under R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)(b) through (f)\n\ninvolving mixed substances, the state must prove that the weight of the actual cocaine,\n\nexcluding the weight of any filler materials, meets the statutory threshold.” Id., ¶ 22.\n\n       {¶ 113} Terrell asserts that Gonzales I applies retroactively, and that it applies both\n\nto cases involving possession of cocaine, and cases involving trafficking in cocaine. He\n\nasserts that Gonzales I “requires the State to prove that the amount of pure cocaine\n\ninvolved in an alleged first degree felony offense for trafficking in or possession of cocaine\n\nis at twenty-seven grams,” and that the “State presented no evidence regarding the purity\n\nof the cocaine, or the amount of pure cocaine.” Finally, he asserts that the trial court’s\n\n“failure to instruct the jury that the State must prove the amount of pure cocaine, excluding\n\nfillers, involved in Appellant’s alleged offenses constitutes plain error.” The State\n\nresponds that Gonzales I does not apply retroactively.\n\n       {¶ 114} On March 7, 2017, the State filed a “Notice of Additional Authority,”\n\ndirecting this Court’s attention to State v. Gonzales, Ohio Supreme Court Slip Opinion\n\nNo. 2017-Ohio-777 (“Gonzales II”), in which the Supreme Court reconsidered its decision\n\nin Gonzalez I on the State’s motion. The Court noted that “[r]ead as a whole, the plain\n\nlanguage of R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)(b) through (f) penalizes an offender for the amount of\n\ncocaine possessed, and the amount of ‘cocaine’ clearly encompasses the whole\n\ncompound or preparation of cocaine, including fillers that are part of the usable drug.”\n\nId., ¶ 9. The Court further noted that pursuant to R.C. 2925.01(X)(3), the “statutory\n\ndefinition of ‘cocaine’ includes a ‘salt, compound, derivative, or preparation’ of a\n\nsubstance that is cocaine salt or base cocaine,” and that “the statutory definition of\n\f                                                                                             -73-\n\ncocaine plainly encompasses a compound or preparation that includes cocaine.” Id., ¶\n\n10. The Court defined “compound” as “ ‘something (as a substance * * *) that is formed\n\nby a union of * * * ingredients.’ Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 466 (1986).”\n\nId. The Court concluded that “this is consistent with the nature of the cocaine used illegally\n\nin the United States, which is a compound of several ingredients.” Id., ¶ 11.\n\n       {¶ 115} It was significant to the Court that “the fillers, or adulterants, that are part\n\nof powder cocaine are not intended to be removed before consumption. Indeed, the\n\nfillers are an inherent part of powder cocaine.” Id., ¶ 12. The Court noted that “the\n\ncommon usage of the term ‘cocaine’ is consistent with the statutory definition that a\n\ncompound or preparation of cocaine is still cocaine,” and the Court concluded that “the\n\ntotal weight of the drug, including any fillers that are part of usable cocaine, should be\n\nweighed to determine the appropriate cocaine-possession penalty under the statute.” Id.\n\nAccording to the Court, the “statute is unambiguous,” and “[i]f the General Assembly had\n\nbeen concerned about purity, rather than total weight, it would have said so.” Id., ¶ 13-14.\n\nThe Court concluded that “the applicable offense level for cocaine possession under R.C.\n\n2925.11(C)(4) is determined by the total weight of the drug involved, including any fillers\n\nthat are part of the usable drug.” Id., ¶ 18.\n\n       {¶ 116} Based upon the Supreme Court’s decision in Gonzales II, we conclude\n\nthat Terrell’s supplemental assignments of error lack merit. In other words, Terrell’s\n\nconvictions are supported by sufficient evidence and not against the manifest weight of\n\nthe evidence, the trial court did not commit plain error in failing to instruct the jury that the\n\nState was required to prove that the amount of pure cocaine, excluding fillers, at issue in\n\nTerrell’s offenses was at least 27 grams, and Terrell’s sentence does not constitute plain\n\f                                                                                         -74-\n\n\nerror, since his 11-year sentence for a first degree felony is within the statutory range of\n\nR.C. 2929.14(A)(1).     Terrell’s supplemental assignments of error are accordingly\n\noverruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      .............\n\nFROELICH, J. and WELBAUM, J., concur.\n\nCopies mailed to:\n\nMegan M.

Terrell appeals from his April 27, 2016 judgment entry of conviction,\n\nfollowing a jury trial on one count of trafficking in cocaine, a felony of the first degree, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2925.03(A)(2), as set forth in count one of the indictment; possession of\n\f                                                                                          -2-\n\n\ncocaine, a felony of the first degree, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A), as set forth in count\n\ntwo of the indictment; and aggravated possession of drugs, a felony of the fifth degree, in\n\nviolation of R.C. 2925.11, as set forth in count three of the indictment. The indictment\n\nalso contained a forfeiture specification as to counts one through three.         The court\n\nmerged counts one and two and the State elected to proceed to disposition on count one.\n\nThe court sentenced Terrell to 11 years for trafficking in cocaine and one year for\n\naggravated possession of drugs, to be served consecutively.\n\n       {¶ 2} Terrell was indicted on May 26, 2015, and he filed a motion to suppress on\n\nAugust 6, 2015. The events surrounding Terrell’s arrest occurred at the Marriott Hotel in\n\nSpringfield, and in his motion to suppress, Terrell asserted that the arresting officers’\n\nencounter with him there was without reasonable, articulable suspicion, that Terrell’s\n\nconsent to the search of his person was involuntary, that the search warrant the officers\n\nobtained for Terrell’s hotel room was not supported by probable cause, and that Terrell\n\nhad an expectation of privacy in his hotel room. The motion was set for a hearing on\n\nAugust 21, 2015, and on August 11, 2015, Terrell moved for an extension of time. The\n\nhearing was rescheduled for October 2, 2015.\n\n       {¶ 3} On that date, William McMahan testified that he previously worked as a\n\ncontract security guard for Elite Investigation and Security Group, and that he was so\n\nemployed on March 31, April 1, 2015. He testified that he was assigned to the Marriott\n\nHotel in Springfield at the time, having worked there for approximately five months.\n\nMcMahan stated that he was assigned to the third shift, from 11:00 p.m. until 7:00 a.m.\n\nHe stated that he was familiar with a typical evening at the hotel. The following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\f                                                                                       -3-\n\n\n             Q. * * * And going to the evening of March 31st and the morning of\n\n      April 1st, did you see something that led you to call the police department\n\n      that evening?\n\n             A. I did.\n\n             Q. Just tell us everything that was going on that led up to you\n\n      making the decision to call the police department that evening?\n\n             A. I noticed some activity in the parking lot, a couple of different\n\n      people showing up, and then they would meet with the person in the van,\n\n      leave, and then he would leave and come back a few minutes later, go up\n\n      to his room, come back down, and leave again, come back, go up. It\n\n      became repetitious.\n\n             It had happened one time prior before. I really didn’t pay that much\n\n      attention to it at that time. This time it became a little more apparent.\n\n             Q. And the time prior before, are you talking about a different day\n\n      altogether?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. And was that involving the same person?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. And was that person a guest in the hotel?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\nMcMahan identified Terrell as the person he observed.\n\n      {¶ 4} When asked if Terrell’s behavior was unusual for the parking lot of the hotel,\n\nMcMahan responded, “Absolutely.” He testified, “To me, it looked like a meet, maybe\n\f                                                                                          -4-\n\n\nthey were meeting up to either collect or supply with drugs, I’m assuming. The first time,\n\n* * * the same vehicle had showed up prior to him coming down from his room, and then\n\nthis time that vehicle had showed up, as well. So I just had to assume that there was\n\nsomething going on.” McMahan stated that it is not common for him to contact the police\n\nin the course of his shift, and that the “main reason that I called was the odor of marijuana\n\nwhen I walked by the van.”\n\n       {¶ 5} McMahan stated that the police arrived at the scene at approximately 2:30\n\na.m., and that he was in the parking lot at the time. The following exchange occurred:\n\n              Q. And at some point, are you there when the Defendant, Andre\n\n       Terrell, is out of his vehicle and next to a police vehicle and they’re talking\n\n       to him?\n\n              A. Yes. Actually, when the police arrived, I stayed in my vehicle\n\n       for, approximately, a minute just to make note of what time they,\n\n       approximately, showed up. And then I got out and went over and stood\n\n       closer to the police vehicle just to hear what was going on.\n\n              Q. * * * And what, did you observe the interaction between the officer\n\n       and the Defendant? Was the officer patting him down or what was going\n\n       on?\n\n              A. It was questioning while he was in the van at first, and then from\n\n       what I witnessed, it was the odor of what was coming out of the van that got\n\n       him out of the van.    Then it seemed to be the normal questions, do you\n\n       have anything on you?\n\n              Q. Did you hear the officer ask Mr. Terrell if he could search his\n\f                                                                                       -5-\n\n\n       person?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\n              Q. What was Mr. Terrell’s response?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\n              Q. Did you also, you knew that Mr. Terrell was a guest in the hotel;\n\n       is that correct?\n\n              A. I did.\n\n              Q. And did you provide the police with information about what [sic],\n\n       where he was staying at that time?\n\n              A. From what the front desk had told me, yes.\n\n       {¶ 6} When asked on cross-examination to describe Terrell’s comings and goings\n\non the night of his arrest, McMahan testified as follows:\n\n              Normally about, it seemed it was around midnight that he had come\n\n       down. There was a vehicle that pulled in to meet with him. It was a dark\n\n       blue Tahoe, I believe. I didn’t really get to see what was going on as far as\n\n       that goes, but when he did leave, he would leave for roughly 20 minutes\n\n       and then come back, go up to the room for five, ten minutes, come back\n\n       down, and leave, that was after that person had already left.\n\nMcMahan testified that he observed this sequence of events four times.          McMahan\n\nstated that smoking is not allowed in the hotel, and that it was common for him to observe\n\nguests smoking outside the hotel, as well as in their cars when it was cold outside.\n\n       {¶ 7} Officer Jared Osborne testified that he is employed by the Springfield Police\n\nDepartment, and that he conducts uniformed patrol, having been so employed for over\n\f                                                                                       -6-\n\n\nseven years. Osborne testified that he was dispatched to the Springfield Marriott on April\n\n1, 2015, at approximately 2:30 a.m. Osborne stated that there “was a drug complaint\n\ncalled in by staff at the Marriott that was relaying information for a security guard that\n\nworked there, including specific information about the identity of a vehicle that was\n\ninvolved.” The following exchange occurred:\n\n             Q. And tell me what happens when you arrive on scene.\n\n             A. I locate the vehicle that they had dispatched us out there to\n\n      check. It was a white Dodge Grand Caravan. When I got into the parking\n\n      lot, I immediately picked out the van. When I pulled up to it, I observed a\n\n      male getting out of the passenger seat. I went up to the male, identified\n\n      him as Aaron Minter, and as the door was opened, I could smell a very\n\n      strong odor of raw, burnt marijuana coming from the car, or from the van.\n\n      I just began asking Mr. Minter simple questions about what he was doing\n\n      there, how long they had been there, and he didn’t really want to answer a\n\n      whole lot.\n\n             But he, ultimately, told me that he was there to visit Mr. Terrell. He\n\n      was friends with him. The van is, kind of, tall. I had another officer that\n\n      was there who was speaking with Mr. Terrell on the other side of the van,\n\n      and I told him that I had smelled marijuana and was going to search the\n\n      van.\n\n             Upon searching the van, I found a bag with, it had a plastic container\n\n      in it, contained scissors, and some M&M packages containing small bags\n\n      of marijuana. At some point during this search, I heard over my portable\n\f                                                                                -7-\n\n\nradio that Officer McCarty had detained Mr. Terrell.\n\n       I wondered what was going on. I didn’t see this but I had stopped\n\nwhat I was doing, and he was placing Mr. Terrell in the back of the cruiser.\n\nAnd he had showed me what appeared to be, I initially thought it might be\n\nmethamphetamine or some type of designer drug that was inside a clear\n\nbaggy [sic] that he had got from Mr. Terrell’s right front pocket.\n\n       Q.   At that point in time, did Officer McCarty contact Detective\n\nMitchell on how to proceed from there?\n\n       A. Correct.\n\n       Q. And while he was doing that, did you speak briefly to Mr. Terrell?\n\n       A. I did.\n\n       Q. And what did you tell him?\n\n       A. I read Mr. Terrell his Miranda Rights. He nodded, stated that he\n\nunderstood. He initially told me that, I also heard him say that he was there\n\nin Room 615, and he had told me that he was there to visit a female that\n\nwas at the hotel.\n\n       When I started asking who the female was and how he gets ahold of\n\nher, he didn’t want to tell me, and I remember also asking him if we were\n\nable to get ahold of this female, would she give us consent to search the\n\nroom that she was in. And he said that he didn’t want to get her in trouble,\n\nand, at that point, he didn’t want to answer any more questions.\n\n       Q. * * * Did that all occur while he was in the back of the cruiser?\n\n       A. Correct.\n\f                                                                                        -8-\n\n\n              Q. Were you involved in the search of his person at all?\n\n              A. No.\n\n              Q. And Officer McCarty had the primary interaction with Mr. Terrell\n\n       at the scene up until that point?\n\n              A. Correct.\n\n       {¶ 8} Osborne testified that after Detective Mitchell responded to the hotel and\n\nspoke to the officers on the scene, Mitchell left to obtain a search warrant. The following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n              Q. Prior to that time, were you instructed to go secure Room 623 at\n\n       the hotel?\n\n              A.    I   was.    After   we   had   found   the   suspected    meth-\n\n       amphetamine/designer drug, after calling Detective Mitchell I went up to the\n\n       room, initially checked it for people. That’s it. Left the room and stayed\n\n       there until the search warrant was brought up.\n\n              Q. Did the hotel give you access to the room or did you have to force\n\n       entry by breaking the door?\n\n              A. No. They gave us a key card to the room to gain access.\n\n              Q. Was anybody in the room?\n\n              A. No.\n\n              Q. Did you search through any of the areas in the room or were you\n\n       just looking for people to make sure that nobody was able to destroy\n\n       anything?\n\n              A. I was just looking for people. I didn’t open anything or touch\n\f                                                                                      -9-\n\n\n      anything.\n\n      {¶ 9} On cross-examination, Osborne testified that Minter was exiting the front\n\npassenger seat of Terrell’s van as Osborne pulled up to the vehicle. Osborne stated that\n\nhe believed the vehicle was a rental. He stated that he did not ask permission to search\n\nthe van. At the time, he testified that McCarty was on the driver’s side of the van.\n\nOsborne stated that he could hear McCarty and Terrell talking on the other side of the\n\nvan, but he could not make out what they were saying. Osborne stated that he did not\n\nhear Terrell consent to a search of his person.\n\n      {¶ 10} According to Osborne, Terrell’s room was on the sixth floor. When asked\n\nwhy he proceeded to the room, Osborne responded, “To, basically do a sweep of the\n\nroom to make sure that there was nobody inside of it and exit the room. After that, just\n\nstayed there so nobody could gain access to the room while they were in the process of\n\nobtaining the search warrant.” The following exchange occurred:\n\n             Q. Did you have any reason to believe there were other people in\n\n      the room?\n\n             A. I didn’t know, and that’s why I done that.\n\n             Q. But nobody had ever said that there were other people in the\n\n      room; is that correct?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             Q. And were you, did you have any reason to believe that any\n\n      crimes were being committed in the room at that point?\n\n             A. There was, I believe, personally believe that there was some\n\n      type of drug activity going on in there because the Caravan smelled like\n\f                                                                               -10-\n\n\nmarijuana. Mr. Terrell and Mr. Minter are both career criminals for being\n\ndrug dealers. There was a security guard telling us that he thought there\n\nwas drug activity going on between the two of them with contraband. I\n\nbelieved that there was some type of trafficking going on inside the room.\n\n       Q. * * * And the specific room, could you smell marijuana emitting\n\nfrom the hotel room?\n\n       A. No. I couldn’t smell marijuana coming from the room.\n\n***\n\n       Q. And why did you, I guess, classify Mr. Minter and Mr. Terrell as\n\ncareer criminals. How do you qualify that?\n\n       A. That’s just something that we identify certain people with in our\n\ndepartment with their prior activity.\n\n       Q. * * * And when you say prior activity, what do you mean\n\nspecifically?\n\n       A. If he’s been arrested for possession, dealing drugs before.   It’s\n\njust something that our dispatcher would notify us of when we were, if we\n\nwere to go out and run somebody’s name and check them for warrant.\n\n       Q. What did you hear from outside of Mr. Terrell’s room, Room\n\n623? Could you hear any noises coming from inside the room?\n\n       A. No.\n\n       Q. So you had no reason to believe somebody inside was in need\n\nof assistance or anything like that; is that correct?\n\n       A. That’s correct.\n\f                                                                                      -11-\n\n\n              Q. Did you suspect that there were armed individuals in the room\n\n       for any reason?\n\n              A. No.\n\n              Q. So I guess to go back to your previous testimony, your intention\n\n       was to go in the room and do what?\n\n              A. Just make sure there was nobody inside of the room to destroy\n\n       anything that would be inside.\n\n              ***\n\n              Q. * * * And how long were you in Room 623 at this point?\n\n              A. I would say I was in there less than 10 seconds.\n\n              Q. And how much prior in time to the search warrant coming did\n\n       you enter Mr. Terrell’s room?\n\n              A. It was a couple hours. I don’t recall exactly how long it was.\n\n       {¶ 11} Detective Gerald Mitchell testified that he is assigned to the intelligence\n\nunit, which is commonly referred to as the drug unit, in the Springfield Police Division,\n\nhaving been so employed for over three years. He testified that on April1, 2015, at about\n\n3:00 a.m., he received a phone call from McCarty about suspected drug activity at the\n\nSpringfield Marriott.    He stated that he learned that the officers had recovered “a\n\nsubstance that they believed was meth, as well as some marijuana.”         According to\n\nMitchell, there “had been some disagreement between, or difference between what room\n\n[Terrell] said he was in and what room the hotel said he was actually in, and I asked\n\nOfficer McCarty to inform Mr. Terrell of his rights and ask him, again, what room he was\n\nin and if he would give consent to search that room.” Mitchell testified that he then\n\f                                                                                       -12-\n\n\nreceived a return call from McCarty advising him that “Officer Osborne had informed and\n\nasked [Terrell] what room he was in. Ultimately, he said he was not a guest at the hotel,\n\nthat he was meeting a female in Room 615.”\n\n      {¶ 12} Mitchell stated that he later responded to the hotel, and the following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n             Q. * * * What did you do when you got on scene?\n\n             A. First thing I did was I spoke with Officer McCarty, took some\n\n      photographs of the evidence that he had collected, and, at that point, I\n\n      believe I searched the van. My primary goal was to find the hotel key, hotel\n\n      key for 623.\n\n             Q. So you had been informed that there was a room key at some\n\n      point and you were looking to see if you could find it in the van?\n\n             A. Yes. Officer McCarty advised that upon initial contact with Mr.\n\n      Terrell, Mr. Terrell showed him a room key that said Marriott on it, and after\n\n      he had arrested him, he could not find that same key.\n\n             Q. Did he also show you the items that were found in Mr. Terrell’s\n\n      pockets?\n\n             A. He did.\n\n             Q. Describe those items for me.\n\n             A.      There was a crystalline substance, and there was some\n\n      marijuana. I don’t recall whether that was from his pockets or from the\n\n      vehicle. There was a notepad or notebook with what appeared to be dollar\n\n      amounts written on it and some names.\n\f                                                                                        -13-\n\n\n             Q. And did you attempt to conduct what is commonly called a field\n\n      test on the crystalline substance?\n\n             A. I did.\n\n             Q. And what were the results of that?\n\n             A. The results indicated the presence of either amphetamines or\n\n      analogues of MDMA.\n\n             Q. And the notebook that was in his pocket, was one of the names\n\n      written on there Ills, I-L-L-S?\n\n             A. I don’t recall how it was spelled, but it was Ills, yes.\n\n             Q. Do you know a person who goes by the name of ILLS in the city\n\n      of Springfield?\n\n             A. I do.\n\n             Q. And who is that?\n\n             A. Aaron Minter.\n\n      {¶ 13} Mitchell stated that he was aware that Terrell had been advised of his rights,\n\nand that he spoke to Terrell in the back of the cruiser and asked if he would consent to a\n\nsearch of his room. According to Mitchell, Terrell advised him that he wanted to speak\n\nto his attorney. He testified that Terrell did not appear to be intoxicated. The following\n\nexchange occurred:\n\n             Q. You then sought to get a search warrant for hotel room 623,\n\n      correct?\n\n             A. Right.\n\n             Q. And prior to that, knowing that you were intending to do so, about\n\f                                                                                        -14-\n\n\n      how long would that have taken or how long did it take to get the search\n\n      warrant from that time until it was actually signed? * * *\n\n             A. I remember getting to the hotel around 4:00 a.m. I believe we\n\n      executed the search warrant after 9:00 a.m., so we would have had the\n\n      search warrant signed sometime between 8:00 and 9:00 after a judge would\n\n      have arrived at work.\n\n             Q. And because of that long period of time, were you interested in\n\n      securing the hotel room?\n\n               ***\n\n               A. Yes.\n\n             Q. And did you enter the room and secure it so that nothing could\n\n      leave before the search warrant was obtained?\n\n               A. I did not. Sergeant Bennett did.\n\n             Q. But you were aware that that had taken place?\n\n             A. I was aware, yes.\n\nOn cross-examination, Mitchell stated that he did not find a room key in the van in the\n\ncourse of his search.\n\n      {¶ 14} Officer Tyler McCarty testified that he has been a police officer with the\n\nCity of Springfield for over six years. He stated that on April 1, 2015, he was dispatched\n\nto the Springfield Marriott, and that the “call was there was a white van parked on the lot\n\nwith two occupants. They looked suspicious. They kept going in and out of the hotel to\n\nthe van, and the caller thought it might have been drug activity.” The following exchange\n\noccurred:\n\f                                                                                 -15-\n\n\n       Q. * * * Tell us what happens when you arrive on scene. What do\n\nyou see?\n\n       A. I pulled in right after my partner, Officer Osborne. He was the\n\nfirst one to pull up to the van, located him right away. As I was pulling up\n\nbehind him, I saw a driver getting out, and there was a passenger getting\n\nout on the passenger front side.\n\n       Officer Osborne went up to the passenger side. I went up to the\n\ndriver’s side. As I was coming up to the driver’s side, I made contact with\n\nMr. Terrell. He already had his door shut, and I just started talking to him.\n\n       ***\n\n       Q. Do you recall your conversation?\n\n       A. As soon as I started walking up to Mr. Terrell and talking to him,\n\nhe told me that he was [a] guest at the hotel. He told me he was staying\n\nthere. There was a security guard for the hotel sitting in his car in the lot,\n\nand he started pointing to the security guard saying, he knows I’m staying\n\nhere. He’s seen me in and out the past few days.\n\n       Q. Did he show you a room key of some kind, as well?\n\n       A. He did.\n\n       Q. And do you recall what room he told you he was staying in?\n\n       A. I believe he said 615.\n\n       Q. And around that time, did Officer Osborne inform you he was\n\ngoing to search the vehicle?\n\n       A.    Yes.   Officer Osborne told me he could smell the odor of\n\f                                                                                         -16-\n\n\n       marijuana coming from the vehicle and that he was going to search it.\n\n              Q. And what did you do with Mr. Terrell at that time?\n\n              A.   I asked Mr. Terrell if I could check to make sure if he had\n\n       anything on him, any weapons, or drugs or anything of that nature. He said\n\n       he didn’t. I asked if he minded if I searched him. He said he didn’t. I\n\n       asked Mr. Terrell if he actually minded if I checked inside his pockets. He\n\n       said he did not. And the security guard was standing next to me the whole\n\n       time that went on.\n\n              Q. And was Mr. Terrell in handcuffs at that point in time?\n\n              A. No, sir.\n\n              Q. And then you checked his pockets after he gave you permission\n\n       to do so?\n\n              A. Yes.\n\n              Q. Did you find anything inside?\n\n              A. I found a small M&Ms bottle with a small plastic baggy [sic] of\n\n       marijuana, and then the smaller right pocket I found a bag of a rocklike\n\n       substance that we were not sure what it was at that time.\n\nMcCarty stated that Terrell did not make any statements about the substance, and that\n\nMcCarty did not ask any questions about it.\n\n       {¶ 15} McCarty stated that the “security guard had came back out after going\n\ninside and checking the rooms, and he told us that, I think it was Room 623 that Mr. Terrell\n\nwas actually staying in.” The following exchange occurred regarding the search of Room\n\n623:\n\f                                                                                    -17-\n\n\n             Q. And at some point did you actually enter the room to make sure\n\n      nobody was inside?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. How did that actually happen? * * *\n\n             A. We were told just to secure the room. If we heard anybody in\n\n      there or thought anybody was in there, you know, just briefly walk through\n\n      and check for people, not anything else. We stood out of the room for\n\n      about a minute, a couple of minutes or so, approximately.\n\n             And we could hear what we thought was people talking inside so we\n\n      knocked on the door several times and asked people to come out. Nobody\n\n      was answering, nobody was responding, then we entered the room, briefly\n\n      walked through to make sure there was no people in there, and it was\n\n      actually, the TV was on and the volume was down kind of low.\n\n             Q. And did you leave the room and wait until a search warrant had\n\n      actually been obtained before any further searching occurred?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n      {¶ 16} On cross-examination, McCarty was shown a copy of an “inner office”\n\ncompleted by him on April 1, 2015, and he was given an opportunity to read it over. The\n\nfollowing exchange occurred:\n\n             Q. * * * So in the report, what did you say Mr. Terrell, what his\n\n      response was to whether or not you could search him?\n\n             A. I then asked Mr. Terrell if he had anything illegal on his person\n\n      and he replied that he did not. I asked Mr. Terrell if I could check his\n\f                                                                                      -18-\n\n\n      pockets, and he stated that he did not care. I then asked Mr. Terrell if I\n\n      could reach into his pockets to check them, and, again, he replied that he\n\n      did not care.\n\n               Q. Did you take, I don’t care, as an affirmative response that you\n\n      could?\n\n               A. Yes.\n\n               Q. Officer, was this a weapons pat down?\n\n               A. Just was pat down for anything illegal. So I asked if I could\n\n      search him before I even patted him down or looked into his pockets.\n\n               Q. So this was a search for illegal contraband?\n\n               A. Yes.\n\n               Q. And what was the cause for this search for illegal contraband\n\n      again?\n\n               A. Officer Osborne smelling marijuana coming from the vehicle.\n\nMcCarty stated that Terrell was not under arrest at the time of the pat down, but that he\n\nwas being detained based upon the odor of marijuana from the van.\n\n      {¶ 17} The following exchange occurred regarding Room 623:\n\n               Q. And you rode up the elevator how many floors?\n\n               A. Six.\n\n               Q. And did you believe that, and what was the intent of going into\n\n      the room at that point?\n\n               A. Just to secure it.\n\n               Q. And, well, secure it from what?\n\f                                                                                 -19-\n\n\n         A. Make sure there was nobody in there that could destroy any\n\npossible evidence before we could search it.\n\n         Q. And did you have any reason to believe there was anyone in\n\nthere?\n\n         A. Yes.\n\n         Q. And what was that?\n\n         A. Mr. Terrell said, at some point, he was with some female in the\n\nroom.\n\n         ***\n\n         Q. How long were you in the room?\n\n         A. Maybe a minute or less.\n\n         ***\n\n         Q. And what did you do when you entered the room? Can you just\n\nwalk us through that?\n\n         A.    I entered the room, I believe, to the right.    There was a\n\nbathroom. You just kept going, and there was a couple beds and then it\n\ndead-ended into the wall. So just walk straight and looked in between the\n\nbeds and the bed and wall, came back out, and I believe somebody just\n\nwalked in the bathroom and checked in the shower to make sure nobody\n\nwas in there and we left.\n\n         Q. * * * And how many people were in the room with you at this point?\n\n         A. I can’t remember.\n\n         ***\n\f                                                                                      -20-\n\n\n             Q.   Did you notice anybody opening drawers or looking in any\n\n      cabinets or - -\n\n             A. No.\n\n             Q. * * * If you were searching for people, did you knock on the door\n\n      prior to entering the room?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. Did you receive any response from inside?\n\n             A. No.\n\n             Q. Why did you, at that point, not, I guess, just stand guard at the\n\n      door? Why did you feel the need to enter the room?\n\n             A. Because we could hear voices inside, very faint voices, so we\n\n      thought maybe somebody was inside.\n\n             Q. And those voices were emitting from the television set; is that\n\n      correct?\n\n             A. Yes.\n\n             Q. So when you opened the door and saw that the television set\n\n      was on, I guess why, at that point, did you feel it necessary to continue to\n\n      search the room?\n\n             A. Because we were making sure that that was the only thing they\n\n      were coming from was the TV.\n\n      {¶ 18} On recross-examination, the following exchange occurred regarding the pat\n\ndown search of Terrell: “Q. * * * After testimony and you reading your report again, did\n\nMr. Terrell at any point give an affirmative yes to the question whether or not you could\n\f                                                                                         -21-\n\n\nsearch him? A. No. He didn’t give an affirmative no either.”\n\n       {¶ 19} At the conclusion of the hearing, the following exchange occurred:\n\n              MR. PICEK: The State would have no further witnesses. We would\n\n       have the search warrant, which has been marked as State’s Exhibit No.1.\n\n       Your Honor signed that search warrant. At least, my understanding is, at\n\n       least, that portion of the motion to suppress should go to another judge to\n\n       rule on.\n\n              They’re [sic] challenged to whether the search warrant should have\n\n       been issued. * * *\n\n              THE COURT: * * *With respect to the search warrant, whether or\n\n       not that should have been issued, certainly I’ll recuse myself from that\n\n       portion of the motion and refer that to the administrative judge who will most\n\n       likely assign that to Judge O’Neill to review. * * *.”\n\n       {¶ 20} On October 5, 2015, the trial court issued an Entry that provides, “* * * the\n\nCourt finds that a portion of the subject of the defendant’s motion is a search warrant that\n\nthis judge signed. THEREFORE, this case is TRANSFERRED to the Administrative\n\nJudge * * * to assign to another judge for the limited purpose of hearing the portion of\n\ndefendant’s motion to suppress that deals with the search warrant. * * * .”\n\n       {¶ 21} On October 13, 2015, the “State of Ohio’s Closing Argument for\n\nSuppression Hearing” was filed. The State asserted that the arresting officers had a\n\nreasonable suspicion to detain Terrell, that he consented to a search of his person, and\n\nthat the search of his vehicle was supported by probable cause. On October 16, 2015,\n\nTerrell filed “Defendant’s Brief in Support of Suppression.” On October 27, 2015, the\n\f                                                                                        -22-\n\n\ncourt issued an Entry that provides that “Defendant’s motion to suppress is OVERRULED\n\nfor the reasons set forth in State’s written closing argument.” Terrell filed a Notice of\n\nAppeal of the trial court’s decision, which this Court dismissed on the State’s motion to\n\ndismiss for lack of a final appealable order.\n\n       {¶ 22} On November 9, 2015, a hearing was held on the remaining portion of\n\nTerrell’s motion to suppress before the newly assigned judge. The following exchange\n\noccurred at the start of the hearing:\n\n              MR. PICEK: A hearing was held before Judge Rastatter, regarding\n\n       the parts of the motion that do not deal with the search warrant. Mainly,\n\n       regarding an encounter with the Defendant and law enforcement that was\n\n       in the parking lot of a hotel and the search of his person, at that time. That\n\n       has been ruled on in the State’s favor. The only issues remaining were the\n\n       Defendant’s motion to suppress are what, I believe, [sic] are under\n\n       subsections F and G, regarding the search warrant.         It’s beginning on\n\n       page, 13, I believe, of the Defendant’s motion.\n\n              THE COURT: Section F says, the search warrant that was created\n\n       by Detective Mitchell was defective. And G says that the Defendant has\n\n       an expectation of privacy at the hotel room and that the search of the hotel\n\n       room was unconstitutional. Those are the two parts of the motion to be\n\n       presented, the argument before the court today.\n\n       {¶ 23} A copy of the search warrant for room 623 at the Marriott was marked as\n\nan exhibit, along with an accompanying affidavit. The State indicated that, “[r]egarding\n\nwhether the Defendant has [an] expectation of privacy in his hotel room, this room was\n\f                                                                                          -23-\n\n\nchecked out under his name and it is, obviously, the State’s position that it is his room,\n\nso we’d agree. But, they had a search warrant.” The State noted that the “remainder\n\nof the challenge of the search warrant is solely regarding whether there was sufficient\n\nprobable cause.”\n\n       {¶ 24} After a discussion off the record, the court indicated its understanding that\n\nthe parties agreed to submit the matter to it based upon the exhibit and the written\n\narguments already submitted. The State indicated that this “is a review of whether or not\n\nthe issuing Magistrate had substantial basis on which to find probable cause. I don’t see\n\nany need to argue any further. The State believes that there is more than sufficient\n\nevidence contained in the affidavit for the Court to find probable cause.”\n\n       {¶ 25} The April 1, 2015 affidavit of Detective Gerrald Mitchell provides as follows:\n\n              * * * Detective Gerrald Mitchell, Jr. of the Springfield Police Division,\n\n       who being duly sworn according to law, deposes and says that on the 1st of\n\n       April, 2015, Hotel Room 623 at the Courtyard by Marriott located as 100 S.\n\n       Fountain Ave., Springfield, Clark County, Ohio, does contain certain\n\n       evidence of criminal acts, to wit: Heroin, cocaine, marihuana, controlled\n\n       substance analogs, drug paraphernalia, items used to transport, package,\n\n       or prepare drugs for sale, money, financial records of drug trafficking\n\n       activity, items showing an ownership or possessory interest in the residence\n\n       and any items located therein, instrumentalities and proceeds of drug\n\n       trafficking, firearms, cellular telephones (contact lists, text messages, call\n\n       history, photographs, videos, application data, location data, and other\n\n       documents and data) and any other evidence of trafficking or possession of\n\f                                                                                  -24-\n\n\ndrugs in violation of sections 2925.03 and 2925.11 of the Ohio Revised\n\nCode and Affiant further says that he believes, and has good cause to\n\nbelieve, that such things are concealed at the above described location.\n\n         The facts upon which Affiant bases said belief are:\n\n         1. Affiant, Detective Gerrald Mitchell Jr., is employed by the City of\n\nSpringfield Police Division and has been so since January of 2007. I have\n\nbeen assigned to the Springfield Police Intelligence Unit from May 2012 to\n\nthe present date. I have a Bachelor of Science Degree in Criminal Justice\n\nLeadership from Urbana University.        I have successfully completed the\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration’s Basic Narcotics Investigator course. I\n\nhave also received training to forensically extract data from mobile devices.\n\nMy certifications include Cellebrite Certified Logical Operator and Cellebrite\n\nCertified Physical Analyst.\n\n         2.   The Springfield Police Division has been investigating Andre\n\nTerrell (DOB 7/17/1978; * * *) for trafficking in drugs over the past several\n\nyears.\n\n         3. In 1998, Terrell was sentenced to 3 years in prison in Clark\n\nCounty Case 98-CR-0477 for possession of drugs (crack). In 2003, he was\n\nconvicted of possession of cocaine and sentenced to 3 years community\n\ncontrol.      In 2004, he was convicted of trafficking in drugs and again\n\nsentenced to 2 years of community control.\n\n         4. In July 2014, Sgt. Bennett and I met with a confidential source\n\n(CS #1261). CS # 1261 has provided information in the past about drug\n\f                                                                                 -25-\n\n\ntraffickers which has led to the issuance of a search warrant, seizure of\n\nsignificant amounts of illegal drugs, and convictions. CS #1261 stated that\n\nTerrell was still currently selling illegal drugs in the Springfield area,\n\nincluding cocaine, and provided a current phone number for Terrell.\n\n       5. I also spoke to a confidential source (CS #1251). CS #1251 in\n\nthe past has provided information that Terrell sells cocaine and heroin.\n\n       6. Within the past month, CS #1251 told me that Terrell was still\n\ncurrently selling heroin.\n\n       7. In February 2015, I contacted CS #1261 and CS #1251 to ask\n\nfor any current phone numbers for Terrell. CS #1251 provided the same\n\nphone number CS #1261 had previously provided in July of 2014, as well\n\nas a second, new number. CS #1261 provided me with the same second,\n\nnewer number as CS #1251.\n\n       8.    On April 1, 2015 at approximately 2:30 AM, Officers Tyler\n\nMcCarty and Jerod Osborne of the Springfield Police Division were\n\ndispatched to the Marriott Hotel at 100 S. Fountain Ave., Springfield, Clark\n\nCounty, Ohio, on report of two men in a white van in the parking lot, one of\n\nwhom had been recently staying in the hotel, and he was seen regularly\n\ngoing from the hotel back out to the car. The caller also stated that they\n\nbelieved there to be drug activity going on based on what they were\n\nobserving.\n\n       9. Officers arrived on scene shortly after being dispatched and\n\napproached a White Dodge Minivan with Illinois Plate P42-1003.             The\n\f                                                                                 -26-\n\n\npassenger, later identified as Aaron Minter, was getting out of the vehicle\n\nas Officer Osborne arrived.      Officer Osborne quickly approached the\n\nvehicle and noticed the odor of raw and burnt marijuana. Officer McCarty\n\nthen arrived as the driver, later identified as Andre Terrell was exiting the\n\nvehicle and shut the driver’s door. Terrell immediately stated that he was\n\na guest at the hotel, and pointed to a security guard, stating, “He’s seen me\n\nhere for the past few nights he can tell you.”\n\n       10. Officer McCarty asked Terrell if he had a key, which Terrell\n\nshowed to him. The key said “Marriott” on it. He then handed the key\n\nback to Terrell. Officer McCarty asked which room Terrell was in and he\n\nstated “615.” Officer Osborne indicated that he was going to search the\n\nvehicle based upon the plain smell of marijuana giving probable cause to\n\nsearch the vehicle.    Officer McCarty asked Terrell if he could check if\n\nTerrell had anything illegal on him, he said he did not care. Officer McCarty\n\nasked if he could actually go into Terrell’s pockets, again he said he did not\n\ncare. Officer McCarty located in his left pants pocket a cylindrical shaped\n\nM&Ms container which contained a small bag of marijuana. In his right\n\nwatch pocket he found a plastic bag containing what he thought may be\n\nmethamphetamine. Terrell was placed into handcuffs at that time. Officer\n\nMcCarty also located a notebook in his pocket, discussed below, which\n\ncontained a ledger.      Terrell was also in possession of two cellular\n\ntelephones.\n\n       11. Later, the suspected methamphetamine was field tested, and\n\f                                                                              -27-\n\n\nthe field test indicated the presence of either amphetamine or analogs of\n\nMDM (ecstasy).\n\n      12.    Inside the vehicle, Officer Osborne located another box\n\ncontaining additional M&Ms containers with marijuana inside. At that time,\n\nMinter was also placed in handcuffs and placed in a police vehicle. Officer\n\nMcCarty made contact with hotel staff and was advised that Terrell was\n\nactually staying in Room 623, and the room was currently booked in his\n\nname. Officer McCarty contacted me at that time for advice on how to\n\nproceed.\n\n      13. Officers then returned to speak to Terrell and Officer Osborne\n\nadvised him of his rights. Terrell was again asked what room he was in,\n\nand he again said 615. Officer Osborne then asked for consent to search\n\nthe room, and Terrell then said that he was actually not staying there, but\n\nwas supposed to meet some girl who has a room there, but she hadn’t\n\nshown up yet. When asked, Terrell stated he did not know the female’s\n\nname, or how to get ahold of her. He then stated he did not have a room at\n\nthe hotel, but that he previously was staying in Room 615.\n\n      14. The hotel provided me with copies of the invoices for Terrell’s\n\ncurrent and recent stays at the hotel. The records showed that Terrell\n\nstayed at the Courtyard by Marriott, 100 S. Fountain Ave., checking in at\n\n8:12 PM on March 25, and checking out at 1:20 PM on March 26, staying\n\nin Room 615. He then checked in again on March 31, 2015 at 10:32 PM,\n\nthis time staying in Room 623.\n\f                                                                                    -28-\n\n\n       15. I arrived on scene at approximately 4:00 AM. Officers showed\n\nme what they had found on Terrell’s person and I conducted the above\n\nmentioned field test. I located in Terrell’s wallet a key card for a Marriott\n\nhotel; however, hotel staff indicated that the key was not for the hotel at 100\n\nS. Fountain Ave. Officer McCarty also indicated that the key I found in the\n\nwallet was not the key that Terrell had shown him earlier. I also located in\n\nTerrell’s belongings the ledger that Officer McCarty had located in Terrell’s\n\npocket, with listed names of known drug traffickers in Springfield, with\n\ndifferent numbers, presumably dollar amounts listed next to their names,\n\nand with several lines crossed out, and the same name appearing multiple\n\ntimes. A photograph of a page of the ledger is attached hereto as Exhibit\n\nA. Of note are the lines reading “Juve 1000,” multiple lines with the name\n\n“Ills,” “Tylic – 290,” “Dew 1500”, “Sam”. “Juve” is a known nickname for\n\nJerrell Fleming, who is known to me to be a drug trafficker in Springfield.\n\n“Ills” is a known nickname for Aaron Minter, the passenger in the vehicle\n\nwith Terrell. “Tylic” is likely to be Tilic Beal, also a known drug trafficker in\n\nSpringfield. The numbers likely indicate dollar amounts possibly owed to\n\nTerrell for various types and amounts of illegal drugs.\n\n       16.   I then searched the van in which Terrell and Minter were\n\nlocated. My goal was to located [sic] the room key that Terrell had shown\n\nOfficer McCarty. I located some empty plastic bags in different places\n\ninside the van. I also located a box of freezer bags sitting on top of one of\n\nthe seats in the rear of the van. Under the dashboard area, I saw three\n\f                                                                                   -29-\n\n\ncoffee cups wrapped in plastic like the kind commonly found in hotel rooms.\n\nIn the far rear storage area of the van, there were multiple plastic grocery\n\nbags, and approximately 12-15 tennis balls. Most [of] the tennis balls had\n\nholes cut into the hollow interior, and at least one was cut further open. I\n\nopened up the tennis balls and found nothing inside them.             I located\n\nnothing else inside the van that could explain why the tennis balls were\n\npresent; however, I do believe that they could be a unique method of\n\ncovertly transporting illegal drugs. I did not locate the Marriott key card that\n\nTerrell showed Officer McCarty. The key card was not found on Terrell’s\n\nperson or in his belongings.\n\n       17. The security guard at the hotel provided further information.\n\nHe stated that the “large male,” referring to Aaron Minter, had arrived in the\n\nvehicle which was currently parked next to the van. That vehicle is\n\nregistered to another person with the last name Minter. He stated that on\n\nMarch 25, the same evening as Terrell’s previous stay at the hotel, he\n\nobserved suspicious behavior by Terrell in the parking lot of the hotel. He\n\nobserved Terrell meet with a Blue Tahoe in the parking lot, and Terrell and\n\nthe Blue Tahoe would repeatedly leave and return after about 20-30\n\nminutes, go up to the room, and also would sit in the vehicles in the parking\n\nlot for periods of time. Due to his suspicions, the security guard drove\n\nthrough the parking lot a few times, upon which Terrell approached him on\n\nfoot and said “So you know I’m a guest here, in case you were going to call\n\nthe cops.”\n\f                                                                                  -30-\n\n\n       18. The security guard described similar behavior on the night of\n\nMarch 31, again involving the same Blue Tahoe, as well as Aaron Minter\n\nand his vehicle. Again they went up to the room, then they would leave for\n\n30 minutes and come back, multiple times, and sit for around 20-30 minutes\n\nin the vehicles in the parking lot at night. This suspicious behavior led the\n\nsecurity guard to believe drug activity was occurring, which led him to\n\ncontact law enforcement.\n\n       19. Based upon all of the foregoing, including Terrell’s attempt to\n\nconceal that he had a hotel room, his inconsistent answers regarding the\n\nhotel room, his apparent attempt to hide or get rid of the key to Hotel Room\n\n623, the observations of the security guard at the hotel, the ledger in\n\nTerrell’s pocket, and all of my training and experience, I believe it is highly\n\nlikely that Hotel Room 623 at the Marriott at 100 S. Fountain Ave.,\n\nSpringfield, Clark County, Ohio, will contain illegal narcotics and other\n\nevidence and proceeds of trafficking in drugs by Andre Terrell.\n\n       20. The following assertions are all based upon affiant and other\n\ndetectives of the drug unit’s training and experience:\n\n              • drug traffickers commonly use multiple cellular telephones\n\n       to communicate with buyers and sellers of narcotics via text\n\n       messaging and telephone calls, and said cellular telephones will\n\n       often contain evidence of drug trafficking such as text messages,\n\n       telephone calls, photographs, call history, application data, and other\n\n       electronic documents;\n\f                                                                                         -31-\n\n\n                     • narcotics traffickers typically maintain on hand large\n\n              amounts of U.S. currency in order to maintain and finance their\n\n              ongoing narcotics business;\n\n                     • narcotics traffickers maintain books, records, receipts, notes,\n\n              ledgers, and other papers relating to the transportation, ordering,\n\n              sale and distribution of controlled substances;\n\n                     • drug traffickers commonly have in their possession, firearms\n\n              used to protect and secure their property, narcotics, and money.\n\n              Said Affiant further says that on or about April 1, 2015 Hotel Room\n\n       623 at the Courtyard by Marriott located at 100 S. Fountain Ave.,\n\n       Springfield, Clark County, Ohio, does possess and conceal said things, or\n\n       some part thereof, at the place described above, then and there well\n\n       knowing the same violates section 2925.03 and 2925.11 of the Ohio\n\n       Revised Code as aforesaid.\n\n       {¶ 26} In overruling the portion of Terrell’s motion addressed to the search warrant,\n\nthe court indicated as follows:\n\n              The Court finds that the affidavit accompanying the aforementioned\n\n       warrant contains sufficient indicia of probable cause to pass muster under\n\n       the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n\n              Upon being presented with the information contained in the affidavit,\n\n       a reasonably prudent person would believe that there is a fair probability\n\n       that the place to be searched contained evidence of a crime. Therefore,\n\n       the Court concludes that the issuing judge had a substantial basis for\n\f                                                                                         -32-\n\n\n       concluding that probable cause existed.\n\n       {¶ 27} We note that on May 6, 2016, in his “Request to File Transcript,” Terrell\n\nrequested the transcripts of the two-day jury trial and of disposition. On July 8, 2016, the\n\ntranscript from the November 9, 2015 suppression hearing was filed. On July 13, 2016,\n\nthe video deposition of Megan Snyder and the deposition transcript were filed, along with\n\nthe trial transcript. On July 27, 2016, Terrell filed a “Motion for Extension of Time Within\n\nWhich to File Appellant’s Brief,” asserting that “an extension is necessary due to the\n\nvoluminous nature of the transcript; the need to supplement the record with exhibits and\n\nsuppression transcripts; and counsel will need sufficient time to review all of the\n\ntranscripts, and finalize Appellant’s Merit Brief.” Appellant’s brief was filed on September\n\n1, 2016, pursuant to this Court’s order, and no request to supplement the record was\n\nreceived from Terrell.\n\n       {¶ 28} Terrell asserts four assignments of error herein. His first assignment of\n\nerror is as follows:\n\n              THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT’S\n\n       MOTION TO SUPPRESS WHEN THE AFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF THE\n\n       SEARCH WARRANT WAS FACIALLY DEFICIENT, OVERBROAD, AND\n\n       LACKED PROBABLE CAUSE.\n\n       {¶ 29} Terrell asserts that the “issuing judge improperly considered stale evidence\n\nprovided by Confidential Informants (‘CS’) in ruling that the search warrant contained\n\nsufficient probable cause. Further, the dated prior convictions of Appellant listed in the\n\naffidavit are stale and add no value to a probable cause determination.” Terrell asserts\n\nthat specifically, “paragraphs four through seven of Detective Mitchell’s affidavit contain\n\f                                                                                          -33-\n\n\nstale information obtained from confidential sources.” He asserts that the “affidavit also\n\nfails to demonstrate any evidence that Appellant was engaged in a continuing course of\n\ncriminal conduct.”\n\n       {¶ 30} Terrell argues further that in “addition to being stale, the information\n\nprovided by the confidential sources lacks any indicia of veracity, credibility, or basis of\n\nknowledge of the sources; and Detective Mitchell fails to demonstrate the sources[’]\n\nreliability through averment or corroboration.” According to Terrell, “statements from two\n\nconfidential sources and an unidentified caller allegedly from the Marriott Hotel were\n\nincluded in the affidavit by Detective Mitchell. All three of these sources allege facts\n\nwhich implicate Appellant in a crime, so the basis of their knowledge of the crime is called\n\ninto question.” Terrell argues that the “statements lack any degree of detail, do not\n\nindicate that they are based on the first-hand knowledge or personal observation of the\n\nsource, and lack reliability.”\n\n       {¶ 31} Regarding CS #1251, Terrell argues that based “on the information in the\n\naffidavit, it is impossible to determine if the CS was relating their own personal knowledge,\n\nor passing on a rumor they heard on the street. The complete lack of detail or indication\n\nof personal observation fails to demonstrate the source[’]s basis of knowledge, and\n\nprecludes a finding [of] probable cause.” Terrell asserts that the “affidavit contains no\n\naverment from the affiant as to the past reliability of CS #1251,” and that the “affidavit\n\nalso lacks police corroboration to potentially cure any defects in reliability,” such as “the\n\nuse of a controlled buy.”\n\n       {¶ 32} Regarding CS #1261, Terrell asserts that the information provided by him\n\nor her “is as devoid of specifics or indications of the source’s basis of such knowledge as\n\f                                                                                         -34-\n\n\nthat provided by CS #1251, but the affidavit does contain an averment to the reliability of\n\nCS #1261.” According to Terrell, however, “even where an affiant specifically avers to\n\nthe past reliability of a source, probable cause may not be found where an affidavit\n\ncontains no factual basis for a source’s knowledge.”\n\n       {¶ 33} Terrell asserts that State v. Dalpiaz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">257</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2002-Ohio-7346,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3717691\"><a href=\"/opinion/3967128/state-v-dalpiaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">783</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Dist.), is “strikingly similar” to the matter herein. He asserts as\n\nfollows:\n\n              The affidavit in the case at bar includes information from sources of\n\n       even more doubtful reliability, and provides significantly less specific\n\n       information than the informant in Dalpiaz.       The affiant states that the\n\n       Springfield Police Division has been investigating Appellant for trafficking in\n\n       drugs for several years. Affidavit, ¶ 2. Assuming this statement is true, the\n\n       most significant piece of evidence obtained by the Springfield Police over a\n\n       several year investigation is apparently that two confidential informants\n\n       provided the same alleged phone number for Appellant.             Considering\n\n       many lawful citizens who are not drug traffickers have phone numbers, that\n\n       two sources provided the same phone number for Appellant is useless in\n\n       demonstrating probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant; even if\n\n       the Springfield Police had verified that the number the sources provided\n\n       actually was Appellant’s.\n\n       {¶ 34} Terrell next argues that “Detective Mitchell intentionally, or with conscious\n\nindifference, presents several of his own inferences as empirical fact in the affidavit,”\n\nnamely “when he stated that the words in a notebook found in Appellant’s pocket were\n\f                                                                                          -35-\n\n\nthe nicknames of specific individuals, that those individuals were known drug traffickers,\n\nand that those drug traffickers were located in Springfield.” Terrell argues that Mitchell’s\n\nconclusion “that the numbers in the notebook indicate money specific individuals owed to\n\nAppellant for the sale of illegal drugs * * * involves an extremely complex and attenuated\n\nlogical leap.” Terrell asserts that “testimony given at trial indicates Detective Mitchell’s\n\ninclusion of undisclosed inferences as empirical fact in the affidavit were acts of\n\nmalfeasance or misfeasance.” Terrell argues that “Beau Collins, a Detective with the\n\nSpringfield drug unit since April, 2009, stated that he believes that the nickname Juve is\n\nassociated with a man named Jermaine Fleming, and Jerrell Fleming goes by the\n\nnickname ‘senior’. Trial Transcript, page 351, lines 18-19.”\n\n       {¶ 35} Terrell argues that “Detective Mitchell attached one page of the notebook\n\nto his affidavit, but omitted two others.”   He asserts that the “existence of these pages\n\nis never mentioned in the affidavit, nor were they submitted to the magistrate.” Terrell\n\nconcludes that the “omission of these pages, along with Detective Mitchell’s undisclosed\n\ninferences, deprived the magistrate of the opportunity to independently review the\n\nevidence and form his own inferences based upon the totality of the circumstances.”\n\n       {¶ 36} Terrell next asserts that the “affidavit in support of the search warrant\n\nsubmitted by Detective Mitchell contains no information indicating that Room 623 was\n\nbeing used by Appellant for drug trafficking.” Terrell asserts that the matter herein is\n\n“strikingly similar” to State v. Perez, 2015-Ohio-1753, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1010</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Dist.). Terrell\n\nargues that therein “this Court held that an individual’s possession of a significant quantity\n\nof drugs or other evidence of drug trafficking does not establish probable cause to search\n\ntheir home without some additional evidentiary link.” Terrell asserts as follows:\n\f                                                                                           -36-\n\n              * * * Unlike the defendant in Perez, Appellant was not found with any\n\n       large amount of drugs; no evidence of an investigation of Appellant at any\n\n       other location is included; no reliable informant provided any specific\n\n       information about illegal items in Appellant’s possession, the affidavit does\n\n       not indicate that any unusually large amount of cash was found on Appellant\n\n       when he was searched outside his van; and the affidavit does not even\n\n       allege that anyone witnessed Appellant actually selling drugs.\n\n              The sole evidence of Appellant’s actual activity inside the hotel is that\n\n       a security guard saw Appellant enter and exit the hotel a number of times;\n\n       and sit around in his vehicle for 20-30 minutes at a time, sometimes with a\n\n       guest. * * * Observed conduct that is consistent with innocent as well as\n\n       criminal activity creates, at best, a suspicion of illegal activity, and is not\n\n       sufficient to establish probable cause.\n\n       {¶ 37} Finally, Terrell asserts that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule\n\ndoes not apply herein. He argues that the “sheer number of deficiencies and the overt\n\nlack of probable cause make it clear that no reasonable police officer acting in good faith\n\ncould have relied on the warrant.”\n\n       {¶ 38} The State responds that “the search warrant explains the ongoing drug unit\n\ninvestigation that relate[s] to Appellant and his history of drug related activity.       This\n\nhistorical information is provided to explain why Appellant’s activity observed on the\n\nevening in question shows that he was engaging in drug trafficking and not simply going\n\nto his car to smoke.” The State argues that the “historical information about Appellant’s\n\ndrug activity is provided to give context to the action observed on the evening in question.”\n\f                                                                                         -37-\n\n\nThe State relies upon the testimony of the security guard at the suppression hearing of\n\nOctober 2, 2015.\n\n       {¶ 39} Regarding the confidential informants, the State asserts that “as to CS\n\n#1261, the affidavit does include information related to the reliability of that source in\n\nparagraph #4. The information from CS #1251 is used to corroborate the information\n\nprovided from CS #1261 and show the pattern of Appellant’s conduct related to drug\n\ntrafficking.” The State asserts that the “information from the confidential informants is\n\nnot used in the affidavit to show that he was trafficking in drugs on March 31, 2015 in\n\nparticular and therefore there is nothing in the record to suggest that the court improperly\n\nconsidered the historical evidence from the confidential informants.”\n\n       {¶ 40} The State further argues that Mitchell’s assertion in the affidavit that the\n\nledger retrieved from Terrell contained information about known drug dealers “is not an\n\ninappropriate inference to be made by a drug unit detective familiar with the known drug\n\ndealers in Springfield.” According to the State, “this Court cannot consider testimony from\n\ntrial when reviewing suppression rulings.”\n\n       {¶ 41} The State asserts that the matter herein is distinct from Perez, and that the\n\n“evidence presented to the judge in the search warrant does provide a sufficient nexus\n\nbetween Appellant’s trafficking activity and the hotel room.”       The State asserts that\n\n“certainly the officers executing the search warrant in this case acted in good faith as they\n\nwere conducting a search pursuant to a search warrant signed by a judge.”\n\n       {¶ 42} In Reply, Terrell asserts that the “state cannot create a continuing course of\n\nconduct by arguing that, because Appellant was convicted of a drug offense eleven years\n\nago, he must still be involved in drug trafficking.” He asserts that his prior conviction\n\f                                                                                       -38-\n\n\ndoes not support the warrant. He asserts that “the only information, other than a phone\n\nnumber allegedly belonging to Appellant, provided by CS #1261 was provided in July,\n\n2014. The State fails to address the staleness of this information, and then argues that\n\nunreliable information corroborates stale information.”\n\n      {¶ 43} Terrell asserts as follows:\n\n             * * * The affidavit allows a search of Appellant’s hotel room for\n\n      evidence of drug trafficking, specifically including cocaine and heroin. The\n\n      sole reference to either cocaine or heroin included in the affidavit stems\n\n      from the statements of Confidential Sources.         It is axiomatic that an\n\n      affidavit could not demonstrate probable cause to search for evidence of a\n\n      crime that the affidavit makes literally no reference to. Considering there\n\n      is no basis upon which the issuing magistrate could have relied in issuing a\n\n      search warrant for cocaine and heroin; it is clear that, contrary to the\n\n      assertion of the State, this historical information was improperly considered\n\n      by the court.\n\n             The state has admitted that the Confidential Source information was\n\n      not even intended to demonstrate that Appellant was trafficking in drugs on\n\n      the night in question. The State cannot show a sufficient nexus between\n\n      the alleged crimes of possession of cocaine and heroin, and the hotel room\n\n      in question, where the State admits that the only information in the affidavit\n\n      even referencing cocaine or heroin does not create, and was never intended\n\n      to create, such a nexus.\n\n      {¶ 44} Terrell asserts that “Detective Mitchell included undisclosed inferences\n\f                                                                                          -39-\n\n\nregarding his conclusions that the words in a ledger found on Appellant were nicknames\n\nof specific people” who were known drug dealers, and that the “State’s sole argument in\n\nresponse is that Detective Mitchell’s inference regarding allegedly known nicknames was\n\nnot an inappropriate inference.” Terrell further argues that none of the pages of the\n\nledger “contain any overt references to narcotics, and none of them include dollar signs\n\nor any other representation that the numerals are actual dollar amounts.” He asserts\n\nthat the inclusion of “only the page of notebook that supports his undisclosed inference\n\nhighlights his overt, and apparently successful, attempt to preclude the issuing magistrate\n\nfrom making his determination based upon a full and fair review of the totality of the\n\ncircumstances.”\n\n       {¶ 45} Terrell asserts that “there is absolutely no evidence connecting actual drug\n\nactivity to Appellant’s hotel room.” He asserts that there “was no large amount of cash\n\nor drugs found on Appellant, in his vehicle, on Mr. Minter, or in Mr. Minter’s vehicle; yet\n\nthe State claims the perfectly legal activity of walking in and out of a hotel multiple times\n\ndemonstrates a sufficient nexus to connect Appellant and his hotel room to drug\n\ntrafficking.” Terrell asserts that the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule should\n\nnot be applied.\n\n       {¶ 46} The Fourth Amendment provides that “no Warrants shall issue, but upon\n\nprobable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to\n\nbe searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” Crim.R. 41(C)(2) provides in part\n\nthat the “finding of probable cause may be based upon hearsay in whole or in part,\n\nprovided there is a substantial basis for believing the source of the hearsay to be credible\n\nand for believing that there is a factual basis for the information furnished.”\n\f                                                                                        -40-\n\n      {¶ 47} As noted by the Supreme Court of Ohio, in State v.

Montgomery No. 23582, 2010-Ohio-2389, ¶\n\n20.\n\n       {¶ 50} We conclude that, viewing the totality of the circumstances, the affidavit in\n\nsupport of the search warrant herein provided adequate probable cause for the issuance\n\nof the warrant. Regarding Terrell’s assertion that his prior convictions constitute stale\n\ninformation, we conclude that they provide background and context for the officers’\n\nongoing involvement in investigating Terrell, and bear some relevancy to Terrell’s conduct\n\nthat night.\n\n       {¶ 51} Regarding paragraphs four through seven of the affidavit, we note that\n\nMitchell attested to the veracity of CS #1261, noting that he or she “has provided\n\f                                                                                       -42-\n\n\ninformation in the past about drug traffickers which has led to the issuance of a search\n\nwarrant, seizure of significant amounts of illegal drugs, and convictions.” While Terrell\n\nasserts that the information regarding his phone numbers is stale, in February 2015, CS\n\n# 1251 corroborated the phone number provided by CS #1261 in July 2014, as well as\n\nan additional number that matched the second number also provided by CS #1261. Both\n\ninformants advised that Terrell was selling illegal drugs.\n\n       {¶ 52} Most significantly, Terrell ignores the events of the night of his arrest.\n\nOfficers McCarty and Osborne were dispatched to the hotel on a report of suspected drug\n\nactivity. Upon Osborne’s approach of Terrell’s vehicle, he smelled marijuana, and he\n\nretrieved marijuana and what he believed to be methamphetamine from Terrell’s person.\n\nMitchell also located a ledger, the contents of which, in his experience, were consistent\n\nwith drug trafficking, namely the names of known drug dealers next to what Mitchell\n\nbelieved were dollar amounts representing money owed to Terrell for drugs.\n\nCorroborative of the information provided by the confidential sources, Terrell was also in\n\npossession of two cell phones. Additional marijuana was found inside Terrell’s vehicle.\n\nTerrell initially stated that he was staying in Room 615, then stated that did not have a\n\nroom at the hotel but was there to meet “some girl” whose name he did not know.\n\nMitchell subsequently learned that Terrell was registered at Room 623, having previously\n\nstayed at the hotel in Room 615 five days earlier. The security guard advised Mitchell\n\nthat he had personally observed Terrell engage in suspicious behavior that he believed\n\nwas drug activity in the hotel parking lot on March 26, 2015, and similar behavior on the\n\nnight of March 31, 2015. The guard advised Mitchell that Terrell and Minter on both\n\noccasions “went up to the room, then would leave for 30 minutes and come back, multiple\n\f                                                                                           -43-\n\n\ntimes, and sit for around 20-30 minutes in the vehicles in the parking lot at night.”\n\n       {¶ 53} In Dalpiaz, the police had evidence that Dalpiaz was cultivating marijuana.\n\nId., ¶ 28. As the Eleventh District noted:\n\n                The affidavit attached to the July 7 warrant contains the following\n\n       statements concerning [Chief Detective] Doak’s sources of information:\n\n       “[t]he affiant has received information that [appellant] makes frequent trips\n\n       both in the morning and evening hours * * *”; “[appellant] has been seen\n\n       making these trips * * *”; “[appellant] is commonly known to carry a firearm\n\n       on his side during these trips * * *”; “[a]ccording to confidential sources, this\n\n       individual has not worked * * * for several years”; “[t]he Portage County\n\n       Sheriff’s Office has received information that the cultivation of marijuana is\n\n       [appellant’s] only source of income”; and “[w]e have received information in\n\n       the past and currently know that [appellant] is known to booby trap the areas\n\n       where he cultivates marijuana.” Nowhere does the affidavit suggest that\n\n       this information was received from reliable sources. In fact, much of the\n\n       information provided in the affidavit is not even attributed to a particular\n\n       source or to particular sources.\n\n                In view of the complete absence of any indication of the reliability of\n\n       the sources that provided Doak with the information concerning appellant’s\n\n       activities outlined in the affidavit, the affidavit failed to establish probable\n\n       cause for the issuance of the search warrant, and appellant’s third\n\n       assignment of error is well taken.\n\nId., ¶ 36-37.\n\f                                                                                         -44-\n\n\n       {¶ 54} We cannot conclude, as does Terrell, that the affidavit herein is “strikingly\n\nsimilar” to that in Dalpiaz. The information in Mitchell’s affidavit is attributed to two\n\nspecific confidential sources, the observations of the security guard on March 26 and 31,\n\nand the observations of McCarty, Osborne and Mitchell, who interacted with Terrell.\n\n       {¶ 55} Regarding Terrell’s assertion that Mitchell presented his own inferences as\n\nempirical fact, we disagree. Mitchell has been employed by the City of Springfield Police\n\nDivision since January 2007, and he has been trained in narcotics enforcement.\n\nMitchell’s averments, in paragraph 15 of the affidavit, regarding the known nicknames of\n\nMinter and of specific drug traffickers in Springfield, are based on Mitchell’s personal\n\nknowledge. Further, based upon his experience, it is a reasonable inference that the\n\nnumbers in the ledger alongside the nicknames “likely indicate dollar amounts owed to\n\nTerrell for various types and amounts of illegal drugs.”\n\n       {¶ 56} The distinction between the matter herein and Castagnola is instructive.\n\nCastagnola admitted in a text message to “Source May” that he damaged the vehicles of\n\nDavid Maistros, a prosecutor. Id., ¶ 3. The text message indicated that Castagnola\n\n“ ‘[f]ound his address and went to his house * * *.’ ” Id., ¶ 6.   The affidavit provided to\n\nobtain the search warrant paraphrased the exchange between Castagnola and “Source\n\nMay” in part as follows: “Castagnola then says that he found Maistros online in the clerk\n\nof courts because he [Maistros] got a parking ticket several years ago.” Id., ¶ 8. “The\n\ndetective did not state in the search-warrant affidavit the internet-access capability or\n\nother capabilities of Castagnola’s cell phone.” Id., ¶ 9. “Nor did the search-warrant\n\naffidavit provide information, beyond the ‘online’ inference, to indicate that Castagnola\n\nhad conducted an online search for Maistros’s address or that a computer that was used\n\f                                                                                          -45-\n\nto conduct such a search was located in Castagnola’s residence.” Id. Upon execution\n\nof the warrant, child pornography was found on one of Castagnola’s computers. Id., ¶\n\n13.\n\n      {¶ 57} The Supreme Court of Ohio determined in part as follows:\n\n             In short, while there was probable cause to believe that Castagnola\n\n      had searched for [the prosecutor’s] address, the method of his search was\n\n      not clear.    We affirmatively reject the trial court’s assertion that in\n\n      determining whether an affidavit supports probable cause to issue a search\n\n      warrant, a magistrate can infer “online” activities by people of a certain age.\n\n      We further reject the trial court’s supposition that statements sent by text\n\n      message admitting criminal activity create a substantial basis for concluding\n\n      that evidence of a crime will be found on a computer. Similarly, we are not\n\n      inclined to leap to the conclusion that the information stored on a phone will\n\n      necessarily be backed up on a computer. Although we are in the computer\n\n      age, records of court activity still exist in paper form and are available to the\n\n      public in clerk of courts’ offices around the state.\n\nId., ¶ 63. The Castagnola Court determined that “the affiant negligently usurped the\n\ninference-drawing authority of the magistrate and * * * under the totality of the\n\ncircumstances, the search warrant was not supported by probable cause.” Id., ¶ 65.\n\n      {¶ 58} Herein, Mitchell’s averments are based on his personal knowledge of the\n\nidentities of the nicknames of Minter and the drug traffickers, and his inference regarding\n\nthe purpose of the ledger, containing names and numbers, is not attenuated, as the\n\ninference in Castagnola, but rather is reasonable based upon Mitchell’s experience.\n\f                                                                                         -46-\n\n\nFinally, we note that Mitchell attached the page of the ledger to the affidavit that he\n\nbelieved to be relevant to his investigation, again based upon his experience.\n\n       {¶ 59}    We agree with the State that Terrell’s reliance upon the testimony of Beau\n\nCollins in the trial transcript to attempt to discredit Mitchell’s reasonable inferences is\n\nmisplaced. In State v. Harris, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 26810, 2016-Ohio-7097, ¶ 3, this\n\nCourt emphasized that “when reviewing suppression rulings, we consider only the\n\nevidence before the trial court at the suppression hearing; we cannot consider any\n\nadditional evidence presented at a subsequent trial.”\n\n       {¶ 60} Regarding Terrell’s assertion that the affidavit lacked a nexus between the\n\ndrugs found on his person and in his hotel room, we disagree. In Perez, upon which Terrell\n\nrelies, this Court noted as follows:\n\n                The affidavit in support of the June 27 warrant indicates that Perez\n\n       was involved in drug trafficking and that evidence of that trafficking was\n\n       located in his home. He also used his truck to conduct drug transactions\n\n       away from his home. Upon the search of Perez’s truck and subsequent\n\n       investigation, police discovered that Perez recently rented a storage unit at\n\n       the Stop-N-Lock on Linden Avenue.            Based on this information, a\n\n       reasonable police officer might suspect that the previously-seen, but not yet\n\n       located weapons and additional evidence of drug trafficking might be found\n\n       in the storage unit. However, a reasonable belief, without some evidentiary\n\n       support, is not enough for a search warrant.\n\nId., ¶ 19.\n\n       {¶ 61} Unlike in Perez, we conclude that there is sufficient evidentiary support of a\n\f                                                                                         -47-\n\n\nnexus between the alleged crime of drug trafficking, the objects to be seized, and Room\n\n623. As noted above, Terrell was the subject of a drug trafficking investigation, and the\n\nsecurity guard reported activity consistent with drug trafficking to Mitchell occurring on\n\ntwo occasions, namely March 25 and the night of Terrell’s arrest. It was reasonable to\n\ninfer that in the course of his comings and goings, as described by the security guard,\n\nTerrell transported drugs to purchasers. While the amount of drugs retrieved from Terrell\n\nwas not large, his ledger and his possession of more than one cell phone suggest an\n\nongoing drug trafficking activity. His evasive answers about his room further suggest the\n\npotential presence of contraband that he sought to conceal. Finally, Mitchell confirmed\n\nthat Terrell was the registered guest of Room 623 on the night of his arrest, and the\n\nregistered guest of Room 615 on March 25.\n\n       {¶ 62} For the foregoing reasons, and deferring to the magistrate’s determination\n\nof probable cause, we conclude that the facts in the affidavit provided a substantial basis\n\nfor finding probable cause to believe that drugs likely were present in Room 623.\n\nAccordingly, we need not address Terrell’s assertion regarding the good faith exception.\n\nTerrell’s first assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶ 63} Terrell’s second assignment of error is as follows:\n\n              THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT DENIED APPELLANT’S\n\n       MOTION TO SUPPRESS WHEN THE WARRANT WAS SO LACKING IN\n\n       PARTICULARITY AS TO BE FACIALLY DEFICIENT, AND THE\n\n       EXECUTING         OFFICERS        FLAGRANTLY        DISREGARDED          THE\n\n       LIMITATIONS THE WARRANT DID CONTAIN.\n\n       {¶ 64} Terrell asserts that the warrant lacks particularity, and that our standard of\n\f                                                                                          -48-\n\n\nreview is de novo. Terrell notes that “specifically the warrant states that the police should\n\nseize, items showing an ownership or possessory interest in the residence and any items\n\nlocated therein.” He further argues that the “warrant states that the contents of cell\n\nphones subject to seizure include ‘contact lists, text messages, call history, photographs,\n\nvideos, application data, location data, and other documents and data.’ ” According to\n\nTerrell, “the warrant gave the officers carte blanche to seize whatever they might think\n\nincriminating or useful to them.” Terrell directs our attention to the trial testimony of\n\nDetective Scott Curnutte, whose “statement that he was searching for anything that might\n\nbe interesting explicitly shows that the officers executing the search warrant were in no\n\nway limited by the express terms in the warrant, and that he arrived at Room 623 with the\n\nintent to participate in the type of ‘general rummaging’ and exploratory search expressly\n\nprohibited by the Fourth Amendment.”\n\n       {¶ 65} Finally, again citing the trial transcript, Terrell asserts that the “officers\n\nexecuting the search warrant seized a candle warmer, a coffee cup, a bottle of Patron\n\ntequila, the box the bottle of Patron came in, several glasses, empty Kroger shopping\n\nbags, and wrist watch * * *. None of these items have any possible relation to drug\n\ntrafficking.”\n\n       {¶ 66} Regarding the particularity of the warrant, as noted in Castagnola:\n\n                Courts addressing the particularity requirement of the Fourth\n\n       Amendment are concerned with two issues. The first issue is whether the\n\n       warrant provides sufficient information to “guide and control” the judgment\n\n       of the executing officers in what to seize. United States v. Upham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198323\"><a href=\"/opinion/198323/united-states-v-upham/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span>\n\n       <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535 (1st Cir.1999). The second issue is whether the category as\n\f                                                                                          -49-\n\n       specified is too broad in that it includes items that should not be seized. See\n\n       United States v. Kow, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"698432\"><a href=\"/opinion/698432/united-states-v-stephen-kow-helen-kim-noi-soo-and-hong-tho-luu/\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 427 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\nId., at 79. “Catchall provisions of warrants also ‘ “must be read in conjunction with the\n\nlist of particularly described items which preceded it pertaining to the crimes alleged.” * *\n\n* ’ ”. State v. Hale, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 23582, 2010-Ohio-2389, ¶ 43 (citation\n\nomitted) .\n\n       {¶ 67} We note that Terrell did not raise the particularity of the warrant or the scope\n\nof the search before the trial court. The only issue before the trial court at the hearing\n\non November 9, 2015, and the only issue the court addressed, was whether there was\n\nsufficient probable cause to support the issuance of the warrant. We conclude that Terrell\n\nwaived all but plain error as to the issues that he now asserts by failing to raise them in\n\nthe trial court. State v. Zwick, 2d Dist. Miami No. 2013 CA 4, 2014-Ohio-230, ¶ 18. (“In\n\nhis motion to suppress, Zwick challenged the issuance of the search warrants, not\n\nwhether the seizure of items pursuant to the warrants exceeded the scope of the warrants.\n\nBecause Zwick failed to raise the scope of the warrants in the trial court, he has waived\n\nall but plain error on that issue.”)\n\n       {¶ 68} The portions of the warrant referring to the contents of cell phones and\n\n“any” items located in Terrell’s hotel room must be read in conjunction with the list of\n\nparticularly described items before them in the warrant. When the listed items, namely\n\n“[h]eroin, cocaine, marijuana, controlled substance analogs, drug paraphernalia, items\n\nused to transport, package, or prepare drugs for sale, money, financial records of drug\n\ntrafficking activity,* * *” are properly read in conjunction with the broader, “catchall”\n\nprovisions regarding the hotel room and the phones, plain error is not demonstrated.\n\f                                                                                          -50-\n\n\n       {¶ 69} Regarding the non-contraband items listed above seized in the course of\n\nthe search, there was no evidence before the trial court regarding any items seized. As\n\nnoted above, in addressing the trial court’s decision on the motion to suppress, we will\n\nnot consider the testimony adduced at trial. Plain error is not demonstrated, and for the\n\nforegoing reasons, Terrell’s second assignment of error is overruled.\n\n       {¶ 70} Terrell’s third assignment of error is as follows:\n\n              THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT OVERRULED THE MOTION\n\n       TO SUPPRESS, BECAUSE THE OFFICER PAT SEARCHED [sic]\n\n       APPELLANT       ABSENT      A   REASONABLE         SUSPICION       THAT     HE\n\n       POSSESSED A WEAPON,                AND ANY CONSENT WAS GIVEN\n\n       INVOLUNTARILY.\n\n       {¶ 71} Terrell argues that “McCarty stated at trial that the search he conducted\n\nwas not for weapons, Appellant had given him no reason to believe he had a weapon,\n\nand that he was specifically looking for evidence of drugs.” Terrell asserts that there is\n\n“some discrepancy in the record as to whether or not Officer McCarty searched Appellant\n\nbefore or after Officer Osborne indicated that he smelled marijuana from the vehicle; but\n\nin either case, Appellant’s rights were violated.”\n\n       {¶ 72} Terrell directs our attention to this Court’s decision in State v. Alexander, 2d\n\nDist. Montgomery No. 18205, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1062064</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Aug. 4, 2000). Therein, one officer\n\napproached a vehicle in a hotel parking lot at 11:30 p.m. Id., *1. The officer smelled a\n\nstrong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle. Id. When the driver of the vehicle\n\ncould not produce identification and exhibited “assertive movements,” the officer decided\n\nto pat him down for officer safety. Id., *2. This Court noted that smoking marijuana is not\n\f                                                                                          -51-\n\n\n“an especially serious offense,” and that there was “nothing in the record to suggest that\n\nAlexander was a drug dealer.” Id., *3. The Court concluded that “the strong odor of\n\nmarijuana, indicative of Alexander’s use of marijuana, even if he was not buying or selling\n\nmarijuana, justified Smith in conducting a limited pat-down search for weapons when he\n\ndecided it was necessary to place Alexander in the back of his police cruiser to separate\n\nhim from the other occupant of the car, while Alexander’s identification was being\n\nverified.” Id., *4. Terrell asserts that “[u]nlike in Alexander, Officer McCarty expressly\n\nstates that the search was not for weapons, and was done to locate drugs. There was\n\nno concern expressed regarding officer safety, and the ‘close call’ found in Alexander\n\nbecomes an obvious violation in those circumstances.”\n\n       {¶ 73} Alternatively, Terrell argues that if he “was not in custody and entitled to the\n\nprotections of Miranda at the time of the search, then Appellant was unlawfully detained,\n\nand his consent was not freely or voluntarily given.” According to Terrell, if “the search\n\nwas made prior to Officer Osborne detecting the smell of marijuana, th[e]n Officer\n\nMcCarty had absolutely no reason to search Appellant; and detaining a hotel guest for\n\nsitting in their vehicle outside the hotel would be asinine.” Terrell argues that if he was\n\nsearched after Osborne indicated that he intended to search the vehicle based upon the\n\nsmell of marijuana, “then Appellant was already aware that a search of his vehicle was\n\ngoing to be performed without his consent, and without the officers even asking for his\n\nconsent, so he would have no reason to think that refusing to allow Officer McCarty to\n\nsearch his person would actually have any effect whatsoever on whether the search was\n\nperformed.”\n\n       {¶ 74} Terrell asserts that the “State will likely argue that Appellant consented to\n\f                                                                                       -52-\n\n\nthe search because he said, ‘I don’t care’, in response to the search request. Appellant’s\n\nstatement was not an affirmative waiver of his constitutional rights, it was resignation\n\nbased on his understanding that a search would be conducted no matter what he said.”\n\nTerrell asserts as follows:\n\n              * * * Appellant was apprehensive of elevating the confrontation with\n\n       Officer McCarty, and believed refusing consent would only create a far more\n\n       contentious atmosphere, and that Officer McCarty would search him\n\n       anyway. After being read his rights, Appellant refused to consent to a\n\n       search of his hotel room; but when Officer McCarty asked to search him,\n\n       Appellant had not been read his rights, and didn’t believe he had the ability\n\n       to refuse, because no one had told him he could. Appellant did not willingly\n\n       and voluntarily consent to a search, he resigned himself to the inevitable,\n\n       and said that he did not care.\n\n       {¶ 75} The State responds that “when looking at the totality of the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the consent it is clear that there was consent for the officers to search\n\nAppellant’s person.” According to the State, “Officer McCarty testified at the suppression\n\nhearing that he asked Appellant if he minded if Officer McCarty searched him and that\n\nAppellant responded that he didn’t care.” The State further asserts that “Officer McCarty\n\nalso testified that he asked Appellant specifically if he could check inside his p[o]ckets\n\nand appellant again responded that he didn’t care.” The State argues that Terrell’s\n\n“consent to search his person was heard by the hotel security officer who testified at the\n\nsuppression hearing that Appellant consented to the search.” According to the State,\n\nthere “was no evidence presented at the suppression hearing to counter the consent\n\f                                                                                          -53-\n\n\ngiven,” and officers “are not required to inform a subject that they can refuse to search for\n\nconsent to be effective.” The State notes that Terrell “had no problem” refusing consent\n\nto search his hotel room.\n\n       {¶ 76} In reply, Terrell argues as follows:\n\n              Appellant’s arguments that he believed he could not refuse consent,\n\n       and that he did not refuse out of fear, are not separate arguments, but two\n\n       parts of a whole.      At the time Officer McCarty requested to search\n\n       Appellant, Officer Osborne had already indicated that Appellant’s vehicle\n\n       would be searched without his consent. Appellant had not been read his\n\n       Miranda rights, knew that his vehicle was being searched without his\n\n       consent, and; according to Officer McCarty, Appellant was being detained.\n\n       * * * Under these circumstances, Appellant believed that if he did attempt to\n\n       refuse consent, he would be searched anyway; and feared that any attempt\n\n       to refuse would only result in creating a more confrontational situation with\n\n       the officers.\n\n       {¶ 77} Terrell acknowledges that he refused consent to search his hotel room, but\n\nnotes that “this was after Officer Osborne informed Appellant of his Miranda rights.\n\nAppellant’s understanding that he could effectively and safely refuse to consent to a\n\nsearch of his hotel room was a direct byproduct [sic] of being informed through Miranda\n\nthat his rights would be honored.” According to Terrell, the State “may be correct that\n\nofficers are not necessarily required to inform a suspect of his rights prior to a request for\n\nconsent in all circumstances, but officers are certainly required to do so when a suspect\n\nis in custody, and Officer McCarty openly admits that Appellant was being detained.”\n\f                                                                                          -54-\n\n\nFinally, Terrell notes that “Officer McCarty admits that Appellant’s statement that he did\n\nnot care was not an affirmative yes.”\n\n       {¶ 78} As this Court has previously noted:\n\n              “Appellate review of a motion to suppress presents a mixed question\n\n       of law and fact. When considering a motion to suppress, the trial court\n\n       assumes the role of trier of fact and is therefore in the best position to\n\n       resolve factual questions and evaluate the credibility of witnesses.” State\n\n       v.

George, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25945, 2014-Ohio-4853, ¶ 28.\n\n      {¶ 83} As this Court previously noted:\n\n               Courts and commentators have recognized that “consent [to search]\n\n      may be implied by the circumstances surrounding the search, by the\n\f                                                                                       -57-\n\n\n      person’s prior actions or agreements, or by the person’s failure to object to\n\n      the search.” Kuras, et al., Warrantless Searches and Seizures (2002), 90\n\n      Geo.L.J. 1130, 1172. “Thus a search may be lawful even if the person\n\n      giving consent does not recite the talismanic phrase ‘You have my\n\n      permission to search.’ * * *.”\n\nState v. Lane, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 21501, 2006-Ohio-6830, ¶ 40.\n\n      {¶ 84} We initially note that Terrell mischaracterizes McCarty’s testimony in\n\nasserting that the search he conducted of Terrell’s person was not for weapons.\n\nMcCarty testified that he was dispatched to the Marriott on the report of “suspicious”\n\noccupants in a vehicle engaged in suspected drug activity, namely coming and going from\n\nthe hotel parking lot after making repeated trips to a room inside the hotel. McCarty\n\ntestified that he and Osborne approached the vehicle described in the dispatch, and that\n\nthereafter Osborne, from the passenger side, informed McCarty that he intended to\n\nsearch the vehicle based upon a very strong odor of marijuana. McCarty testified that\n\nhe requested Terrell’s permission to search for “any weapons, or drugs or anything of that\n\nnature.” (Emphasis added.) We note that “Ohio courts have long recognized that persons\n\nwho engage in illegal drug activities are often armed with a weapon. * * * State v. Evans,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">67</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 413, 1993-Ohio-186.” State v. Martin, 2d Dist. Montgomery No.\n\n20270, 2004-Ohio-2738, ¶ 17.\n\n      {¶ 85} We further note that the facts in Alexander are distinguishable from the\n\nmatter herein; in Alexander, “the only drug violation for which Smith had a reasonable\n\nand articulable suspicion at the time of the pat-down search was the smoking of\n\nmarijuana,” and only one officer had approached Alexander’s vehicle. Id., *4. Here, two\n\f                                                                                        -58-\n\n\nofficers responded to a report of drug activity, namely suspected drug trafficking, and the\n\nfacts herein are accordingly more compelling than in Alexander to justify a pat down\n\nsearch.\n\n       {¶ 86} Further, we conclude that the record demonstrates that Terrell consented\n\nto the search and did not merely submit to a claim of authority. On direct examination,\n\nMcCarty stated that Terrell indicated that he did not mind if McCarty searched him, and\n\nMcMahan testified that Terrell consented to a search of his person. While McCarty’s\n\nreport indicated that Terrell responded that he “did not care,” when asked for his consent\n\nto search, nothing in the record demonstrates that Terrell refused to give consent;\n\nMcCarty testified, Terrell “didn’t give an affirmative no.” As noted above, consent may be\n\nimplied by a person’s failure to object to the search.\n\n       {¶ 87} Further, as the State notes, in State v. Iacona, 9th Dist. Medina No. CA\n\n2891-M, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">277911</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (March 15, 2000), the defendant therein argued that the trial\n\ncourt erred in denying her motion to suppress, since law enforcement “illegally detained\n\nthe Iacona family and * * * their consent to a search of the home was not voluntary.” Id.,\n\n*8. The officer in Iacona “arrived at the home of Defendant after he received a dispatch\n\nthat there was a dead baby in the basement of the home. Upon arrival, the patrolman\n\nwas greeted by Defendant’s mother, who invited him into the home.” Id., *9. The officer\n\nadvised defendant’s mother of the nature of the dispatch, and verbal consent to search\n\nthe premises was provided by her in response to the officer’s request, namely, “You mind\n\nif I take a look down the basement?” Id., *9. Mrs. Iacona responded, “No. I don’t care.”\n\nId.   The Ninth District determined that the search of the residence “was conducted\n\npursuant to a valid consent.” Id., *10.\n\f                                                                                         -59-\n\n\n       {¶ 88} Finally, we note that there is no evidence in the record before us of coercive\n\npolice conduct, or that Terrell was under duress, and there is no suggestion in the officers’\n\ntestimony that Terrell’s judgment was impaired. That Terrell indicated to Osborne that\n\nhe did not want to answer questions about the female whom he was allegedly at the hotel\n\nto visit, and that he indicated to Mitchell, when asked for permission to search the room,\n\nthat he wanted to speak to his attorney, suggest that Terrell was aware of his right to\n\nrefuse consent. Finally, whether Terrell’s consent was voluntarily given is a question of\n\nfact, and the trial court clearly credited McCarty’s testimony, and we defer to the trial\n\ncourt’s assessment of credibility. Under the totality of the circumstances, we find that\n\nTerrell’s third assignment of error lacks merit, and it is accordingly overruled.\n\n       {¶ 89} Terrell’s fourth assignment of error is as follows:\n\n              THE UNWARRANTED “PROTECTIVE SWEEP” OF APPELLANT’S\n\n       HOTEL ROOM WAS A VIOLATION OF APPELLANT’S FOURTH\n\n       AMENDMENT RIGHTS, AND WAS NOT SUPPORTED BY ANY EXIGENT\n\n       CIRCUMSTANCES.\n\n       {¶ 90} Terrell asserts as follows:\n\n              * * * The State will attempt to argue that Officer McCarty claims to\n\n       have heard the TV on in the room, and this created a reasonable fear that\n\n       there might be another person in the room to destroy evidence. Officer\n\n       McCarty is the only officer present during that search who claims to have\n\n       heard the television on; however, even if true, it had absolutely no bearing\n\n       on the officer’s decision to enter the room. Further, upon entering the\n\n       room, it was immediately apparent to the officers that the TV was on, yet\n\f                                                                                          -60-\n\n\n       they proceeded with their “protective sweep” anyway.\n\n              This was not a scenario where the officers walked upstairs, knocked\n\n       on the door, and heard frantic movement, or the frequent flushing of a toilet,\n\n       leading them to believe that evidence actually was being destroyed, and\n\n       necessitating that the officers kick the door down to preserve the evidence\n\n       of the offense. Instead, the officers obtained a key from the front desk\n\n       before they went upstairs. They had no reason to suspect evidence was\n\n       being destroyed, nor a reason to believe that anyone was in the room, they\n\n       had simply decided before they even got in the elevator that they were going\n\n       to check in the room and make sure. Whether Officer McCarty heard the\n\n       television when he arrived had no impact on the officers’ decision.\n\n       {¶ 91} Terrell argues that “officers admitted at trial that they had no knowledge or\n\nreasonable belief that there was anyone else in the hotel room. Further, the officers\n\ncertainly did not have a reasonable belief that the destruction of evidence was imminent,\n\nbecause at the time they made the warrantless entry the officers had no specific reason\n\nto believe that there even was evidence to destroy.”\n\n       {¶ 92} According to Terrell, trial testimony “indicates that the officers never had\n\nthe lights of their vehicle on when they pulled into the hotel. Appellant was in sight of the\n\npolice at all times, and there is certainly no indication that he made a phone call during\n\nthe encounter with the police.” He argues that if a third party was present in Room 623,\n\n“it is extremely unlikely that they would be aware of what was going on in the parking lot,\n\nor know to start destroying evidence. Further, the officers indicated at trial that it was at\n\nleast forty-five minutes between their initial interaction with Appellant, and the search of\n\f                                                                                         -61-\n\n\nRoom 623.” Terrell asserts that if “a third party was in the room, and unaware of the\n\npolice, then the police created any exigency which may have existed by walking up to the\n\nroom and announcing themselves, rather than simply waiting outside until a warrant could\n\nbe obtained.”\n\n      {¶ 93} The State responds that the “initial entry into the hotel room was based on\n\nexigent circumstances and only made for the purpose of securing the room to ensure that\n\nno evidence was destroyed.” The State asserts that “the officers had a reasonable belief\n\nthat someone else might be inside the hotel room because Appellant told Officer Osborn\n\nthat there was a female in the hotel room that he was there to visit.” According to the\n\nState, it “is also reasonable that that person in the room could destroy evidence because\n\nsomeone in a hotel room, expecting Appellant to return to the room as he had been doing\n\nall evening, could have easily looked out the window and seen Appellant interacting with\n\nofficers and destroyed evidence.” The State notes that Officer McCarty heard someone\n\nspeaking, knocked on the door without response, and that such a circumstance “could\n\nlead to a reasonable belief that someone was in the room and destroying evidence.”\n\n      {¶ 94} The State argues that even if this Court finds that “the initial entry into the\n\nroom was unlawful, it did not affect the search conducted pursuant to the search warrant.”\n\nAccording to the State, “all of the evidence obtained in this case is wholly dependent and\n\nin no way the product of the initial warrantless entry into the residence.” The State notes\n\nthat both “officer Osborne and Officer McCarty testified at the suppression hearing that\n\nthey were in the hotel room for less than a minute and they only ensured that there was\n\nno one in the room that could destroy evidence.”\n\n      {¶ 95} In reply, Terrell argues, regarding the State’s assertion that the officers\n\f                                                                                           -62-\n\n\nbelieved someone else might be inside the hotel room, that “Detective Mitchell’s affidavit\n\nshows that this is not true. The affidavit states that Appellant told Officer Osborn that he\n\nwas at the hotel to meet a woman, but that she had not shown up yet.” According to\n\nTerrell, the “State cannot base a claim of exigent circumstances on this statement of\n\nAppellant, because Appellant said that the woman was not there.”\n\n         {¶ 96} Further, Terrell asserts that “it is clear that the officers did not believe\n\nAppellant about either the presence of a woman, or his room number.                  Appellant\n\nindicated that his room was 615, but officers searched Room 623 after speaking with hotel\n\nstaff. The officers were further informed that only one person was staying in the hotel\n\nroom.”\n\n         {¶ 97} Finally, Terrell asserts as follows:\n\n                The State’s argument that an exigent circumstance was created\n\n         because Officer McCarty heard voices inside the room when officers were\n\n         outside of it is similarly flawed. The voices were actually the television, and\n\n         no one was in the room. The officers arrived at the room with every intent\n\n         of entering it, regardless of any sounds they may have heard from inside.\n\n         The officers obtained a key to the room from the front desk before ever\n\n         going near the room, and the only reason to obtain the key is to open the\n\n         door. The State cannot claim that an exigency was created by any voices\n\n         Officer McCarty thought he heard when the officers went to the room with\n\n         every intention of entering it.\n\n         {¶ 98} As this Court has previously noted:\n\n                “It is well recognized that police may enter a home without a warrant\n\f                                                                                 -63-\n\n\nwhere they have probable cause to search and exigent circumstances exist\n\njustifying the entry.” State v.

Nelson, 2d Dist. Montgomery No. CA9363,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1986</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">9504</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, *6 (Aug. 22, 1986):\n\n              * * * Segura holds that when the information on which a search\n\n       warrant was secured came from an independent source and not from the\n\n       original entry, evidence obtained lawfully under the warrant was admissible.\n\n       Under such circumstances the illegality of the original entry is irrelevant on\n\n       the admission of evidence and the “fruit of the poisonous tree” doctrine not\n\n       applicable.\n\n       {¶ 101} As noted above, the officers were dispatched to the scene on a report of\n\nsuspected drug activity that involved Terrell repeatedly appearing in the parking lot and\n\nreturning to his room in the hotel, activity that had occurred on a previous occasion. As\n\nfurther noted above, Terrell was deceptive about the circumstances of his presence at\n\nthe hotel. He was further misleading about the presence of the alleged female guest.\n\nTerrell initially advised Osborne that he was there to visit the female. Mitchell testified\n\nthat he learned from McCarty (via Osborne) that Terrell indicated that he was not a guest\n\nat the hotel but was visiting the female in Room 615. McCarty, however, testified that\n\nTerrell advised him that he was a guest at the hotel, in Room 615, and that McMahan\n\ncould vouch for his status as a registered guest.\n\f                                                                                        -66-\n\n\n       {¶ 102} Osborne testified that he was instructed to secure Room 623, the room to\n\nwhich the officers eventually confirmed Terrell was registered. Osborne stated that he\n\n“checked it for people. That’s it.”   He stated that he “didn’t open anything or touch\n\nanything.” Osborne stated that he did so because he “didn’t know” if anyone was inside\n\nthe room. Osborne, an experienced officer, stated that he believed that “there was some\n\ntype of drug activity going on in” the hotel room based upon the strong odor of marijuana\n\ncoming from the van, his familiarity with Terrell’s and Minter’s criminal history involving\n\ndrug activity, and the report of suspected drug activity at the hotel by McMahan. Osborne\n\nstated that he was inside the room for “less than ten seconds” to “make sure there was\n\nnobody inside of the room to destroy anything that could be inside.”\n\n       {¶ 103} Consistent with Osborne’s testimony, McCarty testified that his intent in\n\nentering the room was “to secure it,” and to make “sure there was nobody in there that\n\ncould destroy any possible evidence before we could search it.” (Emphasis added.)\n\nMcCarty testified that he had reason to believe someone was inside the room because\n\nTerrell indicated “at some point, he was with some female in the room.” Like Osborne,\n\nMcCarty testified that the sweep of the room was limited in time and scope. He stated\n\nthat he was in the room “[m]aybe a minute or less,” and that as he walked through the\n\nroom he checked between the beds and in the shower for people. Unlike Osborne,\n\nMcCarty further testified that he heard “very faint voices” emanating from the room,\n\nthereby bolstering his concern that the room was occupied. We note that while Terrell\n\nasserts that the officers learned from the front desk that the room was registered to him\n\nalone, such that he was the sole occupant of the room, hotel personnel may not know if\n\na registered guest has visitors.\n\f                                                                                          -67-\n\n\n       {¶ 104} Most significantly, in the course of entering and securing the room pending\n\nthe search warrant, the officers did not retrieve any evidence.       In other words, the\n\ninformation that served as the basis for the search warrant, as noted above, came from\n\nsources independent of the original protective sweep. For the foregoing reasons, we\n\nconclude that Terrell’s fourth assigned error lacks merit. It is accordingly overruled.\n\n       {¶ 105} On January 18, 2017, Terrell filed a motion for leave to file a supplemental\n\nbrief, as well as a supplemental brief, and this Court granted the motion on January 24,\n\n2017. Terrell directed this Court’s attention to State v. Gonzales, Ohio Supreme Court\n\nSlip Opinion No. 2016-Ohio-8319 (“Gonzales I”), asserting two assignments of error as\n\nfollows:\n\n              APPELLANT’S CONVICTION TO [sic] A FELONY OF THE FIRST\n\n       DEGREE UNDER R.C. §2925.11(C)(4)(e); AND A FELONY OF THE FIRST\n\n       DEGREE UNDER §2925.03(C)(4)(f); WERE NOT SUPPORTED BY\n\n       SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE AND WERE AGAINST THE MANIFEST\n\n       WEIGHT OF THE EVIDENCE PURSUANT TO THE OHIO SUPREME\n\n       COURT’S DECISION IN STATE V.

She\n\ntestified via video deposition at trial that she tested two samples of substances retrieved\n\f                                                                                      -68-\n\n\nfrom Terrell’s hotel room and confirmed that they were cocaine. She stated that one of\n\nthe samples weighed 42.53 grams, and one of them weighed 42.34 grams, for a total\n\nweight of 84.87 grams.\n\n      {¶ 107} As this Court previously noted:\n\n             When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, he is\n\n      arguing that the State presented inadequate evidence on each element of\n\n      the offense to sustain the verdict as a matter of law.

Gonzales received a mandatory sentence of 11 years. Id. In Gonzales I, the\n\nSupreme Court of Ohio recognized a conflict between State v. Gonzales, 6th District\n\nWood No. WD-13-086, 2015-Ohio-461, ¶ 47 (“Because the state failed to introduce\n\nevidence as to the purity or weight of the cocaine in this case, we find that appellant’s\n\npenalty enhancement under R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)(f) must be reversed and vacated.”), and\n\nthis Court’s decision in State v. Smith, 2d Dist. Greene No. 2010-CA-36, 2011-Ohio-2568,\n\n¶ 12 (“Case law does not support Smith’s claim that the State was required to segregate\n\nthe cocaine from the other ingredients in the substance.”). The Court considered the\n\nfollowing certified question: “Must the state, in prosecuting cocaine offenses involving\n\nmixed substances under R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)[(b)] through (f), prove that the weight of the\n\ncocaine meets the statutory threshold, excluding the weight of any filler materials used in\n\nthe mixture?” Gonzales I, ¶ 1.\n\n      {¶ 112} The Supreme Court noted that it found “nothing in the language of R.C.\n\n2925.11(C)(4)(f) to be ambiguous.        By its plain terms, the statute prohibits the\n\f                                                                                           -72-\n\npossession of 100 grams or more of cocaine.” Id., ¶ 20. The Court concluded that “in\n\nprosecuting cocaine-possession offenses under R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)(b) through (f)\n\ninvolving mixed substances, the state must prove that the weight of the actual cocaine,\n\nexcluding the weight of any filler materials, meets the statutory threshold.” Id., ¶ 22.\n\n       {¶ 113} Terrell asserts that Gonzales I applies retroactively, and that it applies both\n\nto cases involving possession of cocaine, and cases involving trafficking in cocaine. He\n\nasserts that Gonzales I “requires the State to prove that the amount of pure cocaine\n\ninvolved in an alleged first degree felony offense for trafficking in or possession of cocaine\n\nis at twenty-seven grams,” and that the “State presented no evidence regarding the purity\n\nof the cocaine, or the amount of pure cocaine.” Finally, he asserts that the trial court’s\n\n“failure to instruct the jury that the State must prove the amount of pure cocaine, excluding\n\nfillers, involved in Appellant’s alleged offenses constitutes plain error.” The State\n\nresponds that Gonzales I does not apply retroactively.\n\n       {¶ 114} On March 7, 2017, the State filed a “Notice of Additional Authority,”\n\ndirecting this Court’s attention to State v. Gonzales, Ohio Supreme Court Slip Opinion\n\nNo. 2017-Ohio-777 (“Gonzales II”), in which the Supreme Court reconsidered its decision\n\nin Gonzalez I on the State’s motion. The Court noted that “[r]ead as a whole, the plain\n\nlanguage of R.C. 2925.11(C)(4)(b) through (f) penalizes an offender for the amount of\n\ncocaine possessed, and the amount of ‘cocaine’ clearly encompasses the whole\n\ncompound or preparation of cocaine, including fillers that are part of the usable drug.”\n\nId., ¶ 9. The Court further noted that pursuant to R.C. 2925.01(X)(3), the “statutory\n\ndefinition of ‘cocaine’ includes a ‘salt, compound, derivative, or preparation’ of a\n\nsubstance that is cocaine salt or base cocaine,” and that “the statutory definition of\n\f                                                                                             -73-\n\ncocaine plainly encompasses a compound or preparation that includes cocaine.” Id., ¶\n\n10. The Court defined “compound” as “ ‘something (as a substance * * *) that is formed\n\nby a union of * * * ingredients.’ Webster’s Third New International Dictionary 466 (1986).”\n\nId. The Court concluded that “this is consistent with the nature of the cocaine used illegally\n\nin the United States, which is a compound of several ingredients.” Id., ¶ 11.\n\n       {¶ 115} It was significant to the Court that “the fillers, or adulterants, that are part\n\nof powder cocaine are not intended to be removed before consumption. Indeed, the\n\nfillers are an inherent part of powder cocaine.” Id., ¶ 12. The Court noted that “the\n\ncommon usage of the term ‘cocaine’ is consistent with the statutory definition that a\n\ncompound or preparation of cocaine is still cocaine,” and the Court concluded that “the\n\ntotal weight of the drug, including any fillers that are part of usable cocaine, should be\n\nweighed to determine the appropriate cocaine-possession penalty under the statute.” Id.\n\nAccording to the Court, the “statute is unambiguous,” and “[i]f the General Assembly had\n\nbeen concerned about purity, rather than total weight, it would have said so.” Id., ¶ 13-14.\n\nThe Court concluded that “the applicable offense level for cocaine possession under R.C.\n\n2925.11(C)(4) is determined by the total weight of the drug involved, including any fillers\n\nthat are part of the usable drug.” Id., ¶ 18.\n\n       {¶ 116} Based upon the Supreme Court’s decision in Gonzales II, we conclude\n\nthat Terrell’s supplemental assignments of error lack merit. In other words, Terrell’s\n\nconvictions are supported by sufficient evidence and not against the manifest weight of\n\nthe evidence, the trial court did not commit plain error in failing to instruct the jury that the\n\nState was required to prove that the amount of pure cocaine, excluding fillers, at issue in\n\nTerrell’s offenses was at least 27 grams, and Terrell’s sentence does not constitute plain\n\f                                                                                         -74-\n\n\nerror, since his 11-year sentence for a first degree felony is within the statutory range of\n\nR.C. 2929.14(A)(1).     Terrell’s supplemental assignments of error are accordingly\n\noverruled, and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      .............\n\nFROELICH, J. and WELBAUM, J., concur.\n\nCopies mailed to:\n\nMegan M.

Appellant did not raise the particularity of the warrant or the scope of the search before the trial court, and plain error is not demonstrated. Appellant consented to the pat down search of his person and did not merely submit to a claim of authority. Officers properly entered Appellant's hotel room to secure it pending the warrant. Appellant's reliance upon State v. Gonzales, Slip Opinion No. 2016-Ohio-8319, is misplaced pursuant to State v. Gonzales, Slip Opinion No. 2017-Ohio-777, the applicable offense level for cocaine possession is determined by the total weight of the drug involved, including fillers, and Appellant's convictions are supported by sufficient evidence and not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The trial court did not commit plain error in failing to instruct the jury that the State was required to prove the amount of pure cocaine in the drug, excluding fillers, or in sentencing Appellant. Judgment affirmed.",
