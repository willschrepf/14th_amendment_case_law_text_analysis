The core issues on appeal\n\nfocus on the trial court’s classification and division of\n\nproperty.    The plaintiff, Jack Davis (“Husband”), appealed,\n\nclaiming that the trial court erred in classifying certain\n\nproperty as marital property when the property should have been\n\nclassified as his separate property; that the trial court awarded\n\nhis wife, Clanetta Davis (“Wife”), a disproportionate share of\n\nthe marital property; and that the trial court failed to\n\nadequately direct the work of the court-appointed special master.\n\nWife, for her part, argues that she is entitled to a larger share\n\nof the marital property and that the trial court undervalued\n\ncertain marital assets to her disadvantage.           As an additional\n\nissue, she seeks attorney’s fees for a frivolous appeal.\n\n\n\n                           I.   General Overview\n\n\n\n            The trial court’s judgment dissolved a marriage of 33-\n\nplus years.    At the time of trial, Husband was 65 years of age.\n\nWife was 59.    The trial court found that Husband had physical\n\nproblems “which would likely make it impossible [for him]...to\n\nengage in gainful employment.”        Wife was in relatively good\n\nhealth “and should be able to work several more years.”             She is a\n\nschool teacher by profession.        The sole contested issue at trial\n\nwas the classification and division of the parties’ property.2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       The parties stipulated to the existence of grounds for divorce pursuant\nto the provisions of T.C.A. § 36-4-129 (1996 Repl.). Neither party sought\nalimony. There were no issues pertaining to the parties’ two children, both\nof whom are adults.\n\n                                      2\n\f                   II.   Trial Court’s Judgment\n\n\n\n          This case was tried before Judge Thomas J. Seeley, Jr.\n\nJudge Seeley filed an exhaustive, 34-page memorandum opinion, in\n\nwhich he addressed each asset of the parties.     He also examined\n\nthe division-of-property factors found at T.C.A. § 36-4-121(c)\n\nwith particular reference to the facts of this case.        He\n\nsegregated the parties’ property into the separate property and\n\nmarital property categories; awarded the separate property to the\n\nparty to whom it belonged; and then divided the marital property\n\nequally between the parties.\n\n\n\n          The final judgment, as subsequently modified by the\n\ntrial court, includes a detailed recapitulation schedule, which\n\nis attached as an exhibit to this opinion.     In summary, the trial\n\ncourt awarded the parties’ property as follows:\n\n\n\n                               Husband\n\n          Separate Property                $   686,917.07\n          50% of Marital Property              552,423.24\n\n                                           $1,239,340.31\n\n\n                                Wife\n\n          Separate Property                $    26,761.00\n          50% of Marital Property              552,423.23\n\n                                           $   579,184.23\n\n\n\n          The trial court was faced with a Herculean task in this\n\ncase of tracing assets, classifying property as separate or\n\nmarital, and attempting to unravel relatively complicated\n\nfinancial transactions and dealings.     Its task was made more\n\n                                  3\n\fdifficult by the machinations of Husband, as described by the\n\ntrial court in its excellent memorandum opinion:\n\n\n\n          The number of real properties involved\n          (presently some 20 parcels) and the different\n          manners in which title was acquired and\n          exists (deed; inheritance; inter vivos gift;\n          being held singly, jointly, in partnership\n          and some in trust) make classification\n          difficult. Jack Davis tried to retain\n          certain properties and monies as his separate\n          property. However, he commingled his\n          separate funds with marital funds and used\n          marital funds along with gifted funds to\n          acquire some of the properties he now claims\n          as his separate property. Further, Jack\n          Davis attempted to secrete several hundred\n          thousand dollars ($452,000) prior to his\n          filing for divorce. He gave $200,000 to one\n          friend in a plastic valise; he gave another\n          $100,000 to a second friend in a paper sack;\n          and placed $26,500 in his automobile’s spare\n          tire well. He put $25,500 in a roll of\n          carpet, which money disappeared. He claims\n          to have done this because he was concerned\n          that his son’s possible involvement with\n          drugs would subject all Mr. Davis’ property\n          to seizure by the government. The Court\n          considers this statement to be disingenuous.\n          On the contrary, Fred Steward, the friend to\n          whom Jack Davis gave $100,000, testified that\n          Mr. Davis asked him to keep the money because\n          he “foresaw a divorce” with Ms. Davis. This\n          is, the Court believes, the true reason Mr.\n          Davis attempted to hide those monies. Mr.\n          Davis established and moved monies in and out\n          of some 42 different bank accounts between\n          July 10, 1992, and December 31, 1995, in this\n          continuing effort. The Court felt it\n          necessary to appoint John Sanders, attorney\n          in Johnson City, as a Special Master to take\n          control of certain monies and to attempt to\n          track the financial maneuvering of Jack\n          Davis, which were so numerous and convoluted\n          that Sanders requested the Court for\n          authorization to hire an accountant for\n          assistance. David Frizzell, C.P.A., was\n          hired. Mr. Davis kept voluminous records and\n          notes regarding his transactions; however,\n          even relying solely on his word as to how\n          some monies were spent during the referenced\n          three and one-half year period, including the\n          disappearance of the $25,500, Jack Davis\n          still cannot account for over $83,000. The\n          total amount for which Mr. Davis has no\n\n                                4\n\f          documentation was $183,285.23. Mr. Davis’\n          actions in trying to secrete his holdings and\n          his financial (banking) manipulations have\n          frustrated the Court’s duty to classify\n          properties as separate or marital and then\n          equitably divide the parties’ marital assets.\n\n\n\n                     III.       Standard of Review\n\n\n\n          Our review of this non-jury case is de novo\n\nupon the record with a presumption of correctness as to the trial\n\ncourt’s factual findings, unless the “preponderance of the\n\nevidence is otherwise.”     Rule 13(d), T.R.A.P.; Wright v. City of\n\nKnoxville, 898 S.W.2d 177, 181 (Tenn. 1995); Union Carbide v.\n\nHuddleston, 854 S.W.2d 87, 91 (Tenn. 1993); Catlett v. Chinery,\n\n952 S.W.2d 433, 434 (Tenn.App. 1997).       The trial court’s\n\nconclusions of law are not accorded the same deference.         Campbell\n\nv. Florida Steel Corp., 919 S.W.2d 26, 35 (Tenn. 1996); Presley\n\nv. Bennett, 860 S.W.2d 857, 859 (Tenn. 1993).        Our review is\n\ntempered by the well-established principle that the trial court\n\nis in the best position to assess the credibility of the\n\nwitnesses; accordingly, such determinations are entitled to great\n\nweight on appeal.   Massengale v. Massengale, 915 S.W.2d 818, 819\n\n(Tenn.App. 1995); Bowman v. Bowman, 836 S.W.2d 563, 567\n\n(Tenn.App. 1991).\n\n\n\n                          IV.    Applicable Law\n\n\n\n          The legal principles that control the division of\n\nproperty in a divorce case are well-stated by the Middle Section\n\n\n\n\n                                     5\n\fof this Court in the case of Batson v. Batson, 769 S.W.2d 849\n\n(Tenn.App. 1988):\n\n\n\n          Tennessee is a “dual property” jurisdiction\n          because its divorce statutes draw a\n          distinction between marital and separate\n          property. Since Tenn.Code Ann. § 36-4-\n          121(a)(Supp. 1988) provides only for the\n          division of marital property, proper\n          classification of a couple’s property is\n          essential. See 3 Family Law and Practice §\n          37.08[1](1988). Thus, as a first order of\n          business, it is incumbent on the trial court\n          to classify the property, to give each party\n          their separate property, and then to divide\n          the marital property equitably. See 2 H.\n          Clark, The Law of Domestic Relations in the\n          United States § 16.2, at 183-84 (2d ed.\n          1987).\n\n          Tenn.Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b) contains the\n          ground rules for classifying property, and\n          little elaboration is needed beyond the\n          statute itself.\n\n                           *    *    *\n\n          In accordance with this statute, marital\n          property includes the increase in value of\n          separate property “if each party\n          substantially contributed to its preservation\n          and appreciation.” Ellis v. Ellis, 748\n          S.W.2d 424, 426-27 (Tenn. 1988); Crews v.\n          Crews, 743 S.W.2d 182, 189 (Tenn.Ct.App.\n          1987).\n\n\n\nId. at 856.\n\n\n\n          Tenn.Code Ann. § 36-4-121(a) provides that\n          marital property should be divided equitably\n          without regard to fault. It gives a trial\n          court wide discretion in adjusting and\n          adjudicating the parties’ rights and\n          interests in all jointly owned property.\n          Fisher v. Fisher, 648 S.W.2d 244, 246 (Tenn.\n          1983). Accordingly, a trial court’s division\n          of the marital estate is entitled to great\n          weight on appeal, Edwards v. Edwards, 501\n          S.W.2d 283, 288 (Tenn.Ct.App. 1973), and\n          should be presumed to be proper unless the\n\n\n                                6\n\f            evidence preponderates otherwise. Lancaster\n            v. Lancaster, 671 S.W.2d 501, 502\n            (Tenn.Ct.App. 1984); Hardin v. Hardin, 689\n            S.W.2d 152, 154 (Tenn.Ct.App. 1983).\n\n            A trial court’s division of marital property\n            is to be guided by the factors contained in\n            Tenn.Code Ann. § 36-4-121(c).\n\n\n\nId. at 859.    We will now apply these principles to the facts of\n\nthis case.\n\n\n\n\n                        V.    Husband’s Issues\n\n\n                       A.    Unicoi County Farm\n\n\n            The parties were married on June 22, 1962.     In October,\n\n1977, the parties moved from Bristol to a farm in Unicoi County.\n\nAs the trial court noted, this property “was acquired by\n\n[Husband] from [his] family members in 1968 through a combination\n\nof deeds, litigation and inheritance.”       The property was titled\n\nsolely in Husband’s name.     Over the years, the property was\n\nimproved.    When the parties first moved to the farm, they lived\n\nin a “‘shack’ with no indoor plumbing” while their new residence\n\nwas being built.\n\n\n\n            Husband contends that only $80,000 of the value of the\n\nfarm found by the trial court, i.e., $225,000, should have been\n\ndesignated as marital property.        He argues that the trial court\n\nshould have classified $145,000 of the farm’s value as separate\n\nproperty rather than the $35,000 found by the trial court.       He\n\ntakes this position because, in the words of his brief, “the farm\n\nwas inherited by [him] to begin with.”       He concedes that Wife is\n\n                                   7\n\fentitled to share in that portion of the value of the farm\n\nrelated to improvements to the property “acquired by monies\n\nearned during the marriage.”    However, he claims that the bulk of\n\nthe appreciation in value of the property should be classified as\n\nHusband’s separate property because, so the argument goes, Wife\n\ndid not substantially contribute to the preservation and\n\nappreciation of the underlying separate property component of the\n\ntotal value.    In other words, Husband urges us to find that the\n\nonly marital component of the property’s value is composed of the\n\nadditions to its value occasioned by the infusions of marital\n\nincome during the marriage and the increase in value of those\n\nadditions.   He pegs this number at $80,000.\n\n\n\n          The trial court found that as of 1968 -- when the\n\nproperty was originally acquired by Husband from his family --\n\nthe underlying separate property interest in the farm was\n\nproperly valued at $35,000.    The evidence does not preponderate\n\nagainst this finding.    In fact, Husband testified that he paid\n\nonly $22,500 when he acquired the entire interest in 1968.    While\n\none of the appraisers assessed the value of the farm in 1968 at\n\n$52,500, both of the experts who testified regarding its value\n\n“stated that any appraisal of its value in 1968 would be highly\n\nspeculative.”\n\n\n\n          The trial court found that Wife “substantially\n\ncontributed to [the farm’s] preservation and appreciation.”     See\n\nT.C.A. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(B).    The court noted as follows:\n\n\n\n          Thus, the total property appreciated $190,000\n          over the years since 1968. Certainly a good\n\n                                  8\n\f            part of that appreciation would be simply\n            from inflation. However, without proper\n            maintenance and improvement, the farm would\n            not have increased nearly so much. Both\n            parties contributed to such improvements and\n            maintenance. The only substantial farm\n            activity conducted by either party was Ms.\n            Davis’ cattle raising. The grazing of cattle\n            contributes to the maintenance of the farm\n            and its appreciation in value. Ms. Davis\n            also did some plowing; did the gardening;\n            helped put up hay and did fencing. According\n            to both Mr. Davis and a neighbor, Lloyd\n            Garland, Ms. Davis was a “hard worker.”\n            Clanetta Davis has made substantial\n            contribution to the preservation and\n            appreciation of the farm.\n\n\n\n            The evidence does not preponderate against the trial\n\ncourt’s finding that all of the increase in value beyond the\n\ninitial separate property interest of $35,000 is marital\n\nproperty.\n\n\n\n                        B.   Bristol Property\n\n\n            The trial court concluded that property in Bristol\n\nworth $170,000 was properly classified as marital property.\n\nHusband takes the position that a portion of this property --\n\nvalued at $46,000 -- should be classified as separate property\n\nbecause the property “was purchased by [Husband] solely from\n\nmonies given him by his uncle.”       He claims that this $46,000\n\nincrement is his separate property because it was “acquired...by\n\ngift, bequest, devise or descent.”       See T.C.A. § 36-4-\n\n121(b)(2)(D).\n\n\n\n            The trial court considered Husband’s contention with\n\nrespect to the Bristol property but found that there was\n\n“insufficient proof to substantiate” his testimony that his uncle\n\n                                  9\n\fpaid for a portion of this property.    This dispute presented an\n\nissue of credibility to be resolved by the trial court.      It\n\nresolved that issue against Husband.    There is nothing in the\n\nrecord that is so compelling as to persuade us to ignore the\n\ntrial court’s credibility determination.    This being the case, we\n\ncannot say that the evidence preponderates against the trial\n\ncourt’s determination that the Bristol property is entirely\n\nmarital property.\n\n\n\n                    C.   Life Insurance Cash Value\n\n\n            The trial court found that Husband’s life insurance\n\npolicy, which had a cash value of $14,000, is a marital asset.\n\nHusband claims that the policy was purchased ten years prior to\n\nthe parties’ marriage and that $3,050 of the value of this asset\n\nat the time of the divorce should be classified as separate\n\nproperty.    This argument is said to be based on “[Husband’s]\n\ntestimony”; however, the brief does not cite us to the page of\n\nthe record where such testimony can be found.       Suffice it to say\n\nthat the record does not support Husband’s position.      The\n\nevidence does not preponderate against the trial court’s\n\nclassification of the entire cash value of the life insurance as\n\nmarital property.\n\n\n                    D.   Miscellaneous Cash Funds\n\n\n            The trial court found that the parties owned five bank\n\naccounts, the total value of which amounted to $13,740.63.        While\n\nthese accounts were all in Husband’s name, the trial court\n\nconcluded that they were marital property because of\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\f“commingling.”    These accounts are reflected in a report from\n\nDavid Frizzell, the C.P.A. who was hired by the special master.\n\n\n\n            Husband objects to the trial court’s finding that these\n\nbank accounts were a part of the marital estate because,\n\naccording to Husband’s brief, they “did not exist at the time of\n\ntrial.”    The record does not support Husband’s contention.    In\n\nview of Mr. Frizzell’s report, we cannot say that the evidence\n\npreponderates against the trial court’s determination with\n\nrespect to these miscellaneous bank accounts.\n\n\n                     E.    Special Master’s Report\n\n\n            Husband contends that the trial court erred in allowing\n\nthe special master “to file a report which did not encompass\n\nperiods after 1993.”      Even if this was error -- and we do not\n\nconcede that it was -- it did not affect the outcome of this\n\ntrial.    The trial court had a full hearing in this matter.    That\n\nhearing extended over four days and generated ten volumes of\n\ntestimony and 98 exhibits.      There is nothing in the record that\n\neven remotely suggests that the trial court refused to receive\n\nany relevant evidence.      On the contrary, the trial court heard\n\nsome 19 witnesses, and it is obvious that the parties were\n\nafforded an opportunity to fully present their respective\n\npositions.    If Husband thought that the special master’s report\n\nwas incomplete, he could have supplemented it by presenting\n\nrelevant evidence during the four-day trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                   11\n\f             There is no reversible error pertaining to the report\n\nof the special master.        See Rule 36(b), T.R.A.P.3\n\n\n\n                    VI.   Division of Marital Property\n\n\n\n             Both of the parties contend that the trial court’s\n\ndivision of property is not equitable.            Husband suggests a\n\ndifferent division.       His suggestion is based partially on his\n\nposition that the court erred in classifying certain assets as\n\nmarital rather than as his separate property.            We have previously\n\nheld that the trial court’s classifications are not in error.\n\nHence, to the extent that Husband’s proposal is based on these\n\nclassifications, it is rejected.            To the extent his proposal\n\nsimply suggests a different division of what the trial court\n\nfound to be marital assets, we do not agree that it is\n\nappropriate to modify the division decreed by the trial court.           A\n\ntrial court has wide discretion in dividing marital property.\n\nWatters v. Watters, 959 S.W.2d 585, 590 (Tenn.App. 1997).\n\n\n\n             Wife, on the other hand, contends that the trial court\n\nerred in selecting certain values which -- while testified to by\n\none of the experts -- were to her disadvantage.            She also\n\ncontends that the trial court, when it divided the parties’\n\nmarital property, should have considered the fact that Husband\n\ndissipated marital assets.\n\n\n\n    3\n        Rule 36(b), T.R.A.P., provides as follows:\n\n             A final judgment from which relief is available and\n             otherwise appropriate shall not be set aside unless,\n             considering the whole record, error involving a\n             substantial right more probably than not affected the\n             judgment...\n\n                                       12\n\f          The trial court’s findings as to the value of the\n\nvarious assets are within the range of the “value” testimony\n\npresented at trial.   See Watters, 959 S.W.2d at 589.   In this\n\ncase, we find no error in the trial court’s determinations, i.e.,\n\nthe evidence does not preponderate against these findings.\n\n\n\n          As to the trial court’s overall division of property,\n\nwe do not find that the evidence preponderates against the trial\n\ncourt’s findings.\n\n\n\n\n                                13\n\f                          VII.   Frivolous Appeal Claim\n\n\n\n                Wife claims that Husband’s appeal is frivolous.           She\n\nseeks damages pursuant to the provisions of T.C.A. § 27-1-122.4\n\nWe do not find that Husband’s appeal is frivolous.                This issue is\n\nfound adverse to Wife.\n\n\n\n                                 VIII.   Conclusion\n\n\n\n                The judgment of the trial court is affirmed with costs\n\non appeal being taxed against the appellant.               This case is\n\nremanded for enforcement of the trial court’s judgment and\n\ncollection of costs assessed below, all pursuant to applicable\n\nlaw.\n\n\n\n                                               __________________________\n                                               Charles D.

The core issues on appeal\n\nfocus on the trial court’s classification and division of\n\nproperty.    The plaintiff, Jack Davis (“Husband”), appealed,\n\nclaiming that the trial court erred in classifying certain\n\nproperty as marital property when the property should have been\n\nclassified as his separate property; that the trial court awarded\n\nhis wife, Clanetta Davis (“Wife”), a disproportionate share of\n\nthe marital property; and that the trial court failed to\n\nadequately direct the work of the court-appointed special master.\n\nWife, for her part, argues that she is entitled to a larger share\n\nof the marital property and that the trial court undervalued\n\ncertain marital assets to her disadvantage.           As an additional\n\nissue, she seeks attorney’s fees for a frivolous appeal.\n\n\n\n                           I.   General Overview\n\n\n\n            The trial court’s judgment dissolved a marriage of 33-\n\nplus years.    At the time of trial, Husband was 65 years of age.\n\nWife was 59.    The trial court found that Husband had physical\n\nproblems “which would likely make it impossible [for him]...to\n\nengage in gainful employment.”        Wife was in relatively good\n\nhealth “and should be able to work several more years.”             She is a\n\nschool teacher by profession.        The sole contested issue at trial\n\nwas the classification and division of the parties’ property.2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       The parties stipulated to the existence of grounds for divorce pursuant\nto the provisions of T.C.A. § 36-4-129 (1996 Repl.). Neither party sought\nalimony. There were no issues pertaining to the parties’ two children, both\nof whom are adults.\n\n                                      2\n\f                   II.   Trial Court’s Judgment\n\n\n\n          This case was tried before Judge Thomas J. Seeley, Jr.\n\nJudge Seeley filed an exhaustive, 34-page memorandum opinion, in\n\nwhich he addressed each asset of the parties.     He also examined\n\nthe division-of-property factors found at T.C.A. § 36-4-121(c)\n\nwith particular reference to the facts of this case.        He\n\nsegregated the parties’ property into the separate property and\n\nmarital property categories; awarded the separate property to the\n\nparty to whom it belonged; and then divided the marital property\n\nequally between the parties.\n\n\n\n          The final judgment, as subsequently modified by the\n\ntrial court, includes a detailed recapitulation schedule, which\n\nis attached as an exhibit to this opinion.     In summary, the trial\n\ncourt awarded the parties’ property as follows:\n\n\n\n                               Husband\n\n          Separate Property                $   686,917.07\n          50% of Marital Property              552,423.24\n\n                                           $1,239,340.31\n\n\n                                Wife\n\n          Separate Property                $    26,761.00\n          50% of Marital Property              552,423.23\n\n                                           $   579,184.23\n\n\n\n          The trial court was faced with a Herculean task in this\n\ncase of tracing assets, classifying property as separate or\n\nmarital, and attempting to unravel relatively complicated\n\nfinancial transactions and dealings.     Its task was made more\n\n                                  3\n\fdifficult by the machinations of Husband, as described by the\n\ntrial court in its excellent memorandum opinion:\n\n\n\n          The number of real properties involved\n          (presently some 20 parcels) and the different\n          manners in which title was acquired and\n          exists (deed; inheritance; inter vivos gift;\n          being held singly, jointly, in partnership\n          and some in trust) make classification\n          difficult. Jack Davis tried to retain\n          certain properties and monies as his separate\n          property. However, he commingled his\n          separate funds with marital funds and used\n          marital funds along with gifted funds to\n          acquire some of the properties he now claims\n          as his separate property. Further, Jack\n          Davis attempted to secrete several hundred\n          thousand dollars ($452,000) prior to his\n          filing for divorce. He gave $200,000 to one\n          friend in a plastic valise; he gave another\n          $100,000 to a second friend in a paper sack;\n          and placed $26,500 in his automobile’s spare\n          tire well. He put $25,500 in a roll of\n          carpet, which money disappeared. He claims\n          to have done this because he was concerned\n          that his son’s possible involvement with\n          drugs would subject all Mr. Davis’ property\n          to seizure by the government. The Court\n          considers this statement to be disingenuous.\n          On the contrary, Fred Steward, the friend to\n          whom Jack Davis gave $100,000, testified that\n          Mr. Davis asked him to keep the money because\n          he “foresaw a divorce” with Ms. Davis. This\n          is, the Court believes, the true reason Mr.\n          Davis attempted to hide those monies. Mr.\n          Davis established and moved monies in and out\n          of some 42 different bank accounts between\n          July 10, 1992, and December 31, 1995, in this\n          continuing effort. The Court felt it\n          necessary to appoint John Sanders, attorney\n          in Johnson City, as a Special Master to take\n          control of certain monies and to attempt to\n          track the financial maneuvering of Jack\n          Davis, which were so numerous and convoluted\n          that Sanders requested the Court for\n          authorization to hire an accountant for\n          assistance. David Frizzell, C.P.A., was\n          hired. Mr. Davis kept voluminous records and\n          notes regarding his transactions; however,\n          even relying solely on his word as to how\n          some monies were spent during the referenced\n          three and one-half year period, including the\n          disappearance of the $25,500, Jack Davis\n          still cannot account for over $83,000. The\n          total amount for which Mr. Davis has no\n\n                                4\n\f          documentation was $183,285.23. Mr. Davis’\n          actions in trying to secrete his holdings and\n          his financial (banking) manipulations have\n          frustrated the Court’s duty to classify\n          properties as separate or marital and then\n          equitably divide the parties’ marital assets.\n\n\n\n                     III.

Since Tenn.Code Ann. § 36-4-\n          121(a)(Supp. 1988) provides only for the\n          division of marital property, proper\n          classification of a couple’s property is\n          essential. See 3 Family Law and Practice §\n          37.08[1](1988). Thus, as a first order of\n          business, it is incumbent on the trial court\n          to classify the property, to give each party\n          their separate property, and then to divide\n          the marital property equitably. See 2 H.\n          Clark, The Law of Domestic Relations in the\n          United States § 16.2, at 183-84 (2d ed.\n          1987).\n\n          Tenn.Code Ann. § 36-4-121(b) contains the\n          ground rules for classifying property, and\n          little elaboration is needed beyond the\n          statute itself.\n\n                           *    *    *\n\n          In accordance with this statute, marital\n          property includes the increase in value of\n          separate property “if each party\n          substantially contributed to its preservation\n          and appreciation.” Ellis v.

We will now apply these principles to the facts of\n\nthis case.\n\n\n\n\n                        V.    Husband’s Issues\n\n\n                       A.    Unicoi County Farm\n\n\n            The parties were married on June 22, 1962.     In October,\n\n1977, the parties moved from Bristol to a farm in Unicoi County.\n\nAs the trial court noted, this property “was acquired by\n\n[Husband] from [his] family members in 1968 through a combination\n\nof deeds, litigation and inheritance.”       The property was titled\n\nsolely in Husband’s name.     Over the years, the property was\n\nimproved.    When the parties first moved to the farm, they lived\n\nin a “‘shack’ with no indoor plumbing” while their new residence\n\nwas being built.\n\n\n\n            Husband contends that only $80,000 of the value of the\n\nfarm found by the trial court, i.e., $225,000, should have been\n\ndesignated as marital property.        He argues that the trial court\n\nshould have classified $145,000 of the farm’s value as separate\n\nproperty rather than the $35,000 found by the trial court.       He\n\ntakes this position because, in the words of his brief, “the farm\n\nwas inherited by [him] to begin with.”       He concedes that Wife is\n\n                                   7\n\fentitled to share in that portion of the value of the farm\n\nrelated to improvements to the property “acquired by monies\n\nearned during the marriage.”    However, he claims that the bulk of\n\nthe appreciation in value of the property should be classified as\n\nHusband’s separate property because, so the argument goes, Wife\n\ndid not substantially contribute to the preservation and\n\nappreciation of the underlying separate property component of the\n\ntotal value.    In other words, Husband urges us to find that the\n\nonly marital component of the property’s value is composed of the\n\nadditions to its value occasioned by the infusions of marital\n\nincome during the marriage and the increase in value of those\n\nadditions.   He pegs this number at $80,000.\n\n\n\n          The trial court found that as of 1968 -- when the\n\nproperty was originally acquired by Husband from his family --\n\nthe underlying separate property interest in the farm was\n\nproperly valued at $35,000.    The evidence does not preponderate\n\nagainst this finding.    In fact, Husband testified that he paid\n\nonly $22,500 when he acquired the entire interest in 1968.    While\n\none of the appraisers assessed the value of the farm in 1968 at\n\n$52,500, both of the experts who testified regarding its value\n\n“stated that any appraisal of its value in 1968 would be highly\n\nspeculative.”\n\n\n\n          The trial court found that Wife “substantially\n\ncontributed to [the farm’s] preservation and appreciation.”     See\n\nT.C.A. § 36-4-121(b)(1)(B).    The court noted as follows:\n\n\n\n          Thus, the total property appreciated $190,000\n          over the years since 1968. Certainly a good\n\n                                  8\n\f            part of that appreciation would be simply\n            from inflation. However, without proper\n            maintenance and improvement, the farm would\n            not have increased nearly so much. Both\n            parties contributed to such improvements and\n            maintenance. The only substantial farm\n            activity conducted by either party was Ms.\n            Davis’ cattle raising. The grazing of cattle\n            contributes to the maintenance of the farm\n            and its appreciation in value. Ms. Davis\n            also did some plowing; did the gardening;\n            helped put up hay and did fencing. According\n            to both Mr. Davis and a neighbor, Lloyd\n            Garland, Ms. Davis was a “hard worker.”\n            Clanetta Davis has made substantial\n            contribution to the preservation and\n            appreciation of the farm.\n\n\n\n            The evidence does not preponderate against the trial\n\ncourt’s finding that all of the increase in value beyond the\n\ninitial separate property interest of $35,000 is marital\n\nproperty.\n\n\n\n                        B.   Bristol Property\n\n\n            The trial court concluded that property in Bristol\n\nworth $170,000 was properly classified as marital property.\n\nHusband takes the position that a portion of this property --\n\nvalued at $46,000 -- should be classified as separate property\n\nbecause the property “was purchased by [Husband] solely from\n\nmonies given him by his uncle.”       He claims that this $46,000\n\nincrement is his separate property because it was “acquired...by\n\ngift, bequest, devise or descent.”       See T.C.A. § 36-4-\n\n121(b)(2)(D).\n\n\n\n            The trial court considered Husband’s contention with\n\nrespect to the Bristol property but found that there was\n\n“insufficient proof to substantiate” his testimony that his uncle\n\n                                  9\n\fpaid for a portion of this property.    This dispute presented an\n\nissue of credibility to be resolved by the trial court.      It\n\nresolved that issue against Husband.    There is nothing in the\n\nrecord that is so compelling as to persuade us to ignore the\n\ntrial court’s credibility determination.    This being the case, we\n\ncannot say that the evidence preponderates against the trial\n\ncourt’s determination that the Bristol property is entirely\n\nmarital property.\n\n\n\n                    C.   Life Insurance Cash Value\n\n\n            The trial court found that Husband’s life insurance\n\npolicy, which had a cash value of $14,000, is a marital asset.\n\nHusband claims that the policy was purchased ten years prior to\n\nthe parties’ marriage and that $3,050 of the value of this asset\n\nat the time of the divorce should be classified as separate\n\nproperty.    This argument is said to be based on “[Husband’s]\n\ntestimony”; however, the brief does not cite us to the page of\n\nthe record where such testimony can be found.       Suffice it to say\n\nthat the record does not support Husband’s position.      The\n\nevidence does not preponderate against the trial court’s\n\nclassification of the entire cash value of the life insurance as\n\nmarital property.\n\n\n                    D.   Miscellaneous Cash Funds\n\n\n            The trial court found that the parties owned five bank\n\naccounts, the total value of which amounted to $13,740.63.        While\n\nthese accounts were all in Husband’s name, the trial court\n\nconcluded that they were marital property because of\n\n\n\n                                  10\n\f“commingling.”    These accounts are reflected in a report from\n\nDavid Frizzell, the C.P.A. who was hired by the special master.\n\n\n\n            Husband objects to the trial court’s finding that these\n\nbank accounts were a part of the marital estate because,\n\naccording to Husband’s brief, they “did not exist at the time of\n\ntrial.”    The record does not support Husband’s contention.    In\n\nview of Mr. Frizzell’s report, we cannot say that the evidence\n\npreponderates against the trial court’s determination with\n\nrespect to these miscellaneous bank accounts.\n\n\n                     E.    Special Master’s Report\n\n\n            Husband contends that the trial court erred in allowing\n\nthe special master “to file a report which did not encompass\n\nperiods after 1993.”      Even if this was error -- and we do not\n\nconcede that it was -- it did not affect the outcome of this\n\ntrial.    The trial court had a full hearing in this matter.    That\n\nhearing extended over four days and generated ten volumes of\n\ntestimony and 98 exhibits.      There is nothing in the record that\n\neven remotely suggests that the trial court refused to receive\n\nany relevant evidence.      On the contrary, the trial court heard\n\nsome 19 witnesses, and it is obvious that the parties were\n\nafforded an opportunity to fully present their respective\n\npositions.    If Husband thought that the special master’s report\n\nwas incomplete, he could have supplemented it by presenting\n\nrelevant evidence during the four-day trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                   11\n\f             There is no reversible error pertaining to the report\n\nof the special master.        See Rule 36(b), T.R.A.P.3\n\n\n\n                    VI.   Division of Marital Property\n\n\n\n             Both of the parties contend that the trial court’s\n\ndivision of property is not equitable.            Husband suggests a\n\ndifferent division.       His suggestion is based partially on his\n\nposition that the court erred in classifying certain assets as\n\nmarital rather than as his separate property.            We have previously\n\nheld that the trial court’s classifications are not in error.\n\nHence, to the extent that Husband’s proposal is based on these\n\nclassifications, it is rejected.            To the extent his proposal\n\nsimply suggests a different division of what the trial court\n\nfound to be marital assets, we do not agree that it is\n\nappropriate to modify the division decreed by the trial court.           A\n\ntrial court has wide discretion in dividing marital property.\n\nWatters v.

She also\n\ncontends that the trial court, when it divided the parties’\n\nmarital property, should have considered the fact that Husband\n\ndissipated marital assets.\n\n\n\n    3\n        Rule 36(b), T.R.A.P., provides as follows:\n\n             A final judgment from which relief is available and\n             otherwise appropriate shall not be set aside unless,\n             considering the whole record, error involving a\n             substantial right more probably than not affected the\n             judgment...\n\n                                       12\n\f          The trial court’s findings as to the value of the\n\nvarious assets are within the range of the “value” testimony\n\npresented at trial.   See Watters, 959 S.W.2d at 589.   In this\n\ncase, we find no error in the trial court’s determinations, i.e.,\n\nthe evidence does not preponderate against these findings.\n\n\n\n          As to the trial court’s overall division of property,\n\nwe do not find that the evidence preponderates against the trial\n\ncourt’s findings.\n\n\n\n\n                                13\n\f                          VII.
