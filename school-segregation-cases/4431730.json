After a bench\n\ntrial, the court rendered a judgment that contained certain findings, including a\n\nfinding that Wills violated the duty of loyalty owed by an employee to the\n\nemployer and competed with Ramin during the period of her active employment\n\nby Ramin; however, the trial court awarded Ramin no damages on the breach of\n\n                                       1\n\ffiduciary duty claim, finding insufficient evidence of damages and the court\n\nentered a take nothing judgment as to all of Ramin’s remaining claims against\n\nWills. The court also included a finding that Wills was not an exempt employee\n\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-19, that Wills was\n\nnot paid for her overtime work, that Ramin converted Wills’ personal property, and\n\nthat Wills should recover damages from Ramin. The trial court then rendered\n\njudgment in favor of Wills on her counterclaims against Ramin for failure to pay\n\novertime under the FLSA and for conversion of property, and awarded Wills\n\novertime compensation and liquidated damages under the FLSA, and damages for\n\nconversion of her property. Appellant, Ramin, asserts nine issues on appeal.\n\nAppellee, Wills, cross-appeals on a single issue. We affirm in part and reverse and\n\nremand in part.\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      The evidence at trial established that Ramin is a business located in\n\nMagnolia, Texas, which manufactures scientific glass. Wills began her\n\nemployment with Ramin in 2008, where Wills worked until her resignation on or\n\nabout June 14, 2011. Ramin filed an Original Petition on or about June 16, 2011,\n\nnaming Wills, Wilma Glass L.L.C. (Wilma Glass), and Miquel [sic] Martinez as\n\ndefendants, seeking a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and\n\n                                        2\n\fpermanent injunction, and asserting claims against the defendants for breach of\n\ntheir covenants not to compete and memorandum of employment agreement, for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy, tortious interference with prospective\n\nrelationships, unfair competition, business disparagement, and an accounting. The\n\ntrial court granted a Temporary Restraining Order on June 16, 2011. The trial court\n\nthen held a temporary injunction hearing and denied the temporary injunction on\n\nOctober 12, 2011. On October 26, 2012, Wills filed her Second Amended Answer\n\nand First Amended Counter-Claim, 1 wherein she asserted various defenses and a\n\ncounterclaim for Ramin’s failure to pay overtime under the FLSA, conversion and\n\ntheft, and retaliation, and she sought damages and attorney’s fees. Ramin filed a\n\nFirst Amended Petition on November 18, 2013, no longer naming Martinez as a\n\ndefendant but continuing to seek a recovery for the previously enumerated claims.\n\nRamin later filed a Second Amended Petition. The Second Amended Petition was\n\nthe live pleading on file at the time of trial. In the Second Amended Petition Ramin\n\nalleged a claim against Wills and Wilma Glass for breach of covenants not to\n\ncompete and a memorandum of employment agreement, for breach of fiduciary\n\nduty and conspiracy, tortious interference with “prospective relations,” unfair\n\ncompetition, business disparagement, and an accounting. In Ramin’s Second\n      1\n        The record on appeal does not include a copy of Wills’ original answer,\nfirst amended answer, or the original counterclaim, if any.\n                                         3\n\fAmended Petition, Ramin also included an affirmative defense that Wills was\n\nexempt from overtime compensation under the FLSA because “she was a\n\nmanagement employee and also an employee in an executive, administrative, or\n\nprofessional capacity . . . .” 2 The parties tried all issues to the court in a bench trial.\n\nTestimony of Ruth Wills\n\n       At trial and on appeal, the parties disagree on the nature and scope of Wills’\n\nprimary job duties at Ramin. Wills testified that her job duties included inside\n\nsales, that she was “not in a management position[,]” and that she “never had any\n\nauthority to be management.” She testified that her primary duty at Ramin was\n\n“[c]ustomer service” and that her specific duties included answering the phones,\n\ntaking orders, putting orders into the computer system, and shipping and ordering.\n\nWills stated that she did not manage or supervise any employees, she could not fire\n\nemployees, and she did not evaluate employees.\n\n       Wills testified that when she started working for Ramin her hourly rate was\n\nabout $13 an hour. She then received a raise in 2009 that increased her pay to $15\n\nan hour, and later her pay increased to $20 an hour. According to Wills, she\n\nworked for Ramin over forty hours a week because “[t]here was a lot to do[,]” and\n       2\n         The only other affirmative defense to Wills’ counterclaim that Ramin\nasserted in Ramin’s Second Amended Petition was the defense of “[r]es judicata\nand collateral estoppel.” Ramin did not include any argument or briefing on res\njudicata or collateral estoppel in its appeal.\n                                             4\n\fshe was not paid overtime compensation. Wills introduced into evidence a copy of\n\nher calendar with handwritten notes and a summary of her hours that she testified\n\ndepicted the hours she worked.3 Wills explained that when she first started\n\nworking at Ramin “on some occasions he -- they did give me some overtime pay.\n\nBut Brad said, No more overtime.” Wills testified that she worked an average of\n\n“47 hours a week[,] 45, 46[]” and that she worked five days a week, sometimes\n\nweekends, and sometimes from home at night.\n\n      Wills testified that three glassblowers for Ramin, including Miguel Martinez\n\n(Martinez), also worked as glassblowers for other businesses in addition to\n\nworking for Ramin, including work for Scientific Glass Products, a business that\n\nMartinez operated. Wills testified that, in October or November of 2010, Martinez\n\ninvited her to join a side business he operated with family members. She testified\n\nthat she agreed to join them, and together they formed Wilma Glass in December\n\n2010. Wills testified that Wilma Glass had revenues of about $30,000 and that it\n\nhad no profits during that time. Wills’ claim for unpaid overtime pertained to the\n\nyears 2009 through 2011. According to Wills, Wilma Glass ceased operating in\n\nJune 2011.\n\n      3\n       Ramin made an objection at trial to the calendar and summary worksheet\nwhich we will discuss in more detail in a subsequent section of our Memorandum\nOpinion.\n                                        5\n\f      Wills explained that Wilma Glass was doing business as Scientific Glass\n\nProducts. Wills further explained to the court that on the weekend before she\n\nstopped working at Ramin, she and Martinez moved some items to the Wilma\n\nGlass shop located on Frazier Street. Wills later returned to find the locks changed,\n\nand she looked through the window and could see that certain items were missing.\n\nWills made a list of the items that were taken and marked the items that personally\n\nbelonged to her and the items that belonged to Wilma Glass, and that exhibit was\n\nintroduced and admitted into evidence. Wills testified that “[a]ccording to Stacy\n\n[Collins,]” the president of Ramin and formerly the vice president of operations for\n\nRamin, the items had been removed by Stacy Collins, Jim Ramin’, Sue Ramin’,\n\nMartinez, another glassblower for Ramin, and counsel for Ramin.\n\nTestimony of Sue Ramin’\n\n      Sue Ramin’, the controlling owner of Ramin, testified that when Wills began\n\nworking at Ramin, her job duties included “[s]ales and phone and kind of getting\n\nacquainted with the office procedures.” Sue Ramin’ testified that about one year\n\nlater, Wills was promoted to office manager, and as office manager Wills had the\n\nresponsibility for shipping, inside sales, and information technology.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fTestimony of Stacy Collins\n\n      Stacy Collins (Collins) testified that when he started working for Ramin in\n\n2011, Wills’ job duties included scheduling, purchasing, and shipping, that Wills\n\nwas the “sales manager over the office administration IT[],” that two employees\n\nreported to Wills, and that she had the capability to hire and fire employees. On\n\ncross-examination, Collins admitted that he testified at the temporary injunction\n\nhearing in this case that, during the time he worked at Ramin, Wills did not provide\n\nperformance reviews to any employee, she did not supervise any employee, and\n\nshe did not hire or fire anyone. Collins testified that Wills asked him for overtime\n\npay in April or May of 2011, but he denied her request because “[s]he was exempt.\n\n. . . She made a salary. She had people reporting to her.” Ramin did not present any\n\ndocumentary evidence at trial to establish the number of hours Wills worked each\n\nweek, nor did Ramin specifically contest Wills’ testimony that sometimes she\n\nworked from home, at night, or on weekends.\n\nTestimony of Miguel Martinez\n\n      Martinez testified at trial that Wills was to “find customers” for Wilma Glass\n\nand also run the administrative side of the business, and “she knew people through\n\nRamin’” that could be customers for Wilma Glass. Martinez stated that Wilma\n\nGlass had a shop on Goodson Road from about February to June of 2011, that they\n\n                                         7\n\fmoved the shop to a location on Frazier Street in June of 2011, but they only\n\noperated out of the location on Frazier for “a couple of days.” Martinez testified\n\nthat he told Jim Ramin’, co-owner of Ramin, about the Wilma Glass shop on\n\nFrazier Street and that Martinez himself allowed some people with Ramin to go to\n\nthe Wilma Glass shop. Martinez testified that he opened the door to the Wilma\n\nGlass shop and people from Ramin walked into the shop, and that Martinez then\n\nobserved Ramin’s people take things out of the Wilma Glass shop, which included\n\nsome “boxes labeled with Jim Ramin’ labels[.]” According to Martinez, he also\n\nsaw them put the items from the shop on a truck and drive away with the items,\n\nand later he saw some of the items from the Wilma Glass shop in Jim Ramin’s\n\ngarage.\n\n        At trial, Ramin and Wills each agreed to submit their claims for attorney’s\n\nfees by affidavit to the court. After the bench trial, Wills’ attorney filed an affidavit\n\nin support of attorney’s fees with attached billing statements. The record includes\n\nno response or objection by Ramin to Wills’ attorney’s affidavit or billing\n\nstatements, nor does the record include any evidence that Ramin filed any motion\n\nor affidavit to controvert the fees or to support a request for Ramin’s attorney’s\n\nfees.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      The trial court entered a Final Judgment on March 10, 2014. In the Final\n\nJudgment, the court included the following language:\n\n             The Court finds that Ruth Wills, an employee of Ramin’,\n      violated the duty of loyalty owed by an employee to the employer and\n      competed with Ramin’ during the period of her active employment by\n      Ramin’; that there is insufficient evidence to establish damages\n      suffered by Ramin’ as a result of Wills’ actions; and the Court finds\n      Ramin’ should take nothing on Ramin’s claim for breach of fiduciary\n      duty.\n             The Court also finds that all remaining causes of action asserted\n      by Ramin’ were not supported by the [sic] sufficient evidence and\n      Ramin’ should take nothing on all of its remaining claims against both\n      Wills and Wilma Glass, LLC.\n             The Court finds that Wills was not an exempt employee under\n      the Fair Labor Standards Act; Wills was not paid for her overtime\n      work in the amount of $30,450.00; Wills is entitled to recover\n      liquidated damages from Ramin’ in the amount of $30,450.00;\n      Ramin’ converted Wills’ personal property that had a value of\n      $7,429.00; and finds that Wills should recover damages from Ramin’\n      for these amounts.\n             The Court finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish\n      the reasonable and necessary attorney fees for the claim of overtime\n      work and that Wills should take nothing on her claim for attorney\n      fees.\n\nThe court ordered that Ramin should “take nothing” on its claims against Wills and\n\nWilma Glass. The court awarded Wills the sum of $30,450 for unpaid overtime\n\nand an equal amount of $30,450 in liquidated damages, and the sum of $7,429 in\n\ndamages for the conversion of Wills’ property, and taxed all costs against Ramin.\n\n      Ramin filed a “Motion to Modify and Reform Judgment, Or, In the\n\nAlternative, Motion for New Trial[,]” arguing that the court should modify the\n                                         9\n\fFinal Judgment so that “Wills receives no reward for her breach of fiduciary\n\nduty[]” and arguing that “[t]here was no evidence to support the conversion claim.”\n\nThe trial court did not modify the Final Judgment. Neither party requested the trial\n\ncourt issue separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, and none were signed\n\nby the trial court. Ramin timely filed a Notice of Appeal. Wills cross-appealed\n\nsolely on the denial of attorney’s fees pertaining to her counterclaim for unpaid\n\novertime compensation.\n\n                                 ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n      In its first issue, Ramin argues that the trial court erred in concluding that\n\nWills was not an exempt employee under the FLSA. In its second and third issues,\n\nRamin argues that because the court found that Wills breached her fiduciary duty\n\nto Ramin, Wills should not have been permitted to “enjoy the profits of her\n\nbreach,” and that it was error to award Wills any damages for unpaid overtime\n\ncompensation. In its fourth and fifth issues, Ramin argues that the trial court erred\n\nin awarding Wills any damages for conversion because there was no evidence that\n\nRamin took or exercised dominion and control over Wills’ personal property, and\n\nthere was no evidence of the market value of the property at issue to support an\n\naward of damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      Ramin’s remaining issues pertain to the admission of evidence and the\n\nleading nature of certain questions. Ramin contends that the court erred in\n\nadmitting Will’s personal calendar, diary, and summaries thereof (issue six), in\n\nadmitting certain of Wills’ emails (issue seven); in admitting Wills’ list of market\n\nvalues of the property she alleged Ramin converted (issue eight), and in permitting\n\nWills’ attorney to utilize leading questions (issue nine).\n\n      Wills cross-appealed and stated only one issue, wherein she argues that the\n\ntrial court erred in failing to award her attorney’s fees on the successful\n\nprosecution of her counterclaim under the FLSA. Wills argues that an award of\n\nattorney’s fees is “mandatory” under the FLSA.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      When a bench trial is conducted and the court does not sign separate\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law to support its judgment, all facts necessary\n\nto support the judgment are implied. See BMC Software Belg., N.V. v. Marchand,\n\n83 S.W.3d 789, 795 (Tex. 2002); Zac Smith & Co. v. Otis Elevator Co., 734\n\nS.W.2d 662, 666 (Tex. 1987). The judgment must be affirmed if it can be upheld\n\non any legal theory that finds support in the evidence. In re W.E.R., 669 S.W.2d\n\n716, 717 (Tex. 1984). When the appellate record includes the reporter’s and clerk’s\n\nrecords, implied findings are not conclusive and may be challenged on the basis of\n\n                                          11\n\flegal and factual sufficiency. BMC Software Belg., N.V., 83 S.W.3d at 795. We\n\nreview the trial court’s decision for legal sufficiency of the evidence by the same\n\nstandards applied in reviewing the evidence supporting a jury’s finding. Catalina v.\n\nBlasdel, 881 S.W.2d 295, 297 (Tex. 1994). We review the evidence in the light\n\nmost favorable to the challenged finding and indulge every reasonable inference\n\nthat would support it. City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d 802, 822 (Tex. 2005).\n\nWe credit favorable evidence if a reasonable factfinder could and disregard\n\ncontrary evidence unless a reasonable factfinder could not. Id. at 827.\n\n      We review a trial court’s conclusions of law as a legal question. BMC\n\nSoftware Belg., N.V., 83 S.W.3d at 794. The appellant may not challenge the trial\n\ncourt’s legal conclusions based upon factual insufficiency, but the appellate court\n\ncan examine the trial court’s legal conclusion drawn from the facts in the record to\n\ndetermine whether the trial court made the correct legal conclusion. Id. When a\n\nparty challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence supporting an adverse finding\n\non an issue on which the party had the burden of proof, it must show that the\n\nevidence establishes as a matter of law all vital facts in support of the issue. Dow\n\nChem. Co. v. Francis, 46 S.W.3d 237, 241 (Tex. 2001) (per curiam).\n\n      In this case, the trial court did not issue separate findings of fact and\n\nconclusions of law but it did include certain findings in the Final Judgment. Under\n\n                                         12\n\fTexas Rule of Civil Procedure 299a, a trial court should not include its findings of\n\nfact in its judgment. See Tex. R. Civ. P. 299a (“Findings of fact shall not be recited\n\nin a judgment.”). There are no additional findings in the record other than those\n\ncontained in the Final Judgment. Therefore, there is nothing with which the trial\n\ncourt’s findings could conflict, and neither party contends on appeal that the trial\n\ncourt erred in including findings in the Final Judgment, nor do they argue that the\n\nFinal Judgment is in conflict with other findings of the trial court. Accordingly, for\n\npurposes of appeal we will accord such findings as set forth in the Final Judgment\n\nprobative value. See James J. Flanagan Shipping Corp. v. Del Monte Fresh\n\nProduce N.A., Inc., 403 S.W.3d 360, 364 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013,\n\nno pet.); see also Summers v. Dep’t of Crim. Justice, 256 S.W.3d 752, 754 n.1\n\n(Tex. App.—Beaumont 2008, no pet.) (for purposes of appeal, accepting the trial\n\ncourt’s unchallenged finding of fact contained in the judgment); In re Estate of\n\nJones, 197 S.W.3d 894, 900 n.4 (Tex. App.—Beaumont 2006, pet. denied) (“. . . if\n\nfindings are recited in the judgment, and no one complains or requests findings,\n\nand there is no conflict with separately filed findings of fact, the findings of fact in\n\nthe judgment should not be ignored on appeal. . . . Even if we reviewed the case as\n\nthough no express findings were made, we would presume all necessary findings to\n\nsupport the order.”) (citations omitted).\n\n                                            13\n\f               FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT EXECUTIVE EXEMPTION\n\n      In its first issue on appeal, Ramin argues that “the trial court’s conclusion\n\nthat Wills was not an exempt employee under the FLSA was error [as] a matter of\n\nlaw[.]” Ramin contends that Wills was an exempt employee under the “bona fide\n\nexecutive” exemption. According to Ramin, Wills was a sales manager and a “key\n\nmanagement employee” and therefore she was an “exempt employee” under the\n\nFLSA. Ramin contends that Wills (1) was paid at least $455 a week, (2) had the\n\n“primary duty” of management, (3) regularly directed the work of two or more\n\nemployees, and (4) had “the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose\n\nsuggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion\n\nor any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight.”\n\nTherefore, Ramin argues that Wills was not, as a matter of law, entitled to overtime\n\ncompensation under 29 U.S.C. § 207, and the trial court erred in awarding Wills\n\novertime compensation as well as liquidated damages under the FLSA.\n\n      Generally, the FLSA requires an employer to pay nonexempt employees\n\nwho work more than forty hours in a seven-day work week at a rate of not less than\n\none and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay for the overtime hours\n\nworked by the employee. See 29 U.S.C. § 207(a)(1); Thibodeaux v. Exec. Jet Int’l,\n\nInc., 328 F.3d 742, 749 (5th Cir. 2003); Vela v. City of Houston, 276 F.3d 659, 666\n\n                                        14\n\f(5th Cir. 2001); Allen v. Coil Tubing Servs., LLC, Civ. A. No. H-08-3370, 2011\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 119466, at *20 (S.D. Tex. Oct. 17, 2011). Under 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 216(b), an employer who violates provisions 206 or 207 of the FLSA shall be\n\nliable for “unpaid overtime compensation . . . and [] an additional equal amount as\n\nliquidated damages.” 29 U.S.C. § 216(b). The FLSA gives state courts jurisdiction\n\nto hear cases involving suits for overtime pay. Id.\n\n      We apply federal substantive law and Texas state procedural law when\n\nreviewing a claim brought under a federal statute. See In re Global Sante Fe Corp.,\n\n275 S.W.3d 477, 485 (Tex. 2008) (In a suit with claims pertaining to the Jones Act,\n\nthe Court stated when a state court hears the claim which is brought under a federal\n\nstatute, generally the state court follows federal substantive law and applies state\n\nprocedural law.). Determining whether or not Wills is entitled to overtime\n\ncompensation under the FLSA is a question governed by federal law.\n\n      The FLSA expressly provides that some employees may be exempt from\n\novertime. One of the exemptions outlined in Section 213(a)(1) is for an “employee\n\nemployed in a bona fide executive . . . capacity.”\n\n      § 213. Exemptions\n      (a) Minimum wage and maximum hour requirements. The provisions\n      of sections 6 (except subsection 6(d) in the case of paragraph (1) of\n      this subsection) and 7 [29 USCS §§ 206, 207] shall not apply with\n      respect to--\n\n                                         15\n\f            (1) any employee employed in a bona fide executive,\n            administrative, or professional capacity (including any\n            employee employed in the capacity of academic administrative\n            personnel or teacher in elementary or secondary schools), or in\n            the capacity of outside salesman (as such terms are defined and\n            delimited from time to time by regulations of the Secretary\n            . . .)[.]\n\n29 U.S.C. 213(a)(1).\n\n      An employee may qualify for such exemption if the employee is: (1)\n\ncompensated on a salary basis at a rate of not less than $455 per week; (2) has the\n\nprimary duty of management of the enterprise or a recognized department of the\n\nenterprise in which the employee is employed; (3) customarily and regularly\n\ndirects the work of two or more employees; and, (4) has the authority to hire and\n\nfire employees or whose suggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing,\n\nadvancement, promotion or any other change of status of other employees are\n\ngiven particular weight. 29 C.F.R. § 541.100(a). Exemptions under the FLSA are\n\nnarrowly construed against the employer, and the employer has the burden of\n\nproving that an employee is exempt. See Tyler v. Union Oil Co., 304 F.3d 379, 402\n\n(5th Cir. 2002) (citing Dalheim v. KDFW-TV, 918 F.2d 1220, 1224 (5th Cir.\n\n1990)).\n\n      An employee may hold multiple job responsibilities, and some may qualify\n\nas executive level tasks and others may not qualify as executive level tasks. 29\n\n                                        16\n\fC.F.R. § 541.106(a). The regulatory provisions focus upon the “primary duty” of\n\nthe employee. “Primary duty” is defined as follows:\n\n             (a) To qualify for exemption under this part, an employee’s\n      “primary duty” must be the performance of exempt work. The term\n      “primary duty” means the “principal, main, major or most important\n      duty that the employee performs. Determination of an employee’s\n      primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with\n      the major emphasis on the character of the employee’s job as a whole.\n      Factors to consider when determining the primary duty of an\n      employee include, but are not limited to, the relative importance of the\n      exempt duties as compared with other types of duties; the amount of\n      time spent performing exempt work; the employee’s relative freedom\n      from direct supervision; and the relationship between the employee’s\n      salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of\n      nonexempt work performed by the employee.\n             (b) . . . The amount of time spent performing exempt work can\n      be a useful guide in determining whether exempt work is the primary\n      duty of an employee. Thus, employees who spend more than 50\n      percent of their time performing exempt work will generally satisfy\n      the primary duty requirement. Time alone, however, is not the sole\n      test, and nothing in this section requires that exempt employees spend\n      more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt work.\n      Employees who do not spend more than 50 percent of their time\n      performing exempt duties may nonetheless meet the primary duty\n      requirement if the other factors support such a conclusion.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 541.700(a), (b).\n\n      Here, while Wills was paid more than $455 per week, she testified that she:\n\n(1) did not have the primary duty of management; (2) did not customarily and\n\nregularly direct the work of two or more employees, and (3) did not have the\n\nauthority to fire or evaluate employees or provide employment-related suggestions\n\n                                        17\n\fthat were given any particular weight. Wills also testified that her primary duty at\n\nRamin was customer service, and that she entered sales orders, invoiced sales\n\norders, completed filing, sent purchase orders to vendors, and answered phones.\n\nWills stated that she did not supervise glassblowers, did not manage sales, and did\n\nnot actively recruit new customers for Ramin. According to Wills, “everybody was\n\n[her] boss,” and she simply followed orders. On the other hand, according to\n\nRamin, Wills worked as the sales manager for Ramin until she resigned on June\n\n13, 2011. Ramin argued that Wills sent emails that referenced her position as a\n\n“sales manager.” According to Ramin, as sales manager, Wills managed the daily\n\noperations of Ramin, she supervised a number of employees including the\n\ncompany’s vice president of finance, she would oversee some of the\n\nmanufacturing, and Wills’ suggestions and recommendations on employment\n\ndecisions in the company were given particular weight.\n\n      As the factfinder in this case, the trial court was the sole judge of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses, and the trial court was entitled to resolve\n\ninconsistencies in the testimony by believing one witness and disbelieving others\n\nregarding the duties Wills performed. See McGalliard v. Kuhlmann, 722 S.W.2d\n\n694, 697 (Tex. 1986). The trial court could have believed Wills and disbelieved the\n\nRamin witnesses. The title that Wills may have had under her name on emails\n\n                                        18\n\fwherein she referred to herself as a “sales manager,” while probative, would not\n\nnecessarily be dispositive because “[a] job title alone is insufficient to establish the\n\nexempt status of an employee.” 29 C.F.R. § 541.2. The trial court found that Wills\n\nwas not an exempt employee under the FLSA. We conclude that the evidence is\n\nsufficient to support the conclusion reached by the trial court that Wills was not an\n\nexempt employee. See Tyler, 304 F.3d at 402-04.\n\n      An employer who violates the FLSA is liable for liquidated damages equal\n\nto the amount of unpaid overtime compensation unless the employer acted in\n\n“good faith” and had “reasonable grounds” to believe that its non-payment of\n\novertime complied with the law. See 29 U.S.C. § 260. The employer bears a\n\n“substantial burden” of demonstrating good faith and a reasonable belief that its\n\nactions did not violate the FLSA. See Bernard v. IBP, Inc. of Neb., 154 F.3d 259,\n\n267 (5th Cir. 1998). Good faith includes a duty to investigate potential liability\n\nunder the FLSA. See York v. City of Wichita Falls, Tex., 763 F. Supp. 876, 881\n\n(N.D. Tex. 1990). An employer may demonstrate its “good faith” if it acted with a\n\nmistaken, but reasonable, belief that its acts were in conformity with the law. Id.\n\n(citing Martinez v. Food City, Inc., 658 F.2d 369, 376 (5th Cir. 1981)).\n\n      Ramin includes a statement in its appellate brief that the trial court erred in\n\nawarding Wills liquidated damages. Ramin includes this statement within Ramin’s\n\n                                          19\n\fargument on appellate issue one regarding Wills’ “exempt status.” Ramin does not\n\nmake a separate challenge to the amount the trial court awarded in liquidated\n\ndamages. Ramin also does not argue that it acted in “good faith,” and Ramin does\n\nnot contend that it had “reasonable grounds” to believe that its actions were in\n\ncompliance with the overtime provisions of the FLSA. There is no indication in the\n\nrecord before us that Ramin offered evidence that it took steps to reasonably\n\ninvestigate its liability for the payment of overtime under the FLSA. Accordingly,\n\nwe conclude that the trial court did not err in awarding Wills liquidated damages.\n\nWe overrule Ramin’s first issue.\n\n                    FORFEITURE OR DISGORGEMENT OF PROFITS\n\n      Ramin briefed its second and third issues together, and we will address both\n\nissues together. Ramin argues that the trial court should not have awarded damages\n\nto Wills under the FLSA because such an award permitted her “to enjoy the profits\n\nof her breach of fiduciary duty to Ramin[.]” 4 Citing to Burrow v. Arce, 997 S.W.2d\n\n229 (Tex. 1999), Ramin contends that when a fiduciary breaches her trust, “she\n\nmust forfeit her ill-gotten gains[],” without regard to whether the breach resulted in\n      4\n         The trial court found that Wills “violated the duty of loyalty owed by an\nemployee to the employer[.]” But, due to insufficient evidence of damages, the\ntrial court found that “Ramin’ should take nothing on Ramin’s claim for breach of\nfiduciary duty.” Wills does not challenge the trial court’s finding that Wills\nbreached a duty of loyalty to Ramin.\n\n                                         20\n\fdamages, and that “the trial court went fully against the mandate of Texas law by\n\npermitting Wills to keep the wages she wrongfully received while directly\n\ncompeting with Ramin as well as awarding her overtime wages[.]” In response,\n\nWills argues that “profit disgorgement and wage forfeiture are equitable\n\nremedies[]” left to the discretion of the trial court and are not mandatory. 5\n\n      Forfeiture is an equitable remedy. Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 245. A party may\n\nseek forfeiture as a remedy for breach of a fiduciary duty, provided the party\n\nincludes a request for forfeiture in its pleadings. See Lee v. Lee, 47 S.W.3d 767,\n\n780-81 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied); Longaker v. Evans,\n\n32 S.W.3d 725, 733 n.2 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2000, pet. withdrawn)\n\n(explaining that Burrow v. Arce did not apply where a party sought damages\n\nresulting from a fiduciary’s misconduct and did not seek forfeiture). In its original\n\nand amended petitions, Ramin asserted that it was “entitled to disgorgement of any\n\ngross profits which Defendants received as a result of the breach [of fiduciary\n\n      5\n        Neither party argues that disgorgement and forfeiture are distinct remedies.\nTherefore, solely for purposes of our review in this appeal we will treat them\ntogether. See McCullough v. Scarbrough, Medlin & Assocs., Inc., 435 S.W.3d 871,\n904-05 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, pet. denied) (referring to “the equitable remedy\nof disgorgement or fee forfeiture”). The cases often use the terms interchangeably,\nbut there may be a distinction between disgorgement of “ill-gotten profit” and\nforfeiture of agreed compensation. George Roach, Texas Remedies in Equity for\nBreach of Fiduciary Duty: Disgorgement, Forfeiture, and Fracturing, 45 St.\nMary’s L.J. 367, 372-73 (2014).\n                                          21\n\fduty].” (emphasis added). Ramin did not include a request for forfeiture or that\n\nWills “forfeit” her overtime compensation. 6\n\n      We review a trial court’s decision granting or denying equitable relief for an\n\nabuse of discretion. See Wagner & Brown, Ltd. v. Sheppard, 282 S.W.3d 419, 428-\n\n29 (Tex. 2008). A trial court abuses its discretion when it acts without reference to\n\nany guiding rules or principles. See Downer v. Aquamarine Operators, Inc., 701\n\nS.W.2d 238, 241-42 (Tex. 1985).\n\n      Under the equitable remedy of disgorgement, a person who renders service\n\nto another in a relationship of trust may be denied compensation for her service if\n\nshe breaches that trust. See Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 237. The objective of the\n\nremedy is to return to the principal the value of what the principal paid because the\n\nprincipal did not receive the trust or loyalty from the other party. Id. at 237-38;\n\nMcCullough v. Scarbrough, Medlin & Assocs., Inc., 435 S.W.3d 871, 904 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Dallas 2014, pet. denied). The party seeking forfeiture and equitable\n\n\n\n\n      6\n        In its original and amended petitions, as part of Ramin’s claim for breach\nof fiduciary duty and conspiracy, Ramin asserted that it was “entitled to\ndisgorgement of any gross profits which Defendants received as a result of the\nbreach[].” Ramin did not plead forfeiture or disgorgement as an affirmative\ndefense to Wills’ counterclaim under the FLSA, nor did Ramin seek an offset, or\nassert any other equitable defenses to the FLSA counterclaim.\n                                         22\n\fdisgorgement need not prove damages as a result of the breach of fiduciary duty. 7\n\nBurrow, 997 S.W.2d at 240; Brock v. Brock, No. 09-08-00474-CV, 2009 Tex. App.\n\nLEXIS 5444, at *5 (Tex. App.—Beaumont July 16, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.).\n\n      Nevertheless, the remedy of forfeiture or equitable disgorgement for a\n\nfiduciary’s breach is dependent upon the facts and circumstances in each case. See\n\nBurrow, 997 S.W.2d at 241-42 (“Forfeiture of fees, however, is not justified in\n\neach instance in which a [fiduciary] violates a legal duty, nor is total forfeiture\n\nalways appropriate.”). It is within the discretion of the court whether the agent who\n\nhas committed a breach of trust shall receive full compensation or whether her\n\ncompensation shall be reduced or denied. Id. at 243. When exercising such\n\ndiscretion, the court may consider several factors, including (1) whether the agent\n\nacted in good faith; (2) whether the breach of trust was intentional or negligent or\n\nwithout fault; (3) whether the breach of trust related to the management of the\n\nwhole or related only to a part of the principal’s interest; (4) whether the breach of\n\ntrust by the agent occasioned any loss to the principal and whether such loss has\n\nbeen satisfied by the agent, (5) whether the services of the agent were of value to\n\nthe principal. Id. A court may also consider evidence of the fiduciary’s salary,\n      7\n        In the Final Judgment, the trial court found that Wills violated the duty of\nloyalty, but it concluded that the evidence was insufficient to establish any\nresulting damages to Ramin. On appeal, Ramin does not challenge the trial court’s\nfinding on this issue.\n                                         23\n\fprofits, or other income during the time the breach occurred. See McCullough, 435\n\nS.W.3d at 905.\n\n      Ramin relies heavily on Burrow, but we conclude that Burrow is factually\n\ndistinguishable from this case. Burrow dealt with an attorney’s breach of fiduciary\n\nduty to his client and a request that the attorney forfeit his attorney’s fees, whereas\n\nthe present case pertains to an employee’s breach of fiduciary duty to her\n\nemployer. 8 The attorney-client relationship is one of “‘most abundant good faith,’\n\nrequiring absolute perfect candor, openness and honesty, and the absence of any\n\nconcealment or deception.” Goffney v. Rabson, 56 S.W.3d 186, 193 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2001, pet. denied). In contrast, under Texas law, an employee\n\ndoes not owe an absolute duty of loyalty to her employer. See Johnson v. Brewer &\n\nPritchard, P.C., 73 S.W.3d 193, 201 (Tex. 2002). When a fiduciary relationship\n\n      8\n         In Burrow, the Court considered Kinzbach Tool Company v. Corbett-\nWallace Corporation, 160 S.W.2d 509 (Tex. 1942), which concerned an\nemployee’s alleged breach of fiduciary duty. See Burrow v. Arce, 997 S.W.2d 229,\n238-39 (Tex. 1999) (noting that in Kinzbach, “this Court held that an agent was\nrequired to forfeit a secret commission received from a conflicting interest even\nthough the principal was unharmed.”). In Kinzbach, the employer only sought\nforfeiture of a “secret commission” the employee had received from a third party in\ncompetition with the employer; the employer did not attempt to recoup any monies\nthat it owed the employee. See 160 S.W.2d at 573-74; see also Charles Silver, A\nCritique of Burrow v. Arce, 26 Wm. & Mary Envtl. L. & Pol’y Rev. 323, 333\n(2001) (“Kinzbach Tool actually stands for the unremarkable proposition that an\nagent who receives a hidden benefit when effecting a transaction must convey the\nbenefit to the principal.”).\n\n                                          24\n\fexists between an employee and employer, the employee has a duty to act\n\nprimarily for the benefit of the employer in matters connected with her agency. See\n\nid. at 200. Absent an agreement to the contrary, 9 an at-will employee may plan to\n\ncompete with her employer, may take active steps to do so while still employed,\n\nmay secretly join with other employees in a plan to compete with the employer,\n\nand has no general duty to disclose such plans. Id.; see also Abetter Trucking Co. v.\n\nArizpe, 113 S.W.3d 503, 510 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2003, no pet.).\n\nHowever, the at-will employee may not “act for his future interests at the expense\n\nof his employer or engage in a course of conduct designed to hurt his employer.”\n\nMcCullough, 435 S.W.3d at 904.\n\n      The equitable remedy of forfeiture is based upon the fact that the trustee has\n\nnot rendered or has not properly rendered the services for which compensation is\n\ngiven. Burrow, 997 S.W.2d at 238 (“When the compensation of the trustee is\n\nreduced or denied, . . . the reduction . . . is based upon the fact that the trustee has\n\nnot rendered or has not properly rendered the services for which compensation is\n\ngiven.”) (emphasis added). Similarly, disgorgement of profits requires the fiduciary\n\n      9\n        In its Second Amended Petition, Ramin alleged that Wills had signed a\nMemorandum of Employment Agreement that included a Covenant Not to\nCompete. However, Wills disputed that she ever signed such an agreement and\nRamin was unable to produce a signed agreement at trial or at the temporary\ninjunction hearing that preceded the trial on the merits.\n                                          25\n\fto yield to the beneficiary the profit or benefit gained during the time of the breach.\n\nAZZ Inc. v. Morgan, No. 02-14-00097-CV, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 3471, at **31-\n\n32 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth Apr. 9, 2015, no pet.) (To obtain disgorgement, “proof\n\nof the fiduciary’s salary, profits, or other income during the time of his breach of\n\nfiduciary duty is required[.]”) (emphasis added); Swinnea v.

Holloway, 368 S.W.2d 567, 576-77 (Tex. 1963)).\n\n      Wills testified that, in October or November of 2010, Martinez invited her to\n\njoin a side business he operated with family members. She testified that she agreed\n\nto join them, and together they formed Wilma Glass in December 2010. Wilma\n\nGlass ceased operating in June 2011. According to Wills, Wilma Glass had\n\nrevenues of about $30,000 and it had no profits. Wills’ claim for unpaid overtime\n\npertained to the years 2009, 2010, and 2011.10\n\n      10\n         The statute of limitations under the FLSA for unpaid minimum wage,\nunpaid overtime compensation, or “liquidated damages” is two years, unless the\nviolation was willful, and then the limitation period is three years. 29 U.S.C.\n                                          26\n\f      There is an absence of evidence in the record to establish that Wills’\n\novertime at Ramin was linked to or resulted from the work she was performing for\n\nWilma Glass or that she profited from the Wilma Glass venture. Wills’ claim for\n\nunpaid overtime spanned a period of about two and a half years, while her\n\ninvolvement with Wilma Glass spanned only about nine months during 2011.\n\nApplying the Burrow factors to determine whether the remedy of forfeiture or\n\ndisgorgement fits the circumstances, we conclude that there is an absence of\n\nevidence to establish that Wills’ breach of her fiduciary duty was directly\n\nconnected to her recovery of overtime, or that Ramin incurred any loss resulting\n\nfrom Wills’ breach, and there is no evidence that Wills’ services she performed for\n\nRamin during the overtime hours were of no value to Ramin. See Burrows, 997\n\nS.W.2d at 241. Consequently, we cannot say the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nfailing to require Wills to forfeit her damages for overtime that Ramin failed to\n\n\n\n\n§ 255(a); Kamat v.

Ramin raised no statute of\nlimitations defense at trial. Accordingly, the trial court could consider the full\nperiod of time in the record for which Wills sought unpaid overtime.\n\n                                        27\n\fpay. See AZZ, Inc., 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 3471, at **31-32.11 We overrule\n\nRamin’s second and third issues.\n\n      11\n          Additionally, we note that federal courts have been reluctant to allow an\nemployer to obtain a set-off in an FLSA overtime claim. The Fifth Circuit, for\nexample, has reaffirmed its position generally disallowing an employer to obtain a\nset-off or credit in an action to enforce the FLSA’s minimum wage and overtime\nprovisions. See Martin v. PepsiAmericas, Inc., 628 F.3d 738, 740-41 (5th Cir.\n2010) (“Generally speaking, courts have been hesitant to permit an employer to file\ncounterclaims[] in FLSA suits for money the employer claims the employee owes\nit, or for damages the employee’s tortious conduct allegedly caused.”) In Martin,\nPepsi raised the set-off issue as an affirmative defense to the overtime\ncompensation claims, rather than as a counterclaim. Pepsi argued that set-offs are\nappropriate in FLSA cases as long as they do not cause an employee’s wages to\nfall below the statutory minimum, and Pepsi relied upon the case of Singer v. City\nof Waco, 324 F.3d 813 (5th Cir. 2003), and several earlier district court opinions.\nThe Fifth Circuit rejected Pepsi’s argument, relying upon its opinion in Gagnon v.\nUnited Technisource, Inc., 607 F.3d 1036 (5th Cir. 2010), wherein the Court\nfurther clarified that the “longstanding prohibition of set-offs in FLSA cases is the\nrule in this circuit and Singer an exception.” Martin, 628 F.3d at 742. The Fifth\nCircuit stated “[w]e continue to look with disfavor on set-offs unless the money\nbeing set-off can be considered wages that the employer pre-paid to the plaintiff-\nemployee.” Id.\n        But note that other courts have allowed an employer’s counterclaims as a\nset-off to an employee’s claim under the FLSA. See, e.g., Dejesus v. Emerald\nCoast Connections of St. Petersburg, Inc., No. 8:10-cv-462-T-30TBM, 2010 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 68845, at **3-4 (M.D. Fla.

And in its eighth issue,\n\nRamin argues that the court erred in admitting Wills’ list of the values of the\n\npersonal property she claimed Ramin converted.\n\nDominion and Control\n\n      Conversion is the unauthorized and wrongful assumption and exercise of\n\ndominion and control over the personal property of another to the exclusion of, or\n\ninconsistent with, the owner’s rights. See Waisath v. Lack’s Stores, Inc., 474\n\nS.W.2d 444, 447 (Tex. 1971). A claim for conversion requires proof that (1) the\n\nclaimant owned or had possession of property, (2) the defendant unlawfully and\n\nwithout authorization assumed and exercised control and dominion over the\n\nproperty to the exclusion of the claimant, (3) the claimant demanded return of the\n\nproperty, and (4) the defendant refused to return the property. See Khorshid, Inc. v.\n\nChristian, 257 S.W.3d 748, 759 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2008, no pet.).\n\nprovides for certain offsets and credits without requiring an affirmative\ncounterclaim, allowing employer’s counterclaims in the interest of “judicial\neconomy and fairness[,]” but dismissing counterclaims for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted).\n                                         29\n\f      Ramin argues that there is no evidence “that Ramin exercised dominion or\n\ncontrol over any of the personal property she claimed disappeared” and that “there\n\nwas no evidence of the market value of the personal property items at the time of\n\nthe alleged conversion.” Because Ramin is attacking the legal sufficiency of the\n\nevidence supporting an adverse finding on an issue for which Ramin did not have\n\nthe burden of proof, Ramin must show that no evidence supports the trial court’s\n\nadverse finding. See Exxon Corp. v. Emerald Oil & Gas Co., 348 S.W.3d 194, 215\n\n(Tex. 2011) (citing Croucher v. Croucher, 660 S.W.2d 55, 58 (Tex. 1983)).\n\nEvidence is legally sufficient if it “‘would enable reasonable and fair-minded\n\npeople to reach the verdict under review[,]’ . . . credit[ing] favorable evidence if\n\nreasonable jurors could, and disregard[ing] contrary evidence unless reasonable\n\njurors could not.” Id. (quoting City of Keller, 168 S.W.3d at 827). We defer to the\n\ntrial court’s determination of credibility because, as the factfinder in a bench trial,\n\nthe trial court is the exclusive judge of the facts, the witnesses’ credibility, and the\n\nweight given to testimony. See Turner v. KTRK Television, Inc., 38 S.W.3d 103,\n\n120 (Tex. 2000); Woods v. Woods, 193 S.W.3d 720, 726 (Tex. App.—Beaumont\n\n2006, pet. denied) (“The trial judge as factfinder was the sole judge of the\n\nwitnesses’ credibility and the weight to be given their testimony.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                          30\n\f      Wills testified that her personal property as well as property belonging to\n\nWilma Glass was in boxes in the shop on Frazier Street, and photographs were\n\nadmitted into evidence that depicted the items that were in the shop on Frazier.\n\nWills also testified that the items went missing from the shop in June 2011. She\n\nexplained that one day she arrived at the shop and she was locked out, but she\n\ncould see through the window and side door that the shop was empty and “there\n\nwas nothing left.” Wills testified that it was her belief based on information from\n\nStacy Collins that a group of Ramin employees, including Collins, Jim Ramin’,\n\nSue Ramin’, Martinez, and another glassblower for Ramin, took items belonging to\n\nWills and Wilma Glass. Wills also testified that she believed that at least some of\n\nthe property removed from the shop on Frazier Street was in Jim Ramin’s garage.\n\nMartinez testified that he told Jim Ramin’ about the shop on Frazier, that Martinez\n\nunlocked the shop for people from Ramin, that people from Ramin took things out\n\nof the shop, that Martinez saw these same people put the items in a truck and drive\n\naway, and that he later saw the items in Jim Ramin’s garage. Collins indicated that\n\n“the stuff that is sitting in Jim Ramin’s garage” was removed from Wilma Glass\n\nbut according to Collins the items consisted of products made by Ramin.\n\n      The trial court as the fact finder could have believed Wills’ and Martinez’s\n\ntestimony and disregarded Collins’ testimony. Considering the evidence and\n\n                                        31\n\ftestimony at trial in the light most favorable to the finding under review, we\n\nconclude there is sufficient evidence that Ramin exercised dominion and control\n\nover property that belonged to Wills.\n\nEvidence of Damages\n\n      In its fifth issue, Ramin argues that the trial court erred in awarding\n\nconversion damages to Wills because there was no evidence of the market value of\n\nthe property at the time of the alleged conversion. In its eighth issue, Ramin argues\n\nthat the court erred in admitting Wills’ list of values of the property she claimed\n\nRamin converted because Wills failed to establish a predicate for such values.\n\n      We review the admission of evidence for an abuse of discretion. See U-Haul\n\nInt’l, Inc. v. Waldrip, 380 S.W.3d 118, 132 (Tex. 2012). A trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion when it acts without reference to any guiding rules or principles. See E.I.\n\ndu Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc. v. Robinson, 923 S.W.2d 549, 558 (Tex. 1995);\n\nDowner, 701 S.W.2d at 241-42. Even if the trial court abused its discretion in\n\nadmitting certain evidence, reversal is only appropriate if the error was harmful\n\nand probably resulted in an improper judgment. See U-Haul, 380 S.W.3d at 132;\n\nTex. R. App. P. 44.1, 61.1.\n\n      Generally, the measure of damages in a conversion case is the fair market\n\nvalue of the property converted at the time of the conversion and legal interest\n\n                                         32\n\fthereon. See United Mobile Networks, L.P. v. Deaton, 939 S.W.2d 146, 147-48\n\n(Tex. 1997). “Fair market value has been defined as ‘the price which the property\n\nwould bring when it is offered for sale by one who desires, but is not obliged to\n\nsell, and is bought by one who is under no necessity of buying it.’” Burns v.\n\nRochon, 190 S.W.3d 263, 270 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.)\n\n(quoting City of Austin v. Cannizzo, 267 S.W.2d 808, 815 (Tex. 1954)). A property\n\nowner may testify about the market value of his property if his testimony shows\n\nthat he is familiar with the market value and his opinion is based on that market\n\nvalue, and not entirely speculative. See Nat. Gas Pipeline Co. of Am. v. Justiss, 397\n\nS.W.3d 150, 157-59 (Tex. 2012); Redman Homes v. Ivy, 920 S.W.2d 664, 669\n\n(Tex. 1996) (“A property owner is qualified to testify to the market value of his\n\nproperty.”); Khorshid, Inc., 257 S.W.3d at 760.\n\n      Wills offered into evidence at trial a list of the items that she claimed Ramin\n\ntook, along with a value assigned to each item. Ramin objected based on hearsay\n\nand relevance, stating “I don’t even know what that monetary amount is, if it’s fair\n\nmarket value, if it’s purchase price, whatever it is. But it’s hearsay either way.”\n\nThe court overruled Ramin’s objections and admitted the evidence. During the\n\ntestimony, the following exchange occurred between Wills and her attorney:\n\n\n\n\n                                         33\n\f      [ATTORNEY]: As the owner of those items were you familiar with\n      what the value, the fair market value of those items were at the time\n      that you last saw them at the shop?\n\n      [WILLS]: Yes.\n\n      [ATTORNEY]: And are the numbers that are written down,\n      corresponding to the items, the fair market value at the time that you\n      last saw them at the shop?\n\n      [WILLS]: Yes.\n\n      [ATTORNEY]: The items that are marked for Wilma Glass, can you\n      tell the Court why those items are on this list?\n\n      [WILLS]: They were bought and paid for by Wilma Glass. And they\n      were at the shop when I last saw them.\n\n      [ATTORNEY]: When you went back were they at the shop?\n\n      [WILLS]: No.\n\n      [ATTORNEY]: As one of the members of Wilma Glass LLC, were\n      you familiar with what the fair market value of these items were?\n\n      [WILLS]: Yes.\n\n      [ATTORNEY]: And do the numbers reflected on Defendants’ Exhibit\n      130 highlighted for Wilma Glass, do those numbers reflect the fair\n      market value of those items at the time that you last saw them?\n\n      [WILLS]: Yes.\n\nRamin then objected on the basis that there was a lack of a predicate. Counsel for\n\nRamin took Wills on voir dire, asking what Wills did to ascertain the fair market\n\nvalue of an oven. Wills testified that she “looked at Craigslist” to determine its\n                                       34\n\fvalue. When Ramin began to ask about the heaters on Wills’ list, the trial court\n\njudge interjected, “[a]ll right[,] [l]et’s not go through every item. . . . Just ask a\n\nglobal question for us.” Citing to Porras v. Craig, 675 S.W.2d 503 (Tex. 1984),\n\nRamin argued to the trial court that “the predicate is that there has to be an\n\nascertainment of fair market value, not intrinsic value, not purchase price, and\n\nthere has to be a market that the witness actually used.” The trial court noted that\n\n“she’s also an owner who can testify as to value[]” and the court instructed counsel\n\nfor Ramin to ask Wills “a global question about all items on the list for purposes of\n\nvoir diring the witness[.]” Ramin asked Wills “did you look on Craigslist for the\n\nvalue of every single item that is on Defendants’ Exhibit 130?” Wills replied “I\n\nlooked at the Internet on various sites. I looked at my receipts for my personal\n\nstuff, yes.” Ramin objected to the response as “[n]on-responsive[,]” and the trial\n\ncourt sustained the objection and stated “I believe, though, that the witness has\n\nsatisfied the requirements for the testimony as to how she’s determined the value.”\n\nWills testified that she was the property owner and that she was familiar with the\n\nmarket value of the property at issue, and she included testimony about the amount\n\nshe paid for the items and then described her search for similar items on the\n\ninternet. Wills also testified that the total value of the items that belonged to her\n\nwas approximately $7,500. Wills agreed that the value of items that belonged to\n\n                                         35\n\fWilma Glass that had not been returned to her was “about 38 or $39,000[.]” We\n\nfind that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the objection of\n\nRamin and in admitting the testimony from Wills about the value of her property.\n\nSee Nat. Gas Pipeline, 397 S.W.3d at 155. With respect to the trial court’s\n\nadmission of the list, Wills testified that the total value of the items that belonged\n\nto her was “approximately $7,500[,]” and the list was merely cumulative of Wills’\n\ntestimony, and any error was harmless. See Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. v.\n\nMalone, 916 S.W.2d 551, 557 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1996), aff’d, 972\n\nS.W.2d 35 (Tex. 1998). We conclude there was legally sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the trial court’s judgment awarding Wills $7,429 for the conversion of her\n\npersonal property by Ramin. We overrule Ramin’s fourth, fifth, and eighth issues.\n\n                     EVIDENCE OF OVERTIME HOURS WORKED\n\n      In issues six and seven, Ramin argues the trial court erred in admitting\n\nDefendant’s Exhibit 109, Wills’ desk calendars or planners wherein she claimed\n\nshe kept notes of her hours worked and a spreadsheet summary thereof, and\n\nDefendant’s Exhibit 120, which included emails between Ruth Wills, Stacy\n\nCollins, and other Ramin representatives and employees. Ramin contends that\n\nWills’ desk calendars, the spreadsheet summary, and the emails are all hearsay\n\n\n\n\n                                         36\n\foutside of any exception to the hearsay rule and that the trial court erred in\n\nadmitting them into evidence.\n\n      The FLSA obligates employers to keep accurate records of the hours\n\nemployees work. See 29 U.S.C. § 211(c). “[W]here an employer keeps incomplete\n\nor inaccurate records, ‘an employee has carried out [her] burden if [s]he proves\n\nthat [s]he has in fact performed work for which [s]he was improperly compensated\n\nand if [s]he produces sufficient evidence to show the amount and extent of that\n\nwork as a matter of just and reasonable inference.’” Williams v. IBEW, Local 520,\n\n298 F.3d 458, 463 (5th Cir. 2002) (quoting Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,\n\n328 U.S. 680, 687-88 (1946)); see also Skipper v. Superior Dairies, Inc., 512 F.2d\n\n409, 420 (5th Cir. 1975). Once the employee has met this burden, “[t]he burden\n\nthen shifts to the employer to come forward with evidence of the precise amount of\n\nwork performed or with evidence to negative the reasonableness of the inference to\n\nbe drawn from the employee’s evidence.” Anderson, 328 U.S. at 687-88; Skipper,\n\n512 F.2d at 420. A claimant need not prove each hour of overtime with “‘unerring\n\naccuracy or certainty.’” See Garner v. Chevron Phillips Chem. Co., L.P., 834 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 528, 546-47 (S.D. Tex. 2011) (quoting Prince v. MND Hospitality, Inc.,\n\nCiv. A. No. H-08-2617, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 61637, at *17 (S.D. Tex. July 20,\n\n2009)). Evidence from the employee may include the employee’s own testimony\n\n                                       37\n\fas to when and how many overtime hours she worked. See Garner, 834 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 547.\n\n      In support of her claim for overtime hours worked, Wills testified that she\n\nworked an average of about seven and a half hours of overtime each week in 2009\n\nand in 2010 and that she worked an average of about five hours of overtime each\n\nweek in 2011. She also testified that she requested to be paid for her overtime, and\n\nthat she made the request for overtime by email to Collins. And Collins admitted in\n\nhis testimony that Wills made a request to be paid overtime.\n\n      Wills offered her personal desk calendars from 2009 through 2011. Wills\n\ntestified that she made notes about the hours she worked in the desk calendars.\n\nWhen Wills’ attorney offered the desk calendars into evidence, counsel for Ramin\n\nobjected, saying “Your Honor, I object. Hearsay. Filled with it.” Wills’ attorney\n\nresponded that “we are offering it only for the notation regarding the hours that she\n\nworked.” Upon examination by her attorney, Wills testified that she recorded the\n\nhours she worked on a daily basis, she made the notation in her calendars “[o]n the\n\nsame date” as she worked the hours, and the information in her calendars regarding\n\nher hours worked was true and correct and within her personal knowledge. She\n\ntestified that the spreadsheet she offered into evidence included the “start time,\n\nlunch out, lunch in, and total hours, hours worked, and overtime hours[],” and that\n\n                                         38\n\fthe spreadsheet was based upon a true and correct copy of her actual planners or\n\ncalendars. After Wills’ testimony regarding her personal calendars, her attorney\n\noffered the calendars and spreadsheet into evidence “for the limited purpose of\n\nshowing the hours that she worked[.]” Ramin objected again as follows:\n\n             Your Honor, first of all, . . . the so-called predicate that they\n      have laid doesn’t even meet any exception to hearsay.\n             Second of all, the Excel spreadsheet, . . . obviously were [sic]\n      created after the fact and they are not even part of the planner. And so\n      it is hearsay and outside of any exception. And these documents\n      obviously weren’t even created at the same time as the planners were,\n      these Excel spreadsheets.\n\nThe trial court overruled Ramin’s objection and admitted the calendars and the\n\nspreadsheet summaries “as a shorthand rendition of the information contained\n\ntherein.” Ramin offered no testimonial or documentary evidence to contradict\n\nWills’ evidence of the number of hours Wills claimed she worked.\n\n      In its brief, Ramin argues that Wills’ personal calendars or diaries were not\n\nadmissible under any exception to the hearsay rule because there was “nothing\n\nsystematic about Wills’ calendar book, as it contained randomness of entries all in\n\nWills’ handwriting. No regularly conducted activity of a business or organization\n\nappears in that document and Wills’ counsel never seemed even to make such\n\nargument at trial.” Wills argues on appeal that the planners contained within\n\nExhibit 109 were offered only as the basis for the tabulations and summaries of\n\n                                        39\n\fhours worked 12 that she included within the spreadsheet in Exhibit 109, and that it\n\nwas merely cumulative of Wills’ other testimony. Wills does not argue that the\n\nplanner or calendar met any exception to the hearsay rule.\n\n      Even if we assume without deciding that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nExhibits 109 and 120, we conclude that the items were cumulative of Wills’ other\n\ntestimony at trial where she testified that she worked an average of about seven\n\nand a half hours of overtime each week in 2009 and in 2010, and that she worked\n\nan average of about five hours of overtime each week in 2011. An erroneous\n\nadmission of evidence that is merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence is\n\nharmless. See Owens-Corning Fiberglas, 916 S.W.2d at 557. Additionally, we\n\nconclude, based upon the record before us, that the trial court’s admission of the\n\ndocuments in question in this bench trial was harmless error. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.1(a).

But is it your testimony for this Court that you\n      worked, you averaged about 7 and a half hours of overtime each week\n      in 2009 and in 2010?\n\n      [RAMIN’S ATTORNEY]: I object. Leading.\n\n      [THE COURT]: All right. I’m going to overrule the objection. You\n      can answer the question.\n\n      [WILLS]: Yes, ma’am.\n\n      [WILLS’ ATTORNEY]: And did you work an average of five hours\n      per week of overtime in 2011?\n\n      [RAMIN’S ATTORNEY]: I object. Leading.\n\n      [THE COURT]: Overruled.\n\n      [WILLS]: Yes, ma’am.\n\n      Texas Rule of Evidence 611(c) prohibits leading questions on direct\n\nexamination “except as necessary to develop the witness’s testimony.” Tex.

Under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b),\n\n“[t]he court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the\n\n[employee] plaintiff or [employees] plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney’s fee to\n\nbe paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.” Wills argues that an award of\n\nattorney’s fees to the prevailing party on a claim under the FLSA is mandatory,\n\nand that the trial court “had no discretion to deny [attorney’s] fees in their\n\n                                        43\n\fentirety.” Ramin argues that the evidence of attorney’s fees was legally insufficient\n\nto support an award because Wills’ attorney’s affidavit does not establish that the\n\namounts submitted are reasonable or necessary, Wills’ attorney failed to segregate\n\nfees as between Wills and Martinez, whom she also represented in the lawsuit, and\n\nthe invoices do not segregate the services provided as to the various claims and\n\ndefenses at issue in the litigation. The parties do not dispute that Wills was a\n\nprevailing party as to her FLSA counterclaim. In the final judgment, the trial court\n\nfound “there is insufficient evidence to establish the reasonable and necessary\n\nattorney fees for the claim of overtime work and . . . Wills should take nothing on\n\nher claim for attorney fees.”\n\n      Under Texas law, a prevailing party who is entitled to attorney’s fees on one\n\nbut not all of her claims would be required to “segregate fees between claims for\n\nwhich [attorney’s fees] are recoverable and claims for which they are not.” Tony\n\nGullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, 212 S.W.3d 299, 311 (Tex. 2006). Failure to\n\nsegregate, though, does not result in the denial of any fee award. Id. at 314; see\n\nalso Citibank (S.D.), N.A. v.

See Kamat, 420 S.W.3d at 910 (The household employee was\nawarded nothing for attorney’s fees although she was a prevailing party on her\nFLSA minimum wage claim.

See Purcell v. Seguin\n\nState Bank and Trust Co., 999 F.2d 950, 961 (5th Cir. 1993) (reviewing a case\n\nunder the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, which incorporates remedies\n\nauthorized under the FLSA). The resulting amount is the “lodestar” figure. See\n\nGuity, 54 S.W.3d at 528. Both the number of hours and the hourly rate must be\n\nreasonable, and the court should consider only the hours spent on the successful\n\nclaims. See Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 433-34, 440 (1983). The fee\n\napplicant bears the burden of proof on reasonableness. See Black, 732 F.3d at 502.\n\nAfter calculating the lodestar figure, the trial court may adjust the amount upward\n\nor downward upon consideration of certain additional factors: (1) the time and\n\nlabor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the legal questions; (3) the skill\n\nrequired to perform the legal service properly; (4) preclusion of other employment\n      14\n         We expressly do not decide whether the issue of attorney’s fees under the\nFLSA must be determined by the trial court as compared to a jury. That issue is not\ncurrently before us. See generally Bill Miller Bar-B-Q Enters. v. Gonzales, No. 04-\n13-00704-CV, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS 11796, at **5-14 (Tex.

See Johnson v. Ga. Highway Express, Inc., 488 F.2d\n\n714, 717-19 (5th Cir. 1974).\n\n      A critical factor in determining an award of attorney’s fees is the degree of\n\nsuccess obtained. See Black, 732 F.3d at 503. Where a party has achieved only\n\npartial success, the product of hours reasonably expended on the litigation as a\n\nwhole multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate may be an excessive amount. See\n\nSaizan v. Delta Concrete Prods. Co., Inc., 448 F.3d 795, 801 (5th Cir. 2006). A\n\nparty is not entitled to attorney’s fees for the prosecution of an unsuccessful claim\n\nunless it involves common facts or it derives from related legal theories of another\n\nclaim that is successfully prosecuted. See Williams v. Kaufman Cnty., No. 3:97-\n\nCV-0875-L, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5974, at **8-9, 21 (N.D. Tex. Apr. 9, 2003)\n\n(citing Hensley, 461 U.S. at 434). The trial court should identify unsuccessful\n\nclaims that are “wholly unrelated to successful claims” and exclude the hours\n\nassociated with such unsuccessful claims. See Chemical Mfrs. Ass’n v.

The applicant\n\n. . . should maintain billing time records in a manner that will enable a reviewing\n\ncourt to identify distinct claims.” Hensley, 461 U.S. at 437. To establish that the\n\namount of time expended on a matter is reasonable, the applicant can only meet his\n\nburden by presenting evidence that is adequate for a court to determine what hours\n\nshould be included in the award. See Bode v. United States, 919 F.2d 1044, 1047\n\n(5th Cir. 1990). Applicants may need to produce billing records or other evidence\n\nadequate to show the hours worked and rates claimed. See Hensley, 461 U.S. at\n\n433; La. Power & Light Co. v. Kellstrom, 50 F.3d 319, 324 (5th Cir. 1995).\n\n      At trial, Ramin and Wills agreed to submit their claims for attorney’s fees by\n\naffidavit to the court. Wills submitted an affidavit dated February 19, 2014, from\n\nher attorney outlining the hourly rate, total fees, and providing line-item bills with\n\nredacted descriptions of the legal services performed. In the attorney’s affidavit,\n\nWills’ attorney stated that her fees were recoverable under several theories, except\n\n                                         49\n\ffor “about 3 hours of work solely for the defense of the breach of fiduciary duty\n\nclaims.” The attorney stated that all of the remainder of the time was “inextricably\n\nintertwined with claims for which attorneys’ fees are recoverable.” Wills’ attorney\n\nprovided no estimate in her affidavit regarding the number of hours or percentage\n\nof her time that was attributable solely to her FLSA counterclaim, nor did she\n\nspecifically include a statement that certain discrete legal services advanced both\n\nrecoverable and unrecoverable claims, but she did specifically allege that with the\n\nexception of “about 3 hours of work solely for the defense of the breach of\n\nfiduciary duty . . . the remainder of the time was inextricably intertwined with\n\nclaims for which attorney’s fees are recoverable.” 15 The trial court included a\n\nfinding in the Final Judgment that “there is insufficient evidence to establish the\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney fees for the claim of overtime work and that\n\nWills should take nothing on her claim for attorney fees.”\n\n      15\n           The relevant portion of Wills’ attorney’s affidavit states that\n\n      [f]ees are recoverable for Ms. Wills’ claim for violations of the Texas\n      Theft Liability Act, for her overtime claim, and for the defense of an\n      overly broad non-compete agreement with the exception of about 3\n      hours of work solely for the defense of the breach of fiduciary duty\n      claims. The remainder of the time was inextricably intertwined with\n      claims for which attorneys’ fees are recoverable.\n              The claims related to the non-compete, over-time, and theft\n      liability claims are so intertwined with the remainder of the claims\n      and defenses that they cannot be segregated.\n                                            50\n\f      The general rule regarding the recovery of fees in Texas is that “fee\n\nclaimants have always been required to segregate fees between claims for which\n\nthey are recoverable and claims for which they are not.” Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at\n\n311. In Chapa, the Court stated:\n\n      Intertwined facts do not make tort [attorney’s] fees recoverable; it is\n      only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n      unrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be\n      segregated. We modify Sterling to that extent.\n\nId.at 313-14. When multiple causes of action are asserted, some of which allow fee\n\nrecovery and some of which do not, then evidence of time or money necessary\n\nonly to the litigation of claims for which attorney’s fees are not recoverable must\n\nbe segregated from evidence of the reasonable amount of time or money necessary\n\nfor the performance of legal services necessary to litigate claims for which\n\nattorneys’ fees are recoverable. Id. If a particular legal service was necessary to\n\nlitigate a cause of action for which attorney’s fees are recoverable, such fees are\n\nnot rendered unrecoverable merely because they also advance a claim for which\n\nattorney’s fees would not be otherwise available. See In re Lesikar, 285 S.W.3d\n\n577, 585 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] May 7, 2009, orig. proceeding). In\n\nother words, if any of the component tasks relate solely to a cause of action for\n\nwhich legal fees are not recoverable, then those fees must be segregated and are\n\nnot recoverable. Id. at 583 (quoting 7979 Airport Garage, L.L.C. v. Dollar Rent A\n                                        51\n\fCar Sys., 245 S.W.3d 488, 509 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet.\n\ndenied)).\n\n      A party seeking an award of attorney’s fees bears the burden of proof on a\n\nclaim that her attorney’s legal services advanced both recoverable and non-\n\nrecoverable claims and that no segregation is required.

A\n\ncourt must “examine the facts alleged in support of the claims to determine\n\nwhether they are inextricably intertwined, and if the prosecution or defense does\n\nnot entail proof or denial of essentially the same facts, the exception [to the\n\nrequirement to segregate fees] does not apply.” Fix It Today, LLC v.

See Bode, 919 F.2d at\n\n1052 (“[B]ecause the [appellants] are only partly successful . . . , it is not proper to\n\nreimburse them for 100% of their . . . fees.”).\n\n      At trial, Wills prevailed on her claim under the FLSA. Section 216(b)\n\nexpressly provides that Wills, as a prevailing party, shall be entitled to seek a\n\nrecovery of her reasonable attorney’s fees that she incurred in pursuing her claim\n\nfor unpaid overtime compensation and liquidated damages relating thereto.\n\nHowever, Wills is not entitled to be reimbursed for all of her attorney’s fees\n\nbecause she was not successful on other claims and some of her claims do not\n\nallow for a recovery of attorney’s fees. See id.\n\n      Upon examining the record before us, we note that Wills filed pleadings that\n\nspecifically related both to her FLSA claim and the defense of Ramin’s claims, as\n\nwell as the prosecution of other counterclaims. Wills’ unsegregated fees, time\n\nentries, as well as the testimony at trial, and the attorney’s fee affidavit, provide at\n\nleast some evidence which would support allowing a recovery of some of the fees.\n\n                                          53\n\fSee Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314 (“Unsegregated attorney’s fees for the entire case\n\nare some evidence of what the segregated amount should be.”). We conclude that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion in failing to award some amount to Wills for\n\nattorney’s fees, and the appropriate disposition of this case is to reverse that\n\nportion of the judgment stating that Wills should take nothing on her claim for\n\nattorney’s fees and remand the attorney’s fees issue to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.

After a bench\n\ntrial, the court rendered a judgment that contained certain findings, including a\n\nfinding that Wills violated the duty of loyalty owed by an employee to the\n\nemployer and competed with Ramin during the period of her active employment\n\nby Ramin; however, the trial court awarded Ramin no damages on the breach of\n\n                                       1\n\ffiduciary duty claim, finding insufficient evidence of damages and the court\n\nentered a take nothing judgment as to all of Ramin’s remaining claims against\n\nWills. The court also included a finding that Wills was not an exempt employee\n\nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 201-19, that Wills was\n\nnot paid for her overtime work, that Ramin converted Wills’ personal property, and\n\nthat Wills should recover damages from Ramin. The trial court then rendered\n\njudgment in favor of Wills on her counterclaims against Ramin for failure to pay\n\novertime under the FLSA and for conversion of property, and awarded Wills\n\novertime compensation and liquidated damages under the FLSA, and damages for\n\nconversion of her property. Appellant, Ramin, asserts nine issues on appeal.\n\nAppellee, Wills, cross-appeals on a single issue. We affirm in part and reverse and\n\nremand in part.\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n      The evidence at trial established that Ramin is a business located in\n\nMagnolia, Texas, which manufactures scientific glass. Wills began her\n\nemployment with Ramin in 2008, where Wills worked until her resignation on or\n\nabout June 14, 2011. Ramin filed an Original Petition on or about June 16, 2011,\n\nnaming Wills, Wilma Glass L.L.C. (Wilma Glass), and Miquel [sic] Martinez as\n\ndefendants, seeking a temporary restraining order, temporary injunction, and\n\n                                        2\n\fpermanent injunction, and asserting claims against the defendants for breach of\n\ntheir covenants not to compete and memorandum of employment agreement, for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy, tortious interference with prospective\n\nrelationships, unfair competition, business disparagement, and an accounting. The\n\ntrial court granted a Temporary Restraining Order on June 16, 2011. The trial court\n\nthen held a temporary injunction hearing and denied the temporary injunction on\n\nOctober 12, 2011. On October 26, 2012, Wills filed her Second Amended Answer\n\nand First Amended Counter-Claim, 1 wherein she asserted various defenses and a\n\ncounterclaim for Ramin’s failure to pay overtime under the FLSA, conversion and\n\ntheft, and retaliation, and she sought damages and attorney’s fees. Ramin filed a\n\nFirst Amended Petition on November 18, 2013, no longer naming Martinez as a\n\ndefendant but continuing to seek a recovery for the previously enumerated claims.\n\nRamin later filed a Second Amended Petition. The Second Amended Petition was\n\nthe live pleading on file at the time of trial. In the Second Amended Petition Ramin\n\nalleged a claim against Wills and Wilma Glass for breach of covenants not to\n\ncompete and a memorandum of employment agreement, for breach of fiduciary\n\nduty and conspiracy, tortious interference with “prospective relations,” unfair\n\ncompetition, business disparagement, and an accounting. In Ramin’s Second\n      1\n        The record on appeal does not include a copy of Wills’ original answer,\nfirst amended answer, or the original counterclaim, if any.\n                                         3\n\fAmended Petition, Ramin also included an affirmative defense that Wills was\n\nexempt from overtime compensation under the FLSA because “she was a\n\nmanagement employee and also an employee in an executive, administrative, or\n\nprofessional capacity . . . .” 2 The parties tried all issues to the court in a bench trial.\n\nTestimony of Ruth Wills\n\n       At trial and on appeal, the parties disagree on the nature and scope of Wills’\n\nprimary job duties at Ramin. Wills testified that her job duties included inside\n\nsales, that she was “not in a management position[,]” and that she “never had any\n\nauthority to be management.” She testified that her primary duty at Ramin was\n\n“[c]ustomer service” and that her specific duties included answering the phones,\n\ntaking orders, putting orders into the computer system, and shipping and ordering.\n\nWills stated that she did not manage or supervise any employees, she could not fire\n\nemployees, and she did not evaluate employees.\n\n       Wills testified that when she started working for Ramin her hourly rate was\n\nabout $13 an hour. She then received a raise in 2009 that increased her pay to $15\n\nan hour, and later her pay increased to $20 an hour. According to Wills, she\n\nworked for Ramin over forty hours a week because “[t]here was a lot to do[,]” and\n       2\n         The only other affirmative defense to Wills’ counterclaim that Ramin\nasserted in Ramin’s Second Amended Petition was the defense of “[r]es judicata\nand collateral estoppel.” Ramin did not include any argument or briefing on res\njudicata or collateral estoppel in its appeal.\n                                             4\n\fshe was not paid overtime compensation. Wills introduced into evidence a copy of\n\nher calendar with handwritten notes and a summary of her hours that she testified\n\ndepicted the hours she worked.3 Wills explained that when she first started\n\nworking at Ramin “on some occasions he -- they did give me some overtime pay.\n\nBut Brad said, No more overtime.” Wills testified that she worked an average of\n\n“47 hours a week[,] 45, 46[]” and that she worked five days a week, sometimes\n\nweekends, and sometimes from home at night.\n\n      Wills testified that three glassblowers for Ramin, including Miguel Martinez\n\n(Martinez), also worked as glassblowers for other businesses in addition to\n\nworking for Ramin, including work for Scientific Glass Products, a business that\n\nMartinez operated. Wills testified that, in October or November of 2010, Martinez\n\ninvited her to join a side business he operated with family members. She testified\n\nthat she agreed to join them, and together they formed Wilma Glass in December\n\n2010. Wills testified that Wilma Glass had revenues of about $30,000 and that it\n\nhad no profits during that time. Wills’ claim for unpaid overtime pertained to the\n\nyears 2009 through 2011. According to Wills, Wilma Glass ceased operating in\n\nJune 2011.\n\n      3\n       Ramin made an objection at trial to the calendar and summary worksheet\nwhich we will discuss in more detail in a subsequent section of our Memorandum\nOpinion.\n                                        5\n\f      Wills explained that Wilma Glass was doing business as Scientific Glass\n\nProducts. Wills further explained to the court that on the weekend before she\n\nstopped working at Ramin, she and Martinez moved some items to the Wilma\n\nGlass shop located on Frazier Street. Wills later returned to find the locks changed,\n\nand she looked through the window and could see that certain items were missing.\n\nWills made a list of the items that were taken and marked the items that personally\n\nbelonged to her and the items that belonged to Wilma Glass, and that exhibit was\n\nintroduced and admitted into evidence. Wills testified that “[a]ccording to Stacy\n\n[Collins,]” the president of Ramin and formerly the vice president of operations for\n\nRamin, the items had been removed by Stacy Collins, Jim Ramin’, Sue Ramin’,\n\nMartinez, another glassblower for Ramin, and counsel for Ramin.\n\nTestimony of Sue Ramin’\n\n      Sue Ramin’, the controlling owner of Ramin, testified that when Wills began\n\nworking at Ramin, her job duties included “[s]ales and phone and kind of getting\n\nacquainted with the office procedures.” Sue Ramin’ testified that about one year\n\nlater, Wills was promoted to office manager, and as office manager Wills had the\n\nresponsibility for shipping, inside sales, and information technology.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\fTestimony of Stacy Collins\n\n      Stacy Collins (Collins) testified that when he started working for Ramin in\n\n2011, Wills’ job duties included scheduling, purchasing, and shipping, that Wills\n\nwas the “sales manager over the office administration IT[],” that two employees\n\nreported to Wills, and that she had the capability to hire and fire employees. On\n\ncross-examination, Collins admitted that he testified at the temporary injunction\n\nhearing in this case that, during the time he worked at Ramin, Wills did not provide\n\nperformance reviews to any employee, she did not supervise any employee, and\n\nshe did not hire or fire anyone. Collins testified that Wills asked him for overtime\n\npay in April or May of 2011, but he denied her request because “[s]he was exempt.\n\n. . . She made a salary. She had people reporting to her.” Ramin did not present any\n\ndocumentary evidence at trial to establish the number of hours Wills worked each\n\nweek, nor did Ramin specifically contest Wills’ testimony that sometimes she\n\nworked from home, at night, or on weekends.\n\nTestimony of Miguel Martinez\n\n      Martinez testified at trial that Wills was to “find customers” for Wilma Glass\n\nand also run the administrative side of the business, and “she knew people through\n\nRamin’” that could be customers for Wilma Glass. Martinez stated that Wilma\n\nGlass had a shop on Goodson Road from about February to June of 2011, that they\n\n                                         7\n\fmoved the shop to a location on Frazier Street in June of 2011, but they only\n\noperated out of the location on Frazier for “a couple of days.” Martinez testified\n\nthat he told Jim Ramin’, co-owner of Ramin, about the Wilma Glass shop on\n\nFrazier Street and that Martinez himself allowed some people with Ramin to go to\n\nthe Wilma Glass shop. Martinez testified that he opened the door to the Wilma\n\nGlass shop and people from Ramin walked into the shop, and that Martinez then\n\nobserved Ramin’s people take things out of the Wilma Glass shop, which included\n\nsome “boxes labeled with Jim Ramin’ labels[.]” According to Martinez, he also\n\nsaw them put the items from the shop on a truck and drive away with the items,\n\nand later he saw some of the items from the Wilma Glass shop in Jim Ramin’s\n\ngarage.\n\n        At trial, Ramin and Wills each agreed to submit their claims for attorney’s\n\nfees by affidavit to the court. After the bench trial, Wills’ attorney filed an affidavit\n\nin support of attorney’s fees with attached billing statements. The record includes\n\nno response or objection by Ramin to Wills’ attorney’s affidavit or billing\n\nstatements, nor does the record include any evidence that Ramin filed any motion\n\nor affidavit to controvert the fees or to support a request for Ramin’s attorney’s\n\nfees.\n\n\n\n\n                                           8\n\f      The trial court entered a Final Judgment on March 10, 2014. In the Final\n\nJudgment, the court included the following language:\n\n             The Court finds that Ruth Wills, an employee of Ramin’,\n      violated the duty of loyalty owed by an employee to the employer and\n      competed with Ramin’ during the period of her active employment by\n      Ramin’; that there is insufficient evidence to establish damages\n      suffered by Ramin’ as a result of Wills’ actions; and the Court finds\n      Ramin’ should take nothing on Ramin’s claim for breach of fiduciary\n      duty.\n             The Court also finds that all remaining causes of action asserted\n      by Ramin’ were not supported by the [sic] sufficient evidence and\n      Ramin’ should take nothing on all of its remaining claims against both\n      Wills and Wilma Glass, LLC.\n             The Court finds that Wills was not an exempt employee under\n      the Fair Labor Standards Act; Wills was not paid for her overtime\n      work in the amount of $30,450.00; Wills is entitled to recover\n      liquidated damages from Ramin’ in the amount of $30,450.00;\n      Ramin’ converted Wills’ personal property that had a value of\n      $7,429.00; and finds that Wills should recover damages from Ramin’\n      for these amounts.\n             The Court finds that there is insufficient evidence to establish\n      the reasonable and necessary attorney fees for the claim of overtime\n      work and that Wills should take nothing on her claim for attorney\n      fees.\n\nThe court ordered that Ramin should “take nothing” on its claims against Wills and\n\nWilma Glass. The court awarded Wills the sum of $30,450 for unpaid overtime\n\nand an equal amount of $30,450 in liquidated damages, and the sum of $7,429 in\n\ndamages for the conversion of Wills’ property, and taxed all costs against Ramin.\n\n      Ramin filed a “Motion to Modify and Reform Judgment, Or, In the\n\nAlternative, Motion for New Trial[,]” arguing that the court should modify the\n                                         9\n\fFinal Judgment so that “Wills receives no reward for her breach of fiduciary\n\nduty[]” and arguing that “[t]here was no evidence to support the conversion claim.”\n\nThe trial court did not modify the Final Judgment. Neither party requested the trial\n\ncourt issue separate findings of fact and conclusions of law, and none were signed\n\nby the trial court. Ramin timely filed a Notice of Appeal. Wills cross-appealed\n\nsolely on the denial of attorney’s fees pertaining to her counterclaim for unpaid\n\novertime compensation.\n\n                                 ISSUES ON APPEAL\n\n      In its first issue, Ramin argues that the trial court erred in concluding that\n\nWills was not an exempt employee under the FLSA. In its second and third issues,\n\nRamin argues that because the court found that Wills breached her fiduciary duty\n\nto Ramin, Wills should not have been permitted to “enjoy the profits of her\n\nbreach,” and that it was error to award Wills any damages for unpaid overtime\n\ncompensation. In its fourth and fifth issues, Ramin argues that the trial court erred\n\nin awarding Wills any damages for conversion because there was no evidence that\n\nRamin took or exercised dominion and control over Wills’ personal property, and\n\nthere was no evidence of the market value of the property at issue to support an\n\naward of damages.\n\n\n\n\n                                         10\n\f      Ramin’s remaining issues pertain to the admission of evidence and the\n\nleading nature of certain questions. Ramin contends that the court erred in\n\nadmitting Will’s personal calendar, diary, and summaries thereof (issue six), in\n\nadmitting certain of Wills’ emails (issue seven); in admitting Wills’ list of market\n\nvalues of the property she alleged Ramin converted (issue eight), and in permitting\n\nWills’ attorney to utilize leading questions (issue nine).\n\n      Wills cross-appealed and stated only one issue, wherein she argues that the\n\ntrial court erred in failing to award her attorney’s fees on the successful\n\nprosecution of her counterclaim under the FLSA. Wills argues that an award of\n\nattorney’s fees is “mandatory” under the FLSA.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n      When a bench trial is conducted and the court does not sign separate\n\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law to support its judgment, all facts necessary\n\nto support the judgment are implied.

According to Ramin, Wills was a sales manager and a “key\n\nmanagement employee” and therefore she was an “exempt employee” under the\n\nFLSA. Ramin contends that Wills (1) was paid at least $455 a week, (2) had the\n\n“primary duty” of management, (3) regularly directed the work of two or more\n\nemployees, and (4) had “the authority to hire or fire other employees or whose\n\nsuggestions and recommendations as to the hiring, firing, advancement, promotion\n\nor any other change of status of other employees are given particular weight.”\n\nTherefore, Ramin argues that Wills was not, as a matter of law, entitled to overtime\n\ncompensation under 29 U.S.C. § 207, and the trial court erred in awarding Wills\n\novertime compensation as well as liquidated damages under the FLSA.\n\n      Generally, the FLSA requires an employer to pay nonexempt employees\n\nwho work more than forty hours in a seven-day work week at a rate of not less than\n\none and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay for the overtime hours\n\nworked by the employee.

The regulatory provisions focus upon the “primary duty” of\n\nthe employee. “Primary duty” is defined as follows:\n\n             (a) To qualify for exemption under this part, an employee’s\n      “primary duty” must be the performance of exempt work. The term\n      “primary duty” means the “principal, main, major or most important\n      duty that the employee performs. Determination of an employee’s\n      primary duty must be based on all the facts in a particular case, with\n      the major emphasis on the character of the employee’s job as a whole.\n      Factors to consider when determining the primary duty of an\n      employee include, but are not limited to, the relative importance of the\n      exempt duties as compared with other types of duties; the amount of\n      time spent performing exempt work; the employee’s relative freedom\n      from direct supervision; and the relationship between the employee’s\n      salary and the wages paid to other employees for the kind of\n      nonexempt work performed by the employee.\n             (b) . . . The amount of time spent performing exempt work can\n      be a useful guide in determining whether exempt work is the primary\n      duty of an employee. Thus, employees who spend more than 50\n      percent of their time performing exempt work will generally satisfy\n      the primary duty requirement. Time alone, however, is not the sole\n      test, and nothing in this section requires that exempt employees spend\n      more than 50 percent of their time performing exempt work.\n      Employees who do not spend more than 50 percent of their time\n      performing exempt duties may nonetheless meet the primary duty\n      requirement if the other factors support such a conclusion.\n\n29 C.F.R. § 541.700(a), (b).\n\n      Here, while Wills was paid more than $455 per week, she testified that she:\n\n(1) did not have the primary duty of management; (2) did not customarily and\n\nregularly direct the work of two or more employees, and (3) did not have the\n\nauthority to fire or evaluate employees or provide employment-related suggestions\n\n                                        17\n\fthat were given any particular weight. Wills also testified that her primary duty at\n\nRamin was customer service, and that she entered sales orders, invoiced sales\n\norders, completed filing, sent purchase orders to vendors, and answered phones.\n\nWills stated that she did not supervise glassblowers, did not manage sales, and did\n\nnot actively recruit new customers for Ramin. According to Wills, “everybody was\n\n[her] boss,” and she simply followed orders. On the other hand, according to\n\nRamin, Wills worked as the sales manager for Ramin until she resigned on June\n\n13, 2011. Ramin argued that Wills sent emails that referenced her position as a\n\n“sales manager.” According to Ramin, as sales manager, Wills managed the daily\n\noperations of Ramin, she supervised a number of employees including the\n\ncompany’s vice president of finance, she would oversee some of the\n\nmanufacturing, and Wills’ suggestions and recommendations on employment\n\ndecisions in the company were given particular weight.\n\n      As the factfinder in this case, the trial court was the sole judge of the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses, and the trial court was entitled to resolve\n\ninconsistencies in the testimony by believing one witness and disbelieving others\n\nregarding the duties Wills performed.

Kuhlmann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2362457\"><a href=\"/opinion/2362457/mcgalliard-v-kuhlmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">722</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 697 (Tex. 1986).

The trial court found that Wills\n\nwas not an exempt employee under the FLSA. We conclude that the evidence is\n\nsufficient to support the conclusion reached by the trial court that Wills was not an\n\nexempt employee.

It is within the discretion of the court whether the agent who\n\nhas committed a breach of trust shall receive full compensation or whether her\n\ncompensation shall be reduced or denied. Id. at 243. When exercising such\n\ndiscretion, the court may consider several factors, including (1) whether the agent\n\nacted in good faith; (2) whether the breach of trust was intentional or negligent or\n\nwithout fault; (3) whether the breach of trust related to the management of the\n\nwhole or related only to a part of the principal’s interest; (4) whether the breach of\n\ntrust by the agent occasioned any loss to the principal and whether such loss has\n\nbeen satisfied by the agent, (5) whether the services of the agent were of value to\n\nthe principal.

She\n\ntestified that the spreadsheet she offered into evidence included the “start time,\n\nlunch out, lunch in, and total hours, hours worked, and overtime hours[],” and that\n\n                                         38\n\fthe spreadsheet was based upon a true and correct copy of her actual planners or\n\ncalendars. After Wills’ testimony regarding her personal calendars, her attorney\n\noffered the calendars and spreadsheet into evidence “for the limited purpose of\n\nshowing the hours that she worked[.]” Ramin objected again as follows:\n\n             Your Honor, first of all, . . . the so-called predicate that they\n      have laid doesn’t even meet any exception to hearsay.\n             Second of all, the Excel spreadsheet, . . . obviously were [sic]\n      created after the fact and they are not even part of the planner. And so\n      it is hearsay and outside of any exception. And these documents\n      obviously weren’t even created at the same time as the planners were,\n      these Excel spreadsheets.\n\nThe trial court overruled Ramin’s objection and admitted the calendars and the\n\nspreadsheet summaries “as a shorthand rendition of the information contained\n\ntherein.” Ramin offered no testimonial or documentary evidence to contradict\n\nWills’ evidence of the number of hours Wills claimed she worked.\n\n      In its brief, Ramin argues that Wills’ personal calendars or diaries were not\n\nadmissible under any exception to the hearsay rule because there was “nothing\n\nsystematic about Wills’ calendar book, as it contained randomness of entries all in\n\nWills’ handwriting. No regularly conducted activity of a business or organization\n\nappears in that document and Wills’ counsel never seemed even to make such\n\nargument at trial.” Wills argues on appeal that the planners contained within\n\nExhibit 109 were offered only as the basis for the tabulations and summaries of\n\n                                        39\n\fhours worked 12 that she included within the spreadsheet in Exhibit 109, and that it\n\nwas merely cumulative of Wills’ other testimony. Wills does not argue that the\n\nplanner or calendar met any exception to the hearsay rule.\n\n      Even if we assume without deciding that the trial court erred in admitting\n\nExhibits 109 and 120, we conclude that the items were cumulative of Wills’ other\n\ntestimony at trial where she testified that she worked an average of about seven\n\nand a half hours of overtime each week in 2009 and in 2010, and that she worked\n\nan average of about five hours of overtime each week in 2011. An erroneous\n\nadmission of evidence that is merely cumulative of properly admitted evidence is\n\nharmless. See Owens-Corning Fiberglas, 916 S.W.2d at 557. Additionally, we\n\nconclude, based upon the record before us, that the trial court’s admission of the\n\ndocuments in question in this bench trial was harmless error. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.1(a).

Under 29 U.S.C. § 216(b),\n\n“[t]he court in such action shall, in addition to any judgment awarded to the\n\n[employee] plaintiff or [employees] plaintiffs, allow a reasonable attorney’s fee to\n\nbe paid by the defendant, and costs of the action.” Wills argues that an award of\n\nattorney’s fees to the prevailing party on a claim under the FLSA is mandatory,\n\nand that the trial court “had no discretion to deny [attorney’s] fees in their\n\n                                        43\n\fentirety.” Ramin argues that the evidence of attorney’s fees was legally insufficient\n\nto support an award because Wills’ attorney’s affidavit does not establish that the\n\namounts submitted are reasonable or necessary, Wills’ attorney failed to segregate\n\nfees as between Wills and Martinez, whom she also represented in the lawsuit, and\n\nthe invoices do not segregate the services provided as to the various claims and\n\ndefenses at issue in the litigation.

In the attorney’s affidavit,\n\nWills’ attorney stated that her fees were recoverable under several theories, except\n\n                                         49\n\ffor “about 3 hours of work solely for the defense of the breach of fiduciary duty\n\nclaims.” The attorney stated that all of the remainder of the time was “inextricably\n\nintertwined with claims for which attorneys’ fees are recoverable.” Wills’ attorney\n\nprovided no estimate in her affidavit regarding the number of hours or percentage\n\nof her time that was attributable solely to her FLSA counterclaim, nor did she\n\nspecifically include a statement that certain discrete legal services advanced both\n\nrecoverable and unrecoverable claims, but she did specifically allege that with the\n\nexception of “about 3 hours of work solely for the defense of the breach of\n\nfiduciary duty . . . the remainder of the time was inextricably intertwined with\n\nclaims for which attorney’s fees are recoverable.” 15 The trial court included a\n\nfinding in the Final Judgment that “there is insufficient evidence to establish the\n\nreasonable and necessary attorney fees for the claim of overtime work and that\n\nWills should take nothing on her claim for attorney fees.”\n\n      15\n           The relevant portion of Wills’ attorney’s affidavit states that\n\n      [f]ees are recoverable for Ms. Wills’ claim for violations of the Texas\n      Theft Liability Act, for her overtime claim, and for the defense of an\n      overly broad non-compete agreement with the exception of about 3\n      hours of work solely for the defense of the breach of fiduciary duty\n      claims. The remainder of the time was inextricably intertwined with\n      claims for which attorneys’ fees are recoverable.\n              The claims related to the non-compete, over-time, and theft\n      liability claims are so intertwined with the remainder of the claims\n      and defenses that they cannot be segregated.\n                                            50\n\f      The general rule regarding the recovery of fees in Texas is that “fee\n\nclaimants have always been required to segregate fees between claims for which\n\nthey are recoverable and claims for which they are not.” Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at\n\n311. In Chapa, the Court stated:\n\n      Intertwined facts do not make tort [attorney’s] fees recoverable; it is\n      only when discrete legal services advance both a recoverable and\n      unrecoverable claim that they are so intertwined that they need not be\n      segregated. We modify Sterling to that extent.\n\nId.at 313-14. When multiple causes of action are asserted, some of which allow fee\n\nrecovery and some of which do not, then evidence of time or money necessary\n\nonly to the litigation of claims for which attorney’s fees are not recoverable must\n\nbe segregated from evidence of the reasonable amount of time or money necessary\n\nfor the performance of legal services necessary to litigate claims for which\n\nattorneys’ fees are recoverable. Id. If a particular legal service was necessary to\n\nlitigate a cause of action for which attorney’s fees are recoverable, such fees are\n\nnot rendered unrecoverable merely because they also advance a claim for which\n\nattorney’s fees would not be otherwise available.

In\n\nother words, if any of the component tasks relate solely to a cause of action for\n\nwhich legal fees are not recoverable, then those fees must be segregated and are\n\nnot recoverable.

App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet.\n\ndenied)).\n\n      A party seeking an award of attorney’s fees bears the burden of proof on a\n\nclaim that her attorney’s legal services advanced both recoverable and non-\n\nrecoverable claims and that no segregation is required. See Jackson Walker, LLP v.\n\nKinsel, No. 07-13-00130-CV, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 3586, at **55-59 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Amarillo Apr. 10, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.)

A\n\ncourt must “examine the facts alleged in support of the claims to determine\n\nwhether they are inextricably intertwined, and if the prosecution or defense does\n\nnot entail proof or denial of essentially the same facts, the exception [to the\n\nrequirement to segregate fees] does not apply.” Fix It Today, LLC v. Santander\n\nConsumer USA, Inc., No. 02-14-00191-CV, 2015 Tex. App. LEXIS 4677, at *22\n\n(Tex. App.—Fort Worth May 7, 2015, no pet.) (mem. op.) (citing In re W.M.R.,\n\nNo. 02-11-00283-CV, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 9097, at *46 (Tex. App.—Fort\n\nWorth Nov. 1, 2012, no pet.) (mem. op.)); see also Jackson Walker, LLP, 2015\n\nTex. App. LEXIS 3586, at *55-59 (remanding the issue of segregation for a new\n\ntrial where “the causes of action were distinct, and facts necessary to prove each\n\ndid not overlap.”).\n\n                                       52\n\f      Similarly, although the language in the FLSA states that a prevailing\n\nplaintiff (employee) must be awarded reasonable fees and costs in actions brought\n\nunder the FLSA, the factfinder has discretion in setting the amount of the fees and\n\nreasonableness thereof and the prevailing party who is only partially successful\n\nmay not be entitled to be reimbursed for all of their fees. See Bode, 919 F.2d at\n\n1052 (“[B]ecause the [appellants] are only partly successful . . . , it is not proper to\n\nreimburse them for 100% of their . . . fees.”).\n\n      At trial, Wills prevailed on her claim under the FLSA. Section 216(b)\n\nexpressly provides that Wills, as a prevailing party, shall be entitled to seek a\n\nrecovery of her reasonable attorney’s fees that she incurred in pursuing her claim\n\nfor unpaid overtime compensation and liquidated damages relating thereto.\n\nHowever, Wills is not entitled to be reimbursed for all of her attorney’s fees\n\nbecause she was not successful on other claims and some of her claims do not\n\nallow for a recovery of attorney’s fees. See id.\n\n      Upon examining the record before us, we note that Wills filed pleadings that\n\nspecifically related both to her FLSA claim and the defense of Ramin’s claims, as\n\nwell as the prosecution of other counterclaims. Wills’ unsegregated fees, time\n\nentries, as well as the testimony at trial, and the attorney’s fee affidavit, provide at\n\nleast some evidence which would support allowing a recovery of some of the fees.\n\n                                          53\n\fSee Chapa, 212 S.W.3d at 314 (“Unsegregated attorney’s fees for the entire case\n\nare some evidence of what the segregated amount should be.”). We conclude that\n\nthe trial court abused its discretion in failing to award some amount to Wills for\n\nattorney’s fees, and the appropriate disposition of this case is to reverse that\n\nportion of the judgment stating that Wills should take nothing on her claim for\n\nattorney’s fees and remand the attorney’s fees issue to the trial court for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.
