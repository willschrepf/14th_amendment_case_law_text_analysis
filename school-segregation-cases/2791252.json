class=\"MsoNormal\"><span>Spears filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing\r\nthat the statute of limitations had run on both collection of the Note and\r\nreformation of the Deed.  Spears

entirety of the affidavit is hearsay within hearsay, not\r\nfalling within any of the exceptions to the hearsay rule, (2) the affidavit\r\ncontains no supporting records, and (3) it is conclusory.  The trial court\r\nsustained Spears</span><span>=</span><span>s objections, struck Johnson</span><span>=</span><span>s affidavit, and\r\nthen refused CA Partners</span><span>=</span><span>s request under Rule 166a(f) of the Texas\r\nRules of Civil Procedure to supplement Johnson</span><span>=</span><span>s affidavit with\r\nsupporting records.  Ultimately, the trial court granted

court granted over CA Partners</span><span>=</span><span>s objection. \r\nCitifinancial then counterclaimed, seeking a declaratory judgment that its lien\r\n</span><span>A</span><span>holds a

counterclaims for violations of the\r\nDTPA, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and the Texas Finance Code.  In\r\nits fifth issue, CA Partners argues that the trial court erred in awarding\r\njudgment against Johnson individually, and in issuing permanent injunctions\r\nagainst Johnson.  In its seventh issue, CA Partners asserts that the trial\r\ncourt erred in awarding attorney</span><span>=</span><span>s fees to Spears\r\nbecause he failed to segregate time incurred between fee-recoverable and\r\nnon-fee recoverable matters, and because the amount of appellate attorney</span><span>=</span><span>s fees awarded was\r\n</span><span>A</span><span>extravagant</span><span>@</span><span> and excessive. \r\nIn its final issue, CA Partners contends that the trial

within\r\nthe limitations period and the Note was accelerated within the limitations\r\nperiod.  In its third issue, CA Partners contends that the trial court erred in\r\nrefusing to reform the Deed,
