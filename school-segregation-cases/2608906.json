Compl. ¶¶ 1, 9 [Dkt. # 1]. Applying the\n\nframework set forth in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837\n\n(1984), the Court found that the Commission had exceeded its authority, particularly because the\n\nproblem it was trying to remedy was not – even as the agency characterized its task – to interpret\n\nan ambiguity in the statute, but rather, to address a problem not contemplated by the statute that\n\nwas ostensibly created by the Supreme Court’s decisions in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.\n\n(“WRTL II”), 551 U.S. 449 (2007), and Citizens United v. FEC, 588 U.S. 310 (2010). The Court\n\n1      At the time this case was filed, the BCRA was codified in Title 2 of the United States\nCode, at 2 U.S.C. § 434. It has since been transferred to Title 52, at 52 U.S.C. § 30104.\nAccordingly, the Court cites to the statute in this opinion as it now appears in Title 52 of the\nUnited States Code.\n\fstruck down 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9) at the first level of the Chevron analysis, and it did not\n\nthen proceed to the second level of the Chevron test. 2 See Van Hollen v. FEC, 851 F. Supp. 2d\n\n69, 89 (D.D.C.), rev’d sub nom. Ctr. for Individual Freedom v. Van Hollen, 694 F.3d 108 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2012).\n\n       The FEC did not appeal the decision. But the intervenor-defendants, the Center for\n\nIndividual Freedom (“CFIF”) and the Hispanic Leadership Fund (“HLF”) did, and the United\n\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the case should not have\n\nbeen decided at the first Chevron step.       The Circuit Court found the BCRA’s disclosure\n\nprovisions to be ambiguous, “especially when viewed in the light of the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecisions” in Citizens United and WRTL II, and it remanded the case for consideration of the\n\nregulation at Chevron step two. Van Hollen, 694 F.3d at 110, 112.\n\n       The Court now concludes that the promulgation of 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9) was\n\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law and that the regulation is an unreasonable interpretation\n\nof the BCRA for several reasons. First, the Commission initiated the rulemaking process for the\n\nstated purpose of responding to the decision in WRTL II, but nothing the Supreme Court did in\n\nthat case provides a basis for narrowing the disclosure rules enacted by Congress. WRTL II dealt\n\nsolely with the question of whether the statutory ban on corporate and labor organization funding\n\nof electioneering communications could withstand an as-applied constitutional challenge. And\n\nin answering that question, the Court did not find any need to address the BCRA’s disclosure\n\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n2       Chevron instructs the reviewing court to consider first “whether Congress has directly\nspoken to the precise question at issue,” and if so, “the court, as well as the agency, must give\neffect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” 467 U.S. at 842–43.\n                                                 2\n\f       Second, there is little or nothing in the administrative record that would support the\n\nCommission’s decision to introduce a limitation into the broad disclosure rules in the BCRA.\n\nNeither the petition for rulemaking nor the original notice of proposed rulemaking proposed\n\naltering the disclosure requirements for corporations and labor unions. None of the commenters\n\nasked the agency to amend the disclosure rules to include a purpose requirement, and the\n\nCommission did not incorporate the purpose requirement in the new rule until after the notice\n\nand comment period and the hearing had been concluded. The only post-hearing comment\n\nreceived in response to the newly incorporated language strongly opposed its inclusion.\n\n       Finally, the regulation’s purpose requirement is inconsistent with the statutory language\n\nand purpose of the BCRA. Congress passed the disclosure provisions of the BCRA to promote\n\ntransparency and to ensure that members of the public would be aware of who was trying to\n\ninfluence their votes just before an election.       The added purpose requirement in section\n\n104.20(c)(9) thwarts that objective by creating an easily exploited loophole that allows the true\n\nsponsors of advertisements to hide behind dubious and misleading names. Based on these\n\nconsiderations, the Court will vacate 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9), and it will grant plaintiff’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       Over the course of seven years, the Supreme Court of the United States weakened, and\n\neventually invalidated entirely, the prohibition on the use of corporate and union treasury funds\n\nto finance electioneering communications. See Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 365; WRTL II, 551\n\nU.S. at 470–76; McConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93, 93 (2003), overruled by Citizens United, 558\n\nU.S. at 310.    In the midst of this changing legal environment, the Commission began a\n\nrulemaking process and solicited public comment “generally regarding the effect of the\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f[WRTL II] decision on the Commission’s rules governing corporate and labor organization\n\nfunding of electioneering communications, the definition of ‘electioneering communication,’ and\n\nthe   rules   governing   reporting   of   electioneering   communications.” 3    Electioneering\n\nCommunications, 72 Fed. Reg. 50261, 50262 (proposed Aug. 31, 2007). As part of that process,\n\nthe Commission offered two alternative ways to implement the WRTL II decision: “The first\n\nalternative would incorporate the new exemption into the rules prohibiting the use of corporate\n\nand labor organization funds for electioneering communications in 11 [C.F.R.] part 114. The\n\n\n3      Section 30104(f)(2) of the BCRA requires the following disclosures:\n\n               (E)     If the disbursements were paid out of a segregated bank account\n               which consists of funds contributed . . . directly to this account for\n               electioneering communications, the names and addresses of all\n               contributors who contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to\n               that account . . . . [; or]\n\n               (F)    If the disbursements were paid out of funds not described in\n               subparagraph (E), the names and addresses of all contributors who\n               contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to the person making\n               the disbursement during the period beginning on the first day of the\n               preceding calendar year and ending on the disclosure date.\n\n52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2)(E)–(F).\n\n       Section 104.207(c)(7)–(8) of FEC’s implementing regulations generally tracks the\nlanguage of section 30104(f)(2)(E)–(F), except that it substitutes the words “donor” and\n“donated” for “contributor” and “contributed.” It calls for the following disclosures:\n\n               (7)(i) If the disbursements were paid exclusively from a segregated bank\n               account . . . , the name and address of each donor who donated an amount\n               aggregating $1,000 or more to the segregated bank account, aggregating\n               since the first day of the preceding calendar year; or . . . .\n\n               (8)     If the disbursements were not paid exclusively from a segregated\n               bank account described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, . . . the name\n               and address of each donor who donated an amount aggregating $1,000 or\n               more to the person making the disbursement, aggregating since the first\n               day of the preceding calendar year.\n\n11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(7)(i), (c)(8) (2014).\n                                                 4\n\fsecond alternative would incorporate the new exemption into the definition of ‘electioneering\n\ncommunication’ in 11 [C.F.R.] § 100.29.” Id. Under the first alternative, corporations and labor\n\norganizations making the sorts of electioneering communications deemed permissible in WRTL\n\nII would be permitted to use general treasury funds for that purpose, but they would be subject to\n\nthe same reporting requirements as other entities. Id. As part of that alternative, the agency also\n\nproposed changes to the rules that would enable those organizations to establish segregated bank\n\naccounts for the funding of electioneering communications as certain individuals were already\n\npermitted to do. Id. Adopting Alternative II would have exempted the WRTL II ads from the\n\ndefinition of electioneering communication in 11 C.F.R. § 100.29 entirely, thereby eliminating\n\nboth the disclosure and financing restrictions for those ads. Id. at 50263.\n\n       In December 2007, the agency adopted a variant of the first alternative. It promulgated\n\n11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9), which included the following language:\n\n               If the disbursements were made by a corporation or labor organization\n               pursuant to 11 [C.F.R.] § 114.15, the name and address of each person\n               who made a donation aggregating $1,000 or more to the corporation or\n               labor organization, aggregating since the first day of the precedent\n               calendar year, which was made for the purpose of furthering\n               electioneering communications.\n\n11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9) (emphasis added).\n\n       The Commission provided several explanations for adding this new “purpose” or “intent”\n\nrequirement to the corporate and labor organization disclosure regulation. First, it noted that\n\nthose entities’ “general treasury funds are often largely comprised of funds received from\n\ninvestors,” donors, customers, or members “who may not necessarily support the organization’s\n\nelectioneering communications.” Electioneering Communications, Final Rule, 72 Fed. Reg.\n\n72899, 72911 (Dec. 26, 2007). And second, it stated that compliance with the disclosure rules as\n\npreviously written would impose a heavy burden on corporations and labor organizations:\n\n                                                 5\n\f“[W]itnesses at the Commission’s hearing testified that the effort necessary to identify those\n\npersons who provided funds totaling $1,000 or more . . . would be very costly and require an\n\ninordinate amount of effort.” Id. The Commission then concluded that “the policy underlying\n\nthe disclosure provisions of BCRA [was] properly met by requiring corporations and labor\n\norganizations to disclose and report only those persons who made donations for the purpose of\n\nfunding [electioneering communications].” Id.\n\n       Plaintiff Chris Van Hollen – concerned that “corporations have exploited the enormous\n\nloophole [the new regulation] created,” Compl. ¶ 29 – filed this case against the FEC under the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”). 5 U.S.C. § 706. He argued that the agency exceeded its\n\nstatutory authority in promulgating that regulation and that the regulation is also arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, and contrary to law under the APA. Two months after plaintiff filed his complaint,\n\nCFIF and HLF filed motions to intervene as defendants [Dkt. # 14 & 15], and the Court granted\n\nthose motions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a). Aug. 1, 2011 Minute Entry.\n\nPlaintiff, the Commission, and CFIF then filed cross-motions for summary judgment, Pl.’s Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J. (“Pl.’s Mot.”) [Dkt. # 20]; Def.’s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. (“Def.’s Mot.”) [Dkt.\n\n# 25]; CFIF’s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 36], and HLF filed a motion to dismiss for lack of\n\njurisdiction. HLF’s Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. # 30].\n\n       On March 30, 2012, the Court entered an order granting plaintiff’s motion for summary\n\njudgment and denying the other three motions. Order [Dkt. # 47]. After determining that\n\nplaintiff had standing to bring his APA challenge, the Court conducted a Chevron analysis and\n\nstruck down 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9) as inconsistent with text of the statute. The Commission\n\ndid not appeal the Court’s order, but intervenor-defendants CFIF and HLF did. Van Hollen, 694\n\nF.3d at 110. On September 18, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fCircuit concluded that since the BCRA was ambiguous, the case should not have been decided at\n\nthe first step of the Chevron test. Id. at 112.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit remanded the case with instructions to the District Court to refer the\n\nmatter first to the Commission to ascertain whether the agency intended to engage in further\n\nrulemaking to clarify the regulatory regime. The judgment further provided: “[i]f the FEC elects\n\ninstead to defend the current regulation, then the District Court should allow the parties to\n\npresent arguments on Appellee’s claims that the regulation cannot survive review under Chevron\n\nstep two or [Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Ass’n of the United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mutual\n\nAuto Insurance Co., 463 U.S. 29, 42–43 (1983)], and then decide these issues in the first\n\ninstance.” Id.\n\n       On September 20, 2012, the Court referred the matter to the Commission and directed it\n\nto advise the Court on or before October 12, 2012, whether it intended to pursue a new\n\nrulemaking or defend the regulation.          Order Referring Matter to Def. FEC for Further\n\nConsideration [Dkt. # 66]. In a status report filed on October 4, 2012, the Commission stated\n\nthat it did not intend to pursue a rulemaking and that it would continue to defend 11 C.F.R.\n\n§ 104.20(c)(9) as written before the Court. FEC Status Report [Dkt. # 67]. But the following\n\nday, intervenor-defendant CFIF advised the Court that it had petitioned the FEC to engage in the\n\nrulemaking that the agency had just informed the Court that it did not intend to undertake. CFIF\n\nStatus Report [Dkt. # 68]. The matter was stayed pending the FEC’s consideration of CFIF’s\n\npetition, and on March 12, 2013, the stay was lifted in light of the agency’s decision to deny the\n\npetition and forego further rulemaking. See Oct. 18, 2012 Minute Order Staying Case; Mar. 12,\n\n2013 Minute Order Lifting Stay. The Court permitted the parties to supplement their original\n\nmemoranda with additional arguments on the Chevron step two issue, and it heard oral argument.\n\n\n\n                                                  7\n\f                                             ANALYSIS\n\n    I.      The standard to be applied at Chevron step two\n\n         This Court is bound by the Circuit’s determination that section 30104(f)(2)(E)–(F) is\n\nambiguous, and therefore, it must now address the question of whether the implementing\n\nregulation, 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9), is “based on a permissible construction of the statute.”\n\nChevron, 467 U.S. at 843. At the second step of the Chevron analysis, the reviewing court must\n\ngive “considerable weight” to an agency’s interpretation of a statutory scheme it has been\n\n“entrusted to administer;” the “court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory\n\nprovision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.” Id. at 844. As\n\nthe D.C. Circuit put it in Serono Laboratories, Inc. v. Shalala, “under Chevron, courts are bound\n\nto uphold an agency interpretation [so] long as it is reasonable – regardless [of] whether there\n\nmay be other reasonable, or even more reasonable, views.” 158 F.3d 1313, 1321 (D.C. Cir\n\n1998).\n\n         Here, the Court of Appeals specifically directed this Court to determine whether the\n\nregulation could survive review under the test prescribed in the State Farm opinion. Van Hollen,\n\n694 F.3d at 112. In State Farm, the Supreme Court reiterated that under the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard, “a reviewing court may not set aside an agency rule that is rational, based on\n\nconsideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the\n\nagency by the statute.” 463 U.S. at 42. The Supreme Court went on to explain the process in\n\ngreater detail:\n\n                  The scope of review under the “arbitrary and capricious” standard is\n                  narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\n                  Nevertheless, the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a\n                  satisfactory explanation for its action including a “rational connection\n                  between the facts found and the choice made.” In reviewing that\n                  explanation, we must “consider whether the decision was based on a\n\n                                                   8\n\f               consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear\n               error of judgment.” Normally, an agency rule would be arbitrary and\n               capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not\n               intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of\n               the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the\n               evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be\n               ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\n\nId. at 43 (citations omitted). This, then, is the framework that must govern the Court’s decision.\n\nBut as plaintiff points out, that analysis cannot be divorced from the context of the particular\n\nstatutory scheme involved.\n\n       Plaintiff Van Hollen cites Shays v. FEC (“Shays II”), 414 F.3d 76 (D.C. Cir. 2005), and\n\nShays v. FEC (“Shays III”), 528 F.3d 914 (D.C. Cir. 2008), to the Court. Pl.’s Supplemental\n\nBriefing on Remanded Issues (“Pl.’s Supp.”) at 1–2 [Dkt. # 87]. He asserts that a reviewing\n\ncourt’s task is to determine whether agency regulations are reasonable “in light of the language,\n\nlegislative history, and policies of the statute,” id. at 2, quoting Shays v. FEC, 337 F. Supp. 2d\n\n28, 78 (D.D.C. 2004), and he calls upon the Court to follow the approach “exemplified in Shays”\n\nand to reject the regulations here on the grounds that they frustrate the policy behind the BCRA.\n\nId. at 1–2, citing Shays III, 528 F.3d at 919.\n\n       The first Shays opinion cited is not helpful because it does not concern a Chevron step\n\ntwo exercise. In Shays II, the court addressed the standing question at length, and then it\n\naffirmed the District Court’s invalidation of a set of FEC rules as too lax. See 414 F.3d at 83–96.\n\nThe first two rules failed at the threshold Chevron inquiry, as the court found that they\n\ncontravened the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress, and the Circuit Court upheld the\n\nDistrict Court’s invalidation of the other three rules on APA grounds, noting that it did not need\n\nto reach the second Chevron question of whether the rules were reasonable because the agency\n\nhad failed to advance any justification for them. Id. at 96–97.\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f         But in Shays III, the Court of Appeals did directly address the second step of the Chevron\n\nanalysis when it approved the District Court’s “thorough” rejection of a set of FEC rules based\n\non the finding that they were “either contrary to BCRA’s purpose or arbitrary and capricious.”\n\n528 F.3d at 919. The Court stated: “[i]n applying Chevron’s second step and the APA, we must\n\nreject administrative constructions of [a] statute . . . that frustrate the policy that Congress sought\n\nto implement.” Id. (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n         So, under the precedent that this Court is bound to follow, the challenged rule must also\n\nbe tested against the policy that BCRA was intended to advance.\n\n   II.      The challenged regulation is not supported by the agency’s explanation for the\n            regulation.\n\n         The starting point of the second step of the Chevron analysis must be the stated reason\n\nbehind the regulation, which is illuminated by both the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\n(“NPRM”) and the Explanation and Justification that accompanied the announcement of the final\n\nrule. The rulemaking was supposed to be about one narrow subject: what to do to implement\n\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in WRTL II. See 72 Fed. Reg. at 50261 (“These proposed rules\n\nwould implement the Supreme Court’s decision in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., which\n\nheld that the prohibition on the use of corporate and labor organization funds for electioneering\n\ncommunications      is   unconstitutional   as   applied    to   certain   types   of   electioneering\n\ncommunications.”); see also id. at 50262 (“The Commission is initiating this rulemaking to\n\nimplement the Supreme Court’s decision in WRTL II. . . . The Commission is seeking public\n\ncomment on two proposed alternative ways to implement the WRTL II decision in the rules\n\ngoverning electioneering communications.”). To assess the reasonableness of the regulations,\n\nthen, one must first ascertain what the Supreme Court decided in that case that required\n\nimplementation.\n\n                                                  10\n\f       WRTL II dealt with the constitutionality of section 203 of the BCRA, 2 U.S.C.\n\n§ 441(b)(2), as applied to particular advertisements that the Wisconsin advocacy organization\n\nplanned to broadcast. 551 U.S. at 449. At that time, section 203 made it a crime for a\n\ncorporation or labor union to use its general treasury funds to pay for any “electioneering\n\ncommunication,” 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2), that is, a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\n\nthat refers to a candidate for federal office and is aired within a prescribed time period before an\n\nelection. 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(3)(A).\n\n        WRTL II was not the first time the Supreme Court addressed section 203: the opinion\n\nfollowed McConnell, in which the Court considered a series of facial challenges to multiple\n\nprovisions of the statute. 540 U.S. at 114. As part of that exercise, the McConnell Court found\n\nthe regulation of corporate and labor union expenditures in section 203 to be constitutional on its\n\nface. Id. at 203–09. The plaintiffs claimed that section 203 was overbroad and that it violated\n\nthe First Amendment because it covered not only campaign speech, or “express advocacy,” but\n\nalso more general “issue advocacy” that might mention a candidate for federal office. Id. at 205–\n\n07. The Court disagreed and found that the compelling governmental interests that justified the\n\nimposition of restrictions on express campaign speech would also apply to advertisements that\n\nare the “functional equivalent” of express campaign speech. Id. at 204–06. Thus, it concluded\n\nthat even if one assumed that section 203 would “inhibit some constitutionally protected\n\ncorporate and union speech,” plaintiffs had not met their heavy burden of establishing that the\n\nprovision was overbroad and that it could never be constitutionally enforced. Id. at 207; see also\n\nWRTL II, 551 U.S. at 457 (“The [McConnell] Court concluded that there was no overbreadth\n\nconcern to the extent the speech in question was the ‘functional equivalent’ of express campaign\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fspeech.”). The McConnell opinion did not further define “functional equivalent” or undertake to\n\nresolve any future as-applied challenges to the law.\n\n       It was WRTL II that directly presented an as-applied challenge to section 203. The non-\n\nprofit issue advocacy corporation sought to broadcast radio advertisements that clearly identified\n\na particular Senator running for re-election during the period when “electioneering\n\ncommunications” would be illegal under section 203. 551 U.S. at 458–61. The Supreme Court\n\nreviewed its decision in McConnell and explained that resolving an as-applied challenge required\n\nit to determine at the outset “whether the speech at issue is the ‘functional equivalent’ of speech\n\nexpressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office, or instead a ‘genuine\n\nissue a[d].’” Id. at 457 (alteration in original), quoting McConnell, 540 U.S. at 206. The Court\n\nobserved that McConnell did not adopt any test to be used as the standard for future as-applied\n\nchallenges, and so, it found it necessary to do so. Id. at 464.\n\n       The Court determined that in order to safeguard First Amendment rights, it was necessary\n\nthat the standard be an objective one, “focusing on the substance of the communication rather\n\nthan amorphous considerations of intent and effect.” Id. at 469.\n\n               It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow parties to resolve disputes\n               quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome\n               litigation. And it must eschew the open-ended rough-and-tumble of\n               factors, which invites complex argument in a trial court and a virtually\n               inevitable appeal. In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to\n               protecting rather than stifling speech.\n\n               In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the\n               functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of\n               no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a\n               specific candidate.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f       This then is the sole holding of WRTL II: that the section 203 prohibition against the use\n\nof a corporation’s or labor organization’s general funds for electioneering communications can\n\nonly be applied to express campaign ads or to those issue ads that can only be reasonably\n\ninterpreted as a plea to vote for or against a particular candidate.\n\n       Applying the new test, the majority concluded that the particular ads at issue were not the\n\nfunctional equivalent of express campaign speech, and that since the interests that would justify\n\nrestricting corporate campaign speech or its functional equivalent do not support restrictions on\n\nissue advocacy, section 203 was unconstitutional as applied to WRTL’s ads. Id. at 457. 4\n\n       Notably, the opinion in WRTL II said absolutely nothing about the reporting requirements\n\nthat attach when an individual or a group disburses funds to pay for express campaign ads or\n\nthose issue ads that fall within the definition of electioneering communications. The plaintiff\n\nhad specifically disavowed any challenge to the reporting provisions, noting that the ads it\n\nsought to run would be subject to the transparency that was the goal of the BCRA. See In the\n\nmatter of Electioneering Communications: Notice 2007-16 (“Rulemaking Hr’g”) (Oct. 17,\n\n2007), Administrative Record (“AR”) 622–23 [Dkt. # 17-5] (quoting WRTL’s brief: “Because\n\nWRTL does not challenge the disclaimer in the disclosure requirements there will be no ads done\n\nunder misleading names.        There will continue to be full disclosure of all electioneering\n\ncommunications both as to disclaimer and public reports.               The whole system will be\n\ntransparent.”). This raises the question: how did a Supreme Court opinion lifting the ban on\n\n\n\n\n4       The Court was sharply divided on this point. Justice Souter, in an opinion joined by\nJustices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, wrote: “it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads\nare constitutionally subject to regulation under McConnell.” Id. at 525 (Souter, J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fWRTL’s ads prompt the agency to revise the reporting requirements? After all, the Supreme\n\nCourt had already squarely addressed those reporting requirements in McConnell. 5\n\n       After the WRTL II decision was handed down, a petition for rulemaking was filed. The\n\npetition – filed by the James Madison Center for Free Speech, which was represented by the\n\nsame counsel who had represented WRTL – did not call for a change in the disclosure\n\nrequirements either.   Petition for Rulemaking: Protecting “Genuine Issue Ads” from the\n\n“Electioneering Communication” Prohibition & Repealing 11 C.F.R. § 100.22(b), James\n\nMadison Ctr. for Free Speech, AR 96 [Dkt. # 17-2]. Instead, the organization urged the agency\n\nto undertake a rulemaking to make two changes to the FEC’s regulations in the wake of WRTL\n\nII: 1) to recognize the protection accorded to genuine issue ads in WRTL II by promulgating a\n\nrule limiting the ban on corporate spending on “electioneering communications” to ads that meet\n\nthe WRTL II definition; and 2) to repeal 11 C.F.R. § 100.22(b), the Commission’s definition of\n\n“expressly advocating.” Id., AR 98–103.\n\n       In response to that petition, the agency published a NPRM and requested comments on\n\nproposed rules that “would implement the Supreme Court’s decision in FEC v. Wisconsin Right\n\nto Life, Inc.” 72 Fed. Reg. at 50261. Acknowledging that “[t]he plaintiff in [WRTL II] . . . did\n\n\n5      The McConnell plaintiffs had complained that the requirements should not extend to both\nexpress and issue advocacy, but the Supreme Court unequivocally rejected that contention,\nquoting the District Court opinion at length and noting its approval:\n\n              We agree with the District Court that the important state interests that\n              prompted the Buckley Court to uphold FECA’s disclosure requirements –\n              providing the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and\n              avoiding any appearance thereof, and gathering the data necessary to\n              enforce more substantive electioneering restrictions – apply in full to\n              BCRA. Accordingly, Buckley amply supports application of FECA\n              § 304’s disclosure requirements to the entire range of “electioneering\n              communications.”\n\n540 U.S. at 196 (footnote omitted).\n                                              14\n\fnot contest . . . the reporting requirement in section [30104](f)(1)” and therefore that the case did\n\nnot directly impact the BCRA’s reporting requirements, id. at 50262, the agency nonetheless set\n\nout two alternative approaches for how it could revise the then-established disclosure\n\nrequirements to apply to the newly allowed WRTL II ads.\n\n       Under the first alternative, the agency observed that “corporations and labor\n\norganizations that make [WRTL II] electioneering communications . . . totaling over $10,000 in a\n\ncalendar year must file reports like other entities that make electioneering communications.” Id.\n\nat 50271. It proposed amending subsection 104.20(c)(7), which deals with the use of segregated\n\nbank accounts to fund electioneering communications, to include separate subparts covering non-\n\nWRTL II and WRTL II ads so that corporations and labor unions would be authorized to create\n\nsuch accounts to fund the permissible ads and would report contributions to the accounts\n\naccordingly. Id. The FEC also recognized that under Alternative I, corporations and unions\n\nwould be permitted to expend general treasury funds for WRTL II ads. Id. In contemplating that\n\ncircumstance, it posed a series of questions about how the agency should administer the\n\ndisclosure requirements established by section 104.20(c)(8) in that context:\n\n               Under the proposed regulations, how would a corporation or labor\n               organization report an electioneering communication funded with general\n               treasury funds? If the corporation or labor organization does not pay for\n               the electioneering communication from an account described in proposed\n               sections 104.20(c)(7)(ii) and 114.14(d)(2)(i), would the corporation or\n               labor organization be required to report “the name and address of each\n               donor who donated an amount aggregating $1,000 or more” to the\n               corporation or labor organization during the relevant reporting period, as\n               required by [52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2)(F)] and 11 [C.F.R. §] 104.20(c)(8)?\n               If so, how would a corporation or labor organization determine which\n               receipts qualify as “donations”? Should the Commission limit the\n               “donation” reporting requirement to funds that are donated for the express\n               purpose of making electioneering communications?\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fId. Although the agency posed this question, the first alternative set out in the Notice did not\n\ninclude any sort of limiting language.\n\n        Alternative 2 embodied a simpler approach. Under that option, the agency proposed that\n\n“a communication that qualifies for [the WRTL II] exemption in proposed section 100.29(c)(6)\n\nwould be exempted from the definition of ‘electioneering communication.’” Id. at 50272. In\n\nother words, all WRTL II communications would be exempt from the “regulations imposing\n\nreporting requirements on persons making ‘electioneering communications,’” while “the\n\nreporting requirements applicable to all communications that continue to meet the definition of\n\n‘electioneering communication’ would remain unchanged.” Id. Thus, neither of the alternatives\n\nproposed in the FEC’s notice incorporated the specific limiting language that is the subject of\n\nthis litigation.\n\n        The Commission received twenty-seven written comments on the proposed rules, and it\n\nheld a two day hearing at which fifteen witnesses testified. 72 Fed. Reg. at 72900. After the\n\nhearing and before it promulgated the final rule, the Commission added the language that is at\n\nissue in this case – “made for the purpose of furthering electioneering communications” – for the\n\nfirst time. See Memorandum on Draft Final Rule on Electioneering Communication to the\n\nCommission (Nov. 16, 2007), AR 1006 (setting forth its proposed draft B of the regulation). The\n\nagency received only one comment in response to the newly proposed language, which strongly\n\nopposed the proposal.      Letter from the Campaign Legal Center to the Federal Election\n\nCommission (Nov. 19, 2007), AR 1024–25. 6\n\n\n\n\n6       Another commenter recommended that the Commission adopt Draft A. AR 1018–19.\n                                               16\n\f       This review of the procedural history tends to diminish the validity of the regulation\n\nunder the second level of the Chevron analysis because it demonstrates that the Commission’s\n\naction was unmoored from the stated basis for embarking on a rulemaking in the first place. 7\n\n       Before WRTL II, the McConnell Court upheld the disclosure provisions on their face,\n\nwith the understanding that they applied to individuals, to those corporations and unions using\n\nsegregated bank accounts, and to “groups” that had many individual donors. The rules also\n\napplied to some corporations, see FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S. 238 (1986), even\n\nif that group was small.\n\n       WRTL II left the reporting provisions untouched.\n\n       And even after WRTL II, when the restrictions on corporate and labor union spending\n\nwere struck down entirely in Citizens United, and the Supreme Court was well aware that the\n\nstatutory reporting requirements would now apply to a large number of ads funded by those\n\norganizations, it again left the reporting requirements untouched. 558 U.S. at 368 (alterations in\n\noriginal) (citations omitted) (“[Citizens United] contends that the governmental interest in\n\nproviding information to the electorate does not justify requiring disclaimers for any commercial\n\nadvertisements, including the ones at issue here. We disagree. . . . The disclaimers required by\n\n\n7       Indeed, multiple witnesses at the rulemaking hearing specifically cautioned that it would\nbe inappropriate for the Commission to take up a change to the disclosure rules when the sole\npurpose of the rulemaking was supposed to be to conform the existing regulations to the WRTL II\nopinion. See, e.g., Rulemaking Hr’g, AR 511 (testimony of Mark Elias) (imploring the agency\nto address the Supreme Court ruling on electioneering communications and do no more: “[y]ou\nare not faced with questions about disclosure”); id. 517 (testimony of Allison Hayward) (joining\nElias and “counseling restraint”); id. 647–49 (testimony of Donald Simon) (arguing that the\nCommission was engaging in a “bait and switch” because “[t]he plaintiff in WRTL did not\nchallenge the [s]ection 201 disclosure requirements and repeatedly reassured the Supreme Court\nthat if it did permit corporations to make some electioneering communications there would\ncontinue to be full disclosure . . . . But now having won the [s]ection 203 argument on that basis\nmany urge the Commission to reach out and eviscerate the disclosure requirement”); id. at 807–\n08 (testimony of Brian Svoboda) (urging the Commission to proceed narrowly and do little more\nthan WRTL II required and noting that WRTL II did not address disclosure).\n                                               17\n\fsection 311 ‘provid[e] the electorate with information’ and ‘insure that the voters are fully\n\ninformed’ about the person or group who is speaking.”).\n\n          Therefore, the Court finds that it was unreasonable for the FEC to alter the statutory\n\nreporting requirements on the stated grounds that it was implementing the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in WRTL II. There was nothing about implementing the new definition of “functional\n\nequivalent of express advocacy” for purposes of enforcing section 203 that required narrowing\n\nthe disclosure requirements in 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2).\n\n   III.      The record does not reflect that the FEC examined the relevant data and\n             articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice it made.\n\n          In addition to considering the regulation in light of its stated purpose, the Court must also\n\nreview the record to determine whether the agency fully explained how its choice was predicated\n\nupon data it accumulated during the rulemaking process. Here, the parties did not deal with the\n\nrecord before the agency in any detail in their briefs. So the Court found it necessary to review\n\nthe record in its entirety in order to undertake the analysis described in State Farm. And it found\n\nthat there is a very poor fit between the rule that was promulgated and both the question and the\n\nevidence that were before the agency at the time.\n\n          As an initial point, the Court notes that it was not until after the notice and comment\n\nperiod that the Commission announced that it had decided to depart from the proposed rules set\n\nforth in the NPRM and to do something entirely different – to limit corporate and labor union\n\ndisclosure requirements to cover only the names and addresses of donors who intended to fund\n\nan electioneering communication. 72 Fed. Reg. at 72911 (“As discussed in detail below, after\n\nconsideration of the comments, the Commission has decided to depart from the rules proposed in\n\nthe NPRM . . . .”). Although the mere fact that changes were made to a proposed rule after the\n\nnotice and comment period does not itself invalidate the rule or the process, see Air Transport\n\n                                                   18\n\fAss’n of Am. v. Civil Aeronautics Bd., 732 F.2d 219, 224 (D.C. Cir. 1984), the chronology here\n\nhas an impact upon this portion of the State Farm analysis. As the record stands, none of the\n\ncomments received during the NPRM stage or at the Commission’s hearing addressed the\n\nlanguage that the Commission eventually adopted, and the one post-hearing comment that did\n\naddress the proposed course of action vehemently opposed it. The record is therefore largely\n\ndevoid of evidence that supports the specific language that the Commission used to curtail the\n\ndisclosure requirements in the case of corporations and labor organizations.\n\n       The record also lacks evidence that supports the Commission’s decision to alter the\n\ndisclosure regulations in the first place. In the Explanation and Justification that accompanied\n\nthe promulgation of the final rule, the Commission stated that the disclosure regulation\n\ngoverning corporations and labor organizations that paid for electioneering campaigns would be\n\ntailored so that those entities need “disclose only the identities of those persons who made a\n\ndonation aggregating $1,000 or more specifically for the purpose of furthering [electioneering\n\ncommunications] made by that” entity. 72 Fed. Reg. at 72911 (emphasis added). It offered the\n\nfollowing explanation in support of its decision:\n\n               A corporation’s general treasury funds are often largely comprised of\n               funds received from investors such as shareholders who have acquired\n               stock in the corporation and customers who have purchased the\n               corporation’s products or services, or in the case of a non-profit\n               corporation, donations from persons who support the corporation’s\n               mission. These investors, customers, and donors do not necessarily\n               support the corporation’s electioneering communications. Likewise, the\n               general treasury funds of labor organizations and incorporated\n               membership organizations are composed of member dues obtained from\n               individuals and other members who may not necessarily support the\n               organization’s electioneering communications.\n\nId. The agency also noted – without further specific citations to the record or testimony – that\n\n“witnesses at the Commission’s hearing testified that the effort necessary to identify those\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fpersons who provided funds totaling $1,000 or more to a corporation or labor organization would\n\nbe very costly and require an inordinate amount of effort.” Id. Based on those considerations,\n\nthe agency then summarily concluded that “the policy underlying the disclosure provisions of\n\nBCRA [was] properly met by requiring corporations and labor organizations to disclose and\n\nreport only those persons who made donations for the purpose of funding [electioneering\n\ncommunications].” Id.\n\n       Plaintiff does not dispute the agency’s representation that at the time WRTL II was\n\ndecided, it was anticipated that there would be a significant increase in the number of\n\nadvertisements sponsored by corporations and labor unions. See 551 U.S. at 535–36 (Souter, J.,\n\ndissenting). But the written comments submitted to the agency and the testimony at the hearing\n\ndid not supply grounds for a narrowing of the reporting requirements.           Although some\n\ncommenters raised concerns about the burdens that the disclosure rules might impose, those\n\nconcerns were generally presented in the context of urging the agency to define electioneering\n\ncommunications clearly and narrowly, so that neither the prohibition nor the reporting\n\nrequirements would apply to genuine issue advertisements or commercial speech.              No\n\ncommenters provided data to quantify the burden that this change in the law might impose on\n\ncorporations or labor unions, and no written submissions actually asked the Commission to limit\n\nthe disclosure rules to contributions made for the purpose of funding electioneering\n\ncommunications.\n\n       Four of the commenters did not discuss the question of whether the reporting rules should\n\nbe changed in their comments at all. See Comments of the James Madison Center for Free\n\nSpeech, AR 96–103 (the organization that petitioned for the rulemaking); Comments of the\n\nAmerican Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Inc., AR 222–27; Comments of the Thomas\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fJefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression and Comments of the Media Institute, AR\n\n249–62.    And although there were several commenters that did mention disclosure, they\n\ngenerally mentioned it in the context of advancing their position that their issue ads should not be\n\nsubject to any regulation. They favored the approach embodied in Alternative 2 – establishing\n\nan exclusion to the definition of electioneering communications for the type of speech protected\n\nby WRTL II – and observed that excluding constitutionally protected communications from the\n\ndefinition of electioneering communications would also mean that the reporting requirements\n\nwould not apply to them. See, e.g., Comments of National Association of Realtors, AR 376–82;\n\nsee also Comments of Citizens United, AR 298–323. 8\n\n       For example, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the American\n\nAdvertising Federation, and the Association of National Advertisers sought clarification that\n\ntheir commercial and business advertisements were fully shielded by the Constitution and not\n\nsubject to either the prohibitions or the reporting requirements in the BCRA. See Comments of\n\nthe American Association of Advertising Agencies, the American Advertising Federation, and\n\nthe Association of National Advertisers, AR 231–41. They favored a broad safe harbor that\n\nwould clearly distinguish commercial speech from prohibited communications and noted:\n\n“There is no legal rationale for subjecting to the electioneering communication reporting regime\n\nads that are protected under the WRTL II decision. Further, such an obligation would impose\n\n\n8       Citizens United also mentioned disclosure in passing in its comments in favor of the\nadoption of Alternative 2 instead of Alternative 1. The organization was concerned that\nadvertisements for its books and documentary films could include references to candidates for\nfederal elective office. It took the position that the FEC was obligated by WRTL II to address\ngeneral advertising for businesses, products, and services, and that it should do so by exempting\nbusiness advertising from the definition of electioneering communications. In that context, it\nnoted: “Also, from a practical standpoint, we believe the disclosure requirements of Alternative\n1 would be extremely difficult to implement because ads for products and services are often\nfinanced by investment capital and sales revenues, not reportable contributions.” Comments of\nCitizens United, AR 309.\n                                                21\n\fsignificant burdens on advertisers and would chill the full exercise of their First Amendment\n\nrights.”     Id. 239.   The advertisers pointed out that “the legal underpinnings for reporting\n\narticulated in Buckley are wholly absent for ads protected by the WRTL II decision[,]” and\n\nconcluded, “[a] reporting and disclosure regime is inconsistent with the zone of safety created by\n\nthe Supreme Court for advertisements that can reasonably be interpreted as concerning\n\nsomething other than an election campaign.” Id. 240.\n\n           The Free Speech Coalition, Inc. and the Free Speech and Education Fund, Inc. echoed\n\nthose concerns, and they called for the promulgation of a narrow definition of “express advocacy\n\nand its functional equivalent” that would in turn limit the applicability of the reporting and\n\ndisclosure requirements. Comments of the Free Speech Coalition, Inc. and the Free Speech &\n\nEducation Fund, Inc., AR 325–35. “[I]f the funding limitations placed upon a broadcast of a\n\ngenuine issue ad or any other broadcast communication is found to be unconstitutional, then the\n\nreporting and disclosure requirement that would otherwise be attached to the ad because it is the\n\nfunctional equivalent of express advocacy cannot be justified by the Buckley standard . . . .” Id.\n\n330. The two free speech organizations warned that disclosure and reporting requirements posed\n\nthe same dangers and should be subject to the same strict scrutiny as absolute prohibitions if they\n\nimposed any burden on constitutionally protected speech.        Id. 329; see also Comments of\n\nIndependent Sector, AR 365 (advocating Alternative 2 – excluding issue ads from the definition\n\nof electioneering communications – over Alternative 1 because “issue advocacy is a fundamental\n\nright and purpose of nonprofit organizations” and a “distinction between the funding of ads,\n\nwhich the Supreme Court struck down, and the disclosure of funding for that right cannot be\n\nmaintained. . . . Aside from the daunting complexity involved in following FEC procedures,\n\ndonor disclosure requirements present significant privacy concerns that are not outweighed by\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\fthe government interest in disclosure. . . . We are also concerned about the chilling effect of\n\nproposed Alternative One on advocacy rights”); Comments of OMB Watch, AR 384–88 (calling\n\nfor a more specific general rule exempting issue advocacy and grassroots lobbying from the\n\nstatutory prohibitions and objecting to the imposition of any reporting requirements on\n\nbroadcasts that should be exempt). 9\n\n       And similarly, the American Taxpayers Alliance and Americans for Limited Government\n\nalso warned that compelled disclosure could infringe upon or chill the exercise of First\n\nAmendment rights and rejected the notion that the Commission could regulate or impose\n\nreporting requirements on issue ads that fell short of express advocacy or its functional\n\nequivalent. Comments of the American Taxpayers Alliance and Comments of Americans for\n\nLimited Government, AR 416–29.\n\n       In sum, the commenters who expressed concerns about the burdens or the\n\nconstitutionality of the reporting requirements were primarily advancing the view that certain\n\nadvertising should fall outside of the scope of the regulatory regime altogether. None of them\n\ncalled for or even discussed revising or narrowing of the reporting requirements for corporations\n\nand labor unions sponsoring genuine electioneering communications: their aim was to shrink the\n\npool of advertisements to which those requirements would apply.\n\n       Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, there were approximately a dozen\n\ncommenters who urged the Commission to keep the disclosure requirements intact.

This means the Commission\n               has guidance from the Court only to amend 11 CFR Part 114.\n\n\n10      The comments made by Alliance for Justice as well as those submitted by American\nFederation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, American Federation of State,\nCounty, and Municipal Employees, National Education Association, and Service Employees\nInternational Union also contained an alternative position on what the agency should do in the\nwake of WRTL II if the Commission should ultimately decide that the disclosure rules should be\nchanged. See Comments of Alliance for Justice, AR 444; Comments for American Federation of\nLabor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, et al., AR 457.\n                                              24\n\fComments of Center for Competitive Politics, AR 339.\n\n       Similarly, Common Cause, Public Citizen, and U.S. PIRG admonished the Commission\n\nthat WRTL II did not open the door to altering that portion of the statute:\n\n               The Commission should retain the reporting and disclosure requirements\n               for electioneering communications that are express advocacy for a number\n               of compelling reasons. First, the plaintiffs in both WRTL and the other\n               major as-applied challenge to BCRA Section 203’s funding prohibition\n               (Christian Civic League of Maine v. FEC) never contested BCRA’s\n               reporting and disclosure requirements for electioneering communications.\n               Indeed, they repeatedly told the courts that they were ready and willing to\n               comply with the disclosure rules if permitted to fund the ads they wished\n               to run.\n\n               Second, neither the controlling opinion nor concurring opinions in WRTL\n               mentioned the reporting and disclosure requirements of BCRA Section\n               201. They certainly did not call into question the legality of the\n               provisions. The FEC would therefore be entering uncharted waters.\n\nComments of Common Cause, et al., AR 351 (footnote omitted). That view was seconded by\n\nthe Congressional sponsors of Title II of the BCRA, Senator John McCain, Senator Russell D.\n\nFeingold, Senator Olympia Snowe, and Representative Christopher Shays, who insisted that the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding finding some funding restrictions to be unconstitutional did not extend\n\nto the reporting requirements:\n\n               The reporting requirements were not at issue in [WRTL II]. The Court did\n               not analyze their constitutionality, and if it had, an entirely different legal\n               framework would have been implicated. The Commission should not\n               undertake such an analysis on its own, especially since the Court in\n               McConnell upheld the reporting requirement against a facial challenge. . . .\n\n               One of the main purposes of Title II of BCRA was to make sure that the\n               public was informed of the identity of persons making expenditures on\n               electioneering communications. The legislative history of BCRA and the\n               record in McConnell are replete with examples of ads run by organizations\n               with benign sounding names and of unknown origin. The reporting\n               requirements of Section 201 were a significant reform in and of\n               themselves, completely independent of the prohibition contained in\n               Section 203. Those disclosure provisions apply not only to corporations\n\n                                                 25\n\f               and unions but to individuals and unincorporated associations who fund\n               electioneering communications. And the severability clause in section 401\n               of BCRA was meant to underscore congressional intent that even if\n               Section 203 were declared unconstitutional, other sections of the bill,\n               including Section 201, should survive. The Commission should not now\n               effectively throw out Section 201 based on an as-applied challenge to\n               Section 203 that specifically and explicitly disclaimed any challenge to\n               Section 201.\n\nComments of Senator McCain, et al., AR 371.\n\n       Other commenters underscored the salutary purposes of disclosure and took the position\n\nthat reporting requirements are much less burdensome than restrictions on expenditures. See\n\nComments of Public Campaign, AR 390–91 (“Disclosure enhances transparency and can provide\n\ncitizens with the information to determine how to vote or respond to calls for grassroots\n\nlobbying. . . . I urge the Commission to retain the extant disclosure requirements for all ads that\n\nmeet the definition of ‘electioneering communication.’”).\n\n       After the written comments were submitted, there was a hearing to consider the NPRM.\n\nThe hearing to consider the NPRM was held on October 17 and 18, 2007, and it consisted of a\n\nseries of panels. The witnesses and the Commissioners considered many issues other than the\n\npossible narrowing of the disclosure rules, and those discussions that do not bear on the issue\n\npresented in this case are not summarized here.\n\n        The first panel included James Bopp, who represented Wisconsin Right to Life in WRTL\n\nII, on behalf of the organization that filed the petition for rulemaking: The James Madison\n\nCenter for Free Speech.     He was joined by Marc Elias of Perkins Coie, representing the\n\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and former FEC staff member and George Mason\n\nLaw School faculty member, Allison Hayward. AR 503–632. While there was some discussion\n\nof disclosure issues during this panel, the bulk of the discussion was directed towards other\n\nissues, such as which of a series of sample ads should be considered to be the “functional\n\n                                                  26\n\fequivalent” of express advocacy, and whether the proposed rules would have the effect of\n\nregulating grassroots lobbying.      It is true that Professor Hayward commented that if a\n\ncorporation or labor union did not utilize a segregated account, the regulatory reporting\n\nrequirements would require it to “open up [its] books,” which could impose a “real burden.” AR\n\n517. But she did not offer further specifics or quantification. When prompted to make a\n\nprediction, Professor Hayward stated that she anticipated that the Supreme Court might find\n\ndisclosure requirements for WRTL II communications to be unconstitutional if presented with the\n\nright case, AR 592–93, but her central point was that WRTL II dealt only with the ban on\n\ncorporate spending, and not disclosure, and therefore, the Commission should not tread into that\n\narea at all. AR 517–18.\n\n       Elias similarly “implored” the Commission to do what was necessary under WRTL II and\n\nno more; “you are not faced with questions about disclosure.” AR 511; 537.             Elias also\n\ncautioned against attempting to predict how the Supreme Court would treat the disclosure of\n\nWRTL II communications. AR 594.\n\n       Hayward’s general comments about the burdens of disclosure included her observation\n\nthat the “contributors” to be disclosed under the statute would not include an organization’s\n\ncommercial customers, those who pay for its services, or members who pay membership dues.\n\nAR 611. Elias agreed. AR 612; 616 (“Are there ‘contributors’ to Ford?”). So this panel did not\n\nsupply evidence that compliance would be difficult for commercial enterprises or labor unions\n\nthat did not elect to establish the segregated bank account.\n\n       At least one of the Commissioners did express concerns about how the rule would affect\n\nnon-profit organizations since they are not generally required to identify their contributors, and\n\nthe delineation between dues and “donations” paid to them might be unclear. AR 616–19. But\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fmuch of the record consists of the Commissioners themselves thinking out loud about those\n\nissues – there was little data placed before them. And there was no testimony offered that\n\nsuggested that the availability of the segregated bank account option would not alleviate any\n\nburdens or privacy concerns associated with imposing the disclosure requirements on a non-\n\nprofit or any other organization.\n\n       Finally, as the Commission wrestled with the larger question of how it should administer\n\nthe statutory disclosure requirements in the case of organizations that Congress did not anticipate\n\nwould be funding electioneering communications in the first place, Elias urged the Commission\n\nto be guided by the approach that the BCRA is “a disclosure statute.” AR 599. He cautioned the\n\nCommission to address only section 203 issues, not issues related to section 201 disclosures. AR\n\n599–600. Even James Bopp, who was the most vocal member of the panel on behalf of\n\ngrassroots advocacy organizations and who warned against adopting an approach that would\n\nchill their lobbying and issue advocacy, conceded that no change to the disclosure requirements\n\nwas required by the WRTL II decision. AR 626. Instead, Bopp’s position was limited to\n\nadvocating for Alternative 2, which would exclude WRTL II communications from the definition\n\nof electioneering communications all together. AR 601–04.\n\n       The second panel on October 17, 2007 included Jan Baran, representing the Chamber of\n\nCommerce; Larry Gold on behalf of the AFL-CIO; and Don Simon for Democracy 21, a non-\n\nprofit campaign finance reform organization. AR 632–720. Much of the discussion covered\n\nother issues, such as what the definitions of express advocacy and electioneering\n\ncommunications should be, and how to provide clear guidance about what would be permissible\n\nafter WRTL II. See, e.g., AR 665–720. With respect to any changes to the disclosure provisions,\n\nBaran simply urged the FEC to create a safe harbor for the funding of issue ads that would be\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fsure to include all permissible speech, which would in turn have the effect of also eliminating\n\nreporting requirements for permissible speech and grassroots lobbying. AR 636–39.\n\n       Gold emphasized that the line of prohibition in the statute defined the line of disclosure,\n\nand he pressed for an approach along the lines of Alternative 2 that would narrowly define\n\n“electioneering communication” rather than a new regulation addressing the prohibition or the\n\nrelated disclosure rules directly. AR 641. In the event the agency took a different approach,\n\nGold observed that the Commission was faced with a situation that had not been contemplated\n\nby Congress:    “unions and corporations would never be in a position to have to report\n\nelectioneering communications because they were simply banned from doing so.” Id. Gold also\n\ntestified that the words “contribute” or “donate” connote a voluntary transfer without\n\nconsideration, so under the terms of the statute, “such income [as] receipts, dues, investment\n\nincome, damages awards and other commercial income and the like ought not to be subject to\n\ndisclosure.” AR 645. He explained that taking a broader approach would impose “a tremendous\n\nburden on unions in particular. The obligation to report income at the $1,000 level would be\n\nremarkable in comparison to a regulatory requirement . . . which requires unions to disclose all\n\nreceipts at the $5,000 threshold.” AR 646 (referring to the $5,000 threshold for disclosure under\n\nthe long-standing Labor Management Report and Disclosure Act).\n\n        Simon urged the FEC to leave the disclosure requirement for electioneering\n\ncommunications untouched.\n\n               The [WRTL II] court said nothing about disclosure and the analysis used to\n               evaluate the “as applied” constitutionality of Section 203 cannot logically\n               be extended to invalidate the disclosure required by Section 201. The\n               standard of review is different. Strict scrutiny versus intermediate\n               scrutiny. The nature of the burden is different – a ban on spending versus\n               a disclosure of spending that, as the court previously said, “does not\n               prevent anyone from speaking.” . . . Yet, notwithstanding these\n               differences on every level of the analysis and notwithstanding the court’s\n\n                                               29\n\f               own silence on the matter in [WRTL II], and notwithstanding the court’s\n               eight to one majority ruling in McConnell that the disclosure provision is\n               facially constitutional, you are being asked to make a determination that\n               Section 201 is unconstitutional. Surely the fact that Justices Scalia and\n               Kennedy, as well as Chief Justice Rehnquist in McConnell, agreed that\n               Section 201 was constitutional while at the same time voting to strike\n               down Section 203, indicates that they think the analysis of the two\n               provisions is completely different and there is nothing in [WRTL II] that\n               indicates that they or any other member of the court has changed their\n               mind on this question.\n\nAR 649–651. Simon was asked whether the FEC could choose its first alternative and adopt\n\nlanguage that would exempt business income and membership dues from disclosure. AR 654–\n\n55.   He opined that the agency could exempt business income, and he expressed some\n\nuncertainty about whether the agency could address union dues or whether that required a\n\nlegislative fix. He acknowledged that membership dues paid to non-profit organizations might\n\nraise a different set of questions, but he warned against doing anything that would undermine the\n\nreporting requirements, and he directed the agency’s attention back to McConnell, where the\n\nSupreme Court had talked about the importance of donor disclosure in an era of advertisements\n\nsponsored by vague “false fronts.” AR 656–57. And he emphasized that Congress had already\n\naddressed the burdens that might arise out of the disclosure obligation by building in the $1000\n\nreporting amount and creating the option of a segregated bank account. AR 657–58.\n\n       The Commissioners turned back to the union representative to ask if there were some\n\nway to exempt membership dues while still exposing those hiding behind vague monikers. The\n\nwitness did not express a need for further regulation in the union context since he opined that\n\ndues would fall outside of the disclosure provisions as they were already written. “[T]he main\n\npoint is that the statute talks in terms of ‘contributing contributions’ and you have interpreted it\n\nto mean ‘donating donations.’ Union dues are neither. Plainly they are neither.” AR 659–60.\n\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fBut Gold did caution that an organization should not be required to reveal its members simply\n\nbecause it had engaged in a single electioneering communication:\n\n              It seems to me that if somebody gives funds at the dues level – pays dues –\n              that is not a donation, that is not money contributed. If that individual\n              voluntarily gives more, that is truly a donative act and then you are\n              beginning to count perhaps towards the $1,000. But you do clearly have\n              the authority to make these distinctions and you ought to do so. And the\n              availability of the option that you’re suggesting in one of the alternatives –\n              a separate fund, even a union or corporation having a segregated fund, and\n              just dealing with that – that doesn’t really address this issue completely.\n\nAR 660–61.\n\n       The Chairman of the Commission observed that when WRTL II identified a new group of\n\ncommunications that could not be prohibited, it necessarily drew a broader group of entities into\n\nthe regulatory regime, and then the panel went on to discuss with how it should define the class\n\nof communications that were protected. AR 665–721.\n\n       The third panel on October 17, 2007 consisted of Jessica Robinson of the American\n\nFederation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and Paul Ryan from the Campaign Legal\n\nCenter. AR 721–790. Robinson’s remarks were directed to the need for a broad, clearly\n\ndelineated safe harbor for permissible issue advocacy. She recommended that the Commission\n\nadopt Alternative 2, which would limit disclosure obligations by limiting the set of\n\ncommunications to which they would pertain. AR 721–26. She did say, though, that if the\n\nagency adopted Alternative 1, instead, it should simplify the disclosure requirements. She feared\n\nthat the regulatory requirement to disclose “donations” could be applied to dues and therefore\n\ndifficult to enforce and she concluded, “[t]he easiest way to address these issues is to require\n\nreporting only for those people who earmark funds to be used for WRTL II type communications\n\nand other funds should be reported just as a donation of the labor union.” AR 727.\n\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\f       Ryan pointed out that while there were several commenters who proposed exempting\n\nWRTL II ads from the BCRA disclosure requirements, there was a large group of commenters,\n\nwho came from groups with varying perspectives on campaign finance disclosure, who would all\n\nagree “that the plaintiff in WRTL did not challenge the disclosure requirements, the WRTL court\n\ndid not address the constitutionality of the disclosure requirements, and the McConnell court by a\n\nlarge majority specifically upheld the constitutionality of these disclosure requirements.” AR\n\n730–31. For those reasons, and because there are different constitutional tests to be applied to\n\nfunding restrictions and disclosure rules, there are broader governmental interests served by\n\ndisclosure, and the burdens imposed by disclosure are less than those imposed by restrictions on\n\nexpenditures, he urged the agency not to utilize the rulemaking to alter the BCRA disclosure\n\nrequirements. AR 729–32.\n\n       The panel then talked a great deal about the scope of any safe harbor and where the\n\nSupreme Court had drawn the line on permissible expenditures for issue ads, before it turned\n\nagain to the disclosure issue. One Commissioner asked whether there would be any union\n\nmembers whose dues would exceed $1,000 per year, and the answer was yes, although no\n\nnumbers were provided. AR 766–67. The Commissioner also posed questions about how to\n\nexempt legitimate dues from disclosure requirements without creating a loophole whereby an\n\nanonymous advocacy organization could simply structure itself to charge exorbitant “dues” and\n\nthereby shield the names of a limited set of individual donors. Robinson responded, “I suppose\n\none thing you would look at is donative intent . . . . Union dues, they are not donations because\n\nthey are required for union membership. So one of the ways you would look at it is you would\n\nlook at the intent of the members of [the group]. Are they doing it so the organization can pay\n\nfor electioneering communications?” AR 768–69. The specter of probing a contributor’s intent\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\fprompted this comment by the Vice Chairman: “It’s one of those things that we would have to\n\nget into discovery for and that would be a bad thing.” AR 769. Robinson agreed, id., and the\n\npanel resumed its discussion about the content of WRTL II ads.\n\n       On October 18, 2007, the Commission heard from Brian Svoboda on behalf of the\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Jeremiah Morgan of William J. Olson, P.C.,\n\nrepresenting the Free Speech Coalition and Free Speech Defense and Education Fund, and\n\nMichael Trister for the Alliance for Justice. AR 797–899. Morgan took a strong stance against\n\nimposing disclosure requirements on entities sponsoring issue ads, and he argued that neither of\n\nthe alternatives in the Notice would comport with the First Amendment. AR 798–805. Svoboda\n\nencouraged the Commission to proceed narrowly and to do little more than what WRTL II\n\nrequired, particularly in the disclosure arena, which was not addressed in the opinion at all and\n\nmight require a different legal standard and method of legal review. AR 805–09. He maintained\n\nthat this approach would reflect “fidelity to what it was that Congress passed,” AR 806, but in\n\nhis remarks, Trister countered that the existing reporting requirements were not written for\n\ncorporations or labor unions, so it would be impossible for the Commission to divine how\n\nCongress would have decided the question. Under those circumstances, he counseled the agency\n\nto adopt Alternative 2, excluding WRTL II communications from the definition of electioneering\n\ncommunications, and to leave the question of what reporting requirements should apply to the\n\nfunding of this new particular category of speech up to the legislature. AR 812–16.\n\n       After the panelists discussed the safe harbor issue in depth, a Commissioner asked:\n\n              The comment that was most persuasive to me on this point was the one the\n              labor unions filed, because it seems to me you would not even get very\n              useful information out of making a labor union disclose the names of all of\n              its members, anybody who has paid dues in the last year . . . . Now is\n              there some way that we could preserve the disclosure piece of it, because I\n              think it’s still on the books and we kind of have an obligation to do that,\n\n                                               33\n\f              and yet, define donation perhaps in some way to exclude union dues . . .\n              and yet not open the door to . . . those sort of organizations that are always\n              described as shady or shadowy because we do not know who the donors\n              are behind them? That’s the sort of disclosure that I think Congress\n              actually has historically been concerned about. Is there some way to catch\n              one and not the other?\n\nAR 833–34.\n\n       Svoboda posited that Congress provided for the segregated account as one possible\n\noption for organizations that wanted to limit disclosure by disclosing only those who donated to\n\nthe segregated account. AR 834–37. Trister suggested that the agency could call for the\n\ninformation that 501(c) organizations are already required to supply to the IRS.               But he\n\nexpressed the view that there should be a distinction between a general support grant, which an\n\norganization can use for any purpose, and an earmarked or special project grant, and he noted\n\nthat general support grants, even if reportable to the IRS, should not be included within the FEC\n\ndefinition of donation. “If they gave it whenever they gave it and said, ‘Here’s $1,000 and I\n\nwant you to run an ad,’ then they ought to report that. But if they give them $1,000 and say,\n\n‘here’s $1,000. I like your organization. Keep up the good work,’ which is essentially a general\n\nsupport grant, then it is unfair and it [is] misleading to the public to suggest that person was\n\nconnected to the ad in some way, that they paid for the ad.” AR 839–40. Trister also noted that\n\nCongress had distinguished between earmarked and non-earmarked funds in other reporting\n\ncontexts. AR 840.\n\n        Svoboda generally agreed with Trister as to unions, but he thought that an intent-based\n\ndistinction would be problematic in the case of those non-profit organizations created for the\n\nprimary purpose of running electioneering communications. He cautioned that such an approach\n\nwould create an enormous hole in the statutory requirement, leaving both the public, and a\n\ncandidate who might wish to respond to an attack, in the dark about who had sponsored an\n\n\n                                               34\n\fadvertisement at a critical time close to an actual election. AR 842–44. In response to a question\n\nby a Commissioner concerned about potential threats to those who might criticize an incumbent\n\nofficeholder, Svoboda further explained that the identity of the speaker, and not simply the\n\ncontent of the speech, could play an important role in determining the nature of the response.\n\nAR 850–52. Trister took the position that Svoboda’s concerns were overstated, because such\n\norganizations would likely be required to disclose under the regulations for registered political\n\ncommittees anyway. AR 845.\n\n       The panel was then occupied by an extended legal discussion on the question of whether\n\nthe justifications for campaign finance regulation set forth in the Supreme Court’s opinion in\n\nBuckley v. Valeo would apply to WRTL II ads and what Chief Justice Roberts meant on page\n\n2672 of the WRTL II opinion when he questioned whether issue ads that are not the functional\n\nequivalent of express advocacy raise the sort of corruption concern identified in Buckley as\n\nreason for campaign finance regulation. And Commissioner von Sakovsky asked, if WRTL II\n\nads were not electoral activities, how did the FEC have any authority to call for disclosure of\n\ntheir sponsors at all? AR 853–56. Since the positions expressed by both the Commissioners and\n\nthe witnesses during this and similar portions of the hearing were legal conclusions, they shed\n\nlight on the agency’s thought processes and decision making but in the end, they do not provide\n\n“evidence” against which the decision can be tested.\n\n       The final panel consisted of Stephen Hoersting of the Center for Competitive Politics;\n\nJohn Sullivan of the Service Employees International Union; Heidi Abegg, on behalf of the\n\nAmerican Taxpayers Alliance and Americans for Limited Government, and Michael Boos of\n\nCitizens United. AR 900; 902. Abegg urged the Commissioners to think about those 501(c)(4)\n\norganizations that may express unpopular opinions and generate strong adverse reactions from\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fboth the government and the public. She took the position that disclosure requirements would\n\nraise privacy concerns and pose a risk of harassment and reprisals. She spoke of a longstanding\n\ntradition of anonymous public speech, and said that there would be no compelling governmental\n\ninterest that would support disclosure regulations in the case of communications that are not\n\nexpress advocacy or its functional equivalent.       Ultimately, Abegg urged the adoption of\n\nAlternative 2, which would have the effect of eliminating disclosure requirements for WRTL II\n\ncommunications. AR 902–08.\n\n       Boos of Citizens United also noted that Alternative 1 did not solve the problems related\n\nto those communications because it would leave the “burdensome” disclosure scheme that\n\napplies to electioneering communications intact. But Boos failed to elaborate on how disclosure\n\nwas burdensome. AR 910. He took the position that the FEC should adopt Alternative 2 instead\n\nsince it would exempt the ads in question – not only the WRTL II grassroots ads, but also\n\nCitizens United’s advertisements promoting the books and documentary films it produces – from\n\nthe regulatory scheme altogether. Finally, he called for a broader safe harbor in Alternative 2.\n\nAR 908–14.\n\n       Stephen Hoersting agreed with the notion that “it would be absurd to have organizations\n\nCongress never intended to run ECs all of a sudden have to start reporting their electioneering\n\ncommunications,” but he cautioned: “it would be untenable for the Commission to invoke its\n\nadministrative authority to stay application of Section 201, a facially valid provision, without\n\nsome organization asserting the application of 201 violates the rights of speech and association.\n\nIt would be unseemly for that question to be litigated in the posture of an agency defending its\n\nadministrative prerogatives . . . with no factual background of a speaker who is actually chilled.”\n\nAR 915. See also AR 927–28. He concluded: “The Commission should therefore hold its nose\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\fand apply Section 201 to issue advocates . . . . The word ‘contributes’ . . . should guide the\n\nCommission in crafting disclosure requirements even if disclosure comes down harder on\n\nnonprofit organizations whose ads are funded by contributors than it would for for-profit\n\ncorporations.” AR 916. 11 Finally, Hoersting underscored the importance of the need for a clear,\n\nnarrow definition of express advocacy. AR 917–19.\n\n       The union witness explained that the SEIU, AFL, NEA, and AFSCME were all very\n\nactive in the area of issue advocacy, spending considerable resources on federal and state\n\nlegislative activities and spending “a tremendous amount of our members’ voluntary\n\ncontributions on political activities.” AR 920. He argued that WRTL II required the agency to\n\nrevise its regulations concerning the definition of electioneering communications since the\n\nSupreme Court had redefined the boundaries of the Commission’s authority, and he emphasized\n\nthe important distinction between donations and dues.\n\n              Members pay dues to unions not to finance electioneering\n              communications, but to finance and support the full range of activities that\n              the union engages in, from collective bargaining representation, to\n              servicing members, to engaging in advocacy both with their employers\n              and with state and local officials around the country. And it would be, if\n              not counterproductive, at least serving no particular purpose to report or\n              disclose the names of people who did in fact not contribute to the\n              financing of a particular electioneering communication.\n\nAR 923–24.\n\n       There was then considerable discussion by the panel about the extent of the safe harbor\n\nprovisions in the regulations under consideration and the manner in which the agency could and\n\nshould implement the WRTL II imperative to define the functional equivalent of express\n\nadvocacy. AR 925–65. In response to a question from one of the Commissioners returning to\n\n\n11     Later, Abegg disagreed. AR 952–53 (“I am for ‘the tie goes to the speaker’ and not\nrequire another nonprofit to spend a lot of money bringing another lawsuit to challenge the\ndisclosure provisions.”).\n                                              37\n\fthe disclosure issue, Stephen Hoersting suggested that the Commission could probably draw an\n\ninference from Congress’s rejection of amendments to the Honest Leadership Open Government\n\nAct that would have required the disclosure of donors to grassroots lobbying organizations that\n\nCongress did not intend that the FECA disclosure rules would apply to grassroots issue\n\nadvertisements. AR 964–65. Boos, from Citizens United, stressed the fact that if the agency\n\nwere to define electioneering communication to exempt certain ads, then those ads would be free\n\nof any the disclosure and reporting requirements as well. AR 967.\n\n       At the close of the hearing, the Vice Chairman asked Abegg to provide more information\n\nin support of her claim that disclosure could pose some threat to potential donors. AR 968. The\n\nwitness reiterated that disclosure requirements might chill political speech, but she presented the\n\nCommission with no specifics:\n\n               I have particular examples, but I can’t share them. Some of them are\n               businessmen who are active in one political party but there is an issue that\n               is important to them so they want [to] give to effect change on that issue\n               and they are afraid if they do so they will face harassment or reprisals\n               from those in the other organizations with which they were associated.\n\nAR 969–70. Abegg went on:\n\n               Some of them just don’t want their names known. They don’t want any\n               attention. They just want to do it anonymously and go about their way.\n\nAR 970. She maintained that “[i]t is a very real concern” that could stop the flow of donations,\n\nand Hoersting echoed that sentiment. He indicated that he had been involved in conversations\n\nwhere “people stopped their activities because they heard about this disclosure aspect,” but his\n\ntestimony on that point was similarly vague. AR 971.\n\n               Chairman Lenard: Could you just elaborate on exactly concretely what\n               their concern is?\n\n\n\n\n                                                38\n\f               Mr. Hoersting: Yes. Well, I am not sure that I could, actually. I just\n               know when they heard disclosure they were not longer interested in\n               pursuing that issue that had a nexus to candidates.\n\nAR 971. Sullivan from SEIU reminded the Commission of the need to protect the names of\n\nunion members from potential reprisals in the workplace. AR 973–74. And then finally, with\n\nrespect to the disclosure issue, the Citizens United witness raised the question of the\n\norganization’s sales revenue and asked how, if the agency adopted Alternative 1, one would\n\ndifferentiate between such revenue and reportable “contributions” that would be used to fund\n\nadvertisements. AR 974–75. At that point, the second day of hearings came to an end.\n\n       A month later, on November 16, 2007, the General Counsel to the Commission\n\ntransmitted a Memorandum to the Commission which set forth two proposed draft final rules for\n\nthe implementation of a WRTL II exemption.           AR 1001–12.     Draft A simply created an\n\nexemption from the definition of “electioneering communication.” AR 1002–04. But Draft B\n\nincluded changes to the electioneering communications reporting requirements in 11 CFR\n\n§104.20, adding the language at issue in this case. AR 1006. The agency received only one\n\nletter responding to the change in the reporting requirements, and in it, J. Gerald Hebert and Paul\n\nS. Ryan of the Campaign Legal Center expressed their strong objection. AR 1024–26 (“We\n\nbelieve it would be a mistake of historic proportions for the Commission to go beyond the text of\n\nthe controlling opinion in WRTL.”). 12 The final rule was approved by the Commission on\n\nNovember 20, 2007.\n\n       Based upon this review of the entire record and the hearing transcript, the Court cannot\n\nconclude that the FEC “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation\n\n\n12      The Commission also received a letter strongly objecting to proposed language in the\ndraft Explanation and Justification which would have differentiated between for-profit\ncorporations and qualified non-profit corporations when applying the new limitation to the\nreporting requirements. AR 1127–28. This language did not appear in the final rule.\n                                                39\n\ffor its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”\n\nSee State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156,\n\n168 (1962). It is hard to put one’s finger upon any data that prompted the particular rule in\n\nquestion, or the specific material in the transcript that supports the agency’s statement in the\n\nExplanation and Justification that “witnesses at the Commission’s hearing testified that the effort\n\nnecessary to identify those persons who provided funds totaling $1,000 or more to a corporation\n\nor labor organization would be very costly and require an inordinate amount of effort.” 72 Fed.\n\nReg. at 72911. There was no testimony about how many organizations now covered by the\n\nregulatory regime would be affected by the burdens involved with compliance, what those\n\nburdens would actually entail, and what the costs would be.\n\n       The witnesses appeared to generally agree that neither the statute nor the existing\n\nregulations defining “contributors” as “donors” would call for the disclosure of the names of a\n\nfor-profit corporation’s commercial customers and investors, or names of all labor union\n\nmembers, since none of those individuals could fairly be characterized as “donors.” Thus, the\n\nconcerns that were expressed related largely to non-profit advocacy groups. In the Explanation\n\nand Justification that accompanied the final rule, the agency stated that a non-profit corporation’s\n\ncoffers would include “donations from persons who support the corporation’s mission,” but that\n\nthose “donors do not necessarily support the corporation’s electioneering communications.” 72\n\nFed. Reg. at 72911. But no testimony indicated how many non-profit organizations, if any,\n\ncollected contributions or dues or that would exceed the $1000 statutory threshold, how many\n\nindividuals made donations or paid dues in those amounts, or how difficult it would be to keep\n\ntrack of them. No evidence was adduced that would suggest that individuals contributing more\n\nthan $1000 to a non-profit would be likely to disagree with the messages to be conveyed by that\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\forganization in its electioneering communications. And nothing explained why the segregated\n\nbank account was not a suitable solution for any of the problems that were identified. So the\n\nCourt cannot find the regulation to be reasonable under the State Farm formulation.\n\n   IV.      The regulation contravenes the language and the purpose of the statute.\n\n         It is true that at the second step of the Chevron analysis, the reviewing court is required to\n\naccord appropriate weight to an agency’s interpretation of a statutory scheme that falls within its\n\nbailiwick. 467 U.S. at 844. But an agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statutory provision\n\nmust still be reasonable “in light of the language, legislative history, and policies of the statute.”\n\nShays v. FEC, 337 F. Supp. 2d 28, 78 (D.D.C. 2004), aff’d 414 F.3d 76 (D.C. Cir. 2005)\n\n(“Shays I”), quoting Republican National Committee v. FEC, 76 F.3d 400, 406 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n\nMoreover, in Shays III, the Court of Appeals declared: “[i]n applying Chevron’s second step and\n\nthe APA, we must reject administrative constructions of a statute that frustrate the policy that\n\nCongress sought to implement.” 528 F.3d at 918 (internal quotations and edits omitted). In light\n\nof those precedents, the FEC’s decision to take it upon itself to “limit” the statutory disclosure\n\nrequirements cannot be sustained, and for those reasons, in addition to those set forth above, the\n\nCourt does not find section 104.20(c)(9) to be a reasonable interpretation of the BCRA.\n\n         First, looking at the language of the statute, section 30104(f)(1) imposes its disclosure\n\nrequirements on “[e]very person who makes a disbursement for the direct costs of producing and\n\nairing electioneering communications in an aggregate amount in excess of $10,000 during any\n\ncalendar year.” 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(1). The BCRA defines “person” to include corporations\n\nand labor unions, 52 U.S.C. § 30101(11), and as the FEC acknowledged in its pleadings before\n\nthis Court, even before WRTL II, the disclosure rules applied to some corporations, in particular,\n\nthe non-profit corporations described in FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., 479 U.S.\n\n\n\n                                                  41\n\f238 (1986). See Def.’s Mem. [Dkt. # 24] at 6. And section 30104(f)(2) requires disclosure of\n\n“the names and addresses of all contributors who contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or\n\nmore,” 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2)(E)–(F) (emphasis added), with no limitation other than the\n\nthreshold amount.\n\n       It is true that the Court of Appeals has already stated that the words “contributors” and\n\n“contributed” can, on their face, be construed to include a purpose requirement.        Ctr. for\n\nIndividual Freedom v. Van Hollen, 694 F.3d at 111. But an interpretation that narrows the\n\napplication of the reporting provision would be inconsistent with the policies underlying the\n\nstatute. There can be no dispute that the concept of disclosure and transparency is fundamental\n\nto the BCRA. As the Court set out in some detail in its prior opinion, the legislative history of\n\nthe BCRA makes it clear that the purpose behind the disclosure requirements was to enable\n\nvoters to be informed about who was trying to influence their decisions. 147 Cong. Rec. S3022-\n\n05, S3034 (Mar. 28, 2001) (statement by Sen. Jeffords) (noting that Congress intended to\n\n“shine[] sunlight on the undisclosed expenditures for sham issue advertisements”); 147 Cong.\n\nRec. S3233-06, S3238 (April 2, 2001) (statement of Sen. Feinstein) (“The attacks come and no\n\none knows who is actually paying for them. I believe this is unethical. I believe it is unjust. I\n\nbelieve it is unreasonable and it must end.”). As the Supreme Court has explained, the disclosure\n\nprovisions were intended to prevent independent groups from running advertisements “‘while\n\nhiding behind dubious and misleading names’” so that “citizens [could] ‘make informed choices\n\nin the political marketplace.’” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 367, quoting McConnell, 540 U.S. at\n\n197.\n\n       Therefore, it was contrary to the policy goal that Congress intended to implement for the\n\nCommission to add limiting language to its regulations when the aim of that language was – as\n\n\n\n                                               42\n\fthe FEC put it – “to ensure that disclosure of the newly-permitted electioneering communications\n\nwould be narrowly tailored . . . .” Def.’s Mem. at 10. Congress did not call for narrow tailoring;\n\nit called for just the opposite.\n\n        And the new rule serves to frustrate the aim of the statute because the introduction of a\n\nsubjective test to the reporting regime creates an exception that has the potential to swallow the\n\nrule entirely. A donor can avoid reporting altogether by transmitting funds but remaining silent\n\nabout their intended use.\n\n        Moreover, the decision to reduce disclosure and transparency was not justified or\n\nnecessitated by the reasons the agency identified when the final rule was promulgated. The\n\nCommission posited that the donative purpose limitation was needed because the general\n\ntreasury of a corporation or labor organization is likely to contain funds derived from individuals\n\nwho do not necessarily support the entity’s electioneering communications, and that therefore,\n\ndisclosing the identity of those payors would not advance the goals underlying the reporting\n\nrequirements. 72 Fed. Reg. at 72911. But the same rationale applies equally to partnerships,\n\nunincorporated entities, and any other “persons,” and Congress determined that they would all be\n\nbound by the disclosure requirements anyway. See also Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 351 (“All\n\nspeakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic\n\nmarketplace to fund their speech.”). And, prior to WRTL II, the disclosure provisions already\n\napplied to some corporations – the MCFL organizations – which, like other non-profits, pursue a\n\nbroad range of educational and advocacy activities beyond the mere funding of electioneering\n\ncommunications. Furthermore, the agency’s statement that it would be too burdensome to\n\nrequire organizations to identify all “persons who provided funds,” see 72 Fed. Reg. at 72911, is\n\ninconsistent not only with the statute, but with the agency’s own regulations, because that is not\n\n\n\n                                                43\n\fwho had to be identified under the existing regime in the first place.            FEC regulations\n\nimplementing the BCRA reporting provisions require the disclosure of “the name and address of\n\neach donor who donated an amount aggregating $1,000 or more,” 11 CFR §104.20(c)(8)\n\n(emphasis added), not “persons who provided funds.” The Commission failed to articulate why\n\na for-profit corporation’s customers and investors, or a labor union’s members – all of whom\n\ntransfer funds in return for some consideration in the form of goods or services or an ownership\n\ninterest – would not be fully protected by the regulation’s limiting reporting requirements to\n\n“donors,” or why further elaboration on that term – rather than the interposition of an intent\n\nlimitation that could eviscerate the reporting rules – would not alleviate any lingering confusion.\n\nIn other words, the FEC had already clarified the ambiguous statutory term “contributors” in a\n\nmanner that largely cured the potential problems it identified.       And Congress had already\n\nprescribed a remedy for those organizations that found the identification of all individual donors\n\nto be too burdensome: the segregated bank account. See 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2)(E). 13\n\n       Since nothing about the WRTL II decision altered the operation of those regulations, it\n\nwas unreasonable to add an intent requirement that limited disclosure obligations for the\n\nsupposed purpose of implementing the changes brought about by WRTL II.                 Indeed, the\n\nCommission explicitly acknowledged in the Explanation and Justification for the rule that WRTL\n\nII did not authorize it to eliminate the reporting requirements. See 72 Fed. Reg. at 72901 (“Thus,\n\nbecause McConnell has upheld the definition of ECs, as well as the reporting and disclaimer\n\nrequirements, as facially valid, and because WRTL II did not address these provisions, the\n\n\n\n\n13     The fact that these accounts may be used to receive contributions from individual donors\nonly does not make them an unsuitable vehicle for eliminating the burdens of organizational\ndisclosure; it was the cost and effort that might be involved in reporting individual donations that\nwas what troubled the agency.\n                                                44\n\fCommission has no mandate to revise the underlying definition of ‘electioneering\n\ncommunication’ or remove the reporting and disclaimer requirements.”)\n\n       Finally, the regulation cannot be supported on the grounds that the Commission fairly\n\nbalanced the need for disclosure against sensitive First Amendment and privacy concerns. See\n\nDef.’s Mem. at 33–36; CIF Supplemental Mem. [Dkt. # 93] at 5–7. This was not a justification\n\nadvanced in the Explanation and Justification, and more important, those arguments have been\n\nforeclosed by the Supreme Court. In Citizens United, the Court clearly found that the disclosure\n\nrequirements in the BCRA – even those that apply to ads that are not express advocacy or its\n\nfunctional equivalent – do not impinge upon constitutional rights, see Citizens United, 558 U.S.\n\nat 367–69. See also Independence Institute v. FEC, Civ. Action No. 14-1500 (CKK), 2014 WL\n\n4959403 (D.D.C.

But the intervenor-defendants, the Center for\n\nIndividual Freedom (“CFIF”) and the Hispanic Leadership Fund (“HLF”) did, and the United\n\nStates Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the case should not have\n\nbeen decided at the first Chevron step.       The Circuit Court found the BCRA’s disclosure\n\nprovisions to be ambiguous, “especially when viewed in the light of the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecisions” in Citizens United and WRTL II, and it remanded the case for consideration of the\n\nregulation at Chevron step two. Van Hollen, 694 F.3d at 110, 112.\n\n       The Court now concludes that the promulgation of 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9) was\n\narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law and that the regulation is an unreasonable interpretation\n\nof the BCRA for several reasons. First, the Commission initiated the rulemaking process for the\n\nstated purpose of responding to the decision in WRTL II, but nothing the Supreme Court did in\n\nthat case provides a basis for narrowing the disclosure rules enacted by Congress. WRTL II dealt\n\nsolely with the question of whether the statutory ban on corporate and labor organization funding\n\nof electioneering communications could withstand an as-applied constitutional challenge. And\n\nin answering that question, the Court did not find any need to address the BCRA’s disclosure\n\nrequirements.\n\n\n\n\n2       Chevron instructs the reviewing court to consider first “whether Congress has directly\nspoken to the precise question at issue,” and if so, “the court, as well as the agency, must give\neffect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.” 467 U.S. at 842–43.\n                                                 2\n\f       Second, there is little or nothing in the administrative record that would support the\n\nCommission’s decision to introduce a limitation into the broad disclosure rules in the BCRA.\n\nNeither the petition for rulemaking nor the original notice of proposed rulemaking proposed\n\naltering the disclosure requirements for corporations and labor unions. None of the commenters\n\nasked the agency to amend the disclosure rules to include a purpose requirement, and the\n\nCommission did not incorporate the purpose requirement in the new rule until after the notice\n\nand comment period and the hearing had been concluded. The only post-hearing comment\n\nreceived in response to the newly incorporated language strongly opposed its inclusion.\n\n       Finally, the regulation’s purpose requirement is inconsistent with the statutory language\n\nand purpose of the BCRA. Congress passed the disclosure provisions of the BCRA to promote\n\ntransparency and to ensure that members of the public would be aware of who was trying to\n\ninfluence their votes just before an election.       The added purpose requirement in section\n\n104.20(c)(9) thwarts that objective by creating an easily exploited loophole that allows the true\n\nsponsors of advertisements to hide behind dubious and misleading names. Based on these\n\nconsiderations, the Court will vacate 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9), and it will grant plaintiff’s motion\n\nfor summary judgment.\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n       Over the course of seven years, the Supreme Court of the United States weakened, and\n\neventually invalidated entirely, the prohibition on the use of corporate and union treasury funds\n\nto finance electioneering communications.

In the midst of this changing legal environment, the Commission began a\n\nrulemaking process and solicited public comment “generally regarding the effect of the\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\f[WRTL II] decision on the Commission’s rules governing corporate and labor organization\n\nfunding of electioneering communications, the definition of ‘electioneering communication,’ and\n\nthe   rules   governing   reporting   of   electioneering   communications.” 3    Electioneering\n\nCommunications, 72 Fed. Reg. 50261, 50262 (proposed Aug. 31, 2007). As part of that process,\n\nthe Commission offered two alternative ways to implement the WRTL II decision: “The first\n\nalternative would incorporate the new exemption into the rules prohibiting the use of corporate\n\nand labor organization funds for electioneering communications in 11 [C.F.R.] part 114. The\n\n\n3      Section 30104(f)(2) of the BCRA requires the following disclosures:\n\n               (E)     If the disbursements were paid out of a segregated bank account\n               which consists of funds contributed . . . directly to this account for\n               electioneering communications, the names and addresses of all\n               contributors who contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to\n               that account . . . . [; or]\n\n               (F)    If the disbursements were paid out of funds not described in\n               subparagraph (E), the names and addresses of all contributors who\n               contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or more to the person making\n               the disbursement during the period beginning on the first day of the\n               preceding calendar year and ending on the disclosure date.\n\n52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2)(E)–(F).\n\n       Section 104.207(c)(7)–(8) of FEC’s implementing regulations generally tracks the\nlanguage of section 30104(f)(2)(E)–(F), except that it substitutes the words “donor” and\n“donated” for “contributor” and “contributed.” It calls for the following disclosures:\n\n               (7)(i) If the disbursements were paid exclusively from a segregated bank\n               account . . . , the name and address of each donor who donated an amount\n               aggregating $1,000 or more to the segregated bank account, aggregating\n               since the first day of the preceding calendar year; or . . . .\n\n               (8)     If the disbursements were not paid exclusively from a segregated\n               bank account described in paragraph (c)(7) of this section, . . . the name\n               and address of each donor who donated an amount aggregating $1,000 or\n               more to the person making the disbursement, aggregating since the first\n               day of the preceding calendar year.\n\n11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(7)(i), (c)(8) (2014).\n                                                 4\n\fsecond alternative would incorporate the new exemption into the definition of ‘electioneering\n\ncommunication’ in 11 [C.F.R.] § 100.29.” Id. Under the first alternative, corporations and labor\n\norganizations making the sorts of electioneering communications deemed permissible in WRTL\n\nII would be permitted to use general treasury funds for that purpose, but they would be subject to\n\nthe same reporting requirements as other entities. Id. As part of that alternative, the agency also\n\nproposed changes to the rules that would enable those organizations to establish segregated bank\n\naccounts for the funding of electioneering communications as certain individuals were already\n\npermitted to do. Id. Adopting Alternative II would have exempted the WRTL II ads from the\n\ndefinition of electioneering communication in 11 C.F.R. § 100.29 entirely, thereby eliminating\n\nboth the disclosure and financing restrictions for those ads. Id. at 50263.\n\n       In December 2007, the agency adopted a variant of the first alternative. It promulgated\n\n11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9), which included the following language:\n\n               If the disbursements were made by a corporation or labor organization\n               pursuant to 11 [C.F.R.] § 114.15, the name and address of each person\n               who made a donation aggregating $1,000 or more to the corporation or\n               labor organization, aggregating since the first day of the precedent\n               calendar year, which was made for the purpose of furthering\n               electioneering communications.\n\n11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9) (emphasis added).\n\n       The Commission provided several explanations for adding this new “purpose” or “intent”\n\nrequirement to the corporate and labor organization disclosure regulation. First, it noted that\n\nthose entities’ “general treasury funds are often largely comprised of funds received from\n\ninvestors,” donors, customers, or members “who may not necessarily support the organization’s\n\nelectioneering communications.” Electioneering Communications, Final Rule, 72 Fed. Reg.\n\n72899, 72911 (Dec. 26, 2007). And second, it stated that compliance with the disclosure rules as\n\npreviously written would impose a heavy burden on corporations and labor organizations:\n\n                                                 5\n\f“[W]itnesses at the Commission’s hearing testified that the effort necessary to identify those\n\npersons who provided funds totaling $1,000 or more . . . would be very costly and require an\n\ninordinate amount of effort.” Id. The Commission then concluded that “the policy underlying\n\nthe disclosure provisions of BCRA [was] properly met by requiring corporations and labor\n\norganizations to disclose and report only those persons who made donations for the purpose of\n\nfunding [electioneering communications].” Id.\n\n       Plaintiff Chris Van Hollen – concerned that “corporations have exploited the enormous\n\nloophole [the new regulation] created,” Compl. ¶ 29 – filed this case against the FEC under the\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”). 5 U.S.C. § 706. He argued that the agency exceeded its\n\nstatutory authority in promulgating that regulation and that the regulation is also arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, and contrary to law under the APA. Two months after plaintiff filed his complaint,\n\nCFIF and HLF filed motions to intervene as defendants [Dkt. # 14 & 15], and the Court granted\n\nthose motions pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a).

After determining that\n\nplaintiff had standing to bring his APA challenge, the Court conducted a Chevron analysis and\n\nstruck down 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9) as inconsistent with text of the statute. The Commission\n\ndid not appeal the Court’s order, but intervenor-defendants CFIF and HLF did. Van Hollen, 694\n\nF.3d at 110.

Id. at 112.\n\n       The D.C. Circuit remanded the case with instructions to the District Court to refer the\n\nmatter first to the Commission to ascertain whether the agency intended to engage in further\n\nrulemaking to clarify the regulatory regime.

The standard to be applied at Chevron step two\n\n         This Court is bound by the Circuit’s determination that section 30104(f)(2)(E)–(F) is\n\nambiguous, and therefore, it must now address the question of whether the implementing\n\nregulation, 11 C.F.R. § 104.20(c)(9), is “based on a permissible construction of the statute.”\n\nChevron, 467 U.S. at 843. At the second step of the Chevron analysis, the reviewing court must\n\ngive “considerable weight” to an agency’s interpretation of a statutory scheme it has been\n\n“entrusted to administer;” the “court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory\n\nprovision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.” Id. at 844. As\n\nthe D.C. Circuit put it in Serono Laboratories, Inc. v.

Van Hollen,\n\n694 F.3d at 112. In State Farm, the Supreme Court reiterated that under the arbitrary and\n\ncapricious standard, “a reviewing court may not set aside an agency rule that is rational, based on\n\nconsideration of the relevant factors, and within the scope of the authority delegated to the\n\nagency by the statute.” 463 U.S. at 42. The Supreme Court went on to explain the process in\n\ngreater detail:\n\n                  The scope of review under the “arbitrary and capricious” standard is\n                  narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\n                  Nevertheless, the agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a\n                  satisfactory explanation for its action including a “rational connection\n                  between the facts found and the choice made.” In reviewing that\n                  explanation, we must “consider whether the decision was based on a\n\n                                                   8\n\f               consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear\n               error of judgment.” Normally, an agency rule would be arbitrary and\n               capricious if the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not\n               intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of\n               the problem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the\n               evidence before the agency, or is so implausible that it could not be\n               ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise.\n\nId. at 43 (citations omitted).

In Shays II, the court addressed the standing question at length, and then it\n\naffirmed the District Court’s invalidation of a set of FEC rules as too lax. See 414 F.3d at 83–96.\n\nThe first two rules failed at the threshold Chevron inquiry, as the court found that they\n\ncontravened the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress, and the Circuit Court upheld the\n\nDistrict Court’s invalidation of the other three rules on APA grounds, noting that it did not need\n\nto reach the second Chevron question of whether the rules were reasonable because the agency\n\nhad failed to advance any justification for them. Id. at 96–97.\n\n\n\n                                                 9\n\f         But in Shays III, the Court of Appeals did directly address the second step of the Chevron\n\nanalysis when it approved the District Court’s “thorough” rejection of a set of FEC rules based\n\non the finding that they were “either contrary to BCRA’s purpose or arbitrary and capricious.”\n\n528 F.3d at 919. The Court stated: “[i]n applying Chevron’s second step and the APA, we must\n\nreject administrative constructions of [a] statute . . . that frustrate the policy that Congress sought\n\nto implement.” Id. (alterations in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n         So, under the precedent that this Court is bound to follow, the challenged rule must also\n\nbe tested against the policy that BCRA was intended to advance.\n\n   II.      The challenged regulation is not supported by the agency’s explanation for the\n            regulation.\n\n         The starting point of the second step of the Chevron analysis must be the stated reason\n\nbehind the regulation, which is illuminated by both the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking\n\n(“NPRM”) and the Explanation and Justification that accompanied the announcement of the final\n\nrule. The rulemaking was supposed to be about one narrow subject: what to do to implement\n\nthe Supreme Court’s decision in WRTL II. See 72 Fed. Reg. at 50261 (“These proposed rules\n\nwould implement the Supreme Court’s decision in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc., which\n\nheld that the prohibition on the use of corporate and labor organization funds for electioneering\n\ncommunications      is   unconstitutional   as   applied    to   certain   types   of   electioneering\n\ncommunications.”); see also id. at 50262 (“The Commission is initiating this rulemaking to\n\nimplement the Supreme Court’s decision in WRTL II. . . . The Commission is seeking public\n\ncomment on two proposed alternative ways to implement the WRTL II decision in the rules\n\ngoverning electioneering communications.”). To assess the reasonableness of the regulations,\n\nthen, one must first ascertain what the Supreme Court decided in that case that required\n\nimplementation.\n\n                                                  10\n\f       WRTL II dealt with the constitutionality of section 203 of the BCRA, 2 U.S.C.\n\n§ 441(b)(2), as applied to particular advertisements that the Wisconsin advocacy organization\n\nplanned to broadcast. 551 U.S. at 449. At that time, section 203 made it a crime for a\n\ncorporation or labor union to use its general treasury funds to pay for any “electioneering\n\ncommunication,” 2 U.S.C. § 441b(b)(2), that is, a broadcast, cable, or satellite communication\n\nthat refers to a candidate for federal office and is aired within a prescribed time period before an\n\nelection. 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(3)(A).\n\n        WRTL II was not the first time the Supreme Court addressed section 203: the opinion\n\nfollowed McConnell, in which the Court considered a series of facial challenges to multiple\n\nprovisions of the statute. 540 U.S. at 114. As part of that exercise, the McConnell Court found\n\nthe regulation of corporate and labor union expenditures in section 203 to be constitutional on its\n\nface. Id. at 203–09. The plaintiffs claimed that section 203 was overbroad and that it violated\n\nthe First Amendment because it covered not only campaign speech, or “express advocacy,” but\n\nalso more general “issue advocacy” that might mention a candidate for federal office. Id. at 205–\n\n07. The Court disagreed and found that the compelling governmental interests that justified the\n\nimposition of restrictions on express campaign speech would also apply to advertisements that\n\nare the “functional equivalent” of express campaign speech. Id. at 204–06. Thus, it concluded\n\nthat even if one assumed that section 203 would “inhibit some constitutionally protected\n\ncorporate and union speech,” plaintiffs had not met their heavy burden of establishing that the\n\nprovision was overbroad and that it could never be constitutionally enforced. Id. at 207; see also\n\nWRTL II, 551 U.S. at 457 (“The [McConnell] Court concluded that there was no overbreadth\n\nconcern to the extent the speech in question was the ‘functional equivalent’ of express campaign\n\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fspeech.”). The McConnell opinion did not further define “functional equivalent” or undertake to\n\nresolve any future as-applied challenges to the law.\n\n       It was WRTL II that directly presented an as-applied challenge to section 203. The non-\n\nprofit issue advocacy corporation sought to broadcast radio advertisements that clearly identified\n\na particular Senator running for re-election during the period when “electioneering\n\ncommunications” would be illegal under section 203. 551 U.S. at 458–61. The Supreme Court\n\nreviewed its decision in McConnell and explained that resolving an as-applied challenge required\n\nit to determine at the outset “whether the speech at issue is the ‘functional equivalent’ of speech\n\nexpressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office, or instead a ‘genuine\n\nissue a[d].’” Id. at 457 (alteration in original), quoting McConnell, 540 U.S. at 206. The Court\n\nobserved that McConnell did not adopt any test to be used as the standard for future as-applied\n\nchallenges, and so, it found it necessary to do so. Id. at 464.\n\n       The Court determined that in order to safeguard First Amendment rights, it was necessary\n\nthat the standard be an objective one, “focusing on the substance of the communication rather\n\nthan amorphous considerations of intent and effect.” Id. at 469.\n\n               It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow parties to resolve disputes\n               quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome\n               litigation. And it must eschew the open-ended rough-and-tumble of\n               factors, which invites complex argument in a trial court and a virtually\n               inevitable appeal. In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to\n               protecting rather than stifling speech.\n\n               In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the\n               functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of\n               no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a\n               specific candidate.\n\nId. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f       This then is the sole holding of WRTL II: that the section 203 prohibition against the use\n\nof a corporation’s or labor organization’s general funds for electioneering communications can\n\nonly be applied to express campaign ads or to those issue ads that can only be reasonably\n\ninterpreted as a plea to vote for or against a particular candidate.\n\n       Applying the new test, the majority concluded that the particular ads at issue were not the\n\nfunctional equivalent of express campaign speech, and that since the interests that would justify\n\nrestricting corporate campaign speech or its functional equivalent do not support restrictions on\n\nissue advocacy, section 203 was unconstitutional as applied to WRTL’s ads. Id. at 457. 4\n\n       Notably, the opinion in WRTL II said absolutely nothing about the reporting requirements\n\nthat attach when an individual or a group disburses funds to pay for express campaign ads or\n\nthose issue ads that fall within the definition of electioneering communications. The plaintiff\n\nhad specifically disavowed any challenge to the reporting provisions, noting that the ads it\n\nsought to run would be subject to the transparency that was the goal of the BCRA. See In the\n\nmatter of Electioneering Communications: Notice 2007-16 (“Rulemaking Hr’g”) (Oct. 17,\n\n2007), Administrative Record (“AR”) 622–23 [Dkt. # 17-5] (quoting WRTL’s brief: “Because\n\nWRTL does not challenge the disclaimer in the disclosure requirements there will be no ads done\n\nunder misleading names.        There will continue to be full disclosure of all electioneering\n\ncommunications both as to disclaimer and public reports.               The whole system will be\n\ntransparent.”). This raises the question: how did a Supreme Court opinion lifting the ban on\n\n\n\n\n4       The Court was sharply divided on this point. Justice Souter, in an opinion joined by\nJustices Stevens, Ginsburg, and Breyer, wrote: “it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads\nare constitutionally subject to regulation under McConnell.” Id. at 525 (Souter, J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                                  13\n\fWRTL’s ads prompt the agency to revise the reporting requirements? After all, the Supreme\n\nCourt had already squarely addressed those reporting requirements in McConnell. 5\n\n       After the WRTL II decision was handed down, a petition for rulemaking was filed. The\n\npetition – filed by the James Madison Center for Free Speech, which was represented by the\n\nsame counsel who had represented WRTL – did not call for a change in the disclosure\n\nrequirements either.   Petition for Rulemaking: Protecting “Genuine Issue Ads” from the\n\n“Electioneering Communication” Prohibition & Repealing 11 C.F.R. § 100.22(b), James\n\nMadison Ctr. for Free Speech, AR 96 [Dkt. # 17-2]. Instead, the organization urged the agency\n\nto undertake a rulemaking to make two changes to the FEC’s regulations in the wake of WRTL\n\nII: 1) to recognize the protection accorded to genuine issue ads in WRTL II by promulgating a\n\nrule limiting the ban on corporate spending on “electioneering communications” to ads that meet\n\nthe WRTL II definition; and 2) to repeal 11 C.F.R. § 100.22(b), the Commission’s definition of\n\n“expressly advocating.” Id., AR 98–103.\n\n       In response to that petition, the agency published a NPRM and requested comments on\n\nproposed rules that “would implement the Supreme Court’s decision in FEC v. Wisconsin Right\n\nto Life, Inc.” 72 Fed. Reg. at 50261. Acknowledging that “[t]he plaintiff in [WRTL II] . . . did\n\n\n5      The McConnell plaintiffs had complained that the requirements should not extend to both\nexpress and issue advocacy, but the Supreme Court unequivocally rejected that contention,\nquoting the District Court opinion at length and noting its approval:\n\n              We agree with the District Court that the important state interests that\n              prompted the Buckley Court to uphold FECA’s disclosure requirements –\n              providing the electorate with information, deterring actual corruption and\n              avoiding any appearance thereof, and gathering the data necessary to\n              enforce more substantive electioneering restrictions – apply in full to\n              BCRA. Accordingly, Buckley amply supports application of FECA\n              § 304’s disclosure requirements to the entire range of “electioneering\n              communications.”\n\n540 U.S. at 196 (footnote omitted).\n                                              14\n\fnot contest . . . the reporting requirement in section [30104](f)(1)” and therefore that the case did\n\nnot directly impact the BCRA’s reporting requirements, id. at 50262, the agency nonetheless set\n\nout two alternative approaches for how it could revise the then-established disclosure\n\nrequirements to apply to the newly allowed WRTL II ads.\n\n       Under the first alternative, the agency observed that “corporations and labor\n\norganizations that make [WRTL II] electioneering communications . . . totaling over $10,000 in a\n\ncalendar year must file reports like other entities that make electioneering communications.” Id.\n\nat 50271. It proposed amending subsection 104.20(c)(7), which deals with the use of segregated\n\nbank accounts to fund electioneering communications, to include separate subparts covering non-\n\nWRTL II and WRTL II ads so that corporations and labor unions would be authorized to create\n\nsuch accounts to fund the permissible ads and would report contributions to the accounts\n\naccordingly. Id. The FEC also recognized that under Alternative I, corporations and unions\n\nwould be permitted to expend general treasury funds for WRTL II ads. Id. In contemplating that\n\ncircumstance, it posed a series of questions about how the agency should administer the\n\ndisclosure requirements established by section 104.20(c)(8) in that context:\n\n               Under the proposed regulations, how would a corporation or labor\n               organization report an electioneering communication funded with general\n               treasury funds? If the corporation or labor organization does not pay for\n               the electioneering communication from an account described in proposed\n               sections 104.20(c)(7)(ii) and 114.14(d)(2)(i), would the corporation or\n               labor organization be required to report “the name and address of each\n               donor who donated an amount aggregating $1,000 or more” to the\n               corporation or labor organization during the relevant reporting period, as\n               required by [52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2)(F)] and 11 [C.F.R. §] 104.20(c)(8)?\n               If so, how would a corporation or labor organization determine which\n               receipts qualify as “donations”? Should the Commission limit the\n               “donation” reporting requirement to funds that are donated for the express\n               purpose of making electioneering communications?\n\n\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fId. Although the agency posed this question, the first alternative set out in the Notice did not\n\ninclude any sort of limiting language.\n\n        Alternative 2 embodied a simpler approach. Under that option, the agency proposed that\n\n“a communication that qualifies for [the WRTL II] exemption in proposed section 100.29(c)(6)\n\nwould be exempted from the definition of ‘electioneering communication.’” Id. at 50272. In\n\nother words, all WRTL II communications would be exempt from the “regulations imposing\n\nreporting requirements on persons making ‘electioneering communications,’” while “the\n\nreporting requirements applicable to all communications that continue to meet the definition of\n\n‘electioneering communication’ would remain unchanged.” Id. Thus, neither of the alternatives\n\nproposed in the FEC’s notice incorporated the specific limiting language that is the subject of\n\nthis litigation.\n\n        The Commission received twenty-seven written comments on the proposed rules, and it\n\nheld a two day hearing at which fifteen witnesses testified. 72 Fed. Reg. at 72900. After the\n\nhearing and before it promulgated the final rule, the Commission added the language that is at\n\nissue in this case – “made for the purpose of furthering electioneering communications” – for the\n\nfirst time. See Memorandum on Draft Final Rule on Electioneering Communication to the\n\nCommission (Nov. 16, 2007), AR 1006 (setting forth its proposed draft B of the regulation). The\n\nagency received only one comment in response to the newly proposed language, which strongly\n\nopposed the proposal.      Letter from the Campaign Legal Center to the Federal Election\n\nCommission (Nov. 19, 2007), AR 1024–25. 6\n\n\n\n\n6       Another commenter recommended that the Commission adopt Draft A. AR 1018–19.\n                                               16\n\f       This review of the procedural history tends to diminish the validity of the regulation\n\nunder the second level of the Chevron analysis because it demonstrates that the Commission’s\n\naction was unmoored from the stated basis for embarking on a rulemaking in the first place. 7\n\n       Before WRTL II, the McConnell Court upheld the disclosure provisions on their face,\n\nwith the understanding that they applied to individuals, to those corporations and unions using\n\nsegregated bank accounts, and to “groups” that had many individual donors. The rules also\n\napplied to some corporations, see FEC v. Mass. Citizens for Life, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111782\"><a href=\"/opinion/111782/federal-election-commn-v-massachusetts-citizens-for-life-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986), even\n\nif that group was small.\n\n       WRTL II left the reporting provisions untouched.\n\n       And even after WRTL II, when the restrictions on corporate and labor union spending\n\nwere struck down entirely in Citizens United, and the Supreme Court was well aware that the\n\nstatutory reporting requirements would now apply to a large number of ads funded by those\n\norganizations, it again left the reporting requirements untouched. 558 U.S. at 368 (alterations in\n\noriginal) (citations omitted) (“[Citizens United] contends that the governmental interest in\n\nproviding information to the electorate does not justify requiring disclaimers for any commercial\n\nadvertisements, including the ones at issue here. We disagree. . . . The disclaimers required by\n\n\n7       Indeed, multiple witnesses at the rulemaking hearing specifically cautioned that it would\nbe inappropriate for the Commission to take up a change to the disclosure rules when the sole\npurpose of the rulemaking was supposed to be to conform the existing regulations to the WRTL II\nopinion. See, e.g., Rulemaking Hr’g, AR 511 (testimony of Mark Elias) (imploring the agency\nto address the Supreme Court ruling on electioneering communications and do no more: “[y]ou\nare not faced with questions about disclosure”); id. 517 (testimony of Allison Hayward) (joining\nElias and “counseling restraint”); id. 647–49 (testimony of Donald Simon) (arguing that the\nCommission was engaging in a “bait and switch” because “[t]he plaintiff in WRTL did not\nchallenge the [s]ection 201 disclosure requirements and repeatedly reassured the Supreme Court\nthat if it did permit corporations to make some electioneering communications there would\ncontinue to be full disclosure . . . . But now having won the [s]ection 203 argument on that basis\nmany urge the Commission to reach out and eviscerate the disclosure requirement”); id. at 807–\n08 (testimony of Brian Svoboda) (urging the Commission to proceed narrowly and do little more\nthan WRTL II required and noting that WRTL II did not address disclosure).\n                                               17\n\fsection 311 ‘provid[e] the electorate with information’ and ‘insure that the voters are fully\n\ninformed’ about the person or group who is speaking.”).\n\n          Therefore, the Court finds that it was unreasonable for the FEC to alter the statutory\n\nreporting requirements on the stated grounds that it was implementing the Supreme Court’s\n\ndecision in WRTL II. There was nothing about implementing the new definition of “functional\n\nequivalent of express advocacy” for purposes of enforcing section 203 that required narrowing\n\nthe disclosure requirements in 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2).\n\n   III.      The record does not reflect that the FEC examined the relevant data and\n             articulated a rational connection between the facts found and the choice it made.\n\n          In addition to considering the regulation in light of its stated purpose, the Court must also\n\nreview the record to determine whether the agency fully explained how its choice was predicated\n\nupon data it accumulated during the rulemaking process. Here, the parties did not deal with the\n\nrecord before the agency in any detail in their briefs. So the Court found it necessary to review\n\nthe record in its entirety in order to undertake the analysis described in State Farm. And it found\n\nthat there is a very poor fit between the rule that was promulgated and both the question and the\n\nevidence that were before the agency at the time.\n\n          As an initial point, the Court notes that it was not until after the notice and comment\n\nperiod that the Commission announced that it had decided to depart from the proposed rules set\n\nforth in the NPRM and to do something entirely different – to limit corporate and labor union\n\ndisclosure requirements to cover only the names and addresses of donors who intended to fund\n\nan electioneering communication. 72 Fed. Reg. at 72911 (“As discussed in detail below, after\n\nconsideration of the comments, the Commission has decided to depart from the rules proposed in\n\nthe NPRM . . . .”). Although the mere fact that changes were made to a proposed rule after the\n\nnotice and comment period does not itself invalidate the rule or the process, see Air Transport\n\n                                                   18\n\fAss’n of Am. v.

Cir. 1984), the chronology here\n\nhas an impact upon this portion of the State Farm analysis. As the record stands, none of the\n\ncomments received during the NPRM stage or at the Commission’s hearing addressed the\n\nlanguage that the Commission eventually adopted, and the one post-hearing comment that did\n\naddress the proposed course of action vehemently opposed it. The record is therefore largely\n\ndevoid of evidence that supports the specific language that the Commission used to curtail the\n\ndisclosure requirements in the case of corporations and labor organizations.\n\n       The record also lacks evidence that supports the Commission’s decision to alter the\n\ndisclosure regulations in the first place. In the Explanation and Justification that accompanied\n\nthe promulgation of the final rule, the Commission stated that the disclosure regulation\n\ngoverning corporations and labor organizations that paid for electioneering campaigns would be\n\ntailored so that those entities need “disclose only the identities of those persons who made a\n\ndonation aggregating $1,000 or more specifically for the purpose of furthering [electioneering\n\ncommunications] made by that” entity. 72 Fed. Reg. at 72911 (emphasis added). It offered the\n\nfollowing explanation in support of its decision:\n\n               A corporation’s general treasury funds are often largely comprised of\n               funds received from investors such as shareholders who have acquired\n               stock in the corporation and customers who have purchased the\n               corporation’s products or services, or in the case of a non-profit\n               corporation, donations from persons who support the corporation’s\n               mission. These investors, customers, and donors do not necessarily\n               support the corporation’s electioneering communications. Likewise, the\n               general treasury funds of labor organizations and incorporated\n               membership organizations are composed of member dues obtained from\n               individuals and other members who may not necessarily support the\n               organization’s electioneering communications.\n\nId. The agency also noted – without further specific citations to the record or testimony – that\n\n“witnesses at the Commission’s hearing testified that the effort necessary to identify those\n\n\n\n                                                19\n\fpersons who provided funds totaling $1,000 or more to a corporation or labor organization would\n\nbe very costly and require an inordinate amount of effort.” Id. Based on those considerations,\n\nthe agency then summarily concluded that “the policy underlying the disclosure provisions of\n\nBCRA [was] properly met by requiring corporations and labor organizations to disclose and\n\nreport only those persons who made donations for the purpose of funding [electioneering\n\ncommunications].” Id.\n\n       Plaintiff does not dispute the agency’s representation that at the time WRTL II was\n\ndecided, it was anticipated that there would be a significant increase in the number of\n\nadvertisements sponsored by corporations and labor unions. See 551 U.S. at 535–36 (Souter, J.,\n\ndissenting). But the written comments submitted to the agency and the testimony at the hearing\n\ndid not supply grounds for a narrowing of the reporting requirements.           Although some\n\ncommenters raised concerns about the burdens that the disclosure rules might impose, those\n\nconcerns were generally presented in the context of urging the agency to define electioneering\n\ncommunications clearly and narrowly, so that neither the prohibition nor the reporting\n\nrequirements would apply to genuine issue advertisements or commercial speech.              No\n\ncommenters provided data to quantify the burden that this change in the law might impose on\n\ncorporations or labor unions, and no written submissions actually asked the Commission to limit\n\nthe disclosure rules to contributions made for the purpose of funding electioneering\n\ncommunications.\n\n       Four of the commenters did not discuss the question of whether the reporting rules should\n\nbe changed in their comments at all. See Comments of the James Madison Center for Free\n\nSpeech, AR 96–103 (the organization that petitioned for the rulemaking); Comments of the\n\nAmerican Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Inc., AR 222–27; Comments of the Thomas\n\n\n\n                                              20\n\fJefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression and Comments of the Media Institute, AR\n\n249–62.    And although there were several commenters that did mention disclosure, they\n\ngenerally mentioned it in the context of advancing their position that their issue ads should not be\n\nsubject to any regulation. They favored the approach embodied in Alternative 2 – establishing\n\nan exclusion to the definition of electioneering communications for the type of speech protected\n\nby WRTL II – and observed that excluding constitutionally protected communications from the\n\ndefinition of electioneering communications would also mean that the reporting requirements\n\nwould not apply to them. See, e.g., Comments of National Association of Realtors, AR 376–82;\n\nsee also Comments of Citizens United, AR 298–323. 8\n\n       For example, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the American\n\nAdvertising Federation, and the Association of National Advertisers sought clarification that\n\ntheir commercial and business advertisements were fully shielded by the Constitution and not\n\nsubject to either the prohibitions or the reporting requirements in the BCRA. See Comments of\n\nthe American Association of Advertising Agencies, the American Advertising Federation, and\n\nthe Association of National Advertisers, AR 231–41. They favored a broad safe harbor that\n\nwould clearly distinguish commercial speech from prohibited communications and noted:\n\n“There is no legal rationale for subjecting to the electioneering communication reporting regime\n\nads that are protected under the WRTL II decision. Further, such an obligation would impose\n\n\n8       Citizens United also mentioned disclosure in passing in its comments in favor of the\nadoption of Alternative 2 instead of Alternative 1. The organization was concerned that\nadvertisements for its books and documentary films could include references to candidates for\nfederal elective office. It took the position that the FEC was obligated by WRTL II to address\ngeneral advertising for businesses, products, and services, and that it should do so by exempting\nbusiness advertising from the definition of electioneering communications. In that context, it\nnoted: “Also, from a practical standpoint, we believe the disclosure requirements of Alternative\n1 would be extremely difficult to implement because ads for products and services are often\nfinanced by investment capital and sales revenues, not reportable contributions.” Comments of\nCitizens United, AR 309.\n                                                21\n\fsignificant burdens on advertisers and would chill the full exercise of their First Amendment\n\nrights.”     Id. 239.   The advertisers pointed out that “the legal underpinnings for reporting\n\narticulated in Buckley are wholly absent for ads protected by the WRTL II decision[,]” and\n\nconcluded, “[a] reporting and disclosure regime is inconsistent with the zone of safety created by\n\nthe Supreme Court for advertisements that can reasonably be interpreted as concerning\n\nsomething other than an election campaign.” Id. 240.\n\n           The Free Speech Coalition, Inc. and the Free Speech and Education Fund, Inc. echoed\n\nthose concerns, and they called for the promulgation of a narrow definition of “express advocacy\n\nand its functional equivalent” that would in turn limit the applicability of the reporting and\n\ndisclosure requirements. Comments of the Free Speech Coalition, Inc. and the Free Speech &\n\nEducation Fund, Inc., AR 325–35. “[I]f the funding limitations placed upon a broadcast of a\n\ngenuine issue ad or any other broadcast communication is found to be unconstitutional, then the\n\nreporting and disclosure requirement that would otherwise be attached to the ad because it is the\n\nfunctional equivalent of express advocacy cannot be justified by the Buckley standard . . . .” Id.\n\n330. The two free speech organizations warned that disclosure and reporting requirements posed\n\nthe same dangers and should be subject to the same strict scrutiny as absolute prohibitions if they\n\nimposed any burden on constitutionally protected speech.        Id. 329; see also Comments of\n\nIndependent Sector, AR 365 (advocating Alternative 2 – excluding issue ads from the definition\n\nof electioneering communications – over Alternative 1 because “issue advocacy is a fundamental\n\nright and purpose of nonprofit organizations” and a “distinction between the funding of ads,\n\nwhich the Supreme Court struck down, and the disclosure of funding for that right cannot be\n\nmaintained. . . . Aside from the daunting complexity involved in following FEC procedures,\n\ndonor disclosure requirements present significant privacy concerns that are not outweighed by\n\n\n\n                                                22\n\fthe government interest in disclosure. . . . We are also concerned about the chilling effect of\n\nproposed Alternative One on advocacy rights”); Comments of OMB Watch, AR 384–88 (calling\n\nfor a more specific general rule exempting issue advocacy and grassroots lobbying from the\n\nstatutory prohibitions and objecting to the imposition of any reporting requirements on\n\nbroadcasts that should be exempt). 9\n\n       And similarly, the American Taxpayers Alliance and Americans for Limited Government\n\nalso warned that compelled disclosure could infringe upon or chill the exercise of First\n\nAmendment rights and rejected the notion that the Commission could regulate or impose\n\nreporting requirements on issue ads that fell short of express advocacy or its functional\n\nequivalent. Comments of the American Taxpayers Alliance and Comments of Americans for\n\nLimited Government, AR 416–29.\n\n       In sum, the commenters who expressed concerns about the burdens or the\n\nconstitutionality of the reporting requirements were primarily advancing the view that certain\n\nadvertising should fall outside of the scope of the regulatory regime altogether. None of them\n\ncalled for or even discussed revising or narrowing of the reporting requirements for corporations\n\nand labor unions sponsoring genuine electioneering communications: their aim was to shrink the\n\npool of advertisements to which those requirements would apply.\n\n       Meanwhile, on the other end of the spectrum, there were approximately a dozen\n\ncommenters who urged the Commission to keep the disclosure requirements intact.                See\n\nComments of S.B. Hornik, AR 167; Comments of Professors Richard L. Hasen of School of\n\nLaw: Loyola University Chicago and Professor Richard Briffault of Columbia Law School, AR\n\n\n9       In light of the language in Citizens United and McConnell, the Court is not persuaded that\nthere is much force to the constitutional objections raised to reporting requirements as opposed to\nthe funding prohibitions.

This means the Commission\n               has guidance from the Court only to amend 11 CFR Part 114.\n\n\n10      The comments made by Alliance for Justice as well as those submitted by American\nFederation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, American Federation of State,\nCounty, and Municipal Employees, National Education Association, and Service Employees\nInternational Union also contained an alternative position on what the agency should do in the\nwake of WRTL II if the Commission should ultimately decide that the disclosure rules should be\nchanged. See Comments of Alliance for Justice, AR 444; Comments for American Federation of\nLabor and Congress of Industrial Organizations, et al., AR 457.\n                                              24\n\fComments of Center for Competitive Politics, AR 339.\n\n       Similarly, Common Cause, Public Citizen, and U.S. PIRG admonished the Commission\n\nthat WRTL II did not open the door to altering that portion of the statute:\n\n               The Commission should retain the reporting and disclosure requirements\n               for electioneering communications that are express advocacy for a number\n               of compelling reasons. First, the plaintiffs in both WRTL and the other\n               major as-applied challenge to BCRA Section 203’s funding prohibition\n               (Christian Civic League of Maine v. FEC) never contested BCRA’s\n               reporting and disclosure requirements for electioneering communications.\n               Indeed, they repeatedly told the courts that they were ready and willing to\n               comply with the disclosure rules if permitted to fund the ads they wished\n               to run.\n\n               Second, neither the controlling opinion nor concurring opinions in WRTL\n               mentioned the reporting and disclosure requirements of BCRA Section\n               201. They certainly did not call into question the legality of the\n               provisions. The FEC would therefore be entering uncharted waters.\n\nComments of Common Cause, et al., AR 351 (footnote omitted). That view was seconded by\n\nthe Congressional sponsors of Title II of the BCRA, Senator John McCain, Senator Russell D.\n\nFeingold, Senator Olympia Snowe, and Representative Christopher Shays, who insisted that the\n\nSupreme Court’s holding finding some funding restrictions to be unconstitutional did not extend\n\nto the reporting requirements:\n\n               The reporting requirements were not at issue in [WRTL II]. The Court did\n               not analyze their constitutionality, and if it had, an entirely different legal\n               framework would have been implicated. The Commission should not\n               undertake such an analysis on its own, especially since the Court in\n               McConnell upheld the reporting requirement against a facial challenge. . . .\n\n               One of the main purposes of Title II of BCRA was to make sure that the\n               public was informed of the identity of persons making expenditures on\n               electioneering communications. The legislative history of BCRA and the\n               record in McConnell are replete with examples of ads run by organizations\n               with benign sounding names and of unknown origin. The reporting\n               requirements of Section 201 were a significant reform in and of\n               themselves, completely independent of the prohibition contained in\n               Section 203. Those disclosure provisions apply not only to corporations\n\n                                                 25\n\f               and unions but to individuals and unincorporated associations who fund\n               electioneering communications. And the severability clause in section 401\n               of BCRA was meant to underscore congressional intent that even if\n               Section 203 were declared unconstitutional, other sections of the bill,\n               including Section 201, should survive. The Commission should not now\n               effectively throw out Section 201 based on an as-applied challenge to\n               Section 203 that specifically and explicitly disclaimed any challenge to\n               Section 201.\n\nComments of Senator McCain, et al., AR 371.\n\n       Other commenters underscored the salutary purposes of disclosure and took the position\n\nthat reporting requirements are much less burdensome than restrictions on expenditures. See\n\nComments of Public Campaign, AR 390–91 (“Disclosure enhances transparency and can provide\n\ncitizens with the information to determine how to vote or respond to calls for grassroots\n\nlobbying. . . . I urge the Commission to retain the extant disclosure requirements for all ads that\n\nmeet the definition of ‘electioneering communication.’”).\n\n       After the written comments were submitted, there was a hearing to consider the NPRM.\n\nThe hearing to consider the NPRM was held on October 17 and 18, 2007, and it consisted of a\n\nseries of panels. The witnesses and the Commissioners considered many issues other than the\n\npossible narrowing of the disclosure rules, and those discussions that do not bear on the issue\n\npresented in this case are not summarized here.\n\n        The first panel included James Bopp, who represented Wisconsin Right to Life in WRTL\n\nII, on behalf of the organization that filed the petition for rulemaking: The James Madison\n\nCenter for Free Speech.     He was joined by Marc Elias of Perkins Coie, representing the\n\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and former FEC staff member and George Mason\n\nLaw School faculty member, Allison Hayward. AR 503–632. While there was some discussion\n\nof disclosure issues during this panel, the bulk of the discussion was directed towards other\n\nissues, such as which of a series of sample ads should be considered to be the “functional\n\n                                                  26\n\fequivalent” of express advocacy, and whether the proposed rules would have the effect of\n\nregulating grassroots lobbying.      It is true that Professor Hayward commented that if a\n\ncorporation or labor union did not utilize a segregated account, the regulatory reporting\n\nrequirements would require it to “open up [its] books,” which could impose a “real burden.” AR\n\n517. But she did not offer further specifics or quantification. When prompted to make a\n\nprediction, Professor Hayward stated that she anticipated that the Supreme Court might find\n\ndisclosure requirements for WRTL II communications to be unconstitutional if presented with the\n\nright case, AR 592–93, but her central point was that WRTL II dealt only with the ban on\n\ncorporate spending, and not disclosure, and therefore, the Commission should not tread into that\n\narea at all. AR 517–18.\n\n       Elias similarly “implored” the Commission to do what was necessary under WRTL II and\n\nno more; “you are not faced with questions about disclosure.” AR 511; 537.             Elias also\n\ncautioned against attempting to predict how the Supreme Court would treat the disclosure of\n\nWRTL II communications. AR 594.\n\n       Hayward’s general comments about the burdens of disclosure included her observation\n\nthat the “contributors” to be disclosed under the statute would not include an organization’s\n\ncommercial customers, those who pay for its services, or members who pay membership dues.\n\nAR 611. Elias agreed. AR 612; 616 (“Are there ‘contributors’ to Ford?”). So this panel did not\n\nsupply evidence that compliance would be difficult for commercial enterprises or labor unions\n\nthat did not elect to establish the segregated bank account.\n\n       At least one of the Commissioners did express concerns about how the rule would affect\n\nnon-profit organizations since they are not generally required to identify their contributors, and\n\nthe delineation between dues and “donations” paid to them might be unclear. AR 616–19. But\n\n\n\n                                                27\n\fmuch of the record consists of the Commissioners themselves thinking out loud about those\n\nissues – there was little data placed before them. And there was no testimony offered that\n\nsuggested that the availability of the segregated bank account option would not alleviate any\n\nburdens or privacy concerns associated with imposing the disclosure requirements on a non-\n\nprofit or any other organization.\n\n       Finally, as the Commission wrestled with the larger question of how it should administer\n\nthe statutory disclosure requirements in the case of organizations that Congress did not anticipate\n\nwould be funding electioneering communications in the first place, Elias urged the Commission\n\nto be guided by the approach that the BCRA is “a disclosure statute.” AR 599. He cautioned the\n\nCommission to address only section 203 issues, not issues related to section 201 disclosures. AR\n\n599–600. Even James Bopp, who was the most vocal member of the panel on behalf of\n\ngrassroots advocacy organizations and who warned against adopting an approach that would\n\nchill their lobbying and issue advocacy, conceded that no change to the disclosure requirements\n\nwas required by the WRTL II decision. AR 626. Instead, Bopp’s position was limited to\n\nadvocating for Alternative 2, which would exclude WRTL II communications from the definition\n\nof electioneering communications all together. AR 601–04.\n\n       The second panel on October 17, 2007 included Jan Baran, representing the Chamber of\n\nCommerce; Larry Gold on behalf of the AFL-CIO; and Don Simon for Democracy 21, a non-\n\nprofit campaign finance reform organization. AR 632–720. Much of the discussion covered\n\nother issues, such as what the definitions of express advocacy and electioneering\n\ncommunications should be, and how to provide clear guidance about what would be permissible\n\nafter WRTL II. See, e.g., AR 665–720. With respect to any changes to the disclosure provisions,\n\nBaran simply urged the FEC to create a safe harbor for the funding of issue ads that would be\n\n\n\n                                                28\n\fsure to include all permissible speech, which would in turn have the effect of also eliminating\n\nreporting requirements for permissible speech and grassroots lobbying. AR 636–39.\n\n       Gold emphasized that the line of prohibition in the statute defined the line of disclosure,\n\nand he pressed for an approach along the lines of Alternative 2 that would narrowly define\n\n“electioneering communication” rather than a new regulation addressing the prohibition or the\n\nrelated disclosure rules directly. AR 641. In the event the agency took a different approach,\n\nGold observed that the Commission was faced with a situation that had not been contemplated\n\nby Congress:    “unions and corporations would never be in a position to have to report\n\nelectioneering communications because they were simply banned from doing so.” Id. Gold also\n\ntestified that the words “contribute” or “donate” connote a voluntary transfer without\n\nconsideration, so under the terms of the statute, “such income [as] receipts, dues, investment\n\nincome, damages awards and other commercial income and the like ought not to be subject to\n\ndisclosure.” AR 645. He explained that taking a broader approach would impose “a tremendous\n\nburden on unions in particular. The obligation to report income at the $1,000 level would be\n\nremarkable in comparison to a regulatory requirement . . . which requires unions to disclose all\n\nreceipts at the $5,000 threshold.” AR 646 (referring to the $5,000 threshold for disclosure under\n\nthe long-standing Labor Management Report and Disclosure Act).\n\n        Simon urged the FEC to leave the disclosure requirement for electioneering\n\ncommunications untouched.\n\n               The [WRTL II] court said nothing about disclosure and the analysis used to\n               evaluate the “as applied” constitutionality of Section 203 cannot logically\n               be extended to invalidate the disclosure required by Section 201. The\n               standard of review is different. Strict scrutiny versus intermediate\n               scrutiny. The nature of the burden is different – a ban on spending versus\n               a disclosure of spending that, as the court previously said, “does not\n               prevent anyone from speaking.” . . . Yet, notwithstanding these\n               differences on every level of the analysis and notwithstanding the court’s\n\n                                               29\n\f               own silence on the matter in [WRTL II], and notwithstanding the court’s\n               eight to one majority ruling in McConnell that the disclosure provision is\n               facially constitutional, you are being asked to make a determination that\n               Section 201 is unconstitutional. Surely the fact that Justices Scalia and\n               Kennedy, as well as Chief Justice Rehnquist in McConnell, agreed that\n               Section 201 was constitutional while at the same time voting to strike\n               down Section 203, indicates that they think the analysis of the two\n               provisions is completely different and there is nothing in [WRTL II] that\n               indicates that they or any other member of the court has changed their\n               mind on this question.\n\nAR 649–651. Simon was asked whether the FEC could choose its first alternative and adopt\n\nlanguage that would exempt business income and membership dues from disclosure. AR 654–\n\n55.   He opined that the agency could exempt business income, and he expressed some\n\nuncertainty about whether the agency could address union dues or whether that required a\n\nlegislative fix. He acknowledged that membership dues paid to non-profit organizations might\n\nraise a different set of questions, but he warned against doing anything that would undermine the\n\nreporting requirements, and he directed the agency’s attention back to McConnell, where the\n\nSupreme Court had talked about the importance of donor disclosure in an era of advertisements\n\nsponsored by vague “false fronts.” AR 656–57. And he emphasized that Congress had already\n\naddressed the burdens that might arise out of the disclosure obligation by building in the $1000\n\nreporting amount and creating the option of a segregated bank account. AR 657–58.\n\n       The Commissioners turned back to the union representative to ask if there were some\n\nway to exempt membership dues while still exposing those hiding behind vague monikers. The\n\nwitness did not express a need for further regulation in the union context since he opined that\n\ndues would fall outside of the disclosure provisions as they were already written. “[T]he main\n\npoint is that the statute talks in terms of ‘contributing contributions’ and you have interpreted it\n\nto mean ‘donating donations.’ Union dues are neither. Plainly they are neither.” AR 659–60.\n\n\n\n\n                                                30\n\fBut Gold did caution that an organization should not be required to reveal its members simply\n\nbecause it had engaged in a single electioneering communication:\n\n              It seems to me that if somebody gives funds at the dues level – pays dues –\n              that is not a donation, that is not money contributed. If that individual\n              voluntarily gives more, that is truly a donative act and then you are\n              beginning to count perhaps towards the $1,000. But you do clearly have\n              the authority to make these distinctions and you ought to do so. And the\n              availability of the option that you’re suggesting in one of the alternatives –\n              a separate fund, even a union or corporation having a segregated fund, and\n              just dealing with that – that doesn’t really address this issue completely.\n\nAR 660–61.\n\n       The Chairman of the Commission observed that when WRTL II identified a new group of\n\ncommunications that could not be prohibited, it necessarily drew a broader group of entities into\n\nthe regulatory regime, and then the panel went on to discuss with how it should define the class\n\nof communications that were protected. AR 665–721.\n\n       The third panel on October 17, 2007 consisted of Jessica Robinson of the American\n\nFederation of State, County, and Municipal Employees and Paul Ryan from the Campaign Legal\n\nCenter. AR 721–790. Robinson’s remarks were directed to the need for a broad, clearly\n\ndelineated safe harbor for permissible issue advocacy. She recommended that the Commission\n\nadopt Alternative 2, which would limit disclosure obligations by limiting the set of\n\ncommunications to which they would pertain. AR 721–26. She did say, though, that if the\n\nagency adopted Alternative 1, instead, it should simplify the disclosure requirements. She feared\n\nthat the regulatory requirement to disclose “donations” could be applied to dues and therefore\n\ndifficult to enforce and she concluded, “[t]he easiest way to address these issues is to require\n\nreporting only for those people who earmark funds to be used for WRTL II type communications\n\nand other funds should be reported just as a donation of the labor union.” AR 727.\n\n\n\n\n                                               31\n\f       Ryan pointed out that while there were several commenters who proposed exempting\n\nWRTL II ads from the BCRA disclosure requirements, there was a large group of commenters,\n\nwho came from groups with varying perspectives on campaign finance disclosure, who would all\n\nagree “that the plaintiff in WRTL did not challenge the disclosure requirements, the WRTL court\n\ndid not address the constitutionality of the disclosure requirements, and the McConnell court by a\n\nlarge majority specifically upheld the constitutionality of these disclosure requirements.” AR\n\n730–31. For those reasons, and because there are different constitutional tests to be applied to\n\nfunding restrictions and disclosure rules, there are broader governmental interests served by\n\ndisclosure, and the burdens imposed by disclosure are less than those imposed by restrictions on\n\nexpenditures, he urged the agency not to utilize the rulemaking to alter the BCRA disclosure\n\nrequirements. AR 729–32.\n\n       The panel then talked a great deal about the scope of any safe harbor and where the\n\nSupreme Court had drawn the line on permissible expenditures for issue ads, before it turned\n\nagain to the disclosure issue. One Commissioner asked whether there would be any union\n\nmembers whose dues would exceed $1,000 per year, and the answer was yes, although no\n\nnumbers were provided. AR 766–67. The Commissioner also posed questions about how to\n\nexempt legitimate dues from disclosure requirements without creating a loophole whereby an\n\nanonymous advocacy organization could simply structure itself to charge exorbitant “dues” and\n\nthereby shield the names of a limited set of individual donors. Robinson responded, “I suppose\n\none thing you would look at is donative intent . . . . Union dues, they are not donations because\n\nthey are required for union membership. So one of the ways you would look at it is you would\n\nlook at the intent of the members of [the group]. Are they doing it so the organization can pay\n\nfor electioneering communications?” AR 768–69. The specter of probing a contributor’s intent\n\n\n\n                                               32\n\fprompted this comment by the Vice Chairman: “It’s one of those things that we would have to\n\nget into discovery for and that would be a bad thing.” AR 769. Robinson agreed, id., and the\n\npanel resumed its discussion about the content of WRTL II ads.\n\n       On October 18, 2007, the Commission heard from Brian Svoboda on behalf of the\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee, Jeremiah Morgan of William J. Olson, P.C.,\n\nrepresenting the Free Speech Coalition and Free Speech Defense and Education Fund, and\n\nMichael Trister for the Alliance for Justice. AR 797–899. Morgan took a strong stance against\n\nimposing disclosure requirements on entities sponsoring issue ads, and he argued that neither of\n\nthe alternatives in the Notice would comport with the First Amendment. AR 798–805. Svoboda\n\nencouraged the Commission to proceed narrowly and to do little more than what WRTL II\n\nrequired, particularly in the disclosure arena, which was not addressed in the opinion at all and\n\nmight require a different legal standard and method of legal review. AR 805–09. He maintained\n\nthat this approach would reflect “fidelity to what it was that Congress passed,” AR 806, but in\n\nhis remarks, Trister countered that the existing reporting requirements were not written for\n\ncorporations or labor unions, so it would be impossible for the Commission to divine how\n\nCongress would have decided the question. Under those circumstances, he counseled the agency\n\nto adopt Alternative 2, excluding WRTL II communications from the definition of electioneering\n\ncommunications, and to leave the question of what reporting requirements should apply to the\n\nfunding of this new particular category of speech up to the legislature. AR 812–16.\n\n       After the panelists discussed the safe harbor issue in depth, a Commissioner asked:\n\n              The comment that was most persuasive to me on this point was the one the\n              labor unions filed, because it seems to me you would not even get very\n              useful information out of making a labor union disclose the names of all of\n              its members, anybody who has paid dues in the last year . . . . Now is\n              there some way that we could preserve the disclosure piece of it, because I\n              think it’s still on the books and we kind of have an obligation to do that,\n\n                                               33\n\f              and yet, define donation perhaps in some way to exclude union dues . . .\n              and yet not open the door to . . . those sort of organizations that are always\n              described as shady or shadowy because we do not know who the donors\n              are behind them? That’s the sort of disclosure that I think Congress\n              actually has historically been concerned about. Is there some way to catch\n              one and not the other?\n\nAR 833–34.\n\n       Svoboda posited that Congress provided for the segregated account as one possible\n\noption for organizations that wanted to limit disclosure by disclosing only those who donated to\n\nthe segregated account. AR 834–37. Trister suggested that the agency could call for the\n\ninformation that 501(c) organizations are already required to supply to the IRS.               But he\n\nexpressed the view that there should be a distinction between a general support grant, which an\n\norganization can use for any purpose, and an earmarked or special project grant, and he noted\n\nthat general support grants, even if reportable to the IRS, should not be included within the FEC\n\ndefinition of donation. “If they gave it whenever they gave it and said, ‘Here’s $1,000 and I\n\nwant you to run an ad,’ then they ought to report that. But if they give them $1,000 and say,\n\n‘here’s $1,000. I like your organization. Keep up the good work,’ which is essentially a general\n\nsupport grant, then it is unfair and it [is] misleading to the public to suggest that person was\n\nconnected to the ad in some way, that they paid for the ad.” AR 839–40. Trister also noted that\n\nCongress had distinguished between earmarked and non-earmarked funds in other reporting\n\ncontexts. AR 840.\n\n        Svoboda generally agreed with Trister as to unions, but he thought that an intent-based\n\ndistinction would be problematic in the case of those non-profit organizations created for the\n\nprimary purpose of running electioneering communications. He cautioned that such an approach\n\nwould create an enormous hole in the statutory requirement, leaving both the public, and a\n\ncandidate who might wish to respond to an attack, in the dark about who had sponsored an\n\n\n                                               34\n\fadvertisement at a critical time close to an actual election. AR 842–44. In response to a question\n\nby a Commissioner concerned about potential threats to those who might criticize an incumbent\n\nofficeholder, Svoboda further explained that the identity of the speaker, and not simply the\n\ncontent of the speech, could play an important role in determining the nature of the response.\n\nAR 850–52. Trister took the position that Svoboda’s concerns were overstated, because such\n\norganizations would likely be required to disclose under the regulations for registered political\n\ncommittees anyway. AR 845.\n\n       The panel was then occupied by an extended legal discussion on the question of whether\n\nthe justifications for campaign finance regulation set forth in the Supreme Court’s opinion in\n\nBuckley v. Valeo would apply to WRTL II ads and what Chief Justice Roberts meant on page\n\n2672 of the WRTL II opinion when he questioned whether issue ads that are not the functional\n\nequivalent of express advocacy raise the sort of corruption concern identified in Buckley as\n\nreason for campaign finance regulation. And Commissioner von Sakovsky asked, if WRTL II\n\nads were not electoral activities, how did the FEC have any authority to call for disclosure of\n\ntheir sponsors at all? AR 853–56. Since the positions expressed by both the Commissioners and\n\nthe witnesses during this and similar portions of the hearing were legal conclusions, they shed\n\nlight on the agency’s thought processes and decision making but in the end, they do not provide\n\n“evidence” against which the decision can be tested.\n\n       The final panel consisted of Stephen Hoersting of the Center for Competitive Politics;\n\nJohn Sullivan of the Service Employees International Union; Heidi Abegg, on behalf of the\n\nAmerican Taxpayers Alliance and Americans for Limited Government, and Michael Boos of\n\nCitizens United. AR 900; 902. Abegg urged the Commissioners to think about those 501(c)(4)\n\norganizations that may express unpopular opinions and generate strong adverse reactions from\n\n\n\n                                               35\n\fboth the government and the public. She took the position that disclosure requirements would\n\nraise privacy concerns and pose a risk of harassment and reprisals. She spoke of a longstanding\n\ntradition of anonymous public speech, and said that there would be no compelling governmental\n\ninterest that would support disclosure regulations in the case of communications that are not\n\nexpress advocacy or its functional equivalent.       Ultimately, Abegg urged the adoption of\n\nAlternative 2, which would have the effect of eliminating disclosure requirements for WRTL II\n\ncommunications. AR 902–08.\n\n       Boos of Citizens United also noted that Alternative 1 did not solve the problems related\n\nto those communications because it would leave the “burdensome” disclosure scheme that\n\napplies to electioneering communications intact. But Boos failed to elaborate on how disclosure\n\nwas burdensome. AR 910. He took the position that the FEC should adopt Alternative 2 instead\n\nsince it would exempt the ads in question – not only the WRTL II grassroots ads, but also\n\nCitizens United’s advertisements promoting the books and documentary films it produces – from\n\nthe regulatory scheme altogether. Finally, he called for a broader safe harbor in Alternative 2.\n\nAR 908–14.\n\n       Stephen Hoersting agreed with the notion that “it would be absurd to have organizations\n\nCongress never intended to run ECs all of a sudden have to start reporting their electioneering\n\ncommunications,” but he cautioned: “it would be untenable for the Commission to invoke its\n\nadministrative authority to stay application of Section 201, a facially valid provision, without\n\nsome organization asserting the application of 201 violates the rights of speech and association.\n\nIt would be unseemly for that question to be litigated in the posture of an agency defending its\n\nadministrative prerogatives . . . with no factual background of a speaker who is actually chilled.”\n\nAR 915. See also AR 927–28. He concluded: “The Commission should therefore hold its nose\n\n\n\n                                                36\n\fand apply Section 201 to issue advocates . . . . The word ‘contributes’ . . . should guide the\n\nCommission in crafting disclosure requirements even if disclosure comes down harder on\n\nnonprofit organizations whose ads are funded by contributors than it would for for-profit\n\ncorporations.” AR 916. 11 Finally, Hoersting underscored the importance of the need for a clear,\n\nnarrow definition of express advocacy. AR 917–19.\n\n       The union witness explained that the SEIU, AFL, NEA, and AFSCME were all very\n\nactive in the area of issue advocacy, spending considerable resources on federal and state\n\nlegislative activities and spending “a tremendous amount of our members’ voluntary\n\ncontributions on political activities.” AR 920. He argued that WRTL II required the agency to\n\nrevise its regulations concerning the definition of electioneering communications since the\n\nSupreme Court had redefined the boundaries of the Commission’s authority, and he emphasized\n\nthe important distinction between donations and dues.\n\n              Members pay dues to unions not to finance electioneering\n              communications, but to finance and support the full range of activities that\n              the union engages in, from collective bargaining representation, to\n              servicing members, to engaging in advocacy both with their employers\n              and with state and local officials around the country. And it would be, if\n              not counterproductive, at least serving no particular purpose to report or\n              disclose the names of people who did in fact not contribute to the\n              financing of a particular electioneering communication.\n\nAR 923–24.\n\n       There was then considerable discussion by the panel about the extent of the safe harbor\n\nprovisions in the regulations under consideration and the manner in which the agency could and\n\nshould implement the WRTL II imperative to define the functional equivalent of express\n\nadvocacy. AR 925–65. In response to a question from one of the Commissioners returning to\n\n\n11     Later, Abegg disagreed. AR 952–53 (“I am for ‘the tie goes to the speaker’ and not\nrequire another nonprofit to spend a lot of money bringing another lawsuit to challenge the\ndisclosure provisions.”).\n                                              37\n\fthe disclosure issue, Stephen Hoersting suggested that the Commission could probably draw an\n\ninference from Congress’s rejection of amendments to the Honest Leadership Open Government\n\nAct that would have required the disclosure of donors to grassroots lobbying organizations that\n\nCongress did not intend that the FECA disclosure rules would apply to grassroots issue\n\nadvertisements. AR 964–65. Boos, from Citizens United, stressed the fact that if the agency\n\nwere to define electioneering communication to exempt certain ads, then those ads would be free\n\nof any the disclosure and reporting requirements as well. AR 967.\n\n       At the close of the hearing, the Vice Chairman asked Abegg to provide more information\n\nin support of her claim that disclosure could pose some threat to potential donors. AR 968. The\n\nwitness reiterated that disclosure requirements might chill political speech, but she presented the\n\nCommission with no specifics:\n\n               I have particular examples, but I can’t share them. Some of them are\n               businessmen who are active in one political party but there is an issue that\n               is important to them so they want [to] give to effect change on that issue\n               and they are afraid if they do so they will face harassment or reprisals\n               from those in the other organizations with which they were associated.\n\nAR 969–70. Abegg went on:\n\n               Some of them just don’t want their names known. They don’t want any\n               attention. They just want to do it anonymously and go about their way.\n\nAR 970. She maintained that “[i]t is a very real concern” that could stop the flow of donations,\n\nand Hoersting echoed that sentiment. He indicated that he had been involved in conversations\n\nwhere “people stopped their activities because they heard about this disclosure aspect,” but his\n\ntestimony on that point was similarly vague. AR 971.\n\n               Chairman Lenard: Could you just elaborate on exactly concretely what\n               their concern is?\n\n\n\n\n                                                38\n\f               Mr. Hoersting: Yes. Well, I am not sure that I could, actually. I just\n               know when they heard disclosure they were not longer interested in\n               pursuing that issue that had a nexus to candidates.\n\nAR 971. Sullivan from SEIU reminded the Commission of the need to protect the names of\n\nunion members from potential reprisals in the workplace. AR 973–74. And then finally, with\n\nrespect to the disclosure issue, the Citizens United witness raised the question of the\n\norganization’s sales revenue and asked how, if the agency adopted Alternative 1, one would\n\ndifferentiate between such revenue and reportable “contributions” that would be used to fund\n\nadvertisements. AR 974–75. At that point, the second day of hearings came to an end.\n\n       A month later, on November 16, 2007, the General Counsel to the Commission\n\ntransmitted a Memorandum to the Commission which set forth two proposed draft final rules for\n\nthe implementation of a WRTL II exemption.           AR 1001–12.     Draft A simply created an\n\nexemption from the definition of “electioneering communication.” AR 1002–04. But Draft B\n\nincluded changes to the electioneering communications reporting requirements in 11 CFR\n\n§104.20, adding the language at issue in this case. AR 1006. The agency received only one\n\nletter responding to the change in the reporting requirements, and in it, J. Gerald Hebert and Paul\n\nS. Ryan of the Campaign Legal Center expressed their strong objection. AR 1024–26 (“We\n\nbelieve it would be a mistake of historic proportions for the Commission to go beyond the text of\n\nthe controlling opinion in WRTL.”). 12 The final rule was approved by the Commission on\n\nNovember 20, 2007.\n\n       Based upon this review of the entire record and the hearing transcript, the Court cannot\n\nconclude that the FEC “examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation\n\n\n12      The Commission also received a letter strongly objecting to proposed language in the\ndraft Explanation and Justification which would have differentiated between for-profit\ncorporations and qualified non-profit corporations when applying the new limitation to the\nreporting requirements. AR 1127–28. This language did not appear in the final rule.\n                                                39\n\ffor its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”\n\nSee State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106496\"><a href=\"/opinion/106496/burlington-truck-lines-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n168 (1962). It is hard to put one’s finger upon any data that prompted the particular rule in\n\nquestion, or the specific material in the transcript that supports the agency’s statement in the\n\nExplanation and Justification that “witnesses at the Commission’s hearing testified that the effort\n\nnecessary to identify those persons who provided funds totaling $1,000 or more to a corporation\n\nor labor organization would be very costly and require an inordinate amount of effort.” 72 Fed.\n\nReg. at 72911. There was no testimony about how many organizations now covered by the\n\nregulatory regime would be affected by the burdens involved with compliance, what those\n\nburdens would actually entail, and what the costs would be.\n\n       The witnesses appeared to generally agree that neither the statute nor the existing\n\nregulations defining “contributors” as “donors” would call for the disclosure of the names of a\n\nfor-profit corporation’s commercial customers and investors, or names of all labor union\n\nmembers, since none of those individuals could fairly be characterized as “donors.” Thus, the\n\nconcerns that were expressed related largely to non-profit advocacy groups. In the Explanation\n\nand Justification that accompanied the final rule, the agency stated that a non-profit corporation’s\n\ncoffers would include “donations from persons who support the corporation’s mission,” but that\n\nthose “donors do not necessarily support the corporation’s electioneering communications.” 72\n\nFed. Reg. at 72911. But no testimony indicated how many non-profit organizations, if any,\n\ncollected contributions or dues or that would exceed the $1000 statutory threshold, how many\n\nindividuals made donations or paid dues in those amounts, or how difficult it would be to keep\n\ntrack of them. No evidence was adduced that would suggest that individuals contributing more\n\nthan $1000 to a non-profit would be likely to disagree with the messages to be conveyed by that\n\n\n\n                                                40\n\forganization in its electioneering communications. And nothing explained why the segregated\n\nbank account was not a suitable solution for any of the problems that were identified. So the\n\nCourt cannot find the regulation to be reasonable under the State Farm formulation.\n\n   IV.      The regulation contravenes the language and the purpose of the statute.\n\n         It is true that at the second step of the Chevron analysis, the reviewing court is required to\n\naccord appropriate weight to an agency’s interpretation of a statutory scheme that falls within its\n\nbailiwick. 467 U.S. at 844. But an agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous statutory provision\n\nmust still be reasonable “in light of the language, legislative history, and policies of the statute.”\n\nShays v.

In light\n\nof those precedents, the FEC’s decision to take it upon itself to “limit” the statutory disclosure\n\nrequirements cannot be sustained, and for those reasons, in addition to those set forth above, the\n\nCourt does not find section 104.20(c)(9) to be a reasonable interpretation of the BCRA.\n\n         First, looking at the language of the statute, section 30104(f)(1) imposes its disclosure\n\nrequirements on “[e]very person who makes a disbursement for the direct costs of producing and\n\nairing electioneering communications in an aggregate amount in excess of $10,000 during any\n\ncalendar year.” 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(1). The BCRA defines “person” to include corporations\n\nand labor unions, 52 U.S.C. § 30101(11), and as the FEC acknowledged in its pleadings before\n\nthis Court, even before WRTL II, the disclosure rules applied to some corporations, in particular,\n\nthe non-profit corporations described in FEC v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n\n\n                                                  <span class=\"page\">41</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f238 (1986). See Def.’s Mem. [Dkt. # 24] at 6. And section 30104(f)(2) requires disclosure of\n\n“the names and addresses of all contributors who contributed an aggregate amount of $1,000 or\n\nmore,” 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2)(E)–(F) (emphasis added), with no limitation other than the\n\nthreshold amount.\n\n       It is true that the Court of Appeals has already stated that the words “contributors” and\n\n“contributed” can, on their face, be construed to include a purpose requirement.        Ctr. for\n\nIndividual Freedom v. Van Hollen, 694 F.3d at 111. But an interpretation that narrows the\n\napplication of the reporting provision would be inconsistent with the policies underlying the\n\nstatute. There can be no dispute that the concept of disclosure and transparency is fundamental\n\nto the BCRA. As the Court set out in some detail in its prior opinion, the legislative history of\n\nthe BCRA makes it clear that the purpose behind the disclosure requirements was to enable\n\nvoters to be informed about who was trying to influence their decisions. 147 Cong. Rec. S3022-\n\n05, S3034 (Mar. 28, 2001) (statement by Sen. Jeffords) (noting that Congress intended to\n\n“shine[] sunlight on the undisclosed expenditures for sham issue advertisements”); 147 Cong.\n\nRec. S3233-06, S3238 (April 2, 2001) (statement of Sen. Feinstein) (“The attacks come and no\n\none knows who is actually paying for them. I believe this is unethical. I believe it is unjust. I\n\nbelieve it is unreasonable and it must end.”). As the Supreme Court has explained, the disclosure\n\nprovisions were intended to prevent independent groups from running advertisements “‘while\n\nhiding behind dubious and misleading names’” so that “citizens [could] ‘make informed choices\n\nin the political marketplace.’” Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 367, quoting McConnell, 540 U.S. at\n\n197.\n\n       Therefore, it was contrary to the policy goal that Congress intended to implement for the\n\nCommission to add limiting language to its regulations when the aim of that language was – as\n\n\n\n                                               42\n\fthe FEC put it – “to ensure that disclosure of the newly-permitted electioneering communications\n\nwould be narrowly tailored . . . .” Def.’s Mem. at 10. Congress did not call for narrow tailoring;\n\nit called for just the opposite.\n\n        And the new rule serves to frustrate the aim of the statute because the introduction of a\n\nsubjective test to the reporting regime creates an exception that has the potential to swallow the\n\nrule entirely. A donor can avoid reporting altogether by transmitting funds but remaining silent\n\nabout their intended use.\n\n        Moreover, the decision to reduce disclosure and transparency was not justified or\n\nnecessitated by the reasons the agency identified when the final rule was promulgated. The\n\nCommission posited that the donative purpose limitation was needed because the general\n\ntreasury of a corporation or labor organization is likely to contain funds derived from individuals\n\nwho do not necessarily support the entity’s electioneering communications, and that therefore,\n\ndisclosing the identity of those payors would not advance the goals underlying the reporting\n\nrequirements. 72 Fed. Reg. at 72911. But the same rationale applies equally to partnerships,\n\nunincorporated entities, and any other “persons,” and Congress determined that they would all be\n\nbound by the disclosure requirements anyway. See also Citizens United, 558 U.S. at 351 (“All\n\nspeakers, including individuals and the media, use money amassed from the economic\n\nmarketplace to fund their speech.”). And, prior to WRTL II, the disclosure provisions already\n\napplied to some corporations – the MCFL organizations – which, like other non-profits, pursue a\n\nbroad range of educational and advocacy activities beyond the mere funding of electioneering\n\ncommunications. Furthermore, the agency’s statement that it would be too burdensome to\n\nrequire organizations to identify all “persons who provided funds,” see 72 Fed. Reg. at 72911, is\n\ninconsistent not only with the statute, but with the agency’s own regulations, because that is not\n\n\n\n                                                43\n\fwho had to be identified under the existing regime in the first place.            FEC regulations\n\nimplementing the BCRA reporting provisions require the disclosure of “the name and address of\n\neach donor who donated an amount aggregating $1,000 or more,” 11 CFR §104.20(c)(8)\n\n(emphasis added), not “persons who provided funds.” The Commission failed to articulate why\n\na for-profit corporation’s customers and investors, or a labor union’s members – all of whom\n\ntransfer funds in return for some consideration in the form of goods or services or an ownership\n\ninterest – would not be fully protected by the regulation’s limiting reporting requirements to\n\n“donors,” or why further elaboration on that term – rather than the interposition of an intent\n\nlimitation that could eviscerate the reporting rules – would not alleviate any lingering confusion.\n\nIn other words, the FEC had already clarified the ambiguous statutory term “contributors” in a\n\nmanner that largely cured the potential problems it identified.       And Congress had already\n\nprescribed a remedy for those organizations that found the identification of all individual donors\n\nto be too burdensome: the segregated bank account. See 52 U.S.C. § 30104(f)(2)(E). 13\n\n       Since nothing about the WRTL II decision altered the operation of those regulations, it\n\nwas unreasonable to add an intent requirement that limited disclosure obligations for the\n\nsupposed purpose of implementing the changes brought about by WRTL II.                 Indeed, the\n\nCommission explicitly acknowledged in the Explanation and Justification for the rule that WRTL\n\nII did not authorize it to eliminate the reporting requirements. See 72 Fed. Reg. at 72901 (“Thus,\n\nbecause McConnell has upheld the definition of ECs, as well as the reporting and disclaimer\n\nrequirements, as facially valid, and because WRTL II did not address these provisions, the\n\n\n\n\n13     The fact that these accounts may be used to receive contributions from individual donors\nonly does not make them an unsuitable vehicle for eliminating the burdens of organizational\ndisclosure; it was the cost and effort that might be involved in reporting individual donations that\nwas what troubled the agency.\n                                                44\n\fCommission has no mandate to revise the underlying definition of ‘electioneering\n\ncommunication’ or remove the reporting and disclaimer requirements.”)\n\n       Finally, the regulation cannot be supported on the grounds that the Commission fairly\n\nbalanced the need for disclosure against sensitive First Amendment and privacy concerns. See\n\nDef.’s Mem. at 33–36; CIF Supplemental Mem. [Dkt. # 93] at 5–7. This was not a justification\n\nadvanced in the Explanation and Justification, and more important, those arguments have been\n\nforeclosed by the Supreme Court. In Citizens United, the Court clearly found that the disclosure\n\nrequirements in the BCRA – even those that apply to ads that are not express advocacy or its\n\nfunctional equivalent – do not impinge upon constitutional rights, see Citizens United, 558 U.S.\n\nat 367–69.

Oct. 6, 2014); Def.’s Opp. at 7 (noting that in McConnell, the Supreme Court\n\n“upheld the electioneering communication disclosure requirements, noting that they did not\n\nsuppress speech and that important state interests support the requirements”). Moreover, the\n\nrecord evidence on the need to address privacy concerns was extremely thin; the fact that some\n\ncontributors “just don’t want their names known” does not provide grounds to override a clear\n\nCongressional choice in favor of transparency.
