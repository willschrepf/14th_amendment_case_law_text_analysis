VENEMAN\n                             OPINION\n\nW. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Plaintiffs, who include the Animal Legal Defense Fund\n(“ALDF”), the Animal Welfare Institute (“AWI”), and three\nindividuals, challenge the United States Department of Agri-\nculture’s (“USDA”) decision not to adopt a Draft Policy that\nwould have provided guidance to zoos, research facilities, and\nother regulated entities in how to ensure the psychological\nwell-being of nonhuman primates in order to comply with the\nfederal Animal Welfare Act (“AWA”). Plaintiffs challenge\nthe decision not to adopt the Draft Policy under the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act (“APA”) as arbitrary and capricious.\nThe district court did not reach the merits of plaintiffs’ suit\nbecause it determined that the USDA’s decision did not con-\nstitute reviewable final agency action. We disagree. We hold\nthat at least one of the plaintiffs has standing under Article III\nof the Constitution, and we conclude that the district court has\nauthority under the APA to review the USDA’s decision not\nto adopt the Draft Policy.\n\n                        I.   Background\n\n           A.    Statutory and Regulatory Backdrop\n\n   Congress enacted the AWA in 1966 “to insure that animals\nintended for use in research facilities or for exhibition pur-\nposes or for use as pets are provided humane care and treat-\nment . . . .” 7 U.S.C. § 2131(1). As originally enacted, the\nAWA left research facilities largely unregulated. See, e.g., 7\nU.S.C. § 2143(a) (repealed 1985). In 1985, Congress\namended the AWA by enacting the Improved Standards for\nLaboratory Animals Act, Pub. L. No. 99-198, 99 Stat. 1645.\nThis amendment to the AWA instructed the USDA to “pro-\nmulgate standards to govern the humane handling, care, treat-\nment, and transportation of animals by dealers, research\nfacilities, and exhibitors.” 7 U.S.C. § 2143(a)(1). These stan-\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN            18745\ndards must “include minimal requirements . . . for a physical\nenvironment adequate to promote the psychological well-\nbeing of primates.” Id. § 2143(a)(2)(B). The Secretary pro-\nposed a regulation containing these standards in 1989. See\nAnimal Welfare — Standards, 54 Fed. Reg. 10897, 10917\n(proposed Mar. 15, 1989).\n\n   The 1989 proposed regulation would have imposed a num-\nber of detailed “minimum requirements” on regulated entities.\nThese included, for example, a requirement that “nonhuman\nprimates must be housed in primary enclosures with compati-\nble members of the same species or with compatible members\nof other nonhuman primate species” unless doing so would\nendanger the animal. 54 Fed. Reg. at 10944. As finally\nadopted in 1991, however, the regulation, which requires reg-\nulated entities to create an “Environmental Enhancement\nPlan” to benefit nonhuman primates, left the requirements for\nthese “primary enclosures” more vaguely defined. See gener-\nally 56 Fed. Reg. 6426 (1991), codified at 9 C.F.R. § 3.81.\nThe social grouping provision of the regulation, for example,\ncontains no specific instruction regarding the pairing or\ngrouping of animals. It leaves regulated entities considerable\ndiscretion to house nonhuman primates as they see fit, pro-\nvided that housing conditions accord with “currently accepted\nprofessional standards, as cited in appropriate professional\njournals or reference guides, and as directed by the attending\nveterinarian.” 9 C.F.R. § 3.81(a).\n\n   In 1991, the ALDF challenged § 3.81 in the federal district\ncourt for the District of Columbia, arguing that the regulation\nviolated the AWA by failing to impose minimum standards\nfor nonhuman primate conditions of confinement. In a deci-\nsion later upheld by the D.C. Circuit, the district court con-\ncluded that at least one of the plaintiffs had standing to\nchallenge the regulation based on an aesthetic injury he suf-\nfered from witnessing the conditions of several nonhuman pri-\nmates’ confinement. This plaintiff had “ ‘been employed and/\nor worked as a volunteer for various human and animal relief\n\f18746           ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nand rescue organizations’ ” “[f]or his entire adult life.” Ani-\nmal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v. Glickman, 154 F.3d 426, 429\n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc) (“Glickman I”). This plaintiff had\nvisited a “game farm” covered by the statute at least nine\ntimes, and had seen primates “living under inhumane condi-\ntions” at the farm. Id. For example, he saw a large male chim-\npanzee held in an isolated area. He stated in an affidavit that\nhe knew that chimpanzees “ ‘are very social animals and it\nupset [him] very much to see’ ” this chimpanzee “ ‘in isola-\ntion from other primates.’ ” Id. (alteration in original).\n\n   The district court struck down § 3.81 as arbitrary and capri-\ncious and contrary to law. Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Sec. of\nAgric., 813 F. Supp. 882, 892 (D.D.C. 1993). Reversing this\ndecision in 2000, the D.C. Circuit concluded that “[n]othing\nin the [AWA’s] statutory mandate required greater specifici-\nty” than the allegedly vague requirements the regulation\nimposed. See Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v. Glickman, 204\nF.3d 229, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“Glickman II”).\n\n                       B.   The Draft Policy\n\n   While the challenge to § 3.81 was pending before the D.C.\nCircuit in what would become Glickman II, the USDA took\na survey of USDA inspectors responsible for § 3.81’s enforce-\nment. Based on this survey, it published a “Final Report on\nEnvironment Enhancement to Promote the Psychological\nWell-Being of Nonhuman Primates” (“Final Report”) on July\n15, 1999.1 The Final Report noted that “[a]lmost half the\nresponding employees felt that the criteria in the regulations\nwere not adequate for [regulated] facilities to understand how\nto meet them and for inspectors to judge if a facility was in\ncompliance.” Inspectors complained that § 3.81 provided\n“few solid criteria” to judge compliance, and a “common\nrefrain” among those surveyed was that “too many enhance-\nment programs consisted of only one or two types of enrich-\n  1\n   The Final Report is available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov.\n\f               ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                18747\nment . . . in an otherwise barren, stimulus-poor environment.”\nStressing the “urgency of these problems[,]” the Final Report\ninsisted that “[a] strategy had to be developed to fulfill the\noriginal intent and language of the Animal Welfare Act . . . .”\n\n   On the same day the Final Report was issued, the USDA\npublished — apparently as a response to the report — a\n“Draft Policy on Environment Enhancement for Nonhuman\nPrimates” in the Federal Register and opened a period for\npublic comment. 64 Fed. Reg. 38145 (July 15, 1999) (“Draft\nPolicy”). In the Draft Policy’s preface, the USDA explained\nwhy it had not included more detailed requirements in § 3.81\nfor the treatment of nonhuman primates. See id. at 38146\n(declaring that the USDA “intentionally made the regulations\nregarding promotion of psychological well-being flexible”\nbecause “the conditions appropriate for one species do not\nnecessarily apply to another”).\n\n    However, the preface continued, “after five years of experi-\nence enforcing § 3.81,” regulated entities “did not necessarily\nunderstand how to develop an environment enhancement plan\nthat would adequately promote the psychological well-being\nof nonhuman primates.” 64 Fed. Reg. at 38146. Hence, while\nthe USDA “continue[d] to believe that [§ 3.81’s] flexibility\n. . . is in the best interests of the animals[,]” it also “believe[d]\nthat additional information on how to meet the standards in\n§ 3.81 is necessary.” Id. This additional information would\nremedy the “considerable disagreement” and “confusion”\namong the public and regulated entities as to what § 3.81\nrequired, and it would give agency inspectors a workable set\nof enforcement criteria to apply. Id. In other words, the Draft\nPolicy would “clarify[ ] what actions [the USDA] consider[s]\nnecessary in order to comply with” § 3.81. Id.\n\n  The Draft Policy listed a number of specific features that a\nregulated entity could usefully include in an environmental\nenhancement plan. 64 Fed. Reg. at 38146. In particular, the\nDraft Policy provided for a safe harbor within which regu-\n\f18748         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nlated entities could be sure that they were in compliance with\nthe regulation and the AWA. It stated that if regulated entities\n“develop and follow environmental enhancement plans that\nare in accordance with the draft policy[,]” they would neces-\nsarily “meet the requirements of § 3.81 . . . .” Id. Regulated\nentities could adopt plans outside the safe harbor, however, so\nlong as the plans complied with the regulation and the AWA.\nId.\n\n                   C.   Procedural History\n\n   The Draft Policy remained just that — a draft — for several\nyears. In July 2003, plaintiffs, frustrated that the USDA had\nfailed to take any final action, sued the Secretary and other\nUSDA officials (collectively, the “USDA”) in federal district\ncourt for the Northern District of California. They contended\nthat the USDA had failed to promulgate standards to “pro-\nmote the psychological well-being of primates” in violation of\nthe AWA, 7 U.S.C. § 2143(a), and that its failure constituted\nagency action “unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed”\nin violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). Plaintiffs sought\na declaratory judgment that the USDA was violating the\nAWA and the APA, as well as an order requiring the USDA\nto make a final decision with respect to the Draft Policy\nwithin 30 days.\n\n   In response, the USDA filed a declaration from Dr. Chester\nGipson, the Deputy Administrator for Animal Care at the\nUSDA’s Animal Plant Health Inspection Service. Dr. Gipson\nstated that, in his official capacity as Deputy Administrator,\nhe had made an oral announcement at a December 2002 con-\nference of industry and animal protection groups that the\n“USDA was not going forward with the Draft Policy . . . .”\nDr. Gipson declared that he had repeated this oral announce-\nment at a similar March 2003 conference.\n\n  The National Association for Biomedical Research\n(“NABR”), a non-profit organization representing universities\n\f               ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN             18749\nand other entities subject to the AWA, intervened in the suit\nunder Rule 24(b). The USDA, joined by the NABR, then\nmoved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), contending, inter alia,\nthat Dr. Gipson’s announcements that the agency would not\ngo forward with the Draft Policy rendered the suit moot, and\nthat in any event plaintiffs lacked standing under Article III.\n\n   Plaintiffs then amended their complaint to add an alterna-\ntive claim, contending that Dr. Gipson’s oral statements con-\nstituted final agency action under 5 U.S.C. § 704. They\nalleged that this action was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse\nof discretion in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), in that it “fails\nto articulate a basis for the agency’s decision that the [Draft]\nPolicy is no longer ‘necessary’ to fulfill the agency’s obliga-\ntions under the AWA and also fails to address any of the evi-\ndence and public comment demonstrating that the policy is\nnecessary to fulfill that statutory mandate.”\n\n   The district court granted the USDA’s motion to dismiss\nthe amended complaint. It concluded that the agency had no\nfurther duty to act after the D.C. Circuit held in Glickman II\nthat § 3.81 adequately discharged the USDA’s obligation\nunder the AWA. Hence, in the view of the district court, the\nUSDA’s failure to finalize the Draft Policy did not constitute\nan “unreasonable delay” in violation of APA § 706(1). The\ndistrict court also rejected plaintiffs’ § 706(2) claim that the\nrefusal to go forward with the Draft Policy had been arbitrary\nand capricious. It held that Dr. Gipson’s oral announcements\ndid not constitute a “definitive policy statement,” and conse-\nquently were not a reviewable “agency action” within the\nmeaning of § 706(2).\n\n  On appeal to us, plaintiffs primarily argue that the decision\nnot to go forward with the Draft Policy was a final “agency\naction” under § 704, and that the district court erred by dis-\nmissing the challenge to Dr. Gipson’s statements as unreview-\nable under § 706(2). In the alternative, they contend that the\nUSDA’s failure finally to decide the Draft Policy’s fate is an\n\f18750           ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nunreasonable delay within the meaning of § 706(1). The\nUSDA and the NABR contend that plaintiffs lack Article III\nstanding and that, if they have standing, their arguments under\nthe APA fail. Because the question of plaintiffs’ Article III\nstanding goes to our subject matter jurisdiction, we address it\nfirst.\n\n                            II.   Standing\n\n   [1] The standing “inquiry involves both constitutional limi-\ntations on federal-court jurisdiction and prudential limitations\non its exercise.” Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 498 (1975).\nThe USDA and the NABR contend that plaintiffs’ standing\nfails on constitutional grounds.2 In order to satisfy Article III’s\nstanding requirements, a plaintiff must show:\n\n      (1) it has suffered an injury in fact that is (a) con-\n      crete and particularized and (b) actual and imminent,\n      not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is\n      fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defen-\n      dant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely specu-\n      lative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable\n      decision.\n\nFriends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs., Inc., 528\nU.S. 167, 180-81 (2000) (internal quotation omitted). At the\nmotion to dismiss stage, allegations are presumed to be cor-\nrect, and thus “general factual allegations of injury resulting\nfrom the defendant’s conduct may suffice” to establish the\nprerequisites for standing. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504\nU.S. 555, 561 (1992).\n\n  We hold that at least one plaintiff, Valerie Buchanan, has\n  2\n   The USDA also raises a perfunctory prudential standing challenge. The\nagency has waived this argument by not raising it below. Bd. of Natural\nRes. v. Brown, 992 F.2d 937, 946 (9th Cir. 1993) (prudential standing is\nnot jurisdictional and may be waived).\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN             18751\nstanding under Article III. Buchanan is a “long-time volunteer\nand advocate for primates” with experience working with\nchimpanzees all over the world. Buchanan states that, begin-\nning in 2000, she has formed a “particularly close emotional\nattachment” to Terry, a chimpanzee housed at the Southern\nNevada Zoological-Botanical Park. Buchanan visits Terry\n“every other month” and states that she “will continue to do\nso” in the future. Since 1995, Buchanan declares, Terry has\nbeen housed alone, with no contact with other nonhuman pri-\nmates. Terry is “listless” and engages in species-atypical\nbehavior. The only time Buchanan has seen Terry animated\nis when his former trainer visits. When the trainer leaves,\n“Terry climbs up in his cage and watches the trainer’s car\nuntil it exits the parking lot.” Based on her expertise,\nBuchanan believes that Terry’s psychological health is deteri-\norating. She expressed her concern about Terry to the USDA\nin 2001. The agency responded that, while it “would prefer\nthat he have the companionship of another chimpanzee,” the\nzoo was in compliance with the AWA and § 3.81.\n\n   Buchanan complains that Terry’s environment and species-\natypical behavior injure her interests in observing and enjoy-\ning chimpanzees. She states that, if the Draft Policy were\nfinalized, it “would improve the psychological well-being of\nprimates including Terry, thereby reducing the level of abnor-\nmal, stereotypic and/or injurious behaviors exhibited by Terry\nand other primates whom . . . Buchanan enjoys observing and\nstudying in humane conditions.” The USDA argues that\nBuchanan’s asserted injury does not satisfy Article III. For the\nreasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n                      A.   Injury-in-Fact\n\n   [2] “Harm to a plaintiff’s ‘aesthetic and environmental\nwell-being’ has long been recognized as a cognizable injury”\nfor the purposes of the injury-in-fact requirement. Fund for\nAnimals, Inc. v. Lujan, 962 F.2d 1391, 1396 (9th Cir. 1992)\n(quoting Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727, 734 (1972)).\n\f18752         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n“[T]he desire to use or observe an animal species, even for\npurely esthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest\nfor purpose of standing.” Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at\n562-63. The term “aesthetic” in ordinary usage refers to an\nartistic sense or a sense of beauty. Our Article III standing\njurisprudence gives the term “aesthetic injury” a broader\nmeaning that includes emotional injury. For example, in\nGlickman I, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiff — who had\nstated that the treatment of the chimpanzee had “upset” him\n“very much” — had suffered “aesthetic injury.” 154 F.3d at\n431, 433.\n\n   [3] Buchanan’s aesthetic injury is virtually indistinguish-\nable from the injury the D.C. Circuit found constitutionally\nsufficient in Glickman I. Like Buchanan, the Glickman I\nplaintiff asserted that he had suffered an “ ‘assault on [his]\nsenses’ ” and had been very upset when he viewed nonhuman\nprimates “living under inhumane conditions” during regular\nvisits to a particular zoo. 154 F.3d at 429-32. Like Buchanan,\nwhose many years of interest in chimpanzees underscore a\ndeep-seated concern for their health, the Glickman I plaintiff\nhad a long-term sustained interest in primate welfare, and had\npersonally visited and — more importantly — continued to\nvisit the animals whose condition caused him aesthetic injury.\nId. at 432. Hence, Buchanan, like the plaintiff in Glickman I,\nhas “alleged far more than an abstract, and uncognizable,\ninterest in seeing the law enforced.” Id.\n\n   The USDA urges us to disagree with the D.C. Circuit’s\nholding in Glickman I. It asks us to restrict Article III aes-\nthetic injury based on animal harm to situations where the\ndiminution or elimination of an animal species causes the\nalleged harm. This is precisely the argument made by the dis-\nsent in Glickman I. See 154 F.3d at 448 (Sentelle, J., dissent-\ning) (the “diminution-of-the-species” limit is necessary to\nkeep the “expanse of standing” from being “bounded only by\nwhat a given plaintiff finds to be aesthetically pleasing”).\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN            18753\n   The Glickman I majority expressly rejected this argument.\nSee 154 F.3d at 433 n.5. It is also inconsistent with our own\nprecedent. In Alaska Wildlife Alliance v. Jensen, 108 F.3d\n1065 (9th Cir. 1997), we held that a plaintiff who alleged that\nshe saw “ ‘sea lions in the bay with huge trolling lures hang-\ning from their mouths’ ” had standing based on aesthetic\ninjury to contest the Secretary of the Interior’s decision to\nallow commercial fishing in a national park. Id. at 1068. A\nplaintiff who “expressed concern over [fishing] vessels’ dis-\nplacement of whales from preferred feeding areas and\ndescribed how she now plans her visits to the Park to avoid\nthe fishermen’s presence” also satisfied the injury-in-fact\nrequirement. Id.; see also Ocean Advocates v. U.S. Army\nCorps of Eng’rs, 402 F.3d 846, 859-60 (9th Cir. 2005) (find-\ning standing based on risk of harm to the environment when\nthe alleged harm would, among other things, “markedly\ndecrease[ ]” the plaintiffs’ ability to “observe wildlife”).\n\n   [4] For purposes of injury-in-fact, a distinction between\nharm to individual animals, on the one hand, and harm to an\nanimal species through diminution or extinction, on the other,\nis illogical. The injury at issue is not the animals’ but the\nhuman observer’s. The government fails to explain — as it\nfailed to explain in Glickman I — why knowing of a species’\ndiminution or extinction causes a more acute and objectively\ndemonstrable injury to a human than observing harm to an\nindividual animal. See 154 F.3d at 438. Although we appreci-\nate that aesthetic injury standing is not boundless, we con-\nclude that harm to a nonhuman primate creates a cognizable\ninjury-in-fact for someone with Buchanan’s level of engage-\nment with and appreciation for nonhuman primates.\n\n                   B.   Causal Connection\n\n   The second prong of the test for Article III standing\nrequires Buchanan to show a causal connection between her\ninjury and the USDA’s refusal to finalize the Draft Policy. Put\ndifferently, her injury must be “fairly traceable” to the agen-\n\f18754         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\ncy’s failure to act. Pritikin v. Dep’t of Energy, 254 F.3d 791,\n797 (9th Cir. 2001). Injury that “results from the independent\naction of some third party not before the court” does not sat-\nisfy the causation requirement. Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights\nOrg., 426 U.S. 26, 42 (1976). But a “chain of causation [may\nhave] more than one link” and still satisfy Article III, so long\nas the connection between injury and cause is not “hypotheti-\ncal or tenuous.” Nat’l Audubon Soc’y, Inc. v. Davis, 307 F.3d\n835, 849 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n   [5] Terry’s suffering, caused by the conditions at the zoo\nwhere he is confined, gives rise to Buchanan’s injury. Obvi-\nous causal links connect Terry’s suffering (and thus Buchan-\nan’s injury) to the USDA’s failure to adopt the Draft Policy.\nThe Draft Policy addresses several of the problems at Terry’s\nzoo that, according to Buchanan, render him listless and\nunhappy. For example, Buchanan complains that Terry’s lack\nof companionship adversely affects his psychological health.\nThe Draft Policy declares that, “[i]n order to address the\nsocial needs of nonhuman primates under § 3.81(a), the [zoo’s\nenvironmental enhancement] plan must provide for each pri-\nmate of a species known to be social in nature to be housed\nwith other primates whenever possible.” 64 Fed. Reg. at\n38147 (emphasis added). Although the Draft Policy would\nhave given regulated entities leeway to meet this requirement\nin different ways, the mandatory language would have elimi-\nnated their discretion to house primates in isolation when pos-\nsible to do otherwise. By contrast, without the Draft Policy\nclarifying § 3.81’s requirements, the USDA could freely give\nTerry’s zoo a clean bill of health when Buchanan complained\nin 2001. Terry’s suffering — and thus Buchanan’s injury —\nare fairly traceable to the fact that his zoo can operate in ways\nthat the Draft Policy likely would have restricted or elimi-\nnated.\n\n                      C.   Redressability\n\n   The final requirement for Article III standing is that the\nrelief Buchanan seeks in this suit redress her injury. Causal\n\f                ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                   18755\nconnection and redressability are two sides of the same coin.\nThe former assesses the relationship between the defendant’s\nconduct and the alleged injury, while the latter asks whether\nand how the requested relief would help. Allen v. Wright, 468\nU.S. 737, 753 n.19 (1984). A plaintiff meets the redressability\ntest if it is “likely” — not certain — “that the injury will be\nredressed by a favorable decision.” Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 181;\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 561. Although “[a] purely\nspeculative favorable outcome will not suffice[,]” Rubin v.\nCity of Santa Monica, 308 F.3d 1008, 1020 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(internal quotation omitted), a “[p]laintiff[ ] need not demon-\nstrate that there is a ‘guarantee’ that [her] injuries will be\nredressed by a favorable decision.” Graham v. Fed. Emer-\ngency Mgmt. Agency, 149 F.3d 997, 1003 (9th Cir. 1998).\n\n   In the Draft Policy’s preface, the USDA declared that, for\neffective application and enforcement of § 3.81, additional\ninformation and instruction of the sort contained in the policy\nwas “necessary.” 64 Fed. Reg. at 38146. If Buchanan’s suit is\nsuccessful, and the USDA’s decision to abandon the Draft\nPolicy is set aside as arbitrary and capricious, the USDA\nwould either have to explain why the Draft Policy is no longer\n“necessary,” or would actually have to adopt it. If the agency\ncannot provide a satisfactory explanation and ultimately\nadopts the Draft Policy, the policy’s threat of penalty if its\nsafe harbor is ignored is likely to provide substantial incentive\nto comply with its terms.3\n\n   In some standing cases, a court has little more than com-\nmon sense to guide its determination whether the relief sought\nwill likely redress an injury. That is not so here. We are in the\nfortunate position of having an unambiguous statement by the\nregulated entities themselves that the relief Buchanan seeks\nwill likely alleviate Terry’s suffering. The NABR — which\n  3\n   Penalties for violation of § 3.81 and the AWA include revocation of\nfederal research funds, 8 U.S.C. § 2143(f), fines, id. § 2149(b), and, in\nsome instances, criminal penalties. Id. § 2149(d).\n\f18756          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nhas intervened as the representative of regulated entities —\ninsists in its brief to us that regulated entities would be effec-\ntively compelled to follow the Draft Policy if it were adopted.\nThe NABR made a similar statement in its motion to inter-\nvene in the district court: “Any actual change in the chal-\nlenged regulations, resulting from [Plaintiffs’] action, would\ndirectly result in new requirements with which NABR’s\nmembers must comply under the AWA.” (Emphasis added).\nThese words leave little doubt that, at least in the view of the\nregulated entities, the Draft Policy would require them to take\nsteps that plaintiffs allege would lessen or eliminate their inju-\nries.\n\n   [6] The Draft Policy, if adopted, would “alter the legal\nregime to which” regulated entities’ action is subject. Bennett\nv. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 169 (1997). Regulated entities would\nhave a choice — either to follow the Draft Policy’s proposed\nenvironmental enhancement standards and avail themselves of\nthe safe harbor, or not to follow them and risk penalties for\nnoncompliance. Fear of adverse consequences that motivates\notherwise voluntary action can satisfy the redressability\nprong. See, e.g., McClure v. Ashcroft, 335 F.3d 404, 411 (5th\nCir. 2003); see also Bennett, 520 U.S. at 169 (Article III\n“does not exclude injury produced by determinative or coer-\ncive effect upon the action of someone else.”). Even if the\nrelief sought serves an “advisory function,” the plaintiff estab-\nlishes redressability if it might have a “powerful coercive\neffect” on regulated entities. Id.; see also Tozzi v. U.S. Dep’t\nof Health & Human Servs., 271 F.3d 301, 309 (D.C. Cir.\n2001) (holding that redressability is satisfied when relief\nwould be “highly influential” in shaping a regulated entity’s\nbehavior).\n\n   [7] There is another argument for redressability, arising\nfrom Buchanan’s claim that the USDA’s withdrawal of the\nDraft Policy was arbitrary and capricious because it “failed[ ]\nto articulate a basis for the agency’s decision that the [Draft]\nPolicy is no longer ‘necessary.’ ” In a similar context — suits\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18757\ninvolving agencies’ alleged failure to comply with the proce-\ndural requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act\n— we have held that redressability is satisfied where proce-\ndural compliance “could have influenced” an agency’s action.\nCitizens for Better Forestry v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 341 F.3d\n961, 976 (9th Cir. 2003). Because requiring the USDA to\noffer a rationale for not going forward with the Draft Policy\ncould influence its decision, Buchanan’s injury is also\nredressible on this ground.\n\n  [8] We therefore conclude that Buchanan satisfies the\nredressability requirement for Article III standing.\n\n                          D.   Other Plaintiffs\n\n   Because Buchanan has Article III standing, we do not need\nto consider whether the other individual plaintiffs have it as\nwell. Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S.\n252, 264 & n.9 (1977). Nor do we need to determine whether\nthe ALDF or the AWI meets the requirements for organiza-\ntional standing. Laub v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 342 F.3d\n1080, 1086 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n              III.    Reviewable Agency Action\n\n   As indicated by Dr. Gipson’s oral announcements, and by\nthe USDA’s defense in this case, it is clear that the agency has\ndecided to abandon the Draft Policy. Thus, with the case in\nits current posture, plaintiffs cannot seek prospective relief\nunder 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) for the agency’s unreasonable delay\nin deciding the Draft Policy’s fate. The question remains\nwhether the district court should have reviewed the with-\ndrawal of the Draft Policy as a “final agency action” under the\narbitrary and capricious standard of § 706(2).\n\n                     A.    Final Agency Action\n\n  [9] The APA authorizes federal courts to review a “final\nagency action,” 5 U.S.C. § 704, to determine if it is “arbitrary,\n\f18758          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accor-\ndance with law[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The APA “creates\na strong presumption of reviewability that can be rebutted\nonly by a clear showing that judicial review would be inap-\npropriate.” Nat’l Res. Defense Council, Inc. v. Sec. & Exch.\nComm’n, 606 F.2d 1031, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (“NRDC”).\n\n   The district court determined that it lacked authority to\nreview Dr. Gipson’s statements because they did not amount\nto “definitive policy statements.” The issue here, however, is\nwhether the USDA’s decision to abandon the Draft Policy,\nnot Dr. Gipson’s statements, is reviewable “final agency\naction” within the meaning of § 704.\n\n   The term “agency action” “includes the whole or a part of\nan agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equiva-\nlent or denial thereof, or failure to act[.]” 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).\n“[T]he term . . . undoubtedly has a broad sweep[,]” but it “is\nnot so all-encompassing as to authorize [courts] to exercise\n‘judicial review [over] everything done by an administrative\nagency.’ ” Indep. Equip. Dealers Ass’n v. Envtl. Prot. Agency,\n372 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (quoting Hearst Radio,\nInc. v. FCC, 167 F.2d 225, 227 (D.C. Cir. 1948)).\n\n  “As a general matter,” two conditions must be satisfied for\nan agency action to be deemed “final”:\n\n    First, the action must mark the consummation of the\n    agency’s decisionmaking process . . . — it must not\n    be of a merely tentative or interlocutory nature. And\n    second, the action must be one by which rights or\n    obligations have been determined, or from which\n    legal consequences will flow.\n\nBennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 (1997) (internal quotations omit-\nted). Put differently, an agency action is “final” if it is “defini-\ntive” and has a “direct and immediate . . . effect on the day-\nto-day business” of the party challenging or subjected to the\n\f               ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18759\naction. Fed. Trade Comm’n v. Standard Oil Co., 449 U.S.\n232, 239 (1980) (internal quotations omitted). If an agency\naction is “binding” on the parties it targets, it is likely “final”\nfor the purposes of judicial review. See 5 Jacob A. Stein et al.,\nAdministrative Law § 43.01 (2005).\n\n   [10] “Finality” should be interpreted in a “ ‘flexible and\npragmatic way.’ ” Her Majesty the Queen ex rel. Ontario v.\nEnvtl. Prot. Agency, 912 F.2d 1525, 1531 (D.C. Cir. 1990)\n(citing Ciba-Geigy Corp. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 801 F.2d\n430, 435 (D.C. Cir. 1986)). An agency’s refusal to describe\nan action as final is not dispositive of reviewability. Id. Nor\ndoes an agency’s failure to offer a formal statement explain-\ning its action deprive that action of finality. See id. To the\ncontrary, an action may be reviewed, and set aside as arbitrary\nand capricious, precisely because the agency has failed “to\ngive a reasoned account of its decision.” Fox Tel. Stations,\nInc. v. Fed. Communications Comm’n, 280 F.3d 1027, 1045\n(D.C. Cir. 2002).\n\n   Of course, having acted in regard to the “whole or a part of\nan agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equiva-\nlent or denial thereof,” an agency remains free to engage in\nfurther policymaking activity. But the possibility of future\nagency action is not sufficient to foreclose review of a defini-\ntive action. Otherwise, “review could be deferred indefinite-\nly.” Am. Petroleum Inst. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 906 F.2d 729,\n739-40 (D.C. Cir. 1990); see also Fox, 280 F.3d at 1037-38\n(rejecting Commission’s argument that action “is not final\nbecause the agency intends to continue considering the own-\nership rules”).\n\n   The classification of an agency’s statements and declara-\ntions into categories of reviewable and non-reviewable pro-\nnouncements is an “imprecise” endeavor that requires a “case-\nby-case” assessment. Indus. Safety Equip. Ass’n v. Envt’l\nProt. Agency, 837 F.2d 1115, 1117 (D.C. Cir. 1988). But\nthere is no doubt that the USDA’s abandonment of the Draft\n\f18760            ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nPolicy is a consummation of its decisionmaking process.\nThere is nothing interlocutory or tentative about Dr. Gipson’s\nstatements. The availability of judicial review depends on\nwhether this agency action determined rights or obligations or\ntriggered legal consequences.\n\n         B.    Legislative Rules, Interpretive Rules, and\n                         Policy Statements\n\n   In the usual case, a court must determine whether an agen-\ncy’s affirmative act constitutes final agency action for pur-\nposes of judicial review. Our task is different, for we must\ndetermine whether the USDA’s decision to abandon a course\nof action is reviewable. We divide our analysis into two parts:\nFirst, would the Draft Policy, if adopted, have been review-\nable? Second, is the USDA’s decision not to adopt that Draft\nPolicy reviewable?\n\n        1.    Reviewability of the Draft Policy if Adopted\n\n   [11] A reviewable “agency action” includes an “agency\nrule.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). The APA defines “rule” as “the\nwhole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular\napplicability and future effect designed to implement, inter-\npret, or prescribe law or policy . . . .” 5 U.S.C. § 551(4).\nPlainly, the Draft Policy is (1) an “agency statement” (2) of\n“general . . . applicability” and “future effect” (3) designed to\n“implement” and “interpret” § 3.81 and the AWA. If adopted,\nit would have constituted a “rule” within the meaning of\n§ 551(4).\n\n  [12] The term “rule” may embrace “virtually every state-\nment an agency may make,” Avoyelles Sportsmen’s League,\nInc. v. Marsh, 715 F.2d 897, 908 (5th Cir. 1983), but not all\nagency statements are reviewable. Although the distinction\namong them is “ ‘enshrouded in considerable smog,’ ” Am.\nBus Ass’n. v. United States, 627 F.2d 525, 529 (D.C. Cir.\n1980) (quoting Noel v. Chapman, 508 F.2d 1023, 1030 (2d\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18761\nCir. 1975)), there are essentially three kinds of agency rules:\nlegislative rules, interpretive rules, and policy statements. See\nRobert A. Anthony, Interpretive Rules, Policy Statements,\nGuidances, Manuals and the Like — Should Federal Agen-\ncies Use Them to Bind the Public?, 41 Duke L.J. 1311, 1315\n(1992); see also Attorney General’s Manual on the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act 30 n.3 (1947) (“Attorney General’s\nManual”). The USDA’s chosen title for the document at issue\nhere — “Draft Policy” — suggests that it falls into the third\ncategory. However, “the agency’s own label, while relevant,\nis not dispositive.” Gen. Motors Corp. v. Ruckelshaus, 742\nF.2d 1561, 1565 (D.C. Cir. 1984). More important for classi-\nfication purposes are the ends the agency document serves\nand the effects it will have on regulated entities.\n\n   Legislative rules “create new law, rights or duties,” are pro-\nmulgated pursuant to an exercise of delegated power, and\nrequire a notice-and-comment period. Ruckelshaus, 742 F.2d\nat 1565; David v. Donovan, 698 F.2d 1057, 1058 (9th Cir.\n1983). They indisputably constitute “agency action” and are\nsubject to judicial review, for they determine rights and obli-\ngations and have legal consequences. See Gen. Motors Corp.\nv. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 363 F.3d 442, 448 (D.C. Cir. 2004).\n\n   [13] Interpretive rules, as defined by the 1947 Attorney\nGeneral’s Manual, are “rules or statements issued by an\nagency to advise the public of the agency’s construction of the\nstatutes and rules which it administers.” Attorney General’s\nManual at 30 n.3. An interpretive rule is issued “to clarify or\nexplain existing law or regulations so as to advise the public\nof the agency’s construction of the rules it administers.”\nGunderson v. Hood, 268 F.3d 1149, 1154 (9th Cir. 2001)\n(emphasis added). It “spells out a duty fairly encompassed\nwithin the regulation that the interpretation purports to con-\nstrue.” Paralyzed Veterans of Am. v. D.C. Arena L.P., 117\nF.3d 579, 588 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\n\n   [14] Interpretive rules lack formal status as law. See Syncor\nInt’l Corp. v. Shalala, 127 F.3d 90, 94 (D.C. Cir. 1997). As\n\f18762          ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\na practical matter, however, an interpretive rule may affect the\nregulatory practices of an agency or the expectations of a reg-\nulated entity as to what a law or legislative rule means and\nhow it will be enforced. When an interpretive rule has “a sub-\nstantial impact on the rights of individuals[,]” its promulga-\ntion may constitute final agency action for the purposes of\njudicial review. Am. Postal Workers Union v. U.S. Postal\nServ., 707 F.2d 548, 560 (D.C. Cir. 1983); see also Nat’l\nAss’n of Home Builders v. Norton, 415 F.3d 8, 15 (D.C. Cir.\n2005) (“Finality resulting from the practical effect of an\nostensibly non-binding agency proclamation is a concept\n[courts] have recognized in the past.”). We and our sister cir-\ncuits have construed interpretive rules to be judicially review-\nable. See, e.g., US West Communications, Inc. v. Hamilton,\n224 F.3d 1049, 1055 (9th Cir. 2000) (observing that “[w]hat\nscant case law there is suggests that [reviewable] ‘final\norders’ include both interpretive and legislative orders”); Star\nEnter. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 235 F.3d 139, 146 (3d Cir.\n2000) (describing standard of review for interpretive rule). Cf.\nMartin v. Occupational Safety & Health Review Comm’n, 499\nU.S. 144, 157 (1991) (observing that interpretive rules are\n“entitled to some weight on judicial review”).\n\n   Finally, “general statements of policy” are “statements\nissued by an agency to advise the public prospectively of the\nmanner in which the agency proposes to exercise a discretion-\nary power.” Attorney General’s Manual 30 at n.3. In other\nwords, they may tell the public how the agency plans to exer-\ncise its enforcement discretion. A policy statement is intended\n“to allow agencies to announce their tentative intentions for\nthe future . . . without binding themselves.” Am. Hosp. Ass’n\nv. Bowen, 834 F.2d 1037, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (internal\nquotation omitted) (emphasis added); see also Guardian Fed.\nSav. & Loan Ass’n v. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp., 589 F.2d\n658, 666 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (“A general statement of policy . . .\ndoes not establish a binding norm. It is not finally determina-\ntive of the issues or rights to which it is addressed.”) (internal\nquotations omitted). “[T]he agency retains the discretion and\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18763\nthe authority to change its position — even abruptly — in any\nspecific case because a change in its policy does not effect the\nlegal norm.” Syncor, 127 F.3d at 94.\n\n   General statements of policy are tentative in character: the\nagency, having announced how it plans to exercise its\nenforcement discretion, may nonetheless change course in any\nparticular case. This tentative character generally renders gen-\neral statements of policy insufficiently final or definitive to\npermit judicial review. Hence, a “typical policy statement” is\n“not reviewable at all.” Tozzi, 271 F.3d at 312 (Silberman, J.,\nconcurring); see also Indus. Safety Equip., 837 F.2d at 1119\nn.8 (“Discretionary agency positions are generally best not\ntested on review until the policy is actually applied . . . .”);\nOffice of Communication of United Church of Christ v. Fed.\nCommunications Comm’n, 826 F.2d 101, 105-06 (D.C. Cir.\n1987) (nonbinding, prospective quality of policy statement\nmakes it unripe for judicial review).\n\n   The Draft Policy, if finalized, would not have amounted to\na legislative rule. Its purpose — merely to “clarify” existing\nobligations prescribed by the AWA and § 3.81 — is the most\nobvious evidence to this effect. 64 Fed. Reg. at 38146. The\nDraft Policy would have added considerable detail to § 3.81,\nbut it would not have announced any new requirements for\nregulated entities. To the contrary, even if the Draft Policy\nwere adopted, a regulated entity could still comply with\n§ 3.81 without following its specific recommendations for\nconditions of captivity.\n\n   [15] But neither would the finalized Draft Policy have been\na general policy statement — that is, a tentative declaration of\nhow the USDA might have enforced § 3.81 and the AWA.\nRather, it is best characterized as a proposed interpretive rule.\nThe Draft Policy would have summarized “what the [USDA]\nbelieve[d] must be considered and included” in an environ-\nmental enhancement plan. 64 Fed. Reg. at 38146 (emphasis\nadded). It would have provided categorically that entities that\n\f18764         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nfollow the specific terms of its safe harbor “will meet the\nrequirements of § 3.81.” Id. at 38146 (emphasis added). Com-\npare Am. Bus Ass’n, 627 F.2d at 532 (use of “will” indicates\nstatement is a binding norm), with Guardian Fed., 589 F.2d\nat 666 (use of term “may” indicates statement is a “general\nstatement of policy”). Such safe harbors, which offer regu-\nlated entities a guaranteed way to protect themselves from\nadverse enforcement, have legal consequence. See Gen. Elec.\nCo. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 290 F.3d 377, 383 (D.C. Cir.\n2002) (“ ‘In some circumstances, if the language of the docu-\nment is such that private parties can rely on it as a norm or\nsafe harbor by which to shape their actions, it can be binding\nas a practical matter.’ ”) (quoting Anthony, Interpretive Rules,\n41 Duke L.J. at 1329) (emphasis added); Atlantic Richfield\nCo. v. Fed. Energy Admin., 556 F.2d 542, 552 (T.E.C.A.\n1977) (observing that an agency document that lacks formally\nbinding effect “may have extremely important consequences\nwith respect to the issue of good faith reliance for future acts”\nand therefore constitute “final agency action”).\n\n   [16] In short, the USDA would have bound itself to a par-\nticular interpretation of § 3.81 for enforcement purposes had\nit adopted the Draft Policy. Such restrictions on an agency’s\nregulatory discretion are features of interpretive rules, not\ngeneral policy statements. See Syncor, 127 F.3d at 94 (“The\nprimary distinction between . . . any rule . . . and a general\nstatement of policy, then, turns on whether an agency intends\nto bind itself to a particular legal position.”).\n\n   [17] We conclude that the Draft Policy, if adopted, would\nhave been judicially reviewable as an interpretive rule from\nwhich legal consequence flowed. Our conclusion is buttressed\nby the Draft Policy’s publication in the Federal Register, and\nthe fact that the USDA opened a public comment period for\nit. Both of these procedural attributes would have strength-\nened the Draft Policy’s claim to binding authority had it been\nadopted. See Molycorp, Inc. v. Envtl. Prot. Agency, 197 F.3d\n543, 545 (D.C. Cir. 1999); Rank v. Nimmo, 677 F.2d 692, 698\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN            18765\n(9th Cir. 1982). Moreover, a record assembled through a\nnotice-and-comment period enables judicial review by provid-\ning courts with materials necessary to evaluate the rule’s suf-\nficiency. See Int’l Union, UMW v. Mine Safety & Health\nAdmin., 407 F.3d 1250, 1259 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\n  2.   Reviewability of the Withdrawal of the Draft Policy\n\n   We now turn to the second part of our inquiry — whether\nthe USDA’s abandonment of the Draft Policy is judicially\nreviewable. This part of the inquiry raises two interrelated\nquestions. First, did the abandonment of a Draft Policy have\nlegal consequences or determine rights or obligations? Sec-\nond, does it make a difference that the USDA had no legal\nobligation to propose or adopt the Draft Policy in the first\nplace?\n\n  a.   Legal Consequences or Determination of Rights or\n                       Obligations\n\n   [18] The abandonment of a proposed rule such as the Draft\nPolicy leaves the status quo in place. But maintaining the sta-\ntus quo has legal consequences. Our decision in Defenders of\nWildlife v. Norton, 258 F.3d 1136 (9th Cir. 2001), illustrates\nthis point. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) requires that\nthe Secretary of the Interior designate as “endangered” or\n“threatened” any species at risk of extinction. 16 U.S.C.\n§ 1532(6). The Secretary withdrew a proposed rule that would\nhave designated the flat-tailed horned lizard an endangered\nspecies, thereby leaving the status quo undisturbed. 258 F.3d\nat 1138-39. The consequences of leaving the status quo undis-\nturbed were obvious. Because it denied the flat-tailed horned\nlizard the protections afforded to endangered species by the\nESA, the Secretary’s decision, if incorrect, exposed the lizard\nto risk of extinction. We therefore reviewed the Secretary’s\ndecision.\n\n   It is clear that the Draft Policy would have determined\nrights and obligations of the regulated entities. A regulated\n\f18766         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nentity in doubt about its obligations under § 3.81 and the\nAWA would have known, after the adoption of the Draft Pol-\nicy, precisely what it could have done to ensure that it ful-\nfilled its obligations. Compliance with the safe harbor\nrequirements would have protected against adverse enforce-\nment actions by the USDA. Indeed, as we have been told by\nthe intervenor NABR, the Draft Policy would have had the\npractical consequence of strongly encouraging, perhaps even\nrequiring, regulated entities to comply with its terms. Thus, it\nclearly would have had a legal consequence if adopted.\n\n   [19] The converse is also true. Without the Draft Policy,\nthere is no safe harbor. As the Final Report indicated, the\npractical effect is that regulated entities have little incentive\nto change their behavior. Because the abandonment of the\nDraft Policy means that regulated entities will not change\ntheir behavior, the status quo remains undisturbed. The conse-\nquence is that harm to chimpanzees like Terry continues, and\naesthetic injury to individuals like Buchanan also continues.\n\n   Of course, the USDA may promulgate other Draft Policies\nin the future, as Dr. Gipson has suggested in his declaration\nit intends to do. For now, however, the agency’s last word is\nthat the Draft Policy is not necessary, with the effect that the\nDraft Policy has been abandoned, and that the status quo\nremains unchanged. See Fox, 280 F.3d at 1038.\n\n  b.    USDA Had No Obligation to Act in the First Place\n\n   The conclusion that the failure to adopt the Draft Policy\nhad legal consequence is not necessarily the end of the\ninquiry. The USDA relies on the D.C. Circuit’s decision in\nGlickman II, which held that § 3.81 adequately discharged the\nUSDA’s rulemaking obligation under the AWA. Because it\nhad no statutory duty to propose the Draft Policy in the first\nplace, the USDA argues, its decision to abandon the policy is\nunreviewable. We disagree.\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN             18767\n   We do not question the conclusion of the D.C. Circuit in\nGlickman I. Because § 3.81 passed muster standing on its\nown, the USDA’s decision to propose the Draft Policy was\nnot compelled by the AWA. “An agency’s discretionary deci-\nsion not to regulate a given activity is inevitably based, in\nlarge measure, on factors not inherently susceptible to judicial\nresolution, e.g., internal management considerations as to\nbudget and personnel; evaluations of its own competence;\nweighing of competing policies within a broad statutory\nframework.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at 1046. Moreover, “even if an\nagency considers a particular problem worthy of regulation, it\nmay determine for reasons lying within its special expertise\nthat the time for action has not yet arrived.” Id. Judicial\nsecond-guessing of such decisions triggers concerns of over-\nreaching, particularly when the agency has already deemed\nthe regulation unworthy of adoption. Id. at 1045.\n\n   [20] Nonetheless, courts have reviewed, albeit highly defer-\nentially, the withdrawal of proposed rules like the Draft Pol-\nicy. An example is Center for Auto Safety v. National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, 710 F.2d 842 (D.C.\nCir. 1983). A statute provided that the National Highway and\nTraffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) “ ‘may by rule . . .\namend the average fuel economy standard . . . to a level which\n[it] determines is the maximum feasible average fuel economy\nlevel . . . .’ ” Id. at 844 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 2002(a)(4))\n(emphasis added). The agency refused to finalize a proposed\nregulation that would have tightened fuel economy standards\nfor certain cars. Noting the reasons the NHTSA gave for with-\ndrawing its proposed regulation, the court concluded that\n\n    [t]hese statements accompanying the withdrawal of\n    the [proposed rule] clearly interpret the relevant stat-\n    ute and indicate NHTSA’s policy regarding the exer-\n    cise of discretion granted to it by that legislative\n    enactment. Given our prior decisions construing the\n    Administrative Procedure Act’s broad definition of\n    “rule,” we are compelled to conclude that NHTSA\n\f18768         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n    has prescribed a rule sufficient to grant this court\n    jurisdiction . . . .\n\nId. at 846. In other words, the retreat to the status quo as the\nagency’s policy was reviewable, even though the statute at\nissue, by using the term “may,” allowed the agency the choice\nwhether to engage in rulemaking in the first place.\n\n   The D.C. Circuit’s decision in Professional Drivers Coun-\ncil v. Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety, 706 F.2d 1216 (D.C.\nCir. 1983), is also instructive. There, the agency withdrew a\nproposed amendment to an existing rule that specified hours-\nof-service requirements for commercial truck drivers. The\ndecision to withdraw the proposed rule did not take place\nagainst a legal obligation to act:\n\n    This is not a situation where the agency has shirked\n    its statutory duty by refusing to regulate. The agency\n    has regulated the field. In this instance, the agency’s\n    statutory authority to regulate is permissive. The\n    statute provides that the agency “may establish rea-\n    sonable requirements.” The permissive nature of the\n    statute implies broad agency discretion in selecting\n    the appropriate manner of regulation.\n\nId. at 1221. The D.C. Circuit recognized the limited scope of\njudicial inquiry into this sort of agency decisionmaking:\n\n    The circumscribed scope of this review is dictated by\n    both the nature of the administrative proceeding\n    (informal rulemaking) and by the nature of the ulti-\n    mate decision (not to promulgate rules). The record\n    in an informal rulemaking proceeding is a less than\n    fertile ground for judicial review . . . . Furthermore,\n    rulemaking is an inherently policy-oriented process\n    and the agency must be accorded considerable defer-\n    ence in evaluating information presented and reach-\n    ing decisions based upon its expertise. Our review is\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18769\n    also circumscribed by the fact that the agency\n    decided not to promulgate new rules in an area\n    already heavily regulated.\n\nId. at 1220-21 (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis added).\nNonetheless, the court in the end reaffirmed its authority to\nexercise judicial review. It gave effect to the agency’s interest\nin having relatively unfettered power to decide whether to\nadopt rules not by abandoning its reviewing authority alto-\ngether but by exercising a highly deferential standard of\nreview. See id.\n\n   Finally, International Union, United Mine Workers of\nAmerica v. United States Department of Labor demonstrates\nthat once an agency has embarked on a course of action, even\na discretionary course of action, a court may review the agen-\ncy’s failure to explain its subsequent abandonment of that\ncourse of action. There, the D.C. Circuit reviewed the with-\ndrawal of a proposed Air Quality rule by the Mine Safety and\nHealth Administration (“MSHA”) after a public hearing and\ncomment period. 358 F.3d at 41-42. The D.C. Circuit\nexplained that while the MSHA was under no obligation to\nadopt the proposed rule, “or, for that matter, any rule,” it was\nnot “free to terminate the rulemaking for no reason whatsoev-\ner.” Id. at 43-44 (quotation marks omitted). The D.C. Circuit\nreviewed the withdrawal of the proposed rule under the\nAPA’s “deferential ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard,” stat-\ning that it would “give more deference to an agency’s deci-\nsion to withdraw a proposed rule than we give to its decision\nto promulgate a new rule or to rescind an existing one.” Id.\nat 43. Despite this heightened deference, the D.C. Circuit held\nthat the withdrawal was arbitrary and capricious because the\nMSHA’s explanations — that “there was a ‘change in agency\npriorities,’ ” the record was stale, and a recent Eleventh Cir-\ncuit opinion cast doubt on the proposed rule — were inade-\nquate. Id. at 44-45.\n\n  [21] The D.C. Circuit has offered two helpful criteria to\ndetermine when the withdrawal of a voluntarily proposed rule\n\f18770         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nmay be amenable to at least a “minimal level of judicial scru-\ntiny.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at 1047. The agency must have “held\na rulemaking proceeding,” and it must have “compiled a\nrecord narrowly focused on the particular rules suggested but\nnot adopted.” Id. In NRDC, the D.C. Circuit explained that the\nconcern that a court may improperly oblige an agency to\nspend resources defending a withdrawn rule is diminished\nwhen the agency has undertaken extensive rulemaking pro-\nceedings before it abandons a proposed rule. Id. at 1045-46.\nSuch activity “evidences [the agency’s] view that the propos-\nals are sufficiently meritorious to warrant further investigation\n. . . .” Id. at 1046. Having solicited public participation, the\nprospect of judicial review would also force the agency to\ngive due regard to citizen input. Id. Moreover, concerns over\na court’s lack of institutional competence are lessened to the\ndegree that the pre-withdrawal rulemaking proceeding has\nbeen extensive and has thereby provided more data to the\nreviewing court. Id. at 1047.\n\n   In essence, the criteria help to distinguish between two\nclasses of cases, one ordinarily reviewable and the other not\nreviewable. In the first class, an agency undertakes an action\n— for example, promulgation of a Draft Policy — but subse-\nquently changes course and abandons that action. Properly\napplied, the criteria ensure that a sufficient record exists for\na court to identify a discrete change of course, and to review\nthe change of course to determine whether it was arbitrary and\ncapricious. Id. at 1046-47; see also Fox, 280 F.3d at 1037\n(“There is no question [an agency] determination not to repeal\nor to modify a rule, after giving notice of and receiving com-\nment upon a proposal to do so, is a final agency action subject\nto judicial review.”).\n\n   In the second class of cases, an agency simply declines to\ntake any action at all. Absent a particular statutory mandate\nthat the agency act, these cases are considered presumptively\nunreviewable in part because courts lack a “focus for judicial\nreview . . . to determine whether the agency exceeded its stat-\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN            18771\nutory powers.” Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985);\nsee also id. at 834, 838. Courts have no means to choose\nbetween the “infinite number of rules that an agency could\nadopt in its discretion,” NRDC, 606 F.2d at 1046, other than\nundertaking the “complicated balancing of a number of fac-\ntors” ordinarily considered to be “peculiarly within [the agen-\ncy’s] expertise.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. The D.C. Circuit’s\nanalysis in NRDC is fully consistent with the Supreme\nCourt’s later decision in Chaney, for NRDC concerned an\nabandonment of a course of action whereas Chaney concerned\na mere failure to act.\n\n   [22] We endorse and apply the D.C. Circuit’s criteria in\nNRDC. Both are satisfied here, and thus this case falls within\nthe class of reviewable cases. The USDA gave notice by pub-\nlishing the Draft Policy in the Federal Register on July 15,\n1999, and it solicited comments from the public. Plaintiffs\nallege that, by the time the comment period ended on October\n13, 1999, see 66 Fed. Reg. 61327, 61364 (Dec. 3, 2001), the\nagency had received more than 200 sets of comments. More-\nover, the comments solicited were to address the “content of\nthe draft policy,” and thus focused narrowly on the proposed\nrule. 64 Fed. Reg. at 38147.\n\n                        C.   Summary\n\n   [23] The USDA’s decision to abandon the Draft Policy is\ndefinitive and final. By leaving the status quo in place, the\nUSDA gives regulated entities no incentive to adopt environ-\nmental enhancement plans that comply with a set of standards\nthe agency at one time deemed “necessary” for the effective\nimplementation of § 3.81. The USDA held rulemaking pro-\nceedings before it abandoned the Draft Policy and therefore\nassembled a record amenable to judicial review. We therefore\nconclude that the abandonment of the Draft Policy constitutes\na final agency action for the purposes of § 706(2).\n\f18772         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n                         Conclusion\n\n   We conclude that plaintiff Buchanan has standing under\nArticle III based on the aesthetic injury she has described. We\nfurther conclude that the USDA’s withdrawal of the Draft\nPolicy constitutes final agency action that is reviewable pur-\nsuant to § 706(2) of the APA. We therefore reverse the district\ncourt’s dismissal of this case. On remand, the district court\nshall determine whether the USDA’s withdrawal of the Draft\nPolicy was arbitrary and capricious in violation of § 706(2) of\nthe APA.\n\n  REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\nKOZINSKI, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   In holding that we can review withdrawal of proposed reg-\nulations an agency had no duty to adopt, my colleagues over-\nlook the sea-change in administrative law wrought by Heckler\nv. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831-32 (1985), which held that we\nhave no authority to review an agency’s discretionary deci-\nsion not to act. See The Supreme Court—Leading Cases:\nJudicial Review of Agency Inaction, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 264,\n269 (1985) (hereafter “Judicial Review of Agency Inaction”)\n(“Chaney represents a significant departure from the trend of\nrecent administrative law.”). Failure to appreciate the funda-\nmental distinction between agency action and inaction perme-\nates every aspect of the majority’s analysis, starting with the\nthreshold question of standing.\n\n                          Standing\n\n   1. The majority wastes much toner trying to show that\nUSDA’s Draft Policy at issue here would, if adopted, amelio-\nrate the conditions plaintiffs complain about. Maj. op. at\n18754-57. Even if this were true, which it is not, see pp.\n\f                 ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                     18773\n18774-77 infra, it doesn’t matter. In determining whether\nplaintiffs have standing, the question is not whether the agen-\ncy’s proposed action would have benefitted them, but whether\nthis lawsuit will do so. The Draft Policy only matters if the\ncourt can order, or at least move the agency towards, its adop-\ntion.\n\n   Certainly we cannot order USDA to adopt the Draft Policy.1\nNo court I am aware of has ever ordered an agency to adopt\na particular regulation, and for good reason.2 Adoption of reg-\nulations is an executive function that no court has authority to\nperform. Even where the agency is required by law to act, and\na court finds that it failed to do so, the court cannot tell the\nagency what regulation to adopt; rather, it must remand for\nfurther action. See, e.g., Envtl. Def. Ctr., Inc. v. EPA, 344\nF.3d 832, 863 (9th Cir. 2003); Defenders of Wildlife v. Nor-\nton, 258 F.3d 1136, 1146-47 (9th Cir. 2001). In such cases it\ncan at least be said that the court nudged the agency towards\na result favorable to the plaintiffs by correcting the agency’s\nmisinterpretation of the statute and thus narrowing its discre-\ntion. But the agency here has no duty to act; it fully dis-\ncharged its statutory responsibility by adopting the regulations\napproved by the DC Circuit. See Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc.\nv. Glickman, 204 F.3d 229, 235 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (“Glickman\n  1\n     An agency’s decision to adopt regulations is thus fundamentally differ-\nent from a failure to adopt. When an agency adopts regulations that turn\nout to be contrary to law, a court can order the agency to set them aside.\nSee, e.g., Ecology Ctr., Inc. v. Austin, 430 F.3d 1057, 1071 (9th Cir.\n2005). This is concrete relief that will benefit the plaintiff directly (pre-\nsuming he can show that he would be injured by adoption of the regula-\ntions). A court can grant no commensurate relief when a party complains\nof an agency’s failure to adopt a discretionary regulation.\n   2\n     Whether one views the proposed policy as an interpretive regulation or\na safe harbor, there is no doubt that, once adopted, the policy would tie\nthe agency’s hands. Those who comply with the policy will be entitled to\ncount on it if the agency attempts to bring an enforcement action in the\nfuture. See, e.g., Cmty. Nutrition Inst. v. Young, 818 F.2d 943, 948 (D.C.\nCir. 1987) (per curiam). Adoption of the regulation thus has consequences\nfar beyond the immediate parties to the dispute.\n\f18774            ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nII”). The most we can do is tell the agency that its reason for\nrejecting the Draft Policy is insufficient. See maj. op. at\n18772. This won’t ensure that the agency will adopt the Draft\nPolicy or narrow its discretion in any meaningful way. The\nagency is free to open up the proceedings for further com-\nment, adopt a different policy, or again reject the policy, this\ntime giving better reasons.3\n\n   I suppose that plaintiffs could then bring another lawsuit\nand we could, once again, disapprove the agency’s reasons.\nBut no matter how often the kabuki is repeated, it can never\ngive plaintiffs what they want—an order that materially limits\nthe agency’s discretion to reject the Draft Policy. This is\nbecause the agency has no legal duty to act, and there is thus\nno law we can bring to bear in narrowing its discretion. The\nagency can refuse to adopt the Draft Policy again and again,\nciting reasons of policy and convenience that we may not\nsecond-guess. See pp. 18778-83 infra. Plaintiffs are pushing\na long and very limp string, and no matter how hard they try,\nthey can never get the object at the far end to move.\n\n   2. Let’s assume, nevertheless, that plaintiffs could obtain\nan order forcing the agency to adopt the Draft Policy. Would\nthe policy, if adopted, redress their injuries, as that term is\nunderstood in our standing jurisprudence? See Allen v.\nWright, 468 U.S. 737, 751 (1984). Plaintiffs have the burden\nto show they have standing and cannot rely on “[s]peculative\ninferences . . . to connect their injury to the challenged\nactions.” Simon v. E. Ky. Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26,\n45 (1976).\n\n   A favorable result that hinges on a third party’s response is\n  3\n    The case is therefore also quite different from an agency adjudication\nwhere a court can, for example, order an agency to treat an immigrant as\neligible for asylum. See, e.g., He v. Ashcroft, 328 F.3d 593, 604 (9th Cir.\n2003). In an adjudication, the agency has a legal duty to act where the\nrecord compels a particular action vis-a-vis a particular party.\n\f               ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18775\ngenerally too speculative to support standing. In Linda R.S. v.\nRichard D., 410 U.S. 614, 618 (1973), for instance, the\nSupreme Court held that a mother didn’t have standing to\nenforce a statute that imprisoned dead-beat dads; while such\nprosecution might have resulted in future child-support pay-\nments, the result was “speculative.” Likewise, Allen v. Wright\nheld that plaintiffs had no standing to challenge the tax\nexempt status of segregated private schools because there was\nno assurance the schools would desegregate out of fear of los-\ning their exemptions. 468 U.S. at 758-59. In applying these\nprecedents we have held that an injury is not redressed if any\nbenefit to plaintiffs is “conditioned on the discretionary\nbehavior of any third party.” Fernandez v. Brock, 840 F.2d\n622, 627 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n   Of course, if the third party has no choice, its response is\nnot discretionary and may provide a basis for standing. But\nthis is only so if the regulation in question is sufficiently coer-\ncive. Maj. op. at 18756. The Draft Policy here is not coercive;\nit is, as the majority recognizes, a “safe harbor.” See id. at\n18747, 18748, 18755, 18756, 18764, 18766. Entities that\nhouse primates need not follow the Draft Policy; they may\nlawfully choose alternate means of statutory compliance. If\nfear of incarceration in Linda R.S. and loss of tax benefits in\nAllen v. Wright were insufficiently coercive to give plaintiffs\nthere standing, I don’t see how a wholly permissive regime—\none that expressly allows for alternate means of compliance—\ncan give these plaintiffs standing.\n\n   The majority mistakenly relies on the representation of the\nintervenor, the National Association for Biomedical Research\n(NABR). NABR takes this view, however, based on its inter-\npretation of the Draft Policy as mandatory—a position the\nmajority correctly rejects. Maj. op. at 18763. Once we have\ndetermined that the Draft Policy is merely a safe harbor,\nNABR’s members will be free, just like everyone else, to\nabide by the policy or not, as they see fit. Certainly, nothing\nNABR has said in this litigation can bind its members to fol-\n\f18776         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nlow the policy, should it be implemented. Because there is no\nway of knowing whether any particular facility will comply,\nplaintiffs cannot show that they will benefit from the policy\nbecause the facilities they are concerned with may not.\n\n   What intervenor says doesn’t matter anyhow, because it\ncannot speak—nor does it purport to speak—for all facilities\nthat house primates. “NABR is an association of more than\n300 universities, colleges, medical schools, veterinary\nschools, research institutes, research companies, and pharma-\nceutical manufacturers, as well as individual biomedical\nresearchers, engaged in the care and use of animals in\nbiomedical research.” Yet the single example on which the\nmajority bases standing involves Terry, a chimpanzee housed\nin a zoo. Zoos differ from the research-industry entities that\nmake up NABR’s membership. They’re typically cash-\nstrapped non-profit organizations with significant public sup-\nport in the local community. They need not fear that sensitive\nand expensive research projects will be disrupted if they fall\nout of compliance. Their risk calculus might be quite different\nfrom that of organizations represented by NABR. The South-\nern Nevada Zoological-Botanical Park where Terry is housed,\na facility already certified by USDA as compliant, may well\nchoose not to comply with the Draft Policy.\n\n   But let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that Terry’s zoo\ndid feel it had to follow the Draft Policy. I don’t see how we\ncan be sure that such compliance would ameliorate Buchan-\nan’s injury. The gravamen of her complaint is that Terry is\nlonely because he is housed by himself. The majority con-\ncludes that compliance with the Draft Policy would alleviate\nTerry’s suffering, pointing to the following language: “[i]n\norder to address the social needs of nonhuman primates under\n§ 3.81(a), the [zoo’s environmental enhancement] plan must\nprovide for each primate of a species known to be social in\nnature to be housed with other primates whenever possible.”\nMaj. op. at 18754 (quoting Draft Policy on Environmental\nEnhancement for Nonhuman Primates, 64 Fed. Reg. 38,145,\n\f                 ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                     18777\n38,147 (proposed July 15, 1999)) (alterations in original). The\nmajority zooms in on “must” but gives no effect to “whenever\npossible.” It also overlooks the language that exempts facili-\nties from this requirement if there is “[d]ocumented unavaila-\nbility of compatible individuals.” 64 Fed. Reg. at 38,147. In\nother words, the zoo must only house Terry with another\nchimpanzee if it has another chimpanzee to house him with.\nBuchanan could easily have alleged that Terry’s zoo had a\ncompatible primate, but she didn’t. For all we know—for all\nthe record reflects—Terry is the only chimp at the Southern\nNevada Zoological-Botanical Park, or the zoo may have other\nchimps that can’t be moved without disruption to themselves\nor their current companions. Even if the zoo believed it\nneeded to comply with the Draft Policy, it could do so by doc-\numenting the unavailability of another compatible animal. To\nconclude that Buchanan has established standing is to make\nspeculation the hallmark of redressability.4\n  4\n    The majority also claims plaintiffs’ injuries would be redressed\nbecause forcing the agency to provide “a rationale for not going forward\nwith the Draft Policy could influence [USDA’s] decision.” Maj. op. at\n18757. The majority lifts this “procedural redressability” theory from our\nNEPA case law, but NEPA is a statute that spells out procedural require-\nments designed to influence the agency’s decision-making process. The\ninjury thus arises when the agency makes a decision without complying\nwith those procedures. For example, in Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture, 341 F.3d 961 (9th Cir. 2003), on which the\nmajority relies, plaintiffs claimed that the agency had published a national\nforest management policy that “was not accompanied by any environmen-\ntal or endangered-species analysis,” and “did not entertain comments\nregarding the rule’s environmental impact.” Id. at 967. Because the agency\nbypassed statutory procedures designed to influence its deliberations, we\nheld that plaintiffs need not show that the agency would make a different\ndecision, had the procedures been followed; it was sufficient that the pro-\ncedures could influence the decision-making process. Plaintiffs here can\npoint to no statutory requirement that the agency bypassed by withdrawing\nthe Draft Policy without comment. The procedural redressability theory\nhas no application where there is no procedural requirement the agency\nfailed to comply with.\n\f18778         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n                        Reviewability\n\n   1. The majority concludes that the agency’s failure to\nadopt the Draft Policy is reviewable because the Draft Policy\nitself, if adopted, would have been reviewable. Maj. op. at\n18765-66. This doesn’t follow; adoption and nonadoption of\nregulations are asymmetrical events. Regulations change the\nlaw, and thus can sharply affect the legal interests of private\nparties. Failure to adopt regulations leaves rights and respon-\nsibilities unchanged; it leaves the status quo in place. See\nKennecott Utah Copper v. U.S Dep’t of the Interior, 88 F.3d\n1191, 1207 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“Because [the agency’s] deci-\nsion to withdraw the [proposed regulation] did not alter sub-\nstantive legal obligations under previously published\nregulations, the agency’s decision to withdraw the document\ndid not constitute a ‘regulation’ within the meaning of § 113\nof CERCLA.”). Because parties are not entitled to an agen-\ncy’s discretionary regulation, they can’t claim to be aggrieved\nwhen the agency fails to adopt it.\n\n   When an agency adopts regulations, a court can judge\nwhether those regulations are consistent with the agency’s\ngrant of authority (under the broad limits of Chevron USA\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S.\n837, 844-45 (1984)), and whether they constitute an abuse of\ndiscretion. There is, in the words of the Supreme Court, “law\nto apply.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe,\n401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971). But an agency may choose not to\nadopt discretionary regulations for a variety of reasons, many\nof which a court can’t review: a change in policy; a lack of\nenforcement resources; a lack of scientific expertise to\naddress the problem at this time; a change in direction based\non a determination that the problem is better addressed some\nother way. All of these matters are, in the words of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, “committed to agency discre-\ntion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). There is nothing for a\ncourt to review.\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18779\n   There was a time when the Supreme Court (like the major-\nity here) disdained the distinction between agency action and\ninaction. See, e.g., Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, 307\nU.S. 125, 143 (1939). But the Court turned its back on this\ncaselaw in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), which\nheld that an agency’s decision not to act is, under ordinary cir-\ncumstances, unreviewable.\n\n   Chaney involved death row inmates who claimed that the\nFDA had shirked its duty by failing to prevent states from\nusing drugs for lethal injections. According to the inmates,\nthese drugs had not been proven “safe and effective” for use\nin human executions, as required by the applicable statute. Id.\nat 824. In rejecting this contention, the Court closely exam-\nined the text of the APA, and concluded that an agency’s fail-\nure to act is insulated from judicial review in two\ncircumstances. First, under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), an agency\ndecision may not be judicially reviewed “when Congress has\nexpressed an intent to preclude judicial review.” 470 U.S. at\n830. Neither here nor in Chaney is this provision applicable.\nBut the Court went on to hold that judicial review is also pre-\ncluded under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) where “no judicially man-\nageable standards are available for judging how and when an\nagency should exercise its discretion.” 470 U.S. at 830. The\nCourt held that an agency’s discretionary decision not to\nenforce a statute—even though it has the authority to do so—\nis unreviewable.\n\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that the agen-\ncy’s decision not to exercise its enforcement powers is “gen-\nerally committed to [its] absolute discretion.” Id. at 831. This,\nthe Court said, “is attributable in no small part to the general\nunsuitability for judicial review of agency decisions to refuse\nenforcement.” Id. “The reasons for this general unsuitability,”\nthe Court continued, “are many.” Id. Among them, the Court\nlisted the following:\n\n    [T]he agency must not only assess whether a viola-\n    tion has occurred, but whether agency resources are\n\f18780            ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n      best spent on this violation or another, whether the\n      agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the par-\n      ticular enforcement action requested best fits the\n      agency’s overall policies, and, indeed, whether the\n      agency has enough resources to undertake the action\n      at all. . . .\n\n         In addition to these administrative concerns, we\n      note that when an agency refuses to act it generally\n      does not exercise its coercive power over an individ-\n      ual’s liberty or property rights, and thus does not\n      infringe upon areas that courts often are called upon\n      to protect. Similarly, when an agency does act to\n      enforce, that action itself provides a focus for judi-\n      cial review, inasmuch as the agency must have exer-\n      cised its power in some manner. The action at least\n      can be reviewed to determine whether the agency\n      exceeded its statutory power.\n\nId. at 831-32.\n\n   While Chaney spoke directly to an agency’s enforcement\nactions, its teachings sweep more broadly. Regulations impli-\ncate precisely the same concerns addressed in Chaney; one\ncan properly view the adoption—or non-adoption—of regula-\ntions as an enforcement decision.5 In adopting regulations, the\nagency implements the mandate of its governing statute by\ncoercing the conduct of private parties. Regulations channel\nthe agency’s enforcement efforts and commit agency\nresources to a particular interpretation of the statute. A deci-\nsion to promulgate regulations, just like a decision to enforce,\namounts to an exercise of agency authority, which “at least\ncan be reviewed to determine whether the agency exceeded its\nstatutory powers.” Id. at 832. Failure to adopt discretionary\n  5\n   Indeed, part of the relief sought by the inmates in Chaney was that the\nagency “adopt procedures for seizing the drugs from state prisons.” 470\nU.S. at 824.\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18781\nregulations, by contrast, may reflect considerations besides\nthe applicable statute, such as a change in policy, a lack of\nresources, a decision to pursue a different course of action or\na decision to gather additional information before acting.\nSuch failure to adopt cannot normally be tested against the\napplicable statute, because it may be based on non-statutory\nconsiderations of policy and convenience that are within the\nagency’s inherent authority.\n\n   The failure to adopt regulations, like failure to enforce, may\nbe reviewed in certain narrow circumstances. The first, and\nmost common, is where the agency has a legal duty to act. Id.\nat 832-35. The typical such case is where Congress has\ndirected the agency to take a particular regulatory action—\nsuch as listing species as endangered. See Defenders of Wild-\nlife v. Norton, 258 F.3d 1136, 1137-38 (9th Cir. 2001); see\nalso Greater L.A. Council on Deafness, Inc. v. Baldridge, 827\nF.2d 1353, 1361 (9th Cir. 1987). The second is where the\nagency refuses to act based solely on a belief that it lacks\njurisdiction. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4; see, e.g., Transpa-\ncific Westbound Rate Agreement v. Fed. Mar. Comm’n, 938\nF.2d 1025, 1026-27 (9th Cir. 1991) (“The Commission’s\norder declined jurisdiction over parts of shipping agreements\nthat regulate wholly foreign transportation. . . . Instead, the\nCommission held that it had jurisdiction only over the United\nStates-foreign portion of the agreements.”). The third is where\nthe agency’s refusal to act violates constitutional rights.\nChaney, 470 U.S. at 838. Finally, a court might have jurisdic-\ntion where “the agency has ‘consciously and expressly\nadopted a general policy’ that is so extreme as to amount to\nan abdication of its statutory responsibilities.” Id. at 833 n.4\n(quoting Adams v. Richardson, 480 F.2d 1159 (D.C. Cir.\n1973) (en banc)).\n\n   None of these exceptions apply. There is certainly no claim\nthat the agency believed it lacked jurisdiction to adopt the\nDraft Policy. Nor is there any suggestion that the agency abdi-\ncated its statutory responsibilities or violated constitutional\n\f18782            ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nrights. And, most significantly, we know for a fact that the\nagency had no statutory duty to act because the DC Circuit\nfound the regulations the agency had adopted sufficient.\nGlickman II, 204 F.3d at 235. The agency need do no more.\nAdoption of the Draft Policy was an entirely discretionary\ndecision, one the agency could choose to eschew based on a\nvariety of non-legal considerations.\n\n   The majority remands for a determination “whether the\nUSDA’s withdrawal of the Draft Policy was arbitrary and\ncapricious in violation of § 706(2) of the APA,” maj. op. at\n18772, but does not say how that determination can be made.\nThe implication seems to be that review should be on the\nrecord of the rulemaking proceedings. Id. at 40. But it’s not\nclear why this should be so. Absent a statutory duty to act, an\nagency need not adopt regulations, even if all public com-\nments submitted favor them (which is certainly not the case\nhere). The agency may decide not to adopt regulations\nbecause of a change in administrations, or some other change\nin policy.6 Or, the agency may decide to withdraw a proposed\nregulation in response to a change in law.7 The agency might\n  6\n     Withholding proposed regulations that are final but for publication in\nthe Federal Register seems to be common when there is a change in\nadministrations. See Dabney v. Reagan, 542 F. Supp. 756, 760 (S.D.N.Y.\n1982) (“Shortly after taking office, President Reagan directed the heads of\nall Executive Departments to postpone all pending regulations.”); Kenne-\ncott Utah Copper Corp., 88 F.3d at 1200-01 (Clinton administration with-\ndrawal of G.H.W. Bush administration regulation); Chen v. INS, 95 F.3d\n801, 803-04 (9th Cir. 1996) (same); Kootenai Tribe of Idaho v. Veneman,\n142 F. Supp. 2d 1231, 1236 n.6 (D. Idaho 2001) (G.W. Bush administra-\ntion postponed publication of all pending rules and regulations upon first\nentering office). The majority’s opinion casts serious doubt on this venera-\nble practice.\n   7\n     This appears to be what happened here. The agency proposed the Draft\nPolicy in response to the district court’s ruling in Animal Legal Defense\nFund, Inc. v. Glickman, 943 F. Supp. 44 (D.D.C. 1996), that the regula-\ntions it had adopted were insufficiently specific. After that ruling was\nreversed, see Glickman II, 204 F.3d at 235, the agency no doubt deemed\nthe Draft Policy unnecessary.\n\f                 ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                     18783\nalso choose a different path.8 An agency’s decision not to pro-\nceed with a regulation—just like a decision not to enforce—\ncan properly be based on a variety of judicially unreviewable\nconsiderations.\n\n   The majority’s implication that withdrawal of the policy\nmust be justified by the public comments is alarming. It locks\nan agency into a course of action—a course it cannot aban-\ndon, unless it be for reasons a court finds sufficient on the\nadministrative record. This not only improperly constrains\nagency discretion under Chaney, it discourages agencies from\nproposing discretionary regulations, lest they be stuck with\nthem if they cannot convince a federal court that the record\nsupports abandonment. If this was ever the law, it’s certainly\nnot the law today.\n\n  The majority relies on several cases from the DC Circuit,\nsee maj. op. at 18766-71, but those cases have been overtaken\nby Chaney.9 Indeed, the case on which my colleagues princi-\npally rely, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC,\n606 F.2d 1031 (D.C. Cir. 1979) (“NRDC”), is listed in Justice\n  8\n     This too seems to have played a role here. Dr. Gipson, in his statement,\nnoted as follows: “USDA and NIH had agreed to develop best manage-\nment practice guidelines concerning nonhuman primates.”\n   9\n     The majority also relies on a post-Chaney case from the DC Circuit,\nInternational Union, United Mine Workers of America v. U.S. Department\nof Labor, 358 F.3d 40 (D.C. Cir. 2004), but the case is inapposite. Con-\ntrary to the majority’s assertions, International Union is not a case where\nthe agency was embarking on a “discretionary course of action.” Maj. op.\nat 18769. Rather, the agency there was acting pursuant to a statutory obli-\ngation imposed by the Mine Safety and Health Act, which states that\n“[t]he Secretary shall . . . develop, promulgate, and revise . . . improved\nmandatory health or safety standards for the protection of life and preven-\ntion of injuries in coal or other mines.” 30 U.S.C. § 811(a) (emphasis\nadded); see also 358 F.3d at 41. As already noted, when an agency has an\nobligation to act, its failure to do so is reviewable. See pp. 18773, 18780-\n81 supra. International Union says nothing whatsoever about the situation\npresented here, where the agency has no obligation to act.\n\f18784           ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nMarshall’s concurrence as repudiated by the majority.10\nChaney, 470 U.S. at 850 n.7 (Marshall, J., concurring); see\nalso Judicial Review of Agency Inaction, supra, at 264 n.1\n(listing NRDC among the cases inconsistent with Chaney).\nJustice Marshall strongly disagreed that agency refusals to act\nare presumptively non-reviewable, but wrote only for himself;\neight Justices joined in the opinion.\n\n   2. Even on its own terms, the majority is wrong. Assum-\ning standing, assuming reviewability, assuming the cases the\nmajority relies on are still good law, judicial review is still not\njustified. The majority extracts from the DC Circuit cases two\nrequirements for reviewing non-adoption of a regulation and\nfinds both satisfied. Maj. op. 18769-71. In fact, there are two\nadditional requirements. First, the agency’s regulatory process\nmust have come to an end. See Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat’l\nHighway Traffic Safety Admin., 710 F.2d 842, 847-48 (D.C.\nCir. 1983) (action not ripe if the agency “has left open the\npossibility that the agency will initiate new rulemaking pro-\nceedings at some point in the future”). Second, the agency\nmust have “explained in detail its reason for not adopting\nthose rules.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at 1047. Neither requirement is\nsatisfied here.\n\n   a. It is perfectly clear that the agency’s decision-making\nprocess has not come to rest. Dr. Gipson’s announcement that\nthe rulemaking had been terminated adds as follows: “USDA\nand NIH had agreed to develop best management practice\nguidelines concerning nonhuman primates.” The agency has\nnot abandoned its effort to give further guidance as to the\nmanagement of primates. Rather, it has shifted focus toward\nother means of implementing that objective.\n  10\n    While Justice Marshall’s opinion is styled a concurrence, he vigor-\nously dissented from the majority’s central holding that an agency’s deci-\nsion not to enforce is presumptively non-reviewable. 470 U.S. at 853-55\n(Marshall, J., concurring).”\n\f                 ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                     18785\n   In Center for Auto Safety, on which the majority relies, the\nagency terminated rulemaking, but “left open the possibility\nthat the agency [would] initiate new rulemaking proceedings\nat some point in the future.” 710 F.2d at 847 (emphasis\nadded). Because the agency still “ha[d] a chance . . . to\namend” its existing regulations, the DC Circuit concluded that\njudicial review of the refusal to do so at that time would have\n“entangl[ed] [the courts] in abstract disagreements over\nadministrative policies.” Id. at 848 (quoting Abbott Labs. v.\nGardner, 387 U.S. 136, 148 (1967)). Here we have not\nmerely a possibility that the agency will resume the regulatory\nprocess at some unspecified future time; we know it’s doing\nso now. If review was premature in Center for Auto Safety, it\nis previable here.11\n\n   The majority’s ruling also conflicts with Ecology Center,\nInc. v. United States Forest Service, 192 F.3d 922, 926 (9th\nCir. 1999), which held that the monitoring of forest activity\nwas not reviewable. The Forest Service there published\nreports that were not interlocutory or tentative, but the moni-\ntoring itself was one of the “steps leading to an agency deci-\nsion, rather than the final action itself.” Id. at 925. Thus, it did\nnot “mark the consummation of the agency’s decision making\nprocess,” id., and review was premature. Here, Dr. Gipson’s\ndeclaration is not the end point of the agency’s decision mak-\ning, but only a step along the way. It is no more reviewable\nthan the reports in Ecology Center.\n  11\n    Action may be final even if some degree of uncertainty lingers. But\nthe majority cites no case reviewing a policy currently undergoing trans-\nformation. In Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario v. EPA, 912 F.2d\n1525, 1532 (D.C. Cir. 1990), the court found that the agency’s statement\nwas “devoid of any suggestion that it might be subject to subsequent revi-\nsion.” Here, of course, USDA’s primate policy is still up in the air. Like-\nwise, in American Petroleum Institute v. EPA, 906 F.2d 729, 739-40 (D.C.\nCir. 1990) (per curiam), the possibility of “unforeseen amendments” did\nnot render the decision unripe. Here, the change in policy is not only fore-\nseeable; it’s in progress.\n\f18786           ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n   Review of interlocutory agency statements hopelessly\nentangles the judiciary in the administrative process. The\nagency here cannot have two policies on the same issue: It\ncan either adopt something like the Draft Policy, or it can\nadopt best management practice guidelines like the ones it is\nnow considering. By allowing this lawsuit to proceed, the\nmajority leaves open the possibility that the agency will be\nforced or coaxed into adopting the Draft Policy.12 Even if the\nagency prevails before the district court, further agency pro-\nceedings will be delayed at least until the next appeal—which\nmay be years away. Until this lawsuit is over, the agency can-\nnot implement best practice guidelines, which may take the\nagency in a different direction from the Draft Policy. The\nmajority thus interferes with the agency’s ongoing consider-\nation of a live issue.\n\n   b. The majority ignores an additional requirement in the\nDC Circuit case law—that the agency “explain[ ] in detail its\nreasons for not adopting those rules.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at\n1047.\n\n   In the cases the majority cites, see maj. op. at 18766-71, the\nagencies all provided reasons a court could evaluate. NRDC,\nthe cornerstone of the majority’s argument, involved “lengthy\nexplanatory statements,” id. at 1039, that the DC Circuit\nrepeatedly referenced in affirming the agency’s decision. Id.\nat 1058-59, 1061-62. In Professional Drivers Council v.\nBureau of Motor Carrier Safety, 706 F.2d 1216 (D.C. Cir.\n1983), the agency published its reasons for terminating its\nrulemaking, id. at 1220, and the DC Circuit upheld the agency\nby reviewing the “relevant, permissible factors” upon which\nthe agency relied. Id. at 1222. In Center for Auto Safety, the\nagency also published its reasons for withdrawing the policy,\n  12\n     As I note above, we have no way of doing this. See pp. 18773-74\nsupra. But the agency can’t be sure until the litigation comes to an end.\nIt must therefore delay implementation of best practice guidelines so long\nas litigation over the Draft Policy continues.\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18787\n710 F.2d at 844, but the court never reached the issue. See p.\n18785 supra. And in International Union, the agency pro-\nvided three reasons, which the court then reviewed. 358 F.3d\nat 44.\n\n   By contrast, the agency here hasn’t provided a detailed\nexplanation as to why it abandoned the Draft Policy, or any\nreason at all. We have only Dr. Gipson’s announcement that\n“the USDA was not going forward with the Draft Policy on\nEnvironmental Enhancement for Nonhuman Primates.” With-\nout an explanation for the agency’s refusal to adopt the Draft\nPolicy, it is impossible to determine whether its decision is\narbitrary or capricious. Even if we assume that the agency did\nso for reasons contained in the record, we don’t know what\nthose reasons are. Judicial review would thus “have an unde-\nsirably abstract and hypothetical quality.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at\n1047.\n\n   What are the district judge and the parties to do on remand?\nThe judge can certainly review the record for comments sup-\nporting and opposing the Draft Policy, but how is he to deter-\nmine which of them are legitimate and which aren’t? What\nweight is he to give the various arguments? Considering and\nweighing public comments, then deciding whether to adopt,\nreject or modify a proposed rule is a quintessentially adminis-\ntrative function. It calls for the kind of expertise a district\njudge does not have and the kind of policy judgment a district\njudge is not competent to make. It is simply not a judicial\nfunction. Reviewing an agency decision where there is no\nagency decision to review is much like making ham and eggs\nwithout ham or eggs. It is precisely for this reason that the DC\nCircuit cases on which the majority relies require an explicit\nand detailed statement of reasons from the agency as a condi-\ntion for judicial review. By ignoring this crucial requirement,\nthe majority sends the parties and the district court on a fool’s\nerrand.\n\n                           *   *   *\n\f18788         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n   The majority expands the law of standing beyond recogni-\ntion. It unmoors administrative law from sound principles of\njudicial review, and insinuates the federal courts into sensitive\npolicy judgments that are the exclusive province of the Exec-\nutive Branch. It ignores the teachings of the Supreme Court\nand misapplies the precedents it relies on. It will cause no end\nof mischief. Count me out.\n\f",

VENEMAN\n                             OPINION\n\nW. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge:\n\n   Plaintiffs, who include the Animal Legal Defense Fund\n(“ALDF”), the Animal Welfare Institute (“AWI”), and three\nindividuals, challenge the United States Department of Agri-\nculture’s (“USDA”) decision not to adopt a Draft Policy that\nwould have provided guidance to zoos, research facilities, and\nother regulated entities in how to ensure the psychological\nwell-being of nonhuman primates in order to comply with the\nfederal Animal Welfare Act (“AWA”). Plaintiffs challenge\nthe decision not to adopt the Draft Policy under the Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act (“APA”) as arbitrary and capricious.\nThe district court did not reach the merits of plaintiffs’ suit\nbecause it determined that the USDA’s decision did not con-\nstitute reviewable final agency action. We disagree. We hold\nthat at least one of the plaintiffs has standing under Article III\nof the Constitution, and we conclude that the district court has\nauthority under the APA to review the USDA’s decision not\nto adopt the Draft Policy.\n\n                        I.   Background\n\n           A.    Statutory and Regulatory Backdrop\n\n   Congress enacted the AWA in 1966 “to insure that animals\nintended for use in research facilities or for exhibition pur-\nposes or for use as pets are provided humane care and treat-\nment . . . .” 7 U.S.C. § 2131(1). As originally enacted, the\nAWA left research facilities largely unregulated. See, e.g., 7\nU.S.C. § 2143(a) (repealed 1985). In 1985, Congress\namended the AWA by enacting the Improved Standards for\nLaboratory Animals Act, Pub. L. No. 99-198, 99 Stat. 1645.\nThis amendment to the AWA instructed the USDA to “pro-\nmulgate standards to govern the humane handling, care, treat-\nment, and transportation of animals by dealers, research\nfacilities, and exhibitors.” 7 U.S.C. § 2143(a)(1). These stan-\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN            18745\ndards must “include minimal requirements . . . for a physical\nenvironment adequate to promote the psychological well-\nbeing of primates.” Id. § 2143(a)(2)(B). The Secretary pro-\nposed a regulation containing these standards in 1989. See\nAnimal Welfare — Standards, 54 Fed. Reg. 10897, 10917\n(proposed Mar. 15, 1989).\n\n   The 1989 proposed regulation would have imposed a num-\nber of detailed “minimum requirements” on regulated entities.\nThese included, for example, a requirement that “nonhuman\nprimates must be housed in primary enclosures with compati-\nble members of the same species or with compatible members\nof other nonhuman primate species” unless doing so would\nendanger the animal. 54 Fed. Reg. at 10944. As finally\nadopted in 1991, however, the regulation, which requires reg-\nulated entities to create an “Environmental Enhancement\nPlan” to benefit nonhuman primates, left the requirements for\nthese “primary enclosures” more vaguely defined. See gener-\nally 56 Fed. Reg. 6426 (1991), codified at 9 C.F.R. § 3.81.\nThe social grouping provision of the regulation, for example,\ncontains no specific instruction regarding the pairing or\ngrouping of animals.

The Draft Policy\n\n   While the challenge to § 3.81 was pending before the D.C.\nCircuit in what would become Glickman II, the USDA took\na survey of USDA inspectors responsible for § 3.81’s enforce-\nment. Based on this survey, it published a “Final Report on\nEnvironment Enhancement to Promote the Psychological\nWell-Being of Nonhuman Primates” (“Final Report”) on July\n15, 1999.1 The Final Report noted that “[a]lmost half the\nresponding employees felt that the criteria in the regulations\nwere not adequate for [regulated] facilities to understand how\nto meet them and for inspectors to judge if a facility was in\ncompliance.” Inspectors complained that § 3.81 provided\n“few solid criteria” to judge compliance, and a “common\nrefrain” among those surveyed was that “too many enhance-\nment programs consisted of only one or two types of enrich-\n  1\n   The Final Report is available at http://www.aphis.usda.gov.\n\f               ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                18747\nment . . . in an otherwise barren, stimulus-poor environment.”\nStressing the “urgency of these problems[,]” the Final Report\ninsisted that “[a] strategy had to be developed to fulfill the\noriginal intent and language of the Animal Welfare Act . . . .”\n\n   On the same day the Final Report was issued, the USDA\npublished — apparently as a response to the report — a\n“Draft Policy on Environment Enhancement for Nonhuman\nPrimates” in the Federal Register and opened a period for\npublic comment. 64 Fed. Reg. 38145 (July 15, 1999) (“Draft\nPolicy”). In the Draft Policy’s preface, the USDA explained\nwhy it had not included more detailed requirements in § 3.81\nfor the treatment of nonhuman primates. See id. at 38146\n(declaring that the USDA “intentionally made the regulations\nregarding promotion of psychological well-being flexible”\nbecause “the conditions appropriate for one species do not\nnecessarily apply to another”).\n\n    However, the preface continued, “after five years of experi-\nence enforcing § 3.81,” regulated entities “did not necessarily\nunderstand how to develop an environment enhancement plan\nthat would adequately promote the psychological well-being\nof nonhuman primates.” 64 Fed. Reg. at 38146. Hence, while\nthe USDA “continue[d] to believe that [§ 3.81’s] flexibility\n. . . is in the best interests of the animals[,]” it also “believe[d]\nthat additional information on how to meet the standards in\n§ 3.81 is necessary.” Id. This additional information would\nremedy the “considerable disagreement” and “confusion”\namong the public and regulated entities as to what § 3.81\nrequired, and it would give agency inspectors a workable set\nof enforcement criteria to apply. Id. In other words, the Draft\nPolicy would “clarify[ ] what actions [the USDA] consider[s]\nnecessary in order to comply with” § 3.81. Id.\n\n  The Draft Policy listed a number of specific features that a\nregulated entity could usefully include in an environmental\nenhancement plan. 64 Fed. Reg. at 38146. In particular, the\nDraft Policy provided for a safe harbor within which regu-\n\f18748         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nlated entities could be sure that they were in compliance with\nthe regulation and the AWA. It stated that if regulated entities\n“develop and follow environmental enhancement plans that\nare in accordance with the draft policy[,]” they would neces-\nsarily “meet the requirements of § 3.81 . . . .” Id. Regulated\nentities could adopt plans outside the safe harbor, however, so\nlong as the plans complied with the regulation and the AWA.\nId.\n\n                   C.   Procedural History\n\n   The Draft Policy remained just that — a draft — for several\nyears. In July 2003, plaintiffs, frustrated that the USDA had\nfailed to take any final action, sued the Secretary and other\nUSDA officials (collectively, the “USDA”) in federal district\ncourt for the Northern District of California. They contended\nthat the USDA had failed to promulgate standards to “pro-\nmote the psychological well-being of primates” in violation of\nthe AWA, 7 U.S.C. § 2143(a), and that its failure constituted\nagency action “unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed”\nin violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). Plaintiffs sought\na declaratory judgment that the USDA was violating the\nAWA and the APA, as well as an order requiring the USDA\nto make a final decision with respect to the Draft Policy\nwithin 30 days.\n\n   In response, the USDA filed a declaration from Dr. Chester\nGipson, the Deputy Administrator for Animal Care at the\nUSDA’s Animal Plant Health Inspection Service. Dr. Gipson\nstated that, in his official capacity as Deputy Administrator,\nhe had made an oral announcement at a December 2002 con-\nference of industry and animal protection groups that the\n“USDA was not going forward with the Draft Policy . . . .”\nDr. Gipson declared that he had repeated this oral announce-\nment at a similar March 2003 conference.\n\n  The National Association for Biomedical Research\n(“NABR”), a non-profit organization representing universities\n\f               ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN             18749\nand other entities subject to the AWA, intervened in the suit\nunder Rule 24(b). The USDA, joined by the NABR, then\nmoved to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), contending, inter alia,\nthat Dr. Gipson’s announcements that the agency would not\ngo forward with the Draft Policy rendered the suit moot, and\nthat in any event plaintiffs lacked standing under Article III.\n\n   Plaintiffs then amended their complaint to add an alterna-\ntive claim, contending that Dr. Gipson’s oral statements con-\nstituted final agency action under 5 U.S.C. § 704. They\nalleged that this action was arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse\nof discretion in violation of 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), in that it “fails\nto articulate a basis for the agency’s decision that the [Draft]\nPolicy is no longer ‘necessary’ to fulfill the agency’s obliga-\ntions under the AWA and also fails to address any of the evi-\ndence and public comment demonstrating that the policy is\nnecessary to fulfill that statutory mandate.”\n\n   The district court granted the USDA’s motion to dismiss\nthe amended complaint. It concluded that the agency had no\nfurther duty to act after the D.C. Circuit held in Glickman II\nthat § 3.81 adequately discharged the USDA’s obligation\nunder the AWA. Hence, in the view of the district court, the\nUSDA’s failure to finalize the Draft Policy did not constitute\nan “unreasonable delay” in violation of APA § 706(1). The\ndistrict court also rejected plaintiffs’ § 706(2) claim that the\nrefusal to go forward with the Draft Policy had been arbitrary\nand capricious. It held that Dr. Gipson’s oral announcements\ndid not constitute a “definitive policy statement,” and conse-\nquently were not a reviewable “agency action” within the\nmeaning of § 706(2).\n\n  On appeal to us, plaintiffs primarily argue that the decision\nnot to go forward with the Draft Policy was a final “agency\naction” under § 704, and that the district court erred by dis-\nmissing the challenge to Dr. Gipson’s statements as unreview-\nable under § 706(2). In the alternative, they contend that the\nUSDA’s failure finally to decide the Draft Policy’s fate is an\n\f18750           ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nunreasonable delay within the meaning of § 706(1). The\nUSDA and the NABR contend that plaintiffs lack Article III\nstanding and that, if they have standing, their arguments under\nthe APA fail. Because the question of plaintiffs’ Article III\nstanding goes to our subject matter jurisdiction, we address it\nfirst.\n\n                            II.

VENEMAN             18751\nstanding under Article III. Buchanan is a “long-time volunteer\nand advocate for primates” with experience working with\nchimpanzees all over the world. Buchanan states that, begin-\nning in 2000, she has formed a “particularly close emotional\nattachment” to Terry, a chimpanzee housed at the Southern\nNevada Zoological-Botanical Park. Buchanan visits Terry\n“every other month” and states that she “will continue to do\nso” in the future. Since 1995, Buchanan declares, Terry has\nbeen housed alone, with no contact with other nonhuman pri-\nmates. Terry is “listless” and engages in species-atypical\nbehavior. The only time Buchanan has seen Terry animated\nis when his former trainer visits. When the trainer leaves,\n“Terry climbs up in his cage and watches the trainer’s car\nuntil it exits the parking lot.” Based on her expertise,\nBuchanan believes that Terry’s psychological health is deteri-\norating. She expressed her concern about Terry to the USDA\nin 2001. The agency responded that, while it “would prefer\nthat he have the companionship of another chimpanzee,” the\nzoo was in compliance with the AWA and § 3.81.\n\n   Buchanan complains that Terry’s environment and species-\natypical behavior injure her interests in observing and enjoy-\ning chimpanzees. She states that, if the Draft Policy were\nfinalized, it “would improve the psychological well-being of\nprimates including Terry, thereby reducing the level of abnor-\nmal, stereotypic and/or injurious behaviors exhibited by Terry\nand other primates whom . . . Buchanan enjoys observing and\nstudying in humane conditions.” The USDA argues that\nBuchanan’s asserted injury does not satisfy Article III. For the\nreasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n                      A.

VENEMAN\n“[T]he desire to use or observe an animal species, even for\npurely esthetic purposes, is undeniably a cognizable interest\nfor purpose of standing.” Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at\n562-63. The term “aesthetic” in ordinary usage refers to an\nartistic sense or a sense of beauty. Our Article III standing\njurisprudence gives the term “aesthetic injury” a broader\nmeaning that includes emotional injury. For example, in\nGlickman I, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiff — who had\nstated that the treatment of the chimpanzee had “upset” him\n“very much” — had suffered “aesthetic injury.” 154 F.3d at\n431, 433.\n\n   [3] Buchanan’s aesthetic injury is virtually indistinguish-\nable from the injury the D.C. Circuit found constitutionally\nsufficient in Glickman I. Like Buchanan, the Glickman I\nplaintiff asserted that he had suffered an “ ‘assault on [his]\nsenses’ ” and had been very upset when he viewed nonhuman\nprimates “living under inhumane conditions” during regular\nvisits to a particular zoo. 154 F.3d at 429-32. Like Buchanan,\nwhose many years of interest in chimpanzees underscore a\ndeep-seated concern for their health, the Glickman I plaintiff\nhad a long-term sustained interest in primate welfare, and had\npersonally visited and — more importantly — continued to\nvisit the animals whose condition caused him aesthetic injury.\nId. at 432. Hence, Buchanan, like the plaintiff in Glickman I,\nhas “alleged far more than an abstract, and uncognizable,\ninterest in seeing the law enforced.” Id.\n\n   The USDA urges us to disagree with the D.C. Circuit’s\nholding in Glickman I. It asks us to restrict Article III aes-\nthetic injury based on animal harm to situations where the\ndiminution or elimination of an animal species causes the\nalleged harm. This is precisely the argument made by the dis-\nsent in Glickman I. See 154 F.3d at 448 (Sentelle, J., dissent-\ning) (the “diminution-of-the-species” limit is necessary to\nkeep the “expanse of standing” from being “bounded only by\nwhat a given plaintiff finds to be aesthetically pleasing”).\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN            18753\n   The Glickman I majority expressly rejected this argument.\nSee 154 F.3d at 433 n.5. It is also inconsistent with our own\nprecedent. In Alaska Wildlife Alliance v.

Id. at 1068. A\nplaintiff who “expressed concern over [fishing] vessels’ dis-\nplacement of whales from preferred feeding areas and\ndescribed how she now plans her visits to the Park to avoid\nthe fishermen’s presence” also satisfied the injury-in-fact\nrequirement.

The injury at issue is not the animals’ but the\nhuman observer’s. The government fails to explain — as it\nfailed to explain in Glickman I — why knowing of a species’\ndiminution or extinction causes a more acute and objectively\ndemonstrable injury to a human than observing harm to an\nindividual animal. See 154 F.3d at 438. Although we appreci-\nate that aesthetic injury standing is not boundless, we con-\nclude that harm to a nonhuman primate creates a cognizable\ninjury-in-fact for someone with Buchanan’s level of engage-\nment with and appreciation for nonhuman primates.\n\n                   B.   Causal Connection\n\n   The second prong of the test for Article III standing\nrequires Buchanan to show a causal connection between her\ninjury and the USDA’s refusal to finalize the Draft Policy. Put\ndifferently, her injury must be “fairly traceable” to the agen-\n\f18754         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\ncy’s failure to act. Pritikin v.

Obvi-\nous causal links connect Terry’s suffering (and thus Buchan-\nan’s injury) to the USDA’s failure to adopt the Draft Policy.\nThe Draft Policy addresses several of the problems at Terry’s\nzoo that, according to Buchanan, render him listless and\nunhappy. For example, Buchanan complains that Terry’s lack\nof companionship adversely affects his psychological health.\nThe Draft Policy declares that, “[i]n order to address the\nsocial needs of nonhuman primates under § 3.81(a), the [zoo’s\nenvironmental enhancement] plan must provide for each pri-\nmate of a species known to be social in nature to be housed\nwith other primates whenever possible.” 64 Fed. Reg. at\n38147 (emphasis added). Although the Draft Policy would\nhave given regulated entities leeway to meet this requirement\nin different ways, the mandatory language would have elimi-\nnated their discretion to house primates in isolation when pos-\nsible to do otherwise. By contrast, without the Draft Policy\nclarifying § 3.81’s requirements, the USDA could freely give\nTerry’s zoo a clean bill of health when Buchanan complained\nin 2001. Terry’s suffering — and thus Buchanan’s injury —\nare fairly traceable to the fact that his zoo can operate in ways\nthat the Draft Policy likely would have restricted or elimi-\nnated.\n\n                      C.   Redressability\n\n   The final requirement for Article III standing is that the\nrelief Buchanan seeks in this suit redress her injury. Causal\n\f                ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                   18755\nconnection and redressability are two sides of the same coin.\nThe former assesses the relationship between the defendant’s\nconduct and the alleged injury, while the latter asks whether\nand how the requested relief would help.

Reg. at 38146. If Buchanan’s suit is\nsuccessful, and the USDA’s decision to abandon the Draft\nPolicy is set aside as arbitrary and capricious, the USDA\nwould either have to explain why the Draft Policy is no longer\n“necessary,” or would actually have to adopt it. If the agency\ncannot provide a satisfactory explanation and ultimately\nadopts the Draft Policy, the policy’s threat of penalty if its\nsafe harbor is ignored is likely to provide substantial incentive\nto comply with its terms.3\n\n   In some standing cases, a court has little more than com-\nmon sense to guide its determination whether the relief sought\nwill likely redress an injury. That is not so here. We are in the\nfortunate position of having an unambiguous statement by the\nregulated entities themselves that the relief Buchanan seeks\nwill likely alleviate Terry’s suffering. The NABR — which\n  3\n   Penalties for violation of § 3.81 and the AWA include revocation of\nfederal research funds, 8 U.S.C. § 2143(f), fines, id. § 2149(b), and, in\nsome instances, criminal penalties.

Legislative Rules, Interpretive Rules, and\n                         Policy Statements\n\n   In the usual case, a court must determine whether an agen-\ncy’s affirmative act constitutes final agency action for pur-\nposes of judicial review. Our task is different, for we must\ndetermine whether the USDA’s decision to abandon a course\nof action is reviewable.

Reviewability of the Draft Policy if Adopted\n\n   [11] A reviewable “agency action” includes an “agency\nrule.” 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).

If adopted,\nit would have constituted a “rule” within the meaning of\n§ 551(4).\n\n  [12] The term “rule” may embrace “virtually every state-\nment an agency may make,” Avoyelles Sportsmen’s League,\nInc. v.

To the contrary, even if the Draft Policy\nwere adopted, a regulated entity could still comply with\n§ 3.81 without following its specific recommendations for\nconditions of captivity.\n\n   [15] But neither would the finalized Draft Policy have been\na general policy statement — that is, a tentative declaration of\nhow the USDA might have enforced § 3.81 and the AWA.\nRather, it is best characterized as a proposed interpretive rule.\nThe Draft Policy would have summarized “what the [USDA]\nbelieve[d] must be considered and included” in an environ-\nmental enhancement plan. 64 Fed. Reg. at 38146 (emphasis\nadded). It would have provided categorically that entities that\n\f18764         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nfollow the specific terms of its safe harbor “will meet the\nrequirements of § 3.81.” Id. at 38146 (emphasis added). Com-\npare Am.

Cir. 2005).\n\n  2.   Reviewability of the Withdrawal of the Draft Policy\n\n   We now turn to the second part of our inquiry — whether\nthe USDA’s abandonment of the Draft Policy is judicially\nreviewable. This part of the inquiry raises two interrelated\nquestions. First, did the abandonment of a Draft Policy have\nlegal consequences or determine rights or obligations? Sec-\nond, does it make a difference that the USDA had no legal\nobligation to propose or adopt the Draft Policy in the first\nplace?\n\n  a.   Legal Consequences or Determination of Rights or\n                       Obligations\n\n   [18] The abandonment of a proposed rule such as the Draft\nPolicy leaves the status quo in place. But maintaining the sta-\ntus quo has legal consequences. Our decision in Defenders of\nWildlife v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774249\"><a href=\"/opinion/774249/defenders-of-wildlife-tucson-herpetological-society-horned-lizard/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2001), illustrates\nthis point. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) requires that\nthe Secretary of the Interior designate as “endangered” or\n“threatened” any species at risk of extinction. 16 U.S.C.\n§ 1532(6). The Secretary withdrew a proposed rule that would\nhave designated the flat-tailed horned lizard an endangered\nspecies, thereby leaving the status quo undisturbed. 258 F.3d\nat 1138-39. The consequences of leaving the status quo undis-\nturbed were obvious. Because it denied the flat-tailed horned\nlizard the protections afforded to endangered species by the\nESA, the Secretary’s decision, if incorrect, exposed the lizard\nto risk of extinction. We therefore reviewed the Secretary’s\ndecision.\n\n   It is clear that the Draft Policy would have determined\nrights and obligations of the regulated entities. A regulated\n\f18766         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nentity in doubt about its obligations under § 3.81 and the\nAWA would have known, after the adoption of the Draft Pol-\nicy, precisely what it could have done to ensure that it ful-\nfilled its obligations. Compliance with the safe harbor\nrequirements would have protected against adverse enforce-\nment actions by the USDA. Indeed, as we have been told by\nthe intervenor NABR, the Draft Policy would have had the\npractical consequence of strongly encouraging, perhaps even\nrequiring, regulated entities to comply with its terms. Thus, it\nclearly would have had a legal consequence if adopted.\n\n   [19] The converse is also true. Without the Draft Policy,\nthere is no safe harbor. As the Final Report indicated, the\npractical effect is that regulated entities have little incentive\nto change their behavior. Because the abandonment of the\nDraft Policy means that regulated entities will not change\ntheir behavior, the status quo remains undisturbed. The conse-\nquence is that harm to chimpanzees like Terry continues, and\naesthetic injury to individuals like Buchanan also continues.\n\n   Of course, the USDA may promulgate other Draft Policies\nin the future, as Dr. Gipson has suggested in his declaration\nit intends to do. For now, however, the agency’s last word is\nthat the Draft Policy is not necessary, with the effect that the\nDraft Policy has been abandoned, and that the status quo\nremains unchanged. See Fox, 280 F.3d at 1038.\n\n  b.    USDA Had No Obligation to Act in the First Place\n\n   The conclusion that the failure to adopt the Draft Policy\nhad legal consequence is not necessarily the end of the\ninquiry. The USDA relies on the D.C. Circuit’s decision in\nGlickman II, which held that § 3.81 adequately discharged the\nUSDA’s rulemaking obligation under the AWA. Because it\nhad no statutory duty to propose the Draft Policy in the first\nplace, the USDA argues, its decision to abandon the policy is\nunreviewable. We disagree.\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN             18767\n   We do not question the conclusion of the D.C. Circuit in\nGlickman I. Because § 3.81 passed muster standing on its\nown, the USDA’s decision to propose the Draft Policy was\nnot compelled by the AWA. “An agency’s discretionary deci-\nsion not to regulate a given activity is inevitably based, in\nlarge measure, on factors not inherently susceptible to judicial\nresolution, e.g., internal management considerations as to\nbudget and personnel; evaluations of its own competence;\nweighing of competing policies within a broad statutory\nframework.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at 1046. Moreover, “even if an\nagency considers a particular problem worthy of regulation, it\nmay determine for reasons lying within its special expertise\nthat the time for action has not yet arrived.” Id. Judicial\nsecond-guessing of such decisions triggers concerns of over-\nreaching, particularly when the agency has already deemed\nthe regulation unworthy of adoption. Id. at 1045.\n\n   [20] Nonetheless, courts have reviewed, albeit highly defer-\nentially, the withdrawal of proposed rules like the Draft Pol-\nicy. An example is Center for Auto Safety v. National\nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420899\"><a href=\"/opinion/420899/center-for-auto-safety-v-national-highway-traffic-safety-administration/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\nCir. 1983). A statute provided that the National Highway and\nTraffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) “ ‘may by rule . . .\namend the average fuel economy standard . . . to a level which\n[it] determines is the maximum feasible average fuel economy\nlevel . . . .’ ” Id. at 844 (quoting 15 U.S.C. § 2002(a)(4))\n(emphasis added). The agency refused to finalize a proposed\nregulation that would have tightened fuel economy standards\nfor certain cars. Noting the reasons the NHTSA gave for with-\ndrawing its proposed regulation, the court concluded that\n\n    [t]hese statements accompanying the withdrawal of\n    the [proposed rule] clearly interpret the relevant stat-\n    ute and indicate NHTSA’s policy regarding the exer-\n    cise of discretion granted to it by that legislative\n    enactment. Given our prior decisions construing the\n    Administrative Procedure Act’s broad definition of\n    “rule,” we are compelled to conclude that NHTSA\n\f18768         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n    has prescribed a rule sufficient to grant this court\n    jurisdiction . . . .\n\nId. at 846. In other words, the retreat to the status quo as the\nagency’s policy was reviewable, even though the statute at\nissue, by using the term “may,” allowed the agency the choice\nwhether to engage in rulemaking in the first place.\n\n   The D.C. Circuit’s decision in Professional Drivers Coun-\ncil v. Bureau of Motor Carrier Safety, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418109\"><a href=\"/opinion/418109/professional-drivers-council-john-torbet-and-david-gaibis-v-bureau-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C.\nCir. 1983), is also instructive. There, the agency withdrew a\nproposed amendment to an existing rule that specified hours-\nof-service requirements for commercial truck drivers. The\ndecision to withdraw the proposed rule did not take place\nagainst a legal obligation to act:\n\n    This is not a situation where the agency has shirked\n    its statutory duty by refusing to regulate. The agency\n    has regulated the field. In this instance, the agency’s\n    statutory authority to regulate is permissive. The\n    statute provides that the agency “may establish rea-\n    sonable requirements.” The permissive nature of the\n    statute implies broad agency discretion in selecting\n    the appropriate manner of regulation.\n\nId. at 1221. The D.C. Circuit recognized the limited scope of\njudicial inquiry into this sort of agency decisionmaking:\n\n    The circumscribed scope of this review is dictated by\n    both the nature of the administrative proceeding\n    (informal rulemaking) and by the nature of the ulti-\n    mate decision (not to promulgate rules). The record\n    in an informal rulemaking proceeding is a less than\n    fertile ground for judicial review . . . . Furthermore,\n    rulemaking is an inherently policy-oriented process\n    and the agency must be accorded considerable defer-\n    ence in evaluating information presented and reach-\n    ing decisions based upon its expertise. Our review is\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18769\n    also circumscribed by the fact that the agency\n    decided not to promulgate new rules in an area\n    already heavily regulated.\n\nId. at 1220-21 (internal quotation omitted) (emphasis added).\nNonetheless, the court in the end reaffirmed its authority to\nexercise judicial review. It gave effect to the agency’s interest\nin having relatively unfettered power to decide whether to\nadopt rules not by abandoning its reviewing authority alto-\ngether but by exercising a highly deferential standard of\nreview. See id.\n\n   Finally, International Union, United Mine Workers of\nAmerica v. United States Department of Labor demonstrates\nthat once an agency has embarked on a course of action, even\na discretionary course of action, a court may review the agen-\ncy’s failure to explain its subsequent abandonment of that\ncourse of action. There, the D.C. Circuit reviewed the with-\ndrawal of a proposed Air Quality rule by the Mine Safety and\nHealth Administration (“MSHA”) after a public hearing and\ncomment period. 358 F.3d at 41-42. The D.C. Circuit\nexplained that while the MSHA was under no obligation to\nadopt the proposed rule, “or, for that matter, any rule,” it was\nnot “free to terminate the rulemaking for no reason whatsoev-\ner.” Id. at 43-44 (quotation marks omitted). The D.C. Circuit\nreviewed the withdrawal of the proposed rule under the\nAPA’s “deferential ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard,” stat-\ning that it would “give more deference to an agency’s deci-\nsion to withdraw a proposed rule than we give to its decision\nto promulgate a new rule or to rescind an existing one.” Id.\nat 43. Despite this heightened deference, the D.C. Circuit held\nthat the withdrawal was arbitrary and capricious because the\nMSHA’s explanations — that “there was a ‘change in agency\npriorities,’ ” the record was stale, and a recent Eleventh Cir-\ncuit opinion cast doubt on the proposed rule — were inade-\nquate. Id. at 44-45.\n\n  [21] The D.C. Circuit has offered two helpful criteria to\ndetermine when the withdrawal of a voluntarily proposed rule\n\f18770         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nmay be amenable to at least a “minimal level of judicial scru-\ntiny.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at 1047. The agency must have “held\na rulemaking proceeding,” and it must have “compiled a\nrecord narrowly focused on the particular rules suggested but\nnot adopted.” Id. In NRDC, the D.C. Circuit explained that the\nconcern that a court may improperly oblige an agency to\nspend resources defending a withdrawn rule is diminished\nwhen the agency has undertaken extensive rulemaking pro-\nceedings before it abandons a proposed rule. Id. at 1045-46.\nSuch activity “evidences [the agency’s] view that the propos-\nals are sufficiently meritorious to warrant further investigation\n. . . .” Id. at 1046. Having solicited public participation, the\nprospect of judicial review would also force the agency to\ngive due regard to citizen input. Id. Moreover, concerns over\na court’s lack of institutional competence are lessened to the\ndegree that the pre-withdrawal rulemaking proceeding has\nbeen extensive and has thereby provided more data to the\nreviewing court. Id. at 1047.\n\n   In essence, the criteria help to distinguish between two\nclasses of cases, one ordinarily reviewable and the other not\nreviewable. In the first class, an agency undertakes an action\n— for example, promulgation of a Draft Policy — but subse-\nquently changes course and abandons that action. Properly\napplied, the criteria ensure that a sufficient record exists for\na court to identify a discrete change of course, and to review\nthe change of course to determine whether it was arbitrary and\ncapricious. Id. at 1046-47; see also Fox, 280 F.3d at 1037\n(“There is no question [an agency] determination not to repeal\nor to modify a rule, after giving notice of and receiving com-\nment upon a proposal to do so, is a final agency action subject\nto judicial review.”).\n\n   In the second class of cases, an agency simply declines to\ntake any action at all. Absent a particular statutory mandate\nthat the agency act, these cases are considered presumptively\nunreviewable in part because courts lack a “focus for judicial\nreview . . . to determine whether the agency exceeded its stat-\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN            18771\nutory powers.” Heckler v. Chaney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 832 (1985);\nsee also id. at 834, 838. Courts have no means to choose\nbetween the “infinite number of rules that an agency could\nadopt in its discretion,” NRDC, 606 F.2d at 1046, other than\nundertaking the “complicated balancing of a number of fac-\ntors” ordinarily considered to be “peculiarly within [the agen-\ncy’s] expertise.” Chaney, 470 U.S. at 831. The D.C. Circuit’s\nanalysis in NRDC is fully consistent with the Supreme\nCourt’s later decision in Chaney, for NRDC concerned an\nabandonment of a course of action whereas Chaney concerned\na mere failure to act.\n\n   [22] We endorse and apply the D.C. Circuit’s criteria in\nNRDC. Both are satisfied here, and thus this case falls within\nthe class of reviewable cases. The USDA gave notice by pub-\nlishing the Draft Policy in the Federal Register on July 15,\n1999, and it solicited comments from the public. Plaintiffs\nallege that, by the time the comment period ended on October\n13, 1999, see 66 Fed. Reg. 61327, 61364 (Dec. 3, 2001), the\nagency had received more than 200 sets of comments. More-\nover, the comments solicited were to address the “content of\nthe draft policy,” and thus focused narrowly on the proposed\nrule. 64 Fed. Reg. at 38147.\n\n                        C.   Summary\n\n   [23] The USDA’s decision to abandon the Draft Policy is\ndefinitive and final. By leaving the status quo in place, the\nUSDA gives regulated entities no incentive to adopt environ-\nmental enhancement plans that comply with a set of standards\nthe agency at one time deemed “necessary” for the effective\nimplementation of § 3.81. The USDA held rulemaking pro-\nceedings before it abandoned the Draft Policy and therefore\nassembled a record amenable to judicial review. We therefore\nconclude that the abandonment of the Draft Policy constitutes\na final agency action for the purposes of § 706(2).\n\f18772         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n                         Conclusion\n\n   We conclude that plaintiff Buchanan has standing under\nArticle III based on the aesthetic injury she has described. We\nfurther conclude that the USDA’s withdrawal of the Draft\nPolicy constitutes final agency action that is reviewable pur-\nsuant to § 706(2) of the APA. We therefore reverse the district\ncourt’s dismissal of this case. On remand, the district court\nshall determine whether the USDA’s withdrawal of the Draft\nPolicy was arbitrary and capricious in violation of § 706(2) of\nthe APA.\n\n  REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\n\n\nKOZINSKI, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n   In holding that we can review withdrawal of proposed reg-\nulations an agency had no duty to adopt, my colleagues over-\nlook the sea-change in administrative law wrought by Heckler\nv.

See The Supreme Court—Leading Cases:\nJudicial Review of Agency Inaction, 99 Harv. L. Rev. 264,\n269 (1985) (hereafter “Judicial Review of Agency Inaction”)\n(“Chaney represents a significant departure from the trend of\nrecent administrative law.”). Failure to appreciate the funda-\nmental distinction between agency action and inaction perme-\nates every aspect of the majority’s analysis, starting with the\nthreshold question of standing.\n\n                          Standing\n\n   1. The majority wastes much toner trying to show that\nUSDA’s Draft Policy at issue here would, if adopted, amelio-\nrate the conditions plaintiffs complain about. Maj. op. at\n18754-57. Even if this were true, which it is not, see pp.\n\f                 ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                     18773\n18774-77 infra, it doesn’t matter. In determining whether\nplaintiffs have standing, the question is not whether the agen-\ncy’s proposed action would have benefitted them, but whether\nthis lawsuit will do so. The Draft Policy only matters if the\ncourt can order, or at least move the agency towards, its adop-\ntion.\n\n   Certainly we cannot order USDA to adopt the Draft Policy.1\nNo court I am aware of has ever ordered an agency to adopt\na particular regulation, and for good reason.2 Adoption of reg-\nulations is an executive function that no court has authority to\nperform. Even where the agency is required by law to act, and\na court finds that it failed to do so, the court cannot tell the\nagency what regulation to adopt; rather, it must remand for\nfurther action. See, e.g., Envtl. Def. Ctr., Inc. v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783666\"><a href=\"/opinion/783666/environmental-defense-center-inc-natural-resources-defense-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">832</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 863 (9th Cir. 2003); Defenders of Wildlife v.

In such cases it\ncan at least be said that the court nudged the agency towards\na result favorable to the plaintiffs by correcting the agency’s\nmisinterpretation of the statute and thus narrowing its discre-\ntion. But the agency here has no duty to act; it fully dis-\ncharged its statutory responsibility by adopting the regulations\napproved by the DC Circuit. See Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc.\nv.

When an agency adopts regulations that turn\nout to be contrary to law, a court can order the agency to set them aside.\nSee, e.g., Ecology Ctr., Inc. v.

This is concrete relief that will benefit the plaintiff directly (pre-\nsuming he can show that he would be injured by adoption of the regula-\ntions). A court can grant no commensurate relief when a party complains\nof an agency’s failure to adopt a discretionary regulation.\n   2\n     Whether one views the proposed policy as an interpretive regulation or\na safe harbor, there is no doubt that, once adopted, the policy would tie\nthe agency’s hands. Those who comply with the policy will be entitled to\ncount on it if the agency attempts to bring an enforcement action in the\nfuture. See, e.g., Cmty. Nutrition Inst. v.

Adoption of the regulation thus has consequences\nfar beyond the immediate parties to the dispute.\n\f18774            ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nII”). The most we can do is tell the agency that its reason for\nrejecting the Draft Policy is insufficient. See maj. op. at\n18772. This won’t ensure that the agency will adopt the Draft\nPolicy or narrow its discretion in any meaningful way. The\nagency is free to open up the proceedings for further com-\nment, adopt a different policy, or again reject the policy, this\ntime giving better reasons.3\n\n   I suppose that plaintiffs could then bring another lawsuit\nand we could, once again, disapprove the agency’s reasons.\nBut no matter how often the kabuki is repeated, it can never\ngive plaintiffs what they want—an order that materially limits\nthe agency’s discretion to reject the Draft Policy. This is\nbecause the agency has no legal duty to act, and there is thus\nno law we can bring to bear in narrowing its discretion. The\nagency can refuse to adopt the Draft Policy again and again,\nciting reasons of policy and convenience that we may not\nsecond-guess. See pp. 18778-83 infra. Plaintiffs are pushing\na long and very limp string, and no matter how hard they try,\nthey can never get the object at the far end to move.\n\n   2. Let’s assume, nevertheless, that plaintiffs could obtain\nan order forcing the agency to adopt the Draft Policy. Would\nthe policy, if adopted, redress their injuries, as that term is\nunderstood in our standing jurisprudence?

Wright\nheld that plaintiffs had no standing to challenge the tax\nexempt status of segregated private schools because there was\nno assurance the schools would desegregate out of fear of los-\ning their exemptions. 468 U.S. at 758-59. In applying these\nprecedents we have held that an injury is not redressed if any\nbenefit to plaintiffs is “conditioned on the discretionary\nbehavior of any third party.” Fernandez v. Brock, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502339\"><a href=\"/opinion/502339/refugio-fernandez-maria-fernandez-individually-and-on-behalf-of-others/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 627 (9th Cir. 1988).\n\n   Of course, if the third party has no choice, its response is\nnot discretionary and may provide a basis for standing. But\nthis is only so if the regulation in question is sufficiently coer-\ncive. Maj. op. at 18756. The Draft Policy here is not coercive;\nit is, as the majority recognizes, a “safe harbor.” See id. at\n18747, 18748, 18755, 18756, 18764, 18766. Entities that\nhouse primates need not follow the Draft Policy; they may\nlawfully choose alternate means of statutory compliance. If\nfear of incarceration in Linda R.S. and loss of tax benefits in\nAllen v. Wright were insufficiently coercive to give plaintiffs\nthere standing, I don’t see how a wholly permissive regime—\none that expressly allows for alternate means of compliance—\ncan give these plaintiffs standing.\n\n   The majority mistakenly relies on the representation of the\nintervenor, the National Association for Biomedical Research\n(NABR). NABR takes this view, however, based on its inter-\npretation of the Draft Policy as mandatory—a position the\nmajority correctly rejects. Maj. op. at 18763. Once we have\ndetermined that the Draft Policy is merely a safe harbor,\nNABR’s members will be free, just like everyone else, to\nabide by the policy or not, as they see fit. Certainly, nothing\nNABR has said in this litigation can bind its members to fol-\n\f18776         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nlow the policy, should it be implemented. Because there is no\nway of knowing whether any particular facility will comply,\nplaintiffs cannot show that they will benefit from the policy\nbecause the facilities they are concerned with may not.\n\n   What intervenor says doesn’t matter anyhow, because it\ncannot speak—nor does it purport to speak—for all facilities\nthat house primates. “NABR is an association of more than\n300 universities, colleges, medical schools, veterinary\nschools, research institutes, research companies, and pharma-\nceutical manufacturers, as well as individual biomedical\nresearchers, engaged in the care and use of animals in\nbiomedical research.” Yet the single example on which the\nmajority bases standing involves Terry, a chimpanzee housed\nin a zoo. Zoos differ from the research-industry entities that\nmake up NABR’s membership. They’re typically cash-\nstrapped non-profit organizations with significant public sup-\nport in the local community. They need not fear that sensitive\nand expensive research projects will be disrupted if they fall\nout of compliance. Their risk calculus might be quite different\nfrom that of organizations represented by NABR. The South-\nern Nevada Zoological-Botanical Park where Terry is housed,\na facility already certified by USDA as compliant, may well\nchoose not to comply with the Draft Policy.\n\n   But let’s assume, for the sake of argument, that Terry’s zoo\ndid feel it had to follow the Draft Policy. I don’t see how we\ncan be sure that such compliance would ameliorate Buchan-\nan’s injury. The gravamen of her complaint is that Terry is\nlonely because he is housed by himself. The majority con-\ncludes that compliance with the Draft Policy would alleviate\nTerry’s suffering, pointing to the following language: “[i]n\norder to address the social needs of nonhuman primates under\n§ 3.81(a), the [zoo’s environmental enhancement] plan must\nprovide for each primate of a species known to be social in\nnature to be housed with other primates whenever possible.”\nMaj. op. at 18754 (quoting Draft Policy on Environmental\nEnhancement for Nonhuman Primates, 64 Fed. Reg. 38,145,\n\f                 ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                     18777\n38,147 (proposed July 15, 1999)) (alterations in original). The\nmajority zooms in on “must” but gives no effect to “whenever\npossible.” It also overlooks the language that exempts facili-\nties from this requirement if there is “[d]ocumented unavaila-\nbility of compatible individuals.” 64 Fed. Reg. at 38,147. In\nother words, the zoo must only house Terry with another\nchimpanzee if it has another chimpanzee to house him with.\nBuchanan could easily have alleged that Terry’s zoo had a\ncompatible primate, but she didn’t. For all we know—for all\nthe record reflects—Terry is the only chimp at the Southern\nNevada Zoological-Botanical Park, or the zoo may have other\nchimps that can’t be moved without disruption to themselves\nor their current companions. Even if the zoo believed it\nneeded to comply with the Draft Policy, it could do so by doc-\numenting the unavailability of another compatible animal. To\nconclude that Buchanan has established standing is to make\nspeculation the hallmark of redressability.4\n  4\n    The majority also claims plaintiffs’ injuries would be redressed\nbecause forcing the agency to provide “a rationale for not going forward\nwith the Draft Policy could influence [USDA’s] decision.” Maj. op. at\n18757. The majority lifts this “procedural redressability” theory from our\nNEPA case law, but NEPA is a statute that spells out procedural require-\nments designed to influence the agency’s decision-making process. The\ninjury thus arises when the agency makes a decision without complying\nwith those procedures. For example, in Citizens for Better Forestry v. U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783377\"><a href=\"/opinion/783377/citizens-for-better-forestry-the-ecology-center-gifford-pinchot-task-force/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">961</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2003), on which the\nmajority relies, plaintiffs claimed that the agency had published a national\nforest management policy that “was not accompanied by any environmen-\ntal or endangered-species analysis,” and “did not entertain comments\nregarding the rule’s environmental impact.” Id. at 967. Because the agency\nbypassed statutory procedures designed to influence its deliberations, we\nheld that plaintiffs need not show that the agency would make a different\ndecision, had the procedures been followed; it was sufficient that the pro-\ncedures could influence the decision-making process. Plaintiffs here can\npoint to no statutory requirement that the agency bypassed by withdrawing\nthe Draft Policy without comment. The procedural redressability theory\nhas no application where there is no procedural requirement the agency\nfailed to comply with.\n\f18778         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n                        Reviewability\n\n   1. The majority concludes that the agency’s failure to\nadopt the Draft Policy is reviewable because the Draft Policy\nitself, if adopted, would have been reviewable. Maj. op. at\n18765-66. This doesn’t follow; adoption and nonadoption of\nregulations are asymmetrical events. Regulations change the\nlaw, and thus can sharply affect the legal interests of private\nparties. Failure to adopt regulations leaves rights and respon-\nsibilities unchanged; it leaves the status quo in place. See\nKennecott Utah Copper v. U.S Dep’t of the Interior, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721439\"><a href=\"/opinion/721439/kennecott-utah-copper-corporation-v-united-states-department-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1207 (D.C.

Because parties are not entitled to an agen-\ncy’s discretionary regulation, they can’t claim to be aggrieved\nwhen the agency fails to adopt it.\n\n   When an agency adopts regulations, a court can judge\nwhether those regulations are consistent with the agency’s\ngrant of authority (under the broad limits of Chevron USA\nInc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 844-45 (1984)), and whether they constitute an abuse of\ndiscretion.

But an agency may choose not to\nadopt discretionary regulations for a variety of reasons, many\nof which a court can’t review: a change in policy; a lack of\nenforcement resources; a lack of scientific expertise to\naddress the problem at this time; a change in direction based\non a determination that the problem is better addressed some\nother way. All of these matters are, in the words of the\nAdministrative Procedure Act, “committed to agency discre-\ntion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). There is nothing for a\ncourt to review.\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18779\n   There was a time when the Supreme Court (like the major-\nity here) disdained the distinction between agency action and\ninaction. See, e.g., Rochester Tel. Corp. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103198\"><a href=\"/opinion/103198/rochester-tel-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143 (1939). But the Court turned its back on this\ncaselaw in Heckler v. Chaney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111383\"><a href=\"/opinion/111383/heckler-v-chaney/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), which\nheld that an agency’s decision not to act is, under ordinary cir-\ncumstances, unreviewable.\n\n   Chaney involved death row inmates who claimed that the\nFDA had shirked its duty by failing to prevent states from\nusing drugs for lethal injections. According to the inmates,\nthese drugs had not been proven “safe and effective” for use\nin human executions, as required by the applicable statute. Id.\nat 824. In rejecting this contention, the Court closely exam-\nined the text of the APA, and concluded that an agency’s fail-\nure to act is insulated from judicial review in two\ncircumstances. First, under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), an agency\ndecision may not be judicially reviewed “when Congress has\nexpressed an intent to preclude judicial review.” 470 U.S. at\n830. Neither here nor in Chaney is this provision applicable.\nBut the Court went on to hold that judicial review is also pre-\ncluded under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) where “no judicially man-\nageable standards are available for judging how and when an\nagency should exercise its discretion.” 470 U.S. at 830. The\nCourt held that an agency’s discretionary decision not to\nenforce a statute—even though it has the authority to do so—\nis unreviewable.\n\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court noted that the agen-\ncy’s decision not to exercise its enforcement powers is “gen-\nerally committed to [its] absolute discretion.” Id. at 831. This,\nthe Court said, “is attributable in no small part to the general\nunsuitability for judicial review of agency decisions to refuse\nenforcement.” Id. “The reasons for this general unsuitability,”\nthe Court continued, “are many.” Id. Among them, the Court\nlisted the following:\n\n    [T]he agency must not only assess whether a viola-\n    tion has occurred, but whether agency resources are\n\f18780            ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n      best spent on this violation or another, whether the\n      agency is likely to succeed if it acts, whether the par-\n      ticular enforcement action requested best fits the\n      agency’s overall policies, and, indeed, whether the\n      agency has enough resources to undertake the action\n      at all. . . .\n\n         In addition to these administrative concerns, we\n      note that when an agency refuses to act it generally\n      does not exercise its coercive power over an individ-\n      ual’s liberty or property rights, and thus does not\n      infringe upon areas that courts often are called upon\n      to protect. Similarly, when an agency does act to\n      enforce, that action itself provides a focus for judi-\n      cial review, inasmuch as the agency must have exer-\n      cised its power in some manner. The action at least\n      can be reviewed to determine whether the agency\n      exceeded its statutory power.\n\nId. at 831-32.\n\n   While Chaney spoke directly to an agency’s enforcement\nactions, its teachings sweep more broadly. Regulations impli-\ncate precisely the same concerns addressed in Chaney; one\ncan properly view the adoption—or non-adoption—of regula-\ntions as an enforcement decision.5 In adopting regulations, the\nagency implements the mandate of its governing statute by\ncoercing the conduct of private parties. Regulations channel\nthe agency’s enforcement efforts and commit agency\nresources to a particular interpretation of the statute. A deci-\nsion to promulgate regulations, just like a decision to enforce,\namounts to an exercise of agency authority, which “at least\ncan be reviewed to determine whether the agency exceeded its\nstatutory powers.” Id. at 832. Failure to adopt discretionary\n  5\n   Indeed, part of the relief sought by the inmates in Chaney was that the\nagency “adopt procedures for seizing the drugs from state prisons.” 470\nU.S. at 824.\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18781\nregulations, by contrast, may reflect considerations besides\nthe applicable statute, such as a change in policy, a lack of\nresources, a decision to pursue a different course of action or\na decision to gather additional information before acting.\nSuch failure to adopt cannot normally be tested against the\napplicable statute, because it may be based on non-statutory\nconsiderations of policy and convenience that are within the\nagency’s inherent authority.\n\n   The failure to adopt regulations, like failure to enforce, may\nbe reviewed in certain narrow circumstances. The first, and\nmost common, is where the agency has a legal duty to act. Id.\nat 832-35. The typical such case is where Congress has\ndirected the agency to take a particular regulatory action—\nsuch as listing species as endangered. See Defenders of Wild-\nlife v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774249\"><a href=\"/opinion/774249/defenders-of-wildlife-tucson-herpetological-society-horned-lizard/\"><span class=\"volume\">258</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1137-38 (9th Cir. 2001); see\nalso Greater L.A.

The second is where the\nagency refuses to act based solely on a belief that it lacks\njurisdiction. Chaney, 470 U.S. at 833 n.4; see, e.g., Transpa-\ncific Westbound Rate Agreement v. Fed. Mar. Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564892\"><a href=\"/opinion/564892/transpacific-westbound-rate-agreement-and-asia-north-america-eastbound/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1026-27 (9th Cir. 1991) (“The Commission’s\norder declined jurisdiction over parts of shipping agreements\nthat regulate wholly foreign transportation. . . . Instead, the\nCommission held that it had jurisdiction only over the United\nStates-foreign portion of the agreements.”). The third is where\nthe agency’s refusal to act violates constitutional rights.\nChaney, 470 U.S. at 838. Finally, a court might have jurisdic-\ntion where “the agency has ‘consciously and expressly\nadopted a general policy’ that is so extreme as to amount to\nan abdication of its statutory responsibilities.” Id. at 833 n.4\n(quoting Adams v. Richardson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"312132\"><a href=\"/opinion/312132/kenneth-adams-v-elliot-l-richardson-individuallyand-as-secretary-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir.\n1973) (en banc)).\n\n   None of these exceptions apply. There is certainly no claim\nthat the agency believed it lacked jurisdiction to adopt the\nDraft Policy. Nor is there any suggestion that the agency abdi-\ncated its statutory responsibilities or violated constitutional\n\f18782            ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\nrights. And, most significantly, we know for a fact that the\nagency had no statutory duty to act because the DC Circuit\nfound the regulations the agency had adopted sufficient.\nGlickman II, 204 F.3d at 235. The agency need do no more.\nAdoption of the Draft Policy was an entirely discretionary\ndecision, one the agency could choose to eschew based on a\nvariety of non-legal considerations.\n\n   The majority remands for a determination “whether the\nUSDA’s withdrawal of the Draft Policy was arbitrary and\ncapricious in violation of § 706(2) of the APA,” maj. op. at\n18772, but does not say how that determination can be made.\nThe implication seems to be that review should be on the\nrecord of the rulemaking proceedings. Id. at 40. But it’s not\nclear why this should be so. Absent a statutory duty to act, an\nagency need not adopt regulations, even if all public com-\nments submitted favor them (which is certainly not the case\nhere). The agency may decide not to adopt regulations\nbecause of a change in administrations, or some other change\nin policy.6 Or, the agency may decide to withdraw a proposed\nregulation in response to a change in law.7 The agency might\n  6\n     Withholding proposed regulations that are final but for publication in\nthe Federal Register seems to be common when there is a change in\nadministrations.

The majority’s opinion casts serious doubt on this venera-\nble practice.\n   7\n     This appears to be what happened here. The agency proposed the Draft\nPolicy in response to the district court’s ruling in Animal Legal Defense\nFund, Inc. v. Glickman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2376716\"><a href=\"/opinion/2376716/animal-legal-defense-fund-inc-v-glickman/\"><span class=\"volume\">943</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

After that ruling was\nreversed, see Glickman II, 204 F.3d at 235, the agency no doubt deemed\nthe Draft Policy unnecessary.\n\f                 ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                     18783\nalso choose a different path.8 An agency’s decision not to pro-\nceed with a regulation—just like a decision not to enforce—\ncan properly be based on a variety of judicially unreviewable\nconsiderations.\n\n   The majority’s implication that withdrawal of the policy\nmust be justified by the public comments is alarming. It locks\nan agency into a course of action—a course it cannot aban-\ndon, unless it be for reasons a court finds sufficient on the\nadministrative record. This not only improperly constrains\nagency discretion under Chaney, it discourages agencies from\nproposing discretionary regulations, lest they be stuck with\nthem if they cannot convince a federal court that the record\nsupports abandonment. If this was ever the law, it’s certainly\nnot the law today.\n\n  The majority relies on several cases from the DC Circuit,\nsee maj. op. at 18766-71, but those cases have been overtaken\nby Chaney.9 Indeed, the case on which my colleagues princi-\npally rely, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v.

Dr. Gipson, in his statement,\nnoted as follows: “USDA and NIH had agreed to develop best manage-\nment practice guidelines concerning nonhuman primates.”\n   9\n     The majority also relies on a post-Chaney case from the DC Circuit,\nInternational Union, United Mine Workers of America v. U.S. Department\nof Labor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186139\"><a href=\"/opinion/186139/intl-un-united-mine-v-labr/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 2004), but the case is inapposite. Con-\ntrary to the majority’s assertions, International Union is not a case where\nthe agency was embarking on a “discretionary course of action.” Maj. op.\nat 18769. Rather, the agency there was acting pursuant to a statutory obli-\ngation imposed by the Mine Safety and Health Act, which states that\n“[t]he Secretary shall . . . develop, promulgate, and revise . . . improved\nmandatory health or safety standards for the protection of life and preven-\ntion of injuries in coal or other mines.” 30 U.S.C. § 811(a) (emphasis\nadded); see also 358 F.3d at 41. As already noted, when an agency has an\nobligation to act, its failure to do so is reviewable. See pp. 18773, 18780-\n81 supra. International Union says nothing whatsoever about the situation\npresented here, where the agency has no obligation to act.\n\f18784           ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v.

Even on its own terms, the majority is wrong. Assum-\ning standing, assuming reviewability, assuming the cases the\nmajority relies on are still good law, judicial review is still not\njustified. The majority extracts from the DC Circuit cases two\nrequirements for reviewing non-adoption of a regulation and\nfinds both satisfied. Maj. op. 18769-71. In fact, there are two\nadditional requirements. First, the agency’s regulatory process\nmust have come to an end. See Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Nat’l\nHighway Traffic Safety Admin., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"420899\"><a href=\"/opinion/420899/center-for-auto-safety-v-national-highway-traffic-safety-administration/\"><span class=\"volume\">710</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 847-48 (D.C.\nCir. 1983) (action not ripe if the agency “has left open the\npossibility that the agency will initiate new rulemaking pro-\nceedings at some point in the future”). Second, the agency\nmust have “explained in detail its reason for not adopting\nthose rules.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at 1047. Neither requirement is\nsatisfied here.\n\n   a. It is perfectly clear that the agency’s decision-making\nprocess has not come to rest. Dr. Gipson’s announcement that\nthe rulemaking had been terminated adds as follows: “USDA\nand NIH had agreed to develop best management practice\nguidelines concerning nonhuman primates.” The agency has\nnot abandoned its effort to give further guidance as to the\nmanagement of primates. Rather, it has shifted focus toward\nother means of implementing that objective.\n  10\n    While Justice Marshall’s opinion is styled a concurrence, he vigor-\nously dissented from the majority’s central holding that an agency’s deci-\nsion not to enforce is presumptively non-reviewable. 470 U.S. at 853-55\n(Marshall, J., concurring).”\n\f                 ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN                     18785\n   In Center for Auto Safety, on which the majority relies, the\nagency terminated rulemaking, but “left open the possibility\nthat the agency [would] initiate new rulemaking proceedings\nat some point in the future.” 710 F.2d at 847 (emphasis\nadded). Because the agency still “ha[d] a chance . . . to\namend” its existing regulations, the DC Circuit concluded that\njudicial review of the refusal to do so at that time would have\n“entangl[ed] [the courts] in abstract disagreements over\nadministrative policies.” Id. at 848 (quoting Abbott Labs. v.\nGardner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107451\"><a href=\"/opinion/107451/abbott-laboratories-v-gardner/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">136</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 148 (1967)). Here we have not\nmerely a possibility that the agency will resume the regulatory\nprocess at some unspecified future time; we know it’s doing\nso now. If review was premature in Center for Auto Safety, it\nis previable here.11\n\n   The majority’s ruling also conflicts with Ecology Center,\nInc. v. United States Forest Service, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766297\"><a href=\"/opinion/766297/ecology-center-inc-v-united-states-forest-service-an-agency-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">922</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 926 (9th\nCir. 1999), which held that the monitoring of forest activity\nwas not reviewable. The Forest Service there published\nreports that were not interlocutory or tentative, but the moni-\ntoring itself was one of the “steps leading to an agency deci-\nsion, rather than the final action itself.” Id. at 925. Thus, it did\nnot “mark the consummation of the agency’s decision making\nprocess,” id., and review was premature. Here, Dr. Gipson’s\ndeclaration is not the end point of the agency’s decision mak-\ning, but only a step along the way. It is no more reviewable\nthan the reports in Ecology Center.\n  11\n    Action may be final even if some degree of uncertainty lingers. But\nthe majority cites no case reviewing a policy currently undergoing trans-\nformation. In Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547458\"><a href=\"/opinion/547458/her-majesty-the-queen-in-right-of-ontario-ian-g-scott-qc-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1525</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1532 (D.C. Cir. 1990), the court found that the agency’s statement\nwas “devoid of any suggestion that it might be subject to subsequent revi-\nsion.” Here, of course, USDA’s primate policy is still up in the air. Like-\nwise, in American Petroleum Institute v. EPA, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"543708\"><a href=\"/opinion/543708/american-petroleum-institute-v-united-states-environmental-protection/\"><span class=\"volume\">906</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 739-40 (D.C.\nCir. 1990) (per curiam), the possibility of “unforeseen amendments” did\nnot render the decision unripe. Here, the change in policy is not only fore-\nseeable; it’s in progress.\n\f18786           ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n   Review of interlocutory agency statements hopelessly\nentangles the judiciary in the administrative process. The\nagency here cannot have two policies on the same issue: It\ncan either adopt something like the Draft Policy, or it can\nadopt best management practice guidelines like the ones it is\nnow considering. By allowing this lawsuit to proceed, the\nmajority leaves open the possibility that the agency will be\nforced or coaxed into adopting the Draft Policy.12 Even if the\nagency prevails before the district court, further agency pro-\nceedings will be delayed at least until the next appeal—which\nmay be years away. Until this lawsuit is over, the agency can-\nnot implement best practice guidelines, which may take the\nagency in a different direction from the Draft Policy. The\nmajority thus interferes with the agency’s ongoing consider-\nation of a live issue.\n\n   b. The majority ignores an additional requirement in the\nDC Circuit case law—that the agency “explain[ ] in detail its\nreasons for not adopting those rules.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at\n1047.\n\n   In the cases the majority cites, see maj. op. at 18766-71, the\nagencies all provided reasons a court could evaluate. NRDC,\nthe cornerstone of the majority’s argument, involved “lengthy\nexplanatory statements,” id. at 1039, that the DC Circuit\nrepeatedly referenced in affirming the agency’s decision. Id.\nat 1058-59, 1061-62. In Professional Drivers Council v.\nBureau of Motor Carrier Safety, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"418109\"><a href=\"/opinion/418109/professional-drivers-council-john-torbet-and-david-gaibis-v-bureau-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">706</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir.\n1983), the agency published its reasons for terminating its\nrulemaking, id. at 1220, and the DC Circuit upheld the agency\nby reviewing the “relevant, permissible factors” upon which\nthe agency relied. Id. at 1222. In Center for Auto Safety, the\nagency also published its reasons for withdrawing the policy,\n  12\n     As I note above, we have no way of doing this. See pp. 18773-74\nsupra. But the agency can’t be sure until the litigation comes to an end.\nIt must therefore delay implementation of best practice guidelines so long\nas litigation over the Draft Policy continues.\n\f              ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN              18787\n710 F.2d at 844, but the court never reached the issue. See p.\n18785 supra. And in International Union, the agency pro-\nvided three reasons, which the court then reviewed. 358 F.3d\nat 44.\n\n   By contrast, the agency here hasn’t provided a detailed\nexplanation as to why it abandoned the Draft Policy, or any\nreason at all. We have only Dr. Gipson’s announcement that\n“the USDA was not going forward with the Draft Policy on\nEnvironmental Enhancement for Nonhuman Primates.” With-\nout an explanation for the agency’s refusal to adopt the Draft\nPolicy, it is impossible to determine whether its decision is\narbitrary or capricious. Even if we assume that the agency did\nso for reasons contained in the record, we don’t know what\nthose reasons are. Judicial review would thus “have an unde-\nsirably abstract and hypothetical quality.” NRDC, 606 F.2d at\n1047.\n\n   What are the district judge and the parties to do on remand?\nThe judge can certainly review the record for comments sup-\nporting and opposing the Draft Policy, but how is he to deter-\nmine which of them are legitimate and which aren’t? What\nweight is he to give the various arguments? Considering and\nweighing public comments, then deciding whether to adopt,\nreject or modify a proposed rule is a quintessentially adminis-\ntrative function. It calls for the kind of expertise a district\njudge does not have and the kind of policy judgment a district\njudge is not competent to make. It is simply not a judicial\nfunction. Reviewing an agency decision where there is no\nagency decision to review is much like making ham and eggs\nwithout ham or eggs. It is precisely for this reason that the DC\nCircuit cases on which the majority relies require an explicit\nand detailed statement of reasons from the agency as a condi-\ntion for judicial review. By ignoring this crucial requirement,\nthe majority sends the parties and the district court on a fool’s\nerrand.\n\n                           *   *   *\n\f18788         ANIMAL LEGAL DEFENSE v. VENEMAN\n   The majority expands the law of standing beyond recogni-\ntion. It unmoors administrative law from sound principles of\njudicial review, and insinuates the federal courts into sensitive\npolicy judgments that are the exclusive province of the Exec-\nutive Branch. It ignores the teachings of the Supreme Court\nand misapplies the precedents it relies on. It will cause no end\nof mischief. Count me out.\n\f</pre>",
