Akers filed a motion to\n 2   substantively consolidate the estate of debtors, Lippung and\n 3   Varathip Aroonsakool, with non-debtor entities Thai Export, LLC\n 4   (TE) and Luxury Jewels, LLC (LJ).         The   bankruptcy court found\n 5   that the requirements for substantive consolidation articulated\n 6   in Alexander v. Compton (In re Bonham), 229 F.3d 750 (9th Cir.\n 7   2000) were met and ordered the substantive consolidation nunc\n 8   pro tunc to debtors’ petition date.         LJ appeals from this order.\n 9   Finding no error, we AFFIRM.\n10                                  I.   FACTS\n11   A.       Prepetition Facts\n12            1.   Debtors’ Jewelry Business\n13            For many years, debtors owned and operated a family jewelry\n14   business.      Debtors’ sons, Nimit and Nakon, and their daughter,\n15   Tarrah, worked at the business as did Loxunipan Pomsavanh (Lox)\n16   and her brother, Tanasin “Bo” Panusith (Bo), who were part of\n17   the Aroonsakool household.2     In February 2007, debtors entered\n18   into a seven-year lease at the Grove Plaza Shopping Center\n19   (Grove Plaza) in National City, California, where they operated\n20   their jewelry business named TE.\n21            In January 2010, Hieu, Inc. filed a complaint against TE\n22   alleging breach of contract for debtors’ failure to return\n23\n24        1\n          Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n   references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532.\n25 “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n26 Procedure and “Civil Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of\n   Civil Procedure.\n27\n        2\n          Both Lox and Bo lived with debtors for many years but were\n28 not their biological children.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f 1   jewelry items.    In June 2010, Hieu obtained a judgment against\n 2   TE and proceeded to collect its judgment by placing a keeper at\n 3   the Grove Plaza store.    In October 2010, Lox accepted service on\n 4   behalf of TE for placement of a keeper.    Donald Jaffee, counsel\n 5   for LJ in this matter, filed a third party claim in the case on\n 6   behalf of TE and submitted the declaration of Varathip in\n 7   opposition to the keeper.    The declaration, signed under penalty\n 8   of perjury, stated that the market value of the property at the\n 9   Grove Plaza store was $1 million and that TE had been denied\n10   access to its records.    Ultimately, Jaffee represented TE in a\n11   settlement between Hieu and TE.\n12        Tax Returns for the year 2010 show that TE had a beginning\n13   2010 inventory value of $677,725 and end of year 2010 inventory\n14   value of $650,580.    At some point in 2010, TE went out of\n15   business.\n16        2.     LJ Is Formed And Opened For Business\n17        On January 4, 2011, LJ was formed.    Lox is the sole owner\n18   and managing member of LJ.\n19        Twenty days prior to debtors’ bankruptcy filing, Lox was\n20   added as an additional tenant to the Grove Plaza lease based on\n21   representations from debtors that she was going to operate the\n22   store as her own business.    At that time, Lox submitted an\n23   application to the landlord containing information about her\n24   financial condition.    Lox stated that she was a current employee\n25   of TE, held the position of manager, and that her salary was\n26   $24,000 a year.    Lox listed assets valued at $10,000, but at the\n27   same time stated that she would spend $250,000 to acquire\n28\n\n                                     -3-\n\f 1   inventory for her business.3    Later, in a deposition conducted\n 2   in connection with the substantive consolidation motion at issue\n 3   in this appeal, Lox explained away these facts by testifying\n 4   that she made them up.\n 5           Lox then proceeded to open LJ for business.   A few days\n 6   before the landlord received notice of debtors’ bankruptcy\n 7   filing, the TE store sign was removed and a new sign installed\n 8   changing the name of the business to LJ.4    During the pendency\n 9   of the bankruptcy, the lease was amended to reflect Lox as the\n10   sole tenant and guarantor of the lease as of June 1, 2011.      The\n11   record evidence shows LJ used the same computers, database,\n12   furniture, fixtures, and equipment that TE had used.      LJ also\n13   used the same business forms and invoices that TE had used and,\n14   in many cases, the name of TE was crossed out on the form and\n15   the name of LJ substituted.     As in the case of TE, workers at LJ\n16   included Lox, Nimit, and Nakon.     Nakon and Nimit both testified\n17   that they “helped out” at LJ.     Further, another employee who was\n18   a jeweler worked at TE and then worked at LJ.\n19           Lox admitted that TE left some jewelry at the Grove Plaza\n20   store when it closed down, including brass, stainless steel and\n21   silver items.     In deposition testimony, Lox claimed that the\n22\n23\n         3\n          Lox listed Varathip as a reference in her application,\n24 stating that Varathip was her mother.\n25       4\n          According to the record, Nimit contacted Best Sign Company\n26 to create a sign for a “new company” in January 2011. Trustee\n   alleges that the “new company” was LJ, but in opposition to\n27 trustee’s motion for summary judgment (MSJ) (described in further\n   detail below), Nimit allegedly intended to open a company by the\n28 name of Coast Gem USA, LLC.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f 1   remaining jewelry located at the Grove Plaza store was hers and\n 2   came from an entity called 99 Jewelry owned by her and her\n 3   brother Bo which operated between 2001 and 2005.       However, the\n 4   record also indicates Varathip owned 50% of 99 Jewelry as\n 5   represented in a credit application for Mercedes-Benz.       Lox\n 6   testified that when 99 Jewelry shut down in 2006, she stored the\n 7   jewelry in a safe deposit box at Union Bank.       The record reveals\n 8   that Union Bank was unable to identify a safe deposit box in the\n 9   name of LJ or Lox.5\n10            Moreover, the record contains no evidence that LJ or Lox\n11   paid anything to debtors or TE for the business or the jewelry\n12   other than Lox’s testimony that she paid TE for the computer,\n13   furniture, safe and fixtures which were at the Grove Plaza\n14   store.      Although Lox testified that she never borrowed money\n15   from anyone for the purpose of opening or operating LJ, her own\n16   testimony shows that she did not have the financial wherewithal\n17   to purchase any of TE’s assets.       Contrary to the financial\n18   information that she gave Grove Plaza when she was added to the\n19   lease, she testified that prior to December 2010, she was not\n20   employed anywhere other than as a caretaker for her grandmother\n21   since 2000.      Although she received $800-900 a month from the\n22   state or federal government to care for her grandmother, Lox\n23   testified that she received no other income.\n24   B.       Bankruptcy Events:   Procedural History\n25            On April 28, 2011, debtors filed a chapter 7 petition.\n26\n          5\n27        Bo also declared that his purchase and storage of jewelry\n   from 99 Jewelry was placed with LJ for sale, but trustee did not\n28 take his deposition.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f 1   Akers was appointed the trustee.       At the time of their filing,\n 2   debtors owed over $1.3 million in unsecured debt.\n 3           Debtors stated in their petition that they formerly did\n 4   business as TE.     Under personal property in Schedule B, they\n 5   listed TE as 70% owned by them jointly and described:\n 6           Wife owns 50%, Husband owns 20%, three children each\n             own 10%. Consignment based jewelry business. Imports\n 7           and exports jewelry from Thailand to USA. Neither Debtors\n             nor business have ownership interest in jewelry sold.\n 8           Debtors ceased operatio[n] (sic).\n 9   Debtors assigned a value of 0.00 to TE.      Debtors listed\n10   creditors who held judgments against TE alone or against both TE\n11   and debtors in Schedule F.6\n12           Prior to the initial meeting of creditors, a listed\n13   creditor, Saif Siddiqui of Americans/Gold/Diamonds, contacted\n14   trustee advising him that debtors were continuing to operate the\n15   jewelry store through their children to “defraud creditors” and\n16   that the “new” company existed at the same location (Grove\n17   Plaza) with the same employees.     Siddiqui also stated that he\n18   spoke to other vendors with smaller debts and that they were\n19   being paid with checks issued by LJ to pay debts owed by TE.\n20           1.   Trustee’s Lockdown Of The Grove Plaza Store\n21           At the § 341(a) meeting of creditors on May 26, 2011,\n22   debtors testified that all of the inventory of TE was\n23   consignment jewelry of undisclosed wholesale sellers or other\n24   jewelry proprietors and, prior to the bankruptcy filing, all\n25   jewelry inventory of TE had been returned to the consigning\n26\n         6\n27        We take judicial notice of debtors’ petition and\n   schedules. Atwood v. Chase Manhattan Mortg. Co. (In re Atwood),\n28 293 B.R. 227, 233 n.9 (9th Cir. BAP 2003).\n\n                                      -6-\n\f 1   parties.      There is no documentation in the record showing that\n 2   all the jewelry located at the Grove Plaza store was consigned —\n 3   although some of it was — nor is there any documentation showing\n 4   that the jewelry was returned to the consigning parties.\n 5            On the same day, without the benefit of a court order,\n 6   trustee locked down the Grove Plaza store to protect the assets\n 7   for the benefit of creditors.\n 8            2.   The Adversary Complaint\n 9            Less than a month later, on June 20, 2011, trustee filed an\n10   adversary complaint against LJ, Lox, and the Aroonsakool\n11   children (Nimit, Nakon and Tarrah) seeking declaratory and\n12   injunctive relief and alleging claims for turnover and to avoid\n13   and recover fraudulent transfers.       Trustee sought a declaration\n14   that the jewelry at the Grove Plaza store was property of\n15   debtors’ estate.7\n16            LJ and Lox filed answers to the complaint and a\n17   counterclaim against trustee for damages arising from trustee’s\n18   seizure of the business.      In November 2011, LJ and Lox filed an\n19   amended counterclaim alleging claims against trustee for\n20   violation of duties, conversion, trespass and fraud, and seeking\n21   declaratory and injunctive relief.      A year later, in November\n22\n          7\n23          On September 29, 2011, trustee moved to sell the personal\n     property at the Grove Plaza store. LJ and Lox opposed,\n24   contending that the personal property was not part of the\n     bankruptcy estate and that an adversary proceeding was required.\n25   In November 2011, the bankruptcy court denied trustee’s motion on\n26   the grounds that it could not allow a sale of property as\n     “property of the estate” without first determining whether the\n27   debtor in fact owned the property, see Moldo v. Clark\n     (In re Clark), 266 B.R. 163, 172 (9th Cir. BAP 2001), and noted\n28   that trustee had an adversary proceeding pending.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f 1   2012, trustee entered into an agreement with LJ, Lox, Bo and\n 2   Grove Plaza, LP, which settled, among other things, the\n 3   counterclaim.        In exchange for Grove Plaza, LP withdrawing its\n 4   bankruptcy claim, trustee’s insurer paid Grove Plaza, LP $23,500\n 5   for unpaid rent and LJ $110,000 in damages.8       In December 2012,\n 6   the counterclaim was dismissed.\n 7                   a.   Motion For Summary Judgment\n 8                   On December 4, 2011, trustee filed a MSJ seeking\n 9   judgment on all claims alleged in the complaint as a matter of\n10   law.        Trustee argued that debtors and TE were alter egos because\n11   debtors did not observe any corporate formalities as shown by\n12   the undisputed evidence.        He further maintained that the\n13   transfers of TE’s property to LJ were avoidable as fraudulent\n14   transfers as a matter of law.\n15              In opposition to the MSJ, Nimit submitted a declaration\n16   stating that “[n]one of the assets of Thai Export were in any\n17   way transferred to Luxury . . . [Lox] was the owner of Luxury\n18   and I saw her purchasing inventory for Luxury and I assisted in\n19   purchasing inventory for Luxury, using Luxury funds.”        Debtors\n20   each submitted declarations stating that at the time of their\n21   bankruptcy filing, there was no property owned by them at the\n22\n23\n            8\n          It appears that after trustee locked down the premises, he\n24 discovered that $10,000 worth of the jewelry actually belonged to\n   LJ. Moreover, trustee held jewelry that was on layaway or in for\n25 repairs. However, trustee continued to maintain that the total\n26 value of jewelry at the store was $150,000. LJ argues in its\n   reply brief on appeal that trustee’s settlement is evidence that\n27 trustee seized property which did not belong to the bankruptcy\n   estate. Therefore, according to LJ, the bankruptcy court should\n28 not have ordered substantive consolidation.\n\n                                         -8-\n\f 1   Grove Plaza store.   They further declared that the only jewelry\n 2   left was costume brass jewelry that was on consignment from\n 3   Micron, a vendor in Thailand.\n 4        In January 2013, the bankruptcy court denied the MSJ,\n 5   noting that under the holdings in In re Wheeler, 444 B.R. 598,\n 6   607-10 (Bankr. D. Idaho 2011) and In re Wardle, 2006 WL 6811026\n 7   (9th Cir. BAP 2006), trustee’s request to treat the assets of a\n 8   non-debtor entity as the debtor’s assets for purpose of bringing\n 9   those assets into the bankruptcy estate, or to obtain standing\n10   to assert fraudulent conveyance theories as to transfers of the\n11   non-debtor’s assets, is tantamount to a request for substantive\n12   consolidation.   The court observed that trustee’s complaint had\n13   not pled “reverse veil piercing” or “substantive consolidation”\n14   theories, nor had he filed a motion for substantive\n15   consolidation.   However, the bankruptcy court noted that the\n16   adversary proceeding had not yet gone to trial and, given the\n17   strength of trustee’s evidence that TE was operated as a sole\n18   proprietorship and that LJ was a sham, the court denied\n19   trustee’s MSJ without prejudice.      The court gave trustee thirty\n20   days to amend his complaint or take whatever actions he deemed\n21   necessary to place the issues properly before the court.\n22             b.     Motion For Substantive Consolidation\n23             On February 22, 2013, trustee filed a motion to\n24   substantively consolidate debtors’ estate with non-debtors, TE\n25   and LJ, or, alternatively, for leave to file an amended\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                     -9-\n\f 1   complaint.9    In support, trustee submitted more than a hundred\n 2   pages of exhibits and other evidence intended to show that\n 3   debtors and TE disregarded corporate formalities and that LJ\n 4   used the same premises, furniture, fixtures, and showcases\n 5   previously used by TE without paying TE or debtors a dime.      In\n 6   addition, trustee included evidence that showed TE and LJ used\n 7   the same forms for jewelry consignments and invoices and other\n 8   matters, changing only the names on the forms.      Finally, trustee\n 9   maintained that creditors of debtors, TE and LJ dealt with the\n10   entities as a single economic unit.\n11           On March 11, 2013, the date opposition was due, LJ filed an\n12   ex parte application for a four-day extension of time to respond\n13   to trustee’s motion.     It argued that:   the motion was\n14   “voluminous” with more than a hundred pages of exhibits and\n15   declarations; the pleading actually contained two motions - the\n16   motion for substantive consolidation and a motion to amend; the\n17   motion was in breach of the settlement agreement between trustee\n18   and LJ on the counterclaim asserted in the complaint; and\n19   counsel for LJ was engaged in post-trial proceedings in state\n20   court which had a due date of March 8, 2013.      In a supporting\n21   declaration, Jaffee declared that he had been seriously ill from\n22   March 8, 2013, to the date of the filing of the request for\n23   continuance.\n24           Trustee filed a limited opposition.   Trustee maintained\n25   that the motion for substantive consolidation did not violate\n26\n         9\n27        The motion was filed in the adversary proceeding. Notice\n   was given to creditors listed on the creditor’s matrix and also\n28 to creditors of TE and LJ.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f 1   the settlement agreement and noted that the exhibits submitted\n 2   in support of the motion were the same as those filed in\n 3   connection with trustee’s MSJ.    In addition, if the bankruptcy\n 4   court granted LJ’s extension of time, trustee requested a\n 5   three-day extension to file his reply.\n 6        On March 13, 2013, the bankruptcy court denied the\n 7   application because LJ’s requested extension of time, followed\n 8   by a concomitant request for extension of time by trustee to\n 9   reply, left the court with an unacceptably brief period of time\n10   to prepare for the motion.\n11        Despite the bankruptcy court’s denial order, LJ filed an\n12   opposition to trustee’s motion on March 15, 2013.    LJ’s\n13   opposition contained no substantive arguments.    In oral argument\n14   before this court, Jaffe maintained that he could not assert any\n15   substantive arguments because the bankruptcy court had denied\n16   his request for a continuance.    Instead, LJ asserted in\n17   opposition that a continuance should have been granted and that,\n18   by not allowing the extension, it appeared the bankruptcy court\n19   was going out of its way to assist trustee.10    LJ further argued\n20   that any amendment to the complaint would be prejudicial due to\n21   the passage of time.   Finally, LJ complained that trustee had\n22   failed to include an amended complaint.\n23        On April 9, 2013, the bankruptcy court issued a tentative\n24\n25       10\n          To the extent Jaffe implies that the court’s denial of\n26 his motion for a continuance evidences bias, this argument has no\n   merit. Adverse rulings by themselves do not constitute the\n27 requisite bias necessary to warrant recusal of a judge even if\n   the rulings were erroneous. United States v. Nelson, 718 F.2d\n28 315, 321 (9th Cir. 1983).\n\n                                      -11-\n\f 1   ruling granting trustee’s motion for substantive consolidation.\n 2   In the tentative, the court recited the Bonham factors, applied\n 3   them to the facts based on the evidence before it, and found\n 4   substantive consolidation was warranted.     At the April 11, 2013\n 5   hearing on the matter, the bankruptcy court adopted its\n 6   tentative and directed counsel for trustee to file detailed\n 7   findings of fact and conclusions of law (FFCL).\n 8        On April 25, 2013, LJ filed a notice of appeal.    On May 17,\n 9   2013, the bankruptcy court entered the FFCL and on May 23, 2013\n10   entered the order granting trustee’s motion.    On May 31, 2013,\n11   LJ filed an amended notice of appeal.11\n12                           II.   JURISDICTION\n13        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over this proceeding\n14   under 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1) and (b)(2)(A).    We now address our\n15   jurisdiction over this appeal.\n16        Orders denying a motion for a continuance are generally\n17   interlocutory.   “Unlike final orders, interlocutory orders\n18   decide merely one aspect of the case without disposing of the\n19   case in its entirety on the merits.”    See United States v. Real\n20   Prop. Located at 475 Martin Ln., Beverly Hills, Cal., 545 F.3d\n21   1134, 1141 (9th Cir. 2008).   “A court’s ruling on a motion to\n22   continue does not end the litigation.”    Roque v. Ynguez\n23   (In re Roque), 2014 WL 351424, at 5* (9th Cir. BAP 2014).\n24   Nonetheless, an interlocutory order such as the order denying a\n25\n         11\n26        Subsequently, trustee obtained court orders authorizing\n   him to employ an auctioneer and sell the personal property. The\n27 jewelry and other personal property was sold at auction for\n   $123,306.96. LJ appealed the court’s ruling authorizing the sale\n28 of the personal property in BAP No. 13-1539.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f 1   motion to continue merges into the final order deciding the\n 2   merits.    Real Prop. Located at 475 Martin Ln., Beverly Hills,\n 3   Cal., 545 F.3d at 1141 (interlocutory orders entered prior to\n 4   the judgment merge into the judgment and may be challenged on\n 5   appeal).    Accordingly, the continuance order merged into the\n 6   final order granting trustee’s motion for substantive\n 7   consolidation.    As such, it can be challenged on appeal.         See\n 8   Disabled Rights Action Comm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc., 375 F.3d\n 9   861, 872 n.7 (9th Cir. 2004) (appeal of final judgment draws\n10   into question all earlier, non-final orders and rulings which\n11   produced the judgment).\n12        With respect to the substantive consolidation order, the\n13   Clerk’s Office issued an Order re Finality, requiring LJ to file\n14   a response regarding the finality of the order.         After LJ\n15   responded, although the order appears final, the Panel granted\n16   LJ leave to appeal to the extent it was necessary.         Therefore,\n17   we are satisfied that we have jurisdiction to decide this appeal\n18   under 28 U.S.C. § 158.\n19                                III.    ISSUES\n20        A.     Whether the bankruptcy court abused its discretion by\n21   denying LJ’s ex parte application for an extension of time to\n22   file its opposition; and\n23        B.     Whether the bankruptcy court erred by granting\n24   trustee’s motion to substantively consolidate the estate of\n25   debtors with the non-debtor entities TE and LJ nunc pro tunc.\n26                         IV.   STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n27        The bankruptcy court’s denial of an extension of time is\n28   reviewed for abuse of discretion.          Orr v. Bank of Am., 285 F.3d\n\n                                         -13-\n\f 1   764, 783 (9th Cir. 2002).    The court abuses its discretion if it\n 2   applied the wrong legal standard or its findings were illogical,\n 3   implausible or without support in the record.\n 4   TrafficSchool.com, Inc. v. Edriver Inc., 653 F.3d 820, 832 (9th\n 5   Cir. 2011).\n 6        Application of the factors for substantive consolidation in\n 7   Bonham to the underlying facts presents a mixed question of law\n 8   and fact, where factual determinations are reviewed under the\n 9   clearly erroneous standard, and determinations of law are\n10   reviewed de novo.   See Meyer v. Lepe (In re Lepe), 470 B.R. 851,\n11   855 (9th Cir. BAP 2012) (citing Andrews v. Loheit\n12   (In re Andrews), 155 B.R. 769, 770 (9th Cir. BAP 1993)); see\n13   also Murray v. Bammer (In re Bammer), 131 F.3d 788, 792 (9th\n14   Cir. 1997).\n15        We review for abuse of discretion a bankruptcy court’s\n16   entry of a nunc pro tunc approval of a motion.   In re Bonham,\n17   229 F.3d at 764.\n18                               V.   DISCUSSION\n19   A.   The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Err In Denying LJ’s Request\n          For An Extension Of Time\n20\n21        LJ’s main argument on appeal is that the bankruptcy court’s\n22   error in denying its request for an extension of time to file\n23   opposition to trustee’s motion warrants reversal of the\n24   consolidation order.   According to LJ, the bankruptcy court\n25   should have granted its request under the holding in Ahanchian\n26   v. Xenon Pictures, 624 F.3d 1253 (9th Cir. 2010) which discusses\n27   the standards for extension requests under Civil Rule 6(b)(1).\n28   There, the Ninth Circuit held that requests for extensions of\n\n                                       -14-\n\f 1   time made before the applicable deadline has passed should\n 2   normally be granted in the absence of bad faith or prejudice to\n 3   the adverse party.   LJ asserts that there is no evidence it\n 4   acted in bad faith nor would there have been prejudice to\n 5   trustee had the continuance been granted.\n 6        We have previously noted that the standards in Ahanchian\n 7   are not applicable to requests for an extension of time:\n 8        A careful reading of the Bankruptcy Rules shows that\n          Civil Rule 6(b)(1) does not apply in adversary\n 9        proceedings. Unlike many other Civil Rules, the Rules\n          do not incorporate Civil Rule 6. Instead, portions of\n10        Civil Rule 6 are adopted via Rule 9006, which governs,\n          generally, “enlargement” of time periods. And while\n11        some of the language of Civil Rule 6(b)(1) is similar\n          to that in Rule 9006(b), the provisions of Civil\n12        Rule 6(b)(1) establishing the “good cause” standard\n          for granting extensions of time are not adopted in the\n13        Rules.\n14   N. Cal. Small Bus. Fin. Dev. Corp. v. Arnold Bellow\n15   (In re Bellow), 2011 WL 4502916, at *5 (9th Cir. BAP 2011),\n16   aff’d, In re Bellow, 544 Fed.Appx. 732 (9th Cir. 2013).    Because\n17   Rule 9006(b) controls all motions for extensions of time in the\n18   bankruptcy courts (whether made in an adversary proceeding or\n19   not), Civil Rule 6(b)(1) standards for extensions of time do not\n20   apply.   Therefore, LJ’s reliance on Ahanachian is misplaced.\n21        Rule 9006(b)(1) states that a bankruptcy court may at any\n22   time in its discretion enlarge the time period in which an act\n23   is required or allowed to be done.    A bankruptcy court has\n24   substantial discretion to control its own calendar.    Danjaq LLC\n25   v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 960–61 (9th Cir. 2001).    Four\n26   factors are relevant to our inquiry into whether the court\n27   abused its discretion in denying a continuance:    (1) whether the\n28   requesting party has been diligent; (2) whether there is a\n\n                                    -15-\n\f 1   genuine need for the continuance; (3) whether the continuance\n 2   will inconvenience the Court and the opposing party including\n 3   its witnesses; (4) whether the requesting party will suffer\n 4   prejudice if the request is denied.    Absent a showing of\n 5   prejudice suffered by LJ, we will not disturb the bankruptcy\n 6   court’s ruling.   Danjaq, 263 F.3d at 961; see also Berry v. U.S.\n 7   Trustee (In re Sustaita), 438 B.R. 198, 210-11 (9th Cir. BAP\n 8   2010), aff’d, 460 Fed. Appx. 627 (9th Cir. 2011).\n 9        LJ points to no prejudice arising from the denial of its\n10   request for an extension of time other than a generalized\n11   assertion that had the bankruptcy court allowed the short\n12   extension of time, it would have been able to present the court\n13   with the facts and arguments against ordering the substantive\n14   consolidation of LJ with debtors.     This vague allegation is not\n15   adequate to satisfy the prejudice requirement.    See United\n16   States v. LaRouche, 896 F.2d 815, 825 (4th Cir. 1990) (observing\n17   that “[m]ore than a general allegation of ‘we were not prepared’\n18   is necessary to demonstrate prejudice”).    Indeed, on appeal LJ\n19   identifies no arguments it would have made had it more time to\n20   prepare nor does it rebut trustee’s evidence with its own offer\n21   of proof.\n22        At oral argument, the Panel questioned counsel for LJ about\n23   how its arguments or evidence would differ from that presented\n24   in opposition to trustee’s MSJ.   Counsel maintained that the\n25   evidence in opposition to substantive consolidation would be\n26   “significantly different” from evidence submitted in opposition\n27   to the MSJ.   This argument is not persuasive.   Trustee’s MSJ\n28   raised the issue of whether debtors and TE were alter egos.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f 1   Alter ego doctrine and substantive consolidation overlap when\n 2   the second factor under Bonham is at issue.    “Entanglement can\n 3   be shown where there is a unity of interest and common ownership\n 4   between the debtor and the target entities, the target entities\n 5   were ‘but instrumentalities of the bankrupt with no separate\n 6   existence,’ there was commingling of assets and no clear\n 7   demarcation between the affairs of the debtor and the target\n 8   entities, and adhering to the separate corporate entities theory\n 9   would result in an injustice to the bankrupt’s creditors.”\n10   Sharp v. Salyer (In re SK Foods, Ltd.), 499 B.R. 809, 833-34\n11   (Bankr. E.D. Cal. 2013) (citing In re Bonham, 229 F.3d at 767).\n12   Thus, the presence of traditional “alter ego” factors may\n13   provide a basis to find that the affairs of the debtor are so\n14   entangled such that consolidation will benefit all creditors.\n15   In re SK Foods, 499 B.R. at 833 (citing Meruelo Maddux\n16   Props.–760 S. Hill Street, LLC v. Bank of Am., N.A.\n17   (In re Meruelo Maddux Props., Inc.), 667 F.3d 1072, 1075 n.1\n18   (9th Cir. 2012) (“Appellate courts have ratified substantive\n19   consolidation orders when, for example, the debtors have abused\n20   corporate formalities, or creditors have treated the separate\n21   entities as a single unit and the business affairs of the\n22   consolidated entities were hopelessly entangled.”).\n23        In addition, two of the other three factors in Danjaq weigh\n24   against LJ.   The record shows that the requested extension would\n25   not have served any legitimate need of LJ.    In opposing\n26   trustee’s MSJ, LJ submitted the testimony of Lox to support its\n27   ownership claim to the jewelry.   However, in concluding that\n28   substantive consolidation was warranted, the bankruptcy court\n\n                                    -17-\n\f 1   relied on trustee’s evidence which impeached Lox’s credibility\n 2   as a witness.   There is no indication in the record or in LJ’s\n 3   brief on appeal that an extension of time would have assisted LJ\n 4   in refuting the trustee’s evidence to support its ownership\n 5   claim.   Further, the bankruptcy court specifically found that an\n 6   extension of time would be inconvenient for the court as it\n 7   would not have adequate time to prepare.    Under these\n 8   circumstances, LJ was not prejudiced and we will not disturb the\n 9   court’s ruling denying its request for an extension of time.\n10   B.   The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Err When It Granted the\n          Substantive Consolidation Motion Nunc Pro Tunc\n11\n12        Substantive consolidation is an uncodified, equitable\n13   doctrine allowing the bankruptcy court, for purposes of the\n14   bankruptcy, to “combine the assets and liabilities of separate\n15   and distinct—but related—legal entities into a single pool and\n16   treat them as though they belong to a single entity.”\n17   In re Bonham, 229 F.3d at 764.    The doctrine “enables a\n18   bankruptcy court to disregard separate corporate entities, to\n19   pierce their corporate veils in the usual metaphor, in order to\n20   reach assets for the satisfaction of debts of a related\n21   corporation.”   Id.   The essential purpose behind the doctrine\n22   is one of fairness to all creditors, but it is a doctrine to be\n23   used sparingly.   Id. at 764, 768.\n24        In Bonham, the Ninth Circuit adopted a disjunctive two-\n25   factor test for determining whether application of the\n26   substantive consolidation doctrine is warranted.    In applying\n27   the test, courts consider whether creditors dealt with the\n28   entities as a single economic unit and did not rely on their\n\n                                      -18-\n\f 1   separate identity in extending credit or whether the affairs of\n 2   the debtor are so entangled that consolidation will benefit all\n 3   creditors.    229 F.3d at 766.   “In either case, the bankruptcy\n 4   court must in essence determine that the assets of all of the\n 5   consolidated parties are substantially the same.”     Bonham,\n 6   229 F.3d at 771.    Ultimately, the decision to apply the\n 7   substantive consolidation doctrine stems from a weighing of the\n 8   equities and must be tailored to meet the needs of each\n 9   particular case.    Id.\n10        Trustee, as the moving party, has the initial burden of\n11   showing either one of the Bonham factors are met.     Reider v.\n12   Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. (In re Reider ), 31 F.3d 1102, 1107\n13   (11th Cir. 1994).    Once trustee establishes a close\n14   interrelationship between debtors and the non-debtor entities,\n15   there is a presumption that creditors did not rely on their\n16   separate credit.    The burden of proof then shifts to the parties\n17   opposing substantive consolidation to show otherwise.     Bonham,\n18   229 F.3d at 767.\n19        We begin by reviewing the evidence regarding the\n20   interrelationship between debtors and TE.     At the outset, we\n21   observe that there is some question whether TE had a signed and\n22   dated operating agreement; there was no agreement in the\n23   record.12    Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that TE\n24\n25       12\n          Cal. Corp. Code § 17701.10 entitled “Operating agreement;\n26 scope; limitations, variations, and modifications; fiduciary\n   duty; indemnification and damages” provides:\n27\n        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the\n28                                                       continue...\n\n                                      -19-\n\f 1   ever held formal meetings, took minutes or conducted an election\n 2   of officers.   The record also establishes that TE was never\n 3   capitalized by debtors or debtors’ children, who were also\n 4   listed as members of TE.   Further, although family members\n 5   testified13 that they “helped out” at TE, the evidence shows that\n 6   they were not paid as employees.    Even debtors did not receive\n 7   any wages, or guaranteed payments from TE, per their 1040 tax\n 8   returns.   These facts, which are not contested, show that\n 9   debtors operated TE as a sole proprietorship and, with no source\n10   of any other income, took money from the business as needed,\n11   treating the assets as their own.\n12        The line of corporate separateness between TE and LJ is\n13   more blurry.   As noted by the bankruptcy court, LJ was formed\n14   when debtors/TE were facing litigation and post-judgment\n15   collection activities from creditors.   Moreover, as the record\n16   indicates, LJ was in reality simply a continuation of TE’s\n17\n18        12\n           ...continue\n19       operating agreement governs all of the following:\n\n20       (1) Relations among the members as members and between\n         the members and the limited liability company.\n21\n22       (2) The rights and duties under this title of a person\n         in the capacity of manager.\n23\n         (3) The activities of the limited liability company and\n24       the conduct of those activities.\n25       (4) The means and conditions for amending the operating\n26       agreement.\n         13\n27        Trustee deposed some of the family members and included\n   portions of these depositions as evidence in support of the\n28 consolidation motion.\n\n                                    -20-\n\f 1   business.   Family members who worked for TE also worked for LJ.\n 2   LJ occupied the same space as TE, engaged in the same business\n 3   and used the same equipment and business forms as TE, sometimes\n 4   just striking out the name of TE.     Payment for debtors’\n 5   bankruptcy attorneys and other personal payments came from LJ\n 6   accounts.   Further, Lox admitted that some of the jewelry left\n 7   at the Grove Plaza store belonged to debtors/TE.     After months\n 8   of discovery, however, the record shows that LJ still did not\n 9   accurately identify and segregate the jewelry that belonged to\n10   debtors/TE from that of LJ.\n11        The commingling of assets, the difficulty in segregating\n12   and ascertaining debtors’ assets and liabilities from those of\n13   TE and LJ, and the transfer of TE’s assets to LJ without any\n14   corporate formality demonstrate the type of close\n15   interrelationship between debtors and the non-debtor entities\n16   which warrants substantive consolidation.     Accordingly, the\n17   bankruptcy court’s decision to apply the substantive\n18   consolidation doctrine nunc pro tunc was appropriate.\n19        In the end, the bankruptcy court also considered evidence\n20   submitted by LJ in opposition to trustee’s MSJ which allegedly\n21   showed that LJ owned the jewelry found at the Grove Plaza store.\n22   In this regard, Lox testified in opposition to trustee’s MSJ\n23   that the jewelry came from 99 Jewelry, a business that she owned\n24   with her brother.   Trustee’s evidence shows however that debtor,\n25   Varathip Arronsakool, held herself out as a 50% owner of\n26   99 Jewelry.   Further, trustee’s expert, Alan Myers, testified\n27   that there were no bank statements, cancelled checks, income tax\n28   returns or sales tax returns that support or document that Lox\n\n                                    -21-\n\f 1   or 99 Jewelry paid for any of the items.   In addition, there\n 2   were no sales records for 99 Jewelry nor was there proof that\n 3   Lox had stored the items in a safe deposit box in the National\n 4   City Branch of Union Bank or anywhere else despite the fact that\n 5   she testified to the same.   Finally, as already noted, Lox’s own\n 6   testimony was that she was unemployed and thus did not have the\n 7   financial means to purchase any of the jewelry.14\n 8        To the extent the bankruptcy court was required to make\n 9   credibility determinations or make inferences from these facts,\n10   its determination that LJ did not own the jewelry found at the\n11   Grove Plaza store is reviewed under the clearly erroneous\n12   standard.   We cannot conclude that the bankruptcy court’s\n13   findings were clearly erroneous when they are based on a\n14   plausible view of the evidence as a whole.   “Where there are two\n15   permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice\n16   between them cannot be clearly erroneous.”   Anderson v. City of\n17   Bessemer City, N.C., 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985).   These factual\n18   findings, unchallenged by LJ on appeal, lend additional support\n19   to the bankruptcy court’s legal conclusion that application of\n20   the substantive consolidation doctrine nunc pro tunc15 was\n21   warranted because the assets of debtors, TE and LJ are\n22\n         14\n23         There is also no written agreement with debtors/TE that\n   shows Lox paid anything to purchase TE. At the continued 341(a)\n24 meeting of creditors held on June 29, 2011, debtors testified\n   that they had no written agreement with Lox to sell her jewelry.\n25\n        15\n26         LJ makes no argument on appeal that the nunc pro tunc\n   aspect of the bankruptcy court’s decision was an abuse of\n27 discretion. “[O]n appeal, arguments not raised by a party in its\n   opening brief are deemed waived.” Smith v. Marsh, 194 F.3d 1045,\n28 1052 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n                                    -22-\n\f 1   substantially the same.\n 2                             VI.

Debtors’ Jewelry Business\n13            For many years, debtors owned and operated a family jewelry\n14   business.      Debtors’ sons, Nimit and Nakon, and their daughter,\n15   Tarrah, worked at the business as did Loxunipan Pomsavanh (Lox)\n16   and her brother, Tanasin “Bo” Panusith (Bo), who were part of\n17   the Aroonsakool household.2     In February 2007, debtors entered\n18   into a seven-year lease at the Grove Plaza Shopping Center\n19   (Grove Plaza) in National City, California, where they operated\n20   their jewelry business named TE.\n21            In January 2010, Hieu, Inc. filed a complaint against TE\n22   alleging breach of contract for debtors’ failure to return\n23\n24        1\n          Unless otherwise indicated, all chapter and section\n   references are to the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532.\n25 “Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy\n26 Procedure and “Civil Rule” references are to the Federal Rules of\n   Civil Procedure.\n27\n        2\n          Both Lox and Bo lived with debtors for many years but were\n28 not their biological children.\n\n                                         -2-\n\f 1   jewelry items.    In June 2010, Hieu obtained a judgment against\n 2   TE and proceeded to collect its judgment by placing a keeper at\n 3   the Grove Plaza store.    In October 2010, Lox accepted service on\n 4   behalf of TE for placement of a keeper.    Donald Jaffee, counsel\n 5   for LJ in this matter, filed a third party claim in the case on\n 6   behalf of TE and submitted the declaration of Varathip in\n 7   opposition to the keeper.    The declaration, signed under penalty\n 8   of perjury, stated that the market value of the property at the\n 9   Grove Plaza store was $1 million and that TE had been denied\n10   access to its records.    Ultimately, Jaffee represented TE in a\n11   settlement between Hieu and TE.\n12        Tax Returns for the year 2010 show that TE had a beginning\n13   2010 inventory value of $677,725 and end of year 2010 inventory\n14   value of $650,580.    At some point in 2010, TE went out of\n15   business.\n16        2.     LJ Is Formed And Opened For Business\n17        On January 4, 2011, LJ was formed.    Lox is the sole owner\n18   and managing member of LJ.\n19        Twenty days prior to debtors’ bankruptcy filing, Lox was\n20   added as an additional tenant to the Grove Plaza lease based on\n21   representations from debtors that she was going to operate the\n22   store as her own business.    At that time, Lox submitted an\n23   application to the landlord containing information about her\n24   financial condition.    Lox stated that she was a current employee\n25   of TE, held the position of manager, and that her salary was\n26   $24,000 a year.    Lox listed assets valued at $10,000, but at the\n27   same time stated that she would spend $250,000 to acquire\n28\n\n                                     -3-\n\f 1   inventory for her business.3    Later, in a deposition conducted\n 2   in connection with the substantive consolidation motion at issue\n 3   in this appeal, Lox explained away these facts by testifying\n 4   that she made them up.\n 5           Lox then proceeded to open LJ for business.   A few days\n 6   before the landlord received notice of debtors’ bankruptcy\n 7   filing, the TE store sign was removed and a new sign installed\n 8   changing the name of the business to LJ.4    During the pendency\n 9   of the bankruptcy, the lease was amended to reflect Lox as the\n10   sole tenant and guarantor of the lease as of June 1, 2011.      The\n11   record evidence shows LJ used the same computers, database,\n12   furniture, fixtures, and equipment that TE had used.      LJ also\n13   used the same business forms and invoices that TE had used and,\n14   in many cases, the name of TE was crossed out on the form and\n15   the name of LJ substituted.     As in the case of TE, workers at LJ\n16   included Lox, Nimit, and Nakon.     Nakon and Nimit both testified\n17   that they “helped out” at LJ.     Further, another employee who was\n18   a jeweler worked at TE and then worked at LJ.\n19           Lox admitted that TE left some jewelry at the Grove Plaza\n20   store when it closed down, including brass, stainless steel and\n21   silver items.     In deposition testimony, Lox claimed that the\n22\n23\n         3\n          Lox listed Varathip as a reference in her application,\n24 stating that Varathip was her mother.\n25       4\n          According to the record, Nimit contacted Best Sign Company\n26 to create a sign for a “new company” in January 2011. Trustee\n   alleges that the “new company” was LJ, but in opposition to\n27 trustee’s motion for summary judgment (MSJ) (described in further\n   detail below), Nimit allegedly intended to open a company by the\n28 name of Coast Gem USA, LLC.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f 1   remaining jewelry located at the Grove Plaza store was hers and\n 2   came from an entity called 99 Jewelry owned by her and her\n 3   brother Bo which operated between 2001 and 2005.       However, the\n 4   record also indicates Varathip owned 50% of 99 Jewelry as\n 5   represented in a credit application for Mercedes-Benz.       Lox\n 6   testified that when 99 Jewelry shut down in 2006, she stored the\n 7   jewelry in a safe deposit box at Union Bank.       The record reveals\n 8   that Union Bank was unable to identify a safe deposit box in the\n 9   name of LJ or Lox.5\n10            Moreover, the record contains no evidence that LJ or Lox\n11   paid anything to debtors or TE for the business or the jewelry\n12   other than Lox’s testimony that she paid TE for the computer,\n13   furniture, safe and fixtures which were at the Grove Plaza\n14   store.      Although Lox testified that she never borrowed money\n15   from anyone for the purpose of opening or operating LJ, her own\n16   testimony shows that she did not have the financial wherewithal\n17   to purchase any of TE’s assets.       Contrary to the financial\n18   information that she gave Grove Plaza when she was added to the\n19   lease, she testified that prior to December 2010, she was not\n20   employed anywhere other than as a caretaker for her grandmother\n21   since 2000.      Although she received $800-900 a month from the\n22   state or federal government to care for her grandmother, Lox\n23   testified that she received no other income.\n24   B.       Bankruptcy Events:   Procedural History\n25            On April 28, 2011, debtors filed a chapter 7 petition.\n26\n          5\n27        Bo also declared that his purchase and storage of jewelry\n   from 99 Jewelry was placed with LJ for sale, but trustee did not\n28 take his deposition.\n\n                                        -5-\n\f 1   Akers was appointed the trustee.       At the time of their filing,\n 2   debtors owed over $1.3 million in unsecured debt.\n 3           Debtors stated in their petition that they formerly did\n 4   business as TE.     Under personal property in Schedule B, they\n 5   listed TE as 70% owned by them jointly and described:\n 6           Wife owns 50%, Husband owns 20%, three children each\n             own 10%. Consignment based jewelry business. Imports\n 7           and exports jewelry from Thailand to USA. Neither Debtors\n             nor business have ownership interest in jewelry sold.\n 8           Debtors ceased operatio[n] (sic).\n 9   Debtors assigned a value of 0.00 to TE.      Debtors listed\n10   creditors who held judgments against TE alone or against both TE\n11   and debtors in Schedule F.6\n12           Prior to the initial meeting of creditors, a listed\n13   creditor, Saif Siddiqui of Americans/Gold/Diamonds, contacted\n14   trustee advising him that debtors were continuing to operate the\n15   jewelry store through their children to “defraud creditors” and\n16   that the “new” company existed at the same location (Grove\n17   Plaza) with the same employees.     Siddiqui also stated that he\n18   spoke to other vendors with smaller debts and that they were\n19   being paid with checks issued by LJ to pay debts owed by TE.\n20           1.   Trustee’s Lockdown Of The Grove Plaza Store\n21           At the § 341(a) meeting of creditors on May 26, 2011,\n22   debtors testified that all of the inventory of TE was\n23   consignment jewelry of undisclosed wholesale sellers or other\n24   jewelry proprietors and, prior to the bankruptcy filing, all\n25   jewelry inventory of TE had been returned to the consigning\n26\n         6\n27        We take judicial notice of debtors’ petition and\n   schedules.

There is no documentation in the record showing that\n 2   all the jewelry located at the Grove Plaza store was consigned —\n 3   although some of it was — nor is there any documentation showing\n 4   that the jewelry was returned to the consigning parties.\n 5            On the same day, without the benefit of a court order,\n 6   trustee locked down the Grove Plaza store to protect the assets\n 7   for the benefit of creditors.\n 8            2.   The Adversary Complaint\n 9            Less than a month later, on June 20, 2011, trustee filed an\n10   adversary complaint against LJ, Lox, and the Aroonsakool\n11   children (Nimit, Nakon and Tarrah) seeking declaratory and\n12   injunctive relief and alleging claims for turnover and to avoid\n13   and recover fraudulent transfers.       Trustee sought a declaration\n14   that the jewelry at the Grove Plaza store was property of\n15   debtors’ estate.7\n16            LJ and Lox filed answers to the complaint and a\n17   counterclaim against trustee for damages arising from trustee’s\n18   seizure of the business.      In November 2011, LJ and Lox filed an\n19   amended counterclaim alleging claims against trustee for\n20   violation of duties, conversion, trespass and fraud, and seeking\n21   declaratory and injunctive relief.      A year later, in November\n22\n          7\n23          On September 29, 2011, trustee moved to sell the personal\n     property at the Grove Plaza store. LJ and Lox opposed,\n24   contending that the personal property was not part of the\n     bankruptcy estate and that an adversary proceeding was required.\n25   In November 2011, the bankruptcy court denied trustee’s motion on\n26   the grounds that it could not allow a sale of property as\n     “property of the estate” without first determining whether the\n27   debtor in fact owned the property, see Moldo v. Clark\n     (In re Clark), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1930395\"><a href=\"/opinion/1930395/in-re-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">163</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 172 (9th Cir. BAP 2001), and noted\n28   that trustee had an adversary proceeding pending.\n\n                                       -7-\n\f 1   2012, trustee entered into an agreement with LJ, Lox, Bo and\n 2   Grove Plaza, LP, which settled, among other things, the\n 3   counterclaim.        In exchange for Grove Plaza, LP withdrawing its\n 4   bankruptcy claim, trustee’s insurer paid Grove Plaza, LP $23,500\n 5   for unpaid rent and LJ $110,000 in damages.8       In December 2012,\n 6   the counterclaim was dismissed.\n 7                   a.   Motion For Summary Judgment\n 8                   On December 4, 2011, trustee filed a MSJ seeking\n 9   judgment on all claims alleged in the complaint as a matter of\n10   law.        Trustee argued that debtors and TE were alter egos because\n11   debtors did not observe any corporate formalities as shown by\n12   the undisputed evidence.        He further maintained that the\n13   transfers of TE’s property to LJ were avoidable as fraudulent\n14   transfers as a matter of law.\n15              In opposition to the MSJ, Nimit submitted a declaration\n16   stating that “[n]one of the assets of Thai Export were in any\n17   way transferred to Luxury . . . [Lox] was the owner of Luxury\n18   and I saw her purchasing inventory for Luxury and I assisted in\n19   purchasing inventory for Luxury, using Luxury funds.”        Debtors\n20   each submitted declarations stating that at the time of their\n21   bankruptcy filing, there was no property owned by them at the\n22\n23\n            8\n          It appears that after trustee locked down the premises, he\n24 discovered that $10,000 worth of the jewelry actually belonged to\n   LJ. Moreover, trustee held jewelry that was on layaway or in for\n25 repairs. However, trustee continued to maintain that the total\n26 value of jewelry at the store was $150,000.

BAP 2006), trustee’s request to treat the assets of a\n 8   non-debtor entity as the debtor’s assets for purpose of bringing\n 9   those assets into the bankruptcy estate, or to obtain standing\n10   to assert fraudulent conveyance theories as to transfers of the\n11   non-debtor’s assets, is tantamount to a request for substantive\n12   consolidation.   The court observed that trustee’s complaint had\n13   not pled “reverse veil piercing” or “substantive consolidation”\n14   theories, nor had he filed a motion for substantive\n15   consolidation.   However, the bankruptcy court noted that the\n16   adversary proceeding had not yet gone to trial and, given the\n17   strength of trustee’s evidence that TE was operated as a sole\n18   proprietorship and that LJ was a sham, the court denied\n19   trustee’s MSJ without prejudice.      The court gave trustee thirty\n20   days to amend his complaint or take whatever actions he deemed\n21   necessary to place the issues properly before the court.\n22             b.     Motion For Substantive Consolidation\n23             On February 22, 2013, trustee filed a motion to\n24   substantively consolidate debtors’ estate with non-debtors, TE\n25   and LJ, or, alternatively, for leave to file an amended\n26\n27\n28\n\n                                     -9-\n\f 1   complaint.9    In support, trustee submitted more than a hundred\n 2   pages of exhibits and other evidence intended to show that\n 3   debtors and TE disregarded corporate formalities and that LJ\n 4   used the same premises, furniture, fixtures, and showcases\n 5   previously used by TE without paying TE or debtors a dime.      In\n 6   addition, trustee included evidence that showed TE and LJ used\n 7   the same forms for jewelry consignments and invoices and other\n 8   matters, changing only the names on the forms.      Finally, trustee\n 9   maintained that creditors of debtors, TE and LJ dealt with the\n10   entities as a single economic unit.\n11           On March 11, 2013, the date opposition was due, LJ filed an\n12   ex parte application for a four-day extension of time to respond\n13   to trustee’s motion.     It argued that:   the motion was\n14   “voluminous” with more than a hundred pages of exhibits and\n15   declarations; the pleading actually contained two motions - the\n16   motion for substantive consolidation and a motion to amend; the\n17   motion was in breach of the settlement agreement between trustee\n18   and LJ on the counterclaim asserted in the complaint; and\n19   counsel for LJ was engaged in post-trial proceedings in state\n20   court which had a due date of March 8, 2013.      In a supporting\n21   declaration, Jaffee declared that he had been seriously ill from\n22   March 8, 2013, to the date of the filing of the request for\n23   continuance.\n24           Trustee filed a limited opposition.   Trustee maintained\n25   that the motion for substantive consolidation did not violate\n26\n         9\n27        The motion was filed in the adversary proceeding. Notice\n   was given to creditors listed on the creditor’s matrix and also\n28 to creditors of TE and LJ.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f 1   the settlement agreement and noted that the exhibits submitted\n 2   in support of the motion were the same as those filed in\n 3   connection with trustee’s MSJ.    In addition, if the bankruptcy\n 4   court granted LJ’s extension of time, trustee requested a\n 5   three-day extension to file his reply.\n 6        On March 13, 2013, the bankruptcy court denied the\n 7   application because LJ’s requested extension of time, followed\n 8   by a concomitant request for extension of time by trustee to\n 9   reply, left the court with an unacceptably brief period of time\n10   to prepare for the motion.\n11        Despite the bankruptcy court’s denial order, LJ filed an\n12   opposition to trustee’s motion on March 15, 2013.    LJ’s\n13   opposition contained no substantive arguments.    In oral argument\n14   before this court, Jaffe maintained that he could not assert any\n15   substantive arguments because the bankruptcy court had denied\n16   his request for a continuance.    Instead, LJ asserted in\n17   opposition that a continuance should have been granted and that,\n18   by not allowing the extension, it appeared the bankruptcy court\n19   was going out of its way to assist trustee.10    LJ further argued\n20   that any amendment to the complaint would be prejudicial due to\n21   the passage of time.   Finally, LJ complained that trustee had\n22   failed to include an amended complaint.\n23        On April 9, 2013, the bankruptcy court issued a tentative\n24\n25       10\n          To the extent Jaffe implies that the court’s denial of\n26 his motion for a continuance evidences bias, this argument has no\n   merit. Adverse rulings by themselves do not constitute the\n27 requisite bias necessary to warrant recusal of a judge even if\n   the rulings were erroneous. United States v.

At the April 11, 2013\n 5   hearing on the matter, the bankruptcy court adopted its\n 6   tentative and directed counsel for trustee to file detailed\n 7   findings of fact and conclusions of law (FFCL).\n 8        On April 25, 2013, LJ filed a notice of appeal.    On May 17,\n 9   2013, the bankruptcy court entered the FFCL and on May 23, 2013\n10   entered the order granting trustee’s motion.    On May 31, 2013,\n11   LJ filed an amended notice of appeal.11\n12                           II.   JURISDICTION\n13        The bankruptcy court had jurisdiction over this proceeding\n14   under 28 U.S.C. § 157(b)(1) and (b)(2)(A).    We now address our\n15   jurisdiction over this appeal.\n16        Orders denying a motion for a continuance are generally\n17   interlocutory.   “Unlike final orders, interlocutory orders\n18   decide merely one aspect of the case without disposing of the\n19   case in its entirety on the merits.”    See United States v.

LJ appealed the court’s ruling authorizing the sale\n28 of the personal property in BAP No. 13-1539.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f 1   motion to continue merges into the final order deciding the\n 2   merits.

The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Err In Denying LJ’s Request\n          For An Extension Of Time\n20\n21        LJ’s main argument on appeal is that the bankruptcy court’s\n22   error in denying its request for an extension of time to file\n23   opposition to trustee’s motion warrants reversal of the\n24   consolidation order.   According to LJ, the bankruptcy court\n25   should have granted its request under the holding in Ahanchian\n26   v. Xenon Pictures, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"178684\"><a href=\"/opinion/178684/ahanchian-v-xenon-pictures-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1253</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2010) which discusses\n27   the standards for extension requests under Civil Rule 6(b)(1).\n28   There, the Ninth Circuit held that requests for extensions of\n\n                                       -14-\n\f 1   time made before the applicable deadline has passed should\n 2   normally be granted in the absence of bad faith or prejudice to\n 3   the adverse party.   LJ asserts that there is no evidence it\n 4   acted in bad faith nor would there have been prejudice to\n 5   trustee had the continuance been granted.\n 6        We have previously noted that the standards in Ahanchian\n 7   are not applicable to requests for an extension of time:\n 8        A careful reading of the Bankruptcy Rules shows that\n          Civil Rule 6(b)(1) does not apply in adversary\n 9        proceedings. Unlike many other Civil Rules, the Rules\n          do not incorporate Civil Rule 6. Instead, portions of\n10        Civil Rule 6 are adopted via Rule 9006, which governs,\n          generally, “enlargement” of time periods. And while\n11        some of the language of Civil Rule 6(b)(1) is similar\n          to that in Rule 9006(b), the provisions of Civil\n12        Rule 6(b)(1) establishing the “good cause” standard\n          for granting extensions of time are not adopted in the\n13        Rules.\n14   N.

BAP 2011),\n16   aff’d, In re Bellow, 544 Fed.Appx. 732 (9th Cir. 2013).    Because\n17   Rule 9006(b) controls all motions for extensions of time in the\n18   bankruptcy courts (whether made in an adversary proceeding or\n19   not), Civil Rule 6(b)(1) standards for extensions of time do not\n20   apply.   Therefore, LJ’s reliance on Ahanachian is misplaced.\n21        Rule 9006(b)(1) states that a bankruptcy court may at any\n22   time in its discretion enlarge the time period in which an act\n23   is required or allowed to be done.    A bankruptcy court has\n24   substantial discretion to control its own calendar.    Danjaq LLC\n25   v.

Four\n26   factors are relevant to our inquiry into whether the court\n27   abused its discretion in denying a continuance:    (1) whether the\n28   requesting party has been diligent; (2) whether there is a\n\n                                    -15-\n\f 1   genuine need for the continuance; (3) whether the continuance\n 2   will inconvenience the Court and the opposing party including\n 3   its witnesses; (4) whether the requesting party will suffer\n 4   prejudice if the request is denied.    Absent a showing of\n 5   prejudice suffered by LJ, we will not disturb the bankruptcy\n 6   court’s ruling.   Danjaq, 263 F.3d at 961; see also Berry v.

This vague allegation is not\n15   adequate to satisfy the prejudice requirement.    See United\n16   States v.

Indeed, on appeal LJ\n19   identifies no arguments it would have made had it more time to\n20   prepare nor does it rebut trustee’s evidence with its own offer\n21   of proof.\n22        At oral argument, the Panel questioned counsel for LJ about\n23   how its arguments or evidence would differ from that presented\n24   in opposition to trustee’s MSJ.   Counsel maintained that the\n25   evidence in opposition to substantive consolidation would be\n26   “significantly different” from evidence submitted in opposition\n27   to the MSJ.   This argument is not persuasive.   Trustee’s MSJ\n28   raised the issue of whether debtors and TE were alter egos.\n\n                                    -16-\n\f 1   Alter ego doctrine and substantive consolidation overlap when\n 2   the second factor under Bonham is at issue.    “Entanglement can\n 3   be shown where there is a unity of interest and common ownership\n 4   between the debtor and the target entities, the target entities\n 5   were ‘but instrumentalities of the bankrupt with no separate\n 6   existence,’ there was commingling of assets and no clear\n 7   demarcation between the affairs of the debtor and the target\n 8   entities, and adhering to the separate corporate entities theory\n 9   would result in an injustice to the bankrupt’s creditors.”\n10   Sharp v.

The record shows that the requested extension would\n25   not have served any legitimate need of LJ.    In opposing\n26   trustee’s MSJ, LJ submitted the testimony of Lox to support its\n27   ownership claim to the jewelry.   However, in concluding that\n28   substantive consolidation was warranted, the bankruptcy court\n\n                                    -17-\n\f 1   relied on trustee’s evidence which impeached Lox’s credibility\n 2   as a witness.   There is no indication in the record or in LJ’s\n 3   brief on appeal that an extension of time would have assisted LJ\n 4   in refuting the trustee’s evidence to support its ownership\n 5   claim.   Further, the bankruptcy court specifically found that an\n 6   extension of time would be inconvenient for the court as it\n 7   would not have adequate time to prepare.    Under these\n 8   circumstances, LJ was not prejudiced and we will not disturb the\n 9   court’s ruling denying its request for an extension of time.\n10   B.   The Bankruptcy Court Did Not Err When It Granted the\n          Substantive Consolidation Motion Nunc Pro Tunc\n11\n12        Substantive consolidation is an uncodified, equitable\n13   doctrine allowing the bankruptcy court, for purposes of the\n14   bankruptcy, to “combine the assets and liabilities of separate\n15   and distinct—but related—legal entities into a single pool and\n16   treat them as though they belong to a single entity.”\n17   In re Bonham, 229 F.3d at 764.    The doctrine “enables a\n18   bankruptcy court to disregard separate corporate entities, to\n19   pierce their corporate veils in the usual metaphor, in order to\n20   reach assets for the satisfaction of debts of a related\n21   corporation.”   Id.   The essential purpose behind the doctrine\n22   is one of fairness to all creditors, but it is a doctrine to be\n23   used sparingly.   Id. at 764, 768.\n24        In Bonham, the Ninth Circuit adopted a disjunctive two-\n25   factor test for determining whether application of the\n26   substantive consolidation doctrine is warranted.    In applying\n27   the test, courts consider whether creditors dealt with the\n28   entities as a single economic unit and did not rely on their\n\n                                      -18-\n\f 1   separate identity in extending credit or whether the affairs of\n 2   the debtor are so entangled that consolidation will benefit all\n 3   creditors.    229 F.3d at 766.   “In either case, the bankruptcy\n 4   court must in essence determine that the assets of all of the\n 5   consolidated parties are substantially the same.”     Bonham,\n 6   229 F.3d at 771.    Ultimately, the decision to apply the\n 7   substantive consolidation doctrine stems from a weighing of the\n 8   equities and must be tailored to meet the needs of each\n 9   particular case.    Id.\n10        Trustee, as the moving party, has the initial burden of\n11   showing either one of the Bonham factors are met.     Reider v.\n12   Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. (In re Reider ), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675858\"><a href=\"/opinion/675858/in-re-ida-v-reider-and-james-m-reider-debtors-ida-v-reider-v-federal/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1107\n13   (11th Cir. 1994).    Once trustee establishes a close\n14   interrelationship between debtors and the non-debtor entities,\n15   there is a presumption that creditors did not rely on their\n16   separate credit.    The burden of proof then shifts to the parties\n17   opposing substantive consolidation to show otherwise.     Bonham,\n18   229 F.3d at 767.\n19        We begin by reviewing the evidence regarding the\n20   interrelationship between debtors and TE.     At the outset, we\n21   observe that there is some question whether TE had a signed and\n22   dated operating agreement; there was no agreement in the\n23   record.12    Moreover, there is no evidence in the record that TE\n24\n25       12\n          Cal. Corp. Code § 17701.10 entitled “Operating agreement;\n26 scope; limitations, variations, and modifications; fiduciary\n   duty; indemnification and damages” provides:\n27\n        (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the\n28                                                       continue...\n\n                                      -19-\n\f 1   ever held formal meetings, took minutes or conducted an election\n 2   of officers.   The record also establishes that TE was never\n 3   capitalized by debtors or debtors’ children, who were also\n 4   listed as members of TE.   Further, although family members\n 5   testified13 that they “helped out” at TE, the evidence shows that\n 6   they were not paid as employees.    Even debtors did not receive\n 7   any wages, or guaranteed payments from TE, per their 1040 tax\n 8   returns.   These facts, which are not contested, show that\n 9   debtors operated TE as a sole proprietorship and, with no source\n10   of any other income, took money from the business as needed,\n11   treating the assets as their own.\n12        The line of corporate separateness between TE and LJ is\n13   more blurry.   As noted by the bankruptcy court, LJ was formed\n14   when debtors/TE were facing litigation and post-judgment\n15   collection activities from creditors.   Moreover, as the record\n16   indicates, LJ was in reality simply a continuation of TE’s\n17\n18        12\n           ...continue\n19       operating agreement governs all of the following:\n\n20       (1) Relations among the members as members and between\n         the members and the limited liability company.\n21\n22       (2) The rights and duties under this title of a person\n         in the capacity of manager.\n23\n         (3) The activities of the limited liability company and\n24       the conduct of those activities.\n25       (4) The means and conditions for amending the operating\n26       agreement.\n         13\n27        Trustee deposed some of the family members and included\n   portions of these depositions as evidence in support of the\n28 consolidation motion.\n\n                                    -20-\n\f 1   business.   Family members who worked for TE also worked for LJ.\n 2   LJ occupied the same space as TE, engaged in the same business\n 3   and used the same equipment and business forms as TE, sometimes\n 4   just striking out the name of TE.     Payment for debtors’\n 5   bankruptcy attorneys and other personal payments came from LJ\n 6   accounts.   Further, Lox admitted that some of the jewelry left\n 7   at the Grove Plaza store belonged to debtors/TE.     After months\n 8   of discovery, however, the record shows that LJ still did not\n 9   accurately identify and segregate the jewelry that belonged to\n10   debtors/TE from that of LJ.\n11        The commingling of assets, the difficulty in segregating\n12   and ascertaining debtors’ assets and liabilities from those of\n13   TE and LJ, and the transfer of TE’s assets to LJ without any\n14   corporate formality demonstrate the type of close\n15   interrelationship between debtors and the non-debtor entities\n16   which warrants substantive consolidation.     Accordingly, the\n17   bankruptcy court’s decision to apply the substantive\n18   consolidation doctrine nunc pro tunc was appropriate.\n19        In the end, the bankruptcy court also considered evidence\n20   submitted by LJ in opposition to trustee’s MSJ which allegedly\n21   showed that LJ owned the jewelry found at the Grove Plaza store.\n22   In this regard, Lox testified in opposition to trustee’s MSJ\n23   that the jewelry came from 99 Jewelry, a business that she owned\n24   with her brother.   Trustee’s evidence shows however that debtor,\n25   Varathip Arronsakool, held herself out as a 50% owner of\n26   99 Jewelry.   Further, trustee’s expert, Alan Myers, testified\n27   that there were no bank statements, cancelled checks, income tax\n28   returns or sales tax returns that support or document that Lox\n\n                                    -21-\n\f 1   or 99 Jewelry paid for any of the items.   In addition, there\n 2   were no sales records for 99 Jewelry nor was there proof that\n 3   Lox had stored the items in a safe deposit box in the National\n 4   City Branch of Union Bank or anywhere else despite the fact that\n 5   she testified to the same.   Finally, as already noted, Lox’s own\n 6   testimony was that she was unemployed and thus did not have the\n 7   financial means to purchase any of the jewelry.14\n 8        To the extent the bankruptcy court was required to make\n 9   credibility determinations or make inferences from these facts,\n10   its determination that LJ did not own the jewelry found at the\n11   Grove Plaza store is reviewed under the clearly erroneous\n12   standard.   We cannot conclude that the bankruptcy court’s\n13   findings were clearly erroneous when they are based on a\n14   plausible view of the evidence as a whole.   “Where there are two\n15   permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder’s choice\n16   between them cannot be clearly erroneous.”   Anderson v. City of\n17   Bessemer City, N.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574 (1985).   These factual\n18   findings, unchallenged by LJ on appeal, lend additional support\n19   to the bankruptcy court’s legal conclusion that application of\n20   the substantive consolidation doctrine nunc pro tunc15 was\n21   warranted because the assets of debtors, TE and LJ are\n22\n         14\n23         There is also no written agreement with debtors/TE that\n   shows Lox paid anything to purchase TE. At the continued 341(a)\n24 meeting of creditors held on June 29, 2011, debtors testified\n   that they had no written agreement with Lox to sell her jewelry.\n25\n        15\n26         LJ makes no argument on appeal that the nunc pro tunc\n   aspect of the bankruptcy court’s decision was an abuse of\n27 discretion. “[O]n appeal, arguments not raised by a party in its\n   opening brief are deemed waived.” Smith v.
