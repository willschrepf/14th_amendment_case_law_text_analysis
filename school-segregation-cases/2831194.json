These two cases, filed under seal, present a legal question regarding\nthe conduct of reviews of documents for privilege.1 Specifically, we must determine who has the\nright to conduct a review for privilege of documents subject to a grand jury subpoena directed to a\nthird party who possesses the documents but has not yet produced them to the government: the\ntargets of the investigation whose rights of privilege are potentially implicated, or the federal\ngovernment, operating a “taint team” behind a “Chinese wall” or protective screen.\n\n\n        *\n           The Honorable William W Schwarzer, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California,\nsitting by designation.\n        1\n            As the two cases present essentially identical issues of law and fact, we will address them together.\n\n\n                                                            1\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275        In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                   Page 2\n\n\n         These cases arise from events leading up to the 2003 bankruptcy filing of Venture Holdings\nLLC (“Venture”), a company once controlled by appellant Larry Winget. After Venture’s new\n(post-filing) management conducted an internal investigation, the company filed suit against Winget\nfor allegedly fraudulent conveyances of goods and services from Venture to other entities that\nWinget owned or controlled. Shortly thereafter, a federal grand jury issued two subpoenas duces\ntecum, filed under seal, to Venture. Winget filed a motion to intervene, and seven companies\naffiliated with Winget (the “Affiliated Companies”) later joined this motion. The documents in\nquestion have not been examined by any of the parties, and they remain in locations under Venture’s\ncontrol. Winget and the Affiliated Companies demanded the right to conduct their own privilege\nreview of the documents responsive to the subpoenas, as both the government and Venture are\nactually or possibly litigation opponents of Winget’s or the Affiliated Companies’. The government\nopposed this motion, and asserted that any privilege review be conducted by its own “taint team.”\nThe district court granted Winget’s and the Affiliated Companies’ motions to intervene, but agreed\nwith the government with respect to the “taint team” review procedure. The district court issued an\nalternative holding that Winget had also failed to meet the threshold requirement of showing any\nrights of privilege in the requested documents. For the reasons stated below, we reverse and remand.\n                                                  I\n        The circumstances leading to the instant controversy are sufficiently convoluted to require\nsome summary description despite the fact that the documents in the suit remain under seal. Larry\nWinget was once the sole owner of Venture, a global automotive supplier, and had served as its\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer. Winget also owned or controlled numerous other\ncompanies, including the Affiliated Companies. The headquarters of Venture and of each of the\nAffiliated Companies were located in the same office in Fraser, Michigan.\n       In 1999, Venture purchased a German company called Peguform. In October 2002, a\nGerman court declared Peguform insolvent under Germany’s bankruptcy regime. This threatened\nVenture’s solvency and caused a group of bank creditors to assert more control over the company.\nConsequently, Joseph Day was installed as a director in January 2003. Venture then filed for\nbankruptcy on March 28, 2003 under Chapter 11 in the Eastern District of Michigan. At the same\ntime, Day replaced Winget as Venture’s Chief Executive Officer. Six months later, on September\n22, 2003, Winget and Venture entered into a Contribution Agreement (“Contribution Agreement”),\nwhereby several entities owned by Winget and certain of his affiliates would transfer their assets and\nownership to a new company that would be formed in connection with Venture’s reorganization.\n       Also in September 2003, Venture’s new management hired an accounting firm to conduct\na forensic audit of related-party transactions between Venture and some of the many companies\nassociated with Winget. In March 2004, Venture’s auditors concluded that Venture had in the past\npaid millions of dollars to some Winget-owned or -controlled companies for products and services\nwhose fair market value was allegedly substantially less than the price paid, which would have\ncontradicted certain statements in Venture’s SEC filings during the relevant years. The auditors’\nconclusions remain untested, and we will not venture to assess their accuracy.\n        On April 5, 2004, as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Venture and its official committee\nof unsecured creditors filed a still-pending civil suit against Winget, some of his family members,\nand numerous associated entities, asserting claims of unjust enrichment, breaches of fiduciary duties,\nand fraudulent transfers arising from Venture’s payment of funds to Winget’s affiliated companies.\nVenture v. Winget, Adversary Proc. 04-4374, In re Venture Holdings Company LLC, No. 03-48939\n(Bankr. E.D. Mich.). On May 13, 2004, Venture and Winget signed a Separation Agreement\n(“Separation Agreement”), whereby Winget agreed to terminate his employment by Venture and\nresign as officer and director. In exchange, he was to receive $50,000 every month while Venture\nremained under Chapter 11 protection, and he was further entitled to “continue the exclusive,\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275        In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                       Page 3\n\n\nuninterrupted use of the office which he currently occupies” at James J. Pompo Drive. This\nagreement forms part of the substantive basis for Winget’s claims to privilege in the instant case,\nbut we are in no position now to assess its substance or legal effect because the instant controversy\ninvolves a matter that is logically antecedent to the substance of any privilege disputes.\n        On January 21, 2005, the bankruptcy court rejected Venture’s proposed reorganization plan,\nand, therefore, the Contribution Agreement as well. On April 8, 2005, with an April 29 amendment,\nNew Venture Holdings LLC (“New Venture”) was formed by Venture’s pre-petition lenders, who\nagreed to buy the assets and assume the liabilities of (old) Venture and nine other companies owned\nor controlled by Winget that had filed for Chapter 11 in May 2004. The bankruptcy court\nsubsequently approved this transaction. On May 2, 2005, (old) Venture and the nine affiliated\ncompanies formally transferred their assets and liabilities to New Venture. In October 2005, New\nVenture changed its name to Cadence Innovation LLC.\n        Meanwhile, the federal government began investigating the matter. In the fall of 2004, a\nnumber of grand jury subpoenas duces tecum were issued. Relevantly to the case at hand, New\nVenture received two such subpoenas, and the company soon agreed to cooperate with the federal\ninvestigation, waiving its corporate attorney-client and work-product privileges in October 2004.\nAs the subpoenas in question were filed under seal, and as their precise substance is not particularly\nrelevant to the instant controversy, we will respect grand jury secrecy and exercise our discretion\nby not discussing their contents. Instead, we simply note that the subpoenas were directed to New\nVenture, and they demanded production of some documents that, all sides concede, may be\nprotected by either Winget’s or the Affiliated Companies’ attorney-client or work-product\nprivileges.\n        On March 1, 2005, Winget filed a motion in the Eastern District of Michigan to intervene\nand to modify the subpoenas in order to preserve privilege. In this motion, he claimed that some of\nthe records that New Venture had been called upon to produce were protected by Winget’s personal\nattorney-client or work-product privileges even though the documents remained in offices under\nVenture’s control. Winget therefore asked the court to approve a procedure, described in greater\ndetail below, whereby his attorneys would conduct a privilege review of the responsive documents.\nOn April 29, 2005, the Affiliated Companies filed a motion to join Winget’s intervention, arguing\nthat the subpoenas called for documents that could be protected by their corporate attorney-client\nand work-product privileges.\n       The government opposed Winget’s motion, claiming that he was\n       requesting this Court to allow him to insert himself into the middle of a grand jury\n       investigation so that he can be the first to screen documents produced . . . in response\n       to the two subpoenas. . . . [S]uch a procedure would subvert the orderly functioning\n       of the grand jury process and would be, to the best of the government’s knowledge,\n       unprecedented.\n(emphasis in original). Instead, the government proposed that a “taint team” composed of\ngovernment attorneys who are not involved in the grand jury investigation be established to\nsegregate privileged documents from the residue of non-privileged material. As we discuss more\nextensively below, the proposed taint team would return to Venture any documents that it\ndetermined to be privileged, sending copies to Winget where appropriate, and would submit the\nmaterials it determined to be potentially protected by privilege to Winget and the district court for\nfinal adjudication. However, the taint team would send documents it deemed not to be protected by\nappellants’ privilege directly to the grand jury, and so they would not provide appellants with any\nopportunity to review or challenge the team’s privilege determinations with respect to those\ndocuments.\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275         In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                       Page 4\n\n\n         The district court conducted a closed hearing on August 3, 2003. At this hearing, the court\nsternly questioned the parties regarding the legal merit of any privilege claims, and criticized Winget\nand the Affiliated Companies for failing to provide a log that detailed specific documents that they\nclaimed to be privileged. It is not clear how they could have done so, for it is certain that neither\nWinget, nor the Affiliated Companies, nor even the government, has yet had any access to the\nsubpoenaed documents. On September 7, the district court issued an order denying Winget’s\nrequested relief, and approved instead the government’s proposed taint team. The court issued an\nalternative ruling wherein it held that the appellants had failed to meet their burden of proving that\none or more of them held a privilege over the documents. Winget and the Affiliated Companies\nfiled a timely notice of appeal.\n                                                    II\n        The appellants essentially moved to “modify” the grand jury subpoenas, Fed. R. Crim. P.\n17(c)(2), see Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(2), and the resulting discovery order is immediately appealable.\nSee In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, 439 F.3d 740, 743 (D.C. Cir. 2006). The district court’s denial\nof this motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See United States v. Hughes, 895 F.2d 1135, 1145\n(6th Cir. 1990). A district court abuses its discretion, inter alia, “when it applies the incorrect legal\nstandard [or] misapplies the correct legal standard.” Deja Vu of Cincinnati, LLC v. Union Twp. Bd.\nof Trustees, 411 F.3d 777, 782 (6th Cir. 2005) (en banc), cert. denied, 126 S. Ct. 1023 (2006)\n(quoting Schenck v. City of Hudson, 114 F.3d 590, 593 (6th Cir. 1997)). “A district court by\ndefinition abuses its discretion when it makes an error of law.” Koon v. United States, 518 U.S. 81,\n100 (1996). As the district court rested its opinion on legal grounds alone, we review that decision\nde novo. Moreover, to the extent that the court below reached a substantive judgment regarding the\nwaiver of attorney-client privilege, we also review that decision de novo. In re Powerhouse\nLicensing, LLC, 441 F.3d 467, 472 (6th Cir. 2006).\n        The only question before us is whether the district court erred in preferring the government’s\nproposed taint team to the appellants’ own attorneys to make initial privilege determinations with\nrespect to documents in the third-party subpoena recipient’s possession. We have not been asked\nto determine whether any of these documents are actually privileged, and the time is clearly not ripe\nto adjudicate the merits of any potential privilege claims. Instead, our duty here is to determine the\nlogically antecedent issue as to which party – the government or the appellants – has the right to\nconduct a privilege screen of documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena issued to a third party.\nThe government in fact concedes that some of the documents responsive to the subpoena may be\nprotected by appellants’ privilege, does not challenge the appellants’ general rights of privilege, and\ndoes not seem to contest that the appellants would have had the right to conduct their own privilege\nreview had the subpoena been directed to them instead of New Venture. Instead, the government\ncomplains that allowing the appellants’ own attorneys to conduct a privilege review of the\nsubpoenaed documents at New Venture would interfere with a government investigation and\nundermine grand jury secrecy. This controversy thus calls for us to weigh, to some degree, grand\njury investigations and grand jury secrecy against attorney-client and work-product privilege.\n                                                    A\n       In the first step of the appellants’ proposed procedure,2 their own counsel would provide the\ngovernment and New Venture with a “list of the law firms, attorneys, and agents” who represented\nthem. Then, a paralegal retained by appellants’ counsel would review the implicated documents in\n\n\n\n        2\n        Winget proposed this procedure in his motion to intervene docketed on March 1, 2005. The Affiliated\nCompanies joined in that motion, and in the requested procedure, in their motion filed on April 28, 2005.\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275             In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                                  Page 5\n\n\noffices controlled by New Venture,3 and segregate those documents that had been “authored by,\nreceived by, copied to, or that mention anyone identified on the list” from the remainder. Third, the\nappellants’ attorneys would review “copies of the segregated documents and prepare a privilege log\nfor any documents that [appellants] claim as privileged.” The appellants would thus create a log\ndocumenting materials for which they claim the protection of privilege, and this log would\npresumably include sufficient information about the privilege claims that the government could\nintelligently evaluate appellants’ assertions by reviewing the log. Finally, “the parties would bring\nany privilege disputes before the Court.” This seems to reflect a fairly standard practice by which\nlaw firms conduct privilege reviews when responding to government subpoenas or other discovery\nrequests. See Cheney v. United States Dist. Ct. for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 399 n.5 (2004); Lexicon, Inc.\nv. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., 436 F.3d 662, 665-73 (6th Cir. 2006); McAlpin v. Lexington 76 Auto Truck\nStop, Inc., 229 F.3d 491, 499 (6th Cir. 2000). See also In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, 439 F.3d at\n751 (“[Civil] Rule 45(d)(2) is generally satisfied by the submission of a privilege log detailing each\ndocument withheld and the reason.”). Alternatively, the 4appellants request that the district court\nappoint a Special Master to conduct the privilege review.\n        While the government obviously has an interest in assisting the grand jury’s investigation,\nthe government also has a genuine, if conflicting, interest in preventing investigators from accessing\nprivileged materials. Indeed, the government concedes that the leaking of privileged materials to\ninvestigators would raise the spectre of Kastigar-like evidentiary hearings, see Kastigar v. United\nStates, 406 U.S. 441 (1972), and argues that it would therefore act conservatively, and err on the side\nof caution, in assessing the existence of privilege and in screening privileged documents from\ninvestigators. In the government’s proposed procedure, a taint team consisting of at least one\nAssistant United States Attorney (from the same Eastern District of Michigan office as the\nprosecutors) and at least one Postal Inspector would review for privilege all documents produced\nby Venture. Materials that the taint team finds clearly to be privileged would then be returned to\nNew Venture, with copies provided to the appellants. However, materials that the taint teams finds\nclearly not to be privileged would be provided directly to the investigators and the grand jury, and\nthe appellants would have no opportunity to review those documents. Finally, materials whose\nstatus is unclear in the taint team’s estimation would be submitted by the taint team to the district\ncourt for judicial determination, with copies provided to the appellants.\n        The district court decided in favor of the government’s proposed taint team procedure. The\ncourt also reached a substantive finding, concluding that “any rights created between the parties in\nthis [Separation Agreement] between [Winget] and Venture, do not undercut the grand jury’s right\nto secure evidence from Venture.” The district court framed the issue before it as one primarily of\nsubstance, rather than of procedure:\n         The critical issue is whether Intervenor has a valid attorney-client privilege or work\n         product protection with regard to documents located in Venture’s buildings sought\n         by the subpoenas at issue, and further, if such protections could apply, whether\n         examination of documents at issue should be done initially by the Court, a master\n\n\n\n         3\n           It is not, to be sure, a per se waiver of privilege for one entity to leave privileged materials on the premises\nof another entity. See Schwimmer v. United States, 232 F.2d 855 (8th Cir. 1956). Actual determination of the merits\nof any claim of privilege must await adjudication after the parties have agreed to a subset of documents over which they\ndisagree as to privilege.\n         4\n          No party seems to have offered a concrete procedural mechanism by which the suggested Special Master\nwould segregate privilege documents, nor whether the master would be expected to perform the entire task or just\nportions of it. Although the government opposed the request, it did concede before the trial court that “it would be Uncle\nSam one way in on way [sic] or the other” who paid for the Special Master.\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275              In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                                    Page 6\n\n\n         appointed by the Court . . . , a paralegal in the employ of Intervenor’s counsel, or a\n         government privilege/taint team.\nThus, the district court had it exactly backward: the parties do not presently dispute that there might\nbe material in New Venture’s possession over which the appellants might have a right of privilege.\nThe government explicitly concedes that there may be documents over which appellants hold\nprivilege in New Venture’s offices. Rather, they disagree as to how to determine whether any of\nthese documents are in fact protected by appellants’ privilege. Therefore, the district court’s\nextensive discussion of the agreements and contracts that may or may not have rendered the\ndocuments privileged to the appellants is almost wholly irrelevant to the inquiry properly before us.\nUntil the parties raise concrete substantive disputes over whether particular documents are\nprivileged, which they cannot do until a review of the documents for privilege is undertaken in some\nfashion, the question of privilege is simply not ripe for adjudication.\n         In addition to its alternative holding that we now reverse in its entirety, the district court\nspecifically granted the government’s motion to conduct the privilege review under the aegis of a\ntaint team, holding that any documents that the taint team finds to be privileged “shall be submitted\nto the Court for a final determination. At that point, if the Court determines that the documents\nmight be deserving of attorney client and/or work product protection(s),       the Court will require\nIntervenor to prove that they were not expose[d] to third parties.”5 The district court thus held that\nthe public policy underlying grand jury secrecy and the effective investigation of criminal activity\noutweighed the appellants’ privilege claims.\n                                                             B\n        This controversy requires us to address two rules of our common law inheritance that were\nalready ancient when the Founders drafted the Constitution. In our inquiry, we must first determine\nwhether the grand jury’s investigative authority trumps appellants’ claims of privilege. Answering\nthat question in the negative, we must then discern whether the government’s claim regarding the\nimportance of grand jury secrecy countervails the possible protections of privilege that appellants\nmay enjoy. We also answer that question in the negative. Finally, we will outline a procedure that,\nwe think, appropriately addresses the situation before us.\n        Grand juries have lain at the very heart of our criminal justice system since time\nimmemorial,6 so much so that the founders chose to incorporate the grand jury into our Constitution\nexplicitly. It goes almost without saying that grand juries enjoy a broad delegation of authority to\nconduct investigations. “As a necessary consequence of its investigatory function, the grand jury\n\n         5\n           The court below thus substantially altered the government’s proposal. Whereas the government had proposed\na procedure whereby the taint team would first identify and segregate (a) definitely privileged, (b) definitely not\nprivileged, and (c) questionably privileged documents, providing only the questionably privileged documents to the court\nfor adjudication, the district court effectively ordered that all documents deemed by the taint team to be definitely or\npotentially privileged were to be subject to the court’s independent determination. The court would thus require the\nappellants to prove that documents were actually privileged on a case-by-case basis. As there is no case or controversy\nregarding the substantive adjudication of privilege disputes, we take no position with respect to that portion of the district\ncourt’s original order.\n         6\n           This is literally so, for grand juries, albeit in their relatively inchoate nascence, predate the accession of King\nRichard I in 1189 A.D., which the Statute of Westminster I in 1275 established as the day demarcating “time\nimmemorial” from historical (legal) time. 3 Edw. I. c. 39. See R v. Oxfordshire County Council ex parte Sunningwell\nParish Council, (2000) 1 A.C. 335, 349 (H.L.) (appeal taken from C.A. (Civ. Div.)). See generally, Lipari v. Kawasaki\nKisen Kaisha, Ltd., 923 F.2d 862, 1991 WL 3060 at **3 (9th Cir. Jan. 11, 1991); Grace v. Koch, No. C-90802, 1996\nWL 577843 at *3 n. 7 (Ohio Ct. App. Oct. 9, 1996); Macy v. Ok. City Sch.

R. Enters., Inc., 498 U.S. 292, 297 (1991). As then-\nJudge Kennedy wrote, “[t]he grand jury is, to a degree, an entity independent of the courts, and both\nthe authority and obligation of the courts to control its processes are limited.” In re Grand Jury\nInvestigation of Hugle, 754 F.2d 863, 864 (9th Cir. 1985).\n        Nevertheless, grand juries are not empowered to override private rights in all cases.\nPertinently, we have held that grand juries may not use their investigatory authority “to violate a\nvalid privilege, whether established by the Constitution, statutes, or the common law.” In re Grand\nJury Investigation (Detroit Police Dep’t Special Cash Fund), 922 F.2d 1266, 1269-70 (6th Cir.\n1991) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted) (finding that informant privilege did not\noperate to prohibit witness from testifying to grand jury). Yet, as the assertion of privilege “may\njeopardize an effective and comprehensive investigation into alleged violations of law,” courts must\nensure that the “application of the privilege [does] not exceed that which is necessary to effect the\npolicy considerations underlying the privilege.” In re Grand Jury Investigation No. 83-2-35, 723\nF.2d 447, 451 (6th Cir. 1983). Thus, we have held that the government must make a preliminary\nshowing to justify violating work-product privilege pursuant to a grand jury investigation, In re\nGrand Jury Subpoena Dated Nov. 8, 1979, 622 F.2d 933 (6th Cir. 1980), and that grand juries may\nnot breach a valid psychotherapist-patient privilege. See In re Zuniga, 714 F.2d 632, 639-40 (6th\nCir. 1983). See also In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Maltby), 800 F.2d 981 (9th Cir. 1986) (remanding\nbecause district court failed to rule on claims of attorney-client privilege); Schwimmer v. United\nStates, 232 F.2d 855 (8th Cir. 1956) (authorizing Special Master to make privilege determinations\nin grand jury context so long as attorney had a right of review).\n        The two privileges that all sides concede to be potentially at stake – attorney-client privilege\nand the work-product doctrine – are well-established and integral to the proper functioning of our\nlegal system. The privilege protecting confidential communications between an attorney and his\nclient dates back to the Tudor dynasty at least, although the reasoning behind the early modern\nversion of this privilege was different from, and far narrower than, that espoused in modern times.\nSee Dennis v. Codrington, (1580) 21 Eng. Rep. 53 (Ch.) (regarding a motion to examine a Mr.\nOldsworth, “touching a matter in variance, wherein he hath been of Counsel, it is ordered he shall\nnot be compelled by subpoena or otherwise to be examined upon any matter concerning the same,\nwherein he the said Mr. Oldsworth was of counsel . . . .”); Onbie’s Case, (1642) 82 Eng. Rep. 422\n(K.B.) (“a lawyer who was of counsel may be examined upon oath as to the matter of agreement,\nnot to the validity of an assurance, or to matter of counsel.”). See generally, 8 Wigmore on\nEvidence § 2290 et seq. (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961).\n        The Supreme Court has thus justifiably recognized the attorney-client privilege as “the oldest\nof the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.” Upjohn Co. v. United\nStates, 449 U.S. 383, 389 (1981). The purpose of attorney-client privilege is to ensure free and open\ncommunications between a client and his attorney. See Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391, 403\n(1976) (“Confidential disclosures by a client to an attorney made in order to obtain legal assistance\nare privileged. The purpose of the privilege is to encourage clients to make full disclosure to their\nattorneys.” (citations omitted)); Hunt v. Blackburn, 128 U.S. 464, 470 (1888) (“The rule which\nplaces the seal of secrecy upon communications between client and attorney is founded upon the\nnecessity, in the interest and administration of justice, of the aid of persons having knowledge of the\nlaw and skilled in its practice, which assistance can only be safely and readily availed of when free\nfrom the consequences or the apprehension of disclosure.”).\n        On the other hand, work-product privilege applies solely to attorney work product compiled\nin anticipation of litigation. Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 49, 511 (1947). Work-product privilege,\nwhile properly construed more narrowly than attorney-client privilege, nevertheless operates for a\nsimilar purpose: that is, that people should be free to make requests of their attorneys without fear,\nand that their attorneys should be free to conduct research and prepare litigation strategies without\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275        In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                     Page 8\n\n\nfear that these preparations will be subject to review by outside parties. We apply a five-step\nanalysis to determine whether the doctrine applies, In re Powerhouse Licensing, LLC, 441 F.3d at\n473, though, as noted, that issue is not presently ripe for adjudication.\n         Neither attorney-client nor work-product privilege is absolute, but the government must\nshow sufficient cause for overcoming the privilege. In re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated Nov. 8, 1979,\n622 F.2d at 935-36. The fullest extent of the privileges are not necessarily mandated by the United\nStates Constitution. See United States v. Goldberger & Dubin, P.C., 935 F.2d 501, 504 (2d Cir.\n1991) (“The [attorney-client privilege] doctrine protects only those disclosures that are necessary\nto obtain informed legal advice and that would not be made without the privilege. The privilege\ncannot stand in the face of countervailing law or strong public policy and should be strictly confined\nwithin the narrowest possible limits underlying its purpose.” (citations omitted)). Both privileges\nmay be overridden, for instance, by the so-called crime-fraud exception, encompassing advice given\nwith respect to ongoing or future wrongdoing. However, the Supreme Court has authorized even\nthe mere use of in camera inspections by district judges of privileged documents to ascertain the\napplicability of the crime-fraud exception only when the moving party has made a “showing of a\nfactual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person that in camera review\nof the materials may reveal evidence to establish that the crime-fraud exception applies.” United\nStates v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 572 (1989). Thus, even inspections by the district judge, which do not\ndestroy privilege, require a prior showing that is weakly analogous to probable cause. In the instant\ncase, the government has not suggested that the crime-fraud exception, or any other exception to\nprivilege, is applicable, and, in any case, a government taint team’s review of documents is far\nriskier to the non-moving party’s privilege than is a judge’s in camera review.\n        The government prefers a taint team procedure, whereby its lawyers, behind a protective\nscreen or “Chinese wall,” would sift the documents for privilege. The government argues that grand\njury secrecy requires this procedure, that the appellants’ alternative would present an inexcusable\nintrusion into the grand jury investigative process, and that appellants’ alternative would likely be\nineffective because appellants’ attorneys would have an incentive to drag their feet. The first two\narguments require us to weigh the potential protection of privilege against the potential violation of\ngrand jury secrecy, and we find that the arguments have less merit than the government suggests.\nThe last two arguments are well-taken, however, and so they must be addressed by our remedy.\n         First, the government overstates the role of grand jury secrecy in the present controversy.\nIt has long been recognized that grand juries require a generous zone of secrecy in order to perform\ntheir investigative functions. Although grand jury secrecy did not always go unchallenged, it seems\nto have been well-established long before our independence from Great Britain. As the foreman of\nthe grand jury convened in 1681 for the treason trial of the Earl of Shaftesbury is reported to have\nsaid to the Lord Chief Justice, in response to the justice’s granting of a motion requiring grand jury\nevidence to be heard publicly:\n       My Lord Chief Justice, it is the opinion of the jury, that they ought to examine the\n       witnesses in private, and it hath been the constant practice of our ancestors and\n       predecessors to do it; and they insist upon it as their right to examine in private,\n       because they are bound to keep the king's secrets, which they cannot do, if it be done\n       in court. . . . [I]t is contrary to the sense of what the jury apprehend. First, they\n       apprehend that the very words of the oath doth bind them, it says, “That they shall\n       keep the counsel’s, and their own secrets:” Now, my lord, there can be no secret in\n       public; the very intimation of that doth imply, that the examination should be secret;\n       besides, my lord, I beg your lordship’s pardon if we mistake, we do not understand\n       anything of law.\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275         In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                     Page 9\n\n\nEarl of Shaftesbury’s Trial, (1681) 8 How. St. Tr. 759, 771-74. That ancient rule crossed the\nAtlantic and has been preserved in some fashion since; the federal courts’ modern version is\nestablished by Rule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states that certain\npersons, including government attorneys and grand jurors, “must not disclose a matter occurring\nbefore a grand jury.” Grand jury secrecy is thus a strong command, and federal courts must\nrecognize that, “for the system to function properly, grand jury proceedings must be conducted\nessentially in a vacuum, free from outside influence and sufficiently enveloped so that grand jury\ninformation is not disclosed to the general public.” In re Grand Jury Investigation (90-3-2), 748 F.\nSupp. 1188, 1194 (E.D. Mich. 1990). Moreover, in general, “[a]ny holding that would saddle a\ngrand jury with minitrials and preliminary showings would assuredly impede its investigation and\nfrustrate the public’s interest in the fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws.” United\nStates v. Dionisio, 410 U.S. 1, 17 (1973). Indeed,\n        A grand jury has broad investigative powers to determine whether a crime has been\n        committed and who has committed it. The jurors may act on tips, rumors, evidence\n        offered by the prosecutor, or their own personal knowledge. No grand jury witness\n        is entitled to set limits to the investigation that the grand jury may conduct. And a\n        sufficient basis for an indictment may only emerge at the end of an investigation\n        when all the evidence has been received.\nId. at 15-16 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n        But “[t]his is not to say that a grand jury subpoena is some talisman that dissolves all\nconstitutional protections.” Id. at 11. Although the rules of evidence do not fully operate before the\ngrand jury, “[t]he investigatory powers of the grand jury are nevertheless not unlimited.” United\nStates v. R. Enters., 498 U.S. at 299. While it is certain that matters before a grand jury are protected\nby Criminal Rule 6(e)(2)(B), see Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211 (1979)\n(setting forth general standards for revealing matters occurring before a grand jury); In re Antitrust\nGrand Jury, 805 F.2d 155 (6th Cir. 1986); In re Grand Jury Proceedings Relative to Perl, 838 F.2d\n304, 306 (8th Cir. 1988) (the secrecy rule “is designed to protect from disclosure only the essence\nof what takes place in the grand jury room, in order to preserve the freedom and integrity of the\ndeliberative process”), it is equally certain that not all documents reviewed by a grand jury constitute\n“matters occurring before a grand jury,” within the meaning of Criminal Rule 6. We have\npreviously held that\n        confidential documentary information not otherwise public obtained by the grand\n        jury by coercive means is presumed to be [a] “matter[] occurring before the grand\n        jury” just as much as testimony before the grand jury. The moving party may seek\n        to rebut that presumption by showing that the information is public or was not\n        obtained through coercive means or that disclosure would be otherwise available by\n        civil discovery and would not reveal the nature, scope, or direction of the grand jury\n        inquiry, but it must bear the burden of making that showing . . . .\nIn re Grand Jury Proceedings, 851 F.2d 860, 866-67 (6th Cir. 1988) (alterations added). Thus,\ndocuments prepared by a company for ordinary business purposes become presumptively “matters\noccurring before the grand jury” only if they are obtained by the grand jury through coercion. FDIC\nv. Ernst & Whitney, 921 F.2d 83, 86-87 (6th Cir. 1990). This discovery exception to grand jury\nsecrecy has been interpreted somewhat broadly. In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 196 F.R.D. 57, 62-\n64 (S.D. Ohio 2000); Phillips v. United States, 843 F.2d 438 (11th Cir. 1988); In re Grand Jury\nInvestigation, 630 F.2d 996, 1000 (3d Cir. 1980) (“Documents such as the business records sought\nby the Commission here are created for purposes independent of grand jury investigations, and such\nrecords have many legitimate uses unrelated to the substance of the grand jury proceedings.”);\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275         In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                    Page 10\n\n\nUnited States v. Stanford, 589 F.2d 285, 291 (7th Cir. 1978) (“Unless [sought] information reveals\nsomething about the grand jury proceedings, secrecy is unnecessary”).\n       Here, the government does not contend that the appellants would not have had the\nopportunity to review for privilege documents responsive to the subpoenas if the grand jury’s\nsubpoena had been directed to them instead of New Venture. Nor can the government claim that\nthe appellants would not have had independent access in the ordinary course of business to the\ndocuments in question. We therefore believe that the discovery exception to the secrecy requirement\nwould apply. Moreover, the appellants are not necessarily demanding access to the entire set of\ndocuments responsive to the subpoena; rather, they seek only to conduct a privilege review of\ndocuments that contain the names of particular lawyers, law firms, and other entities. The marginal\nincrease in the risk that the appellants could divine or reverse-engineer the grand jury’s investigative\npurpose by reviewing a set of their own documents that involved some sort of communication\nbetween them and their counsel seems to us to be minimal at best.\n        Yet the taint team procedure would present a great risk to the appellants’ continued\nenjoyment of privilege protections. In the first place, government taint teams seem to be used\nprimarily in limited, exigent circumstances in which government officials have already obtained the\nphysical control of potentially-privileged documents through the exercise of a search warrant. In\nsuch cases, the potentially-privileged documents are already in the government’s possession, and\nso the use of the taint team to sift the wheat from the chaff constitutes an action respectful of, rather\nthan injurious to, the protection of privilege. See United States v. Abbell, 914 F. Supp. 519 (S.D.\nFla. 1995) (after seizing law firm documents through a search warrant, the government employed\na taint team to determine privilege; however, court appointed a special master to review the\ndocuments, with costs charged to the government). But the government does not actually possess\nthe potentially-privileged materials here, so the exigency typically underlying the use of taint teams\nis not present.\n        Furthermore, taint teams present inevitable, and reasonably foreseeable, risks to privilege,\nfor they have been implicated in the past in leaks of confidential information to prosecutors. That\nis to say, the government taint team may have an interest in preserving privilege, but it also\npossesses a conflicting interest in pursuing the investigation, and, human nature being what it is,\noccasionally some taint-team attorneys will make mistakes or violate their ethical obligations. It is\nthus logical to suppose that taint teams pose a serious risk to holders of privilege, and this\nsupposition is substantiated by past experience. In United States v. Noriega, 764 F. Supp. 1480\n(S.D. Fla. 1991), for instance, the government’s taint team missed a document obviously protected\nby attorney-client privilege, by turning over tapes of attorney-client conversations to members of\nthe investigating team. This Noriega incident points to an obvious flaw in the taint team procedure:\nthe government’s fox is left in charge of the appellants’ henhouse, and may err by neglect or malice,\nas well as by honest differences of opinion.\n        It is reasonable to presume that the government’s taint team might have a more restrictive\nview of privilege than appellants’ attorneys. But under the taint team procedure, appellants’\nattorneys would have an opportunity to assert privilege only over those documents which the taint\nteam has identified as being clearly or possibly privileged. As such, we do not see any check in the\nproposed taint team review procedure against the possibility that the government’s team might make\nsome false negative conclusions, finding validly privileged documents to be otherwise; that is to say,\nwe can find no check against Type II errors in the government’s proposed procedure. On the other\nhand, under the appellants’ proposal, which incidentally seems to follow a fairly conventional\nprivilege review procedure employed by law firms in response to discovery requests, the\ngovernment would still enjoy the opportunity to challenge any documents that appellants’ attorneys\nmisidentify (via the commission of Type I errors) as privileged. We thus find that, under these\ncircumstances, the possible damage to the appellants’ interest in protecting privilege exceeds the\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275        In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                  Page 11\n\n\npossible damage to the government’s interest in grand jury secrecy and exigency in this case.\nTherefore, we reverse the district court, and hold that the use of a government taint team is\ninappropriate in the present circumstances. Instead, we hold that the appellants themselves must be\ngiven an opportunity to conduct their own privilege review; of course, we can presently make no\nruling with respect to the merits of any claimed privilege that may arise therefrom.\n        Finally, the government argues that the appellants’ proposal would allow them to delay the\nproceedings in an unreasonable manner that could threaten the grand jury investigation. This stance\nhas some obvious merit, for the targets of a grand jury investigation would logically have an interest\nin delaying matters. However, we do not think this is necessarily dispositive, for the appellants have\nasked only to conduct a privilege review of the subset of documents that contain names of attorneys\nor law firms that they will place on a list that will then be provided to the government. Therefore,\nassuming this “first cut” proceeds apace, the government should obtain the bulk of the responsive\ndocuments rather quickly.\n        To ensure that the first cut does, in fact, proceed in a timely fashion, and to address in\naddition the government’s legitimate interest in preventing the appellants from themselves reviewing\nthe entire set of subpoenaed documents, we mandate that the district court employ a Special Master\nto perform this first segregation of documents. The Special Master should conduct a word search\nof the documents, searching for those words contained in the list to be provided by the appellants\nand approved by the district court, and should then separate documents containing any of those\nwords from the rest. As this is done, the master should provide appellants with copies of the\ndocuments containing any of the words on appellants’ list, returning the originals to New Venture’s\noffices, and provide the responsive documents not containing any of the list’s words to the grand\njury. As we have been led to believe that this first cut would be merely mechanical in nature, we\nhope that the Special Master should be able to perform the task rather quickly, thereby ensuring that\nthe grand jury receives the bulk of the responsive documents in short order, and we think that the\nmaster’s production should be done on a rolling basis if practical. Appellants would then be\nauthorized to conduct a privilege review of the documents given to them by the Special Master. As\nthis review progresses, appellants should provide all documents that their attorneys find not to be\nprivileged, as well as a standard privilege log respecting documents over which they claim privilege\nprotection, on a timely and rolling basis to the grand jury. This log should contain summary\ninformation, as well as some intelligible explanation of their privilege claims, for each document.\n        Finally, while we think it would be appropriate to charge the appellants for the Special\nMaster’s services, as they would themselves have been responsible for the costs in the ordinary\ncourse, we leave it to the district court’s sound discretion to determine and enforce proper\nprocedures for implementing our remedy. Moreover, we note that the district court retains its\ninherent authority to adjudicate legitimate disputes that may arise over issues such as, inter alia,\ncost, timing, the identity and makeup of the Special Master’s team, and the word lists. As there\nremains a legitimate concern regarding the possibility of unreasonable delays, we remind the\nappellants that the district court also possesses the authority to issue reasonable deadlines within\nwhich particular review tasks must be completed, and to sanction them, or their attorneys, or both,\nfor failure to meet those deadlines.\n                                                 III\n         For the reasons noted above, we REVERSE the district court’s order, MANDATE that the\ndistrict court institute a procedure whereby a Special Master will conduct the first mechanical review\nof the implicated documents, and the appellants will then conduct a privilege review of the\ndocuments provided to them; and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings consistent\nwith our opinion.\n\f",

These two cases, filed under seal, present a legal question regarding\nthe conduct of reviews of documents for privilege.1 Specifically, we must determine who has the\nright to conduct a review for privilege of documents subject to a grand jury subpoena directed to a\nthird party who possesses the documents but has not yet produced them to the government: the\ntargets of the investigation whose rights of privilege are potentially implicated, or the federal\ngovernment, operating a “taint team” behind a “Chinese wall” or protective screen.\n\n\n        *\n           The Honorable William W Schwarzer, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California,\nsitting by designation.\n        1\n            As the two cases present essentially identical issues of law and fact, we will address them together.\n\n\n                                                            1\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275        In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                   Page 2\n\n\n         These cases arise from events leading up to the 2003 bankruptcy filing of Venture Holdings\nLLC (“Venture”), a company once controlled by appellant Larry Winget. After Venture’s new\n(post-filing) management conducted an internal investigation, the company filed suit against Winget\nfor allegedly fraudulent conveyances of goods and services from Venture to other entities that\nWinget owned or controlled. Shortly thereafter, a federal grand jury issued two subpoenas duces\ntecum, filed under seal, to Venture. Winget filed a motion to intervene, and seven companies\naffiliated with Winget (the “Affiliated Companies”) later joined this motion. The documents in\nquestion have not been examined by any of the parties, and they remain in locations under Venture’s\ncontrol. Winget and the Affiliated Companies demanded the right to conduct their own privilege\nreview of the documents responsive to the subpoenas, as both the government and Venture are\nactually or possibly litigation opponents of Winget’s or the Affiliated Companies’. The government\nopposed this motion, and asserted that any privilege review be conducted by its own “taint team.”\nThe district court granted Winget’s and the Affiliated Companies’ motions to intervene, but agreed\nwith the government with respect to the “taint team” review procedure. The district court issued an\nalternative holding that Winget had also failed to meet the threshold requirement of showing any\nrights of privilege in the requested documents. For the reasons stated below, we reverse and remand.\n                                                  I\n        The circumstances leading to the instant controversy are sufficiently convoluted to require\nsome summary description despite the fact that the documents in the suit remain under seal. Larry\nWinget was once the sole owner of Venture, a global automotive supplier, and had served as its\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer. Winget also owned or controlled numerous other\ncompanies, including the Affiliated Companies. The headquarters of Venture and of each of the\nAffiliated Companies were located in the same office in Fraser, Michigan.\n       In 1999, Venture purchased a German company called Peguform. In October 2002, a\nGerman court declared Peguform insolvent under Germany’s bankruptcy regime. This threatened\nVenture’s solvency and caused a group of bank creditors to assert more control over the company.\nConsequently, Joseph Day was installed as a director in January 2003. Venture then filed for\nbankruptcy on March 28, 2003 under Chapter 11 in the Eastern District of Michigan. At the same\ntime, Day replaced Winget as Venture’s Chief Executive Officer. Six months later, on September\n22, 2003, Winget and Venture entered into a Contribution Agreement (“Contribution Agreement”),\nwhereby several entities owned by Winget and certain of his affiliates would transfer their assets and\nownership to a new company that would be formed in connection with Venture’s reorganization.\n       Also in September 2003, Venture’s new management hired an accounting firm to conduct\na forensic audit of related-party transactions between Venture and some of the many companies\nassociated with Winget. In March 2004, Venture’s auditors concluded that Venture had in the past\npaid millions of dollars to some Winget-owned or -controlled companies for products and services\nwhose fair market value was allegedly substantially less than the price paid, which would have\ncontradicted certain statements in Venture’s SEC filings during the relevant years. The auditors’\nconclusions remain untested, and we will not venture to assess their accuracy.\n        On April 5, 2004, as part of the bankruptcy proceedings, Venture and its official committee\nof unsecured creditors filed a still-pending civil suit against Winget, some of his family members,\nand numerous associated entities, asserting claims of unjust enrichment, breaches of fiduciary duties,\nand fraudulent transfers arising from Venture’s payment of funds to Winget’s affiliated companies.\nVenture v. Winget, Adversary Proc. 04-4374, In re Venture Holdings Company LLC, No. 03-48939\n(Bankr. E.D. Mich.). On May 13, 2004, Venture and Winget signed a Separation Agreement\n(“Separation Agreement”), whereby Winget agreed to terminate his employment by Venture and\nresign as officer and director. In exchange, he was to receive $50,000 every month while Venture\nremained under Chapter 11 protection, and he was further entitled to “continue the exclusive,\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275        In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                       Page 3\n\n\nuninterrupted use of the office which he currently occupies” at James J. Pompo Drive. This\nagreement forms part of the substantive basis for Winget’s claims to privilege in the instant case,\nbut we are in no position now to assess its substance or legal effect because the instant controversy\ninvolves a matter that is logically antecedent to the substance of any privilege disputes.\n        On January 21, 2005, the bankruptcy court rejected Venture’s proposed reorganization plan,\nand, therefore, the Contribution Agreement as well. On April 8, 2005, with an April 29 amendment,\nNew Venture Holdings LLC (“New Venture”) was formed by Venture’s pre-petition lenders, who\nagreed to buy the assets and assume the liabilities of (old) Venture and nine other companies owned\nor controlled by Winget that had filed for Chapter 11 in May 2004. The bankruptcy court\nsubsequently approved this transaction. On May 2, 2005, (old) Venture and the nine affiliated\ncompanies formally transferred their assets and liabilities to New Venture. In October 2005, New\nVenture changed its name to Cadence Innovation LLC.\n        Meanwhile, the federal government began investigating the matter. In the fall of 2004, a\nnumber of grand jury subpoenas duces tecum were issued. Relevantly to the case at hand, New\nVenture received two such subpoenas, and the company soon agreed to cooperate with the federal\ninvestigation, waiving its corporate attorney-client and work-product privileges in October 2004.\nAs the subpoenas in question were filed under seal, and as their precise substance is not particularly\nrelevant to the instant controversy, we will respect grand jury secrecy and exercise our discretion\nby not discussing their contents. Instead, we simply note that the subpoenas were directed to New\nVenture, and they demanded production of some documents that, all sides concede, may be\nprotected by either Winget’s or the Affiliated Companies’ attorney-client or work-product\nprivileges.\n        On March 1, 2005, Winget filed a motion in the Eastern District of Michigan to intervene\nand to modify the subpoenas in order to preserve privilege. In this motion, he claimed that some of\nthe records that New Venture had been called upon to produce were protected by Winget’s personal\nattorney-client or work-product privileges even though the documents remained in offices under\nVenture’s control. Winget therefore asked the court to approve a procedure, described in greater\ndetail below, whereby his attorneys would conduct a privilege review of the responsive documents.\nOn April 29, 2005, the Affiliated Companies filed a motion to join Winget’s intervention, arguing\nthat the subpoenas called for documents that could be protected by their corporate attorney-client\nand work-product privileges.\n       The government opposed Winget’s motion, claiming that he was\n       requesting this Court to allow him to insert himself into the middle of a grand jury\n       investigation so that he can be the first to screen documents produced . . . in response\n       to the two subpoenas. . . . [S]uch a procedure would subvert the orderly functioning\n       of the grand jury process and would be, to the best of the government’s knowledge,\n       unprecedented.\n(emphasis in original). Instead, the government proposed that a “taint team” composed of\ngovernment attorneys who are not involved in the grand jury investigation be established to\nsegregate privileged documents from the residue of non-privileged material. As we discuss more\nextensively below, the proposed taint team would return to Venture any documents that it\ndetermined to be privileged, sending copies to Winget where appropriate, and would submit the\nmaterials it determined to be potentially protected by privilege to Winget and the district court for\nfinal adjudication. However, the taint team would send documents it deemed not to be protected by\nappellants’ privilege directly to the grand jury, and so they would not provide appellants with any\nopportunity to review or challenge the team’s privilege determinations with respect to those\ndocuments.\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275         In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                       Page 4\n\n\n         The district court conducted a closed hearing on August 3, 2003. At this hearing, the court\nsternly questioned the parties regarding the legal merit of any privilege claims, and criticized Winget\nand the Affiliated Companies for failing to provide a log that detailed specific documents that they\nclaimed to be privileged. It is not clear how they could have done so, for it is certain that neither\nWinget, nor the Affiliated Companies, nor even the government, has yet had any access to the\nsubpoenaed documents. On September 7, the district court issued an order denying Winget’s\nrequested relief, and approved instead the government’s proposed taint team. The court issued an\nalternative ruling wherein it held that the appellants had failed to meet their burden of proving that\none or more of them held a privilege over the documents. Winget and the Affiliated Companies\nfiled a timely notice of appeal.\n                                                    II\n        The appellants essentially moved to “modify” the grand jury subpoenas, Fed. R. Crim. P.\n17(c)(2), see Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(d)(2), and the resulting discovery order is immediately appealable.\nSee In re Subpoena Duces Tecum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186648\"><a href=\"/opinion/186648/subpoena-duces-tecum/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 743 (D.C.

As the district court rested its opinion on legal grounds alone, we review that decision\nde novo. Moreover, to the extent that the court below reached a substantive judgment regarding the\nwaiver of attorney-client privilege, we also review that decision de novo. In re Powerhouse\nLicensing, LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793682\"><a href=\"/opinion/793682/in-re-powerhouse-licensing-llc-powerhouse-marks-llc-dabish-family-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">441</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (6th Cir. 2006).\n        The only question before us is whether the district court erred in preferring the government’s\nproposed taint team to the appellants’ own attorneys to make initial privilege determinations with\nrespect to documents in the third-party subpoena recipient’s possession. We have not been asked\nto determine whether any of these documents are actually privileged, and the time is clearly not ripe\nto adjudicate the merits of any potential privilege claims. Instead, our duty here is to determine the\nlogically antecedent issue as to which party – the government or the appellants – has the right to\nconduct a privilege screen of documents responsive to a grand jury subpoena issued to a third party.\nThe government in fact concedes that some of the documents responsive to the subpoena may be\nprotected by appellants’ privilege, does not challenge the appellants’ general rights of privilege, and\ndoes not seem to contest that the appellants would have had the right to conduct their own privilege\nreview had the subpoena been directed to them instead of New Venture. Instead, the government\ncomplains that allowing the appellants’ own attorneys to conduct a privilege review of the\nsubpoenaed documents at New Venture would interfere with a government investigation and\nundermine grand jury secrecy. This controversy thus calls for us to weigh, to some degree, grand\njury investigations and grand jury secrecy against attorney-client and work-product privilege.\n                                                    A\n       In the first step of the appellants’ proposed procedure,2 their own counsel would provide the\ngovernment and New Venture with a “list of the law firms, attorneys, and agents” who represented\nthem. Then, a paralegal retained by appellants’ counsel would review the implicated documents in\n\n\n\n        2\n        Winget proposed this procedure in his motion to intervene docketed on March 1, 2005. The Affiliated\nCompanies joined in that motion, and in the requested procedure, in their motion filed on April 28, 2005.\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275             In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                                  Page 5\n\n\noffices controlled by New Venture,3 and segregate those documents that had been “authored by,\nreceived by, copied to, or that mention anyone identified on the list” from the remainder. Third, the\nappellants’ attorneys would review “copies of the segregated documents and prepare a privilege log\nfor any documents that [appellants] claim as privileged.” The appellants would thus create a log\ndocumenting materials for which they claim the protection of privilege, and this log would\npresumably include sufficient information about the privilege claims that the government could\nintelligently evaluate appellants’ assertions by reviewing the log. Finally, “the parties would bring\nany privilege disputes before the Court.” This seems to reflect a fairly standard practice by which\nlaw firms conduct privilege reviews when responding to government subpoenas or other discovery\nrequests.

Alternatively, the 4appellants request that the district court\nappoint a Special Master to conduct the privilege review.\n        While the government obviously has an interest in assisting the grand jury’s investigation,\nthe government also has a genuine, if conflicting, interest in preventing investigators from accessing\nprivileged materials. Indeed, the government concedes that the leaking of privileged materials to\ninvestigators would raise the spectre of Kastigar-like evidentiary hearings, see Kastigar v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108541\"><a href=\"/opinion/108541/kastigar-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972), and argues that it would therefore act conservatively, and err on the side\nof caution, in assessing the existence of privilege and in screening privileged documents from\ninvestigators. In the government’s proposed procedure, a taint team consisting of at least one\nAssistant United States Attorney (from the same Eastern District of Michigan office as the\nprosecutors) and at least one Postal Inspector would review for privilege all documents produced\nby Venture. Materials that the taint team finds clearly to be privileged would then be returned to\nNew Venture, with copies provided to the appellants. However, materials that the taint teams finds\nclearly not to be privileged would be provided directly to the investigators and the grand jury, and\nthe appellants would have no opportunity to review those documents. Finally, materials whose\nstatus is unclear in the taint team’s estimation would be submitted by the taint team to the district\ncourt for judicial determination, with copies provided to the appellants.\n        The district court decided in favor of the government’s proposed taint team procedure. The\ncourt also reached a substantive finding, concluding that “any rights created between the parties in\nthis [Separation Agreement] between [Winget] and Venture, do not undercut the grand jury’s right\nto secure evidence from Venture.” The district court framed the issue before it as one primarily of\nsubstance, rather than of procedure:\n         The critical issue is whether Intervenor has a valid attorney-client privilege or work\n         product protection with regard to documents located in Venture’s buildings sought\n         by the subpoenas at issue, and further, if such protections could apply, whether\n         examination of documents at issue should be done initially by the Court, a master\n\n\n\n         3\n           It is not, to be sure, a per se waiver of privilege for one entity to leave privileged materials on the premises\nof another entity. See Schwimmer v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"239326\"><a href=\"/opinion/239326/harry-i-schwimmer-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">855</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1956). Actual determination of the merits\nof any claim of privilege must await adjudication after the parties have agreed to a subset of documents over which they\ndisagree as to privilege.\n         4\n          No party seems to have offered a concrete procedural mechanism by which the suggested Special Master\nwould segregate privilege documents, nor whether the master would be expected to perform the entire task or just\nportions of it. Although the government opposed the request, it did concede before the trial court that “it would be Uncle\nSam one way in on way [sic] or the other” who paid for the Special Master.\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275              In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                                    Page 6\n\n\n         appointed by the Court . . . , a paralegal in the employ of Intervenor’s counsel, or a\n         government privilege/taint team.\nThus, the district court had it exactly backward: the parties do not presently dispute that there might\nbe material in New Venture’s possession over which the appellants might have a right of privilege.\nThe government explicitly concedes that there may be documents over which appellants hold\nprivilege in New Venture’s offices. Rather, they disagree as to how to determine whether any of\nthese documents are in fact protected by appellants’ privilege. Therefore, the district court’s\nextensive discussion of the agreements and contracts that may or may not have rendered the\ndocuments privileged to the appellants is almost wholly irrelevant to the inquiry properly before us.\nUntil the parties raise concrete substantive disputes over whether particular documents are\nprivileged, which they cannot do until a review of the documents for privilege is undertaken in some\nfashion, the question of privilege is simply not ripe for adjudication.\n         In addition to its alternative holding that we now reverse in its entirety, the district court\nspecifically granted the government’s motion to conduct the privilege review under the aegis of a\ntaint team, holding that any documents that the taint team finds to be privileged “shall be submitted\nto the Court for a final determination. At that point, if the Court determines that the documents\nmight be deserving of attorney client and/or work product protection(s),       the Court will require\nIntervenor to prove that they were not expose[d] to third parties.”5 The district court thus held that\nthe public policy underlying grand jury secrecy and the effective investigation of criminal activity\noutweighed the appellants’ privilege claims.\n                                                             B\n        This controversy requires us to address two rules of our common law inheritance that were\nalready ancient when the Founders drafted the Constitution. In our inquiry, we must first determine\nwhether the grand jury’s investigative authority trumps appellants’ claims of privilege. Answering\nthat question in the negative, we must then discern whether the government’s claim regarding the\nimportance of grand jury secrecy countervails the possible protections of privilege that appellants\nmay enjoy. We also answer that question in the negative. Finally, we will outline a procedure that,\nwe think, appropriately addresses the situation before us.\n        Grand juries have lain at the very heart of our criminal justice system since time\nimmemorial,6 so much so that the founders chose to incorporate the grand jury into our Constitution\nexplicitly. It goes almost without saying that grand juries enjoy a broad delegation of authority to\nconduct investigations. “As a necessary consequence of its investigatory function, the grand jury\n\n         5\n           The court below thus substantially altered the government’s proposal. Whereas the government had proposed\na procedure whereby the taint team would first identify and segregate (a) definitely privileged, (b) definitely not\nprivileged, and (c) questionably privileged documents, providing only the questionably privileged documents to the court\nfor adjudication, the district court effectively ordered that all documents deemed by the taint team to be definitely or\npotentially privileged were to be subject to the court’s independent determination. The court would thus require the\nappellants to prove that documents were actually privileged on a case-by-case basis. As there is no case or controversy\nregarding the substantive adjudication of privilege disputes, we take no position with respect to that portion of the district\ncourt’s original order.\n         6\n           This is literally so, for grand juries, albeit in their relatively inchoate nascence, predate the accession of King\nRichard I in 1189 A.D., which the Statute of Westminster I in 1275 established as the day demarcating “time\nimmemorial” from historical (legal) time. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Edw.

The privilege protecting confidential communications between an attorney and his\nclient dates back to the Tudor dynasty at least, although the reasoning behind the early modern\nversion of this privilege was different from, and far narrower than, that espoused in modern times.\nSee Dennis v. Codrington, (1580) 21 Eng. Rep. 53 (Ch.) (regarding a motion to examine a Mr.\nOldsworth, “touching a matter in variance, wherein he hath been of Counsel, it is ordered he shall\nnot be compelled by subpoena or otherwise to be examined upon any matter concerning the same,\nwherein he the said Mr. Oldsworth was of counsel . . . .”); Onbie’s Case, (1642) 82 Eng. Rep. 422\n(K.B.) (“a lawyer who was of counsel may be examined upon oath as to the matter of agreement,\nnot to the validity of an assurance, or to matter of counsel.”). See generally, 8 Wigmore on\nEvidence § 2290 et seq. (McNaughton rev. ed. 1961).\n        The Supreme Court has thus justifiably recognized the attorney-client privilege as “the oldest\nof the privileges for confidential communications known to the common law.” Upjohn Co. v. United\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110374\"><a href=\"/opinion/110374/upjohn-co-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 389 (1981).

In re Grand Jury Subpoena Dated Nov. 8, 1979,\n622 F.2d at 935-36. The fullest extent of the privileges are not necessarily mandated by the United\nStates Constitution. See United States v. Goldberger & Dubin, P.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"562620\"><a href=\"/opinion/562620/united-states-v-goldberger-dubin-pc-paul-a-goldberger-lawrence-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">935</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 504 (2d Cir.\n1991) (“The [attorney-client privilege] doctrine protects only those disclosures that are necessary\nto obtain informed legal advice and that would not be made without the privilege. The privilege\ncannot stand in the face of countervailing law or strong public policy and should be strictly confined\nwithin the narrowest possible limits underlying its purpose.” (citations omitted)). Both privileges\nmay be overridden, for instance, by the so-called crime-fraud exception, encompassing advice given\nwith respect to ongoing or future wrongdoing. However, the Supreme Court has authorized even\nthe mere use of in camera inspections by district judges of privileged documents to ascertain the\napplicability of the crime-fraud exception only when the moving party has made a “showing of a\nfactual basis adequate to support a good faith belief by a reasonable person that in camera review\nof the materials may reveal evidence to establish that the crime-fraud exception applies.” United\nStates v. Zolin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112308\"><a href=\"/opinion/112308/united-states-v-zolin/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 572 (1989). Thus, even inspections by the district judge, which do not\ndestroy privilege, require a prior showing that is weakly analogous to probable cause. In the instant\ncase, the government has not suggested that the crime-fraud exception, or any other exception to\nprivilege, is applicable, and, in any case, a government taint team’s review of documents is far\nriskier to the non-moving party’s privilege than is a judge’s in camera review.\n        The government prefers a taint team procedure, whereby its lawyers, behind a protective\nscreen or “Chinese wall,” would sift the documents for privilege. The government argues that grand\njury secrecy requires this procedure, that the appellants’ alternative would present an inexcusable\nintrusion into the grand jury investigative process, and that appellants’ alternative would likely be\nineffective because appellants’ attorneys would have an incentive to drag their feet. The first two\narguments require us to weigh the potential protection of privilege against the potential violation of\ngrand jury secrecy, and we find that the arguments have less merit than the government suggests.\nThe last two arguments are well-taken, however, and so they must be addressed by our remedy.\n         First, the government overstates the role of grand jury secrecy in the present controversy.\nIt has long been recognized that grand juries require a generous zone of secrecy in order to perform\ntheir investigative functions. Although grand jury secrecy did not always go unchallenged, it seems\nto have been well-established long before our independence from Great Britain. As the foreman of\nthe grand jury convened in 1681 for the treason trial of the Earl of Shaftesbury is reported to have\nsaid to the Lord Chief Justice, in response to the justice’s granting of a motion requiring grand jury\nevidence to be heard publicly:\n       My Lord Chief Justice, it is the opinion of the jury, that they ought to examine the\n       witnesses in private, and it hath been the constant practice of our ancestors and\n       predecessors to do it; and they insist upon it as their right to examine in private,\n       because they are bound to keep the king's secrets, which they cannot do, if it be done\n       in court. . . . [I]t is contrary to the sense of what the jury apprehend. First, they\n       apprehend that the very words of the oath doth bind them, it says, “That they shall\n       keep the counsel’s, and their own secrets:” Now, my lord, there can be no secret in\n       public; the very intimation of that doth imply, that the examination should be secret;\n       besides, my lord, I beg your lordship’s pardon if we mistake, we do not understand\n       anything of law.\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275         In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                     Page 9\n\n\nEarl of Shaftesbury’s Trial, (1681) 8 How. St. Tr. 759, 771-74. That ancient rule crossed the\nAtlantic and has been preserved in some fashion since; the federal courts’ modern version is\nestablished by Rule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which states that certain\npersons, including government attorneys and grand jurors, “must not disclose a matter occurring\nbefore a grand jury.” Grand jury secrecy is thus a strong command, and federal courts must\nrecognize that, “for the system to function properly, grand jury proceedings must be conducted\nessentially in a vacuum, free from outside influence and sufficiently enveloped so that grand jury\ninformation is not disclosed to the general public.” In re Grand Jury Investigation (90-3-2), 748 F.\nSupp. 1188, 1194 (E.D. Mich. 1990). Moreover, in general, “[a]ny holding that would saddle a\ngrand jury with minitrials and preliminary showings would assuredly impede its investigation and\nfrustrate the public’s interest in the fair and expeditious administration of the criminal laws.” United\nStates v. Dionisio, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108709\"><a href=\"/opinion/108709/united-states-v-dionisio/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1973). Indeed,\n        A grand jury has broad investigative powers to determine whether a crime has been\n        committed and who has committed it. The jurors may act on tips, rumors, evidence\n        offered by the prosecutor, or their own personal knowledge. No grand jury witness\n        is entitled to set limits to the investigation that the grand jury may conduct. And a\n        sufficient basis for an indictment may only emerge at the end of an investigation\n        when all the evidence has been received.\nId. at 15-16 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n        But “[t]his is not to say that a grand jury subpoena is some talisman that dissolves all\nconstitutional protections.” Id. at 11.

Nor can the government claim that\nthe appellants would not have had independent access in the ordinary course of business to the\ndocuments in question. We therefore believe that the discovery exception to the secrecy requirement\nwould apply. Moreover, the appellants are not necessarily demanding access to the entire set of\ndocuments responsive to the subpoena; rather, they seek only to conduct a privilege review of\ndocuments that contain the names of particular lawyers, law firms, and other entities. The marginal\nincrease in the risk that the appellants could divine or reverse-engineer the grand jury’s investigative\npurpose by reviewing a set of their own documents that involved some sort of communication\nbetween them and their counsel seems to us to be minimal at best.\n        Yet the taint team procedure would present a great risk to the appellants’ continued\nenjoyment of privilege protections. In the first place, government taint teams seem to be used\nprimarily in limited, exigent circumstances in which government officials have already obtained the\nphysical control of potentially-privileged documents through the exercise of a search warrant. In\nsuch cases, the potentially-privileged documents are already in the government’s possession, and\nso the use of the taint team to sift the wheat from the chaff constitutes an action respectful of, rather\nthan injurious to, the protection of privilege. See United States v. Abbell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2130919\"><a href=\"/opinion/2130919/united-states-v-abbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">914</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D.\nFla. 1995) (after seizing law firm documents through a search warrant, the government employed\na taint team to determine privilege; however, court appointed a special master to review the\ndocuments, with costs charged to the government). But the government does not actually possess\nthe potentially-privileged materials here, so the exigency typically underlying the use of taint teams\nis not present.\n        Furthermore, taint teams present inevitable, and reasonably foreseeable, risks to privilege,\nfor they have been implicated in the past in leaks of confidential information to prosecutors. That\nis to say, the government taint team may have an interest in preserving privilege, but it also\npossesses a conflicting interest in pursuing the investigation, and, human nature being what it is,\noccasionally some taint-team attorneys will make mistakes or violate their ethical obligations. It is\nthus logical to suppose that taint teams pose a serious risk to holders of privilege, and this\nsupposition is substantiated by past experience. In United States v. Noriega, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2286866\"><a href=\"/opinion/2286866/united-states-v-noriega/\"><span class=\"volume\">764</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(S.D. Fla. 1991), for instance, the government’s taint team missed a document obviously protected\nby attorney-client privilege, by turning over tapes of attorney-client conversations to members of\nthe investigating team. This Noriega incident points to an obvious flaw in the taint team procedure:\nthe government’s fox is left in charge of the appellants’ henhouse, and may err by neglect or malice,\nas well as by honest differences of opinion.\n        It is reasonable to presume that the government’s taint team might have a more restrictive\nview of privilege than appellants’ attorneys. But under the taint team procedure, appellants’\nattorneys would have an opportunity to assert privilege only over those documents which the taint\nteam has identified as being clearly or possibly privileged. As such, we do not see any check in the\nproposed taint team review procedure against the possibility that the government’s team might make\nsome false negative conclusions, finding validly privileged documents to be otherwise; that is to say,\nwe can find no check against Type II errors in the government’s proposed procedure. On the other\nhand, under the appellants’ proposal, which incidentally seems to follow a fairly conventional\nprivilege review procedure employed by law firms in response to discovery requests, the\ngovernment would still enjoy the opportunity to challenge any documents that appellants’ attorneys\nmisidentify (via the commission of Type I errors) as privileged. We thus find that, under these\ncircumstances, the possible damage to the appellants’ interest in protecting privilege exceeds the\n\fNos. 05-2274/2275        In re Grand Jury Subpoenas 04-124-03 and 04-124-05                  Page 11\n\n\npossible damage to the government’s interest in grand jury secrecy and exigency in this case.\nTherefore, we reverse the district court, and hold that the use of a government taint team is\ninappropriate in the present circumstances. Instead, we hold that the appellants themselves must be\ngiven an opportunity to conduct their own privilege review; of course, we can presently make no\nruling with respect to the merits of any claimed privilege that may arise therefrom.\n        Finally, the government argues that the appellants’ proposal would allow them to delay the\nproceedings in an unreasonable manner that could threaten the grand jury investigation. This stance\nhas some obvious merit, for the targets of a grand jury investigation would logically have an interest\nin delaying matters. However, we do not think this is necessarily dispositive, for the appellants have\nasked only to conduct a privilege review of the subset of documents that contain names of attorneys\nor law firms that they will place on a list that will then be provided to the government. Therefore,\nassuming this “first cut” proceeds apace, the government should obtain the bulk of the responsive\ndocuments rather quickly.\n        To ensure that the first cut does, in fact, proceed in a timely fashion, and to address in\naddition the government’s legitimate interest in preventing the appellants from themselves reviewing\nthe entire set of subpoenaed documents, we mandate that the district court employ a Special Master\nto perform this first segregation of documents. The Special Master should conduct a word search\nof the documents, searching for those words contained in the list to be provided by the appellants\nand approved by the district court, and should then separate documents containing any of those\nwords from the rest. As this is done, the master should provide appellants with copies of the\ndocuments containing any of the words on appellants’ list, returning the originals to New Venture’s\noffices, and provide the responsive documents not containing any of the list’s words to the grand\njury. As we have been led to believe that this first cut would be merely mechanical in nature, we\nhope that the Special Master should be able to perform the task rather quickly, thereby ensuring that\nthe grand jury receives the bulk of the responsive documents in short order, and we think that the\nmaster’s production should be done on a rolling basis if practical. Appellants would then be\nauthorized to conduct a privilege review of the documents given to them by the Special Master. As\nthis review progresses, appellants should provide all documents that their attorneys find not to be\nprivileged, as well as a standard privilege log respecting documents over which they claim privilege\nprotection, on a timely and rolling basis to the grand jury. This log should contain summary\ninformation, as well as some intelligible explanation of their privilege claims, for each document.\n        Finally, while we think it would be appropriate to charge the appellants for the Special\nMaster’s services, as they would themselves have been responsible for the costs in the ordinary\ncourse, we leave it to the district court’s sound discretion to determine and enforce proper\nprocedures for implementing our remedy. Moreover, we note that the district court retains its\ninherent authority to adjudicate legitimate disputes that may arise over issues such as, inter alia,\ncost, timing, the identity and makeup of the Special Master’s team, and the word lists. As there\nremains a legitimate concern regarding the possibility of unreasonable delays, we remind the\nappellants that the district court also possesses the authority to issue reasonable deadlines within\nwhich particular review tasks must be completed, and to sanction them, or their attorneys, or both,\nfor failure to meet those deadlines.\n                                                 III\n         For the reasons noted above, we REVERSE the district court’s order, MANDATE that the\ndistrict court institute a procedure whereby a Special Master will conduct the first mechanical review\nof the implicated documents, and the appellants will then conduct a privilege review of the\ndocuments provided to them; and REMAND to the district court for further proceedings consistent\nwith our opinion.\n\f</pre>",
