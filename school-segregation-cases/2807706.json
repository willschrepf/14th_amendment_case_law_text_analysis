AP-76,924\n\n\n\n                         STEVEN LAWAYNE NELSON, Appellant\n\n                                                 v.\n\n                                   THE STATE OF TEXAS\n\n                   ON APPEAL FROM CAUSE NUMBER 1232507D\n               IN THE CRIMINAL DISTRICT COURT NUMBER FOUR\n                         OF TARRANT COUNTY, TEXAS\n\n                K ELLER, P.J., delivered the opinion of the unanimous Court.\n\n       On March 3, 2011, Appellant, a twenty-four-year-old Dallas County probationer, entered\n\nNorthPointe Baptist Church in Arlington, assaulted and suffocated its pastor, Clinton “Clint”\n\nDobson, and assaulted its secretary, Judy Elliot. While there, appellant stole Dobson’s laptop, a\n\ncellphone, Elliot’s credit cards, and Elliot’s car. Appellant was charged with capital murder by\n\nintentionally causing Dobson’s death in the course of committing or attempting to commit the\n\noffense of robbery. A jury found appellant guilty of capital murder and answered the special issues\n\nso that appellant was sentenced to death. Appeal to this court is automatic.1 Appellant raises fifteen\n\n\n       1\n           TEX . CODE CRIM . PROC. art. 37.071, §2(h).\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 2\n\npoints of error. Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                   A. Discovery of the Victims\n\n       Members of NorthPointe Baptist Church described the events surrounding the discovery of\n\nClint Dobson and Judy Elliot. Church member Dale Harwell had plans to meet Dobson for lunch.\n\nWhen Dobson did not arrive at the appointed time, Harwell tried unsuccessfully to contact him.\n\nDebra Jenkins went to NorthPointe at around 12:40, where she saw Dobson’s and Elliot’s cars in the\n\nparking lot. Jenkins rang the doorbell and called the church office but received no answer, so she\n\nleft after about five minutes. She returned fifteen minutes later, and Elliot’s car, a Galant, was no\n\nlonger in the parking lot. At 1:00 p.m., another church member, Suzanne Richards, arrived for a\n\nmeeting with Dobson. His car was in the parking lot, but Elliot’s was not. Richards waited for half\n\nof an hour, ringing the doorbell, calling, and texting Dobson.\n\n       Meanwhile, Clint Dobson’s wife, Laura, called Jake Turner, the part-time music minister,\n\nbecause she had been unable to reach her husband by phone. Turner agreed to go to the church, and\n\nhe called Judy Elliott’s husband John, who promptly drove to the church. John entered the church\n\nusing his passcode and called out Dobson’s name. John saw Dobson’s office in disarray and saw\n\na severely beaten woman, whom he did not immediately recognize as his wife, lying on the ground.\n\nHe did not notice Dobson lying on the other side of the desk. John called the police.\n\n       Arlington police officer Jesse Parrish responded to the call. He noticed signs of a struggle,\n\nincluding blood and what appeared to be a grip plate of a pistol. Elliot was lying on her back with\n\nher hands bound behind her. John recognized his wife by her clothing. Parrish found Dobson lying\n\nface-up with his hands bound behind his back. A bloody plastic bag was covering his head and\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 3\n\nsucked into his mouth. Upon lifting the plastic bag off of his head, Parrish knew that Dobson was\n\ndead.\n\n        Elliot was taken to the hospital in critical condition. She had a heart attack while there and\n\nneither the physicians nor John believed she would survive. She had traumatic injuries to her face,\n\nhead, arms, legs, and back and internal bleeding in her brain. She was in the hospital for two weeks\n\nand underwent five months of therapy and rehabilitation. A permanent fixture of mesh, screws, and\n\nother metal holds her face together. At the time of trial, Elliot still had physical and mental\n\nimpairments from the attack.\n\n        Doctor Nizam Peerwani, medical examiner for Tarrant County, testified that the manner of\n\nDobson’s death was homicide. Dobson’s injuries indicated a violent altercation during which he\n\nattempted to shield himself from blows from an object such as the butt of a firearm. Two wounds\n\nto his forehead appeared to be from the computer monitor stand in the office. According to Dr.\n\nPeerwani, the injuries indicated that Dobson was standing when he was first struck in the head and\n\nthat he was struck in the back of his head as he fell. After he had fallen to the ground and lost\n\nconsciousness, his hands were tied behind his back, and the bag was placed over his head. With the\n\nbag over his head, he suffocated and died.\n\n                            B. Appellant’s Actions after the Murder\n\n        Appellant texted Whitley Daniels at 1:24 p.m., and Daniels told him to bring her a cigar.\n\nAfter stopping at his apartment, appellant drove Elliot’s car to a Tire King store, where a customer\n\nbought Dobson’s laptop and case out of the trunk of the Galant. At around 2:00 p.m., appellant\n\ndrove to a Tetco convenience store, where he used Elliot’s credit card to buy gas, a drink, and a\n\ncigar. Anthony “AG” Springs’ girlfriend brought AG to the Tetco. When appellant tried to buy gas\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 4\n\nfor her car, the card was declined. Appellant and AG drove in Elliot’s car to the apartment of Claude\n\n“Twist” Jefferson and Jefferson’s aunt Brittany Bursey.\n\n       Daniels testified that appellant and AG arrived at her house with the cigar some time after\n\n3:00 p.m. Appellant and AG soon left, but appellant returned alone fifteen or twenty minutes later.\n\nAppellant asked Daniels to go to the mall and use her identification with the credit cards. She\n\ndeclined to do so, and appellant left.\n\n       Appellant went to The Parks at Arlington mall. Using Elliot’s credit cards at Sheikh Shoes,\n\nhe purchased a t-shirt featuring the Sesame Street character Oscar the Grouch, and Air Max shoes.\n\nHe also used the cards to buy costume jewelry at Jewelry Hut and Silver Gallery. Appellant later\n\nreturned to Sheikh Shoes with two companions, but a second attempt to use the credit card was not\n\napproved.\n\n       Appellant returned to Bursey’s apartment that evening with AG and Twist. Appellant was\n\nwearing the shirt, jewelry, and shoes that he had bought with Elliot’s cards. While taking pills and\n\nsmoking, he told Bursey that he had stolen the Galant from a pastor. Appellant left Bursey’s\n\napartment the next morning.\n\n       The next day, Appellant sent a series of text messages. One asked to see the recipient\n\nbecause “[i]t might be the last time.” Another said, “Say, I might need to come up there to stay. I\n\ndid some shit the other day, Cuz.” A third said, “I fucked up bad, Cuz, real bad.”\n\n       Tracey Nixon, who had dated appellant off and on, picked him up the day after the murder\n\nat a gas station on Brown Boulevard. Appellant wore the t-shirt and some of the jewelry that he had\n\nbought with Elliot’s cards. After going to a Dallas nightclub, appellant spent the night with Nixon,\n\nwho returned appellant to Brown Boulevard the next morning.\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 5\n\n                                    C. Investigation and Arrest\n\n        Officers obtained an arrest warrant and arrested appellant at Nixon’s apartment on March 5.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, appellant was wearing the tennis shoes and some of the jewelry he brought\n\nwith Elliot’s stolen credit cards. He was also wearing a black belt with metal studs. The shoes, belt,\n\nphone, and jewelry were seized during appellant’s jail book-in.\n\n        Officers seized other items from appellant’s apartment pursuant to a search warrant. They\n\nrecovered a pair of black and green Nike Air Jordan tennis shoes that appeared to match a bloody\n\nshoe print at NorthPointe, the New Orleans Saints jersey seen on the mall surveillance videos, a gold\n\nchain necklace, a pair of men’s silver earrings with diamond-like stones, a Nike Air Max shoe box,\n\na Sheikh Shoes shopping bag, a Sesame Street price tag, a Jimmy Jazz business card, and receipts\n\ndated March 3 from several of the stores. Officers found Dobson’s identification cards, insurance\n\ncards, and credit cards in Elliot’s car.\n\n        DNA from Dobson and from Elliot was discovered in a stain on appellant’s shoe.\n\nAppellant’s fingerprints were lifted from the wrist rest on Dobson’s desk, from receipts, and from\n\nsome of the items from the mall.\n\n        A trace-evidence analyst detected similarities between appellant’s shoe and a bloody shoe\n\nprint on an envelope in Dobson’s office. Appellant’s belt appeared to be missing studs, and similar\n\nstuds were recovered from the office. According to a firearms expert, the plastic grip panel found\n\nin Dobson’s office came from a 15XT Daisy air gun, which is a CO2-charged semiautomatic BB gun\n\nmodeled on a Colt firearm. The jury saw a BB gun manufactured from the same master mold and\n\nheard from a text message read into the record that appellant was seeking to buy a gun just days\n\nbefore the killing.\n\f                                                                                         NELSON — 6\n\n                                       D. Defense Testimony\n\n       Appellant testified on his own behalf. According to him, from about 11:30 p.m. on March\n\n2, until 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. on March 3, he and three companions were looking for people to rob. They\n\nhad firearms. Appellant went home for a while in the morning but later joined up with AG and\n\nTwist. Appellant claimed that he waited outside the church while AG and Twist went in. Twenty-\n\nfive minutes later, he went inside and saw the victims on the ground. They were bleeding from the\n\nbacks of their heads, but they were still alive. Appellant then took the laptop and case. According\n\nto appellant, AG gave him keys and credit cards. Appellant waited in Elliot’s car for a while and\n\nthen returned to Dobson’s office. By that time, the man was dead. Appellant could not stand the\n\nsmell, so he returned to Elliot’s car. He drove the group to his apartment, retrieved a CD and his\n\nNew Orleans Saints jersey, and continued to Bursey’s apartment, where they smoked marijuana.\n\nAppellant then left Bursey’s apartment in Elliot's car.\n\n       Appellant testified that he knew people were inside the church and that he agreed to rob\n\nthem. He claimed that he did not intend to hurt anyone and had no part in what happened inside of\n\nthe church. He also acknowledged making the purchases at Tetco and buying the items at the mall.\n\n       Appellant testified to having several prior convictions.\n\n                           II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n                                               A. Guilt\n\n       In his sixth point of error, appellant alleges that the evidence is legally insufficient to support\n\na finding of guilty of capital murder. At the conclusion of the guilt phase, appellant moved for a\n\ndirected verdict of not guilty. The trial court denied the motion.\n\n       In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view all of the evidence in the light most\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 7\n\nfavorable to the verdict to determine whether, based on that evidence and the reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom, a rational factfinder could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.2\n\n       Appellant calls our attention to four items—a tape, two tape swabs, and an electrical\n\ncord—that were tested for DNA. A State’s witness testified that she found on these items a mixture\n\nof DNA profiles. The major contributor on the tape and the tape swabs was Elliott. The major\n\ncontributor on the electrical cord was Dobson. Appellant was excluded as a contributor of the DNA\n\non all four items. He claims that the lack of his DNA on these items from the scene exculpated him\n\nand he argues that it renders the evidence legally insufficient to support the conviction.\n\n       Appellant fails to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. Given the\n\nevidence elsewhere detailed in this opinion, the evidence of appellant’s guilt is not rendered\n\ninsufficient by the fact that DNA testing fails to connect him to four items of evidence. A rational\n\njury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant intentionally and knowingly caused\n\nDobson’s death while in the course of committing or attempting to commit robbery. Appellant’s\n\nsixth point of error is overruled.\n\n                                     B. Future Dangerousness\n\n       In appellant’s second issue, he claims that the evidence was legally insufficient to support\n\nthe jury’s verdict with respect to the future-dangerousness special issue and that the imposition of\n\na death sentence in this case was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n                                       1. Standard of Review\n\n\n\n       2\n        Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979); Gear v. State, 340 S.W.3d 743, 746 (Tex.\nCrim. App. 2011).\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 8\n\n       After finding appellant guilty of capital murder, the jury must decide “whether there is a\n\nprobability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a\n\ncontinuing threat to society.”3 In assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding\n\nof future dangerousness, this Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury’s\n\nfinding and determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat there is a probability that the defendant would commit crimes of violence that would constitute\n\na continuing threat to society.4 The jury is the exclusive judge of the facts.5 We assume that the\n\nfactfinder resolved conflicts in the evidence in favor of the verdict reached and defer to that\n\nresolution.6\n\n       In deciding the issue of future dangerousness, the factors that a jury may consider include,\n\nbut are not limited to: (1) the circumstances of the capital offense, including the defendant’s state\n\nof mind and whether he was acting alone or with other parties; (2) the calculated nature of the\n\ndefendant’s acts; (3) the forethought and deliberateness exhibited by the crime’s execution; (4) the\n\nexistence of a prior criminal record and the severity of the prior crimes; (5) the defendant’s age and\n\npersonal circumstances at the time of the offense; (6) whether the defendant was acting under duress\n\nor the domination of another at the time of the commission of the offense; (7) psychiatric evidence;\n\nand (8) character evidence.7 No one factor is dispositive, and an affirmative answer to the special\n\n       3\n           TEX .

The State’s Punishment Evidence\n\n       Evidence was introduced during the punishment phase regarding appellant’s youth history\n\nin and out of institutions in Oklahoma and Texas, his adult criminal history, and his infractions while\n\nincarcerated.\n\n                                   a. Youth History in Oklahoma\n\n       Appellant began getting into trouble with Oklahoma juvenile authorities when he was six\n\nyears old. His juvenile career included property crimes, burglaries, and thefts. Despite efforts by\n\nOklahoma authorities to place him in counseling and on probation, appellant was incarcerated in that\n\nstate at a young age because he continued to commit felonies. According to Ronnie Meeks, an\n\nOklahoma Juvenile Affairs employee who worked with appellant, this was “quite alarming.”\n\n       Appellant was sent to a detention center in Oklahoma for high-risk juveniles. On one\n\noccasion, while Meeks was driving appellant to the facility for diagnostic services, appellant fled\n\nfrom Meeks’ pickup truck. He was apprehended a few minutes later. At the facility, appellant was\n\ndisruptive and tried to escape. After a few weeks, appellant was sent to a group home in Norman,\n\nOklahoma, for counseling. There, appellant did not fare well. He was disruptive and did not try to\n\nmake any improvements.\n\n       When Meeks needed cooperation from appellant’s mother, she was available. Appellant\n\nnever appeared to Meeks to be in need of anything; his mother appeared to be providing enough.\n\n       Meeks testified that, in addition to being uncooperative with the efforts in Oklahoma to\n\n\n       8\n           Dinkins v. State, 894 S.W.2d 330, 358 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 10\n\nprovide services and to rehabilitate appellant, appellant never exhibited any remorse about any of\n\nhis actions.\n\n                                     b. Youth Offenses in Texas\n\n        Appellant was also involved in the Texas juvenile justice system through the Tarrant County\n\nprobation office. Mary Kelleher, of that office, first had contact with appellant in April 2000, when\n\nhe was thirteen years old. The police referred appellant to her for having committed aggravated\n\nassault with a deadly weapon. Kelleher worked with appellant during a time when he was pulling\n\nfire alarms, was truant, and was declining in school performance. In December 2001, the police\n\ndepartment again referred appellant to Kelleher for multiple charges, including burglaries of a\n\nhabitation, criminal trespass of a habitation, and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. After the\n\ndepartment was notified that appellant was a runaway, the juvenile court detained him until all of\n\nthe charges were disposed.\n\n        The Tarrant County juvenile court adjudicated appellant, then fourteen years old, for burglary\n\nof a habitation and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. He was committed to the Texas Youth\n\nCommission (“TYC”) for an indeterminate period. According to Kelleher, it is unusual for a\n\njuvenile to be committed to TYC for property crimes at that age, but appellent's history made him\n\na rare case.\n\n        Kelleher testified that appellant had family support from his mother but none from his father.\n\nAppellant’s mother was neither abusive nor neglectful. According to appellant’s mother, his two\n\nsiblings went to college and did not get into trouble. Appellant indicated to Kelleher that he knew\n\nhis actions were wrong, but he acted out of impulse and boredom, without an exact reason.\n\n        Appellant was a “chronic serious offender.” While in TYC, appellant had four of the\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 11\n\nhighest-level disciplinary hearings and was repeatedly placed in the behavior-management plan.\n\nAppellant was originally sent to TYC for nine months, but he spent over three and a half years\n\nconfined because of his infractions. This sentence for a burglary adjudication was an extraordinarily\n\nlengthy time to spend in TYC. He eventually made parole, had his parole revoked, and returned to\n\nTYC.\n\n       Appellant was paroled from TYC a second time. On his second parole, when appellant was\n\ntwenty years old, he again did not comply with the terms, even after counseling. His parole officer\n\nissued a directive to apprehend appellant for these violations, but he “aged out” of the juvenile\n\nsystem before he could be picked up, allowing him to remain unapprehended.\n\n                                 c. Adult Arrests and Convictions\n\n       In 2005, appellant, then eighteen years old, was stopped while driving a stolen car. The\n\nofficer who arrested him concluded that appellant was “a compulsive liar.”\n\n       Video evidence and testimony from November 30, 2007, showed Appellant in a Wal-Mart\n\nstock room posing as an associate from a different store. Appellant put a laptop computer down his\n\npants and then walked to the exit. The following week, appellant was apprehended at a separate\n\nArlington Wal-Mart for putting on new boots off the shelf and leaving the store without paying.\n\n       After being released from state jail in 2010, appellant assaulted his live-in girlfriend, Sarina\n\nDaniels. When Sarina ran outside after an argument, appellant caught her and dragged her inside.\n\nWhen she tried to call 9-1-1, he broke her telephone. Appellant bound Sarina with duct tape and\n\ntried to have her stand on a trash bag so her blood would not get on the carpet. He held a knife to\n\nher throat while holding her by the hair and made her apologize for talking to another man while\n\nappellant was incarcerated. Appellant pulled the knife away and told Sarina that he was not going\n\f                                                                                    NELSON — 12\n\nto kill her. He then grabbed her by the throat, pushed her onto a dresser, and said, “But if you do it\n\nagain, then I will.” Appellant then choked Sarina. Sarina filed charges, and appellant was arrested.\n\n       For this aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, appellant was placed on probation and sent\n\nto a ninety-day program at the Intermediate Sanctions Facility (“ISF”) in Burnet. Sherry Price, a\n\nDallas County probation officer, told appellant to report as soon as he was released from the\n\nprogram, which appellant failed to do. After appellant failed to report as directed, Price told him to\n\nreport to her on March 3. He did not report, and hours later, he killed Clint Dobson.\n\n                                      d. Early Jail Infractions\n\n       Appellant was classified as an assaultive inmate in the Tarrant County Jail while awaiting\n\ntrial. For a time, he was in restrictive housing, but he nevertheless committed numerous serious\n\ndisciplinary infractions. Among other things, appellant broke a telephone in the visitation booth and\n\nthen threatened the responding officer. After one altercation with a guard, it took three officers to\n\nsubdue appellant. One officer’s foot was fractured. In another incident, appellant refused to return\n\nto his cell. Three officers tried to escort him to his cell, but appellant stood in his cell door to\n\nprevent it shutting. When officer Kent Williams reached in to slide the door shut, appellant grabbed\n\nhim, struck him in the face, pulled him into his cell, and threw him on the desk and into a wall.\n\n       Appellant was also combative with other inmates and, on at least one occasion, was complicit\n\nin arranging for a bag filled with feces and urine to be placed in another inmate’s cell. After\n\nappellant was assigned to a tank for problematic inmates, he broke the lights in his cell.\n\n       On February 22, 2012, appellant broke multiple fire-sprinkler heads and flooded the day\n\nroom. The jury saw photographs and video of this, including appellant dancing in the water. Six\n\nofficers restrained him. Breaking the sprinkler heads triggered the fire alarm in the whole jail.\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 13\n\n                                   e. Killing of Jonathon Holden\n\n       On March 19, 2012, while appellant was in the Tarrant County jail awaiting trial in this case,\n\nhe killed Jonathon Holden, a mentally challenged inmate. According to a fellow inmate who\n\nwitnessed the incident, Holden had angered inmates when he mentioned “the N word under his\n\nvoice.” Appellant was in the day room of the holding area, and he talked Holden into faking a\n\nsuicide attempt to cause Holden to be moved to a different part of the jail. Holden came to the cell\n\nbars, and appellant looped a blanket around Holden’s neck. Appellant tightened the blanket by\n\nbracing his feet on the bars and pulling with both hands on the blanket. Holden’s back was against\n\nthe bars and he was being pulled up almost off his feet. It took four minutes for Holden to die.\n\nAfterwards, appellant did a “celebration dance” in the style of Chuck Berry, “where he hops on one\n\nfoot and plays the guitar.” Appellant used a broom stick, which he had previously used to poke\n\nanother mentally challenged inmate in the eye, as a guitar.\n\n                                f. Jail Infractions while Segregated.\n\n       Following Holden’s death, Appellant was assigned to a single-man, self-contained cell for\n\ndangerous and violent inmates. On April 22, 2012, officers found contraband, such as a broom\n\nhandle and extra rolls of toilet tissue, in appellant’s cell. In May 2012, a search of appellant’s cell\n\nyielded a bag of prescription drugs.\n\n       On July 20, 2012, a few weeks before trial, appellant damaged jail property in a two-hour-\n\nlong incident, of which the jury saw security footage and heard testimony. While in a segregation\n\ncell, appellant blocked the window with wet toilet paper. He then flooded his cell. Ultimately, the\n\nofficers had to use pepper spray to subdue appellant. Officers in protective gear restrained appellant\n\nand took him to the decontamination shower. During this time, appellant rapped and sang. While\n\f                                                                                    NELSON — 14\n\nhis own cell was decontaminated, appellant flooded the toilet in the holdover cell. He brandished\n\na shank made from a plastic spoon. When he was being returned to his cell, appellant fought and\n\nthreatened the officers. They ultimately placed him in a restraint chair, a process that took eight\n\nofficers. This disturbance took about seventy percent of the jail’s manpower. Sergeant Kevin\n\nChambliss, who testified about the incident, had to request back-up personnel from another facility.\n\n       On August 23, 2012, on a day of voir dire proceedings, appellant cracked one of the jail’s\n\nwindows and chipped off paint with his belly chain while in the jail gym. He showed no remorse.\n\nAppellant’s dangerous activity continued after the guilt phase of trial. After the jury’s verdict was\n\nread, while appellant was in a holdover cell, he ripped the stun cuff off of his leg. Again, he showed\n\nno remorse. During trial, while appellant was being escorted from the jail to the courtroom, he tried\n\nto move his cuffs from behind his back multiple times. During the punishment phase, officers found\n\nthree razor blades inside letters addressed to appellant, along with other contraband items.\n\n                                        g. Prior Convictions\n\n       Appellant’s prior convictions comprised failure to identify, unauthorized use of a motor\n\nvehicle, burglary of a building, and numerous thefts.\n\n                                        3. Defense Evidence\n\n       The defense put on a forensic psychologist, Doctor Antoinette McGarrahan. She testified\n\nthat, although appellant had no current learning disability or cognitive impairment, he had a past\n\nhistory of learning disabilities. Dr. McGarrahan explained that, when, as a three-year-old, appellant\n\nset fire to his mother’s bed with intent to cause harm, it was essentially a cry for attention and\n\nsecurity. She believed that there was “something significantly wrong with [appellant’s] brain being\n\nwired in a different way, being predisposed to this severe aggressive and violence from a very early\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 15\n\nage.” She testified that, by the time appellant was six years old, he had had at least three EEGs,\n\nmeaning that people were already “looking to the brain for an explanation” of his behavior. The test\n\nresults did not indicate a seizure disorder, but Dr. McGarrahan said that they did not rule out\n\nappellant having one. Risk factors present in appellant’s life included having ADHD, a mother who\n\nworked two jobs, an absent father, verbal abuse, and witnessing domestic violence.\n\n        Appellant spoke about two alter egos, “Tank” and ‘Rico.” Dr. McGarrahan did not believe\n\nthat appellant had dissociative-identity disorder; rather, these alter egos were a way to avoid taking\n\nresponsibility for his actions.\n\n        Dr. McGarrahan acknowledged on cross-examination that appellant likes violence and has\n\na thrill for violence and that it is emotionally pleasing to him. She said he is “criminally versatile,”\n\nand she agreed that characteristics of antisocial personality disorder describe him. According to her,\n\npeople with antisocial personality disorder have trouble following the rules of society and repeatedly\n\nengage in behavior that is grounds for arrest. They are consistently and persistently irresponsible and\n\nimpulsive; they tend to lie, steal, and cheat. Appellant has many characteristics of a psychopath—\n\nincluding a grandiose sense of self, a lack of empathy, and a failure to take responsibility. Generally,\n\nsuch a person prefers to lie, cheat, and steal to get by.\n\n                                            4. Conclusion\n\n        The evidence in the present case amply supports a finding of future dangerousness.\n\nAppellant has a long history of bad behavior, both inside and outside a confinement setting. The\n\nworst of this behavior includes not only the capital murder charged in the present case but also the\n\nkilling of a mentally challenged inmate while appellant’s capital murder charges were pending.\n\nAppellant’s second point of error is overruled.\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 16\n\n                                          III. VOIR DIRE\n\n                               A. Exemptions and Disqualifications\n\n        In appellant’s eighth point of error, he claims that the trial court erred by denying his motion\n\nthat the trial judge preside over potential juror claims of exemptions or disqualifications.\n\n        Appellant filed motions requesting that the trial court summon a special venire and arguing\n\nthat a court administrator or designee could not hear excuses and disqualifications of potential\n\njurors.9 The trial court denied these motions but later agreed to reconsider the motions and held a\n\npretrial hearing. At the hearing, the jury bailiff for Tarrant County, Paula Morales, testified that she\n\nis in charge of sending out the jury summonses to prospective jurors. August 2, 2012—the day that\n\nthe venire panel for appellant’s case met—would have been a normal day. The trial judge informed\n\nMorales that he needed a large panel. Morales summoned around 1,300 people to appear on August\n\n2. Normally, she would summon at least 400, and the most she would ever summon would be about\n\n1500. Only some of the jurors called for August 2 would be assigned to appellant’s trial. The others\n\nwould be assigned to other courts. Appellant argued that, because the normal procedure was altered\n\nto call in more jurors, it amounted to a special venire. The trial court again denied the motions.\n\n        The Government Code allows a court’s designee to hear excuses and exemptions under\n\ncertain circumstances.10 In large counties, it is common for courts to gather a general assembly, have\n\nthe court’s designee review the exemptions and disqualifications of members of the assembly, and\n\n\n\n\n       9\n            See TEX . CODE CRIM . PROC. arts 34.01, 35.03.\n       10\n            TEX .

The\n\nmere fact that a large number of jurors is summoned to jury service does not mean that the venire\n\nis a special venire. The general assembly portion of jury selection was not part of appellant’s trial,\n\nand appellant was not entitled to be present.15 This specific type of panel selection has been\n\napproved by this court.16 The trial judge was not required to preside over exemptions and\n\nqualifications. Appellant’s eighth point of error is overruled.\n\n             B. Authorization of the Visiting Judge to Conduct Individual Voir Dire\n\n        In his first point of error, appellant contends that the trial court violated Article 5, Section 7,\n\n\n       11\n           43 GEORGE E.

Judicial Districts\n\n       The courts of the state lie within administrative judicial regions.17 The presiding judge of an\n\nadministrative judicial region assigns “the judges of the administrative region to hold special or\n\nregular terms of court in any county of the administrative region to try cases and dispose of\n\naccumulated business.”18\n\n                                             2. Procedure\n\n       The Honorable Jeff Walker, Presiding Judge of the 8th Administrative Region, signed an\n\norder on August 1, 2012, assigning Elizabeth Berry, former judge, to the Criminal District Number\n\nFour beginning on August 2.19 Among other things, the order stated:\n\n\n       17\n            TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 74.042.\n       18\n            Id. § 74.056(a).\n       19\n            The August 1 order reads, in its entirety:\n\n               Pursuant to Section 74.056, Texas Government Code, I assign the Honorable\n       Elizabeth Berry, Former Judge of the Criminal District No. 3 to the Criminal District\n       Court No. 4 of Tarrant County, Texas.\n               The judge is assigned for a period of 1 days, beginning August 2nd, 2012. If\n       the judge begins a trial on the merits during the period of this assignment, the\n       assignment continues in such case until plenary jurisdiction has expired or the\n       undersigned Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in writing, whichever\n       occurs first.\n               It is ordered that the Clerk of the Court to which this assignment made, if it\n       is reasonable and practicable, and if time permits, give notice of this assignment to\n       each attorney representing a party to a case that is to be heard in whole or in part by\n       the assigned judge.\n               It is further ordered that the Clerk, upon receipt hereof, shall post a copy of\n       this order in a public area of the Clerk’s office or courthouse so that attorneys and\n       parties may be advised of this assignment.\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 19\n\n       The judge is assigned for a period of 1 days, beginning August 2nd, 2012. If the\n       judge begins a trial on the merits during the period of this assignment, the assignment\n       continues in such case until plenary jurisdiction has expired or the undersigned\n       Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in writing, whichever occurs first.\n\nOn August 2, appellant was arraigned, and Judge Berry heard the qualifications and exemptions for\n\nthe prospective jurors. Individual voir dire began on August 13, 2012, and continued for the next\n\nfour days. Appellant moved for mistrial on August 20, 2012.\n\n       Appellant called Presiding Judge Walker as a witness and introduced four orders by which\n\nJudge Walker assigned Judge Berry, including the August 2nd order. Judge Walker testified that,\n\nwhen he appoints a judge to a court, it is for “[w]hatever is on the docket for the day” and that Judge\n\nBerry “can do any case that comes before her on that date.” Judge Walker testified that the other\n\nthree orders were for payment purposes, and they did not re-appoint Judge Berry to the case because\n\nshe was already assigned to the case. Notably, he said that trial on the merits does not mean when\n\nthe jury is seated and when jeopardy attaches, but “it means everything. . . . [t]he whole shootin’\n\nmatch.”\n\n       Appellant argues that Judge Walker was wrong about the meaning of “trial on the merits”\n\nin the context of the order. Appellant points out that jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury\n\nis empaneled and sworn. His position is that the trial on the merits, therefore, did not begin in this\n\ncase until the jury was empaneled and sworn. Because trial on the merits had not begun during the\n\ntime that Judge Berry presided over voir dire, he claims that the “trial on the merits” language in the\n\norder was inadequate to continue Judge Berry’s appointment past August 2.\n\n       We disagree. Appellant does not explain why double-jeopardy concepts have any bearing\n\n\n                Signed, Jeff Walker, Presiding Judge, 8th Administrative Judicial Region of\n       Texas.\n\f                                                                                        NELSON — 20\n\non what “trial on the merits” meant in the context of the order, and we see no reason that they would.\n\nJudge Walker intended to assign Judge Berry for “the whole shootin’ match” and the order\n\naccomplished that design.20 Appellant’s first point of error is overruled.\n\n                                          C. Batson challenge\n\n        In appellant’s fifth point of error, he claims that the trial court violated the Equal Protection\n\nClause by overruling his Batson21 objections to the State’s peremptory strikes of two minority venire\n\nmembers.\n\n        A Batson challenge involves three steps: (1) there must be a prima facie showing that a venire\n\nmember was peremptorily excluded on the basis of race; (2) the striking party must then tender a\n\nrace-neutral reason for the strike; and (3) if a race-neutral reason is tendered, the trial court must then\n\ndetermine whether the objecting party has proved purposeful discrimination.22 The trial court’s\n\nruling on a Batson challenge is sustained on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.23 This highly\n\ndeferential standard is employed because the trial court is in the best position to determine whether\n\nthe State’s justification is actually race-neutral.24 A defendant’s failure to offer rebuttal to a\n\nprosecutor’s race-neutral explanation can be fatal to defendant’s claim.25\n\n        Appellant raised a Batson challenge regarding five venire members. The trial court found\n\n\n        20\n          The State also argues that appellant failed to preserve this claim for review. We need not\naddress this argument because we reject appellant’s claim on the merits.\n        21\n             Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\n        22\n             476 U.S. at 97-98; Blackman v. State, 414 S.W.3d 757, 764 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013).\n        23\n             Nieto v. State, 365 S.W.3d 673, 676 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012).\n        24\n             Id.\n        25\n             Johnson v. State, 68 S.W.3d 644, 649 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n\f                                                                                   NELSON — 21\n\nthat he had made a prima facie case, so the burden shifted to the State to tender race-neutral\n\nexplanations. The State noted which black and Hispanic minority members were struck by the\n\ndefense, then proffered explanations for the five challenged venire members: Venire member Spivey\n\nslept during instructions from the bench and denied arrests that the State was aware of, claimed that\n\nhe did not want to serve on the trial because he did not believe appellant could get a fair trial,\n\nexplained that he did not want to sit around on jury service without being paid overtime, and\n\nindicated that he had trouble sitting in judgment of other people. Venire member Lee-Moses\n\nindicated that she was not in favor of the death penalty and could not assess the death penalty\n\nregardless of the facts or circumstances of the case. She also would have problems with a\n\n“circumstantial case,” and she believed the death penalty had been used unfairly in the past. Venire\n\nmember Southichack indicated that she has a problem judging. She was not in favor of the death\n\npenalty, and she did not believe it should ever be invoked. She seemed to the prosecutors to have\n\ndifficulty with the legal issues related to the special issues. She also said she would have trouble\n\nanswering question number two “yes” if she believed appellant was not the trigger person. Venire\n\nmember Hooper Golightly belonged to a church that was opposed to the death penalty, and she did\n\nnot disagree with that position. She was not in favor of the death penalty, and she thought it should\n\nnever be invoked. Venire member Mays served on a trial that resulted in a mistrial. She thought the\n\ndeath penalty should never be invoked, and it was not on the top of her list for a possible\n\npunishment.\n\n       The trial court found that the State “offered reasonable, race-neutral reasons” for its\n\nperemptory strikes against the challenged members. Appellant then pointed out that three of the\n\nmembers that the State exercised peremptory strikes on were not challenged for cause, and said “the\n\f                                                                                       NELSON — 22\n\nrecord speaks for itself.”\n\n        Appellant failed to rebut the State’s race-neutral reasons for its strikes, and the record\n\nsupports the trial court’s determination that the State did not engage in purposeful discrimination.\n\nHis fifth point of error is overruled.\n\n                 D. Possible Prospective Jurors Seeing Appellant Wearing Chains.\n\n        In his ninth point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred by overruling his\n\nobjection that he was escorted to the courtroom wearing chains in view of prospective jurors. On\n\nAugust 2, 2012, the venire assembled in the central jury room. Appellant’s counsel told the trial\n\ncourt that, while appellant was being escorted from the holdover cell, appellant was dressed in\n\ncivilian clothes and “wearing chains around his legs and wearing chains which [were] visible around\n\nhis arms.” According to defense counsel, four or five prospective jurors were in the lobby, and at\n\nleast one looked at the group accompanying appellant. Counsel could not tell if the prospective\n\njurors were for appellant’s trial.\n\n        We have held that requiring an accused person to wear handcuffs before the jury infringes\n\nhis constitutional presumption of innocence.26 However, “a momentary, inadvertent, and fortuitous\n\nencounter away from the courtroom between a handcuffed accused and one or more of the jurors\n\ndoes not necessarily call for a mistrial or reversal.”27 Here, appellant could not even say whether the\n\nvenire members who were encountered outside the courtroom were for appellant’s case, nor did he\n\nrequest an opportunity to determine that. Moreover, it appears that the encounter between appellant\n\nand the individuals outside the central jury room was a momentary, inadvertent, and fortuitous\n\n\n        26\n             Clark v.

Appellant’s ninth issue is overruled.\n\n                                  IV. EVIDENTIARY ISSUES\n\n                                A. Relationship with Tracey Nixon\n\n       In appellant’s third issue, he complains about the admission at the guilt phase of trial, during\n\nthe testimony of Tracey Nixon, of text messages from his cell phone. He contends that the text\n\nmessages were inadmissible because they showed that he had a sexual relationship with another man,\n\nwhich would constitute an extraneous bad act. He further contends that the State had no need for\n\nthe evidence and that the unfair prejudice substantially outweighed any minimal probative value.\n\n       Tracey Nixon is a man who dresses and presents as a woman.28 Nixon testified in a hearing\n\noutside the presence of the jury that he had dated appellant periodically for about two years and had\n\ngiven appellant the phone that was seized during appellant’s arrest, as well as setting up the account\n\nfor that phone. The State sought to introduce text messages to and from the phone and argued that\n\nthe text messages were relevant to establish time line and identity.\n\n       Appellant objected to some of the contents of the text messages on the basis that they\n\nincluded extraneous matters—“drugs, as well as homosexuality.” The State agreed to excise the\n\nreferences to drugs but contended that the relationship between appellant and the witness was a\n\nlegitimate matter of inquiry.\n\n       In front of the jury, the State questioned Nixon briefly about his relationship with appellant.\n\nThis questioning established that Nixon and appellant “were on and off dating” for two years. Nixon\n\nacknowledged that he and appellant were “very close.” This questioning did not bring up Nixon’s\n\ngender or the fact that the relationship was homosexual in nature.\n\n\n       28\n            Nixon also testified that he had hair and wore make-up like a woman.\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 24\n\n       Subsequently, the State questioned Nixon about various text messages sent by appellant.\n\nMost of the questioning focused on the timing and sequence of the texts, without referring to their\n\ncontent. When the content of the message was referenced, it was nearly always paraphrased in\n\ngeneral terms, and any quotations of the messages were brief and referenced only the fact that\n\nappellant and Nixon had a relationship, without discussing Nixon’s gender or the homosexual nature\n\nof the relationship.29 The State also asked about some of the text messages sent by Nixon, which\n\nincluded a statement, “Baby, are you there?” The jury was not given a transcript of any of these text\n\nmessages.30\n\n       On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Nixon about the fact that he was a man\n\nwho dressed as a woman. Defense counsel also asked questions about the non-traditional (i.e.\n\nhomosexual) nature of Nixon and appellant’s relationship.\n\n       Upon review of the record, we conclude that it was the defense, not the State, that introduced\n\nevidence that the relationship between appellant and Nixon was homosexual in nature. If appellant\n\nhad not brought up the subject, then it would not have been presented to the jury, except if jurors had\n\n\n\n       29\n              The State and the witness once described a text message as referring to “how he\n[appellant] was feeling,” that appellant was “confused,” and that the text message had “something\nto do with your [the witness’s] relationship with the defendant.” In another text message, the\ndefendant replied, “yeah” to Nixon’s text saying, “I wish you were here.” Another group of text\nmessages between the two was referred to as discussing plans for Nixon’s upcoming birthday. In\na later text, Nixon offered to pick appellant up to go out, and appellant eventually responded, “Come\nand get me.” Subsequent texts were described as “mak[ing] plans at that point to go out.” These\nare all the references to the content of appellant’s text messages that the jury received during Nixon’s\ntestimony.\n       30\n           Later in the trial, the jury was given a transcript of selected text messages that, according\nto the State, indicated appellant’s guilt of the charged offense. Appellant does not claim that any of\nthese text messages relate to his current complaint. See the discussion of appellant’s fourth issue,\nbelow.\n\f                                                                                    NELSON — 25\n\nbeen able to tell the biological sex of the witness. Moreover, appellant never objected to the direct-\n\nexamination testimony by Nixon that he and appellant had a close dating relationship. Any juror\n\nwho could determine that Nixon was a man would have realized from the “dating” testimony alone\n\nthat Nixon and appellant had a homosexual relationship. A defendant who allows evidence to be\n\nintroduced from one source without objection forfeits any subsequent complaints about the\n\nintroduction of the same evidence from another source.31 Appellant’s third point of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                              B. Admission of Other Text Messages\n\n       Appellant argues in his fourth point of error that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nadmitting extraneous offense evidence in the guilt phase that was not relevant beyond character\n\nconformity, and he claims that the unfair prejudice stemming from it substantially outweighed any\n\nminimal probative value. During guilt, the State sought to introduce messages sent from appellant’s\n\ncell phone.32 Outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected that the messages were irrelevant,\n\n\n\n       31\n             Reyes v. State, 84 S.W.3d 633, 638 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002).\n       32\n            The text messages were published to the jury by reading them into the record as follows:\n\n       [PROSECUTOR]: State’s Exhibit 393, MetroPCS SMS text messages.\n\n       Message date, February 28th, 2011, from the Defendant 214-290-2632, “Need to buy\n       a gun, can you find me one?”\n\n       Message, March 4th, 2011, from the Defendant, 214-290-2632, “Say, I might need to\n       come up there to stay. I did some shit the other day, Cuz.”\n\n       Message, March 4th, 2011, to the Defendant, “Okay, bro.”\n\n       Message, March 4th, 2011, from the Defendant, 214-290-2632, “I fucked up bad,\n       Cuz, real bad.”\n\f                                                                                    NELSON — 26\n\ncontained extraneous matters, and were more prejudicial than probative. The State argued that a\n\n“potential firearm” was used and that the other messages were relevant to show appellant’s state of\n\nmind. The trial court overruled this objection and said that it would give a limiting instruction,\n\nwhich it did when the evidence was introduced and also in the jury charge.\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to admit evidence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.33\n\nThe trial court’s ruling will be upheld if it falls within the “zone of reasonable disagreement.”34\n\nRelevant evidence is anything that tends to make “the existence of any fact that is of consequence\n\nto the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the\n\nevidence.”35\n\n       Appellant argues that the text message in which he asked for assistance in buying a gun had\n\nminimal, if any, probative value because the victims in this case were not shot by a firearm and there\n\nwas no evidence of the discharge of a firearm at the scene. The State relies upon the testimony that\n\nshowed that Dobson was struck with a grip plate from a BB gun that was designed to look like a Colt\n\nfirearm. It claims that this text message was admissible to show appellant’s preparation, planning,\n\nand intent in the days leading up to the murder. The jury was instructed about the permissible\n\npurposes of the evidence at the admission of the evidence and in the jury charge. The trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n       Appellant also complains of the admission of text messages that referred to “needing a place\n\nto stay because he had done something bad.” These messages were highly probative of appellant’s\n\n\n       33\n            Moses v. State, 105 S.W.3d 622, 627 (Tex. Crim. App. 2003).\n       34\n            Id.\n       35\n            TEX . R.

The trial court did not err in admitting them into evidence. Appellant’s\n\nfourth point of error is overruled.\n\n                                C. Texas Youth Commission Records\n\n         In his seventh point of error, appellant alleges that the trial court violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confrontation by admitting, over objection, testimonial statements from Texas\n\nYouth Commission disciplinary records. During punishment, the State elicited testimony from\n\nManny Carrera of the Texas Juvenile Justice Department regarding the records of appellant’s time\n\nthere.\n\n         Carrera was asked how many separate disciplinary infractions appellant had during his time\n\nat TYC. Appellant objected to this as “confrontational, personal knowledge,” and the trial court\n\noverruled his objection. Appellant objected again, and his objection was again overruled.\n\nNevertheless, the State did not require Carrera to answer the question. Instead, the prosecutor went\n\non to ask him about levels of sanctions and housing. No violation of the Sixth Amendment occurred.\n\n         Appellant also refers to specific segments of exhibits and quotations from testimony that he\n\nclaims violated the Confrontation Clause. We do not find these statements and documents at the\n\nrecord citations appellant provides.36 We overrule appellant’s seventh point of error.\n\n                                V. PUNISHMENT CHALLENGES\n\n         In appellant’s tenth point of error, he claims that the trial court erred in overruling his motion\n\n\n\n         36\n          See TEX . R. APP . P. 38.1(i) (“The brief must contain a clear and concise argument for\nthe contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.”) (emphasis\nadded). Moreover, in Segundo v. State, 270 S.W.3d 79, 106-107 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008) (op. on\nrehearing), the defendant complained of the exact same statements of which appellant now\ncomplains. We held that the statements were not testimonial in nature and did not violate the\nConfrontation Clause. Id.\n\f                                                                                       NELSON — 28\n\nto declare the “10-12” rule unconstitutional for creating an arbitrary and impermissible risk of\n\nimposing the death penalty. This Court has repeatedly held that the 10-12 rule does not violate the\n\nconstitution.37 Appellant’s tenth point of error is overruled.\n\n       Appellant alleges in his eleventh point of error that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct\n\nthe jury that if a single juror “holds out” for life, appellant would receive a sentence of life\n\nimprisonment by operation of law. We have held that this provision does not violate the United\n\nStates Constitution.38 Appellant’s eleventh point of error is overruled.\n\n       In appellant’s twelfth point of error, he alleges that Article 37.071 is unconstitutional for not\n\nplacing a burden of proof regarding aggravating evidence. We have rejected this argument.39 The\n\nmitigation special issue is a defensive issue in which the State has no burden of proof.40 Point of\n\nerror twelve is overruled.\n\n       In appellant’s thirteenth point of error, he alleges that the trial court erred in overruling\n\nappellant’s motion to preclude the imposition of the death penalty on grounds that the indictment\n\nfailed to contain any allegations regarding the punishment special issues. Appellant claims that the\n\nRing line of cases requires that every fact relied upon to answer the special issues must have the\n\n\n\n\n       37\n         Luna v. State, 268 S.W.3d 594, 609 (Tex.

Appellant argues that the variety of\n\nsentencing schemes that have been designed and implemented by the State to respond to\n\nConstitutional requirements has created a variety of possible ways that one could be sentenced to\n\ndeath, and therefore the scheme is arbitrary. We have rejected similar arguments.43 Appellant’s\n\nfourteenth point of error is overruled.\n\n       In his fifteenth point of error, appellant claims that the Texas death-penalty statute violates\n\nthe jury-trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment and the due-process guarantee of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment by failing to place upon the State the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt a\n\nnegative answer to the mitigation special issue. Here, appellant argues that the Supreme Court\n\nrequires that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances outweigh\n\nmitigating factors before it can answer “no” to the third special issue.44 We have held that the\n\nApprendi-Ring-Blakely line of cases does not require a burden of proof on the mitigation special\n\n\n       41\n            See Ring v.

While there, appellant stole Dobson’s laptop, a\n\ncellphone, Elliot’s credit cards, and Elliot’s car.

Finding no error, we affirm.\n\n                                       I. BACKGROUND\n\n                                   A. Discovery of the Victims\n\n       Members of NorthPointe Baptist Church described the events surrounding the discovery of\n\nClint Dobson and Judy Elliot. Church member Dale Harwell had plans to meet Dobson for lunch.\n\nWhen Dobson did not arrive at the appointed time, Harwell tried unsuccessfully to contact him.\n\nDebra Jenkins went to NorthPointe at around 12:40, where she saw Dobson’s and Elliot’s cars in the\n\nparking lot. Jenkins rang the doorbell and called the church office but received no answer, so she\n\nleft after about five minutes. She returned fifteen minutes later, and Elliot’s car, a Galant, was no\n\nlonger in the parking lot. At 1:00 p.m., another church member, Suzanne Richards, arrived for a\n\nmeeting with Dobson. His car was in the parking lot, but Elliot’s was not. Richards waited for half\n\nof an hour, ringing the doorbell, calling, and texting Dobson.\n\n       Meanwhile, Clint Dobson’s wife, Laura, called Jake Turner, the part-time music minister,\n\nbecause she had been unable to reach her husband by phone. Turner agreed to go to the church, and\n\nhe called Judy Elliott’s husband John, who promptly drove to the church. John entered the church\n\nusing his passcode and called out Dobson’s name. John saw Dobson’s office in disarray and saw\n\na severely beaten woman, whom he did not immediately recognize as his wife, lying on the ground.\n\nHe did not notice Dobson lying on the other side of the desk. John called the police.\n\n       Arlington police officer Jesse Parrish responded to the call. He noticed signs of a struggle,\n\nincluding blood and what appeared to be a grip plate of a pistol. Elliot was lying on her back with\n\nher hands bound behind her. John recognized his wife by her clothing. Parrish found Dobson lying\n\nface-up with his hands bound behind his back. A bloody plastic bag was covering his head and\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 3\n\nsucked into his mouth. Upon lifting the plastic bag off of his head, Parrish knew that Dobson was\n\ndead.\n\n        Elliot was taken to the hospital in critical condition. She had a heart attack while there and\n\nneither the physicians nor John believed she would survive. She had traumatic injuries to her face,\n\nhead, arms, legs, and back and internal bleeding in her brain. She was in the hospital for two weeks\n\nand underwent five months of therapy and rehabilitation. A permanent fixture of mesh, screws, and\n\nother metal holds her face together. At the time of trial, Elliot still had physical and mental\n\nimpairments from the attack.\n\n        Doctor Nizam Peerwani, medical examiner for Tarrant County, testified that the manner of\n\nDobson’s death was homicide. Dobson’s injuries indicated a violent altercation during which he\n\nattempted to shield himself from blows from an object such as the butt of a firearm. Two wounds\n\nto his forehead appeared to be from the computer monitor stand in the office. According to Dr.\n\nPeerwani, the injuries indicated that Dobson was standing when he was first struck in the head and\n\nthat he was struck in the back of his head as he fell. After he had fallen to the ground and lost\n\nconsciousness, his hands were tied behind his back, and the bag was placed over his head. With the\n\nbag over his head, he suffocated and died.\n\n                            B. Appellant’s Actions after the Murder\n\n        Appellant texted Whitley Daniels at 1:24 p.m., and Daniels told him to bring her a cigar.\n\nAfter stopping at his apartment, appellant drove Elliot’s car to a Tire King store, where a customer\n\nbought Dobson’s laptop and case out of the trunk of the Galant. At around 2:00 p.m., appellant\n\ndrove to a Tetco convenience store, where he used Elliot’s credit card to buy gas, a drink, and a\n\ncigar. Anthony “AG” Springs’ girlfriend brought AG to the Tetco. When appellant tried to buy gas\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 4\n\nfor her car, the card was declined. Appellant and AG drove in Elliot’s car to the apartment of Claude\n\n“Twist” Jefferson and Jefferson’s aunt Brittany Bursey.\n\n       Daniels testified that appellant and AG arrived at her house with the cigar some time after\n\n3:00 p.m. Appellant and AG soon left, but appellant returned alone fifteen or twenty minutes later.\n\nAppellant asked Daniels to go to the mall and use her identification with the credit cards. She\n\ndeclined to do so, and appellant left.\n\n       Appellant went to The Parks at Arlington mall. Using Elliot’s credit cards at Sheikh Shoes,\n\nhe purchased a t-shirt featuring the Sesame Street character Oscar the Grouch, and Air Max shoes.\n\nHe also used the cards to buy costume jewelry at Jewelry Hut and Silver Gallery. Appellant later\n\nreturned to Sheikh Shoes with two companions, but a second attempt to use the credit card was not\n\napproved.\n\n       Appellant returned to Bursey’s apartment that evening with AG and Twist. Appellant was\n\nwearing the shirt, jewelry, and shoes that he had bought with Elliot’s cards. While taking pills and\n\nsmoking, he told Bursey that he had stolen the Galant from a pastor. Appellant left Bursey’s\n\napartment the next morning.\n\n       The next day, Appellant sent a series of text messages. One asked to see the recipient\n\nbecause “[i]t might be the last time.” Another said, “Say, I might need to come up there to stay. I\n\ndid some shit the other day, Cuz.” A third said, “I fucked up bad, Cuz, real bad.”\n\n       Tracey Nixon, who had dated appellant off and on, picked him up the day after the murder\n\nat a gas station on Brown Boulevard. Appellant wore the t-shirt and some of the jewelry that he had\n\nbought with Elliot’s cards. After going to a Dallas nightclub, appellant spent the night with Nixon,\n\nwho returned appellant to Brown Boulevard the next morning.\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 5\n\n                                    C. Investigation and Arrest\n\n        Officers obtained an arrest warrant and arrested appellant at Nixon’s apartment on March 5.\n\nAt the time of his arrest, appellant was wearing the tennis shoes and some of the jewelry he brought\n\nwith Elliot’s stolen credit cards. He was also wearing a black belt with metal studs. The shoes, belt,\n\nphone, and jewelry were seized during appellant’s jail book-in.\n\n        Officers seized other items from appellant’s apartment pursuant to a search warrant. They\n\nrecovered a pair of black and green Nike Air Jordan tennis shoes that appeared to match a bloody\n\nshoe print at NorthPointe, the New Orleans Saints jersey seen on the mall surveillance videos, a gold\n\nchain necklace, a pair of men’s silver earrings with diamond-like stones, a Nike Air Max shoe box,\n\na Sheikh Shoes shopping bag, a Sesame Street price tag, a Jimmy Jazz business card, and receipts\n\ndated March 3 from several of the stores. Officers found Dobson’s identification cards, insurance\n\ncards, and credit cards in Elliot’s car.\n\n        DNA from Dobson and from Elliot was discovered in a stain on appellant’s shoe.\n\nAppellant’s fingerprints were lifted from the wrist rest on Dobson’s desk, from receipts, and from\n\nsome of the items from the mall.\n\n        A trace-evidence analyst detected similarities between appellant’s shoe and a bloody shoe\n\nprint on an envelope in Dobson’s office. Appellant’s belt appeared to be missing studs, and similar\n\nstuds were recovered from the office. According to a firearms expert, the plastic grip panel found\n\nin Dobson’s office came from a 15XT Daisy air gun, which is a CO2-charged semiautomatic BB gun\n\nmodeled on a Colt firearm. The jury saw a BB gun manufactured from the same master mold and\n\nheard from a text message read into the record that appellant was seeking to buy a gun just days\n\nbefore the killing.\n\f                                                                                         NELSON — 6\n\n                                       D. Defense Testimony\n\n       Appellant testified on his own behalf. According to him, from about 11:30 p.m. on March\n\n2, until 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. on March 3, he and three companions were looking for people to rob. They\n\nhad firearms. Appellant went home for a while in the morning but later joined up with AG and\n\nTwist. Appellant claimed that he waited outside the church while AG and Twist went in. Twenty-\n\nfive minutes later, he went inside and saw the victims on the ground. They were bleeding from the\n\nbacks of their heads, but they were still alive. Appellant then took the laptop and case. According\n\nto appellant, AG gave him keys and credit cards. Appellant waited in Elliot’s car for a while and\n\nthen returned to Dobson’s office. By that time, the man was dead. Appellant could not stand the\n\nsmell, so he returned to Elliot’s car. He drove the group to his apartment, retrieved a CD and his\n\nNew Orleans Saints jersey, and continued to Bursey’s apartment, where they smoked marijuana.\n\nAppellant then left Bursey’s apartment in Elliot's car.\n\n       Appellant testified that he knew people were inside the church and that he agreed to rob\n\nthem. He claimed that he did not intend to hurt anyone and had no part in what happened inside of\n\nthe church. He also acknowledged making the purchases at Tetco and buying the items at the mall.\n\n       Appellant testified to having several prior convictions.\n\n                           II. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n                                               A. Guilt\n\n       In his sixth point of error, appellant alleges that the evidence is legally insufficient to support\n\na finding of guilty of capital murder. At the conclusion of the guilt phase, appellant moved for a\n\ndirected verdict of not guilty. The trial court denied the motion.\n\n       In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we view all of the evidence in the light most\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 7\n\nfavorable to the verdict to determine whether, based on that evidence and the reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom, a rational factfinder could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.2\n\n       Appellant calls our attention to four items—a tape, two tape swabs, and an electrical\n\ncord—that were tested for DNA. A State’s witness testified that she found on these items a mixture\n\nof DNA profiles. The major contributor on the tape and the tape swabs was Elliott. The major\n\ncontributor on the electrical cord was Dobson. Appellant was excluded as a contributor of the DNA\n\non all four items. He claims that the lack of his DNA on these items from the scene exculpated him\n\nand he argues that it renders the evidence legally insufficient to support the conviction.\n\n       Appellant fails to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. Given the\n\nevidence elsewhere detailed in this opinion, the evidence of appellant’s guilt is not rendered\n\ninsufficient by the fact that DNA testing fails to connect him to four items of evidence. A rational\n\njury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant intentionally and knowingly caused\n\nDobson’s death while in the course of committing or attempting to commit robbery. Appellant’s\n\nsixth point of error is overruled.\n\n                                     B. Future Dangerousness\n\n       In appellant’s second issue, he claims that the evidence was legally insufficient to support\n\nthe jury’s verdict with respect to the future-dangerousness special issue and that the imposition of\n\na death sentence in this case was arbitrary and capricious.\n\n                                       1.

The State’s Punishment Evidence\n\n       Evidence was introduced during the punishment phase regarding appellant’s youth history\n\nin and out of institutions in Oklahoma and Texas, his adult criminal history, and his infractions while\n\nincarcerated.\n\n                                   a. Youth History in Oklahoma\n\n       Appellant began getting into trouble with Oklahoma juvenile authorities when he was six\n\nyears old. His juvenile career included property crimes, burglaries, and thefts. Despite efforts by\n\nOklahoma authorities to place him in counseling and on probation, appellant was incarcerated in that\n\nstate at a young age because he continued to commit felonies. According to Ronnie Meeks, an\n\nOklahoma Juvenile Affairs employee who worked with appellant, this was “quite alarming.”\n\n       Appellant was sent to a detention center in Oklahoma for high-risk juveniles. On one\n\noccasion, while Meeks was driving appellant to the facility for diagnostic services, appellant fled\n\nfrom Meeks’ pickup truck. He was apprehended a few minutes later. At the facility, appellant was\n\ndisruptive and tried to escape. After a few weeks, appellant was sent to a group home in Norman,\n\nOklahoma, for counseling. There, appellant did not fare well. He was disruptive and did not try to\n\nmake any improvements.\n\n       When Meeks needed cooperation from appellant’s mother, she was available. Appellant\n\nnever appeared to Meeks to be in need of anything; his mother appeared to be providing enough.\n\n       Meeks testified that, in addition to being uncooperative with the efforts in Oklahoma to\n\n\n       8\n           Dinkins v.

Youth Offenses in Texas\n\n        Appellant was also involved in the Texas juvenile justice system through the Tarrant County\n\nprobation office. Mary Kelleher, of that office, first had contact with appellant in April 2000, when\n\nhe was thirteen years old. The police referred appellant to her for having committed aggravated\n\nassault with a deadly weapon. Kelleher worked with appellant during a time when he was pulling\n\nfire alarms, was truant, and was declining in school performance. In December 2001, the police\n\ndepartment again referred appellant to Kelleher for multiple charges, including burglaries of a\n\nhabitation, criminal trespass of a habitation, and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. After the\n\ndepartment was notified that appellant was a runaway, the juvenile court detained him until all of\n\nthe charges were disposed.\n\n        The Tarrant County juvenile court adjudicated appellant, then fourteen years old, for burglary\n\nof a habitation and unauthorized use of a motor vehicle. He was committed to the Texas Youth\n\nCommission (“TYC”) for an indeterminate period. According to Kelleher, it is unusual for a\n\njuvenile to be committed to TYC for property crimes at that age, but appellent's history made him\n\na rare case.\n\n        Kelleher testified that appellant had family support from his mother but none from his father.\n\nAppellant’s mother was neither abusive nor neglectful. According to appellant’s mother, his two\n\nsiblings went to college and did not get into trouble. Appellant indicated to Kelleher that he knew\n\nhis actions were wrong, but he acted out of impulse and boredom, without an exact reason.\n\n        Appellant was a “chronic serious offender.” While in TYC, appellant had four of the\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 11\n\nhighest-level disciplinary hearings and was repeatedly placed in the behavior-management plan.\n\nAppellant was originally sent to TYC for nine months, but he spent over three and a half years\n\nconfined because of his infractions. This sentence for a burglary adjudication was an extraordinarily\n\nlengthy time to spend in TYC. He eventually made parole, had his parole revoked, and returned to\n\nTYC.\n\n       Appellant was paroled from TYC a second time. On his second parole, when appellant was\n\ntwenty years old, he again did not comply with the terms, even after counseling. His parole officer\n\nissued a directive to apprehend appellant for these violations, but he “aged out” of the juvenile\n\nsystem before he could be picked up, allowing him to remain unapprehended.\n\n                                 c. Adult Arrests and Convictions\n\n       In 2005, appellant, then eighteen years old, was stopped while driving a stolen car. The\n\nofficer who arrested him concluded that appellant was “a compulsive liar.”\n\n       Video evidence and testimony from November 30, 2007, showed Appellant in a Wal-Mart\n\nstock room posing as an associate from a different store. Appellant put a laptop computer down his\n\npants and then walked to the exit. The following week, appellant was apprehended at a separate\n\nArlington Wal-Mart for putting on new boots off the shelf and leaving the store without paying.\n\n       After being released from state jail in 2010, appellant assaulted his live-in girlfriend, Sarina\n\nDaniels. When Sarina ran outside after an argument, appellant caught her and dragged her inside.\n\nWhen she tried to call 9-1-1, he broke her telephone. Appellant bound Sarina with duct tape and\n\ntried to have her stand on a trash bag so her blood would not get on the carpet. He held a knife to\n\nher throat while holding her by the hair and made her apologize for talking to another man while\n\nappellant was incarcerated. Appellant pulled the knife away and told Sarina that he was not going\n\f                                                                                    NELSON — 12\n\nto kill her. He then grabbed her by the throat, pushed her onto a dresser, and said, “But if you do it\n\nagain, then I will.” Appellant then choked Sarina. Sarina filed charges, and appellant was arrested.\n\n       For this aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, appellant was placed on probation and sent\n\nto a ninety-day program at the Intermediate Sanctions Facility (“ISF”) in Burnet. Sherry Price, a\n\nDallas County probation officer, told appellant to report as soon as he was released from the\n\nprogram, which appellant failed to do. After appellant failed to report as directed, Price told him to\n\nreport to her on March 3. He did not report, and hours later, he killed Clint Dobson.\n\n                                      d. Early Jail Infractions\n\n       Appellant was classified as an assaultive inmate in the Tarrant County Jail while awaiting\n\ntrial. For a time, he was in restrictive housing, but he nevertheless committed numerous serious\n\ndisciplinary infractions. Among other things, appellant broke a telephone in the visitation booth and\n\nthen threatened the responding officer. After one altercation with a guard, it took three officers to\n\nsubdue appellant. One officer’s foot was fractured. In another incident, appellant refused to return\n\nto his cell. Three officers tried to escort him to his cell, but appellant stood in his cell door to\n\nprevent it shutting. When officer Kent Williams reached in to slide the door shut, appellant grabbed\n\nhim, struck him in the face, pulled him into his cell, and threw him on the desk and into a wall.\n\n       Appellant was also combative with other inmates and, on at least one occasion, was complicit\n\nin arranging for a bag filled with feces and urine to be placed in another inmate’s cell. After\n\nappellant was assigned to a tank for problematic inmates, he broke the lights in his cell.\n\n       On February 22, 2012, appellant broke multiple fire-sprinkler heads and flooded the day\n\nroom. The jury saw photographs and video of this, including appellant dancing in the water. Six\n\nofficers restrained him. Breaking the sprinkler heads triggered the fire alarm in the whole jail.\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 13\n\n                                   e. Killing of Jonathon Holden\n\n       On March 19, 2012, while appellant was in the Tarrant County jail awaiting trial in this case,\n\nhe killed Jonathon Holden, a mentally challenged inmate. According to a fellow inmate who\n\nwitnessed the incident, Holden had angered inmates when he mentioned “the N word under his\n\nvoice.” Appellant was in the day room of the holding area, and he talked Holden into faking a\n\nsuicide attempt to cause Holden to be moved to a different part of the jail. Holden came to the cell\n\nbars, and appellant looped a blanket around Holden’s neck. Appellant tightened the blanket by\n\nbracing his feet on the bars and pulling with both hands on the blanket. Holden’s back was against\n\nthe bars and he was being pulled up almost off his feet. It took four minutes for Holden to die.\n\nAfterwards, appellant did a “celebration dance” in the style of Chuck Berry, “where he hops on one\n\nfoot and plays the guitar.” Appellant used a broom stick, which he had previously used to poke\n\nanother mentally challenged inmate in the eye, as a guitar.\n\n                                f. Jail Infractions while Segregated.\n\n       Following Holden’s death, Appellant was assigned to a single-man, self-contained cell for\n\ndangerous and violent inmates. On April 22, 2012, officers found contraband, such as a broom\n\nhandle and extra rolls of toilet tissue, in appellant’s cell. In May 2012, a search of appellant’s cell\n\nyielded a bag of prescription drugs.\n\n       On July 20, 2012, a few weeks before trial, appellant damaged jail property in a two-hour-\n\nlong incident, of which the jury saw security footage and heard testimony. While in a segregation\n\ncell, appellant blocked the window with wet toilet paper. He then flooded his cell. Ultimately, the\n\nofficers had to use pepper spray to subdue appellant. Officers in protective gear restrained appellant\n\nand took him to the decontamination shower. During this time, appellant rapped and sang. While\n\f                                                                                    NELSON — 14\n\nhis own cell was decontaminated, appellant flooded the toilet in the holdover cell. He brandished\n\na shank made from a plastic spoon. When he was being returned to his cell, appellant fought and\n\nthreatened the officers. They ultimately placed him in a restraint chair, a process that took eight\n\nofficers. This disturbance took about seventy percent of the jail’s manpower. Sergeant Kevin\n\nChambliss, who testified about the incident, had to request back-up personnel from another facility.\n\n       On August 23, 2012, on a day of voir dire proceedings, appellant cracked one of the jail’s\n\nwindows and chipped off paint with his belly chain while in the jail gym. He showed no remorse.\n\nAppellant’s dangerous activity continued after the guilt phase of trial. After the jury’s verdict was\n\nread, while appellant was in a holdover cell, he ripped the stun cuff off of his leg. Again, he showed\n\nno remorse. During trial, while appellant was being escorted from the jail to the courtroom, he tried\n\nto move his cuffs from behind his back multiple times. During the punishment phase, officers found\n\nthree razor blades inside letters addressed to appellant, along with other contraband items.\n\n                                        g. Prior Convictions\n\n       Appellant’s prior convictions comprised failure to identify, unauthorized use of a motor\n\nvehicle, burglary of a building, and numerous thefts.\n\n                                        3. Defense Evidence\n\n       The defense put on a forensic psychologist, Doctor Antoinette McGarrahan. She testified\n\nthat, although appellant had no current learning disability or cognitive impairment, he had a past\n\nhistory of learning disabilities. Dr. McGarrahan explained that, when, as a three-year-old, appellant\n\nset fire to his mother’s bed with intent to cause harm, it was essentially a cry for attention and\n\nsecurity. She believed that there was “something significantly wrong with [appellant’s] brain being\n\nwired in a different way, being predisposed to this severe aggressive and violence from a very early\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 15\n\nage.” She testified that, by the time appellant was six years old, he had had at least three EEGs,\n\nmeaning that people were already “looking to the brain for an explanation” of his behavior. The test\n\nresults did not indicate a seizure disorder, but Dr. McGarrahan said that they did not rule out\n\nappellant having one. Risk factors present in appellant’s life included having ADHD, a mother who\n\nworked two jobs, an absent father, verbal abuse, and witnessing domestic violence.\n\n        Appellant spoke about two alter egos, “Tank” and ‘Rico.” Dr. McGarrahan did not believe\n\nthat appellant had dissociative-identity disorder; rather, these alter egos were a way to avoid taking\n\nresponsibility for his actions.\n\n        Dr. McGarrahan acknowledged on cross-examination that appellant likes violence and has\n\na thrill for violence and that it is emotionally pleasing to him. She said he is “criminally versatile,”\n\nand she agreed that characteristics of antisocial personality disorder describe him. According to her,\n\npeople with antisocial personality disorder have trouble following the rules of society and repeatedly\n\nengage in behavior that is grounds for arrest. They are consistently and persistently irresponsible and\n\nimpulsive; they tend to lie, steal, and cheat. Appellant has many characteristics of a psychopath—\n\nincluding a grandiose sense of self, a lack of empathy, and a failure to take responsibility.

Conclusion\n\n        The evidence in the present case amply supports a finding of future dangerousness.\n\nAppellant has a long history of bad behavior, both inside and outside a confinement setting. The\n\nworst of this behavior includes not only the capital murder charged in the present case but also the\n\nkilling of a mentally challenged inmate while appellant’s capital murder charges were pending.\n\nAppellant’s second point of error is overruled.\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 16\n\n                                          III. VOIR DIRE\n\n                               A. Exemptions and Disqualifications\n\n        In appellant’s eighth point of error, he claims that the trial court erred by denying his motion\n\nthat the trial judge preside over potential juror claims of exemptions or disqualifications.\n\n        Appellant filed motions requesting that the trial court summon a special venire and arguing\n\nthat a court administrator or designee could not hear excuses and disqualifications of potential\n\njurors.9 The trial court denied these motions but later agreed to reconsider the motions and held a\n\npretrial hearing. At the hearing, the jury bailiff for Tarrant County, Paula Morales, testified that she\n\nis in charge of sending out the jury summonses to prospective jurors. August 2, 2012—the day that\n\nthe venire panel for appellant’s case met—would have been a normal day. The trial judge informed\n\nMorales that he needed a large panel. Morales summoned around 1,300 people to appear on August\n\n2. Normally, she would summon at least 400, and the most she would ever summon would be about\n\n1500. Only some of the jurors called for August 2 would be assigned to appellant’s trial. The others\n\nwould be assigned to other courts. Appellant argued that, because the normal procedure was altered\n\nto call in more jurors, it amounted to a special venire. The trial court again denied the motions.\n\n        The Government Code allows a court’s designee to hear excuses and exemptions under\n\ncertain circumstances.10 In large counties, it is common for courts to gather a general assembly, have\n\nthe court’s designee review the exemptions and disqualifications of members of the assembly, and\n\n\n\n\n       9\n            See TEX .

The\n\nmere fact that a large number of jurors is summoned to jury service does not mean that the venire\n\nis a special venire. The general assembly portion of jury selection was not part of appellant’s trial,\n\nand appellant was not entitled to be present.15 This specific type of panel selection has been\n\napproved by this court.16 The trial judge was not required to preside over exemptions and\n\nqualifications. Appellant’s eighth point of error is overruled.\n\n             B.

Judicial Districts\n\n       The courts of the state lie within administrative judicial regions.17 The presiding judge of an\n\nadministrative judicial region assigns “the judges of the administrative region to hold special or\n\nregular terms of court in any county of the administrative region to try cases and dispose of\n\naccumulated business.”18\n\n                                             2. Procedure\n\n       The Honorable Jeff Walker, Presiding Judge of the 8th Administrative Region, signed an\n\norder on August 1, 2012, assigning Elizabeth Berry, former judge, to the Criminal District Number\n\nFour beginning on August 2.19 Among other things, the order stated:\n\n\n       17\n            TEX . GOV ’T CODE § 74.042.\n       18\n            Id. § 74.056(a).\n       19\n            The August 1 order reads, in its entirety:\n\n               Pursuant to Section 74.056, Texas Government Code, I assign the Honorable\n       Elizabeth Berry, Former Judge of the Criminal District No. 3 to the Criminal District\n       Court No. 4 of Tarrant County, Texas.\n               The judge is assigned for a period of 1 days, beginning August 2nd, 2012. If\n       the judge begins a trial on the merits during the period of this assignment, the\n       assignment continues in such case until plenary jurisdiction has expired or the\n       undersigned Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in writing, whichever\n       occurs first.\n               It is ordered that the Clerk of the Court to which this assignment made, if it\n       is reasonable and practicable, and if time permits, give notice of this assignment to\n       each attorney representing a party to a case that is to be heard in whole or in part by\n       the assigned judge.\n               It is further ordered that the Clerk, upon receipt hereof, shall post a copy of\n       this order in a public area of the Clerk’s office or courthouse so that attorneys and\n       parties may be advised of this assignment.\n\f                                                                                     NELSON — 19\n\n       The judge is assigned for a period of 1 days, beginning August 2nd, 2012. If the\n       judge begins a trial on the merits during the period of this assignment, the assignment\n       continues in such case until plenary jurisdiction has expired or the undersigned\n       Presiding Judge has terminated this assignment in writing, whichever occurs first.\n\nOn August 2, appellant was arraigned, and Judge Berry heard the qualifications and exemptions for\n\nthe prospective jurors. Individual voir dire began on August 13, 2012, and continued for the next\n\nfour days. Appellant moved for mistrial on August 20, 2012.\n\n       Appellant called Presiding Judge Walker as a witness and introduced four orders by which\n\nJudge Walker assigned Judge Berry, including the August 2nd order. Judge Walker testified that,\n\nwhen he appoints a judge to a court, it is for “[w]hatever is on the docket for the day” and that Judge\n\nBerry “can do any case that comes before her on that date.” Judge Walker testified that the other\n\nthree orders were for payment purposes, and they did not re-appoint Judge Berry to the case because\n\nshe was already assigned to the case. Notably, he said that trial on the merits does not mean when\n\nthe jury is seated and when jeopardy attaches, but “it means everything. . . . [t]he whole shootin’\n\nmatch.”\n\n       Appellant argues that Judge Walker was wrong about the meaning of “trial on the merits”\n\nin the context of the order. Appellant points out that jeopardy attaches in a jury trial when the jury\n\nis empaneled and sworn. His position is that the trial on the merits, therefore, did not begin in this\n\ncase until the jury was empaneled and sworn. Because trial on the merits had not begun during the\n\ntime that Judge Berry presided over voir dire, he claims that the “trial on the merits” language in the\n\norder was inadequate to continue Judge Berry’s appointment past August 2.\n\n       We disagree. Appellant does not explain why double-jeopardy concepts have any bearing\n\n\n                Signed, Jeff Walker, Presiding Judge, 8th Administrative Judicial Region of\n       Texas.\n\f                                                                                        NELSON — 20\n\non what “trial on the merits” meant in the context of the order, and we see no reason that they would.\n\nJudge Walker intended to assign Judge Berry for “the whole shootin’ match” and the order\n\naccomplished that design.20 Appellant’s first point of error is overruled.\n\n                                          C. Batson challenge\n\n        In appellant’s fifth point of error, he claims that the trial court violated the Equal Protection\n\nClause by overruling his Batson21 objections to the State’s peremptory strikes of two minority venire\n\nmembers.\n\n        A Batson challenge involves three steps: (1) there must be a prima facie showing that a venire\n\nmember was peremptorily excluded on the basis of race; (2) the striking party must then tender a\n\nrace-neutral reason for the strike; and (3) if a race-neutral reason is tendered, the trial court must then\n\ndetermine whether the objecting party has proved purposeful discrimination.22 The trial court’s\n\nruling on a Batson challenge is sustained on appeal unless it is clearly erroneous.23 This highly\n\ndeferential standard is employed because the trial court is in the best position to determine whether\n\nthe State’s justification is actually race-neutral.24 A defendant’s failure to offer rebuttal to a\n\nprosecutor’s race-neutral explanation can be fatal to defendant’s claim.25\n\n        Appellant raised a Batson challenge regarding five venire members. The trial court found\n\n\n        20\n          The State also argues that appellant failed to preserve this claim for review.

The State noted which black and Hispanic minority members were struck by the\n\ndefense, then proffered explanations for the five challenged venire members: Venire member Spivey\n\nslept during instructions from the bench and denied arrests that the State was aware of, claimed that\n\nhe did not want to serve on the trial because he did not believe appellant could get a fair trial,\n\nexplained that he did not want to sit around on jury service without being paid overtime, and\n\nindicated that he had trouble sitting in judgment of other people. Venire member Lee-Moses\n\nindicated that she was not in favor of the death penalty and could not assess the death penalty\n\nregardless of the facts or circumstances of the case. She also would have problems with a\n\n“circumstantial case,” and she believed the death penalty had been used unfairly in the past. Venire\n\nmember Southichack indicated that she has a problem judging. She was not in favor of the death\n\npenalty, and she did not believe it should ever be invoked. She seemed to the prosecutors to have\n\ndifficulty with the legal issues related to the special issues. She also said she would have trouble\n\nanswering question number two “yes” if she believed appellant was not the trigger person. Venire\n\nmember Hooper Golightly belonged to a church that was opposed to the death penalty, and she did\n\nnot disagree with that position. She was not in favor of the death penalty, and she thought it should\n\nnever be invoked. Venire member Mays served on a trial that resulted in a mistrial. She thought the\n\ndeath penalty should never be invoked, and it was not on the top of her list for a possible\n\npunishment.\n\n       The trial court found that the State “offered reasonable, race-neutral reasons” for its\n\nperemptory strikes against the challenged members. Appellant then pointed out that three of the\n\nmembers that the State exercised peremptory strikes on were not challenged for cause, and said “the\n\f                                                                                       NELSON — 22\n\nrecord speaks for itself.”\n\n        Appellant failed to rebut the State’s race-neutral reasons for its strikes, and the record\n\nsupports the trial court’s determination that the State did not engage in purposeful discrimination.\n\nHis fifth point of error is overruled.\n\n                 D. Possible Prospective Jurors Seeing Appellant Wearing Chains.\n\n        In his ninth point of error, appellant claims that the trial court erred by overruling his\n\nobjection that he was escorted to the courtroom wearing chains in view of prospective jurors. On\n\nAugust 2, 2012, the venire assembled in the central jury room. Appellant’s counsel told the trial\n\ncourt that, while appellant was being escorted from the holdover cell, appellant was dressed in\n\ncivilian clothes and “wearing chains around his legs and wearing chains which [were] visible around\n\nhis arms.” According to defense counsel, four or five prospective jurors were in the lobby, and at\n\nleast one looked at the group accompanying appellant. Counsel could not tell if the prospective\n\njurors were for appellant’s trial.\n\n        We have held that requiring an accused person to wear handcuffs before the jury infringes\n\nhis constitutional presumption of innocence.26 However, “a momentary, inadvertent, and fortuitous\n\nencounter away from the courtroom between a handcuffed accused and one or more of the jurors\n\ndoes not necessarily call for a mistrial or reversal.”27 Here, appellant could not even say whether the\n\nvenire members who were encountered outside the courtroom were for appellant’s case, nor did he\n\nrequest an opportunity to determine that. Moreover, it appears that the encounter between appellant\n\nand the individuals outside the central jury room was a momentary, inadvertent, and fortuitous\n\n\n        26\n             Clark v.

Relationship with Tracey Nixon\n\n       In appellant’s third issue, he complains about the admission at the guilt phase of trial, during\n\nthe testimony of Tracey Nixon, of text messages from his cell phone. He contends that the text\n\nmessages were inadmissible because they showed that he had a sexual relationship with another man,\n\nwhich would constitute an extraneous bad act. He further contends that the State had no need for\n\nthe evidence and that the unfair prejudice substantially outweighed any minimal probative value.\n\n       Tracey Nixon is a man who dresses and presents as a woman.28 Nixon testified in a hearing\n\noutside the presence of the jury that he had dated appellant periodically for about two years and had\n\ngiven appellant the phone that was seized during appellant’s arrest, as well as setting up the account\n\nfor that phone. The State sought to introduce text messages to and from the phone and argued that\n\nthe text messages were relevant to establish time line and identity.\n\n       Appellant objected to some of the contents of the text messages on the basis that they\n\nincluded extraneous matters—“drugs, as well as homosexuality.” The State agreed to excise the\n\nreferences to drugs but contended that the relationship between appellant and the witness was a\n\nlegitimate matter of inquiry.\n\n       In front of the jury, the State questioned Nixon briefly about his relationship with appellant.\n\nThis questioning established that Nixon and appellant “were on and off dating” for two years. Nixon\n\nacknowledged that he and appellant were “very close.” This questioning did not bring up Nixon’s\n\ngender or the fact that the relationship was homosexual in nature.\n\n\n       28\n            Nixon also testified that he had hair and wore make-up like a woman.\n\f                                                                                      NELSON — 24\n\n       Subsequently, the State questioned Nixon about various text messages sent by appellant.\n\nMost of the questioning focused on the timing and sequence of the texts, without referring to their\n\ncontent. When the content of the message was referenced, it was nearly always paraphrased in\n\ngeneral terms, and any quotations of the messages were brief and referenced only the fact that\n\nappellant and Nixon had a relationship, without discussing Nixon’s gender or the homosexual nature\n\nof the relationship.29 The State also asked about some of the text messages sent by Nixon, which\n\nincluded a statement, “Baby, are you there?” The jury was not given a transcript of any of these text\n\nmessages.30\n\n       On cross-examination, defense counsel questioned Nixon about the fact that he was a man\n\nwho dressed as a woman. Defense counsel also asked questions about the non-traditional (i.e.\n\nhomosexual) nature of Nixon and appellant’s relationship.\n\n       Upon review of the record, we conclude that it was the defense, not the State, that introduced\n\nevidence that the relationship between appellant and Nixon was homosexual in nature. If appellant\n\nhad not brought up the subject, then it would not have been presented to the jury, except if jurors had\n\n\n\n       29\n              The State and the witness once described a text message as referring to “how he\n[appellant] was feeling,” that appellant was “confused,” and that the text message had “something\nto do with your [the witness’s] relationship with the defendant.” In another text message, the\ndefendant replied, “yeah” to Nixon’s text saying, “I wish you were here.” Another group of text\nmessages between the two was referred to as discussing plans for Nixon’s upcoming birthday. In\na later text, Nixon offered to pick appellant up to go out, and appellant eventually responded, “Come\nand get me.” Subsequent texts were described as “mak[ing] plans at that point to go out.” These\nare all the references to the content of appellant’s text messages that the jury received during Nixon’s\ntestimony.\n       30\n           Later in the trial, the jury was given a transcript of selected text messages that, according\nto the State, indicated appellant’s guilt of the charged offense. Appellant does not claim that any of\nthese text messages relate to his current complaint. See the discussion of appellant’s fourth issue,\nbelow.\n\f                                                                                    NELSON — 25\n\nbeen able to tell the biological sex of the witness. Moreover, appellant never objected to the direct-\n\nexamination testimony by Nixon that he and appellant had a close dating relationship. Any juror\n\nwho could determine that Nixon was a man would have realized from the “dating” testimony alone\n\nthat Nixon and appellant had a homosexual relationship. A defendant who allows evidence to be\n\nintroduced from one source without objection forfeits any subsequent complaints about the\n\nintroduction of the same evidence from another source.31 Appellant’s third point of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n                              B. Admission of Other Text Messages\n\n       Appellant argues in his fourth point of error that the trial court abused its discretion by\n\nadmitting extraneous offense evidence in the guilt phase that was not relevant beyond character\n\nconformity, and he claims that the unfair prejudice stemming from it substantially outweighed any\n\nminimal probative value. During guilt, the State sought to introduce messages sent from appellant’s\n\ncell phone.32 Outside the presence of the jury, Appellant objected that the messages were irrelevant,\n\n\n\n       31\n             Reyes v.

I did some shit the other day, Cuz.”\n\n       Message, March 4th, 2011, to the Defendant, “Okay, bro.”\n\n       Message, March 4th, 2011, from the Defendant, 214-290-2632, “I fucked up bad,\n       Cuz, real bad.”\n\f                                                                                    NELSON — 26\n\ncontained extraneous matters, and were more prejudicial than probative. The State argued that a\n\n“potential firearm” was used and that the other messages were relevant to show appellant’s state of\n\nmind. The trial court overruled this objection and said that it would give a limiting instruction,\n\nwhich it did when the evidence was introduced and also in the jury charge.\n\n       We review a trial court’s decision to admit evidence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.33\n\nThe trial court’s ruling will be upheld if it falls within the “zone of reasonable disagreement.”34\n\nRelevant evidence is anything that tends to make “the existence of any fact that is of consequence\n\nto the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the\n\nevidence.”35\n\n       Appellant argues that the text message in which he asked for assistance in buying a gun had\n\nminimal, if any, probative value because the victims in this case were not shot by a firearm and there\n\nwas no evidence of the discharge of a firearm at the scene. The State relies upon the testimony that\n\nshowed that Dobson was struck with a grip plate from a BB gun that was designed to look like a Colt\n\nfirearm. It claims that this text message was admissible to show appellant’s preparation, planning,\n\nand intent in the days leading up to the murder. The jury was instructed about the permissible\n\npurposes of the evidence at the admission of the evidence and in the jury charge. The trial court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n       Appellant also complains of the admission of text messages that referred to “needing a place\n\nto stay because he had done something bad.” These messages were highly probative of appellant’s\n\n\n       33\n            Moses v.

Texas Youth Commission Records\n\n         In his seventh point of error, appellant alleges that the trial court violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to confrontation by admitting, over objection, testimonial statements from Texas\n\nYouth Commission disciplinary records. During punishment, the State elicited testimony from\n\nManny Carrera of the Texas Juvenile Justice Department regarding the records of appellant’s time\n\nthere.\n\n         Carrera was asked how many separate disciplinary infractions appellant had during his time\n\nat TYC. Appellant objected to this as “confrontational, personal knowledge,” and the trial court\n\noverruled his objection. Appellant objected again, and his objection was again overruled.\n\nNevertheless, the State did not require Carrera to answer the question. Instead, the prosecutor went\n\non to ask him about levels of sanctions and housing. No violation of the Sixth Amendment occurred.\n\n         Appellant also refers to specific segments of exhibits and quotations from testimony that he\n\nclaims violated the Confrontation Clause. We do not find these statements and documents at the\n\nrecord citations appellant provides.36 We overrule appellant’s seventh point of error.\n\n                                V.

Appellant argues that the variety of\n\nsentencing schemes that have been designed and implemented by the State to respond to\n\nConstitutional requirements has created a variety of possible ways that one could be sentenced to\n\ndeath, and therefore the scheme is arbitrary. We have rejected similar arguments.43 Appellant’s\n\nfourteenth point of error is overruled.\n\n       In his fifteenth point of error, appellant claims that the Texas death-penalty statute violates\n\nthe jury-trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment and the due-process guarantee of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment by failing to place upon the State the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt a\n\nnegative answer to the mitigation special issue. Here, appellant argues that the Supreme Court\n\nrequires that a jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that aggravating circumstances outweigh\n\nmitigating factors before it can answer “no” to the third special issue.44 We have held that the\n\nApprendi-Ring-Blakely line of cases does not require a burden of proof on the mitigation special\n\n\n       41\n            See Ring v.
