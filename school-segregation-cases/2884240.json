The cases were brought\nby two professors and several administrative staff against the University of Arkansas,\nthrough its board of trustees and individual state officials, for sex and race\ndiscrimination and harassment under Title VII and state law. In each case the district\ncourt1 ruled that the Title VII claims were not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The\nstate of Arkansas appealed, and the United States intervened in two of the cases. We\naffirm.\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Jimm L. Hendren, Chief Judge, United States District Court for\nthe Western District of Arkansas, presided in the cases filed by the professors.\n\n       The Honorable George Howard, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern\nDistrict of Arkansas, presided in the staff case.\n                                         -4-\n\f                                            I.\n\n       Gwenn Okruhlik, a tenure track professor of political science and member of the\nMiddle East Studies Program (MES), sued the University trustees and various state\nofficials in their individual and official capacities for disparate treatment and impact\ndiscrimination on the basis of her gender. She also claimed that she was subjected to\nhostile workplace harassment and retaliation and that Arkansas had violated the\nConstitution and state law. In support of her claims, Okruhlik set out detailed factual\nallegations claiming that male colleagues, including Bernard L. Madison, Dean of the\nCollege of Arts and Sciences, had made discriminatory and sexually derogatory\nstatements and conspired to discredit her work. Okruhlik also alleged that she was\nsubjected to more stringent tenure review than her male colleagues.\n\n       Linda Schilcher, a professor of history and member of MES, sued the University\ntrustees and state officials in their individual and official capacities for disparate\ntreatment on the basis of race and gender and hostile environment sexual harassment,\nin violation of Title VII and the Arkansas Civil Rights Act. She also alleged violations\nof the Constitution and other state law. Schilcher alleged that she was discriminated\nagainst in terms of her employment, especially in allocation of professional funding, and\nthat she repeatedly received disparaging comments because of her race and gender.\nSchilcher claims that Dean Madison demanded that her tenure review be negative and\nthat the director of MES placed a false letter in her file.\n\n       Administrative staff members Ester Lunnie, Dorothy Robinson, Jean Crockett,\nand Gayle Portis sued the board of trustees and school officials in their official and\nindividual capacities, alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.\nยง 1981, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and the Fourteenth Amendment. They alleged that Arkansas\ndenied them promotions and terminated them due to their race and provided them less\nfavorable working conditions than white employees. Lunnie and Robinson also alleged\nthat they were retaliated against for filing an EEOC complaint.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f        In each case Arkansas filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Eleventh\nAmendment barred all Title VII claims. Arkansas asserted in addition that the state\nclaims of Okruhlik and Schilcher were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and state\nimmunity and that Schilcher had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted. The district court held that the Title VII claims were not barred because\nCongress had validly abrogated the statesโs Eleventh Amendment immunity. The state\nclaims against the officials in their individual capacity were not dismissed because they\nsatisfied the malice exception to Arkansas immunity law. The court also found that\nSchilcher had stated a claim.\n\n       The Arkansas defendants filed three interlocutory appeals, arguing that the\nEleventh Amendment bars Title VII claims against the state, that Arkansas law bars the\npendent state claims, and that Schilcher did not state a claim. The plaintiffs and the\nUnited States respond that Congress abrogated the Eleventh Amendment in enacting\nTitle VII, and the professors further argue that their state law claims satisfy the malice\nexception to immunity and that we lack jurisdiction at this point on whether Schilcher\nhas stated a claim.\n\n                                           II.\n\n       Appellate review is generally not available until after final judgment except for\nimmunity issues and issues โinextricably intertwinedโ with those properly before the\ncourt at the interlocutory stage. Entergy, Arkansas, Inc. v. Nebraska, 241 F.3d 979,\n987 (8th Cir. 2001) (citation omitted). An issue is โinextricably intertwinedโ with\nimmunity issues โโonly if [it] is coterminous with, or subsumed in, the claim before the\ncourt on interlocutory appeal--that is, when the appellate resolution of the collateral\nappeal necessarily resolves the pendent claims as well.โโ Kincade v. City of Blue\nSprings, Mo., 64 F.3d 389, 394 (8th Cir. 1995) (citation omitted). The parties agree\nthat rulings on immunity are reviewable by this court de novo. See Puerto Rico\nAqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 144-45 (1993); Salve\n\n                                           -6-\n\fRegina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. 225, 231 (1991). All parties also agree that the\nissues of Eleventh Amendment immunity are properly before the court on these\nappeals.\n\n\n       Arkansas argues that claims of disparate treatment and disparate impact\ndiscrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972 (1972 Act) and the Civil Rights Act of\n1991(1991 Act), are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.2 Arkansas contends that\nCongress did not abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in these statutes because it did not\nmake an unmistakably clear expression of its intent to do so in the 1972 Act or in the\n1991 Act. Arkansas asserts that Congress also did not act pursuant to a valid grant of\nauthority. Intervenor United States and appellees respond that these issues have\nalready been decided by the Supreme Court and the Eighth Circuit, and that Congress\nvalidly abrogated the stateโs Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment provides that โ[t]he Judicial Power of the United\nStates shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or\nprosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State . . . .โ The\nUniversity of Arkansas has been recognized to have Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nSee Assad-Faltas v. University of Ark. For Med. Servs., 708 F.Supp. 1026 (E.D. Ark.\n1989), affirmed, 902 F.2d 1572 (8th Cir. 1990). Congress may abrogate such immunity,\nhowever, if it โunequivocally expresse[s] its intent to abrogate,โ by โa clear legislative\nstatement,โ and it acted โpursuant to a valid exercise of power.โ Seminole Tribe of Fla.\n\n      2\n        Although Arkansas claims that it raises an Eleventh Amendment defense to all\nof Title VII as it applies to state employers, its briefing does not specifically address\nconstitutional immunity under the provisions dealing with hostile workplace harassment\nor retaliation. We need not address complex constitutional issues that have not been\nadequately briefed. See United States v. Hercules, Inc., 247 F.3d 706, 722 (8th Cir.\n2001); Gerrard v. Larsen, 517 F.2d 1127, 1135 n.5 (8th Cir. 1975).\n                                           -7-\n\fv. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 55 (1996) (citation omitted).\n\n\n                                           A.\n\n\n        The Supreme Court addressed Title VII abrogation in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427\nU.S. 445 (1976). In Fitzpatrick the Court stated that in 1972 โCongress, acting under\nยง 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, authorized federal courts to award money damages\n. . . against a state government . . . .โ Id at 447. The Court distinguished prior cases\nwhere Congress had not exhibited an intent to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment or to\nallow a suit against a state, and it held that in Title VII โโcongressional authorizationโ\nto sue the State as employer is clearly present.โ Id. at 452 (internal citation omitted).\nSubsequent to Fitzpatrick, this court has consistently held that the 1972 and 1991 Acts\nabrogated the Eleventh Amendment. See Winbush v. Iowa, 66 F.3d 1471, 1483 (8th\nCir. 1995) (1991 Act); Greenwood v. Ross, 778 F.2d 448, 452-453 (8th Cir. 1985)\n(1972 Act). Other circuits have reached the same conclusion based on Fitzpatrick. See\nJohnson v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 215 F.3d 561, 571 (6th Cir. 2000); In re: Employment\nDiscrimination Litig. Against the State of Ala., 198 F.3d 1305, 1316-17 (11th Cir.\n1999); Ussery v. Louisiana, 150 F.3d 431, 434-35 (5th Cir. 1998); Blanciak v.\nAllegheny Ludlum Corp., 77 F.3d 690, 696 n.4 (3d Cir. 1996); Cerrato v. San\nFrancisco Cmty. Coll., 26 F.3d 968, 975-76 (9th Cir. 1994).\n\n\n       Although Arkansas argues that we should reconsider the issue because of recent\ndecisions requiring an unmistakable expression of congressional intent, we are bound\nby the Supreme Courtโs ruling in Fitzpatrick. See Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S. 203,\n237 (1997). As the Supreme Court explained in Agostini, โโ[if] a precedent of [the\nSupreme] Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected\nin some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which\ndirectly controls, leaving to [the Supreme] Court the prerogative of overruling its own\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\fdecisions.โโ Id. (citation omitted). As for existing circuit precedent, only the court en\nbanc can overrule it. See, e.g., Gipson v. KAS Snacktime Co., 171 F.3d 574, 576 n.3\n(8th Cir. 1999).\n\n\n        If we were free to reconsider Fitzpatrick and our prior case law, our study would\nlead us to conclude that Congress unmistakably expressed its intent in the 1972 Act to\nsubject states to suits under Title VII. In its amendment to the Act in 1972 Congress\nexpanded the definition of employer to include โgovernments, governmental agencies,\n[and] political subdivisions . . . .โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(a). The definition of employee\nwas also expanded to include individuals โsubject to the civil service laws of a State\ngovernment, governmental agency or political subdivision.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(f). The\nexpress exclusion of states from Title VII liability in the 1964 Act was removed. See\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(b). Read as a whole, the plain language of these provisions\ndemonstrates Congressโ intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity of the states\nin this area. See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, 74 (2000).\n\n\n       The 1991 Act expanded the available remedies against a state from backpay and\nequitable relief to include compensatory damages. See Varner v. Illinois State Univ.,\n150 F.3d 706, 717-719 (7th Cir. 1998), vacated and remanded, 120 S.Ct. 928 (2000),\nreinstated, 226 F.3d 927, 937 (7th Cir. 2000); Gehrt v. University Of Ill. Urbana-\nChampaign, 974 F. Supp. 1178, 1185 (C.D. Ill. 1997); Blankenship v. Warren County,\nVa., 931 F. Supp. 447, 450-51 (W.D. Va. 1996). Although the 1991 Act is a separate\nstatutory provision, the preamble makes clear that it was intended to amend Title VII.\nSee Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1072 (1991) (the purpose\nof the 1991 Act was to โamend the Civil Rights Act of 1964. . . to provide for damages\nin cases of intentional employment discrimination.โ); see also Kim v. Nash Finch Co.,\n123 F.3d 1046, 1062 (8th Cir. 1997) (1991 Act expanded remedies). The Act states:\n\n\n\n\n                                           -9-\n\f             In an action brought by a complaining party under section 706 or\n      717 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 . . . against a respondent who\n      engaged in unlawful intentional discrimination . . . prohibited under\n      section 703, 704, or 717 of the Act, . . . and provided that the complaining\n      party cannot recover under [42 U.S.C. ยง 1981], the complaining party\n      may recover compensatory and punitive damages as allowed in subsection\n      (b) of this section, in addition to any relief authorized by ยง 706(g) of the\n      Civil Rights Act of 1964, . . . from the respondent.\n\n\n42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a(a)(1). A โcomplaining partyโ is defined as a โperson who may\nbring an action . . . under Title VII,โ and this includes state employees. ยง\n1981a(d)(1)(A). Although the 1991 amendments do not define โrespondent,โ the\ndefinition of respondent in Title VII includes state employers. See Varner, 150 F.3d\nat 718; Gehrt, 974 F.Supp. at 1185. Congress unmistakably expressed its intent in\nthese provisions to allow compensatory damages against states.\n\n\n        The conclusion that Congress expressed its intent to abrogate the Eleventh\nAmendment for compensatory damages in the 1991 Act is supported by Lane v. Pena,\n518 U.S. 187, 194 (1996). In Lane, the Supreme Court held that another provision of\nthe 1991 Act, with language almost identical to that at issue here, contained an\nunequivocal expression of congressional intent to waive sovereign immunity for\ncompensatory damages. See id. (construing 42 U.S.C. ยง 1981a(a)(2)). Moreover,\nwhile Congress explicitly excluded states from liability for punitive damages in the\n1991 Act, it did not include a similar exclusion of states from liability for compensatory\ndamages. See ยง 1981a(b)(1); Pennsylvania v Union Gas Co., 491 U.S. 1, 13 (1989)\noverruled on other grounds by Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. 44 (1996) (โ[A] limitation of\nliability is nonsensical unless liability existed in the first place.โ).\n\n\n                                           B.\n\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\f       Not only must Congress express its clear intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity, โit must act pursuant to a valid exercise of power.โ Seminole Tribe, 517\nU.S. at 55. Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment is a grant of legislative power\nwhich Congress exercised in enacting Title VII. See Fitzpatrick, 427 U.S. at 453 n.9.\nAlthough we have previously held that the 1972 and 1991 Acts validly abrogated the\nEleventh Amendment, see Greenwood, 778 F.2d at 452-53 (1972 Act); Winbush, 66\nF.3d at 1483 (1991 Act), Arkansas urges us to reconsider those decisions in light of\nSeminole Tribe. Even if we were not bound by this precedent, we agree with the other\ncircuits which have reconsidered the issue and found that the Acts abrogated immunity.\nSee Johnson, 215 F.3d at 571; Butler v. New York State Dept. of Law, 211 F.3d 739,\n746 (2d Cir. 2000); Holman v. Indiana, 211 F.3d 399, 402 n.2 (7th Cir. 2000); Jones\nv. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 205 F.3d 428, 434 (D.C. Cir. 2000); In re:\nEmployment Discrimination Litigation Against the State of Ala., 198 F.3d at 1324;\nUssery, 150 F.3d at 435.\n\n\n      To determine whether Congress validly abrogated the Eleventh Amendment, a\ncourt must โexamine whether Congress identified a history and pattern of\nunconstitutional employment discrimination by the states [on the basis of race and\ngender].โ Board of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 121 S.Ct. 955, 964 (2000). Then\nconsideration must be given as to whether the rights and remedies created by Title VII\nare โcongruent and proportionalโ to that pattern of discrimination. Id. at 966; City of\nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 519-29 (1997).\n\n\n       Arkansas argues that Congress did not identify a history and pattern of\nunconstitutional race and gender employment discrimination by states and that the\nstudies it relied upon were limited in scope. We note that the Supreme Court has\nindicated that โlack of support in the legislative record is not determinative,โ of the\nissue. College Savs. Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v.,\n527 U.S. 627, 646 (1999). Here, however, there is much support in the congressional\n\n                                         -11-\n\frecord, for Congress did identify a pattern of discrimination by the states. See\nConnecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 449-50 (1982). The legislative history shows that\nCongress adopted\n\n\n             a report released in 1969 [by] the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\n      [which] examined equal employment opportunity in public employment\n      in seven urban areas located throughout the country--North as well as\n      South.3 The reportโs findings indicate that widespread discrimination\n      against minorities exists in State and local government employment, and\n      that the existence of this discrimination is perpetuated by the presence of\n      both institutional and overt discriminatory practices . . . . The study also\n      indicates that employment discrimination in State and local governments\n      is more pervasive than in the private sector.\n\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 92-238 (1972), reprinted in 1972 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2137, 2152. Congress\nalso relied upon another study which found that in southwestern states, Mexican\nAmericans were under represented in law enforcement and district attorney offices.\nSee id. at 2152-53.\n\n\n       In reliance on such reports as illustrations of state discrimination, Congress\nexplicitly adopted the conclusion of the Civil Rights Commission that โโState . . .\ngovernments have failed to fulfill their obligation to assure equal job opportunity . . .\n. Not only do State and local governments consciously and overtly discriminate in\nhiring and promoting minority group members, but they do not foster positive programs\nto deal with discriminatory treatment on the job.โโ Id. at 2153 (citation omitted). The\n\n\n      3\n       This study focused on 55,000 state jobs in California, Pennsylvania, Michigan,\nGeorgia, Texas, Tennessee, and Louisiana. The report contained many examples of\ndiscrimination, including segregated bathrooms in the buildings of the Louisiana\nHighway Department and the refusal of the personnel director of the Georgia State\nHighway Department to hire African American secretaries.\n                                          -12-\n\ftranscripts of floor debates also demonstrate that Congress was addressing an identified\nproblem of state discrimination. Senator Williams, the principal sponsor of the bill,\nstated that state employment discrimination was more pervasive than in the private\narena and that this well documented discrimination should be eliminated. See 118\nCong. Rec. 1815 (1972). He further noted that overwhelming statistical data and\nnumerous complaints showed that state educational institutions were engaged in\nemployment discrimination. See 118 Cong. Rec. 1992 (1972). Senators Javits, Byrd,\nand Bayh echoed his concerns. See 118 Cong. Rec. 581, 1412, 3935-36 (1972).\n\n\n       Supreme Court jurisprudence has indicated that โ[a]fter Congress has legislated\nrepeatedly in an area . . . that may reduce the need for fresh hearings and prolonged\ndebates . . . .โ Fullilove v. Klutznick, 448 U.S. 448, 503 (1972) (Powell, J.,\nconcurring). At the same time Congress was passing the 1972 Act, it was also\nconsidering the Equal Rights Amendment and the Education Opportunity Act. It held\nextensive hearings and received numerous reports detailing racial and gender\ndiscrimination by the states which were relevant to all three initiatives. See e.g., The\nPresidentโs Task Force on Womenโs Rights and Responsibilities, A Matter of Simple\nJustice 6 (Apr. 1970) (noting that educational institutions had discriminated against\nwomen); Equal Employment Opportunities Enforcement Act: Hearings Before the\nSubcomm. on Labor of the Senate Comm on Labor & Pub. Welfare, 91st Cong., 1st\nSess. 51-52 (1969) (finding that most states did not have effective job opportunity\nprograms); Higher Education Amendments of 1971: Hearings Before the Special\nSubcomm. on Educ of the House Comm. on Educ. & Labor, Pt.2 92d Cong., 1st Sess.\n1131 (1971) (showing state schools did not follow their own anti discrimination\npolicies); Equal Rights for Men & Women 1971: Hearings Before Subcomm. No. 4 of\nthe House Comm. on the Judiciary, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 269, 479, 645-650 (1971)\n(some of the most discriminatory practices were found in state educational institutions).\nThe legislative record before Congress identified a history and pattern of discrimination\nby the states on the basis of both race and gender.\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\f       Arkansas asserts that even if there was adequate legislative history, Title VII\nprohibitions are not proportional and congruent to the rights and remedies it created.\nSection 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment provides Congress with the power โto remedy\nand to deter violation of rights guaranteed thereunder by prohibiting a somewhat\nbroader swath of conduct, including that which is not itself forbidden by the\nAmendmentโs text.โ Kimel, 528 U.S. at 81. Appropriate legislation under Section 5\nmust be prophylactic or remedial rather than a congressional formulation of what it\nviews as a constitutional violation. See City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 519. โCongress,\n[however], must have wide latitude in determining where [the dividing line] lies . . . .โ\nId. at 520. The question here is whether the Title VII prohibitions against disparate\ntreatment and disparate impact discrimination place greater limits on states than the\nConstitution. See Garrett, 121 S.Ct. at 963. If so then there must be a โcongruence\nand proportionality between the injury to be prevented or remedied and the means\nadopted to that end.โ City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 520.\n\n\n       The Fourteenth Amendment prohibits intentional discrimination or disparate\ntreatment on the basis of race or gender by states unless they satisfy a difficult burden,4\nsee Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239 (1976) (race); United States v. Morrison,\n120 S.Ct. 1740, 1755 (2000) (gender), just as Title VII prohibits the same intentional\ndiscrimination. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e-2(a). As this court has previously stated, the\nelements of a claim of intentional discrimination are essentially the same under Title\nVII and the Constitution. See Briggs v. Anderson, 796 F.2d 1009, 1021 (8th Cir.\n1986). Title VII does not make acts of state unlawful that would be permitted under\nthe Constitution, and it is appropriate legislation. Congress made compensatory\n\n      4\n        Racial discrimination by a state is constitutional if it can establish a compelling\ninterest that is narrowly tailored to accomplishing that interest. See Palmore v. Sidoti,\n466 U.S. 429, 432-33 (1984). Likewise, gender discrimination by a state is\nconstitutional if it can establish an important governmental interest that is substantially\nrelated to the achievement of that interest. See Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197\n(1976).\n                                           -14-\n\fdamages a possible remedy for intentional discrimination. Based on the widespread\npattern of state discrimination Congress identified, and giving the legislative branch the\nโwide latitudeโ it is afforded in drawing an appropriate remedy, see City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 520, compensatory damages are proportional and congruent.\n\n\n       Arkansas also contends that the Title VII prohibition against disparate impact\ndiscrimination is not appropriate legislation. Since the Title VII prohibition is greater\nthan the constitutional limits on state action, see In re: Employment Discrimination\nLitig. Against the State of Ala., 198 F.3d at 1319, it must be congruent and proportional\nto the rights created. See Garrett, 121 S.Ct. at 963.\n\n\n       โCongress voiced its concern about the widespread use by state and local\ngovernmental agencies of โinvalid selection techniquesโ that had a discriminatory\nimpact.โ Teal, 457 U.S. at 449 (citations omitted). Congress recognized that โsome\n[of these] employment practices, adopted without a deliberately discriminatory motive,\nmay in operation be functionally equivalent to [unconstitutional] intentional\ndiscrimination. . . [and] may have effects that are indistinguishable from intentionally\ndiscriminatory practices.โ Watson v. Fort Worth Bank & Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 987,\n990 (1988). Such discrimination by states had the same effect as intentional\ndiscrimination, and Congress enacted in response a โprophylacticโ ban on disparate\nimpact discrimination to achieve โequality of opportunity for minority applicants\nseeking to obtain governmental positions.โ Teal, 457 U.S. at 449 (citations omitted).\nThe Title VII โprophylacticโ response to a pattern of unconstitutional state action is\nproportional and congruent. See In Re: Employment Discrimination Litig. Against the\nState Of Ala., 198 F.3d at 1321-24.\n\n\n                                           C.\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f       Since Congress expressed its unequivocal intent to abrogate immunity and acted\npursuant to its constitutional authority, it validly abrogated the Eleventh Amendment\nfor claims of disparate treatment and impact on the basis of gender and race. The\ndistrict courts did not err in denying the state or its officials Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity on the Title VII claims.\n\n\n                                            III.\n\n\n       Arkansas argues that the state law claims of Schilcher and Okruhlik against the\nofficials in their individual capacities are barred under the Eleventh Amendment and\nstate immunity law. It also asserts that the district court erred in accepting pendent\njurisdiction and that Schilcher failed to stated a claim.\n\n\n       Arkansas asserts that the Eleventh Amendment bars the state claims because a\nsuit against state officials in their individual capacity triggers the state indemnification\nstatute, which makes the state the real party in interest. Officials sued in their\nindividual capacity for acts outside their official duties, however, are generally not\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, see Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 757\n(1999), and state statutes that indemnify individuals from the consequences of carrying\nout their duties do not alone make the state the real party in interest. See Griess v.\nColorado, 841 F.2d 1042, 1045-46 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\n\n       Arkansas also contends that the state claims are barred by state immunity, that\nthe district court used the wrong standard for malice, that the plaintiffs failed to plead\nsufficient factual allegations for their state law claims, and that some of the claims may\nonly properly be filed against the University itself. Arkansas can assert constitutional\nsovereign immunity or statutory immunity when it is sued. See Article V, Section 20,\nARK. CODE. ANN. ยง 19-10-305. When a state indemnification statute covers an\n\n                                            -16-\n\fofficialโs actions which are the basis of the lawsuit, Arkansas is the real party and can\nassert state immunity. See Newton v. Etock 965 S.W.2d 96, 100 (Ark. 1998). In\nArkansas there is an exception for malicious acts or omissions, however. See ARK.\nCODE. ANN. ยงยง 19-10-305 & 21-9-203(a); Newton, 965 S.W.2d at 100. To prove\nmalice a plaintiff must present evidence that the state official had an โan intent and\ndisposition to do a wrongful act greatly injurious to another . . . a conscious violation\nof the law . . . .โ Fuqua v. Flowers, 20 S.W.3d 388, 391 (2000) (citations omitted).\n\n\n       The district court cited and applied the relevant standard for malice. See id.\nNotice pleading is permitted under federal procedure, and it was not necessary for the\nplaintiffs to plead detailed facts establishing malice. See Hanna v. Plumer, 380 U.S.\n460 (1965). Even if Arkansas pleading rules applied, however, the complaints alleged\nmalice. Schilcher pled that one official demanded that a favorable review of hers be\nmade less positive, that another placed a false and negative letter into her file, and that\nthe defendants made defamatory statements. Okruhlik pled that an official took credit\nfor an article she wrote and that other officials miscategorized her article as\nnonrefereed, subjected her to a more stringent evaluation, publically criticized her\nresearch and publications, and assigned her a teaching schedule that would interfere\nwith her research. The district court did not err in denying the motions to dismiss\nclaims based on state immunity.5\n\n\n       Arkansas also contends that Schilcher failed to state a claim for defamation and\ninvasion of privacy and failed to state claims against Hoyt Purvis. This court lacks\njurisdiction on interlocutory appeal to determine whether pleadings stated pendent state\ntort claims; our resolution of immunity issues did not encompass those issues. See\n\n\n      5\n       The district court did not err in entertaining the pendent state claims because,\nas Arkansas has conceded, the same facts are involved. See Williams v. Ragnone, 147\nF.3d 700, 703 (8th Cir. 1998).\n                                           -17-\n\fKincade, 64 F.3d at 394; Eagle v. Morgan, 88 F.3d 620, 629 (8th Cir. 1996).\n\n\n                                           IV.\n\n\n       After a thorough review, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying\nthe motions to dismiss on the grounds of Eleventh Amendment or state immunity, that\nthe district court properly exercised pendent jurisdiction, and that we lack jurisdiction\nto address the remaining issues on interlocutory appeal.

The cases were brought\nby two professors and several administrative staff against the University of Arkansas,\nthrough its board of trustees and individual state officials, for sex and race\ndiscrimination and harassment under Title VII and state law. In each case the district\ncourt1 ruled that the Title VII claims were not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. The\nstate of Arkansas appealed, and the United States intervened in two of the cases. We\naffirm.\n\n      1\n      The Honorable Jimm L. Hendren, Chief Judge, United States District Court for\nthe Western District of Arkansas, presided in the cases filed by the professors.\n\n       The Honorable George Howard, Jr., United States District Judge for the Eastern\nDistrict of Arkansas, presided in the staff case.\n                                         -4-\n\f                                            I.\n\n       Gwenn Okruhlik, a tenure track professor of political science and member of the\nMiddle East Studies Program (MES), sued the University trustees and various state\nofficials in their individual and official capacities for disparate treatment and impact\ndiscrimination on the basis of her gender. She also claimed that she was subjected to\nhostile workplace harassment and retaliation and that Arkansas had violated the\nConstitution and state law. In support of her claims, Okruhlik set out detailed factual\nallegations claiming that male colleagues, including Bernard L. Madison, Dean of the\nCollege of Arts and Sciences, had made discriminatory and sexually derogatory\nstatements and conspired to discredit her work. Okruhlik also alleged that she was\nsubjected to more stringent tenure review than her male colleagues.\n\n       Linda Schilcher, a professor of history and member of MES, sued the University\ntrustees and state officials in their individual and official capacities for disparate\ntreatment on the basis of race and gender and hostile environment sexual harassment,\nin violation of Title VII and the Arkansas Civil Rights Act. She also alleged violations\nof the Constitution and other state law. Schilcher alleged that she was discriminated\nagainst in terms of her employment, especially in allocation of professional funding, and\nthat she repeatedly received disparaging comments because of her race and gender.\nSchilcher claims that Dean Madison demanded that her tenure review be negative and\nthat the director of MES placed a false letter in her file.\n\n       Administrative staff members Ester Lunnie, Dorothy Robinson, Jean Crockett,\nand Gayle Portis sued the board of trustees and school officials in their official and\nindividual capacities, alleging racial discrimination in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C.\nยง 1981, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, and the Fourteenth Amendment. They alleged that Arkansas\ndenied them promotions and terminated them due to their race and provided them less\nfavorable working conditions than white employees. Lunnie and Robinson also alleged\nthat they were retaliated against for filing an EEOC complaint.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f        In each case Arkansas filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that the Eleventh\nAmendment barred all Title VII claims. Arkansas asserted in addition that the state\nclaims of Okruhlik and Schilcher were barred by the Eleventh Amendment and state\nimmunity and that Schilcher had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted. The district court held that the Title VII claims were not barred because\nCongress had validly abrogated the statesโs Eleventh Amendment immunity. The state\nclaims against the officials in their individual capacity were not dismissed because they\nsatisfied the malice exception to Arkansas immunity law. The court also found that\nSchilcher had stated a claim.\n\n       The Arkansas defendants filed three interlocutory appeals, arguing that the\nEleventh Amendment bars Title VII claims against the state, that Arkansas law bars the\npendent state claims, and that Schilcher did not state a claim. The plaintiffs and the\nUnited States respond that Congress abrogated the Eleventh Amendment in enacting\nTitle VII, and the professors further argue that their state law claims satisfy the malice\nexception to immunity and that we lack jurisdiction at this point on whether Schilcher\nhas stated a claim.\n\n                                           II.\n\n       Appellate review is generally not available until after final judgment except for\nimmunity issues and issues โinextricably intertwinedโ with those properly before the\ncourt at the interlocutory stage.

All parties also agree that the\nissues of Eleventh Amendment immunity are properly before the court on these\nappeals.\n\n\n       Arkansas argues that claims of disparate treatment and disparate impact\ndiscrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Equal\nEmployment Opportunity Act of 1972 (1972 Act) and the Civil Rights Act of\n1991(1991 Act), are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.2 Arkansas contends that\nCongress did not abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in these statutes because it did not\nmake an unmistakably clear expression of its intent to do so in the 1972 Act or in the\n1991 Act. Arkansas asserts that Congress also did not act pursuant to a valid grant of\nauthority. Intervenor United States and appellees respond that these issues have\nalready been decided by the Supreme Court and the Eighth Circuit, and that Congress\nvalidly abrogated the stateโs Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n\n       The Eleventh Amendment provides that โ[t]he Judicial Power of the United\nStates shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or\nprosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State . . . .โ The\nUniversity of Arkansas has been recognized to have Eleventh Amendment immunity.\nSee Assad-Faltas v.

In its amendment to the Act in 1972 Congress\nexpanded the definition of employer to include โgovernments, governmental agencies,\n[and] political subdivisions . . . .โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(a). The definition of employee\nwas also expanded to include individuals โsubject to the civil service laws of a State\ngovernment, governmental agency or political subdivision.โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(f). The\nexpress exclusion of states from Title VII liability in the 1964 Act was removed. See\n42 U.S.C. ยง 2000e(b). Read as a whole, the plain language of these provisions\ndemonstrates Congressโ intent to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity of the states\nin this area. See Kimel v.

Congress unmistakably expressed its intent in\nthese provisions to allow compensatory damages against states.\n\n\n        The conclusion that Congress expressed its intent to abrogate the Eleventh\nAmendment for compensatory damages in the 1991 Act is supported by Lane v.

In Lane, the Supreme Court held that another provision of\nthe 1991 Act, with language almost identical to that at issue here, contained an\nunequivocal expression of congressional intent to waive sovereign immunity for\ncompensatory damages.

The study also\n      indicates that employment discrimination in State and local governments\n      is more pervasive than in the private sector.\n\n\nH.R. Rep.

Senator Williams, the principal sponsor of the bill,\nstated that state employment discrimination was more pervasive than in the private\narena and that this well documented discrimination should be eliminated. See 118\nCong. Rec. 1815 (1972). He further noted that overwhelming statistical data and\nnumerous complaints showed that state educational institutions were engaged in\nemployment discrimination.

At the same time Congress was passing the 1972 Act, it was also\nconsidering the Equal Rights Amendment and the Education Opportunity Act.

Appropriate legislation under Section 5\nmust be prophylactic or remedial rather than a congressional formulation of what it\nviews as a constitutional violation.

The question here is whether the Title VII prohibitions against disparate\ntreatment and disparate impact discrimination place greater limits on states than the\nConstitution.

Based on the widespread\npattern of state discrimination Congress identified, and giving the legislative branch the\nโwide latitudeโ it is afforded in drawing an appropriate remedy, see City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 520, compensatory damages are proportional and congruent.\n\n\n       Arkansas also contends that the Title VII prohibition against disparate impact\ndiscrimination is not appropriate legislation. Since the Title VII prohibition is greater\nthan the constitutional limits on state action, see In re: Employment Discrimination\nLitig. Against the State of Ala., 198 F.3d at 1319, it must be congruent and proportional\nto the rights created. See Garrett, 121 S.Ct. at 963.\n\n\n       โCongress voiced its concern about the widespread use by state and local\ngovernmental agencies of โinvalid selection techniquesโ that had a discriminatory\nimpact.โ Teal, 457 U.S. at 449 (citations omitted). Congress recognized that โsome\n[of these] employment practices, adopted without a deliberately discriminatory motive,\nmay in operation be functionally equivalent to [unconstitutional] intentional\ndiscrimination. . .

It also asserts that the district court erred in accepting pendent\njurisdiction and that Schilcher failed to stated a claim.\n\n\n       Arkansas asserts that the Eleventh Amendment bars the state claims because a\nsuit against state officials in their individual capacity triggers the state indemnification\nstatute, which makes the state the real party in interest. Officials sued in their\nindividual capacity for acts outside their official duties, however, are generally not\nentitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity, see Alden v.

Even if Arkansas pleading rules applied, however, the complaints alleged\nmalice. Schilcher pled that one official demanded that a favorable review of hers be\nmade less positive, that another placed a false and negative letter into her file, and that\nthe defendants made defamatory statements. Okruhlik pled that an official took credit\nfor an article she wrote and that other officials miscategorized her article as\nnonrefereed, subjected her to a more stringent evaluation, publically criticized her\nresearch and publications, and assigned her a teaching schedule that would interfere\nwith her research. The district court did not err in denying the motions to dismiss\nclaims based on state immunity.5\n\n\n       Arkansas also contends that Schilcher failed to state a claim for defamation and\ninvasion of privacy and failed to state claims against Hoyt Purvis. This court lacks\njurisdiction on interlocutory appeal to determine whether pleadings stated pendent state\ntort claims; our resolution of immunity issues did not encompass those issues.
