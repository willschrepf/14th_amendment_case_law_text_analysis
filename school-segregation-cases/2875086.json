The women inmates originally brought this 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\naction against Department officials alleging discriminatory treatment and\nseeking injunctive relief.        Only two issues have been raised in this\nappeal.    The female prisoners contend that the District Court erred in\nrejecting their claims that prison officials discriminated against them on\nthe basis of gender in violation of the Equal Protection Clause by failing\nto provide them with equal access (1) to post-secondary educational\nprograms and (2) to prison industry employment.            The District Court held\nthat the availability of post-secondary educational courses hinged on\nfiscal decisions made by the academic providers and on a lack of demand by\nfemale inmates rather than on any discriminatory action taken by the\nDepartment.    The Department has since filed a motion to dismiss as moot the\nfemale inmates' appeal regarding post-secondary educational opportunities.\nWe agreed to take this motion into consideration with the merits of the\ncase and hereby grant the Department's motion to dismiss this portion of\nthe case as moot.       To that extent, the order of the District Court is\nvacated.      As to the prison industries claim, the District Court found\ninsufficient evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of Department\nofficials to support an equal protection challenge.           Concluding that the\nDistrict Court's finding of no discriminatory intent is not clearly\nerroneous, and further concluding that the female inmates are not similarly\nsituated to male inmates for purposes of equal protection analysis, we\naffirm the District Court's order dismissing this claim.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Honorable Scott O. Wright, United States District Judge\nfor the Western District of Missouri, adopting the Report and\nRecommendation of The Honorable William A. Knox, United States\nMagistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f                                     I.\n\n\n      The facts of the case are not in dispute.           Male and female inmates\nincarcerated   within   Missouri   Department   of       Corrections   prisons    are\n                                                     2\nsegregated into particular facilities by gender.          The Department operates\nfifteen penal institutions, two of which, the Renz Correctional Center3\n(Renz) and the Chillicothe Correctional Center (Chillicothe), house solely\nadult female inmates.    Corrected Joint Stipulations, Appellant's App. at\n27.   The vast majority of the total inmate population in adult institutions\nin Missouri, approximately ninety-five percent, is male.         Id. at 28.      Both\nmale and female inmates are assigned custody level classifications ranging\nfrom minimum security, C1, to maximum security, C5, and these designations\naffect inmate housing assignments within the gender-segregated facilities.\nGenerally, the higher custody classifications, C4 and C5, are assigned to\nmale and female inmates with longer sentences to serve and to shorter-term\ninmates of both genders who represent an increased security risk.             Female\ninmate custody levels range from C1 through C3 at Chillicothe and from C3\nthrough C5 at Renz.\n\n\n\n\n          2\n       Appellants do not challenge the constitutionality of this\ngender-based classification. See Women Prisoners of the Dist. of\nColumbia Dep't of Corrections v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910,\n926 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Pitts v. Thornburgh, 866 F.2d 1450, 1458-59\n(D.C. Cir. 1989).\n      3\n      The Magistrate Judge observed that, due to extensive flooding\nwhich occurred in July and August, 1993, Renz was evacuated and the\nfemale inmates at the facility were moved to facilities that\nnormally house only male inmates, including Central Missouri\nCorrectional Center (CMCC) and Fulton Reception and Diagnostic\nCenter (FRDC). The majority of the females from Renz were moved to\nCMCC and will remain at that institution during the emergency\nconditions created by flood waters. Renz will not be reopened in\nthe immediate future, if at all, due to considerable damage to the\nfacility. Interim arrangements for educational classes and prison\nindustries have been implemented.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f     Approximately 725 female inmates are incarcerated in the Department's\nfemale-only prisons, some 420 at Chillicothe and some 305 at Renz.4\nApproximately 13,000 male inmates are incarcerated in the Department's\nmale-only   prisons,   some   1200   at    Algoa    Correctional      Center;    900    at\nBooneville;   1200   at   Central    Missouri      Correctional     Center;     1800    at\nFarmington Correctional Center; 2000 at Jefferson City Correctional Center;\n1265 at Moberly Correctional Center; 1100 at Missouri Eastern Correctional\nCenter; 500 at Potosi Correctional Center; 2000 at Western Missouri\nCorrectional Center; and 600 at Ozark Correctional Center.\n\n\n     Female inmates incarcerated at the Renz and Chillicothe facilities\nhave access to the same adult basic education and G.E.D. programs as male\ninmates.    Both male and female prisoners can take advantage of college-\nlevel correspondence courses at their own expense.            Post-secondary courses\nconducted within the confines of the prison facilities are offered by\ncommunity colleges, state universities, and private colleges, and not by\nthe Department itself.    Educational institutions enter into agreements with\nthe Department for access to physical space within both male and female\nprisons and for administrative support, such as security and assistance in\nenrolling the inmates.    Decisions regarding the number and variety of post-\nsecondary programs offered at a particular prison facility are made by the\neducational   institutions    involved     and     not   by   the   Department.        The\nDepartment requires that any courses that the schools choose to offer be\nof the same quality as those the schools offer to their on-campus students.\n\n\n     Prison enterprises are operated by Missouri Correctional Enterprises\n(MCE), a private, self-supporting, profit-making enterprise that does not\nreceive funding from the Missouri General\n\n\n\n\n       4\n       Renz was originally a male institution, then housed both\nwomen and men, and finally became a women's prison in December\n1989.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fAssembly.     Twenty-one such enterprises are located at male institutions and\nthree at female institutions.            Report and Recommendation at 10.           Male\ninmates have a broader range of industry job opportunities, but industries\nare located at both women's facilities and only at some of the male\nfacilities.     Id.   For fiscal year 1991, approximately thirteen percent of\nthe   total    female   inmate   population     was   employed   in    prison   industry\nprograms.      Corrected Joint Stipulations, Appellant's App. at 28, 36.\nDuring the same time period, only eight percent of the total male inmate\npopulation was so employed.        Id.\n\n\n                                          II.\n\n\n      We first consider the Department's motion to dismiss as moot the\nwomen prisoners' claim that Department officials purposely discriminated\nagainst them on the basis of gender in the management                 of post-secondary\neducational opportunities.       During the pendency of this appeal, Department\nofficials terminated their former practice of allowing outside educators\naccess to male and female prison facilities for the purposes of providing\ncollege-level courses to inmates.         Affidavit of John J. Bell in support of\nAppellee's Motion to Dismiss Point I of Appellants' Appeal as Moot.\nNeither male nor female prisoners are currently provided this opportunity,\na fact appellants do not contest.\n\n\n      A claim is properly dismissed as moot if it \"has lost its character\nas a present, live controversy of the kind that must exist if we are to\navoid advisory opinions on abstract questions of law.\"            Princeton Univ. v.\nSchmid, 455 U.S. 100, 103 (1982) (per curiam) (quotations and citations\nomitted) (holding that university's amendment of regulation made moot a\nchallenge to regulations).        Where, as here,\n\n\n      (1) it can be said with assurance that there is no reasonable\n      expectation . . . that the alleged violation\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f     will recur, and (2) interim relief or events have completely\n     and irrevocably eradicated the effects of the alleged violation\n     . . . it may be said that the case is moot because neither\n     party has a legally cognizable interest in the final\n     determination of the underlying questions of fact and law.\n\n\nCounty of Los Angeles v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979) (quotations and\ncitations omitted).     Here, prison officials have abandoned the post-\nsecondary educational programs about which the women prisoners complained.5\nThere is no indication that Department officials will reinstate these\neducational programs.   In these circumstances, the requested relief--equal\naccess to such programs by both male and female inmates--has become an\nabstraction, and this aspect of the case has \"lost its character as a\npresent, live controversy.\"   Schmid, 455 U.S. at 103 (quotation omitted).\nAs a result, we conclude that the women prisoners' equal protection claim\nconcerning post-secondary educational programs is moot and we grant the\nDepartment's motion to dismiss this claim.   Those portions of the District\nCourt's order dealing with this claim are vacated.        United States v.\nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950); Cranford v. Nix, 43 F.3d 1210,\n1211 (8th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n                                    III.\n\n\n     We turn now to the women's contention that Department officials'\npolicy for determining the placement of prison industries is exercised in\na manner that violates the Equal Protection Clause.   To establish a gender-\nbased claim under the Equal Protection Clause, the appellants must, as a\nthreshold matter, demonstrate that they have been treated differently by\na state actor than others who are similarly situated simply because\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      At oral argument, counsel advised the Court that inmates no\nlonger are able to secure federal financial assistance for\nenrolling in these educational programs. Colleges and universities\nthat offered these programs at Department prisons have elected to\ndiscontinue the practice for economic reasons.\n\n                                    -6-\n\fappellants belong to a particular protected class.    See, e.g., Klinger v.\nDepartment of Corrections, 31 F.3d 727, 731 (8th Cir. 1994), cert. denied,\n115 S. Ct. 1177 (1995).   In general, the Equal Protection Clause requires\nthat the government treat such similarly situated persons alike.       See,\ne.g., City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439\n(1985); Klinger, 31 F.3d at 731; Moreland v. United States, 968 F.2d 655,\n660 (8th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1028 (1992).     Treatment\nof dissimilarly situated persons in a dissimilar manner by the government\ndoes not violate the Equal Protection Clause.   Klinger, 31 F.3d at 731; see\nBarket, Levy & Fine, Inc. v. St. Louis Thermal Energy Corp., 21 F.3d 237,\n242 (8th Cir. 1994); Women Prisoners of the Dist. of Columbia Dep't. of\nCorrections v. District of Columbia, 93 F.3d 910, 924 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\nTherefore, the initial inquiry in any equal protection claim is whether the\nplaintiff has established that she was treated differently than others who\nare similarly situated to her.   Klinger, 31 F.3d at 731; United States v.\nWhiton, 48 F.3d 356, 358 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, 116 S. Ct. 227 (1995).\nAs we observed in Klinger, \"Absent a threshold showing that she is\nsimilarly situated to those who allegedly receive favorable treatment, the\nplaintiff does not have a viable equal protection claim.\"   31 F.3d at 731.\n\n\n     Thus, before we may entertain the merits of the female inmates' equal\nprotection claim, we must first determine whether women incarcerated by the\nMissouri Department of Corrections are similarly situated, for purposes of\nthe program in issue, to men likewise incarcerated.      Whether the female\ninmates are similarly situated to male inmates requires an inquiry focusing\non the purposes of the challenged government action, namely, the assignment\nof prison industry programs among the various institutions controlled by\nthe Department.   See More v. Farrier, 984 F.2d 269, 271 (8th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 510 U.S. 819 (1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f     In   Klinger,    this   Court   was    asked    to   determine    whether   female\nprisoners, all of whom were incarcerated at the Nebraska Center for Women\n(NCW), were subjected to gender discrimination by the Department of\nCorrectional Services in violation of the Equal Protection Clause due to\nthe alleged inferiority of the vocational, educational, and employment\nopportunities and programs offered to women in comparison to those offered\nto male prisoners incarcerated at Nebraska State Penitentiary (NSP), one\nof a number of male-only prisons.        31 F.3d at 729.       This Court held, as a\nmatter of law, that female inmates at NCW and male inmates at NSP were not\nsimilarly situated for purposes of prison programs and services and,\ntherefore, that the plaintiffs failed to establish a violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause.     Id. at 731.\n\n\n     In arriving at our conclusion that the male and female inmates in\nKlinger were dissimilarly situated, we considered a number of factors\nincluding prison population size, average length of sentence, security\nclassification, types of crimes, and other special characteristics.                Id.\nat 731-32; see also Pargo v. Elliott, 894 F. Supp. 1243, 1259 (S.D. Iowa\n1995), aff'd, 69 F.3d 280 (8th Cir.), cert. denied, No. 95-8906, 1996 WL\n271195 (U.S. Oct. 7, 1996).     Because a comparison of these factors between\nthe male inmates at NSP and the female inmates at NCW revealed a wide\ndisparity in each category, this Court concluded that \"the programs at NSP\nand NCW reflect separate sets of decisions based on entirely different\ncircumstances.\"   Klinger, 31 F.3d at 732.          Programming decisions regarding\nindustry and education differed from prison to prison, \"depending on\ninnumerable variables that officials must take into account\" and not on\nillegitimate, discriminatory factors.          Id.    Analysis of the sort that we\nemployed in Klinger leads us to the same result in the present case.\n\n\n     Initially,      the   irrefutable     differences      between   the   female-only\nfacilities, Renz and Chillicothe, and the various institutions housing male\ninmates in Missouri must be acknowledged.            Most\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fnotably, because women account for such a small proportion of the total\nprison population, their facilities are necessarily smaller in size than\nany of the male-only prisons.\n\n\n     Taking into account security classification levels in addition to\npopulation size further illustrates that female inmates are dissimilarly\nsituated from male inmates.     For example, Chillicothe has a population of\n430 female inmates assigned the lowest classification levels ranging from\nC1 through C3.     Corrected Joint Stipulations, Appellant's App. at 27, 28.\nThe most comparable male institution with respect to population size,\nPotosi Correctional Center with 500 inmates, bears no resemblance to\nChillicothe with respect to security levels, as it houses only male\nprisoners assigned the highest security classification, C5.               Id. at 27.\nThe male institutions most comparable to Chillicothe with respect to\nsecurity classification, Central Missouri Correctional Center and Western\nMissouri Correctional Center, which both confine inmates classified at\nlevels C2 and C3, house considerably larger inmate populations, namely,\n1000 men at Central Missouri and 1975 men at Western Missouri.                Id.\n\n\n     The average sentence length for female inmates as compared to male\ninmates confirms that these two diverse groups are not similarly situated.\nSignificantly fewer female inmates will be serving lengthy prison sentences\nin comparison to male inmates.       This observation is evidenced by the vast\ndisparity in the number of female inmates classified as medium or maximum\nsecurity   risks    as   compared   to   the   number   of   male   inmates   likewise\nclassified.   See Corrected Joint Stipulations, Appellant's App. at 27-28.\nA small number of women prisoners, approximately 305, are assigned the\nhighest security classifications, thereby indicating that they will be\nincarcerated for extended periods of time.        In contrast, roughly 6700 male\ninmates have been assigned the highest security classifications and will,\ntherefore, likely be serving lengthy prison sentences.              This distinction\nalso tends to establish that\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fmale inmates have been convicted of more serious crimes, thus justifying\nthe higher security classifications associated with lengthier prison\nsentences.\n\n\n        As is apparent from the above observations, male and female inmates\nincarcerated in Department prisons are far from similarly situated for\npurposes of equal protection analysis.      In determining the availability and\nlocation of prison programs and services, officials \"must balance many\nconsiderations, ranging from the characteristics of the inmates at that\nprison to the size of the institution, to determine the optimal mix of\nprograms and services.\"   Klinger, 31 F.3d at 732; see Turner v. Safley, 482\nU.S. 78, 84-85 (1987).     Because these considerations are diverse and the\ncircumstances of each prison are different, female inmates as a group and\nmale inmates as a group simply cannot be considered similarly situated for\npurposes of comparing the availability and variety of prison programming.\nThe size of the institution, its location, and the types of inmates housed\nthere necessarily will affect the number, type, and length of programs\noffered.\n\n\n        The women prisoners urge this Court to conduct a program-by-program\ncomparison between Department prisons housing solely female inmates and\nthose    housing only male inmates to confirm the existence of gender\ndiscrimination.     We reject that approach to equal protection analysis of\nthe Department's placement of prison industries.         There can be no such\nmeaningful comparison for equal protection purposes between two sets of\ninmates    who are not similarly situated.         See, e.g., Association of\nResidential Resources v. Gomez, 51 F.3d 137, 140-41 (8th Cir. 1995);\nKlinger, 31 F.3d at 733; Women Prisoners of the District of Columbia, 93\nF.3d at 927.   The substantial differences discussed above between male and\nfemale prisoners demonstrate the dissimilarity of the two distinct groups\nand the irrelevance of any attempt to compare the number or type of\nprograms offered.    Furthermore, this Court concluded in Klinger that \"using\nan inter-prison program comparison\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fto analyze equal protection claims improperly assumes that the Constitution\nrequires all prisons to have similar program priorities and to allocate\nresources similarly.\"      31 F.3d at 732.       We also noted that inter-prison\nprogram   comparison    \"results   in   precisely   the   type   of   federal   court\ninterference with and 'micro-management' of prisons that Turner condemned.\"\nKlinger, 31 F.3d at 733 (following Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78 (1987)).\n\n\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we hold that male and female prisoners are\nnot similarly situated for purposes of an equal protection comparison of\nprison industry programs.\n\n\n                                        IV.\n\n\n     Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that male and female inmates\nwere similarly situated for purposes of the Department's placement of\nprison industries, an equal protection review of Department decisions\nrequires further analysis.         It must be determined whether the unequal\ntreatment    in   accessibility    to   prison   industry   employment    allegedly\nresulting from gender discrimination stems from a Department policy that\nis facially neutral or from a policy that, on its face, classifies by\ngender.     A facially gender-based classification is subject to heightened\nscrutiny and violates the Equal Protection Clause if the classification is\nnot substantially related to the achievement of important governmental\nobjectives.       United States v. Virginia, 116 S. Ct. 2264, 2275 (1996);\nPersonnel Adm'r v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 273 (1979); Mississippi Univ. for\nWomen v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, 724 (1982).\n\n\n     A facially neutral policy, on the other hand, is not subject to the\nsame exacting standard as it does not categorize on the basis of a quasi-\nsuspect class.      If, however, a neutral policy employed by the Department\nhas a disproportionately adverse effect upon women, it is unconstitutional\nunder the Equal Protection\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fClause only if that impact can be traced to a discriminatory purpose.\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 272.\n\n\n     When a statute gender-neutral on its face is challenged on the\n     ground that its effects upon women are disproportionately\n     adverse, a twofold inquiry is . . . appropriate. The first\n     question is whether the statutory classification is indeed\n     neutral in the sense that it is not gender based.       If the\n     classification itself, covert or overt, is not based upon\n     gender, the second question is whether the adverse effect\n     reflects invidious gender-based discrimination.\n\n\nId. at 274; see Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 264-66 (1977); Marshall v. Kirkland, 602 F.2d 1282,\n1299 (8th Cir. 1979).   If the adverse impact of a facially neutral policy\ncannot be plausibly explained on a neutral ground, the impact itself would\nsignal that the real classification made by the policy was in fact not\nneutral.6   Feeney, 442 U.S. at 275.\n\n\n     Here, the women prisoners do not challenge the Department policy of\nsegregating male and female prisoners by gender.   Rather they challenge the\nDepartment policy which determines the placement of a particular prison\nindustry at a specific penal facility.       It is this policy that the\nappellants contend results in a disparate impact on female prisoners and\nconstitutes a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.       The disparate\nimpact, according to the female inmates, is evidenced through the placement\nof stereotypically female jobs at the Renz and Chillicothe facilities and\nthe exclusion of female inmates from the more skilled and industrial jobs\nlocated at male prisons.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n     As we noted in Ricketts v. City of Columbia, 36 F.3d 775, 781\n(8th Cir. 1994), \"in only a few cases, where a facially neutral\npolicy impacted exclusively against one suspect class and that\nimpact was unexplainable on neutral grounds, has the impact alone\nsignalled a discriminatory purpose. See Gomillion v. Lightfoot,\n364 U.S. 339 (1960); Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356 (1886).\"\n\n                                   -12-\n\f       Initially,       we    note   that    the   statutory   provisions       granting   the\nDepartment authority to establish and monitor prison industries are gender-\nneutral on their face.               See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. ยง 217.550 (1994).\nLikewise, a review of Department officials' testimony indicates that\nDepartment policy for the placement of prison industries is based on\nfactors such as population size, availability of a steady work force, and\nlocation of the prison in relation to potential purchasers of industry\nproducts, not on the basis of gender considerations.                 Department officials\nhave       countered        the   appellants'        allegations    of    gender-motivated\ndiscrimination with a plausible explanation for the alleged disparate\nimpact.      As such, it is appellants' burden to establish that the adverse\neffect this Department policy has on women inmates is the result of a\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\n\n       The       District    Court   found    that    the   scope   of   prison   enterprise\nopportunities provided to male and female inmates \"appears directly related\nto the size and location of the prisons and a recognition that more male\ninmates      are    available     for   long-term      manufacturing     jobs     than   women\n             7\ninmates.\"         Report and Recommendation at 10.\n\n\n       Because the policy challenged by the appellants is neutral on its\nface, the female prisoners must establish that the alleged disparate impact\nis the result of discriminatory purpose.               We agree with the District Court\nthat appellants have failed to prove the requisite discriminatory intent\non the part of Department officials.               Assuming as a threshold matter that\nthe women prisoners\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      The statutory mandate bestowing on the Department the power\nto establish prison industries instructs that the director shall\ntake into account:     \"offender custody levels, the number of\noffenders in each correctional center so the best service or\ndistribution of labor may be secured, location and convenience of\nthe correctional centers in relation to the other correctional\ncenters to be supplied or served and the machinery presently\ncontained in each correctional center.\"          Mo. Rev. Stat.\nยง 217.550(1) (1994).\n\n                                              -13-\n\fhave demonstrated disparate impact, their equal protection claim will fail\nnonetheless without a showing of discriminatory intent.                    See Feeney, 442\nU.S. at 274; Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265.          \"'Discriminatory purpose'\n. . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of\nconsequences.    It   implies    that   the    decisionmaker     .    .    .    selected   or\nreaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part 'because of,' not\nmerely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\"\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 279 (citation and footnote omitted).\n\n\n     The District Court's findings show that prison industry jobs are\nlocated at both women's facilities and only at certain male facilities.\nReport and Recommendation at 10.        A proportionately larger number of female\ninmates have prison industry jobs than do male inmates, and the data-entry\nindustry located at the Renz facility, criticized by plaintiffs as a\nstereotypically female occupation, formerly employed male inmates when the\ninstitution housed males.       Department officials testified that the location\nof prison industries was motivated not by stereotypes but by legitimate\nconcerns such as work force stability and proximity to clientele.                      Thus,\nas the District Court found, the evidence does not support a claim that the\nDepartment's    placement   of     prison      industry   jobs       was       intentionally\ndiscriminatory or gender-motivated.           See also Klinger, 31 F.3d at 733-34;\nPargo, 894 F. Supp. at 1280; Women Prisoners of the Dist. of Columbia, 93\nF.3d at 925.\n\n\n     Because no two prisons are the same, it is a virtual certainty that\ninmates in one prison will have certain amenities not available to inmates\nin another.     \"Thus, female inmates can always point out certain ways in\nwhich male prisons are 'better' than theirs, just as male inmates can\nalways point out other ways in which female prisons are 'better' than\ntheirs.\"   Klinger, 31 F.3d at 732; see also Women Prisoners of the Dist.\nof Columbia, 93 F.3d at 926-27.         \"Differences between challenged programs\nat . . .   prisons are virtually irrelevant because so many variables affect\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fthe mix of programming that an institution has. . . . In short, comparing\nprograms . . . is like the proverbial comparison of apples to oranges.\"\nKlinger, 31 F.3d at 733.           When attempts are made to compare programs\noffered at facilities housing inmates who are not similarly situated, \"it\nis hardly surprising, let alone evidence of discrimination, that the\nsmaller correctional facility offered fewer programs than the larger one.\"\nWomen Prisoners of the Dist. of Columbia, 93 F.3d at 925.\n\n\n                                               V.\n\n\n     For   the   reasons   stated,        we    affirm     the   District   Court's    order\ndismissing the appellants' equal protection claim with respect to prison\nindustry programs and grant the Department's motion to dismiss as moot\nappellants' equal protection claim regarding post-secondary educational\nopportunities.    The order of the District Court is vacated insofar as it\ndeals with the latter claim.\n\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n     I   agree   that   the   female      inmates'       claim    that   prison   officials\npurposefully discriminated against them in the management of post-secondary\neducational programs is rendered moot by the correction department's\nunfortunate   suspension      of    all        contracts    with    local   colleges     and\nuniversities to offer post-secondary and vocational courses to either male\nor female inmates.      I disagree, however, with the majority's conclusion\nthat the class of female inmates is not similarly situated to male inmates\nfor the purpose of challenging the assignment and organization of prison\nindustry programs under the Equal Protection Clause.                I also disagree that\nthe female inmates have failed to show discriminatory intent on the part\nof the Department of Corrections.          Therefore, I respectfully dissent from\nParts III and IV of the majority's opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f      I do not quarrel with the majority's citation to the basic rule that\na party seeking relief for gender-based discrimination under the Equal\nProtection Clause must demonstrate that a state actor has treated her\ndifferently than other similarly situated persons because of her gender.\nNor do I dispute the corollary rule that a state may treat dissimilarly\nsituated persons in a dissimilar manner.            In my view, however, the court\nis wrong to adopt an overly formalistic approach to the threshold question\nof whether female and male inmates are similarly situated.\n\n\n     While the court in Klinger v. Department of Corrections, 31 F.3d 727,\n731 (8th Cir. 1994), compared inmate populations, length of sentences, and\nsecurity classifications in holding that female inmates at one Iowa prison\nwere dissimilarly situated from male inmates at another institution, such\nfactors   should   not    be   rigidly   applied.      As   the   majority   artfully\ndemonstrates, it is highly unlikely that any two institutions in a state's\nprison system will have an identical inmate composition but for the fact\nthat one houses women and the other houses men; specific differences become\nmore tenuous and less important when the challenge is system-wide.              While\nthe segregation of inmates by gender is constitutional, the natural\nconsequences of that segregation--e.g., smaller institutions, shorter\naggregate lengths of stay, broader ranges of security ratings within\ninstitutions--must not be used as a per se bar to our examination of the\nrespective treatment women and men receive while incarcerated.                If our\nequal protection inquiry ended every time a plaintiff fell short of showing\ndifferent treatment at a mirror-image facility, then despite our admonition\nto the contrary, Klinger would \"stand for the proposition that women and\nmen prison inmates can never be similarly situated for purposes of equal\nprotection analysis.\"      Prago v. Elliot, 49 F.3d 1355, 1356 (8th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n     It is important not to lose sight of basic commonalities that justify\nsimilar treatment.       All inmates, regardless of gender, are\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\funder the custody and control of the state as a result of their criminal\nbehavior; all are subject to the same general departmental regulations and\npolicies; and the incarceration in all cases shares common goals, including\nthe reform and rehabilitation of individual offenders.           These common\ncharacteristics provide a basis for the Department of Corrections to design\na program that gives substantially equal opportunities to women and men for\nrehabilitative   work    while   confined.   Although   gross    institutional\ndifferences might sometimes provide basis for finding groups of inmates\ndissimilarly situated, they do not in this case.        General, legitimate\nconcerns for security, the availability of inmates to fill positions, and\nthe like are more relevant in examining whether dissimilar treatment of\nmale and female inmates can be supported on non-discriminatory grounds.\n\n\n     Turning to that question, I further disagree with the majority's\nconclusion that the female inmates' claim must fail because they have not\nproved discrimination on the part of prison officials.          The women have\nbrought forth enough to establish gender-based discrimination.             The\ndepartment offers women only three opportunities to participate in industry\njobs, whereas male inmates have the opportunity to participate in twenty-\none, on-site enterprises as well as an off-site warehousing and trucking\noperation.    The jobs for men require more skills and give the men a\nconsiderable market advantage outside the prison setting.       Where the same\ntype of operation is set up at both a men's and women's institution, the\nmen's facility is significantly more sophisticated and industrial than the\nwomen's counterpart.    For example, while men at Moberly work in a printing\nindustry that is equipped to do layout work for forms, letterhead, and\nenvelopes, the Quick Print operation for women at Renz is \"closer to a copy\ncenter.\"   App. at\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f231-32.       With very few exceptions,1 the industrial opportunities offered\nto female inmates fall within prevailing stereotypes of \"women's work\":\ntelephone operators/telemarketers; data entry; and office copying.             The\nMissouri       Department   of   Corrections   cannot   adequately   explain   the\ndisparities between the industrial opportunities for women and men on\nneutral grounds and, more important, cannot explain its unwillingness to\nexpend the effort to provide women with the same opportunities it provides\nto men.       I disagree with the district court's statement, adopted by the\nmajority, that the dissimilar treatment is directly related to the size and\nlocation of the prisons and to the greater long-term availability of male\ninmates.       Most of the industries could operate independent of their\ngeographical location.           Moreover, as of 1991, only a handful of the\nindustries at the men's institutions had staff sizes that might be\ndifficult to generate at the women's institutions.        The state has not shown\nnon-discriminatory reasons for determining the industrial opportunities it\noffers to female inmates.         The women, in contrast, have produced enough\nevidence from which to infer the Department of Corrections' industry\nplacements are based on stereotypical notions of what jobs women can\nperform and the lesser need for women to become skilled laborers.\n\n\n        In my view, the women inmates have established their case under the\nEqual       Protection Clause that the Missouri Department of Corrections\ndiscriminates against them on the basis of their gender in the assignment\nand organization of prison industries throughout the state's prison system.\nI would remand this case to the district court with directions to instruct\nthe Department of\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      For example, as of 1991, two women at Renz were employed in\nwhat is called an agri-business enterprise where they perform minor\nmaintenance and repair jobs on small machines. This operation,\nhowever, is a scaled-down version of what was in place when Renz\nhoused male inmates and is quite different from and less skilled\nthan the traditional cattle and crop farming work currently offered\nto male inmates at another Missouri institution.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fCorrections to establish a remedial plan to correct the gender-based\ndisparities.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n           Attest:\n\n\n                CLERK, U.

The women inmates originally brought this 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\naction against Department officials alleging discriminatory treatment and\nseeking injunctive relief.        Only two issues have been raised in this\nappeal.    The female prisoners contend that the District Court erred in\nrejecting their claims that prison officials discriminated against them on\nthe basis of gender in violation of the Equal Protection Clause by failing\nto provide them with equal access (1) to post-secondary educational\nprograms and (2) to prison industry employment.            The District Court held\nthat the availability of post-secondary educational courses hinged on\nfiscal decisions made by the academic providers and on a lack of demand by\nfemale inmates rather than on any discriminatory action taken by the\nDepartment.    The Department has since filed a motion to dismiss as moot the\nfemale inmates' appeal regarding post-secondary educational opportunities.\nWe agreed to take this motion into consideration with the merits of the\ncase and hereby grant the Department's motion to dismiss this portion of\nthe case as moot.       To that extent, the order of the District Court is\nvacated.      As to the prison industries claim, the District Court found\ninsufficient evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of Department\nofficials to support an equal protection challenge.           Concluding that the\nDistrict Court's finding of no discriminatory intent is not clearly\nerroneous, and further concluding that the female inmates are not similarly\nsituated to male inmates for purposes of equal protection analysis, we\naffirm the District Court's order dismissing this claim.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Honorable Scott O.

The Department operates\nfifteen penal institutions, two of which, the Renz Correctional Center3\n(Renz) and the Chillicothe Correctional Center (Chillicothe), house solely\nadult female inmates.

Id. at 28.      Both\nmale and female inmates are assigned custody level classifications ranging\nfrom minimum security, C1, to maximum security, C5, and these designations\naffect inmate housing assignments within the gender-segregated facilities.\nGenerally, the higher custody classifications, C4 and C5, are assigned to\nmale and female inmates with longer sentences to serve and to shorter-term\ninmates of both genders who represent an increased security risk.             Female\ninmate custody levels range from C1 through C3 at Chillicothe and from C3\nthrough C5 at Renz.\n\n\n\n\n          2\n       Appellants do not challenge the constitutionality of this\ngender-based classification.

Both male and female prisoners can take advantage of college-\nlevel correspondence courses at their own expense.            Post-secondary courses\nconducted within the confines of the prison facilities are offered by\ncommunity colleges, state universities, and private colleges, and not by\nthe Department itself.    Educational institutions enter into agreements with\nthe Department for access to physical space within both male and female\nprisons and for administrative support, such as security and assistance in\nenrolling the inmates.    Decisions regarding the number and variety of post-\nsecondary programs offered at a particular prison facility are made by the\neducational   institutions    involved     and     not   by   the   Department.

Because a comparison of these factors between\nthe male inmates at NSP and the female inmates at NCW revealed a wide\ndisparity in each category, this Court concluded that \"the programs at NSP\nand NCW reflect separate sets of decisions based on entirely different\ncircumstances.\"   Klinger, 31 F.3d at 732.          Programming decisions regarding\nindustry and education differed from prison to prison, \"depending on\ninnumerable variables that officials must take into account\" and not on\nillegitimate, discriminatory factors.          Id.    Analysis of the sort that we\nemployed in Klinger leads us to the same result in the present case.\n\n\n     Initially,      the   irrefutable     differences      between   the   female-only\nfacilities, Renz and Chillicothe, and the various institutions housing male\ninmates in Missouri must be acknowledged.            Most\n\n\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fnotably, because women account for such a small proportion of the total\nprison population, their facilities are necessarily smaller in size than\nany of the male-only prisons.\n\n\n     Taking into account security classification levels in addition to\npopulation size further illustrates that female inmates are dissimilarly\nsituated from male inmates.     For example, Chillicothe has a population of\n430 female inmates assigned the lowest classification levels ranging from\nC1 through C3.     Corrected Joint Stipulations, Appellant's App. at 27, 28.\nThe most comparable male institution with respect to population size,\nPotosi Correctional Center with 500 inmates, bears no resemblance to\nChillicothe with respect to security levels, as it houses only male\nprisoners assigned the highest security classification, C5.               Id. at 27.\nThe male institutions most comparable to Chillicothe with respect to\nsecurity classification, Central Missouri Correctional Center and Western\nMissouri Correctional Center, which both confine inmates classified at\nlevels C2 and C3, house considerably larger inmate populations, namely,\n1000 men at Central Missouri and 1975 men at Western Missouri.                Id.\n\n\n     The average sentence length for female inmates as compared to male\ninmates confirms that these two diverse groups are not similarly situated.\nSignificantly fewer female inmates will be serving lengthy prison sentences\nin comparison to male inmates.       This observation is evidenced by the vast\ndisparity in the number of female inmates classified as medium or maximum\nsecurity   risks    as   compared   to   the   number   of   male   inmates   likewise\nclassified.   See Corrected Joint Stipulations, Appellant's App. at 27-28.\nA small number of women prisoners, approximately 305, are assigned the\nhighest security classifications, thereby indicating that they will be\nincarcerated for extended periods of time.        In contrast, roughly 6700 male\ninmates have been assigned the highest security classifications and will,\ntherefore, likely be serving lengthy prison sentences.              This distinction\nalso tends to establish that\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fmale inmates have been convicted of more serious crimes, thus justifying\nthe higher security classifications associated with lengthier prison\nsentences.\n\n\n        As is apparent from the above observations, male and female inmates\nincarcerated in Department prisons are far from similarly situated for\npurposes of equal protection analysis.      In determining the availability and\nlocation of prison programs and services, officials \"must balance many\nconsiderations, ranging from the characteristics of the inmates at that\nprison to the size of the institution, to determine the optimal mix of\nprograms and services.\"   Klinger, 31 F.3d at 732; see Turner v. Safley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111904\"><a href=\"/opinion/111904/turner-v-safley/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 84-85 (1987).     Because these considerations are diverse and the\ncircumstances of each prison are different, female inmates as a group and\nmale inmates as a group simply cannot be considered similarly situated for\npurposes of comparing the availability and variety of prison programming.\nThe size of the institution, its location, and the types of inmates housed\nthere necessarily will affect the number, type, and length of programs\noffered.\n\n\n        The women prisoners urge this Court to conduct a program-by-program\ncomparison between Department prisons housing solely female inmates and\nthose    housing only male inmates to confirm the existence of gender\ndiscrimination.     We reject that approach to equal protection analysis of\nthe Department's placement of prison industries.         There can be no such\nmeaningful comparison for equal protection purposes between two sets of\ninmates    who are not similarly situated.         See, e.g., Association of\nResidential Resources v. Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"692352\"><a href=\"/opinion/692352/association-of-residential-resources-in-minnesota-inc-christian-concerns/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 140-41 (8th Cir. 1995);\nKlinger, 31 F.3d at 733; Women Prisoners of the District of Columbia, 93\nF.3d at 927.   The substantial differences discussed above between male and\nfemale prisoners demonstrate the dissimilarity of the two distinct groups\nand the irrelevance of any attempt to compare the number or type of\nprograms offered.    Furthermore, this Court concluded in Klinger that \"using\nan inter-prison program comparison\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fto analyze equal protection claims improperly assumes that the Constitution\nrequires all prisons to have similar program priorities and to allocate\nresources similarly.\"      31 F.3d at 732.       We also noted that inter-prison\nprogram   comparison    \"results   in   precisely   the   type   of   federal   court\ninterference with and 'micro-management' of prisons that Turner condemned.\"\nKlinger, 31 F.3d at 733 (following Turner v.

It must be determined whether the unequal\ntreatment    in   accessibility    to   prison   industry   employment    allegedly\nresulting from gender discrimination stems from a Department policy that\nis facially neutral or from a policy that, on its face, classifies by\ngender.

If the adverse impact of a facially neutral policy\ncannot be plausibly explained on a neutral ground, the impact itself would\nsignal that the real classification made by the policy was in fact not\nneutral.6   Feeney, 442 U.S. at 275.\n\n\n     Here, the women prisoners do not challenge the Department policy of\nsegregating male and female prisoners by gender.   Rather they challenge the\nDepartment policy which determines the placement of a particular prison\nindustry at a specific penal facility.       It is this policy that the\nappellants contend results in a disparate impact on female prisoners and\nconstitutes a violation of the Equal Protection Clause.       The disparate\nimpact, according to the female inmates, is evidenced through the placement\nof stereotypically female jobs at the Renz and Chillicothe facilities and\nthe exclusion of female inmates from the more skilled and industrial jobs\nlocated at male prisons.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n     As we noted in Ricketts v.

See, e.g., Mo. Rev. Stat. ยง 217.550 (1994).\nLikewise, a review of Department officials' testimony indicates that\nDepartment policy for the placement of prison industries is based on\nfactors such as population size, availability of a steady work force, and\nlocation of the prison in relation to potential purchasers of industry\nproducts, not on the basis of gender considerations.                 Department officials\nhave       countered        the   appellants'        allegations    of    gender-motivated\ndiscrimination with a plausible explanation for the alleged disparate\nimpact.      As such, it is appellants' burden to establish that the adverse\neffect this Department policy has on women inmates is the result of a\ndiscriminatory purpose.\n\n\n       The       District    Court   found    that    the   scope   of   prison   enterprise\nopportunities provided to male and female inmates \"appears directly related\nto the size and location of the prisons and a recognition that more male\ninmates      are    available     for   long-term      manufacturing     jobs     than   women\n             7\ninmates.\"         Report and Recommendation at 10.\n\n\n       Because the policy challenged by the appellants is neutral on its\nface, the female prisoners must establish that the alleged disparate impact\nis the result of discriminatory purpose.               We agree with the District Court\nthat appellants have failed to prove the requisite discriminatory intent\non the part of Department officials.               Assuming as a threshold matter that\nthe women prisoners\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      The statutory mandate bestowing on the Department the power\nto establish prison industries instructs that the director shall\ntake into account:     \"offender custody levels, the number of\noffenders in each correctional center so the best service or\ndistribution of labor may be secured, location and convenience of\nthe correctional centers in relation to the other correctional\ncenters to be supplied or served and the machinery presently\ncontained in each correctional center.\"          Mo. Rev. Stat.\nยง 217.550(1) (1994).\n\n                                              -13-\n\fhave demonstrated disparate impact, their equal protection claim will fail\nnonetheless without a showing of discriminatory intent.                    See Feeney, 442\nU.S. at 274; Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 265.          \"'Discriminatory purpose'\n. . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of\nconsequences.    It   implies    that   the    decisionmaker     .    .    .    selected   or\nreaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part 'because of,' not\nmerely 'in spite of,' its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\"\nFeeney, 442 U.S. at 279 (citation and footnote omitted).\n\n\n     The District Court's findings show that prison industry jobs are\nlocated at both women's facilities and only at certain male facilities.\nReport and Recommendation at 10.        A proportionately larger number of female\ninmates have prison industry jobs than do male inmates, and the data-entry\nindustry located at the Renz facility, criticized by plaintiffs as a\nstereotypically female occupation, formerly employed male inmates when the\ninstitution housed males.       Department officials testified that the location\nof prison industries was motivated not by stereotypes but by legitimate\nconcerns such as work force stability and proximity to clientele.                      Thus,\nas the District Court found, the evidence does not support a claim that the\nDepartment's    placement   of     prison      industry   jobs       was       intentionally\ndiscriminatory or gender-motivated.           See also Klinger, 31 F.3d at 733-34;\nPargo, 894 F. Supp. at 1280; Women Prisoners of the Dist. of Columbia, 93\nF.3d at 925.\n\n\n     Because no two prisons are the same, it is a virtual certainty that\ninmates in one prison will have certain amenities not available to inmates\nin another.     \"Thus, female inmates can always point out certain ways in\nwhich male prisons are 'better' than theirs, just as male inmates can\nalways point out other ways in which female prisons are 'better' than\ntheirs.\"   Klinger, 31 F.3d at 732; see also Women Prisoners of the Dist.\nof Columbia, 93 F.3d at 926-27.         \"Differences between challenged programs\nat . . .   prisons are virtually irrelevant because so many variables affect\n\n\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fthe mix of programming that an institution has. . . . In short, comparing\nprograms . . . is like the proverbial comparison of apples to oranges.\"\nKlinger, 31 F.3d at 733.           When attempts are made to compare programs\noffered at facilities housing inmates who are not similarly situated, \"it\nis hardly surprising, let alone evidence of discrimination, that the\nsmaller correctional facility offered fewer programs than the larger one.\"\nWomen Prisoners of the Dist. of Columbia, 93 F.3d at 925.\n\n\n                                               V.\n\n\n     For   the   reasons   stated,        we    affirm     the   District   Court's    order\ndismissing the appellants' equal protection claim with respect to prison\nindustry programs and grant the Department's motion to dismiss as moot\nappellants' equal protection claim regarding post-secondary educational\nopportunities.    The order of the District Court is vacated insofar as it\ndeals with the latter claim.\n\n\nHEANEY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\n\n     I   agree   that   the   female      inmates'       claim    that   prison   officials\npurposefully discriminated against them in the management of post-secondary\neducational programs is rendered moot by the correction department's\nunfortunate   suspension      of    all        contracts    with    local   colleges     and\nuniversities to offer post-secondary and vocational courses to either male\nor female inmates.      I disagree, however, with the majority's conclusion\nthat the class of female inmates is not similarly situated to male inmates\nfor the purpose of challenging the assignment and organization of prison\nindustry programs under the Equal Protection Clause.                I also disagree that\nthe female inmates have failed to show discriminatory intent on the part\nof the Department of Corrections.          Therefore, I respectfully dissent from\nParts III and IV of the majority's opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -15-\n\f      I do not quarrel with the majority's citation to the basic rule that\na party seeking relief for gender-based discrimination under the Equal\nProtection Clause must demonstrate that a state actor has treated her\ndifferently than other similarly situated persons because of her gender.\nNor do I dispute the corollary rule that a state may treat dissimilarly\nsituated persons in a dissimilar manner.            In my view, however, the court\nis wrong to adopt an overly formalistic approach to the threshold question\nof whether female and male inmates are similarly situated.\n\n\n     While the court in Klinger v. Department of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"675798\"><a href=\"/opinion/675798/cheryl-klinger-linda-lange-gweniver-lay-stacy-finn-v-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">727</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n731 (8th Cir. 1994), compared inmate populations, length of sentences, and\nsecurity classifications in holding that female inmates at one Iowa prison\nwere dissimilarly situated from male inmates at another institution, such\nfactors   should   not    be   rigidly   applied.      As   the   majority   artfully\ndemonstrates, it is highly unlikely that any two institutions in a state's\nprison system will have an identical inmate composition but for the fact\nthat one houses women and the other houses men; specific differences become\nmore tenuous and less important when the challenge is system-wide.              While\nthe segregation of inmates by gender is constitutional, the natural\nconsequences of that segregation--e.g., smaller institutions, shorter\naggregate lengths of stay, broader ranges of security ratings within\ninstitutions--must not be used as a per se bar to our examination of the\nrespective treatment women and men receive while incarcerated.                If our\nequal protection inquiry ended every time a plaintiff fell short of showing\ndifferent treatment at a mirror-image facility, then despite our admonition\nto the contrary, Klinger would \"stand for the proposition that women and\nmen prison inmates can never be similarly situated for purposes of equal\nprotection analysis.\"      Prago v. Elliot, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"691377\"><a href=\"/opinion/691377/cathy-pargo-dale-bahmer-kim-frazier-sheryl-snodgrass-christine/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1355</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1356 (8th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n     It is important not to lose sight of basic commonalities that justify\nsimilar treatment.       All inmates, regardless of gender, are\n\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\funder the custody and control of the state as a result of their criminal\nbehavior; all are subject to the same general departmental regulations and\npolicies; and the incarceration in all cases shares common goals, including\nthe reform and rehabilitation of individual offenders.           These common\ncharacteristics provide a basis for the Department of Corrections to design\na program that gives substantially equal opportunities to women and men for\nrehabilitative   work    while   confined.   Although   gross    institutional\ndifferences might sometimes provide basis for finding groups of inmates\ndissimilarly situated, they do not in this case.        General, legitimate\nconcerns for security, the availability of inmates to fill positions, and\nthe like are more relevant in examining whether dissimilar treatment of\nmale and female inmates can be supported on non-discriminatory grounds.\n\n\n     Turning to that question, I further disagree with the majority's\nconclusion that the female inmates' claim must fail because they have not\nproved discrimination on the part of prison officials.          The women have\nbrought forth enough to establish gender-based discrimination.             The\ndepartment offers women only three opportunities to participate in industry\njobs, whereas male inmates have the opportunity to participate in twenty-\none, on-site enterprises as well as an off-site warehousing and trucking\noperation.    The jobs for men require more skills and give the men a\nconsiderable market advantage outside the prison setting.       Where the same\ntype of operation is set up at both a men's and women's institution, the\nmen's facility is significantly more sophisticated and industrial than the\nwomen's counterpart.    For example, while men at Moberly work in a printing\nindustry that is equipped to do layout work for forms, letterhead, and\nenvelopes, the Quick Print operation for women at Renz is \"closer to a copy\ncenter.\"   App. at\n\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f231-32.       With very few exceptions,1 the industrial opportunities offered\nto female inmates fall within prevailing stereotypes of \"women's work\":\ntelephone operators/telemarketers; data entry; and office copying.             The\nMissouri       Department   of   Corrections   cannot   adequately   explain   the\ndisparities between the industrial opportunities for women and men on\nneutral grounds and, more important, cannot explain its unwillingness to\nexpend the effort to provide women with the same opportunities it provides\nto men.       I disagree with the district court's statement, adopted by the\nmajority, that the dissimilar treatment is directly related to the size and\nlocation of the prisons and to the greater long-term availability of male\ninmates.       Most of the industries could operate independent of their\ngeographical location.           Moreover, as of 1991, only a handful of the\nindustries at the men's institutions had staff sizes that might be\ndifficult to generate at the women's institutions.        The state has not shown\nnon-discriminatory reasons for determining the industrial opportunities it\noffers to female inmates.         The women, in contrast, have produced enough\nevidence from which to infer the Department of Corrections' industry\nplacements are based on stereotypical notions of what jobs women can\nperform and the lesser need for women to become skilled laborers.\n\n\n        In my view, the women inmates have established their case under the\nEqual       Protection Clause that the Missouri Department of Corrections\ndiscriminates against them on the basis of their gender in the assignment\nand organization of prison industries throughout the state's prison system.\nI would remand this case to the district court with directions to instruct\nthe Department of\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      For example, as of 1991, two women at Renz were employed in\nwhat is called an agri-business enterprise where they perform minor\nmaintenance and repair jobs on small machines. This operation,\nhowever, is a scaled-down version of what was in place when Renz\nhoused male inmates and is quite different from and less skilled\nthan the traditional cattle and crop farming work currently offered\nto male inmates at another Missouri institution.\n\n                                        -18-\n\fCorrections to establish a remedial plan to correct the gender-based\ndisparities.\n\n\n     A true copy.\n\n\n           Attest:\n\n\n                CLERK, U.
