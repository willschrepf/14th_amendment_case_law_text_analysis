The District Court here made various findings of segregative acts on the part of petitioner School Board members, appointed a Special Master 'to develop a plan for the desegregation of the Milwaukee public school system,' and certified its order for interlocutory appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Amos v. Board of School Directors, 408 F. Supp. 765. The Court of Appeals, observing that there was 'an unexplained hiatus between specific findings of fact and conclusory findings of segregative intent,' stated that the District Court is 'entitled to a presumption of consistency' and concluded that the findings of the District Court were not clearly erroneous. 539 F.2d 625. Neither the District Court in ordering development of a remedial plan, nor the Court of Appeals in affirming, addressed itself to the inquiry mandated by our opinion in Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851, in which we said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">'If such violations are found, the District Court in the      first instance, subject to review by the Court of Appeals,      must determine how much incremental segregative effect these      violations had on the racial distribution of the Dayton school population as presently constituted,      when that distribution is compared to what it would have been      in the absence of such constitutional violations. The remedy      must be designed to redress that difference, and only if      there has been a systemwide impact may there be a systemwide      remedy.' 433 U.S., at 420, 97 S.Ct., at 2766.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for certiorari is accordingly granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for reconsideration in the light of Village of Arlington Heights v.

Amos v. Board of School Directors, 408 F.Supp. 765, 818 (E.D.Wis.1976). Recognizing that 'remedial efforts may well be for naught if the determination of liability is ultimately reversed on appeal,' id., at 824. Judge Reynolds certified this issue of law for interlocutory appeal. To further ensure appealability, he entered a general order enjoining future racial discrimination and directing the defendants to formulate desegregation plans. App. 140-141. This order did not call for any particular kind of desegregation plan. Thus, when the case reached the Court of Appeals, the only issue before it was the existence of a violation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> After a careful review of the evidence, it concluded that the District Court's finding of intentional segregation was not clearly erroneous. 539 F.2d 625 (CA7 1976).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court now vacates the Court of Appeals judgment and remands for reconsideration in light of two cases.

Brinkman, 433 U.S. 406, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851, if there is any dispute about the proper scope of the remedy. But since no such issue has ever been decided by the Court of Appeals, there is nothing for it to reconsider in light of these cases. These cases certainly provide no justification for vacating the judgment affirming the District Court's conclusion that the petitioners have violated the Constitution. This Court's hasty action will unfortunately lead to unnecessary work by already overburdened Circuit Judges, who have given this case far more study than this Court had time to give it.
