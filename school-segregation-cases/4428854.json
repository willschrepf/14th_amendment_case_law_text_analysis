See Tex. Code Crim.\n\nProc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(h) (West Supp. 2014). A Dallas County jury found\n\nappellant guilty of capital murder for drowning his two sons in the same criminal\n\ntransaction. (CR1: 2; CR2: 395-400, 401, 410-13; RR44: 39). In accordance with the\n\njury’s answers to the special issues, the trial court sentenced him to death on May\n\n23, 2013. (CR2: 402-07, 408-09, 410-13; RR50: 100-04). Appellant presents fifty-\n\nfour allegations of reversible error.\n\n                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n                            A. Evidence at Guilt-Innocence\n\n      Kametra Sampson dated appellant for six years and they had three children\n\ntogether: Naim Muhammad, Elijah Muhammad, and Jeremiah Muhammad.\n\n(RR43: 76-77). Kametra ended her relationship with appellant in December of\n\n2010. (RR43: 77).\n\n\n\n                                        1\n\f      In August of 2011, Kametra and her sons were living with Kametra’s\n\nmother, Priscilla Sampson, on Terrell Street in Dallas. (RR43: 31-32, 59, 79-80).\n\nAlthough Kametra and appellant were broken up, appellant showed up at\n\nPriscilla’s annual back-to-school barbecue on August 20, 2011. (RR43: 33-37, 60,\n\n81). Kametra arrived late to the barbecue with the boys and her boyfriend, Eric\n\nSmith. (RR43: 34, 36-37, 87). Appellant confronted Kametra, telling her he did not\n\nwant another man raising his sons. (RR43: 38-39, 90-91). Kametra sent the boys\n\ninside the house and her argument with appellant escalated. (RR43: 39-40, 91).\n\nKametra’s grandfather intervened and asked appellant to leave. (RR43: 40, 61,\n\n91). Appellant returned later that evening with his mother to pick up the boys,\n\nbut Kametra and the boys were not home. (RR43: 41, 92).\n\n      Appellant returned to Priscilla’s house around 6:00 a.m. on the morning of\n\nAugust 22, 2011. (RR43: 42, 93). It was the first day of kindergarten for the eldest\n\nson, Naim. (RR43: 42, 62). Appellant asked to see his sons, but Priscilla would not\n\nlet him in. (RR43: 43, 93). Kametra came to the door and told appellant he was\n\nnot wanted there and needed to leave. (RR43: 22, 93-94). Priscilla’s neighbor,\n\nPhyllis Lewis, was outside when appellant arrived and overheard them exchange\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fwords at the front door. (RR43: 22). About thirty minutes later, Phyllis saw\n\nappellant drive by the house on Terrell Street. (RR43: 15-16, 20-21).\n\n      Priscilla left the house with her youngest daughter, Jamie, to catch the bus\n\nand Kametra walked down Terrell Street toward Frazier Elementary with Naim\n\nand Elijah. (RR43: 44-45, 79, 95, 125). Kametra’s youngest son, Jeremiah, stayed\n\nhome with her brother, Brandon Turner. (RR43: 45, 64). As Kametra, Naim, and\n\nElijah reached the end of Terrell Street and crossed over Dolphin Street, appellant\n\nswerved in front of them and jumped out of the vehicle he was driving. (RR43: 96-\n\n97, 123-24). He demanded that they get in the car with him or he would hit\n\nKametra with a large rock he picked up off the ground. (RR43: 97-98, 124-25).\n\nKametra and the boys complied. (RR43: 98). Appellant continued driving in the\n\ndirection of the school, but when they reached the front of the school, appellant\n\nturned the opposite direction and told them that Naim wasn’t going to school\n\ntoday. (RR43: 100).\n\n      Kametra began crying and pleading with appellant to take Naim to school.\n\n(RR43: 100-01). Appellant drove erratically and alternated between telling\n\nKametra they needed to get back together and yelling, hitting her, and\n\nthreatening to kill her and the boys. (RR43: 102-03, 106, 112). After driving\n\n                                         3\n\faround for over an hour, they pulled up behind a constable near the intersection\n\nof Camp Wisdom and R. L. Thornton Freeway. (RR43: 104, 126). Kametra jumped\n\nout of the vehicle in the hopes of getting some help from the constable. (RR43:\n\n105-08). Appellant grabbed her, but she was able to pull away and escape. (RR43:\n\n109, 129). Kametra banged on the passenger window of the constable’s vehicle\n\nand begged for help. (RR43: 110). As the constable directed her to the Shell gas\n\nstation at the intersection, appellant swerved around the car in front of him,\n\njumped the curb, and sped through the red light. (RR43: 110-11, 127).\n\n      The constable pulled into the Shell gas station and called the police for\n\nKametra. (RR43: 112-13). Appellant’s sisters, Aqueelah Green and Sekinah\n\nMuhammad, were called and also came to the Shell gas station. (RR43: 114, 144,\n\n146). Kametra went with Aqueelah to her brother’s house nearby on Songwood\n\nStreet in the hopes of finding appellant, but he was not there and Aqueelah drove\n\nKametra back to the Shell station. (RR43: 115, 117, 147-48).\n\n      Shortly after dropping off Kametra, Aqueelah received a phone from\n\nappellant. (RR43: 150). When she asked where Naim and Elijah were, appellant\n\ntold her they were “gone with Abdullah.” (RR43: 150-51, 154). Abdullah was\n\nAqueelah’s and appellant’s eldest brother who was deceased. (RR43: 150-51, 159-\n\n                                        4\n\f60). When Aqueelah asked what appellant meant by that, he said, “They gone.\n\nThey are dead.” (RR43: 151, 153). Appellant hung up, but he called Aqueelah back\n\na short time later. (RR43: 152). Aqueelah was driving during the second phone call\n\nand arrived at her brother’s house on Songwood while she was still on the phone\n\nwith appellant. (RR43: 152-54). One of the police officers at the house asked her\n\nto switch on her speakerphone and gave her specific questions to ask appellant.\n\n(RR43: 154-55). At the officer’s direction, she asked appellant if he killed the kids\n\nand he replied, “Yes.” (RR43: 155). When she asked how he killed his kids, he said\n\nhe drowned them. (RR43: 155). He told her he killed Naim first and then Elijah.\n\n(RR43: 155). When she asked appellant where the kids were, he said he “didn’t\n\nknow” and that they were “in the creek somewhere.” (RR43: 155).\n\n      This information was still unknown to Kametra and her family. Priscilla\n\nreturned home around 10:00 a.m. and Kametra arrived shortly after her. (RR43:\n\n45-46, 68, 117). Kametra had a bloody nose, blood on her clothes, red and\n\nswollen eyes, and was very upset. (RR43: 46, 68, 117). She told Priscilla and\n\nBrandon about what had happened with appellant on the way to school. (RR43:\n\n46, 117). Brandon told them that appellant had tried to break into the house\n\nshortly before they got home. (RR43: 45-46, 68, 117). Brandon explained that he\n\n                                         5\n\fheard someone kick a window in the back of the house and break the glass.\n\n(RR43: 52-56, 65). He went to investigate and saw appellant trying to enter the\n\nhouse through the window. (RR43: 65). The window led into the room where\n\nJeremiah was sleeping. (RR43: 65). Brandon asked appellant what he was doing;\n\nwhen appellant did not respond and just kept trying to come in, Brandon pushed\n\nhim back out of the window. (RR43: 65-66, 73). After appellant picked himself up\n\nand was running away toward the back fence, he told Brandon: “Your nephews\n\nare dead now.” (RR43: 66-67, 70-71). Brandon did not think anything of it\n\nbecause he thought the boys were with Kametra on the way to school. (RR43: 67).\n\nWhen Brandon relayed this information to Kametra, she became hysterical.\n\n(RR43: 68-69, 117). They called 911 and Kametra left with the police officers who\n\nresponded to the call. (RR43: 47, 69, 117-18). Later that day, Priscilla was taken by\n\nofficers to Dallas Police headquarters. (RR43: 48). There, both she and Kametra\n\nlearned that Naim and Elijah were dead. (RR43: 48, 119).\n\n      Christal Fewell hung out with appellant at his brother’s house on Songwood\n\nStreet the night before the offense. (RR42: 143-46). Christal met appellant\n\nthrough her cousin and they had been dating for two to three months. (RR42:\n\n141-42). Appellant asked to borrow Christal’s car the next morning so he could\n\n                                         6\n\ftake his son to school. (RR42: 145). About an hour after appellant left, Christal got\n\nout of bed, showered, and then began to worry about the whereabouts of\n\nappellant and her car. (RR42: 150-51). A short time later she started receiving\n\nphone calls from appellant’s family members asking: “Where is Rasool?” (RR42:\n\n151-52). She also received a phone call from the Dallas Police Department and\n\nprovided them with a description of her car. (RR42: 154-55). When Christal was\n\nleaving the house on Songwood, she saw her car drive down the street in front of\n\nthe house. (RR42: 154-55). She immediately called the Dallas Police back and\n\nreported the sighting of her car. (RR42: 154-56). Appellant’s mother, Naimah\n\nMuhammad, pulled up to the house at this time and was looking for appellant.\n\n(RR42: 154-56). Shortly thereafter, several Dallas Police Officers also arrived at\n\nthe house. (RR42: 154-56). Christal received a phone call from appellant on her\n\ncell phone; however, he would not tell her his whereabouts and only wanted to\n\ntalk to his mother. (RR42: 157-58).\n\n      The police officers eventually left the house on Songwood to search for\n\nappellant, and Christal left with Naimah because she claimed to know the location\n\nof Christal’s car. (RR42: 158-59; RR43: 175). They drove down the street and\n\nappellant jumped into the backseat of Naimah’s car. (RR42: 160; RR43: 175).\n\n                                         7\n\fNaimah drove a short ways further and dropped Christal off at the location where\n\nappellant had left her car. (RR42: 161; RR43: 175-76). Naimah told Christal to hug\n\nand kiss her child when she got home and tell him she loved him. (RR42: 161,\n\n173). As Christal was driving home, she was pulled over by several police officers\n\nand taken to Dallas Police Headquarters for questioning, where she learned about\n\nthe events of the morning and what appellant had done. (RR42: 161-62). A search\n\nof Christal’s car revealed mud on the interior. (State’s Exhibits 25-36).\n\n      After Naimah dropped off Christal at her car, appellant told her where to\n\ndrive to find Naim and Elijah. (RR43: 176-77). From the service road of IH-35, they\n\nturned on Brookside Drive and drove to a heavily wooded area at the end of the\n\nroad with a steep incline down to a shallow creek. (RR43: 176-77, 186, 191-92,\n\n199-200). Naimah waited at the top next to a sewer manhole cover while\n\nappellant went down to the creek and retrieved the boys one at a time. (RR43:\n\n177-78, 194). Appellant brought Naim up from the creek first. (RR43: 178, 194).\n\nHe laid him on the ground and Naimah attempted to perform CPR. (RR43: 178-79,\n\n194). Appellant went back down and retrieved Elijah from the creek. (RR43: 179,\n\n194). After Naimah’s attempts at CPR were unsuccessful, appellant put both boys\n\nin the backseat of her vehicle. (RR43: 179-80). They left the creek and drove back\n\n                                          8\n\ftoward the house on Songwood, but before they arrived appellant jumped out of\n\nthe vehicle. (RR43: 180-81). Naimah pulled into a parking lot on Ledbetter Road.\n\n(RR43: 182). She saw an officer driving by, so she flagged him down and told him\n\nthat her grandbabies were in the back of her car. (RR43: 182-83). When the police\n\nsearched and photographed Naimah’s car, the backseat was muddy and wet.\n\n(RR43: 190).\n\n      Appellant was eventually captured by police later that day. Michael Yeric, a\n\nhomicide detective with the Dallas Police Department, interviewed appellant at\n\nthe police headquarters when he was brought into custody. (RR43: 209-14;\n\nState’s Exhibits 152-53, 167). Detective Yeric read appellant his rights, and\n\nappellant indicated that he wanted to waive those rights and speak with the\n\ndetective. (RR43: 217, 233-34, 237-38). Appellant told Detective Yeric that he had\n\nborrowed his friend Christal’s car that morning because he wanted to take his son\n\nto his first day of school. (RR43: 239). He went to Priscilla’s home around 6:30\n\na.m., but was not allowed to see his kids. (RR43: 239). Appellant found Kametra\n\nand the boys as they were walking to school, forced them into the car with him,\n\nand began driving around. (RR43: 239-40). As they approached Camp Wisdom on\n\nthe service road of R. L. Thornton freeway, appellant and Kametra saw a\n\n                                        9\n\fconstable’s car. (RR43: 241). Appellant told Kametra, “Don’t get out of this car,”\n\nand “if you jump out of this car, you don’t care about your kids.” (RR43: 241).\n\nKametra jumped out of the car and went to the passenger side of the constable’s\n\ncar, and appellant drove off. (RR43: 241). Appellant admitted to then driving to\n\nthe creek and drowning Naim and Elijah. (RR43: 220, 241).\n\n        When Detective Yeric visited the scene of the drowning, he noticed a\n\nsecurity camera mounted outside of Spirit Depot, a liquor store on the corner of\n\nBrookside Drive and the service road. (RR43: 221-22, 225). Detective Yeric\n\nobtained the video footage recorded by this camera on August 22, 2011. (RR43:\n\n221-22; State’s Exhibits 155-68). The video footage showed that appellant first\n\ndrove down Brookside Drive in Christal’s car at 8:53 a.m. and exited a short time\n\nlater. (RR43: 222-23, 230). It then showed Naimah’s car drive down Brookside\n\nDrive at 12:15 p.m. and exit a short time later. (RR43: 223, 230). This video\n\nfootage corroborated the information relayed to the detective by appellant,\n\nNaimah, and other witnesses they interviewed during their investigation. (RR43:\n\n233).\n\n        Dr. Tracy Dyer, a board-certified forensic pathologist and staff medical\n\nexaminer at the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences (“SWIFS”), supervised\n\n                                       10\n\fthe autopsies of 3-year-old Elijah Muhammad and 5-year-old Naim Muhammad.\n\n(RR42: 115-39). Both Elijah and Naim arrived at SWIFS in wet clothing with dirt\n\nand debris scattered across their bodies. (RR42: 120-22, 134). Both boys had\n\nscratches on their heads and hands; additionally, Elijah had scratches on his back,\n\nlegs, and feet. (RR42: 120-26, 136-37; State’s Exhibits 4-8, 10-21, 24). The internal\n\nexamination revealed that Elijah had bruising on his scalp, dirt and debris in his\n\nairway, and an abundant amount of fluid in his lungs. (RR42: 126-30; State’s\n\nExhibits 22-24). Naim also had bruising on his scalp and fluid in his lungs. (RR42:\n\n137-38; State’s Exhibits 9-10). Dr. Dyer determined that the cause of death for\n\nboth Elijah and Naim was drowning and that their manner of death was homicide.\n\n(RR42: 130-31, 138-39; State’s Exhibits 10, 24).\n\n      After hearing this evidence, the jury returned a verdict of guilt in\n\napproximately eight minutes. (RR44: 34, 41).\n\n                       B. The State’s Punishment Evidence\n\n      During punishment, the State presented evidence showing that appellant’s\n\nexperience with the criminal justice system began at a young age and spanned a\n\nperiod of about twenty years. This evidence was presented through business\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\frecords of prior criminal convictions, as well as live testimony regarding various\n\nextraneous adjudicated and unadjudicated offenses.1\n\n       On January 30, 1993, appellant was arrested for burglary of a coin-operated\n\nmachine. (RR44: 111-12). Appellant and a cohort were removing quarters from a\n\nvacuum cleaner at a car wash. (RR44: 112-13). When Dallas Police Officer John\n\nJames and his partner arrived at the location, appellant and his cohort fled. (RR44:\n\n114). Appellant, who was thirteen years old at the time, was apprehended a few\n\nblocks away and taken to the juvenile jail. (RR44: 114-15).\n\n       On February 26, 1993, Ivis Wright, a single mother of three, returned home\n\nto find her back door had been kicked in and several items had been stolen from\n\nher home, including a VCR, Nintendo gaming system, a cordless phone, money,\n\nand candy. (RR44: 119-21). Five juvenile boys were apprehended fleeing Wright’s\n\nhome and placed under arrest for burglary. (RR44: 121, 124-27). Officer Chris\n\nHavens identified Naim Rasool Muhammad as one of the perpetrators. (RR44:\n\n127). On October 4, 1993, Dallas Police Officer David Solomon responded to a call\n\n\n\n1\n The judge gave both an oral and written instruction to the jury that they were not to consider\nextraneous offenses for any purpose unless they found and believed beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that appellant committed the offenses, if any were committed, and even then they could\nonly consider them in determining their answers to the special issues. (RR45: 41-42; CR2: 406).\n\n                                              12\n\freporting an auto theft in progress. (RR45: 82-84, 126-27). Officer Solomon pulled\n\nover a vehicle matching the description of one of the stolen vehicles and\n\nappellant was one of the passengers. (RR45: 86, 88, 127-28). Officer Solomon\n\ndetermined that the passengers were not involved in the reported auto theft;\n\nhowever, Officer Solomon arrested appellant because he had outstanding\n\nwarrants for two charges of burglary of a habitation, one of which was for the\n\nburglary Wright’s home. (RR45: 89, 97-99, 100-01, 103, 128-30).\n\n      On June 16, 1993, appellant was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle.\n\n(RR45: 48-49, 51). Former Dallas Police Officer Sekethia Tejada pulled up behind a\n\nCadillac, ran the plates, and realized it was a stolen vehicle. (RR45: 48-49). When\n\nshe pulled the vehicle over, there were two young men inside; appellant, who\n\nwas fourteen years old at the time, was the passenger. (RR45: 50-51). The\n\nsteering column was broken and they had managed to start the engine without a\n\nkey. (RR45: 51).\n\n      On April 5, 1994, appellant committed burglary of a habitation. (RR44: 109;\n\nState’s Exhibit 170). On May 25, 1994, a juvenile Order of Adjudication and\n\nJudgment of Disposition with No Placement was entered and appellant was\n\nsentenced to 12 months’ probation. (RR44: 109; State’s Exhibit 170).\n\n                                        13\n\f      On July 27, 1994, Dallas Police received a call reporting a burglary of a\n\nvehicle that was in progress. (RR44: 140-41). Lieutenant Harold Andrews was\n\ndriving around the area where the burglary occurred and spotted appellant, who\n\nmatched the description of one of the suspects. (RR44: 142). Lt. Andrews\n\ndetained appellant and brought him back to the scene of the burglary, where he\n\nwas identified by the complainant as one of the perpetrators. (RR44: 142-43).\n\n      On August 18, 1994, appellant committed unauthorized use of a motor\n\nvehicle and evading arrest. (RR44: 108-09; State’s Exhibit 171). A juvenile Order of\n\nAdjudication and Judgment of Disposition with Placement was entered on\n\nSeptember 9, 1994, sentencing appellant to 12 months’ probation to be served in\n\nthe custody of Daytop Village. (RR44: 108-09; State’s Exhibit 171).\n\n      Daytop Village provides a 9-month program for 13 to 18 year olds and is\n\ndesigned to rehabilitate juveniles so that they do not end up in “the system.”\n\n(RR46: 9-11, 13). If a juvenile completes the program at Daytop, they are returned\n\nto their family; if not, they are sent to the Texas Youth Commission (“TYC”), a\n\ncorrectional facility for youth offenders. (RR46: 11, 13, 38). Youths attending\n\nDaytop are given multiple opportunities to succeed in the program. (RR46: 12-13,\n\n34). Daytop operates using the merit system and infractions are judged by peers,\n\n                                        14\n\fnot adults. (RR46: 10-11, 13). Daytop residents attend school, enjoy recreation\n\ntime, participate in group meetings, and also receive one-on-one counseling.\n\n(RR46: 17-18). During his stay at Daytop, appellant had many difficulties and was\n\nplaced on a behavior contract in an effort to change his aggressive behavior\n\ntoward other residents. (RR46: 16; State’s Exhibit 177). Despite this contract, on\n\nJuly 1, 1995, appellant physically assaulted another resident on two separate\n\noccasions. (RR46: 16-17, 26; State’s Exhibit 177). Due to the two new assaults, as\n\nwell as the prior infractions resulting in the behavior contract, the leaders of the\n\nprogram voted to discharge applicant from Daytop and send him to TYC. (RR46:\n\n16-19, 32-33; State’s Exhibit 177).\n\n      While in TYC, appellant committed multiple infractions. On September 16,\n\n1995, appellant was written up for disruptive behavior and threatening staff.\n\n(RR46: 83). After being repeatedly instructed to be quiet, appellant stated that he\n\nwould like to “beat somebody down.” (RR46: 83). He then looked at former TYC\n\ncorrectional officer Linda Parker and said “especially females.” (RR46: 81-83). On\n\nDecember 12, 1995, appellant was written up for disruption of the program and\n\npossession of razor blades and crushed aspirin. (RR46: 56, 59; State’s Exhibit 178).\n\nAccording to former TYC correctional officer Michael Jaco, the inmates snorted\n\n                                        15\n\fcrushed aspirin to get high and often used razor blades to create weapons. (RR46:\n\n52-53, 56-57). Appellant was trading the contraband for snacks. (RR46: 56, 63;\n\nState’s Exhibit 178). On January 11, 1996, appellant was written up multiple times\n\nfor aggressive behavior toward other inmates, disruptive behavior in the\n\nclassroom, disobeying staff, and calling a pregnant female correctional officer a\n\n“fat mother-fucker.” (RR46: 70-72). On August 17, 1996, appellant was written up\n\nfor a disruption on the volleyball court. (RR46: 77). When he was asked to leave,\n\nappellant became explosive and cursed at staff members. (RR46: 77). He called\n\nformer TYC correctional officer Kenneth Allen a “fat mother-fucker” and told him\n\n“fuck your mother.” (RR46: 74-75, 77-78). On August 27, 1996, appellant was\n\nwritten up for rubbing his erect penis against the leg of his teacher, Nina Adams.\n\n(RR47: 18-24). On September 15, 1996, appellant was written up for fighting.\n\n(RR46: 40-42). He and his cohort assaulted another inmate while he was being\n\nheld down on a toilet. (RR46: 40-42). On September 20, 1996, he was written up\n\nfor being disruptive in the dining hall. (RR46: 78-79).\n\n      According to former correctional officer Gail Hamilton, appellant was not a\n\nlaw abiding person while at TYC. (RR46: 36-37, 46). Many of the correctional\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fofficers at TYC tried to talk to appellant and encourage him to stop the\n\nprogression of his criminal behavior to no avail. (RR46: 44-45, 54-55).\n\n        Appellant was released from TYC in December of 1996 and resumed his\n\ncriminal activity shortly thereafter. On July 30, 1997, appellant committed\n\nburglary of a vehicle and evading arrest. (RR44: 109; State’s Exhibits 172, 173). On\n\nSeptember 19, 1997, he pleaded guilty to each offense and was sentenced to 12\n\nmonths’ probation in each case, but he was subsequently revoked for failing to\n\ncomply with the conditions of his probation. (State’s Exhibit 172, 173).\n\n        On December 4, 1997, appellant committed theft at a Lowe’s store in Collin\n\nCounty. (RR44: 108; State’s Exhibit 174). On September 28, 1998, he pleaded\n\nguilty to the charge and was sentenced to probation for one year, but he was\n\nsubsequently revoked and sentenced to 180 days’ confinement. (State’s Exhibit\n\n174).\n\n        On January 27, 1998, appellant committed burglary of a vehicle. (RR44:\n\n109-10; State’s Exhibit 175). On February 11, 1998, he pleaded guilty to the\n\ncharge and was sentenced to 180 days’ confinement. (RR44: 109-10; State’s\n\nExhibit 175).\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f      On July 4, 1999, Garland Police Officer Brandon Hernandez and several\n\nother officers responded to a burglary alarm at a car lot off Forest Lane in Dallas.\n\n(RR45: 60-63). Officer Hernandez and his partner spotted appellant walking away\n\nfrom the business toward a suspicious vehicle that was running but did not have\n\nits lights on. (RR45: 63-64). When another officer approached the vehicle on foot,\n\nthe vehicle sped away. (RR45: 64-65). Officer Hernandez and his partner chased\n\nthe vehicle and made a felony traffic stop. (RR45: 65). Appellant and two other\n\npassengers were removed from the vehicle and the officers found a loaded\n\nshotgun inside. (RR45: 65-66). They also found a bag of marijuana and a\n\nscrewdriver, a common burglary tool, just outside the vehicle that appeared to\n\nhave been thrown out by the passengers. (RR45: 66-67). When the officers\n\nchecked appellant’s name and date of birth in their system, they discovered he\n\nhad outstanding felony and probation warrants. (RR45: 69, 70-71). All three\n\npassengers of the vehicle were arrested. (RR45: 70-71).\n\n      On April 7, 2001, Jeanette Harris, appellant’s next door neighbor at the\n\ntime, caught appellant peeping at her through the bathroom window when she\n\nwas in the shower. (RR45: 43-45). When Harris confronted appellant about the\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fincident, he threatened to “whip *her+ ass.” (RR45: 45-46). Harris called the police\n\nand appellant fled. (RR46: 45).\n\n      On April 20, 2009, Dallas Police Officer Ryan Foster and his partner\n\nresponded to a disturbance call in South Dallas. (RR45: 132-33, 140). Sekinah\n\nMuhammad, appellant’s sister, was upset and was bleeding from the back of her\n\nhead. (RR45: 133-35). Appellant and Sekinah had gotten into an argument. (RR47:\n\n28-29). When appellant refused to leave, Sekinah came toward appellant with a\n\nhammer. (RR47: 28-29, 32-33). Appellant took the hammer from her and hit her\n\nin the head with it two times. (RR45: 138-39; RR47: 28-29, 32-35). Appellant was\n\napprehended a few blocks away from the offense and arrested for assault. (RR45:\n\n138-40).\n\n      Appellant pleaded guilty to the aggravated assault of his sister and was\n\nplaced on probation on September 15, 2009. (RR46: 141-43, 147; RR47: 37; RR49:\n\n99-100; State’s Exhibit 185). Appellant violated the conditions of his probation on\n\nmany occasions. He was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device on\n\nSeptember 25, 2009, but was arrested four days later for failing to comply with\n\nthe electronic monitoring requirements. (RR46: 143-44). Over the next nine\n\nmonths, appellant failed to comply with several other conditions of his probation\n\n                                        19\n\fby testing positive during multiple urinalysis tests, failing to regularly report to his\n\nprobation officer, failing to complete any community service hours, failing to\n\ncomplete anger management, failing to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings,\n\nand failing to pay the required fees and court costs. (RR46: 144, 148-49, 150-51).\n\nDespite these numerous violations, in June of 2010, appellant was continued on\n\nprobation and sent to an intermediate sanctions facility (“ISF”) to complete a\n\ncognitive track program. (RR46: 152, 163). Appellant completed the program and\n\nwas released in January of 2011; however, one month later he was arrested for a\n\nfamily violence assault against Kametra and absconded from probation for the\n\nnext five months. (RR46: 152-53). He had a warrant out for his arrest for violating\n\nhis probation at the time he was arrested the instant offense on August 22, 2011.\n\n(RR46: 154).\n\n      Appellant did not voluntarily turn himself in after drowning his two sons.\n\nHe evaded police for most of the day, but was eventually captured. After the\n\nboys’ bodies were found in the back of Naimah’s car, several police officers set up\n\na perimeter of the area and continued to search for appellant with the assistance\n\nof the helicopter unit. (RR46: 104, 107-11). Eventually appellant was spotted on\n\nfoot, and five to six officers pursued him in a foot-chase. (RR46: 111-12). They\n\n                                          20\n\ffinally captured him in the bottom of an empty creek bed and appellant resisted\n\narrest by fighting, pushing and kicking the officers. (RR46: 112-13). The officers\n\nhad to use a Taser at least three times in order to gain control and place him in\n\nhandcuffs. (RR46: 113-14).\n\n      While confined in Dallas County Jail and awaiting trial for capital murder,\n\nappellant had several disciplinary violations. On October 25, 2011, when appellant\n\nwas instructed that he would be changing cells, he refused and had to be forcibly\n\nmoved to another cell by two guards. (RR47: 101-03). Appellant was given five\n\ndays of restrictions as a result, which meant that he was moved into a single cell\n\nand not allowed to go to the commissary, have visitation, or make personal phone\n\ncalls other than to his attorney for five days. (RR47: 105). On April 25, 2012,\n\nappellant was unhappy about the tray of food he was served and refused to\n\nreturn the plastic tray until the guard served him another tray. (RR47: 104). When\n\nthe guards went into appellant’s cell to cease the food tray, appellant swung at\n\none of them and the guards had to use force to detain him. (RR47: 104-05). As a\n\nresult of this infraction, appellant was given twenty-five days of restrictions.\n\n(RR47: 105). On March 26, 2013, appellant was written up for fighting another\n\ninmate and received fifteen days of restrictions. (RR47: 111-12). On November 24,\n\n                                       21\n\f2012, in a jail phone call to his brother Jamal, appellant told his brother that the\n\nonly reason he had not “fired off on some of these fools” was because he wanted\n\nto keep up with his sports and visits. (RR47: 136–38; State’s Exhibit 184).\n\n      In addition to appellant’s lengthy history of criminal behavior and\n\ndisrespect toward any person of authority, the State also presented evidence of\n\nappellant’s violence toward Kametra throughout their relationship. Kametra met\n\nappellant in the summer of 2005 when she was fifteen years old and they began\n\ndating. (RR46: 169-70). They had been dating for two to three weeks when\n\nappellant became violent with her. (RR46: 176). The first incident of violence\n\nhappened in the backyard of appellant’s house following a verbal argument.\n\n(RR46: 177). Kametra told appellant she was leaving and he grabbed her, threw\n\nher in the back seat of his car, hit her with his fists multiple times, and told her\n\nshe was not leaving. (RR46: 177-78).\n\n      Appellant’s violence toward Kametra occurred once or twice a week in the\n\nbeginning of their relationship, but escalated over the last few years they were\n\ntogether. (RR46: 179-80, 202). If Kametra burnt the rice, stayed outside too long\n\nwith her sister, spoke disrespectfully to appellant, or questioned appellant about\n\nthe way he was spending her money, appellant responded with physical abuse.\n\n                                         22\n\f(RR46: 202-03, 210-13). When Kametra found out she was pregnant with their\n\nfirst child, Naim, appellant became upset and asked her to have an abortion.\n\n(RR46: 186-87, 188-89). He also encouraged her to drink bleach or attempt to\n\nabort the baby using a wire hanger. (RR46: 188). When Kametra refused to abort\n\nthe baby, he punched and kicked her in the stomach in an effort to make her have\n\na miscarriage. (RR46: 187-88, 191). Appellant repeated this abusive behavior\n\nwhen Kametra became pregnant with Elijah. (RR46: 195-96). Kametra’s sister,\n\nGabrielle Armstead (“Gabby”), witnessed the abuse and repeatedly encouraged\n\nKametra to leave appellant. (RR46: 210-13).\n\n      In December of 2010, Kametra had grown tired of appellant being in and\n\nout of jail, failing to work, and being physically abusive towards her, so she\n\ndecided to leave him. (RR46: 218-20). She and the boys left with her sister Gabby\n\nand stayed in a motel. (RR46: 221-22). For the next few months, they bounced\n\naround between the motel, shelters, and Priscilla’s house. (RR46: 221-23, 225).\n\nKametra resorted to prostitution in order to make money for food, diapers, the\n\nmotel, and her newly developed drug addiction. (RR46: 222, 224). After a few\n\nmonths, Kametra checked into Nexus, a drug abuse treatment facility, and\n\nreceived the help she needed. (RR46: 222, 224-25, 249-51). Despite the hard\n\n                                       23\n\ftimes she encountered over the months after leaving appellant, she knew that\n\nleaving him was the right decision and never got back together with him. (RR46:\n\n222).\n\n        After the breakup, appellant continued to use violence to make Kametra\n\ncomply with his demands. In February of 2011, when Kametra and the boys were\n\nwere staying with her mother, appellant came over and wanted to take Naim and\n\nElijah with him. (RR46: 228-30). When Kametra told him no, appellant punched\n\nKametra in the face, grabbed Naim from inside the house, and kicked in the side\n\ndoor of the house to escape. (RR46: 230-35). Kametra called the police, who\n\nlocated appellant a short time later and brought Naim home. (RR46: 233-36).\n\n        In March of 2011, Kametra borrowed Gabby’s car to pick up the boys from\n\nappellant’s house. (RR46: 236-37). Appellant insisted that Kametra take him to\n\nthe store and got in the car with them. (RR46: 239). When Kametra refused,\n\nappellant choked her until she passed out. (RR46: 240). She awoke inside\n\nappellant’s house and when she attempted to leave, appellant hit her in the head\n\nwith a heavy object. (RR46: 241). Kametra finally convinced appellant to let her\n\nreturn Gabby’s car. (RR46: 242-43). When they exited the car, Gabby saw that\n\nKametra was bleeding and called the police. (RR46: 243). Appellant was carrying\n\n                                       24\n\fElijah and threatened to kill him if Kametra did not go with him. (RR46: 245-46).\n\nThe police were driving around searching for appellant and when they spotted\n\nhim, appellant took off running. (RR46: 247). Initially he was still holding Elijah,\n\nbut he threw him down and kept running. (RR46: 247-48). Following this incident,\n\nCPS instructed Kametra that appellant was not allowed to have unsupervised\n\nvisitation with the boys. (RR46: 250).\n\n      In light of this history, Kametra was afraid of appellant and believed his\n\nthreats to kill her, Naim, and Elijah on the day of the offense. (RR46: 252).\n\nKametra believed that if she had done anything differently that day, the outcome\n\nwould be worse and they would all be dead right now. (RR46: 252). She also\n\nbelieves that Jeremiah would be dead if Brandon had not been at her mother’s\n\nhouse that morning. (RR46: 252).\n\n      Since the day of the offense, appellant has continued to blame others for\n\nhis actions. At the end of his police interview, appellant asked Detective Yeric to\n\ntell Kametra that she was the reason he did it. (RR47: 118). While in jail, appellant\n\nwrote a letter to Kametra’s mother stating, “I wished that I could have just talked\n\nto [Kametra] about this, but she should have never jumped out of the car and did\n\nwhat she did...this may sound crazy, but tell her I love her still and wish she would\n\n                                         25\n\fhave just listened to me that day because I didn’t want this to happen.” (RR46:\n\n256; State’s Exhibit 42).\n\n                        C. Appellant’s Punishment Evidence\n\n        At punishment, appellant presented evidence of the neglect, violence, and\n\nsexual abuse he suffered during his childhood. Appellant had five siblings:\n\nAbdullah, Jamal, Aqueelah, Sekinah, and Rashad. (RR47: 140, 169-70, 183-84).\n\nTheir mother, Naimah, was married to Roger Mopping when the children were\n\nyoung, until about the time that Jamal was in fifth grade. (RR47: 141, 170-71).\n\nRoger was the biological father of Jamal and Aqueelah. (RR47: 141, 183, 233,\n\n248). Abdullah and appellant were told that their biological father was a man\n\nnamed Lynn, but no one knew for sure. (RR47: 149-50, 154, 183-84, 233, 248-49).\n\nNone of them knew who the biological father of Sekinah or Rashad was. (RR47:\n\n149, 162-63, 184, 248-49). Naimah was a drug-addicted prostitute who was rarely\n\nhome. (RR47: 148, 150, 184-86, 231, 235-36; RR48: 31, 38-39, 47). Roger also\n\nbecame addicted to drugs. (RR47: 149-50, 186, 234-35, 238). Roger loved Naimah\n\nbut eventually left her because she kept getting pregnant by other men. (RR47:\n\n249).\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\f      After Roger left, Naimah and the children moved in with Naimah’s mother\n\nDorothy May Butler (“Madea”), who was confined to a wheelchair. (RR47: 152-53,\n\n187-88). Even though Madea was crippled and regularly needed assistance from\n\nthe children, this was the only stable portion of their childhood that they could\n\nrecall. (RR47: 152-53, 187-88). After Madea passed away, Naimah was married to\n\nJoe Johnson for a short time. (RR47: 142, 159). While Joe did work and put a roof\n\nover their head, he was an alcoholic and appeared to care more about his hogs\n\nthan the children. (RR47: 159-61, 198-99, 245; RR48: 47). When Joe left Naimah,\n\nthe children lived with a variety of different people. (RR47: 161, 164, 193, 206-08;\n\nRR48: 29, 45). The girls were taken in by family members and somewhat\n\nprotected; however, the boys, who were all already involved in the juvenile\n\nsystem, were forced to fend for themselves. (RR47: 164, 177, 207; RR48: 29-30,\n\n45-46, 52, 55). According to Jamal, they ate out of dumpsters and resorted to\n\ncrime to make money. (RR47: 164-65).\n\n      Throughout their childhood, appellant and his siblings were regularly\n\nexposed to drugs and violence in their home. Naimah, her brothers, and her\n\nsister, Tina, drank alcohol and smoked cracked cocaine together at the house and\n\nthese binges frequently ended with violent fights. (RR47: 167, 194-95; RR48: 39,\n\n                                        27\n\f42-43). Naimah and Tina fought the most, and Tina was sent to prison for twenty\n\nyears for stabbing Naimah in the face during one of their arguments. (RR47: 156-\n\n57, 195-97; RR48: 42). Naimah was also violent toward the children when she\n\nbelieved they were taking her drugs away. (RR47: 166, 189-92).\n\n      The children were also victims of sexual abuse. Abdullah, the eldest\n\nbrother, sexually assaulted Aqueelah, Sekinah and appellant. (RR47: 202-03;\n\nRR48: 40-41). Aqueelah and Sekinah recalled that he would frequently come into\n\ntheir room at night and rub his penis on them, fondle them, and ejaculate on\n\nthem. (RR47: 202-03; RR48: 40-41). According to appellant, Abdullah played with\n\nhis penis and made appellant play with his. (Defendant’s Exhibit 11). Appellant\n\nalso reported that he was sexually abused around age four or five by an older\n\nwoman who asked him to have sex with her. (Defendant’s Exhibit 11).\n\n      Both Aqueelah and Sekinah graduated from high school due to the\n\nguidance they received from the friends and relatives who helped take care of\n\nthem in Naimah’s absence. (RR48: 31-32, 37). However, no one encouraged the\n\nboys to attend school or stay out of trouble. (RR47: 204; RR48: 31-32, 46). To the\n\ncontrary, the eldest brother, Abdullah, taught Jamal to steal and commit crimes,\n\nand that way of life was then passed on to appellant and Rashad. (RR47: 153-55,\n\n                                       28\n\f205; RR48: 32). Like appellant, Abdullah, Jamal and Rashad were involved in a\n\nnumber of juvenile and adult crimes and spent time in prison. (RR47: 157-58, 163,\n\n205-06; RR48: 29). Abdullah was shot in the chest when he was eighteen years old\n\nand survived; however, he died from complications related to that gunshot\n\nwound in January of 2011. (RR47: 158).\n\n      With regard to appellant’s medical history, the defense presented evidence\n\nthat appellant was struck by an automobile around age three and had to go to the\n\nhospital. (RR48: 177-78; Defendant’s Exhibit 11). In 2009, appellant started having\n\nbrain seizures and has been receiving treatment for epilepsy since that time.\n\n(RR48: 178-79; Defendant’s Exhibit 11).\n\n      Dr. Gilbert Martinez, a clinical neuropsychologist, was hired by the defense\n\nto test appellant’s cognitive and intellectual functioning. (RR48: 100-02). In order\n\nto form the opinions offered by his testimony, Dr. Martinez examined appellant’s\n\nmedical records and a previous psychological evaluation conducted in 1994 when\n\nappellant was in the juvenile system. He also conducted a clinical interview of\n\nappellant and administered a battery of psychological tests on appellant. (RR48:\n\n102-04, 106-07, 111-12, 141; Defendant’s Exhibit 11). With regard to his\n\nintellectual functioning, appellant received a full-scale IQ score of 76. (RR48: 114-\n\n                                          29\n\f16, 124-25; Defendant’s Exhibit 11). According to Dr. Martinez, appellant is not\n\nmentally retarded, but his IQ score falls in the borderline range of intellectual\n\nfunctioning. (RR48: 114-16, 124-25, 133; Defendant’s Exhibit 11).\n\n        With regard to appellant’s cognitive functioning, Dr. Martinez diagnosed\n\nappellant with mild neurocognitive disorder. (RR48: 122-24; Defendant’s Exhibit\n\n11). Appellant does not have severe cognitive or memory deficits, but he does\n\nhave deficits in executive functioning. (RR48: 118-19, 122-24, 133). Dr. Martinez\n\nexplained that a person with deficits in executive functioning has poor judgment\n\nand reasoning and may have difficulty making decisions, controlling their thinking\n\nand behavior, and learning from their mistakes. (RR48: 111, 123-24, 126-27, 134-\n\n35, 164-65). Dr. Martinez believes that appellant’s deficits in executive\n\nfunctioning may be due to the combined effect of his epilepsy, the head injury he\n\nsustained as a child, and the lack of emotional support he received as a child.\n\n(RR48: 127-29, 133; Defendant’s Exhibit 11). Appellant’s chronic drug use could be\n\na contributor to his deficits in executive functioning, or appellant’s choice to use\n\ndrugs could be the result of those deficits and his poor judgment. (RR48: 131,\n\n133).\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\f      Dr. Kellie Gray-Smith testified as an expert on special education and the\n\nmulticultural aspects of psychology. (RR49: 11-14). Dr. Gray-Smith, a licensed\n\npsychologist and licensed specialist in school psychology, is currently employed as\n\nthe special education coordinator for Plano Independent School District. (RR49:\n\n11-12). In her field of study, it is well-documented that different cultures treat the\n\nintervention and treatment of medical, mental health, and educational needs\n\ndifferently. (RR49: 15, 59). With regards to special education, there has\n\nhistorically been distrust within the African-American community of special\n\neducation services and a negative stigma attached to a child who accepts those\n\nservices. (RR49: 15-16, 59). These beliefs are often perpetuated by black leaders,\n\nespecially in the church. (RR49: 16).\n\n      Special education was developed and designed to address students’\n\nacademic, emotional-behavioral, and social needs. (RR49: 17). She explained that\n\nacademic failure can develop for a number a reasons and it is not uncommon for\n\nan emotional disturbance to cause academic failure or vice versa. (RR49: 18-19,\n\n59-60). Many behaviors – such as fighting, profanity, disrespect, and non-\n\ncompliance – are perceived to be choice-based behaviors when sometimes they\n\nare actually caused by an underlying emotional, behavioral, or academic\n\n                                         31\n\fdisability. (RR49: 19-20). Literature shows that students whose needs are not\n\nrecognized and addressed by an early age are at risk for chronic school failure,\n\nremoval from school, school dropout, unemployment, substance abuse, criminal\n\nactivity, and confinement in the penitentiary. (RR49: 21-24). If there is no\n\nintervention or treatment, the student can develop oppositional defiant disorder,\n\nconduct disorder and, eventually, anti-social personality disorder. (RR49: 42-43,\n\n45). According to Dr. Gray-Smith, it is common for people with this behavior\n\npattern to end up in jail. (RR49: 43-44, 73). This is what is known within the\n\npsychological community as the “school-to-prison pipeline,” and it is most\n\nprevalent with African-American males. (RR49: 44).\n\n      Dr. Gray-Smith reviewed appellant’s school records, the psychological\n\nevaluation done in 1994 when appellant was a juvenile, and the report of Dr.\n\nGilbert Martinez. (RR49: 26-27, 41). Dr. Gray-Smith testified that appellant’s\n\nschool records demonstrate that appellant experienced chronic school failure\n\nstarting in elementary school that went unaddressed. (RR49: 29-30, 33). In her\n\nopinion, this pattern of school failure was consistent with oppositional defiant\n\ndisorder. (RR49: 56-57). She believed appellant’s behavioral problems continued\n\nand escalated due to the school district’s failure to provide effective intervention\n\n                                        32\n\fand assistance to appellant. (RR49: 30-31, 33, 35, 61). In her opinion, appellant’s\n\nschool and psychological records suggest that he has anti-social personality\n\ndisorder. (RR49: 58, 66-67, 72).\n\n                         D. The State’s Rebuttal Evidence\n\n      Melodye Nelson, a 24-year veteran of the Texas Department of Criminal\n\nJustice-Institutional Division (“TDCJ”), testified as an expert on the prison system\n\nin Texas. (RR49: 101-47). Warden Nelson previously worked as a correctional\n\nofficer on death row and is now the senior warden over the Mountain View and\n\nHilltop female prison facilities. (RR49: 101-02). Warden Nelson testified generally\n\nabout how inmates are classified and housed and the opportunity for violence\n\nwithin the prison system. (RR49: 102-47).\n\n      She explained that general population inmates are classified as a “G1”\n\nthrough “G5,” with G1’s and G2’s being the inmates with the least amount of\n\nsupervision. (RR49: 105, 123). There is also administrative segregation and death\n\nrow, which are much more restrictive. (RR49: 105, 123, 135). An inmate’s initial\n\nclassification is not based on the crime committed, but rather on the sentence\n\nreceived, his behavior during any previous incarceration, and whether he is a\n\nmember of a documented gang. (RR49: 105, 123-24, 126-28, 140). An inmate\n\n                                        33\n\fserving a sentence of 50 years or more who has served less than ten years is\n\nautomatically going to be classified as a G3. (RR49: 109, 124). That person can\n\nmove up or down within the classification system depending on their behavior.\n\n(RR49: 110-11, 127-31, 135-36, 146-47). This means a person convicted of capital\n\nmurder and sentenced to life without parole and who is not a documented\n\nmember of a gang would be classified as a G3; the only distinction, however, is\n\nthat person would never move down below a G3 classification. (RR49: 107, 109-\n\n10, 111-12, 125-26).\n\n      Inmates classified as G1’s, G2’s and G3’s live in dormitories or cell blocks\n\nand can walk around unescorted throughout their prison facility. (RR49: 105-06,\n\n107, 14-41). A capital murderer sentenced to life without parole who is classified\n\nas a G3 can shower, work, eat, go to school, go to the library and recreate like any\n\nother G3 in the general population. (RR49: 107, 109). In contrast, inmates on\n\ndeath row are housed in single cells and confined approximately 23 hours per\n\nday. (RR49: 114). They are allowed visitation and limited recreation, but they are\n\nstrip-searched prior to leaving their cell and are always escorted in restraints with\n\ntwo correctional officers. (RR49: 114).\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\f      According to Warden Nelson, the Texas prison system is a well-run\n\norganization. (RR49: 121, 143). Nonetheless, there is an opportunity for violence\n\nthroughout the prisons, regardless of classification level. (RR49: 112, 118, 131,\n\n144). Even on death row, the most secure unit in Texas, violence occurs. (RR49:\n\n112-13). Whether an inmate will commit acts of violence depends on the\n\nindividual inmate and his demeanor. (RR49: 133-34, 136, 142). Inmates get\n\ncreative in making weapons and use whatever they have access to, including\n\ntypewriter rods, nails, screws, rocks, and sharpened chicken or pork bones. (RR49:\n\n115-17).\n\n                           SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Issues 1-20: The trial court properly denied appellant’s challenges for cause\n\nagainst twenty prospective jurors. All of the denials were proper, and appellant\n\nhas not shown that he was denied the use of a statutorily provided peremptory\n\nchallenge.\n\n      Issues 21-22: Appellant’s argument that he was deprived of a lawfully\n\nconstituted jury lacks merit. Appellant has failed to prove that any of the trial\n\ncourt’s rulings on any of the challenges resulted in the seating of a juror who was\n\nbiased or prejudiced.\n\n                                        35\n\f      Issues 23-26: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting\n\nautopsy photographs of the victims. The photographs were relevant and\n\nnecessary to assist the medical examiner with her testimony and to link the\n\nvictims to this testimony, and their probative value was not outweighed by the\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice\n\n      Issues 27 and 41: The trial court properly overruled appellant’s objections\n\nto the State’s closing argument during both the guilt-innocence and punishment\n\nphases of trial because the complained-of arguments fell within the permissible\n\nareas of argument. Further, given the overwhelming evidence supporting the\n\njury’s guilty verdict and their answers to the special issues, any error was\n\nharmless.\n\n      Issue 28: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting testimony\n\nregarding appellant’s statements to CPS investigator Pamela Womack. Because\n\nWomack was not an agent of law enforcement, she was not required to comply\n\nwith Miranda.\n\n      Issue 29: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting State’s\n\nExhibit 173, certified business records pertaining to appellant’s 1997 conviction\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\ffor evading arrest. The totality of the evidence sufficiently linked appellant to the\n\nconviction.\n\n      Issues 30-32: The trial court properly overruled appellant’s objections to\n\nthe testimony of police officers Chris Havens, Harold Andrews, and Brandon\n\nHernandez. These officers properly used police reports to refresh their memory\n\nand then testified from their refreshed memory.\n\n      Issues 33 and 37: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting\n\nthe testimony of Officer David Solomon regarding his arrest of appellant. His\n\ntestimony was relevant to link appellant to an unadjudicated burglary offense\n\npreviously presented by the State, and it did not leave a false impression that\n\nappellant was involved in a different offense.\n\n      Issue 34: The trial court properly admitted the expert testimony of Warden\n\nMelodye Nelson as her testimony was relevant and helpful to the jury in deciding\n\nthe first special issue. Alternatively, any error in the admission of this testimony\n\nwas harmless.\n\n      Issue 35: The trial court satisfied its duty to conduct a threshold\n\ndetermination of the admissibility of extraneous offenses. Any error in the trial\n\ncourt’s failure to grant appellant’s request for a separate hearing was harmless\n\n                                         37\n\fbecause the State clearly proved each extraneous offense presented during the\n\npunishment phase.\n\n      Issue 36: Where the trial court granted appellant’s request and instructed\n\nthe jury to disregard inadmissible testimony, it did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying appellant’s motion for mistrial.\n\n      Issues 38 and 39: Appellant failed to preserve his complaints regarding the\n\ncross-examination of his experts for appellate review. In any event, the trial court\n\ndid not err by permitting the State to cross-examine Dr. Kellie Gray-Smith and Dr.\n\nGilbert Martinez regarding antisocial personality disorder, an issue within their\n\narea of expertise and clearly relevant to appellant’s death-worthiness.\n\n      Issue 40: The trial court’s statement regarding sequestration was not an\n\nimproper comment on the weight of the evidence. Regardless, appellant was not\n\nharmed by the trial court’s comment because it was not calculated to benefit the\n\nState or prejudice appellant’s rights.\n\n      Issue 42: The evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury’s answer to\n\nthe future dangerousness special issue. Based upon the facts of the instant\n\noffense, as well as the evidence of appellant’s past acts of crime and violence, a\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\frational jury could find that appellant would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety.\n\n      Issues 43-54: Appellant’s admittedly meritless federal constitutional\n\nchallenges to the Texas death penalty statute are presented only to preserve the\n\ncomplaints for federal habeas review. And while appellant invites this Court to\n\nrevisit its prior holdings against his position, he provides no new authority for this\n\nCourt or the State to address.\n\n                                     ARGUMENT\n\n               Issues 1-20: Denial of Defense Challenges For Cause\n\n      In issues 1 through 20, appellant claims the trial court violated statutory\n\nand constitutional law by erroneously causing him to use all fifteen of his\n\nstatutorily allotted peremptory strikes plus two additional strikes on persons who\n\nshould have been removed for cause. Moreover, he contends that the trial court\n\nforced him to accept an objectionable juror after denying his request for\n\nadditional strikes. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 20-87).\n\n      The trial court properly denied all of appellant’s challenges for cause. Thus,\n\nhis contentions are without merit and should be overruled.\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f                                  Applicable Law\n\n      A veniremember may be challenged for cause if, among other reasons, he\n\npossesses a bias or prejudice in favor of or against the defendant or he possesses\n\na bias against an aspect of the law upon which the State or the defendant is\n\nentitled to rely. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. arts. 35.16(a)(9), (b)(3), (c)(2)\n\n(West 2006); Threadgill v. State, 146 S.W.3d 654, 667 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). A\n\n“bias against the law” is the refusal to consider or apply the relevant law. Sadler v.\n\nState, 977 S.W.2d 140, 142 (Tex. Crim. App. 1998). The test is whether the bias or\n\nprejudice would substantially impair the prospective juror’s ability to carry out his\n\noath and instructions in accordance with the law. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n      Appellant has the burden of establishing that his challenge for cause is\n\nproper. See Feldman v. State, 71 S.W.3d 738, 747 (Tex. Crim. App. 2002). Before a\n\nprospective juror can be excused for bias, the law must be explained to him and\n\nhe must be asked whether he can follow that law regardless of his personal views.\n\nThreadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667. Appellant does not meet his burden of establishing\n\nthat his challenge for cause is proper until he has shown that the veniremember\n\nunderstood the requirement of the law and could not overcome his prejudice well\n\nenough to follow it. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747.\n\n                                         40\n\f      When reviewing a trial court’s decision to deny a challenge for cause, the\n\nappellate court looks at the entire record to determine if there is sufficient\n\nevidence to support the ruling. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The appellate court\n\nreviews a trial court’s ruling with “considerable” or “great” deference because the\n\ntrial judge is in the best position to evaluate the prospective juror’s demeanor and\n\nwas present to observe the juror and listen to his tone of voice. Saldano v. State,\n\n232 S.W.3d 77, 91 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\nParticular deference is given when the prospective juror’s answers are vacillating,\n\nunclear, or contradictory. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667. The appellate court\n\nreverses a trial court’s ruling on a challenge for cause “only if a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion is evident.” Colburn v. State, 966 S.W.2d 511, 517 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1998). When the venireperson is persistently uncertain about his or her ability to\n\nfollow the law, the reviewing court does not second guess the trial court. Id.\n\n      To prevail on a claim of erroneous denial of a challenge for cause, the\n\ndefendant must object to the trial court that he is compelled to try his case with\n\nat least one individual on the jury who he would have removed with a\n\nperemptory challenge had one been available to him. Harm from the erroneous\n\ndenial of a defense challenge for cause occurs: (1) when a defendant uses a\n\n                                        41\n\fperemptory challenge to remove a veniremember whom the trial court should\n\nhave excused for cause at the defendant’s request, (2) the defendant uses all of\n\nhis statutorily allotted peremptory challenges, and (3) the defendant\n\nunsuccessfully requests an additional peremptory challenge which he claims he\n\nwould use to remove another veniremember whom the defendant identifies as\n\n“objectionable” and who actually sits on the jury. Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 91.\n\nWhen this occurs, the trial court’s erroneous denial of a challenge for cause\n\nharms the defendant by wrongfully depriving him of at least one of his statutory\n\nperemptory challenges that he could have used to remove the juror whom he has\n\nidentified as objectionable. Id.\n\n      The parties asserted their challenges for cause and peremptory challenges\n\nat the conclusion of each prospective juror’s individual voir dire. Appellant\n\nexhausted all fifteen of his statutory peremptory strikes and two additional strikes\n\ngranted by the court. (RR36: 176-77; RR37: 85). The court denied appellant’s\n\nrequest for a third additional strike to exercise on Ernest Hand, whom appellant\n\nidentified as objectionable. (RR39: 90-91). Since appellant received two extra\n\nperemptory challenges, appellant must show that the trial court erroneously\n\ndenied at least three of his challenges for cause to the other veniremembers\n\n                                        42\n\fidentified in issues one through twenty. See, e.g., Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 93\n\n(noting that the defendant would have to show the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenges for cause to three of the complained-of venire members because\n\nhe received two extra peremptory strikes).\n\n        The Trial Court Properly Denied Appellant’s Challenges for Cause\n\n                              Issue 1: Milton Powell\n\n      Appellant exercised his first peremptory strike against Milton Powell. (RR6:\n\n161-62). At trial, appellant objected that Powell should be excused for cause\n\nbecause (1) he was “death prone,” (2) he would give a police officer witness an\n\n“elevated level of credibility,” and (3) he would find appellant guilty regardless of\n\nthe State’s failure to prove a “technicality.” (RR6: 160-61). On appeal, appellant\n\ncontends Powell also should have been excused because he would not give\n\nmeaningful consideration to appellant’s mitigation evidence. (Appellant’s Brief,\n\npp. 22-23).\n\n      Appellant’s complaint about Powell’s inability to consider his mitigation\n\nevidence is not preserved for review because it was not raised at trial. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 33.1(a) (providing that a timely specific trial objection is prerequisite to\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fpresenting a complaint on appellate review). Nevertheless, appellant fails to\n\ndemonstrate error in the denial of his challenge on any ground argued on appeal.\n\n                                   “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant claims Powell’s answers showed that, if he found appellant guilty\n\nof capital murder, then he would automatically answer the special issues in such a\n\nmanner to return a death verdict. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 21-22). The record reflects\n\nthe contrary. During questioning by both sides, Powell described his duty to\n\nfollow the law governing the special issues as “a tremendous responsibility.” He\n\ninsisted that he would carefully consider the evidence as it related to those issues\n\nand that he would not return a death sentence simply because he found appellant\n\nguilty. When asked by defense counsel if his ability to follow the law would be\n\nimpaired if the offense involved the death of a child, Powell stated only that it\n\nwould influence his answers to the special issues and make his task more difficult.\n\n(RR6: 120, 122, 124, 137, 140-41, 147-48, 155-56). The court properly concluded\n\nthat Powell was not death prone.\n\n                             Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant contends Powell’s answers showed he “would give any police\n\nofficer automatic credibility before hearing the witness” and that he “would judge\n\n                                        44\n\fa law enforcement officer using a different criteria [sic] to determine credibility\n\nthan other witnesses.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 22). In his questionnaire, Powell\n\nstated that he believed police officers were more likely to tell the truth than the\n\naverage person. (RR6: 123). During questioning at trial, the prosecutor explained\n\nto Powell that the law required him to treat all witnesses as equals at the outset,\n\nand that he must wait until he heard their testimony before assessing their\n\ncredibility. Powell responded that he understood this law and would follow it.\n\n(RR6: 123).\n\n      During questioning by defense counsel, Powell again admitted his tendency\n\nto believe officers and to give them an “elevated level of credibility.” (RR6: 133).\n\nDefense counsel did not question Powell about whether this tendency would\n\naffect his ability to follow the law, however. Thus, this statement did not impeach\n\nor contradict Powell’s earlier assurances during the prosecutor’s questioning on\n\nthe matter. Even if it did, the statement merely presented the trial court with a\n\nfact question which it was free to resolve against appellant. Threadgill, 146\n\nS.W.3d at 667 (holding particular deference is given to trial court’s ruling on a\n\nchallenge for cause when the prospective juror’s answers are vacillating, unclear,\n\nor contradictory).\n\n                                        45\n\f                              State’s Burden of Proof\n\n      Appellant contends Powell’s testimony showed that “he would have a hard\n\ntime finding someone not guilty if the State failed to prove all of the elements of\n\nthe indictment.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 23). In support of this contention, appellant\n\ncites Powell’s testimony during defense questioning that he would “probably still\n\nconvict” if the indictment alleged Dallas County but the State proved the crime\n\noccurred in Tarrant County. (RR6: 130-31). Powell made similar statements on\n\ntwo other occasions during defense questioning. (RR6: 137, 140). None of these\n\nstatements required Powell’s excusal for cause.\n\n      At trial, defense counsel challenged Powell for refusing to require the State\n\n“to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the allegations in the indictment . . .”\n\n(RR6: 161). The State is not required to prove venue beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nProof by a preponderance of the evidence satisfies the State’s burden. Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 13.17 (West 2005). Admittedly, the State also misstated the\n\nlaw governing its burden of proof on venue. (RR6: 107-08). Nevertheless, Powell\n\ncannot be deemed biased for refusing to hold the State to a higher standard of\n\nproof than the law requires. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(c)(2).\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f      Even if appellant was entitled to a juror who would require a greater\n\ndegree of proof, the court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the challenge\n\nto Powell. When initially questioned by the prosecutor on the matter, Powell\n\nstated that he would hold the State to its burden of proving every element,\n\nincluding venue, beyond a reasonable doubt. (RR6: 107-08). Furthermore,\n\nPowell’s statements during defense questioning that he “probably would still\n\nconvict” and that he “might overlook” or “tend to overlook that technicality”\n\nwere not emphatic refusals to hold the State to its burden. Thus, resolution of this\n\nconflict in Powell’s testimony against appellant was reasonable and within the\n\ncourt’s discretion. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n                                  Mitigation Bias\n\n      Lastly, appellant contends Powell should have been excused because he\n\n“could not give meaningful consideration to any mitigation that the defense\n\nwould rely on in punishment.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 22). In support of this\n\ncontention, appellant refers to Powell’s questionnaire, in which he disagreed that\n\ngenetics, circumstances of birth, upbringing, and environment should be\n\nconsidered when determining punishment. He also cites to Powell’s testimony\n\nthat he felt incarceration was an insufficient punishment for some crimes. Id.\n\n                                         47\n\f      No juror is required to consider any particular fact as mitigating. Standefer\n\nv. State, 59 S.W.3d 177, 181 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001). Moreover, Powell made\n\nrepeated and unwavering statements about his ability to follow the law and\n\nconsider all of the evidence in answering the special issues. (RR6: 120, 122, 124).\n\nThis is all the law required of him. Thus, if the court had been presented with this\n\nparticular challenge, it would have been proper to deny it.\n\n      Powell was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n1.\n\n                             Issue 2: Georgia Nichols\n\n      Appellant exercised his second peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nGeorgia Nichols. (RR10: 121). At trial, appellant objected that Nichols should have\n\nbeen excused for cause because (1) she would not hold the State to its burden of\n\nproving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and (2) she could not consider the\n\nminimum punishment for the lesser-included offense of murder. (RR10: 118-19).\n\nOn appeal, appellant does not complain that Nichols should have been excused\n\nfor her position on the punishment range for murder. Thus, that ground is not\n\npresented for review.\n\n\n\n                                        48\n\f       Appellant does present and argue the other ground raised at trial –\n\nNichols’s inability to hold the State to its burden of proof at guilt. Moreover, he\n\nraises two new allegations: (1) that Nichols would automatically have assessed a\n\ndeath sentence if she found him guilty of capital murder, and (2) that she was\n\n“biased against any mitigation.”2 (Appellant’s Brief, p. 29-30). Because these two\n\nnew grounds were not raised at trial, they are not preserved for review on appeal.\n\nTex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant fails to demonstrate that Nichols\n\nshould have been excused for cause on any of the three grounds argued on\n\nappeal.\n\n                                  State’s Burden of Proof\n\n       Appellant contends Nichols should have been excused because her prior\n\njury service biased her against the law that required her to acquit if the State\n\nfailed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant cites to Nichols’s\n\nquestionnaire in which she commented on the following statement: “Regardless\n\n\n\n\n2\n  In his brief, appellant also makes passing references to Nichols’s questionnaire answers\nrelated to police officer credibility and her opinion about the rehabilitation of capital\nmurderers. There is no accompanying argument nor were these answers raised at trial as a\nbasis for challenging Nichols. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 30; RR10: 118-19). If these references were\nintended to present additional grounds for excusing Nichols, they are inadequately briefed and\nwill not be addressed by the State.\n                                               49\n\fof what a judge says the law is, jurors should do what they believe is the right\n\nthing.” Nichols agreed with the statement, saying, “I was on a criminal jury once;\n\neverything pointed to crime, but we let the criminal go free, because of ‘evidence,\n\nbeyond a doubt’, which does not exist & is impossible if not witnessed; we let a\n\nbad man on the loose to hurt other children – I will never let this happen again.”\n\n(Nichols Questionnaire, p. 7).\n\n      Both sides questioned Nichols about this statement and her prior\n\nexperience as a juror. On both occasions, Nichols explained that she believed the\n\ndefendant in the prior trial was guilty and that she was the lone “hold-out” juror.\n\nThe other eleven jurors told her that she could not vote guilty unless she believed\n\nhe was guilty “beyond a shadow of a doubt” or unless she was 100% certain of his\n\nguilt. She believed that the only way she could be that certain of guilt was if she\n\nwitnessed the crime herself. (RR10: 41-42, 98-99).\n\n      The prosecutor explained that the burden of proof was beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt – not a shadow of a doubt – and that whatever convinced\n\nNichols beyond a reasonable doubt was sufficient to convict. Nichols quizzed the\n\nprosecutor repeatedly to ensure that she understood the burden of proof if\n\nselected for appellant’s jury. (RR10: 43-44, 73-74, 77-78). And when questioned\n\n                                        50\n\fby defense counsel, she confirmed her accurate understanding of that burden.\n\n(RR10: 98-99, 100-01, 103). Furthermore, the prosecutor explained to Nichols that\n\nif the State failed to meet its burden on any element of the offense, she was\n\nrequired to acquit. Nichols understood and agreed with this law and repeatedly\n\nstated that she would hold the State to its burden, even if it meant an acquittal.\n\n(RR10: 49-53).\n\n      Nichols never demonstrated an unwillingness to hold the State to proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The statement in her questionnaire evinced only a\n\nmisunderstanding of the law, not a bias against it, and her testimony resolved\n\nthat misunderstanding. Thus, the court properly denied the challenge against her.\n\n                                  Death Prone\n\n      Appellant contends various answers in Nichols’s questionnaire show that\n\nshe would automatically assess a death sentence if she found someone guilty of\n\ncapital murder. While apparently acknowledging that Nichols’s testimony shows\n\nshe would follow the law governing the assessment of punishment, appellant\n\ncontends she was indoctrinated by the prosecutor and that her answers did not\n\nreflect her true opinions. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 29, 31). The record reflects\n\notherwise.\n\n                                       51\n\f      Although Nichols strongly favored the death penalty, she stated that she\n\ncould set aside her strong feelings and give full consideration to the evidence.\n\n(RR10: 71). She also agreed that a sentence of life without parole was an extreme\n\npunishment and that she could be satisfied with such a sentence. (RR10: 53, 97,\n\n106). Furthermore, she stated on numerous occasions that she would wait and\n\nconsider the evidence at punishment when assessing the sentence, even if she\n\nfound the defendant guilty. Her answers were not merely one-word assents to\n\npropositions by the prosecutor. By all appearances, Nichols was a thoughtful,\n\nintelligent woman with a strong desire to follow the law. Her answers indicated\n\nan understanding and agreement with that law. (RR10: 45, 49, 54-55, 61-63, 65,\n\n71, 77, 77-78). Indeed, she answered the same way when posed similar questions\n\nat length by defense counsel. (RR10: 93-94, 100, 102, 107-08, 111, 113). Not once\n\ndid Nichols waver or give a conflicting answer on the matter. If appellant had\n\nchallenged Nichols on this basis at trial, the denial of that challenge would have\n\nbeen proper.\n\n                                 Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant contends Nichols was biased against any mitigation because in\n\nher questionnaire she opined that genetics, circumstances, upbringing,\n\n                                       52\n\fenvironment, and intoxication did not excuse criminal behavior. (Nichols\n\nQuestionnaire, pp. 6, 10). Nichols had no duty to consider any particular fact as\n\nmitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. She was only obligated to consider all the\n\nevidence presented at trial in determining her answers to the special issues. She\n\nunequivocally stated that she would do this, and she specifically stated that she\n\nwould consider any mitigating evidence presented. (RR10: 45, 49, 54-55, 71, 107-\n\n08, 113). Thus, if the court had been presented with this particular challenge, it\n\nwould have been proper to deny it.\n\n      Nichols was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n2.\n\n                              Issue 3: Dee Jay Earley\n\n      Appellant exercised his third peremptory strike against Dee Jay Earley.\n\n(RR12: 244). At trial, appellant challenged Earley for lying on his questionnaire and\n\nrefusing to consider evidence of intoxication in mitigation of punishment. (RR12:\n\n238-43). On appeal, appellant contends the court should have granted his\n\nchallenge on both of these grounds. He also contends the court should have\n\nexcused Earley for cause because he was “death prone.” (Appellant’s Brief, pp.\n\n32-35).\n\n                                         53\n\f      Because it was not raised at trial, the contention that Earley was death\n\nprone is not preserved for appellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless,\n\nappellant fails to demonstrate that Earley should have been excused for cause on\n\nany of the three grounds argued on appeal.\n\n                            Dishonesty in Questionnaire\n\n      Appellant contends Earley was dishonest because he did not reveal his\n\nvolunteer work as a victim’s advocate in his questionnaire. Appellant\n\ncharacterizes the omission as an intentional deception. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 34-\n\n35). The record refutes this characterization.\n\n      Earley first mentioned his advocacy work during questioning by the\n\nprosecutor. The information was not directly solicited. Earley volunteered it.\n\n(RR12: 171-72). He testified that he served as a victim’s advocate during his\n\nmilitary service. It was not part of his regular duties; it was volunteer work that he\n\nagreed to do at the request of his commanding officer. He volunteered for two\n\nand a half years. He would assist victims of domestic assault, child abuse, etc. with\n\nfinding food and shelter for the night and obtaining restraining orders. The\n\noffenses were typically minor; none involved a murder. (RR12: 171-72, 197-201).\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\f      Appellant claims that Earley should have provided the information in\n\nresponse to Question 58 in his questionnaire. The question asked Earley to list\n\n“any local, state or national citizens’ law enforcement group such as a crime\n\ncommission, group that supports the death penalty, group dedicated to victims’\n\nrights, traffic commission, neighborhood crime watch, Mothers Against Drunk\n\nDriving or police or sheriff’s auxiliary.” (Earley Questionnaire, p. 9). When the\n\ncourt asked Earley why he did not list his military advocacy work in response to\n\nthis question, he explained that he did not belong to any organization. He and the\n\nother volunteers did not meet as a group. He would simply get a phone call and\n\nrespond. Moreover, Earley explicitly denied any intent to deceive. (RR12: 239-43).\n\n      The court believed Earley and that credibility determination is entitled to\n\ndeference. (RR12: 243). It is amply supported by Earley’s explanation, by his\n\nexpress denial of any intent to deceive, and by the fact it was he who first\n\nvolunteered the information. Thus, the court’s denial of this challenge was\n\nproper.\n\n                      Consideration of Intoxication Evidence\n\n      Appellant contends Earley was biased against any mitigation evidence\n\nbecause he did not believe evidence of intoxication should be considered in\n\n                                       55\n\fmitigation of punishment. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 34). Earley had no duty to\n\nconsider any particular evidence mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. He was\n\nonly obligated to consider all the evidence presented at trial in determining his\n\nanswers to the special issues. Although he did not regard intoxication evidence as\n\nmitigating, he stated that he would consider it in answering the special issues.\n\n(RR12: 157-58, 225-30). Thus, Earley evinced no bias against the law and the court\n\nproperly denied this challenge.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends that Earley’s responses to some of the questions in his\n\nquestionnaire show that he would automatically assess a death sentence if he\n\nfound the defendant guilty of murder or crimes against the elderly or children.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, p. 33). Earley’s testimony dispelled any notion that he was\n\n“death prone.”\n\n      Although Earley favored the death penalty for certain types of crimes, he\n\nhad no problem with assessing a sentence of life without parole. (RR12: 204). He\n\nalso repeatedly and unequivocally stated that he would hold the State to its\n\nburden of proof on the first special issue, he would wait, listen to, and consider\n\nthe punishment evidence before answering the special issues, and he would not\n\n                                       56\n\fautomatically assess a death sentence just because he found appellant guilty.\n\n(RR12: 151-54, 159-66, 183, 188-89, 202-06, 215, 218-19, 224). The law required\n\nnothing more of Earley. Thus, any challenge that he was biased against the law\n\nwould have been properly denied.\n\n      Earley was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n3.\n\n                              Issue 4: Timothy Tinsley\n\n      Appellant exercised his fourth peremptory strike against Timothy Tinsley.\n\n(RR14: 116). At trial, appellant challenged Tinsley because: (1) he was unable to\n\ngive “fair and accurate consideration to sufficient mitigating evidence”; (2) he was\n\nunable “to start police officers on the same level of credibility as other\n\nwitnesses”; and (3) he was “death prone.” (RR 14: 110-11). On appeal, appellant\n\nargues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on all\n\nthree grounds. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 36-37). The record justifies the court’s ruling.\n\n                                   Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant contends Tinsley could not give full consideration to his\n\nmitigation evidence because of the “history of alcoholism in his family with his\n\n\n\n                                          57\n\fbrother as well as his stepdad.” (RR14: 110, 112). Tinsley’s testimony\n\ndemonstrates otherwise.\n\n      Tinsley testified that his stepfather was an alcoholic who repeatedly went\n\nto prison. Tinsley lived with his stepfather for a year and a half and moved out\n\nwhen he turned 18. (RR14: 28-30, 78-80). Also, Tinsley acknowledged in his\n\nquestionnaire and at trial that his brother is a recovering alcoholic. (RR14: 82;\n\nTinsley Questionnaire, p. 10). Based on his experiences with his stepfather, as well\n\nas the lessons of his biological father who was a drill sergeant, Tinsley believed\n\npeople should be held accountable for their actions. (RR14: 28-30). Furthermore,\n\nhe expressly stated that he would not characterize evidence of voluntary\n\nintoxication as mitigating. (RR14: 80-81). Tinsley he had no duty to treat such\n\nevidence as mitigating, however. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. He was only\n\nobligated to consider any evidence of intoxication presented at trial by either side\n\nin determining his answers to the special issues. Tinsley’s testimony reflects that\n\nhe could fulfill that duty.\n\n      Tinsley never stated that he would not consider evidence of intoxication or\n\ndrug use at punishment. He repeatedly assured both sides that he would have to\n\nhear the evidence before making any decisions on sentencing and that he would\n\n                                        58\n\fwait and listen to the evidence in determining his answers to both special issues.\n\n(RR14: 38, 46-47, 49-50, 57, 104). He explained what types of intoxication\n\nevidence he would regard as mitigating, e.g., involuntary intoxication evidence.\n\n(RR14: 80-81). Then, referencing his feelings about drug and alcohol abuse,\n\nTinsley avowed that his personal beliefs and the law “were two different things.”\n\n(RR14: 85-86).\n\n      If there were any doubt as to Tinsley ability to consider voluntary\n\nintoxication evidence at punishment, it was dispelled during the court’s\n\nquestioning of Tinsley on the matter. When asked if he could keep an open mind\n\nas to any evidence either side might present on the punishment issues, Tinsley\n\nsaid, “I think I can.” But when asked for a more definitive answer from the court,\n\nTinsley said, “I can.” (RR14: 113-15). Any vacillation in Tinsley’s answer was for\n\nthe trial court to resolve and that determination is entitled to deference.\n\nThreadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n                             Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant contends Tinsley could not treat police officers the same as other\n\nwitnesses, starting them out on an equal basis. Tinsley’s testimony shows the\n\nopposite.\n\n                                        59\n\f      Tinsley stated that he would give a police officer “a little more respect”\n\nthan the “average Joe.” ((RR14: 105). But he was referring to how he would treat\n\nthem outside of the courtroom. (RR14: 106). In court, Tinsley would treat all\n\nwitnesses the same and wait until he heard the testimony to judge it, even if,\n\ngenerally, he thought police were more credible. (RR14: 55-57). In Tinsley’s\n\nopinion, “Everybody’s human, you know, so I would just – I would listen to the\n\nstory and how it’s presented to determine, yeah.” (RR14: 105). Tinsley held no\n\nbias against the law governing police officer testimony, and the court properly\n\noverruled this challenge.\n\n                                 “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends that if he found appellant guilty of capital murder,\n\nTinsley would automatically answer the special issues in a manner that resulted in\n\na death sentence. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 36). Nothing in Tinsley’s testimony\n\nsupports this contention.\n\n      Throughout his testimony, Tinsley repeatedly stated that he would not\n\nautomatically vote for death if he found appellant guilty and that he would wait\n\nand consider the evidence presented at punishment in answering the special\n\nissues. (RR14: 38, 46-51, 57, 75, 86, 89, 104). By all appearances, Tinsley would\n\n                                       60\n\ffulfill his duty of waiting and considering all the evidence before he determined\n\nhis answers to the special issues. The court properly concluded that he was not\n\nchallengeable as “death prone.”\n\n      Tinsley was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n4.\n\n                               Issue 5: Robin Linn\n\nAppellant exercised his fifth peremptory challenge against venireperson Robin\n\nLinn. (RR14: 232). At trial, appellant objected that she was “death prone” and her\n\ntestimonial responses were disingenuous and motivated by a strong desire to get\n\non the jury. (RR14: 228-32).\n\n      Linn’s questionnaire and testimony demonstrated that she strongly favored\n\nthe death penalty and that she wanted to serve on the jury. (RR14: 127-28, 131-\n\n32; Linn Questionnaire). Neither of these facts rendered Linn challengeable for\n\ncause, however. And the remainder of Linn’s testimony demonstrates an\n\nunequivocal understanding of and willingness to follow the law.\n\n      While she favored the death penalty, Linn stated that she did not believe it\n\nwas appropriate for all homicides and that such a decision would have to be\n\nbased on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. (RR14: 132-36). She\n\n                                        61\n\fwould not refuse to consider any punishment evidence, she would not answer the\n\nfirst issue affirmatively simply because she found appellant guilty of capital\n\nmurder, and she believed that the special issues were a fair method for assessing\n\nwhether the death penalty was appropriate. (RR14: 161-63, 169-70, 174). She\n\ncould envision a scenario where a murderer might not be a future danger and\n\nwhere mitigating circumstances might warrant a life sentence. (RR14: 200, 210).\n\nAnd although she would like to know if a defendant were remorseful, she would\n\nnot require him to testify to such in assessing his sentence. She understood that a\n\ndefendant might feel remorseful but be unable to testify at trial for a variety of\n\nreasons. (RR14: 183, 201-02).\n\n      Appellant argued that Linn’s demeanor during questioning told another\n\nstory. According to defense counsel, Linn was simply saying what she needed to\n\nsay to get on a death penalty jury. But Linn’s desire to serve on appellant’s jury\n\nwas not motivated by a bloodlust. It was motivated by her faith in the system and\n\nher sense of civic duty. (RR14: 127-28). Her thoughtful explanations and\n\nresponses throughout questioning by both sides evinced an intelligent woman\n\nwho understood the gravity of serving in death penalty trial and who took the\n\nresponsibility seriously.\n\n                                        62\n\f      Defense counsel argued that Linn’s demeanor suggested otherwise. The\n\nprosecutor disputed that characterization. (RR14: 231). The trial court apparently\n\ndisagreed as well because it overruled the challenge. (RR14: 232). The court’s\n\ndetermination is entitled to deference and is amply supported by Linn’s\n\ntestimony, as detailed above.\n\n      Linn was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue 5.\n\n                                Issue 6: Charles Stout\n\n      Appellant exercised his sixth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nCharles Stout. (RR16: 77). At trial, appellant objected that Stout would hold the\n\ndecision not to testify against appellant, that he would put the burden of proof on\n\nappellant, that he would not presume appellant innocent, and that he did not\n\nunderstand the Texas death penalty sentencing scheme. (RR16: 74-76). On\n\nappeal, appellant focuses on one ground – holding his failure to testify against\n\nhim. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 44-45). The court’s rejection of this challenge was\n\nproper.\n\n      Appellant’s contention that Stout would hold his failure to testify against\n\nhim is premised on a mischaracterization of Stout’s testimony. Although he would\n\ntestify if he were a defendant, Stout repeatedly denied that he would hold\n\n                                         63\n\fanother’s decision not to testify against him. Stout agreed that the defendant has\n\nno burden of proof, and he acknowledged that there could be a variety of reasons\n\na defendant might not testify that had nothing to do with his guilt or innocence.\n\n(RR16: 36-38).\n\n      Stout did not equivocate or change his opinion when questioned on the\n\nmatter again by defense counsel. He reiterated the responses he gave the\n\nprosecutor during earlier questioning. He also more specifically testified that he\n\nwould not hold the decision not to testify against appellant in determining his\n\nguilt or innocence or in answering either of the special issues. (RR16: 47-48, 63-\n\n65). Stout’s clear and unwavering responses show that he held no bias against\n\nappellant’s Fifth Amendment right not to testify and would not consider it in his\n\ndeliberations.\n\n      Stout was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue 6.\n\n                             Issue 7: Allen Harrington\n\n      Appellant exercised his seventh peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nAllen Harrington. (RR23: 82). At trial, appellant objected that Harrington could not\n\nconsider evidence of intoxication, background, social issues, and expert mental\n\nhealth testimony. (RR23: 81-82). On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court\n\n                                         64\n\fshould have granted his challenge on that basis and on the ground that\n\nHarrington would automatically assess a death sentence if he found appellant\n\nguilty of capital murder. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 47-48).\n\n      Because the second ground was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for\n\nappellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant fails to\n\ndemonstrate that Harrington should have been excused for cause on either\n\nground argued on appeal.\n\n                                    Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant contends that Harrington’s questionnaire responses and his\n\ntestimony show that he would not consider evidence of genetics, background,\n\nenvironment, intoxication, or expert mental health testimony in answering the\n\nmitigation special issue. In actuality, Harrington’s testimony shows that he would\n\nconsider such evidence, but that he did not regard it as mitigating. (RR23: 46, 77-\n\n78). Harrington he had no duty to treat such evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59\n\nS.W.3d at 181. He was only obligated to consider any evidence presented in\n\ndetermining his answer to the mitigation special issue. Harrington’s testimony\n\nreflects that he could fulfill that duty.\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\f      He stated that he would listen to the evidence and decide whether it was\n\nsufficiently mitigating. He agreed that the needed to wait and listen because “you\n\nnever know what you’ll hear.” He also stated that his opinion about intoxication\n\nand background evidence in particular would not prevent him from given it\n\nconsideration. (RR23: 77-78). Thus, the court properly denied this challenge.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends Harrington’s questionnaire responses reflect that he\n\nwould automatically assess a death sentence if he found appellant guilty.\n\nHarrington’s testimony reflects otherwise.\n\n      Harrington stated that although he strongly favors the death penalty, he\n\nwould not automatically assess it if he found appellant guilty. (RR23: 27, 38-39).\n\nHe agreed to wait and consider any evidence that would be offered on the special\n\nissues. (RR23: 38-39). He understood that the State had the burden of proof on\n\nthe first issue and that he would hold the State to that burden. (RR23: 42-44). He\n\nacknowledged that he would set the bar very high on the mitigation issue, but he\n\nalso stated that he wanted to hear evidence on the issue and that he would wait\n\nand consider it before assessing any sentence “because you never know.” (RR23:\n\n46-48).\n\n                                        66\n\f       Appellant attacks the veracity of Harrington’s testimony. He argues that\n\n“Harrington was being more truthful when answering the questionnaire than\n\nwhen being examined” and that he “obviously wished to be on the jury and had\n\nbeen instructed by the State as to arrive there.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 47). The\n\ntotality of Harrington’s testimony showed he was an intelligent man with a firm\n\ngrasp of the law and a commitment to following it. Furthermore, Harrington\n\nexplained that he was in a hurry when he filled out the questionnaire because he\n\nhad to pick someone up from the airport. (RR23: 73-75). The court could have\n\nreasonably concluded that Harrington was rushed in his answers and took less\n\ncare than if he had not been in such a hurry. Regardless, the trial court disagreed\n\nwith   appellant’s   characterization   of   Harrington’s   testimony    and   that\n\ndetermination is entitled to deference. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n       Harrington was qualified to sit on appellant’s jury. This Court should\n\noverrule Issue 7.\n\n                           Issue 8: Anthony Morrison\n\n       Appellant exercised his eighth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nAnthony Morrison. (RR24: 88). At trial, appellant objected that Morrison equated\n\na death sentence with a guilty verdict on capital murder or murder and would not\n\n                                        67\n\fconsider certain types of mitigating evidence in answering the second special\n\nissue. (RR24: 78-79). On appeal, appellant contends the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge on both of these grounds. (Appellant’s Brief, p.\n\n49-52). The record supports the court’s ruling.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n       Appellant argues Morrison’s feelings about the death penalty were so\n\nstrong that he would assess it as soon as the State proved appellant guilty of\n\ncapital murder. In support, appellant cites Morrison’s questionnaire responses\n\nand a portion of his testimony during defense counsel’s examination. (Appellant’s\n\nBrief, p. 52).\n\n       Morrison did not dispute that he strongly favored the death penalty, but he\n\nalso stated that he was open to a sentence of life without parole. (RR24: 17-18,\n\n29, 64-65). Then he repeatedly stated that even though he thought someone\n\nconvicted of capital murder should get the death penalty, he would not let that\n\nfeeling determine the punishment he assessed. Rather, he would apply the\n\nevidence to the law and let it determine his answers to the special issues and,\n\nconsequently, the sentence. (RR24: 58-59, 61-62, 71, 73-74). The totality of\n\n\n\n                                        68\n\fMorrison’s testimony shows that he would not assess an automatic death\n\nsentence, and the court properly overruled this challenge.\n\n                                 Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Morrison was unable to give meaningful\n\nconsideration to mitigation evidence that he intended to rely on. To the contrary,\n\nthe record reflects that Morrison would consider appellant’s evidence of\n\nbackground, environment, etc. Throughout his testimony, Morrison told both\n\nsides and the court the same thing. He felt that a person’s background and\n\nupbringing do not excuse criminal behavior. Yet he would set aside those personal\n\nfeelings and consider such evidence in answering the second special issue. (RR24:\n\n41-42, 73-74, 84-85). At most, Morrison’s testimony shows that he might not\n\nregard appellant’s evidence of background, environment, etc. as mitigating. This\n\ndid not render him challengeable because Morrison had no duty to treat any\n\nparticular evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181.\n\n      Morrison was qualified to sit on appellant’s jury. This Court should overrule\n\nIssue 8.\n\n\n\n\n                                        69\n\f                            Issue 9: Enriquez Martinez\n\n      Appellant exercised his ninth peremptory challenge against venireperson\n\nEnriquez Martinez. (RR25: 205). At trial, appellant objected that Martinez would\n\nautomatically assess a death sentence and that he would not give adequate and\n\nproper consideration to appellant’s mitigation evidence. (RR25: 202). On appeal,\n\nappellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on\n\nboth these grounds and should also have excused Martinez because he would\n\nhave required appellant to testify.\n\n      Because the third ground was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for\n\nappellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant fails to\n\ndemonstrate that Martinez should have been excused for cause on any of the\n\nthree grounds argued on appeal.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant argues that Martinez’s questionnaire responses show that he\n\nwould automatically assess a death sentence if he found appellant guilty of capital\n\nmurder. Martinez’s responses showed that he strongly favored the death penalty;\n\nthey did not show that he would automatically assess it. (Martinez\n\nQuestionnaire). Moreover, as appellant pointed out in his trial objection,\n\n                                        70\n\fMartinez’s testimony demonstrates that he understood and would follow the law\n\nin determining appellant’s punishment. He repeatedly and emphatically\n\ndifferentiated between his feelings and the law and insisted that his feelings\n\nwould not prevent him from following the law. He thought the special issues\n\n“process” was fair and preferable to jurors simply voting life or death. He would\n\napply the evidence to the special issues and let that determine the punishment.\n\n(RR26: 160, 169-70, 172-76, 182, 191). He was not death prone and the court\n\nproperly denied this challenge.\n\n                                  Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Martinez would not give adequate consideration to\n\nhis mitigation evidence because he did not think a defendant’s background,\n\nintoxication, or mental health excused their crime. Martinez’s testimony shows\n\nthat he would listen to any evidence appellant presented on the second special\n\nissue, including background, intoxication, etc., but he would not regard it as\n\nmitigating. This did not disqualify him from service because Martinez had no duty\n\nto treat any particular evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. The\n\ncourt properly denied this challenge as well.\n\n\n\n                                        71\n\f                                 Failure to Testify\n\n      Finally, appellant argues that Martinez would require appellant to testify in\n\nviolation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Martinez denied\n\nthis. Martinez said that he would be looking for signs of remorse or regret if a\n\ndefendant did testify, but that he understood and respected the Fifth\n\nAmendment right and that a defendant’s decision not to testify would not affect\n\nhis verdict. (RR26: 162, 182-84). Thus, any challenge that Martinez was biased\n\nagainst Fifth Amendment law would have been properly denied.\n\n      Martinez was qualified to sit on appellant’s jury. This Court should overrule\n\nIssue 9.\n\n                              Issue 10: Paul Zugelder\n\n      Appellant exercised his tenth peremptory strike against venireperson Paul\n\nZugelder. (RR27: 226). At trial, appellant argued that Zugelder should be excused\n\nbecause the court and the prosecutor left him with the impression that defense\n\ncounsel was misstating the law. On appeal, appellant reasserts this ground and\n\nclaims the court abused its discretion in denying the challenge. (Appellant’s Brief,\n\np. 59). Apparently, it is appellant’s contention that the alleged misimpression\n\n\n\n                                        72\n\fbiased Zugelder against the defendant. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16\n\n(a)(9). The record reflects no such bias.\n\n      Initially, defense counsel did make a misstatement of law. The\n\nmisstatement arose during defense counsel’s discussion of the concept of\n\n“mercy” and its relevance to mitigation special issue. When he first explained the\n\nlaw to Zugelder, defense counsel stated, “*T+he law specifically tells us, that a\n\njuror’s concept of mercy, a juror’s concept of mercy alone based on anything they\n\nhave heard in the case is sufficient, if they believe it’s sufficient.” (RR27: 196-97).\n\nThe prosecutor objected to this misstatement. Mercy could not be based on\n\nanything heard during trial; it had to be based on evidence. Defense counsel\n\nagreed and clarified his prior statement, and then the court sustained the\n\nobjection. (RR27: 197).\n\n      When defense counsel continued his explanation, the prosecutor objected\n\nagain to him omitting the phrase “based on the evidence.” Defense counsel\n\ncorrectly noted that he had not omitted that phrase and then finished his\n\nexplanation of the law. The prosecutor disagreed with defense counsel, but the\n\ncourt remained silent. (RR27: 198-99).\n\n\n\n                                            73\n\f      At this point, Zugelder interrupted and informed the court that he was\n\nconfused about whether the law permitted him to disregard the mitigation\n\nspecial issue and assess life out of mercy. (RR27: 199). Thus, although defense\n\ncounsel had not misstated the law, he had left a false impression with the juror.\n\nThe court dispelled Zulgelder’s confusion, explaining that he could answer the\n\nmitigation issue affirmatively based on mercy if that decision was based on some\n\nevidence at trial. (RR27: 199-01). Defense counsel and Zugelder continued to\n\ndiscuss the issue and, eventually, defense counsel acknowledged, “Maybe I didn’t\n\nexplain that too well to you the first time . . .” (RR27: 202-04).\n\n      In short, defense counsel did misstate the law initially and he did leave a\n\nfalse impression with Zugelder. Thus, if Zugelder had reacted negatively to\n\ndefense counsel’s miscommunications, that would have been counsel’s fault.\n\nZugelder did not react negatively, however. He remained communicative and\n\nengaged throughout the entirety of defense counsel’s questioning. He remarked\n\non counsel’s candor and, in return, was himself candid. He did not express anger\n\nor even frustration. By all appearances, he was emotionally unaffected by the\n\nexchange and was concerned only with understanding the law and answering\n\n\n\n                                          74\n\fquestions honestly. (RR27: 196-207). The trial court reasonably concluded the\n\nsame and properly denied this challenge.\n\n      Zugelder was qualified to sit on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 10.\n\n                             Issue 11: David Hornstein\n\n      Appellant      exercised   his   eleventh   peremptory   challenge   against\n\nvenireperson David Hornstein. (RR28: 116). At trial, appellant objected that\n\nHornstein would not give consideration to appellant’s mitigation evidence at\n\npunishment. Specifically, he would not consider appellant’s character and\n\nbackground, mental health, or voluntary intoxication. (RR28: 114-15). On appeal,\n\nappellant claims the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on\n\nthis ground. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 60-61).\n\n      Hornstein’s testimony shows that he would listen to any evidence appellant\n\npresented on the second special issue, including background, intoxication, and\n\nmental health evidence, but that he might not regard it as mitigating. (RR28: 53-\n\n54, 61-63, 67, 95-112). This did not disqualify him from service because Hornstein\n\nhad no duty to treat any particular evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at\n\n181. The court properly denied this challenge.\n\n                                          75\n\f      Hornstein was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 11.\n\n                             Issue 12: Andrea Griffith\n\n      Appellant exercised his twelfth peremptory challenge against venireperson\n\nAndrea Griffith. (RR30: 84). At trial, appellant objected that Griffith would not\n\nconsider his mitigation evidence at punishment. Specifically, she would not\n\nconsider   genetics,   background,     upbringing,   environment,     or   voluntary\n\nintoxication. (RR30: 82-83). On appeal, appellant claims the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge on this ground. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 60-61).\n\n      Griffith’s testimony shows that she would listen to any evidence appellant\n\npresented on the second special issue, but that she might not regard it as\n\nmitigating. (RR30: 58-59, 65, 70-76). This did not disqualify her from service\n\nbecause she had no duty to treat any particular evidence as mitigating. Standefer,\n\n59 S.W.3d at 181. The court properly denied this challenge.\n\n      Griffith was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\f                         Issue 13: Bradford McCutheon\n\n      Appellant exercised his thirteenth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nBradford McCutheon. (RR31: 112). At trial, appellant objected that McCutheon\n\nwould not be able to give fair and accurate consideration to the special issues.\n\n(RR31: 111). On appeal, appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in\n\ndenying this challenge. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 64-65). The record supports the\n\ncourt’s ruling.\n\n      Appellant argues that McCutheon’s questionnaire and testimony show that\n\nhe would automatically assess a death sentence if he found appellant guilty of\n\ncapital murder. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 65). Although McCutheon’s responses\n\nshowed that he strongly favored the death penalty, they also showed that he\n\nwould not automatically assess it. Throughout his testimony, McCutheon\n\nrepeatedly and expressly stated that he would not automatically answer the\n\nspecial issues “yes” and “no” just because he found someone guilty of capital\n\nmurder. He also denied that he would let his feelings rather than the law control\n\nhis answers to the issues. He stated that he would follow the law, keep an open\n\nmind to any evidence presented, and let the evidence determine his answers.\n\n(RR31: 35, 46-48, 51, 53, 57, 59-60, 82-84,87-89, 102-03). He thought that the\n\n                                        77\n\fprocess of answering the special issues made sense and was better than jurors\n\nsimply voting for a life or death sentence. (RR31: 61, 75-76). He was not death\n\nprone and the court properly denied this challenge.\n\n      McCutheon was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 13.\n\n                               Issue 14: Elvira Corpus\n\n      Appellant exercised his fourteenth peremptory against venireperson Elvira\n\nCorpus. (RR3: 70). At trial, appellant objected that Corpus would automatically\n\nassess a death sentence if she found him guilty of capital murder and that she\n\nwould not consider his mitigating evidence. (RR33: 68-69). On appeal, appellant\n\nargues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on both\n\nthese grounds. He also argues that the court should have excused Corpus because\n\nshe would not fairly assess the credibility of police officers. (Appellant’s Brief, pp.\n\n66-68).\n\n      Because the third ground was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for\n\nappellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant fails to\n\ndemonstrate that Corpus should have been excused for cause on any of the three\n\ngrounds argued on appeal.\n\n                                          78\n\f                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant argues that Corpus’s questionnaire responses and testimony\n\nboth show that she would automatically assess a death sentence if she found\n\nappellant guilty of capital murder. In particular, he cites responses in her\n\nquestionnaire that show she strongly supports the death penalty. He also cites\n\ntwo excerpts from her testimony in which she appears to be saying that she\n\nwould automatically answer the mitigation issue “no.” (Corpus Questionnaire, pp.\n\n2, 5-6; RR33: 55-56).\n\n      Corpus’s questionnaire showed that she strongly favored the death\n\npenalty, but it also showed that she did not think it was appropriate in every case.\n\n(Corpus Questionnaire, p. 1). Nowhere in her questionnaire did she state that she\n\nthought a death sentence should be automatically assessed. (Corpus\n\nQuestionnaire).\n\n      The two testimonial excerpts appellant cites show only that Corpus was\n\nconfused by and misunderstood defense counsel’s questions at one point. The\n\nprosecutor objected to the nature of defense counsel’s questions several times\n\nduring these excerpts, and Corpus expressed her confusion. (RR33: 58-59). Both\n\nbefore and after those two exchanges, Corpus consistently maintained that she\n\n                                        79\n\fwould not automatically answer either issue, that she would wait and listen to the\n\nevidence, and that she would keep an open mind. (RR33: 22, 25, 27-30, 34-35, 40-\n\n41, 49-50, 60-66). To the extent Corpus made any statements that reflected\n\notherwise, the conflict was the court’s to resolve, and it resolved it against\n\nappellant. That determination was proper and is entitled to deference. Threadgill,\n\n146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n                                  Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Corpus would not give adequate consideration to his\n\nmitigation evidence because she did not think evidence of background,\n\nintoxication, or mental health excused crime. Corpus’s testimony shows that she\n\nwould listen to any evidence appellant presented on the second special issue, but\n\nshe might not regard it as mitigating. (RR33: 63-66). This did not disqualify her\n\nfrom jury service because Corpus had no duty to treat any particular evidence as\n\nmitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. The court properly denied this challenge\n\nas well.\n\n                              Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant contends Corpus was biased because she thought “police officers\n\nwere more likely to tell the truth.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 67). Corpus did make that\n\n                                         80\n\fstatement in her questionnaire. (Corpus Questionnaire, p. 5). But at trial, Corpus\n\nagreed that all witnesses start out on equal footing and that she would wait and\n\nlisten to an officer’s testimony before determining his credibility. (RR33: 38-39).\n\nThus, Corpus held no bias against the law governing police officer testimony, and\n\nthe court properly overruled this challenge.\n\n      Corpus was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 14.\n\n                             Issue 15: Temple Koestner\n\n      Appellant exercised his fifteenth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nTemple Koestner. (RR33: 157). At trial, appellant objected that Koestner would\n\nautomatically equate a guilty verdict with a death sentence and that she would\n\nnot consider his mitigation evidence. (RR33: 154-55). On appeal, appellant argues\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on both these\n\ngrounds. He also argues that the court should have excused Koestner because she\n\nwould not fairly assess the credibility of police officers and because she would\n\ndisregard the court’s instructions. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 66-68).\n\n      Because these two additional grounds were not raised at trial, they are not\n\npreserved for appellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant\n\n                                          81\n\ffails to demonstrate that Koestner should have been excused for cause on any of\n\nthe four grounds argued on appeal.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends Koestner’s questionnaire responses show that she was\n\nprone to vote for death if she found him guilty of capital murder. (Appellant’s\n\nBrief, pp. 70-71). In actuality, her questionnaire shows only that she strongly\n\nfavored the death penalty and that she thought it was an appropriate punishment\n\nin some murder cases, not all. She considered the death penalty and life without\n\nparole equally severe sentences. (Koestner Questionnaire, pp. 1, 3).\n\n      Koestner’s testimony also shows that she was not predisposed to assess a\n\ndeath sentence. She confirmed her opinion that a life sentence was as severe as\n\nthe death penalty. She repeatedly stated that she would not automatically assess\n\na death sentence if she found him guilty. She said her feelings favoring the death\n\npenalty would not prevent her from following the law. She would keep an open\n\nmind to the evidence presented, and she would wait and apply the evidence to\n\nthe special issues. (RR33: 87, 92, 99, 108, 116-17, 132-37, 148-49). At one point\n\nduring questioning by defense counsel, Koestner became confused about\n\nwhether counsel was asking her about her feelings or her ability to follow the law\n\n                                        82\n\fin assessing punishment. (RR33: 142-46). To the extent Koestner’s answers during\n\nthat exchange created any conflict in her testimony, that conflict was the court’s\n\nto resolve and it resolved it against appellant. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\nGiven the totality of Koestner’s testimony, that decision was reasonable and\n\nproper.\n\n                                 Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Koestner would not give adequate consideration to\n\nhis mitigation evidence because on her questionnaire, she stated that she did not\n\nthink evidence of genetics, environment, upbringing, and background should be\n\nconsidered when determining punishment. (Koestner Questionnaire, p. 6). At\n\ntrial, however, Koestner testified that she would set aside those feelings and\n\nconsider the evidence in determining her answers to the special issues. (RR33:\n\n149-52). At most, her testimony and questionnaire showed that she might not\n\nregard such evidence as mitigating. This did not disqualify her from jury service\n\nbecause Koestner had no duty to treat any particular evidence as mitigating.\n\nStandefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. The court properly denied this challenge as well.\n\n\n\n\n                                        83\n\f                              Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant contends Koestner was biased because in her questionnaire she\n\nagreed that “police officers were more likely to tell the truth.” (Appellant’s Brief,\n\np. 71). In addition to that statement, Koestner added, “With cameras in the cars\n\nnow the officers have to tell the truth. The cameras don’t lie.” (Koestner\n\nQuestionnaire, p. 5). But at trial, Koestner agreed that all witnesses start out on\n\nequal footing and that she would wait and listen to each witness’s testimony\n\nbefore determining his credibility. (RR33: 118-19). Thus, Koestner held no bias\n\nagainst the law governing police officer testimony, and the court properly\n\noverruled this challenge.\n\n                            Following Court’s Instructions\n\n      Appellant contends Koestner’s response to question 41 in her\n\nquestionnaire shows that she would not follow the court’s instructions on the\n\nlaw. In question 41, Koestner agreed with the statement, “Regardless of what a\n\njudge says the law is, jurors should do what they believe is the right thing.” She\n\nalso added, “The jury must do as instructed, but can give the judge what they\n\nbelieve is right.” (Koestner Questionnaire, p. 7).\n\n\n\n                                          84\n\f      No one questioned Koestner about this statement during her testimony or\n\nexplained the law to her. Without first explaining to her that the law required\n\njurors to follow the court’s instructions, Koestner could not be deemed biased\n\nagainst the law. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667. Moreover, the totality of\n\nKoestner’s testimony shows that she understood and considered herself duty\n\nbound to follow the law if selected for the jury. Thus, if appellant had challenged\n\nKoestner on this basis at trial, denial of that challenge would have been proper.\n\n      Koestner was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and the Court should\n\noverruled Issue 15.\n\n                              Issue 16: Nancy Munn\n\n      Appellant exercised his sixteenth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nNancy Munn. (RR36: 176-77). At trial, appellant objected that Munn was “death\n\nprone,” would not hold the State to its burden of proof regarding a “technicality,”\n\nand would presume police officers were more credible. (RR36: 170-74). On\n\nappeal, appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\nforegoing challenges. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 75-78). The record reflects otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                        85\n\f                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends Munn so strongly favored the death penalty that she\n\nwould automatically answer the future dangerousness special issue affirmatively\n\nif she found him guilty of capital murder. He claims she would also automatically\n\nanswer the second special issue “no” if she found him to be a future danger.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 74-78).\n\n      Although Munn’s questionnaire and testimony both show her strong\n\nsupport for the death penalty, her testimony shows that her feelings would not\n\naffect her ability to follow the law and assess a sentence based on the law and the\n\nevidence. Munn stated that she believed there could be some cases where life\n\nwithout parole would be an appropriate sentence. (RR36: 112). She also stated\n\nthat she believed some people could be rehabilitated. (RR36: 113). During\n\nquestioning by both sides, she repeatedly stated that she would not automatically\n\nanswer either special issue, that she thought the special issues were fair, and that\n\nshe would consider any evidence offered in determining her answers to the\n\nissues. She also stated that she believed there could be evidence that would\n\nconvince her appellant deserved a life sentence. (RR36: 117, 129-30, 134-35, 143-\n\n44, 150-62).\n\n                                        86\n\f      Appellant argues that some of Munn’s answers were equivocal,\n\ndemonstrating an uncertainty about her ability to follow the law. Any\n\nequivocation in Munn’s answers was for the trial court to resolve, and it was\n\nresolved against appellant. That determination is entitled to deference and is\n\nsupported by the totality of Munn’s testimony. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n                               State’s Burden of Proof\n\n      Appellant argues that Munn could not hold the State to its burden of proof\n\non the issue of guilt because she would have difficulty acquitting someone based\n\non the State’s failure to prove a “technicality,” such as venue in Dallas County.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, p. 77). Munn’s testimony reflects, however, that she\n\nunderstood the State’s burden and her duty if the State failed to meet it. (RR36: ).\n\nWhen presented with the scenario of the State failing to prove venue, Munn\n\nstated, “It would have to be that he was innocent because it had to be in Dallas\n\nCounty.” (RR36: 124). During defense questioning, Munn expressed some distress\n\nat being put in the position of acquitting in that scenario. Still, she stated that she\n\nbelieved she could follow the law and acquit. (RR36: 145-47). The court properly\n\nfound no bias on this basis.\n\n\n\n                                          87\n\f                              Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant argues that Munn would give police officers more credibility than\n\nother witnesses. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 76). The record reflects the opposite. In her\n\nquestionnaire, Munn stated that she believed police officers are more likely to tell\n\nthe truth than the average person. But she also wrote, “I think they are people so\n\nthey make mistakes, however & also I think that suit gives some people a\n\nperceived power.” (Munn Questionnaire, p. 5). Furthermore, during her\n\ntestimony, Munn stated that she would treat all witnesses the same, that she did\n\nnot believe everyone tells the truth all of the time, and that police officers are\n\nhuman. She also stated that she would not automatically find an officer credible,\n\nbut would wait and listen to their testimony to judge their credibility. (RR36: 162-\n\n63). The court properly concluded that Munn held no bias in favor of a police\n\nofficer’s testimony.\n\n      Munn was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 16.\n\n                               Issue 17: Ernest Hand\n\n      Appellant requested additional strike to eliminate venireperson Ernest\n\nHand. The trial court denied the request, having already given appellant two\n\n                                         88\n\fadditional strikes.3 (RR39: 90-91). At trial, appellant objected that Hand was\n\n“death prone.” (RR39: 89-90). On appeal, appellant contends the trial court\n\nabused its discretion in denying this challenge. He also argues that the court\n\nshould have excused Hand because he would not fairly assess the credibility of\n\npolice officers and would not consider appellant’s mitigation evidence.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 80-81). Because the two additional grounds were not raised\n\nat trial, they are not preserved for appellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\nNevertheless, appellant fails to demonstrate that Hand should have been excused\n\nfor cause on any of the three grounds argued on appeal.\n\n                                       “Death Prone”\n\n       Appellant argues that Hand was “death prone” because he strongly favored\n\nthe death penalty. In support of this contention, appellant cites Hand’s\n\nquestionnaire in which he stated that he thought the death penalty was used to\n\nseldom and that it took too long to administer. Also, he stated that he thought\n\nthe justice system was too lenient, slow, and inconsistent. (Appellant’s Brief, p.\n\n80).\n\n\n3\n  Appellant exercised his second extra strike (strike 17) against venireperson Robin Schwartz\n(RR37: 85). He challenged Schwartz for cause at trial, but does not complain about the denial of\nthat challenge on appeal. (RR37: 81-83).\n                                              89\n\f      Although Hand did strongly support the death penalty, his questionnaire\n\nreflects that he did not think it should be applied in all murder cases.\n\nFurthermore, during his testimony, Hand stated that he believed some murderers\n\ndeserve a life sentence. He also testified that he would not automatically assess a\n\ndeath sentence. He would wait and listen to the evidence and apply it to the\n\nspecial issues. (RR39: 27, 32, 37, 43-46, 64-65, 75-78, 83). The trial court properly\n\ndenied this challenge.\n\n                               Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant argues that Hand was biased toward police officers. (Appellant’s\n\nBrief, p. 80). In support of this argument, appellant cites Hand’s questionnaire in\n\nwhich he stated that he agreed police officers were more likely to tell the truth\n\nthan the average person. According to Hand, “They are more accountable.” (Hand\n\nQuestionnaire, p. 5).\n\n      On their own, Hand’s statements in his questionnaire do not evince a bias\n\nin favor of officers. His statements reflect only that he expects officers to be\n\ntruthful, not that he will automatically find them more credible. Furthermore,\n\nHand testified that he understood he must treat all witnesses, including officers,\n\nalike, and wait until they testified to assess their credibility. (RR39: 44-46). Thus, if\n\n                                           90\n\fappellant had challenged Hand on this basis at trial, denial of that challenge\n\nwould have been proper.\n\n                                 Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Hand would not give adequate consideration to his\n\nmitigation evidence because on her questionnaire, he stated that he did not think\n\nevidence of genetics, environment, upbringing, and background should be\n\nconsidered when determining punishment. In addition, he wrote that “there is no\n\ncircumstance that gives a person the right to murder except in personal danger.”\n\n(Hand Questionnaire, p. 6).\n\n      At trial, Hand testified that he would listen to any evidence presented on\n\nthe special issues. (RR39: 43, 64-65, 75). At most, Hand’s questionnaire showed\n\nthat he might not regard evidence of background, environment, etc. as mitigating.\n\nThis did not disqualify him from jury service. Hand had no duty to treat any\n\nparticular evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. Thus, if appellant\n\nhad challenged Hand on this basis at trial, denial of that challenge would have\n\nbeen proper as well.\n\n      Hand was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 17.\n\n                                       91\n\f                           Issue 18: Elizabeth McDaniel\n\n      Appellant challenged McDaniel on the basis that she was death prone and\n\nwould automatically assess a death sentence if she found the appellant guilty of\n\ncapital murder. Appellant argued that he did not believe she would give adequate\n\nconsideration to special issue number one. He also argued that, with regard to\n\nspecial issue number two, she would require him to testify and show remorse in\n\nviolation of his Fifth Amendment rights. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 81-83).\n\n      Nothing in McDaniel’s questionnaire or testimony supports appellant’s\n\ncontentions. McDaniel’s questionnaire showed that she strongly favored the\n\ndeath penalty, but it also showed that she did not think it was appropriate in\n\nevery case. (McDaniel Questionnaire, p. 1). Nowhere in her questionnaire did she\n\nstate that she thought a death sentence should be automatically assessed.\n\n(McDaniel Questionnaire). Throughout her testimony, McDaniel repeatedly\n\naffirmed that she would not automatically vote for death if she found appellant\n\nguilty and that she would wait and consider the evidence presented at\n\npunishment in answering the special issues. (RR39: 134, 142-43, 156-58, 163,\n\n165). She affirmed her understanding of special issue number one and that the\n\njury could not answer that issue “yes” unless the State met its burden of proof.\n\n                                         92\n\f(RR39: 134-38, 160-62). She affirmed that if she heard sufficiently mitigating\n\nevidence she could assess a life sentence. (RR39: 141). She stated her\n\nunderstanding that a defendant does not have testify and confirmed that she\n\nwould follow the court’s instruction not to consider a defendant’s failure to testify\n\nfor any purpose during her deliberation. (RR39: 144, 166).\n\n      McDaniel was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule\n\nIssue 18.\n\n                             Issue 19: Arleen Jimenez\n\n      Appellant challenged Jimenez on the basis that she would automatically\n\nassess the death penalty if she found the defendant guilty of capital murder. He\n\nalso challenged her on the basis that she viewed the death penalty as a deterrent\n\nand was not used enough. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 83-85).\n\n      Jimenez’s questionnaire shows only that she strongly favored the death\n\npenalty and that she thought it was an appropriate punishment in some murder\n\ncases, not all. She considered the death penalty and life without parole equally\n\nsevere sentences. (Jimenez Questionnaire, pp. 1-2). Further, Jimenez’s testimony\n\nshows that she was not predisposed to assess a death sentence. Jimenez stated\n\nthat she could follow the law and not automatically give someone a death\n\n                                         93\n\fsentence just because they have been found guilty. (RR40: 39-40, 48, 56, 60). She\n\naffirmed that she would keep an open mind and wait to hear all the evidence\n\nbefore she answered special issues. (RR40: 42, 48, 57-60, 62, 71-72). Appellant\n\nfails to demonstrate that Jimenez had a bias against him or the law in any way.\n\n      Jimenez was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule\n\nIssue 19.\n\n                                Issue 20: Dan Blanks\n\n      In his final issue, appellant complains that the trial court improperly denied\n\nhis challenge for cause against Dan Blanks. However, Mr. Blanks was the alternate\n\nand did not participate in jury deliberations. As such, appellant cannot show he\n\nwas harmed by the trial court’s ruling on his challenge for cause against Blanks.\n\n      In any event, appellant’s claims are without merit. Appellant challenged\n\nBlanks on the basis that he equated the death penalty with a guilty verdict. On\n\nappeal, appellant also argues that Blanks thought police officers were more likely\n\nto tell the truth that the average person. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 84-85). Because\n\nthis additional ground was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for appellate\n\nreview. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.\n\n\n\n                                        94\n\f      Blanks’ questionnaire showed that he strongly favored the death penalty,\n\nbut it also showed that he did not think it was appropriate in every case. (Blanks\n\nQuestionnaire, p. 1). Nowhere in his questionnaire did he state that he thought a\n\ndeath sentence should be automatically assessed. (Blanks Questionnaire). During\n\nhis testimony, Blanks affirmed that he would not automatically vote for death if\n\nhe found appellant guilty and that he would wait and consider all the evidence\n\nbefore making any decision on how to answer the special issues. (RR41: 36-37, 48-\n\n49, 53, 59-60, 64). He also affirmed that he would judge the credibility of the\n\nwitness based on their testimony, not before he or she testifies. (RR41: 38-39). As\n\nsuch, Blanks was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n20.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has not shown even one erroneous ruling on his challenges for\n\ncause, much less three erroneous rulings. Therefore, he has not shown this Court\n\nthat he was denied the use of a statutorily provided peremptory strike. Issues 1\n\nthrough 20 should be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                        95\n\f        Issues 21 and 22: Constitutional Right To Fair And Impartial Jury\n\n      In Issues 21 and 22, appellant contends the trial court’s denial of his\n\nchallenges for cause deprived him of a lawfully constituted jury resulting in\n\nviolations of his rights under the state and federal constitutions and under article\n\n35.16 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 88-89).\n\n      Appellant’s contentions are meritless. He has failed to show the trial court’s\n\nrulings on any of the challenges resulted in the seating of a juror who was biased\n\nor prejudiced. If an appellant does not present record evidence demonstrating\n\nthat the trial court’s error deprived him of a jury comprised of legally qualified\n\njurors, he has suffered no harm and the reviewing court should presume the\n\njurors are qualified. See Gray v. State, 233 S.W.3d 295, 301 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007).\n\nTherefore, this Court should overrule Issues 21 and 22.\n\n                Issues 23-26: Admission Of Autopsy Photographs\n\n      In Issues 23 through 26, appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his Rule 403 objections to State’s Exhibits 4-9, 11-23 and 77-78,\n\nautopsy photographs of the victims. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 90-97). He does not\n\naddress the photographs individually, but generally contends they were excessive.\n\nHe also complains they were unfairly prejudicial because there were no\n\n                                        96\n\fcontroverted issues as to cause of death. His contentions are without merit and\n\nshould be overruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The admissibility of a photograph is within the sound discretion of the trial\n\njudge. Paredes v. State, 129 S.W.3d 530, 539 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004); Williams v.\n\nState, 958 S.W.2d 186, 195 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997). Generally, a photograph is\n\nadmissible if verbal testimony about the subject of the photographs is also\n\nadmissible. Id.; Gallo v. State, 239 S.W.3d 757, 762 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (holding\n\nthat, if verbal testimony is relevant, photographs of the same are also relevant).\n\nMore specifically, a visual image of the injuries appellant inflicted on the victim is\n\nevidence that is relevant to the jury’s determination and is admissible. Gallo, 239\n\nS.W.3d at 762; Tex. R. Evid. 401. The fact that the jury also heard testimony\n\nregarding the injuries depicted does not reduce the relevance of the visual\n\ndepiction. Id.\n\n      Rule 403, on the other hand, allows for the exclusion of otherwise relevant\n\nevidence when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of\n\nunfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by\n\nconsiderations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\n\n                                         97\n\fSee Tex. R. Evid. 403. Rule 403 favors the admission of relevant evidence and\n\npresumes that relevant evidence will be more probative than prejudicial.\n\nWilliams, 958 S.W.2d at 196. A court may consider several factors in determining\n\nwhether the probative value of photographs is substantially outweighed by the\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice, including but not limited to: the number of exhibits\n\noffered, their gruesomeness, their detail, their size, whether they are black and\n\nwhite or color, whether they are close-up, and whether the body depicted is\n\nnaked or clothed. Id. A reviewing court must also consider the availability of other\n\nmeans of proof and the circumstances unique to each individual case. Id.\n\n        Issues 23 and 24: The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion by\n       Overruling Appellant’s Objections to State’s Exhibits 4-9 and 11-23\n\n      In a pretrial hearing held outside the presence of the jury, appellant\n\nrequested that the trial court make a threshold determination of the admissibility\n\nof autopsy photographs of the victims. (RR42: 28-30). He argued that because the\n\ndefense was conceding guilt and there was no issue with regard to the cause of\n\ndeath of the victims, no autopsy photographs should be admitted because they\n\nhave no probative value and are only being offered to inflame the jury. (RR42: 28-\n\n34). The State notified the trial court that it was in possession of over 170\n\nphotographs, some of them quite graphic, but that they had met with the medical\n                                     98\n\fexaminer and selected only the ones necessary to aid her in explaining the injuries\n\nsustained by the children. (RR42: 30, 34, 39). The trial court examined the thirteen\n\nphotographs of Elijah Muhammad and six photographs of Naim Muhammad that\n\nthe State planned to offer. (RR42: 34-38; State’s Exhibits 4-9, 11-23). The trial\n\ncourt found the probative value the photographs outweighed the prejudicial\n\neffect and overruled appellant’s objections. (RR42: 36-38).\n\n      All of the photographs admitted were in color and were 8 ½ by 11 inches.\n\nState’s Exhibits 11-23 are autopsy photographs of Elijah. Exhibits 11 and 12 depict\n\nhow Elijah appeared when he arrived at the medical examiner’s office and the\n\nclothes he was wearing. Additionally, Dr. Dyer used exhibit 11 to explain the\n\nprocess of postmortem purging, and exhibit 12 to explain their standard practice\n\nfor collecting fingernail clippings. (RR42: 122-23; State’s Exhibits 11-12). She\n\nexplained that after the “as-is” photographs are taken of the victim, the body is\n\ncleaned up for the autopsy and re-photographed, which is what is depicted in\n\nexhibit 13. (RR42: 124; State’s Exhibit 13).\n\n      Dr. Dyer used exhibits 14-21 to describe the various injuries she observed\n\nduring the external examination of Elijah. Although Elijah is not clothed, all of the\n\nphotographs are close-ups of specific parts of his body. The photographs are not\n\n                                          99\n\frepetitious and each depicts a different area of injury. Specifically, exhibits 14 and\n\n15 depict the facial injuries he sustained; exhibit 16 depicts a linear abrasion on\n\nhis back; exhibit 17 depicts abrasions on the outside of the leg; exhibit 18 depicts\n\nabrasions and a blister on the sole of his left foot; exhibit 19 depicts abrasions on\n\nthe top of the right foot; exhibit 20 depicts abrasions on the back side of his right\n\nleg; and exhibit 21 depicts an abrasion on his wrist. (RR42: 124-26; State’s Exhibits\n\n14-21). Dr. Dyer used exhibits 22 and 23 to describe the injuries she observed\n\nduring the internal examination of Elijah. Exhibit 22 depicts the bruising on the\n\ninside of his scalp and exhibit 23 depicts the dirt and debris that were found in his\n\nairway. (RR42: 126-28; State’s Exhibits 22-23).\n\n      State’s Exhibits 4-9, autopsy photographs of Naim, were used in the same\n\nmanner as the photographs of Elijah contained in State’s Exhibits 11-23. State’s\n\nExhibit 4 is the “as-is” photograph of Naim – it depicts the clothes he was wearing\n\nand how he presented when he arrived at the medical examiner’s office. (RR42:\n\n135; State’s Exhibit 4). It also depicts white foam coming from his nose, the result\n\nof postmortem purging. (RR42: 134-36; State’s Exhibit 4). Exhibit 5 shows how\n\nNaim appeared after the debris was removed and he was cleaned by the medical\n\nexaminer. (RR42: 136; State’s Exhibit 5). Exhibits 6-8 are close-ups of specific parts\n\n                                         100\n\fof Naim’s body, each depicting a different area of injury observed during the\n\nexternal examination. Specifically, exhibits 6 and 7 depict abrasions on the side of\n\nthe face and forehead, and exhibit 8 depicts abrasions on the back of hand.\n\n(RR42: 136-37; State’s Exhibits 6-8). Exhibit 9, taken during the internal\n\nexamination, depicts the bruising he sustained on the inside of his scalp. (RR42:\n\n137-38; State’s Exhibit 9).\n\n      The medical examiner was entitled to testify to the manner of death, the\n\ncause of death, and the number and types of injuries sustained by each victim,\n\nissues to which these photographs were relevant. The fact that appellant did not\n\ncontest the manner of death does not render the photos irrelevant. See Long v.\n\nState, 823 S.W.2d 259, 274, 275 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991) (holding that testimony\n\nand photographs as to manner, cause, and time of death are relevant to capital\n\nmurder prosecution even though defendant pled guilty).\n\n      Mindful of the potential for unfair prejudice, the State took great care to\n\nreduce the number of autopsy photographs and utilized only the ones necessary\n\nfor Dr. Dyer’s testimony. Furthermore, in the realm of capital murder victim\n\nphotos, the pictures are nothing close to gruesome. See, e.g., Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at\n\n763-64 (upholding admission of twenty-three photographs of 3 year-old victim\n\n                                        101\n\fincluding photographs of vaginal injuries, internal injuries including close-ups of\n\ncracked ribs, a picture in which the rib had been removed from the body, various\n\nviews of the underside of the victim’s scalp and the victim’s skull, and one picture\n\nof the victim’s brain). Sixteen of the nineteen photos admitted in this case are\n\npre-autopsy and show only external abrasions inflicted during the offense. And\n\nwhile exhibits 9, 22 and 23 are slightly more graphic, the photographs show\n\nbruising or other damage that is attributable to appellant’s actions but is not\n\nvisible externally, thereby making the photographs highly relevant to the manner\n\nof death. See Ripkowski v. State, 61 S.W.3d 378, 392-93 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001).\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative\n\nvalue of these photographs was not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice.\n\nAccordingly, Issues 23 and 24 are without merit and should be overruled.\n\n        Issues 25 and 26: The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion by\n         Overruling Appellant’s Objections to State’s Exhibits 77 and 78\n\n      At a hearing outside the presence of the jury, appellant made a Rule 403\n\nobjection to State’s Exhibits 77 and 78, autopsy identification photographs of the\n\nchildren. (RR43: 133). Appellant argued that, in light of their concession of guilt,\n\nthere was no probative value in admitting the photographs and they were only\n\nbeing offered to provoke a visceral response from the mother on the witness\n                                     102\n\fstand. (RR43: 133-35). The State argued that, despite any conciliatory statements\n\nmade by appellant during voir dire and the guilt phase, he did not plead guilty and\n\nthey are still required to prove the identity of the decedents beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. (RR43: 135). The trial court examined the two photographs and overruled\n\nappellant’s objection. (RR43: 136-41).\n\n      State’s Exhibit 77 is an autopsy identification photo of Elijah. He is shown\n\nunclothed from the chest up, lying on a table. The medical examiner’s placard\n\nshowing autopsy identification number IFS-11-12022 is placed across his chest.\n\n(State’s Exhibit 77). State’s Exhibit 78 is an autopsy identification photo of Naim.\n\nHe is also shown unclothed from the chest up, lying on a table, and a placard with\n\nautopsy identification number IFS-11-12023 is across his chest. (State’s Exhibit\n\n78). At the conclusion of the direct examination of Kametra, the State showed her\n\nexhibits 77 and 78. (RR43: 141). Kametra identified the individual in exhibit 77 as\n\nElijah and the individual in exhibit 78 as Naim. (RR43: 141). There was no outburst\n\nor visceral response by Kametra when she viewed the photographs. (RR43: 141).\n\n      Kametra’s identification of the individuals in State’s Exhibits 77 and 78\n\nlinked Dr. Dyer’s autopsy reports to the named victims. (RR43: 141-42; State’s\n\nExhibits 10, 24, 77-78). As such, they were highly relevant. These exhibits are not\n\n                                         103\n\fparticularly gruesome or detailed, are not enhanced in any way, and portray no\n\nmore than the condition of the victims due to the injuries inflicted by appellant.\n\nAs such, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the probative\n\nvalue of the photographs outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice. See, e.g.,\n\nYoung v. State, 283 S.W.3d 854, 875 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in determining that an autopsy identification photograph\n\nused to tie the victim to his assigned case number was relevant and that its\n\nprobative value outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice).\n\n      Issues 25 and 26 are without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                        Issues 27 and 41: Jury Argument\n\n      In Issues 27 and 41, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying\n\nhis objections to the State’s closing argument during both the guilt-innocence and\n\npunishment phases of trial. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 97-99, 124-25). His contentions\n\nare without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                 Applicable Law\n\n      The purpose of closing argument is to facilitate the jury’s proper analysis of\n\nthe evidence presented at trial so that it may arrive at a just and reasonable\n\nconclusion based on the evidence alone and not on any fact not admitted into\n\n                                       104\n\fevidence. Campbell v. State, 610 S.W.2d 754, 756 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.]\n\n1980). Proper jury argument generally falls within one of four areas: (1)\n\nsummation of the evidence, (2) reasonable deduction from the evidence, (3)\n\nanswer to an argument of opposing counsel, and (4) plea for law enforcement.\n\nFreeman v. State, 340 S.W.3d 717, 727 (Tex. Crim. App. 2011). Counsel is\n\ngenerally afforded wide latitude in drawing inferences from the record, as long as\n\nthe inferences are reasonable and offered in good faith. Coble v. State, 871\n\nS.W.2d 192, 205 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (en banc).\n\n      Even when an argument exceeds the permissible bounds of these approved\n\nareas, such will not constitute reversible error unless, in light of the record as a\n\nwhole, the argument is extreme or manifestly improper, violative of a mandatory\n\nstatute, or injects new facts harmful to the accused into the trial proceeding.\n\nWesbrook v. State, 29 S.W.3d 103, 115 (Tex. Crim. App. 2000). The remarks must\n\nhave been a willful and calculated effort on the part of the State to deprive\n\nappellant of a fair and impartial trial. Id. An instruction to disregard, which the\n\njury is presumed to follow, will generally cure the improper argument. Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                        105\n\f                      Closing Argument at Guilt-Innocence\n\n      In Issue 27, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the State arguing outside the scope of the guilt-innocence stage of\n\ntrial. The complained-of argument went as follows:\n\n      MS. SWEET: He told you what he did. He took those two little boys\n      down to the nasty, smelly overgrown creek, and he carried one\n      down, and the other one he was holding a hand. The little boy was\n      reaching out and grabbing Daddy’s shirt. Did they know what Daddy\n      was going to do? They did because they were crying, Daddy, Daddy,\n      we love you. We love you, Daddy. They knew they were going to die.\n      He had already told them. What did he tell them? Your mama don't\n      want us anymore. Your mama doesn’t want us. That’s what he told\n      them. What better way to get back at her than to kill those two kids?\n      That’s why he did it. He did it to get back at her. He did it to make\n      sure that no other man would ever show them any real love, so no\n      other man would be a real father like he never was.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Excuse me, Judge. I’m going on object to this\n      argument, the entirety of this argument. It is outside the scope of the\n      guilt/innocence issue before this jury, and I would ask the Court to\n      instruct the prosecutor to limit her remarks to the evidence that goes\n      to the proof or denial of whether or not the Defendant committed\n      the offense.\n\n      THE COURT: Ms. Sweet, just argue the evidence and the law. Thank\n      you.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: And, Judge, I’m going to ask that the instruction be\n      limited further to argue the evidence and the law as it applies to\n      whether or not the Defendant committed the offense.\n\n      THE COURT: I have already instructed the prosecutor. Argue the\n                                   106\n\f      evidence and the law. Proceed, Ms. Sweet.\n\n      MS. SWEET: Y’all can remember the evidence that you heard\n      yesterday, Monday. He took those kids down there and he knew\n      what he was going do, and he told them to sit down. What did he tell\n      them? Put your head down in the water and act like you are\n      swimming. And that’s when he took his hands and he put them on\n      each kid and he held their head under the water. Can you imagine\n      what that must have felt like? What were those kids thinking?\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Judge, again, I'm going to object again. This entire\n      argument is now outside the scope of guilt/innocence and we're\n      going to object to it at this phase of the trial.\n\n      THE COURT: I will overrule the objection.\n\n      MS. SWEET: That's how he killed them, in a dirty, nasty creek. That's\n      where their life ended. It's the first day of school for Naim, but it was\n      the last day of his life. So these two little precious boys, two little\n      precious innocent babies, they were crying for their mother. That\n      was in evidence. They were crying for mom. They are crying for mom\n      to help them. And this is how they end up. This is his handiwork right\n      here. That is how they ended up. That's what he did to them. That's\n      how much they meant to him and then he left them there like\n      garbage.\n\n(RR44: 25-28).\n\n      Appellant’s complaint was not preserved and is not properly briefed\n\n      To preserve a complaint regarding improper jury argument for appellate\n\nreview, a party must make a timely request, objection, or motion with sufficient\n\nspecificity to apprise the trial court of the complaint. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a);\n\n                                        107\n\fEstrada v. State, 313 S.W.3d 274, 303 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). Trial counsel failed\n\nto explain how the argument fell outside the scope of the guilt-innocence portion\n\nof the trial, nor is it apparent from the face of the argument. Consequently, trial\n\ncounsel’s objection lacked sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of\n\nthe exact nature of his complaint, and therefore, has failed to preserve this issue\n\nfor review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) .\n\n      Additionally, appellant has failed to adequately brief this issue on appeal.\n\nAppellant claims that the prosecutor’s remarks concerning what the victims felt\n\nwhen their heads were held under water was improper because it was outside of\n\nthe scope of guilt-innocence because it injected facts not in the record, was\n\n“maudlin” and “in poor taste,” and its only purpose was to begin to create\n\nprejudice toward appellant. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 98-99). However, appellant\n\nfails to cite any case law that supports his assertion that the prosecutor’s\n\nargument was improper. Rule 38.1 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure\n\nrequires that a brief contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions\n\nmade with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 38.1(i). Because appellant has wholly failed to make a clear argument and cite\n\n\n\n                                            108\n\fappropriate authorities, his argument is inadequately briefed and should be\n\nsummarily denied.\n\n          The trial court did not err by overruling appellant’s objection\n\n      Should this Court consider this issue, despite counsel’s failure to properly\n\npreserve and brief the issue, the record reflects that the trial court properly\n\noverruled appellant’s objection. The complained-of argument fell within the\n\npermissible areas of argument because the remarks were a proper summation\n\nand called for reasonable deductions from the evidence presented at trial.\n\n      The evidence presented at trial indicated that appellant abducted Kametra,\n\nNaim, and Elijah as the three of them walked to Naim’s school. As appellant then\n\ndrove them through the neighborhood, he threatened Kametra and the boys.\n\nWhen appellant stopped at a red light, Kametra saw a constable parked nearby\n\nand jumped out of the car, to get the constable’s help. Appellant, who had\n\nwarned Kametra not to jump out of the car, sped off with Naim and Elijah. Elijah,\n\nwho was in the backseat of the car with Naim, began to cry and ask for his\n\nmother. Appellant told both boys that she did not love them. Appellant then\n\ndrove to a secluded creek. Because Elijah did not have shoes on, he carried Elijah\n\ndown to the creek bed, while Naim walked beside them, holding on to appellant’s\n\n                                       109\n\fshirt. Next, appellant forced them to sit down in the water with their backs to\n\nhim. Both boys were crying; Elijah asking for his mother and Naim telling\n\nappellant that he loved him. Appellant then forced both boys to place their heads\n\nunder the water, telling them to pretend like they were swimming, and held their\n\nheads under the water until both boys stopped moving.\n\n      Accordingly, the prosecutor’s remarks merely asked the jury to use their\n\nexperience and knowledge to deduce from the evidence the level of confusion\n\nand fear the boys felt as a result of the appellant’s actions. Such argument was\n\npermissible and appropriate. See Palermo v. State, 992 S.W.2d 691, 696 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.) (stating prosecutor may ask jurors to\n\nimagine what a victim experienced during a crime as long as the argument is\n\nbased on the evidence and reasonable deductions from the evidence, rather than\n\nsheer conjecture); see also, e.g., Torres v. State, 92 S.W.3d 911, 920-22 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston *14th Dist.+ 2002, pet. ref’d) (finding prosecutor’s argument\n\nstating “I want you to close your eyes and think of how that young man felt”\n\nasked the jury to make reasonable deductions from the evidence regarding the\n\ndegree of terror and pain experienced by the complainant shortly before his\n\ndeath and was permissible); Linder v. State, 828 S.W.2d 290, 303 (Tex. App.—\n\n                                      110\n\fHouston [1st Dist.] 1992, pet. ref’d) (determining prosecutor’s argument asking\n\n“Can you imagine what it was like to be that woman?” asking jurors to imagine\n\nwhat a victim of a burglary and attempted sexual assault to imagine what it was\n\nlike to be the victim was a legitimate appeal to the jury to apply their general\n\nknowledge and experience to the evidence presented at trial). Consequently, the\n\ntrial court did not err in overruling appellant’s objection to this argument.\n\n                             Error, if any, was harmless\n\n      Nevertheless, even if this Court were to find that the State’s argument was\n\nimproper, any error was harmless.\n\n      Improper argument is non-constitutional error, and non-constitutional\n\nerror that does not affect a defendant’s substantial rights must be disregarded.\n\nBrown v. State, 270 S.W.3d 564, 572 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.2(b). To determine whether an appellant’s substantial rights were affected, an\n\nappellate court balances three factors: (1) the severity of the misconduct (i.e., the\n\nprejudicial effect), (2) any curative measures, and (3) the certainty of conviction\n\nabsent the misconduct. See Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572-73. In evaluating the\n\nseverity of the misconduct, the reviewing court must assess whether the\n\nargument injected new and harmful facts or was, in light of the entire argument,\n\n                                         111\n\fextreme or manifestly unjust and willfully calculated to deprive appellant of a fair\n\nand impartial trial. Id. at 573.\n\n      Viewing the State’s closing argument as a whole, the record does not\n\ndemonstrate that there was a willful, calculated effort to deprive the appellant of\n\na fair and impartial trial. The argument made no reference to the punishment\n\nphase or special issues and did not inject new facts into the record. The\n\nprosecutor was simply asking the jury to apply their general knowledge and\n\nexperience to the evidence that was properly before them and imagine what was\n\ngoing through the minds of the victims during the murders. The details in the\n\nargument were summations and reasonable deductions from the evidence, most\n\nof which came from appellant’s statement to the police. While the trial court did\n\nnot take any curative measures, this was because the judge overruled the\n\nappellant’s objection. Finally, the evidence of appellant’s guilt was overwhelming.\n\nAppellant gave a voluntary statement to the police in which he confessed to the\n\nmurders. Appellant did not present any evidence during the guilt-innocence\n\nphase of the trial and, in fact, conceded guilt during his closing argument.\n\nFurthermore, witness testimony corroborated appellant’s confession, as did the\n\nforensic evidence establishing the cause of death of both victims. Based on the\n\n                                        112\n\fevidence presented, the jury most certainly would have convicted appellant\n\nregardless of the prosecutor’s statements. Thus, any error in the prosecutor’s\n\nargument did not affect appellant’s substantial rights. See Brown, 270 S.W.3d at\n\n572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Issue 27 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                          Closing Argument at Punishment\n\n      In Issue 41, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the State’s closing argument during the punishment phase of trial.\n\n      During closing argument at the punishment phase, defense counsel made\n\nthe following argument:\n\n      MR. JOHSNON: The evidence in this case from Kametra, this history\n      of domestic violence, folks, all I can tell you is that, by all accounts,\n      we’ve got a situation where now Kametra comes in and I agree with\n      what was said earlier, she hates the Defendant for what he did, and\n      reasonably so. And unlike what she told us when I met with her and\n      my consultants, now the violence has escalated, it is more of it.\n\n      You know, that’s what happens in courtrooms, folks. What we really\n      know is that about the time when Rasool is locked up for that\n      incident with his sister, we know that she is running around on him,\n      and she is writing him letters, and then we know that then while he is\n      still incarcerated, she gets caught for leaving her kids locked up in a\n      car outside while she is off galavanting, and we know now that she\n      ran off and she is now this sophisticated prostitute. And think about\n      this, folks. And like I said, Kametra is not on trial. But they are\n      wanting you to think that she is only this victim because it fits well\n                                        113\n\f      into their theory, but she has told you, folks, that she is out there and\n      she is running around with a guy twice her age. She has got the\n      wherewithal to start running the internet prostitution scheme. She\n      said it is her idea. She has got a $3,000 a month drug habit. $3,000 a\n      month. And she tells you she had no way to get away from the\n      Defendant.\n\n(RR50: 72-73). In rebuttal, the State made the following complained-of argument:\n\n      MS. KEMP: Now, I asked Kametra. Do you know who Maya Angelou\n      is? You all know who she is, Poet Laureate. You know Maya Angelou\n      was raped when she was --\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Judge, I'm going to object. We're outside the record.\n\n      MS. KEMP: This is argument.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: I know. We're still arguing the record.\n\n      MS. KEMP: Maya Angelou was raped when she was 8 years old.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Judge, I'm going to ask for a ruling on my objection.\n\n      THE COURT: I didn't hear an objection. Sorry.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: I objected. I said, we’re outside of the record.\n\n      THE COURT: Okay. I will overrule the objection.\n\n      MS. KEMP: Maya Angelou had a child when she was 17 years old.\n      Maya Angelou was a full-grown madam, running a brothel.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Judge, I'm going to ask for an opportunity to reopen\n      my argument and start talking about things than there is no evidence\n      also, if we're going to allow this.\n\n                                        114\n\f      THE COURT: All right.\n\n      MS. KEMP: Kametra --\n\n      THE COURT: That’s denied. Go ahead.\n\n      MS. KEMP: Kametra --\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: I'm going to object to the argument that’s continued\n      to admission of evidence not before this jury.\n\n      THE COURT: This is argument.\n\n      MS. KEMP: This is argument, sir.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: I understand, Judge. She can’t argue the life history of\n      people.\n\n      THE COURT: Argue the evidence and the law.\n\n      MS. KEMP: This is evidence. You have a young lady who was raped\n      when she was 8. She had a child when she was 17. She decided to be\n      a prostitute rather than be with Mr. Muhammad, to provide for her\n      kids. One way or another, he is no longer in her life, and like Maya\n      Angelo, she can go on and be anything she wants to, if she decides.\n\n(RR50: 84-86).\n\n      On appeal, appellant argues that the remarks about Maya Angelou’s life\n\nhistory were outside of the record and therefore, impermissible. Appellant\n\ncontends that the statements were calculated to inflame the minds of the jury\n\n\n\n                                         115\n\fand prejudice the appellant such that the jury would be certain to return a verdict\n\nof death.\n\n            The trial court did not err by overruling appellant’s objection\n\n      The record reflects that the trial court properly overruled appellant’s\n\nobjection because the argument was made in response to the argument of\n\ndefense counsel and also constituted a summation and reasonable deduction\n\nfrom the evidence.\n\n      During his closing argument, defense counsel attacked the credibility and\n\ncharacter of State’s witness Kametra Sampson, stating that the instances of\n\ndomestic violence she testified to had “escalated” from those that she had\n\ndescribed to defense counsel in a previous meeting. Counsel described Kametra\n\nas a “sophisticated prostitute” running an “internet prostitution scheme” with a\n\n$3,000 a month drug habit, and that she was only being presented as a victim\n\nbecause it fit the State’s theory. (RR50: 72-73). The State’s argument challenged\n\nthis characterization of Kametra by comparing her to another reputable and well-\n\nknown woman with a similar background. The State’s comparison was based on\n\nKametra’s testimony and reasonable deductions from that testimony.\n\n\n\n                                         116\n\f      The testimony presented at trial revealed that Kametra was raped by her\n\nmother’s boyfriend when she was eight years old. She began a sexual relationship\n\nwith the appellant when she was just fifteen and appellant was twenty-five.\n\nKametra had her first child when she was seventeen and had two more children in\n\nthe next few years. Kametra testified that she endured violent beatings at the\n\nhands of the appellant throughout their relationship, and eventually resorted to\n\nprostitution in order to provide for herself and her children so that she did not\n\nhave to remain in an abusive relationship with the appellant. Kametra also\n\nadmitted to an expensive drug habit. However, she also testified that she was no\n\nlonger a prostitute and had sought treatment for her drug addiction in order to\n\nimprove her life.\n\n      Accordingly, the prosecutor appropriately analogized Kametra’s life to\n\nMaya Angelou. It was a reasonable deduction from the evidence that Kametra,\n\nlike Angelou, could change her life. While appellant is correct that there was no\n\nevidence before the jury specifically concerning Maya Angelou’s life, Angelou is a\n\npublic figure whose life history is common knowledge. Arguing facts that\n\nare common knowledge is an exception to the prohibition against arguing facts\n\noutside the record. See Nenno v. State, 970 S.W.2d 549, 559 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n                                       117\n\f1998), overruled on other grounds by State v. Terrazas, 4 S.W.3d 720 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1999); Carter v. State, 614 S.W.2d 821, 823 (Tex. Crim. App. [Panel Op.]\n\n1981). Therefore, the trial court did not err in overruling appellant’s objection.\n\n                            Error, if any, was harmless\n\n      Even if this Court were to find that the State’s argument was improper, any\n\nerror was harmless. As previously noted, improper jury argument is non-\n\nconstitutional error that must be disregarded unless it affects the defendant’s\n\nsubstantial rights. Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Viewing the State's closing argument as a whole, it cannot be concluded\n\nthat there was a willful and calculated effort to deprive appellant of a fair and\n\nimpartial trial. The prosecutor’s remarks were made in response to defense\n\ncounsel’s argument and were summations and reasonable deductions from the\n\nevidence. It is clear that the prosecutor did not have an improper motive. While\n\nthe trial court did not take any curative measures, the prosecutor’s reference to\n\nAngelou was brief and only a small portion of the entire argument.\n\n      Furthermore, the evidence supporting the jury’s answer to the special\n\nissues was overwhelming. In addition to the evidence showing the calculated and\n\ndeliberate nature of the heinous double-murder for which the jury had just found\n\n                                        118\n\fappellant guilty, the State also presented considerable evidence during the\n\npunishment phase showing appellant’s extensive juvenile record, his inability to\n\nfollow instructions or rules while confined as a juvenile or while awaiting trial for\n\ncapital murder, and his acts of violence against women. Accordingly, this Court\n\ncan be assured that the jury would have returned the same answer to the special\n\nissues absent the prosecutor’s comment. Thus, any error in the prosecutor’s\n\nargument did not affect appellant’s substantial rights. See Brown, 270 S.W.3d at\n\n572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Issue 41 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n          Issue 28: Admission of Appellant’s Statements to CPS Worker\n\n      In Issue 28, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the testimony of CPS worker Pamela Womack. According to\n\nappellant, it was improper for Womack to testify regarding statements made to\n\nher by appellant while he was in custody where the State failed to show that he\n\nwas given the proper Miranda warnings. (Appellant’s Brief, 99-102).\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      Womack serves as a Special Investigator for CPS, where she assists primary\n\ncase workers with their interviews and investigations. (RR46: 118-19). Womack\n\n                                        119\n\finterviewed appellant and assisted in interviews with other members of\n\nappellant’s family. (RR46: 119-20). Womack explained that she does these\n\ninterviews as part of the development of a social history for the primary case\n\nworker’s file. (RR46: 120-21). CPS was conducting an investigation in this instance\n\nbecause they were trying to determine the placement of appellant’s and\n\nKametra’s remaining child, Jeremiah. (RR46: 121).\n\n      Appellant objected to Womack testifying to any statements made by\n\nappellant during the interview unless the State could establish he was given\n\nMiranda warnings. (RR46: 122, 124-25). When taken on voir dire by defense\n\ncounsel, Womack made it clear that she did not speak with anyone in law\n\nenforcement prior to her interview of appellant and that her interview was\n\nconducted for CPS, not law enforcement. (RR46: 122-24). In response to\n\nappellant’s objection and argument, the State reiterated that the purpose of the\n\nCPS investigation in this case was to determine what to do with Jeremiah. (RR46:\n\n125). The trial court overruled appellant’s objection. (RR46: 125).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      A trial court’s decision to admit testimony of a CPS worker is reviewed for\n\nan abuse of discretion and must be affirmed so long as the decision is within the\n\n                                        120\n\fzone of reasonable disagreement. See Berry v. State, 233 S.W.3d 847, 856 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007); Wilkerson v. State, 173 S.W.3d 521, 524 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).\n\n      The Fifth Amendment provides that no person “shall be compelled in any\n\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself . . .” U.S. CONST. amend. V. As a\n\ncorollary to that provision, in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), the United\n\nStates Supreme Court held that the State may not use any statements stemming\n\nfrom custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of\n\nprocedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\n\nId. at 444.\n\n      The procedural safeguards of Miranda, however, do not apply to all\n\ncustodial questioning. They generally apply only to custodial interrogation by law\n\nenforcement officers or their agents. Wilkerson, 173 S.W.3d at 527. Although a\n\nCPS worker is an employee of the state, state employment does not, by itself,\n\nmake a person a state agent for purposes of defining custodial interrogation. Id.\n\nat 528. As the Wilkerson court explained:\n\n      Although state employment clearly makes a person an “agent of the\n      State,” that label does not, by itself, make the person an “agent of\n      the State” for the purpose of defining “custodial interrogation.” Not\n      all government workers must be familiar with and ready to\n      administer Miranda warnings . . . . *W+hen “the official has not been\n\n                                       121\n\f      given police powers, Miranda has been held inapplicable to\n      questioning by *state officials+.”\n\nId. at 528. The court further observed that different types of state employees\n\nserve different roles. Id. CPS workers are charged with protecting the welfare and\n\nsafety of children in the community while the police are responsible for\n\ninvestigating crime. See id. Therefore, police officers and CPS workers generally\n\nrun on separate, yet parallel paths. Id. at 529. CPS’s role may be converted if its\n\nparallel path converges with police, and the organizations are investigating a\n\ncriminal offense in tandem. Id.\n\n      To determine whether the two paths have converged, courts must examine\n\nthe entire record. Id. at 530. The thrust of the inquiry is whether the custodial\n\ninterview was conducted explicitly or implicitly on behalf of the police for the\n\npurpose of gathering evidence or statements to be used in a later criminal\n\nproceeding against the interviewee. Id. at 531. The defendant bears the burden of\n\nproving that a particular person is working in tandem with police in a joint\n\ninvestigation, primarily because the law does not presume such a relationship. Id.\n\nat 529-30, 32.\n\n\n\n\n                                       122\n\f                  Womack’s Testimony Was Properly Admitted\n\n      Appellant has failed to meet that burden in this case. Womack’s testimony\n\nunequivocally showed that she did not interview appellant at the behest of law\n\nenforcement. She was not gathering information to be used in a later criminal\n\nproceeding. Rather, her primary purpose in interviewing appellant was to\n\ndetermine the future care of the surviving child. (RR46: 120-21, 125, 130-31).\n\nRegardless of the outcome of appellant’s criminal case, it is not surprising that\n\nthat CPS would need to collect data to determine the best interests of the child\n\nfollowing the tragedy. See Wilkerson, 173 S.W.3d at 530. Having that limited\n\npurpose does not somehow magically connect Womack with the police\n\ninvestigation of appellant’s case.\n\n      Womack was not an agent of law enforcement who was required to comply\n\nwith Miranda. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nappellant’s objection to Womack’s testimony. See, e.g, Berry, 233 S.W.3d at 856\n\n(trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony of CPS worker;\n\nbecause the CPS worker’s purpose in interviewing Berry was to find placement for\n\nBerry’s children, she was not an agent of the law enforcement who was required\n\nto comply with Miranda).\n\n                                       123\n\f                               Any Error Harmless\n\n      Even if the court should have excluded Womack’s testimony, the admission\n\nof this evidence did not violate appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.2(b). The statements made by appellant to Womack did not shed new light on\n\nthe offense or appellant’s feelings about his childhood or his relationship with\n\nKametra. Appellant generally denied having a bad childhood or any mental health\n\nissues; and while he disclosed Kametra’s previous drug-usage and prostitution, he\n\ndid not claim she was an unfit mother or otherwise speak badly about her. Same\n\nor similar testimony regarding appellant’s perception of his childhood, mental\n\nhealth, and feelings toward Kametra was admitted without objection through\n\nother witnesses. Moreover, counsel used cross-examination of Womack to show\n\nthat appellant became quite emotional on multiple occasions during the interview\n\nwhen describing what had happened with the kids and the things that had gone\n\non in his life. Thus, any error in the admission of this testimony was harmless.\n\nIssue 28 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                    Issue 29: Admission of State’s Exhibit 173\n\n      In Issue 29, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to State’s Exhibit 173, certified business records pertaining to\n\n                                        124\n\fappellant’s prior conviction for evading arrest in cause number MB97-57574-K.\n\nAppellant contends that because the judgment did not contain an identifying\n\nfingerprint, the conviction was not properly tied to appellant and should not have\n\nbeen admitted. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 102-04).\n\n                                     Pertinent Facts\n\n       On July 30, 1997, appellant committed two offenses as part of a continuous\n\ncriminal episode: burglary of a motor vehicle and evading arrest. He was charged\n\nwith these offenses in cause numbers MA97-57573-K and MB97-57574-K. On\n\nSeptember 19, 1997, appellant pleaded guilty to both offenses and was sentenced\n\nto 120 days confinement, probated for twelve months in each case. (State’s\n\nExhibits 172-73). Subsequently, his community supervision was revoked and he\n\nwas sentenced to 120 days’ confinement in each case.4 (State’s Exhibit 173).\n\n       During the punishment phase of trial, the State offered exhibits 172 and\n\n173, certified copies of the judgments and other business records pertaining to\n\n\n\n\n4\n The State’s electronic records reflect that appellant’s community supervision was revoked in\nboth cases on March 31, 1998. The State received a certified copy of the Judgment Revoking\nCommunity Supervision from the county clerk in the burglary case (State’s Exhibit 172);\nhowever, the State did not receive a certified copy of the Judgment Revoking Community\nSupervision from the county clerk in the evading arrest case for an unknown reason. (State’s\nExhibits 173).\n                                            125\n\fthese convictions. (RR44: 106-07, 109; State’s Exhibits 172-73). Exhibit 172\n\ncontained a fingerprint which was matched to the fingerprint of appellant taken\n\nthat day. (RR44: 100-01, 103-04; State’s Exhibits 169, 172). Exhibit 173 contained\n\nno fingerprint for comparison. (RR44: 100-01, 103, 106). The State presented\n\ntestimony that exhibits 172 and 173 pertained to offenses with consecutive cause\n\nnumbers, contained matching identifying information of appellant, and reflected\n\nthat appellant pleaded guilty and was adjudicated guilty of these offenses on the\n\nsame day. (RR44: 106). Appellant did not object to exhibit 172. (RR44: 106). He\n\nobjected to exhibit 173 on the basis that there was lack of a predicate and failure\n\nto establish correlation between the exhibit and the appellant. (RR44: 106).\n\nAppellant’s objection was overruled. (RR44:106).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      To establish a defendant’s prior criminal conviction, the State must prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt the following: (1) that a prior conviction exists, and (2)\n\nthat the defendant is linked to that conviction. See Flowers v. State, 220 S.W.3d\n\n919, 921 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). Texas law does not require that the prior\n\nconviction be proven in any specific manner. Id. at 922. Any type of evidence,\n\ndocumentary or testimonial, might suffice. Id.\n\n                                        126\n\f      Often the proof that is adduced to show the defendant on trial is one and\n\nthe same person that is named in the prior criminal conviction “closely resembles\n\na jigsaw puzzle” where the pieces standing alone usually have little meaning but,\n\nwhen fitted together, form the picture of the person who committed the prior\n\nconviction. Id. at 923 (citing Human v. State, 749 S.W.2d 832, 835-36 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1988). The trier of fact fits the pieces together and weighs the credibility of\n\neach piece. Id. It looks at the totality of the evidence admitted to determine if\n\nthere was a prior conviction and if the defendant was the person convicted. Id.\n\n        The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion by Admitting State’s\n                                  Exhibit 173\n\n      State’s Exhibit 173, when considered in conjunction with State’s Exhibit\n\n172, was sufficient to prove appellant’s 1997 conviction for evading arrest.\n\n      Exhibits 172 and 173 show that the offenses of burglary of a vehicle and\n\nevading arrest were committed on the same date, July 30, 1997. They were filed\n\nunder the same service number, 640854F, and same arrest number, 052103. They\n\ncontain the same identifying information for appellant, including his full name as\n\nNaim Muhammad; physical description of “BM;” birthdate of 05-03-79; address of\n\n3326 Kyser, Dallas, Texas 75216; and phone number of 214-374-0141. The\n\nsignature of “Naim Muhammad” contained on the court’s admonishments and\n                                 127\n\forder appointing counsel in each case is the same. Finally, the “Judgment on\n\nNegotiated Plea of Guilty or Nolo Contendere Before Judge Community\n\nSupervision Granted” in each case reflects that appellant pleaded guilty and was\n\nadjudicated of both offenses on the same date, September 19, 1997. (State’s\n\nExhibits 172-73). Viewing the totality of the evidence, the trier of fact could have\n\nreasonably determined that there was a prior conviction for evading arrest and\n\nthat appellant was the person convicted. See Flowers, 220 S.W.3d at 923.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling appellant’s\n\nobjection to State’s Exhibit 173.\n\n                                Any Error Harmless\n\n      Even if this Court were to find error in the trial court’s ruling, the admission\n\nof this evidence did not violate appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.2(b). Exhibit 173 was one of seven prior convictions, the rest of which were\n\nunquestionably proven by documentary and testimonial evidence. The State\n\nproved that appellant committed numerous extraneous unadjudicated offenses\n\nduring his twenty-year history of criminal activity. The State presented evidence\n\nof appellant’s repeated infractions while in Daytop, TYC and Dallas County Jail,\n\nand his violence toward women. The jury also had before it the heinous facts of\n\n                                        128\n\fthe capital murder. In viewing the entire record as a whole, it is highly unlikely\n\nthat the inclusion of exhibit 173 influenced the outcome of the trial. Accordingly,\n\nany error in the admission of this exhibit was harmless.\n\n      Issue 29 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n         Issues 30-32: Admission of Testimony from Refreshed Memory\n\n      In Issues 30-32, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling\n\nhis objections to the testimony of police officers who used police reports to\n\nrefresh their memory. He contends that State allowed its witnesses to testify from\n\ndocuments not in evidence under the guise of refreshing their recollection in\n\norder to get in evidence that was otherwise not admissible. (See App. BR. at 105-\n\n07). His contentions are wholly without merit.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      Texas evidentiary rules allow a witness in a criminal case to refresh his or\n\nher memory either while testifying or before testifying. Tex. R. Evid. 612. A police\n\nofficer may review written reports to refresh his or her memory, then testify from\n\na “refreshed memory.” McCoy v. State, 877 S.W.2d 844, 845 (Tex. App.—Eastland\n\n1994, no pet.). As long as the witness had personal knowledge at some time in the\n\npast and that memory has been refreshed by review of the writing, the testimony\n\n                                        129\n\fitself is received as substantive evidence. See Young v. State, 891 S.W.2d 945, 951\n\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1994). Further, a writing need not be prepared by the person\n\nwho is having their memory refreshed, but rather, the focus should be that the\n\nperson testifying has their own personal recollection refreshed. See id.\n\n                               Officer Chris Havens\n\n      According to appellant’s brief, the complaints raised in issues 30 and 31\n\npertain to the testimony of Officer Chris Havens. (See App. Br. at 105). However,\n\nthe portions of the record he cites pertain to the testimony of Officer Harold\n\nAndrews. To the extent that his record citation is a typographical error and his\n\nclaims do relate to the testimony of Chris Havens, the record shows they are\n\nwholly without merit.\n\n      Former Dallas Police Officer Chris Havens was the officer who arrested\n\nappellant following his burglary of the habitation of Ivis Wright. Wright sold candy\n\nto kids in her neighborhood. (RR44: 131). Prior to testifying, Officer Havens\n\nreviewed the police report and recalled the incident because of the candy that\n\nwas stolen during the burglary. (RR44: 125, 131). Officer Havens testified that he\n\nresponded to a call reporting a burglary on February 26, 1993. (RR44: 124-25).\n\nAfter a witness at the scene identified a group of juveniles nearby as the\n\n                                        130\n\fperpetrators of the burglary, Officer Havens and other officers pursued them in a\n\nfoot chase, eventually catching them and taking them into custody. (RR44: 125-\n\n26). When Officer Havens was asked whether he could identify the individual that\n\nhe arrested and booked-in on that date, he responded, “According to the arrest\n\nreport, yes, ma’am.” (RR44: 126). Appellant objected to Officer Havens testifying\n\nto details he did not have personal knowledge of. (RR44: 126-27). His objection\n\nwas overruled. (RR44: 126). The State rephrased its question and Officer Havens\n\ntestified that, based on his refreshed recollection from the police report, Naim\n\nRasool Muhammad was the individual he arrested and booked-in on that date.\n\n(RR44: 127).\n\n      Appellant did not object at trial on the basis that Officer Havens was\n\ntestifying from a record not in evidence and offering personal information after\n\nusing a document he did not prepare to refresh his memory. As such, his\n\ncomplaints have not been preserved for review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n      In any event, the record shows that Officer Havens did not testify from a\n\ndocument. Rather, he properly refreshed his memory using his report. Based on\n\nthis refreshed memory, he was able to recall that Naim Rasool Muhammad was\n\nthe individual he arrested and booked-in for burglary on the date in question. The\n\n                                       131\n\ftrial court did not err in allowing Officer Havens to testify from his refreshed\n\nmemory. See Young, 891 S.W.2d at 951.\n\n                             Officer Harold Andrews\n\n      To the extent that appellant’s record citations are correct and the\n\ncomplaints raised in issues 30 and 31 pertain to the cited testimony of Officer\n\nHarold Andrews, these contentions are also without merit.\n\n      Dallas Police Lieutenant Harold Andrews was the officer who detained\n\nappellant for burglary of a vehicle on July 27, 1994. (RR44: 140-41). Lt. Andrews\n\nwas driving around the area where the burglary occurred and spotted appellant,\n\nwho matched the description of one of the suspects. (RR44: 142). Lt. Andrews\n\ndetained appellant and brought him back to the scene of the burglary, where he\n\nwas identified by the complainant as one of the perpetrators. (RR44: 142-43). Lt.\n\nAndrews testified that it was standard procedure for him to gather personal\n\ninformation from appellant at the time he detained him. (RR44: 146, 148-49, 150-\n\n51). He relayed that information to another officer at the scene, who compiled\n\nthe information from all the officers involved and made a single report of the\n\nincident. (RR44: 142-43, 154).\n\n\n\n                                      132\n\f      Lt. Andrews reviewed this report prior to testifying to refresh his memory\n\nof the incident. (RR44: 141, 145). He was also asked to review this report during\n\nhis testimony to refresh his recollection of appellant’s full name and date of birth.\n\n(RR44: 144). Appellant objected to Lt. Andrews testifying from a report not in\n\nevidence and to him refreshing his memory from a document he did not prepare.\n\n(RR44: 144, 148-49, 151-52). The trial court overruled his objections and allowed\n\nLt. Andrews to refresh his memory. (RR44: 144-45). After refreshing his memory,\n\nLt. Andrews testified that the person he detained that day was named Naim\n\nMuhammad with a birthdate of May 3, 1979. (RR44: 152-53).\n\n      The record demonstrates that Lt. Andrews did not read from a document\n\nnot in evidence, as appellant claims. Rather, he properly used the police report to\n\nrefresh his memory of the incident. After refreshing his memory, Lt. Andrews\n\nstated appellant’s name and date of birth from memory. Lt. Andrews established\n\nhow he would have had personal knowledge of appellant’s identity by referencing\n\nto the standard procedures that he habitually follows. (RR44: 146, 148, 150). The\n\nfact that Lt. Andrews did not prepare the report in its entirety is irrelevant; what\n\nmatters is that his memory was, in fact, refreshed. See Young, 891 S.W.2d at 951.\n\n\n\n                                        133\n\fThe trial court properly overruled appellant’s objections and allowed Lt. Andrews\n\nto testify from his refreshed memory.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Issues 30 and 31 are without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n                           Officer Brandon Hernandez\n\n      In Issue 32, appellant complains about the testimony of Garland Police\n\nOfficer Brandon Hernandez. Officer Hernandez arrested appellant on July 4, 1999.\n\nOfficer Hernandez reviewed his report and refreshed his memory of the incident\n\nprior to testifying. (RR45: 61, 71). Officer Hernandez testified that he and his\n\npartner performed a felony stop of a vehicle that fled the scene of a burglary.\n\n(RR45: 60-65). There were three passengers in the vehicle, one of whom was\n\nappellant. (RR45: 67). The officers obtained the passengers’ identifying\n\ninformation and entered that information into the police computer to check for\n\noutstanding warrants. (RR45: 67). Although Officer Hernandez could not recall\n\noffhand whose information he obtained or which officer ran the information\n\nthrough the police system, he testified that they were able to confirm appellant’s\n\nidentity in their system and confirm that he had outstanding warrants. (RR45: 67-\n\n69). Appellant objected to this testimony on the basis that Officer Hernandez did\n\n                                        134\n\fnot have personal knowledge of the facts he was testifying to. (RR45: 69). The\n\nobjection was overruled. (RR45: 69).\n\n      The record reflects that Officer Hernandez was the author of the report and\n\ncollected the information found in the report documenting appellant’s arrest on\n\nJuly 4, 1999. He was there for the duration of the detention and arrest and\n\ncompiled information regarding all three suspects. The personal knowledge\n\nHernandez gained during the investigation was incorporated into his report,\n\nwhich Hernandez used to refresh his memory for testimony. See, e.g., McCoy, 877\n\nS.W.2d at 844. Officer Hernandez did not read from the report, but simply used\n\nthe report to refresh his memory of the incident. The trial court did not err in\n\nallowing him to testify from his refreshed memory. See Young, 891 S.W.2d at 951.\n\nIssue 32 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n             Issues 33 and 37: Testimony of Officer David Solomon\n\n      In Issues 33 and 37, appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his objection to the testimony of Officer David Solomon regarding an\n\narrest of appellant. He argues that allowing the officer to testify that appellant\n\nwas pulled over for suspicion of being involved in an attempted auto theft, when\n\n\n\n                                       135\n\fhe was later cleared of any involvement, was not relevant and highly prejudicial.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 108-10, 116-18).\n\n      Dallas Police Officer David Solomon arrested appellant on October 4, 1993.\n\n(RR45: 83, 87). Early that morning, the police pulled over a vehicle matching the\n\ndescription of a vehicle involved in an attempted auto theft. (RR45: 84-86, 126-\n\n27). There were multiple passengers in the vehicle, including appellant; the\n\nofficers obtained personal information from all the passengers. (RR45: 88, 127-\n\n28). The officers determined that appellant and the other passengers were not\n\ninvolved in the attempted auto theft. (RR45: 99, 103, 129-30). Appellant,\n\nhowever, was arrested for two outstanding warrants for burglary of a habitation.\n\n(RR45: 88-89, 128-30). One of those warrants was for the burglary of Ivis Wright,\n\nthe woman who sold candy in the neighborhood. (RR45: 97-98, 100).\n\n      Appellant objected to Officer Solomon being allowed to testify that\n\nappellant was pulled over because the vehicle was suspected of being involved in\n\nan attempted auto theft when the passengers were later cleared of any\n\ninvolvement in that offense. Appellant argued that the reason for the stop was\n\nirrelevant and prejudicial. (RR45: 100, 104-05, 124). The trial court ruled that\n\nOfficer Solomon could testify about how appellant came to be pulled over by\n\n                                           136\n\fpolice, so long as the State made clear that he was cleared of any involvement in\n\nthe attempted auto theft. (RR45: 100-01). The State complied with the Court’s\n\nruling. (RR45: 129). Counsel also elicited this information on cross-examination.\n\n(RR45: 130).\n\n      Relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the\n\nexistence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\n\nmore probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 401. Rule 403 favors the admission of relevant evidence and carries a\n\npresumption that relevant evidence will be more probative than prejudicial.\n\nWilliams, 958 S.W.2d at 196.\n\n      Officer Solomon’s testimony was not introduced for the purpose of proving\n\nany crime related to the attempted auto theft, but rather to show appellant’s\n\narrest for the burglary of Ms. Wright’s home. Although Ms. Wright had previously\n\ntestified about the circumstances of the burglary, she testified that she did not\n\nknow who had committed the offense. (RR44: 119-27). And while appellant was\n\nidentified as one of the suspected perpetrators by Officer Havens, there was no\n\nfurther evidence before the jury regarding any further disposition of the case.\n\nOfficer Solomon’s testimony demonstrated that appellant was charged and\n\n                                      137\n\farrested for that offense. Officer Solomon’s explanation for the stop was relevant\n\nto show how and why he came into contact with appellant on October 4, 1993,\n\nsince he had no involvement in the investigation of the burglary offense. Without\n\nthis explanation, his testimony regarding appellant’s arrest would be incomplete\n\nand confusing.\n\n      Furthermore, appellant cannot show harm. Officer Solomon made clear\n\nduring his testimony before the jury that appellant was cleared of any\n\ninvolvement in the attempted auto theft. (RR45: 129, 130).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\noverruling appellant’s objection to the testimony of Officer Solomon. Issue 33 is\n\nwithout merit and should be overruled.\n\n                 Issue 34: Testimony of Warden Melodye Nelson\n\n      In Issue 34, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to Warden Nelson’s anecdotal testimony about weapons produced in\n\nprison by other inmates. He claims that this evidence was not relevant and was\n\nprejudicial to him because he had no connection to the weapons presented.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 110-11).\n\n\n\n                                       138\n\f      Rule 702 of the Texas Rules of Evidence provides:\n\n      If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the\n      trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\n      issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,\n      experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of\n      an opinion or otherwise.\n\nTex. R. Evid. 702. The proponent of evidence under Rule 702 must show, by clear\n\nand convincing proof, that the evidence is sufficiently relevant and reliable to\n\nassist the jury in accurately understanding other evidence or in determining a fact\n\nin issue. See Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 765. A trial court’s decision to admit or exclude\n\nexpert testimony is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. Id.\n\n      Warden Nelson was qualified as an expert by virtue of her knowledge and\n\nexperience in the Texas prison system. Her testimony was relevant to helping the\n\njury determine Special Issue No. 1, whether appellant would commit criminal acts\n\nof violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. It is well settled\n\nthat “society” includes the prison population. See Estrada v. State, 313 S.W.3d\n\n274, 281 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). Warden Nelson’s testimony described for the\n\njury what appellant’s life would be like if he were sentenced to life in prison and\n\nhis society became prison society. Prison society is not something within a juror’s\n\ncommon knowledge. Warden Nelson testified regarding staffing, classification,\n\n                                        139\n\fhousing, daily routine, discipline and the potential for violence within Texas\n\nprisons. She did not specifically testify that appellant would be more or less likely\n\nto commit violent acts in prison, only that there is a potential for violence in all\n\nclassification levels of the prison system. Warden Nelson showed weapons that\n\nwere found and confiscated in prison over the years in an effort to illustrate her\n\ntestimony for the jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this\n\nevidence. See Threadgill v. State, 146 S.W.3d 654, 670-671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)\n\n(finding no abuse of discretion in trial court’s admission of photographs of\n\nweapons made in prison which were used by a prison expert to illustrate his\n\ntestimony regarding inmate violence within various classifications of prison\n\nsociety).\n\n      Even if the trial court erred in admitting Nelson’s testimony, any alleged\n\nerror was harmless. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). Warden Nelson’s testimony was\n\noffered by the State in rebuttal during the punishment phase. The jury had\n\nalready seen and heard evidence regarding the instant capital murder. The jury\n\nhad already heard about appellant’s lengthy history of criminal activity, his\n\nnumerous violations while on probation, his failure to obey orders while\n\nincarcerated, his anger issues, and his violence toward women, including his own\n\n                                         140\n\fsister. Furthermore, the prejudicial effect of Warden Nelson’s testimony was\n\nminimized by its general nature. It was neither graphic nor disturbing in content.\n\nThat fact, in conjunction with the admission of other more compelling\n\npunishment evidence by the State, rendered harmless any error in the admission\n\nof Warden Nelson’s testimony. Issue 34 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n        Issue 35: Denial of Hearing on Extraneous Offenses and Bad Acts\n\n      In Issue 35, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest to hold a hearing outside the presence of the jury on the admissibility of\n\nany extraneous offense evidence the State planned to offer during the\n\npunishment phase of trial. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 112-14).\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      Appellant filed a pretrial motion requesting that the trial court hold a\n\nhearing and make a threshold determination as to the admissibility of every\n\nextraneous offense or bad act the State planned to present during the\n\npunishment phase. (CR2: 273-78). Appellant’s motion also requested that (1) the\n\ntrial court give an oral instruction at the conclusion of the admission of each\n\nextraneous offense that it is not be considered unless proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and (2) a reasonable doubt instruction with respect to all\n\n                                        141\n\fextraneous offenses admitted at punishment be included in the jury charge at\n\npunishment. (CR2: 273-78).\n\n      These motions were discussed at a pretrial hearing, but no ruling was\n\nmade. Defense counsel argued that the “heart” of his motion was a concern that\n\nthe State would attempt to prove extraneous offenses through the use of\n\nbusiness records. (RR42: 46-48). The State responded that it intended to present\n\nall extraneous offense evidence through live witnesses who could testify about\n\nwhat happened and that it was appellant who did it. (RR42: 46-47, 50).\n\n      Appellant re-urged this motion during the punishment phase. (RR44: 42-53,\n\n133-39). The State responded that it had turned over an exhaustive 404(b) notice\n\nto appellant and that it would only be presenting extraneous offenses that it had\n\na good faith belief could be proven in accordance with the law. (RR44: 42-43).\n\nAppellant’s requests for a hearing on each extraneous offense and an oral\n\ninstruction following the admission of each extraneous offense were denied, but\n\nhis request for a written instruction in the jury charge was granted. (RR44: 48-55).\n\nThe trial court later granted appellant’s request for an oral instruction, which was\n\ngiven to the jury during the presentation of the State’s extraneous offense\n\nevidence. (RR45: 41-42).\n\n                                        142\n\f                                  Applicable Law\n\n      Pursuant to Article 37.071 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a trial court\n\nhas wide discretion in admitting evidence, including extraneous offenses, relevant\n\nto the jury’s determination of a capital murder defendant’s death-worthiness. See\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(a)(1) (West Supp. 2014); Powell v.\n\nState, 898 S.W.2d 821, 830 (Tex. Crim. App. 1994). Extraneous offenses are\n\nadmissible whether adjudicated or unadjudicated, violent or nonviolent. Kemp v.\n\nState, 846 S.W.2d 289, 307 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).\n\n      When offering an extraneous offense at the punishment phase of a capital\n\ntrial, the State neither has to prove all of the elements of the extraneous offense,\n\nnor prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the\n\nextraneous offense. See Adanandus v. State, 866 S.W.2d 210, 234 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1993); Spence v. State, 795 S.W.2d 743, 759 (Tex. Crim. App. 1990). Rather, the\n\nState must “clearly prove” that an offense was committed and that the accused\n\nwas the perpetrator. Young, 283 S.W.3d at 876.\n\n\n\n\n                                        143\n\f                         Applicability of Mitchell v. State\n\n      In his brief, appellant cites Mitchell v. State, 931 S.W.2d 950 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996), in support of his argument that he was entitled to a hearing to\n\ndetermine the admissibility of extraneous offense evidence. In Mitchell, this Court\n\nheld that the trial court has the responsibility of determining the threshold\n\nadmissibility of extraneous offense evidence at the punishment phase of a non-\n\ncapital trial; that is, the court must make an initial determination at the proffer of\n\nthe evidence that the evidence is relevant and that a jury could reasonably find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the extraneous\n\noffense. See Mitchell, 931 S.W.2d at 954. The Court also held that, if requested,\n\nthe defendant is entitled to a limiting instruction that informs the jury that\n\nextraneous offenses offered during the punishment phase must not be\n\nconsidered unless they are proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 954.\n\n      Mitchell was a non-capital case and was based on the language in Article\n\n37.07. Capital cases, however, are governed by Article 37.071. This article clearly\n\nimbues the trial judge with wide discretion to admit any evidence relevant to the\n\njury’s determination of a capital defendant’s deathworthiness, including evidence\n\nof adjudicated and unadjudicated extraneous offenses, so long as the State can\n\n                                         144\n\fsufficiently connect the appellant to the alleged extraneous offense. See Kemp,\n\n846 S.W.2d at 307. There is no requirement that they be proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt or that the trial court give any additional instructions on the\n\nburden of proof beyond what is already included in the instructions on the special\n\nissues. See Jackson v. State, 992 S.W.2d 469, 477 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). As such,\n\nMitchell is inapplicable. See id.; see also Prystash v. State, 3 S.W.3d 522, 533 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1999) (finding Mitchell “inapplicable to the capital sentencing\n\nstructure” in addressing appellant’s complaint regarding the trial court’s refusal to\n\ngive separate jury instruction on burden of proof of extraneous offenses).\n\n            Appellant Has Not Shown an Abuse of Discretion or Harm\n\n      In any event, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nappellant’s request. Even if appellant was entitled to a threshold determination of\n\nadmissibility under the rules of evidence, he was not necessarily entitled to\n\nhearing on each separate extraneous offense. See Tex. R. Evid. 104. There is no\n\nset method the court must use to make this threshold determination; it could\n\nbase the decision on an assessment of testimony and argument made at a hearing\n\noutside the presence of the jury, an evaluation of a written proffer by the State,\n\nor some other method. See Arzaga v. State, 86 S.W.3d 767, 781 (Tex. App.—El\n\n                                         145\n\fPaso 2002, no pet.); Mann v. State, 13 S.W.3d 89, 94 (Tex. App.—Austin 2000),\n\naff'd, 58 S.W.3d 132, (Tex. Crim. App. 2001); Welch v. State, 993 S.W.2d 690 (Tex.\n\nApp.—San Antonio 1999, no pet.).\n\n      Here, the State filed a detailed, chronological 404(b) notice outlining the\n\nvarious extraneous offenses committed by appellant. Outside the presence of the\n\njury, the State made an oral proffer to the trial court that it planned to prove\n\nextraneous offenses through live witnesses who could testify about what\n\nhappened and show that appellant was the perpetrator. (RR42: 46, 50; RR44: 44).\n\nThe State also assured the trial court that it had no intention of offering evidence\n\nof an extraneous offense that it did not have a good faith belief it could prove in\n\naccordance with the law. (RR44: 42). While the trial court made no express ruling\n\non the admissibility of the extraneous offenses prior to trial, its denial of\n\nappellant’s request for a hearing following the State’s proffer constitutes an\n\nimplied ruling of admissibility. See Mann, 13 S.W.3d at 94.\n\n      Further, any error in the trial court’s failure to hold a hearing was harmless.\n\nWith regard to each extraneous offense presented at punishment, which are\n\noutlined in detail in the State’s Summary of Facts (Infra pp. 11-26), the State\n\n\n\n                                        146\n\fprovided clear proof that an offense occurred and that appellant was the\n\nperpetrator. See Young, 283 S.W.3d at 876.\n\n      In addition, the trial court gave both an oral and written instruction to the\n\njury that they were not to consider extraneous offenses for any purpose unless\n\nthey found and believed beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed\n\nthe offenses, if any were committed, and even then they could only consider\n\nthem in determining their answers to the special issues. (RR45: 41-42; CR2: 406).\n\nThe jury is presumed to have followed this instruction and disregarded any\n\noffenses they did not believe were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. See\n\nGamboa v. State, 296 S.W.3d 574, 580 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (noting jury\n\npresumed to follow the judge’s instructions). This extra safeguard, which was not\n\nrequired but operated to appellant’s benefit, rendered any error in the trial\n\ncourt’s failure to hold a hearing harmless.\n\n      Appellant wholly fails to show how he was harmed by the trial court’s\n\nruling. All of the extraneous offenses presented were relevant to the jury’s\n\ndetermination of appellant’s deathworthiness. See Powell, 898 S.W.2d at 830;\n\nKemp, 846 S.W.2d at 307. Appellant does not argue that he did not commit the\n\nextraneous offenses presented. He also makes no attempt to explain for the Court\n\n                                        147\n\fwhich, if any, extraneous offenses would have been excluded by the court if the\n\nrequested hearing had been held. Appellant argues that if the trial court had\n\nacknowledged his request for a threshold hearing, Issues 42, 43 and 44 raised in\n\nhis brief would have been prevented. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 113). However, these\n\nissues do not pertain to the admission of extraneous offense evidence. In Issue\n\n42, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s\n\nanswer to the future-dangerousness special issue; and Issues 43 and 44 are\n\nconstitutional challenges to Texas’ death penalty statute. Based on the foregoing,\n\nIssue 35 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                      Issue 36: Denial of Motion for Mistrial\n\n      In Issue 36, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion for a mistrial. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 114-16).\n\n                                   Pertinent Facts\n\n      Dallas Police Officer Ryan Swain testified that he responded to a suspicious\n\nperson call on July 18, 2010. (RR45: 73-74). Before he could elaborate further,\n\nappellant requested a bench conference, where he notified the State and the trial\n\ncourt that he did not have notice of the incident Officer Swain was about to offer\n\ntestimony on. (RR45: 75). The trial court removed the jury and appellant objected\n\n                                         148\n\fto Officer Swain’s testimony on the basis that he was not provided notice by the\n\nState. (RR45: 75-76). The prosecutors, realizing that the offense had been\n\nmistakenly omitted from the State’s Notice of Extraneous Offenses, notified the\n\nCourt that it would not present any further testimony from Officer Swain. (RR45:\n\n76).\n\n       Counsel stated that the absence of any further testimony would invite the\n\njury to speculate and he requested that an instruction to disregard the testimony\n\nbe given. (RR45: 78). The trial court granted appellant’s request. (RR45: 78-79).\n\nAppellant expressed his concerns that a curative instruction was inadequate and\n\nalso moved for a mistrial. (RR45: 79). That request was denied. (RR45: 79-80).\n\nWhen the jury was returned to the courtroom, the trial court orally instructed\n\nthem to “disregard any testimony that was offered by Officer Swain, the last\n\nwitness that the State presented to you.” (RR45: 81). Appellant moved for a\n\nmistrial in the presence of the jury and his request was denied. (RR45: 81). In the\n\npunishment charge, the jurors were further instructed: “During your deliberations\n\nupon the special issues, you must not consider, discuss, nor relate any matters\n\nnot in evidence before you.” (CR2: 405).\n\n\n\n                                       149\n\f                                   Applicable Law\n\n      A mistrial is the trial court’s remedy for improper conduct that is so\n\nprejudicial that expenditure of further time and expense would be wasteful and\n\nfutile. Hawkins v. State, 135 S.W.3d 72, 77 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Only in extreme\n\ncircumstances, where the prejudice is incurable, will a mistrial be required. Id.\n\nWhen the trial court sustains an objection and grants an instruction to disregard,\n\nbut denies a motion for mistrial, the proper issue is whether the trial court abused\n\nits discretion by denying the motion for mistrial. Id.\n\n      In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\nmistrial, an appellate court considers the following factors: (1) severity of the\n\nmisconduct (the magnitude of the prejudicial effect); (2) measures adopted to\n\ncure the misconduct (the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the judge); and\n\n(3) the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct (the strength of the\n\nevidence supporting the conviction). Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 259 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1998).\n\n       The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Denying Appellant’s\n                               Motion for Mistrial\n\n      Here, Officer Swain’s testimony is two pages from one volume of a 52-\n\nvolume record. He was cut off before he could offer any substantive, much less\n                                     150\n\fprejudicial, testimony about his encounter with appellant. The State did not\n\npresent any further testimony from him after realizing the error in their notice.\n\nClearly, his testimony was not offered to inflame the jurors, nor was it of such a\n\ncharacter as to suggest the impossibility of withdrawing the impression left on the\n\njury. The trial court’s prompt instruction to disregard was sufficient to cure any\n\nharm resulting from the impression left on the jury. This Court presumes the jury\n\nfollowed the trial court’s instruction. See Gamboa, 296 S.W.3d at 580 (noting that\n\na reviewing court generally considers instructions given to the jury sufficient to\n\nremedy most improprieties that occur during trial and presumes the jury will\n\nfollow the trial court’s instructions).\n\n      Given the strength of the evidence supporting the jury’s answers to the\n\nspecial issues, the trial court’s prompt instruction to disregard, and the\n\ninconsequential nature of the complained-of testimony, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for mistrial. As such, Issue 36 is\n\nwithout merit and should be overruled.\n\n            Issues 38 and 39: Cross-Examination of Appellant’s Experts\n\n      In Issues 38 and 39, appellant contends that the trial court erred by\n\noverruling his objections and permitting the State to cross-examine his experts,\n\n                                          151\n\fDr. Kellie Gray-Smith and Dr. Gilbert Martinez, on antisocial personality disorder.\n\nHe claims that the State’s cross-examination was an attempt to convert his\n\nexperts into State’s witnesses and elicit opinions on matters that were outside\n\ntheir field of expertise. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 118-21). Appellant’s contentions are\n\nwithout merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      Texas Rule of Evidence 611(b) provides “a witness may be cross-examined\n\non any matter relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.” Tex. R. Evid.\n\n611(b). The scope of appropriate cross-examination is necessarily broad. Carroll v.\n\nState, 916 S.W.2d 494, 497 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996). The parameters of cross-\n\nexamination are within the trial court’s discretion, and its decision is not subject\n\nto reversal on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. Cantu v. State, 939\n\nS.W.2d 627, 635 (Tex. Crim. App. 1997); Chambers v. State, 866 S.W.2d 9, 27 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1993).\n\n                          Issue 38: Dr. Kellie Gray-Smith\n\n      In Issue 38, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the State’s cross-examination of Dr. Kellie Gray-Smith, a psychologist\n\nretained by the defense to provide expert testimony on special education and the\n\n                                         152\n\fmulti-cultural aspects of psychology. The cross-examination of which appellant\n\ncomplains went as follows:\n\n      Q (MS. KEMP): And you are familiar with the criteria for antisocial\n      personality disorder; is that correct?\n\n      A (DR. GRAY-SMITH): Yes.\n\n      Q: All right.\n\n      A: Yes, that’s correct. Yeah.\n\n      Q: So you know that they, typically, have a reckless disregard for the\n      safety of others?\n\n      A: Yes. That can be part of the profile.\n\n      Q: And that they fail to conform to the norms?\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Excuse me, Judge. I’m going to object. This is outside\n      of the area that we brought in any testimony in regards -- and she is\n      talking about -- if she is talking symptomology of ASPD, in general,\n      that’s one thing, but now she is going to try to associate these\n      symptom-ologies to a particular individual who this witness has not\n      interviewed or examined, so I'm going to object to her stating a litany\n      of the ASPD criteria and stating that they are all attributed to a\n      particular person when she has not examined the person. You cannot\n      attribute it to that person.\n\n      MR. HEALY: Judge, she has not examined the person, but she gave\n      the opinion that he has antisocial personality disorder.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: She has not given a diagnosis of that, Judge. There's a\n      big difference. She is not allowed to sit there and say to somebody\n      that she --\n                                       153\n\f      THE COURT: I understand and I heard her testimony. I will overrule\n      the objection. Go ahead.\n\n(RR49: 76-77).\n\n              Appellant Failed to Preserve His Complaint for Review\n\n      To preserve a complaint for appellate review, a party must have presented\n\na specific and timely request, motion, or objection to the trial court and, further,\n\nmust have obtained a ruling. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a); Broxton v. State, 909\n\nS.W.2d 912, 918 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995); Burks v. State, 876 S.W.2d 877, 899 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 1994); Turner v. State, 805 S.W.2d 423, 431 (Tex. Crim. App. 1991).\n\nBecause appellant failed to object to the prosecutor’s preceding question, which\n\nasked Dr. Gray-Smith about one of the criteria or symptoms present in someone\n\nwith antisocial personality disorder, appellant’s objection was untimely and failed\n\nto preserve the issue for review. Additionally, Dr. Gray-Smith had already\n\ntestified, without objection, that she was of the opinion that appellant had\n\nantisocial personality disorder:\n\n      Q (MS. KEMP): And so as you conclude throughout your report here\n      that Mr. Muhammad has antisocial personality disorder, you\n      connected those dots on your own; is that correct?\n\n      A (DR. GRAY-SMITH): Yes.\n\n                                        154\n\f      Q: You are a licensed psychologist; is that correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And you are familiar with all behavioral disorders; is that correct?\n\n      A: That’s correct.\n\n      Q: So given a limited amount of information, you can make a\n      diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, could you not?\n\n      A: I would form an opinion. I don’t know if I would say it is a\n      diagnosis, but I would form an opinion.\n\n      Q: Yeah, I think that’s more accurate. So any licensed psychologist\n      with the appropriate training and behavioral and studies, which all\n      licensed psychologists have, could form an opinion, even with the\n      limited amount of records that you have; is that correct?\n\n      A: It’s possible.\n\n(RR49: 58-59). Appellant also failed to object to the following exchange:\n\n      Q (MS. KEMP): You have an opinion that Mr. Muhammad is a\n      sociopath, don't you?\n\n      A (DR. GRAY-SMITH): I have an opinion that his pattern of academic\n      records and psychological records suggest that he has an antisocial\n      personality disorder.\n\n      Q: Same as a sociopath?\n\n      A: Yes, in a generic sense.\n\n      Q: Okay. Thank you.\n\n                                        155\n\f(RR49: 72). Accordingly, appellant has failed to preserve his complaint for review.\n\nSee Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n          The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Permitting the\n                   State’s Cross-Examination of Dr. Gray-Smith\n\n      Nevertheless, should this Court consider this issue, the record reflects that\n\nthe trial court properly overruled appellant’s objection. A witness may be cross-\n\nexamined on any issue relevant to the case. Tex. R. Evid. 611(b). Clearly, whether\n\nappellant possesses the diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder is\n\nrelevant to future danger and admissible in a capital murder trial. See Powell, 898\n\nS.W.2d at 830 (trial court has wide discretion in admitting evidence any evidence\n\nrelevant to the jury’s determination of a capital murder defendant’s death-\n\nworthiness). Additionally, here, this was certainly a relevant area of cross-\n\nexamination since it was raised by Dr. Gray-Smith’s testimony on direct\n\nexamination.\n\n      On direct examination, Dr. Gray-Smith testified that she had reviewed a\n\n1994 psychological evaluation of the appellant, in which appellant was diagnosed\n\nwith conduct disorder. (RR49: 41, 55-57). Defense counsel then elicited the\n\nfollowing testimony:\n\n\n                                       156\n\f      Q (MR. JOHNSON): Doctor, do you -- when you have an individual\n      that goes forward from the Oppositional Defiant Disorder and into\n      the Conduct Disorder, if the behaviors never, actually, got ahold of or\n      actually intervened and treated, is there a predictability as to where\n      that person is going to end up?\n\n      A (DR. GRAY-SMITH): Yes. They usually end up being diagnosed with\n      antisocial personality disorder, which is the adult form of conduct\n      disorder.\n\n      ....\n\n      Q: And as an expert here testifying today, would it surprise you, not\n      that there has been a finding of this, but would it surprise you that\n      the person whose records that you examined there would have gone\n      from the point of ODD to conduct disorder to the symptom-ologies\n      of antisocial personality behavior disorder?\n\n      A: Not at all. It would have been predictable.\n\n(RR49: 43, 45-46). Because the issue of antisocial personality disorder was\n\nrelevant and was raised on direct examination by appellant, the State was\n\npermitted to cross-examine Dr. Gray-Smith concerning her knowledge about the\n\ndisorder and whether she believed that the appellant exhibited the criteria\n\nnecessary for such a diagnosis. Accordingly, the trial court properly overruled\n\nappellant’s objection.\n\n\n\n\n                                       157\n\f                          Issue 39: Dr. Gilbert Martinez\n\n      In Issue 39, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the State’s cross-examination of Dr. Gilbert Martinez, a clinical\n\nneuropsychologist retained by the defense to provide expert testimony on\n\nappellant’s cognitive and intellectual functioning. The cross-examination of which\n\nappellant complains went as follows:\n\n      Q (MS. KEMP): So, doctor, would someone with antisocial personality\n      disorder have an impulsiveness problem?\n\n      A (DR. MARTINEZ): Impulsivity is one of the diagnostic criteria for\n      antisocial personality disorder, yes.\n\n      Q: Would someone with antisocial personality disorder have a failure\n      to conform to society’s norms and general rules and regulations of\n      society?\n\n      A: That’s another one of the diagnostic criteria for antisocial\n      personality disorder.\n\n      Q: Would they have a history of lying, or conning other people for\n      their own personal gain or pleasure?\n\n      A: That’s another one of the descriptors for antisocial personality\n      disorder. That’s correct.\n\n      Q: Would they have difficulty in planning ahead?\n\n      A: Yes. That can be one of the symptoms, one of the features of\n      antisocial personality disorder.\n\n                                       158\n\f      Q: Would they be seen as irritable and aggressive by having repeated\n      fights in school?\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Excuse me, Judge. All of these questions here are\n      clearly outside of the referral question. He has testified in regards to\n      what he was asked to do by me in regards to this case. He has not\n      been asked to do any kind of psychological assessment in regards to\n      any ASPD factors. She is, basically, just running down the DSM 4 and\n      asking if these are the criteria for antisocial personality disorder. He\n      was not asked, in any way, to do any type of evaluation in this case in\n      those regards. He is testifying only towards his cognitive deficits, and\n      that’s all that he is on for. We’ve got other individuals to speak to\n      those matters where that would be relevant, but not this doctor.\n\n      MR. HEALY: Judge, he made an Axis II diagnosis and that included\n      antisocial personality disorder.\n\n      THE COURT: Overruled. Please proceed.\n\n      MS. KEMP: Thank you. That person will show a reckless disregard for\n      the safety of others, wouldn't he?\n\n      DR. MARTINEZ: That’s another feature of the antisocial personality\n      disorder, yes.\n\n(RR48: 153-54).\n\n             Appellant Failed to Preserve His Complaint for Review\n\n      To the extent that appellant is complaining about the line of questioning\n\nconcerning the symptoms or diagnostic criteria associated with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder, appellant failed to raise a timely objection. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 33.1(a). The prosecutor had already posed several questions regarding this\n                                     159\n\fsubject prior to appellant’s objection. Error is defaulted when the same evidence\n\nis presented elsewhere without objection. McFarland v. State, 845 S.W.2d 824,\n\n840 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992); Narvaiz v. State, 840 S.W.2d 415, 430 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1992). Appellant also failed to object to additional questions concerning the same\n\nsubject matter. (RR48: 155-56). Accordingly, appellant has failed to preserve this\n\ncomplaint for review.\n\n      To the extent that trial counsel was objecting to the prosecutor’s questions\n\nconcerning whether Dr. Martinez was of the opinion that appellant had antisocial\n\npersonality disorder, his objection was premature because the prosecutor had not\n\nelicited such testimony. Furthermore, when the State did pose such questions to\n\nDr. Martinez, appellant failed to object. (RR48: 157-60). Consequently, this\n\ncomplaint has also not been preserved for review.\n\n          The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion by Permitting the\n                    State’s Cross-Examination of Dr. Martinez\n\n      Alternatively, appellant’s claim fails on the merits. Dr. Martinez, a licensed\n\nneuropsychologist, testified that he was familiar with the diagnostic criteria for\n\nantisocial personality disorder. (RR48: 156). That diagnostic criteria is found in the\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (“DSM”), which Dr.\n\nMartinez testified is used by most clinicians and was, in fact, used by Dr. Martinez\n                                         160\n\fin his evaluation of the appellant. (RR48: 155-56; Defendant’s Exhibit 11).\n\nTherefore, questions concerning the criteria or symptoms exhibited by someone\n\nwith antisocial personality disorder were not outside his area of expertise.\n\nAdditionally, because Dr. Martinez had reviewed appellant’s medical records and\n\na 1994 psychological evaluation, conducted a face-to-face interview with\n\nappellant, and administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to the\n\nappellant, it was reasonable to question him concerning whether he had an\n\nopinion as to whether appellant met the criteria for a diagnosis of antisocial\n\npersonality disorder. (RR48: 102-07, 111-12). Accordingly, the State’s cross-\n\nexamination of Dr. Martinez was appropriate, and the trial court properly\n\noverruled appellant’s objection.\n\n                           Error, If Any, Was Harmless\n\n      Finally, even if the trial court erred in overruling the appellant’s objections,\n\nthe error was harmless. Error in the admission of evidence is non-constitutional\n\nerror and must be disregarded unless the error affects a defendant’s substantial\n\nrights. See Tex. R. Evid. 103; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b); Walters v. State, 247 S.W.3d\n\n204, 218-19 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007). “[S]ubstantial rights are not affected by the\n\nerroneous admission of evidence if the appellate court, after examining the\n\n                                        161\n\frecord as a whole, has fair assurance that the error did not influence the jury, or\n\nhad but a slight effect.” Solomon v. State, 49 S.W.3d 356, 365 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      Examining the record as a whole, it is clear that any error in the trial court’s\n\nrulings did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury.\n\nFirst, Dr. Gray-Smith had already testified, without objection, that appellant’s\n\nacademic and psychological records suggested that he had antisocial personality\n\ndisorder. Additionally, while Dr. Martinez was questioned by the prosecutor\n\nconcerning whether appellant met the criteria for antisocial personality disorder,\n\nDr. Martinez testified that he had not been asked to evaluate the appellant for\n\nantisocial personality disorder and had not performed the necessary assessments\n\nto make that determination. Accordingly, his testimony had no negative impact\n\non the appellant. Therefore, any error in the trial court’s rulings did not affect\n\nappellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Issues 38 and 39 should be overruled.\n\n            Issue 40: Trial Court’s Statement Regarding Sequestration\n\n      In Issue 40, appellant contends that the trial court improperly commented\n\non the weight of the evidence in his statement to the jury concerning being\n\n                                         162\n\fsequestered after they had begun deliberating. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 121-24).\n\nThe record reflects that the trial court’s statement was not an improper comment\n\non the evidence, nor did it prejudice the rights of appellant.\n\n                                      Pertinent Facts\n\n      After both sides rested and closed at punishment, the trial court gave the\n\nfollowing instructions to the jury:\n\n      THE COURT: All right. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that closes\n      the evidence in the case. Now, it is almost 3:00, so what I'm going to\n      do, it is too late to start your deliberations because once I charge\n      you, we have closing arguments, then I can't let you separate, so\n      what I'm going to do this evening is send you-all home and bring you\n      back at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, at which time I will read the\n      charge to you. We will have closing arguments of counsel, and then I\n      will send you out to deliberate punishment. All right. So remember\n      the instructions that I have given you earlier, not to discuss any of\n      the evidence in this case with anyone, not even among yourselves.\n      Do not watch any of the TV or read the newspaper accounts or any of\n      those things. Have a good evening, and we will see you back here at\n      9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Judge, they're going to need --the future instructions.\n\n      THE COURT: Okay. I was going to tell you about bringing –\n\n      THE BAILIFF: I will tell them back here.\n\n      THE COURT: Mike has some instructions. I've asked Mike to have you,\n      in the morning, bring with you a change of clothes just in case. I don't\n      think you are going to need it, but just in case you do not finish your\n      deliberations tomorrow, then I will have to sequester you as long as\n                                       163\n\f      you are in deliberations, or before you return to court with a verdict\n      on punishment, then I will have to keep y'all together. And so -- just\n      bring a change of clothes with you. Anything else, Mike, that I need\n      to tell them about?\n\n      THE BAILIFF: No.\n\n      THE COURT: You think that covers it?\n\n      THE BAILIFF: Yes, sir.\n\n      THE COURT: All right. Very good. Thank y'all. We will see you\n      tomorrow morning at 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n\n(RR49: 151-53). After the jury was removed, appellant moved for a mistrial.\n\n(RR49: 157). He argued that the trial court’s statement “I don’t think you are\n\ngoing to need it” in regards to the change of clothes he instructed them to bring\n\nwas an improper comment on the weight of the evidence and an indication from\n\nthe bench that the court is of the opinion there is nothing in the case worthy of\n\ndeliberation. (RR49: 157-58). When asked to explain what he meant by the\n\ncomment, the trial judge stated: “I was only explaining to them why I’m going to\n\nstart them in the morning and give them all day long, but if they don’t reach a\n\nverdict, then they need to be prepared to - … - so I could sequester them. And if I\n\ndidn’t think that that was necessary, I wouldn’t have told them to bring any\n\nclothes.” (RR49: 158-59).\n\n                                       164\n\f      The following morning, the jury heard the argument of counsel and was\n\ngiven instructions for their deliberation of the special issues. (CR2: 402-07). They\n\nwere instructed that it would not be proper for them to arrive at their answers to\n\nthe special issues by any other method other than by a full, fair, and free\n\nexchange of the opinion of each individual juror. (CR2: 405). They were further\n\ninstructed that they may, and should, deliberate for as long as they felt was\n\nnecessary to arrive at their answers to the special issues. (CR2: 405).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      There are no set time limits on jury deliberations, and the length of time\n\nthe jury may be held to deliberate is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\n\nSee Guidry v. State, 9 S.W.3d 133, 155 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999). “The court on its\n\nown motion may and on the motion of either party shall, after having given its\n\ncharge to the jury, order that the jury not be allowed to separate . . . .\" Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.23 (West 2006).\n\n      Article 38.05 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure provides, in part, that\n\na judge may not at any stage of the proceeding previous to the return of the\n\nverdict, make any remark calculated to convey to the jury his opinion of the case.\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 38.05 (West 1979). A trial court improperly\n\n                                         165\n\fcomments on the weight of the evidence if it makes a statement that implies\n\napproval of the State’s argument, indicates any disbelief in the defense’s position,\n\nor diminishes the credibility of the defense’s approach to its case. Hoang v. State,\n\n997 S.W.2d 678, 681 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1999, no pet.); Clark v. State, 878\n\nS.W.2d 224, 226 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1994, no pet.).\n\n      To be reversible, a violation of Article 38.05 must be reasonably calculated\n\nto benefit the State or prejudice the rights of the defendant. Becknell v. State, 720\n\nS.W.2d 526, 531 (Tex. Crim. App. 1986); Simon v. State, 203 S.W.3d 581, 592 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2006, no pet.). In evaluating whether the court's\n\ncomment on the evidence was reasonably calculated to benefit the State or\n\nprejudice the defendant, the reviewing court first examines whether the\n\ncomment was material, i.e., if the jury was considering the same issue. Clark, 878\n\nS.W.2d at 226. The reviewing court must then consider the consequences that\n\nprobably resulted from the trial court’s comment to determine whether the\n\ncomment prejudiced appellant’s rights. Id.; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n       The Trial Court’s Statement Was Not an Improper Comment on the\n                              Weight of the Evidence\n\n      During the complained-of statement, the trial court admonished the jury\n\nthat they could be sequestered. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.23. The\n                                     166\n\fcourt instructed them to bring a change of clothes in the event that they were not\n\nfinished deliberating at the end of the day. As reflected by the trial court’s\n\nexplanation following the removal of the jury, the intent of the statement was\n\nsimply to inform the jurors of the possibility of sequestration. The court further\n\nexplained that if it did not believe the jury had anything worthy of deliberation he\n\nwould not have instructed them to bring a change of clothes.\n\n      The record reflects that the trial court’s statement “I don’t think you will\n\nneed them” with regard to the extra clothes was an offhand comment with no\n\ncalculated intent. It is possible the trial court was trying to put the jurors at ease\n\nabout the potential sequestration. It is also possible that the trial court reasonably\n\nbelieved that the jury would reach a verdict after a full day of deliberation based\n\non his experience as a judge who has presided over multiple capital murder cases.\n\nRegardless, the trial court’s comment did not imply approval of the State’s\n\nposition or indicate any disbelief in the appellant’s position. As such, this\n\nstatement was not an improper comment on the weight of the evidence. See\n\nHoang, 997 S.W.2d at 682.\n\n      Even if this comment could be construed, as appellant claims, to convey the\n\ntrial court’s perception of the state of the evidence and belief that the jury would\n\n                                         167\n\fnot need to give much time in deliberation of the special issues, this comment did\n\nnot necessarily benefit the State. The comment contains no expression of the trial\n\ncourt’s view of how the jury should resolve the special issues. There was\n\ncompelling punishment evidence presented by both sides during appellant’s trial.\n\nThe trial court’s comment could have just as easily been perceived to mean that\n\nthe court did not think it would not take the jurors longer than a day to resolve\n\nthe special issues in such a way that resulted in a life sentence for appellant.\n\n      To the extent that the trial court’s comment could be perceived as rushing\n\nthe jurors in their deliberation with a threat of sequestration, this claim is equally\n\nwithout merit. The jurors were sent home for the evening following the trial\n\ncourt’s statement. The following morning, they were given detailed instructions\n\nregarding their deliberation of the special issues. The jurors were instructed that\n\nthey may, and should, deliberate for as long as necessary to arrive at their\n\nanswers to the special issues. (CR2: 405). Judicial instructions to the jury are\n\npresumed to be effective unless evidence shows the jury did not follow the\n\ndirective. See Gamboa, 296 S.W.3d at 580 (a jury is presumed to follow the trial\n\ncourt’s instructions). There is no indication in the record that the jurors were not\n\nallowed to deliberate as long as they felt was necessary.\n\n                                         168\n\f       The Trial Court’s Comment Was Not Calculated to Benefit the State\n                             or Prejudice Appellant\n\n      Even if this Court were to find that this was an improper comment on the\n\nweight of the evidence, it does not constitute reversible error. There is simply no\n\nindication that the comment was reasonably calculated to benefit the State or\n\nprejudice the rights of the defendant. See Becknell, 720 S.W.2d at 531; Simon, 203\n\nS.W.3d at 592. First, it was not material. The issue before the jury was resolution\n\nof the special issues, the outcome of which would determine whether appellant\n\nwas going to receive a sentence of life or death. The trial court’s comment, which\n\nreferred to its belief on the time deliberations might take and whether the jury\n\nwould be sequestered, pertained more to the logistics of deliberations and was\n\nimmaterial to their resolution of the special issues.\n\n      Moreover, a review of the record indicates that the comment did not affect\n\nappellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). The trial court’s\n\ncomment did not inject harmful new facts and was not calculated to deprive\n\nappellant of a fair and impartial trial. The jury instructions included in the\n\npunishment charge – instructing the jurors to deliberate for as long as necessary\n\nand to arrive at their answers to special issues only after a full, fair, and free\n\nexchange of the opinion of each juror – helped to cure any error. Further, in light\n                                      169\n\fof the heinousness of appellant’s offense of drowning his two young sons and the\n\nvoluminous and compelling punishment evidence presented by the State, it is\n\nunlikely that the trial court’s offhanded comment had any influence on the jury’s\n\nverdict. Issue 40 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n        Issue 42: Legal Sufficiency of Future Dangerousness Special Issue\n\n      In Issue 42, appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s answer to Special Issue No. 1, the future dangerousness special\n\nissue. Specifically, he contends that he had no prior violent offense convictions\n\nthat sent him to the penitentiary. He also contends that the offense was the\n\nresult of family conflict about his children that would not exist in prison, thereby\n\nremoving the probability that he would constitute a future danger. (Appellant’s\n\nBrief, pp. 126-27). Appellant’s contentions are without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The State has the burden of proving the punishment issue of future\n\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n37.071, §§ 2(b)(1), 2(c). In assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence of future\n\ndangerousness, this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\n                                         170\n\fverdict to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that there is a probability that appellant would commit criminal\n\nacts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. See Estrada,\n\n313 S.W.3d at 284.\n\n      In its determination of the special issues, the jury is entitled to consider all\n\nthe evidence presented at the guilt phase of the trial, in addition to the evidence\n\npresented at the punishment phase. Young, 283 S.W.3d at 863. Some factors the\n\njury may consider when determining whether appellant will pose a continuing\n\nthreat to society include: (1) the circumstances of the offense, including the\n\ndefendant’s state of mind and whether he was working alone or with other\n\nparties; (2) the calculated nature of his acts; (3) the forethought and\n\ndeliberateness exhibited by the crime’s execution; (4) the existence of a prior\n\ncriminal record and the severity of the prior crimes; (5) the defendant’s age and\n\npersonal circumstances at the time of the offense; (6) whether the defendant was\n\nacting under duress or the domination of another at the time of the offense; (7)\n\npsychiatric evidence; and (8) character evidence. See Wardrip v. State, 56 S.W.3d\n\n588, 594 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001); Keeton v. State, 724 S.W.2d 58, 61 (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1987). The circumstances of the offense and the events surrounding it may\n\n                                        171\n\fbe sufficient in some instances to sustain a “yes” answer to the future-\n\ndangerousness special issue. Young, 283 S.W.3d at 863.\n\n        The Evidence is Legally Sufficient to Support the Jury’s Finding of\n                             Future Dangerousness\n\n      The State presented sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of\n\nfuture dangerousness. First, the gruesome facts of the offense alone were\n\nsufficient to support a finding of future dangerousness. The evidence presented at\n\ntrial showed that appellant murdered his two young sons because he was angry\n\nwith their mother Kametra. On the Saturday prior to the offense, appellant saw\n\nKametra with another man at a back-to-school barbeque and became angry that\n\nshe was seeing another man and that the man was in his sons’ lives. The evidence\n\nreflects that appellant asked to borrow his friend Christal’s car so that he could\n\ndrive Naim to school on his first day, despite not having obtained permission to\n\ntake him. On the day of the offense, after being told he could not drive Naim to\n\nschool, appellant saw Kametra, Naim and Elijah walking toward Naim’s school.\n\nAppellant stopped the car and forced Kametra and the boys to get into the car.\n\nAppellant then drove them aimlessly around the neighborhood, all the while\n\nthreatening to harm Kametra. When appellant stopped the car for a red light,\n\nKametra saw a constable one lane over. Despite appellant’s warnings not to get\n                                    172\n\fout of the car, Kametra jumped out of the car and flagged down the constable.\n\nAngry that Kametra disobeyed him, appellant sped off with the boys. He then\n\ntook them to a creek, told them to sit in the water, place their heads under the\n\nwater, and pretend like they were swimming. Appellant then held their heads\n\nunder the water until they drowned. Afterward, appellant attempted to break\n\ninto the house where his youngest son Jeremiah was sleeping, but was forced out\n\nof the house by Kametra’s brother.\n\n      The calculated and deliberate nature of appellant’s actions in committing\n\nthis violent and heinous double-murder was sufficient to support the jury’s\n\nfinding of future dangerousness. See Druery v. State, 225 S.W.3d 491, 507 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007) (the circumstances of an offense can be some of the most\n\nrevealing evidence of future dangerousness and may be sufficient to\n\nindependently support an affirmative answer to the future dangerousness issue).\n\nThe State, however, did not rely solely on the facts of the offense to prove\n\nappellant’s future dangerousness.\n\n      The State also presented evidence of appellant’s extensive criminal history,\n\nspanning nearly twenty years, back to when appellant was thirteen-year-old\n\njuvenile. Between January 1993 and August 1994, appellant was arrested seven\n\n                                      173\n\ftimes. Appellant’s offenses included: two burglaries of a habitation, possession of\n\na stolen vehicle, burglary of a coin operated machine, burglary of a motor vehicle,\n\nunauthorized use of a motor vehicle, and evading arrest. After numerous\n\nattempts to place appellant on probation and home supervision, appellant was\n\nconfined to Daytop Village, where appellant received individual and group\n\ncounseling. However, appellant was unable to follow the rules, and after\n\nnumerous infractions, concluding with his assaulting the same juvenile twice in\n\none day, appellant was discharged from the facility on July 1, 1995.\n\n      Following his discharge from Daytop Village, appellant was sent to TYC,\n\nwhere his violent behavior and inability to follow the rules continued. In general,\n\nappellant was explosive and disrespectful to the TYC staff. This was particularly\n\nevident in his treatment of female staff. On one occasion appellant approached\n\nfemale staff member Nina Adams as she was teaching class, and began bumping\n\nhis erect penis against her leg. On several other occasions, appellant called female\n\nstaff bitches, fat mother fuckers, and “ho’s.” Appellant’s infractions, however,\n\nwere not restricted to the TYC staff. Appellant was involved in a three-on-one\n\nfight in the dormitory restroom in which he punched a juvenile that was being\n\nheld down on a toilet. Appellant was also caught with razor blades and crushed\n\n                                        174\n\faspirin. Appellant admitted that he had stolen the razor blades and was trading\n\nthe aspirin for snacks.\n\n      After he was released from TYC, appellant continued to have trouble with\n\nthe law. Appellant picked up three new offenses in 1997: burglary of a vehicle,\n\nevading arrest, and theft of check. The following year, appellant was arrested for\n\nburglary of a vehicle. Appellant’s encounters with the law continued in 1999,\n\nwhen appellant was arrested on a warrant when he was stopped, along with two\n\nother men, during an investigation into a burglary. While the officers determined\n\nthat the appellant and other men were not involved in the burglary, a loaded\n\nshotgun was found inside the vehicle and a bag of marijuana and screwdriver\n\nwere found tossed just outside of the vehicle.\n\n      Additionally, the State presented substantial evidence of appellant’s\n\nviolence against women. In 2001, appellant was caught peering in the window of\n\na female neighbor. When the neighbor confronted appellant, he denied looking in\n\nthe window and threatened to beat her if she continued to say that he had.\n\nAppellant also exhibited physical violence toward his sister Sekinah. In 2009,\n\nappellant took a hammer and hit her twice in the back of the head. Appellant was\n\nsentenced to five years’ deferred adjudication for the charge of aggravated\n\n                                       175\n\fassault with a deadly weapon. Appellant received probation at the request of his\n\nsister, who wanted him to be able to provide for his children. Appellant was on\n\nprobation for this offense when he committed the instant capital murder.\n\n      The State also presented considerable evidence concerning appellant’s\n\nviolent relationship with Kametra. Appellant began a sexual relationship with\n\nKametra when he was twenty-five and she was fifteen. Appellant began hitting\n\nher only a few short weeks into their relationship. The jury heard how appellant\n\nrepeatedly physically abused Kametra, even when she was pregnant with his\n\nthree children. After learning that she was pregnant with their first child,\n\nAppellant kicked her in the stomach in an attempt to cause a miscarriage. When\n\nthat failed, appellant suggested that she drink bleach or use a wire hanger.\n\n      The jury also heard about two particularly violent encounters Kametra had\n\nwith the appellant in the months preceding the capital murder. In February 2011,\n\nappellant punched Kametra in the face, forced his way into her mother’s house,\n\nand grabbed Naim. Appellant then kicked down a door in order to flee the house.\n\nApproximately one month later, appellant forced his way into the car Kametra\n\nwas driving when she came to pick the boys up from a visit with him. Appellant\n\ndemanded that she take him to the store, and when she refused to take him,\n\n                                       176\n\fAppellant choked her until she was unconscious. When she woke up, she was\n\ninside the house where appellant was living with his brother, but had no\n\nrecollection of how she got there. Appellant, who was still angry that she had\n\nrefused his earlier demand, hit Kametra in the head with a heavy object she\n\nbelieved was a gun, when she said she needed to leave. Later, when she\n\nconvinced appellant that she needed to return her sister’s car, appellant insisted\n\non going with her. When Kametra’s sister saw the bruised and bloody condition\n\nshe was in, she called the police. Appellant then grabbed Elijah and told Kametra\n\nshe and Jeremiah had to come with him or he would kill Elijah. When appellant\n\nsaw the police coming, he threw Elijah to the ground and took off running.\n\n      The jury also heard testimony concerning appellant’s actions during his\n\narrest for the instant offense. Appellant resisted when officers tried to handcuff\n\nhim, and it ultimately took four officers to restrain him. Appellant was tased three\n\ntimes before the officers were finally able to place him in handcuffs.\n\n      Moreover, while in jail awaiting his trial for capital murder, appellant\n\ncontinued to have disciplinary infractions and violent outbursts. On October 25,\n\n2011, appellant refused to comply with instructions from an officer when he was\n\ntold he was going to be moved to a different cell. Appellant refused to move and\n\n                                        177\n\ftold the officer that he would have to physically be picked up and moved to the\n\nother cell. Ultimately, appellant was picked up and moved by two officers.\n\n      On April 25, 2012, appellant refused to return a breakfast tray after\n\nreceiving a different breakfast from the one he ordinarily received. Appellant\n\nswung at Officer Thomas when the officer went into appellant’s cell to retrieve\n\nthe tray. It took approximately three to four officers to restrain the appellant.\n\n      On November 24, 2012, in a jail phone call to his brother Jamal, appellant\n\ntold his brother that the only reason he had not “fired off on some of these fools”\n\nwas because he wanted to keep up with his sports and visits.\n\n      Finally, on March 26, 2013, appellant fought with another inmate over the\n\ntelevision. Officer Moreno observed appellant and another inmate in a fighting\n\nstance. The other inmate received scratches to his chest and appellant was given\n\nfifteen days’ full restrictions following the fight.\n\n      It is clear that the State presented sufficient evidence of appellant’s future\n\ndangerousness. Appellant’s argument that he lacked any prior violent convictions\n\nwhich sent him to the penitentiary ignores the evidence presented by the State\n\nthat appellant had committed numerous unadjudicated violent assaults, including\n\nthe assaults against Kametra that occurred in the months preceding the instant\n\n                                           178\n\foffense. It also ignores the fact that he was on probation for aggravated assault\n\nwith a deadly weapon at the time he committed capital murder. Viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict, appellant’s criminal history – whether or not it\n\ninvolved trips to prison – evidence a violent, unrepentant man.\n\n      The state presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety. Thus, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury’s answer to\n\nthe future dangerousness special issue, and Issue 42 should be overruled.\n\n                    Issues 43-54: Federal Constitutional Issues\n\n      In Issues 43 through 54, appellant challenges the constitutionality of the\n\nTexas death penalty statute. He acknowledges that these issues have been\n\npreviously overruled and are asserted mainly to preserve each issue for further\n\nreview in the federal courts. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 128-36).\n\n      In Issue 43, appellant contends that the statute under which he was\n\nsentenced to death is unconstitutional in violation of the cruel and unusual\n\npunishment prohibition of the Eighth Amendment because it allows the jury too\n\nmuch discretion to determine who should live and who should die and because it\n\n                                         179\n\flacks the minimal standards and guidance necessary for the jury to avoid the\n\narbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty.\n\n      In Issue 44, appellant contends that the statute under which he was\n\nsentenced to death violates the due process requirements of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment because it implicitly puts the burden of proving the mitigation\n\nspecial issue on appellant rather than requiring a jury finding against appellant on\n\nthat issue under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.\n\n      In Issue 45, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to hold Article 37.071, § 2(e) and (f) concerning the burden of proof\n\nunconstitutional as a violation of Article I, §§ 10 and 13 of the Texas Constitution.\n\n      In Issue 46, appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme\n\nviolates due process protections of the United States Constitution because the\n\npunishment special issue related to mitigation fails to require the State to prove\n\nthe absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\ncontrary to Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and its progeny.\n\n      In Issue 47, appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme\n\nviolated his rights against cruel and unusual punishment and to due process of\n\nlaw under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States\n\n                                         180\n\fConstitution by requiring at least ten “no” votes for the jury to return a negative\n\nanswer to the punishment special issues.\n\n      In Issue 48, appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme\n\nviolated his rights against cruel and unusual punishment, to an impartial jury and\n\nto due process of law under the Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments of the\n\nUnited States Constitution because of vague, undefined terms in the jury\n\ninstructions at the punishment phase of the trial that effectively determine the\n\ndifference between a life sentence and the imposition of the death penalty.\n\n      In Issue 49, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to hold Art. 37.071, § 2(e) and (f) unconstitutional because said statute\n\nfails to require the issue of mitigation be considered by the jury.\n\n      In Issue 50, appellant contends that the mitigation special issue is\n\nunconstitutional because it fails to place the burden of proof on the State\n\nregarding aggravating evidence.\n\n      In Issue 51, he claims that the mitigation special issue is unconstitutional\n\nunder the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution\n\nbecause it permits the very type of open-ended discretion condemned by the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court in Furman v. Georgia, 408 U.S. 238 (1972).\n\n                                         181\n\f      In Issue 52, appellant contends that Texas’ statutory capital sentencing\n\nscheme is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments\n\nbecause it does not permit meaningful appellate review.\n\n      In Issue 53, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion to quash the indictment as being unconstitutional based on the\n\nenumerated constitutional defects of Texas capital-murder death-penalty law.\n\n      In Issue 54, he contends that the cumulative effect of the above-\n\nenumerated constitutional violations denied him due process of law in violation\n\nof the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\n\n      Appellant invites the Court to revisit its stand on these issues, which he\n\nconcedes have all been previously overruled.

Appellant presents fifty-\n\nfour allegations of reversible error.\n\n                               STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n                            A. Evidence at Guilt-Innocence\n\n      Kametra Sampson dated appellant for six years and they had three children\n\ntogether: Naim Muhammad, Elijah Muhammad, and Jeremiah Muhammad.\n\n(RR43: 76-77). Kametra ended her relationship with appellant in December of\n\n2010. (RR43: 77).\n\n\n\n                                        1\n\f      In August of 2011, Kametra and her sons were living with Kametra’s\n\nmother, Priscilla Sampson, on Terrell Street in Dallas. (RR43: 31-32, 59, 79-80).\n\nAlthough Kametra and appellant were broken up, appellant showed up at\n\nPriscilla’s annual back-to-school barbecue on August 20, 2011. (RR43: 33-37, 60,\n\n81). Kametra arrived late to the barbecue with the boys and her boyfriend, Eric\n\nSmith. (RR43: 34, 36-37, 87). Appellant confronted Kametra, telling her he did not\n\nwant another man raising his sons. (RR43: 38-39, 90-91). Kametra sent the boys\n\ninside the house and her argument with appellant escalated. (RR43: 39-40, 91).\n\nKametra’s grandfather intervened and asked appellant to leave. (RR43: 40, 61,\n\n91). Appellant returned later that evening with his mother to pick up the boys,\n\nbut Kametra and the boys were not home. (RR43: 41, 92).\n\n      Appellant returned to Priscilla’s house around 6:00 a.m. on the morning of\n\nAugust 22, 2011. (RR43: 42, 93). It was the first day of kindergarten for the eldest\n\nson, Naim. (RR43: 42, 62). Appellant asked to see his sons, but Priscilla would not\n\nlet him in. (RR43: 43, 93). Kametra came to the door and told appellant he was\n\nnot wanted there and needed to leave. (RR43: 22, 93-94). Priscilla’s neighbor,\n\nPhyllis Lewis, was outside when appellant arrived and overheard them exchange\n\n\n\n                                         2\n\fwords at the front door. (RR43: 22). About thirty minutes later, Phyllis saw\n\nappellant drive by the house on Terrell Street. (RR43: 15-16, 20-21).\n\n      Priscilla left the house with her youngest daughter, Jamie, to catch the bus\n\nand Kametra walked down Terrell Street toward Frazier Elementary with Naim\n\nand Elijah. (RR43: 44-45, 79, 95, 125). Kametra’s youngest son, Jeremiah, stayed\n\nhome with her brother, Brandon Turner. (RR43: 45, 64). As Kametra, Naim, and\n\nElijah reached the end of Terrell Street and crossed over Dolphin Street, appellant\n\nswerved in front of them and jumped out of the vehicle he was driving. (RR43: 96-\n\n97, 123-24). He demanded that they get in the car with him or he would hit\n\nKametra with a large rock he picked up off the ground. (RR43: 97-98, 124-25).\n\nKametra and the boys complied. (RR43: 98). Appellant continued driving in the\n\ndirection of the school, but when they reached the front of the school, appellant\n\nturned the opposite direction and told them that Naim wasn’t going to school\n\ntoday. (RR43: 100).\n\n      Kametra began crying and pleading with appellant to take Naim to school.\n\n(RR43: 100-01). Appellant drove erratically and alternated between telling\n\nKametra they needed to get back together and yelling, hitting her, and\n\nthreatening to kill her and the boys. (RR43: 102-03, 106, 112). After driving\n\n                                         3\n\faround for over an hour, they pulled up behind a constable near the intersection\n\nof Camp Wisdom and R. L. Thornton Freeway. (RR43: 104, 126). Kametra jumped\n\nout of the vehicle in the hopes of getting some help from the constable. (RR43:\n\n105-08). Appellant grabbed her, but she was able to pull away and escape. (RR43:\n\n109, 129). Kametra banged on the passenger window of the constable’s vehicle\n\nand begged for help. (RR43: 110). As the constable directed her to the Shell gas\n\nstation at the intersection, appellant swerved around the car in front of him,\n\njumped the curb, and sped through the red light. (RR43: 110-11, 127).\n\n      The constable pulled into the Shell gas station and called the police for\n\nKametra. (RR43: 112-13). Appellant’s sisters, Aqueelah Green and Sekinah\n\nMuhammad, were called and also came to the Shell gas station. (RR43: 114, 144,\n\n146). Kametra went with Aqueelah to her brother’s house nearby on Songwood\n\nStreet in the hopes of finding appellant, but he was not there and Aqueelah drove\n\nKametra back to the Shell station. (RR43: 115, 117, 147-48).\n\n      Shortly after dropping off Kametra, Aqueelah received a phone from\n\nappellant. (RR43: 150). When she asked where Naim and Elijah were, appellant\n\ntold her they were “gone with Abdullah.” (RR43: 150-51, 154). Abdullah was\n\nAqueelah’s and appellant’s eldest brother who was deceased. (RR43: 150-51, 159-\n\n                                        4\n\f60). When Aqueelah asked what appellant meant by that, he said, “They gone.\n\nThey are dead.” (RR43: 151, 153). Appellant hung up, but he called Aqueelah back\n\na short time later. (RR43: 152). Aqueelah was driving during the second phone call\n\nand arrived at her brother’s house on Songwood while she was still on the phone\n\nwith appellant. (RR43: 152-54). One of the police officers at the house asked her\n\nto switch on her speakerphone and gave her specific questions to ask appellant.\n\n(RR43: 154-55). At the officer’s direction, she asked appellant if he killed the kids\n\nand he replied, “Yes.” (RR43: 155). When she asked how he killed his kids, he said\n\nhe drowned them. (RR43: 155). He told her he killed Naim first and then Elijah.\n\n(RR43: 155). When she asked appellant where the kids were, he said he “didn’t\n\nknow” and that they were “in the creek somewhere.” (RR43: 155).\n\n      This information was still unknown to Kametra and her family. Priscilla\n\nreturned home around 10:00 a.m. and Kametra arrived shortly after her. (RR43:\n\n45-46, 68, 117). Kametra had a bloody nose, blood on her clothes, red and\n\nswollen eyes, and was very upset. (RR43: 46, 68, 117). She told Priscilla and\n\nBrandon about what had happened with appellant on the way to school. (RR43:\n\n46, 117). Brandon told them that appellant had tried to break into the house\n\nshortly before they got home. (RR43: 45-46, 68, 117). Brandon explained that he\n\n                                         5\n\fheard someone kick a window in the back of the house and break the glass.\n\n(RR43: 52-56, 65). He went to investigate and saw appellant trying to enter the\n\nhouse through the window. (RR43: 65). The window led into the room where\n\nJeremiah was sleeping. (RR43: 65). Brandon asked appellant what he was doing;\n\nwhen appellant did not respond and just kept trying to come in, Brandon pushed\n\nhim back out of the window. (RR43: 65-66, 73). After appellant picked himself up\n\nand was running away toward the back fence, he told Brandon: “Your nephews\n\nare dead now.” (RR43: 66-67, 70-71). Brandon did not think anything of it\n\nbecause he thought the boys were with Kametra on the way to school. (RR43: 67).\n\nWhen Brandon relayed this information to Kametra, she became hysterical.\n\n(RR43: 68-69, 117). They called 911 and Kametra left with the police officers who\n\nresponded to the call. (RR43: 47, 69, 117-18). Later that day, Priscilla was taken by\n\nofficers to Dallas Police headquarters. (RR43: 48). There, both she and Kametra\n\nlearned that Naim and Elijah were dead. (RR43: 48, 119).\n\n      Christal Fewell hung out with appellant at his brother’s house on Songwood\n\nStreet the night before the offense. (RR42: 143-46). Christal met appellant\n\nthrough her cousin and they had been dating for two to three months. (RR42:\n\n141-42). Appellant asked to borrow Christal’s car the next morning so he could\n\n                                         6\n\ftake his son to school. (RR42: 145). About an hour after appellant left, Christal got\n\nout of bed, showered, and then began to worry about the whereabouts of\n\nappellant and her car. (RR42: 150-51). A short time later she started receiving\n\nphone calls from appellant’s family members asking: “Where is Rasool?” (RR42:\n\n151-52). She also received a phone call from the Dallas Police Department and\n\nprovided them with a description of her car. (RR42: 154-55). When Christal was\n\nleaving the house on Songwood, she saw her car drive down the street in front of\n\nthe house. (RR42: 154-55). She immediately called the Dallas Police back and\n\nreported the sighting of her car. (RR42: 154-56). Appellant’s mother, Naimah\n\nMuhammad, pulled up to the house at this time and was looking for appellant.\n\n(RR42: 154-56). Shortly thereafter, several Dallas Police Officers also arrived at\n\nthe house. (RR42: 154-56). Christal received a phone call from appellant on her\n\ncell phone; however, he would not tell her his whereabouts and only wanted to\n\ntalk to his mother. (RR42: 157-58).\n\n      The police officers eventually left the house on Songwood to search for\n\nappellant, and Christal left with Naimah because she claimed to know the location\n\nof Christal’s car. (RR42: 158-59; RR43: 175). They drove down the street and\n\nappellant jumped into the backseat of Naimah’s car. (RR42: 160; RR43: 175).\n\n                                         7\n\fNaimah drove a short ways further and dropped Christal off at the location where\n\nappellant had left her car. (RR42: 161; RR43: 175-76). Naimah told Christal to hug\n\nand kiss her child when she got home and tell him she loved him. (RR42: 161,\n\n173). As Christal was driving home, she was pulled over by several police officers\n\nand taken to Dallas Police Headquarters for questioning, where she learned about\n\nthe events of the morning and what appellant had done. (RR42: 161-62). A search\n\nof Christal’s car revealed mud on the interior. (State’s Exhibits 25-36).\n\n      After Naimah dropped off Christal at her car, appellant told her where to\n\ndrive to find Naim and Elijah. (RR43: 176-77). From the service road of IH-35, they\n\nturned on Brookside Drive and drove to a heavily wooded area at the end of the\n\nroad with a steep incline down to a shallow creek. (RR43: 176-77, 186, 191-92,\n\n199-200). Naimah waited at the top next to a sewer manhole cover while\n\nappellant went down to the creek and retrieved the boys one at a time. (RR43:\n\n177-78, 194). Appellant brought Naim up from the creek first. (RR43: 178, 194).\n\nHe laid him on the ground and Naimah attempted to perform CPR. (RR43: 178-79,\n\n194). Appellant went back down and retrieved Elijah from the creek. (RR43: 179,\n\n194). After Naimah’s attempts at CPR were unsuccessful, appellant put both boys\n\nin the backseat of her vehicle. (RR43: 179-80). They left the creek and drove back\n\n                                          8\n\ftoward the house on Songwood, but before they arrived appellant jumped out of\n\nthe vehicle. (RR43: 180-81). Naimah pulled into a parking lot on Ledbetter Road.\n\n(RR43: 182). She saw an officer driving by, so she flagged him down and told him\n\nthat her grandbabies were in the back of her car. (RR43: 182-83). When the police\n\nsearched and photographed Naimah’s car, the backseat was muddy and wet.\n\n(RR43: 190).\n\n      Appellant was eventually captured by police later that day. Michael Yeric, a\n\nhomicide detective with the Dallas Police Department, interviewed appellant at\n\nthe police headquarters when he was brought into custody. (RR43: 209-14;\n\nState’s Exhibits 152-53, 167). Detective Yeric read appellant his rights, and\n\nappellant indicated that he wanted to waive those rights and speak with the\n\ndetective. (RR43: 217, 233-34, 237-38). Appellant told Detective Yeric that he had\n\nborrowed his friend Christal’s car that morning because he wanted to take his son\n\nto his first day of school. (RR43: 239). He went to Priscilla’s home around 6:30\n\na.m., but was not allowed to see his kids. (RR43: 239). Appellant found Kametra\n\nand the boys as they were walking to school, forced them into the car with him,\n\nand began driving around. (RR43: 239-40). As they approached Camp Wisdom on\n\nthe service road of R. L. Thornton freeway, appellant and Kametra saw a\n\n                                        9\n\fconstable’s car. (RR43: 241). Appellant told Kametra, “Don’t get out of this car,”\n\nand “if you jump out of this car, you don’t care about your kids.” (RR43: 241).\n\nKametra jumped out of the car and went to the passenger side of the constable’s\n\ncar, and appellant drove off. (RR43: 241). Appellant admitted to then driving to\n\nthe creek and drowning Naim and Elijah. (RR43: 220, 241).\n\n        When Detective Yeric visited the scene of the drowning, he noticed a\n\nsecurity camera mounted outside of Spirit Depot, a liquor store on the corner of\n\nBrookside Drive and the service road. (RR43: 221-22, 225). Detective Yeric\n\nobtained the video footage recorded by this camera on August 22, 2011. (RR43:\n\n221-22; State’s Exhibits 155-68). The video footage showed that appellant first\n\ndrove down Brookside Drive in Christal’s car at 8:53 a.m. and exited a short time\n\nlater. (RR43: 222-23, 230). It then showed Naimah’s car drive down Brookside\n\nDrive at 12:15 p.m. and exit a short time later. (RR43: 223, 230). This video\n\nfootage corroborated the information relayed to the detective by appellant,\n\nNaimah, and other witnesses they interviewed during their investigation. (RR43:\n\n233).\n\n        Dr. Tracy Dyer, a board-certified forensic pathologist and staff medical\n\nexaminer at the Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences (“SWIFS”), supervised\n\n                                       10\n\fthe autopsies of 3-year-old Elijah Muhammad and 5-year-old Naim Muhammad.\n\n(RR42: 115-39). Both Elijah and Naim arrived at SWIFS in wet clothing with dirt\n\nand debris scattered across their bodies. (RR42: 120-22, 134). Both boys had\n\nscratches on their heads and hands; additionally, Elijah had scratches on his back,\n\nlegs, and feet. (RR42: 120-26, 136-37; State’s Exhibits 4-8, 10-21, 24). The internal\n\nexamination revealed that Elijah had bruising on his scalp, dirt and debris in his\n\nairway, and an abundant amount of fluid in his lungs. (RR42: 126-30; State’s\n\nExhibits 22-24). Naim also had bruising on his scalp and fluid in his lungs. (RR42:\n\n137-38; State’s Exhibits 9-10). Dr. Dyer determined that the cause of death for\n\nboth Elijah and Naim was drowning and that their manner of death was homicide.\n\n(RR42: 130-31, 138-39; State’s Exhibits 10, 24).\n\n      After hearing this evidence, the jury returned a verdict of guilt in\n\napproximately eight minutes. (RR44: 34, 41).\n\n                       B. The State’s Punishment Evidence\n\n      During punishment, the State presented evidence showing that appellant’s\n\nexperience with the criminal justice system began at a young age and spanned a\n\nperiod of about twenty years. This evidence was presented through business\n\n\n\n                                         11\n\frecords of prior criminal convictions, as well as live testimony regarding various\n\nextraneous adjudicated and unadjudicated offenses.1\n\n       On January 30, 1993, appellant was arrested for burglary of a coin-operated\n\nmachine. (RR44: 111-12). Appellant and a cohort were removing quarters from a\n\nvacuum cleaner at a car wash. (RR44: 112-13). When Dallas Police Officer John\n\nJames and his partner arrived at the location, appellant and his cohort fled. (RR44:\n\n114). Appellant, who was thirteen years old at the time, was apprehended a few\n\nblocks away and taken to the juvenile jail. (RR44: 114-15).\n\n       On February 26, 1993, Ivis Wright, a single mother of three, returned home\n\nto find her back door had been kicked in and several items had been stolen from\n\nher home, including a VCR, Nintendo gaming system, a cordless phone, money,\n\nand candy. (RR44: 119-21). Five juvenile boys were apprehended fleeing Wright’s\n\nhome and placed under arrest for burglary. (RR44: 121, 124-27). Officer Chris\n\nHavens identified Naim Rasool Muhammad as one of the perpetrators. (RR44:\n\n127). On October 4, 1993, Dallas Police Officer David Solomon responded to a call\n\n\n\n1\n The judge gave both an oral and written instruction to the jury that they were not to consider\nextraneous offenses for any purpose unless they found and believed beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that appellant committed the offenses, if any were committed, and even then they could\nonly consider them in determining their answers to the special issues. (RR45: 41-42; CR2: 406).\n\n                                              12\n\freporting an auto theft in progress. (RR45: 82-84, 126-27). Officer Solomon pulled\n\nover a vehicle matching the description of one of the stolen vehicles and\n\nappellant was one of the passengers. (RR45: 86, 88, 127-28). Officer Solomon\n\ndetermined that the passengers were not involved in the reported auto theft;\n\nhowever, Officer Solomon arrested appellant because he had outstanding\n\nwarrants for two charges of burglary of a habitation, one of which was for the\n\nburglary Wright’s home. (RR45: 89, 97-99, 100-01, 103, 128-30).\n\n      On June 16, 1993, appellant was arrested for possession of a stolen vehicle.\n\n(RR45: 48-49, 51). Former Dallas Police Officer Sekethia Tejada pulled up behind a\n\nCadillac, ran the plates, and realized it was a stolen vehicle. (RR45: 48-49). When\n\nshe pulled the vehicle over, there were two young men inside; appellant, who\n\nwas fourteen years old at the time, was the passenger. (RR45: 50-51). The\n\nsteering column was broken and they had managed to start the engine without a\n\nkey. (RR45: 51).\n\n      On April 5, 1994, appellant committed burglary of a habitation. (RR44: 109;\n\nState’s Exhibit 170). On May 25, 1994, a juvenile Order of Adjudication and\n\nJudgment of Disposition with No Placement was entered and appellant was\n\nsentenced to 12 months’ probation. (RR44: 109; State’s Exhibit 170).\n\n                                        13\n\f      On July 27, 1994, Dallas Police received a call reporting a burglary of a\n\nvehicle that was in progress. (RR44: 140-41). Lieutenant Harold Andrews was\n\ndriving around the area where the burglary occurred and spotted appellant, who\n\nmatched the description of one of the suspects. (RR44: 142). Lt. Andrews\n\ndetained appellant and brought him back to the scene of the burglary, where he\n\nwas identified by the complainant as one of the perpetrators. (RR44: 142-43).\n\n      On August 18, 1994, appellant committed unauthorized use of a motor\n\nvehicle and evading arrest. (RR44: 108-09; State’s Exhibit 171). A juvenile Order of\n\nAdjudication and Judgment of Disposition with Placement was entered on\n\nSeptember 9, 1994, sentencing appellant to 12 months’ probation to be served in\n\nthe custody of Daytop Village. (RR44: 108-09; State’s Exhibit 171).\n\n      Daytop Village provides a 9-month program for 13 to 18 year olds and is\n\ndesigned to rehabilitate juveniles so that they do not end up in “the system.”\n\n(RR46: 9-11, 13). If a juvenile completes the program at Daytop, they are returned\n\nto their family; if not, they are sent to the Texas Youth Commission (“TYC”), a\n\ncorrectional facility for youth offenders. (RR46: 11, 13, 38). Youths attending\n\nDaytop are given multiple opportunities to succeed in the program. (RR46: 12-13,\n\n34). Daytop operates using the merit system and infractions are judged by peers,\n\n                                        14\n\fnot adults. (RR46: 10-11, 13). Daytop residents attend school, enjoy recreation\n\ntime, participate in group meetings, and also receive one-on-one counseling.\n\n(RR46: 17-18). During his stay at Daytop, appellant had many difficulties and was\n\nplaced on a behavior contract in an effort to change his aggressive behavior\n\ntoward other residents. (RR46: 16; State’s Exhibit 177). Despite this contract, on\n\nJuly 1, 1995, appellant physically assaulted another resident on two separate\n\noccasions. (RR46: 16-17, 26; State’s Exhibit 177). Due to the two new assaults, as\n\nwell as the prior infractions resulting in the behavior contract, the leaders of the\n\nprogram voted to discharge applicant from Daytop and send him to TYC. (RR46:\n\n16-19, 32-33; State’s Exhibit 177).\n\n      While in TYC, appellant committed multiple infractions. On September 16,\n\n1995, appellant was written up for disruptive behavior and threatening staff.\n\n(RR46: 83). After being repeatedly instructed to be quiet, appellant stated that he\n\nwould like to “beat somebody down.” (RR46: 83). He then looked at former TYC\n\ncorrectional officer Linda Parker and said “especially females.” (RR46: 81-83). On\n\nDecember 12, 1995, appellant was written up for disruption of the program and\n\npossession of razor blades and crushed aspirin. (RR46: 56, 59; State’s Exhibit 178).\n\nAccording to former TYC correctional officer Michael Jaco, the inmates snorted\n\n                                        15\n\fcrushed aspirin to get high and often used razor blades to create weapons. (RR46:\n\n52-53, 56-57). Appellant was trading the contraband for snacks. (RR46: 56, 63;\n\nState’s Exhibit 178). On January 11, 1996, appellant was written up multiple times\n\nfor aggressive behavior toward other inmates, disruptive behavior in the\n\nclassroom, disobeying staff, and calling a pregnant female correctional officer a\n\n“fat mother-fucker.” (RR46: 70-72). On August 17, 1996, appellant was written up\n\nfor a disruption on the volleyball court. (RR46: 77). When he was asked to leave,\n\nappellant became explosive and cursed at staff members. (RR46: 77). He called\n\nformer TYC correctional officer Kenneth Allen a “fat mother-fucker” and told him\n\n“fuck your mother.” (RR46: 74-75, 77-78). On August 27, 1996, appellant was\n\nwritten up for rubbing his erect penis against the leg of his teacher, Nina Adams.\n\n(RR47: 18-24). On September 15, 1996, appellant was written up for fighting.\n\n(RR46: 40-42). He and his cohort assaulted another inmate while he was being\n\nheld down on a toilet. (RR46: 40-42). On September 20, 1996, he was written up\n\nfor being disruptive in the dining hall. (RR46: 78-79).\n\n      According to former correctional officer Gail Hamilton, appellant was not a\n\nlaw abiding person while at TYC. (RR46: 36-37, 46). Many of the correctional\n\n\n\n                                          16\n\fofficers at TYC tried to talk to appellant and encourage him to stop the\n\nprogression of his criminal behavior to no avail. (RR46: 44-45, 54-55).\n\n        Appellant was released from TYC in December of 1996 and resumed his\n\ncriminal activity shortly thereafter. On July 30, 1997, appellant committed\n\nburglary of a vehicle and evading arrest. (RR44: 109; State’s Exhibits 172, 173). On\n\nSeptember 19, 1997, he pleaded guilty to each offense and was sentenced to 12\n\nmonths’ probation in each case, but he was subsequently revoked for failing to\n\ncomply with the conditions of his probation. (State’s Exhibit 172, 173).\n\n        On December 4, 1997, appellant committed theft at a Lowe’s store in Collin\n\nCounty. (RR44: 108; State’s Exhibit 174). On September 28, 1998, he pleaded\n\nguilty to the charge and was sentenced to probation for one year, but he was\n\nsubsequently revoked and sentenced to 180 days’ confinement. (State’s Exhibit\n\n174).\n\n        On January 27, 1998, appellant committed burglary of a vehicle. (RR44:\n\n109-10; State’s Exhibit 175). On February 11, 1998, he pleaded guilty to the\n\ncharge and was sentenced to 180 days’ confinement. (RR44: 109-10; State’s\n\nExhibit 175).\n\n\n\n                                         17\n\f      On July 4, 1999, Garland Police Officer Brandon Hernandez and several\n\nother officers responded to a burglary alarm at a car lot off Forest Lane in Dallas.\n\n(RR45: 60-63). Officer Hernandez and his partner spotted appellant walking away\n\nfrom the business toward a suspicious vehicle that was running but did not have\n\nits lights on. (RR45: 63-64). When another officer approached the vehicle on foot,\n\nthe vehicle sped away. (RR45: 64-65). Officer Hernandez and his partner chased\n\nthe vehicle and made a felony traffic stop. (RR45: 65). Appellant and two other\n\npassengers were removed from the vehicle and the officers found a loaded\n\nshotgun inside. (RR45: 65-66). They also found a bag of marijuana and a\n\nscrewdriver, a common burglary tool, just outside the vehicle that appeared to\n\nhave been thrown out by the passengers. (RR45: 66-67). When the officers\n\nchecked appellant’s name and date of birth in their system, they discovered he\n\nhad outstanding felony and probation warrants. (RR45: 69, 70-71). All three\n\npassengers of the vehicle were arrested. (RR45: 70-71).\n\n      On April 7, 2001, Jeanette Harris, appellant’s next door neighbor at the\n\ntime, caught appellant peeping at her through the bathroom window when she\n\nwas in the shower. (RR45: 43-45). When Harris confronted appellant about the\n\n\n\n                                        18\n\fincident, he threatened to “whip *her+ ass.” (RR45: 45-46). Harris called the police\n\nand appellant fled. (RR46: 45).\n\n      On April 20, 2009, Dallas Police Officer Ryan Foster and his partner\n\nresponded to a disturbance call in South Dallas. (RR45: 132-33, 140). Sekinah\n\nMuhammad, appellant’s sister, was upset and was bleeding from the back of her\n\nhead. (RR45: 133-35). Appellant and Sekinah had gotten into an argument. (RR47:\n\n28-29). When appellant refused to leave, Sekinah came toward appellant with a\n\nhammer. (RR47: 28-29, 32-33). Appellant took the hammer from her and hit her\n\nin the head with it two times. (RR45: 138-39; RR47: 28-29, 32-35). Appellant was\n\napprehended a few blocks away from the offense and arrested for assault. (RR45:\n\n138-40).\n\n      Appellant pleaded guilty to the aggravated assault of his sister and was\n\nplaced on probation on September 15, 2009. (RR46: 141-43, 147; RR47: 37; RR49:\n\n99-100; State’s Exhibit 185). Appellant violated the conditions of his probation on\n\nmany occasions. He was ordered to wear an electronic monitoring device on\n\nSeptember 25, 2009, but was arrested four days later for failing to comply with\n\nthe electronic monitoring requirements. (RR46: 143-44). Over the next nine\n\nmonths, appellant failed to comply with several other conditions of his probation\n\n                                        19\n\fby testing positive during multiple urinalysis tests, failing to regularly report to his\n\nprobation officer, failing to complete any community service hours, failing to\n\ncomplete anger management, failing to attend Narcotics Anonymous meetings,\n\nand failing to pay the required fees and court costs. (RR46: 144, 148-49, 150-51).\n\nDespite these numerous violations, in June of 2010, appellant was continued on\n\nprobation and sent to an intermediate sanctions facility (“ISF”) to complete a\n\ncognitive track program. (RR46: 152, 163). Appellant completed the program and\n\nwas released in January of 2011; however, one month later he was arrested for a\n\nfamily violence assault against Kametra and absconded from probation for the\n\nnext five months. (RR46: 152-53). He had a warrant out for his arrest for violating\n\nhis probation at the time he was arrested the instant offense on August 22, 2011.\n\n(RR46: 154).\n\n      Appellant did not voluntarily turn himself in after drowning his two sons.\n\nHe evaded police for most of the day, but was eventually captured. After the\n\nboys’ bodies were found in the back of Naimah’s car, several police officers set up\n\na perimeter of the area and continued to search for appellant with the assistance\n\nof the helicopter unit. (RR46: 104, 107-11). Eventually appellant was spotted on\n\nfoot, and five to six officers pursued him in a foot-chase. (RR46: 111-12). They\n\n                                          20\n\ffinally captured him in the bottom of an empty creek bed and appellant resisted\n\narrest by fighting, pushing and kicking the officers. (RR46: 112-13). The officers\n\nhad to use a Taser at least three times in order to gain control and place him in\n\nhandcuffs. (RR46: 113-14).\n\n      While confined in Dallas County Jail and awaiting trial for capital murder,\n\nappellant had several disciplinary violations. On October 25, 2011, when appellant\n\nwas instructed that he would be changing cells, he refused and had to be forcibly\n\nmoved to another cell by two guards. (RR47: 101-03). Appellant was given five\n\ndays of restrictions as a result, which meant that he was moved into a single cell\n\nand not allowed to go to the commissary, have visitation, or make personal phone\n\ncalls other than to his attorney for five days. (RR47: 105). On April 25, 2012,\n\nappellant was unhappy about the tray of food he was served and refused to\n\nreturn the plastic tray until the guard served him another tray. (RR47: 104). When\n\nthe guards went into appellant’s cell to cease the food tray, appellant swung at\n\none of them and the guards had to use force to detain him. (RR47: 104-05). As a\n\nresult of this infraction, appellant was given twenty-five days of restrictions.\n\n(RR47: 105). On March 26, 2013, appellant was written up for fighting another\n\ninmate and received fifteen days of restrictions. (RR47: 111-12). On November 24,\n\n                                       21\n\f2012, in a jail phone call to his brother Jamal, appellant told his brother that the\n\nonly reason he had not “fired off on some of these fools” was because he wanted\n\nto keep up with his sports and visits. (RR47: 136–38; State’s Exhibit 184).\n\n      In addition to appellant’s lengthy history of criminal behavior and\n\ndisrespect toward any person of authority, the State also presented evidence of\n\nappellant’s violence toward Kametra throughout their relationship. Kametra met\n\nappellant in the summer of 2005 when she was fifteen years old and they began\n\ndating. (RR46: 169-70). They had been dating for two to three weeks when\n\nappellant became violent with her. (RR46: 176). The first incident of violence\n\nhappened in the backyard of appellant’s house following a verbal argument.\n\n(RR46: 177). Kametra told appellant she was leaving and he grabbed her, threw\n\nher in the back seat of his car, hit her with his fists multiple times, and told her\n\nshe was not leaving. (RR46: 177-78).\n\n      Appellant’s violence toward Kametra occurred once or twice a week in the\n\nbeginning of their relationship, but escalated over the last few years they were\n\ntogether. (RR46: 179-80, 202). If Kametra burnt the rice, stayed outside too long\n\nwith her sister, spoke disrespectfully to appellant, or questioned appellant about\n\nthe way he was spending her money, appellant responded with physical abuse.\n\n                                         22\n\f(RR46: 202-03, 210-13). When Kametra found out she was pregnant with their\n\nfirst child, Naim, appellant became upset and asked her to have an abortion.\n\n(RR46: 186-87, 188-89). He also encouraged her to drink bleach or attempt to\n\nabort the baby using a wire hanger. (RR46: 188). When Kametra refused to abort\n\nthe baby, he punched and kicked her in the stomach in an effort to make her have\n\na miscarriage. (RR46: 187-88, 191). Appellant repeated this abusive behavior\n\nwhen Kametra became pregnant with Elijah. (RR46: 195-96). Kametra’s sister,\n\nGabrielle Armstead (“Gabby”), witnessed the abuse and repeatedly encouraged\n\nKametra to leave appellant. (RR46: 210-13).\n\n      In December of 2010, Kametra had grown tired of appellant being in and\n\nout of jail, failing to work, and being physically abusive towards her, so she\n\ndecided to leave him. (RR46: 218-20). She and the boys left with her sister Gabby\n\nand stayed in a motel. (RR46: 221-22). For the next few months, they bounced\n\naround between the motel, shelters, and Priscilla’s house. (RR46: 221-23, 225).\n\nKametra resorted to prostitution in order to make money for food, diapers, the\n\nmotel, and her newly developed drug addiction. (RR46: 222, 224). After a few\n\nmonths, Kametra checked into Nexus, a drug abuse treatment facility, and\n\nreceived the help she needed. (RR46: 222, 224-25, 249-51). Despite the hard\n\n                                       23\n\ftimes she encountered over the months after leaving appellant, she knew that\n\nleaving him was the right decision and never got back together with him. (RR46:\n\n222).\n\n        After the breakup, appellant continued to use violence to make Kametra\n\ncomply with his demands. In February of 2011, when Kametra and the boys were\n\nwere staying with her mother, appellant came over and wanted to take Naim and\n\nElijah with him. (RR46: 228-30). When Kametra told him no, appellant punched\n\nKametra in the face, grabbed Naim from inside the house, and kicked in the side\n\ndoor of the house to escape. (RR46: 230-35). Kametra called the police, who\n\nlocated appellant a short time later and brought Naim home. (RR46: 233-36).\n\n        In March of 2011, Kametra borrowed Gabby’s car to pick up the boys from\n\nappellant’s house. (RR46: 236-37). Appellant insisted that Kametra take him to\n\nthe store and got in the car with them. (RR46: 239). When Kametra refused,\n\nappellant choked her until she passed out. (RR46: 240). She awoke inside\n\nappellant’s house and when she attempted to leave, appellant hit her in the head\n\nwith a heavy object. (RR46: 241). Kametra finally convinced appellant to let her\n\nreturn Gabby’s car. (RR46: 242-43). When they exited the car, Gabby saw that\n\nKametra was bleeding and called the police. (RR46: 243). Appellant was carrying\n\n                                       24\n\fElijah and threatened to kill him if Kametra did not go with him. (RR46: 245-46).\n\nThe police were driving around searching for appellant and when they spotted\n\nhim, appellant took off running. (RR46: 247). Initially he was still holding Elijah,\n\nbut he threw him down and kept running. (RR46: 247-48). Following this incident,\n\nCPS instructed Kametra that appellant was not allowed to have unsupervised\n\nvisitation with the boys. (RR46: 250).\n\n      In light of this history, Kametra was afraid of appellant and believed his\n\nthreats to kill her, Naim, and Elijah on the day of the offense. (RR46: 252).\n\nKametra believed that if she had done anything differently that day, the outcome\n\nwould be worse and they would all be dead right now. (RR46: 252). She also\n\nbelieves that Jeremiah would be dead if Brandon had not been at her mother’s\n\nhouse that morning. (RR46: 252).\n\n      Since the day of the offense, appellant has continued to blame others for\n\nhis actions. At the end of his police interview, appellant asked Detective Yeric to\n\ntell Kametra that she was the reason he did it. (RR47: 118). While in jail, appellant\n\nwrote a letter to Kametra’s mother stating, “I wished that I could have just talked\n\nto [Kametra] about this, but she should have never jumped out of the car and did\n\nwhat she did...this may sound crazy, but tell her I love her still and wish she would\n\n                                         25\n\fhave just listened to me that day because I didn’t want this to happen.” (RR46:\n\n256; State’s Exhibit 42).\n\n                        C. Appellant’s Punishment Evidence\n\n        At punishment, appellant presented evidence of the neglect, violence, and\n\nsexual abuse he suffered during his childhood. Appellant had five siblings:\n\nAbdullah, Jamal, Aqueelah, Sekinah, and Rashad. (RR47: 140, 169-70, 183-84).\n\nTheir mother, Naimah, was married to Roger Mopping when the children were\n\nyoung, until about the time that Jamal was in fifth grade. (RR47: 141, 170-71).\n\nRoger was the biological father of Jamal and Aqueelah. (RR47: 141, 183, 233,\n\n248). Abdullah and appellant were told that their biological father was a man\n\nnamed Lynn, but no one knew for sure. (RR47: 149-50, 154, 183-84, 233, 248-49).\n\nNone of them knew who the biological father of Sekinah or Rashad was. (RR47:\n\n149, 162-63, 184, 248-49). Naimah was a drug-addicted prostitute who was rarely\n\nhome. (RR47: 148, 150, 184-86, 231, 235-36; RR48: 31, 38-39, 47). Roger also\n\nbecame addicted to drugs. (RR47: 149-50, 186, 234-35, 238). Roger loved Naimah\n\nbut eventually left her because she kept getting pregnant by other men. (RR47:\n\n249).\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\f      After Roger left, Naimah and the children moved in with Naimah’s mother\n\nDorothy May Butler (“Madea”), who was confined to a wheelchair. (RR47: 152-53,\n\n187-88). Even though Madea was crippled and regularly needed assistance from\n\nthe children, this was the only stable portion of their childhood that they could\n\nrecall. (RR47: 152-53, 187-88). After Madea passed away, Naimah was married to\n\nJoe Johnson for a short time. (RR47: 142, 159). While Joe did work and put a roof\n\nover their head, he was an alcoholic and appeared to care more about his hogs\n\nthan the children. (RR47: 159-61, 198-99, 245; RR48: 47). When Joe left Naimah,\n\nthe children lived with a variety of different people. (RR47: 161, 164, 193, 206-08;\n\nRR48: 29, 45). The girls were taken in by family members and somewhat\n\nprotected; however, the boys, who were all already involved in the juvenile\n\nsystem, were forced to fend for themselves. (RR47: 164, 177, 207; RR48: 29-30,\n\n45-46, 52, 55). According to Jamal, they ate out of dumpsters and resorted to\n\ncrime to make money. (RR47: 164-65).\n\n      Throughout their childhood, appellant and his siblings were regularly\n\nexposed to drugs and violence in their home. Naimah, her brothers, and her\n\nsister, Tina, drank alcohol and smoked cracked cocaine together at the house and\n\nthese binges frequently ended with violent fights. (RR47: 167, 194-95; RR48: 39,\n\n                                        27\n\f42-43). Naimah and Tina fought the most, and Tina was sent to prison for twenty\n\nyears for stabbing Naimah in the face during one of their arguments. (RR47: 156-\n\n57, 195-97; RR48: 42). Naimah was also violent toward the children when she\n\nbelieved they were taking her drugs away. (RR47: 166, 189-92).\n\n      The children were also victims of sexual abuse. Abdullah, the eldest\n\nbrother, sexually assaulted Aqueelah, Sekinah and appellant. (RR47: 202-03;\n\nRR48: 40-41). Aqueelah and Sekinah recalled that he would frequently come into\n\ntheir room at night and rub his penis on them, fondle them, and ejaculate on\n\nthem. (RR47: 202-03; RR48: 40-41). According to appellant, Abdullah played with\n\nhis penis and made appellant play with his. (Defendant’s Exhibit 11). Appellant\n\nalso reported that he was sexually abused around age four or five by an older\n\nwoman who asked him to have sex with her. (Defendant’s Exhibit 11).\n\n      Both Aqueelah and Sekinah graduated from high school due to the\n\nguidance they received from the friends and relatives who helped take care of\n\nthem in Naimah’s absence. (RR48: 31-32, 37). However, no one encouraged the\n\nboys to attend school or stay out of trouble. (RR47: 204; RR48: 31-32, 46). To the\n\ncontrary, the eldest brother, Abdullah, taught Jamal to steal and commit crimes,\n\nand that way of life was then passed on to appellant and Rashad. (RR47: 153-55,\n\n                                       28\n\f205; RR48: 32). Like appellant, Abdullah, Jamal and Rashad were involved in a\n\nnumber of juvenile and adult crimes and spent time in prison. (RR47: 157-58, 163,\n\n205-06; RR48: 29). Abdullah was shot in the chest when he was eighteen years old\n\nand survived; however, he died from complications related to that gunshot\n\nwound in January of 2011. (RR47: 158).\n\n      With regard to appellant’s medical history, the defense presented evidence\n\nthat appellant was struck by an automobile around age three and had to go to the\n\nhospital. (RR48: 177-78; Defendant’s Exhibit 11). In 2009, appellant started having\n\nbrain seizures and has been receiving treatment for epilepsy since that time.\n\n(RR48: 178-79; Defendant’s Exhibit 11).\n\n      Dr. Gilbert Martinez, a clinical neuropsychologist, was hired by the defense\n\nto test appellant’s cognitive and intellectual functioning. (RR48: 100-02). In order\n\nto form the opinions offered by his testimony, Dr. Martinez examined appellant’s\n\nmedical records and a previous psychological evaluation conducted in 1994 when\n\nappellant was in the juvenile system. He also conducted a clinical interview of\n\nappellant and administered a battery of psychological tests on appellant. (RR48:\n\n102-04, 106-07, 111-12, 141; Defendant’s Exhibit 11). With regard to his\n\nintellectual functioning, appellant received a full-scale IQ score of 76. (RR48: 114-\n\n                                          29\n\f16, 124-25; Defendant’s Exhibit 11). According to Dr. Martinez, appellant is not\n\nmentally retarded, but his IQ score falls in the borderline range of intellectual\n\nfunctioning. (RR48: 114-16, 124-25, 133; Defendant’s Exhibit 11).\n\n        With regard to appellant’s cognitive functioning, Dr. Martinez diagnosed\n\nappellant with mild neurocognitive disorder. (RR48: 122-24; Defendant’s Exhibit\n\n11). Appellant does not have severe cognitive or memory deficits, but he does\n\nhave deficits in executive functioning. (RR48: 118-19, 122-24, 133). Dr. Martinez\n\nexplained that a person with deficits in executive functioning has poor judgment\n\nand reasoning and may have difficulty making decisions, controlling their thinking\n\nand behavior, and learning from their mistakes. (RR48: 111, 123-24, 126-27, 134-\n\n35, 164-65). Dr. Martinez believes that appellant’s deficits in executive\n\nfunctioning may be due to the combined effect of his epilepsy, the head injury he\n\nsustained as a child, and the lack of emotional support he received as a child.\n\n(RR48: 127-29, 133; Defendant’s Exhibit 11). Appellant’s chronic drug use could be\n\na contributor to his deficits in executive functioning, or appellant’s choice to use\n\ndrugs could be the result of those deficits and his poor judgment. (RR48: 131,\n\n133).\n\n\n\n                                        30\n\f      Dr. Kellie Gray-Smith testified as an expert on special education and the\n\nmulticultural aspects of psychology. (RR49: 11-14). Dr. Gray-Smith, a licensed\n\npsychologist and licensed specialist in school psychology, is currently employed as\n\nthe special education coordinator for Plano Independent School District. (RR49:\n\n11-12). In her field of study, it is well-documented that different cultures treat the\n\nintervention and treatment of medical, mental health, and educational needs\n\ndifferently. (RR49: 15, 59). With regards to special education, there has\n\nhistorically been distrust within the African-American community of special\n\neducation services and a negative stigma attached to a child who accepts those\n\nservices. (RR49: 15-16, 59). These beliefs are often perpetuated by black leaders,\n\nespecially in the church. (RR49: 16).\n\n      Special education was developed and designed to address students’\n\nacademic, emotional-behavioral, and social needs. (RR49: 17). She explained that\n\nacademic failure can develop for a number a reasons and it is not uncommon for\n\nan emotional disturbance to cause academic failure or vice versa. (RR49: 18-19,\n\n59-60). Many behaviors – such as fighting, profanity, disrespect, and non-\n\ncompliance – are perceived to be choice-based behaviors when sometimes they\n\nare actually caused by an underlying emotional, behavioral, or academic\n\n                                         31\n\fdisability. (RR49: 19-20). Literature shows that students whose needs are not\n\nrecognized and addressed by an early age are at risk for chronic school failure,\n\nremoval from school, school dropout, unemployment, substance abuse, criminal\n\nactivity, and confinement in the penitentiary. (RR49: 21-24). If there is no\n\nintervention or treatment, the student can develop oppositional defiant disorder,\n\nconduct disorder and, eventually, anti-social personality disorder. (RR49: 42-43,\n\n45). According to Dr. Gray-Smith, it is common for people with this behavior\n\npattern to end up in jail. (RR49: 43-44, 73). This is what is known within the\n\npsychological community as the “school-to-prison pipeline,” and it is most\n\nprevalent with African-American males. (RR49: 44).\n\n      Dr. Gray-Smith reviewed appellant’s school records, the psychological\n\nevaluation done in 1994 when appellant was a juvenile, and the report of Dr.\n\nGilbert Martinez. (RR49: 26-27, 41). Dr. Gray-Smith testified that appellant’s\n\nschool records demonstrate that appellant experienced chronic school failure\n\nstarting in elementary school that went unaddressed. (RR49: 29-30, 33). In her\n\nopinion, this pattern of school failure was consistent with oppositional defiant\n\ndisorder. (RR49: 56-57). She believed appellant’s behavioral problems continued\n\nand escalated due to the school district’s failure to provide effective intervention\n\n                                        32\n\fand assistance to appellant. (RR49: 30-31, 33, 35, 61). In her opinion, appellant’s\n\nschool and psychological records suggest that he has anti-social personality\n\ndisorder. (RR49: 58, 66-67, 72).\n\n                         D. The State’s Rebuttal Evidence\n\n      Melodye Nelson, a 24-year veteran of the Texas Department of Criminal\n\nJustice-Institutional Division (“TDCJ”), testified as an expert on the prison system\n\nin Texas. (RR49: 101-47). Warden Nelson previously worked as a correctional\n\nofficer on death row and is now the senior warden over the Mountain View and\n\nHilltop female prison facilities. (RR49: 101-02). Warden Nelson testified generally\n\nabout how inmates are classified and housed and the opportunity for violence\n\nwithin the prison system. (RR49: 102-47).\n\n      She explained that general population inmates are classified as a “G1”\n\nthrough “G5,” with G1’s and G2’s being the inmates with the least amount of\n\nsupervision. (RR49: 105, 123). There is also administrative segregation and death\n\nrow, which are much more restrictive. (RR49: 105, 123, 135). An inmate’s initial\n\nclassification is not based on the crime committed, but rather on the sentence\n\nreceived, his behavior during any previous incarceration, and whether he is a\n\nmember of a documented gang. (RR49: 105, 123-24, 126-28, 140). An inmate\n\n                                        33\n\fserving a sentence of 50 years or more who has served less than ten years is\n\nautomatically going to be classified as a G3. (RR49: 109, 124). That person can\n\nmove up or down within the classification system depending on their behavior.\n\n(RR49: 110-11, 127-31, 135-36, 146-47). This means a person convicted of capital\n\nmurder and sentenced to life without parole and who is not a documented\n\nmember of a gang would be classified as a G3; the only distinction, however, is\n\nthat person would never move down below a G3 classification. (RR49: 107, 109-\n\n10, 111-12, 125-26).\n\n      Inmates classified as G1’s, G2’s and G3’s live in dormitories or cell blocks\n\nand can walk around unescorted throughout their prison facility. (RR49: 105-06,\n\n107, 14-41). A capital murderer sentenced to life without parole who is classified\n\nas a G3 can shower, work, eat, go to school, go to the library and recreate like any\n\nother G3 in the general population. (RR49: 107, 109). In contrast, inmates on\n\ndeath row are housed in single cells and confined approximately 23 hours per\n\nday. (RR49: 114). They are allowed visitation and limited recreation, but they are\n\nstrip-searched prior to leaving their cell and are always escorted in restraints with\n\ntwo correctional officers. (RR49: 114).\n\n\n\n                                          34\n\f      According to Warden Nelson, the Texas prison system is a well-run\n\norganization. (RR49: 121, 143). Nonetheless, there is an opportunity for violence\n\nthroughout the prisons, regardless of classification level. (RR49: 112, 118, 131,\n\n144). Even on death row, the most secure unit in Texas, violence occurs. (RR49:\n\n112-13). Whether an inmate will commit acts of violence depends on the\n\nindividual inmate and his demeanor. (RR49: 133-34, 136, 142). Inmates get\n\ncreative in making weapons and use whatever they have access to, including\n\ntypewriter rods, nails, screws, rocks, and sharpened chicken or pork bones. (RR49:\n\n115-17).\n\n                           SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\n      Issues 1-20: The trial court properly denied appellant’s challenges for cause\n\nagainst twenty prospective jurors. All of the denials were proper, and appellant\n\nhas not shown that he was denied the use of a statutorily provided peremptory\n\nchallenge.\n\n      Issues 21-22: Appellant’s argument that he was deprived of a lawfully\n\nconstituted jury lacks merit. Appellant has failed to prove that any of the trial\n\ncourt’s rulings on any of the challenges resulted in the seating of a juror who was\n\nbiased or prejudiced.\n\n                                        35\n\f      Issues 23-26: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting\n\nautopsy photographs of the victims. The photographs were relevant and\n\nnecessary to assist the medical examiner with her testimony and to link the\n\nvictims to this testimony, and their probative value was not outweighed by the\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice\n\n      Issues 27 and 41: The trial court properly overruled appellant’s objections\n\nto the State’s closing argument during both the guilt-innocence and punishment\n\nphases of trial because the complained-of arguments fell within the permissible\n\nareas of argument. Further, given the overwhelming evidence supporting the\n\njury’s guilty verdict and their answers to the special issues, any error was\n\nharmless.\n\n      Issue 28: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting testimony\n\nregarding appellant’s statements to CPS investigator Pamela Womack. Because\n\nWomack was not an agent of law enforcement, she was not required to comply\n\nwith Miranda.\n\n      Issue 29: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting State’s\n\nExhibit 173, certified business records pertaining to appellant’s 1997 conviction\n\n\n\n                                        36\n\ffor evading arrest. The totality of the evidence sufficiently linked appellant to the\n\nconviction.\n\n      Issues 30-32: The trial court properly overruled appellant’s objections to\n\nthe testimony of police officers Chris Havens, Harold Andrews, and Brandon\n\nHernandez. These officers properly used police reports to refresh their memory\n\nand then testified from their refreshed memory.\n\n      Issues 33 and 37: The trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting\n\nthe testimony of Officer David Solomon regarding his arrest of appellant. His\n\ntestimony was relevant to link appellant to an unadjudicated burglary offense\n\npreviously presented by the State, and it did not leave a false impression that\n\nappellant was involved in a different offense.\n\n      Issue 34: The trial court properly admitted the expert testimony of Warden\n\nMelodye Nelson as her testimony was relevant and helpful to the jury in deciding\n\nthe first special issue. Alternatively, any error in the admission of this testimony\n\nwas harmless.\n\n      Issue 35: The trial court satisfied its duty to conduct a threshold\n\ndetermination of the admissibility of extraneous offenses. Any error in the trial\n\ncourt’s failure to grant appellant’s request for a separate hearing was harmless\n\n                                         37\n\fbecause the State clearly proved each extraneous offense presented during the\n\npunishment phase.\n\n      Issue 36: Where the trial court granted appellant’s request and instructed\n\nthe jury to disregard inadmissible testimony, it did not abuse its discretion in\n\ndenying appellant’s motion for mistrial.\n\n      Issues 38 and 39: Appellant failed to preserve his complaints regarding the\n\ncross-examination of his experts for appellate review. In any event, the trial court\n\ndid not err by permitting the State to cross-examine Dr. Kellie Gray-Smith and Dr.\n\nGilbert Martinez regarding antisocial personality disorder, an issue within their\n\narea of expertise and clearly relevant to appellant’s death-worthiness.\n\n      Issue 40: The trial court’s statement regarding sequestration was not an\n\nimproper comment on the weight of the evidence. Regardless, appellant was not\n\nharmed by the trial court’s comment because it was not calculated to benefit the\n\nState or prejudice appellant’s rights.\n\n      Issue 42: The evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury’s answer to\n\nthe future dangerousness special issue. Based upon the facts of the instant\n\noffense, as well as the evidence of appellant’s past acts of crime and violence, a\n\n\n\n                                           38\n\frational jury could find that appellant would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety.\n\n      Issues 43-54: Appellant’s admittedly meritless federal constitutional\n\nchallenges to the Texas death penalty statute are presented only to preserve the\n\ncomplaints for federal habeas review. And while appellant invites this Court to\n\nrevisit its prior holdings against his position, he provides no new authority for this\n\nCourt or the State to address.\n\n                                     ARGUMENT\n\n               Issues 1-20: Denial of Defense Challenges For Cause\n\n      In issues 1 through 20, appellant claims the trial court violated statutory\n\nand constitutional law by erroneously causing him to use all fifteen of his\n\nstatutorily allotted peremptory strikes plus two additional strikes on persons who\n\nshould have been removed for cause. Moreover, he contends that the trial court\n\nforced him to accept an objectionable juror after denying his request for\n\nadditional strikes. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 20-87).\n\n      The trial court properly denied all of appellant’s challenges for cause. Thus,\n\nhis contentions are without merit and should be overruled.\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\f                                  Applicable Law\n\n      A veniremember may be challenged for cause if, among other reasons, he\n\npossesses a bias or prejudice in favor of or against the defendant or he possesses\n\na bias against an aspect of the law upon which the State or the defendant is\n\nentitled to rely.

Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n      Appellant has the burden of establishing that his challenge for cause is\n\nproper. See Feldman v.

Crim. App. 2002). Before a\n\nprospective juror can be excused for bias, the law must be explained to him and\n\nhe must be asked whether he can follow that law regardless of his personal views.\n\nThreadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667. Appellant does not meet his burden of establishing\n\nthat his challenge for cause is proper until he has shown that the veniremember\n\nunderstood the requirement of the law and could not overcome his prejudice well\n\nenough to follow it. See Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 747.\n\n                                         40\n\f      When reviewing a trial court’s decision to deny a challenge for cause, the\n\nappellate court looks at the entire record to determine if there is sufficient\n\nevidence to support the ruling. Feldman, 71 S.W.3d at 744. The appellate court\n\nreviews a trial court’s ruling with “considerable” or “great” deference because the\n\ntrial judge is in the best position to evaluate the prospective juror’s demeanor and\n\nwas present to observe the juror and listen to his tone of voice. Saldano v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685878\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685878/saldano-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 91 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007); Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\nParticular deference is given when the prospective juror’s answers are vacillating,\n\nunclear, or contradictory. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667. The appellate court\n\nreverses a trial court’s ruling on a challenge for cause “only if a clear abuse of\n\ndiscretion is evident.” Colburn v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2377988\"><a href=\"/opinion/2377988/colburn-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 517 (Tex. Crim. App.\n\n1998). When the venireperson is persistently uncertain about his or her ability to\n\nfollow the law, the reviewing court does not second guess the trial court. Id.\n\n      To prevail on a claim of erroneous denial of a challenge for cause, the\n\ndefendant must object to the trial court that he is compelled to try his case with\n\nat least one individual on the jury who he would have removed with a\n\nperemptory challenge had one been available to him. Harm from the erroneous\n\ndenial of a defense challenge for cause occurs: (1) when a defendant uses a\n\n                                        41\n\fperemptory challenge to remove a veniremember whom the trial court should\n\nhave excused for cause at the defendant’s request, (2) the defendant uses all of\n\nhis statutorily allotted peremptory challenges, and (3) the defendant\n\nunsuccessfully requests an additional peremptory challenge which he claims he\n\nwould use to remove another veniremember whom the defendant identifies as\n\n“objectionable” and who actually sits on the jury. Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 91.\n\nWhen this occurs, the trial court’s erroneous denial of a challenge for cause\n\nharms the defendant by wrongfully depriving him of at least one of his statutory\n\nperemptory challenges that he could have used to remove the juror whom he has\n\nidentified as objectionable. Id.\n\n      The parties asserted their challenges for cause and peremptory challenges\n\nat the conclusion of each prospective juror’s individual voir dire. Appellant\n\nexhausted all fifteen of his statutory peremptory strikes and two additional strikes\n\ngranted by the court. (RR36: 176-77; RR37: 85). The court denied appellant’s\n\nrequest for a third additional strike to exercise on Ernest Hand, whom appellant\n\nidentified as objectionable. (RR39: 90-91). Since appellant received two extra\n\nperemptory challenges, appellant must show that the trial court erroneously\n\ndenied at least three of his challenges for cause to the other veniremembers\n\n                                        42\n\fidentified in issues one through twenty. See, e.g., Saldano, 232 S.W.3d at 93\n\n(noting that the defendant would have to show the trial court erroneously denied\n\nhis challenges for cause to three of the complained-of venire members because\n\nhe received two extra peremptory strikes).\n\n        The Trial Court Properly Denied Appellant’s Challenges for Cause\n\n                              Issue 1: Milton Powell\n\n      Appellant exercised his first peremptory strike against Milton Powell. (RR6:\n\n161-62). At trial, appellant objected that Powell should be excused for cause\n\nbecause (1) he was “death prone,” (2) he would give a police officer witness an\n\n“elevated level of credibility,” and (3) he would find appellant guilty regardless of\n\nthe State’s failure to prove a “technicality.” (RR6: 160-61). On appeal, appellant\n\ncontends Powell also should have been excused because he would not give\n\nmeaningful consideration to appellant’s mitigation evidence. (Appellant’s Brief,\n\npp. 22-23).\n\n      Appellant’s complaint about Powell’s inability to consider his mitigation\n\nevidence is not preserved for review because it was not raised at trial. See Tex. R.\n\nApp. P. 33.1(a) (providing that a timely specific trial objection is prerequisite to\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fpresenting a complaint on appellate review). Nevertheless, appellant fails to\n\ndemonstrate error in the denial of his challenge on any ground argued on appeal.\n\n                                   “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant claims Powell’s answers showed that, if he found appellant guilty\n\nof capital murder, then he would automatically answer the special issues in such a\n\nmanner to return a death verdict. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 21-22). The record reflects\n\nthe contrary. During questioning by both sides, Powell described his duty to\n\nfollow the law governing the special issues as “a tremendous responsibility.” He\n\ninsisted that he would carefully consider the evidence as it related to those issues\n\nand that he would not return a death sentence simply because he found appellant\n\nguilty. When asked by defense counsel if his ability to follow the law would be\n\nimpaired if the offense involved the death of a child, Powell stated only that it\n\nwould influence his answers to the special issues and make his task more difficult.\n\n(RR6: 120, 122, 124, 137, 140-41, 147-48, 155-56). The court properly concluded\n\nthat Powell was not death prone.\n\n                             Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant contends Powell’s answers showed he “would give any police\n\nofficer automatic credibility before hearing the witness” and that he “would judge\n\n                                        44\n\fa law enforcement officer using a different criteria [sic] to determine credibility\n\nthan other witnesses.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 22). In his questionnaire, Powell\n\nstated that he believed police officers were more likely to tell the truth than the\n\naverage person. (RR6: 123). During questioning at trial, the prosecutor explained\n\nto Powell that the law required him to treat all witnesses as equals at the outset,\n\nand that he must wait until he heard their testimony before assessing their\n\ncredibility. Powell responded that he understood this law and would follow it.\n\n(RR6: 123).\n\n      During questioning by defense counsel, Powell again admitted his tendency\n\nto believe officers and to give them an “elevated level of credibility.” (RR6: 133).\n\nDefense counsel did not question Powell about whether this tendency would\n\naffect his ability to follow the law, however. Thus, this statement did not impeach\n\nor contradict Powell’s earlier assurances during the prosecutor’s questioning on\n\nthe matter. Even if it did, the statement merely presented the trial court with a\n\nfact question which it was free to resolve against appellant. Threadgill, 146\n\nS.W.3d at 667 (holding particular deference is given to trial court’s ruling on a\n\nchallenge for cause when the prospective juror’s answers are vacillating, unclear,\n\nor contradictory).\n\n                                        45\n\f                              State’s Burden of Proof\n\n      Appellant contends Powell’s testimony showed that “he would have a hard\n\ntime finding someone not guilty if the State failed to prove all of the elements of\n\nthe indictment.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 23). In support of this contention, appellant\n\ncites Powell’s testimony during defense questioning that he would “probably still\n\nconvict” if the indictment alleged Dallas County but the State proved the crime\n\noccurred in Tarrant County. (RR6: 130-31). Powell made similar statements on\n\ntwo other occasions during defense questioning. (RR6: 137, 140). None of these\n\nstatements required Powell’s excusal for cause.\n\n      At trial, defense counsel challenged Powell for refusing to require the State\n\n“to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all the allegations in the indictment . . .”\n\n(RR6: 161). The State is not required to prove venue beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nProof by a preponderance of the evidence satisfies the State’s burden. Tex. Code\n\nCrim. Proc. Ann. art. 13.17 (West 2005). Admittedly, the State also misstated the\n\nlaw governing its burden of proof on venue. (RR6: 107-08). Nevertheless, Powell\n\ncannot be deemed biased for refusing to hold the State to a higher standard of\n\nproof than the law requires. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16(c)(2).\n\n\n\n                                         46\n\f      Even if appellant was entitled to a juror who would require a greater\n\ndegree of proof, the court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the challenge\n\nto Powell. When initially questioned by the prosecutor on the matter, Powell\n\nstated that he would hold the State to its burden of proving every element,\n\nincluding venue, beyond a reasonable doubt. (RR6: 107-08). Furthermore,\n\nPowell’s statements during defense questioning that he “probably would still\n\nconvict” and that he “might overlook” or “tend to overlook that technicality”\n\nwere not emphatic refusals to hold the State to its burden. Thus, resolution of this\n\nconflict in Powell’s testimony against appellant was reasonable and within the\n\ncourt’s discretion. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n                                  Mitigation Bias\n\n      Lastly, appellant contends Powell should have been excused because he\n\n“could not give meaningful consideration to any mitigation that the defense\n\nwould rely on in punishment.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 22). In support of this\n\ncontention, appellant refers to Powell’s questionnaire, in which he disagreed that\n\ngenetics, circumstances of birth, upbringing, and environment should be\n\nconsidered when determining punishment. He also cites to Powell’s testimony\n\nthat he felt incarceration was an insufficient punishment for some crimes. Id.\n\n                                         47\n\f      No juror is required to consider any particular fact as mitigating. Standefer\n\nv.

(RR10: 121). At trial, appellant objected that Nichols should have\n\nbeen excused for cause because (1) she would not hold the State to its burden of\n\nproving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and (2) she could not consider the\n\nminimum punishment for the lesser-included offense of murder. (RR10: 118-19).\n\nOn appeal, appellant does not complain that Nichols should have been excused\n\nfor her position on the punishment range for murder. Thus, that ground is not\n\npresented for review.\n\n\n\n                                        48\n\f       Appellant does present and argue the other ground raised at trial –\n\nNichols’s inability to hold the State to its burden of proof at guilt. Moreover, he\n\nraises two new allegations: (1) that Nichols would automatically have assessed a\n\ndeath sentence if she found him guilty of capital murder, and (2) that she was\n\n“biased against any mitigation.”2 (Appellant’s Brief, p. 29-30). Because these two\n\nnew grounds were not raised at trial, they are not preserved for review on appeal.\n\nTex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant fails to demonstrate that Nichols\n\nshould have been excused for cause on any of the three grounds argued on\n\nappeal.\n\n                                  State’s Burden of Proof\n\n       Appellant contends Nichols should have been excused because her prior\n\njury service biased her against the law that required her to acquit if the State\n\nfailed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant cites to Nichols’s\n\nquestionnaire in which she commented on the following statement: “Regardless\n\n\n\n\n2\n  In his brief, appellant also makes passing references to Nichols’s questionnaire answers\nrelated to police officer credibility and her opinion about the rehabilitation of capital\nmurderers. There is no accompanying argument nor were these answers raised at trial as a\nbasis for challenging Nichols. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 30; RR10: 118-19). If these references were\nintended to present additional grounds for excusing Nichols, they are inadequately briefed and\nwill not be addressed by the State.\n                                               49\n\fof what a judge says the law is, jurors should do what they believe is the right\n\nthing.” Nichols agreed with the statement, saying, “I was on a criminal jury once;\n\neverything pointed to crime, but we let the criminal go free, because of ‘evidence,\n\nbeyond a doubt’, which does not exist & is impossible if not witnessed; we let a\n\nbad man on the loose to hurt other children – I will never let this happen again.”\n\n(Nichols Questionnaire, p. 7).\n\n      Both sides questioned Nichols about this statement and her prior\n\nexperience as a juror. On both occasions, Nichols explained that she believed the\n\ndefendant in the prior trial was guilty and that she was the lone “hold-out” juror.\n\nThe other eleven jurors told her that she could not vote guilty unless she believed\n\nhe was guilty “beyond a shadow of a doubt” or unless she was 100% certain of his\n\nguilt. She believed that the only way she could be that certain of guilt was if she\n\nwitnessed the crime herself. (RR10: 41-42, 98-99).\n\n      The prosecutor explained that the burden of proof was beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt – not a shadow of a doubt – and that whatever convinced\n\nNichols beyond a reasonable doubt was sufficient to convict. Nichols quizzed the\n\nprosecutor repeatedly to ensure that she understood the burden of proof if\n\nselected for appellant’s jury. (RR10: 43-44, 73-74, 77-78). And when questioned\n\n                                        50\n\fby defense counsel, she confirmed her accurate understanding of that burden.\n\n(RR10: 98-99, 100-01, 103). Furthermore, the prosecutor explained to Nichols that\n\nif the State failed to meet its burden on any element of the offense, she was\n\nrequired to acquit. Nichols understood and agreed with this law and repeatedly\n\nstated that she would hold the State to its burden, even if it meant an acquittal.\n\n(RR10: 49-53).\n\n      Nichols never demonstrated an unwillingness to hold the State to proof\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The statement in her questionnaire evinced only a\n\nmisunderstanding of the law, not a bias against it, and her testimony resolved\n\nthat misunderstanding. Thus, the court properly denied the challenge against her.\n\n                                  Death Prone\n\n      Appellant contends various answers in Nichols’s questionnaire show that\n\nshe would automatically assess a death sentence if she found someone guilty of\n\ncapital murder. While apparently acknowledging that Nichols’s testimony shows\n\nshe would follow the law governing the assessment of punishment, appellant\n\ncontends she was indoctrinated by the prosecutor and that her answers did not\n\nreflect her true opinions. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 29, 31). The record reflects\n\notherwise.\n\n                                       51\n\f      Although Nichols strongly favored the death penalty, she stated that she\n\ncould set aside her strong feelings and give full consideration to the evidence.\n\n(RR10: 71). She also agreed that a sentence of life without parole was an extreme\n\npunishment and that she could be satisfied with such a sentence. (RR10: 53, 97,\n\n106). Furthermore, she stated on numerous occasions that she would wait and\n\nconsider the evidence at punishment when assessing the sentence, even if she\n\nfound the defendant guilty. Her answers were not merely one-word assents to\n\npropositions by the prosecutor. By all appearances, Nichols was a thoughtful,\n\nintelligent woman with a strong desire to follow the law. Her answers indicated\n\nan understanding and agreement with that law. (RR10: 45, 49, 54-55, 61-63, 65,\n\n71, 77, 77-78). Indeed, she answered the same way when posed similar questions\n\nat length by defense counsel. (RR10: 93-94, 100, 102, 107-08, 111, 113). Not once\n\ndid Nichols waver or give a conflicting answer on the matter. If appellant had\n\nchallenged Nichols on this basis at trial, the denial of that challenge would have\n\nbeen proper.\n\n                                 Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant contends Nichols was biased against any mitigation because in\n\nher questionnaire she opined that genetics, circumstances, upbringing,\n\n                                       52\n\fenvironment, and intoxication did not excuse criminal behavior. (Nichols\n\nQuestionnaire, pp. 6, 10). Nichols had no duty to consider any particular fact as\n\nmitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. She was only obligated to consider all the\n\nevidence presented at trial in determining her answers to the special issues. She\n\nunequivocally stated that she would do this, and she specifically stated that she\n\nwould consider any mitigating evidence presented. (RR10: 45, 49, 54-55, 71, 107-\n\n08, 113). Thus, if the court had been presented with this particular challenge, it\n\nwould have been proper to deny it.\n\n      Nichols was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n2.\n\n                              Issue 3: Dee Jay Earley\n\n      Appellant exercised his third peremptory strike against Dee Jay Earley.\n\n(RR12: 244). At trial, appellant challenged Earley for lying on his questionnaire and\n\nrefusing to consider evidence of intoxication in mitigation of punishment. (RR12:\n\n238-43). On appeal, appellant contends the court should have granted his\n\nchallenge on both of these grounds. He also contends the court should have\n\nexcused Earley for cause because he was “death prone.” (Appellant’s Brief, pp.\n\n32-35).\n\n                                         53\n\f      Because it was not raised at trial, the contention that Earley was death\n\nprone is not preserved for appellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless,\n\nappellant fails to demonstrate that Earley should have been excused for cause on\n\nany of the three grounds argued on appeal.\n\n                            Dishonesty in Questionnaire\n\n      Appellant contends Earley was dishonest because he did not reveal his\n\nvolunteer work as a victim’s advocate in his questionnaire. Appellant\n\ncharacterizes the omission as an intentional deception. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 34-\n\n35). The record refutes this characterization.\n\n      Earley first mentioned his advocacy work during questioning by the\n\nprosecutor. The information was not directly solicited. Earley volunteered it.\n\n(RR12: 171-72). He testified that he served as a victim’s advocate during his\n\nmilitary service. It was not part of his regular duties; it was volunteer work that he\n\nagreed to do at the request of his commanding officer. He volunteered for two\n\nand a half years. He would assist victims of domestic assault, child abuse, etc. with\n\nfinding food and shelter for the night and obtaining restraining orders. The\n\noffenses were typically minor; none involved a murder. (RR12: 171-72, 197-201).\n\n\n\n                                         54\n\f      Appellant claims that Earley should have provided the information in\n\nresponse to Question 58 in his questionnaire. The question asked Earley to list\n\n“any local, state or national citizens’ law enforcement group such as a crime\n\ncommission, group that supports the death penalty, group dedicated to victims’\n\nrights, traffic commission, neighborhood crime watch, Mothers Against Drunk\n\nDriving or police or sheriff’s auxiliary.” (Earley Questionnaire, p. 9). When the\n\ncourt asked Earley why he did not list his military advocacy work in response to\n\nthis question, he explained that he did not belong to any organization. He and the\n\nother volunteers did not meet as a group. He would simply get a phone call and\n\nrespond. Moreover, Earley explicitly denied any intent to deceive. (RR12: 239-43).\n\n      The court believed Earley and that credibility determination is entitled to\n\ndeference. (RR12: 243). It is amply supported by Earley’s explanation, by his\n\nexpress denial of any intent to deceive, and by the fact it was he who first\n\nvolunteered the information. Thus, the court’s denial of this challenge was\n\nproper.\n\n                      Consideration of Intoxication Evidence\n\n      Appellant contends Earley was biased against any mitigation evidence\n\nbecause he did not believe evidence of intoxication should be considered in\n\n                                       55\n\fmitigation of punishment. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 34). Earley had no duty to\n\nconsider any particular evidence mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. He was\n\nonly obligated to consider all the evidence presented at trial in determining his\n\nanswers to the special issues. Although he did not regard intoxication evidence as\n\nmitigating, he stated that he would consider it in answering the special issues.\n\n(RR12: 157-58, 225-30). Thus, Earley evinced no bias against the law and the court\n\nproperly denied this challenge.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends that Earley’s responses to some of the questions in his\n\nquestionnaire show that he would automatically assess a death sentence if he\n\nfound the defendant guilty of murder or crimes against the elderly or children.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, p. 33). Earley’s testimony dispelled any notion that he was\n\n“death prone.”\n\n      Although Earley favored the death penalty for certain types of crimes, he\n\nhad no problem with assessing a sentence of life without parole. (RR12: 204). He\n\nalso repeatedly and unequivocally stated that he would hold the State to its\n\nburden of proof on the first special issue, he would wait, listen to, and consider\n\nthe punishment evidence before answering the special issues, and he would not\n\n                                       56\n\fautomatically assess a death sentence just because he found appellant guilty.\n\n(RR12: 151-54, 159-66, 183, 188-89, 202-06, 215, 218-19, 224). The law required\n\nnothing more of Earley. Thus, any challenge that he was biased against the law\n\nwould have been properly denied.\n\n      Earley was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n3.\n\n                              Issue 4: Timothy Tinsley\n\n      Appellant exercised his fourth peremptory strike against Timothy Tinsley.\n\n(RR14: 116). At trial, appellant challenged Tinsley because: (1) he was unable to\n\ngive “fair and accurate consideration to sufficient mitigating evidence”; (2) he was\n\nunable “to start police officers on the same level of credibility as other\n\nwitnesses”; and (3) he was “death prone.” (RR 14: 110-11). On appeal, appellant\n\nargues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on all\n\nthree grounds. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 36-37). The record justifies the court’s ruling.\n\n                                   Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant contends Tinsley could not give full consideration to his\n\nmitigation evidence because of the “history of alcoholism in his family with his\n\n\n\n                                          57\n\fbrother as well as his stepdad.” (RR14: 110, 112). Tinsley’s testimony\n\ndemonstrates otherwise.\n\n      Tinsley testified that his stepfather was an alcoholic who repeatedly went\n\nto prison. Tinsley lived with his stepfather for a year and a half and moved out\n\nwhen he turned 18. (RR14: 28-30, 78-80). Also, Tinsley acknowledged in his\n\nquestionnaire and at trial that his brother is a recovering alcoholic. (RR14: 82;\n\nTinsley Questionnaire, p. 10). Based on his experiences with his stepfather, as well\n\nas the lessons of his biological father who was a drill sergeant, Tinsley believed\n\npeople should be held accountable for their actions. (RR14: 28-30). Furthermore,\n\nhe expressly stated that he would not characterize evidence of voluntary\n\nintoxication as mitigating. (RR14: 80-81). Tinsley he had no duty to treat such\n\nevidence as mitigating, however. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. He was only\n\nobligated to consider any evidence of intoxication presented at trial by either side\n\nin determining his answers to the special issues. Tinsley’s testimony reflects that\n\nhe could fulfill that duty.\n\n      Tinsley never stated that he would not consider evidence of intoxication or\n\ndrug use at punishment. He repeatedly assured both sides that he would have to\n\nhear the evidence before making any decisions on sentencing and that he would\n\n                                        58\n\fwait and listen to the evidence in determining his answers to both special issues.\n\n(RR14: 38, 46-47, 49-50, 57, 104). He explained what types of intoxication\n\nevidence he would regard as mitigating, e.g., involuntary intoxication evidence.\n\n(RR14: 80-81). Then, referencing his feelings about drug and alcohol abuse,\n\nTinsley avowed that his personal beliefs and the law “were two different things.”\n\n(RR14: 85-86).\n\n      If there were any doubt as to Tinsley ability to consider voluntary\n\nintoxication evidence at punishment, it was dispelled during the court’s\n\nquestioning of Tinsley on the matter. When asked if he could keep an open mind\n\nas to any evidence either side might present on the punishment issues, Tinsley\n\nsaid, “I think I can.” But when asked for a more definitive answer from the court,\n\nTinsley said, “I can.” (RR14: 113-15). Any vacillation in Tinsley’s answer was for\n\nthe trial court to resolve and that determination is entitled to deference.\n\nThreadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n                             Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant contends Tinsley could not treat police officers the same as other\n\nwitnesses, starting them out on an equal basis. Tinsley’s testimony shows the\n\nopposite.\n\n                                        59\n\f      Tinsley stated that he would give a police officer “a little more respect”\n\nthan the “average Joe.” ((RR14: 105). But he was referring to how he would treat\n\nthem outside of the courtroom. (RR14: 106). In court, Tinsley would treat all\n\nwitnesses the same and wait until he heard the testimony to judge it, even if,\n\ngenerally, he thought police were more credible. (RR14: 55-57). In Tinsley’s\n\nopinion, “Everybody’s human, you know, so I would just – I would listen to the\n\nstory and how it’s presented to determine, yeah.” (RR14: 105). Tinsley held no\n\nbias against the law governing police officer testimony, and the court properly\n\noverruled this challenge.\n\n                                 “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends that if he found appellant guilty of capital murder,\n\nTinsley would automatically answer the special issues in a manner that resulted in\n\na death sentence. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 36). Nothing in Tinsley’s testimony\n\nsupports this contention.\n\n      Throughout his testimony, Tinsley repeatedly stated that he would not\n\nautomatically vote for death if he found appellant guilty and that he would wait\n\nand consider the evidence presented at punishment in answering the special\n\nissues. (RR14: 38, 46-51, 57, 75, 86, 89, 104). By all appearances, Tinsley would\n\n                                       60\n\ffulfill his duty of waiting and considering all the evidence before he determined\n\nhis answers to the special issues. The court properly concluded that he was not\n\nchallengeable as “death prone.”\n\n      Tinsley was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n4.\n\n                               Issue 5: Robin Linn\n\nAppellant exercised his fifth peremptory challenge against venireperson Robin\n\nLinn. (RR14: 232). At trial, appellant objected that she was “death prone” and her\n\ntestimonial responses were disingenuous and motivated by a strong desire to get\n\non the jury. (RR14: 228-32).\n\n      Linn’s questionnaire and testimony demonstrated that she strongly favored\n\nthe death penalty and that she wanted to serve on the jury. (RR14: 127-28, 131-\n\n32; Linn Questionnaire). Neither of these facts rendered Linn challengeable for\n\ncause, however. And the remainder of Linn’s testimony demonstrates an\n\nunequivocal understanding of and willingness to follow the law.\n\n      While she favored the death penalty, Linn stated that she did not believe it\n\nwas appropriate for all homicides and that such a decision would have to be\n\nbased on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. (RR14: 132-36). She\n\n                                        61\n\fwould not refuse to consider any punishment evidence, she would not answer the\n\nfirst issue affirmatively simply because she found appellant guilty of capital\n\nmurder, and she believed that the special issues were a fair method for assessing\n\nwhether the death penalty was appropriate. (RR14: 161-63, 169-70, 174). She\n\ncould envision a scenario where a murderer might not be a future danger and\n\nwhere mitigating circumstances might warrant a life sentence. (RR14: 200, 210).\n\nAnd although she would like to know if a defendant were remorseful, she would\n\nnot require him to testify to such in assessing his sentence. She understood that a\n\ndefendant might feel remorseful but be unable to testify at trial for a variety of\n\nreasons. (RR14: 183, 201-02).\n\n      Appellant argued that Linn’s demeanor during questioning told another\n\nstory. According to defense counsel, Linn was simply saying what she needed to\n\nsay to get on a death penalty jury. But Linn’s desire to serve on appellant’s jury\n\nwas not motivated by a bloodlust. It was motivated by her faith in the system and\n\nher sense of civic duty. (RR14: 127-28). Her thoughtful explanations and\n\nresponses throughout questioning by both sides evinced an intelligent woman\n\nwho understood the gravity of serving in death penalty trial and who took the\n\nresponsibility seriously.\n\n                                        62\n\f      Defense counsel argued that Linn’s demeanor suggested otherwise. The\n\nprosecutor disputed that characterization. (RR14: 231). The trial court apparently\n\ndisagreed as well because it overruled the challenge. (RR14: 232). The court’s\n\ndetermination is entitled to deference and is amply supported by Linn’s\n\ntestimony, as detailed above.\n\n      Linn was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue 5.\n\n                                Issue 6: Charles Stout\n\n      Appellant exercised his sixth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nCharles Stout. (RR16: 77). At trial, appellant objected that Stout would hold the\n\ndecision not to testify against appellant, that he would put the burden of proof on\n\nappellant, that he would not presume appellant innocent, and that he did not\n\nunderstand the Texas death penalty sentencing scheme. (RR16: 74-76). On\n\nappeal, appellant focuses on one ground – holding his failure to testify against\n\nhim. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 44-45). The court’s rejection of this challenge was\n\nproper.\n\n      Appellant’s contention that Stout would hold his failure to testify against\n\nhim is premised on a mischaracterization of Stout’s testimony. Although he would\n\ntestify if he were a defendant, Stout repeatedly denied that he would hold\n\n                                         63\n\fanother’s decision not to testify against him. Stout agreed that the defendant has\n\nno burden of proof, and he acknowledged that there could be a variety of reasons\n\na defendant might not testify that had nothing to do with his guilt or innocence.\n\n(RR16: 36-38).\n\n      Stout did not equivocate or change his opinion when questioned on the\n\nmatter again by defense counsel. He reiterated the responses he gave the\n\nprosecutor during earlier questioning. He also more specifically testified that he\n\nwould not hold the decision not to testify against appellant in determining his\n\nguilt or innocence or in answering either of the special issues. (RR16: 47-48, 63-\n\n65). Stout’s clear and unwavering responses show that he held no bias against\n\nappellant’s Fifth Amendment right not to testify and would not consider it in his\n\ndeliberations.\n\n      Stout was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue 6.\n\n                             Issue 7: Allen Harrington\n\n      Appellant exercised his seventh peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nAllen Harrington. (RR23: 82). At trial, appellant objected that Harrington could not\n\nconsider evidence of intoxication, background, social issues, and expert mental\n\nhealth testimony. (RR23: 81-82). On appeal, appellant argues that the trial court\n\n                                         64\n\fshould have granted his challenge on that basis and on the ground that\n\nHarrington would automatically assess a death sentence if he found appellant\n\nguilty of capital murder. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 47-48).\n\n      Because the second ground was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for\n\nappellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant fails to\n\ndemonstrate that Harrington should have been excused for cause on either\n\nground argued on appeal.\n\n                                    Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant contends that Harrington’s questionnaire responses and his\n\ntestimony show that he would not consider evidence of genetics, background,\n\nenvironment, intoxication, or expert mental health testimony in answering the\n\nmitigation special issue. In actuality, Harrington’s testimony shows that he would\n\nconsider such evidence, but that he did not regard it as mitigating. (RR23: 46, 77-\n\n78). Harrington he had no duty to treat such evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59\n\nS.W.3d at 181. He was only obligated to consider any evidence presented in\n\ndetermining his answer to the mitigation special issue. Harrington’s testimony\n\nreflects that he could fulfill that duty.\n\n\n\n                                            65\n\f      He stated that he would listen to the evidence and decide whether it was\n\nsufficiently mitigating. He agreed that the needed to wait and listen because “you\n\nnever know what you’ll hear.” He also stated that his opinion about intoxication\n\nand background evidence in particular would not prevent him from given it\n\nconsideration. (RR23: 77-78). Thus, the court properly denied this challenge.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends Harrington’s questionnaire responses reflect that he\n\nwould automatically assess a death sentence if he found appellant guilty.\n\nHarrington’s testimony reflects otherwise.\n\n      Harrington stated that although he strongly favors the death penalty, he\n\nwould not automatically assess it if he found appellant guilty. (RR23: 27, 38-39).\n\nHe agreed to wait and consider any evidence that would be offered on the special\n\nissues. (RR23: 38-39). He understood that the State had the burden of proof on\n\nthe first issue and that he would hold the State to that burden. (RR23: 42-44). He\n\nacknowledged that he would set the bar very high on the mitigation issue, but he\n\nalso stated that he wanted to hear evidence on the issue and that he would wait\n\nand consider it before assessing any sentence “because you never know.” (RR23:\n\n46-48).\n\n                                        66\n\f       Appellant attacks the veracity of Harrington’s testimony. He argues that\n\n“Harrington was being more truthful when answering the questionnaire than\n\nwhen being examined” and that he “obviously wished to be on the jury and had\n\nbeen instructed by the State as to arrive there.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 47). The\n\ntotality of Harrington’s testimony showed he was an intelligent man with a firm\n\ngrasp of the law and a commitment to following it. Furthermore, Harrington\n\nexplained that he was in a hurry when he filled out the questionnaire because he\n\nhad to pick someone up from the airport. (RR23: 73-75). The court could have\n\nreasonably concluded that Harrington was rushed in his answers and took less\n\ncare than if he had not been in such a hurry. Regardless, the trial court disagreed\n\nwith   appellant’s   characterization   of   Harrington’s   testimony    and   that\n\ndetermination is entitled to deference. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n       Harrington was qualified to sit on appellant’s jury. This Court should\n\noverrule Issue 7.\n\n                           Issue 8: Anthony Morrison\n\n       Appellant exercised his eighth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nAnthony Morrison. (RR24: 88). At trial, appellant objected that Morrison equated\n\na death sentence with a guilty verdict on capital murder or murder and would not\n\n                                        67\n\fconsider certain types of mitigating evidence in answering the second special\n\nissue. (RR24: 78-79). On appeal, appellant contends the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge on both of these grounds. (Appellant’s Brief, p.\n\n49-52). The record supports the court’s ruling.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n       Appellant argues Morrison’s feelings about the death penalty were so\n\nstrong that he would assess it as soon as the State proved appellant guilty of\n\ncapital murder. In support, appellant cites Morrison’s questionnaire responses\n\nand a portion of his testimony during defense counsel’s examination. (Appellant’s\n\nBrief, p. 52).\n\n       Morrison did not dispute that he strongly favored the death penalty, but he\n\nalso stated that he was open to a sentence of life without parole. (RR24: 17-18,\n\n29, 64-65). Then he repeatedly stated that even though he thought someone\n\nconvicted of capital murder should get the death penalty, he would not let that\n\nfeeling determine the punishment he assessed. Rather, he would apply the\n\nevidence to the law and let it determine his answers to the special issues and,\n\nconsequently, the sentence. (RR24: 58-59, 61-62, 71, 73-74). The totality of\n\n\n\n                                        68\n\fMorrison’s testimony shows that he would not assess an automatic death\n\nsentence, and the court properly overruled this challenge.\n\n                                 Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Morrison was unable to give meaningful\n\nconsideration to mitigation evidence that he intended to rely on. To the contrary,\n\nthe record reflects that Morrison would consider appellant’s evidence of\n\nbackground, environment, etc. Throughout his testimony, Morrison told both\n\nsides and the court the same thing. He felt that a person’s background and\n\nupbringing do not excuse criminal behavior. Yet he would set aside those personal\n\nfeelings and consider such evidence in answering the second special issue. (RR24:\n\n41-42, 73-74, 84-85). At most, Morrison’s testimony shows that he might not\n\nregard appellant’s evidence of background, environment, etc. as mitigating. This\n\ndid not render him challengeable because Morrison had no duty to treat any\n\nparticular evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181.\n\n      Morrison was qualified to sit on appellant’s jury. This Court should overrule\n\nIssue 8.\n\n\n\n\n                                        69\n\f                            Issue 9: Enriquez Martinez\n\n      Appellant exercised his ninth peremptory challenge against venireperson\n\nEnriquez Martinez. (RR25: 205). At trial, appellant objected that Martinez would\n\nautomatically assess a death sentence and that he would not give adequate and\n\nproper consideration to appellant’s mitigation evidence. (RR25: 202). On appeal,\n\nappellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on\n\nboth these grounds and should also have excused Martinez because he would\n\nhave required appellant to testify.\n\n      Because the third ground was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for\n\nappellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant fails to\n\ndemonstrate that Martinez should have been excused for cause on any of the\n\nthree grounds argued on appeal.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant argues that Martinez’s questionnaire responses show that he\n\nwould automatically assess a death sentence if he found appellant guilty of capital\n\nmurder. Martinez’s responses showed that he strongly favored the death penalty;\n\nthey did not show that he would automatically assess it. (Martinez\n\nQuestionnaire). Moreover, as appellant pointed out in his trial objection,\n\n                                        70\n\fMartinez’s testimony demonstrates that he understood and would follow the law\n\nin determining appellant’s punishment. He repeatedly and emphatically\n\ndifferentiated between his feelings and the law and insisted that his feelings\n\nwould not prevent him from following the law. He thought the special issues\n\n“process” was fair and preferable to jurors simply voting life or death. He would\n\napply the evidence to the special issues and let that determine the punishment.\n\n(RR26: 160, 169-70, 172-76, 182, 191). He was not death prone and the court\n\nproperly denied this challenge.\n\n                                  Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Martinez would not give adequate consideration to\n\nhis mitigation evidence because he did not think a defendant’s background,\n\nintoxication, or mental health excused their crime. Martinez’s testimony shows\n\nthat he would listen to any evidence appellant presented on the second special\n\nissue, including background, intoxication, etc., but he would not regard it as\n\nmitigating. This did not disqualify him from service because Martinez had no duty\n\nto treat any particular evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. The\n\ncourt properly denied this challenge as well.\n\n\n\n                                        71\n\f                                 Failure to Testify\n\n      Finally, appellant argues that Martinez would require appellant to testify in\n\nviolation of his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Martinez denied\n\nthis. Martinez said that he would be looking for signs of remorse or regret if a\n\ndefendant did testify, but that he understood and respected the Fifth\n\nAmendment right and that a defendant’s decision not to testify would not affect\n\nhis verdict. (RR26: 162, 182-84). Thus, any challenge that Martinez was biased\n\nagainst Fifth Amendment law would have been properly denied.\n\n      Martinez was qualified to sit on appellant’s jury. This Court should overrule\n\nIssue 9.\n\n                              Issue 10: Paul Zugelder\n\n      Appellant exercised his tenth peremptory strike against venireperson Paul\n\nZugelder. (RR27: 226). At trial, appellant argued that Zugelder should be excused\n\nbecause the court and the prosecutor left him with the impression that defense\n\ncounsel was misstating the law. On appeal, appellant reasserts this ground and\n\nclaims the court abused its discretion in denying the challenge. (Appellant’s Brief,\n\np. 59). Apparently, it is appellant’s contention that the alleged misimpression\n\n\n\n                                        72\n\fbiased Zugelder against the defendant. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.16\n\n(a)(9). The record reflects no such bias.\n\n      Initially, defense counsel did make a misstatement of law. The\n\nmisstatement arose during defense counsel’s discussion of the concept of\n\n“mercy” and its relevance to mitigation special issue. When he first explained the\n\nlaw to Zugelder, defense counsel stated, “*T+he law specifically tells us, that a\n\njuror’s concept of mercy, a juror’s concept of mercy alone based on anything they\n\nhave heard in the case is sufficient, if they believe it’s sufficient.” (RR27: 196-97).\n\nThe prosecutor objected to this misstatement. Mercy could not be based on\n\nanything heard during trial; it had to be based on evidence. Defense counsel\n\nagreed and clarified his prior statement, and then the court sustained the\n\nobjection. (RR27: 197).\n\n      When defense counsel continued his explanation, the prosecutor objected\n\nagain to him omitting the phrase “based on the evidence.” Defense counsel\n\ncorrectly noted that he had not omitted that phrase and then finished his\n\nexplanation of the law. The prosecutor disagreed with defense counsel, but the\n\ncourt remained silent. (RR27: 198-99).\n\n\n\n                                            73\n\f      At this point, Zugelder interrupted and informed the court that he was\n\nconfused about whether the law permitted him to disregard the mitigation\n\nspecial issue and assess life out of mercy. (RR27: 199). Thus, although defense\n\ncounsel had not misstated the law, he had left a false impression with the juror.\n\nThe court dispelled Zulgelder’s confusion, explaining that he could answer the\n\nmitigation issue affirmatively based on mercy if that decision was based on some\n\nevidence at trial. (RR27: 199-01). Defense counsel and Zugelder continued to\n\ndiscuss the issue and, eventually, defense counsel acknowledged, “Maybe I didn’t\n\nexplain that too well to you the first time . . .” (RR27: 202-04).\n\n      In short, defense counsel did misstate the law initially and he did leave a\n\nfalse impression with Zugelder. Thus, if Zugelder had reacted negatively to\n\ndefense counsel’s miscommunications, that would have been counsel’s fault.\n\nZugelder did not react negatively, however. He remained communicative and\n\nengaged throughout the entirety of defense counsel’s questioning. He remarked\n\non counsel’s candor and, in return, was himself candid. He did not express anger\n\nor even frustration. By all appearances, he was emotionally unaffected by the\n\nexchange and was concerned only with understanding the law and answering\n\n\n\n                                          74\n\fquestions honestly. (RR27: 196-207). The trial court reasonably concluded the\n\nsame and properly denied this challenge.\n\n      Zugelder was qualified to sit on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 10.\n\n                             Issue 11: David Hornstein\n\n      Appellant      exercised   his   eleventh   peremptory   challenge   against\n\nvenireperson David Hornstein. (RR28: 116). At trial, appellant objected that\n\nHornstein would not give consideration to appellant’s mitigation evidence at\n\npunishment. Specifically, he would not consider appellant’s character and\n\nbackground, mental health, or voluntary intoxication. (RR28: 114-15). On appeal,\n\nappellant claims the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on\n\nthis ground. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 60-61).\n\n      Hornstein’s testimony shows that he would listen to any evidence appellant\n\npresented on the second special issue, including background, intoxication, and\n\nmental health evidence, but that he might not regard it as mitigating. (RR28: 53-\n\n54, 61-63, 67, 95-112). This did not disqualify him from service because Hornstein\n\nhad no duty to treat any particular evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at\n\n181. The court properly denied this challenge.\n\n                                          75\n\f      Hornstein was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 11.\n\n                             Issue 12: Andrea Griffith\n\n      Appellant exercised his twelfth peremptory challenge against venireperson\n\nAndrea Griffith. (RR30: 84). At trial, appellant objected that Griffith would not\n\nconsider his mitigation evidence at punishment. Specifically, she would not\n\nconsider   genetics,   background,     upbringing,   environment,     or   voluntary\n\nintoxication. (RR30: 82-83). On appeal, appellant claims the trial court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying his challenge on this ground. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 60-61).\n\n      Griffith’s testimony shows that she would listen to any evidence appellant\n\npresented on the second special issue, but that she might not regard it as\n\nmitigating. (RR30: 58-59, 65, 70-76). This did not disqualify her from service\n\nbecause she had no duty to treat any particular evidence as mitigating. Standefer,\n\n59 S.W.3d at 181. The court properly denied this challenge.\n\n      Griffith was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 12.\n\n\n\n\n                                         76\n\f                         Issue 13: Bradford McCutheon\n\n      Appellant exercised his thirteenth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nBradford McCutheon. (RR31: 112). At trial, appellant objected that McCutheon\n\nwould not be able to give fair and accurate consideration to the special issues.\n\n(RR31: 111). On appeal, appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in\n\ndenying this challenge. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 64-65). The record supports the\n\ncourt’s ruling.\n\n      Appellant argues that McCutheon’s questionnaire and testimony show that\n\nhe would automatically assess a death sentence if he found appellant guilty of\n\ncapital murder. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 65). Although McCutheon’s responses\n\nshowed that he strongly favored the death penalty, they also showed that he\n\nwould not automatically assess it. Throughout his testimony, McCutheon\n\nrepeatedly and expressly stated that he would not automatically answer the\n\nspecial issues “yes” and “no” just because he found someone guilty of capital\n\nmurder. He also denied that he would let his feelings rather than the law control\n\nhis answers to the issues. He stated that he would follow the law, keep an open\n\nmind to any evidence presented, and let the evidence determine his answers.\n\n(RR31: 35, 46-48, 51, 53, 57, 59-60, 82-84,87-89, 102-03). He thought that the\n\n                                        77\n\fprocess of answering the special issues made sense and was better than jurors\n\nsimply voting for a life or death sentence. (RR31: 61, 75-76). He was not death\n\nprone and the court properly denied this challenge.\n\n      McCutheon was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 13.\n\n                               Issue 14: Elvira Corpus\n\n      Appellant exercised his fourteenth peremptory against venireperson Elvira\n\nCorpus. (RR3: 70). At trial, appellant objected that Corpus would automatically\n\nassess a death sentence if she found him guilty of capital murder and that she\n\nwould not consider his mitigating evidence. (RR33: 68-69). On appeal, appellant\n\nargues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on both\n\nthese grounds. He also argues that the court should have excused Corpus because\n\nshe would not fairly assess the credibility of police officers. (Appellant’s Brief, pp.\n\n66-68).\n\n      Because the third ground was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for\n\nappellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant fails to\n\ndemonstrate that Corpus should have been excused for cause on any of the three\n\ngrounds argued on appeal.\n\n                                          78\n\f                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant argues that Corpus’s questionnaire responses and testimony\n\nboth show that she would automatically assess a death sentence if she found\n\nappellant guilty of capital murder. In particular, he cites responses in her\n\nquestionnaire that show she strongly supports the death penalty. He also cites\n\ntwo excerpts from her testimony in which she appears to be saying that she\n\nwould automatically answer the mitigation issue “no.” (Corpus Questionnaire, pp.\n\n2, 5-6; RR33: 55-56).\n\n      Corpus’s questionnaire showed that she strongly favored the death\n\npenalty, but it also showed that she did not think it was appropriate in every case.\n\n(Corpus Questionnaire, p. 1). Nowhere in her questionnaire did she state that she\n\nthought a death sentence should be automatically assessed. (Corpus\n\nQuestionnaire).\n\n      The two testimonial excerpts appellant cites show only that Corpus was\n\nconfused by and misunderstood defense counsel’s questions at one point. The\n\nprosecutor objected to the nature of defense counsel’s questions several times\n\nduring these excerpts, and Corpus expressed her confusion. (RR33: 58-59). Both\n\nbefore and after those two exchanges, Corpus consistently maintained that she\n\n                                        79\n\fwould not automatically answer either issue, that she would wait and listen to the\n\nevidence, and that she would keep an open mind. (RR33: 22, 25, 27-30, 34-35, 40-\n\n41, 49-50, 60-66). To the extent Corpus made any statements that reflected\n\notherwise, the conflict was the court’s to resolve, and it resolved it against\n\nappellant. That determination was proper and is entitled to deference. Threadgill,\n\n146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n                                  Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Corpus would not give adequate consideration to his\n\nmitigation evidence because she did not think evidence of background,\n\nintoxication, or mental health excused crime. Corpus’s testimony shows that she\n\nwould listen to any evidence appellant presented on the second special issue, but\n\nshe might not regard it as mitigating. (RR33: 63-66). This did not disqualify her\n\nfrom jury service because Corpus had no duty to treat any particular evidence as\n\nmitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. The court properly denied this challenge\n\nas well.\n\n                              Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant contends Corpus was biased because she thought “police officers\n\nwere more likely to tell the truth.” (Appellant’s Brief, p. 67). Corpus did make that\n\n                                         80\n\fstatement in her questionnaire. (Corpus Questionnaire, p. 5). But at trial, Corpus\n\nagreed that all witnesses start out on equal footing and that she would wait and\n\nlisten to an officer’s testimony before determining his credibility. (RR33: 38-39).\n\nThus, Corpus held no bias against the law governing police officer testimony, and\n\nthe court properly overruled this challenge.\n\n      Corpus was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 14.\n\n                             Issue 15: Temple Koestner\n\n      Appellant exercised his fifteenth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nTemple Koestner. (RR33: 157). At trial, appellant objected that Koestner would\n\nautomatically equate a guilty verdict with a death sentence and that she would\n\nnot consider his mitigation evidence. (RR33: 154-55). On appeal, appellant argues\n\nthat the trial court abused its discretion in denying his challenge on both these\n\ngrounds. He also argues that the court should have excused Koestner because she\n\nwould not fairly assess the credibility of police officers and because she would\n\ndisregard the court’s instructions. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 66-68).\n\n      Because these two additional grounds were not raised at trial, they are not\n\npreserved for appellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a). Nevertheless, appellant\n\n                                          81\n\ffails to demonstrate that Koestner should have been excused for cause on any of\n\nthe four grounds argued on appeal.\n\n                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends Koestner’s questionnaire responses show that she was\n\nprone to vote for death if she found him guilty of capital murder. (Appellant’s\n\nBrief, pp. 70-71). In actuality, her questionnaire shows only that she strongly\n\nfavored the death penalty and that she thought it was an appropriate punishment\n\nin some murder cases, not all. She considered the death penalty and life without\n\nparole equally severe sentences. (Koestner Questionnaire, pp. 1, 3).\n\n      Koestner’s testimony also shows that she was not predisposed to assess a\n\ndeath sentence. She confirmed her opinion that a life sentence was as severe as\n\nthe death penalty. She repeatedly stated that she would not automatically assess\n\na death sentence if she found him guilty. She said her feelings favoring the death\n\npenalty would not prevent her from following the law. She would keep an open\n\nmind to the evidence presented, and she would wait and apply the evidence to\n\nthe special issues. (RR33: 87, 92, 99, 108, 116-17, 132-37, 148-49). At one point\n\nduring questioning by defense counsel, Koestner became confused about\n\nwhether counsel was asking her about her feelings or her ability to follow the law\n\n                                        82\n\fin assessing punishment. (RR33: 142-46). To the extent Koestner’s answers during\n\nthat exchange created any conflict in her testimony, that conflict was the court’s\n\nto resolve and it resolved it against appellant. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\nGiven the totality of Koestner’s testimony, that decision was reasonable and\n\nproper.\n\n                                 Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Koestner would not give adequate consideration to\n\nhis mitigation evidence because on her questionnaire, she stated that she did not\n\nthink evidence of genetics, environment, upbringing, and background should be\n\nconsidered when determining punishment. (Koestner Questionnaire, p. 6). At\n\ntrial, however, Koestner testified that she would set aside those feelings and\n\nconsider the evidence in determining her answers to the special issues. (RR33:\n\n149-52). At most, her testimony and questionnaire showed that she might not\n\nregard such evidence as mitigating. This did not disqualify her from jury service\n\nbecause Koestner had no duty to treat any particular evidence as mitigating.\n\nStandefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. The court properly denied this challenge as well.\n\n\n\n\n                                        83\n\f                              Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant contends Koestner was biased because in her questionnaire she\n\nagreed that “police officers were more likely to tell the truth.” (Appellant’s Brief,\n\np. 71). In addition to that statement, Koestner added, “With cameras in the cars\n\nnow the officers have to tell the truth. The cameras don’t lie.” (Koestner\n\nQuestionnaire, p. 5). But at trial, Koestner agreed that all witnesses start out on\n\nequal footing and that she would wait and listen to each witness’s testimony\n\nbefore determining his credibility. (RR33: 118-19). Thus, Koestner held no bias\n\nagainst the law governing police officer testimony, and the court properly\n\noverruled this challenge.\n\n                            Following Court’s Instructions\n\n      Appellant contends Koestner’s response to question 41 in her\n\nquestionnaire shows that she would not follow the court’s instructions on the\n\nlaw. In question 41, Koestner agreed with the statement, “Regardless of what a\n\njudge says the law is, jurors should do what they believe is the right thing.” She\n\nalso added, “The jury must do as instructed, but can give the judge what they\n\nbelieve is right.” (Koestner Questionnaire, p. 7).\n\n\n\n                                          84\n\f      No one questioned Koestner about this statement during her testimony or\n\nexplained the law to her. Without first explaining to her that the law required\n\njurors to follow the court’s instructions, Koestner could not be deemed biased\n\nagainst the law. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667. Moreover, the totality of\n\nKoestner’s testimony shows that she understood and considered herself duty\n\nbound to follow the law if selected for the jury. Thus, if appellant had challenged\n\nKoestner on this basis at trial, denial of that challenge would have been proper.\n\n      Koestner was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and the Court should\n\noverruled Issue 15.\n\n                              Issue 16: Nancy Munn\n\n      Appellant exercised his sixteenth peremptory strike against venireperson\n\nNancy Munn. (RR36: 176-77). At trial, appellant objected that Munn was “death\n\nprone,” would not hold the State to its burden of proof regarding a “technicality,”\n\nand would presume police officers were more credible. (RR36: 170-74). On\n\nappeal, appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\nforegoing challenges. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 75-78). The record reflects otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                        85\n\f                                  “Death Prone”\n\n      Appellant contends Munn so strongly favored the death penalty that she\n\nwould automatically answer the future dangerousness special issue affirmatively\n\nif she found him guilty of capital murder. He claims she would also automatically\n\nanswer the second special issue “no” if she found him to be a future danger.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 74-78).\n\n      Although Munn’s questionnaire and testimony both show her strong\n\nsupport for the death penalty, her testimony shows that her feelings would not\n\naffect her ability to follow the law and assess a sentence based on the law and the\n\nevidence. Munn stated that she believed there could be some cases where life\n\nwithout parole would be an appropriate sentence. (RR36: 112). She also stated\n\nthat she believed some people could be rehabilitated. (RR36: 113). During\n\nquestioning by both sides, she repeatedly stated that she would not automatically\n\nanswer either special issue, that she thought the special issues were fair, and that\n\nshe would consider any evidence offered in determining her answers to the\n\nissues. She also stated that she believed there could be evidence that would\n\nconvince her appellant deserved a life sentence. (RR36: 117, 129-30, 134-35, 143-\n\n44, 150-62).\n\n                                        86\n\f      Appellant argues that some of Munn’s answers were equivocal,\n\ndemonstrating an uncertainty about her ability to follow the law. Any\n\nequivocation in Munn’s answers was for the trial court to resolve, and it was\n\nresolved against appellant. That determination is entitled to deference and is\n\nsupported by the totality of Munn’s testimony. Threadgill, 146 S.W.3d at 667.\n\n                               State’s Burden of Proof\n\n      Appellant argues that Munn could not hold the State to its burden of proof\n\non the issue of guilt because she would have difficulty acquitting someone based\n\non the State’s failure to prove a “technicality,” such as venue in Dallas County.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, p. 77). Munn’s testimony reflects, however, that she\n\nunderstood the State’s burden and her duty if the State failed to meet it. (RR36: ).\n\nWhen presented with the scenario of the State failing to prove venue, Munn\n\nstated, “It would have to be that he was innocent because it had to be in Dallas\n\nCounty.” (RR36: 124). During defense questioning, Munn expressed some distress\n\nat being put in the position of acquitting in that scenario. Still, she stated that she\n\nbelieved she could follow the law and acquit. (RR36: 145-47). The court properly\n\nfound no bias on this basis.\n\n\n\n                                          87\n\f                              Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant argues that Munn would give police officers more credibility than\n\nother witnesses. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 76). The record reflects the opposite. In her\n\nquestionnaire, Munn stated that she believed police officers are more likely to tell\n\nthe truth than the average person. But she also wrote, “I think they are people so\n\nthey make mistakes, however & also I think that suit gives some people a\n\nperceived power.” (Munn Questionnaire, p. 5). Furthermore, during her\n\ntestimony, Munn stated that she would treat all witnesses the same, that she did\n\nnot believe everyone tells the truth all of the time, and that police officers are\n\nhuman. She also stated that she would not automatically find an officer credible,\n\nbut would wait and listen to their testimony to judge their credibility. (RR36: 162-\n\n63). The court properly concluded that Munn held no bias in favor of a police\n\nofficer’s testimony.\n\n      Munn was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 16.\n\n                               Issue 17: Ernest Hand\n\n      Appellant requested additional strike to eliminate venireperson Ernest\n\nHand. The trial court denied the request, having already given appellant two\n\n                                         88\n\fadditional strikes.3 (RR39: 90-91). At trial, appellant objected that Hand was\n\n“death prone.” (RR39: 89-90). On appeal, appellant contends the trial court\n\nabused its discretion in denying this challenge. He also argues that the court\n\nshould have excused Hand because he would not fairly assess the credibility of\n\npolice officers and would not consider appellant’s mitigation evidence.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 80-81). Because the two additional grounds were not raised\n\nat trial, they are not preserved for appellate review. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\nNevertheless, appellant fails to demonstrate that Hand should have been excused\n\nfor cause on any of the three grounds argued on appeal.\n\n                                       “Death Prone”\n\n       Appellant argues that Hand was “death prone” because he strongly favored\n\nthe death penalty. In support of this contention, appellant cites Hand’s\n\nquestionnaire in which he stated that he thought the death penalty was used to\n\nseldom and that it took too long to administer. Also, he stated that he thought\n\nthe justice system was too lenient, slow, and inconsistent. (Appellant’s Brief, p.\n\n80).\n\n\n3\n  Appellant exercised his second extra strike (strike 17) against venireperson Robin Schwartz\n(RR37: 85). He challenged Schwartz for cause at trial, but does not complain about the denial of\nthat challenge on appeal. (RR37: 81-83).\n                                              89\n\f      Although Hand did strongly support the death penalty, his questionnaire\n\nreflects that he did not think it should be applied in all murder cases.\n\nFurthermore, during his testimony, Hand stated that he believed some murderers\n\ndeserve a life sentence. He also testified that he would not automatically assess a\n\ndeath sentence. He would wait and listen to the evidence and apply it to the\n\nspecial issues. (RR39: 27, 32, 37, 43-46, 64-65, 75-78, 83). The trial court properly\n\ndenied this challenge.\n\n                               Police Officer Credibility\n\n      Appellant argues that Hand was biased toward police officers. (Appellant’s\n\nBrief, p. 80). In support of this argument, appellant cites Hand’s questionnaire in\n\nwhich he stated that he agreed police officers were more likely to tell the truth\n\nthan the average person. According to Hand, “They are more accountable.” (Hand\n\nQuestionnaire, p. 5).\n\n      On their own, Hand’s statements in his questionnaire do not evince a bias\n\nin favor of officers. His statements reflect only that he expects officers to be\n\ntruthful, not that he will automatically find them more credible. Furthermore,\n\nHand testified that he understood he must treat all witnesses, including officers,\n\nalike, and wait until they testified to assess their credibility. (RR39: 44-46). Thus, if\n\n                                           90\n\fappellant had challenged Hand on this basis at trial, denial of that challenge\n\nwould have been proper.\n\n                                 Mitigation Bias\n\n      Appellant argues that Hand would not give adequate consideration to his\n\nmitigation evidence because on her questionnaire, he stated that he did not think\n\nevidence of genetics, environment, upbringing, and background should be\n\nconsidered when determining punishment. In addition, he wrote that “there is no\n\ncircumstance that gives a person the right to murder except in personal danger.”\n\n(Hand Questionnaire, p. 6).\n\n      At trial, Hand testified that he would listen to any evidence presented on\n\nthe special issues. (RR39: 43, 64-65, 75). At most, Hand’s questionnaire showed\n\nthat he might not regard evidence of background, environment, etc. as mitigating.\n\nThis did not disqualify him from jury service. Hand had no duty to treat any\n\nparticular evidence as mitigating. Standefer, 59 S.W.3d at 181. Thus, if appellant\n\nhad challenged Hand on this basis at trial, denial of that challenge would have\n\nbeen proper as well.\n\n      Hand was qualified to serve on appellant’s jury, and this Court should\n\noverrule Issue 17.\n\n                                       91\n\f                           Issue 18: Elizabeth McDaniel\n\n      Appellant challenged McDaniel on the basis that she was death prone and\n\nwould automatically assess a death sentence if she found the appellant guilty of\n\ncapital murder. Appellant argued that he did not believe she would give adequate\n\nconsideration to special issue number one. He also argued that, with regard to\n\nspecial issue number two, she would require him to testify and show remorse in\n\nviolation of his Fifth Amendment rights. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 81-83).\n\n      Nothing in McDaniel’s questionnaire or testimony supports appellant’s\n\ncontentions. McDaniel’s questionnaire showed that she strongly favored the\n\ndeath penalty, but it also showed that she did not think it was appropriate in\n\nevery case. (McDaniel Questionnaire, p. 1). Nowhere in her questionnaire did she\n\nstate that she thought a death sentence should be automatically assessed.\n\n(McDaniel Questionnaire). Throughout her testimony, McDaniel repeatedly\n\naffirmed that she would not automatically vote for death if she found appellant\n\nguilty and that she would wait and consider the evidence presented at\n\npunishment in answering the special issues. (RR39: 134, 142-43, 156-58, 163,\n\n165). She affirmed her understanding of special issue number one and that the\n\njury could not answer that issue “yes” unless the State met its burden of proof.\n\n                                         92\n\f(RR39: 134-38, 160-62). She affirmed that if she heard sufficiently mitigating\n\nevidence she could assess a life sentence. (RR39: 141). She stated her\n\nunderstanding that a defendant does not have testify and confirmed that she\n\nwould follow the court’s instruction not to consider a defendant’s failure to testify\n\nfor any purpose during her deliberation. (RR39: 144, 166).\n\n      McDaniel was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule\n\nIssue 18.\n\n                             Issue 19: Arleen Jimenez\n\n      Appellant challenged Jimenez on the basis that she would automatically\n\nassess the death penalty if she found the defendant guilty of capital murder. He\n\nalso challenged her on the basis that she viewed the death penalty as a deterrent\n\nand was not used enough. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 83-85).\n\n      Jimenez’s questionnaire shows only that she strongly favored the death\n\npenalty and that she thought it was an appropriate punishment in some murder\n\ncases, not all. She considered the death penalty and life without parole equally\n\nsevere sentences. (Jimenez Questionnaire, pp. 1-2). Further, Jimenez’s testimony\n\nshows that she was not predisposed to assess a death sentence. Jimenez stated\n\nthat she could follow the law and not automatically give someone a death\n\n                                         93\n\fsentence just because they have been found guilty. (RR40: 39-40, 48, 56, 60). She\n\naffirmed that she would keep an open mind and wait to hear all the evidence\n\nbefore she answered special issues. (RR40: 42, 48, 57-60, 62, 71-72). Appellant\n\nfails to demonstrate that Jimenez had a bias against him or the law in any way.\n\n      Jimenez was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule\n\nIssue 19.\n\n                                Issue 20: Dan Blanks\n\n      In his final issue, appellant complains that the trial court improperly denied\n\nhis challenge for cause against Dan Blanks. However, Mr. Blanks was the alternate\n\nand did not participate in jury deliberations. As such, appellant cannot show he\n\nwas harmed by the trial court’s ruling on his challenge for cause against Blanks.\n\n      In any event, appellant’s claims are without merit. Appellant challenged\n\nBlanks on the basis that he equated the death penalty with a guilty verdict. On\n\nappeal, appellant also argues that Blanks thought police officers were more likely\n\nto tell the truth that the average person. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 84-85). Because\n\nthis additional ground was not raised at trial, it is not preserved for appellate\n\nreview. Tex. R. App. P. 33.1.\n\n\n\n                                        94\n\f      Blanks’ questionnaire showed that he strongly favored the death penalty,\n\nbut it also showed that he did not think it was appropriate in every case. (Blanks\n\nQuestionnaire, p. 1). Nowhere in his questionnaire did he state that he thought a\n\ndeath sentence should be automatically assessed. (Blanks Questionnaire). During\n\nhis testimony, Blanks affirmed that he would not automatically vote for death if\n\nhe found appellant guilty and that he would wait and consider all the evidence\n\nbefore making any decision on how to answer the special issues. (RR41: 36-37, 48-\n\n49, 53, 59-60, 64). He also affirmed that he would judge the credibility of the\n\nwitness based on their testimony, not before he or she testifies. (RR41: 38-39). As\n\nsuch, Blanks was qualified to sit on the jury, and this Court should overrule Issue\n\n20.\n\n                                   Conclusion\n\n      Appellant has not shown even one erroneous ruling on his challenges for\n\ncause, much less three erroneous rulings. Therefore, he has not shown this Court\n\nthat he was denied the use of a statutorily provided peremptory strike. Issues 1\n\nthrough 20 should be denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                        95\n\f        Issues 21 and 22: Constitutional Right To Fair And Impartial Jury\n\n      In Issues 21 and 22, appellant contends the trial court’s denial of his\n\nchallenges for cause deprived him of a lawfully constituted jury resulting in\n\nviolations of his rights under the state and federal constitutions and under article\n\n35.16 of the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 88-89).\n\n      Appellant’s contentions are meritless. He has failed to show the trial court’s\n\nrulings on any of the challenges resulted in the seating of a juror who was biased\n\nor prejudiced. If an appellant does not present record evidence demonstrating\n\nthat the trial court’s error deprived him of a jury comprised of legally qualified\n\njurors, he has suffered no harm and the reviewing court should presume the\n\njurors are qualified.

A court may consider several factors in determining\n\nwhether the probative value of photographs is substantially outweighed by the\n\ndanger of unfair prejudice, including but not limited to: the number of exhibits\n\noffered, their gruesomeness, their detail, their size, whether they are black and\n\nwhite or color, whether they are close-up, and whether the body depicted is\n\nnaked or clothed. Id. A reviewing court must also consider the availability of other\n\nmeans of proof and the circumstances unique to each individual case. Id.\n\n        Issues 23 and 24: The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion by\n       Overruling Appellant’s Objections to State’s Exhibits 4-9 and 11-23\n\n      In a pretrial hearing held outside the presence of the jury, appellant\n\nrequested that the trial court make a threshold determination of the admissibility\n\nof autopsy photographs of the victims. (RR42: 28-30). He argued that because the\n\ndefense was conceding guilt and there was no issue with regard to the cause of\n\ndeath of the victims, no autopsy photographs should be admitted because they\n\nhave no probative value and are only being offered to inflame the jury. (RR42: 28-\n\n34). The State notified the trial court that it was in possession of over 170\n\nphotographs, some of them quite graphic, but that they had met with the medical\n                                     98\n\fexaminer and selected only the ones necessary to aid her in explaining the injuries\n\nsustained by the children. (RR42: 30, 34, 39). The trial court examined the thirteen\n\nphotographs of Elijah Muhammad and six photographs of Naim Muhammad that\n\nthe State planned to offer. (RR42: 34-38; State’s Exhibits 4-9, 11-23). The trial\n\ncourt found the probative value the photographs outweighed the prejudicial\n\neffect and overruled appellant’s objections. (RR42: 36-38).\n\n      All of the photographs admitted were in color and were 8 ½ by 11 inches.\n\nState’s Exhibits 11-23 are autopsy photographs of Elijah. Exhibits 11 and 12 depict\n\nhow Elijah appeared when he arrived at the medical examiner’s office and the\n\nclothes he was wearing. Additionally, Dr. Dyer used exhibit 11 to explain the\n\nprocess of postmortem purging, and exhibit 12 to explain their standard practice\n\nfor collecting fingernail clippings. (RR42: 122-23; State’s Exhibits 11-12). She\n\nexplained that after the “as-is” photographs are taken of the victim, the body is\n\ncleaned up for the autopsy and re-photographed, which is what is depicted in\n\nexhibit 13. (RR42: 124; State’s Exhibit 13).\n\n      Dr. Dyer used exhibits 14-21 to describe the various injuries she observed\n\nduring the external examination of Elijah. Although Elijah is not clothed, all of the\n\nphotographs are close-ups of specific parts of his body. The photographs are not\n\n                                          99\n\frepetitious and each depicts a different area of injury. Specifically, exhibits 14 and\n\n15 depict the facial injuries he sustained; exhibit 16 depicts a linear abrasion on\n\nhis back; exhibit 17 depicts abrasions on the outside of the leg; exhibit 18 depicts\n\nabrasions and a blister on the sole of his left foot; exhibit 19 depicts abrasions on\n\nthe top of the right foot; exhibit 20 depicts abrasions on the back side of his right\n\nleg; and exhibit 21 depicts an abrasion on his wrist. (RR42: 124-26; State’s Exhibits\n\n14-21). Dr. Dyer used exhibits 22 and 23 to describe the injuries she observed\n\nduring the internal examination of Elijah. Exhibit 22 depicts the bruising on the\n\ninside of his scalp and exhibit 23 depicts the dirt and debris that were found in his\n\nairway. (RR42: 126-28; State’s Exhibits 22-23).\n\n      State’s Exhibits 4-9, autopsy photographs of Naim, were used in the same\n\nmanner as the photographs of Elijah contained in State’s Exhibits 11-23. State’s\n\nExhibit 4 is the “as-is” photograph of Naim – it depicts the clothes he was wearing\n\nand how he presented when he arrived at the medical examiner’s office.

Furthermore, in the realm of capital murder victim\n\nphotos, the pictures are nothing close to gruesome. See, e.g., Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at\n\n763-64 (upholding admission of twenty-three photographs of 3 year-old victim\n\n                                        101\n\fincluding photographs of vaginal injuries, internal injuries including close-ups of\n\ncracked ribs, a picture in which the rib had been removed from the body, various\n\nviews of the underside of the victim’s scalp and the victim’s skull, and one picture\n\nof the victim’s brain). Sixteen of the nineteen photos admitted in this case are\n\npre-autopsy and show only external abrasions inflicted during the offense.

(RR43: 133). Appellant argued that, in light of their concession of guilt,\n\nthere was no probative value in admitting the photographs and they were only\n\nbeing offered to provoke a visceral response from the mother on the witness\n                                     102\n\fstand. (RR43: 133-35). The State argued that, despite any conciliatory statements\n\nmade by appellant during voir dire and the guilt phase, he did not plead guilty and\n\nthey are still required to prove the identity of the decedents beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. (RR43: 135). The trial court examined the two photographs and overruled\n\nappellant’s objection. (RR43: 136-41).\n\n      State’s Exhibit 77 is an autopsy identification photo of Elijah. He is shown\n\nunclothed from the chest up, lying on a table. The medical examiner’s placard\n\nshowing autopsy identification number IFS-11-12022 is placed across his chest.\n\n(State’s Exhibit 77). State’s Exhibit 78 is an autopsy identification photo of Naim.\n\nHe is also shown unclothed from the chest up, lying on a table, and a placard with\n\nautopsy identification number IFS-11-12023 is across his chest. (State’s Exhibit\n\n78). At the conclusion of the direct examination of Kametra, the State showed her\n\nexhibits 77 and 78. (RR43: 141). Kametra identified the individual in exhibit 77 as\n\nElijah and the individual in exhibit 78 as Naim. (RR43: 141). There was no outburst\n\nor visceral response by Kametra when she viewed the photographs. (RR43: 141).\n\n      Kametra’s identification of the individuals in State’s Exhibits 77 and 78\n\nlinked Dr. Dyer’s autopsy reports to the named victims.

The complained-of argument went as follows:\n\n      MS. SWEET: He told you what he did. He took those two little boys\n      down to the nasty, smelly overgrown creek, and he carried one\n      down, and the other one he was holding a hand. The little boy was\n      reaching out and grabbing Daddy’s shirt. Did they know what Daddy\n      was going to do? They did because they were crying, Daddy, Daddy,\n      we love you. We love you, Daddy. They knew they were going to die.\n      He had already told them. What did he tell them? Your mama don't\n      want us anymore. Your mama doesn’t want us. That’s what he told\n      them. What better way to get back at her than to kill those two kids?\n      That’s why he did it. He did it to get back at her. He did it to make\n      sure that no other man would ever show them any real love, so no\n      other man would be a real father like he never was.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Excuse me, Judge. I’m going on object to this\n      argument, the entirety of this argument. It is outside the scope of the\n      guilt/innocence issue before this jury, and I would ask the Court to\n      instruct the prosecutor to limit her remarks to the evidence that goes\n      to the proof or denial of whether or not the Defendant committed\n      the offense.\n\n      THE COURT: Ms. Sweet, just argue the evidence and the law. Thank\n      you.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: And, Judge, I’m going to ask that the instruction be\n      limited further to argue the evidence and the law as it applies to\n      whether or not the Defendant committed the offense.\n\n      THE COURT: I have already instructed the prosecutor. Argue the\n                                   106\n\f      evidence and the law. Proceed, Ms. Sweet.\n\n      MS. SWEET: Y’all can remember the evidence that you heard\n      yesterday, Monday. He took those kids down there and he knew\n      what he was going do, and he told them to sit down. What did he tell\n      them? Put your head down in the water and act like you are\n      swimming. And that’s when he took his hands and he put them on\n      each kid and he held their head under the water. Can you imagine\n      what that must have felt like? What were those kids thinking?\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Judge, again, I'm going to object again. This entire\n      argument is now outside the scope of guilt/innocence and we're\n      going to object to it at this phase of the trial.\n\n      THE COURT: I will overrule the objection.\n\n      MS. SWEET: That's how he killed them, in a dirty, nasty creek. That's\n      where their life ended. It's the first day of school for Naim, but it was\n      the last day of his life. So these two little precious boys, two little\n      precious innocent babies, they were crying for their mother. That\n      was in evidence. They were crying for mom. They are crying for mom\n      to help them. And this is how they end up. This is his handiwork right\n      here. That is how they ended up. That's what he did to them. That's\n      how much they meant to him and then he left them there like\n      garbage.\n\n(RR44: 25-28).\n\n      Appellant’s complaint was not preserved and is not properly briefed\n\n      To preserve a complaint regarding improper jury argument for appellate\n\nreview, a party must make a timely request, objection, or motion with sufficient\n\nspecificity to apprise the trial court of the complaint. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a);\n\n                                        107\n\fEstrada v.

Crim. App. 2010). Trial counsel failed\n\nto explain how the argument fell outside the scope of the guilt-innocence portion\n\nof the trial, nor is it apparent from the face of the argument. Consequently, trial\n\ncounsel’s objection lacked sufficient specificity to make the trial court aware of\n\nthe exact nature of his complaint, and therefore, has failed to preserve this issue\n\nfor review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a) .\n\n      Additionally, appellant has failed to adequately brief this issue on appeal.\n\nAppellant claims that the prosecutor’s remarks concerning what the victims felt\n\nwhen their heads were held under water was improper because it was outside of\n\nthe scope of guilt-innocence because it injected facts not in the record, was\n\n“maudlin” and “in poor taste,” and its only purpose was to begin to create\n\nprejudice toward appellant. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 98-99). However, appellant\n\nfails to cite any case law that supports his assertion that the prosecutor’s\n\nargument was improper. Rule 38.1 of the Texas Rules of Appellate Procedure\n\nrequires that a brief contain a clear and concise argument for the contentions\n\nmade with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 38.1(i). Because appellant has wholly failed to make a clear argument and cite\n\n\n\n                                            108\n\fappropriate authorities, his argument is inadequately briefed and should be\n\nsummarily denied.\n\n          The trial court did not err by overruling appellant’s objection\n\n      Should this Court consider this issue, despite counsel’s failure to properly\n\npreserve and brief the issue, the record reflects that the trial court properly\n\noverruled appellant’s objection. The complained-of argument fell within the\n\npermissible areas of argument because the remarks were a proper summation\n\nand called for reasonable deductions from the evidence presented at trial.\n\n      The evidence presented at trial indicated that appellant abducted Kametra,\n\nNaim, and Elijah as the three of them walked to Naim’s school. As appellant then\n\ndrove them through the neighborhood, he threatened Kametra and the boys.\n\nWhen appellant stopped at a red light, Kametra saw a constable parked nearby\n\nand jumped out of the car, to get the constable’s help. Appellant, who had\n\nwarned Kametra not to jump out of the car, sped off with Naim and Elijah. Elijah,\n\nwho was in the backseat of the car with Naim, began to cry and ask for his\n\nmother. Appellant told both boys that she did not love them. Appellant then\n\ndrove to a secluded creek. Because Elijah did not have shoes on, he carried Elijah\n\ndown to the creek bed, while Naim walked beside them, holding on to appellant’s\n\n                                       109\n\fshirt. Next, appellant forced them to sit down in the water with their backs to\n\nhim. Both boys were crying; Elijah asking for his mother and Naim telling\n\nappellant that he loved him. Appellant then forced both boys to place their heads\n\nunder the water, telling them to pretend like they were swimming, and held their\n\nheads under the water until both boys stopped moving.\n\n      Accordingly, the prosecutor’s remarks merely asked the jury to use their\n\nexperience and knowledge to deduce from the evidence the level of confusion\n\nand fear the boys felt as a result of the appellant’s actions. Such argument was\n\npermissible and appropriate. See Palermo v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425750\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425750/palermo-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">691</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.)

Consequently, the\n\ntrial court did not err in overruling appellant’s objection to this argument.\n\n                             Error, if any, was harmless\n\n      Nevertheless, even if this Court were to find that the State’s argument was\n\nimproper, any error was harmless.\n\n      Improper argument is non-constitutional error, and non-constitutional\n\nerror that does not affect a defendant’s substantial rights must be disregarded.\n\nBrown v.

Crim. App. 2008); Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.2(b). To determine whether an appellant’s substantial rights were affected, an\n\nappellate court balances three factors: (1) the severity of the misconduct (i.e., the\n\nprejudicial effect), (2) any curative measures, and (3) the certainty of conviction\n\nabsent the misconduct. See Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572-73. In evaluating the\n\nseverity of the misconduct, the reviewing court must assess whether the\n\nargument injected new and harmful facts or was, in light of the entire argument,\n\n                                         111\n\fextreme or manifestly unjust and willfully calculated to deprive appellant of a fair\n\nand impartial trial. Id. at 573.\n\n      Viewing the State’s closing argument as a whole, the record does not\n\ndemonstrate that there was a willful, calculated effort to deprive the appellant of\n\na fair and impartial trial. The argument made no reference to the punishment\n\nphase or special issues and did not inject new facts into the record. The\n\nprosecutor was simply asking the jury to apply their general knowledge and\n\nexperience to the evidence that was properly before them and imagine what was\n\ngoing through the minds of the victims during the murders. The details in the\n\nargument were summations and reasonable deductions from the evidence, most\n\nof which came from appellant’s statement to the police. While the trial court did\n\nnot take any curative measures, this was because the judge overruled the\n\nappellant’s objection. Finally, the evidence of appellant’s guilt was overwhelming.\n\nAppellant gave a voluntary statement to the police in which he confessed to the\n\nmurders. Appellant did not present any evidence during the guilt-innocence\n\nphase of the trial and, in fact, conceded guilt during his closing argument.\n\nFurthermore, witness testimony corroborated appellant’s confession, as did the\n\nforensic evidence establishing the cause of death of both victims. Based on the\n\n                                        112\n\fevidence presented, the jury most certainly would have convicted appellant\n\nregardless of the prosecutor’s statements. Thus, any error in the prosecutor’s\n\nargument did not affect appellant’s substantial rights. See Brown, 270 S.W.3d at\n\n572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Issue 27 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                          Closing Argument at Punishment\n\n      In Issue 41, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the State’s closing argument during the punishment phase of trial.\n\n      During closing argument at the punishment phase, defense counsel made\n\nthe following argument:\n\n      MR. JOHSNON: The evidence in this case from Kametra, this history\n      of domestic violence, folks, all I can tell you is that, by all accounts,\n      we’ve got a situation where now Kametra comes in and I agree with\n      what was said earlier, she hates the Defendant for what he did, and\n      reasonably so. And unlike what she told us when I met with her and\n      my consultants, now the violence has escalated, it is more of it.\n\n      You know, that’s what happens in courtrooms, folks. What we really\n      know is that about the time when Rasool is locked up for that\n      incident with his sister, we know that she is running around on him,\n      and she is writing him letters, and then we know that then while he is\n      still incarcerated, she gets caught for leaving her kids locked up in a\n      car outside while she is off galavanting, and we know now that she\n      ran off and she is now this sophisticated prostitute. And think about\n      this, folks. And like I said, Kametra is not on trial. But they are\n      wanting you to think that she is only this victim because it fits well\n                                        113\n\f      into their theory, but she has told you, folks, that she is out there and\n      she is running around with a guy twice her age. She has got the\n      wherewithal to start running the internet prostitution scheme. She\n      said it is her idea. She has got a $3,000 a month drug habit. $3,000 a\n      month. And she tells you she had no way to get away from the\n      Defendant.\n\n(RR50: 72-73). In rebuttal, the State made the following complained-of argument:\n\n      MS. KEMP: Now, I asked Kametra.

KEMP: This is evidence. You have a young lady who was raped\n      when she was 8. She had a child when she was 17. She decided to be\n      a prostitute rather than be with Mr. Muhammad, to provide for her\n      kids. One way or another, he is no longer in her life, and like Maya\n      Angelo, she can go on and be anything she wants to, if she decides.\n\n(RR50: 84-86).\n\n      On appeal, appellant argues that the remarks about Maya Angelou’s life\n\nhistory were outside of the record and therefore, impermissible. Appellant\n\ncontends that the statements were calculated to inflame the minds of the jury\n\n\n\n                                         115\n\fand prejudice the appellant such that the jury would be certain to return a verdict\n\nof death.\n\n            The trial court did not err by overruling appellant’s objection\n\n      The record reflects that the trial court properly overruled appellant’s\n\nobjection because the argument was made in response to the argument of\n\ndefense counsel and also constituted a summation and reasonable deduction\n\nfrom the evidence.\n\n      During his closing argument, defense counsel attacked the credibility and\n\ncharacter of State’s witness Kametra Sampson, stating that the instances of\n\ndomestic violence she testified to had “escalated” from those that she had\n\ndescribed to defense counsel in a previous meeting. Counsel described Kametra\n\nas a “sophisticated prostitute” running an “internet prostitution scheme” with a\n\n$3,000 a month drug habit, and that she was only being presented as a victim\n\nbecause it fit the State’s theory. (RR50: 72-73). The State’s argument challenged\n\nthis characterization of Kametra by comparing her to another reputable and well-\n\nknown woman with a similar background. The State’s comparison was based on\n\nKametra’s testimony and reasonable deductions from that testimony.\n\n\n\n                                         116\n\f      The testimony presented at trial revealed that Kametra was raped by her\n\nmother’s boyfriend when she was eight years old. She began a sexual relationship\n\nwith the appellant when she was just fifteen and appellant was twenty-five.\n\nKametra had her first child when she was seventeen and had two more children in\n\nthe next few years. Kametra testified that she endured violent beatings at the\n\nhands of the appellant throughout their relationship, and eventually resorted to\n\nprostitution in order to provide for herself and her children so that she did not\n\nhave to remain in an abusive relationship with the appellant. Kametra also\n\nadmitted to an expensive drug habit. However, she also testified that she was no\n\nlonger a prostitute and had sought treatment for her drug addiction in order to\n\nimprove her life.\n\n      Accordingly, the prosecutor appropriately analogized Kametra’s life to\n\nMaya Angelou. It was a reasonable deduction from the evidence that Kametra,\n\nlike Angelou, could change her life. While appellant is correct that there was no\n\nevidence before the jury specifically concerning Maya Angelou’s life, Angelou is a\n\npublic figure whose life history is common knowledge. Arguing facts that\n\nare common knowledge is an exception to the prohibition against arguing facts\n\noutside the record. See Nenno v.

Therefore, the trial court did not err in overruling appellant’s objection.\n\n                            Error, if any, was harmless\n\n      Even if this Court were to find that the State’s argument was improper, any\n\nerror was harmless. As previously noted, improper jury argument is non-\n\nconstitutional error that must be disregarded unless it affects the defendant’s\n\nsubstantial rights. Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Viewing the State's closing argument as a whole, it cannot be concluded\n\nthat there was a willful and calculated effort to deprive appellant of a fair and\n\nimpartial trial. The prosecutor’s remarks were made in response to defense\n\ncounsel’s argument and were summations and reasonable deductions from the\n\nevidence. It is clear that the prosecutor did not have an improper motive. While\n\nthe trial court did not take any curative measures, the prosecutor’s reference to\n\nAngelou was brief and only a small portion of the entire argument.\n\n      Furthermore, the evidence supporting the jury’s answer to the special\n\nissues was overwhelming. In addition to the evidence showing the calculated and\n\ndeliberate nature of the heinous double-murder for which the jury had just found\n\n                                        118\n\fappellant guilty, the State also presented considerable evidence during the\n\npunishment phase showing appellant’s extensive juvenile record, his inability to\n\nfollow instructions or rules while confined as a juvenile or while awaiting trial for\n\ncapital murder, and his acts of violence against women. Accordingly, this Court\n\ncan be assured that the jury would have returned the same answer to the special\n\nissues absent the prosecutor’s comment. Thus, any error in the prosecutor’s\n\nargument did not affect appellant’s substantial rights. See Brown, 270 S.W.3d at\n\n572; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Issue 41 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n          Issue 28: Admission of Appellant’s Statements to CPS Worker\n\n      In Issue 28, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the testimony of CPS worker Pamela Womack. According to\n\nappellant, it was improper for Womack to testify regarding statements made to\n\nher by appellant while he was in custody where the State failed to show that he\n\nwas given the proper Miranda warnings. (Appellant’s Brief, 99-102).\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      Womack serves as a Special Investigator for CPS, where she assists primary\n\ncase workers with their interviews and investigations. (RR46: 118-19). Womack\n\n                                        119\n\finterviewed appellant and assisted in interviews with other members of\n\nappellant’s family. (RR46: 119-20). Womack explained that she does these\n\ninterviews as part of the development of a social history for the primary case\n\nworker’s file. (RR46: 120-21). CPS was conducting an investigation in this instance\n\nbecause they were trying to determine the placement of appellant’s and\n\nKametra’s remaining child, Jeremiah. (RR46: 121).\n\n      Appellant objected to Womack testifying to any statements made by\n\nappellant during the interview unless the State could establish he was given\n\nMiranda warnings. (RR46: 122, 124-25). When taken on voir dire by defense\n\ncounsel, Womack made it clear that she did not speak with anyone in law\n\nenforcement prior to her interview of appellant and that her interview was\n\nconducted for CPS, not law enforcement. (RR46: 122-24). In response to\n\nappellant’s objection and argument, the State reiterated that the purpose of the\n\nCPS investigation in this case was to determine what to do with Jeremiah. (RR46:\n\n125). The trial court overruled appellant’s objection. (RR46: 125).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      A trial court’s decision to admit testimony of a CPS worker is reviewed for\n\nan abuse of discretion and must be affirmed so long as the decision is within the\n\n                                        120\n\fzone of reasonable disagreement.

They generally apply only to custodial interrogation by law\n\nenforcement officers or their agents. Wilkerson, 173 S.W.3d at 527. Although a\n\nCPS worker is an employee of the state, state employment does not, by itself,\n\nmake a person a state agent for purposes of defining custodial interrogation. Id.\n\nat 528. As the Wilkerson court explained:\n\n      Although state employment clearly makes a person an “agent of the\n      State,” that label does not, by itself, make the person an “agent of\n      the State” for the purpose of defining “custodial interrogation.” Not\n      all government workers must be familiar with and ready to\n      administer Miranda warnings . . . . *W+hen “the official has not been\n\n                                       121\n\f      given police powers, Miranda has been held inapplicable to\n      questioning by *state officials+.”\n\nId. at 528. The court further observed that different types of state employees\n\nserve different roles. Id. CPS workers are charged with protecting the welfare and\n\nsafety of children in the community while the police are responsible for\n\ninvestigating crime. See id. Therefore, police officers and CPS workers generally\n\nrun on separate, yet parallel paths. Id. at 529. CPS’s role may be converted if its\n\nparallel path converges with police, and the organizations are investigating a\n\ncriminal offense in tandem. Id.\n\n      To determine whether the two paths have converged, courts must examine\n\nthe entire record. Id. at 530. The thrust of the inquiry is whether the custodial\n\ninterview was conducted explicitly or implicitly on behalf of the police for the\n\npurpose of gathering evidence or statements to be used in a later criminal\n\nproceeding against the interviewee. Id. at 531. The defendant bears the burden of\n\nproving that a particular person is working in tandem with police in a joint\n\ninvestigation, primarily because the law does not presume such a relationship. Id.\n\nat 529-30, 32.\n\n\n\n\n                                       122\n\f                  Womack’s Testimony Was Properly Admitted\n\n      Appellant has failed to meet that burden in this case. Womack’s testimony\n\nunequivocally showed that she did not interview appellant at the behest of law\n\nenforcement. She was not gathering information to be used in a later criminal\n\nproceeding. Rather, her primary purpose in interviewing appellant was to\n\ndetermine the future care of the surviving child. (RR46: 120-21, 125, 130-31).\n\nRegardless of the outcome of appellant’s criminal case, it is not surprising that\n\nthat CPS would need to collect data to determine the best interests of the child\n\nfollowing the tragedy. See Wilkerson, 173 S.W.3d at 530. Having that limited\n\npurpose does not somehow magically connect Womack with the police\n\ninvestigation of appellant’s case.\n\n      Womack was not an agent of law enforcement who was required to comply\n\nwith Miranda. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling\n\nappellant’s objection to Womack’s testimony. See, e.g, Berry, 233 S.W.3d at 856\n\n(trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting testimony of CPS worker;\n\nbecause the CPS worker’s purpose in interviewing Berry was to find placement for\n\nBerry’s children, she was not an agent of the law enforcement who was required\n\nto comply with Miranda).\n\n                                       123\n\f                               Any Error Harmless\n\n      Even if the court should have excluded Womack’s testimony, the admission\n\nof this evidence did not violate appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.2(b). The statements made by appellant to Womack did not shed new light on\n\nthe offense or appellant’s feelings about his childhood or his relationship with\n\nKametra. Appellant generally denied having a bad childhood or any mental health\n\nissues; and while he disclosed Kametra’s previous drug-usage and prostitution, he\n\ndid not claim she was an unfit mother or otherwise speak badly about her. Same\n\nor similar testimony regarding appellant’s perception of his childhood, mental\n\nhealth, and feelings toward Kametra was admitted without objection through\n\nother witnesses. Moreover, counsel used cross-examination of Womack to show\n\nthat appellant became quite emotional on multiple occasions during the interview\n\nwhen describing what had happened with the kids and the things that had gone\n\non in his life. Thus, any error in the admission of this testimony was harmless.\n\nIssue 28 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                    Issue 29: Admission of State’s Exhibit 173\n\n      In Issue 29, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to State’s Exhibit 173, certified business records pertaining to\n\n                                        124\n\fappellant’s prior conviction for evading arrest in cause number MB97-57574-K.\n\nAppellant contends that because the judgment did not contain an identifying\n\nfingerprint, the conviction was not properly tied to appellant and should not have\n\nbeen admitted. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 102-04).\n\n                                     Pertinent Facts\n\n       On July 30, 1997, appellant committed two offenses as part of a continuous\n\ncriminal episode: burglary of a motor vehicle and evading arrest. He was charged\n\nwith these offenses in cause numbers MA97-57573-K and MB97-57574-K. On\n\nSeptember 19, 1997, appellant pleaded guilty to both offenses and was sentenced\n\nto 120 days confinement, probated for twelve months in each case. (State’s\n\nExhibits 172-73). Subsequently, his community supervision was revoked and he\n\nwas sentenced to 120 days’ confinement in each case.4 (State’s Exhibit 173).\n\n       During the punishment phase of trial, the State offered exhibits 172 and\n\n173, certified copies of the judgments and other business records pertaining to\n\n\n\n\n4\n The State’s electronic records reflect that appellant’s community supervision was revoked in\nboth cases on March 31, 1998. The State received a certified copy of the Judgment Revoking\nCommunity Supervision from the county clerk in the burglary case (State’s Exhibit 172);\nhowever, the State did not receive a certified copy of the Judgment Revoking Community\nSupervision from the county clerk in the evading arrest case for an unknown reason. (State’s\nExhibits 173).\n                                            125\n\fthese convictions. (RR44: 106-07, 109; State’s Exhibits 172-73). Exhibit 172\n\ncontained a fingerprint which was matched to the fingerprint of appellant taken\n\nthat day. (RR44: 100-01, 103-04; State’s Exhibits 169, 172). Exhibit 173 contained\n\nno fingerprint for comparison. (RR44: 100-01, 103, 106). The State presented\n\ntestimony that exhibits 172 and 173 pertained to offenses with consecutive cause\n\nnumbers, contained matching identifying information of appellant, and reflected\n\nthat appellant pleaded guilty and was adjudicated guilty of these offenses on the\n\nsame day. (RR44: 106). Appellant did not object to exhibit 172. (RR44: 106). He\n\nobjected to exhibit 173 on the basis that there was lack of a predicate and failure\n\nto establish correlation between the exhibit and the appellant. (RR44: 106).\n\nAppellant’s objection was overruled. (RR44:106).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      To establish a defendant’s prior criminal conviction, the State must prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt the following: (1) that a prior conviction exists, and (2)\n\nthat the defendant is linked to that conviction.

They were filed\n\nunder the same service number, 640854F, and same arrest number, 052103. They\n\ncontain the same identifying information for appellant, including his full name as\n\nNaim Muhammad; physical description of “BM;” birthdate of 05-03-79; address of\n\n3326 Kyser, Dallas, Texas 75216; and phone number of 214-374-0141. The\n\nsignature of “Naim Muhammad” contained on the court’s admonishments and\n                                 127\n\forder appointing counsel in each case is the same. Finally, the “Judgment on\n\nNegotiated Plea of Guilty or Nolo Contendere Before Judge Community\n\nSupervision Granted” in each case reflects that appellant pleaded guilty and was\n\nadjudicated of both offenses on the same date, September 19, 1997. (State’s\n\nExhibits 172-73). Viewing the totality of the evidence, the trier of fact could have\n\nreasonably determined that there was a prior conviction for evading arrest and\n\nthat appellant was the person convicted. See Flowers, 220 S.W.3d at 923.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by overruling appellant’s\n\nobjection to State’s Exhibit 173.\n\n                                Any Error Harmless\n\n      Even if this Court were to find error in the trial court’s ruling, the admission\n\nof this evidence did not violate appellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P.\n\n44.2(b). Exhibit 173 was one of seven prior convictions, the rest of which were\n\nunquestionably proven by documentary and testimonial evidence. The State\n\nproved that appellant committed numerous extraneous unadjudicated offenses\n\nduring his twenty-year history of criminal activity. The State presented evidence\n\nof appellant’s repeated infractions while in Daytop, TYC and Dallas County Jail,\n\nand his violence toward women. The jury also had before it the heinous facts of\n\n                                        128\n\fthe capital murder. In viewing the entire record as a whole, it is highly unlikely\n\nthat the inclusion of exhibit 173 influenced the outcome of the trial. Accordingly,\n\nany error in the admission of this exhibit was harmless.\n\n      Issue 29 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n         Issues 30-32: Admission of Testimony from Refreshed Memory\n\n      In Issues 30-32, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling\n\nhis objections to the testimony of police officers who used police reports to\n\nrefresh their memory. He contends that State allowed its witnesses to testify from\n\ndocuments not in evidence under the guise of refreshing their recollection in\n\norder to get in evidence that was otherwise not admissible. (See App. BR. at 105-\n\n07). His contentions are wholly without merit.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      Texas evidentiary rules allow a witness in a criminal case to refresh his or\n\nher memory either while testifying or before testifying.

Further, a writing need not be prepared by the person\n\nwho is having their memory refreshed, but rather, the focus should be that the\n\nperson testifying has their own personal recollection refreshed. See id.\n\n                               Officer Chris Havens\n\n      According to appellant’s brief, the complaints raised in issues 30 and 31\n\npertain to the testimony of Officer Chris Havens. (See App. Br. at 105). However,\n\nthe portions of the record he cites pertain to the testimony of Officer Harold\n\nAndrews. To the extent that his record citation is a typographical error and his\n\nclaims do relate to the testimony of Chris Havens, the record shows they are\n\nwholly without merit.\n\n      Former Dallas Police Officer Chris Havens was the officer who arrested\n\nappellant following his burglary of the habitation of Ivis Wright. Wright sold candy\n\nto kids in her neighborhood. (RR44: 131). Prior to testifying, Officer Havens\n\nreviewed the police report and recalled the incident because of the candy that\n\nwas stolen during the burglary. (RR44: 125, 131). Officer Havens testified that he\n\nresponded to a call reporting a burglary on February 26, 1993. (RR44: 124-25).\n\nAfter a witness at the scene identified a group of juveniles nearby as the\n\n                                        130\n\fperpetrators of the burglary, Officer Havens and other officers pursued them in a\n\nfoot chase, eventually catching them and taking them into custody. (RR44: 125-\n\n26). When Officer Havens was asked whether he could identify the individual that\n\nhe arrested and booked-in on that date, he responded, “According to the arrest\n\nreport, yes, ma’am.” (RR44: 126). Appellant objected to Officer Havens testifying\n\nto details he did not have personal knowledge of. (RR44: 126-27). His objection\n\nwas overruled. (RR44: 126). The State rephrased its question and Officer Havens\n\ntestified that, based on his refreshed recollection from the police report, Naim\n\nRasool Muhammad was the individual he arrested and booked-in on that date.\n\n(RR44: 127).\n\n      Appellant did not object at trial on the basis that Officer Havens was\n\ntestifying from a record not in evidence and offering personal information after\n\nusing a document he did not prepare to refresh his memory. As such, his\n\ncomplaints have not been preserved for review. See Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n      In any event, the record shows that Officer Havens did not testify from a\n\ndocument. Rather, he properly refreshed his memory using his report. Based on\n\nthis refreshed memory, he was able to recall that Naim Rasool Muhammad was\n\nthe individual he arrested and booked-in for burglary on the date in question. The\n\n                                       131\n\ftrial court did not err in allowing Officer Havens to testify from his refreshed\n\nmemory. See Young, 891 S.W.2d at 951.\n\n                             Officer Harold Andrews\n\n      To the extent that appellant’s record citations are correct and the\n\ncomplaints raised in issues 30 and 31 pertain to the cited testimony of Officer\n\nHarold Andrews, these contentions are also without merit.\n\n      Dallas Police Lieutenant Harold Andrews was the officer who detained\n\nappellant for burglary of a vehicle on July 27, 1994. (RR44: 140-41). Lt. Andrews\n\nwas driving around the area where the burglary occurred and spotted appellant,\n\nwho matched the description of one of the suspects. (RR44: 142). Lt. Andrews\n\ndetained appellant and brought him back to the scene of the burglary, where he\n\nwas identified by the complainant as one of the perpetrators. (RR44: 142-43). Lt.\n\nAndrews testified that it was standard procedure for him to gather personal\n\ninformation from appellant at the time he detained him. (RR44: 146, 148-49, 150-\n\n51). He relayed that information to another officer at the scene, who compiled\n\nthe information from all the officers involved and made a single report of the\n\nincident. (RR44: 142-43, 154).\n\n\n\n                                      132\n\f      Lt. Andrews reviewed this report prior to testifying to refresh his memory\n\nof the incident. (RR44: 141, 145). He was also asked to review this report during\n\nhis testimony to refresh his recollection of appellant’s full name and date of birth.\n\n(RR44: 144). Appellant objected to Lt. Andrews testifying from a report not in\n\nevidence and to him refreshing his memory from a document he did not prepare.\n\n(RR44: 144, 148-49, 151-52). The trial court overruled his objections and allowed\n\nLt. Andrews to refresh his memory. (RR44: 144-45). After refreshing his memory,\n\nLt. Andrews testified that the person he detained that day was named Naim\n\nMuhammad with a birthdate of May 3, 1979. (RR44: 152-53).\n\n      The record demonstrates that Lt. Andrews did not read from a document\n\nnot in evidence, as appellant claims. Rather, he properly used the police report to\n\nrefresh his memory of the incident. After refreshing his memory, Lt. Andrews\n\nstated appellant’s name and date of birth from memory. Lt. Andrews established\n\nhow he would have had personal knowledge of appellant’s identity by referencing\n\nto the standard procedures that he habitually follows. (RR44: 146, 148, 150). The\n\nfact that Lt. Andrews did not prepare the report in its entirety is irrelevant; what\n\nmatters is that his memory was, in fact, refreshed. See Young, 891 S.W.2d at 951.\n\n\n\n                                        133\n\fThe trial court properly overruled appellant’s objections and allowed Lt. Andrews\n\nto testify from his refreshed memory.\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Issues 30 and 31 are without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n                           Officer Brandon Hernandez\n\n      In Issue 32, appellant complains about the testimony of Garland Police\n\nOfficer Brandon Hernandez. Officer Hernandez arrested appellant on July 4, 1999.\n\nOfficer Hernandez reviewed his report and refreshed his memory of the incident\n\nprior to testifying. (RR45: 61, 71). Officer Hernandez testified that he and his\n\npartner performed a felony stop of a vehicle that fled the scene of a burglary.\n\n(RR45: 60-65). There were three passengers in the vehicle, one of whom was\n\nappellant. (RR45: 67). The officers obtained the passengers’ identifying\n\ninformation and entered that information into the police computer to check for\n\noutstanding warrants. (RR45: 67). Although Officer Hernandez could not recall\n\noffhand whose information he obtained or which officer ran the information\n\nthrough the police system, he testified that they were able to confirm appellant’s\n\nidentity in their system and confirm that he had outstanding warrants. (RR45: 67-\n\n69). Appellant objected to this testimony on the basis that Officer Hernandez did\n\n                                        134\n\fnot have personal knowledge of the facts he was testifying to. (RR45: 69). The\n\nobjection was overruled. (RR45: 69).\n\n      The record reflects that Officer Hernandez was the author of the report and\n\ncollected the information found in the report documenting appellant’s arrest on\n\nJuly 4, 1999. He was there for the duration of the detention and arrest and\n\ncompiled information regarding all three suspects. The personal knowledge\n\nHernandez gained during the investigation was incorporated into his report,\n\nwhich Hernandez used to refresh his memory for testimony. See, e.g., McCoy, 877\n\nS.W.2d at 844. Officer Hernandez did not read from the report, but simply used\n\nthe report to refresh his memory of the incident. The trial court did not err in\n\nallowing him to testify from his refreshed memory. See Young, 891 S.W.2d at 951.\n\nIssue 32 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n             Issues 33 and 37: Testimony of Officer David Solomon\n\n      In Issues 33 and 37, appellant contends that the trial court erred in\n\noverruling his objection to the testimony of Officer David Solomon regarding an\n\narrest of appellant. He argues that allowing the officer to testify that appellant\n\nwas pulled over for suspicion of being involved in an attempted auto theft, when\n\n\n\n                                       135\n\fhe was later cleared of any involvement, was not relevant and highly prejudicial.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 108-10, 116-18).\n\n      Dallas Police Officer David Solomon arrested appellant on October 4, 1993.\n\n(RR45: 83, 87). Early that morning, the police pulled over a vehicle matching the\n\ndescription of a vehicle involved in an attempted auto theft. (RR45: 84-86, 126-\n\n27). There were multiple passengers in the vehicle, including appellant; the\n\nofficers obtained personal information from all the passengers. (RR45: 88, 127-\n\n28). The officers determined that appellant and the other passengers were not\n\ninvolved in the attempted auto theft. (RR45: 99, 103, 129-30). Appellant,\n\nhowever, was arrested for two outstanding warrants for burglary of a habitation.\n\n(RR45: 88-89, 128-30). One of those warrants was for the burglary of Ivis Wright,\n\nthe woman who sold candy in the neighborhood. (RR45: 97-98, 100).\n\n      Appellant objected to Officer Solomon being allowed to testify that\n\nappellant was pulled over because the vehicle was suspected of being involved in\n\nan attempted auto theft when the passengers were later cleared of any\n\ninvolvement in that offense. Appellant argued that the reason for the stop was\n\nirrelevant and prejudicial. (RR45: 100, 104-05, 124). The trial court ruled that\n\nOfficer Solomon could testify about how appellant came to be pulled over by\n\n                                           136\n\fpolice, so long as the State made clear that he was cleared of any involvement in\n\nthe attempted auto theft. (RR45: 100-01). The State complied with the Court’s\n\nruling. (RR45: 129). Counsel also elicited this information on cross-examination.\n\n(RR45: 130).\n\n      Relevant evidence means evidence having any tendency to make the\n\nexistence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\n\nmore probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Tex. R.\n\nEvid. 401. Rule 403 favors the admission of relevant evidence and carries a\n\npresumption that relevant evidence will be more probative than prejudicial.\n\nWilliams, 958 S.W.2d at 196.\n\n      Officer Solomon’s testimony was not introduced for the purpose of proving\n\nany crime related to the attempted auto theft, but rather to show appellant’s\n\narrest for the burglary of Ms. Wright’s home. Although Ms. Wright had previously\n\ntestified about the circumstances of the burglary, she testified that she did not\n\nknow who had committed the offense. (RR44: 119-27). And while appellant was\n\nidentified as one of the suspected perpetrators by Officer Havens, there was no\n\nfurther evidence before the jury regarding any further disposition of the case.\n\nOfficer Solomon’s testimony demonstrated that appellant was charged and\n\n                                      137\n\farrested for that offense. Officer Solomon’s explanation for the stop was relevant\n\nto show how and why he came into contact with appellant on October 4, 1993,\n\nsince he had no involvement in the investigation of the burglary offense. Without\n\nthis explanation, his testimony regarding appellant’s arrest would be incomplete\n\nand confusing.\n\n      Furthermore, appellant cannot show harm. Officer Solomon made clear\n\nduring his testimony before the jury that appellant was cleared of any\n\ninvolvement in the attempted auto theft. (RR45: 129, 130).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\n\noverruling appellant’s objection to the testimony of Officer Solomon. Issue 33 is\n\nwithout merit and should be overruled.\n\n                 Issue 34: Testimony of Warden Melodye Nelson\n\n      In Issue 34, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to Warden Nelson’s anecdotal testimony about weapons produced in\n\nprison by other inmates. He claims that this evidence was not relevant and was\n\nprejudicial to him because he had no connection to the weapons presented.\n\n(Appellant’s Brief, pp. 110-11).\n\n\n\n                                       138\n\f      Rule 702 of the Texas Rules of Evidence provides:\n\n      If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the\n      trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\n      issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill,\n      experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of\n      an opinion or otherwise.\n\nTex. R. Evid. 702. The proponent of evidence under Rule 702 must show, by clear\n\nand convincing proof, that the evidence is sufficiently relevant and reliable to\n\nassist the jury in accurately understanding other evidence or in determining a fact\n\nin issue. See Gallo, 239 S.W.3d at 765. A trial court’s decision to admit or exclude\n\nexpert testimony is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. Id.\n\n      Warden Nelson was qualified as an expert by virtue of her knowledge and\n\nexperience in the Texas prison system. Her testimony was relevant to helping the\n\njury determine Special Issue No. 1, whether appellant would commit criminal acts\n\nof violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. It is well settled\n\nthat “society” includes the prison population. See Estrada v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1890229\"><a href=\"/opinion/1890229/estrada-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010). Warden Nelson’s testimony described for the\n\njury what appellant’s life would be like if he were sentenced to life in prison and\n\nhis society became prison society. Prison society is not something within a juror’s\n\ncommon knowledge. Warden Nelson testified regarding staffing, classification,\n\n                                        139\n\fhousing, daily routine, discipline and the potential for violence within Texas\n\nprisons. She did not specifically testify that appellant would be more or less likely\n\nto commit violent acts in prison, only that there is a potential for violence in all\n\nclassification levels of the prison system. Warden Nelson showed weapons that\n\nwere found and confiscated in prison over the years in an effort to illustrate her\n\ntestimony for the jury. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this\n\nevidence. See Threadgill v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2175651\"><a href=\"/opinion/2175651/threadgill-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">654</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 670-671 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004)\n\n(finding no abuse of discretion in trial court’s admission of photographs of\n\nweapons made in prison which were used by a prison expert to illustrate his\n\ntestimony regarding inmate violence within various classifications of prison\n\nsociety).\n\n      Even if the trial court erred in admitting Nelson’s testimony, any alleged\n\nerror was harmless. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). Warden Nelson’s testimony was\n\noffered by the State in rebuttal during the punishment phase. The jury had\n\nalready seen and heard evidence regarding the instant capital murder. The jury\n\nhad already heard about appellant’s lengthy history of criminal activity, his\n\nnumerous violations while on probation, his failure to obey orders while\n\nincarcerated, his anger issues, and his violence toward women, including his own\n\n                                         140\n\fsister. Furthermore, the prejudicial effect of Warden Nelson’s testimony was\n\nminimized by its general nature. It was neither graphic nor disturbing in content.\n\nThat fact, in conjunction with the admission of other more compelling\n\npunishment evidence by the State, rendered harmless any error in the admission\n\nof Warden Nelson’s testimony. Issue 34 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n        Issue 35: Denial of Hearing on Extraneous Offenses and Bad Acts\n\n      In Issue 35, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nrequest to hold a hearing outside the presence of the jury on the admissibility of\n\nany extraneous offense evidence the State planned to offer during the\n\npunishment phase of trial. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 112-14).\n\n                                  Pertinent Facts\n\n      Appellant filed a pretrial motion requesting that the trial court hold a\n\nhearing and make a threshold determination as to the admissibility of every\n\nextraneous offense or bad act the State planned to present during the\n\npunishment phase. (CR2: 273-78). Appellant’s motion also requested that (1) the\n\ntrial court give an oral instruction at the conclusion of the admission of each\n\nextraneous offense that it is not be considered unless proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt, and (2) a reasonable doubt instruction with respect to all\n\n                                        141\n\fextraneous offenses admitted at punishment be included in the jury charge at\n\npunishment. (CR2: 273-78).\n\n      These motions were discussed at a pretrial hearing, but no ruling was\n\nmade. Defense counsel argued that the “heart” of his motion was a concern that\n\nthe State would attempt to prove extraneous offenses through the use of\n\nbusiness records. (RR42: 46-48). The State responded that it intended to present\n\nall extraneous offense evidence through live witnesses who could testify about\n\nwhat happened and that it was appellant who did it. (RR42: 46-47, 50).\n\n      Appellant re-urged this motion during the punishment phase. (RR44: 42-53,\n\n133-39). The State responded that it had turned over an exhaustive 404(b) notice\n\nto appellant and that it would only be presenting extraneous offenses that it had\n\na good faith belief could be proven in accordance with the law. (RR44: 42-43).\n\nAppellant’s requests for a hearing on each extraneous offense and an oral\n\ninstruction following the admission of each extraneous offense were denied, but\n\nhis request for a written instruction in the jury charge was granted. (RR44: 48-55).\n\nThe trial court later granted appellant’s request for an oral instruction, which was\n\ngiven to the jury during the presentation of the State’s extraneous offense\n\nevidence. (RR45: 41-42).\n\n                                        142\n\f                                  Applicable Law\n\n      Pursuant to Article 37.071 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, a trial court\n\nhas wide discretion in admitting evidence, including extraneous offenses, relevant\n\nto the jury’s determination of a capital murder defendant’s death-worthiness. See\n\nTex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 37.071, § 2(a)(1) (West Supp. 2014); Powell v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">898</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 830 (Tex.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1777705\"><a href=\"/opinion/1777705/mitchell-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. Crim.\n\nApp. 1996), in support of his argument that he was entitled to a hearing to\n\ndetermine the admissibility of extraneous offense evidence. In Mitchell, this Court\n\nheld that the trial court has the responsibility of determining the threshold\n\nadmissibility of extraneous offense evidence at the punishment phase of a non-\n\ncapital trial; that is, the court must make an initial determination at the proffer of\n\nthe evidence that the evidence is relevant and that a jury could reasonably find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the extraneous\n\noffense. See Mitchell, 931 S.W.2d at 954. The Court also held that, if requested,\n\nthe defendant is entitled to a limiting instruction that informs the jury that\n\nextraneous offenses offered during the punishment phase must not be\n\nconsidered unless they are proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at 954.\n\n      Mitchell was a non-capital case and was based on the language in Article\n\n37.07. Capital cases, however, are governed by Article 37.071. This article clearly\n\nimbues the trial judge with wide discretion to admit any evidence relevant to the\n\njury’s determination of a capital defendant’s deathworthiness, including evidence\n\nof adjudicated and unadjudicated extraneous offenses, so long as the State can\n\n                                         144\n\fsufficiently connect the appellant to the alleged extraneous offense. See Kemp,\n\n846 S.W.2d at 307. There is no requirement that they be proven beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt or that the trial court give any additional instructions on the\n\nburden of proof beyond what is already included in the instructions on the special\n\nissues.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425752\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425752/jackson-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">469</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 477 (Tex.

Even if appellant was entitled to a threshold determination of\n\nadmissibility under the rules of evidence, he was not necessarily entitled to\n\nhearing on each separate extraneous offense.

Outside the presence of the\n\njury, the State made an oral proffer to the trial court that it planned to prove\n\nextraneous offenses through live witnesses who could testify about what\n\nhappened and show that appellant was the perpetrator. (RR42: 46, 50; RR44: 44).\n\nThe State also assured the trial court that it had no intention of offering evidence\n\nof an extraneous offense that it did not have a good faith belief it could prove in\n\naccordance with the law. (RR44: 42). While the trial court made no express ruling\n\non the admissibility of the extraneous offenses prior to trial, its denial of\n\nappellant’s request for a hearing following the State’s proffer constitutes an\n\nimplied ruling of admissibility. See Mann, 13 S.W.3d at 94.\n\n      Further, any error in the trial court’s failure to hold a hearing was harmless.\n\nWith regard to each extraneous offense presented at punishment, which are\n\noutlined in detail in the State’s Summary of Facts (Infra pp. 11-26), the State\n\n\n\n                                        146\n\fprovided clear proof that an offense occurred and that appellant was the\n\nperpetrator. See Young, 283 S.W.3d at 876.\n\n      In addition, the trial court gave both an oral and written instruction to the\n\njury that they were not to consider extraneous offenses for any purpose unless\n\nthey found and believed beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant committed\n\nthe offenses, if any were committed, and even then they could only consider\n\nthem in determining their answers to the special issues. (RR45: 41-42; CR2: 406).\n\nThe jury is presumed to have followed this instruction and disregarded any\n\noffenses they did not believe were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. See\n\nGamboa v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1989695\"><a href=\"/opinion/1989695/gamboa-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 580 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (noting jury\n\npresumed to follow the judge’s instructions). This extra safeguard, which was not\n\nrequired but operated to appellant’s benefit, rendered any error in the trial\n\ncourt’s failure to hold a hearing harmless.\n\n      Appellant wholly fails to show how he was harmed by the trial court’s\n\nruling. All of the extraneous offenses presented were relevant to the jury’s\n\ndetermination of appellant’s deathworthiness. See Powell, 898 S.W.2d at 830;\n\nKemp, 846 S.W.2d at 307. Appellant does not argue that he did not commit the\n\nextraneous offenses presented. He also makes no attempt to explain for the Court\n\n                                        147\n\fwhich, if any, extraneous offenses would have been excluded by the court if the\n\nrequested hearing had been held. Appellant argues that if the trial court had\n\nacknowledged his request for a threshold hearing, Issues 42, 43 and 44 raised in\n\nhis brief would have been prevented. (Appellant’s Brief, p. 113). However, these\n\nissues do not pertain to the admission of extraneous offense evidence. In Issue\n\n42, appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury’s\n\nanswer to the future-dangerousness special issue; and Issues 43 and 44 are\n\nconstitutional challenges to Texas’ death penalty statute. Based on the foregoing,\n\nIssue 35 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n                      Issue 36: Denial of Motion for Mistrial\n\n      In Issue 36, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nmotion for a mistrial. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 114-16).\n\n                                   Pertinent Facts\n\n      Dallas Police Officer Ryan Swain testified that he responded to a suspicious\n\nperson call on July 18, 2010. (RR45: 73-74). Before he could elaborate further,\n\nappellant requested a bench conference, where he notified the State and the trial\n\ncourt that he did not have notice of the incident Officer Swain was about to offer\n\ntestimony on. (RR45: 75). The trial court removed the jury and appellant objected\n\n                                         148\n\fto Officer Swain’s testimony on the basis that he was not provided notice by the\n\nState. (RR45: 75-76). The prosecutors, realizing that the offense had been\n\nmistakenly omitted from the State’s Notice of Extraneous Offenses, notified the\n\nCourt that it would not present any further testimony from Officer Swain. (RR45:\n\n76).\n\n       Counsel stated that the absence of any further testimony would invite the\n\njury to speculate and he requested that an instruction to disregard the testimony\n\nbe given. (RR45: 78). The trial court granted appellant’s request. (RR45: 78-79).\n\nAppellant expressed his concerns that a curative instruction was inadequate and\n\nalso moved for a mistrial. (RR45: 79). That request was denied. (RR45: 79-80).\n\nWhen the jury was returned to the courtroom, the trial court orally instructed\n\nthem to “disregard any testimony that was offered by Officer Swain, the last\n\nwitness that the State presented to you.” (RR45: 81). Appellant moved for a\n\nmistrial in the presence of the jury and his request was denied. (RR45: 81). In the\n\npunishment charge, the jurors were further instructed: “During your deliberations\n\nupon the special issues, you must not consider, discuss, nor relate any matters\n\nnot in evidence before you.” (CR2: 405).\n\n\n\n                                       149\n\f                                   Applicable Law\n\n      A mistrial is the trial court’s remedy for improper conduct that is so\n\nprejudicial that expenditure of further time and expense would be wasteful and\n\nfutile. Hawkins v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1592076\"><a href=\"/opinion/1592076/hawkins-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 77 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). Only in extreme\n\ncircumstances, where the prejudice is incurable, will a mistrial be required. Id.\n\nWhen the trial court sustains an objection and grants an instruction to disregard,\n\nbut denies a motion for mistrial, the proper issue is whether the trial court abused\n\nits discretion by denying the motion for mistrial. Id.\n\n      In determining whether the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\nmistrial, an appellate court considers the following factors: (1) severity of the\n\nmisconduct (the magnitude of the prejudicial effect); (2) measures adopted to\n\ncure the misconduct (the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the judge); and\n\n(3) the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct (the strength of the\n\nevidence supporting the conviction).

He was cut off before he could offer any substantive, much less\n                                     150\n\fprejudicial, testimony about his encounter with appellant. The State did not\n\npresent any further testimony from him after realizing the error in their notice.\n\nClearly, his testimony was not offered to inflame the jurors, nor was it of such a\n\ncharacter as to suggest the impossibility of withdrawing the impression left on the\n\njury. The trial court’s prompt instruction to disregard was sufficient to cure any\n\nharm resulting from the impression left on the jury. This Court presumes the jury\n\nfollowed the trial court’s instruction. See Gamboa, 296 S.W.3d at 580 (noting that\n\na reviewing court generally considers instructions given to the jury sufficient to\n\nremedy most improprieties that occur during trial and presumes the jury will\n\nfollow the trial court’s instructions).\n\n      Given the strength of the evidence supporting the jury’s answers to the\n\nspecial issues, the trial court’s prompt instruction to disregard, and the\n\ninconsequential nature of the complained-of testimony, the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in denying appellant’s motion for mistrial. As such, Issue 36 is\n\nwithout merit and should be overruled.\n\n            Issues 38 and 39: Cross-Examination of Appellant’s Experts\n\n      In Issues 38 and 39, appellant contends that the trial court erred by\n\noverruling his objections and permitting the State to cross-examine his experts,\n\n                                          151\n\fDr. Kellie Gray-Smith and Dr. Gilbert Martinez, on antisocial personality disorder.\n\nHe claims that the State’s cross-examination was an attempt to convert his\n\nexperts into State’s witnesses and elicit opinions on matters that were outside\n\ntheir field of expertise. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 118-21). Appellant’s contentions are\n\nwithout merit and should be overruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      Texas Rule of Evidence 611(b) provides “a witness may be cross-examined\n\non any matter relevant to any issue in the case, including credibility.” Tex.

The cross-examination of which appellant\n\ncomplains went as follows:\n\n      Q (MS.

Yeah.\n\n      Q: So you know that they, typically, have a reckless disregard for the\n      safety of others?\n\n      A: Yes. That can be part of the profile.\n\n      Q: And that they fail to conform to the norms?\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Excuse me, Judge. I’m going to object. This is outside\n      of the area that we brought in any testimony in regards -- and she is\n      talking about -- if she is talking symptomology of ASPD, in general,\n      that’s one thing, but now she is going to try to associate these\n      symptom-ologies to a particular individual who this witness has not\n      interviewed or examined, so I'm going to object to her stating a litany\n      of the ASPD criteria and stating that they are all attributed to a\n      particular person when she has not examined the person. You cannot\n      attribute it to that person.\n\n      MR. HEALY: Judge, she has not examined the person, but she gave\n      the opinion that he has antisocial personality disorder.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: She has not given a diagnosis of that, Judge. There's a\n      big difference. She is not allowed to sit there and say to somebody\n      that she --\n                                       153\n\f      THE COURT: I understand and I heard her testimony.

Additionally, Dr. Gray-Smith had already\n\ntestified, without objection, that she was of the opinion that appellant had\n\nantisocial personality disorder:\n\n      Q (MS. KEMP): And so as you conclude throughout your report here\n      that Mr. Muhammad has antisocial personality disorder, you\n      connected those dots on your own; is that correct?\n\n      A (DR. GRAY-SMITH): Yes.\n\n                                        154\n\f      Q: You are a licensed psychologist; is that correct?\n\n      A: Yes.\n\n      Q: And you are familiar with all behavioral disorders; is that correct?\n\n      A: That’s correct.\n\n      Q: So given a limited amount of information, you can make a\n      diagnosis of antisocial personality disorder, could you not?\n\n      A: I would form an opinion. I don’t know if I would say it is a\n      diagnosis, but I would form an opinion.\n\n      Q: Yeah, I think that’s more accurate. So any licensed psychologist\n      with the appropriate training and behavioral and studies, which all\n      licensed psychologists have, could form an opinion, even with the\n      limited amount of records that you have; is that correct?\n\n      A: It’s possible.\n\n(RR49: 58-59). Appellant also failed to object to the following exchange:\n\n      Q (MS. KEMP): You have an opinion that Mr. Muhammad is a\n      sociopath, don't you?\n\n      A (DR. GRAY-SMITH): I have an opinion that his pattern of academic\n      records and psychological records suggest that he has an antisocial\n      personality disorder.\n\n      Q: Same as a sociopath?\n\n      A: Yes, in a generic sense.\n\n      Q: Okay. Thank you.\n\n                                        155\n\f(RR49: 72). Accordingly, appellant has failed to preserve his complaint for review.\n\nSee Tex. R. App. P. 33.1(a).\n\n          The Trial Court Did Not Abuse Its Discretion by Permitting the\n                   State’s Cross-Examination of Dr. Gray-Smith\n\n      Nevertheless, should this Court consider this issue, the record reflects that\n\nthe trial court properly overruled appellant’s objection. A witness may be cross-\n\nexamined on any issue relevant to the case. Tex. R. Evid. 611(b). Clearly, whether\n\nappellant possesses the diagnostic criteria for antisocial personality disorder is\n\nrelevant to future danger and admissible in a capital murder trial. See Powell, 898\n\nS.W.2d at 830 (trial court has wide discretion in admitting evidence any evidence\n\nrelevant to the jury’s determination of a capital murder defendant’s death-\n\nworthiness). Additionally, here, this was certainly a relevant area of cross-\n\nexamination since it was raised by Dr. Gray-Smith’s testimony on direct\n\nexamination.\n\n      On direct examination, Dr. Gray-Smith testified that she had reviewed a\n\n1994 psychological evaluation of the appellant, in which appellant was diagnosed\n\nwith conduct disorder. (RR49: 41, 55-57). Defense counsel then elicited the\n\nfollowing testimony:\n\n\n                                       156\n\f      Q (MR. JOHNSON): Doctor, do you -- when you have an individual\n      that goes forward from the Oppositional Defiant Disorder and into\n      the Conduct Disorder, if the behaviors never, actually, got ahold of or\n      actually intervened and treated, is there a predictability as to where\n      that person is going to end up?\n\n      A (DR. GRAY-SMITH): Yes. They usually end up being diagnosed with\n      antisocial personality disorder, which is the adult form of conduct\n      disorder.\n\n      ....\n\n      Q: And as an expert here testifying today, would it surprise you, not\n      that there has been a finding of this, but would it surprise you that\n      the person whose records that you examined there would have gone\n      from the point of ODD to conduct disorder to the symptom-ologies\n      of antisocial personality behavior disorder?\n\n      A: Not at all. It would have been predictable.\n\n(RR49: 43, 45-46). Because the issue of antisocial personality disorder was\n\nrelevant and was raised on direct examination by appellant, the State was\n\npermitted to cross-examine Dr. Gray-Smith concerning her knowledge about the\n\ndisorder and whether she believed that the appellant exhibited the criteria\n\nnecessary for such a diagnosis. Accordingly, the trial court properly overruled\n\nappellant’s objection.\n\n\n\n\n                                       157\n\f                          Issue 39: Dr. Gilbert Martinez\n\n      In Issue 39, appellant contends that the trial court erred in overruling his\n\nobjection to the State’s cross-examination of Dr. Gilbert Martinez, a clinical\n\nneuropsychologist retained by the defense to provide expert testimony on\n\nappellant’s cognitive and intellectual functioning. The cross-examination of which\n\nappellant complains went as follows:\n\n      Q (MS. KEMP): So, doctor, would someone with antisocial personality\n      disorder have an impulsiveness problem?\n\n      A (DR. MARTINEZ): Impulsivity is one of the diagnostic criteria for\n      antisocial personality disorder, yes.\n\n      Q: Would someone with antisocial personality disorder have a failure\n      to conform to society’s norms and general rules and regulations of\n      society?\n\n      A: That’s another one of the diagnostic criteria for antisocial\n      personality disorder.\n\n      Q: Would they have a history of lying, or conning other people for\n      their own personal gain or pleasure?\n\n      A: That’s another one of the descriptors for antisocial personality\n      disorder. That’s correct.\n\n      Q: Would they have difficulty in planning ahead?\n\n      A: Yes. That can be one of the symptoms, one of the features of\n      antisocial personality disorder.\n\n                                       158\n\f      Q: Would they be seen as irritable and aggressive by having repeated\n      fights in school?\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Excuse me, Judge. All of these questions here are\n      clearly outside of the referral question. He has testified in regards to\n      what he was asked to do by me in regards to this case. He has not\n      been asked to do any kind of psychological assessment in regards to\n      any ASPD factors. She is, basically, just running down the DSM 4 and\n      asking if these are the criteria for antisocial personality disorder. He\n      was not asked, in any way, to do any type of evaluation in this case in\n      those regards. He is testifying only towards his cognitive deficits, and\n      that’s all that he is on for. We’ve got other individuals to speak to\n      those matters where that would be relevant, but not this doctor.\n\n      MR. HEALY: Judge, he made an Axis II diagnosis and that included\n      antisocial personality disorder.\n\n      THE COURT: Overruled. Please proceed.\n\n      MS. KEMP: Thank you. That person will show a reckless disregard for\n      the safety of others, wouldn't he?\n\n      DR. MARTINEZ: That’s another feature of the antisocial personality\n      disorder, yes.\n\n(RR48: 153-54).\n\n             Appellant Failed to Preserve His Complaint for Review\n\n      To the extent that appellant is complaining about the line of questioning\n\nconcerning the symptoms or diagnostic criteria associated with antisocial\n\npersonality disorder, appellant failed to raise a timely objection. See Tex. R. App.\n\nP. 33.1(a). The prosecutor had already posed several questions regarding this\n                                     159\n\fsubject prior to appellant’s objection.

Crim. App.\n\n1992). Appellant also failed to object to additional questions concerning the same\n\nsubject matter. (RR48: 155-56). Accordingly, appellant has failed to preserve this\n\ncomplaint for review.\n\n      To the extent that trial counsel was objecting to the prosecutor’s questions\n\nconcerning whether Dr. Martinez was of the opinion that appellant had antisocial\n\npersonality disorder, his objection was premature because the prosecutor had not\n\nelicited such testimony. Furthermore, when the State did pose such questions to\n\nDr. Martinez, appellant failed to object. (RR48: 157-60). Consequently, this\n\ncomplaint has also not been preserved for review.\n\n          The Trial Court Did Not Abuse its Discretion by Permitting the\n                    State’s Cross-Examination of Dr. Martinez\n\n      Alternatively, appellant’s claim fails on the merits. Dr. Martinez, a licensed\n\nneuropsychologist, testified that he was familiar with the diagnostic criteria for\n\nantisocial personality disorder. (RR48: 156). That diagnostic criteria is found in the\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (“DSM”), which Dr.\n\nMartinez testified is used by most clinicians and was, in fact, used by Dr. Martinez\n                                         160\n\fin his evaluation of the appellant. (RR48: 155-56; Defendant’s Exhibit 11).\n\nTherefore, questions concerning the criteria or symptoms exhibited by someone\n\nwith antisocial personality disorder were not outside his area of expertise.\n\nAdditionally, because Dr. Martinez had reviewed appellant’s medical records and\n\na 1994 psychological evaluation, conducted a face-to-face interview with\n\nappellant, and administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to the\n\nappellant, it was reasonable to question him concerning whether he had an\n\nopinion as to whether appellant met the criteria for a diagnosis of antisocial\n\npersonality disorder. (RR48: 102-07, 111-12). Accordingly, the State’s cross-\n\nexamination of Dr. Martinez was appropriate, and the trial court properly\n\noverruled appellant’s objection.\n\n                           Error, If Any, Was Harmless\n\n      Finally, even if the trial court erred in overruling the appellant’s objections,\n\nthe error was harmless. Error in the admission of evidence is non-constitutional\n\nerror and must be disregarded unless the error affects a defendant’s substantial\n\nrights. See Tex. R. Evid. 103; Tex. R.

Additionally, while Dr. Martinez was questioned by the prosecutor\n\nconcerning whether appellant met the criteria for antisocial personality disorder,\n\nDr. Martinez testified that he had not been asked to evaluate the appellant for\n\nantisocial personality disorder and had not performed the necessary assessments\n\nto make that determination. Accordingly, his testimony had no negative impact\n\non the appellant. Therefore, any error in the trial court’s rulings did not affect\n\nappellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n      Based on the foregoing, Issues 38 and 39 should be overruled.\n\n            Issue 40: Trial Court’s Statement Regarding Sequestration\n\n      In Issue 40, appellant contends that the trial court improperly commented\n\non the weight of the evidence in his statement to the jury concerning being\n\n                                         162\n\fsequestered after they had begun deliberating. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 121-24).\n\nThe record reflects that the trial court’s statement was not an improper comment\n\non the evidence, nor did it prejudice the rights of appellant.\n\n                                      Pertinent Facts\n\n      After both sides rested and closed at punishment, the trial court gave the\n\nfollowing instructions to the jury:\n\n      THE COURT: All right. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, that closes\n      the evidence in the case. Now, it is almost 3:00, so what I'm going to\n      do, it is too late to start your deliberations because once I charge\n      you, we have closing arguments, then I can't let you separate, so\n      what I'm going to do this evening is send you-all home and bring you\n      back at 9:00 o'clock in the morning, at which time I will read the\n      charge to you. We will have closing arguments of counsel, and then I\n      will send you out to deliberate punishment. All right. So remember\n      the instructions that I have given you earlier, not to discuss any of\n      the evidence in this case with anyone, not even among yourselves.\n      Do not watch any of the TV or read the newspaper accounts or any of\n      those things. Have a good evening, and we will see you back here at\n      9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n\n      MR. JOHNSON: Judge, they're going to need --the future instructions.\n\n      THE COURT: Okay. I was going to tell you about bringing –\n\n      THE BAILIFF: I will tell them back here.\n\n      THE COURT: Mike has some instructions. I've asked Mike to have you,\n      in the morning, bring with you a change of clothes just in case. I don't\n      think you are going to need it, but just in case you do not finish your\n      deliberations tomorrow, then I will have to sequester you as long as\n                                       163\n\f      you are in deliberations, or before you return to court with a verdict\n      on punishment, then I will have to keep y'all together. And so -- just\n      bring a change of clothes with you. Anything else, Mike, that I need\n      to tell them about?\n\n      THE BAILIFF: No.\n\n      THE COURT: You think that covers it?\n\n      THE BAILIFF: Yes, sir.\n\n      THE COURT: All right. Very good. Thank y'all. We will see you\n      tomorrow morning at 9:00 o'clock tomorrow morning.\n\n(RR49: 151-53). After the jury was removed, appellant moved for a mistrial.\n\n(RR49: 157). He argued that the trial court’s statement “I don’t think you are\n\ngoing to need it” in regards to the change of clothes he instructed them to bring\n\nwas an improper comment on the weight of the evidence and an indication from\n\nthe bench that the court is of the opinion there is nothing in the case worthy of\n\ndeliberation. (RR49: 157-58). When asked to explain what he meant by the\n\ncomment, the trial judge stated: “I was only explaining to them why I’m going to\n\nstart them in the morning and give them all day long, but if they don’t reach a\n\nverdict, then they need to be prepared to - … - so I could sequester them. And if I\n\ndidn’t think that that was necessary, I wouldn’t have told them to bring any\n\nclothes.” (RR49: 158-59).\n\n                                       164\n\f      The following morning, the jury heard the argument of counsel and was\n\ngiven instructions for their deliberation of the special issues. (CR2: 402-07). They\n\nwere instructed that it would not be proper for them to arrive at their answers to\n\nthe special issues by any other method other than by a full, fair, and free\n\nexchange of the opinion of each individual juror. (CR2: 405). They were further\n\ninstructed that they may, and should, deliberate for as long as they felt was\n\nnecessary to arrive at their answers to the special issues. (CR2: 405).\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      There are no set time limits on jury deliberations, and the length of time\n\nthe jury may be held to deliberate is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\n\nSee Guidry v.

In evaluating whether the court's\n\ncomment on the evidence was reasonably calculated to benefit the State or\n\nprejudice the defendant, the reviewing court first examines whether the\n\ncomment was material, i.e., if the jury was considering the same issue. Clark, 878\n\nS.W.2d at 226. The reviewing court must then consider the consequences that\n\nprobably resulted from the trial court’s comment to determine whether the\n\ncomment prejudiced appellant’s rights. Id.; Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b).\n\n       The Trial Court’s Statement Was Not an Improper Comment on the\n                              Weight of the Evidence\n\n      During the complained-of statement, the trial court admonished the jury\n\nthat they could be sequestered. See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 35.23. The\n                                     166\n\fcourt instructed them to bring a change of clothes in the event that they were not\n\nfinished deliberating at the end of the day. As reflected by the trial court’s\n\nexplanation following the removal of the jury, the intent of the statement was\n\nsimply to inform the jurors of the possibility of sequestration. The court further\n\nexplained that if it did not believe the jury had anything worthy of deliberation he\n\nwould not have instructed them to bring a change of clothes.\n\n      The record reflects that the trial court’s statement “I don’t think you will\n\nneed them” with regard to the extra clothes was an offhand comment with no\n\ncalculated intent. It is possible the trial court was trying to put the jurors at ease\n\nabout the potential sequestration. It is also possible that the trial court reasonably\n\nbelieved that the jury would reach a verdict after a full day of deliberation based\n\non his experience as a judge who has presided over multiple capital murder cases.\n\nRegardless, the trial court’s comment did not imply approval of the State’s\n\nposition or indicate any disbelief in the appellant’s position. As such, this\n\nstatement was not an improper comment on the weight of the evidence. See\n\nHoang, 997 S.W.2d at 682.\n\n      Even if this comment could be construed, as appellant claims, to convey the\n\ntrial court’s perception of the state of the evidence and belief that the jury would\n\n                                         167\n\fnot need to give much time in deliberation of the special issues, this comment did\n\nnot necessarily benefit the State. The comment contains no expression of the trial\n\ncourt’s view of how the jury should resolve the special issues. There was\n\ncompelling punishment evidence presented by both sides during appellant’s trial.\n\nThe trial court’s comment could have just as easily been perceived to mean that\n\nthe court did not think it would not take the jurors longer than a day to resolve\n\nthe special issues in such a way that resulted in a life sentence for appellant.\n\n      To the extent that the trial court’s comment could be perceived as rushing\n\nthe jurors in their deliberation with a threat of sequestration, this claim is equally\n\nwithout merit. The jurors were sent home for the evening following the trial\n\ncourt’s statement. The following morning, they were given detailed instructions\n\nregarding their deliberation of the special issues. The jurors were instructed that\n\nthey may, and should, deliberate for as long as necessary to arrive at their\n\nanswers to the special issues. (CR2: 405). Judicial instructions to the jury are\n\npresumed to be effective unless evidence shows the jury did not follow the\n\ndirective. See Gamboa, 296 S.W.3d at 580 (a jury is presumed to follow the trial\n\ncourt’s instructions). There is no indication in the record that the jurors were not\n\nallowed to deliberate as long as they felt was necessary.\n\n                                         168\n\f       The Trial Court’s Comment Was Not Calculated to Benefit the State\n                             or Prejudice Appellant\n\n      Even if this Court were to find that this was an improper comment on the\n\nweight of the evidence, it does not constitute reversible error. There is simply no\n\nindication that the comment was reasonably calculated to benefit the State or\n\nprejudice the rights of the defendant. See Becknell, 720 S.W.2d at 531; Simon, 203\n\nS.W.3d at 592. First, it was not material. The issue before the jury was resolution\n\nof the special issues, the outcome of which would determine whether appellant\n\nwas going to receive a sentence of life or death. The trial court’s comment, which\n\nreferred to its belief on the time deliberations might take and whether the jury\n\nwould be sequestered, pertained more to the logistics of deliberations and was\n\nimmaterial to their resolution of the special issues.\n\n      Moreover, a review of the record indicates that the comment did not affect\n\nappellant’s substantial rights. See Tex. R. App. P. 44.2(b). The trial court’s\n\ncomment did not inject harmful new facts and was not calculated to deprive\n\nappellant of a fair and impartial trial. The jury instructions included in the\n\npunishment charge – instructing the jurors to deliberate for as long as necessary\n\nand to arrive at their answers to special issues only after a full, fair, and free\n\nexchange of the opinion of each juror – helped to cure any error. Further, in light\n                                      169\n\fof the heinousness of appellant’s offense of drowning his two young sons and the\n\nvoluminous and compelling punishment evidence presented by the State, it is\n\nunlikely that the trial court’s offhanded comment had any influence on the jury’s\n\nverdict. Issue 40 is without merit and should be overruled.\n\n        Issue 42: Legal Sufficiency of Future Dangerousness Special Issue\n\n      In Issue 42, appellant contends that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s answer to Special Issue No. 1, the future dangerousness special\n\nissue. Specifically, he contends that he had no prior violent offense convictions\n\nthat sent him to the penitentiary. He also contends that the offense was the\n\nresult of family conflict about his children that would not exist in prison, thereby\n\nremoving the probability that he would constitute a future danger. (Appellant’s\n\nBrief, pp. 126-27). Appellant’s contentions are without merit and should be\n\noverruled.\n\n                                  Applicable Law\n\n      The State has the burden of proving the punishment issue of future\n\ndangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art.\n\n37.071, §§ 2(b)(1), 2(c). In assessing the legal sufficiency of the evidence of future\n\ndangerousness, this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the\n\n                                         170\n\fverdict to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that there is a probability that appellant would commit criminal\n\nacts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society. See Estrada,\n\n313 S.W.3d at 284.\n\n      In its determination of the special issues, the jury is entitled to consider all\n\nthe evidence presented at the guilt phase of the trial, in addition to the evidence\n\npresented at the punishment phase. Young, 283 S.W.3d at 863. Some factors the\n\njury may consider when determining whether appellant will pose a continuing\n\nthreat to society include: (1) the circumstances of the offense, including the\n\ndefendant’s state of mind and whether he was working alone or with other\n\nparties; (2) the calculated nature of his acts; (3) the forethought and\n\ndeliberateness exhibited by the crime’s execution; (4) the existence of a prior\n\ncriminal record and the severity of the prior crimes; (5) the defendant’s age and\n\npersonal circumstances at the time of the offense; (6) whether the defendant was\n\nacting under duress or the domination of another at the time of the offense; (7)\n\npsychiatric evidence; and (8) character evidence.

Young, 283 S.W.3d at 863.\n\n        The Evidence is Legally Sufficient to Support the Jury’s Finding of\n                             Future Dangerousness\n\n      The State presented sufficient evidence to support the jury’s finding of\n\nfuture dangerousness. First, the gruesome facts of the offense alone were\n\nsufficient to support a finding of future dangerousness. The evidence presented at\n\ntrial showed that appellant murdered his two young sons because he was angry\n\nwith their mother Kametra. On the Saturday prior to the offense, appellant saw\n\nKametra with another man at a back-to-school barbeque and became angry that\n\nshe was seeing another man and that the man was in his sons’ lives. The evidence\n\nreflects that appellant asked to borrow his friend Christal’s car so that he could\n\ndrive Naim to school on his first day, despite not having obtained permission to\n\ntake him. On the day of the offense, after being told he could not drive Naim to\n\nschool, appellant saw Kametra, Naim and Elijah walking toward Naim’s school.\n\nAppellant stopped the car and forced Kametra and the boys to get into the car.\n\nAppellant then drove them aimlessly around the neighborhood, all the while\n\nthreatening to harm Kametra. When appellant stopped the car for a red light,\n\nKametra saw a constable one lane over. Despite appellant’s warnings not to get\n                                    172\n\fout of the car, Kametra jumped out of the car and flagged down the constable.\n\nAngry that Kametra disobeyed him, appellant sped off with the boys. He then\n\ntook them to a creek, told them to sit in the water, place their heads under the\n\nwater, and pretend like they were swimming. Appellant then held their heads\n\nunder the water until they drowned. Afterward, appellant attempted to break\n\ninto the house where his youngest son Jeremiah was sleeping, but was forced out\n\nof the house by Kametra’s brother.\n\n      The calculated and deliberate nature of appellant’s actions in committing\n\nthis violent and heinous double-murder was sufficient to support the jury’s\n\nfinding of future dangerousness.

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1769103\"><a href=\"/opinion/1769103/druery-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 507 (Tex.\n\nCrim. App. 2007) (the circumstances of an offense can be some of the most\n\nrevealing evidence of future dangerousness and may be sufficient to\n\nindependently support an affirmative answer to the future dangerousness issue).\n\nThe State, however, did not rely solely on the facts of the offense to prove\n\nappellant’s future dangerousness.\n\n      The State also presented evidence of appellant’s extensive criminal history,\n\nspanning nearly twenty years, back to when appellant was thirteen-year-old\n\njuvenile. Between January 1993 and August 1994, appellant was arrested seven\n\n                                      173\n\ftimes. Appellant’s offenses included: two burglaries of a habitation, possession of\n\na stolen vehicle, burglary of a coin operated machine, burglary of a motor vehicle,\n\nunauthorized use of a motor vehicle, and evading arrest. After numerous\n\nattempts to place appellant on probation and home supervision, appellant was\n\nconfined to Daytop Village, where appellant received individual and group\n\ncounseling. However, appellant was unable to follow the rules, and after\n\nnumerous infractions, concluding with his assaulting the same juvenile twice in\n\none day, appellant was discharged from the facility on July 1, 1995.\n\n      Following his discharge from Daytop Village, appellant was sent to TYC,\n\nwhere his violent behavior and inability to follow the rules continued. In general,\n\nappellant was explosive and disrespectful to the TYC staff. This was particularly\n\nevident in his treatment of female staff. On one occasion appellant approached\n\nfemale staff member Nina Adams as she was teaching class, and began bumping\n\nhis erect penis against her leg. On several other occasions, appellant called female\n\nstaff bitches, fat mother fuckers, and “ho’s.” Appellant’s infractions, however,\n\nwere not restricted to the TYC staff. Appellant was involved in a three-on-one\n\nfight in the dormitory restroom in which he punched a juvenile that was being\n\nheld down on a toilet. Appellant was also caught with razor blades and crushed\n\n                                        174\n\faspirin. Appellant admitted that he had stolen the razor blades and was trading\n\nthe aspirin for snacks.\n\n      After he was released from TYC, appellant continued to have trouble with\n\nthe law. Appellant picked up three new offenses in 1997: burglary of a vehicle,\n\nevading arrest, and theft of check. The following year, appellant was arrested for\n\nburglary of a vehicle. Appellant’s encounters with the law continued in 1999,\n\nwhen appellant was arrested on a warrant when he was stopped, along with two\n\nother men, during an investigation into a burglary. While the officers determined\n\nthat the appellant and other men were not involved in the burglary, a loaded\n\nshotgun was found inside the vehicle and a bag of marijuana and screwdriver\n\nwere found tossed just outside of the vehicle.\n\n      Additionally, the State presented substantial evidence of appellant’s\n\nviolence against women. In 2001, appellant was caught peering in the window of\n\na female neighbor. When the neighbor confronted appellant, he denied looking in\n\nthe window and threatened to beat her if she continued to say that he had.\n\nAppellant also exhibited physical violence toward his sister Sekinah. In 2009,\n\nappellant took a hammer and hit her twice in the back of the head. Appellant was\n\nsentenced to five years’ deferred adjudication for the charge of aggravated\n\n                                       175\n\fassault with a deadly weapon. Appellant received probation at the request of his\n\nsister, who wanted him to be able to provide for his children. Appellant was on\n\nprobation for this offense when he committed the instant capital murder.\n\n      The State also presented considerable evidence concerning appellant’s\n\nviolent relationship with Kametra. Appellant began a sexual relationship with\n\nKametra when he was twenty-five and she was fifteen. Appellant began hitting\n\nher only a few short weeks into their relationship. The jury heard how appellant\n\nrepeatedly physically abused Kametra, even when she was pregnant with his\n\nthree children. After learning that she was pregnant with their first child,\n\nAppellant kicked her in the stomach in an attempt to cause a miscarriage. When\n\nthat failed, appellant suggested that she drink bleach or use a wire hanger.\n\n      The jury also heard about two particularly violent encounters Kametra had\n\nwith the appellant in the months preceding the capital murder. In February 2011,\n\nappellant punched Kametra in the face, forced his way into her mother’s house,\n\nand grabbed Naim. Appellant then kicked down a door in order to flee the house.\n\nApproximately one month later, appellant forced his way into the car Kametra\n\nwas driving when she came to pick the boys up from a visit with him. Appellant\n\ndemanded that she take him to the store, and when she refused to take him,\n\n                                       176\n\fAppellant choked her until she was unconscious. When she woke up, she was\n\ninside the house where appellant was living with his brother, but had no\n\nrecollection of how she got there. Appellant, who was still angry that she had\n\nrefused his earlier demand, hit Kametra in the head with a heavy object she\n\nbelieved was a gun, when she said she needed to leave. Later, when she\n\nconvinced appellant that she needed to return her sister’s car, appellant insisted\n\non going with her. When Kametra’s sister saw the bruised and bloody condition\n\nshe was in, she called the police. Appellant then grabbed Elijah and told Kametra\n\nshe and Jeremiah had to come with him or he would kill Elijah. When appellant\n\nsaw the police coming, he threw Elijah to the ground and took off running.\n\n      The jury also heard testimony concerning appellant’s actions during his\n\narrest for the instant offense. Appellant resisted when officers tried to handcuff\n\nhim, and it ultimately took four officers to restrain him. Appellant was tased three\n\ntimes before the officers were finally able to place him in handcuffs.\n\n      Moreover, while in jail awaiting his trial for capital murder, appellant\n\ncontinued to have disciplinary infractions and violent outbursts. On October 25,\n\n2011, appellant refused to comply with instructions from an officer when he was\n\ntold he was going to be moved to a different cell. Appellant refused to move and\n\n                                        177\n\ftold the officer that he would have to physically be picked up and moved to the\n\nother cell. Ultimately, appellant was picked up and moved by two officers.\n\n      On April 25, 2012, appellant refused to return a breakfast tray after\n\nreceiving a different breakfast from the one he ordinarily received. Appellant\n\nswung at Officer Thomas when the officer went into appellant’s cell to retrieve\n\nthe tray. It took approximately three to four officers to restrain the appellant.\n\n      On November 24, 2012, in a jail phone call to his brother Jamal, appellant\n\ntold his brother that the only reason he had not “fired off on some of these fools”\n\nwas because he wanted to keep up with his sports and visits.\n\n      Finally, on March 26, 2013, appellant fought with another inmate over the\n\ntelevision. Officer Moreno observed appellant and another inmate in a fighting\n\nstance. The other inmate received scratches to his chest and appellant was given\n\nfifteen days’ full restrictions following the fight.\n\n      It is clear that the State presented sufficient evidence of appellant’s future\n\ndangerousness. Appellant’s argument that he lacked any prior violent convictions\n\nwhich sent him to the penitentiary ignores the evidence presented by the State\n\nthat appellant had committed numerous unadjudicated violent assaults, including\n\nthe assaults against Kametra that occurred in the months preceding the instant\n\n                                           178\n\foffense. It also ignores the fact that he was on probation for aggravated assault\n\nwith a deadly weapon at the time he committed capital murder. Viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to the verdict, appellant’s criminal history – whether or not it\n\ninvolved trips to prison – evidence a violent, unrepentant man.\n\n      The state presented sufficient evidence from which the jury could find\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that there is a probability that appellant would\n\ncommit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to\n\nsociety. Thus, the evidence was legally sufficient to support the jury’s answer to\n\nthe future dangerousness special issue, and Issue 42 should be overruled.\n\n                    Issues 43-54: Federal Constitutional Issues\n\n      In Issues 43 through 54, appellant challenges the constitutionality of the\n\nTexas death penalty statute. He acknowledges that these issues have been\n\npreviously overruled and are asserted mainly to preserve each issue for further\n\nreview in the federal courts. (Appellant’s Brief, pp. 128-36).\n\n      In Issue 43, appellant contends that the statute under which he was\n\nsentenced to death is unconstitutional in violation of the cruel and unusual\n\npunishment prohibition of the Eighth Amendment because it allows the jury too\n\nmuch discretion to determine who should live and who should die and because it\n\n                                         179\n\flacks the minimal standards and guidance necessary for the jury to avoid the\n\narbitrary and capricious imposition of the death penalty.\n\n      In Issue 44, appellant contends that the statute under which he was\n\nsentenced to death violates the due process requirements of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment because it implicitly puts the burden of proving the mitigation\n\nspecial issue on appellant rather than requiring a jury finding against appellant on\n\nthat issue under the beyond a reasonable doubt standard.\n\n      In Issue 45, appellant contends that the trial court erred in denying his\n\nmotion to hold Article 37.071, § 2(e) and (f) concerning the burden of proof\n\nunconstitutional as a violation of Article I, §§ 10 and 13 of the Texas Constitution.\n\n      In Issue 46, appellant contends that the Texas death penalty scheme\n\nviolates due process protections of the United States Constitution because the\n\npunishment special issue related to mitigation fails to require the State to prove\n\nthe absence of sufficient mitigating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt,\n\ncontrary to Apprendi v.
