The trial\n\ncourt followed the jury’s recommendation and sentenced Middleton to death.\n\nMiddleton now appeals his convictions and sentence of death. We have\n\njurisdiction. See art. V, § 3(b)(1), Fla. Const. For the reasons set forth in this\n\n\n\n\n      1. The State nolle prossed the third-degree grand theft charge of the\nindictment.\n\fopinion, we affirm Middleton’s conviction of first-degree murder and uphold his\n\ndeath sentence.\n\n\n                  I. STATEMENT OF THE CASE & FACTS\n\n      Roberta Christensen and her husband of thirty-one years lived in a trailer\n\nacross the street from Middleton. On July 1, 2009, Mr. Christensen went to New\n\nJersey to visit one of the couple’s sons. Prior to his departure, the couple bought\n\nmobile phones that allowed them to use a walkie-talkie feature to communicate\n\nwhile they were apart.\n\n      Middleton lived in a trailer with Garrett Wade Fowler, Kenneth Wade\n\nSullivan and Sullivan’s girlfriend, Haleigh Zinker. On occasion, Middleton would\n\nvisit the victim at her home and would sometimes borrow money and cigarettes\n\nfrom her. On the morning of July 27, 2009, Middleton went over to the victim’s\n\ntrailer while she was preparing to go to the bank. After he left, she realized that\n\nshe had left approximately $400 in tip money out, and suspected that Middleton\n\nhad seen it. She deposited the money into the bank that afternoon. When the\n\nvictim returned from the bank she noticed that someone had attempted to remove\n\nthe screen from the window by her front door.\n\n      On the morning of July 28, 2009, Middleton rode around with his\n\ngirlfriend’s roommate, Steve Britnell, looking for drugs. The two eventually found\n\nmethamphetamine around twelve or one o’clock that afternoon. They returned to\n\n                                         -2-\n\fMiddleton’s trailer and shared the methamphetamine. During that time, Fowler\n\nand his girlfriend were also at the trailer. At approximately 4:30 p.m., Fowler and\n\nBritnell decided to go to Walmart to “boost.” Middleton declined to go, stating\n\nthat he had business to take care of, that someone owed him some money, and that\n\nhe needed to take a shower.\n\n      While Britnell and Fowler were gone, Middleton took a knife from the sink\n\nof his trailer and went to the victim’s home. While in the victim’s kitchen, he\n\nasked her for money. When she refused and attempted to push him out of the\n\ntrailer, he attacked her with the knife. Christensen was alive and moving\n\nerratically as she was dragged from the kitchen area to the bedroom. Once in the\n\nbedroom, Middleton cut Christensen’s throat. Before leaving her home, Middleton\n\nstole her flat screen television and power cord, and carried the television across the\n\nstreet to his trailer. There, he washed his hands in the kitchen sink and changed his\n\nclothes, but kept his boots on. He placed the bloody clothes in a bag with the\n\nmurder weapon.\n\n      When Fowler and Britnell returned to Middleton’s trailer, Middleton was\n\nthere with Chris Jenkins, Sullivan, and Sullivan’s girlfriend. There was a flat\n\nscreen television in the kitchen covered by a blanket. By this time, Middleton had\n\nshowered. His hair was still wet. He stated that the person who owed him money\n\nhad given him the television as payment.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      After Jenkins and Sullivan left, Fowler noticed that Middleton had a red\n\nsubstance on his boots. Middleton claimed the substance was deposited when he\n\nremoved something from the dumpster. Later, Britnell and Middleton drove in\n\nBritnell’s black Pontiac to two different pawn shops, trying to sell the victim’s\n\ntelevision. Both pawn shops were closed. They began making phone calls to find\n\nsomeone who wanted to purchase the television.\n\n      At approximately 5:30 p.m., Middleton called Jenkins and asked him to\n\nbring drugs to Middleton’s home. When Jenkins arrived, Middleton asked Jenkins\n\nto help him sell the television. After Jenkins took a photo of the television, he and\n\nMiddleton went into the bedroom where Middleton crushed and consumed two\n\nRoxicodone pills. Middleton saved one pill for later.\n\n      The victim’s husband had last spoken to her on July 28, 2009, around 2:50\n\np.m. He watched a movie and fell asleep from approximately 4:00 p.m. to 6:40\n\np.m. When he woke up he was surprised that his wife had not called; he repeatedly\n\nattempted to contact her on the walkie-talkie phone, to no avail. He also left a\n\nmessage on their home phone’s voicemail. He then called the couple’s other son\n\nwho lived nearby and asked him to check on Christensen.\n\n      When the Christensens’ son and daughter-in-law arrived at his parents’\n\nhome, he noticed his mother’s car parked in its usual spot. The trailer door was\n\nunlocked, and upon entering the kitchen, he saw a large puddle of blood on the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fkitchen floor. Next to the blood he saw a yellow broom with a sharp edge. He\n\nfollowed a path of blood to a closed bedroom door. He opened the door to find his\n\nmother’s dead body on the floor. He heard his father on the walkie-talkie calling\n\nout for him and his mother. He went outside to call the police and stop his wife\n\nfrom entering the trailer. While on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, he went\n\nback into the trailer to confirm that his mother was not breathing.\n\n      Randy Ammons helped Middleton sell the television to his brother, Rolland\n\nAmmons. When Middleton went to Randy Ammons’ house, he said that he had\n\njust taken a shower and did not want the dog to jump on him. A little after 7 p.m.,\n\nMiddleton, in a vehicle driven by Fowler, followed Randy Ammons to Ronnie\n\nAmmons’ house to sell the television. Fowler stayed outside by his car while\n\nMiddleton took the television, covered with a blanket, inside and sold it to Rolland\n\nAmmons for $200. At some point earlier, while riding around trying to sell the\n\ntelevision, Middleton placed the bag with the bloody clothes and the murder\n\nweapon inside of a dumpster.\n\n      After selling the television, Middleton rode with Britnell to a gas station\n\nwhere Middleton purchased cocaine from someone in a truck and consumed some\n\nof the drugs in the car. Soon thereafter, the serpentine belt on the car broke and\n\nBritnell drove to a relative’s house to have it fixed. While the car was being fixed,\n\nMiddleton walked a few hundred yards to a local bar, Brewskis. Middleton called\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fBritnell to pick him up once the car was fixed. When Middleton got into the car,\n\nhe was upset and crying while on the phone with his girlfriend and said, “I’m\n\nsorry.” Britnell drove them back to the trailer park where Middleton lived. When\n\nthey arrived, there were police cars in the area. Not wanting to get too close to the\n\npolice officers, the two turned off at someone else’s house, where they got out of\n\nthe car and stood in the yard.\n\n      Later that evening, officers found Middleton at the residence of Darrell\n\nDubel. When the officers arrived, Britnell’s car was there. At this time, Middleton\n\nwas barefoot, and had placed his boots and socks in Britnell’s trunk. Officer John\n\nRhoden asked Brandon Jenkins, Britnell, and Middleton to come to the Sheriff’s\n\nOffice for questioning. Middleton’s boots were later recovered from the trunk and\n\nfound to have the victim’s blood on them. While in custody, Middleton confessed.\n\nThe bloody clothes and the murder weapon were never discovered.\n\n                       A. MIDDLETON’S CONFESSION\n\n      During the trial, the State played Middleton’s interview videos for the jury,\n\nincluding the fifth and final video in which Middleton ultimately confessed to the\n\nmurder. Detective Faulkner and Assistant State Attorney Ashley Albright were\n\npresent during Detective Maerki’s questioning of Middleton. The recording of the\n\nfirst interview, which was conducted in Detective Maerki’s office, could not\n\nsubsequently be retrieved. As a precautionary measure, the second and third\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\finterviews were conducted using the computer equipment located in Detective\n\nFaulkner’s office. Maerki read Middleton his rights, as detailed on a Miranda2\n\ncard. Maerki detected an odor of alcohol on Middleton, and also noticed that his\n\neyes were bloodshot and watery. He was surprised that Middleton did not have\n\nslurred speech and that his coordination was fine. He stated that Middleton\n\nseemed to be fully aware of everything that was happening during the\n\ninterrogation.\n\n      Middleton told Maerki that everything happened so fast that he never\n\nchecked to see if the victim had any money. He stated that he thought the victim\n\nended up in the hallway, and he did not remember cutting her throat. He told\n\nMaerki that after the murder, he did not bathe, and he only washed his hands.\n\nMiddleton admitted that he acted alone. He told the police the location of the\n\ndumpster where he threw the bag with his clothes and the murder weapon. He\n\nstated that he kept his boots on and put them in the trunk of Britnell’s small black\n\ncar. He admitted to selling the television later that night to Rolland Ammons for\n\n$200 and using the money to purchase more drugs.\n\n                          B. FORENSIC TESTIMONY\n\n      Crime Scene Technician Jackie Moore assisted Detective Bradley at the\n\ncrime scene. She testified that there was no evidence of a struggle in the living\n\n\n      2. Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\n                                        -7-\n\froom area, but there was a void in the dust on a television stand in the living room\n\nindicating that there was previously a television and remote there. Moore further\n\ntestified that there were bloodstains on the dining room table and chairs that\n\ncontinued toward the master bedroom. Pooling of blood and drag marks were on\n\nthe floor near the refrigerator and the dining room table. The drag marks indicated\n\nthat the victim was alive and moving erratically as she was dragged from the\n\nkitchen area to the bedroom. Blood with drag marks was in the doorway of the\n\nmaster bedroom. The bloodstains on the wall of the bedroom indicated that at\n\nsome point the victim had been standing and had stepped in blood. There were\n\nbloody shoe impressions leading from the master bedroom to the kitchen.\n\n      The victim had a gaping wound in her throat. The medical examiner\n\ntestified that several passes, like a sawing motion with a sharp instrument, created\n\nthe margin of the wound. The blood stains indicated that the victim’s carotid\n\nartery was not cut until she was in the bedroom. Her hands and shirt were\n\nsaturated with blood. Blood also ran down her abdomen and soaked into the\n\nwaistband of her pants. The amount and pattern of blood on the victim’s\n\nwaistband indicates that she may have been sitting up slightly or halfway when she\n\nreceived the neck injury. The victim’s shirt was pulled upwards toward her neck,\n\nwhich is consistent with being dragged.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f      The laceration to the victim’s throat produced significantly more blood than\n\nwas seen in the blood trail through the kitchen. The victim had a bruise on her\n\ncheek consistent with the tread and design of Middleton’s boots, more bruises and\n\na cut to her face, and puncture and stab wounds on her chest, neck, ear, and arms.\n\nThe bloody shoeprints were well defined closer to the bedroom and became faint\n\nas they continued down the hall. The victim’s son’s shoes were tested and\n\neliminated as the shoes that caused the bloody impressions. Moore testified that\n\nthis indicates that the blood was likely dried by the time the victim’s son found her.\n\nThere were various items located close to the victim’s body, which indicate that\n\nshe was grabbing for things during the struggle. The victim had bloody injuries to\n\nher arms and wrists. She had defensive wounds that indicated that she was trying\n\nto get away from someone who had a knife. None of the injuries to the victim’s\n\nextremities would have killed or incapacitated her. The autopsy revealed that the\n\nneck injury occurred toward the end of the attack. Following the neck injury, the\n\nvictim could have been conscious for ten to twenty seconds, and alive for minutes\n\nafter losing consciousness.\n\n      On the kitchen floor of Middleton’s residence, there was a washed out shoe\n\nimpression that was similar to those found inside the victim’s residence. This print\n\ntested positive for blood, but no DNA profile could be obtained. The medical\n\nexaminer found blood on the sink of the only bathroom in Middleton’s trailer, but\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fno DNA profile could be obtained. There was blood beside the dresser in\n\nMiddleton’s bedroom, but the DNA profile was inconclusive. A different\n\nbloodstain in Middleton’s room matched the victim’s DNA on four of thirteen\n\npoints. The probability that a randomly selected Caucasian person could match the\n\nsame DNA profile at these four locations is one in 41,680.\n\n         Donna Lee and Rolland Ammons’ fingerprints were the only prints found on\n\nthe victim’s television. Middleton’s fingerprints were not found inside the victim’s\n\nresidence. There was no evidence that the trailer had been ransacked or that the\n\nvictim’s things had been rifled through. Moore explained that the vanity in the\n\nvictim’s bedroom had blood spatter on the outside, but not the inside, indicating\n\nthat the door to the cabinet of the vanity was closed during the attack. Inside the\n\ncabinet, there was a purse that appeared to have been thrown in there. There was\n\nevidence of blood spatter on the purse and also blood inside of the purse. The\n\npurse was empty, and there were no fingerprints found on the purse.3\n\n                                C. PENALTY PHASE\n\n         During the penalty phase, the defense presented testimony from Dr. James\n\nD. Barnard, and the State presented testimony from Dr. Deborah Leperowski.4 The\n\n\n         3. During the guilt phase, the defense rested without presenting a case-in-\nchief.\n\n      4. They testified consistently with their respective testimony provided at the\nhearing on Middleton’s pre-trial motion to suppress his confession.\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fdefense’s court-appointed mitigation investigator, Joe Parish, also testified, as did\n\nMiddleton’s sisters.\n\n                       i. Psychological Witnesses Testimony\n\n      Dr. Barnard assisted the defense in formulating mitigating evidence and\n\nconducted a mental health evaluation of Middleton. His findings indicated that\n\nMiddleton underreported the type of drugs he abused and the frequency of their\n\nuse. Dr. Barnard determined that Middleton began abusing painkillers after being\n\nprescribed the medications following an accidental fall. He also determined that\n\nMiddleton began smoking marijuana between the ages of ten and thirteen. He\n\ndescribed the onset of cocaine use at age twenty-five, ceasing at age thirty.\n\nAdditionally, Middleton told Dr. Barnard that he had used methamphetamine once\n\na year since he was twenty-eight years old. This statement conflicted with his\n\nassertion during his police interview that the day of the murder was the first time\n\nhe had ever used methamphetamine. Dr. Barnard testified that Middleton reported\n\nbriefly being medically treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nDr. Barnard characterized the symptoms of ADHD as difficulty with impulse\n\ncontrol, difficulty regulating behavior to standards or norms, high rate motor\n\nactivity, and difficulty focusing attention.\n\n      Dr. Barnard also found that Middleton was possibly exaggerating his\n\nsymptoms, which may be viewed as a cry for help. Dr. Barnard found it quite\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\fsignificant that individuals with Middleton’s personality type are known to have\n\nproblems with repressed anger and hostility. Dr. Barnard testified that such\n\nindividuals are sometimes able to control their anger, but sometimes have outbursts\n\nthat are difficult or impossible for them to control. Equally significant, opined Dr.\n\nBarnard, is that individuals with this personality type have problems responding to\n\nauthority and taking direction, oftentimes accepting little or no responsibility for\n\ntheir behavior. Dr. Barnard concluded that Middleton could not conform his\n\nconduct to the requirements of the law on the day in question, and that his\n\nsubstance abuse on the date of the murder would likely impair anyone’s\n\npsychological controls, even someone who had no difficulty with impulse control.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Barnard admitted that he did not review all of the\n\nrecords in this case, such as the depositions of people close to Middleton, his arrest\n\nand jail records and his confession to the murder. Dr. Barnard conceded that\n\nMiddleton was not mentally retarded. The State questioned Dr. Barnard about the\n\nreport that was conducted by Dr. Landrum in August 2009 which found\n\nMiddleton’s IQ to be 72. Dr. Barnard testified that Middleton informed him that\n\nhe did not give his best effort on the IQ test conducted by Dr. Landrum. When Dr.\n\nBarnard administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) test in\n\nSeptember 2011, he determined that Middleton’s full scale IQ was 83. Dr. Barnard\n\ndetermined that Middleton was not malingering during the exam he administered.\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fHe stated that he was aware that Middleton was administered the WAIS-IV test for\n\na third time in this case by Dr. Riordan in March 2012.\n\n      Dr. Riordan’s March 2012, evaluation indicated that Middleton’s IQ score\n\nwas 75. Dr. Barnard would have expected Middleton’s IQ score to be higher, if all\n\nother factors were stable. This lower score could be an indication of various\n\nfactors including Middleton being under the weather or malingering. There were\n\nno indications that Middleton was ever separated from the general population in\n\nprison due to any mental health issues. Dr. Barnard admitted that Middleton slit\n\nhis wrists in a holding cell in an attempt not to be extradited back to a facility in\n\nGeorgia.\n\n      Dr. Deborah Leporowski testified for the State. She stated that in order to\n\nprepare for her testimony, she reviewed Dr. Barnard’s report, previous court\n\ntestimony, and deposition; Dr. Landrum’s report; and Dr. Riordan’s report, prior\n\ncourt testimony, and deposition. She also interviewed Middleton and reviewed the\n\npolice reports in this case and transcripts, witness interviews, letters that Middleton\n\nwrote while he was in jail, and Department of Corrections records. Dr.\n\nLeporowski maintained that Middleton’s IQ scores are illogical with an initial\n\nscore of 72, a score of 83 two years later and then months later receiving a score of\n\n75. Dr. Leporowski opined that a score of 83 is likely Middleton’s actual IQ score.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\fDr. Leporowski diagnosed Middleton with antisocial personality disorder, as did\n\nDr. Barnard.\n\n      Dr. Leporowski determined that Middleton was malingering “or at least\n\nexaggerating” when taking his personality tests. Dr. Leporowski found no history\n\nof mental illness in Middleton’s records or in her interview with him. She rejected\n\nany assertion that Middleton’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct\n\nor to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially\n\nimpaired. She opined that Middleton’s upbringing did not in any way lead him to\n\nbelieve that those actions involving this crime were acceptable or were warranted\n\nin any way based on the victim’s behavior, stating, “Everything he told me about\n\nthat day was logical, made sense, and indicated that he was able to make decisions\n\nand choices.” Dr. Leporowski further noted that Middleton appeared to remember\n\nwhat he did throughout the day, where he did drugs, and the individuals with\n\nwhom he did them. On cross-examination, she stated that Middleton’s jail records\n\nindicated that his detox from drugs while in jail was typical and did not evidence\n\ndrug dependence, but rather suggested that he used them intermittently when he\n\nhad access to them.\n\n                          ii. Family History Testimony\n\n      The trial court appointed Joe Parrish, a licensed private investigator, to assist\n\nthe defense in developing mitigation for the penalty phase. Parrish determined that\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fMiddleton’s mother abused drugs and his older siblings acted as parents to him.\n\nMiddleton expressed to Parrish some depression concerning the death of his father\n\nfigure, a former employer. Parrish found that Middleton was employed at a\n\nwelding company for a period of time and was described by the owner as being a\n\nhard worker and very dependable. Parrish also found that marijuana use at an early\n\nage led Middleton to abuse more dangerous drugs. Parrish spoke with Middleton’s\n\neldest daughter, who lived with her mother and younger sister in the same mobile\n\npark. She explained that in the days leading up to the murder, she noticed that her\n\nfather’s physical appearance had changed and that he was abusing drugs. Parrish\n\nalso described a history of domestic violence between Middleton and his girlfriend,\n\nSabrina Jones.\n\n      Devenna Pearson, one of Middleton’s older sisters, testified on his behalf.\n\nShe described their childhood as physically and emotionally painful. She\n\nexplained that their mother provided for the necessities of life, such as food,\n\nclothing, shelter and basic hygiene through social security benefits which she\n\nreceived following the death of her husband. She explained that she and\n\nMiddleton were never required to go to school. Pearson additionally explained that\n\nshe was sexually molested by her stepfather for approximately three and a half\n\nyears, and that her mother was aware of the abuse but did not stop it. Her older\n\nsister found out and stopped the abuse by cutting their abusive stepfather. She\n\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\frecalled that she was sent away for a few months and Middleton remained in the\n\nhouse with their mother. She described her brother, as she knew him growing up,\n\nas outgoing, fun and someone who always tried to make everyone laugh.\n\n      Dewanna Sprowse, Middleton’s eldest sister, also testified on his behalf.\n\nShe explained that their mother would sell her food stamps for beer and drugs.\n\nSprowse recalled that Middleton did not have clean clothes and fitted shoes, and\n\nthat if she was not home to get her siblings up and ready for school, their mother\n\nwould just tell them to go outside and play. She explained that one of her\n\nstepfathers was physically abusive to her younger siblings, including Middleton.\n\nShe testified that their mother had always placed men before her children and did\n\nnot spend any money on holidays, birthdays, or books. She recalled Middleton\n\nbeing about age twelve or thirteen when he finally quit going to school. She\n\ndescribed Middleton, as she remembered him growing up, as a sweetheart,\n\ntalented, with a good heart.5\n\n       D. MIDDLETON’S PRETRIAL MOTION TO SUPPRESS HIS\n                        CONFESSION\n\n      The defense filed a motion to suppress the defendant’s confession, claiming\n\nthat Middleton was too intoxicated to waive his Miranda rights. The motion\n\n\n\n       5. The trial court held a Spencer hearing on August 24, 2012. See Spencer\nv. State, 133 So. 2d 729 (Fla. 1961). Neither the State nor the defense presented\nany additional evidence.\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\fadditionally alleged that Middleton does not possess the intellectual ability to\n\ncomprehend his Miranda rights and that Middleton’s final interview was conducted\n\nafter Middleton’s attorney provided the Sheriff’s Office with a form invoking\n\nMiddleton’s constitutional right to remain silent. The hearing on the motion took\n\nplace on April 10, 2012, and June 29, 2012.\n\n                                 i. Lay Witnesses\n\n      During the hearing on the motion to suppress, Jenkins testified for the\n\ndefense. He testified that he is disabled and was prescribed Oxycodone\n\n(Roxicodone) and Xanax, and that he had been selling or giving Middleton his\n\nprescription medications since 2007. On the day of the murder, he went to\n\nMiddleton’s trailer to give him some drugs and to look at the television Middleton\n\nwanted to sell. He gave Middleton three Roxicodone pills. Middleton snorted two\n\nof the pills while Jenkins was there.\n\n      The State called Britnell to testify at the suppression hearing. Consistent\n\nwith his guilt phase testimony, Britnell recalled that he and Middleton each took\n\none Xanax pill on the morning of the murder. He further recalled that in the early\n\nafternoon, the two shared $20 worth of methamphetamine, which Britnell\n\ndescribed as “a little bit.” He indicated that immediately following the sale of the\n\ntelevision, he drove Middleton to a Circle K to purchase cocaine. They each\n\nconsumed “a line or two” of cocaine in the Circle K parking lot. Later, Captain\n\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\fJohn Rhoden and Lieutenant Brad Stark approached them and asked them to come\n\nto the police station to give a statement. They drove to the station voluntarily.\n\n       Captain John Rhoden testified that Middleton had no trouble standing or\n\nkeeping his posture, did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol,\n\nhis speech was clear, and he did not appear to have any problems understanding\n\nwhat was being said to him. Lieutenant Stark testified that none of the men\n\nappeared to be off-balance. Nothing indicated that the defendant was under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol. On cross-examination, he stated that it would surprise him to\n\nhear that Middleton had done methamphetamine, cocaine and Xanax during that\n\nday.\n\n       Detective Marty Faulkner testified regarding Middleton’s interviews. The\n\nfirst occurred on July 28, 2009, at 11:56 p.m., in his office, with another detective\n\nand Assistant State Attorney Ashley Albright present. He read the Miranda card\n\nverbatim to Middleton, who signed, dated, and time-stamped the card. Middleton\n\nagreed to speak with detectives, but seemed nervous. He stated that Middleton\n\nappeared to be coherent, and not under the influence of any drugs; Middleton was\n\nresponsive to questions and his memory appeared to be fine. The interview lasted\n\napproximately one hour. Middleton made no admissions during this interview.\n\n       Faulkner interviewed Middleton a second time, again in his office, in the\n\nearly morning hours of July 29, 2009. Middleton made no admissions. The third\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\finterview lasted three minutes, and at that time Middleton claimed that Fowler had\n\ncommitted the murder. Middleton was placed under arrest at the end of the third\n\ninterview. When Faulkner returned to work, at approximately 11 a.m., Sergeant\n\nColeman informed him that Middleton wanted to speak with him. Coleman\n\ntestified and corroborated that Middleton made this request and that he relayed the\n\nrequest to Faulkner. This interview lasted for approximately twenty-three minutes\n\nbefore Middleton asked to go back to his cell. The officers then immediately\n\nconcluded the interview and returned Middleton to his cell.\n\n      Faulkner further testified that on July 30, he felt obligated to check on\n\nMiddleton, based on Middleton’s state of mind during the interview conducted the\n\nprevious day. When Faulkner arrived, Middleton was in segregation and standing\n\nat the gate of his cell. Middleton asked to speak to him, and Faulkner had\n\nMiddleton escorted to his office, where the final interview transpired. During this\n\nfinal interview, after repeatedly being advised of his Miranda rights, Middleton\n\nconfessed to murdering Christensen. On cross-examination, Faulkner\n\nacknowledged that he informed Middleton that he would have to waive his right to\n\ncounsel to speak with him. Only after the final (approximately seventh) time\n\nFaulkner told Middleton what he would have to say in order to waive his rights,\n\ndid Middleton in fact waive his rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 19 -\n\f      Assistant Public Defender Stanley Glenn testified that he was initially\n\nappointed to represent Middleton. He stated that on the morning of July 30, 2009,\n\nhe filed an invocation of rights form with the clerk’s office and that afternoon he\n\npersonally delivered it to the Sheriff’s Office front desk, instructing them to give it\n\nto the lead detective investigating Christensen’s death. Glenn first met with\n\nMiddleton the next day and reviewed the form with him. Middleton was very\n\ndepressed at this time. Glenn was concerned that Middleton needed someone to\n\ntalk to and may make incriminating statements. He repeatedly informed Middleton\n\nnot to make any statements without him being present. On cross-examination,\n\nGlenn acknowledged that unbeknownst to him, on July 30, 2009, at 11:28 a.m.,\n\nwhen he filed the invocation of rights form and delivered it to the Sheriff’s Office\n\nthat afternoon, the defendant had already confessed at approximately 9:24 a.m.\n\n                            ii. Psychological Testimony\n\n      Forensic Psychologist Dr. Gregory Landrum testified for the defense at the\n\nsuppression hearing. He testified that he met with Middleton on two occasions in\n\nAugust 2009. He indicated that Middleton was competent to proceed and assist in\n\nhis own defense. He determined that Middleton’s IQ was 72, which is in the\n\nborderline mental retardation range. He additionally determined that Middleton\n\nreads on a fifth-grade level. Dr. Landrum was not asked to do an evaluation\n\nregarding Miranda competency.\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\f      On cross examination, Dr. Landrum stated emphatically that Middleton is\n\nnot mentally retarded. Dr. Landrum stated that it is possible that Middleton was\n\nfaking when he was examined by Dr. Riordan, who determined that his IQ was 75,\n\nmonths after being examined by Dr. Barnard, who determined that it was an 83.\n\nAccording to Dr. Landrum, administering the same tests within a year may yield\n\ninaccurate results.\n\n      Dr. James Barnard also testified for the defense. He prepared two reports,\n\none was a psychological evaluation and the other examined Middleton’s\n\ncompetency to waive his Miranda rights. He determined that Middleton’s full\n\nscale IQ was 83. He additionally found that Middleton was not malingering. Dr.\n\nBarnard indicated that Middleton’s chronic use of drugs resulted in an increased\n\ntolerance for the substances and the need for more of the substances to get high.\n\nThis factor and other factors indicate dependence on a substance versus abuse. He\n\nreported Middleton’s statement that drugs make him “go, go, go,” and render him\n\nless able to control his impulses, and that Middleton told him that before he went\n\nto jail he had not slept for two nights. Dr. Barnard opined that Middleton should\n\nhave been placed in a private detox facility when he was arrested. Dr. Barnard\n\ndetermined that at the time of Middleton’s confession, he was likely withdrawing\n\nfrom substances and may have been under the effects of substances at least during\n\nthe time of his initial interrogation.\n\n\n                                         - 21 -\n\f      Dr. Barnard administered an instrument entitled “Dr. Thomas Grisso’s\n\nUnderstanding and Appreciating Miranda Rights.” Dr. Barnard testified that\n\nMiddleton’s total score was 13 out of 30, more than two standard deviations below\n\nthe mean. He testified that, although Middleton could paraphrase portions of\n\nMiranda, he “showed a very significant weakness in terms of his ability to\n\nintelligently apply knowledge of Miranda, to novel situations.” Dr. Barnard stated\n\nthat it was difficult to reconcile his findings during the testing with what he saw on\n\nthe confession video. He explained that there is no correlation between having had\n\nMiranda warnings administered in the past and actually understanding them. He\n\nalso stated that there are no validity scales for Grisso’s Miranda test.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Barnard stated that Middleton made general\n\nremarks indicating that he may have been malingering during the testing with Dr.\n\nLandrum, but he did not specifically mention whether he was referring to the IQ\n\ntest. Dr. Barnard’s testing also indicated that Middleton may have exaggerated\n\nsome of his answers to appear more maladjusted than he actually was on the date\n\nof the testing. Dr. Barnard diagnosed Middleton with anti-social personality\n\ndisorder; he explained that one major tenet of this disorder is that the person has a\n\ntendency to be untruthful.\n\n      Dr. Barnard further testified that, before the Grisso test was administered,\n\nMiddleton stated he had been Mirandized at least five times. However, after the\n\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\fGrisso test, Middleton claimed that he had never been read Miranda rights, despite\n\nhis extensive criminal history. After the Grisso test, Middleton told Dr. Barnard\n\nthat the confession tapes had been altered. Middleton also told the doctor that\n\nmethamphetamines make him think better. Middleton made comments to Dr.\n\nBarnard indicating that the police in Okeechobee violated his rights, which Dr.\n\nBarnard opined indicates that he knew what his rights were.\n\n      On redirect, Dr. Barnard stated that the conditions that Middleton was under\n\nat the time of the interrogation, plus the interrogation procedures themselves, made\n\nit more likely that he would acquiesce to the police. He also opined that Middleton\n\ndid not fully comprehend his Miranda rights when he waived them.\n\n      Dr. Michael Riordan testified for the defense. Dr. Riordan was ordered to\n\nconduct a neuropsychological evaluation on Middleton. Dr. Riordan prepared a\n\nwritten report, which he subsequently modified. He modified his original finding\n\nthat Middleton had brain damage and in the subsequent report he indicated that\n\nMiddleton suffers from a cognitive disorder. He explained that “the cognitive\n\ndisorder was the more appropriate term [for] a neuropsychologist to report.” Dr.\n\nRiordan reviewed the reports prepared by Dr. Barnard. He agreed with Dr.\n\nBarnard’s finding that Middleton was incompetent to waive his Miranda rights at\n\nthe time of his interrogation, based on his borderline intellectual functioning, his\n\ncognitive disorder, and his drug use which would have caused withdrawals at the\n\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\ftime of the interrogation. Dr. Riordan also found that Middleton had\n\npolysubstance dependence disorder. He indicated that Middleton was not\n\nmalingering. Dr. Riordan did not have Middleton perform another Grisso test, and\n\ndid not disagree with Dr. Barnard’s findings.\n\n      Dr. Riordan did not diagnose an antisocial personality disorder. His report\n\nindicated that Middleton had a tendency to exaggerate his problems. Dr. Riordan\n\nhad previously indicated in a February 11, 2012, letter to the defense that\n\nMiddleton was not initially incompetent to waive his Miranda rights, but as the\n\ninterrogation progressed, that he became incompetent to proceed. Dr. Riordan also\n\nwrote a letter to the defense in April 2012, indicating that Middleton’s withdrawals\n\nwould have furthered his incompetence. However, Dr. Riordan did not review jail\n\nrecords to determine whether Middleton was suffering from withdrawal symptoms,\n\nand Middleton did not state that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms\n\nduring the interrogation. Instead, he told Dr. Riordan that the police harassed him\n\nand tampered with the confession tapes. Dr. Riordan was not aware that Middleton\n\nsigned a Miranda waiver.\n\n      Dr. Deborah Leporowski testified for the State. She testified that she\n\nreviewed Dr. Landrum’s report, along with the deposition reports and in-court\n\ntestimony of Dr. Riordan. She also reviewed Dr. Barnard’s raw data and\n\ndeposition, and she was present for his testimony. Additionally, she reviewed\n\n\n                                        - 24 -\n\fMiddleton’s videotaped confessions, witness statements, drug treatment records,\n\nDepartment of Corrections and jail records, and also interviewed Middleton at the\n\ncounty jail on May 10, 2012. She did not administer the WAIS test because it\n\nalready had been administered three times. She testified that the discrepancy in the\n\nscores may be due to poor motivation or deliberately underperforming on the test\n\nwith Dr. Riordan. Dr. Leporowski reviewed Dr. Riordan’s neuropsychological\n\ntesting, his raw data, and his report, and she determined that Middleton performed\n\nin the average or above average range on most instruments. She opined that “[t]he\n\nonly areas where he demonstrated anything really in an impaired range were\n\ninstruments that I felt could be accounted for by his lack of education.” She\n\nobserved that his scores varied on the memory tests, with delayed recall being in\n\nthe impaired range, stating “[t]hose are essentially the only two areas where there’s\n\nanything that’s not perfectly intact in the overall neuropsychological functioning\n\narea.”\n\n         Dr. Leporowski stated that she would not diagnose the defendant with brain\n\ndamage or a cognitive disorder. She stated there was nothing in the\n\nneuropsychological testing that would indicate that Middleton had trouble\n\ncomprehending the Miranda warnings. Additionally, she said Middleton was\n\ncandid with her about his drug use on the day of the murder, and even told her that\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\fhe used another drug that day, OxyContin, which Britnell did not report. He did\n\nnot have difficulty reporting the information in a logical order.\n\n          In addition to not administering another WAIS-IV test, Dr. Leporowski did\n\nnot administer another Grisso test. She explained that the shortcomings of the\n\nGrisso test are that it was developed for a particular jurisdiction in 1980 and that\n\nthe language for which it tests has not been updated despite the administration of\n\nthe warnings across jurisdictions. Middleton told Dr. Leporowski that he was\n\nthreatened and that the confession tapes had been altered. She concluded that\n\nMiddleton had the capacity to knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda\n\nrights.\n\n          Dr. Leporowski disagreed with Dr. Riordan’s testimony indicating that\n\nMiddleton was suffering from withdrawals. She opined that withdrawals typically\n\noccur seventy-two hours after consuming drugs and alcohol. She explained that on\n\nhis jail medical records, he is described as cool, cooperative, coherent, and not\n\nagitated. Dr. Leporowski spoke with the jail nurse who indicated that they never\n\nhad to use detox protocols for Middleton and that he did not need any medical\n\nattention at all. She opined that this is indicative of his intermittent use, rather than\n\nhis continuous use of the substances. Dr. Leporowski found that Middleton was\n\nmalingering during her evaluations of him.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 26 -\n\f      On cross-examination, Dr. Leporowski acknowledged that Middleton\n\nreported doing methamphetamine before lunch, followed by eighty milligrams of\n\nOxyContin, then Roxicodone that afternoon at his trailer, and Xanax and cocaine\n\nlater that evening. He also indicated that he walked down to Brewskis and\n\nconsumed a couple of beers and three lines of cocaine.\n\n      The trial court denied the defense’s motion to suppress Middleton’s\n\nconfession.\n\n                                   II. ANALYSIS\n\n                      A. AVOID ARREST AGGRAVATOR\n\n      Middleton first argues that the trial court erred in finding the avoid arrest\n\naggravator. We agree that the record does not support this aggravator as\n\nMiddleton’s sole or dominant motivation for the murder. This Court has\n\nconsistently held that where the victim is not a law enforcement officer, “the State\n\nmust show that the sole or dominant motive for the murder was the elimination of\n\nthe witness” in order to prove this aggravator. See, e.g., Davis v. State, 604 So. 2d\n\n794 (Fla. 1992); Green v. State, 583 So. 2d 647 (Fla. 1991); Perry v. State, 522 So.\n\n2d 817 (Fla. 1988). The trial court’s order on this issue lists eight facts that\n\nsupport this aggravator:\n\n      (1) the defendant personally knew the victim, and went to her home\n      without any type of disguise; (2) the defendant told Garrett Wade\n      Fowler that he was going to rob Roberta Christensen, after seeing a\n      large amount of money inside her home the day before; (3) the\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\f       defendant walked 130 feet to the victim’s home in broad daylight;\n       (4) the defendant knew that the victim was home because he could see\n       her red car from his own home, and the car was parked directly in\n       front of the entrance to her home; (5) the defendant knew that the\n       victim’s husband was out of town and she was home alone; (6) the\n       victim did not pose any physical threat to the defendant; (7) the\n       defendant armed himself with a knife from his residence, before going\n       over to the victim’s home; and (8) the victim was the defendant’s\n       neighbor, who lived almost directly across the street.\n\nIn addition, the trial court indicated that the main object of the criminal endeavor\n\nwas the tip money, not the television. Finally, the trial judge said that if the victim\n\nwas left alive the defendant would have been quickly arrested.\n\n       Notably, only a few of these factors have a direct bearing or support the\n\navoid arrest aggravator (the defendant knew the victim and did not wear a disguise\n\nand the defendant would have been promptly arrested had the victim lived and\n\nidentified him). Many of the other factors listed by the trial court for this\n\naggravator either supported Middleton’s statement that he went to the victim’s\n\nhome to borrow money, or that he went there only intending to rob her, before\n\nthings became “crazy.” This Court has determined that the eighth factor listed is\n\nnot enough to prove this aggravator. See Foster v. State, 778 So. 2d 906 (Fla.\n\n2000); Consalvo v. State, 697 So. 2d 805 (Fla. 1996). Additionally, the trial\n\ncourt’s determination that Middleton’s primary objective was to obtain the “easily\n\nconcealable tip money,” implies that pecuniary gain was a dominant motive for the\n\nkilling.\n\n\n                                         - 28 -\n\f      In Davis, Green, and Perry, the defendants raised similar issues involving\n\nthe avoid arrest aggravator. In each of these cases, this Court struck the avoid\n\narrest aggravator even though the defendants were acquainted with the victims. In\n\nDavis, the defendant stabbed an elderly female acquaintance inside her home and\n\nstole some of the victim’s belongings before exiting the residence. Davis, 604 So.\n\n2d at 795. In Green, the defendant and his girlfriend went to the home of their\n\nlandlords, a married couple, and paid them $250, under the threat of an impending\n\neviction. Green, 583 So. 2d at 648. Green went home, changed his shirt, grabbed\n\nthe largest butcher knife from his kitchen and went back to his landlord’s house.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house, his landlord let him into the house, but was adamant\n\nabout keeping Green’s check. Green stabbed the husband and wife. Green\n\nreturned the knife to his home and, later that night, hitched a ride from\n\nHillsborough County to St. Petersburg and then to Ft. Lauderdale. Id. at 649. In\n\nPerry, the defendant killed his neighbor during a robbery attempt. 522 So. 2d at\n\n819. The fact that the victims could have identified the defendants was not enough\n\nto demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the sole or dominant motive for the\n\nmurders was witness elimination.\n\n      Although the trial judge correctly stated that the avoid arrest aggravator can\n\nbe supported by circumstantial evidence through inferences from the facts in the\n\nrecord, his reliance on cases such as Jennings v. State, 718 So. 2d 144 (Fla. 1998),\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fand Riley v. State, 366 So. 2d 19, 22 (Fla. 1978), is not well-founded. In Jennings\n\nwe upheld the finding of this aggravator based on the fact that the defendant knew\n\nthe victim, used gloves, and stated that if he ever committed a robbery he would\n\nnot leave any witnesses. Jennings, 718 So. 2d at 150-51. In Riley, we affirmed the\n\nfinding of this aggravator based on the fact that the defendant knew the victim\n\ncoupled with the fact that the victim was “executed after one of the perpetrators\n\nexpressed a concern for subsequent identification.” Riley, 366 So. 2d at 22.\n\n        Although the trial court infers that Middleton killed the victim because he\n\nwould have been arrested quickly if he had left her alive, there are no other facts\n\nthat indicate that this was his sole or dominant reason for killing her, especially in\n\nthe absence of other evidence indicating that Middleton was specifically concerned\n\nabout eliminating the victim as a witness. Therefore, we strike this aggravating\n\ncircumstance.\n\n                             B. CCP AGGRAVATOR\n\n      Middleton next challenges the trial court’s finding of the cold, calculated\n\nand premeditated aggravator (CCP). On appeal, it is this Court’s task to review the\n\nrecord to ensure that the trial court applied the correct rule of law for each\n\naggravating circumstance, and if so, determine whether there is competent\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the finding. Willacy v. State, 696 So.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f2d 695 (Fla. 1997). We agree with Middleton that there was not competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support this aggravator.\n\n      In order to establish the CCP aggravator, it is the State’s burden to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt four elements:\n\n       that the killing was the product of cool and calm reflection and not an act\nprompted by emotional frenzy, panic, or a fit of rage (cold); that the defendant had\na careful plan or prearranged design to commit murder before the fatal incident\n(calculated); that the defendant exhibited heightened premeditation (premeditated);\nand that the defendant had no pretense of moral or legal justification.\n\n      Franklin v. State, 965 So. 2d 79, 98 (Fla. 2007). “‘CCP involves a much\n\nhigher degree of premeditation’ than is required to prove first-degree murder.”\n\nDeparvine v. State, 995 So. 2d 351, 381-82 (Fla. 2008) (quoting Foster v. State,\n\n778 So. 2d 906, 921 (Fla. 2001)). “Premeditation can be established by examining\n\nthe circumstances of the killing and the conduct of the accused.” Franklin, 965 So.\n\n2d at 98. Further, “the evidence must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\ndefendant planned or prearranged to commit murder before the crime began.”\n\nThompson v. State, 565 So. 2d 1311, 1318 (Fla. 1990). “The CCP aggravator can\n\n‘be indicated by circumstances showing such facts as advance procurement of a\n\nweapon, lack of resistance or provocation, and the appearance of a killing carried\n\nout as a matter of course.’” Franklin, 965 So. 2d at 98 (quoting Swafford v. State,\n\n533 So. 2d 270, 277 (Fla. 1988)).\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 31 -\n\f      In this case, the evidence is inconsistent with the murder being a product of\n\ncool and calm reflection. Although Middleton procured a knife prior to entering\n\nthe victim’s residence, there is no evidence that he possessed the weapon for the\n\npurpose of attacking the victim. Rather, Middleton planned to commit a robbery.\n\nIn walking over to the victim’s residence, Middleton did not conceal his identity.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while inside the victim’s residence, the victim refused\n\nMiddleton’s request for money. After a struggle ensued, Middleton fatally stabbed\n\nthe victim. It was during the course of this struggle that Middleton formulated his\n\nintent to kill her. Middleton’s behavior at the time of the murder can be aptly\n\ndescribed as murder committed in a frenzied rage or during a heated struggle\n\nfollowing the victim’s refusal to give him money. Following this spontaneous\n\nmurder—which was not carried out as a matter of course—the victim’s body\n\nremained in her residence; Middleton left her home with the victim’s television.\n\n      Based on this evidence, we conclude that the State did not prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Middleton had a careful prearranged plan or design to\n\nmurder the victim before he entered her residence. Thus, we disagree with the trial\n\ncourt’s finding that the murder was a planned event, not a sudden, impulsive act.\n\nAlthough following the murder Middleton washed his hands in his kitchen sink,\n\nchanged his clothes, and placed his bloody clothes in a bag with the murder\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 32 -\n\fweapon—as noted by the trial court—these actions do not prove that he planned\n\nthe murder beforehand.\n\n       We conclude that the evidence is not indicative of a heightened,\n\npremeditated intent to murder. The facts in this case are similar to Castro v. State,\n\n644 So. 2d 987, 991 (Fla. 1994), which did not involve a careful design and\n\nheightened premeditation necessary for CCP when “the record reflect[ed] that\n\nCastro planned to rob Scott.” In addition, in Hansbrough v. State, 509 So. 2d\n\n1081, 1086 (Fla. 1987), we did not find the cold and calculated premeditation\n\nnecessary for CCP where there “appear[ed] to be a robbery that got out of hand,”\n\nresulting in a “frenzied stabbing.” Accordingly, we conclude that there is no\n\ncompetent, substantial evidence to support the finding of the CCP aggravator.\n\nTherefore, we strike the finding of this aggravator.\n\n      “When this Court strikes an aggravating factor on appeal, ‘the harmless error\n\ntest is applied to determine whether there is no reasonable possibility that the error\n\naffected the sentence.’” Williams v. State, 967 So. 2d 735, 765 (Fla. 2007)\n\n(quoting Jennings v. State, 782 So. 2d 853, 863 n. 9 (Fla. 2001)); Diaz v. State, 860\n\nSo. 2d 960, 968 (Fla. 2003) (“We find this error harmless, however, after\n\nconsideration of the two remaining aggravating circumstances and the five\n\nmitigating circumstances in this case.”). Despite striking the avoid arrest and CCP\n\naggravators, two valid aggravators remain in this unanimous death-\n\n\n                                        - 33 -\n\frecommendation case. The two aggravators which remain are HAC and during the\n\ncommission of a burglary/pecuniary gain aggravators, which were each given\n\n“great weight” by the trial court. The trial court did not find any statutory\n\nmitigation applicable in this case.\n\n      In its sentencing order, the trial court expressly stated that “any of the\n\nconsidered aggravating circumstances found in this case, standing alone, would be\n\nsufficient to outweigh the mitigation in total presented regarding the murder of\n\n[Roberta Christensen].” Similarly, in Smith v. State, 28 So. 3d 838, 868 (Fla.\n\n2009), this Court held that the trial court’s erroneous finding of the CCP\n\naggravator was harmless because the sentencing order provided that “any one of\n\nthe aggravators found (except the felony probation aggravator) was sufficient to\n\noutweigh the mitigating circumstances found in this case and due to the other\n\napplicable aggravating factors.” It is clear that the trial court would have imposed\n\na death sentence for Middleton absent the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators.\n\nBecause we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the erroneous\n\nfindings of the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators contributed to Middleton’s death\n\nsentence, the errors were harmless.\n\n                            C. PROPORTIONALITY\n\n      Middleton argues that without the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators, his\n\ndeath sentence is disproportionate as compared to cases such as Perry and Davis.\n\n\n                                        - 34 -\n\fAfter striking the two aggravators in this case, we find that the sentence of death is\n\nstill proportional to similar cases.\n\n      In order to ensure uniformity in death penalty proceedings, this Court\n\nundertakes a “comprehensive analysis” of the aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances “to determine whether the case falls within the category of the most\n\naggravated and least mitigated.” See Floyd v. State, 913 So. 2d 564, 578 (Fla.\n\n2005) (quoting Anderson v. State, 841 So. 2d 390, 407-08 (Fla. 2003)). This\n\nanalysis involves a thoughtful and deliberate proportionality review considering\n\nthe totality of circumstances of the case and then comparing it with other capital\n\ncases with similar aggravating and mitigating circumstances. “It is not a\n\ncomparison between the number of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.”\n\nTillman v. State, 591 So. 2d 167, 169 (Fla. 1991) (quoting Porter v. State, 564 So.\n\n2d 1060, 1064 (Fla. 1990)).\n\n      In this case, the jury voted twelve to zero in favor of the death penalty. The\n\ntrial court weighed four aggravators against eleven non-statutory mitigators.6 The\n\naggravators found are: (1) the capital felony was committed while the defendant\n\nwas engaged in the commission of a burglary or an attempt to commit a burglary\n\nand the capital felony was committed for pecuniary gain; (2) the capital felony was\n\n\n       6. The trial court determined that the proposed mitigator that Middleton’s\ncapacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to\nthe requirements of the law was substantially impaired, was not proven.\n\n                                        - 35 -\n\fcommitted for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting\n\nescape from custody; (3) the capital felony was HAC; and (4) the capital felony\n\nwas CCP. The court gave all of these aggravators great weight. The eleven non-\n\nstatutory mitigators found are: (a) the defendant has below-average or borderline\n\nintelligence (little weight); (b) the defendant suffers from attention deficit\n\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (little weight) (c) the defendant has a long history\n\nof chronic substance abuse (some weight); (d) the defendant had no adult role\n\nmodels to guide him as a child (little weight); (e) the defendant’s mother was not\n\ninvolved in child-rearing or supervision and was unavailable emotionally for her\n\nchildren (little weight); (f) the defendant had a steady history of employment until\n\nhis chronic substance abuse and incarcerations made it difficult to maintain such\n\nemployment (little weight); (g) the defendant had little, if any, formal education\n\n(little weight); (h) the defendant has two children (little weight); (i) the defendant\n\nwas subjected to chronic neglect, and made aware of sexual abuse that was\n\ninflicted by his stepfather upon his sister (little weight); (j) the defendant expressed\n\nremorse for his crime (little weight); and (k) the defendant exhibited appropriate\n\ncourtroom behavior (little weight).\n\n      Having stricken two of the aggravators, this Court must analyze the two\n\nappropriately found aggravators of HAC and during the commission of a\n\nburglary/pecuniary gain with the nonstatutory mitigators outlined above. We begin\n\n\n                                         - 36 -\n\fthis analysis with the trial court’s weighing of both the aggravators and mitigators.\n\nEach of the aggravators was given great weight. We have in a long line of cases\n\nfound the HAC aggravator to be one of the most serious in our limited list of\n\nstatutory aggravating circumstances. See, e.g., Larkins v. State, 739 So. 2d 90\n\n(Fla. 1999). Significantly, the trial court only gave one of the non-statutory\n\nmitigators “some weight” and the other ten were given “little weight.”\n\nAdditionally, because some of the mitigators were similar, the trial court analyzed\n\nthem together. Namely, the trial court combined the analysis for the defendant’s\n\nproposed mitigator of low IQ with his diagnoses of ADHD. The trial court also\n\ncombined the analysis for the defendant’s proposed mitigators of no adult role\n\nmodels, his mother being emotionally unavailable, the defendant being chronically\n\nneglected, and his sister being molested by his stepfather.\n\n      The defense argues that this case is similar to Davis, 604 So. 2d 794, and\n\nPerry, 522 So. 2d 817, however both are distinguishable from this case. In Davis\n\nthis Court, after striking two aggravators, did not impose a life sentence. Rather\n\nwe remanded the matter to the trial judge for reconsideration of the sentence\n\nbecause we could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial judge\n\nwould have imposed a death sentence in the absence of the two aggravators that\n\nwere stricken. The trial judge ultimately determined that the remaining\n\naggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and reimposed\n\n\n                                        - 37 -\n\fa sentence of death. We affirmed that decision on appeal. The fact that Davis\n\nultimately received a life sentence was not based on the elimination of aggravating\n\ncircumstances but was the result of the granting of postconviction relief on\n\nineffective assistance of counsel regarding racial comments.\n\n      This Court in Perry had to address a situation involving a trial court’s\n\noverride of a jury recommendation of life. In order to uphold the imposition of a\n\ndeath sentence under those circumstances, we must find that no reasonable person\n\ncould differ with the sentence of death. See Tedder v. State, 322 So. 2d 908 (Fla.\n\n1975). While Perry also involved the striking of two aggravating circumstances,\n\nthat factor was not the basis for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nThis Court made it clear that there were mitigating circumstances presented to the\n\njury that the jury could have considered in reaching its determination of a life\n\nsentence. Thus, we said the Tedder standard had not been met, and the case was\n\nremanded for imposition of a life sentence without parole for twenty-five years.\n\n      This case is, however, more similar to Geralds v. State, 674 So. 2d 96 (Fla.\n\n1996), where this Court found the defendant’s death sentence to be proportionate\n\nunder circumstances much like the ones presented here. In Geralds, the jury\n\nunanimously voted for a death sentence, the same aggravators that were applied to\n\nMiddleton were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the trial court gave\n\nminimal weight to the defendant’s mitigation. Geralds was a carpenter who\n\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\fworked remodeling the victim’s trailer. Knowing that the victim’s husband was\n\nout of town, he attacked her, beat her, stabbed her in the neck, and stole various\n\nitems from her home. We struck the CCP and witness elimination aggravators, and\n\nwe remanded for a new penalty phase. On appeal from the subsequent sentencing,\n\nwe again struck the CCP aggravator, but found there was no reasonable likelihood\n\nof a life sentence under the circumstance of that case. 674 So. 2d at 103-105.\n\n      In both this case and Geralds, the juries unanimously recommended a\n\nsentence of death. In both cases the heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and murder\n\nduring the course of a felony/pecuniary gain aggravators were given great weight.\n\nThe mitigators in each case were nonstatutory, with exception of the age mitigator\n\nfound in Geralds, and in each instance they were given little or very little weight.\n\nWe conclude here, as we did in Geralds, that even with the stricken aggravators,\n\nthe trial court would have found that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh\n\nthe mitigating evidence. Therefore, we find that Middleton’s death sentence is\n\nproportional.\n\n  D. ORDER OF PENALTY PHASE WITNESSES AND CONTINUANCE\n\n      Middleton argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion to continue the penalty phase to allow the family to travel to the trial and\n\npresent mitigation testimony prior to the expert testimony. He contends that this\n\nruling prohibited the defense from setting the predicate for the expert testimony\n\n\n                                        - 39 -\n\fthrough the lay witness testimony. The decision of whether to grant a motion for\n\ncontinuance is in the sound discretion of the trial court. In re Gregory, 313 So. 2d\n\n735, 737 (Fla. 1975). This Court has emphasized that it will cautiously review the\n\ntrial court’s decision to deny such a motion and will not reverse the decision unless\n\nthere has been a palpable abuse of this judicial discretion which clearly and\n\naffirmatively appears in the record. Magill v. State, 386 So. 2d 1188, 1189 (Fla.\n\n1980); Cooper v. State, 336 So. 2d 1133, 1138 (Fla. 1976).\n\n      To prevail on his motion for continuance, the defendant was required to\n\nshow: (1) prior due diligence to obtain the witness’s presence; (2) substantially\n\nfavorable testimony would have been forthcoming; (3) the witness was available\n\nand willing to testify; and (4) the denial of the continuance caused material\n\nprejudice. Geralds, 674 So. 2d at 99 (citing United States v. O’Neill, 767 F.2d\n\n780, 784 (11th Cir. 1985)).\n\n      On the requirement of prior due diligence, the defense admitted that it did\n\nnot use the proper subpoena to ensure that the witnesses traveled from Georgia to\n\nprovide testimony on the date scheduled for their testimony. The trial court gave a\n\nfull day in between the guilt and the penalty phase to allow both sides to resolve\n\nany issues with witness availability. Despite this, the defense witnesses were not\n\navailable to testify. In rejecting the defense’s motion for a continuance, the trial\n\ncourt offered the defense an opportunity to allow its investigator to travel to\n\n\n                                        - 40 -\n\fGeorgia to pick up the witnesses and bring them to court or, alternatively, to live\n\nstream their testimony from a facility in Georgia. Had the defense done its due\n\ndiligence, the trial court could have been made aware of the possibility that\n\nMiddleton’s relatives could not travel, and these same arrangements could have\n\nbeen made a day prior, without the need for a continuance.\n\n      As to the second, third and fourth requirements, the denial of the motion did\n\nnot prevent the jury from hearing the testimony of the relatives, and there is no\n\nindication that the defense was materially prejudiced. It only required the jury to\n\nhear this evidence after the expert witness testimony. Additionally, the expert\n\nwitness provided general details about the defendant’s childhood, which were\n\ncorroborated by the relatives’ testimony. Although the defense may have been\n\ninconvenienced by the denial of the motion because it preferred for the relatives to\n\ntestify before the experts, the denial of the continuance did not prevent the jury\n\nfrom hearing the testimony. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying Middleton’s motion for a continuance.\n\n      E. DENIAL OF DEFENSE’S REQUEST FOR A MITIGATION\n                                  SPECIALIST\n      Middleton argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\ndefense funds to appoint a mitigation specialist. The appointment of experts is\n\nwithin the trial court’s discretion. San Martin v. State, 705 So. 2d 1337, 1347 (Fla.\n\n1997). A trial court’s denial of funds to an indigent defendant for appointment of\n\n\n                                        - 41 -\n\fan expert will not be disturbed unless there has been an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\nFlorida appellate courts use a two-part test to evaluate an alleged abuse of\n\ndiscretion: (1) whether the defendant made a particularized showing of need; and\n\n(2) whether the defendant was prejudiced by the court’s denial of the motion\n\nrequesting the expert assistance. Id. If such a request is denied, and not later\n\nrenewed by the party asserting the need, it is waived. Id.\n\n      On October 28, 2010, the parties attended a hearing where the trial court\n\ngranted the defense’s motions to appoint co-counsel and a fact investigator. In\n\nappointing the investigator, the trial court stated that “in a death penalty case with\n\nissues of mitigation, it’s almost self-evident” why the defense would need an\n\ninvestigator. The very next motion that the trial judge heard in that proceeding was\n\nthe defendant’s motion to appoint a mitigation specialist. The State objected to the\n\nmotion, stating that an expert was not needed to do the type of investigations that a\n\nmitigation specialist is expected to do.\n\n      The trial court denied the motion pursuant to Leon Shaffer Golnick Advert.,\n\nInc. v. Cedar, 423 So. 2d 1015 (Fla. 4th DCA 1982), stating that the defense was\n\nasking him to disregard an administrative order from the chief judge of the circuit,\n\nwhich set a maximum hourly rate for specialists on the case, “based on nothing\n\nother than representations of counsel” that the mitigation specialist’s work would\n\nnot be “duplicative of [the investigator just appointed].” The trial court refused to\n\n\n                                           - 42 -\n\fappoint a mitigation specialist because the defense did not demonstrate a\n\nparticularized need or showing for one. Therefore, the trial court denied the\n\nmotion without prejudice, and invited the defense to set a hearing on the motion in\n\nthe future when it could demonstrate a particularized need.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defense’s motion to\n\nappoint a mitigation specialist. The defense counsel did not demonstrate a\n\nparticularized need for the mitigation specialist, in light of being appointed an\n\nexperienced investigator. The defense claims that only the mitigation specialist\n\ncan explain how his or her responsibilities are different from those of a fact\n\ninvestigator. This argument is not persuasive. Although a mitigation specialist can\n\nbest explain his or her capabilities and strategy, the attorney requesting the services\n\nshould at the very least be able to provide the court with an explanation of what the\n\nmitigation specialist is expected to provide that the fact investigator may not.\n\nWithout this explanation, the defense is requesting for the court to provide state\n\nfunds for the defense to conduct what may very well be the gathering of\n\ninformation cumulative to that gathered by the court-appointed fact investigator.\n\n      Middleton’s reliance on Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.S. 68 (1985) is misplaced.\n\nIn Ake, the Supreme Court reversed because the state court did not provide the\n\ndefendant expenses for a psychiatric evaluation to assess his sanity at the time of\n\nthe crime. Id. at 86-87. Importantly, in that case, the defendant was initially\n\n\n                                        - 43 -\n\fdeclared incompetent to stand trial. Id. at 72. Therefore, the Supreme Court\n\ndetermined that the defendant was entitled to a psychiatrist once he made a\n\npreliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense was likely to be a\n\nsignificant factor at trial. Id. In this case, Middleton was evaluated by four\n\ndifferent doctors and was also appointed a fact investigator. Additionally, during\n\nthe hearing on Middleton’s motion to appoint a mitigation specialist, the defense\n\ntold the court that it would come back a few months before the trial to request the\n\nappointment of a mitigation expert, and the court invited the defense to do so. The\n\ndefense never renewed the motion. If at any point the defense could specifically\n\ndemonstrate how a mitigation specialist was imperative to its case, in addition to\n\nthe other previously provided experts, the defense could have set a hearing on the\n\nmotion that had already been filed. Because error has not been demonstrated, we\n\ndeny relief on this claim. Although we find no abuse of discretion in this case, we\n\nnote that it may be appropriate in other cases for a trial court to grant the defense’s\n\nrequest to appoint a mitigation specialist.\n\n           F. INDIVIDUALIZED SENTENCING REQUIREMENT\n\n      Middleton raises numerous claims to support his argument that the trial court\n\ndid not perform the individualized sentencing required for death penalty cases. He\n\nfirst claims the trial court improperly and arbitrarily rejected findings of medical\n\nexperts, and cites Nowitzke v. State, 572 So. 2d 1346 (Fla. 1990), for support. In\n\n\n                                         - 44 -\n\fNowitzke, however, this Court reiterated that it is improper for the prosecution to\n\ndiscredit the insanity defense, as a legal defense, in front of the jury. Id. at 1355.\n\nNo defense of insanity was made in this case, and no argument based on Nowitzke\n\nwas made. Instead the defense argues for a new penalty phase claiming the trial\n\njudge denigrated the field of psychology and rejected the findings of the experts.\n\nThis argument is based on the trial court’s agreement with and citation to the\n\ndissent in United States v. Byers, 740 F.2d 1104 (D.C. Cir. 1984), where the\n\ndissenting judge commented on the imprecision of the science of psychiatry.\n\nNevertheless, the trial court evaluated the testimony of all of the experts who\n\ntestified about the defendant’s mental status and determined that Dr. Leperowski\n\nwas more credible. Relief on this issue is not warranted.\n\n      Middleton additionally claims that the trial court used a strawman argument\n\nto denigrate the defense’s mitigation. See Consalvo, 697 So. 2d at 814-15\n\n(explaining that a strawman argument is one in which the prosecutor creates an\n\nissue not raised by the defense and then proceeds to knock it down). In this case,\n\nthe trial court did not manufacture an argument for the purpose of using the\n\ntestimony regarding Middleton’s psychological state. The defense argued and the\n\ntrial court considered the mitigating factor of substantial impairment. The\n\npsychological data the trial court used to find that Middleton was not impaired was\n\npreviously presented to assess Middleton’s mental state, and the two experts that\n\n\n                                         - 45 -\n\ftestified during the penalty phase were repeatedly questioned about those reports,\n\nand asked to compare their findings to the reports of the non-testifying doctors.\n\nThe trial court considered the entire record of proceedings where Middleton’s\n\npsychological capacity was concerned. This strawman argument has no merit.\n\nSee, e.g., Perez v. State, 919 So. 2d 347, 374 (Fla. 2005) (determining that the trial\n\ncourt was allowed to use in court testimony and an expert’s report, which was\n\nadmitted into evidence during the Spencer hearing, to conclude that the mitigator\n\nof inability to conform conduct to the requirements of the law was not established).\n\n      Middleton next claims that the trial court improperly rejected the mitigator\n\nof impaired capacity. The trial court provided a thorough explanation of why it\n\nwas rejecting the statutory mitigator that defendant’s ability to conform his conduct\n\nto the requirements of the law was substantially impaired.7 The trial court\n\ncompared the testimony of Dr. Barnard, who determined that the defendant was\n\nnot “substantially impaired,” to the testimony of Dr. Leperowski, who stated that\n\nshe saw no evidence that the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder, and\n\nnoted that the defendant made rational decisions on the night of the murder. After\n\n\n\n       7. Middleton also argues trial court should have evaluated the evidence as\nnonstatutory mitigation. It is clear from the trial court’s discussion that\nconsideration was given to substantial impairment, significant impairment, and\nimpairment, and found none had been demonstrated. It should also be noted that\nthe trial court used the mental health and drug use evidence to support other\nnonstatutory mitigation.\n\n\n                                        - 46 -\n\fconsidering the record, the trial court determined that the statutory mitigator did\n\nnot exist. See Walker v. State, 707 So. 2d 300, 318 (Fla. 1997) (contradictory\n\nevidence on mitigating factor supports trial court’s conclusion that factor did not\n\nexist). Relief on this claim is denied.\n\n      Middleton further claims the trial court used the wrong standard in\n\nevaluating his abusive childhood and abused its discretion in assigning weight to\n\nthis mitigation, citing to Mines v. State, 390 So. 2d 332 (Fla. 1980), and Campbell\n\nv. State, 571 So. 2d 415 (Fla. 1990), receded from on other grounds by Trease v.\n\nState, 768 So. 2d 1050 (Fla. 2000), as support. Both Mines and Campbell stand for\n\nthe proposition that once a trial court determines that a defendant is not insane, it\n\nmust still consider the statutory mental health mitigating factors. Mines, 390 So.\n\n2d at 337; Campbell, 571 So. 2d at 418-19. The trial court below did not reject the\n\nstatutory mental mitigators after finding Middleton to be sane, it rejected them\n\nafter a reasoned analysis comparing the findings of the mental health experts who\n\nevaluated him. To the extent that Middleton argues that the trial court erred in\n\nusing the sanity standard to reject the non-statutory mental mitigation and assigned\n\nit improper weight, this Court addressed this issue in Consalvo. In that case, this\n\nCourt found that where the trial court would have likely accorded a mitigating\n\ncircumstance the same amount of weight had it used a different standard, the\n\ndefendants claim should be denied. 697 So. 2d at 818-19. The trial court\n\n\n                                          - 47 -\n\fincorporated its analysis from the order on Middleton’s motion to suppress his\n\nconfession, and additionally referred to Dr. Leperowski’s finding that the\n\ndefendant was thinking rationally on the night of the murder. Therefore, it is not\n\nlikely that a different standard of review would have changed the trial court’s\n\nruling on this issue.\n\n         G. ADMISSION OF MIDDLETON’S CONFESSION VIDEO\n\n      Middleton’s motion to suppress his confession contained three general\n\nallegations: (1) that the defendant’s statements were illegally obtained because the\n\nconsumption of drugs and alcohol caused him to become incompetent to proceed\n\nwith the interview process, invalidating his waiver of his rights; (2) that the\n\ndefendant does not have the intellectual ability to adequately comprehend his\n\nMiranda rights in order to knowingly and intelligently waive them; and (3) that the\n\nfinal interview was conducted after the defendant was represented by counsel and\n\nafter his court-appointed counsel filed his Invocation of Constitutional Rights form\n\nwith the clerk on July 30, 2009, at 11:28 a.m. The trial court in the order on the\n\nmotion specifically addressed each allegation, and denied the motion. Middleton\n\nnow claims that the admission of this evidence into his trial was error, based on the\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 48 -\n\fsame claims raised in his pre-trial motion.8 We conclude that the motion to\n\nsuppress was properly denied.\n\n      A trial court’s decision to deny a motion to suppress comes to this Court\n\ncloaked with a presumption that its factual findings are correct, but we\n\napply a de novo standard of review to legal issues and mixed questions of law and\n\nfact which ultimately determine constitutional issues. Smithers v. State, 826 So.\n\n2d 916, 924-25 (Fla. 2002). When considering the validity of a confession, this\n\nCourt considers the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant’s\n\nconfession. Lukehart v. State, 776 So. 2d 906, 920 (Fla. 2000).\n\n      In Traylor v. State, 596 So. 2d 957 (Fla. 1992), this Court stated that under\n\nthe Florida Constitution,\n\n      if the suspect indicates in any manner that he or she does not want to\n      be interrogated, interrogation must not begin or, if it has already\n      begun, must immediately stop. If the suspect indicates in any manner\n      that he or she wants the help of a lawyer, interrogation must not begin\n      until a lawyer has been appointed and is present or, if it has already\n      begun, must immediately stop until a lawyer is present. Once a\n      suspect has requested the help of a lawyer, no state agent can reinitiate\n      interrogation on any offense throughout the period of custody unless\n      the lawyer is present, although the suspect is free to volunteer a\n      statement to police on his or her own initiative at any time on any\n      subject in the absence of counsel.\n\n       8. Defense counsel raised a standing objection to anything that would\ninvolve the motion to suppress the confession, including but not limited to\ninterviews of the defendant. The jury was provided with an edited transcript that\nhad been approved by both parties to refer to as they watched the interviews.\nJurors were notified that the transcripts were not evidence and would be collected\nonce the video was over.\n\n                                       - 49 -\n\f            A waiver of a suspect’s constitutional rights must be voluntary,\n      knowing, and intelligent, and, where reasonably practical, prudence\n      suggests it should be in writing. . . . any statement obtained in\n      contravention of these guidelines violates the Florida Constitution and\n      may not be used by the State.\n\nId. at 966 (footnotes omitted).\n      A defendant who has “expressed his desire to deal with the police only\n\nthrough counsel, is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made\n\navailable to him, unless the accused has himself initiated further communication,\n\nexchanges, or conversations with the police.” Edwards v. Arizona, 451 U.S. 477,\n\n485 (1981). It does not appear that the trial court abused its discretion in denying\n\nMiddelton’s motion to suppress his confession. The trial court determined that the\n\noffice where the confession occurred was a standard office, and not an\n\ninterrogation room or any other\n\n      particularly threatening or intimidating venue. The defendant did not\n      appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. His speech was\n      clear and coherent. His answers are fairly responsive to the questions\n      asked. He was capable of articulating thoughts, giving directions and\n      describing events. More importantly, the video tape confirms and\n      corroborates fully the testimony of Captain John Rhoden, Lieutenant\n      Brad Stark, Detective Marty Faulkner and Dr. Deborah Leperowski,\n      It is more difficult to reconcile the videotape with the testimony of\n      Drs. James Bernard [sic] and Michael Riordan.\n\nThese findings are supported by the record.\n\n      The trial court also determined that, based on the testimony of Middleton’s\n\nfriend, Britnell, and the officers who encountered Middleton on the night of the\n\n\n                                        - 50 -\n\fmurder, he did not appear to be so influenced by drugs and alcohol as to be\n\nincoherent or not understand that he was waiving his right to remain silent. The\n\ntrial court also observed that of the four psychologists who evaluated Middleton,\n\nDr. Leperowski appeared to have been the most thorough; she reviewed all of the\n\nrecords, gave the most reasonable explanation for the discrepancies between the\n\ndoctors on the issue of Middleton’s capacity to knowingly and voluntarily waive\n\nhis right.\n\n       As to the defendant’s claim regarding the invocation of rights form filed by\n\nthe attorney, the trial court observed that it is clear from the record that\n\nMiddleton’s invocation of rights form had not been executed or served on law\n\nenforcement prior to the defendant’s last interview. The written invocation of\n\nrights was filed in the court file at 11:28 a.m. on July 30, 2009, and served on the\n\nSheriff’s Office that afternoon after the defendant’s last interview, which was\n\nconducted that morning at approximately 9:24 a.m.\n\n       The trial court’s finding that Middleton initiated contact with Detective\n\nFaulkner is also supported by the record. It is clear from the record that Middleton\n\ninitiated the final interview with Detective Faulkner, and understood that he had\n\nthe right to remain silent, and voluntarily chose to waive it. At the beginning of\n\nthe third interview, the defendant was reminded of his Miranda rights. He\n\ncontinued to blame Fowler; he was arrested minutes later. When Detective\n\n\n                                         - 51 -\n\fFaulkner arrived at the Sheriff’s office on July 29, 2009 at approximately 11 a.m.,\n\nhe was notified that Middleton was requesting to speak to him again. The\n\nrecording began at 12:35 p.m. On the recording, Detective Faulkner confirmed\n\nthat Middleton had in fact requested to speak to him and that Middleton had not yet\n\nbeen to first appearance. Detective Faulkner read Middleton his Miranda rights\n\nand Middleton waived his right to remain silent. After initially asking why a\n\ndifferent man was not in jail, Middleton began to ramble about clearing his\n\nconscious and getting his life together. The detectives repeatedly asked him not to\n\nwaste their time. Middleton began to explain the events of the day, including drug\n\nuse. He explained that he and Britnell went to someone’s house and did\n\nOxyContin and smoked methamphetamines. He did not remember what time he\n\nwent to the victim’s trailer, only that it was less than twenty minutes after Fowler\n\nand Britnell went to Walmart. He stated that he knocked on the victim’s door and\n\nthings just went “crazy.” He described the events as “foggy.” When Detective\n\nFaulkner followed up with a question about how long Middleton was at the\n\nvictim’s trailer before the altercation occurred, Middleton stated that he did not\n\nwant to talk anymore and requested to go back to his cell. Detective Faulkner\n\nimmediately states, “All right [sic]. The time is now 12:58 P.M., concluding the\n\ninterview with Dale.”\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 52 -\n\f      Faulkner testified that he went over to the jail the next day, July 30, to check\n\non Middleton because he was so distraught the night before. He stated that upon\n\nseeing him at the jail, Middleton requested to speak to him again. Detective\n\nFaulkner immediately had one of the corrections officers escort Middleton to his\n\noffice. The Sheriff’s Office and the jail are connected, with the distance from\n\nFaulkner’s Office and jail being approximately 50 yards. The jury reviewed the\n\nJuly 30, 2009, recording of Middleton’s interview, along with a transcript. The\n\nvideo begins with Detective Faulkner confirming that it was Middleton who\n\ninitiated the interview. Middleton informs Faulkner during the interview that he\n\nhad been to first appearance that morning, and was told not to talk to anyone.\n\nFaulkner told him that they could not speak unless he specifically decided to speak\n\nwithout his attorney being present. Faulkner repeatedly asked Middleton if he was\n\nsure that he wanted to talk without his attorney present; Middleton responded that\n\nhe did. Faulkner read Middleton his Miranda rights, again. Middleton again\n\nwaived his right to remain silent. Middleton insisted on speaking with Faulkner to\n\nclear his head and get past what happened. Thereafter, Middleton confessed to the\n\nmurder of the victim and the theft of her television.\n\n      When Detective Maerki entered the room, he inquired whether Middleton\n\nhad been to first appearance, to which Middleton replied that he had. He also\n\ninquired whether Middleton had requested to speak to him and Faulkner, to which\n\n\n                                        - 53 -\n\fMiddleton also replied in the affirmative. Throughout the entire interview,\n\nMiddleton repeatedly offered information, stating that he wanted everything to be\n\nover with because the murder that he committed was out of character; he resisted\n\nthe offer to have counsel present, and he agreed to assist in the investigation.\n\n      It is clear from the record that Middleton initiated contact with Detective\n\nFaulkner, rendering his subsequent interview valid under Edwards. Additionally,\n\nthe requirements of Traylor have been met in this case where the detectives\n\nimmediately stopped the interview at Middleton’s request, and only resume their\n\nconversation with him on his prompting. The trial court properly denied the\n\ndefendant’s motion to suppress the videotaped confession.\n\n                    H. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n      Middleton argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal, claiming that the State failed to present sufficient evidence\n\nto support Middleton’s convictions for first-degree premeditated murder and first-\n\ndegree felony murder. After the State rested in the guilt phase, the defense moved\n\nfor a judgment of acquittal, claiming that the State had not proven that the murder\n\nwas premeditated in nature, only a robbery. The State responded by pointing out\n\nthat Middleton stabbed the victim 35 times. The trial court denied the motion\n\nfinding the threshold for submission of the case to the jury had been surpassed\n\nbecause of the totality of the evidence, including DNA evidence, blood splatter\n\n\n                                        - 54 -\n\fevidence, the number of stab wounds, the nature of the wounds, and Middleton’s\n\narming of himself prior to going to the victim’s trailer.\n\n      The defense also moved for a judgment of acquittal as to the burglary count,\n\nclaiming that Middleton was invited into the trailer and that the state did not prove\n\nthat Middleton intended to commit the theft of the television before he entered the\n\ntrailer. The State responded that Middleton indicated the victim told him to leave\n\nand attempted to remove him from the trailer, thus withdrawing any consent to\n\nenter that was initially given. The State also argued that it did not have to prove\n\nintent to commit theft because it could proceed on the theory that the defendant\n\nremained in the home with the intent to commit murder, which he ultimately\n\ncommitted. The trial court denied the motion for acquittal on these grounds. The\n\ndefense then notified the court that, based on the court’s decision on the burglary\n\njudgment of acquittal, the defense had no argument as to the judgment of acquittal\n\non felony murder which was predicated on the burglary. We affirm the denial of\n\nthe defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\n      The evidence in a capital case is judged to be sufficient when it is both\n\ncompetent and substantial. See Phillips v. State, 39 So. 3d 296, 308 (Fla. 2010).\n\nThis Court has an obligation to independently review the record to determine\n\nwhether sufficient evidence exists to support Middleton's convictions. Id. This\n\nCourt must “view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State to determine\n\n\n                                        - 55 -\n\fwhether a rational trier of fact could have found the existence of the elements of\n\nthe crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Rodgers v. State, 948 So. 2d 655, 674 (Fla.\n\n2006) (citing Bradley v. State, 787 So. 2d 732, 738 (Fla. 2001)). Further, “[a]\n\ngeneral guilty verdict rendered by a jury instructed on both first-degree murder\n\nalternatives may be upheld on appeal where the evidence is sufficient to establish\n\neither felony murder or premeditation.” Crain v. State, 894 So. 2d 59, 73 (Fla.\n\n2004).\n\n      The jury was instructed on both premeditated and felony murder, and on a\n\nspecial verdict form listing both felony murder and premeditated murder, the jury\n\nfound him guilty of both.\n\n      Premeditation is defined as more than a mere intent to kill; it is a\n      fully formed conscious purpose to kill. The purpose may be formed\n      a moment before the act but must exist for a sufficient length of time\n      to permit reflection as to the nature of the act to be committed and\n      the probable result of the act.” Premeditation may be inferred from\n      such facts as “the nature of the weapon used, the presence or absence\n      of adequate provocation, previous difficulties between the parties,\n      the manner in which the homicide was committed, and the nature\n      and manner of the wounds inflicted.\n\nHall v. State, 107 So. 3d 262, 281 (Fla. 2012), cert. denied, 134 S. Ct. 203 (2013)\n\n(quoting Bradley, 787 So. 2d at 738) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n\n      Here, sufficient evidence exists to support a conviction for premeditated first\n\ndegree murder and first degree felony murder. The defendant went to his\n\nneighbor’s trailer armed with a knife. When she would not give him money and\n\n\n\n                                        - 56 -\n\fattempted to get him out of her trailer, the defendant attacked her with the knife.\n\nTheir struggle began in the kitchen, and the victim was dragged from the kitchen\n\narea to the bedroom. The blood stains indicated that the victim was viciously cut\n\nagain in the bedroom. A bruise on the victim’s cheek was consistent with the tread\n\nand design of Middleton’s boots. Some wounds indicated that she was trying to\n\nget away and defend herself. There was sufficient evidence that the defendant\n\ncommitted the homicide with a premeditated design to effect the death of Mrs.\n\nChristensen. See Hall, 107 So. 3d at 281.\n\n      There is also sufficient evidence of felony murder. In Bradley v. State, 33\n\nSo. 3d 664 (Fla. 2010), this Court determined that a conviction for felony murder\n\nwill stand where the State can show that, even if the defendant was invited into the\n\nhome by an occupant, the consent was expressly revoked prior to the defendant’s\n\nopportunity to begin the attack on the victim. Id. at 683. In this case, Middleton\n\nexplained that he and Fowler had been discussing the crime for a few days because\n\nthey were experiencing “hard times.” Middleton asked the victim to loan him\n\nmoney, but she said she did not have any money because she paid the bills. He\n\nstated the victim got scared and tried to push him out of her trailer. Middleton\n\npulled out the knife he brought with him, and the attack ensued. Thereafter,\n\nMiddleton took the victim’s television, which he later sold for $200. Under these\n\nfacts, even if the victim invited Middleton into her kitchen, as he claimed, that\n\n\n                                        - 57 -\n\fconsent was clearly revoked when the victim attempted to get Middleton out of her\n\nhome and when she struggled with him down the hallway before he ultimately cut\n\nher throat in the bedroom.\n\n           I. SECTION 921.141(5)(i), FLORIDA STATUTES (2009)\n\n      Middleton claims that the CCP aggravator is unconstitutionally vague and\n\noverbroad, is incapable of a constitutionally narrow construction and has been and\n\nis being applied in an arbitrary and inconsistent manner. He also claims that the\n\nstandard jury instruction administered in this case did not require that the State\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt an intent to kill before the crime began, and is\n\ntherefore unconstitutional. We deny relief as this Court has on numerous\n\noccasions upheld the constitutionality of this aggravating factor and the standard\n\njury instruction against similar claims. See, e.g., McWatters v. State, 36 So. 3d\n\n613, 643 (Fla. 2010); Donaldson v. State, 722 So. 2d 177 (Fla. 1998); Hunter v.\n\nState, 660 So. 2d 244 (Fla. 1995).\n\n                             J. JURY INSTRUCTIONS\n\n      Middleton claims that the jury instruction stating that the jury must only\n\nconsider mitigation after it is “reasonably convinced” of its existence is improper.\n\nMore specifically, he claims that it violates separation of powers for the judiciary\n\nto place a limitation on the consideration of mitigation that the legislature has not\n\nspecifically placed in the statute. We deny relief because these specific challenges\n\n\n                                        - 58 -\n\fhave been raised and rejected by this Court in a number of cases. See, e.g., Salazar\n\nv. State, 991 So. 2d 364 (Fla. 2008); Johnson v. State, 969 So. 2d 938 (Fla. 2007);\n\nBogle v. State, 655 So. 2d 1103 (Fla. 1995); Walls v. State, 641 So. 2d 381 (Fla.\n\n1994).\n\n                              K. RING V. ARIZONA\n\n      Middleton seeks relief pursuant to Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002),\n\nwhere the United States Supreme Court held the Arizona capital sentencing statute\n\nunconstitutional “to the extent that it allows a sentencing judge, sitting without a\n\njury, to find an aggravating circumstance necessary for imposition of the death\n\npenalty.” Id. at 585. This Court has consistently rejected constitutional challenges\n\nunder Ring to Florida’s capital sentencing law, section 921.141, Florida Statutes.\n\nSee Bottoson v. Moore, 833 So. 2d 693 (Fla. 2002); King v. Moore, 831 So. 2d\n\n143 (Fla. 2002). Moreover, this Court has rejected Ring challenges where the trial\n\ncourt has found as an aggravating circumstance that the crime was committed in\n\nthe course of a felony or the defendant has a prior violent felony conviction as both\n\naggravators involve facts that were already submitted to a jury and thus are in\n\ncompliance with Ring. See McGirth v. State, 48 So. 3d 777, 796 (Fla. 2010)\n\n(citing Robinson v. State, 865 So. 2d 1259 (Fla. 2004)); Hudson v. State, 992 So.\n\n2d 96, 117-18 (Fla. 2008). By a unanimous verdict, the jury found Middleton\n\nguilty beyond a reasonable doubt of burglarizing the residence of Roberta\n\n\n                                        - 59 -\n\fChristensen. The “murder in the course of a felony aggravator” found by the trial\n\ncourt rests on separate convictions of robbery and burglary, which satisfies the\n\nSixth Amendment requirements. See Johnson, 969 So. 2d at 961.\n\n          L. SECTION 921.141(5)(d), FLORIDA STATUTES (2009)\n      Middleton argues that the felony murder aggravator is facially\n\nunconstitutional because (1) it does not genuinely narrow the class of persons\n\neligible for the death penalty, and (2) it does not reasonably justify the imposition\n\nof a more severe sentence compared to others found guilty of murder. As support\n\nfor his argument, Middleton cites the decisions of three other state supreme courts\n\nwho have declared this aggravator to be improper, and urges this Court to follow\n\nthose courts, and do the same. We again reject Middleton’s argument on this issue.\n\n      In Mills v. State, 476 So. 2d 172 (Fla. 1985), this Court rejected the\n\nargument that Middleton makes here, stating that “[t]he legislative determination\n\nthat a first-degree murder that occurs in the course of another dangerous felony is\n\nan aggravated capital felony is reasonable.” Id. at 178 (citing State v. Dixon, 283\n\nSo. 2d 1, 9 (Fla. 1973)). See also Blanco v. State, 706 So. 2d 7, 11 (Fla. 1997)\n\n(“Eligibility for this aggravating circumstance is not automatic: The list of\n\nenumerated felonies in the provision defining felony murder is larger than the list\n\nof enumerated felonies in the provision defining the aggravating circumstance of\n\ncommission during the course of an enumerated felony. . . . This scheme thus\n\n\n\n                                        - 60 -\n\fnarrows the class of death-eligible defendants. We find no error.”) (citations\n\nomitted) (footnotes omitted); see also Blanco v. McNeil, 2010 WL 9098788 (S.D.\n\nFla. Dec. 7, 2010) (rejecting Blanco’s unconstitutional felony murder aggravator\n\n(citing Blystone v. Pennsylvania, 494 U.S. 299 (1990))).\n\n                                III. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the reasons stated in this opinion, we affirm Middleton’s conviction for\n\nfirst degree murder and his death sentence.\n\n      It is so ordered.\n\nLABARGA, C.J., and PARIENTE, LEWIS, QUINCE, and PERRY, JJ., concur.\nPARIENTE, J., concurs with an opinion, in which LABARGA, C.J., and PERRY,\nJ., concur.\nCANADY and POLSTON, JJ., concur in result.\n\nNOT FINAL UNTIL TIME EXPIRES TO FILE REHEARING MOTION, AND\nIF FILED, DETERMINED.\n\n PARIENTE, J., concurring.\n\n      I join the Court’s opinion, which affirms Middleton’s conviction and death\n\nsentence. I write separately to emphasize the importance of a mitigation specialist\n\nto the defense team’s investigation and presentation in a capital case and to\n\nencourage trial courts to provide defense counsel the assistance of both a\n\nmitigation specialist and a fact investigator upon a proper and timely request.\n\n      In my view, a trial court should not deny a request for a mitigation specialist\n\neither based on the misconception that these specialists are similar to fact\n\n\n                                        - 61 -\n\finvestigators or based on undue emphasis on an additional expert “costing too\n\nmuch.” It is also important that prosecutors do not add to that misconception by\n\narguing, as the prosecutor did here, that all “a mitigation expert does is synthesiz[e]\n\nspankings and timeouts and things of that nature,” and “you don’t have to be an\n\nexpert” to “go out and find people who can offer mitigation about . . . bumps [the\n\ndefendant] got on the head or spankings he got in school or whatever the case\n\nmight be.”9\n\n      As for the importance of a mitigation specialist, this Court has emphasized\n\nthat “the obligation to investigate and prepare for the penalty portion of a capital\n\ncase cannot be overstated—this is an integral part of a capital case.” State v.\n\nLewis, 838 So. 2d 1102, 1113 (Fla. 2002). The investigation into mitigation can be\n\na monumental undertaking, requiring a significant amount of time that would\n\nideally begin as soon as possible. See American Bar Association (ABA)\n\nGuidelines for the Appointment & Performance of Defense Counsel in Death\n\nPenalty Cases (ABA Guidelines), Commentary to Guideline 1.1, reprinted in 31\n\nHofstra L. Rev. 913, 925 (2003). The difference between a thorough assessment of\n\n\n\n       9. The prosecutor’s sarcastic comments reflect not only a misunderstanding\nof the effect of early childhood traumas on brain development but also highlight\nthe tendency of some prosecutors to degrade mitigation. Cf. Oyola v. State, 158\nSo. 3d 504, 512-13 (Fla. 2015) (rebuking prosecutorial arguments that\ncharacterize a defendant’s mitigating evidence as “excuses,” “make-believe,”\n“flimsy,” or “phantom”).\n\n\n                                        - 62 -\n\fmitigation and a cursory one could, quite literally, be a matter of life and death.\n\nWhen funding is properly requested, the defense team should receive the assistance\n\nof both a fact investigator and a mitigation specialist to ensure a complete and\n\nreliable mitigation investigation.\n\n      There is an “apparent widespread use of mitigation specialists or\n\ncoordinators” in Florida, as the First District Court of Appeal has explained when\n\nquashing a trial court order denying a defendant’s motion for additional mitigation\n\ncoordinator fees. Criminal Specialist Investigations, Inc. v. State, 58 So. 3d 883,\n\n886 (Fla. 1st DCA 2011).10 Cases in this Court demonstrate that the use of a\n\nmitigation specialist in capital cases is not unusual in Florida. See, e.g., Turner v.\n\nState, 37 So. 3d 212, 219 (Fla. 2010) (noting that a mitigation specialist testified in\n\na capital case); Twilegar v. State, 42 So. 3d 177, 203 (Fla. 2010) (noting that the\n\ndefense counsel had enlisted the assistance of a mitigation specialist in a capital\n\ncase); Deparvine v. State, 995 So. 2d 351, 360 (Fla. 2008) (noting that a mitigation\n\nspecialist testified in the penalty phase of a capital case).11\n\n\n\n       10. The issue was before the First District, rather than this Court, because a\nlife sentence was imposed following the penalty phase, and the mitigation\nspecialist was requesting additional compensation for her work in having\nsuccessfully developed mitigation.\n\n       11. Since at least 2011, mitigation specialists have been recognized as a part\nof capital cases, when the General Appropriations Act of 2011 set the maximum\nhourly rate for mitigation specialists at $75. See ch. 2011-69, § 4, at 126, Laws of\nFla; see also § 27.425, Fla. Stat. (indicating that the rate specified annually in the\n\n                                          - 63 -\n\f      The ABA has published guidelines to “set forth a national standard of\n\npractice for the defense of capital cases in order to ensure high quality legal\n\nrepresentation” for defendants facing a possible death penalty. ABA Guidelines,\n\n31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 919. At the hearing on the motion to appoint a mitigation\n\nspecialist in this case, the defense counsel urged the trial court to consider the ABA\n\nGuidelines, by explaining that these Guidelines “include[] a suggestion, if not a\n\nmandatory requirement, that a mitigation specialist . . . should be appointed in\n\ndeath cases because of the nature of the crime and because of the serious nature of\n\nthe potential penalty.” The prosecutor’s misguided response was, “I could care\n\nless about what they [the ABA] think about the death penalty and how it operates\n\nin the State of Florida.”\n\n      Contrary to the opinion of the prosecutor in this case, the ABA Guidelines\n\ndo have relevance to capital cases, even if these guidelines are not binding in\n\ndetermining whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The United States\n\nSupreme Court has referred to the various renditions of these guidelines as “guides\n\nto determining what is reasonable” for an attorney’s performance, or as reflecting\n\n“well-defined norms” for attorney conduct. Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 387\n\n& n.7 (2005); Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 524 (2003). This Court has also\n\n\n\nGeneral Appropriations Act is the maximum compensation rate in cases in which\nthe court has appointed private counsel or declared a person indigent for costs).\n\n\n                                        - 64 -\n\frelied upon these guidelines in determining whether trial counsel has adequately\n\ninvestigated mitigation evidence. See, e.g., Parker v. State, 3 So. 3d 974, 984-85\n\n(Fla. 2009) (citing the ABA Guidelines in a postconviction appeal to determine\n\nthat trial counsel’s performance as to investigating and presenting mitigation\n\nevidence was deficient); Blackwood v. State, 946 So. 2d 960, 974 (Fla. 2006)\n\n(citing the Supreme Court’s reliance on the ABA Guidelines in Wiggins in\n\ndetermining that trial counsel unreasonably failed to attempt to present mental\n\nhealth mitigation evidence, and concluding that there was competent, substantial\n\nevidence to support the trial court’s finding of deficient performance).\n\n      A mitigation specialist is “an indispensable member of the defense team\n\nthroughout all capital proceedings[,] . . . possess[ing] clinical and information-\n\ngathering skills and training that most lawyers simply do not have.” ABA\n\nGuidelines, Commentary to Guideline 4.1, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 959. Not only do\n\nmitigation specialists have honed skills in gathering and understanding the nature\n\nof potential mitigation evidence, such as the significance of early childhood\n\ntrauma, but mitigation specialists—unlike the defendant’s lawyer—can testify in\n\nthe penalty phase to impart the results of their mitigation investigation to the jury\n\nthat must weigh the mitigation and aggravation in determining whether to\n\nrecommend the death sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 65 -\n\f      As opposed to fact investigators, mitigation specialists “are generally trained\n\nin the social sciences, with college degrees in social work or psychology,” and “are\n\nadept at gathering institutional records, interviewing lay and professional people,\n\nand compiling case histories.” Hon. Helen G. Berrigan, The Indispensable Role of\n\nthe Mitigation Specialist in a Capital Case: A View From the Federal Bench, 36\n\nHofstra L. Rev. 819, 827-28 (2008). “Significantly, they are trained in uncovering\n\nfamily trauma and screening for often subtle mental and psychological disorders,”\n\nand are “experienced in interpersonal communication so they know how to develop\n\ntrust and rapport with even the most difficult or distrustful of individuals.” Id. at\n\n828 (footnote omitted). Part of the mitigation specialist’s job is to “conduct a\n\ncomprehensive life history investigation of the client and identify all relevant\n\nmitigation issues.” Richard G. Dudley Jr. & Pamela Blume Leonard, Getting It\n\nRight: Life History Investigation as the Foundation for a Reliable Mental Health\n\nAssessment, 36 Hofstra L. Rev. 963, 966 (2008) (footnote omitted).\n\n      A mitigation specialist has the potential to benefit a criminal defendant in a\n\ncapital case in a wide variety of ways, as summarized by the commentary to\n\nGuideline 4.1 of the ABA Guidelines:\n\n      They have the time and the ability to elicit sensitive, embarrassing and\n      often humiliating evidence (e.g., family sexual abuse) that the\n      defendant may have never disclosed. They have the clinical skills to\n      recognize such things as congenital, mental or neurological\n      conditions, to understand how these conditions may have affected the\n      defendant’s development and behavior, and to identify the most\n\n                                         - 66 -\n\f      appropriate experts to examine the defendant or testify on his behalf.\n      Moreover, they may be critical to assuring that the client obtains\n      therapeutic services that render him cognitively and emotionally\n      competent to make sound decisions concerning his case.\n      . . . The mitigation specialist compiles a comprehensive and well-\n      documented psycho-social history of the client based on an exhaustive\n      investigation; analyzes the significance of the information in terms of\n      impact on development, including effect on personality and behavior;\n      finds mitigating themes in the client’s life history; identifies the need\n      for expert assistance; assists in locating appropriate experts; provides\n      social history information to experts to enable them to conduct\n      competent and reliable evaluations; and works with the defense team\n      and experts to develop a comprehensive and cohesive case in\n      mitigation.\n             The mitigation specialist often plays an important role as well\n      in maintaining close contact with the client and his family while the\n      case is pending. The rapport developed in this process can be the key\n      to persuading a client to accept a plea to a sentence less than death.\n\nABA Guidelines, Commentary to Guideline 4.1, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 959-60\n\n(footnotes omitted); see also ABA Supplementary Guidelines for the Mitigation\n\nFunction of Defense Teams in Death Penalty Cases (2008), reprinted in 36 Hofstra\n\nL. Rev. 677, 682 (2008) (explaining that mitigation specialists are skilled\n\ninterviewers who can identify and locate relevant persons, recognize and elicit\n\ninformation related to mental health, establish a rapport with witnesses, and\n\n“advise counsel on the appropriate mental health and other expert assistance”).\n\n      The importance of appointing a mitigation specialist becomes all the more\n\nevident in a case involving an indigent defendant, where the trial court appoints\n\nprivate counsel, who generally does not have the same institutional resources as the\n\nPublic Defender’s Office. In such cases, the trial judge effectively decides “what\n\n                                        - 67 -\n\ffinancial assistance, investigators, or experts the defense will be allowed.”\n\nBerrigan, 36 Hofstra L. Rev. at 823. “By controlling the purse strings, the trial\n\njudge effectively controls the quantity and quality of information that will flow to\n\nthe jury if a penalty phase is necessary.” Id. As the Eleventh Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals has stated, “[p]ermitting an indigent capital defendant to introduce\n\nmitigating evidence has little meaning if the funds necessary for compiling the\n\nevidence [are] unavailable.” Westbrook v. Zant, 704 F.2d 1487, 1496 (11th Cir.\n\n1983), overruled on other grounds by Peek v. Kemp, 784 F.2d 1479, 1494 (11th\n\nCir. 1986).\n\n      Accordingly, given the importance of a mitigation specialist to the defense’s\n\npresentation in a capital case, I strongly encourage trial courts to liberally grant\n\nproper requests for mitigation specialists. Nevertheless, I would not find reversible\n\nerror in this case because the defense lawyer expressly stated that he would renew\n\nhis request for a mitigation specialist, but he did not do so. Further, in this direct\n\nappeal, Middleton is unable to show how he was prejudiced. I therefore concur in\n\nthe affirmance of the conviction and death sentence.\n\nLABARGA, C.J., and PERRY, J., concur.\n\nAn Appeal from the Circuit Court in and for Okeechobee County,\n     Robert Eugene Belanger, Judge - Case No. 472009CF000448CFAXMX\n\nCarol Stafford Haughwout, Public Defender, and Jeffrey L.

STATEMENT OF THE CASE & FACTS\n\n      Roberta Christensen and her husband of thirty-one years lived in a trailer\n\nacross the street from Middleton. On July 1, 2009, Mr. Christensen went to New\n\nJersey to visit one of the couple’s sons. Prior to his departure, the couple bought\n\nmobile phones that allowed them to use a walkie-talkie feature to communicate\n\nwhile they were apart.\n\n      Middleton lived in a trailer with Garrett Wade Fowler, Kenneth Wade\n\nSullivan and Sullivan’s girlfriend, Haleigh Zinker. On occasion, Middleton would\n\nvisit the victim at her home and would sometimes borrow money and cigarettes\n\nfrom her. On the morning of July 27, 2009, Middleton went over to the victim’s\n\ntrailer while she was preparing to go to the bank. After he left, she realized that\n\nshe had left approximately $400 in tip money out, and suspected that Middleton\n\nhad seen it. She deposited the money into the bank that afternoon. When the\n\nvictim returned from the bank she noticed that someone had attempted to remove\n\nthe screen from the window by her front door.\n\n      On the morning of July 28, 2009, Middleton rode around with his\n\ngirlfriend’s roommate, Steve Britnell, looking for drugs. The two eventually found\n\nmethamphetamine around twelve or one o’clock that afternoon. They returned to\n\n                                         -2-\n\fMiddleton’s trailer and shared the methamphetamine. During that time, Fowler\n\nand his girlfriend were also at the trailer. At approximately 4:30 p.m., Fowler and\n\nBritnell decided to go to Walmart to “boost.” Middleton declined to go, stating\n\nthat he had business to take care of, that someone owed him some money, and that\n\nhe needed to take a shower.\n\n      While Britnell and Fowler were gone, Middleton took a knife from the sink\n\nof his trailer and went to the victim’s home. While in the victim’s kitchen, he\n\nasked her for money. When she refused and attempted to push him out of the\n\ntrailer, he attacked her with the knife. Christensen was alive and moving\n\nerratically as she was dragged from the kitchen area to the bedroom. Once in the\n\nbedroom, Middleton cut Christensen’s throat. Before leaving her home, Middleton\n\nstole her flat screen television and power cord, and carried the television across the\n\nstreet to his trailer. There, he washed his hands in the kitchen sink and changed his\n\nclothes, but kept his boots on. He placed the bloody clothes in a bag with the\n\nmurder weapon.\n\n      When Fowler and Britnell returned to Middleton’s trailer, Middleton was\n\nthere with Chris Jenkins, Sullivan, and Sullivan’s girlfriend. There was a flat\n\nscreen television in the kitchen covered by a blanket. By this time, Middleton had\n\nshowered. His hair was still wet. He stated that the person who owed him money\n\nhad given him the television as payment.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f      After Jenkins and Sullivan left, Fowler noticed that Middleton had a red\n\nsubstance on his boots. Middleton claimed the substance was deposited when he\n\nremoved something from the dumpster. Later, Britnell and Middleton drove in\n\nBritnell’s black Pontiac to two different pawn shops, trying to sell the victim’s\n\ntelevision. Both pawn shops were closed. They began making phone calls to find\n\nsomeone who wanted to purchase the television.\n\n      At approximately 5:30 p.m., Middleton called Jenkins and asked him to\n\nbring drugs to Middleton’s home. When Jenkins arrived, Middleton asked Jenkins\n\nto help him sell the television. After Jenkins took a photo of the television, he and\n\nMiddleton went into the bedroom where Middleton crushed and consumed two\n\nRoxicodone pills. Middleton saved one pill for later.\n\n      The victim’s husband had last spoken to her on July 28, 2009, around 2:50\n\np.m. He watched a movie and fell asleep from approximately 4:00 p.m. to 6:40\n\np.m. When he woke up he was surprised that his wife had not called; he repeatedly\n\nattempted to contact her on the walkie-talkie phone, to no avail. He also left a\n\nmessage on their home phone’s voicemail. He then called the couple’s other son\n\nwho lived nearby and asked him to check on Christensen.\n\n      When the Christensens’ son and daughter-in-law arrived at his parents’\n\nhome, he noticed his mother’s car parked in its usual spot. The trailer door was\n\nunlocked, and upon entering the kitchen, he saw a large puddle of blood on the\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fkitchen floor. Next to the blood he saw a yellow broom with a sharp edge. He\n\nfollowed a path of blood to a closed bedroom door. He opened the door to find his\n\nmother’s dead body on the floor. He heard his father on the walkie-talkie calling\n\nout for him and his mother. He went outside to call the police and stop his wife\n\nfrom entering the trailer. While on the phone with the 911 dispatcher, he went\n\nback into the trailer to confirm that his mother was not breathing.\n\n      Randy Ammons helped Middleton sell the television to his brother, Rolland\n\nAmmons. When Middleton went to Randy Ammons’ house, he said that he had\n\njust taken a shower and did not want the dog to jump on him. A little after 7 p.m.,\n\nMiddleton, in a vehicle driven by Fowler, followed Randy Ammons to Ronnie\n\nAmmons’ house to sell the television. Fowler stayed outside by his car while\n\nMiddleton took the television, covered with a blanket, inside and sold it to Rolland\n\nAmmons for $200. At some point earlier, while riding around trying to sell the\n\ntelevision, Middleton placed the bag with the bloody clothes and the murder\n\nweapon inside of a dumpster.\n\n      After selling the television, Middleton rode with Britnell to a gas station\n\nwhere Middleton purchased cocaine from someone in a truck and consumed some\n\nof the drugs in the car. Soon thereafter, the serpentine belt on the car broke and\n\nBritnell drove to a relative’s house to have it fixed. While the car was being fixed,\n\nMiddleton walked a few hundred yards to a local bar, Brewskis. Middleton called\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fBritnell to pick him up once the car was fixed. When Middleton got into the car,\n\nhe was upset and crying while on the phone with his girlfriend and said, “I’m\n\nsorry.” Britnell drove them back to the trailer park where Middleton lived. When\n\nthey arrived, there were police cars in the area. Not wanting to get too close to the\n\npolice officers, the two turned off at someone else’s house, where they got out of\n\nthe car and stood in the yard.\n\n      Later that evening, officers found Middleton at the residence of Darrell\n\nDubel. When the officers arrived, Britnell’s car was there. At this time, Middleton\n\nwas barefoot, and had placed his boots and socks in Britnell’s trunk. Officer John\n\nRhoden asked Brandon Jenkins, Britnell, and Middleton to come to the Sheriff’s\n\nOffice for questioning. Middleton’s boots were later recovered from the trunk and\n\nfound to have the victim’s blood on them. While in custody, Middleton confessed.\n\nThe bloody clothes and the murder weapon were never discovered.\n\n                       A. MIDDLETON’S CONFESSION\n\n      During the trial, the State played Middleton’s interview videos for the jury,\n\nincluding the fifth and final video in which Middleton ultimately confessed to the\n\nmurder. Detective Faulkner and Assistant State Attorney Ashley Albright were\n\npresent during Detective Maerki’s questioning of Middleton. The recording of the\n\nfirst interview, which was conducted in Detective Maerki’s office, could not\n\nsubsequently be retrieved. As a precautionary measure, the second and third\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\finterviews were conducted using the computer equipment located in Detective\n\nFaulkner’s office. Maerki read Middleton his rights, as detailed on a Miranda2\n\ncard. Maerki detected an odor of alcohol on Middleton, and also noticed that his\n\neyes were bloodshot and watery. He was surprised that Middleton did not have\n\nslurred speech and that his coordination was fine. He stated that Middleton\n\nseemed to be fully aware of everything that was happening during the\n\ninterrogation.\n\n      Middleton told Maerki that everything happened so fast that he never\n\nchecked to see if the victim had any money. He stated that he thought the victim\n\nended up in the hallway, and he did not remember cutting her throat. He told\n\nMaerki that after the murder, he did not bathe, and he only washed his hands.\n\nMiddleton admitted that he acted alone. He told the police the location of the\n\ndumpster where he threw the bag with his clothes and the murder weapon. He\n\nstated that he kept his boots on and put them in the trunk of Britnell’s small black\n\ncar. He admitted to selling the television later that night to Rolland Ammons for\n\n$200 and using the money to purchase more drugs.\n\n                          B. FORENSIC TESTIMONY\n\n      Crime Scene Technician Jackie Moore assisted Detective Bradley at the\n\ncrime scene. She testified that there was no evidence of a struggle in the living\n\n\n      2. Miranda v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966).\n\n                                        -7-\n\froom area, but there was a void in the dust on a television stand in the living room\n\nindicating that there was previously a television and remote there. Moore further\n\ntestified that there were bloodstains on the dining room table and chairs that\n\ncontinued toward the master bedroom. Pooling of blood and drag marks were on\n\nthe floor near the refrigerator and the dining room table. The drag marks indicated\n\nthat the victim was alive and moving erratically as she was dragged from the\n\nkitchen area to the bedroom. Blood with drag marks was in the doorway of the\n\nmaster bedroom. The bloodstains on the wall of the bedroom indicated that at\n\nsome point the victim had been standing and had stepped in blood. There were\n\nbloody shoe impressions leading from the master bedroom to the kitchen.\n\n      The victim had a gaping wound in her throat. The medical examiner\n\ntestified that several passes, like a sawing motion with a sharp instrument, created\n\nthe margin of the wound. The blood stains indicated that the victim’s carotid\n\nartery was not cut until she was in the bedroom. Her hands and shirt were\n\nsaturated with blood. Blood also ran down her abdomen and soaked into the\n\nwaistband of her pants. The amount and pattern of blood on the victim’s\n\nwaistband indicates that she may have been sitting up slightly or halfway when she\n\nreceived the neck injury. The victim’s shirt was pulled upwards toward her neck,\n\nwhich is consistent with being dragged.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\f      The laceration to the victim’s throat produced significantly more blood than\n\nwas seen in the blood trail through the kitchen. The victim had a bruise on her\n\ncheek consistent with the tread and design of Middleton’s boots, more bruises and\n\na cut to her face, and puncture and stab wounds on her chest, neck, ear, and arms.\n\nThe bloody shoeprints were well defined closer to the bedroom and became faint\n\nas they continued down the hall. The victim’s son’s shoes were tested and\n\neliminated as the shoes that caused the bloody impressions. Moore testified that\n\nthis indicates that the blood was likely dried by the time the victim’s son found her.\n\nThere were various items located close to the victim’s body, which indicate that\n\nshe was grabbing for things during the struggle. The victim had bloody injuries to\n\nher arms and wrists. She had defensive wounds that indicated that she was trying\n\nto get away from someone who had a knife. None of the injuries to the victim’s\n\nextremities would have killed or incapacitated her. The autopsy revealed that the\n\nneck injury occurred toward the end of the attack. Following the neck injury, the\n\nvictim could have been conscious for ten to twenty seconds, and alive for minutes\n\nafter losing consciousness.\n\n      On the kitchen floor of Middleton’s residence, there was a washed out shoe\n\nimpression that was similar to those found inside the victim’s residence. This print\n\ntested positive for blood, but no DNA profile could be obtained. The medical\n\nexaminer found blood on the sink of the only bathroom in Middleton’s trailer, but\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fno DNA profile could be obtained. There was blood beside the dresser in\n\nMiddleton’s bedroom, but the DNA profile was inconclusive. A different\n\nbloodstain in Middleton’s room matched the victim’s DNA on four of thirteen\n\npoints. The probability that a randomly selected Caucasian person could match the\n\nsame DNA profile at these four locations is one in 41,680.\n\n         Donna Lee and Rolland Ammons’ fingerprints were the only prints found on\n\nthe victim’s television. Middleton’s fingerprints were not found inside the victim’s\n\nresidence. There was no evidence that the trailer had been ransacked or that the\n\nvictim’s things had been rifled through. Moore explained that the vanity in the\n\nvictim’s bedroom had blood spatter on the outside, but not the inside, indicating\n\nthat the door to the cabinet of the vanity was closed during the attack. Inside the\n\ncabinet, there was a purse that appeared to have been thrown in there. There was\n\nevidence of blood spatter on the purse and also blood inside of the purse. The\n\npurse was empty, and there were no fingerprints found on the purse.3\n\n                                C. PENALTY PHASE\n\n         During the penalty phase, the defense presented testimony from Dr. James\n\nD. Barnard, and the State presented testimony from Dr. Deborah Leperowski.4 The\n\n\n         3. During the guilt phase, the defense rested without presenting a case-in-\nchief.\n\n      4. They testified consistently with their respective testimony provided at the\nhearing on Middleton’s pre-trial motion to suppress his confession.\n\n                                          - 10 -\n\fdefense’s court-appointed mitigation investigator, Joe Parish, also testified, as did\n\nMiddleton’s sisters.\n\n                       i. Psychological Witnesses Testimony\n\n      Dr. Barnard assisted the defense in formulating mitigating evidence and\n\nconducted a mental health evaluation of Middleton. His findings indicated that\n\nMiddleton underreported the type of drugs he abused and the frequency of their\n\nuse. Dr. Barnard determined that Middleton began abusing painkillers after being\n\nprescribed the medications following an accidental fall. He also determined that\n\nMiddleton began smoking marijuana between the ages of ten and thirteen. He\n\ndescribed the onset of cocaine use at age twenty-five, ceasing at age thirty.\n\nAdditionally, Middleton told Dr. Barnard that he had used methamphetamine once\n\na year since he was twenty-eight years old. This statement conflicted with his\n\nassertion during his police interview that the day of the murder was the first time\n\nhe had ever used methamphetamine. Dr. Barnard testified that Middleton reported\n\nbriefly being medically treated for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).\n\nDr. Barnard characterized the symptoms of ADHD as difficulty with impulse\n\ncontrol, difficulty regulating behavior to standards or norms, high rate motor\n\nactivity, and difficulty focusing attention.\n\n      Dr. Barnard also found that Middleton was possibly exaggerating his\n\nsymptoms, which may be viewed as a cry for help. Dr. Barnard found it quite\n\n\n                                         - 11 -\n\fsignificant that individuals with Middleton’s personality type are known to have\n\nproblems with repressed anger and hostility. Dr. Barnard testified that such\n\nindividuals are sometimes able to control their anger, but sometimes have outbursts\n\nthat are difficult or impossible for them to control. Equally significant, opined Dr.\n\nBarnard, is that individuals with this personality type have problems responding to\n\nauthority and taking direction, oftentimes accepting little or no responsibility for\n\ntheir behavior. Dr. Barnard concluded that Middleton could not conform his\n\nconduct to the requirements of the law on the day in question, and that his\n\nsubstance abuse on the date of the murder would likely impair anyone’s\n\npsychological controls, even someone who had no difficulty with impulse control.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Barnard admitted that he did not review all of the\n\nrecords in this case, such as the depositions of people close to Middleton, his arrest\n\nand jail records and his confession to the murder. Dr. Barnard conceded that\n\nMiddleton was not mentally retarded. The State questioned Dr. Barnard about the\n\nreport that was conducted by Dr. Landrum in August 2009 which found\n\nMiddleton’s IQ to be 72. Dr. Barnard testified that Middleton informed him that\n\nhe did not give his best effort on the IQ test conducted by Dr. Landrum. When Dr.\n\nBarnard administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-IV (WAIS-IV) test in\n\nSeptember 2011, he determined that Middleton’s full scale IQ was 83. Dr. Barnard\n\ndetermined that Middleton was not malingering during the exam he administered.\n\n\n                                        - 12 -\n\fHe stated that he was aware that Middleton was administered the WAIS-IV test for\n\na third time in this case by Dr. Riordan in March 2012.\n\n      Dr. Riordan’s March 2012, evaluation indicated that Middleton’s IQ score\n\nwas 75. Dr. Barnard would have expected Middleton’s IQ score to be higher, if all\n\nother factors were stable. This lower score could be an indication of various\n\nfactors including Middleton being under the weather or malingering. There were\n\nno indications that Middleton was ever separated from the general population in\n\nprison due to any mental health issues. Dr. Barnard admitted that Middleton slit\n\nhis wrists in a holding cell in an attempt not to be extradited back to a facility in\n\nGeorgia.\n\n      Dr. Deborah Leporowski testified for the State. She stated that in order to\n\nprepare for her testimony, she reviewed Dr. Barnard’s report, previous court\n\ntestimony, and deposition; Dr. Landrum’s report; and Dr. Riordan’s report, prior\n\ncourt testimony, and deposition. She also interviewed Middleton and reviewed the\n\npolice reports in this case and transcripts, witness interviews, letters that Middleton\n\nwrote while he was in jail, and Department of Corrections records. Dr.\n\nLeporowski maintained that Middleton’s IQ scores are illogical with an initial\n\nscore of 72, a score of 83 two years later and then months later receiving a score of\n\n75. Dr. Leporowski opined that a score of 83 is likely Middleton’s actual IQ score.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 13 -\n\fDr. Leporowski diagnosed Middleton with antisocial personality disorder, as did\n\nDr. Barnard.\n\n      Dr. Leporowski determined that Middleton was malingering “or at least\n\nexaggerating” when taking his personality tests. Dr. Leporowski found no history\n\nof mental illness in Middleton’s records or in her interview with him. She rejected\n\nany assertion that Middleton’s capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct\n\nor to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law was substantially\n\nimpaired. She opined that Middleton’s upbringing did not in any way lead him to\n\nbelieve that those actions involving this crime were acceptable or were warranted\n\nin any way based on the victim’s behavior, stating, “Everything he told me about\n\nthat day was logical, made sense, and indicated that he was able to make decisions\n\nand choices.” Dr. Leporowski further noted that Middleton appeared to remember\n\nwhat he did throughout the day, where he did drugs, and the individuals with\n\nwhom he did them. On cross-examination, she stated that Middleton’s jail records\n\nindicated that his detox from drugs while in jail was typical and did not evidence\n\ndrug dependence, but rather suggested that he used them intermittently when he\n\nhad access to them.\n\n                          ii. Family History Testimony\n\n      The trial court appointed Joe Parrish, a licensed private investigator, to assist\n\nthe defense in developing mitigation for the penalty phase. Parrish determined that\n\n\n                                        - 14 -\n\fMiddleton’s mother abused drugs and his older siblings acted as parents to him.\n\nMiddleton expressed to Parrish some depression concerning the death of his father\n\nfigure, a former employer. Parrish found that Middleton was employed at a\n\nwelding company for a period of time and was described by the owner as being a\n\nhard worker and very dependable. Parrish also found that marijuana use at an early\n\nage led Middleton to abuse more dangerous drugs. Parrish spoke with Middleton’s\n\neldest daughter, who lived with her mother and younger sister in the same mobile\n\npark. She explained that in the days leading up to the murder, she noticed that her\n\nfather’s physical appearance had changed and that he was abusing drugs. Parrish\n\nalso described a history of domestic violence between Middleton and his girlfriend,\n\nSabrina Jones.\n\n      Devenna Pearson, one of Middleton’s older sisters, testified on his behalf.\n\nShe described their childhood as physically and emotionally painful. She\n\nexplained that their mother provided for the necessities of life, such as food,\n\nclothing, shelter and basic hygiene through social security benefits which she\n\nreceived following the death of her husband. She explained that she and\n\nMiddleton were never required to go to school. Pearson additionally explained that\n\nshe was sexually molested by her stepfather for approximately three and a half\n\nyears, and that her mother was aware of the abuse but did not stop it. Her older\n\nsister found out and stopped the abuse by cutting their abusive stepfather. She\n\n\n                                        - 15 -\n\frecalled that she was sent away for a few months and Middleton remained in the\n\nhouse with their mother. She described her brother, as she knew him growing up,\n\nas outgoing, fun and someone who always tried to make everyone laugh.\n\n      Dewanna Sprowse, Middleton’s eldest sister, also testified on his behalf.\n\nShe explained that their mother would sell her food stamps for beer and drugs.\n\nSprowse recalled that Middleton did not have clean clothes and fitted shoes, and\n\nthat if she was not home to get her siblings up and ready for school, their mother\n\nwould just tell them to go outside and play. She explained that one of her\n\nstepfathers was physically abusive to her younger siblings, including Middleton.\n\nShe testified that their mother had always placed men before her children and did\n\nnot spend any money on holidays, birthdays, or books. She recalled Middleton\n\nbeing about age twelve or thirteen when he finally quit going to school. She\n\ndescribed Middleton, as she remembered him growing up, as a sweetheart,\n\ntalented, with a good heart.5\n\n       D. MIDDLETON’S PRETRIAL MOTION TO SUPPRESS HIS\n                        CONFESSION\n\n      The defense filed a motion to suppress the defendant’s confession, claiming\n\nthat Middleton was too intoxicated to waive his Miranda rights. The motion\n\n\n\n       5. The trial court held a Spencer hearing on August 24, 2012. See Spencer\nv. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1915842\"><a href=\"/opinion/1915842/spencer-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1961). Neither the State nor the defense presented\nany additional evidence.\n\n                                       - 16 -\n\fadditionally alleged that Middleton does not possess the intellectual ability to\n\ncomprehend his Miranda rights and that Middleton’s final interview was conducted\n\nafter Middleton’s attorney provided the Sheriff’s Office with a form invoking\n\nMiddleton’s constitutional right to remain silent. The hearing on the motion took\n\nplace on April 10, 2012, and June 29, 2012.\n\n                                 i. Lay Witnesses\n\n      During the hearing on the motion to suppress, Jenkins testified for the\n\ndefense. He testified that he is disabled and was prescribed Oxycodone\n\n(Roxicodone) and Xanax, and that he had been selling or giving Middleton his\n\nprescription medications since 2007. On the day of the murder, he went to\n\nMiddleton’s trailer to give him some drugs and to look at the television Middleton\n\nwanted to sell. He gave Middleton three Roxicodone pills. Middleton snorted two\n\nof the pills while Jenkins was there.\n\n      The State called Britnell to testify at the suppression hearing. Consistent\n\nwith his guilt phase testimony, Britnell recalled that he and Middleton each took\n\none Xanax pill on the morning of the murder. He further recalled that in the early\n\nafternoon, the two shared $20 worth of methamphetamine, which Britnell\n\ndescribed as “a little bit.” He indicated that immediately following the sale of the\n\ntelevision, he drove Middleton to a Circle K to purchase cocaine. They each\n\nconsumed “a line or two” of cocaine in the Circle K parking lot. Later, Captain\n\n\n                                        - 17 -\n\fJohn Rhoden and Lieutenant Brad Stark approached them and asked them to come\n\nto the police station to give a statement. They drove to the station voluntarily.\n\n       Captain John Rhoden testified that Middleton had no trouble standing or\n\nkeeping his posture, did not appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol,\n\nhis speech was clear, and he did not appear to have any problems understanding\n\nwhat was being said to him. Lieutenant Stark testified that none of the men\n\nappeared to be off-balance. Nothing indicated that the defendant was under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol. On cross-examination, he stated that it would surprise him to\n\nhear that Middleton had done methamphetamine, cocaine and Xanax during that\n\nday.\n\n       Detective Marty Faulkner testified regarding Middleton’s interviews. The\n\nfirst occurred on July 28, 2009, at 11:56 p.m., in his office, with another detective\n\nand Assistant State Attorney Ashley Albright present. He read the Miranda card\n\nverbatim to Middleton, who signed, dated, and time-stamped the card. Middleton\n\nagreed to speak with detectives, but seemed nervous. He stated that Middleton\n\nappeared to be coherent, and not under the influence of any drugs; Middleton was\n\nresponsive to questions and his memory appeared to be fine. The interview lasted\n\napproximately one hour. Middleton made no admissions during this interview.\n\n       Faulkner interviewed Middleton a second time, again in his office, in the\n\nearly morning hours of July 29, 2009. Middleton made no admissions. The third\n\n\n                                        - 18 -\n\finterview lasted three minutes, and at that time Middleton claimed that Fowler had\n\ncommitted the murder. Middleton was placed under arrest at the end of the third\n\ninterview. When Faulkner returned to work, at approximately 11 a.m., Sergeant\n\nColeman informed him that Middleton wanted to speak with him. Coleman\n\ntestified and corroborated that Middleton made this request and that he relayed the\n\nrequest to Faulkner. This interview lasted for approximately twenty-three minutes\n\nbefore Middleton asked to go back to his cell. The officers then immediately\n\nconcluded the interview and returned Middleton to his cell.\n\n      Faulkner further testified that on July 30, he felt obligated to check on\n\nMiddleton, based on Middleton’s state of mind during the interview conducted the\n\nprevious day. When Faulkner arrived, Middleton was in segregation and standing\n\nat the gate of his cell. Middleton asked to speak to him, and Faulkner had\n\nMiddleton escorted to his office, where the final interview transpired. During this\n\nfinal interview, after repeatedly being advised of his Miranda rights, Middleton\n\nconfessed to murdering Christensen. On cross-examination, Faulkner\n\nacknowledged that he informed Middleton that he would have to waive his right to\n\ncounsel to speak with him. Only after the final (approximately seventh) time\n\nFaulkner told Middleton what he would have to say in order to waive his rights,\n\ndid Middleton in fact waive his rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                          - 19 -\n\f      Assistant Public Defender Stanley Glenn testified that he was initially\n\nappointed to represent Middleton. He stated that on the morning of July 30, 2009,\n\nhe filed an invocation of rights form with the clerk’s office and that afternoon he\n\npersonally delivered it to the Sheriff’s Office front desk, instructing them to give it\n\nto the lead detective investigating Christensen’s death. Glenn first met with\n\nMiddleton the next day and reviewed the form with him. Middleton was very\n\ndepressed at this time. Glenn was concerned that Middleton needed someone to\n\ntalk to and may make incriminating statements. He repeatedly informed Middleton\n\nnot to make any statements without him being present. On cross-examination,\n\nGlenn acknowledged that unbeknownst to him, on July 30, 2009, at 11:28 a.m.,\n\nwhen he filed the invocation of rights form and delivered it to the Sheriff’s Office\n\nthat afternoon, the defendant had already confessed at approximately 9:24 a.m.\n\n                            ii. Psychological Testimony\n\n      Forensic Psychologist Dr. Gregory Landrum testified for the defense at the\n\nsuppression hearing. He testified that he met with Middleton on two occasions in\n\nAugust 2009. He indicated that Middleton was competent to proceed and assist in\n\nhis own defense. He determined that Middleton’s IQ was 72, which is in the\n\nborderline mental retardation range. He additionally determined that Middleton\n\nreads on a fifth-grade level. Dr. Landrum was not asked to do an evaluation\n\nregarding Miranda competency.\n\n\n                                         - 20 -\n\f      On cross examination, Dr. Landrum stated emphatically that Middleton is\n\nnot mentally retarded. Dr. Landrum stated that it is possible that Middleton was\n\nfaking when he was examined by Dr. Riordan, who determined that his IQ was 75,\n\nmonths after being examined by Dr. Barnard, who determined that it was an 83.\n\nAccording to Dr. Landrum, administering the same tests within a year may yield\n\ninaccurate results.\n\n      Dr. James Barnard also testified for the defense. He prepared two reports,\n\none was a psychological evaluation and the other examined Middleton’s\n\ncompetency to waive his Miranda rights. He determined that Middleton’s full\n\nscale IQ was 83. He additionally found that Middleton was not malingering. Dr.\n\nBarnard indicated that Middleton’s chronic use of drugs resulted in an increased\n\ntolerance for the substances and the need for more of the substances to get high.\n\nThis factor and other factors indicate dependence on a substance versus abuse. He\n\nreported Middleton’s statement that drugs make him “go, go, go,” and render him\n\nless able to control his impulses, and that Middleton told him that before he went\n\nto jail he had not slept for two nights. Dr. Barnard opined that Middleton should\n\nhave been placed in a private detox facility when he was arrested. Dr. Barnard\n\ndetermined that at the time of Middleton’s confession, he was likely withdrawing\n\nfrom substances and may have been under the effects of substances at least during\n\nthe time of his initial interrogation.\n\n\n                                         - 21 -\n\f      Dr. Barnard administered an instrument entitled “Dr. Thomas Grisso’s\n\nUnderstanding and Appreciating Miranda Rights.” Dr. Barnard testified that\n\nMiddleton’s total score was 13 out of 30, more than two standard deviations below\n\nthe mean. He testified that, although Middleton could paraphrase portions of\n\nMiranda, he “showed a very significant weakness in terms of his ability to\n\nintelligently apply knowledge of Miranda, to novel situations.” Dr. Barnard stated\n\nthat it was difficult to reconcile his findings during the testing with what he saw on\n\nthe confession video. He explained that there is no correlation between having had\n\nMiranda warnings administered in the past and actually understanding them. He\n\nalso stated that there are no validity scales for Grisso’s Miranda test.\n\n      On cross-examination, Dr. Barnard stated that Middleton made general\n\nremarks indicating that he may have been malingering during the testing with Dr.\n\nLandrum, but he did not specifically mention whether he was referring to the IQ\n\ntest. Dr. Barnard’s testing also indicated that Middleton may have exaggerated\n\nsome of his answers to appear more maladjusted than he actually was on the date\n\nof the testing. Dr. Barnard diagnosed Middleton with anti-social personality\n\ndisorder; he explained that one major tenet of this disorder is that the person has a\n\ntendency to be untruthful.\n\n      Dr. Barnard further testified that, before the Grisso test was administered,\n\nMiddleton stated he had been Mirandized at least five times. However, after the\n\n\n                                         - 22 -\n\fGrisso test, Middleton claimed that he had never been read Miranda rights, despite\n\nhis extensive criminal history. After the Grisso test, Middleton told Dr. Barnard\n\nthat the confession tapes had been altered. Middleton also told the doctor that\n\nmethamphetamines make him think better. Middleton made comments to Dr.\n\nBarnard indicating that the police in Okeechobee violated his rights, which Dr.\n\nBarnard opined indicates that he knew what his rights were.\n\n      On redirect, Dr. Barnard stated that the conditions that Middleton was under\n\nat the time of the interrogation, plus the interrogation procedures themselves, made\n\nit more likely that he would acquiesce to the police. He also opined that Middleton\n\ndid not fully comprehend his Miranda rights when he waived them.\n\n      Dr. Michael Riordan testified for the defense. Dr. Riordan was ordered to\n\nconduct a neuropsychological evaluation on Middleton. Dr. Riordan prepared a\n\nwritten report, which he subsequently modified. He modified his original finding\n\nthat Middleton had brain damage and in the subsequent report he indicated that\n\nMiddleton suffers from a cognitive disorder. He explained that “the cognitive\n\ndisorder was the more appropriate term [for] a neuropsychologist to report.” Dr.\n\nRiordan reviewed the reports prepared by Dr. Barnard. He agreed with Dr.\n\nBarnard’s finding that Middleton was incompetent to waive his Miranda rights at\n\nthe time of his interrogation, based on his borderline intellectual functioning, his\n\ncognitive disorder, and his drug use which would have caused withdrawals at the\n\n\n                                        - 23 -\n\ftime of the interrogation. Dr. Riordan also found that Middleton had\n\npolysubstance dependence disorder. He indicated that Middleton was not\n\nmalingering. Dr. Riordan did not have Middleton perform another Grisso test, and\n\ndid not disagree with Dr. Barnard’s findings.\n\n      Dr. Riordan did not diagnose an antisocial personality disorder. His report\n\nindicated that Middleton had a tendency to exaggerate his problems. Dr. Riordan\n\nhad previously indicated in a February 11, 2012, letter to the defense that\n\nMiddleton was not initially incompetent to waive his Miranda rights, but as the\n\ninterrogation progressed, that he became incompetent to proceed. Dr. Riordan also\n\nwrote a letter to the defense in April 2012, indicating that Middleton’s withdrawals\n\nwould have furthered his incompetence. However, Dr. Riordan did not review jail\n\nrecords to determine whether Middleton was suffering from withdrawal symptoms,\n\nand Middleton did not state that he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms\n\nduring the interrogation. Instead, he told Dr. Riordan that the police harassed him\n\nand tampered with the confession tapes. Dr. Riordan was not aware that Middleton\n\nsigned a Miranda waiver.\n\n      Dr. Deborah Leporowski testified for the State. She testified that she\n\nreviewed Dr. Landrum’s report, along with the deposition reports and in-court\n\ntestimony of Dr. Riordan. She also reviewed Dr. Barnard’s raw data and\n\ndeposition, and she was present for his testimony. Additionally, she reviewed\n\n\n                                        - 24 -\n\fMiddleton’s videotaped confessions, witness statements, drug treatment records,\n\nDepartment of Corrections and jail records, and also interviewed Middleton at the\n\ncounty jail on May 10, 2012. She did not administer the WAIS test because it\n\nalready had been administered three times. She testified that the discrepancy in the\n\nscores may be due to poor motivation or deliberately underperforming on the test\n\nwith Dr. Riordan. Dr. Leporowski reviewed Dr. Riordan’s neuropsychological\n\ntesting, his raw data, and his report, and she determined that Middleton performed\n\nin the average or above average range on most instruments. She opined that “[t]he\n\nonly areas where he demonstrated anything really in an impaired range were\n\ninstruments that I felt could be accounted for by his lack of education.” She\n\nobserved that his scores varied on the memory tests, with delayed recall being in\n\nthe impaired range, stating “[t]hose are essentially the only two areas where there’s\n\nanything that’s not perfectly intact in the overall neuropsychological functioning\n\narea.”\n\n         Dr. Leporowski stated that she would not diagnose the defendant with brain\n\ndamage or a cognitive disorder. She stated there was nothing in the\n\nneuropsychological testing that would indicate that Middleton had trouble\n\ncomprehending the Miranda warnings. Additionally, she said Middleton was\n\ncandid with her about his drug use on the day of the murder, and even told her that\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 25 -\n\fhe used another drug that day, OxyContin, which Britnell did not report. He did\n\nnot have difficulty reporting the information in a logical order.\n\n          In addition to not administering another WAIS-IV test, Dr. Leporowski did\n\nnot administer another Grisso test. She explained that the shortcomings of the\n\nGrisso test are that it was developed for a particular jurisdiction in 1980 and that\n\nthe language for which it tests has not been updated despite the administration of\n\nthe warnings across jurisdictions. Middleton told Dr. Leporowski that he was\n\nthreatened and that the confession tapes had been altered. She concluded that\n\nMiddleton had the capacity to knowingly and intelligently waive his Miranda\n\nrights.\n\n          Dr. Leporowski disagreed with Dr. Riordan’s testimony indicating that\n\nMiddleton was suffering from withdrawals. She opined that withdrawals typically\n\noccur seventy-two hours after consuming drugs and alcohol. She explained that on\n\nhis jail medical records, he is described as cool, cooperative, coherent, and not\n\nagitated. Dr. Leporowski spoke with the jail nurse who indicated that they never\n\nhad to use detox protocols for Middleton and that he did not need any medical\n\nattention at all. She opined that this is indicative of his intermittent use, rather than\n\nhis continuous use of the substances. Dr. Leporowski found that Middleton was\n\nmalingering during her evaluations of him.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 26 -\n\f      On cross-examination, Dr. Leporowski acknowledged that Middleton\n\nreported doing methamphetamine before lunch, followed by eighty milligrams of\n\nOxyContin, then Roxicodone that afternoon at his trailer, and Xanax and cocaine\n\nlater that evening. He also indicated that he walked down to Brewskis and\n\nconsumed a couple of beers and three lines of cocaine.\n\n      The trial court denied the defense’s motion to suppress Middleton’s\n\nconfession.\n\n                                   II. ANALYSIS\n\n                      A. AVOID ARREST AGGRAVATOR\n\n      Middleton first argues that the trial court erred in finding the avoid arrest\n\naggravator. We agree that the record does not support this aggravator as\n\nMiddleton’s sole or dominant motivation for the murder. This Court has\n\nconsistently held that where the victim is not a law enforcement officer, “the State\n\nmust show that the sole or dominant motive for the murder was the elimination of\n\nthe witness” in order to prove this aggravator. See, e.g., Davis v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1702088\"><a href=\"/opinion/1702088/davis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1992); Green v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1696012\"><a href=\"/opinion/1696012/green-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">583</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">647</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1991); Perry v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1625128\"><a href=\"/opinion/1625128/perry-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 817 (Fla. 1988). The trial court’s order on this issue lists eight facts that\n\nsupport this aggravator:\n\n      (1) the defendant personally knew the victim, and went to her home\n      without any type of disguise; (2) the defendant told Garrett Wade\n      Fowler that he was going to rob Roberta Christensen, after seeing a\n      large amount of money inside her home the day before; (3) the\n\n                                         - 27 -\n\f       defendant walked 130 feet to the victim’s home in broad daylight;\n       (4) the defendant knew that the victim was home because he could see\n       her red car from his own home, and the car was parked directly in\n       front of the entrance to her home; (5) the defendant knew that the\n       victim’s husband was out of town and she was home alone; (6) the\n       victim did not pose any physical threat to the defendant; (7) the\n       defendant armed himself with a knife from his residence, before going\n       over to the victim’s home; and (8) the victim was the defendant’s\n       neighbor, who lived almost directly across the street.\n\nIn addition, the trial court indicated that the main object of the criminal endeavor\n\nwas the tip money, not the television. Finally, the trial judge said that if the victim\n\nwas left alive the defendant would have been quickly arrested.\n\n       Notably, only a few of these factors have a direct bearing or support the\n\navoid arrest aggravator (the defendant knew the victim and did not wear a disguise\n\nand the defendant would have been promptly arrested had the victim lived and\n\nidentified him). Many of the other factors listed by the trial court for this\n\naggravator either supported Middleton’s statement that he went to the victim’s\n\nhome to borrow money, or that he went there only intending to rob her, before\n\nthings became “crazy.” This Court has determined that the eighth factor listed is\n\nnot enough to prove this aggravator. See Foster v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1703316\"><a href=\"/opinion/1703316/foster-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">778</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">906</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla.\n\n2000); Consalvo v.

Additionally, the trial\n\ncourt’s determination that Middleton’s primary objective was to obtain the “easily\n\nconcealable tip money,” implies that pecuniary gain was a dominant motive for the\n\nkilling.\n\n\n                                         - 28 -\n\f      In Davis, Green, and Perry, the defendants raised similar issues involving\n\nthe avoid arrest aggravator. In each of these cases, this Court struck the avoid\n\narrest aggravator even though the defendants were acquainted with the victims. In\n\nDavis, the defendant stabbed an elderly female acquaintance inside her home and\n\nstole some of the victim’s belongings before exiting the residence.

Green went home, changed his shirt, grabbed\n\nthe largest butcher knife from his kitchen and went back to his landlord’s house.\n\nWhen he arrived at the house, his landlord let him into the house, but was adamant\n\nabout keeping Green’s check. Green stabbed the husband and wife. Green\n\nreturned the knife to his home and, later that night, hitched a ride from\n\nHillsborough County to St. Petersburg and then to Ft. Lauderdale. Id. at 649. In\n\nPerry, the defendant killed his neighbor during a robbery attempt. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1625128\"><a href=\"/opinion/1625128/perry-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at\n\n819. The fact that the victims could have identified the defendants was not enough\n\nto demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that the sole or dominant motive for the\n\nmurders was witness elimination.\n\n      Although the trial judge correctly stated that the avoid arrest aggravator can\n\nbe supported by circumstantial evidence through inferences from the facts in the\n\nrecord, his reliance on cases such as Jennings v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1105837\"><a href=\"/opinion/1105837/jennings-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">718</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1998),\n\n\n                                        - 29 -\n\fand Riley v.

In Jennings\n\nwe upheld the finding of this aggravator based on the fact that the defendant knew\n\nthe victim, used gloves, and stated that if he ever committed a robbery he would\n\nnot leave any witnesses. Jennings, 718 So. 2d at 150-51. In Riley, we affirmed the\n\nfinding of this aggravator based on the fact that the defendant knew the victim\n\ncoupled with the fact that the victim was “executed after one of the perpetrators\n\nexpressed a concern for subsequent identification.” Riley, 366 So. 2d at 22.\n\n        Although the trial court infers that Middleton killed the victim because he\n\nwould have been arrested quickly if he had left her alive, there are no other facts\n\nthat indicate that this was his sole or dominant reason for killing her, especially in\n\nthe absence of other evidence indicating that Middleton was specifically concerned\n\nabout eliminating the victim as a witness. Therefore, we strike this aggravating\n\ncircumstance.\n\n                             B. CCP AGGRAVATOR\n\n      Middleton next challenges the trial court’s finding of the cold, calculated\n\nand premeditated aggravator (CCP). On appeal, it is this Court’s task to review the\n\nrecord to ensure that the trial court applied the correct rule of law for each\n\naggravating circumstance, and if so, determine whether there is competent\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support the finding. Willacy v. State, 696 So.\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 30 -\n\f2d 695 (Fla. 1997). We agree with Middleton that there was not competent,\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record to support this aggravator.\n\n      In order to establish the CCP aggravator, it is the State’s burden to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt four elements:\n\n       that the killing was the product of cool and calm reflection and not an act\nprompted by emotional frenzy, panic, or a fit of rage (cold); that the defendant had\na careful plan or prearranged design to commit murder before the fatal incident\n(calculated); that the defendant exhibited heightened premeditation (premeditated);\nand that the defendant had no pretense of moral or legal justification.\n\n      Franklin v.

Although Middleton procured a knife prior to entering\n\nthe victim’s residence, there is no evidence that he possessed the weapon for the\n\npurpose of attacking the victim. Rather, Middleton planned to commit a robbery.\n\nIn walking over to the victim’s residence, Middleton did not conceal his identity.\n\nThe evidence suggests that while inside the victim’s residence, the victim refused\n\nMiddleton’s request for money. After a struggle ensued, Middleton fatally stabbed\n\nthe victim. It was during the course of this struggle that Middleton formulated his\n\nintent to kill her. Middleton’s behavior at the time of the murder can be aptly\n\ndescribed as murder committed in a frenzied rage or during a heated struggle\n\nfollowing the victim’s refusal to give him money. Following this spontaneous\n\nmurder—which was not carried out as a matter of course—the victim’s body\n\nremained in her residence; Middleton left her home with the victim’s television.\n\n      Based on this evidence, we conclude that the State did not prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that Middleton had a careful prearranged plan or design to\n\nmurder the victim before he entered her residence. Thus, we disagree with the trial\n\ncourt’s finding that the murder was a planned event, not a sudden, impulsive act.\n\nAlthough following the murder Middleton washed his hands in his kitchen sink,\n\nchanged his clothes, and placed his bloody clothes in a bag with the murder\n\n\n\n\n                                       - 32 -\n\fweapon—as noted by the trial court—these actions do not prove that he planned\n\nthe murder beforehand.\n\n       We conclude that the evidence is not indicative of a heightened,\n\npremeditated intent to murder. The facts in this case are similar to Castro v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1660143\"><a href=\"/opinion/1660143/castro-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991 (Fla. 1994), which did not involve a careful design and\n\nheightened premeditation necessary for CCP when “the record reflect[ed] that\n\nCastro planned to rob Scott.” In addition, in Hansbrough v.

The two aggravators which remain are HAC and during the\n\ncommission of a burglary/pecuniary gain aggravators, which were each given\n\n“great weight” by the trial court. The trial court did not find any statutory\n\nmitigation applicable in this case.\n\n      In its sentencing order, the trial court expressly stated that “any of the\n\nconsidered aggravating circumstances found in this case, standing alone, would be\n\nsufficient to outweigh the mitigation in total presented regarding the murder of\n\n[Roberta Christensen].” Similarly, in Smith v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1595830\"><a href=\"/opinion/1595830/smith-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 868 (Fla.\n\n2009), this Court held that the trial court’s erroneous finding of the CCP\n\naggravator was harmless because the sentencing order provided that “any one of\n\nthe aggravators found (except the felony probation aggravator) was sufficient to\n\noutweigh the mitigating circumstances found in this case and due to the other\n\napplicable aggravating factors.” It is clear that the trial court would have imposed\n\na death sentence for Middleton absent the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators.\n\nBecause we conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the erroneous\n\nfindings of the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators contributed to Middleton’s death\n\nsentence, the errors were harmless.\n\n                            C. PROPORTIONALITY\n\n      Middleton argues that without the avoid arrest and CCP aggravators, his\n\ndeath sentence is disproportionate as compared to cases such as Perry and Davis.\n\n\n                                        - 34 -\n\fAfter striking the two aggravators in this case, we find that the sentence of death is\n\nstill proportional to similar cases.\n\n      In order to ensure uniformity in death penalty proceedings, this Court\n\nundertakes a “comprehensive analysis” of the aggravating and mitigating\n\ncircumstances “to determine whether the case falls within the category of the most\n\naggravated and least mitigated.” See Floyd v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1735100\"><a href=\"/opinion/1735100/floyd-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 578 (Fla.\n\n2005) (quoting Anderson v.

This\n\nanalysis involves a thoughtful and deliberate proportionality review considering\n\nthe totality of circumstances of the case and then comparing it with other capital\n\ncases with similar aggravating and mitigating circumstances. “It is not a\n\ncomparison between the number of aggravating and mitigating circumstances.”\n\nTillman v.

The\n\ntrial court weighed four aggravators against eleven non-statutory mitigators.6 The\n\naggravators found are: (1) the capital felony was committed while the defendant\n\nwas engaged in the commission of a burglary or an attempt to commit a burglary\n\nand the capital felony was committed for pecuniary gain; (2) the capital felony was\n\n\n       6. The trial court determined that the proposed mitigator that Middleton’s\ncapacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to\nthe requirements of the law was substantially impaired, was not proven.\n\n                                        - 35 -\n\fcommitted for the purpose of avoiding or preventing a lawful arrest or effecting\n\nescape from custody; (3) the capital felony was HAC; and (4) the capital felony\n\nwas CCP. The court gave all of these aggravators great weight. The eleven non-\n\nstatutory mitigators found are: (a) the defendant has below-average or borderline\n\nintelligence (little weight); (b) the defendant suffers from attention deficit\n\nhyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (little weight) (c) the defendant has a long history\n\nof chronic substance abuse (some weight); (d) the defendant had no adult role\n\nmodels to guide him as a child (little weight); (e) the defendant’s mother was not\n\ninvolved in child-rearing or supervision and was unavailable emotionally for her\n\nchildren (little weight); (f) the defendant had a steady history of employment until\n\nhis chronic substance abuse and incarcerations made it difficult to maintain such\n\nemployment (little weight); (g) the defendant had little, if any, formal education\n\n(little weight); (h) the defendant has two children (little weight); (i) the defendant\n\nwas subjected to chronic neglect, and made aware of sexual abuse that was\n\ninflicted by his stepfather upon his sister (little weight); (j) the defendant expressed\n\nremorse for his crime (little weight); and (k) the defendant exhibited appropriate\n\ncourtroom behavior (little weight).\n\n      Having stricken two of the aggravators, this Court must analyze the two\n\nappropriately found aggravators of HAC and during the commission of a\n\nburglary/pecuniary gain with the nonstatutory mitigators outlined above. We begin\n\n\n                                         - 36 -\n\fthis analysis with the trial court’s weighing of both the aggravators and mitigators.\n\nEach of the aggravators was given great weight. We have in a long line of cases\n\nfound the HAC aggravator to be one of the most serious in our limited list of\n\nstatutory aggravating circumstances. See, e.g., Larkins v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1707034\"><a href=\"/opinion/1707034/larkins-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Fla. 1999). Significantly, the trial court only gave one of the non-statutory\n\nmitigators “some weight” and the other ten were given “little weight.”\n\nAdditionally, because some of the mitigators were similar, the trial court analyzed\n\nthem together. Namely, the trial court combined the analysis for the defendant’s\n\nproposed mitigator of low IQ with his diagnoses of ADHD. The trial court also\n\ncombined the analysis for the defendant’s proposed mitigators of no adult role\n\nmodels, his mother being emotionally unavailable, the defendant being chronically\n\nneglected, and his sister being molested by his stepfather.\n\n      The defense argues that this case is similar to Davis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1702088\"><a href=\"/opinion/1702088/davis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and\n\nPerry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1625128\"><a href=\"/opinion/1625128/perry-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 817, however both are distinguishable from this case. In Davis\n\nthis Court, after striking two aggravators, did not impose a life sentence. Rather\n\nwe remanded the matter to the trial judge for reconsideration of the sentence\n\nbecause we could not determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the trial judge\n\nwould have imposed a death sentence in the absence of the two aggravators that\n\nwere stricken. The trial judge ultimately determined that the remaining\n\naggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances and reimposed\n\n\n                                        - 37 -\n\fa sentence of death. We affirmed that decision on appeal. The fact that Davis\n\nultimately received a life sentence was not based on the elimination of aggravating\n\ncircumstances but was the result of the granting of postconviction relief on\n\nineffective assistance of counsel regarding racial comments.\n\n      This Court in Perry had to address a situation involving a trial court’s\n\noverride of a jury recommendation of life. In order to uphold the imposition of a\n\ndeath sentence under those circumstances, we must find that no reasonable person\n\ncould differ with the sentence of death. See Tedder v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1850172\"><a href=\"/opinion/1850172/tedder-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">908</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla.\n\n1975). While Perry also involved the striking of two aggravating circumstances,\n\nthat factor was not the basis for the imposition of a sentence of life imprisonment.\n\nThis Court made it clear that there were mitigating circumstances presented to the\n\njury that the jury could have considered in reaching its determination of a life\n\nsentence. Thus, we said the Tedder standard had not been met, and the case was\n\nremanded for imposition of a life sentence without parole for twenty-five years.\n\n      This case is, however, more similar to Geralds v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1628173\"><a href=\"/opinion/1628173/geralds-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">674</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla.\n\n1996), where this Court found the defendant’s death sentence to be proportionate\n\nunder circumstances much like the ones presented here. In Geralds, the jury\n\nunanimously voted for a death sentence, the same aggravators that were applied to\n\nMiddleton were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the trial court gave\n\nminimal weight to the defendant’s mitigation. Geralds was a carpenter who\n\n\n                                        - 38 -\n\fworked remodeling the victim’s trailer. Knowing that the victim’s husband was\n\nout of town, he attacked her, beat her, stabbed her in the neck, and stole various\n\nitems from her home. We struck the CCP and witness elimination aggravators, and\n\nwe remanded for a new penalty phase. On appeal from the subsequent sentencing,\n\nwe again struck the CCP aggravator, but found there was no reasonable likelihood\n\nof a life sentence under the circumstance of that case. 674 So. 2d at 103-105.\n\n      In both this case and Geralds, the juries unanimously recommended a\n\nsentence of death. In both cases the heinous, atrocious, or cruel, and murder\n\nduring the course of a felony/pecuniary gain aggravators were given great weight.\n\nThe mitigators in each case were nonstatutory, with exception of the age mitigator\n\nfound in Geralds, and in each instance they were given little or very little weight.\n\nWe conclude here, as we did in Geralds, that even with the stricken aggravators,\n\nthe trial court would have found that the aggravating factors substantially outweigh\n\nthe mitigating evidence. Therefore, we find that Middleton’s death sentence is\n\nproportional.\n\n  D. ORDER OF PENALTY PHASE WITNESSES AND CONTINUANCE\n\n      Middleton argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his\n\nmotion to continue the penalty phase to allow the family to travel to the trial and\n\npresent mitigation testimony prior to the expert testimony. He contends that this\n\nruling prohibited the defense from setting the predicate for the expert testimony\n\n\n                                        - 39 -\n\fthrough the lay witness testimony. The decision of whether to grant a motion for\n\ncontinuance is in the sound discretion of the trial court. In re Gregory, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1905350\"><a href=\"/opinion/1905350/in-re-gregory/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 737 (Fla. 1975). This Court has emphasized that it will cautiously review the\n\ntrial court’s decision to deny such a motion and will not reverse the decision unless\n\nthere has been a palpable abuse of this judicial discretion which clearly and\n\naffirmatively appears in the record.

Geralds, 674 So. 2d at 99 (citing United States v. O’Neill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454949\"><a href=\"/opinion/454949/united-states-v-william-thomas-oneill-united-states-of-america-v-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 784 (11th Cir. 1985)).\n\n      On the requirement of prior due diligence, the defense admitted that it did\n\nnot use the proper subpoena to ensure that the witnesses traveled from Georgia to\n\nprovide testimony on the date scheduled for their testimony. The trial court gave a\n\nfull day in between the guilt and the penalty phase to allow both sides to resolve\n\nany issues with witness availability. Despite this, the defense witnesses were not\n\navailable to testify. In rejecting the defense’s motion for a continuance, the trial\n\ncourt offered the defense an opportunity to allow its investigator to travel to\n\n\n                                        - 40 -\n\fGeorgia to pick up the witnesses and bring them to court or, alternatively, to live\n\nstream their testimony from a facility in Georgia. Had the defense done its due\n\ndiligence, the trial court could have been made aware of the possibility that\n\nMiddleton’s relatives could not travel, and these same arrangements could have\n\nbeen made a day prior, without the need for a continuance.\n\n      As to the second, third and fourth requirements, the denial of the motion did\n\nnot prevent the jury from hearing the testimony of the relatives, and there is no\n\nindication that the defense was materially prejudiced. It only required the jury to\n\nhear this evidence after the expert witness testimony. Additionally, the expert\n\nwitness provided general details about the defendant’s childhood, which were\n\ncorroborated by the relatives’ testimony. Although the defense may have been\n\ninconvenienced by the denial of the motion because it preferred for the relatives to\n\ntestify before the experts, the denial of the continuance did not prevent the jury\n\nfrom hearing the testimony. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying Middleton’s motion for a continuance.\n\n      E. DENIAL OF DEFENSE’S REQUEST FOR A MITIGATION\n                                  SPECIALIST\n      Middleton argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the\n\ndefense funds to appoint a mitigation specialist. The appointment of experts is\n\nwithin the trial court’s discretion. San Martin v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1913373\"><a href=\"/opinion/1913373/san-martin-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1347 (Fla.\n\n1997). A trial court’s denial of funds to an indigent defendant for appointment of\n\n\n                                        - 41 -\n\fan expert will not be disturbed unless there has been an abuse of discretion. Id.\n\nFlorida appellate courts use a two-part test to evaluate an alleged abuse of\n\ndiscretion: (1) whether the defendant made a particularized showing of need; and\n\n(2) whether the defendant was prejudiced by the court’s denial of the motion\n\nrequesting the expert assistance. Id. If such a request is denied, and not later\n\nrenewed by the party asserting the need, it is waived. Id.\n\n      On October 28, 2010, the parties attended a hearing where the trial court\n\ngranted the defense’s motions to appoint co-counsel and a fact investigator. In\n\nappointing the investigator, the trial court stated that “in a death penalty case with\n\nissues of mitigation, it’s almost self-evident” why the defense would need an\n\ninvestigator. The very next motion that the trial judge heard in that proceeding was\n\nthe defendant’s motion to appoint a mitigation specialist. The State objected to the\n\nmotion, stating that an expert was not needed to do the type of investigations that a\n\nmitigation specialist is expected to do.\n\n      The trial court denied the motion pursuant to Leon Shaffer Golnick Advert.,\n\nInc. v. Cedar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1150852\"><a href=\"/opinion/1150852/leon-shaffer-golnick-advertising-inc-v-cedar/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 4th DCA 1982), stating that the defense was\n\nasking him to disregard an administrative order from the chief judge of the circuit,\n\nwhich set a maximum hourly rate for specialists on the case, “based on nothing\n\nother than representations of counsel” that the mitigation specialist’s work would\n\nnot be “duplicative of [the investigator just appointed].” The trial court refused to\n\n\n                                           - 42 -\n\fappoint a mitigation specialist because the defense did not demonstrate a\n\nparticularized need or showing for one. Therefore, the trial court denied the\n\nmotion without prejudice, and invited the defense to set a hearing on the motion in\n\nthe future when it could demonstrate a particularized need.\n\n      The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defense’s motion to\n\nappoint a mitigation specialist. The defense counsel did not demonstrate a\n\nparticularized need for the mitigation specialist, in light of being appointed an\n\nexperienced investigator. The defense claims that only the mitigation specialist\n\ncan explain how his or her responsibilities are different from those of a fact\n\ninvestigator. This argument is not persuasive. Although a mitigation specialist can\n\nbest explain his or her capabilities and strategy, the attorney requesting the services\n\nshould at the very least be able to provide the court with an explanation of what the\n\nmitigation specialist is expected to provide that the fact investigator may not.\n\nWithout this explanation, the defense is requesting for the court to provide state\n\nfunds for the defense to conduct what may very well be the gathering of\n\ninformation cumulative to that gathered by the court-appointed fact investigator.\n\n      Middleton’s reliance on Ake v. Oklahoma, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111356\"><a href=\"/opinion/111356/ake-v-oklahoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985) is misplaced.\n\nIn Ake, the Supreme Court reversed because the state court did not provide the\n\ndefendant expenses for a psychiatric evaluation to assess his sanity at the time of\n\nthe crime. Id. at 86-87. Importantly, in that case, the defendant was initially\n\n\n                                        - 43 -\n\fdeclared incompetent to stand trial. Id. at 72. Therefore, the Supreme Court\n\ndetermined that the defendant was entitled to a psychiatrist once he made a\n\npreliminary showing that his sanity at the time of the offense was likely to be a\n\nsignificant factor at trial. Id. In this case, Middleton was evaluated by four\n\ndifferent doctors and was also appointed a fact investigator. Additionally, during\n\nthe hearing on Middleton’s motion to appoint a mitigation specialist, the defense\n\ntold the court that it would come back a few months before the trial to request the\n\nappointment of a mitigation expert, and the court invited the defense to do so. The\n\ndefense never renewed the motion. If at any point the defense could specifically\n\ndemonstrate how a mitigation specialist was imperative to its case, in addition to\n\nthe other previously provided experts, the defense could have set a hearing on the\n\nmotion that had already been filed. Because error has not been demonstrated, we\n\ndeny relief on this claim. Although we find no abuse of discretion in this case, we\n\nnote that it may be appropriate in other cases for a trial court to grant the defense’s\n\nrequest to appoint a mitigation specialist.\n\n           F. INDIVIDUALIZED SENTENCING REQUIREMENT\n\n      Middleton raises numerous claims to support his argument that the trial court\n\ndid not perform the individualized sentencing required for death penalty cases. He\n\nfirst claims the trial court improperly and arbitrarily rejected findings of medical\n\nexperts, and cites Nowitzke v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1116737\"><a href=\"/opinion/1116737/nowitzke-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">572</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1346</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1990), for support. In\n\n\n                                         - 44 -\n\fNowitzke, however, this Court reiterated that it is improper for the prosecution to\n\ndiscredit the insanity defense, as a legal defense, in front of the jury. Id. at 1355.\n\nNo defense of insanity was made in this case, and no argument based on Nowitzke\n\nwas made. Instead the defense argues for a new penalty phase claiming the trial\n\njudge denigrated the field of psychology and rejected the findings of the experts.\n\nThis argument is based on the trial court’s agreement with and citation to the\n\ndissent in United States v. Byers, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"439952\"><a href=\"/opinion/439952/united-states-v-billy-g-byers/\"><span class=\"volume\">740</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1104</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D.C. Cir. 1984), where the\n\ndissenting judge commented on the imprecision of the science of psychiatry.\n\nNevertheless, the trial court evaluated the testimony of all of the experts who\n\ntestified about the defendant’s mental status and determined that Dr. Leperowski\n\nwas more credible. Relief on this issue is not warranted.\n\n      Middleton additionally claims that the trial court used a strawman argument\n\nto denigrate the defense’s mitigation. See Consalvo, 697 So. 2d at 814-15\n\n(explaining that a strawman argument is one in which the prosecutor creates an\n\nissue not raised by the defense and then proceeds to knock it down). In this case,\n\nthe trial court did not manufacture an argument for the purpose of using the\n\ntestimony regarding Middleton’s psychological state. The defense argued and the\n\ntrial court considered the mitigating factor of substantial impairment. The\n\npsychological data the trial court used to find that Middleton was not impaired was\n\npreviously presented to assess Middleton’s mental state, and the two experts that\n\n\n                                         - 45 -\n\ftestified during the penalty phase were repeatedly questioned about those reports,\n\nand asked to compare their findings to the reports of the non-testifying doctors.\n\nThe trial court considered the entire record of proceedings where Middleton’s\n\npsychological capacity was concerned. This strawman argument has no merit.\n\nSee, e.g., Perez v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">919</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 374 (Fla. 2005) (determining that the trial\n\ncourt was allowed to use in court testimony and an expert’s report, which was\n\nadmitted into evidence during the Spencer hearing, to conclude that the mitigator\n\nof inability to conform conduct to the requirements of the law was not established).\n\n      Middleton next claims that the trial court improperly rejected the mitigator\n\nof impaired capacity. The trial court provided a thorough explanation of why it\n\nwas rejecting the statutory mitigator that defendant’s ability to conform his conduct\n\nto the requirements of the law was substantially impaired.7 The trial court\n\ncompared the testimony of Dr. Barnard, who determined that the defendant was\n\nnot “substantially impaired,” to the testimony of Dr. Leperowski, who stated that\n\nshe saw no evidence that the defendant was suffering from a mental disorder, and\n\nnoted that the defendant made rational decisions on the night of the murder. After\n\n\n\n       7. Middleton also argues trial court should have evaluated the evidence as\nnonstatutory mitigation. It is clear from the trial court’s discussion that\nconsideration was given to substantial impairment, significant impairment, and\nimpairment, and found none had been demonstrated. It should also be noted that\nthe trial court used the mental health and drug use evidence to support other\nnonstatutory mitigation.\n\n\n                                        - 46 -\n\fconsidering the record, the trial court determined that the statutory mitigator did\n\nnot exist. See Walker v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1672000\"><a href=\"/opinion/1672000/walker-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">707</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 318 (Fla. 1997) (contradictory\n\nevidence on mitigating factor supports trial court’s conclusion that factor did not\n\nexist). Relief on this claim is denied.\n\n      Middleton further claims the trial court used the wrong standard in\n\nevaluating his abusive childhood and abused its discretion in assigning weight to\n\nthis mitigation, citing to Mines v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1902559\"><a href=\"/opinion/1902559/mines-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">332</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1980), and Campbell\n\nv.

Both Mines and Campbell stand for\n\nthe proposition that once a trial court determines that a defendant is not insane, it\n\nmust still consider the statutory mental health mitigating factors. Mines, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 337; Campbell, 571 So. 2d at 418-19. The trial court below did not reject the\n\nstatutory mental mitigators after finding Middleton to be sane, it rejected them\n\nafter a reasoned analysis comparing the findings of the mental health experts who\n\nevaluated him. To the extent that Middleton argues that the trial court erred in\n\nusing the sanity standard to reject the non-statutory mental mitigation and assigned\n\nit improper weight, this Court addressed this issue in Consalvo. In that case, this\n\nCourt found that where the trial court would have likely accorded a mitigating\n\ncircumstance the same amount of weight had it used a different standard, the\n\ndefendants claim should be denied. 697 So. 2d at 818-19. The trial court\n\n\n                                          - 47 -\n\fincorporated its analysis from the order on Middleton’s motion to suppress his\n\nconfession, and additionally referred to Dr. Leperowski’s finding that the\n\ndefendant was thinking rationally on the night of the murder. Therefore, it is not\n\nlikely that a different standard of review would have changed the trial court’s\n\nruling on this issue.\n\n         G. ADMISSION OF MIDDLETON’S CONFESSION VIDEO\n\n      Middleton’s motion to suppress his confession contained three general\n\nallegations: (1) that the defendant’s statements were illegally obtained because the\n\nconsumption of drugs and alcohol caused him to become incompetent to proceed\n\nwith the interview process, invalidating his waiver of his rights; (2) that the\n\ndefendant does not have the intellectual ability to adequately comprehend his\n\nMiranda rights in order to knowingly and intelligently waive them; and (3) that the\n\nfinal interview was conducted after the defendant was represented by counsel and\n\nafter his court-appointed counsel filed his Invocation of Constitutional Rights form\n\nwith the clerk on July 30, 2009, at 11:28 a.m. The trial court in the order on the\n\nmotion specifically addressed each allegation, and denied the motion. Middleton\n\nnow claims that the admission of this evidence into his trial was error, based on the\n\n\n\n\n                                         - 48 -\n\fsame claims raised in his pre-trial motion.8 We conclude that the motion to\n\nsuppress was properly denied.\n\n      A trial court’s decision to deny a motion to suppress comes to this Court\n\ncloaked with a presumption that its factual findings are correct, but we\n\napply a de novo standard of review to legal issues and mixed questions of law and\n\nfact which ultimately determine constitutional issues. Smithers v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1630282\"><a href=\"/opinion/1630282/smithers-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 916, 924-25 (Fla. 2002).

State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1765408\"><a href=\"/opinion/1765408/traylor-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">596</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">957</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Fla. 1992), this Court stated that under\n\nthe Florida Constitution,\n\n      if the suspect indicates in any manner that he or she does not want to\n      be interrogated, interrogation must not begin or, if it has already\n      begun, must immediately stop. If the suspect indicates in any manner\n      that he or she wants the help of a lawyer, interrogation must not begin\n      until a lawyer has been appointed and is present or, if it has already\n      begun, must immediately stop until a lawyer is present. Once a\n      suspect has requested the help of a lawyer, no state agent can reinitiate\n      interrogation on any offense throughout the period of custody unless\n      the lawyer is present, although the suspect is free to volunteer a\n      statement to police on his or her own initiative at any time on any\n      subject in the absence of counsel.\n\n       8. Defense counsel raised a standing objection to anything that would\ninvolve the motion to suppress the confession, including but not limited to\ninterviews of the defendant. The jury was provided with an edited transcript that\nhad been approved by both parties to refer to as they watched the interviews.\nJurors were notified that the transcripts were not evidence and would be collected\nonce the video was over.\n\n                                       - 49 -\n\f            A waiver of a suspect’s constitutional rights must be voluntary,\n      knowing, and intelligent, and, where reasonably practical, prudence\n      suggests it should be in writing. . . . any statement obtained in\n      contravention of these guidelines violates the Florida Constitution and\n      may not be used by the State.\n\nId. at 966 (footnotes omitted).\n      A defendant who has “expressed his desire to deal with the police only\n\nthrough counsel, is not subject to further interrogation until counsel has been made\n\navailable to him, unless the accused has himself initiated further communication,\n\nexchanges, or conversations with the police.” Edwards v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110475\"><a href=\"/opinion/110475/edwards-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n485 (1981). It does not appear that the trial court abused its discretion in denying\n\nMiddelton’s motion to suppress his confession. The trial court determined that the\n\noffice where the confession occurred was a standard office, and not an\n\ninterrogation room or any other\n\n      particularly threatening or intimidating venue. The defendant did not\n      appear to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol. His speech was\n      clear and coherent. His answers are fairly responsive to the questions\n      asked. He was capable of articulating thoughts, giving directions and\n      describing events. More importantly, the video tape confirms and\n      corroborates fully the testimony of Captain John Rhoden, Lieutenant\n      Brad Stark, Detective Marty Faulkner and Dr. Deborah Leperowski,\n      It is more difficult to reconcile the videotape with the testimony of\n      Drs. James Bernard [sic] and Michael Riordan.\n\nThese findings are supported by the record.\n\n      The trial court also determined that, based on the testimony of Middleton’s\n\nfriend, Britnell, and the officers who encountered Middleton on the night of the\n\n\n                                        - 50 -\n\fmurder, he did not appear to be so influenced by drugs and alcohol as to be\n\nincoherent or not understand that he was waiving his right to remain silent. The\n\ntrial court also observed that of the four psychologists who evaluated Middleton,\n\nDr. Leperowski appeared to have been the most thorough; she reviewed all of the\n\nrecords, gave the most reasonable explanation for the discrepancies between the\n\ndoctors on the issue of Middleton’s capacity to knowingly and voluntarily waive\n\nhis right.\n\n       As to the defendant’s claim regarding the invocation of rights form filed by\n\nthe attorney, the trial court observed that it is clear from the record that\n\nMiddleton’s invocation of rights form had not been executed or served on law\n\nenforcement prior to the defendant’s last interview. The written invocation of\n\nrights was filed in the court file at 11:28 a.m. on July 30, 2009, and served on the\n\nSheriff’s Office that afternoon after the defendant’s last interview, which was\n\nconducted that morning at approximately 9:24 a.m.\n\n       The trial court’s finding that Middleton initiated contact with Detective\n\nFaulkner is also supported by the record. It is clear from the record that Middleton\n\ninitiated the final interview with Detective Faulkner, and understood that he had\n\nthe right to remain silent, and voluntarily chose to waive it. At the beginning of\n\nthe third interview, the defendant was reminded of his Miranda rights. He\n\ncontinued to blame Fowler; he was arrested minutes later. When Detective\n\n\n                                         - 51 -\n\fFaulkner arrived at the Sheriff’s office on July 29, 2009 at approximately 11 a.m.,\n\nhe was notified that Middleton was requesting to speak to him again. The\n\nrecording began at 12:35 p.m. On the recording, Detective Faulkner confirmed\n\nthat Middleton had in fact requested to speak to him and that Middleton had not yet\n\nbeen to first appearance. Detective Faulkner read Middleton his Miranda rights\n\nand Middleton waived his right to remain silent. After initially asking why a\n\ndifferent man was not in jail, Middleton began to ramble about clearing his\n\nconscious and getting his life together. The detectives repeatedly asked him not to\n\nwaste their time. Middleton began to explain the events of the day, including drug\n\nuse. He explained that he and Britnell went to someone’s house and did\n\nOxyContin and smoked methamphetamines. He did not remember what time he\n\nwent to the victim’s trailer, only that it was less than twenty minutes after Fowler\n\nand Britnell went to Walmart. He stated that he knocked on the victim’s door and\n\nthings just went “crazy.” He described the events as “foggy.” When Detective\n\nFaulkner followed up with a question about how long Middleton was at the\n\nvictim’s trailer before the altercation occurred, Middleton stated that he did not\n\nwant to talk anymore and requested to go back to his cell. Detective Faulkner\n\nimmediately states, “All right [sic]. The time is now 12:58 P.M., concluding the\n\ninterview with Dale.”\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 52 -\n\f      Faulkner testified that he went over to the jail the next day, July 30, to check\n\non Middleton because he was so distraught the night before. He stated that upon\n\nseeing him at the jail, Middleton requested to speak to him again. Detective\n\nFaulkner immediately had one of the corrections officers escort Middleton to his\n\noffice. The Sheriff’s Office and the jail are connected, with the distance from\n\nFaulkner’s Office and jail being approximately 50 yards. The jury reviewed the\n\nJuly 30, 2009, recording of Middleton’s interview, along with a transcript. The\n\nvideo begins with Detective Faulkner confirming that it was Middleton who\n\ninitiated the interview. Middleton informs Faulkner during the interview that he\n\nhad been to first appearance that morning, and was told not to talk to anyone.\n\nFaulkner told him that they could not speak unless he specifically decided to speak\n\nwithout his attorney being present. Faulkner repeatedly asked Middleton if he was\n\nsure that he wanted to talk without his attorney present; Middleton responded that\n\nhe did. Faulkner read Middleton his Miranda rights, again. Middleton again\n\nwaived his right to remain silent. Middleton insisted on speaking with Faulkner to\n\nclear his head and get past what happened. Thereafter, Middleton confessed to the\n\nmurder of the victim and the theft of her television.\n\n      When Detective Maerki entered the room, he inquired whether Middleton\n\nhad been to first appearance, to which Middleton replied that he had. He also\n\ninquired whether Middleton had requested to speak to him and Faulkner, to which\n\n\n                                        - 53 -\n\fMiddleton also replied in the affirmative. Throughout the entire interview,\n\nMiddleton repeatedly offered information, stating that he wanted everything to be\n\nover with because the murder that he committed was out of character; he resisted\n\nthe offer to have counsel present, and he agreed to assist in the investigation.\n\n      It is clear from the record that Middleton initiated contact with Detective\n\nFaulkner, rendering his subsequent interview valid under Edwards. Additionally,\n\nthe requirements of Traylor have been met in this case where the detectives\n\nimmediately stopped the interview at Middleton’s request, and only resume their\n\nconversation with him on his prompting. The trial court properly denied the\n\ndefendant’s motion to suppress the videotaped confession.\n\n                    H. SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n      Middleton argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal, claiming that the State failed to present sufficient evidence\n\nto support Middleton’s convictions for first-degree premeditated murder and first-\n\ndegree felony murder. After the State rested in the guilt phase, the defense moved\n\nfor a judgment of acquittal, claiming that the State had not proven that the murder\n\nwas premeditated in nature, only a robbery. The State responded by pointing out\n\nthat Middleton stabbed the victim 35 times. The trial court denied the motion\n\nfinding the threshold for submission of the case to the jury had been surpassed\n\nbecause of the totality of the evidence, including DNA evidence, blood splatter\n\n\n                                        - 54 -\n\fevidence, the number of stab wounds, the nature of the wounds, and Middleton’s\n\narming of himself prior to going to the victim’s trailer.\n\n      The defense also moved for a judgment of acquittal as to the burglary count,\n\nclaiming that Middleton was invited into the trailer and that the state did not prove\n\nthat Middleton intended to commit the theft of the television before he entered the\n\ntrailer. The State responded that Middleton indicated the victim told him to leave\n\nand attempted to remove him from the trailer, thus withdrawing any consent to\n\nenter that was initially given. The State also argued that it did not have to prove\n\nintent to commit theft because it could proceed on the theory that the defendant\n\nremained in the home with the intent to commit murder, which he ultimately\n\ncommitted. The trial court denied the motion for acquittal on these grounds. The\n\ndefense then notified the court that, based on the court’s decision on the burglary\n\njudgment of acquittal, the defense had no argument as to the judgment of acquittal\n\non felony murder which was predicated on the burglary. We affirm the denial of\n\nthe defendant’s motion for judgment of acquittal.\n\n      The evidence in a capital case is judged to be sufficient when it is both\n\ncompetent and substantial.

Id. at 683. In this case, Middleton\n\nexplained that he and Fowler had been discussing the crime for a few days because\n\nthey were experiencing “hard times.” Middleton asked the victim to loan him\n\nmoney, but she said she did not have any money because she paid the bills.

I write separately to emphasize the importance of a mitigation specialist\n\nto the defense team’s investigation and presentation in a capital case and to\n\nencourage trial courts to provide defense counsel the assistance of both a\n\nmitigation specialist and a fact investigator upon a proper and timely request.\n\n      In my view, a trial court should not deny a request for a mitigation specialist\n\neither based on the misconception that these specialists are similar to fact\n\n\n                                        - 61 -\n\finvestigators or based on undue emphasis on an additional expert “costing too\n\nmuch.” It is also important that prosecutors do not add to that misconception by\n\narguing, as the prosecutor did here, that all “a mitigation expert does is synthesiz[e]\n\nspankings and timeouts and things of that nature,” and “you don’t have to be an\n\nexpert” to “go out and find people who can offer mitigation about . . . bumps [the\n\ndefendant] got on the head or spankings he got in school or whatever the case\n\nmight be.”9\n\n      As for the importance of a mitigation specialist, this Court has emphasized\n\nthat “the obligation to investigate and prepare for the penalty portion of a capital\n\ncase cannot be overstated—this is an integral part of a capital case.” State v.\n\nLewis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1102045\"><a href=\"/opinion/1102045/state-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">838</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1113 (Fla. 2002).

ABA Guidelines,\n\n31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 919. At the hearing on the motion to appoint a mitigation\n\nspecialist in this case, the defense counsel urged the trial court to consider the ABA\n\nGuidelines, by explaining that these Guidelines “include[] a suggestion, if not a\n\nmandatory requirement, that a mitigation specialist . . . should be appointed in\n\ndeath cases because of the nature of the crime and because of the serious nature of\n\nthe potential penalty.” The prosecutor’s misguided response was, “I could care\n\nless about what they [the ABA] think about the death penalty and how it operates\n\nin the State of Florida.”\n\n      Contrary to the opinion of the prosecutor in this case, the ABA Guidelines\n\ndo have relevance to capital cases, even if these guidelines are not binding in\n\ndetermining whether counsel rendered ineffective assistance. The United States\n\nSupreme Court has referred to the various renditions of these guidelines as “guides\n\nto determining what is reasonable” for an attorney’s performance, or as reflecting\n\n“well-defined norms” for attorney conduct.

Rev. at 959. Not only do\n\nmitigation specialists have honed skills in gathering and understanding the nature\n\nof potential mitigation evidence, such as the significance of early childhood\n\ntrauma, but mitigation specialists—unlike the defendant’s lawyer—can testify in\n\nthe penalty phase to impart the results of their mitigation investigation to the jury\n\nthat must weigh the mitigation and aggravation in determining whether to\n\nrecommend the death sentence.\n\n\n\n\n                                        - 65 -\n\f      As opposed to fact investigators, mitigation specialists “are generally trained\n\nin the social sciences, with college degrees in social work or psychology,” and “are\n\nadept at gathering institutional records, interviewing lay and professional people,\n\nand compiling case histories.” Hon. Helen G. Berrigan, The Indispensable Role of\n\nthe Mitigation Specialist in a Capital Case: A View From the Federal Bench, 36\n\nHofstra L. Rev. 819, 827-28 (2008). “Significantly, they are trained in uncovering\n\nfamily trauma and screening for often subtle mental and psychological disorders,”\n\nand are “experienced in interpersonal communication so they know how to develop\n\ntrust and rapport with even the most difficult or distrustful of individuals.” Id. at\n\n828 (footnote omitted). Part of the mitigation specialist’s job is to “conduct a\n\ncomprehensive life history investigation of the client and identify all relevant\n\nmitigation issues.” Richard G. Dudley Jr. & Pamela Blume Leonard, Getting It\n\nRight: Life History Investigation as the Foundation for a Reliable Mental Health\n\nAssessment, 36 Hofstra L. Rev. 963, 966 (2008) (footnote omitted).\n\n      A mitigation specialist has the potential to benefit a criminal defendant in a\n\ncapital case in a wide variety of ways, as summarized by the commentary to\n\nGuideline 4.1 of the ABA Guidelines:\n\n      They have the time and the ability to elicit sensitive, embarrassing and\n      often humiliating evidence (e.g., family sexual abuse) that the\n      defendant may have never disclosed. They have the clinical skills to\n      recognize such things as congenital, mental or neurological\n      conditions, to understand how these conditions may have affected the\n      defendant’s development and behavior, and to identify the most\n\n                                         - 66 -\n\f      appropriate experts to examine the defendant or testify on his behalf.\n      Moreover, they may be critical to assuring that the client obtains\n      therapeutic services that render him cognitively and emotionally\n      competent to make sound decisions concerning his case.\n      . . . The mitigation specialist compiles a comprehensive and well-\n      documented psycho-social history of the client based on an exhaustive\n      investigation; analyzes the significance of the information in terms of\n      impact on development, including effect on personality and behavior;\n      finds mitigating themes in the client’s life history; identifies the need\n      for expert assistance; assists in locating appropriate experts; provides\n      social history information to experts to enable them to conduct\n      competent and reliable evaluations; and works with the defense team\n      and experts to develop a comprehensive and cohesive case in\n      mitigation.\n             The mitigation specialist often plays an important role as well\n      in maintaining close contact with the client and his family while the\n      case is pending. The rapport developed in this process can be the key\n      to persuading a client to accept a plea to a sentence less than death.\n\nABA Guidelines, Commentary to Guideline 4.1, 31 Hofstra L. Rev. at 959-60\n\n(footnotes omitted); see also ABA Supplementary Guidelines for the Mitigation\n\nFunction of Defense Teams in Death Penalty Cases (2008), reprinted in 36 Hofstra\n\nL. Rev. 677, 682 (2008) (explaining that mitigation specialists are skilled\n\ninterviewers who can identify and locate relevant persons, recognize and elicit\n\ninformation related to mental health, establish a rapport with witnesses, and\n\n“advise counsel on the appropriate mental health and other expert assistance”).\n\n      The importance of appointing a mitigation specialist becomes all the more\n\nevident in a case involving an indigent defendant, where the trial court appoints\n\nprivate counsel, who generally does not have the same institutional resources as the\n\nPublic Defender’s Office. In such cases, the trial judge effectively decides “what\n\n                                        - 67 -\n\ffinancial assistance, investigators, or experts the defense will be allowed.”\n\nBerrigan, 36 Hofstra L. Rev. at 823. “By controlling the purse strings, the trial\n\njudge effectively controls the quantity and quality of information that will flow to\n\nthe jury if a penalty phase is necessary.” Id. As the Eleventh Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals has stated, “[p]ermitting an indigent capital defendant to introduce\n\nmitigating evidence has little meaning if the funds necessary for compiling the\n\nevidence [are] unavailable.” Westbrook v. Zant, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"416895\"><a href=\"/opinion/416895/johnny-mack-westbrook-v-walter-b-zant-warden-georgia-diagnostic-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1487</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1496 (11th Cir.\n\n1983), overruled on other grounds by Peek v.

Nevertheless, I would not find reversible\n\nerror in this case because the defense lawyer expressly stated that he would renew\n\nhis request for a mitigation specialist, but he did not do so. Further, in this direct\n\nappeal, Middleton is unable to show how he was prejudiced. I therefore concur in\n\nthe affirmance of the conviction and death sentence.\n\nLABARGA, C.J., and PERRY, J., concur.\n\nAn Appeal from the Circuit Court in and for Okeechobee County,\n     Robert Eugene Belanger, Judge - Case No. 472009CF000448CFAXMX\n\nCarol Stafford Haughwout, Public Defender, and Jeffrey L.
