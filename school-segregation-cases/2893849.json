Brown filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the\n\nWestern District of Pennsylvania 1 against the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections\n\n(“DOC”) and numerous prison officials for violations of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985,\n\n1986 and 12101, et. seq. Brown raised claims of cruel and unusual punishment,\n\nretaliation, race and class discrimination, and conspiracy; he also alleged violations of due\n\nprocess and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”). The DOC Defendants moved\n\nfor summary judgment, and Brown failed to respond.2 The Magistrate Judge\n\nrecommended granting summary judgment, and the District Court adopted that\n\nrecommendation.\n\n       Brown subsequently filed a motion to appeal nunc pro tunc, explaining that he had\n\nbeen transferred to a new facility while summary judgment briefing occurred, and that\n\nprison officials had denied him access to his legal mail. The District Court granted relief,\n\nvacating its order granting summary judgment and allowing Brown to respond to\n\ndefendants’ summary judgment motion. Brown filed a brief, an affidavit in support, and\n\ncopies of various Pennsylvania regulations. Brown also filed numerous medical records,\n\n\n\n       1\n       At the time of filing the complaint, Brown was incarcerated at SCI-Fayette in\nLaBelle, Pennsylvania.\n       2\n         Summary judgment was granted as to another defendant, Dr. Peter Saavedra,\nearlier in the case.\n\n                                             2\n\fcorrespondence with prison officials, and news articles. The District Court then adopted\n\nthe Magistrate Judge’s prior recommendation, and granted defendants’ motion for\n\nsummary judgment, without elaboration. Brown timely appealed.\n\n         We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291. We review an order granting\n\nsummary judgment de novo, and we apply the same standard that the District Court\n\nshould have applied. MBIA Ins. Corp. v. Royal Indem. Co., 426 F.3d 204, 209 (3d Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n         On February 26, 2004, Brown was transferred to the Long Term Segregation Unit\n\n(“LTSU”) at SCI-Fayette. Brown alleges that prison officials improperly placed him in\n\nthe LTSU based on his “mentally ill behavior,” and that the reasons provided on his\n\ntransfer petition were falsified and misrepresented. Brown also alleges that the LTSU is\n\nan experiment regarding “African-American psychology,” with the purpose of\n\n“destroy[ing] the African American mind,” and that defendants failed to provide him\n\nadequate psychiatric treatment, instead relying “just [on] drugs to leave him in a . . .\n\nstupor.” Brown accuses LTSU officials of obstructing his litigation against defendant\n\nBeard and others, and asserts that, but for his being of African descent, engaging in\n\nlitigation and being mentally ill, he would not have been placed in the LTSU. Brown also\n\nalleges that defendants are deliberately indifferent to his health and safety.\n\n         Based on these allegations, Brown claimed that his rights to due process, adequate\n\nmedical care, and equal protection had been violated. He also asserted violations of the\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fFirst Amendment and the ADA, and he claimed that defendants had retaliated against\n\nhim. On appeal, Brown challenges the District Court’s grant of summary judgment on his\n\ndue process, ADA and First Amendment claims.3\n\n       Once the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine material factual\n\ndispute, the non-moving party must proffer “specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n\nissue for trial.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Brown asserts that prison officials denied him due\n\nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment by transferring him to the LTSU without notice\n\nand depriving him of the opportunity to challenge the reasons for the transfer. Routine\n\ntransfers to administrative segregation do not impinge on liberty interests protected by the\n\nDue Process clause unless the conditions in administrative segregation present a\n\n“significant and atypical hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995). Even where the conditions of confinement\n\npresent a significant and atypical hardship, triggering the right to due process, placement\n\nin administrative segregation comports with due process so long as prison officials afford\n\na prisoner sufficient procedural protections. See Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        As Brown has not raised his equal protection or retaliation claims on appeal, we\nconsider those arguments waived. Anspach v. City of Phila., 503 F.3d 256, 259 n.1 (3d\nCir. 2007) (citing Laborers’ Int’l Union of N. Am. v. Foster Wheeler Energy Corp., 26\nF.3d 375, 398 (3d Cir. 1994)). Although Brown has not expressly made an argument\nunder the Eighth Amendment on appeal, we will address that claim because it is\npredicated on the same facts as his claim under the ADA.\n\n                                              4\n\f(2005).4\n\n       We have determined that due process does not require prior notice of a transfer\n\nwhere the post-transfer periodic review of an inmate’s placement in segregation provides\n\nthe inmate with a meaningful opportunity to challenge the grounds of his continued\n\nsegregation. Shoats v. Horn, 213 F.3d 140, 145 (3d Cir. 2000). Such periodic review\n\nmust provide a meaningful, and not merely technical, opportunity to be heard. See\n\nSourbeer v. Robinson, 791 F.2d 1094, 1101 (3d Cir. 1986) (Due process violation where\n\nofficials applied justifications for segregation in “rote fashion”).\n\n       Brown admits that the prison has provided him with periodic review, and that he\n\nhas attended and testified at his review hearings every 90 days. He nonetheless contends\n\nthat the hearings are a sham and the result of the hearings a foregone conclusion. In his\n\naffidavit, Brown asserts that unnamed prison officials have told him that the periodic\n\nreviews do not provide a realistic chance of release into the general prison population\n\nbecause the LTSU is designed to house those in need of long-term segregation. Brown\n\nsuggests that, once prison officials branded him as an inmate needing long-term\n\nsegregation, they simply rubberstamped his continued segregation. Brown’s affidavit,\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        The record indicates that DOC has revised the procedures for placement in the\nLTSU, such that inmates are now given notice and an opportunity to respond before being\ntransferred to the LTSU. (Pl’s Opp., Ex. C, at 26-29) (letter from Jeffrey Beard to Judge\nRichard Caputo, Middle District of Pennsylvania). Appellees also state that the LTSU\nwas abolished in February 2007. Appellees’ Br., 3. As Brown seeks compensatory\ndamages, his claims are not moot.\n\n                                               5\n\fsubmitted in response to defendants’ motion, does not support a conclusion that his\n\nreviews were a sham.\n\n       Brown also contends on appeal that prison officials have never articulated a reason\n\nfor his confinement in the LTSU. The record belies that assertion. The documentary\n\nevidence submitted by the parties establishes that prison officials believed Brown’s\n\nmisconduct warranted his continued placement in the LTSU. (Deft.’s Mot. Summ J., Ex.\n\nD) (30-day review assessment showing Brown’s continued poor conduct), Ex. F\n\n(misconduct record demonstrating Brown’s continued pattern of threats and assaults on\n\nstaff). The record reveals that the prison characterized Brown’s behavior alternatively as\n\ndeliberate, i.e., designed to manipulate those around him, and as the product of mental\n\nillness and poor impulse control. (Pl’s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. I) (transfer individual\n\ntreatment plan stating that Brown suffers from multiple Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, but\n\nthat he was psychiatrically stable and should be placed in the LTSU due to the ongoing\n\nrisk of staff assaults and self-harm). The mental health and correctional staff who\n\nevaluated Brown after his transfer to the LTSU stated that he had no treatable Axis I\n\nissues, and that his misconduct was associated with his Axis II issues. (Deft.’s Mot.\n\nSumm J., Ex. A.) In other words, whatever mental illnesses Brown may have, prison\n\npersonnel have determined that none would preclude his transfer to the LTSU. As Brown\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\ffailed to satisfy his burden under Rule 56(e), summary judgment was properly granted.5\n\n       Brown next contends that his placement in the LTSU violates the ADA because he\n\nhas no access to mental health services while housed in the LTSU. Although defendants\n\ndid not move for summary judgment on Brown’s ADA claim, and the District Court did\n\nnot address this claim, it is clear that Brown’s claim must fail as a matter of law. Title II\n\nof the ADA states, “[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\n\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such\n\nentity.” § 42 U.S.C. 12132. Title II of the ADA applies to state prisons. Pennsylvania\n\nDep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 210 (1998). However, Brown has not alleged\n\n\n\n       5\n        Brown also asserts on appeal that the District Court improperly resolved a factual\nissue regarding Brown’s claim that prison officials violated due process by drafting him\ninto experiments against his will, in contravention of DOC policy. See Washington v.\nHarper, 494 U.S. 210, 221-22 (1990) (prisoner “possesses a significant liberty interest in\navoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”). Although defendants failed to move for\nsummary judgment on this claim, and the District Court overlooked it as well, Brown’s\nallegations fail to state a claim. Brown asserts that the LTSU constitutes an experiment\ndesigned to destroy the minds of African-American inmates, but has not alleged facts\nsufficient to show that he is entitled to relief. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, 515\nF.3d 224, 231 (3d Cir. 2008). This claim, that the LTSU constitutes a psychological\nexperiment involving the involuntary administration of drugs, is essentially a composite\nof two other claims: a due process claim regarding Brown’s placement in the LTSU, and\nan Eighth Amendment claim regarding Brown’s medical care in the LTSU. In response\nto defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Brown was required to come forward with\nevidence in support of these two claims. Therefore, despite defendants’ failure to move\nfor summary judgment on the prison experiment claim, Brown necessarily would have\nsubmitted whatever evidence he had in support of this claim when he submitted evidence\nin support of his due process and Eighth Amendment claims.\n\n                                              7\n\ffacts sufficient to show that the prison denied him access to mental health treatment “by\n\nreason of” his alleged disabilities. Brown alleges that the prison ignored his alleged\n\ndisabilities in order to justify his placement in the LTSU – not that they placed him in the\n\nLTSU because of discriminatory animus based on his alleged mental disabilities.\n\nAccordingly, Brown’s ADA claim must fail.\n\n         The record establishes that Brown has not been deprived of medical care in the\n\nLTSU. Mere disagreements over the course of medical treatment do not support a claim\n\nfor a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Monmouth County Corr. Inst. Inmates v.\n\nLanzaro, 834 F.2d 326, 346 (3d Cir. 1987). The record demonstrates that prison medical\n\npersonnel have routinely assessed Brown while he has stayed on the LTSU. Brown\n\nchallenges his regimen of medications, which allegedly leaves him in a “stupor,” but this\n\nargument states only his disagreement with treatment methods, i.e., his preference for\n\nmedication supplemented by psychotherapy instead of medication alone.\n\n         Brown also appeals the District Court’s grant of summary judgment as to his First\n\nAmendment claim. Brown does not challenge the LTSU policy that permits limited\n\naccess to publications; instead, he asserts that he is deprived of even those publications\n\npermitted under the restrictive publications policy upheld by the Supreme Court. See\n\nBeard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521 (2006). However, Brown does not proffer any evidence in\n\nsupport of this claim. Brown has not established that there is a genuine factual dispute for\n\ntrial.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f      For these reasons, the District Court properly granted appellees’ summary\n\njudgment motion and denied appellant’s summary judgment motion.\n\n      Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f",

Brown alleges that prison officials improperly placed him in\n\nthe LTSU based on his “mentally ill behavior,” and that the reasons provided on his\n\ntransfer petition were falsified and misrepresented. Brown also alleges that the LTSU is\n\nan experiment regarding “African-American psychology,” with the purpose of\n\n“destroy[ing] the African American mind,” and that defendants failed to provide him\n\nadequate psychiatric treatment, instead relying “just [on] drugs to leave him in a . . .\n\nstupor.” Brown accuses LTSU officials of obstructing his litigation against defendant\n\nBeard and others, and asserts that, but for his being of African descent, engaging in\n\nlitigation and being mentally ill, he would not have been placed in the LTSU. Brown also\n\nalleges that defendants are deliberately indifferent to his health and safety.\n\n         Based on these allegations, Brown claimed that his rights to due process, adequate\n\nmedical care, and equal protection had been violated. He also asserted violations of the\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fFirst Amendment and the ADA, and he claimed that defendants had retaliated against\n\nhim. On appeal, Brown challenges the District Court’s grant of summary judgment on his\n\ndue process, ADA and First Amendment claims.3\n\n       Once the moving party demonstrates the absence of a genuine material factual\n\ndispute, the non-moving party must proffer “specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n\nissue for trial.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e). Brown asserts that prison officials denied him due\n\nprocess under the Fourteenth Amendment by transferring him to the LTSU without notice\n\nand depriving him of the opportunity to challenge the reasons for the transfer. Routine\n\ntransfers to administrative segregation do not impinge on liberty interests protected by the\n\nDue Process clause unless the conditions in administrative segregation present a\n\n“significant and atypical hardship in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.”\n\nSandin v.

Even where the conditions of confinement\n\npresent a significant and atypical hardship, triggering the right to due process, placement\n\nin administrative segregation comports with due process so long as prison officials afford\n\na prisoner sufficient procedural protections.

He nonetheless contends\n\nthat the hearings are a sham and the result of the hearings a foregone conclusion. In his\n\naffidavit, Brown asserts that unnamed prison officials have told him that the periodic\n\nreviews do not provide a realistic chance of release into the general prison population\n\nbecause the LTSU is designed to house those in need of long-term segregation. Brown\n\nsuggests that, once prison officials branded him as an inmate needing long-term\n\nsegregation, they simply rubberstamped his continued segregation. Brown’s affidavit,\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        The record indicates that DOC has revised the procedures for placement in the\nLTSU, such that inmates are now given notice and an opportunity to respond before being\ntransferred to the LTSU. (Pl’s Opp., Ex. C, at 26-29) (letter from Jeffrey Beard to Judge\nRichard Caputo, Middle District of Pennsylvania). Appellees also state that the LTSU\nwas abolished in February 2007. Appellees’ Br., 3. As Brown seeks compensatory\ndamages, his claims are not moot.\n\n                                               5\n\fsubmitted in response to defendants’ motion, does not support a conclusion that his\n\nreviews were a sham.\n\n       Brown also contends on appeal that prison officials have never articulated a reason\n\nfor his confinement in the LTSU. The record belies that assertion. The documentary\n\nevidence submitted by the parties establishes that prison officials believed Brown’s\n\nmisconduct warranted his continued placement in the LTSU. (Deft.’s Mot. Summ J., Ex.\n\nD) (30-day review assessment showing Brown’s continued poor conduct), Ex. F\n\n(misconduct record demonstrating Brown’s continued pattern of threats and assaults on\n\nstaff). The record reveals that the prison characterized Brown’s behavior alternatively as\n\ndeliberate, i.e., designed to manipulate those around him, and as the product of mental\n\nillness and poor impulse control. (Pl’s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. I) (transfer individual\n\ntreatment plan stating that Brown suffers from multiple Axis I and Axis II diagnoses, but\n\nthat he was psychiatrically stable and should be placed in the LTSU due to the ongoing\n\nrisk of staff assaults and self-harm). The mental health and correctional staff who\n\nevaluated Brown after his transfer to the LTSU stated that he had no treatable Axis I\n\nissues, and that his misconduct was associated with his Axis II issues. (Deft.’s Mot.\n\nSumm J., Ex. A.) In other words, whatever mental illnesses Brown may have, prison\n\npersonnel have determined that none would preclude his transfer to the LTSU. As Brown\n\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\ffailed to satisfy his burden under Rule 56(e), summary judgment was properly granted.5\n\n       Brown next contends that his placement in the LTSU violates the ADA because he\n\nhas no access to mental health services while housed in the LTSU. Although defendants\n\ndid not move for summary judgment on Brown’s ADA claim, and the District Court did\n\nnot address this claim, it is clear that Brown’s claim must fail as a matter of law. Title II\n\nof the ADA states, “[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such\n\ndisability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services,\n\nprograms, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such\n\nentity.” § 42 U.S.C. 12132. Title II of the ADA applies to state prisons. Pennsylvania\n\nDep’t of Corr. v. Yeskey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118228\"><a href=\"/opinion/118228/pennsylvania-dept-of-corrections-v-yeskey/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 210 (1998). However, Brown has not alleged\n\n\n\n       5\n        Brown also asserts on appeal that the District Court improperly resolved a factual\nissue regarding Brown’s claim that prison officials violated due process by drafting him\ninto experiments against his will, in contravention of DOC policy. See Washington v.\nHarper, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112381\"><a href=\"/opinion/112381/washington-v-harper/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 221-22 (1990) (prisoner “possesses a significant liberty interest in\navoiding the unwanted administration of antipsychotic drugs under the Due Process\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”). Although defendants failed to move for\nsummary judgment on this claim, and the District Court overlooked it as well, Brown’s\nallegations fail to state a claim. Brown asserts that the LTSU constitutes an experiment\ndesigned to destroy the minds of African-American inmates, but has not alleged facts\nsufficient to show that he is entitled to relief. See Phillips v. County of Allegheny, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1387268\"><a href=\"/opinion/1387268/phillips-v-county-of-allegheny/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 231 (3d Cir. 2008). This claim, that the LTSU constitutes a psychological\nexperiment involving the involuntary administration of drugs, is essentially a composite\nof two other claims: a due process claim regarding Brown’s placement in the LTSU, and\nan Eighth Amendment claim regarding Brown’s medical care in the LTSU. In response\nto defendants’ motion for summary judgment, Brown was required to come forward with\nevidence in support of these two claims. Therefore, despite defendants’ failure to move\nfor summary judgment on the prison experiment claim, Brown necessarily would have\nsubmitted whatever evidence he had in support of this claim when he submitted evidence\nin support of his due process and Eighth Amendment claims.\n\n                                              7\n\ffacts sufficient to show that the prison denied him access to mental health treatment “by\n\nreason of” his alleged disabilities. Brown alleges that the prison ignored his alleged\n\ndisabilities in order to justify his placement in the LTSU – not that they placed him in the\n\nLTSU because of discriminatory animus based on his alleged mental disabilities.\n\nAccordingly, Brown’s ADA claim must fail.\n\n         The record establishes that Brown has not been deprived of medical care in the\n\nLTSU. Mere disagreements over the course of medical treatment do not support a claim\n\nfor a violation of the Eighth Amendment. Monmouth County Corr. Inst. Inmates v.\n\nLanzaro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"498141\"><a href=\"/opinion/498141/monmouth-county-correctional-institutional-inmates-kevin-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">834</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">326</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 346 (3d Cir. 1987). The record demonstrates that prison medical\n\npersonnel have routinely assessed Brown while he has stayed on the LTSU. Brown\n\nchallenges his regimen of medications, which allegedly leaves him in a “stupor,” but this\n\nargument states only his disagreement with treatment methods, i.e., his preference for\n\nmedication supplemented by psychotherapy instead of medication alone.\n\n         Brown also appeals the District Court’s grant of summary judgment as to his First\n\nAmendment claim. Brown does not challenge the LTSU policy that permits limited\n\naccess to publications; instead, he asserts that he is deprived of even those publications\n\npermitted under the restrictive publications policy upheld by the Supreme Court. See\n\nBeard v. Banks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145626\"><a href=\"/opinion/145626/beard-v-banks/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">521</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006). However, Brown does not proffer any evidence in\n\nsupport of this claim. Brown has not established that there is a genuine factual dispute for\n\ntrial.\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f      For these reasons, the District Court properly granted appellees’ summary\n\njudgment motion and denied appellant’s summary judgment motion.\n\n      Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court’s order.\n\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\f</pre>",
