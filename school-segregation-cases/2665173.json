JUSTICE STEVENS                                          DECIDED: June 15, 2015\n       Our legislature seeks to protect Pennsylvania school children from drug dealers\n\nengaging in nefarious activities near neighborhood schools and playgrounds. Without\n\nmandatory sentences, my concern is that there will be inconsistent sentencing for drug\n\ndealers who operate near school property, thereby frustrating the mandatory sentencing\n\npenalty put in place by our duly elected legislators.\n\n       Reasonable minds can disagree. I respectfully offer this Dissent in support of the\n\nconstitutionality of mandatory sentences.\n\n       The legislature, with the approval of the governor, created a mandatory\n\nsentencing scheme to deter and punish those who sell drugs within 1000 feet of school\n\nproperty. Such a policy is a legislative prerogative.\n\n       While the majority decision does not affect the ability of the Commonwealth to\n\narrest and prosecute drug dealers near our neighborhood schools, my concern is that\n\nthe sentencing of those drug dealers may become inconsistent throughout\n\fPennsylvania because individual trial judges in different counties will not have the\n\nmandatory sentence requirement by which to abide.\n\n       I respectfully dissent from the learned majority’s decision to strike the entirety of\n\n18 Pa.C.S. § 6317. In doing so, the majority finds our mandatory minimum sentencing\n\nscheme constitutionally infirm in light of the United States Supreme Court’s decision in\n\nAlleyne v. United States, -- U.S. -- 133 S. Ct. 2151 (2013). For the reasons that follow, I\n\nwould reverse and uphold the constitutionality of that statute.\n\n       When evaluating the constitutionality of any statutory provision, there is a strong\n\npresumption in the Commonwealth that our legislature’s enactments do not violate the\n\nconstitution. Commonwealth v. Williams, 557 Pa. 285, 304, 733 A.2d 593, 603 (1999).\n\nA substantial burden of persuasion is, therefore, placed upon an individual challenging\n\nthe constitutionality of a statute. Id. All doubts must be resolved in favor of sustaining\n\nthe statute’s constitutionality. Hayes v. Erie Ins. Exch., 493 Pa. 150, 155, 425 A.2d 419,\n\n421 (1981). Accordingly, a statutory provision will be found unconstitutional only if “it\n\nclearly, palpably and plainly violates the constitution.” Id.\n\n       When a court with sufficient authority declares a portion of a statute\n\nunconstitutional, however, public policy favors severability.          Commonwealth v.\n\nMockaitis, 575 Pa. 5, 28, 834 A.2d 488, 502 (2003). It is well settled law that when a\n\nportion of a statute is declared unconstitutional, the entirety of the statute is not\n\nineludibly unconstitutional.   Rothermel v. Meyerle, 136 Pa. 250, 20 A. 583 (1890).\n\nUnconstitutional provisions should, therefore, be severed from the remaining valid\n\nprovisions whenever possible to uphold the legitimacy of the statute. Id. The legislature\n\nhas codified this longstanding principle in 1 Pa.C.S. § 1925, which provides:\n       The provisions of every statute shall be severable. If any provision of any\n       statute or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held\n       invalid, the remainder of the statute, and the application of such provision\n       to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, unless\n\n                                       [J-78-2014] - 2\n\f      the court finds that the valid provisions of the statute are so essentially\n      and inseparably connected with, and so depend upon, the void provision\n      or application, that it cannot be presumed the General Assembly would\n      have enacted the remaining valid provisions without the void one; or\n      unless the court finds that the remaining valid provisions, standing alone,\n      are incomplete and incapable of being executed in accordance with the\n      legislative intent.\n1 Pa.C.S. § 1925. See Stilp v. Commonwealth, 588 Pa. 539, 905 A.2d 918 (2006).\n\nSeverance is disfavored only when the invalid provisions are so essentially and\n\ninseparably connected with the remaining provisions of the Act that the remainder of the\n\nstatute is incapable of being executed in accordance with the legislative intent.\n\nCommonwealth v. Williams, 574 Pa. 487, 527, 832 A.2d 962, 986 (2003). This leaves\n\nthis Court with the duty of examining whether the enacting legislature would have\n\nenacted the statute had it known the particular provision in question was\n\nunconstitutional. Anneberg v. Commonwealth, 562 Pa. 581, 596, 757 A.2d 338, 347\n\n(2000).\n\n      Here, the Alleyne decision, in effect, invalidated certain aspects of Section 6317.1\n\nThe Commonwealth, however, aptly notes that Alleyne’s effect concerns only the\n\nprocedural provisions of Section 6317. The United States Supreme Court did not, in\n\nany way, affect the statute’s substantive provisions, the portions that clearly\n\ndemonstrate the primary legislative intent in enacting this statute. The Pennsylvania\n\nLegislature chose to make the sale of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a\n\nschool zone subject to a mandatory minimum sentence in order to shield the children of\n\nthis Commonwealth from the execrable effects of the drug trade. This legislative policy\n\nhas been continually recognized by the courts of this Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n1\n  The United States Supreme Court invalidated the portions of our mandatory minimum\nsentencing statutes that place requisite fact-finding in the hands of the sentencing court\nfor the sentencing court to determine by a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n\n                                     [J-78-2014] - 3\n\f       For example, in Commonwealth v. Marion, 981 A.2d 230, 243 (Pa. Super. 2009),\n\nappeal denied, 605 Pa. 697, 981 A.2d 230 (2010), the Superior Court considered the\n\nlegislative intent in enacting Section 6317, and, in doing so, relied upon its prior\n\nholdings in Commonwealth v. Drummond, 775 A.2d 849, 857 (Pa. Super. 2001) (en\n\nbanc), appeal denied, 567 Pa. 756, 790 A.2d 1013 (2001), and Commonwealth v.\n\nCampbell, 758 A.2d 1231, 1233–34 (Pa. Super. 2000), which stated that:\n       [T]he General Assembly's goal and purpose [in enacting Section 6317]\n       was to protect the children of our communities from the ravages and evils\n       of the illegal drug trade that pervades our country. Through the enactment\n       of [S]ection 6317, it attempted to fortify the barrier that segregates the\n       places where our children frequent from the illegal drug scene. A strict\n       reading of the statute exemplifies the General Assembly's intentK.\nDrummond, supra at 856-57 (quoting Campbell, supra at 1236-37 (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Commonwealth v. Williams, 955 A.2d 386, 390 (Pa. Super.\n\n2008). The dim view with which the General Assembly beholds drug trafficking, clearly\n\nillustrates its intent to enable the imposition of an appropriate punishment upon those\n\nwho sell drugs within a school zone, by ensuring that those individuals are separated\n\nfrom society.\n\n       With that background in mind, I cannot agree that our legislature would not have\n\nenacted Section 6317 if it had known that a jury was required to make the requisite fact-\n\nfinding, which would trigger a mandatory sentence, rather than a sentencing judge. In\n\nso holding, the majority does not address the statute’s manifest intent. While these\n\nprocedural aspects were certainly important to the legislature in its enactment of the\n\nstatute, there is nothing of record to assume that they were so germane that but for their\n\nincorporation, the legislature would not have enacted the statute. Indeed, the driving\n\nforce behind the particular statute in question was primarily to impose higher sentences\n\nupon those who sell drugs in school zones, in order to keep drugs away from our\n\nchildren. Such is a legitimate, constitutional, legislative decision.\n\n                                       [J-78-2014] - 4\n\f       The remaining portion of the statute, along with the constitutional jury\n\nrequirements articulated in Alleyne, provide more than enough guidance to allow\n\nSection 6317 to function in accordance with its primary legislative intent. Excising the\n\nnow invalid portions of the statute does not render Section 6317 incapable of being\n\nenforced.    The United States Supreme Court’s pronouncement that any fact that\n\nincreases a mandatory minimum sentence is an element of an enhanced crime, and\n\nmust be submitted to the jury, coupled with our rules on severability dictate that we\n\nshould simply submit the requisite fact to the jury to determine beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. This would achieve the manifest goal of our legislature, imposing mandatory\n\nminimum sentences upon those who sell drugs in a school zone\n\n       By doing so, this Court would not be infringing upon the power of the legislature.\n\nRather, we would be doing precisely what the legislature would have intended,\n\nupholding a valid provision of its statute in accordance with its rules of statutory\n\nconstruction. Furthermore, we would be following the constitutional pronouncement as\n\nechoed by our United States Supreme Court in the Alleyne decision by allowing the jury\n\nto make the specific fact-finding. The majority aptly notes, however, that use of special\n\nverdicts in criminal cases has seemingly been disfavored in this Commonwealth. To\n\nsupport this contention, my colleagues rely on this Court’s decision in Commonwealth v.\n\nSamuel, 599 Pa. 166, 961 A.2d 57 (2008).\n\n       In Samuel, we noted that, unlike in civil cases, “where there is specific authority\n\nfor special verdicts . . . there is no such provision in criminal trials . . ..” Id. at 177, 961\n\nA.2d at 64. Further, the Samuel court, quoting Commonwealth v. Campana, 452 Pa.\n\n233, 247 n. 27, 304 A.2d 432, 438 n. 27 (1973) (plurality), vacated on other grounds,\n\n414 U.S. 808, 94 S.Ct. 73 (1973), went on to state that “[t]he proposal of special\n\nverdicts in criminal trials to determine what issues the jury actually resolved has been\n\n\n                                       [J-78-2014] - 5\n\falmost universally condemned.” This sentiment has been echoed most recently by this\n\nCourt in Commonwealth v. Jacobs, 614 Pa. 664, 39 A.3d 977 (2012) (plurality opinion).\n\nThe value of this authority, however, is suspect, as the quoted language from Samuel is\n\ndicta, which relies on, Campana, a plurality opinion.\n\n       Furthermore, courts seem to be rejecting an unyielding position regarding the\n\nuse of special verdicts.     For instance, in Jacobs, then Justice Saylor, writing a\n\nconcurring opinion, which was joined by then Chief Justice Castille, stated:\n       Finally, at least in the post-Apprendi landscape, and in matters which are\n       governed by the decision, serious arguments are being made to the effect\n       that the courts ought to reconsider the policy against special jury findings.\n       See, e.g., Meghan A. Ferguson, Balancing Lenity, Rationality and Finality:\n       A Case for Special Verdict Forms in Cases Involving Overlapping Federal\n       Criminal Offenses, 59 DUKE L.J. 1195, 1208 n. 85 (2010) (collecting\n       decisions reflecting the use of special verdict forms in the wake of\n       Apprendi). Therefore I would refrain from continuing to suggest an\n       inflexible position on the subject.\nId. at 681, 39 A.3d at 987.     Additionally, federal courts have, for some time, been\n\nemploying special interrogatories in criminal cases to aid the jury when tasked with\n\ndetermining specific facts. See e.g. United States v. Peña-Lora, 225 F.3d 17, 30 (1st\n\nCir. 2000) (holding that district courts are vested with discretion to employ special\n\nverdict forms in criminal cases where a count alleging using and carrying a firearm\n\nduring a crime of violence lists both a regular firearm and a machinegun); United States\n\nv. Sims, 975 F.2d 1225, 1235-36 (6th Cir. 1992) (holding that if the jury returns a guilty\n\nverdict, the court may submit special interrogatories to the jury, requiring that it specify\n\nwhich category of weapons it found the defendant was using or carrying.); United States\n\nv. Smith, 938 F.2d 69, 70 (7th Cir. 1991) (holding that special verdicts, while generally\n\nnot favored in criminal cases, were permitted in situations where the defendant's\n\noffense turns on factual findings).\n\n\n\n\n                                      [J-78-2014] - 6\n\f      More relevant to the instant discussion, however, these processes have been\n\nimplemented in situations where the jury is tasked with making specific findings, which\n\nwere formerly classified as sentencing factors, in the post-Apprendi landscape. Federal\n\nprosecutors often will charge in their indictments, factors that increase the applicable\n\nstatutory maximum sentences. Thirtieth Annual Review of Criminal Procedure: United\n\nStates Supreme Court and Courts of Appeals 1999-2000, 89 Geo. L.J. 1045, 1049\n\n(2001).   Moreover, federal prosecutors have developed jury instructions and verdict\n\nforms to be used in submitting those factors to the jury for determination. Id. Because\n\nthe decision in Alleyne turned on similar legal principles to the Apprendi decision, a\n\nsimilar procedure should be implemented in our present scenario.\n\n      At least one Pennsylvania trial court implemented such a procedure under the\n\nAlleyne posture, by presenting a special verdict to the jury. See Commonwealth v.\n\nValentine, 101 A.3d 801 (Pa. Super. 2014). While the Superior Court in that case found\n\nthe procedure was in err, it is precisely what the Superior Court decided was proper in\n\nin Commonwealth v. Watley, 81 A.3d 108 (Pa. Super. 2013), appeal denied, -- Pa. --, 95\n\nA.3d 277 (Pa. 2014) regarding Apprendi. In Watley, the Superior Court relying on\n\nCommonwealth v. Johnson, 910 A.2d 60 (Pa. Super. 2006), and Commonwealth v.\n\nKearns, 907 A.2d 649 (Pa. Super. 2006), found that specific jury findings relative to the\n\ncharge for which the defendant is being sentenced are necessary where Apprendi is\n\nimplicated. As such, the same procedure, as applied in Apprendi situations, is precisely\n\nthe appropriate remedy in the present scenario, which will uphold the validity of the\n\nlegislature’s enactment. Further, our Criminal Court Rules Committee should address\n\nas rapidly as feasible an appropriate amendment.\n\n      The majority’s decision invalidates the entirety of our mandatory minimum\n\nsentencing scheme. I urge our General Assembly to do whatever it takes to reaffirm\n\n\n                                     [J-78-2014] - 7\n\fthrough appropriate legislation its foregoing intent, i.e. the disapproval of the illegal drug\n\ntrade that has for decades ravished all too many communities and families throughout\n\nthe Commonwealth.\n\n       I would find the mandatory sentencing scheme is constitutional.\n\n\n\n\n                                       [J-78-2014] - 8\n\f",

The United States Supreme Court did not, in\n\nany way, affect the statute’s substantive provisions, the portions that clearly\n\ndemonstrate the primary legislative intent in enacting this statute. The Pennsylvania\n\nLegislature chose to make the sale of controlled substances within 1,000 feet of a\n\nschool zone subject to a mandatory minimum sentence in order to shield the children of\n\nthis Commonwealth from the execrable effects of the drug trade.

Through the enactment\n       of [S]ection 6317, it attempted to fortify the barrier that segregates the\n       places where our children frequent from the illegal drug scene. A strict\n       reading of the statute exemplifies the General Assembly's intentK.\nDrummond, supra at 856-57 (quoting Campbell, supra at 1236-37 (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Commonwealth v. Williams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1978786\"><a href=\"/opinion/1978786/com-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">955</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 390 (Pa. Super.\n\n2008). The dim view with which the General Assembly beholds drug trafficking, clearly\n\nillustrates its intent to enable the imposition of an appropriate punishment upon those\n\nwho sell drugs within a school zone, by ensuring that those individuals are separated\n\nfrom society.\n\n       With that background in mind, I cannot agree that our legislature would not have\n\nenacted Section 6317 if it had known that a jury was required to make the requisite fact-\n\nfinding, which would trigger a mandatory sentence, rather than a sentencing judge. In\n\nso holding, the majority does not address the statute’s manifest intent. While these\n\nprocedural aspects were certainly important to the legislature in its enactment of the\n\nstatute, there is nothing of record to assume that they were so germane that but for their\n\nincorporation, the legislature would not have enacted the statute. Indeed, the driving\n\nforce behind the particular statute in question was primarily to impose higher sentences\n\nupon those who sell drugs in school zones, in order to keep drugs away from our\n\nchildren. Such is a legitimate, constitutional, legislative decision.\n\n                                       [J-78-2014] - 4\n\f       The remaining portion of the statute, along with the constitutional jury\n\nrequirements articulated in Alleyne, provide more than enough guidance to allow\n\nSection 6317 to function in accordance with its primary legislative intent. Excising the\n\nnow invalid portions of the statute does not render Section 6317 incapable of being\n\nenforced.    The United States Supreme Court’s pronouncement that any fact that\n\nincreases a mandatory minimum sentence is an element of an enhanced crime, and\n\nmust be submitted to the jury, coupled with our rules on severability dictate that we\n\nshould simply submit the requisite fact to the jury to determine beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt. This would achieve the manifest goal of our legislature, imposing mandatory\n\nminimum sentences upon those who sell drugs in a school zone\n\n       By doing so, this Court would not be infringing upon the power of the legislature.\n\nRather, we would be doing precisely what the legislature would have intended,\n\nupholding a valid provision of its statute in accordance with its rules of statutory\n\nconstruction. Furthermore, we would be following the constitutional pronouncement as\n\nechoed by our United States Supreme Court in the Alleyne decision by allowing the jury\n\nto make the specific fact-finding. The majority aptly notes, however, that use of special\n\nverdicts in criminal cases has seemingly been disfavored in this Commonwealth. To\n\nsupport this contention, my colleagues rely on this Court’s decision in Commonwealth v.\n\nSamuel, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">599</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008).\n\n       In Samuel, we noted that, unlike in civil cases, “where there is specific authority\n\nfor special verdicts . . . there is no such provision in criminal trials . . ..” Id. at 177, 961\n\nA.2d at 64. Further, the Samuel court, quoting Commonwealth v.

For instance, in Jacobs, then Justice Saylor, writing a\n\nconcurring opinion, which was joined by then Chief Justice Castille, stated:\n       Finally, at least in the post-Apprendi landscape, and in matters which are\n       governed by the decision, serious arguments are being made to the effect\n       that the courts ought to reconsider the policy against special jury findings.\n       See, e.g., Meghan A. Ferguson, Balancing Lenity, Rationality and Finality:\n       A Case for Special Verdict Forms in Cases Involving Overlapping Federal\n       Criminal Offenses, 59 DUKE L.J. 1195, 1208 n. 85 (2010) (collecting\n       decisions reflecting the use of special verdict forms in the wake of\n       Apprendi). Therefore I would refrain from continuing to suggest an\n       inflexible position on the subject.\nId. at 681, 39 A.3d at 987.     Additionally, federal courts have, for some time, been\n\nemploying special interrogatories in criminal cases to aid the jury when tasked with\n\ndetermining specific facts. See e.g. United States v.

Moreover, federal prosecutors have developed jury instructions and verdict\n\nforms to be used in submitting those factors to the jury for determination. Id. Because\n\nthe decision in Alleyne turned on similar legal principles to the Apprendi decision, a\n\nsimilar procedure should be implemented in our present scenario.\n\n      At least one Pennsylvania trial court implemented such a procedure under the\n\nAlleyne posture, by presenting a special verdict to the jury.
