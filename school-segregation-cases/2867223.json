He filed\n\nsuit   in   the    District    Court       for    the     Western     District     of\nPennsylvania      against    the   Pennsylvania           State     Department     of\n\nCorrections,      its   Commissioner        Joseph      D.    Lehman,     and     SCI\n\nSuperintendent     Fredric    A.   Rosemeyer,          seeking     injunctive     and\n\ndeclaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. § 1983.                    After holding an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the district court denied Troster's request\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.              The Pennsylvania Department of\n\nCorrections then ordered Troster suspended for five days for\n\ngross insubordination.        This court granted an emergency motion\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\ffor an injunction pending appeal, and Troster has remained on the\n\njob.   Troster has appealed the district court's order denying him\n\na preliminary injunction.\n\n               Troster        advances         two        theories     to     support        his\n\nallegations that the threatened disciplinary action violates his\n\nrights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.                                   First, he\n\nadvances       a     \"compelled        speech\"       argument--that        the    flag   patch\n\nregulation that he refuses to observe unconstitutionally compels\n\nhim to engage in expressive or symbolic conduct.                                  Second, he\n\npresses a \"symbolic protest\" theory, under which he urges that\n\nhis refusal to comply with the department regulation should be\n\nprotected as expressive or symbolic conduct intended and likely\n\nto communicate his opposition to being compelled to \"speak\" by\n\nwearing the flag patch.\n\n               In Part 8 of this opinion we hold that Troster did not\n\ndemonstrate          a   likelihood       of     success       on    the    merits    of     his\n\ncompelled expression claim.                Even recognizing that in the wake of\n\nHurley    v.       Irish-American         Gay,       Lesbian   and    Bisexual       Group    of\n\nBoston,       115    S. Ct.       2338,   2344       (1995),    the   threshold       test    of\n\nexpressiveness necessary to raise a First Amendment compelled\n\nexpression          claim   is    no    longer       as   stringent    as    we   previously\n\nsuggested in Steirer by Steirer v. Bethlehem Area Sch. Dist., 987\nF.2d 989 (3d Cir. 1993), see infra at 9-11 & n.11, we believe\n\nthat     on    the       record    before      it     the    district       court    properly\n\nconcluded that the Department's flag patch regulation did not\n\nrequire correctional officers such as Troster to engage in any\n\nconduct sufficiently imbued with elements of communication that\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fthe   regulation         might      be     forbidden         by    the     First   Amendment's\n\nproscription against compelled speech.\n\n               With      respect      to     the       alternative         symbolic      protest\n\ntheory, we conclude in Part 17 that, under the particular facts\n\nof this case, Troster has not stated an analytically independent\n\nclaim     of     constitutional             violation.             One      who    violates    a\n\ngovernmental compulsion to speak or engage in expressive conduct\n\nmerely to express opposition to that compulsion on \"compelled\n\nexpression\" grounds engages in no independently constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct.              In such a case the appropriate rubric for a\n\nFirst Amendment claim is simply \"compelled expression,\" and that\n\nis therefore the sole free speech theory that we consider.                                    As\n\nnoted, it fails on the present record.                        Accordingly, the order of\n\nthe district court denying Troster's motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction must be affirmed.\n\n1. FACTS   AND   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n               Dieter Troster is a naturalized American who emigrated\n\nto the United States from Germany when he was in his early\n\ntwenties.        He    enlisted      in     the       U.S.   army,       went     to   Officers'\n\nCandidate School, became an officer, and was eventually promoted\n\nto the rank of Major.               In 1981 he retired after twenty years of\n\nservice, including time in Viet Nam.                              Two years later Troster\n\nsecured employment with SCI.                      He has since received promotions\n\ntaking     him        from   Corrections          Officer         Trainee    to    Corrections\n\nOfficer     2     with       the    rank     of       Sergeant.      His     duties     include\n\nsupervising           inmates      acting    as       janitors       and    directing     other\n\ncorrections officers in their assigned tasks. Troster is also a\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTraining Sergeant, and he thus serves as an example to lower\n\nranking corrections officers.\n\n            In 1991, the American Federation of State, County and\n\nMunicipal     Employees,    the     bargaining     representative      for   the\n\ncorrections officers, requested the Department to allow officers\n\nto wear an American flag patch on their uniforms.               The Department\n\nadopted a regulation allowing officers up through the rank of\n\nSergeant to wear an American flag patch on the right shoulder\n\nsleeve of their uniform shirts.             The patch authorized by the\n\nDepartment displays the flag with the star field oriented toward\n\nthe officer's back (with the star field in its customary position\n\nin the upper left corner of the flag).               Although the original\n\nregulation was permissive, on February 15, 1993 the Department\n\npromulgated new uniform regulations (effective March 15) that\n\nmandated display of the flag patch on the right sleeve of the\n\nuniform shirt, star field oriented toward the rear.\n\n            The Department adopts regulations concerning uniforms,\n\nincluding     the   flag    patch    regulation,     with   the     intent    of\n\nprojecting the image of a professional correctional force.                   The\n\ndistrict court found that such an image is important to the\n\noverall operations and security of SCI.               The presence of the\n\nAmerican flag patch is now one of the identifying features of a\n\ncorrections    officers's    uniform,      which   indicates,    the   district\n\ncourt found, that the wearer is authorized to exercise the lawful\n\npowers of corrections officers, including the use of firearms.\n\nThe district court accepted Superintendent Rosemeyer's contention\n\nthat the Department's interest in displaying the American flag as\n\n\n                                       5\n\fpart of the uniform is legitimate because it fosters loyalty and\n\nobedience to superior officers.\n\n           Almost immediately upon adoption of the mandatory flag\n\npatch regulation, Troster objected to being compelled to display\n\nthe American flag.          He believes that state-compelled display\n\ndesecrates    the   flag    and    debases    it.      Troster      considers     the\n\nrequired displays deeply objectionable not only because of his\n\nconviction that the American flag symbolizes freedom from state-\n\ncoerced political or patriotic speech, but also because, in his\n\nview,   displaying    the    flag    with    its    star    field    to    the   rear\n\nsignifies cowardice and retreat from the principles for which the\n\nflag stands.    Troster further believes that the \"New Flag Code\"\n\nResolution adopted by Congress in 1976, 36 U.S.C. §§ 173-177,\n\ndoes not authorize corrections officers to wear the flag as part\n\nof their uniform (although he does not press this argument on\n\nappeal).\n\n           In May 1993, in response to Troster's objections, the\n\nDepartment    decided    not   to    enforce    the    flag      patch    regulation\n\npending review by the Department's General Counsel.                       Thus, the\n\nregulation remained optional or unenforced from the spring of\n\n1991 to January 27, 1994, with few if any disciplinary problems\n\nresulting. Operations ran smoothly at SCI during this time.\n\n           Nevertheless,          despite     the      fact      that     Troster's\n\nperformance    as    a     corrections       officer       had    otherwise      been\n\ncompletely satisfactory, on January 20, 1994 the Superintendent\n\nof SCI notified Troster that the Department would begin enforcing\n\nthe flag patch requirement on January 27, and that he must comply\n\n\n                                       6\n\for face disciplinary proceedings.             Troster continued to refuse to\n\nwear the flag, and on January 26 he filed this 28 U.S.C. § 1983\n\naction    seeking    declaratory    and      injunctive     relief     against    the\n\nmandatory aspect of the Department's flag patch regulation.                       The\n\nnext day the Department ordered Troster to appear at a fact\n\nfinding meeting.\n\n            There, Troster was advised that his continuing refusal\n\nto comply with the regulation constituted gross insubordination\n\nand violated specific paragraphs of the Correctional Officer's\n\nCode of Ethics.        A disciplinary hearing was set for February 8.\n\nIn the interim, however, a short-term agreement between Troster's\n\nand the Department's counsel allowed Troster to continue working\n\nwithout     wearing      the   patch.         Except      for     that    temporary\n\ndispensation     for     Troster,     the    Department         has   enforced     the\n\nregulation uniformly since the end of January 1994.\n\n            On February 1, 1994, Troster moved for a preliminary\n\ninjunction against the Department's attempts to discipline him\n\nand against the mandatory aspect of the flag patch regulation on\n\nwhich those proceedings were based.               On February 3, the district\n\ncourt     held   a   hearing   on     this    motion,      at     which   time    the\n\nCorrections Department agreed to stay disciplinary proceedings\n\nagainst Troster until the court ruled on the injunction.\n\n            By   order    dated   March      18    the   district     court   denied\n\nTroster's motion.        The court concluded that Troster had failed to\n\ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits because neither\n\nthe flag patch regulation nor Troster's refusal to wear the patch\n\nwas     sufficiently     expressive     to    be    protectable       under      First\n\n\n                                        7\n\fAmendment free speech rights.                  Five days later, Troster moved for\n\nreconsideration or injunction pending appeal.                               Two days after\n\nthis motion the Corrections Department held a pre-disciplinary\n\nconference; four days later the district court denied Troster's\n\nrequest for reconsideration.                   On April 4 Troster filed a notice\n\nof appeal.      The next day, he moved in this court by motion for an\n\nemergency injunction pending appeal.                       Defendants notified Troster\n\nthat if he continued to refuse to wear the flag patch, he would\n\nbe suspended for five days commencing April 9.

When\n\ndetermining whether conduct is expressive for First Amendment\n\npurposes,     many     other    courts       and    commentators          have     also\n\ninterpreted    Spence     to    require      both    an   intent     to    convey     a\n\nparticularized message and a great likelihood that this message\n\nwill be understood.\n\n            Whether or not this reading of Spence was justified,0\n\nthe Supreme Court just this past term has made clear that \"a\n\nnarrow, succinctly articulable message is not a condition of\n\nconstitutional       protection,     which    if     confined   to    expressions\n\nconveying a `particularized message,' cf.

A particularized intent and a likelihood\nthat the message would be understood were present in that case,\nbut the Supreme Court did not say that those were always required\nfor expressive conduct. Rather, after discussing the context in\nwhich Spence's protest occurred, the next paragraph of the\nCourt's opinion \"noted, further, that [Spence's conduct] was not\nan act of mindless nihilism.\" Id. at 410, 94 S. Ct. at 2730. In\nconcluding the paragraph elaborating this observation, the Court\nsimply explained that in Spence's case, \"[a]n intent to convey a\nparticularized message was present, and in the surrounding\ncircumstances the likelihood was great that the message would be\nunderstood by those who viewed it.\" Id. at 410-11, 94 S.

Ct. at 2730.             This test for determining whether the flag\n\npatch requirement compels \"expression\" from Troster and the other\n\ncorrections      officers       is    a     fact-sensitive,         context       dependent\n\ninquiry.          And,     Troster's          contentions           to      the       contrary\n\nnotwithstanding, we apply this test not only to symbolic protest\n\ncases (see discussion infra) but also to cases alleging compelled\n\nexpressive conduct.        The burden of proof concerning this question\n\nis on Troster, and, as we now explain, he has not at this point\n\nmet his burden under Spence.\nb.\n\n            We note at the outset of our analysis that this case is\n\nunlike most of the Supreme Court's compelled expression cases in\n\nthat it does not involve actual verbal or written expression.

Even in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431\n\nU.S. 209, 97 S.

Here,     in\n\ncontrast, flag patch observers are presented with a symbol that\n\nhas various and somewhat imprecise ideas associated with it.\n\nCompletely aside from the question of misattribution, see, e.g.,\nHurley,   115       S.

Ct. 2667, 2676-80 (1988) (invalidating law\nrequiring   professional  fundraisers   to  disclose   to  donors\npercentage of contributions turned over to charities), these are\nmore properly viewed as \"compelled disclosure\" cases, rather than\n\"intellectual individualism\" cases like Barnette, Wooley, and\nAbood. See Harpaz, Intellectual Individualism, 64 TEX. L. REV. at\n818-19.\n\n\n                                              12\n\fprecise significance of the likelihood of misattribution\"), the\n\nrecord does not sustain the conclusion that the flag patch on the\n\ncorrectional      officers'     uniforms       will    relay      any        message\n\n(ideological or otherwise) to anyone; Troster has presented no\n\nevidence   that   it   is   likely   to    function      in   a   communicative\n\nfashion.\n\n           The    conduct     required    of   Troster    bears     a    slightly\n\ngreater resemblance to that demanded of the plaintiff in Lipp v.\n\nMorris, 579 F.2d 834 (3d Cir. 1978), where a high school student\n\nsuccessfully     challenged    the   requirement       that   she   \"show      full\n\nrespect to the flag while the pledge is being given merely by\n\nstanding at attention\" during the flag salute and recitation of\n\nthe Pledge of Allegiance.         Id. at 835 n.2 (emphases supplied).\n\nWe also recognize some similarity among the governmental purposes\n\nin Barnette, Lipp, and here:             in Barnette the state required\n\nstudents to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance\n\nin order to promote national unity, see 319 U.S. at 631 n.12, 63\n\nS. Ct. at 1182 n.12; in Lipp the state required the plaintiff to\n\nstand in order to demonstrate respect for the flag; and here the\n\nstate required Troster to wear the flag in part to foster loyalty\n\nand obedience to his superior officers.                Additionally, we may\n\nagree with Troster that the flag of the United States is an\n\n\"obviously     expressive     element,\"    Br.    of    Appellant       at    26-27\n\n(quoting Steirer, 987 F.2d at 995), and we are fully cognizant\nthat the flag is a unique symbol in our history, one \"[p]regnant\n\nwith expressive content.\"        Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 405,\n109 S. Ct. 2533, 2540 (1989).\n\n\n                                     13\n\f               Nevertheless, we think that the gap between Troster's\n\ncase and Lipp is not one that we may bridge on the present\n\nrecord. As the Supreme Court has admonished, not every action\n\ntaken with respect to the flag is expressive.                 Id.    Under the\n\ncircumstances in Lipp, the conduct required of the plaintiff\n\nplainly could be seen as a demonstrative act of respect for the\n\nflag shown by her (coerced) actions.            She was required to stand\n\nsilently at attention, displaying respect, while her classmates\n\nsaluted the flag.        The government had thus specifically required\n\nthat     she   engage   in   conduct   manifesting    an    attitude.    Here,\n\nhowever, it is not apparent from the record that the conduct\n\nrequired       of   Troster--passively      wearing   the     flag   patch--is\n\nsimilarly demonstrative of an attitude or belief.0              Rather, there\n\nis presently no basis for concluding that the requirement that\n\nTroster wear the flag patch on his uniform compels him in effect\n\n\"to profess any statement of belief or to engage in any ceremony\n\nof assent to one.\"           Barnette, 319 U.S. at 634, 63 S. Ct. at\n\n1183.0\n\n0\n We are aware--and if Troster establishes the communicative\nnature of the flag patch regulation at the final hearing the\ndistrict court should bear in mind--that in Wooley v. Maynard,\nthe Supreme Court recognized that \"[c]ompelling the affirmative\nact of a flag salute involved a more serious infringement upon\npersonal liberties than the passive act of carrying the state\nmotto on [one's] license plate, but\" it considered \"the\ndifference [to be] essentially one of degree.\" 430 U.S. at 715,\n97 S. Ct. at 1435 (quoted in Laurie Allen Gallancy, Teachers and\nthe Pledge of Allegiance, 57 U. CHI. L. REV. 929, 939 (1990)).\n0\n From the failure of the opinion in Lipp to mention \"record\nevidence that standing during the flag ceremonies conveyed a\nparticularized message,\" Br. of Appellant at 26, and the\napproving citation of Lipp in Steirer, 987 F.2d at 994, Troster\nargues that \"the Steirer court could not have enunciated a\n\n\n                                       14\n\f           Troster     was    one   of   an   entire   force      of   corrections\n\npersonnel required to wear the flag patch on their uniforms.\n\nEvidence at the hearing showed that the uniforms of a large\n\nnumber of organizations have flag patches on them.                        Troster,\n\nhowever,   presented    the    district       court   with   no    evidence   (for\n\nexample, surveys) suggesting that anyone (other than himself)\n\nwould be likely to view the wearing of the patch as communicative\n\nor expressive, or that people who wear such uniforms with such\n\nflag patches actually assert anything to anyone.                  Observers might\n\nperhaps infer that the wearer is patriotic, but Troster put on no\n\nevidence that observers would likely understand the patch or the\n\nwearer to be telling them anything about the wearers' beliefs.\n\nCf. Peter Meijes Tiersma, Nonverbal Communication and the Freedom\n\nof \"Speech\", 1993 WIS. L. REV. 1525, 1554 & n.122 (citing H.L.A.\n\nprinciple   that  required   record  evidence   to   support  the\nproposition that the act in question will be understood in a\nparticular fashion, as the District Court required in this case,\"\nBr. of Appellant at 26-27.      The district court, at the time\nproperly following Steirer, may have searched for too narrow a\nmessage in the act of wearing the flag patch.      See discussion\nsupra n.10 and accompanying text. However, neither that fact nor\nthe lack of citation to record evidence in the Lipp opinion\nrelieves Troster of the burden of showing that the flag patch\nregulation compelled him to engage in expressive conduct.     The\nstate-coerced conduct at issue in Lipp was a ceremonial\ngesture--\"standing at attention\"--occurring in the midst of even\nmore blatant expressions of respect for the flag, all confined to\na brief set period each school day. Here, the conduct at issue\nis the wearing of a small patch on a uniform sleeve throughout\nthe entire work day.    We do not agree with Troster that it is\n\"readily inferable,\" Br. of Appellant at 27, that wearing a flag\npatch on a corrections officer's uniform \"would be seen by most,\nif not all, observers as showing respect for the flag,\" id., and\nwe do not think it too great a burden on Troster's First\nAmendment interests to require him to come forth with some\nevidence to support his otherwise bare assertion that the flag\npatch regulation compels expressive conduct.\n\n\n                                         15\n\fHart, Signs & Words, 2 PHIL. Q. 59, 61-62 (1952), discussing\n\nwhether neighbor shutting windows in preparation for coming storm\n\nasserts   something      thereby,    and       concluding     \"no\")   [hereinafter\n\nTiersma, Nonverbal Communication].\n\n              We do not know whether survey data might be available\n\nto support Troster's expressive conduct claim.                 Perhaps Americans\n\n(or even an appropriate subset thereof, such as inmates and staff\n\nof and visitors to SCI) do in fact perceive people who wear (for\n\nexample) a Boy Scout, Girl Scout, or police uniform with a flag\n\npatch as expressing a patriotic or other ideological message or\n\nagreement therewith; perhaps not.\n\n              Our duty, however, is to evaluate Troster's likelihood\n\nof success on the basis of the evidence presented.                      And as we\n\ndiscuss   below,    see    infra     at    18-21,       the   Supreme   Court    has\n\ncautioned that the First Amendment should not be held to shield a\n\nlimitless variety of conduct from governmental regulation.                  Thus,\n\nsympathetic as we may be to Troster's genuine patriotism as well\n\nas with his predicament, we cannot accept his suggestion that we\n\nhold, as a matter of \"common sense\" and law, that the mere act of\n\nwearing   a    uniform    with   a   flag       patch    on   it   constitutes   an\n\nexpressive or communicative \"use\" of the flag, cf. Spence, 418\nU.S. at 410, 94 S. Ct. at 2730 (“The Court for decades has\n\nrecognized the communicative connotations of the use of flags.”)\n\n(emphasis supplied), within the scope of the First Amendment.\n\nc.\n\n              In short, Troster has not at this time met his burden.\n\nThe district court's factual conclusion that \"[w]earing the flag\n\n\n                                          16\n\fpatch on a corrections officer's uniform . . . does not convey\n\nany agreement or disagreement with all or any of the many things\n\na flag may symbolize, or the Department's view of the flag,\" op.\n\nat 21, App. at 124, is sufficiently supported by the current\n\nrecord.   Accordingly,         we   hold    that       Troster     has    not    shown   a\n\nreasonable likelihood of success on the merits with respect to\n\nhis compelled expression claim, for he has not made the necessary\n\nthreshold showing that he was (probably) coerced to engage in\n\nexpressive conduct.          Thus, Troster presented the district court\n\nwith no basis to have granted him a preliminary injunction.\n\n3. VIABILITY   OF THE   SYMBOLIC PROTEST THEORY   IN   THESE CIRCUMSTANCES\n\na.\n\n           Troster's         alternative        theory      is     that,     given   the\n\ncircumstances, his refusal to wear the flag patch required by the\n\nDepartment constituted symbolic expressive conduct protected by\n\nthe First Amendment.0          This raises the question whether Troster\n\ncan present both the compelled expression and symbolic protest\n\nclaims,   that    is,     whether    he    has    an    analytically       independent\n\nsymbolic speech claim?          While we do not gainsay that a refusal to\n\ncomply with a governmental directive may in some cases amount to\n\nsymbolic protest covered by the First Amendment, this is not one\n\nof those cases.\n\n           Our     narrow     conclusion        does    not      ignore    the   Supreme\n\nCourt's historical solicitude for free speech claims, its high\n\n0\nTechnically the First Amendment is inoperative against the\nstates, but its strictures are nonetheless binding on the states\nvia the Fourteenth Amendment.     For simplicity, however, this\nopinion frequently refers only to the First Amendment.\n\n\n                                           17\n\fregard for a \"preferred right[],\" see, e.g., Smith v. People, 361\n\nU.S. 147, 169, 80 S. Ct. 215, 227 (Douglas, J., concurring),\n\nreaffirmed in several of the Court's recent decisions.0                             But we\n\nare satisfied that where, as here, a person seeks only to express\n\nopposition     to     what   he   or    she    perceives       as     a    governmental\n\ncompulsion to engage in speech or expressive conduct, refusing to\n\ncomply with the very governmental compulsion at issue is not\n\nprotected as symbolic protest under the First Amendment, for that\n\ntheory   obscures      the   nature     of    the    interests      at     stake.      Put\n\ndifferently, in circumstances such as these where there is a\n\ncolorable claim that a governmental compulsion violates the First\n\nAmendment's     restrictions       on    governmentally            compelled      speech,\n\nthere    are    not    two    potentially        viable      arguments        that     the\n\nConstitution's free speech guarantees protect a person's refusal\n\nto comply with the governmental compulsion solely because of\n\nopposition to the compulsion.                The compulsion to \"speak\" may be\n\naddressed either as a symbolic protest claim, or as a compelled\n\nspeech claim, but not both.             Here, as shall be apparent, the most\n\napt rubric is compelled expression.\n\n              Our   conclusion    that       Troster    may    not        raise   both   a\n\ncompelled expression claim and a symbolic protest claim grounded\n\nsolely   in    objection     to   compelled         speech    is    animated      by   the\n\ncaution with which the Supreme Court has instructed courts to\n\nview symbolic conduct claims.             The Court has warned that not all\n\n0\nIn the 1994-1995 term, the Supreme Court ruled on eight free\nspeech claims. \"In seven of eight First Amendment-related cases,\nthe party asserting free speech rights prevailed.\" 64 U.S.L.W.\n3055 (Aug. 1, 1995).\n\n\n                                          18\n\fconduct, even conduct involving the flag of the United States, is\n\n\"expressive\" for purposes of the First Amendment.                            See Texas v.\n\nJohnson, 491 U.S. at 405, 109 S. Ct. at 2540.                         We do not presume\n\nthat Troster's refusal to wear the flag patch on his correctional\n\nofficer's uniform was not expressive as a factual matter.                                 See\n\nalso infra at 22.         Rather, we believe that as a legal matter, the\n\nFirst    Amendment       does     not    protect     any      \"right\"      to    disobey    a\n\ngovernmental         compulsion     for    the      sole      purpose      of    expressing\n\nprotest against the compulsion on the grounds that it allegedly\n\nrequires one to engage in speech or expressive conduct.\n\n               As     Professor     Tiersma        has     explained,        a    recurring\n\njurisprudential concern \"is that the Free Speech Clause may be\n\ninvoked by anyone who violates a law, claiming to protest against\n\nit.\"    Tiersma, Nonverbal Communication, 1993 WIS. L. REV. at 1585.\n\nFor    example,       Tiersma     recounts    that       in   Cox    v.    Louisiana      the\n\nSupreme    Court       stated     that    \"[o]ne     would     not    be    justified      in\n\nignoring the familiar red light because this was thought to be a\n\nmeans of social protest.\"                Id. (quoting Cox, 379 U.S. 536, 554,\n\n85    S. Ct.    453,     464    (1965)).          Similarly,       Justice       Scalia   has\n\nobserved       that    \"virtually        every     law     restricts       conduct,       and\n\nvirtually       any    prohibited        conduct     can      be     performed      for    an\n\nexpressive purpose--if only expressive of the fact that the actor\ndisagrees with the prohibition.\"                   Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc.,\n\n501 U.S. 560, 576, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 2466 (1991) (Scalia, J.,\n\nconcurring)         (emphasis     supplied)       (cited      in    Tiersma,      Nonverbal\nCommunication, 1993 WIS. L. REV. at 1585-86).                           See also, e.g.,\n\nState of Washington v. Adams, 479 P.2d 148 (Wash. App. 1971)\n\n\n                                             19\n\f(rejecting defendant's contention that his using a set net in\n\nviolation      of    regulatory     salmon       fishing    statute    was   \"symbolic\n\nspeech\"      protected      by   First     Amendment       where   defendant's     only\n\npurpose in using the net was to demonstrate the irrationality of\n\nthe statute prohibiting its use).\n\n              As     the    foregoing       discussion       suggests,       permitting\n\nparties to pursue a claim that the First Amendment grants them a\n\nright to violate a law solely as a means of publicizing their\n\nobjection      to    that    law    would    burden    courts      with     essentially\n\nduplicative First Amendment claims.                 We believe that this problem\n\nis particularly acute where individuals violating a governmental\n\ncompulsion to engage in some behavior merely assert that their\n\nviolation          expresses       their     belief        that     the      compulsion\n\nunconstitutionally requires them to speak or engage in expressive\n\nconduct.       In such circumstances, both the compelled speech and\n\nthe       putative    symbolic      protest       theories        involve    the   same\n\nobjection:      the individual does not want to be used by government\n\nas    a    mouthpiece       to   disseminate       ideological      messages.       The\n\nsymbolic protest theory simply adds a desire to communicate this\n\nopposition to others.\n\n              The addition of a constitutional symbolic protest claim\n\nto a compelled speech claim in this circumstance would only serve\n\nto give individuals an additional yet futile bite at the apple.0\n\n0\nLimited as our powers of imagination may be, we nevertheless\ncannot conceive of circumstances in which individuals' symbolic\nprotest claims grounded solely in refusal to engage in allegedly\ncoerced expressive conduct could succeed where the root\nexpressive conduct claim failed. If government had an interest\nsufficient under the First Amendment to justify compelling\n\n                                            20\n\fWe do not believe that the Constitution's free speech guarantees\n\ncountenance    such    a    waste    of   judicial       resources       (and   of    the\n\ngovernmental    resources      needed      to        defend   such      claims).      It\n\ndistorts the constitutional inquiry to shift the focus away from\n\nthe   government's     interest     in    enforcing       its    expressive-conduct\n\ncompulsion (despite opposition thereto), to focus instead on the\n\nindividual's interest in communicating opposition by violating\n\nthe compulsion, as Troster's dual theory would do.                         Rather, we\n\nbelieve that, in circumstances such as these, the goal of the\n\nindividual's conduct is properly characterized with regard to the\n\nFirst     Amendment    as    avoiding          the     compulsion,       rather      than\n\nexpressing disagreement with it.\n\n            In sum, symbolic protest claims are not analytically\n\nindependent     of    compelled      expressive         conduct      claims     in   the\n\ncircumstances that we have described.                     Courts must therefore\n\ndetermine which theory more accurately captures the essence of\n\nthe constitutional objection.             Cf. Walters v. National Ass'n of\n\nRadiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 335, 105 S. Ct. 3180, 3196-97\n\n(1985) (holding that free speech claim essentially duplicating\n\nthe     objection    presented      in    due    process        claim    was    of   \"no\n\nindependent significance\").              In this case, it is the compelled\n\nexpressive conduct claim.           We hold that Troster's conduct was not\n\nconstitutionally protected as a means of symbolically expressing\n\n\nindividuals to deliver ideological messages despite their\nopposition, it seems that interest would also be sufficient to\njustify requiring the individual to deliver the message despite\nhis or her desire to communicate that opposition (to either the\nmessage or the compulsion) by refusing to deliver it.\n\n\n                                          21\n\fopposition, on compelled expression grounds, to the expressive\n\nconduct that Troster perceived the flag patch requirement to\n\ncompel.\n\nb.\n\n              This     holding    does    not    require    us     to    reject    the\n\nreasoning of Leonard v. City of Columbus, 705 F.2d 1299 (11th\n\nCir.    1983),   upon     which    Troster      relies    and    which   bears    some\n\nfactual similarity to the instant case.                  In Leonard, a number of\n\npolice officers were disciplined for appearing in uniform without\n\nthe    flag    patch    required     by    departmental         regulations.       The\n\nofficers had staged a public rally at which they removed their\n\npatches to protest racial discrimination within the police force.\n\nThe court of appeals held that the officers' conduct amounted to\n\nsymbolic speech protected by the First Amendment.                        See id. at\n\n1304.\n\n              Troster suggests that this holding at the very least\n\nstrongly counsels for a ruling in his favor.                     Leonard, however,\n\nis unlike this case in a crucial respect, which we believe is\n\nwhat the district court was driving at when it distinguished\n\nTroster's situation from Leonard on the grounds that Troster\nlacked an \"underlying political or patriotic message.\"                     Op. at 21\n\n(JA 000124).\n\n              In Leonard, although the conduct at issue (the means of\n\nthe     officers'      protest)     was    violation       of     the    flag     patch\n\nregulation, the object of the protest was not the regulation\n\nitself, but rather discrimination by the Department.                      The reason\n\nfor     the   protest     was     that    the   Department's       alleged      racial\n\n\n                                          22\n\fdiscrimination violated their rights to equal protection of the\n\nlaws, not a belief by the officers that the regulation compelled\n\nthem to engage in expressive conduct in violation of their First\n\nAmendment rights.      Thus, the officers were engaged in speech for\n\nsome reason other than protesting being used as a governmental\n\nmouthpiece.\n\n            As in Leonard, the means of Troster's protest was also\n\nviolation of a departmental flag patch regulation.                       In contrast\n\nto   the   officers'   protest    in    Leonard,       however,    the    object   of\n\nTroster's protest was the regulation itself.                      The reason for\n\nTroster's     violation     was        that     the      regulation        allegedly\n\nunconstitutionally compelled him to \"speak\" by wearing the patch\n\non his uniform. Thus, even if Troster engaged in symbolic speech\n\nby violating the flag patch regulation, he did so solely for the\n\npurpose of protesting the fact that (in his view) the regulation\n\nimproperly compelled him to \"speak.\"             Hence, it is apparent that\n\nthe reason for Troster's conduct--namely, his violation of the\n\nDepartment's flag patch regulation, which was the basis for the\n\ndisciplinary proceedings that he seeks to enjoin permanently--the\n\nonly point that he was trying to make, was that the regulation\n\nviolated his First Amendment right not to be a mouthpiece for the\n\ngovernment.    Troster's   symbolic          protest    claim     is   thus   wholly\n\nderivative from his compelled expression claim, which is the\n\nessence of his objection to the flag patch regulation, and his\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\ffree       speech    objection       should    accordingly          be    subject         only    to\n\ncompelled expression analysis.0\n\n               Similarly,        the      symbolic       protest    claim       in    Spence      v.\n\nWashington,          418      U.S.   at    405,     94     S. Ct.    at     2727,         was    not\n\nderivative          of    a   compelled      expression       claim.         There,         Spence\n\ndisplayed an American flag with peace signs attached in order to\n\nprotest American violence in Cambodia and at Kent State.                                        After\n\nbeing       arrested       for   violating     a     law    that    prohibited            improper\n\ndisplay of the American flag, his successful claim was that he\n\nhad    a    First        Amendment     right   to    express       his    message         in     that\n\nfashion, and that the state could not constitutionally punish him\n\nfor doing so. Spence's means of expression was a violation of the\n\nflag display statute, but the reason for his protest, the message\n\nhe sought to convey, was not a belief that the flag display\n\nstatute       (a     prohibitory          measure)        compelled       him        to    express\n\n\n0\nThis derivative relationship would not be present in the case of\na Rosa Parks sitting in the front of a segregated bus. If her\nactions were analyzed as expressive conduct, her message would\nnot be that the ordinance requiring her to sit at the back of the\nbus was forcing her to say something. She would not be simply\nprotesting   being   used as     a  mouthpiece   to   deliver   some\ngovernmental message.     Her message would be that the Jim Crow\nregime was denying her the equal protection of the laws. Thus,\neven if she were to raise both an equal protection and a symbolic\nprotest   claim    against   the   governmental    compulsion,   her\nmessage--conveyed     by    her    violation    of    the    seating\nordinance--would be more than simply opposition to being forced\nby the ordinance to \"say\" something, and thus she would have only\none colorable free speech claim, and symbolic protest (rather\nthan compelled expression) would be the appropriate mode of\nanalysis.   While the seating requirement certainly reflected a\nracist attitude or view about the dignity and social status of\nblack Americans, objection merely to compelled \"speech\" simply\nwould not have been the only message Rosa Parks sought to convey\nby her actions.\n\n\n                                               24\n\fsomething that he did not want to say.     He was not protesting\n\nbeing forced to act as a mouthpiece for government.       Thus, the\n\nfree speech claim in Spence lacks the duplicative quality of\n\nTroster's claim(s), and that case does not help him establish\n\nindependent viability of his symbolic protest theory.0\n\nc.\n\n          Our conclusion that Troster cannot press both theories\n\nis further supported by the Supreme Court's treatment of the\n\nFirst Amendment claims in Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. at 705, 97\n\nS. Ct. at 1428.   The plaintiffs in that case were two Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses who objected on political and religious grounds to\n\nbeing required to display New Hampshire's state motto--\"Live Free\n\nor Die\"--that was imprinted on their license plate.      After being\n\nprosecuted several times for covering the motto, the Maynards\n\nchallenged the constitutionality of the state law making it a\n\ncrime to obscure the motto, seeking injunctive relief prohibiting\n\nfuture prosecutions for their covering the motto (usually with\n\n\n0\nIndeed, even a person who burns a flag to protest a statute\nprohibiting flag burning would not have the same derivative\nstructure to his or her claim.      Certainly, the means of the\nsymbolic protest would be a violation of the very law that is the\nobject of the protest. But the reason for the protest would be a\nbelief that the statute unconstitutionally prohibited him or her\nfrom speaking; while there may be viewpoint discrimination at\nwork, there is no colorable compelled speech claim there.      By\nprohibiting flag burning, the statute simply does not require the\nhypothetical banner burner to express anything. So there is just\none free speech claim in this scenario:       that government is\nunconstitutionally prohibiting an individual from speaking his or\nher mind.    The flag burner cannot claim that the prohibition\nforces her to act as a mouthpiece for government, and there is\nthus no difficulty in letting the individual proceed with a\nsymbolic protest claim.\n\n\n                               25\n\fred reflective tape). The Maynards argued both that their act of\n\ncovering the motto was constitutionally protected because it was\n\nnecessary for them to avoid a compelled affirmation of belief,\n\nand that their act constituted protected symbolic speech not\n\noutweighed by sufficient state interests.                  A three-judge district\n\ncourt declined to \"consider whether their First Amendment right\n\nto be free from a required affirmation of belief is implicated,\"\n\nconcluding instead that the Maynards' affirmative act of covering\n\nthe motto was constitutionally protected expressive conduct.                          406\n\nF. Supp. 1381, 1386 (1976).\n\n            On    appeal,    the    Supreme        Court    took   a    dramatically\n\ndifferent approach to the case.              The Court \"found it unnecessary\n\nto pass on the `symbolic speech' issue,\" concluding that there\n\nwere   \"more     appropriate   First    Amendment          grounds\"    on     which   to\n\naffirm the judgement of the district court.                  430 U.S. at 713, 97\n\nS. Ct. at 1434. The Court explained:\n          We turn instead to what in our view is the essence of\n          [the Maynards'] objection to the requirement that they\n          display the motto `Live Free or Die' on their\n          automobile license plates. . . .    We are thus faced\n          with   the   question   of  whether   the   State   may\n          constitutionally require an individual to participate\n          in the dissemination of an ideological message by\n          displaying it on his private property in a manner and\n          for the express purpose that it be observed and read by\n          the public. We hold that the State may not do so.\n\nId., 97 S. Ct. at 1434-35 (emphasis supplied).\n            While    the    Court    did     not    expressly      rule       that    the\n\nMaynards had no viable symbolic protest claim, its opinion cast\n\ngrave doubt on the prospects of that argument.                     As then-Justice\n\nRehnquist      interpreted     the     majority        opinion,        \"the     Court[]\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\fimplicit[ly] recogni[zed] that there is no protected `symbolic\n\nspeech' in this case . . . .\"                     Id. at 720, 97 S. Ct. at 1438\n\n(Rehnquist,         J.,    dissenting).               Of     particular       note    is      the\n\nmajority's assertion that had the state granted the Maynards'\n\nrequest    for      special     license      plates        not   containing         the     state\n\nmotto, the act of displaying them would not be \"sufficiently\n\ncommunicative to sustain a claim of symbolic expression.\"                                 Id. at\n\n713 n.10, 97 S.

This observation alone could be\n\nvirtually dispositive of Troster's symbolic protest claim.\n\n              The    Court      stated      in    Wooley      that     the    display       of   a\n\nlicense      plate    without      the      state      motto     would       not   amount        to\n\nconstitutionally protected expressive conduct, see id. at 713\n\nn.10,   97    S.

Similarly, since Troster opposes\n\nthe flag patch regulation because he believes that it coerces him\n\nto engage in \"speech\" (actually, expressive conduct), we believe\n\nthat his conduct in wearing his correctional officer's uniform\n\nwithout the flag patch, which is required and is in fact worn by\n\nall the other guards, would not be protected symbolic speech even\n\nif, as he argued before the district court, his contemporaneous\n\nand   repeated       explanations        would        insure     that    observers          would\n\nlikely understand the reason for his refusal.\n\n\n                                                 27\n\f             In reaching this conclusion, we note that the Supreme\n\nCourt in Wooley did not contest the evidence and the district\n\ncourt's conclusion, see id., that the people of New Hampshire\n\nwould most likely understand the significance of the Maynards'\n\nacts. Rather, the Court concluded that the act of displaying\n\n\"expurgated    plates\"      would   not    \"sustain   a   claim       of   symbolic\n\nexpression.\"      430 U.S. at 713 n.10, 97 S. Ct. at 1434 n.10\n\n(emphasis    supplied).       The   fair    implication        of   this   is    that\n\ncertain conduct might be expressive in fact yet not protected by\n\nthe First Amendment as symbolic expression.\n\n             In determining that Troster's conduct falls into this\n\ncategory, we emphasize that the Supreme Court focused on what it\n\ntermed \"the essence\" of the Wooley's constitutional claim against\n\nthe anti-defacement statute.          The basis of the Maynards' claim\n\nwas, constitutionally speaking, not that the law in question\n\nprohibited them from \"communicat[ing] affirmative opposition to\n\nthe motto.\" Id.        Rather, the essence of their constitutional\n\nobjection was that the State was requiring individuals to help\n\ndisseminate an ideological message by displaying it on their\n\nprivate property. See id., 97 S. Ct. at 1434-35.                    This is not a\n\nsymbolic protest issue, but a compelled expression issue, which\n\nis how the Court treated it.\n\n             Coming full circle, we believe that, as a matter of\n\nlaw,   the   essence   of    Troster's     objection      to    the   flag      patch\n\nregulation is not that it limits his ability to protest being\n\nused as a governmental mouthpiece.             Rather, the essence of his\n\nclaim is reflected by the stated reason for his protest:                    Troster\n\n\n                                      28\n\fbelieves   that      the    regulation    in    question    unconstitutionally\n\nrequires him to engage in expressive conduct in violation of his\n\nFirst Amendment rights.          This is a colorable compelled expression\n\nclaim,   and    that   is    how   we   have   analyzed     his   constitutional\n\nchallenge to the Department's regulation in Part III supra.\n\n           In       sum,    because     the    message     Troster    wishes   to\n\ncommunicate is simply opposition to the Department's flag patch\n\nregulation     on    compelled     expression    grounds,     and    because   his\n\npreferred method of communicating this message is violation of\n\nthe regulation, compelled speech analysis is the proper vehicle\n\nfor his constitutional challenge.               Since we have rejected that\n\nclaim, the order of the district court denying Troster's motion\n\nfor a preliminary injunction will be affirmed.\n\n           The injunction we granted Troster pending this appeal\n\nwill be vacated. Parties to bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f",

He filed\n\nsuit   in   the    District    Court       for    the     Western     District     of\nPennsylvania      against    the   Pennsylvania           State     Department     of\n\nCorrections,      its   Commissioner        Joseph      D.    Lehman,     and     SCI\n\nSuperintendent     Fredric    A.   Rosemeyer,          seeking     injunctive     and\n\ndeclaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. § 1983.                    After holding an\n\nevidentiary hearing, the district court denied Troster's request\n\nfor a preliminary injunction.              The Pennsylvania Department of\n\nCorrections then ordered Troster suspended for five days for\n\ngross insubordination.        This court granted an emergency motion\n\n\n\n                                       2\n\ffor an injunction pending appeal, and Troster has remained on the\n\njob.   Troster has appealed the district court's order denying him\n\na preliminary injunction.\n\n               Troster        advances         two        theories     to     support        his\n\nallegations that the threatened disciplinary action violates his\n\nrights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.                                   First, he\n\nadvances       a     \"compelled        speech\"       argument--that        the    flag   patch\n\nregulation that he refuses to observe unconstitutionally compels\n\nhim to engage in expressive or symbolic conduct.                                  Second, he\n\npresses a \"symbolic protest\" theory, under which he urges that\n\nhis refusal to comply with the department regulation should be\n\nprotected as expressive or symbolic conduct intended and likely\n\nto communicate his opposition to being compelled to \"speak\" by\n\nwearing the flag patch.\n\n               In Part 8 of this opinion we hold that Troster did not\n\ndemonstrate          a   likelihood       of     success       on    the    merits    of     his\n\ncompelled expression claim.                Even recognizing that in the wake of\n\nHurley    v.

One      who    violates    a\n\ngovernmental compulsion to speak or engage in expressive conduct\n\nmerely to express opposition to that compulsion on \"compelled\n\nexpression\" grounds engages in no independently constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct.              In such a case the appropriate rubric for a\n\nFirst Amendment claim is simply \"compelled expression,\" and that\n\nis therefore the sole free speech theory that we consider.                                    As\n\nnoted, it fails on the present record.                        Accordingly, the order of\n\nthe district court denying Troster's motion for a preliminary\n\ninjunction must be affirmed.\n\n1. FACTS   AND   PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n               Dieter Troster is a naturalized American who emigrated\n\nto the United States from Germany when he was in his early\n\ntwenties.        He    enlisted      in     the       U.S.   army,       went     to   Officers'\n\nCandidate School, became an officer, and was eventually promoted\n\nto the rank of Major.               In 1981 he retired after twenty years of\n\nservice, including time in Viet Nam.                              Two years later Troster\n\nsecured employment with SCI.                      He has since received promotions\n\ntaking     him        from   Corrections          Officer         Trainee    to    Corrections\n\nOfficer     2     with       the    rank     of       Sergeant.      His     duties     include\n\nsupervising           inmates      acting    as       janitors       and    directing     other\n\ncorrections officers in their assigned tasks. Troster is also a\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fTraining Sergeant, and he thus serves as an example to lower\n\nranking corrections officers.\n\n            In 1991, the American Federation of State, County and\n\nMunicipal     Employees,    the     bargaining     representative      for   the\n\ncorrections officers, requested the Department to allow officers\n\nto wear an American flag patch on their uniforms.               The Department\n\nadopted a regulation allowing officers up through the rank of\n\nSergeant to wear an American flag patch on the right shoulder\n\nsleeve of their uniform shirts.             The patch authorized by the\n\nDepartment displays the flag with the star field oriented toward\n\nthe officer's back (with the star field in its customary position\n\nin the upper left corner of the flag).               Although the original\n\nregulation was permissive, on February 15, 1993 the Department\n\npromulgated new uniform regulations (effective March 15) that\n\nmandated display of the flag patch on the right sleeve of the\n\nuniform shirt, star field oriented toward the rear.\n\n            The Department adopts regulations concerning uniforms,\n\nincluding     the   flag    patch    regulation,     with   the     intent    of\n\nprojecting the image of a professional correctional force.                   The\n\ndistrict court found that such an image is important to the\n\noverall operations and security of SCI.               The presence of the\n\nAmerican flag patch is now one of the identifying features of a\n\ncorrections    officers's    uniform,      which   indicates,    the   district\n\ncourt found, that the wearer is authorized to exercise the lawful\n\npowers of corrections officers, including the use of firearms.\n\nThe district court accepted Superintendent Rosemeyer's contention\n\nthat the Department's interest in displaying the American flag as\n\n\n                                       5\n\fpart of the uniform is legitimate because it fosters loyalty and\n\nobedience to superior officers.\n\n           Almost immediately upon adoption of the mandatory flag\n\npatch regulation, Troster objected to being compelled to display\n\nthe American flag.          He believes that state-compelled display\n\ndesecrates    the   flag    and    debases    it.      Troster      considers     the\n\nrequired displays deeply objectionable not only because of his\n\nconviction that the American flag symbolizes freedom from state-\n\ncoerced political or patriotic speech, but also because, in his\n\nview,   displaying    the    flag    with    its    star    field    to    the   rear\n\nsignifies cowardice and retreat from the principles for which the\n\nflag stands.    Troster further believes that the \"New Flag Code\"\n\nResolution adopted by Congress in 1976, 36 U.S.C. §§ 173-177,\n\ndoes not authorize corrections officers to wear the flag as part\n\nof their uniform (although he does not press this argument on\n\nappeal).\n\n           In May 1993, in response to Troster's objections, the\n\nDepartment    decided    not   to    enforce    the    flag      patch    regulation\n\npending review by the Department's General Counsel.                       Thus, the\n\nregulation remained optional or unenforced from the spring of\n\n1991 to January 27, 1994, with few if any disciplinary problems\n\nresulting. Operations ran smoothly at SCI during this time.\n\n           Nevertheless,          despite     the      fact      that     Troster's\n\nperformance    as    a     corrections       officer       had    otherwise      been\n\ncompletely satisfactory, on January 20, 1994 the Superintendent\n\nof SCI notified Troster that the Department would begin enforcing\n\nthe flag patch requirement on January 27, and that he must comply\n\n\n                                       6\n\for face disciplinary proceedings.             Troster continued to refuse to\n\nwear the flag, and on January 26 he filed this 28 U.S.C. § 1983\n\naction    seeking    declaratory    and      injunctive     relief     against    the\n\nmandatory aspect of the Department's flag patch regulation.                       The\n\nnext day the Department ordered Troster to appear at a fact\n\nfinding meeting.\n\n            There, Troster was advised that his continuing refusal\n\nto comply with the regulation constituted gross insubordination\n\nand violated specific paragraphs of the Correctional Officer's\n\nCode of Ethics.        A disciplinary hearing was set for February 8.\n\nIn the interim, however, a short-term agreement between Troster's\n\nand the Department's counsel allowed Troster to continue working\n\nwithout     wearing      the   patch.         Except      for     that    temporary\n\ndispensation     for     Troster,     the    Department         has   enforced     the\n\nregulation uniformly since the end of January 1994.\n\n            On February 1, 1994, Troster moved for a preliminary\n\ninjunction against the Department's attempts to discipline him\n\nand against the mandatory aspect of the flag patch regulation on\n\nwhich those proceedings were based.               On February 3, the district\n\ncourt     held   a   hearing   on     this    motion,      at     which   time    the\n\nCorrections Department agreed to stay disciplinary proceedings\n\nagainst Troster until the court ruled on the injunction.\n\n            By   order    dated   March      18    the   district     court   denied\n\nTroster's motion.        The court concluded that Troster had failed to\n\ndemonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits because neither\n\nthe flag patch regulation nor Troster's refusal to wear the patch\n\nwas     sufficiently     expressive     to    be    protectable       under      First\n\n\n                                        7\n\fAmendment free speech rights.                  Five days later, Troster moved for\n\nreconsideration or injunction pending appeal.                               Two days after\n\nthis motion the Corrections Department held a pre-disciplinary\n\nconference; four days later the district court denied Troster's\n\nrequest for reconsideration.                   On April 4 Troster filed a notice\n\nof appeal.      The next day, he moved in this court by motion for an\n\nemergency injunction pending appeal.                       Defendants notified Troster\n\nthat if he continued to refuse to wear the flag patch, he would\n\nbe suspended for five days commencing April 9.                               On April 8, a\n\nmotions   panel       of    this    court      granted       Troster's      motion     for    an\n\ninjunction pending appeal.

She was required to stand\n\nsilently at attention, displaying respect, while her classmates\n\nsaluted the flag.        The government had thus specifically required\n\nthat     she   engage   in   conduct   manifesting    an    attitude.    Here,\n\nhowever, it is not apparent from the record that the conduct\n\nrequired       of   Troster--passively      wearing   the     flag   patch--is\n\nsimilarly demonstrative of an attitude or belief.0              Rather, there\n\nis presently no basis for concluding that the requirement that\n\nTroster wear the flag patch on his uniform compels him in effect\n\n\"to profess any statement of belief or to engage in any ceremony\n\nof assent to one.\"           Barnette, 319 U.S. at 634, 63 S. Ct. at\n\n1183.0\n\n0\n We are aware--and if Troster establishes the communicative\nnature of the flag patch regulation at the final hearing the\ndistrict court should bear in mind--that in Wooley v. Maynard,\nthe Supreme Court recognized that \"[c]ompelling the affirmative\nact of a flag salute involved a more serious infringement upon\npersonal liberties than the passive act of carrying the state\nmotto on [one's] license plate, but\" it considered \"the\ndifference [to be] essentially one of degree.\" 430 U.S. at 715,\n97 S. Ct. at 1435 (quoted in Laurie Allen Gallancy, Teachers and\nthe Pledge of Allegiance, 57 U. CHI. L. REV. 929, 939 (1990)).\n0\n From the failure of the opinion in Lipp to mention \"record\nevidence that standing during the flag ceremonies conveyed a\nparticularized message,\" Br. of Appellant at 26, and the\napproving citation of Lipp in Steirer, 987 F.2d at 994, Troster\nargues that \"the Steirer court could not have enunciated a\n\n\n                                       14\n\f           Troster     was    one   of   an   entire   force      of   corrections\n\npersonnel required to wear the flag patch on their uniforms.\n\nEvidence at the hearing showed that the uniforms of a large\n\nnumber of organizations have flag patches on them.                        Troster,\n\nhowever,   presented    the    district       court   with   no    evidence   (for\n\nexample, surveys) suggesting that anyone (other than himself)\n\nwould be likely to view the wearing of the patch as communicative\n\nor expressive, or that people who wear such uniforms with such\n\nflag patches actually assert anything to anyone.                  Observers might\n\nperhaps infer that the wearer is patriotic, but Troster put on no\n\nevidence that observers would likely understand the patch or the\n\nwearer to be telling them anything about the wearers' beliefs.\n\nCf. Peter Meijes Tiersma, Nonverbal Communication and the Freedom\n\nof \"Speech\", 1993 WIS. L. REV. 1525, 1554 & n.122 (citing H.L.A.\n\nprinciple   that  required   record  evidence   to   support  the\nproposition that the act in question will be understood in a\nparticular fashion, as the District Court required in this case,\"\nBr. of Appellant at 26-27.      The district court, at the time\nproperly following Steirer, may have searched for too narrow a\nmessage in the act of wearing the flag patch.      See discussion\nsupra n.10 and accompanying text. However, neither that fact nor\nthe lack of citation to record evidence in the Lipp opinion\nrelieves Troster of the burden of showing that the flag patch\nregulation compelled him to engage in expressive conduct.     The\nstate-coerced conduct at issue in Lipp was a ceremonial\ngesture--\"standing at attention\"--occurring in the midst of even\nmore blatant expressions of respect for the flag, all confined to\na brief set period each school day. Here, the conduct at issue\nis the wearing of a small patch on a uniform sleeve throughout\nthe entire work day.    We do not agree with Troster that it is\n\"readily inferable,\" Br. of Appellant at 27, that wearing a flag\npatch on a corrections officer's uniform \"would be seen by most,\nif not all, observers as showing respect for the flag,\" id., and\nwe do not think it too great a burden on Troster's First\nAmendment interests to require him to come forth with some\nevidence to support his otherwise bare assertion that the flag\npatch regulation compels expressive conduct.\n\n\n                                         15\n\fHart, Signs & Words, 2 PHIL. Q. 59, 61-62 (1952), discussing\n\nwhether neighbor shutting windows in preparation for coming storm\n\nasserts   something      thereby,    and       concluding     \"no\")   [hereinafter\n\nTiersma, Nonverbal Communication].\n\n              We do not know whether survey data might be available\n\nto support Troster's expressive conduct claim.                 Perhaps Americans\n\n(or even an appropriate subset thereof, such as inmates and staff\n\nof and visitors to SCI) do in fact perceive people who wear (for\n\nexample) a Boy Scout, Girl Scout, or police uniform with a flag\n\npatch as expressing a patriotic or other ideological message or\n\nagreement therewith; perhaps not.\n\n              Our duty, however, is to evaluate Troster's likelihood\n\nof success on the basis of the evidence presented.                      And as we\n\ndiscuss   below,    see    infra     at    18-21,       the   Supreme   Court    has\n\ncautioned that the First Amendment should not be held to shield a\n\nlimitless variety of conduct from governmental regulation.                  Thus,\n\nsympathetic as we may be to Troster's genuine patriotism as well\n\nas with his predicament, we cannot accept his suggestion that we\n\nhold, as a matter of \"common sense\" and law, that the mere act of\n\nwearing   a    uniform    with   a   flag       patch    on   it   constitutes   an\n\nexpressive or communicative \"use\" of the flag, cf. Spence, 418\nU.S. at 410, 94 S. Ct. at 2730 (“The Court for decades has\n\nrecognized the communicative connotations of the use of flags.”)\n\n(emphasis supplied), within the scope of the First Amendment.\n\nc.\n\n              In short, Troster has not at this time met his burden.\n\nThe district court's factual conclusion that \"[w]earing the flag\n\n\n                                          16\n\fpatch on a corrections officer's uniform . . . does not convey\n\nany agreement or disagreement with all or any of the many things\n\na flag may symbolize, or the Department's view of the flag,\" op.\n\nat 21, App. at 124, is sufficiently supported by the current\n\nrecord.   Accordingly,         we   hold    that       Troster     has    not    shown   a\n\nreasonable likelihood of success on the merits with respect to\n\nhis compelled expression claim, for he has not made the necessary\n\nthreshold showing that he was (probably) coerced to engage in\n\nexpressive conduct.          Thus, Troster presented the district court\n\nwith no basis to have granted him a preliminary injunction.\n\n3. VIABILITY   OF THE   SYMBOLIC PROTEST THEORY   IN   THESE CIRCUMSTANCES\n\na.\n\n           Troster's         alternative        theory      is     that,     given   the\n\ncircumstances, his refusal to wear the flag patch required by the\n\nDepartment constituted symbolic expressive conduct protected by\n\nthe First Amendment.0          This raises the question whether Troster\n\ncan present both the compelled expression and symbolic protest\n\nclaims,   that    is,     whether    he    has    an    analytically       independent\n\nsymbolic speech claim?          While we do not gainsay that a refusal to\n\ncomply with a governmental directive may in some cases amount to\n\nsymbolic protest covered by the First Amendment, this is not one\n\nof those cases.\n\n           Our     narrow     conclusion        does    not      ignore    the   Supreme\n\nCourt's historical solicitude for free speech claims, its high\n\n0\nTechnically the First Amendment is inoperative against the\nstates, but its strictures are nonetheless binding on the states\nvia the Fourteenth Amendment.     For simplicity, however, this\nopinion frequently refers only to the First Amendment.\n\n\n                                           17\n\fregard for a \"preferred right[],\" see, e.g., Smith v.

Put\n\ndifferently, in circumstances such as these where there is a\n\ncolorable claim that a governmental compulsion violates the First\n\nAmendment's     restrictions       on    governmentally            compelled      speech,\n\nthere    are    not    two    potentially        viable      arguments        that     the\n\nConstitution's free speech guarantees protect a person's refusal\n\nto comply with the governmental compulsion solely because of\n\nopposition to the compulsion.                The compulsion to \"speak\" may be\n\naddressed either as a symbolic protest claim, or as a compelled\n\nspeech claim, but not both.             Here, as shall be apparent, the most\n\napt rubric is compelled expression.\n\n              Our   conclusion    that       Troster    may    not        raise   both   a\n\ncompelled expression claim and a symbolic protest claim grounded\n\nsolely   in    objection     to   compelled         speech    is    animated      by   the\n\ncaution with which the Supreme Court has instructed courts to\n\nview symbolic conduct claims.

See\n\nalso infra at 22.         Rather, we believe that as a legal matter, the\n\nFirst    Amendment       does     not    protect     any      \"right\"      to    disobey    a\n\ngovernmental         compulsion     for    the      sole      purpose      of    expressing\n\nprotest against the compulsion on the grounds that it allegedly\n\nrequires one to engage in speech or expressive conduct.\n\n               As     Professor     Tiersma        has     explained,        a    recurring\n\njurisprudential concern \"is that the Free Speech Clause may be\n\ninvoked by anyone who violates a law, claiming to protest against\n\nit.\"    Tiersma, Nonverbal Communication, 1993 WIS.

We believe that this problem\n\nis particularly acute where individuals violating a governmental\n\ncompulsion to engage in some behavior merely assert that their\n\nviolation          expresses       their     belief        that     the      compulsion\n\nunconstitutionally requires them to speak or engage in expressive\n\nconduct.       In such circumstances, both the compelled speech and\n\nthe       putative    symbolic      protest       theories        involve    the   same\n\nobjection:      the individual does not want to be used by government\n\nas    a    mouthpiece       to   disseminate       ideological      messages.       The\n\nsymbolic protest theory simply adds a desire to communicate this\n\nopposition to others.\n\n              The addition of a constitutional symbolic protest claim\n\nto a compelled speech claim in this circumstance would only serve\n\nto give individuals an additional yet futile bite at the apple.0\n\n0\nLimited as our powers of imagination may be, we nevertheless\ncannot conceive of circumstances in which individuals' symbolic\nprotest claims grounded solely in refusal to engage in allegedly\ncoerced expressive conduct could succeed where the root\nexpressive conduct claim failed. If government had an interest\nsufficient under the First Amendment to justify compelling\n\n                                            20\n\fWe do not believe that the Constitution's free speech guarantees\n\ncountenance    such    a    waste    of   judicial       resources       (and   of    the\n\ngovernmental    resources      needed      to        defend   such      claims).      It\n\ndistorts the constitutional inquiry to shift the focus away from\n\nthe   government's     interest     in    enforcing       its    expressive-conduct\n\ncompulsion (despite opposition thereto), to focus instead on the\n\nindividual's interest in communicating opposition by violating\n\nthe compulsion, as Troster's dual theory would do.                         Rather, we\n\nbelieve that, in circumstances such as these, the goal of the\n\nindividual's conduct is properly characterized with regard to the\n\nFirst     Amendment    as    avoiding          the     compulsion,       rather      than\n\nexpressing disagreement with it.\n\n            In sum, symbolic protest claims are not analytically\n\nindependent     of    compelled      expressive         conduct      claims     in   the\n\ncircumstances that we have described.

In this case, it is the compelled\n\nexpressive conduct claim.

In Leonard, a number of\n\npolice officers were disciplined for appearing in uniform without\n\nthe    flag    patch    required     by    departmental         regulations.       The\n\nofficers had staged a public rally at which they removed their\n\npatches to protest racial discrimination within the police force.\n\nThe court of appeals held that the officers' conduct amounted to\n\nsymbolic speech protected by the First Amendment.                        See id. at\n\n1304.\n\n              Troster suggests that this holding at the very least\n\nstrongly counsels for a ruling in his favor.                     Leonard, however,\n\nis unlike this case in a crucial respect, which we believe is\n\nwhat the district court was driving at when it distinguished\n\nTroster's situation from Leonard on the grounds that Troster\nlacked an \"underlying political or patriotic message.\"                     Op. at 21\n\n(JA 000124).\n\n              In Leonard, although the conduct at issue (the means of\n\nthe     officers'      protest)     was    violation       of     the    flag     patch\n\nregulation, the object of the protest was not the regulation\n\nitself, but rather discrimination by the Department.                      The reason\n\nfor     the   protest     was     that    the   Department's       alleged      racial\n\n\n                                          22\n\fdiscrimination violated their rights to equal protection of the\n\nlaws, not a belief by the officers that the regulation compelled\n\nthem to engage in expressive conduct in violation of their First\n\nAmendment rights.      Thus, the officers were engaged in speech for\n\nsome reason other than protesting being used as a governmental\n\nmouthpiece.\n\n            As in Leonard, the means of Troster's protest was also\n\nviolation of a departmental flag patch regulation.                       In contrast\n\nto   the   officers'   protest    in    Leonard,       however,    the    object   of\n\nTroster's protest was the regulation itself.                      The reason for\n\nTroster's     violation     was        that     the      regulation        allegedly\n\nunconstitutionally compelled him to \"speak\" by wearing the patch\n\non his uniform. Thus, even if Troster engaged in symbolic speech\n\nby violating the flag patch regulation, he did so solely for the\n\npurpose of protesting the fact that (in his view) the regulation\n\nimproperly compelled him to \"speak.\"             Hence, it is apparent that\n\nthe reason for Troster's conduct--namely, his violation of the\n\nDepartment's flag patch regulation, which was the basis for the\n\ndisciplinary proceedings that he seeks to enjoin permanently--the\n\nonly point that he was trying to make, was that the regulation\n\nviolated his First Amendment right not to be a mouthpiece for the\n\ngovernment.    Troster's   symbolic          protest    claim     is   thus   wholly\n\nderivative from his compelled expression claim, which is the\n\nessence of his objection to the flag patch regulation, and his\n\n\n\n\n                                        23\n\ffree       speech    objection       should    accordingly          be    subject         only    to\n\ncompelled expression analysis.0\n\n               Similarly,        the      symbolic       protest    claim       in    Spence      v.\n\nWashington,          418      U.S.   at    405,     94     S. Ct.    at     2727,         was    not\n\nderivative          of    a   compelled      expression       claim.         There,         Spence\n\ndisplayed an American flag with peace signs attached in order to\n\nprotest American violence in Cambodia and at Kent State.                                        After\n\nbeing       arrested       for   violating     a     law    that    prohibited            improper\n\ndisplay of the American flag, his successful claim was that he\n\nhad    a    First        Amendment     right   to    express       his    message         in     that\n\nfashion, and that the state could not constitutionally punish him\n\nfor doing so. Spence's means of expression was a violation of the\n\nflag display statute, but the reason for his protest, the message\n\nhe sought to convey, was not a belief that the flag display\n\nstatute       (a     prohibitory          measure)        compelled       him        to    express\n\n\n0\nThis derivative relationship would not be present in the case of\na Rosa Parks sitting in the front of a segregated bus. If her\nactions were analyzed as expressive conduct, her message would\nnot be that the ordinance requiring her to sit at the back of the\nbus was forcing her to say something. She would not be simply\nprotesting   being   used as     a  mouthpiece   to   deliver   some\ngovernmental message.     Her message would be that the Jim Crow\nregime was denying her the equal protection of the laws. Thus,\neven if she were to raise both an equal protection and a symbolic\nprotest   claim    against   the   governmental    compulsion,   her\nmessage--conveyed     by    her    violation    of    the    seating\nordinance--would be more than simply opposition to being forced\nby the ordinance to \"say\" something, and thus she would have only\none colorable free speech claim, and symbolic protest (rather\nthan compelled expression) would be the appropriate mode of\nanalysis.   While the seating requirement certainly reflected a\nracist attitude or view about the dignity and social status of\nblack Americans, objection merely to compelled \"speech\" simply\nwould not have been the only message Rosa Parks sought to convey\nby her actions.\n\n\n                                               24\n\fsomething that he did not want to say.     He was not protesting\n\nbeing forced to act as a mouthpiece for government.       Thus, the\n\nfree speech claim in Spence lacks the duplicative quality of\n\nTroster's claim(s), and that case does not help him establish\n\nindependent viability of his symbolic protest theory.0\n\nc.\n\n          Our conclusion that Troster cannot press both theories\n\nis further supported by the Supreme Court's treatment of the\n\nFirst Amendment claims in Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. at 705, 97\n\nS. Ct. at 1428.   The plaintiffs in that case were two Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses who objected on political and religious grounds to\n\nbeing required to display New Hampshire's state motto--\"Live Free\n\nor Die\"--that was imprinted on their license plate.      After being\n\nprosecuted several times for covering the motto, the Maynards\n\nchallenged the constitutionality of the state law making it a\n\ncrime to obscure the motto, seeking injunctive relief prohibiting\n\nfuture prosecutions for their covering the motto (usually with\n\n\n0\nIndeed, even a person who burns a flag to protest a statute\nprohibiting flag burning would not have the same derivative\nstructure to his or her claim.      Certainly, the means of the\nsymbolic protest would be a violation of the very law that is the\nobject of the protest. But the reason for the protest would be a\nbelief that the statute unconstitutionally prohibited him or her\nfrom speaking; while there may be viewpoint discrimination at\nwork, there is no colorable compelled speech claim there.      By\nprohibiting flag burning, the statute simply does not require the\nhypothetical banner burner to express anything. So there is just\none free speech claim in this scenario:       that government is\nunconstitutionally prohibiting an individual from speaking his or\nher mind.    The flag burner cannot claim that the prohibition\nforces her to act as a mouthpiece for government, and there is\nthus no difficulty in letting the individual proceed with a\nsymbolic protest claim.\n\n\n                               25\n\fred reflective tape). The Maynards argued both that their act of\n\ncovering the motto was constitutionally protected because it was\n\nnecessary for them to avoid a compelled affirmation of belief,\n\nand that their act constituted protected symbolic speech not\n\noutweighed by sufficient state interests.                  A three-judge district\n\ncourt declined to \"consider whether their First Amendment right\n\nto be free from a required affirmation of belief is implicated,\"\n\nconcluding instead that the Maynards' affirmative act of covering\n\nthe motto was constitutionally protected expressive conduct.                          </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2143629\"><a href=\"/opinion/2143629/maynard-v-wooley/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1386 (1976).\n\n            On    appeal,    the    Supreme        Court    took   a    dramatically\n\ndifferent approach to the case.              The Court \"found it unnecessary\n\nto pass on the `symbolic speech' issue,\" concluding that there\n\nwere   \"more     appropriate   First    Amendment          grounds\"    on     which   to\n\naffirm the judgement of the district court.                  430 U.S. at 713, 97\n\nS. Ct. at 1434. The Court explained:\n          We turn instead to what in our view is the essence of\n          [the Maynards'] objection to the requirement that they\n          display the motto `Live Free or Die' on their\n          automobile license plates. . . .    We are thus faced\n          with   the   question   of  whether   the   State   may\n          constitutionally require an individual to participate\n          in the dissemination of an ideological message by\n          displaying it on his private property in a manner and\n          for the express purpose that it be observed and read by\n          the public. We hold that the State may not do so.\n\nId., 97 S. Ct. at 1434-35 (emphasis supplied).\n            While    the    Court    did     not    expressly      rule       that    the\n\nMaynards had no viable symbolic protest claim, its opinion cast\n\ngrave doubt on the prospects of that argument.                     As then-Justice\n\nRehnquist      interpreted     the     majority        opinion,        \"the     Court[]\n\n\n\n                                        26\n\fimplicit[ly] recogni[zed] that there is no protected `symbolic\n\nspeech' in this case . . . .\"                     Id. at 720, 97 S. Ct. at 1438\n\n(Rehnquist,         J.,    dissenting).               Of     particular       note    is      the\n\nmajority's assertion that had the state granted the Maynards'\n\nrequest    for      special     license      plates        not   containing         the     state\n\nmotto, the act of displaying them would not be \"sufficiently\n\ncommunicative to sustain a claim of symbolic expression.\"                                 Id. at\n\n713 n.10, 97 S. Ct. at 1434 n.10. This observation alone could be\n\nvirtually dispositive of Troster's symbolic protest claim.\n\n              The    Court      stated      in    Wooley      that     the    display       of   a\n\nlicense      plate    without      the      state      motto     would       not   amount        to\n\nconstitutionally protected expressive conduct, see id. at 713\n\nn.10,   97    S. Ct.       at   1434     n.10,        even    though     most      other     cars\n\ndisplayed plates with the motto, and even though \"New Hampshire\n\ncitizens      [were]       generally        aware      that      individuals         like    the\n\nplaintiffs ha[d] been covering the `Live Free or Die' on their\n\nlicense    plates         in   order   to    express         their   opposition        to     the\n\nmotto's implication that political freedom is the greatest good,\"\n\nsee 406 F. Supp. at 1387 n.11.                    Similarly, since Troster opposes\n\nthe flag patch regulation because he believes that it coerces him\n\nto engage in \"speech\" (actually, expressive conduct), we believe\n\nthat his conduct in wearing his correctional officer's uniform\n\nwithout the flag patch, which is required and is in fact worn by\n\nall the other guards, would not be protected symbolic speech even\n\nif, as he argued before the district court, his contemporaneous\n\nand   repeated       explanations        would        insure     that    observers          would\n\nlikely understand the reason for his refusal.\n\n\n                                                 27\n\f             In reaching this conclusion, we note that the Supreme\n\nCourt in Wooley did not contest the evidence and the district\n\ncourt's conclusion, see id., that the people of New Hampshire\n\nwould most likely understand the significance of the Maynards'\n\nacts. Rather, the Court concluded that the act of displaying\n\n\"expurgated    plates\"      would   not    \"sustain   a   claim       of   symbolic\n\nexpression.\"      430 U.S. at 713 n.10, 97 S. Ct. at 1434 n.10\n\n(emphasis    supplied).       The   fair    implication        of   this   is    that\n\ncertain conduct might be expressive in fact yet not protected by\n\nthe First Amendment as symbolic expression.\n\n             In determining that Troster's conduct falls into this\n\ncategory, we emphasize that the Supreme Court focused on what it\n\ntermed \"the essence\" of the Wooley's constitutional claim against\n\nthe anti-defacement statute.          The basis of the Maynards' claim\n\nwas, constitutionally speaking, not that the law in question\n\nprohibited them from \"communicat[ing] affirmative opposition to\n\nthe motto.\" Id.        Rather, the essence of their constitutional\n\nobjection was that the State was requiring individuals to help\n\ndisseminate an ideological message by displaying it on their\n\nprivate property. See id., 97 S. Ct. at 1434-35.                    This is not a\n\nsymbolic protest issue, but a compelled expression issue, which\n\nis how the Court treated it.\n\n             Coming full circle, we believe that, as a matter of\n\nlaw,   the   essence   of    Troster's     objection      to    the   flag      patch\n\nregulation is not that it limits his ability to protest being\n\nused as a governmental mouthpiece.             Rather, the essence of his\n\nclaim is reflected by the stated reason for his protest:                    Troster\n\n\n                                      28\n\fbelieves   that      the    regulation    in    question    unconstitutionally\n\nrequires him to engage in expressive conduct in violation of his\n\nFirst Amendment rights.          This is a colorable compelled expression\n\nclaim,   and    that   is    how   we   have   analyzed     his   constitutional\n\nchallenge to the Department's regulation in Part III supra.\n\n           In       sum,    because     the    message     Troster    wishes   to\n\ncommunicate is simply opposition to the Department's flag patch\n\nregulation     on    compelled     expression    grounds,     and    because   his\n\npreferred method of communicating this message is violation of\n\nthe regulation, compelled speech analysis is the proper vehicle\n\nfor his constitutional challenge.               Since we have rejected that\n\nclaim, the order of the district court denying Troster's motion\n\nfor a preliminary injunction will be affirmed.\n\n           The injunction we granted Troster pending this appeal\n\nwill be vacated. Parties to bear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                         29\n\f</pre>",
