(No. 1:95-CV-\n1210-MHS), Marvin H. Shoob, District Judge.\n\nBefore TJOFLAT and BARKETT, Circuit Judges, and PROPST*, Senior District Judge.\n\n       BARKETT, Circuit Judge:\n\n        Tommy Olmstead, Richard Fields, and Earnestine Pittman, (collectively \"the State\"),\n\ndefendants in the district court, appeal an adverse summary judgment granting declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief to plaintiffs L.C. and E.W.,1 two patients then-housed in a state psychiatric\n\nhospital.2 In May 1995, L.C. filed this action challenging her continued confinement at the Georgia\n\n\n   *\n     Honorable Robert B. Propst, Senior U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Alabama,\nsitting by designation.\n   1\n    As the district court did, we use the pseudonyms L.C. and E.W. in order to protect plaintiffs'\nidentities.\n   2\n     Both L.C. and E.W. are currently being treated in community-based programs. L.C. was\nplaced in a community-based program in February 1996, while this action was pending in the\ndistrict court; E.W. was placed in a similar program after the district court entered its judgment.\nNonetheless, this case is not moot. Mootness has been defined as \" \"the doctrine of standing set\nin a time frame: The requisite personal interest that must exist at the commencement of the\nlitigation (standing) must continue through its existence (mootness).' \" United States Parole\nComm'n v. Geraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397, 100 S.Ct. 1202, 1209, 63 L.Ed.2d 479 (1980) (quoting\nMonaghan, Constitutional Adjudication: The Who and When, 82 Yale L.J. 1363, 1384 (1973)).\n\fRegional Hospital in Atlanta (\"GRH-A\"), a psychiatric hospital where persons with mental\n\ndisabilities are cared for in a segregated environment. The State's failure to provide her with care\n\nin the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs, she argued, violated Title II of the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (1995), the Attorney General's Title II\n\nregulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 (1997), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn January 1996, E.W., a patient also confined at GRH-A, intervened in this action, raising identical\n\nclaims.\n\n          In granting summary judgment in favor of L.C. and E.W., the district court declared that the\n\nState's failure to place them in an appropriate community-based treatment program, instead\n\nconfining them at the state hospital, violates the anti-discrimination provision of Title II of the ADA,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its accompanying regulations. The district court enjoined the State from\n\nviolating plaintiffs' rights under the ADA, determined that the denial of community placements\n\ncould not be justified by the State's purported lack of funds, and ordered the State to release E.W.\n\nto an appropriate community-based treatment program and to provide L.C. with all appropriate\n\nservices necessary to maintain her current placement in a community-based treatment program.\n\n          We affirm the district court's judgment that the State discriminated against L.C. and E.W.\n\n\n\n\nAs the district court concluded, L.C.'s suit falls under the exception for cases that are \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review.\" L.C. has been confined eighteen different times at GRH-A and\nher current placement has been unstable at times due to the State's failure to provide adequate\nfunding. Therefore, it is likely that L.C. may be returned to GRH-A. Further, because of the\ncomplexity of the issues involved and instability of her placements, it is likely that any future\nclaim for relief will evade our review. See Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 318-23, 108 S.Ct. 592,\n601-04, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988); Lynch v. Baxley, 744 F.2d 1452, 1456-57 (11th Cir.1984). As\nto E.W., because the State only placed her in a community-based treatment program under court\norder, it is likely that, absent the court order, the State might revert to its prior practices. See\nVitek v. Jones, 445 U.S. 480, 486-87, 100 S.Ct. 1254, 1260-61, 63 L.Ed.2d 552 (1980). Further,\nlike L.C., E.W. has been subject to multiple and unstable placements at GRH-A, making her\nclaim one that is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\n\fby confining them in a segregated institution rather than in an integrated community-based program.\n\nHowever, we remand this case to the district court for further findings related to the State's defense\n\nthat the relief sought by plaintiffs would \"fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or\n\nactivity.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).3\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n       This case presents the question, one of first impression in this circuit, whether § 12132 of\n\nthe ADA and the Department of Justice's integration regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), prohibit a\n\nstate from confining a disabled individual in a state-run institution where that individual could be\n\nappropriately treated in a more integrated community setting. The State's principal argument is that\n\nthe district court's application of § 12132 and its accompanying regulations is contrary to the ADA's\n\nrequirement that a plaintiff prove that he or she faced discrimination \"by reason of such disability.\"\n\n§ 12132. The State contends that L.C. and E.W. have not shown that they were denied community\n\nplacements available to non-disabled individuals because of disability. In other words, the State\n\nargues that the ADA requires a comparison of the treatment of individuals with disabilities against\n\nthat of healthy non-disabled persons. However, as the State must concede, the confinement of L.C.\n\nand E.W. at GRH-A is attributable to their disabilities, thereby proving the very element the State\n\nargues is missing. Reduced to its essence, the State's argument is that Title II of the ADA affords\n\nno protection to individuals with disabilities who receive public services designed only for\n\nindividuals with disabilities.\n\n       The State has not pointed to any legal authority that supports such a reading of Title II of the\n\nADA and its integration regulation, § 35.130(d), and we can find none. To the contrary, we find\n\n\n   3\n    The State also claims that it was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' constitutional\nclaims. Because the district court did not consider these claims, we decline to do so as well.\nCitro Florida, Inc. v. Citrovale, S.A., 760 F.2d 1231, 1232 (11th Cir.1985).\n\foverwhelming authority in the plain language of Title II of the ADA, its legislative history, the\n\nAttorney General's Title II regulations, and the Justice Department's consistent interpretation of\n\nthose regulations, to support L.C. and E.W.'s position.\n\n        We analyze the applicability of the ADA and its regulations first by discussing the plain\n\nlanguage of Title II of the ADA and § 35.130(d), the integration regulation, and the Attorney\n\nGeneral's interpretation of that language. We then consider, in light of congressional intent, the\n\nState's argument that, notwithstanding the plain language of § 35.130(d) and the Attorney General's\n\ninterpretation of that regulation, the ADA does not apply in these circumstances. We next address\n\nthe State's secondary argument that certain disputed issues of fact preclude summary judgment.\n\nFinally, we consider the State's argument that funding limitations preclude it from complying with\n\nthe ADA.\n\n                                                   I.\n\n        Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in the\n\nprovision of public services by state and local governments. Section 12132 provides that \"no\n\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of his disability, be excluded from participation\n\nin or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected\n\nto discrimination by any such entity.\" § 12132.\n\n        Under the statutory scheme of Title II, Congress entrusted the Attorney General with the\n\nauthority to define the scope of the prohibitions set forth in § 12132. In § 12134 of the ADA,\n\nCongress directed the Attorney General to promulgate regulations further defining Title II's\n\nanti-discrimination mandate. See 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a); H.R. Rep. 101-485, pt. 3 at 52 (1990)\n\n(\"[T]itle II does not list all the forms of discrimination that the title is intended to prohibit. Thus,\n\nthe purpose of this section is to direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth the\n\fforms of discrimination prohibited.\"). Congress additionally mandated that the Attorney General's\n\nregulations, except with regard to program accessibility, existing facilities, and communications\n\nissues, be \"consistent with this chapter and with the coordination regulations under part 41 of title\n\n28, Code of Federal Regulations ... applicable to recipients of Federal financial assistance under\n\n[section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act].\" 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b).4\n\n        In response to this congressional mandate, the Attorney General issued regulations defining\n\nthe forms of discrimination prohibited by Title II of the ADA. Because Congress left to the Attorney\n\nGeneral the task of giving meaning to § 12132's broad prohibition on discrimination in public\n\nservices, the Attorney General's regulations must be \"given controlling weight unless they are\n\narbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\" Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC, Inc., 467\n\nU.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); Bledsoe v. Palm Beach County Soil\n\n& Water Conserv. Dist., 133 F.3d 816, 822-23 (11th Cir.1998); Harris v. H & W Contracting Co.,\n\n102 F.3d 516, 521 (11th Cir.1996); Helen L. v. DiDario, 46 F.3d 325, 331-32 (3d Cir.1995).\n\n        Under the Attorney General's Title II implementing regulations, \"[a] public entity shall\n\nadminister services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs\n\nof qualified individuals with disabilities.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d). There can be little question that\n\nthe plain language of § 35.130(d) prohibits a state from providing services to individuals with\n\ndisabilities in an unnecessarily segregated setting. See 28 C.F.R. Pt. 35, App. A at 478 (interpreting\n\n§ 35.130(d) to require placement \"in a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact\n\n\n\n   4\n    Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, in turn, provides that \"[n]o otherwise qualified\nindividual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability,\nbe excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination\nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under any program or\nactivity conducted by any Executive agency or by the United States Postal Service.\" 29 U.S.C. §\n794(a) (Supp.1997).\n\fwith non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible\"). In participating in this and other similar\n\nlitigation, the Attorney General has consistently adopted this interpretation of § 35.130(d), and, as\n\nsuch, it is entitled to substantial deference. Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512,\n\n114 S.Ct. 2381, 2386-87, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994); University Health Servs., Inc. v. Health &\n\nHuman Servs., 120 F.3d 1145, 1150 (11th Cir.1997).\n\n           By definition, where, as here, the State confines an individual with a disability in an\n\ninstitutionalized setting when a community placement is appropriate, the State has violated the core\n\nprinciple underlying the ADA's integration mandate. Placement in the community provides an\n\nintegrated treatment setting, allowing disabled individuals to interact with non-disabled persons—an\n\nopportunity permitted only in limited circumstances within the walls of segregated state institutions\n\nsuch as GRH-A. The State does not seriously contend otherwise. Nor does it even attempt to show\n\nthat the Attorney General's interpretation is \" \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation'\n\n\" as it must to overturn her construction of § 35.130(d). Thomas Jefferson, 512 U.S. at 512, 114\n\nS.Ct. at 2386 (quoting Udall v. Tallman, 380 U.S. 1, 16-17, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616\n\n(1965)).\n\n       Because the express terms of § 35.130(d), supported by the Attorney General's consistent\n\ninterpretation, plainly prohibit a state from treating individuals with disabilities in a segregated\n\nenvironment where a more integrated setting would be appropriate, we can only reverse the district\n\ncourt's finding that the State's actions in this case constituted discrimination within the meaning of\n\nthe ADA by holding § 35.130(d) invalid. Thus, we turn to the State's argument that § 12132's\n\nrequirement that a disabled plaintiff proved that he or she faced discrimination \"by reason of such\n\ndisability\" precludes application of the ADA in the circumstances presented here.\n\n                                                  II.\n\f        After review, we are unable to credit the State's argument that the ADA does not bar a state\n\nfrom providing public services for individuals with disabilities in a segregated manner because every\n\nindication of congressional intent confirms that the ADA applies to the circumstances presented\n\nhere. As noted earlier, in passing the ADA, Congress mandated that the Attorney General\n\npromulgate regulations consistent with the coordination regulations issued pursuant to § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act. Congress' decision to incorporate the § 504 coordination regulations is\n\nparticularly significant here. The Attorney General's § 504 coordination regulations mandate that\n\nrecipients of federal financial assistance \"administer programs and activities in the most integrated\n\nsetting appropriate to the needs of qualified handicapped persons.\" 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(d) (1997)\n\n(emphasis added).      By requiring the Attorney General to follow the § 504 coordination\n\nregulations—including the explicit integration requirement—Congress expressly mandated that\n\nindividuals with disabilities receive public services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their\n\nneeds. Conforming to this mandate, § 35.130(d) tracks this very language.5\n\n        It is well-settled that where \"a Congress that re-enacts a statute voices its approval of an\n\nadministrative ... interpretation thereof, Congress is treated as having adopted that interpretation, and\n\nthis Court is bound thereby.\" United States v. Board of Comm'rs of Sheffield, Ala., 435 U.S. 110,\n\n134, 98 S.Ct. 965, 980, 55 L.Ed.2d 148 (1978); Don E. Williams Co. v. Commissioner, 429 U.S.\n\n569, 576-77, 97 S.Ct. 850, 855-56, 51 L.Ed.2d 48 (1977). Although Title II of the ADA did not\n\nre-enact § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, the plain language of the ADA makes clear that Congress\n\nratified the Attorney General's § 504 coordination regulations and sought to ensure that the Attorney\n\n\n   5\n     In line with § 12134(b)'s mandate to promulgate regulations consistent with other parts of the\nADA, the Attorney General's Title II regulations are also consistent with the provisions of Title\nIII. See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(b)(1)(B) (1995) (\"Goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages,\nand accommodations shall be afforded to an individual with a disability in the most integrated\nsetting appropriate to the needs of the individual.\").\n\fGeneral's Title II regulations tracked the § 504 coordination regulations. Under these circumstances,\n\nboth sets of regulations, including the integration provisions, have the force of law. Helen L., 46\n\nF.3d at 332; Messier v. Southbury Training School, 916 F.Supp. 133, 141 (D.Conn.1996).\n\n        Congress' determination that public services be provided in the most integrated setting\n\nappropriate to the needs of individuals with disabilities is likewise reflected in the ADA's\n\ncongressional findings and the Act's legislative history. The Act's findings and legislative history\n\nmake clear that Congress sought to eliminate the segregation of individuals with disabilities in\n\npassing the ADA. In enacting the ADA, Congress determined that discrimination against individuals\n\nwith disabilities persists in a wide variety of areas of social life, including \"institutionalization,\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 12101(a)(3) (1995), and that \"individuals with disabilities continually encounter various\n\nforms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion ... [and] segregation....\" 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12101(a)(5); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2) (\"[H]istorically, society has tended to isolate and\n\nsegregate individuals with disabilities, and ... such forms of discrimination against individuals with\n\ndisabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\").\n\n        Indeed, the legislative history makes clear that Congress considered the provision of\n\nsegregated services to individuals with disabilities a form of discrimination prohibited by the ADA.\n\nSee S.Rep. No. 101-116 at 20 (1989) (noting \"compelling need to provide a clear and comprehensive\n\nnational mandate ... for the integration of persons with disabilities into the economic and social\n\nmainstream of American life\"); H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2 at 29 (1990) (listing \"segregation\" as\n\na form of \"[d]iscrimination against people with disabilities\"); H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3 at 26\n\n(1990) (\"The ADA is a comprehensive piece of civil rights legislation which promises a new future:\n\na future of inclusion and integration, and the end of exclusion and segregation.\"). Noting that \"[t]he\n\npurpose of Title II is to continue to break down barriers to the integrated participation of people with\n\fdisabilities in all aspects of community life,\" id. at 49-50, the House Committee on the Judiciary\n\nexplained that \"integrated services are essential to accomplishing the purposes of Title II....\n\nSeparate-but-equal services do not accomplish this central goal and should be rejected.\" Id. at 50.\n\nIndeed, drawing an analogy to the segregation of African-Americans, the House Report noted that\n\n\"segregation for persons with disabilities \"may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever\n\nto be undone.' \" Id. at 26 (quoting Brown v. Board of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 494, 74 S.Ct. 686, 691-\n\n92, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954)). Certainly, the denial of community placements to individuals with\n\ndisabilities such as L.C. and E.W. is precisely the kind of segregation that Congress sought to\n\neliminate.\n\n       Accordingly, because § 35.130(d) finds direct support in the plain language of the ADA, its\n\ncongressional findings, and the Act's legislative history, we must apply it here. See Bledsoe, 133\n\nF.3d at 823 (deferring to ADA's Title II regulations); Harris, 102 F.3d at 521 (\"We cannot disregard\n\nthe interpretive guidance contained in the appendix prepared by the federal agency charged with\n\nenforcing the ADA, when that guidance is based on a permissible construction of the statute and is\n\nsupported by the statute's legislative history.\").\n\n         We see nothing in the ADA's requirement that discrimination be \"by reason of such\n\ndisability\" that warrants a different result. The fact that L.C. and E.W. seek community-based\n\ntreatment services that only disabled persons need does not foreclose their claim that they were\n\nunnecessarily segregated. The ADA does not only mandate that individuals with disabilities be\n\ntreated the same as persons without such disabilities. Underlying the ADA's prohibitions is the\n\nnotion that individuals with disabilities must be accorded reasonable accommodations not offered\n\nto other persons in order to ensure that individuals with disabilities enjoy \"equality of opportunity,\n\nfull participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency ....\" § 12101(a)(8); see Willis\n\fv. Conopco, Inc., 108 F.3d 282, 285 (11th Cir.1997) (describing \"the basic goal of the ADA\" as\n\n\"ensuring that those with disabilities can fully participate in all aspects of society\"). This principle,\n\nexplicit in the text of the Act's employment provisions in Title I, see 42 U.S.C. § 12112(b)(5)(A)\n\n(1995), and the Title II regulations, runs throughout the ADA. See Bledsoe, 133 F.3d at 820-25\n\n(applying Title I reasonable accommodation mandate to Title II).\n\n        For example, under Title I of the ADA, employers may not terminate individuals with known\n\ndisabilities who can perform the essential functions of the job with a reasonable accommodation\n\neven though the employer need not offer similar accommodations to nondisabled employees. See\n\nHarris, 102 F.3d at 519 (noting that the ADA \"operates to create an affirmative duty for employers\n\nto reasonably accommodate individuals with disabilities\"); see also Sieberns v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc., 125 F.3d 1019, 1021-22 (7th Cir.1997) (noting that the \"ADA encompasses two distinct types\n\nof discrimination\": \"treating a \"qualified individual with a disability' differently because of the\n\ndisability, i.e. disparate treatment\" and \"failing to provide a reasonable accommodation\"). The\n\nemployer's failure to live up to its duty to provide a reasonable accommodation is unlawful\n\ndisability-based discrimination. See Stewart v. Happy Herman's Cheshire Bridge, 117 F.3d 1278,\n\n1285 (11th Cir.1997) (\"[A] qualified individual with a disability may be unlawfully discriminated\n\nagainst because of the individual's disability when the individual's employer does not reasonably\n\naccommodate the disability—unless such an accommodation would impose an undue hardship on\n\nthe employer.\"); see also Duckett v. Dunlop Tire Corp., 120 F.3d 1222, 1224 (11th Cir.1997)\n\n(noting that ADA defines discrimination to include failure to make reasonable accommodations to\n\na qualified individual with a disability).\n\n        Here, the Attorney General, guided by Congress' explicit approval of the § 504 coordination\n\nregulations, imposed a duty analogous to the reasonable accommodation mandate in the employment\n\fsetting. This duty requires states to place individuals with disabilities in the most integrated setting\n\nappropriate to their needs when receiving services for their disabilities in order to ensure that they\n\nbecome integrated into communities, not isolated from the rest of our society in state-run\n\ninstitutions. Under § 35.130(d), the failure to provide the most integrated services appropriate to\n\nthe needs of disabled persons constitutes unlawful disability-based discrimination—even though\n\nsuch services may not be needed by nondisabled individuals—because such segregation perpetuates\n\ntheir status as second-class citizens unfit for community life. As the Third Circuit explained in\n\nholding that the unnecessary segregation of disabled persons violates Title II of the ADA, \"[t]he\n\nADA is intended to ensure that qualified individuals receive services in a manner consistent with\n\nbasic human dignity rather than a manner that shunts them aside, hides, and ignores them.\" Helen\n\nL., 46 F.3d at 335; see also City of Cleburne, Tex. v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 461-64,\n\n105 S.Ct. 3249, 3265-67, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985) (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart) (surveying history of \"segregation and discrimination\" against mentally retarded persons).6\n\n       Further, the State's position is inconsistent with Congress' direction to promulgate regulations\n\n\n   6\n    Nothing in the Supreme Court's decision in Traynor v. Turnage, 485 U.S. 535, 108 S.Ct.\n1372, 99 L.Ed.2d 618 (1988), is to the contrary. In Traynor, the Court held that § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act did not impliedly repeal an Act of Congress permitting veterans to delay\nusing their \"GI Bill\" educational benefits past the statutory time limit because of a disability that\nwas not the result of their own willful misconduct. In upholding the willful misconduct\nlimitation, the Court found \"nothing in the Rehabilitation Act that requires that any benefit\nextended to one category of handicapped persons also be extended to all other categories of\nhandicapped persons,\" id. at 549, 108 S.Ct. at 1382-83, holding that Congress could choose to\ndeny the benefit to veterans \"because they engaged in some degree of wilfulness in the conduct\nthat caused them to become disabled.\" Id. at 550, 108 S.Ct. at 1383. Here, the issue is not\nwhether benefits accorded to one group of disabled persons must be extended to all others,\nwithout regard to the individual's responsibility for the conduct that caused the disability, but\nwhether a State may provide services to individuals with disabilities in an unnecessarily\nsegregated setting in the face of a clear congressional mandate requiring integrated services.\nNothing in Traynor requires us to validate the unnecessary segregation at issue here. See Helen\nL., 46 F.3d at 335-36; Messier, 916 F.Supp. at 142 n. 7; Martin v. Voinovich, 840 F.Supp. 1175,\n1191 (S.D.Ohio 1993).\n\fconsistent with the § 504 coordination regulations. These regulations impose a duty to provide the\n\nmost integrated services appropriate irrespective of any difference between services provided to\n\nindividuals with disabilities and individuals without disabilities. Under the § 504 coordination\n\nregulations, no showing of differential treatment is required; the integration regulation, on its face,\n\napplies to all services provided by a public entity. Significantly, Congress did not require the\n\nAttorney General to follow other agency regulations that require integration only where differential\n\ntreatment exists between individuals with disabilities and individuals without disabilities. See 45\n\nC.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2) (1997) (Department of Health and Human Services) (requiring recipients of\n\nfederal financial assistance from the agency to \"afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to\n\nobtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement [as\n\nnonhandicapped persons], in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs\"); see also\n\n34 C.F.R. § 104.4(b)(2) (1997) (same) (Department of Education). In making this choice, Congress\n\ndecided that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities violates the ADA even\n\nabsent a showing of differential treatment between individuals with disabilities and nondisabled\n\npersons. The State's position would effectively nullify Congress' choice to mandate the more\n\ndemanding integration requirement contained in the § 504 coordination regulations.\n\n       Furthermore, a separate section of both the § 504 coordination regulations and the ADA Title\n\nII regulations prohibits a public entity from providing \"different or separate\" services to individuals\n\nwith disabilities or a class of individuals with disabilities from those provided to other persons\n\nunless necessary to provide qualified disabled individuals with services \"that are as effective as\n\nthose provided to others.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iv); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(1)(iv). The State's\n\nclaim that § 35.130(d) also requires a showing of differential treatment between disabled and\n\nnondisabled persons would render the prohibitions contained in § 35.130(b)(1)(iv) redundant—an\n\finterpretation we must strive to avoid. See Mackey v. Lanier Collection Agency & Serv., Inc., 486\n\nU.S. 825, 837, 108 S.Ct. 2182, 2189, 100 L.Ed.2d 836 (1988) (declining \"to adopt an interpretation\n\nof a congressional enactment which renders superfluous another portion of that same law\");\n\nCammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 505, 79 S.Ct. 524, 529, 3 L.Ed.2d 462 (1959) (rejecting\n\nconstruction of regulation that would render a phrase \"pure surplusage\").\n\n        Moreover, the State's interpretation of Title II would undermine the congressional intent to\n\nend the exclusion and segregation of individuals with disabilities, as expressed in § 12101 and the\n\nADA's legislative history. In light of Congress' recognition that \"discrimination against individuals\n\nwith disabilities persists in such critical areas as ... institutionalization,\" § 12101(a)(3), the State's\n\ninterpretation of Title II runs directly counter to Congress' stated purposes and must be rejected. See\n\nMcNely v. Ocala Star-Banner Corp., 99 F.3d 1068, 1074 (11th Cir.1996) (rejecting interpretation\n\nof the ADA because it \"cannot be reconciled with ... [the Act's] stated purpose\"), cert. denied, ---\n\nU.S. ----, 117 S.Ct. 1819, 137 L.Ed.2d 1028 (1997). As the Third Circuit pointed out in Helen L.,\n\n\"[i]f Congress were only concerned about disparate treatment of the disabled as compared to their\n\nnondisabled counterparts, this statement would be a non sequitur as only disabled persons are\n\ninstitutionalized.\" 46 F.3d at 336.\n\n        Further, while the State did not deny L.C. and E.W. community-based placements out of a\n\nmalevolent intent to segregate them from the community, their indifference to L.C.'s and E.W.'s\n\nneeds—manifested by their refusal to place them in the community while recognizing the propriety\n\nof such a placement—is exactly the kind of conduct that the ADA was designed to prevent. In\n\nAlexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 105 S.Ct. 712, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985), surveying the legislative\n\nhistory of the Rehabilitation Act, the precursor of the ADA, the Supreme Court explained that\n\nCongress sought to do far more than merely outlaw invidious discrimination against the\n\fhandicapped.\n\n       Discrimination against the handicapped was perceived by Congress to be most often the\n       product, not of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and indifference—of benign\n       neglect. Thus, Representative Vanik ... described the treatment of the handicapped as one\n       the country's \"most shameful oversights,\" which caused the handicapped to live among\n       society \"shunted aside, hidden, and ignored.\" ... Federal agencies and commentators on the\n       plight of the handicapped similarly have found that discrimination against the handicapped\n       is primarily the result of apathetic attitudes rather than affirmative animus.\n\nId. at 295-96, 105 S.Ct. at 717 (footnotes omitted) (citations omitted). Indeed, Justice Marshall's\n\nopinion for the Court made clear that \"much of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in passing\n\nthe Rehabilitation Act would be difficult if not impossible to reach were the Act construed to\n\nproscribe only conduct fueled by a discriminatory intent.\" Id. at 296-97, 105 S.Ct. at 718. These\n\nsame concerns underlie the ADA. \"[T]he ADA attempts to eliminate the effects of that \"benign\n\nneglect,' \"apathy,' and \"indifference.' \" Helen L., 46 F.3d at 335; see also H.R.Rep. No. 101-485,\n\npt. 3 at 50, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1990 at pp. 267, 473 (\" \"[T]he goal is to eradicate the\n\ninvisibility of the handicapped.' \") (quoting ADAPT v. Skinner, 881 F.2d 1184, 1204 (3d Cir.1989)\n\n(en banc) (Mansmann, J, concurring in part and dissenting in part)). The State's failure to place L.C.\n\nand E.W. in the community thus falls squarely within the ADA's ban on disability-based\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n       Nor do any of the cases cited by the State require a different conclusion. The State relies\n\nheavily on our en banc decision in S.H. v. Edwards, 886 F.2d 292 (11th Cir.1989) (en banc), as well\n\nas several cases decided by other Circuits, see P.C. v. McLaughlin, 913 F.2d 1033 (2d Cir.1990);\n\nClark v. Cohen, 794 F.2d 79 (3d Cir.1986); Phillips v. Thompson, 715 F.2d 365 (7th Cir.1983). But\n\nnothing in S.H. or these other cases remotely touches on the issues presented by this appeal.\n\n       While it is true that we generally look to Rehabilitation Act precedents in construing the\n\nADA, see Duckett, 120 F.3d at 1225 n. 1, none of the cases cited by the State involved claims under\n\fthe express integration regulation of either the ADA or the § 504 coordination regulations, and\n\ntherefore, those cases are inapposite here. See Helen L., 46 F.3d at 333-34 (distinguishing prior\n\nRehabilitation Act precedent on this ground).\n\n       In S.H., for example, we considered \" \"plaintiffs' claims for relief in the nature of habilitation\n\nin the least restrictive environment in accordance with the recommendation of professional treatment\n\nstaff.' \" S.H., 886 F.2d at 293. S.H. did not involve the integration regulation of either § 504 of the\n\nRehabilitation Act or the ADA, or a claim that plaintiffs had been unnecessarily segregated. Instead,\n\nplaintiffs' only statutory claim was that they had been impermissibly denied habilitation reviews.\n\nThe district court denied this claim, finding that the legislature's use of a chronological bright-line\n\nto trigger habilitation reviews did not evidence discrimination solely because of disability. See S.H.\n\nv. Edwards, 860 F.2d 1045, 1052 (11th Cir.1988) (district court opinion attached as appendix A).\n\nIt is far from clear whether our two paragraph en banc decision even considered plaintiffs'\n\nRehabilitation Act claim.\n\n       Finally, we also reject the State's suggestion that L.C.'s and E.W.'s ADA claim must fail\n\nbecause the denial of community-based placements was based on a lack of funds, not on L.C.'s and\n\nE.W.'s disabilities. Under the ADA, as under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, \"the absence of a\n\nmalevolent motive does not convert a facially discriminatory policy into a neutral policy ....\"\n\nInternational Union, UAW v. Johnson Controls, 499 U.S. 187, 199, 111 S.Ct. 1196, 1203-04, 113\n\nL.Ed.2d 158 (1991). Even if the State failed to place L.C. and E.W. in the community because of\n\na lack of funding, this motive does not lessen the \"discriminatory character\" of their segregation.\n\nId. Moreover, the plain language of the ADA's Title II regulations, as well as the ADA's legislative\n\nhistory, make clear that Congress wanted to permit a cost defense only in the most limited of\n\ncircumstances. The ADA's Title II regulations permit a state to justify its failure to make reasonable\n\faccommodations for individuals with disabilities where those accommodations \"would\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(7).7 As the\n\nHouse Judiciary report explained,\n\n        The fact that it is more convenient, either administratively or fiscally, to provide services in\n        a segregated manner, does not constitute a valid justification for separate or different\n        services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or under this title.... The existence of\n        such programs can never be used as a basis to ... refuse to provide an accommodation in a\n        regular setting.\n\nH.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3 at 50, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1990 at 473. The State's\n\nargument that its lack of funds makes its refusal to provide integrated services non-discriminatory\n\nis inconsistent with the ADA's statutory scheme and would permit a public entity to justify its refusal\n\nto comply with the ADA by asserting that it lacked the money to do so.\n\n        We emphasize that our holding does not mandate the deinstitutionalization of individuals\n\nwith disabilities. Instead, we hold that where, as here, a disabled individual's treating professionals\n\nfind that a community-based placement is appropriate for that individual, the ADA imposes a duty\n\nto provide treatment in a community setting—the most integrated setting appropriate to that patient's\n\nneeds. Where there is no such finding, on the other hand, nothing in the ADA requires the\n\ndeinstitutionalization of that patient.\n\n                                                  III.\n\n        The State also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to E.W.\n\nbecause there is a disputed issue of fact regarding whether E.W. could be placed in a\n\ncommunity-based treatment program. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, applying the same standards as the district court. Harris, 102 F.3d at 518. Summary\n\njudgment is appropriate if the pleadings, depositions, and affidavits show that no genuine issue of\n\n\n   7\n    We consider the applicability of this defense in part IV.\n\fmaterial fact exists for trial and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\nCelotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). We must\n\nview all evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Harris, 102 F.3d at 519.\n\n       The State concedes that, at times during the course of this litigation, its own experts found\n\nthat E.W. could be placed in a community treatment program. However, it claims that because, at\n\nother times, those experts maintained that E.W. should receive treatment in an institutionalized\n\nsetting, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether community-based treatment was a\n\npossibility for E.W. In particular, the State points to the statements of Dr. Gary DeBacher, the chief\n\nof the Psychology staff at GRH-A, Joseph Steed, a behavioral specialist with the Fulton County\n\nRegional Board, and Gloria Sheppard, a member of the Board's Comprehensive Evaluation Team.\n\nAs the State argues, these experts found that E.W. could not be placed in the community at certain\n\ntimes during this litigation.     At the same time, however, these experts testified that a\n\ncommunity-based placement would be appropriate for E.W. once her condition improved, so long\n\nas the community treatment program provided her with the necessary level of care and supervision.8\n\n       In light of the testimony and considering the record as a whole, we reject the State's argument\n\nthat the district court's grant of summary judgment was in error. All the experts, including E.W.'s\n\ntreating physician, were unanimous that E.W. could be appropriately placed in a community-based\n\n\n\n\n   8\n    The State also points to E.W.'s hospitalization at the Central State Hospital in Milledgeville,\nGeorgia and at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta in late 1996 to support the conclusion that\nE.W. could not be placed in the community. At that time, E.W.'s kidney functions were\ncompromised, requiring surgery in the hospital. Although prior to the surgery, one of the State's\nexperts, Dr. George Echols, was uncertain whether E.W. could be placed in the community after\nthe surgery, the surgeon who performed the operation testified after the surgery that E.W.'s\nmedical problems did not require her to remain in a state hospital.\n\ftreatment program, provided that it could give E.W. the level of care and supervision she needed.9\n\nThe State has not suggested that such placements were not available to E.W. Indeed, they were able\n\nto find such a placement for E.W. after the district court's judgment.\n\n        We do not suggest that should a trial court find that a patient, for medical reasons, needs\n\ninstitutionalized care, it must nonetheless order placement in a community-based treatment program.\n\nWe recognize that the determination whether a patient can be appropriately placed in a\n\ncommunity-based treatment program is a fluid one, subject to change as the patient's medical\n\ncondition improves or worsens. Over the course of litigation, there may be times that a patient can\n\nbe treated in the community, and others where an institutional placement is necessary. But where,\n\nas here, the evidence is clear that all the experts agree that, at a given time, the patient could be\n\ntreated in a more integrated setting, the ADA mandates that it do so at that time unless placing that\n\nindividual would constitute a fundamental alteration in the state's provision of services. Nothing in\n\nthe ADA, however, forbids a state from moving a patient back to an institutionalized treatment\n\nsetting, as the patient's condition necessitates.\n\n        Under these principles, the district court correctly denied the State's motion for summary\n\njudgment. Summary judgment is not precluded here by the fact that, at earlier times in the litigation,\n\nsome of the State's experts opined that E.W. could not be placed in the community immediately.\n\nNone of the State's experts concluded that E.W. needed to be placed at GRH-A on a long-term basis.\n\nAt most, they believed that, in the short term, continued hospitalization was necessary in order to\n\npermit E.W. to make the transition to a community-based living arrangement in a group home.\n\n\n   9\n    In early 1995, the experts at GRH-A themselves recognized that E.W. could be placed\noutside GRH-A. They repeatedly placed her in personal care homes, providing her with a\ncommunity setting for her treatment. She was not placed, however, in a community setting with\nthe appropriate level of monitoring, and, as a result, she returned to GRH-A after extremely short\nstays in the community.\n\fAlthough one of the State's experts, Joseph Steed, expressed concerns that E.W. would not progress\n\nto the point where she could be placed in the community, the evidence in the record shows that, in\n\nthe spring and summer of 1996—after Steed's initial assessment as well as the others cited by the\n\nState—GRH-A attempted to find a community placement for E.W., but could not because there were\n\nno available state Medicaid waiver funds for such a placement.\n\n        Accordingly, because the State's own professionals agreed that E.W. could be placed in a less\n\nsegregated setting, the State has failed to demonstrate that there is a material issue of fact for trial\n\nas required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment was not in error.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n        In Part II we rejected the State's argument that it complied with the ADA in this case because\n\nthe denial of community placements to L.C. and E.W. was based on the State's lack of funds, not on\n\nplaintiffs' disabilities. We must now address whether the lack of available funding provides the\n\nState a defense to plaintiffs' ADA claim.\n\n        Notwithstanding that under the ADA and its Title II regulations the State has a duty to\n\nprovide integrated services when the patient's care warrants such services, that duty is not absolute.\n\nAs discussed above, the State need not provide these services if to do so would require a\n\nfundamental alteration in its programs. Under Title II, \"[a] public entity shall make reasonable\n\nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the\n\nmodifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 35.130(b)(7).\n\n        L.C. and E.W. have demonstrated that the State may reasonably modify its provision of\n\nservices by providing treatment to them in an integrated setting. L.C. and E.W. point out that, under\n\fGeorgia law, the State has the authority to transfer funds between institutional and community-based\n\ntreatment programs based on need. O.C.G.A. § 37-2-5.1(c)(3) (1995). They also note that, under\n\nthe federal government's Medicaid waiver program, the State may spend Medicaid funds to provide\n\ncommunity-based care to disabled persons who would otherwise be eligible for institutionalized\n\ncare. The federal government has authorized matching federal dollars for over 2100 patients in\n\nGeorgia, but, in 1996, the State used only 700 of these slots. See Hopkins Dep. at 18-19. Finally,\n\nthey argue that the State can provide integrated community-based services at significantly less cost\n\nthan institutionalized care.\n\n       The availability of these alternate sources of funding makes L.C.'s and E.W.'s request for\n\nmodification of the State's program of providing services to disabled persons a reasonable one \" \"in\n\nthe run of cases.' \" Willis, 108 F.3d at 286 n. 2 (quoting Barth v. Gelb, 2 F.3d 1180, 1187\n\n(D.C.Cir.1993)). Accordingly, it is the State's duty to demonstrate that providing treatment to L.C.\n\nand E.W. fundamentally alters the nature of the service it provides \" \"in the context of the particular\n\nagency's operations.' \" Id.; Helen L., 46 F.3d at 337; H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3 at 51 (noting\n\nimportance of \"size and budget\" of the particular agency).\n\n       The State does not argue that the relief requested by L.C. and E.W. will effect a fundamental\n\nalteration by requiring it to dismantle its provision of institutionalized care to individuals with\n\ndisabilities. Instead, the State argues that it lacks the funds to provide community-based services\n\nto L.C. and E.W. The district court rejected this argument, reasoning that the State could provide\n\ncommunity-based services to L.C. and E.W. at less cost than providing institutional care for them\n\nat GRH-A.       Accordingly, it found that the State's purported lack of funds to provide\n\ncommunity-based services to L.C. and E.W. was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that\n\nproviding community-based care to plaintiffs would constitute a fundamental alteration.\n\f        Under the ADA, as with other federal statutes, \"[i]nadequate state appropriations do not\n\nexcuse noncompliance\" with federal law. Alabama Nursing Home Ass'n v. Harris, 617 F.2d 388,\n\n396 (5th Cir.1980) (Medicaid Act); see also Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709 (11th Cir.1998) (same);\n\nTallahassee Memorial Regional Med. Ctr. v. Cook, 109 F.3d 693, 704 (11th Cir.1997) (same).\n\nHaving chosen to provide services to individuals with disabilities, the State—both the state officials\n\ncharged with formulating the budget as well as the state agencies responsible for mental health\n\nservices—must act \"in a manner [that] comports with the requirements of [the ADA].\" Helen L.,\n\n46 F.3d at 339.\n\n       Our cases make clear that the ADA does not permit the State to justify its discriminatory\n\ntreatment of individuals with disabilities on the grounds that providing non-discriminatory treatment\n\nwill require additional expenditures of state funds. We recognized this principle in United States\n\nv. Board of Trustees for University of Alabama, 908 F.2d 740 (11th Cir.1990). There, we held that,\n\nconsidering the size of the University of Alabama's transportation budget, the University failed to\n\nshow that an additional expenditure of $15,000 to modify its bus system to reasonably accommodate\n\nindividuals with disabilities would impose an undue financial hardship. The University could not\n\nsimply claim that it lacked the funds to make these modifications in its bus system; rather it could\n\nonly justify its discriminatory treatment by demonstrating that its transportation budget could not\n\nbe reasonably modified to take account of the needs of the disabled. In light of its \"annual\n\ntransportation budget of $1.2 million,\" we concluded that requiring minimal additional expenditures\n\nof $15,000 would not \"cause an undue financial burden on UAB.\" Id. at 751.\n\n       The district court did not consider whether treating L.C. and E.W. would require additional\n\nexpenditures and if so, whether the State had met its burden of proving that those expenditures were\n\nunreasonable in light of the State's mental health budget. Instead, it noted that the State currently\n\fprovided community-based services to individuals with disabilities and that such services could be\n\nprovided at less cost than segregated services. Based on these two factors, the district court\n\nconcluded that the State had failed to show that providing community-based care to L.C. and E.W.\n\nwould cause an fundamental alteration.\n\n       There is evidence in the record that suggests that, because of fixed overhead costs associated\n\nwith providing institutional care, the State will be able to save money by moving patients from\n\ninstitutionalized care to community-based care only when it shuts down entire hospitals or hospital\n\nwings, but not when it moves one or two patients from a hospital into the community. See Olmstead\n\nDep. at 78-80; Bliss Dep. at 33-34. Thus, it may be that requiring the State to treat L.C. and E.W.\n\nin a community-based program will require additional expenditure of state funds.\n\n        Nonetheless, the ADA may still require the State to expend additional funds in order to\n\nprovide L.C. and E.W. with integrated services. Unless the State can prove that requiring it to make\n\nthese additional expenditures would be so unreasonable given the demands of the State's mental\n\nhealth budget that it would fundamentally alter the service it provides, the ADA requires the State\n\nto make these additional expenditures. Because the district court did not consider this question and\n\nbecause of the complexity of the factual issues concerning the funding for mental health services in\n\nGeorgia, we remand this case to the district court for further proceedings on this issue. In\n\ndetermining whether the State can meet its burden of establishing a fundamental alteration, the\n\ndistrict court should consider, among other things: (1) whether the additional expenditures\n\nnecessary to treat L.C. and E.W. in community-based care would be unreasonable given the\n\ndemands of the State's mental health budget; (2) whether it would be unreasonable to require the\n\nState to use additional available Medicaid waiver slots, as well as its authority under Georgia law\n\nto transfer funds from institutionalized care to community-based care, to minimize any financial\n\fburden on the State; and (3) whether any difference in the cost of providing institutional or\n\ncommunity-based care will lessen the State's financial burden.10 This list, is, of course, not\n\nexclusive. The district court may also consider any other factors it believes are relevant to the\n\nfundamental alteration inquiry.\n\n        Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and the case is REMANDED\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n   10\n     We note that this case is not a class action, but a challenge brought on behalf of two\nindividual plaintiffs. Our holding is not meant to resolve the more difficult questions of\nfundamental alteration that might be present in a class action suit seeking deinstitutionalization\nof a state hospital.\n\f",

The State's failure to provide her with care\n\nin the most integrated setting appropriate to her needs, she argued, violated Title II of the Americans\n\nwith Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134 (1995), the Attorney General's Title II\n\nregulations, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130 (1997), and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nIn January 1996, E.W., a patient also confined at GRH-A, intervened in this action, raising identical\n\nclaims.\n\n          In granting summary judgment in favor of L.C. and E.W., the district court declared that the\n\nState's failure to place them in an appropriate community-based treatment program, instead\n\nconfining them at the state hospital, violates the anti-discrimination provision of Title II of the ADA,\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12132, and its accompanying regulations. The district court enjoined the State from\n\nviolating plaintiffs' rights under the ADA, determined that the denial of community placements\n\ncould not be justified by the State's purported lack of funds, and ordered the State to release E.W.\n\nto an appropriate community-based treatment program and to provide L.C. with all appropriate\n\nservices necessary to maintain her current placement in a community-based treatment program.\n\n          We affirm the district court's judgment that the State discriminated against L.C. and E.W.\n\n\n\n\nAs the district court concluded, L.C.'s suit falls under the exception for cases that are \"capable of\nrepetition, yet evading review.\" L.C. has been confined eighteen different times at GRH-A and\nher current placement has been unstable at times due to the State's failure to provide adequate\nfunding. Therefore, it is likely that L.C. may be returned to GRH-A. Further, because of the\ncomplexity of the issues involved and instability of her placements, it is likely that any future\nclaim for relief will evade our review. See Honig v.

Further,\nlike L.C., E.W. has been subject to multiple and unstable placements at GRH-A, making her\nclaim one that is capable of repetition, yet evading review.\n\fby confining them in a segregated institution rather than in an integrated community-based program.\n\nHowever, we remand this case to the district court for further findings related to the State's defense\n\nthat the relief sought by plaintiffs would \"fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or\n\nactivity.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7).3\n\n                                           DISCUSSION\n\n       This case presents the question, one of first impression in this circuit, whether § 12132 of\n\nthe ADA and the Department of Justice's integration regulation, 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(d), prohibit a\n\nstate from confining a disabled individual in a state-run institution where that individual could be\n\nappropriately treated in a more integrated community setting. The State's principal argument is that\n\nthe district court's application of § 12132 and its accompanying regulations is contrary to the ADA's\n\nrequirement that a plaintiff prove that he or she faced discrimination \"by reason of such disability.\"\n\n§ 12132. The State contends that L.C. and E.W. have not shown that they were denied community\n\nplacements available to non-disabled individuals because of disability. In other words, the State\n\nargues that the ADA requires a comparison of the treatment of individuals with disabilities against\n\nthat of healthy non-disabled persons. However, as the State must concede, the confinement of L.C.\n\nand E.W. at GRH-A is attributable to their disabilities, thereby proving the very element the State\n\nargues is missing. Reduced to its essence, the State's argument is that Title II of the ADA affords\n\nno protection to individuals with disabilities who receive public services designed only for\n\nindividuals with disabilities.\n\n       The State has not pointed to any legal authority that supports such a reading of Title II of the\n\nADA and its integration regulation, § 35.130(d), and we can find none. To the contrary, we find\n\n\n   3\n    The State also claims that it was entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs' constitutional\nclaims. Because the district court did not consider these claims, we decline to do so as well.\nCitro Florida, Inc. v.

We then consider, in light of congressional intent, the\n\nState's argument that, notwithstanding the plain language of § 35.130(d) and the Attorney General's\n\ninterpretation of that regulation, the ADA does not apply in these circumstances. We next address\n\nthe State's secondary argument that certain disputed issues of fact preclude summary judgment.\n\nFinally, we consider the State's argument that funding limitations preclude it from complying with\n\nthe ADA.\n\n                                                   I.\n\n        Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in the\n\nprovision of public services by state and local governments. Section 12132 provides that \"no\n\nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of his disability, be excluded from participation\n\nin or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected\n\nto discrimination by any such entity.\" § 12132.\n\n        Under the statutory scheme of Title II, Congress entrusted the Attorney General with the\n\nauthority to define the scope of the prohibitions set forth in § 12132. In § 12134 of the ADA,\n\nCongress directed the Attorney General to promulgate regulations further defining Title II's\n\nanti-discrimination mandate. See 42 U.S.C. § 12134(a); H.R. Rep. 101-485, pt. 3 at 52 (1990)\n\n(\"[T]itle II does not list all the forms of discrimination that the title is intended to prohibit. Thus,\n\nthe purpose of this section is to direct the Attorney General to issue regulations setting forth the\n\fforms of discrimination prohibited.\"). Congress additionally mandated that the Attorney General's\n\nregulations, except with regard to program accessibility, existing facilities, and communications\n\nissues, be \"consistent with this chapter and with the coordination regulations under part 41 of title\n\n28, Code of Federal Regulations ... applicable to recipients of Federal financial assistance under\n\n[section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act].\" 42 U.S.C. § 12134(b).4\n\n        In response to this congressional mandate, the Attorney General issued regulations defining\n\nthe forms of discrimination prohibited by Title II of the ADA. Because Congress left to the Attorney\n\nGeneral the task of giving meaning to § 12132's broad prohibition on discrimination in public\n\nservices, the Attorney General's regulations must be \"given controlling weight unless they are\n\narbitrary, capricious, or manifestly contrary to the statute.\" Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

Placement in the community provides an\n\nintegrated treatment setting, allowing disabled individuals to interact with non-disabled persons—an\n\nopportunity permitted only in limited circumstances within the walls of segregated state institutions\n\nsuch as GRH-A.

Thus, we turn to the State's argument that § 12132's\n\nrequirement that a disabled plaintiff proved that he or she faced discrimination \"by reason of such\n\ndisability\" precludes application of the ADA in the circumstances presented here.\n\n                                                  II.\n\f        After review, we are unable to credit the State's argument that the ADA does not bar a state\n\nfrom providing public services for individuals with disabilities in a segregated manner because every\n\nindication of congressional intent confirms that the ADA applies to the circumstances presented\n\nhere.

By requiring the Attorney General to follow the § 504 coordination\n\nregulations—including the explicit integration requirement—Congress expressly mandated that\n\nindividuals with disabilities receive public services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their\n\nneeds. Conforming to this mandate, § 35.130(d) tracks this very language.5\n\n        It is well-settled that where \"a Congress that re-enacts a statute voices its approval of an\n\nadministrative ... interpretation thereof, Congress is treated as having adopted that interpretation, and\n\nthis Court is bound thereby.\" United States v.

[and] segregation....\" 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12101(a)(5); see also 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2) (\"[H]istorically, society has tended to isolate and\n\nsegregate individuals with disabilities, and ... such forms of discrimination against individuals with\n\ndisabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\").\n\n        Indeed, the legislative history makes clear that Congress considered the provision of\n\nsegregated services to individuals with disabilities a form of discrimination prohibited by the ADA.\n\nSee S.Rep. No. 101-116 at 20 (1989) (noting \"compelling need to provide a clear and comprehensive\n\nnational mandate ... for the integration of persons with disabilities into the economic and social\n\nmainstream of American life\"); H.R.Rep.

Certainly, the denial of community placements to individuals with\n\ndisabilities such as L.C. and E.W. is precisely the kind of segregation that Congress sought to\n\neliminate.\n\n       Accordingly, because § 35.130(d) finds direct support in the plain language of the ADA, its\n\ncongressional findings, and the Act's legislative history, we must apply it here. See Bledsoe, 133\n\nF.3d at 823 (deferring to ADA's Title II regulations); Harris, 102 F.3d at 521 (\"We cannot disregard\n\nthe interpretive guidance contained in the appendix prepared by the federal agency charged with\n\nenforcing the ADA, when that guidance is based on a permissible construction of the statute and is\n\nsupported by the statute's legislative history.\").\n\n         We see nothing in the ADA's requirement that discrimination be \"by reason of such\n\ndisability\" that warrants a different result. The fact that L.C. and E.W. seek community-based\n\ntreatment services that only disabled persons need does not foreclose their claim that they were\n\nunnecessarily segregated. The ADA does not only mandate that individuals with disabilities be\n\ntreated the same as persons without such disabilities. Underlying the ADA's prohibitions is the\n\nnotion that individuals with disabilities must be accorded reasonable accommodations not offered\n\nto other persons in order to ensure that individuals with disabilities enjoy \"equality of opportunity,\n\nfull participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency ....\" § 12101(a)(8); see Willis\n\fv.

In Traynor, the Court held that § 504 of the\nRehabilitation Act did not impliedly repeal an Act of Congress permitting veterans to delay\nusing their \"GI Bill\" educational benefits past the statutory time limit because of a disability that\nwas not the result of their own willful misconduct. In upholding the willful misconduct\nlimitation, the Court found \"nothing in the Rehabilitation Act that requires that any benefit\nextended to one category of handicapped persons also be extended to all other categories of\nhandicapped persons,\" id. at 549, 108 S.Ct. at 1382-83, holding that Congress could choose to\ndeny the benefit to veterans \"because they engaged in some degree of wilfulness in the conduct\nthat caused them to become disabled.\" Id. at 550, 108 S.Ct. at 1383.

These regulations impose a duty to provide the\n\nmost integrated services appropriate irrespective of any difference between services provided to\n\nindividuals with disabilities and individuals without disabilities. Under the § 504 coordination\n\nregulations, no showing of differential treatment is required; the integration regulation, on its face,\n\napplies to all services provided by a public entity. Significantly, Congress did not require the\n\nAttorney General to follow other agency regulations that require integration only where differential\n\ntreatment exists between individuals with disabilities and individuals without disabilities. See 45\n\nC.F.R. § 84.4(b)(2) (1997) (Department of Health and Human Services) (requiring recipients of\n\nfederal financial assistance from the agency to \"afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to\n\nobtain the same result, to gain the same benefit, or to reach the same level of achievement [as\n\nnonhandicapped persons], in the most integrated setting appropriate to the person's needs\"); see also\n\n34 C.F.R. § 104.4(b)(2) (1997) (same) (Department of Education). In making this choice, Congress\n\ndecided that the unnecessary segregation of individuals with disabilities violates the ADA even\n\nabsent a showing of differential treatment between individuals with disabilities and nondisabled\n\npersons. The State's position would effectively nullify Congress' choice to mandate the more\n\ndemanding integration requirement contained in the § 504 coordination regulations.\n\n       Furthermore, a separate section of both the § 504 coordination regulations and the ADA Title\n\nII regulations prohibits a public entity from providing \"different or separate\" services to individuals\n\nwith disabilities or a class of individuals with disabilities from those provided to other persons\n\nunless necessary to provide qualified disabled individuals with services \"that are as effective as\n\nthose provided to others.\" 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(1)(iv); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(1)(iv). The State's\n\nclaim that § 35.130(d) also requires a showing of differential treatment between disabled and\n\nnondisabled persons would render the prohibitions contained in § 35.130(b)(1)(iv) redundant—an\n\finterpretation we must strive to avoid.

The ADA's Title II regulations permit a state to justify its failure to make reasonable\n\faccommodations for individuals with disabilities where those accommodations \"would\n\nfundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" 28 C.F.R. 35.130(b)(7).7 As the\n\nHouse Judiciary report explained,\n\n        The fact that it is more convenient, either administratively or fiscally, to provide services in\n        a segregated manner, does not constitute a valid justification for separate or different\n        services under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, or under this title.... The existence of\n        such programs can never be used as a basis to ... refuse to provide an accommodation in a\n        regular setting.\n\nH.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3 at 50, U.S.Code Cong. & Admin.News 1990 at 473. The State's\n\nargument that its lack of funds makes its refusal to provide integrated services non-discriminatory\n\nis inconsistent with the ADA's statutory scheme and would permit a public entity to justify its refusal\n\nto comply with the ADA by asserting that it lacked the money to do so.\n\n        We emphasize that our holding does not mandate the deinstitutionalization of individuals\n\nwith disabilities. Instead, we hold that where, as here, a disabled individual's treating professionals\n\nfind that a community-based placement is appropriate for that individual, the ADA imposes a duty\n\nto provide treatment in a community setting—the most integrated setting appropriate to that patient's\n\nneeds. Where there is no such finding, on the other hand, nothing in the ADA requires the\n\ndeinstitutionalization of that patient.\n\n                                                  III.\n\n        The State also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to E.W.\n\nbecause there is a disputed issue of fact regarding whether E.W. could be placed in a\n\ncommunity-based treatment program. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, applying the same standards as the district court. Harris, 102 F.3d at 518.

We must\n\nview all evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the nonmoving party. Harris, 102 F.3d at 519.\n\n       The State concedes that, at times during the course of this litigation, its own experts found\n\nthat E.W. could be placed in a community treatment program. However, it claims that because, at\n\nother times, those experts maintained that E.W. should receive treatment in an institutionalized\n\nsetting, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether community-based treatment was a\n\npossibility for E.W. In particular, the State points to the statements of Dr. Gary DeBacher, the chief\n\nof the Psychology staff at GRH-A, Joseph Steed, a behavioral specialist with the Fulton County\n\nRegional Board, and Gloria Sheppard, a member of the Board's Comprehensive Evaluation Team.\n\nAs the State argues, these experts found that E.W. could not be placed in the community at certain\n\ntimes during this litigation.     At the same time, however, these experts testified that a\n\ncommunity-based placement would be appropriate for E.W. once her condition improved, so long\n\nas the community treatment program provided her with the necessary level of care and supervision.8\n\n       In light of the testimony and considering the record as a whole, we reject the State's argument\n\nthat the district court's grant of summary judgment was in error. All the experts, including E.W.'s\n\ntreating physician, were unanimous that E.W. could be appropriately placed in a community-based\n\n\n\n\n   8\n    The State also points to E.W.'s hospitalization at the Central State Hospital in Milledgeville,\nGeorgia and at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta in late 1996 to support the conclusion that\nE.W. could not be placed in the community. At that time, E.W.'s kidney functions were\ncompromised, requiring surgery in the hospital. Although prior to the surgery, one of the State's\nexperts, Dr. George Echols, was uncertain whether E.W. could be placed in the community after\nthe surgery, the surgeon who performed the operation testified after the surgery that E.W.'s\nmedical problems did not require her to remain in a state hospital.\n\ftreatment program, provided that it could give E.W. the level of care and supervision she needed.9\n\nThe State has not suggested that such placements were not available to E.W. Indeed, they were able\n\nto find such a placement for E.W. after the district court's judgment.\n\n        We do not suggest that should a trial court find that a patient, for medical reasons, needs\n\ninstitutionalized care, it must nonetheless order placement in a community-based treatment program.\n\nWe recognize that the determination whether a patient can be appropriately placed in a\n\ncommunity-based treatment program is a fluid one, subject to change as the patient's medical\n\ncondition improves or worsens. Over the course of litigation, there may be times that a patient can\n\nbe treated in the community, and others where an institutional placement is necessary. But where,\n\nas here, the evidence is clear that all the experts agree that, at a given time, the patient could be\n\ntreated in a more integrated setting, the ADA mandates that it do so at that time unless placing that\n\nindividual would constitute a fundamental alteration in the state's provision of services. Nothing in\n\nthe ADA, however, forbids a state from moving a patient back to an institutionalized treatment\n\nsetting, as the patient's condition necessitates.\n\n        Under these principles, the district court correctly denied the State's motion for summary\n\njudgment. Summary judgment is not precluded here by the fact that, at earlier times in the litigation,\n\nsome of the State's experts opined that E.W. could not be placed in the community immediately.\n\nNone of the State's experts concluded that E.W. needed to be placed at GRH-A on a long-term basis.\n\nAt most, they believed that, in the short term, continued hospitalization was necessary in order to\n\npermit E.W. to make the transition to a community-based living arrangement in a group home.\n\n\n   9\n    In early 1995, the experts at GRH-A themselves recognized that E.W. could be placed\noutside GRH-A. They repeatedly placed her in personal care homes, providing her with a\ncommunity setting for her treatment. She was not placed, however, in a community setting with\nthe appropriate level of monitoring, and, as a result, she returned to GRH-A after extremely short\nstays in the community.\n\fAlthough one of the State's experts, Joseph Steed, expressed concerns that E.W. would not progress\n\nto the point where she could be placed in the community, the evidence in the record shows that, in\n\nthe spring and summer of 1996—after Steed's initial assessment as well as the others cited by the\n\nState—GRH-A attempted to find a community placement for E.W., but could not because there were\n\nno available state Medicaid waiver funds for such a placement.\n\n        Accordingly, because the State's own professionals agreed that E.W. could be placed in a less\n\nsegregated setting, the State has failed to demonstrate that there is a material issue of fact for trial\n\nas required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment was not in error.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n        In Part II we rejected the State's argument that it complied with the ADA in this case because\n\nthe denial of community placements to L.C. and E.W. was based on the State's lack of funds, not on\n\nplaintiffs' disabilities. We must now address whether the lack of available funding provides the\n\nState a defense to plaintiffs' ADA claim.\n\n        Notwithstanding that under the ADA and its Title II regulations the State has a duty to\n\nprovide integrated services when the patient's care warrants such services, that duty is not absolute.\n\nAs discussed above, the State need not provide these services if to do so would require a\n\nfundamental alteration in its programs. Under Title II, \"[a] public entity shall make reasonable\n\nmodifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the\n\nmodifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\" 28 C.F.R.\n\n§ 35.130(b)(7).\n\n        L.C. and E.W. have demonstrated that the State may reasonably modify its provision of\n\nservices by providing treatment to them in an integrated setting. L.C. and E.W. point out that, under\n\fGeorgia law, the State has the authority to transfer funds between institutional and community-based\n\ntreatment programs based on need. O.C.G.A. § 37-2-5.1(c)(3) (1995). They also note that, under\n\nthe federal government's Medicaid waiver program, the State may spend Medicaid funds to provide\n\ncommunity-based care to disabled persons who would otherwise be eligible for institutionalized\n\ncare. The federal government has authorized matching federal dollars for over 2100 patients in\n\nGeorgia, but, in 1996, the State used only 700 of these slots. See Hopkins Dep. at 18-19. Finally,\n\nthey argue that the State can provide integrated community-based services at significantly less cost\n\nthan institutionalized care.\n\n       The availability of these alternate sources of funding makes L.C.'s and E.W.'s request for\n\nmodification of the State's program of providing services to disabled persons a reasonable one \" \"in\n\nthe run of cases.' \" Willis, 108 F.3d at 286 n. 2 (quoting Barth v. Gelb, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"628594\"><a href=\"/opinion/628594/donald-barth-v-bruce-s-gelb-director-united-states-information-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1187\n\n(D.C.Cir.1993)). Accordingly, it is the State's duty to demonstrate that providing treatment to L.C.\n\nand E.W. fundamentally alters the nature of the service it provides \" \"in the context of the particular\n\nagency's operations.' \" Id.; Helen L., 46 F.3d at 337; H.R.Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3 at 51 (noting\n\nimportance of \"size and budget\" of the particular agency).\n\n       The State does not argue that the relief requested by L.C. and E.W. will effect a fundamental\n\nalteration by requiring it to dismantle its provision of institutionalized care to individuals with\n\ndisabilities. Instead, the State argues that it lacks the funds to provide community-based services\n\nto L.C. and E.W. The district court rejected this argument, reasoning that the State could provide\n\ncommunity-based services to L.C. and E.W. at less cost than providing institutional care for them\n\nat GRH-A.       Accordingly, it found that the State's purported lack of funds to provide\n\ncommunity-based services to L.C. and E.W. was insufficient as a matter of law to establish that\n\nproviding community-based care to plaintiffs would constitute a fundamental alteration.\n\f        Under the ADA, as with other federal statutes, \"[i]nadequate state appropriations do not\n\nexcuse noncompliance\" with federal law.

We recognized this principle in United States\n\nv. Board of Trustees for University of Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544780\"><a href=\"/opinion/544780/united-states-of-america-cross-appellant-v-the-board-of-trustees-for-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (11th Cir.1990). There, we held that,\n\nconsidering the size of the University of Alabama's transportation budget, the University failed to\n\nshow that an additional expenditure of $15,000 to modify its bus system to reasonably accommodate\n\nindividuals with disabilities would impose an undue financial hardship. The University could not\n\nsimply claim that it lacked the funds to make these modifications in its bus system; rather it could\n\nonly justify its discriminatory treatment by demonstrating that its transportation budget could not\n\nbe reasonably modified to take account of the needs of the disabled. In light of its \"annual\n\ntransportation budget of $1.2 million,\" we concluded that requiring minimal additional expenditures\n\nof $15,000 would not \"cause an undue financial burden on UAB.\" Id. at 751.\n\n       The district court did not consider whether treating L.C. and E.W. would require additional\n\nexpenditures and if so, whether the State had met its burden of proving that those expenditures were\n\nunreasonable in light of the State's mental health budget. Instead, it noted that the State currently\n\fprovided community-based services to individuals with disabilities and that such services could be\n\nprovided at less cost than segregated services. Based on these two factors, the district court\n\nconcluded that the State had failed to show that providing community-based care to L.C. and E.W.\n\nwould cause an fundamental alteration.\n\n       There is evidence in the record that suggests that, because of fixed overhead costs associated\n\nwith providing institutional care, the State will be able to save money by moving patients from\n\ninstitutionalized care to community-based care only when it shuts down entire hospitals or hospital\n\nwings, but not when it moves one or two patients from a hospital into the community. See Olmstead\n\nDep. at 78-80; Bliss Dep. at 33-34. Thus, it may be that requiring the State to treat L.C. and E.W.\n\nin a community-based program will require additional expenditure of state funds.\n\n        Nonetheless, the ADA may still require the State to expend additional funds in order to\n\nprovide L.C. and E.W. with integrated services. Unless the State can prove that requiring it to make\n\nthese additional expenditures would be so unreasonable given the demands of the State's mental\n\nhealth budget that it would fundamentally alter the service it provides, the ADA requires the State\n\nto make these additional expenditures. Because the district court did not consider this question and\n\nbecause of the complexity of the factual issues concerning the funding for mental health services in\n\nGeorgia, we remand this case to the district court for further proceedings on this issue. In\n\ndetermining whether the State can meet its burden of establishing a fundamental alteration, the\n\ndistrict court should consider, among other things: (1) whether the additional expenditures\n\nnecessary to treat L.C. and E.W. in community-based care would be unreasonable given the\n\ndemands of the State's mental health budget; (2) whether it would be unreasonable to require the\n\nState to use additional available Medicaid waiver slots, as well as its authority under Georgia law\n\nto transfer funds from institutionalized care to community-based care, to minimize any financial\n\fburden on the State; and (3) whether any difference in the cost of providing institutional or\n\ncommunity-based care will lessen the State's financial burden.10 This list, is, of course, not\n\nexclusive. The district court may also consider any other factors it believes are relevant to the\n\nfundamental alteration inquiry.\n\n        Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED and the case is REMANDED\n\nfor further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n   10\n     We note that this case is not a class action, but a challenge brought on behalf of two\nindividual plaintiffs. Our holding is not meant to resolve the more difficult questions of\nfundamental alteration that might be present in a class action suit seeking deinstitutionalization\nof a state hospital.\n\f</pre>",
