The parties litigated the issue of whether three construction\n\n        firms had defaulted on a contract, thus triggering coverage under a performance\n\n        bond issued by the surety companies. At issue is whether the existence of a\n\n        statutory fee provision bars equitable remedies available at common law for\n\n        coverage disputes and whether the trial court correctly determined that segregation\n\n        between covered and uncovered fees was impossible. The Court of Appeals\n\n        affirmed the award of Olympic Steamship fees and held that the trial court did not\n\n        abuse its discretion in determining that the fees could not be segregated. Olympic\n\n        S.S. Co. v. Centennial Ins. Co., 117 Wn.2d 37, 811 P.2d 673 (1991). For the\n\n        reasons discussed below, we now affirm.\n\n                                  FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n               The underlying facts are not at issue here, having been resolved by a jury\n\n        trial and being unchallenged by petitioners on appeal. In 2006, King County\n\n        contracted with three construction firms-Vinci Construction Grands Projets,\n\n        Parsons RCI, and Frontier-Kemper JV (collectively VPFK)-to expand its\n\n        wastewater treatment system. This expansion entailed the construction of a new\n\n        treatment plant along with three new conveyance tunnels that would increase the\n\n        treatment system's capacity to manage additional sewage from both Snohomish\n\n\n\n                                                       2\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Pro.Jets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nCounty and King County residents and businesses. Because the project would\n\nimpact public health, the environment, and local economic growth, King County\n\nrequired substantial completion of the project by November 14, 2010.\n\n       VPFK won the bid to construct the second and third sections of the central\n\ntunnel, which together would measure 18 feet in diameter and 31,700 feet in\n\nlength. Further, both sections of the tunnel were to be excavated concurrently.\n\nUnder the terms of the contract, VPFK secured a performance bond from five\n\nsurety companies: Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Travelers Casualty and\n\nSurety Company of America, Federal Insurance Company, Fidelity and Deposit\n\nCompany of Maryland, and Zurich American Insurance Company (collectively\n\nSureties). IfVPFK failed to perform under the terms of the contract, the\n\nperformance bond obligated the Sureties to step in and \"promptly remedy the\n\ndefault in a manner acceptable to [King County].\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 5542.\n\n       Throughout the project, VPFK encountered a number of difficulties with its\n\nequipment and management. At the time of its bid, VPFK estimated it could dig\n\n57 feet per day on the longest tunnel, yet during the course of construction it\n\naveraged only 28 feet per day. VPFK's tunnel-boring machines broke down\n\nnumerous times, including one nine-month delay during which VPKF attempted\n\n(and failed) to ease the tunnel's atmospheric pressure by removing groundwater\n\nbefore repairing the stalled machine. VPFK submitted numerous change orders\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nand at one point agreed to establish a workshop of experts from various disciplines\n\nto \"'mutually review all aspects of the tunneling operation to develop strategies for\n\nthe remaining construction.'\" Id. at 7046.\n\n       When it became clear that VPFK was not \"prosecuting the Work with\n\nsufficient diligence to achieve Substantial Completion within the Contract Time,\"\n\nKing County declared VPFK to be in default and requested a corrective action plan\n\nthat would ensure completion within the contract's deadline. Id. at 576. VPFK\n\nsubmitted its revised schedule to King County, estimating a completion date\n\nseveral years past the contract's deadline and at a significantly greater cost. As a\n\nresult, King County entered into an interim agreement with VPFK to hire a\n\ndifferent contractor to complete a portion of the work.\n\n       King County notified the Sureties of its plan and requested that the Sureties\n\neither cure VPFK's default themselves or agree to fund the new contractor.\n\nInstead, the Sureties argued that performance was not required under the bond\n\nbecause no breach had occurred. On April 19, 2010, King County filed suit against\n\nVPFK and one of the sureties, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of\n\nAmerica, claiming breach of contract and seeking declaratory relief that VPFK was\n\nin default and that the Sureties were joint and severally liable. The remaining four\n\nsurety companies intervened, and together the Sureties, while denying coverage,\n\nalso adopted all of VPFK's defenses against breach of contract.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fKing County v. Vinci Cons tr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\n       At trial, the jury was asked to consider whether \"VPFK was in default of its\n\nobligations under the Contract by failing to perform its work so as to ensure\n\nsubstantial completion by the Contract deadline\" and whether \"the Sureties\n\nbreached their obligations under the Bond because the Sureties failed to pay King\n\nCounty's costs and expenses incurred because ofVPFK's default.\" Id. at 9091.\n\nThe jury found in favor of King County and awarded nearly $130 million in\n\ndamages. Pursuant to Olympic Steamship, 117 Wn.2d 37, the trial court awarded\n\nKing County its attorney fees and costs totaling nearly $15 million. The trial court\n\nfurther held that the fees could not be segregated because King County's claim\n\nagainst the Sureties was intertwined and indistinguishable from its claim against\n\nVPFK.\n\n       On appeal, the Sureties argued that Olympic Steamship did not apply\n\nbecause the fee provisions of RCW 39.04.240 are the exclusive fee remedy in\n\npublic works contracts. Further, the Sureties disagreed with the trial court's\n\ndetermination that the fees could not be segregated. The Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the award of fees, holding both that RCW 39.04.240 was not the\n\nexclusive fee remedy and that the fees could not be segregated. King County v.\n\nVinci Constr.

Did the trial court err in determining that the award of attorney fees\n\ncould not be segregated?\n\n                                          ANALYSIS\n\n       An award of attorney fees is an issue of law that this court reviews de novo.\n\nDurland v. San Juan County, 182 Wn.2d 55, 76, 340 P.3d 191 (2014).\n\n\"Washington follows the American rule in awarding attorney fees.\" Dayton v.\n\nFarmers Ins. Grp., 124 Wn.2d 277,280, 876 P.2d 896 (1994). Under the\n\nAmerican rule, a court may award fees only when doing so is authorized by a\n\ncontract provision, a statute, or a recognized ground in equity. Hamm v. State\n\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 151 Wn.2d 303, 325, 88 P.3d 395 (2004). One such\n\nequitable ground is the rule announced in Olympic Steamship. 117 Wn.2d at 53.\n\n       In Olympic Steamship, an insured warehouseman sought reimbursement of\n\nclaims paid to salmon packers from its general comprehensive liability insurer. Id.\n\n\n\n                                               6\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nat 39-40. The insurers denied coverage for the claims, forcing the warehouseman\n\nto file suit. Id. at 40. When the warehouseman prevailed at trial, we awarded\n\nattorney fees, holding that \"an award of fees is required in any legal action where\n\nthe insurer compels the insured to assume the burden of legal action, to obtain the\n\nfull benefit of his insurance contract.\" Id. at 53.\n\n       The fee rule announced in Olympic Steamship applies equally to suretyships\n\nand performance bonds. In 2007, four justices of this court noted that there is no\n\nmaterial distinction between performance bonds and insurance contracts and that\n\n\"all surety bonds are regarded as 'in the nature' of insurance contracts.\" Colo.\n\nStructures, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of W., 161 Wn.2d 577, 598, 167 P.3d 1125 (2007)\n\n(plurality opinion) (quoting Nat'l Bank of Wash. v. Equity Inv 'rs, 86 Wn.2d 545,\n\n553, 546 P.2d 440 (1976)). Although there are certainly many distinctions\n\nbetween suretyship and insurance, the lead opinion noted that \"the relative\n\npositions of the contractor and the surety compel, pursuant to Olympic Steamship,\n\nan award of attorney fees when the surety wrongfully denies coverage.\" Id. at 601\n\n(Chambers, J., lead opinion). Justice Sanders agreed on the issue of awarding\n\nattorney fees in his dissenting opinion, describing this as a separate, \"second\n\nissue.\" Id. at 638 (Sanders, J., dissenting). Thus, a majority 1 of the court agreed\n\n\n       1\n         The Sureties quote a footnote in Matsyuk v. State Farm Fire & Casualty Co., 173\nWn.2d 643, 660 n.5, 272 P.3d 802 (2012), stating that \"'Colorado Structures does not have a\nmajority rule.\"' Sureties' Suppl. Br. at 11. But as amici correctly point out, \"footnote 5 was\n\n\n                                                7\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr.

In the nine years since Colorado Structures, the\n\nlegislature has not acted contrary to our holding. Without a \"'clear showing that an\n\nestablished rule is incorrect and harmful,'\" we shall not revisit settled legal\n\n\n\n\ncertainly 'not ... essential to [Matsyuk's] determination,' and therefore relegates that footnote to\nobiter dictum.\" Br. of Amici Curiae Wash.

Foodmaker, Inc., 152\n\nWn.2d 138, 147, 94 P.3d 930 (2004)).\n\n       Instead, we consider first whether the existence of a statutory fee remedy\n\nenacted after our decision in Colorado Structures reveals an intent by the\n\nlegislature to exclude all other fee remedies in public works contracts, including\n\nthe equitable remedy under Olympic Steamship and Colorado Structures. For the\n\nreasons discussed below, we hold that it does not.\n\nA.     RCW 39.04.240 is not the exclusive fee remedy in a public works contract\n\n       Under Washington law, the prevailing party to an action for damages not\n\nexceeding $10,000 may be awarded attorney fees. RCW 4.84.250. The party\n\nseeking relief is deemed to have prevailed in the action \"when the recovery,\n\nexclusive of costs, is as much as or more than the amount offered in settlement by\n\nthe ... party seeking relief.\" RCW 4.84.260. Service of a settlement offer must be\n\nmade within a specific period of time after filing suit. RCW 4.84.280. Pursuant to\n\nRCW 39.04.240, the provisions set forth in RCW 4.84.250 through RCW 4.84.280\n\nalso apply to actions arising out of a public works contract, with revisions to the\n\ntime period for serving settlement offers and removal of the $10,000 maximum.\n\n       \"The legislature has the power to supersede, abrogate, or modify the\n\ncommon law.\" Potter v. Wash. State Patrol, 165 Wn.2d 67, 76, 196 P.3d 691\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\n(2008). However, we will not deviate from the common law \"'unless the language\n\nof a statute be clear and explicit for this purpose.\"' Id. at 77 (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (quoting Norfolk Redevelopment & Haus. Auth. v. Chesapeake &\n\nPotomac Tel. Co. of Va., 464 U.S. 30, 35, 104 S. Ct. 304, 78 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1983)).\n\nIn determining whether a statute supersedes, abrogates, or modifies the common\n\nlaw, we will look to the language of the statute, whether that language contains an\n\nexpress statement of exclusivity, and other expressions of legislative intent. Id. at\n\n80. Alternatively, legislative intent to repeal the common law may be found where\n\n\"'the provisions of a ... statute are so inconsistent with and repugnant to the prior\n\ncommon law that both cannot simultaneously be in force.\"' Id. (alteration in\n\noriginal) (quoting State ex rel. Madden v. Pub. Util. Dist. No. 1, 83 Wn.2d 219,\n\n222, 517 P.2d 585 (1973)). Therefore, in order to find that RCW 39.04.240\n\nprovides the exclusive means for recovering attorney fees in this action, we must\n\nfind either that the legislature explicitly intended such exclusivity or that RCW\n\n39.04.240 is so inconsistent with Olympic Steamship that they both cannot\n\nsimultaneously apply.\n\n       The Sureties correctly point out that an award of fees under RCW 4.84.250-\n\n.280 as applied by RCW 39.04.240 requires that the prevailing party make a timely\n\nsettlement offer. RCW 4.84.260; Sureties' Suppl. Br. at 6. However, this is a\n\ncondition precedent to recovery under this statutory scheme; it does not represent a\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fKing County v. Vinci Cons tr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nlimitation on awarding attorney fees in the context of public works contracts and\n\ninsurance coverage. There is no language within either RCW 4.84.250-.280 or\n\nRCW 39.04.240 suggesting that the legislature intended to exclude all other means\n\nof recovering attorney fees. The legislature simply took an existing statutory\n\nremedy and made it available to actions arising out of a public works contract.\n\n       There is nothing in the legislative history indicating that RCW 39.04.240\n\nwas intended to proscribe alternative fee remedies. Testimony for the original bill\n\nstated quite plainly that \"[t]he purpose of the bill is to encourage settlements.\"\n\nH.B. REP. ON ENGROSSED S.B. 6407, at 2, 52d Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1992).\n\nBecause \"[p]ublic agencies seem to react to litigation as if their attorneys are free,\"\n\nthe legislature expected an award of fees to result in \"decision[s] to pursue the law\n\nsuit ... on the merits of the case and not on the costs of going to court.\" Id. There\n\nis no indication that the bill was a reaction to a court decision allowing for\n\nequitable remedies, and in the final bill report for RCW 39.04.240, the legislature\n\nrecognized that attorney fees may be awarded as authorized by statute, contract, or\n\nequitable common law grounds.

(Wash. 1992).\n\n       Seven years later, the legislature amended RCW 39.04.240 to remove the\n\nmaximum pleading amount of $250,000. LAWS OF 1999, ch. 107, § 1(1).\n\nTestimony in favor of the bill pointed out that \"[t]hese contracts are very one-\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fK\"ing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nsided, and in cases near the $250,000 limit, the public agency has little incentive to\n\ncompromise or settle now.\" H.B. REP. ON H.B. 1671, at 2, 56th Leg., Reg. Sess.\n\n(Wash. 1999). The legislature noted that the statute \"works very well to save both\n\nsides time and money\" and that removing the maximum pleading amount would\n\n\"force both sides to act reasonably.\" Id. While clearly encouraging resolution of\n\nclaims through settlement, there was no language indicating an intent to foreclose\n\nexisting alternative equitable remedies recognized at common law.\n\n       Finally, the provisions of RCW 4.84.250-.280 are not \"'so inconsistent with\n\nand repugnant to'\" other available remedies as to evidence the legislature's intent\n\nfor exclusivity. Potter, 165 Wn.2d at 77 (quoting State ex rel. Madden v. Pub.\n\nUtil. Dist. No. 1, 83 Wn.2d 219,222,517 P.2d 585 (1973)). The dissent by Justice\n\nWiggins does not distinguish between coverage disputes and claims disputes-a\n\ndistinction that is critical here because each fee remedy applies to only one type of\n\ndispute or the other. While a single case may entail both a coverage and a claims\n\ndispute, there is never a situation where \"both avenues of recovery are available\"\n\nfor the same part of the dispute. Dissent at 1.\n\n       An award of attorney fees under Olympic Steamship is restricted to disputes\n\nwhere the insurer forces the insured to litigate coverage and then loses.

App. at 721\n\n(\"Fees are awarded under Olympic Steamship where the insurer unsuccessfully\n\ndenies coverage, not where the insurer acknowledges coverage but disputes the\n\nvalue of the claim.\").\n\n       By way of operation, RCW 4.84.250 does not apply to coverage disputes\n\nbecause such disputes are legal in nature: either there is coverage under the\n\nlanguage of the insurance contract or bond or there is not. See, e.g., Colo.\n\nStructures, 161 Wn.2d at 606 (\"Since the question is a legal one, which required\n\nStructures to litigate to obtain a declaratory judgment ruling regarding the meaning\n\nof the contract, it is a coverage dispute.\"). On the other hand, the statutory fee\n\nremedy clearly envisions a situation where the parties disagree about the amount\n\nowed rather than the legal question of whether performance has been triggered.\n\n\n\n                                               13\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Pro.Jets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nSee id. (\"This case would be in the nature of a claims dispute if [the surety] had\n\nagreed to pay under the bond, but had a factual dispute with Structures as to the\n\namount of the payment.\" (emphasis omitted)). Any pretrial settlement offer by the\n\nsureties must naturally include an agreement that performance is owed, and once\n\nthe parties agree that performance is owed, Olympic Steamship fees are no longer\n\navailable.\n\n       As is often the case, many disputes involve both a coverage question and a\n\nclaims question. The dissent argues that such a scenario \"demonstrates that the\n\ntwo separate [fee remedies] are repugnant to one another and cannot apply\n\nsimultaneously.\" Dissent at 4. However, the dissent also recognizes the\n\nappropriate mechanism for resolving this issue: \"[T]he court could potentially\n\napportion the fees between coverage and damages.\" Id. In fact, we have instructed\n\ncourts to do just that when an award of attorney fees is authorized for some, but not\n\nall, of one party's claims. Hume v. Am. Disposal Co., 124 Wn.2d 656, 672, 880\n\nP.2d 988 (1994) (directing the court to segregate an award of fees when\n\nnecessary); see Mayer v.

App. 409, 426-27, 213 P.3d 931\n\n(2009).\n\n       Following our settled rules, the trial court in the example above would\n\nsegregate the fees related to the coverage question from fees related to the amount\n\n\n\n                                               14\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nowed. The public body would be entitled to the former, and the surety would be\n\nentitled to the latter. The statutory fee remedy is not inconsistent with and\n\nrepugnant to the fee rule in Olympic Steamship merely because each party receives\n\nan award of fees for different parts of the same case.\n\n       Under the facts of this case, King County opted not to include a fee\n\nprovision in either the construction contract or the performance bond, both of\n\nwhich were drafted by King County. See RCW 4.84.330. As the Sureties suggest,\n\nthis may have been a strategic decision to limit liability for attorney fees in the\n\nevent that King County found itself in breach of the contract. Sureties' Suppl. Br.\n\nat 5. King County did not make an offer of settlement under RCW 39.04.240, but\n\nthat too is not surprising. As mentioned above, there is very little middle ground\n\non which to construct a settlement offer in a pure coverage dispute; King County\n\ninsisted there was coverage under the bond, and the Sureties insisted there was not.\n\nInstead of performing under a reservation of rights, the Sureties compelled King\n\nCounty to assume the burden of legal action to obtain the benefit of the\n\nperformance bond by proving that a breach had occurred. Thus, attorney fees were\n\navailable under Olympic Steamship. 117 Wn.2d at 53.\n\nB.     The fees in this case could not be segregated because the Sureties adopted\n       the contract defenses of VPFK\n\n       The Sureties next argue that the trial court erred when it failed to segregate\n\nthe fees between King County's claim against VPFK and King County's claim\n\n\n                                               15\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nagainst the Sureties. However, by adopting the entirety of VPFK's defenses\n\nagainst breach, the Sureties made the two claims indistinguishable. The Court of\n\nAppeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that\n\nsegregation was impossible. We agree.\n\n       We review the trial court's determination of whether segregation is possible\n\nfor abuse of discretion. Mayer, 156 Wn.2d at 693. The trial court abuses its\n\ndiscretion '\"when its exercise of discretion is manifestly unreasonable or based\n\nupon untenable grounds or reasons.\"' Allard v. First Interstate Bank of Wash., NA,\n\n112 Wn.2d 145, 148, 768 P.2d 998, 773 P.2d 420 (1989) (quoting Davis v. Globe\n\nMach. Mfg. Co., 102 Wn.2d 68, 77,684 P.2d 692 (1984)). \"If ... an attorney fees\n\nrecovery is authorized for only some of the claims, the attorney fees award must\n\nproperly reflect a segregation of the time spent on issues for which attorney fees\n\nare authorized from time spent on other issues.\" Hume, 124 Wn.2d at 672.\n\nHowever, segregation of fees is not necessary where \"the trial court finds the\n\nclaims to be so related that no reasonable segregation of successful and\n\nunsuccessful claims can be made.\" Id. at 673.\n\n       The Sureties argue that King County's lawsuit involved a claims dispute, not\n\na coverage dispute, and was separate from the cause of action against VPFK.\n\nSureties' Suppl. Br. at 19. We find the Sureties' argument unpersuasive against\n\nthe weight of the record before us. Prior to litigation, the Sureties asserted that\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\n\"the County's handling of the Project deprived the Co-Sureties of their rights,\n\nthereby prejudicing them and barring claims on the Bond.\" Ex. 162, at 20\n\n(emphasis added). The Sureties further declared as follows: \"VPFK is not in\n\ndefault of its contract obligations and the County has not performed its obligations\n\nthereunder. Accordingly, the County's claim is respectfully denied. All rights and\n\ndefenses are fully reserved.\" Id. at 20-21. At trial, the court found that the\n\nSureties \"adopted all ofVPFK's defenses in this case, including claims for various\n\ndiffering site condition ... claims, which, if proved in their entirety, would defeat\n\nKing County's claim of default.\" CP at 4489. Finally, the Sureties admitted that\n\nthey had ultimately made the decision to deny coverage under the bond. Certified\n\nTr. (Mar. 22, 2013) at 77. Clearly, the Sureties were not debating the amount\n\nowed under the performance bond-rather, the Sureties took the position that\n\nperformance under the bond had not been triggered because no default had\n\noccurred.\n\n       Of course, it is not difficult to understand the litigation strategy at play here.\n\nSuccessful defense of the breach claim against VPFK meant that the Sureties\n\nwould not be called on to perform under the bond. Although the Sureties suggest\n\nthey \"played no meaningful role in the lengthy trial,\" Sureties' Suppl. Br. at 19, the\n\ntrial court's findings in fact suggest that the Sureties vigorously worked to defeat\n\nKing County's claims against VPFK. See CP at 4487. Additionally, the Sureties\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nretained five different experts to buttress VPFK's contract defenses dealing with\n\nscheduling and productivity, geological conditions, mechanical tunneling and\n\nmining, and mud and slurry issues. The Sureties joined with VPFK in requesting\n\njury instructions linking liability under the bond to a finding that VPFK was liable\n\nfor King County's damages. And defense counsel in closing argument reasserted\n\nthat the Sureties' panel of expert consultants \"confirmed what VPFK had been\n\nsaying all along, that there was no default.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Dec.\n\n6, 2012) at 7022.\n\n       King County could prevail in asserting coverage under the performance\n\nbond only by defeating VPFK's defenses against breach, and the Sureties threw\n\ntheir considerable legal weight behind these defenses. While the Sureties'\n\nlitigation strategy was sensible, it resulted in the claims becoming inseparable. As\n\nthe trial court correctly noted, the issues of breach and coverage under the bond\n\nshared a \"common core of facts.\" CP at 4529; see Fiore v. PPG Indus., Inc., 169\n\nWn. App. 325,352, 279 P.3d 972 (2012). The jury instructions squarely presented\n\nthe claims against VPFK and the Sureties together. When attorneys for King\n\nCounty prepared to argue the issue of breach, they had to contend not just with\n\ncounterarguments from VPFK but from the Sureties as well. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in finding that the attorney fees could not be\n\nsegregated.\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fKing County v.

Although a statutory fee provision exists\n\nfor public works contracts under RCW 39.04.240, we hold that it is not the\n\nexclusive fee remedy available.

(dissenting)-The   legislature   provided    a    clear   and\n\ncomprehensive statute for recovering attorney fees in public works contract disputes.\n\nThe statute, RCW 39.04.240, explicitly seeks to encourage settlement by requiring all\n\nparties to make and improve on a settlement offer before they may recover attorney\n\nfees. This legislative scheme is \"inconsistent with and repugnant to\" the equitable\n\nground for awarding fees under Olympic S.S. Co. v. Centennial Ins. Co., 117 Wn.2d\n\n37, 811 P.2d 673 (1991 ); if both avenues for recovery are available, then public entities\n\nare free to disregard the statute's dictates. State ex rel. Madden v. Pub. Util. Dist. No.\n\n1, 83 Wn.2d 219, 222, 517 P.2d 585 (1973). As a result, the statute plainly preempts\n\nOlympic Steamship, providing the exclusive remedy for recovery of attorney fees in\n\npublic works contract disputes. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n                          RCW 39.04.240 Is the Exclusive Remedy\n\n      The majority sets out the proper test for determining whether a statute\n\nabrogates prior common law, but then applies it improperly. We must (1) find explicit\n\nlegislative intent that a statute be the exclusive remedy or (2) determine that a statute\n\nis so inconsistent with prior common law that both cannot simultaneously apply. See\n\nmajority at 9-1 O; RCW 39.04.240.\n\n      RCW 39.04.240 establishes a process for awarding attorney fees to the\n\nprevailing party in a public works contract. The statute adopts the award process found\n\nin RCW 4.84.250 through 4.84.280, and removes the limit on damages found in those\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets!Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\nstatutes. RCW 39.04.240(1 ). It incorporates the requirement that \"in any action for\n\ndamages ... there shall be taxed and allowed to the prevailing party as a part of the\n\ncosts of the action a reasonable amount to be fixed by the court as attorneys' fees.\"\n\nRCW 4.84.250.\n\n      A plaintiff is the prevailing party when he or she recovers as much as or more\n\nthan the amount that the plaintiff offered in settlement. RCW 4.84.260. A defendant is\n\nthe prevailing party when the plaintiff recovers as much as or less than the amount\n\nthat the defendant offered in settlement. RCW 4.84.270. Thus, the statutes require\n\nboth plaintiffs and defendants to make and improve on settlement offers before they\n\nmay recover attorney fees.\n\n       Parties may not contract around these requirements. \"The rights provided\n\nfor ... may not be waived by the parties to a public works contract ... , and a provision\n\nin such a contract that provides for waiver of these rights is void as against public\n\npolicy.\" RCW 39.04.240(2).\n\n       Inconsistency with Prior Common Law\n\n       \"When determining whether a statute is exclusive, the court should strive to\n\nuphold the purpose of the statute.\" Potter v. Wash. State Patrol, 165 Wn.2d 67, 87,\n\n196 P.3d 691 (2008). \"To determine legislative intent, we look first to the language of\n\nthe statute.\" State v. Watson, 146 Wn.2d 947, 954, 51 P.3d 66 (2002). We may also\n\nuse principles of statutory construction and legislative history to help in our\n\ninterpretation. Id. at 955; see also Potter, 165 Wn.2d at 88 (examining legislative\n\nhistory to determine whether it would frustrate the legislative purpose of the statute if\n\n\n                                          2\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets!Parsons RC/I\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\nwe allowed the common law action to proceed). \"Where ... the provisions of a later\n\nstatute are so inconsistent with and repugnant to the prior common law that both\n\ncannot simultaneously be in force, the statute will be deemed to abrogate the common\n\nlaw.\" State ex rel. Madden, 83 Wn.2d at 222.\n\n   1. Statutory Language\n\n      The statutory language here is inconsistent with and repugnant to Olympic\n\nSteamship. The statute and Olympic Steamship define a \"prevailing party\" in\n\nfundamentally different ways. The statute also prohibits parties from contracting\n\naround its requirements. As a result, both cannot be in force simultaneously.\n\n      As discussed above, RCW 39.04.240 requires prevailing parties both to make\n\na settlement offer and to then improve on the offer. To prevail, a plaintiff must recover\n\nthe same as or more than his or her settlement offer. RCW 4.84.260. A defendant may\n\nprevail only when the plaintiff recovers the same as or less than the defendant's\n\nsettlement offer. RCW 4.84.270. Parties may not waive these requirements. RCW\n\n39.04.240(2).\n\n       Olympic Steamship has none of these requirements. Olympic Steamship\n\ndefines a \"prevailing party\" as a party who wins a lawsuit, when that lawsuit is forced\n\nby an insurer's refusal \"to defend or pay the ... claim.\" Olympic S.S., 117 Wn.2d at\n\n52-53 (holding \"that an award of fees is required in any legal action where the insurer\n\ncompels the insured to assume the burden of legal action, to obtain the full benefit of\n\nhis insurance contract, regardless of whether the insurer's duty to defend is at issue\").\n\nColo. Structures, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of W, 161 Wn.2d 577, 601, 167 P.3d 1125 (2007)\n\n\n                                          3\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets/Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper, .JV, No. 927 44-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\n(plurality opinion), 1 expanded the \"prevailing party\" definition to a party who wins a\n\nlawsuit when \"the surety wrongfully denies coverage.\"\n\n       These inconsistent definitions cannot be in force simultaneously, especially in\n\nlight of the statutory prohibition on waiver of the statutory requirements. To adopt the\n\nmajority's conclusion to the contrary would lead to absurd results. For example, under\n\nthe majority approach, both parties can be \"prevailing parties.\" If a public body prevails\n\non a coverage dispute and recovers a modest award against a surety, Olympic\n\nSteamship would entitle the public entity to attorney fees. But, if the surety made a\n\ntimely pretrial settlement offer that exceeded the recovery by the public entity, RCW\n\n39.04.240 entitles the surety to attorney fees. To resolve this conflict, the court could\n\npotentially apportion the fees between coverage and damages. But RCW 4.84.250\n\nthrough 4.84.280 have no language contemplating such a split. And, in circumstances\n\nlike those presented here, where the trial court finds that the fees cannot be\n\nsegregated, 2 what is the court to do? Regardless of the potential solutions, the\n\nexample demonstrates that the two separate definitions are repugnant to one another\n\nand cannot apply simultaneously.\n\n       The majority claims that distinguishing between coverage disputes and claims\n\ndisputes is critical here. Majority at 12. However, the majority ignores that coverage\n\n\n\n1 We agree with the majority that Colorado Structures should not be overruled. See majority\nat 7-9. In Colorado Structures, all parties involved were private parties. 161 Wn.2d at 581. In\ncontrast, RCW 39.04.240 applies only when a public entity is a party. RCW 39.04.240 (\"The\nprovisions ... shall apply to an action arising out of a public works contract in which the state\nor a municipality, or other public body that contracts for public works, is a party .... \").\n2 See majority at 14.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets!Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\ndisputes are not merely abstract questions; instead, they are brought to determine\n\nhow much money an insurance company owes.\n\n      RCW 4.84.250 permits recovery of attorney fees \"in any action for damages.\"\n\nSee RCW 39.04.240 (incorporating RCW 4.84.250's scheme by reference).\n\nTherefore, the question is whether a claim for coverage is part of establishing an\n\naction for damages for purposes of the statute. Absent context, a claim for establishing\n\ncoverage does not obviously seek damages but simply the resolution of a binary\n\nquestion: Does coverage exist or not? Yet, this approach ignores the obvious and\n\ninevitable goal of a coverage claim, which is to recover a dollar amount as a result of\n\ncoverage. Ultimately, a claim for coverage is an action for damages, thereby falling\n\nwithin the statute's scope.\n\n      The practical connection between coverage and damages is especially clear in\n\nthis case: King County sought to prove that VPFK was in default under the contract,\n\nthat coverage by the sureties was thus established, and that the sureties were\n\ntherefore required '\"to pay King County's costs and expenses incurred because of\n\nVPFK's default.\"' Majority at 5 (quoting Clerk's Papers at 9091 ). King County sought\n\ncosts and expenses at trial; coverage was simply a necessary precursor toward that\n\nend. Either party could make settlement offers in advance based on a monetary\n\namount.\n\n      We can also see how the statute would apply to possible settlement offers in\n\nthis case. Ultimately, the jury awarded King County close to $130 million. The fee\n\nrecovery statute would simply require that this total meet or exceed whatever\n\n                                          5\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets/Parsons RC!/\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\nsettlement amount was previously offered. Because there is no evidence that King\n\nCounty made any settlement offer, there was nothing to meet or exceed. Thus, King\n\nCounty is not entitled to recover fees under the statute. This approach acknowledges\n\nthe goals of coverage claims and the intent of the statute.\n\n       Even if we acknowledge that coverage and damages are two different issues,\n\nhere, they have been so \"intertwined\" as to be \"indistinguishable.\" Majority at 5. King\n\nCounty took the position-and prevailed-that coverage and determination of claims\n\nwere so interwoven in this case that King County should recover all its fees, not just\n\nthe fees incurred in establishing coverage. It is not clear why combining a coverage\n\nquestion with a claim for damages results in the entire claim being treated as a\n\ncoverage question. The reason for favoring the case's treatment as a coverage\n\nquestion is especially unclear in light of the statute's express purpose to encourage\n\nsettlement. All one has to do to avoid the statute's requirements is to raise a coverage\n\nissue as part of a claim for damages; then, the public entity is free of any settlement\n\nrequirements. Far from a strict program to require reasonable efforts at settlement in\n\norder to recover fees, the majority turns the statute into an optional and uninviting\n\nalternative.\n\n   2. Principles of Statutory Construction\n\n       Our principles of statutory construction also compel the conclusion that RCW\n\n39.04.240 abrogates Olympic Steamship in the public works context. First, since the\n\nstatute and Olympic Steamship both govern an award of attorney fees and are in\n\nconflict with one another, we should construe the more specific statute as prevailing\n\n\n                                          6\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets!Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\nover the more general common law. Second, we may not grant the equitable award\n\nof Olympic Steamship fees when there is a conflicting statutory method for recovery.\n\n       We construe specific statutes as prevailing over general statutes. 0. S. T.           v.\nRegence BlueShield,· 181 Wn.2d 691, 701, 335 P.3d 416 (2014). We apply this rule of\n\nstatutory construction when we conclude that the statutes concern the same subject\n\nmatter and \"conflict to the extent they cannot be harmonized.\" Id. Here, both RCW\n\n39.04.240 and Olympic Steamship govern an award of attorneys' fees. Their methods\n\nfor allowing an award of fees conflict and \"cannot be harmonized.\" Id. As a result, we\n\nshould construe the more specific statute, RCW 39.04.240, as prevailing over the\n\nmore general case law, Olympic Steamship.\n\n       In addition, we will \"not give relief on equitable grounds in contravention of a\n\nstatutory requirement.\" Longview Fibre Co. v. Cowlitz County, 114 Wn.2d 691, 699,\n\n790 P.2d 149 (1990); 3 see also Stephanus        v.   Anderson, 26 Wn. App. 326, 334, 613\n\nP.2d 533 (1980) (\"Equity, however, also follows the law and cannot provide a remedy\n\nwhere legislation expressly denies it.\"). RCW 39.04.240 clearly establishes the\n\nmethod for awarding attorney fees in public works contract disputes. Olympic\n\nSteamship, on the other hand, is an equitable remedy. As a result, the court cannot\n\naward equitable fees to King County under Olympic Steamship in contravention of\n\nRCW 39.04.240's requirements.\n\n\n\n3 See also Williams v. Duke, 125 Wash. 250, 254, 215 P. 372 (1923) ( \"'[W]herever the rights\nor the situation of the parties are clearly defined and established by law, equity has no power\nto change or unsettle those rights or that situation.\"' (quoting Magniac v. Thomson, 56 U.S.\n(15 How.) 281, 299, 14. L. Ed. 696 (1853)).\n\n                                             7\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets!Parsons RC/I\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\n       Nor should King County's equity arguments overcome the statute's dictates. It\n\nmatters not that the majority believes that the statute's requirements are inconvenient\n\nin these circumstances. See majority at 15 (\"As mentioned above, there is very little\n\nmiddle ground on which to construct a settlement offer in a pure coverage dispute.\").\n\nWe are not permitted to render the statute meaningless for public entities, even if we\n\nfind its effects problematic. See Williams, 125 Wash. at 253 (noting that we may not\n\nallow a party to \"invoke[] the aid of equity to relieve [it] from the force of the statutory\n\nrule\"). The legislature deliberately imposed the offer of settlement requirement on all\n\nparties to public works contracts. The proper recourse for public entities seeking a\n\nway around that requirement is to seek an exemption from the legislature. Longview\n\nFibre Co., 114 Wn.2d at 699 (\"Concerns over the efficacy of the statute are properly\n\naddressed to the Legislature.\").\n\n       The majority's reliance on policy justifications to preserve our common law is\n\nalso misplaced. See majority at 16. It is the legislature's role to weigh competing policy\n\ninterests. It did so here. Testimony offered to the legislature emphasized the policy\n\nconsiderations of trial efficiency and avoiding lengthy litigation. See H.B. REP. ON\n\nENGROSSED S.B. 6407, at 2, 52d Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1992); see also H.B. REP.\n\nON SUBSTITUTE H.B. 1671, at 2, 56th Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1999) (testimony that\n\n\"[t]he offer-of-settlement statute works very well to save both sides time and money\").\n\nWe cannot substitute the legislature's judgment with our own on this subject. State v.\n\nSmith, 93 Wn.2d 329, 337, 61 O P.2d 869 (1980) (\"The legislature represents the\n\npeople when it determines that a law is necessary, wise, or desirable, and the court is\n\n                                            8\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets/Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper; JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\nnot empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the legislature.\"). As a result, we\n\nmust conclude that Olympic Steamship is abrogated in these circumstances.\n\n   3. Legislative History\n\n       Legislative history further demonstrates that the statute and Olympic Steamship\n\nare inconsistent with one another. Our \"primary objective [when interpreting statutes]\n\nis to ascertain and give effect to the intent and purpose of the Legislature.\" Watson,\n\n146 Wn.2d at 954. This court may examine legislative history when interpreting what\n\na statute means. Id.\n\n       Here, as the majority acknowledges, the purpose of RCW 39.04.240 \"'is to\n\nencourage settlements.\"' Majority at 11 (quoting H.B. REP. ON ENGROSSED S.B. 6407,\n\nat 2. Testimony before the legislature noted that \"[p]ublic agencies seem to react to\n\nlitigation as if their attorneys are free,\" wasting public funds. H.B. REP. ON ENGROSSED\n\nS.B. 6407, at 2. RCW 39.04.240 would encourage settlement by requiring all parties,\n\nespecially public entities, in all public works contract disputes to make an offer of\n\nsettlement and improve on it at trial. See H.B. REP. ON SUBSTITUTE H.B. 1671, at 2\n\n(testimony that \"[t]hese contracts are very one sided\" and \"the public agency has little\n\nincentive to compromise or settle now\"). This condition of recovery created \"a two-\n\nedged sword that will force both sides to act reasonably.\" Id.\n\n       But the majority, by preserving the common law avenue of recovery, effectively\n\nnegates the legislature's incentive scheme. If a public entity may still recover its\n\nattorney fees without making and improving on an offer of settlement, there is no\n\nincentive for public agencies to seek fees under the statute's provisions. Instead, the\n\n\n                                          9\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr Grands Projets!Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\nstatute \"will become a 'white elephant remedy' that 'few, if any, [public entities] would\n\nchoose to invoke.'\" Wash. Water Power Co. v. Graybar Elec. Co., 112 Wn.2d 847,\n\n855-56, 774 P.2d 1199 (1989). Contrary to explicit legislative intent, the majority\n\nprovides public entities with a back door to escape the statute's requirements.\n\n                                       Conclusion\n\n       RCW 39.04.240 \"would accomplish little [to change the behavior of public\n\nentities] if it were a measure plaintiffs could choose or refuse to abide at their\n\npleasure.\" Id. Because the legislature intended the statute to encourage public entities\n\nto make reasonable settlement offers, the prior common law of Olympic Steamship\n\nallowing the recovery of fees without an offer of settlement is too inconsistent to apply\n\nsimultaneously with the statute. We must consider the common law abrogated in\n\nthese circumstances. 4\n\n       For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n4Since Olympic Steamship fees are not available, the question of whether the fees could be\nsegregated becomes moot, and we need not address it. See majority at 16-20.\n\n                                           10\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr.

Grands Projets, et al.\n\n\n\n\n                                       No. 92744-8\n\n\n       MADSEN, J. (concurring in dissent)-! concur with the dissent that a fee award\n\nunder Olympic Steamship Co. v. Centennial Ins. Co., 117 Wn.2d 37, 811 P.2d 673\n\n( 1991 ), would undermine the statutory scheme for fees arising out of a public works\n\ncontract found in RCW 39.04.240. Dissent at 1. I write separately because I would also\n\nhold that we should not extend Olympic Steamship fees to construction performance\n\nbonds. Contrary to the majority's recitation, there is no precedential opinion from this\n\ncourt that has held that such fees extend to this type of case. With no binding precedent, I\n\nwould decline the extension sought. Extending Olympia Steamship fees to construction\n\nperformance bonds is inappropriate because such bonds are fundamentally different from\n\ncasualty insurance policies. Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n\n       The majority purports to be following precedent in allowing Olympic Steamship\n\nfees in this case involving construction performance bonds, but the case that the majority\n\nrelies on, Colo. Structures, Inc. v. Ins. Co. ofW., 161 Wn.2d 577, 167 P.3d 1125 (2007)\n\n(plurality opinion), did not create binding precedent. Indeed, Colorado Structures was a\n\ndecision with only four justices signing the lead opinion. The fractured opinion in\n\nColorado Structures is similar to that in State v. Rhone, 168 Wn.2d 645, 229 P.3d 752\n\fNo. 92744-8\nMadsen, J., concurring in dissent\n\n\n(2010) (plurality opinion). In that case too, the separate concurrence expressed its\n\ndesired resolution of the case and opined how it would resolve future cases. Id. at 658.\n\nWe subsequently held that the dicta relating to future cases had no precedential value\n\nbecause it did not relate to the disposition of Rhone. State v. Meredith, 178 Wn.2d 180,\n\n184, 306 P.3d 942 (2013). Thus, Rhone stands for the proposition that if a separate\n\nopinion does not concur in the judgment, any language expressing how the law should be\n\napplied in future cases cannot be considered part of the court's holding because that\n\nlanguage is not necessary to the resolution in the case and is thus dicta.\n\n       Rhone is consistent with the federal rule. Under that rule, \"[w ]hen a fragmented\n\nCourt decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five\n\nJustices, 'the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those\n\nMembers who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.\"' Marks v. United\n\nStates, 430 U.S. 188, 193, 97 S. Ct. 990, 51 L. Ed. 2d 260 (1977) (emphasis added)\n\n(quoting Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 169 n.15, 96 S. Ct. 2909, 49 L. Ed. 2d 859\n\n(1976) (plurality opinion)). In Colorado Structures, the plurality extended the\n\navailability of Olympic Steamship fees to cases involving surety bonds. 161 Wn.2d at\n\n582. The plurality reasoned that surety bonds are \"'in the nature'\" of insurance contracts,\n\nthus there was little to distinguish construction performance bonds from other forms of\n\ninsurance. Id. at 598,605 (quoting Nat'! Bank of Wash. v. Equity Inv'rs, 86 Wn.2d 545,\n\n553,546 P.2d 440 (1976)). The present majority concludes that the extension of attorney\n\nfees had majority support in Colorado Structures because of Justice Sanders' separate\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fNo. 92744-8\nMadsen, J., concurring in dissent\n\n\nop1rnon. Majority at 7-8. In his opinion, Justice Sanders stated that although he\n\ndisagreed that it would apply in that case, he agreed that Olympic Steamship applies to\n\nsurety bonds and would reward attorney fees to a prevailing contactor. Colo. Structures,\n\n161 Wn.2d at 638 (Sanders, J., dissenting).\n\n       But Justice Sanders did not concur in the judgment of the plurality; he dissented.\n\nUnder Marks, the \"holding\" of the court is the narrowest position agreed to by at least\n\nfive justices concurring in the judgment. Justice Sanders did not concur in the judgment\n\nin Colorado Structures. Therefore, even though his dissenting opinion contains dicta\n\nregarding attorney fees, there was not a binding holding of this court on that issue.\n\n       I acknowledge that our jurisprudence has been less than clear on how to determine\n\nwhat, if any, legal principles from a fractured opinion are precedential. Compare\n\nMeredith, 178 Wn.2d at 184, with In re Pers. Restraint of Francis, 170 Wn.2d 517, 532\n\nn.7, 242 P.3d 866 (2010) (\"When there is no majority opinion, the holding is the\n\nnarrowest ground upon which a majority agreed.\"). We have explicitly applied Marks\n\nonly when evaluating split opinions from the United States Supreme Court. See, e.g.,\n\nState v. LG Elecs., Inc., 186 Wn.2d 169, 181,375 P.3d 1035 (2016). Without explicitly\n\nadopting Marks, however, we have applied it. This case provides an opportunity for us to\n\nend an era of confusion about what constitutes precedent from our fractured opinions and\n\nmake clear that we follow the federal Marks standard. Accordingly, I would hold that\n\nColorado Structures produced no binding holding as to attorney fees. Not bound by\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fNo. 92744-8\nMadsen, J., concurring in dissent\n\n\nprecedent, we should decline to extend the availability of Olympic Steamship fees to\n\nsureties on a performance bond.\n\n       Olympic Steamship was a departure from the normal rule governing attorney fees,\n\nand we should be slow to extend it. Under the \"American rule,\" litigants pay their own\n\nattorney fees unless a statute or contract provides otherwise. Marx v. Gen. Revenue\n\nCorp., 568 U.S. 371, 133 S. Ct. 1166, 1175, 185 L. Ed. 2d 242 (2013) (quoting Hardt v.\n\nReliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 253, 130 S. Ct. 2149, 176 L. Ed. 2d 998\n\n(2010) (quoting Ruckelshaus v. Sierra Club, 463 U.S. 680, 683, 103 S. Ct. 3274, 77 L.\n\nEd. 2d 938 (1983))). Olympic Steamship fees are an equitable remedy; in that case, we\n\nextended the right of an insured to recoup attorney fees because of the disparity in\n\nbargaining power between an insurance company and its policyholder, which is\n\nsubstantially different from other commercial contracts. 117 Wn.2d at 52. The extension\n\nof fees in Olympic Steamship was a substantial departure from the American rule that\n\ngenerally governs attorney's fees. And without the showing of unequal bargaining power\n\nlike we had in Olympic Steamship, we should not depart further from the American rule.\n\n       There are critical differences between suretyship and insurance that illustrate why\n\nwe should not extend equitable fees to surety bonds. Our decision in Olympic Steamship\n\nwas based on the disparity of bargaining power between insurers and those seeking\n\ncoverage. 117 Wn.2d at 52-53. With casualty insurance, a consumer must generally\n\naccept insurance on a \"take it or leave it\" basis. In the context of construction\n\nperformance bonds, however, the obligee on a performance bond (the owner of a\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\fNo. 92744-8\nMadsen, J., concurring in dissent\n\n\nconstruction project) has the power to dictate the terms of the bonds. Therefore, the\n\ndisparity between the parties in bargaining power and sophistication in the context of\n\nconstruction performance bonds is not similar to that found in the insurance context.\n\nColo. Structures, 161 Wn.2d at 621-22 (Madsen, J., concurring in dissent) ('\"Inequities in\n\nbargaining power are largely absent in the surety context because the obligee, not the\n\nsurety, usually dictates the bond requirements.\"' (quoting Masterclean, Inc. v. Star Ins.\n\nCo., 347 S.C. 405, 412, 556 S.E.2d 371 (2001)); Blackfeet Tribe v. Blaze Constr. Inc.,\n\n108 F. Supp. 2d 1122, 1142 (D.

N Austin Mun.\n\nUtil. Dist. No. 1,908 S.W.2d 415,418 (Tex. 1995) (noting that it is the obligee, not the\n\nsurety, that controls the form of the bond and the terms of the incorporated contract)).\n\n       Further, the public policy rationales that supported an equitable remedy in\n\nOlympic Steamship are absent in the context of performance bonds. In a typical\n\ninsurance claim, the insured depends on a prompt payout for the basic necessities of life.\n\n\n\n                                             5\n\fNo. 92744-8\nMadsen, J., concurring in dissent\n\n\nFor a performance bond, on the other hand, \"an obligee relies on the surety for additional\n\nsecurity to ensure the fulfillment of a commercial contract.\" Colo. Structures, 161 Wn.2d\n\nat 623 (Madsen, J., concurring in dissent). When a surety breaches, there is no different\n\ndilemma for the obligee than that posed by the principal's default on the underlying\n\nconstruction contract. Id. (quoting Cates, 21 Cal. 4th at 55). An obligee also has other\n\navenues of recourse. An insured is limited to seeking help from its insurer. But in a\n\nsurety bond, an obligee has recourse against the principal and the surety. Id. at 624\n\n(Madsen, J., concurring in dissent). Public policy simply does not require the same\n\nequitable remedies to be available for construction performance bonds as those in\n\nindividual insurance claims.\n\n       As Chief Justice Alexander argued in Colorado Structures, we should be slow to\n\nextend the Olympic Steamship exception to the American Rule, particularly in cases\n\nwhere the reasons underlying that opinion are not present. 161 Wn.2d at 610 (Alexander,\n\nC.J., concurring/dissenting). Given the purpose and nature of the relationship in a\n\nsuretyship agreement, it is inappropriate to extend an equitable exception to the American\n\nrule. By mistakenly believing that Colorado Structures created binding precedent on this\n\nissue, the majority fails to evaluate it fully.\n\n       Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\fNo. 92744-8\nM:dsen, J. , con:::urr:ing in dissent\n\n\n\n\n                                        7\n\f",

The parties litigated the issue of whether three construction\n\n        firms had defaulted on a contract, thus triggering coverage under a performance\n\n        bond issued by the surety companies. At issue is whether the existence of a\n\n        statutory fee provision bars equitable remedies available at common law for\n\n        coverage disputes and whether the trial court correctly determined that segregation\n\n        between covered and uncovered fees was impossible. The Court of Appeals\n\n        affirmed the award of Olympic Steamship fees and held that the trial court did not\n\n        abuse its discretion in determining that the fees could not be segregated.

In 2006, King County\n\n        contracted with three construction firms-Vinci Construction Grands Projets,\n\n        Parsons RCI, and Frontier-Kemper JV (collectively VPFK)-to expand its\n\n        wastewater treatment system. This expansion entailed the construction of a new\n\n        treatment plant along with three new conveyance tunnels that would increase the\n\n        treatment system's capacity to manage additional sewage from both Snohomish\n\n\n\n                                                       2\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Pro.Jets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nCounty and King County residents and businesses. Because the project would\n\nimpact public health, the environment, and local economic growth, King County\n\nrequired substantial completion of the project by November 14, 2010.\n\n       VPFK won the bid to construct the second and third sections of the central\n\ntunnel, which together would measure 18 feet in diameter and 31,700 feet in\n\nlength. Further, both sections of the tunnel were to be excavated concurrently.\n\nUnder the terms of the contract, VPFK secured a performance bond from five\n\nsurety companies: Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, Travelers Casualty and\n\nSurety Company of America, Federal Insurance Company, Fidelity and Deposit\n\nCompany of Maryland, and Zurich American Insurance Company (collectively\n\nSureties). IfVPFK failed to perform under the terms of the contract, the\n\nperformance bond obligated the Sureties to step in and \"promptly remedy the\n\ndefault in a manner acceptable to [King County].\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 5542.\n\n       Throughout the project, VPFK encountered a number of difficulties with its\n\nequipment and management. At the time of its bid, VPFK estimated it could dig\n\n57 feet per day on the longest tunnel, yet during the course of construction it\n\naveraged only 28 feet per day. VPFK's tunnel-boring machines broke down\n\nnumerous times, including one nine-month delay during which VPKF attempted\n\n(and failed) to ease the tunnel's atmospheric pressure by removing groundwater\n\nbefore repairing the stalled machine. VPFK submitted numerous change orders\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nand at one point agreed to establish a workshop of experts from various disciplines\n\nto \"'mutually review all aspects of the tunneling operation to develop strategies for\n\nthe remaining construction.'\" Id. at 7046.\n\n       When it became clear that VPFK was not \"prosecuting the Work with\n\nsufficient diligence to achieve Substantial Completion within the Contract Time,\"\n\nKing County declared VPFK to be in default and requested a corrective action plan\n\nthat would ensure completion within the contract's deadline. Id. at 576. VPFK\n\nsubmitted its revised schedule to King County, estimating a completion date\n\nseveral years past the contract's deadline and at a significantly greater cost. As a\n\nresult, King County entered into an interim agreement with VPFK to hire a\n\ndifferent contractor to complete a portion of the work.\n\n       King County notified the Sureties of its plan and requested that the Sureties\n\neither cure VPFK's default themselves or agree to fund the new contractor.\n\nInstead, the Sureties argued that performance was not required under the bond\n\nbecause no breach had occurred. On April 19, 2010, King County filed suit against\n\nVPFK and one of the sureties, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of\n\nAmerica, claiming breach of contract and seeking declaratory relief that VPFK was\n\nin default and that the Sureties were joint and severally liable. The remaining four\n\nsurety companies intervened, and together the Sureties, while denying coverage,\n\nalso adopted all of VPFK's defenses against breach of contract.\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fKing County v. Vinci Cons tr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\n       At trial, the jury was asked to consider whether \"VPFK was in default of its\n\nobligations under the Contract by failing to perform its work so as to ensure\n\nsubstantial completion by the Contract deadline\" and whether \"the Sureties\n\nbreached their obligations under the Bond because the Sureties failed to pay King\n\nCounty's costs and expenses incurred because ofVPFK's default.\" Id. at 9091.\n\nThe jury found in favor of King County and awarded nearly $130 million in\n\ndamages.

The trial court\n\nfurther held that the fees could not be segregated because King County's claim\n\nagainst the Sureties was intertwined and indistinguishable from its claim against\n\nVPFK.\n\n       On appeal, the Sureties argued that Olympic Steamship did not apply\n\nbecause the fee provisions of RCW 39.04.240 are the exclusive fee remedy in\n\npublic works contracts. Further, the Sureties disagreed with the trial court's\n\ndetermination that the fees could not be segregated. The Court of Appeals\n\naffirmed the award of fees, holding both that RCW 39.04.240 was not the\n\nexclusive fee remedy and that the fees could not be segregated. King County v.\n\nVinci Constr.

However, this is a\n\ncondition precedent to recovery under this statutory scheme; it does not represent a\n\n\n\n                                               10\n\fKing County v. Vinci Cons tr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nlimitation on awarding attorney fees in the context of public works contracts and\n\ninsurance coverage. There is no language within either RCW 4.84.250-.280 or\n\nRCW 39.04.240 suggesting that the legislature intended to exclude all other means\n\nof recovering attorney fees. The legislature simply took an existing statutory\n\nremedy and made it available to actions arising out of a public works contract.\n\n       There is nothing in the legislative history indicating that RCW 39.04.240\n\nwas intended to proscribe alternative fee remedies. Testimony for the original bill\n\nstated quite plainly that \"[t]he purpose of the bill is to encourage settlements.\"\n\nH.B. REP. ON ENGROSSED S.B. 6407, at 2, 52d Leg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1992).\n\nBecause \"[p]ublic agencies seem to react to litigation as if their attorneys are free,\"\n\nthe legislature expected an award of fees to result in \"decision[s] to pursue the law\n\nsuit ... on the merits of the case and not on the costs of going to court.\" Id. There\n\nis no indication that the bill was a reaction to a court decision allowing for\n\nequitable remedies, and in the final bill report for RCW 39.04.240, the legislature\n\nrecognized that attorney fees may be awarded as authorized by statute, contract, or\n\nequitable common law grounds. FINAL B. REP. ON ENGROSSED S.B. 6407, at 1, 52d\n\nLeg., Reg. Sess. (Wash. 1992).\n\n       Seven years later, the legislature amended RCW 39.04.240 to remove the\n\nmaximum pleading amount of $250,000. LAWS OF 1999, ch. 107, § 1(1).\n\nTestimony in favor of the bill pointed out that \"[t]hese contracts are very one-\n\n\n\n                                                11\n\fK\"ing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets, et al., No. 92744-8\n\n\nsided, and in cases near the $250,000 limit, the public agency has little incentive to\n\ncompromise or settle now.\" H.B. REP. ON H.B. 1671, at 2, 56th Leg., Reg. Sess.\n\n(Wash. 1999). The legislature noted that the statute \"works very well to save both\n\nsides time and money\" and that removing the maximum pleading amount would\n\n\"force both sides to act reasonably.\" Id. While clearly encouraging resolution of\n\nclaims through settlement, there was no language indicating an intent to foreclose\n\nexisting alternative equitable remedies recognized at common law.\n\n       Finally, the provisions of RCW 4.84.250-.280 are not \"'so inconsistent with\n\nand repugnant to'\" other available remedies as to evidence the legislature's intent\n\nfor exclusivity.

The statutory fee remedy is not inconsistent with and\n\nrepugnant to the fee rule in Olympic Steamship merely because each party receives\n\nan award of fees for different parts of the same case.\n\n       Under the facts of this case, King County opted not to include a fee\n\nprovision in either the construction contract or the performance bond, both of\n\nwhich were drafted by King County. See RCW 4.84.330. As the Sureties suggest,\n\nthis may have been a strategic decision to limit liability for attorney fees in the\n\nevent that King County found itself in breach of the contract. Sureties' Suppl. Br.\n\nat 5. King County did not make an offer of settlement under RCW 39.04.240, but\n\nthat too is not surprising. As mentioned above, there is very little middle ground\n\non which to construct a settlement offer in a pure coverage dispute; King County\n\ninsisted there was coverage under the bond, and the Sureties insisted there was not.\n\nInstead of performing under a reservation of rights, the Sureties compelled King\n\nCounty to assume the burden of legal action to obtain the benefit of the\n\nperformance bond by proving that a breach had occurred. Thus, attorney fees were\n\navailable under Olympic Steamship. 117 Wn.2d at 53.\n\nB.     The fees in this case could not be segregated because the Sureties adopted\n       the contract defenses of VPFK\n\n       The Sureties next argue that the trial court erred when it failed to segregate\n\nthe fees between King County's claim against VPFK and King County's claim\n\n\n                                               15\n\fKing County v.

However, by adopting the entirety of VPFK's defenses\n\nagainst breach, the Sureties made the two claims indistinguishable. The Court of\n\nAppeals held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that\n\nsegregation was impossible. We agree.\n\n       We review the trial court's determination of whether segregation is possible\n\nfor abuse of discretion. Mayer, 156 Wn.2d at 693.

Br. at 19. We find the Sureties' argument unpersuasive against\n\nthe weight of the record before us. Prior to litigation, the Sureties asserted that\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr.

The Sureties further declared as follows: \"VPFK is not in\n\ndefault of its contract obligations and the County has not performed its obligations\n\nthereunder. Accordingly, the County's claim is respectfully denied. All rights and\n\ndefenses are fully reserved.\" Id. at 20-21. At trial, the court found that the\n\nSureties \"adopted all ofVPFK's defenses in this case, including claims for various\n\ndiffering site condition ... claims, which, if proved in their entirety, would defeat\n\nKing County's claim of default.\" CP at 4489. Finally, the Sureties admitted that\n\nthey had ultimately made the decision to deny coverage under the bond. Certified\n\nTr. (Mar. 22, 2013) at 77. Clearly, the Sureties were not debating the amount\n\nowed under the performance bond-rather, the Sureties took the position that\n\nperformance under the bond had not been triggered because no default had\n\noccurred.\n\n       Of course, it is not difficult to understand the litigation strategy at play here.\n\nSuccessful defense of the breach claim against VPFK meant that the Sureties\n\nwould not be called on to perform under the bond. Although the Sureties suggest\n\nthey \"played no meaningful role in the lengthy trial,\" Sureties' Suppl. Br. at 19, the\n\ntrial court's findings in fact suggest that the Sureties vigorously worked to defeat\n\nKing County's claims against VPFK. See CP at 4487. Additionally, the Sureties\n\n\n\n                                               17\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr.

The Sureties joined with VPFK in requesting\n\njury instructions linking liability under the bond to a finding that VPFK was liable\n\nfor King County's damages. And defense counsel in closing argument reasserted\n\nthat the Sureties' panel of expert consultants \"confirmed what VPFK had been\n\nsaying all along, that there was no default.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings (Dec.\n\n6, 2012) at 7022.\n\n       King County could prevail in asserting coverage under the performance\n\nbond only by defeating VPFK's defenses against breach, and the Sureties threw\n\ntheir considerable legal weight behind these defenses. While the Sureties'\n\nlitigation strategy was sensible, it resulted in the claims becoming inseparable. As\n\nthe trial court correctly noted, the issues of breach and coverage under the bond\n\nshared a \"common core of facts.\" CP at 4529; see Fiore v. PPG Indus., Inc., 169\n\nWn.

The jury instructions squarely presented\n\nthe claims against VPFK and the Sureties together. When attorneys for King\n\nCounty prepared to argue the issue of breach, they had to contend not just with\n\ncounterarguments from VPFK but from the Sureties as well. Accordingly, the trial\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in finding that the attorney fees could not be\n\nsegregated.\n\n\n\n                                               18\n\fKing County v.

Madden, 83 Wn.2d at 222.\n\n   1. Statutory Language\n\n      The statutory language here is inconsistent with and repugnant to Olympic\n\nSteamship. The statute and Olympic Steamship define a \"prevailing party\" in\n\nfundamentally different ways. The statute also prohibits parties from contracting\n\naround its requirements. As a result, both cannot be in force simultaneously.\n\n      As discussed above, RCW 39.04.240 requires prevailing parties both to make\n\na settlement offer and to then improve on the offer. To prevail, a plaintiff must recover\n\nthe same as or more than his or her settlement offer. RCW 4.84.260. A defendant may\n\nprevail only when the plaintiff recovers the same as or less than the defendant's\n\nsettlement offer. RCW 4.84.270. Parties may not waive these requirements. RCW\n\n39.04.240(2).\n\n       Olympic Steamship has none of these requirements. Olympic Steamship\n\ndefines a \"prevailing party\" as a party who wins a lawsuit, when that lawsuit is forced\n\nby an insurer's refusal \"to defend or pay the ... claim.\" Olympic S.S., 117 Wn.2d at\n\n52-53 (holding \"that an award of fees is required in any legal action where the insurer\n\ncompels the insured to assume the burden of legal action, to obtain the full benefit of\n\nhis insurance contract, regardless of whether the insurer's duty to defend is at issue\").\n\nColo.

Grands Projets/Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper, .JV, No. 927 44-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\n(plurality opinion), 1 expanded the \"prevailing party\" definition to a party who wins a\n\nlawsuit when \"the surety wrongfully denies coverage.\"\n\n       These inconsistent definitions cannot be in force simultaneously, especially in\n\nlight of the statutory prohibition on waiver of the statutory requirements. To adopt the\n\nmajority's conclusion to the contrary would lead to absurd results. For example, under\n\nthe majority approach, both parties can be \"prevailing parties.\" If a public body prevails\n\non a coverage dispute and recovers a modest award against a surety, Olympic\n\nSteamship would entitle the public entity to attorney fees. But, if the surety made a\n\ntimely pretrial settlement offer that exceeded the recovery by the public entity, RCW\n\n39.04.240 entitles the surety to attorney fees. To resolve this conflict, the court could\n\npotentially apportion the fees between coverage and damages. But RCW 4.84.250\n\nthrough 4.84.280 have no language contemplating such a split. And, in circumstances\n\nlike those presented here, where the trial court finds that the fees cannot be\n\nsegregated, 2 what is the court to do? Regardless of the potential solutions, the\n\nexample demonstrates that the two separate definitions are repugnant to one another\n\nand cannot apply simultaneously.\n\n       The majority claims that distinguishing between coverage disputes and claims\n\ndisputes is critical here. Majority at 12. However, the majority ignores that coverage\n\n\n\n1 We agree with the majority that Colorado Structures should not be overruled. See majority\nat 7-9. In Colorado Structures, all parties involved were private parties. 161 Wn.2d at 581. In\ncontrast, RCW 39.04.240 applies only when a public entity is a party. RCW 39.04.240 (\"The\nprovisions ... shall apply to an action arising out of a public works contract in which the state\nor a municipality, or other public body that contracts for public works, is a party .... \").\n2 See majority at 14.\n\n\n                                              4\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets!Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\ndisputes are not merely abstract questions; instead, they are brought to determine\n\nhow much money an insurance company owes.\n\n      RCW 4.84.250 permits recovery of attorney fees \"in any action for damages.\"\n\nSee RCW 39.04.240 (incorporating RCW 4.84.250's scheme by reference).\n\nTherefore, the question is whether a claim for coverage is part of establishing an\n\naction for damages for purposes of the statute. Absent context, a claim for establishing\n\ncoverage does not obviously seek damages but simply the resolution of a binary\n\nquestion: Does coverage exist or not? Yet, this approach ignores the obvious and\n\ninevitable goal of a coverage claim, which is to recover a dollar amount as a result of\n\ncoverage. Ultimately, a claim for coverage is an action for damages, thereby falling\n\nwithin the statute's scope.\n\n      The practical connection between coverage and damages is especially clear in\n\nthis case: King County sought to prove that VPFK was in default under the contract,\n\nthat coverage by the sureties was thus established, and that the sureties were\n\ntherefore required '\"to pay King County's costs and expenses incurred because of\n\nVPFK's default.\"' Majority at 5 (quoting Clerk's Papers at 9091 ). King County sought\n\ncosts and expenses at trial; coverage was simply a necessary precursor toward that\n\nend. Either party could make settlement offers in advance based on a monetary\n\namount.\n\n      We can also see how the statute would apply to possible settlement offers in\n\nthis case. Ultimately, the jury awarded King County close to $130 million. The fee\n\nrecovery statute would simply require that this total meet or exceed whatever\n\n                                          5\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets/Parsons RC!/\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\nsettlement amount was previously offered. Because there is no evidence that King\n\nCounty made any settlement offer, there was nothing to meet or exceed. Thus, King\n\nCounty is not entitled to recover fees under the statute. This approach acknowledges\n\nthe goals of coverage claims and the intent of the statute.\n\n       Even if we acknowledge that coverage and damages are two different issues,\n\nhere, they have been so \"intertwined\" as to be \"indistinguishable.\" Majority at 5. King\n\nCounty took the position-and prevailed-that coverage and determination of claims\n\nwere so interwoven in this case that King County should recover all its fees, not just\n\nthe fees incurred in establishing coverage. It is not clear why combining a coverage\n\nquestion with a claim for damages results in the entire claim being treated as a\n\ncoverage question. The reason for favoring the case's treatment as a coverage\n\nquestion is especially unclear in light of the statute's express purpose to encourage\n\nsettlement. All one has to do to avoid the statute's requirements is to raise a coverage\n\nissue as part of a claim for damages; then, the public entity is free of any settlement\n\nrequirements. Far from a strict program to require reasonable efforts at settlement in\n\norder to recover fees, the majority turns the statute into an optional and uninviting\n\nalternative.\n\n   2. Principles of Statutory Construction\n\n       Our principles of statutory construction also compel the conclusion that RCW\n\n39.04.240 abrogates Olympic Steamship in the public works context. First, since the\n\nstatute and Olympic Steamship both govern an award of attorney fees and are in\n\nconflict with one another, we should construe the more specific statute as prevailing\n\n\n                                          6\n\fKing County v. Vinci Constr. Grands Projets!Parsons RC//\nFrontier-Kemper, JV, No. 92744-8\n(Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n\nover the more general common law. Second, we may not grant the equitable award\n\nof Olympic Steamship fees when there is a conflicting statutory method for recovery.\n\n       We construe specific statutes as prevailing over general statutes. 0.

It\n\nmatters not that the majority believes that the statute's requirements are inconvenient\n\nin these circumstances.

Testimony before the legislature noted that \"[p]ublic agencies seem to react to\n\nlitigation as if their attorneys are free,\" wasting public funds. H.B. REP. ON ENGROSSED\n\nS.B. 6407, at 2. RCW 39.04.240 would encourage settlement by requiring all parties,\n\nespecially public entities, in all public works contract disputes to make an offer of\n\nsettlement and improve on it at trial. See H.B. REP. ON SUBSTITUTE H.B. 1671, at 2\n\n(testimony that \"[t]hese contracts are very one sided\" and \"the public agency has little\n\nincentive to compromise or settle now\"). This condition of recovery created \"a two-\n\nedged sword that will force both sides to act reasonably.\" Id.\n\n       But the majority, by preserving the common law avenue of recovery, effectively\n\nnegates the legislature's incentive scheme.

Olympic Steamship fees are an equitable remedy; in that case, we\n\nextended the right of an insured to recoup attorney fees because of the disparity in\n\nbargaining power between an insurance company and its policyholder, which is\n\nsubstantially different from other commercial contracts. 117 Wn.2d at 52. The extension\n\nof fees in Olympic Steamship was a substantial departure from the American rule that\n\ngenerally governs attorney's fees. And without the showing of unequal bargaining power\n\nlike we had in Olympic Steamship, we should not depart further from the American rule.\n\n       There are critical differences between suretyship and insurance that illustrate why\n\nwe should not extend equitable fees to surety bonds. Our decision in Olympic Steamship\n\nwas based on the disparity of bargaining power between insurers and those seeking\n\ncoverage. 117 Wn.2d at 52-53. With casualty insurance, a consumer must generally\n\naccept insurance on a \"take it or leave it\" basis.

When a surety breaches, there is no different\n\ndilemma for the obligee than that posed by the principal's default on the underlying\n\nconstruction contract. Id. (quoting Cates, 21 Cal. 4th at 55). An obligee also has other\n\navenues of recourse. An insured is limited to seeking help from its insurer. But in a\n\nsurety bond, an obligee has recourse against the principal and the surety. Id. at 624\n\n(Madsen, J., concurring in dissent). Public policy simply does not require the same\n\nequitable remedies to be available for construction performance bonds as those in\n\nindividual insurance claims.\n\n       As Chief Justice Alexander argued in Colorado Structures, we should be slow to\n\nextend the Olympic Steamship exception to the American Rule, particularly in cases\n\nwhere the reasons underlying that opinion are not present. 161 Wn.2d at 610 (Alexander,\n\nC.J., concurring/dissenting). Given the purpose and nature of the relationship in a\n\nsuretyship agreement, it is inappropriate to extend an equitable exception to the American\n\nrule.
