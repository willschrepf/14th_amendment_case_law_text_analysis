AND\nD.C.T-A.\n\n                                     ----------\n\n          FROM THE 233RD DISTRICT COURT OF TARRANT COUNTY\n\n                                     ----------\n\n                        MEMORANDUM OPINION 1\n\n                                     ----------\n\n\n      Appellants C.A-T. and S.T. (Mother and Father respectively; collectively,\n\nthe parents) appeal from the trial court’s order terminating their parental\n\nrelationship with A.I.T-A. and D.C.T-A. (Daughter and Son respectively;\n\ncollectively, the children) and naming the paternal grandmother (Grandmother)\n\nas sole managing conservator (SMC) and the maternal grandmother (Grandma)\n\nas possessory conservator (PC). In six issues, the parents challenge the legal\n\nand factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the trial court’s best interest\n\n\n      1\n       See Tex. R. App. 47.4.\n\ffinding and the trial court’s findings on the termination grounds of dangerous\n\nenvironment, failure to support, and use of a controlled substance; alternatively\n\nchallenge the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the\n\nappointment of Grandmother as SMC and Grandma as PC; and contend that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by awarding $30,000 in attorney’s fees from the\n\nparents to Grandmother’s trial counsel. Because we hold that the evidence is\n\nlegally and factually sufficient to support termination and that the trial court’s\n\naward of attorney’s fees to Grandmother’s trial counsel and against the parents\n\nwas not an abuse of discretion, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\nBackground Facts\n\n      In April 2009, Grandmother and her husband (Grandfather; collectively\n\nGrandparents) filed suit for conservatorship and child support, and Grandma\n\nintervened for possession and access. According to Grandmother’s affidavit in\n\nsupport of Grandparents’ original petition for joint managing conservatorship,\n\nwhen Mother was pregnant with Daughter, who was born in June 2006, Father\n\nheld a gun to Mother’s stomach and threatened to kill her. In late March 2009,\n\nGrandmother further alleged, he held a hammer and threatened to kill Mother in\n\nthe children’s presence.    In early April 2009, before Grandparents filed their\n\npetition, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (TDFPS) had\n\nremoved the children from their parents because of the parents’ domestic\n\nviolence issues and crystal methamphetamine use and placed the children with\n\nGrandparents.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      In April 2009, Grandparents and Grandma were named temporary joint\n\nmanaging conservators (JMCs), with Grandparents given the right to designate\n\nthe children’s primary residence.   Grandma was awarded possession of the\n\nchildren according to the standard possession order, and the parents were\n\nawarded separate, limited weekly visitation supervised by their respective\n\nmothers. The parents were each ordered to pay Grandparents $50 monthly in\n\nchild support.\n\n      In September 2011, Grandma moved for drug screening of all adult parties\n\ninvolved—Grandparents, Grandma, and the parents—and alleged that Father\n\nhad moved in with Grandparents and was still “abusing illegal substances along\n\nwith certain members of his family.” Also in September 2011, Grandma filed a\n\n“motion to clarify agreed temporary orders,” in which she requested that the\n\nparents be ordered to immediately undergo hair follicle testing and to submit to\n\nfuture random hair follicle testing. In November 2011, pursuant to Grandparents’\n\nand Grandma’s agreement, the trial court ordered drug testing of Grandparents.\n\nBoth those drug tests came back positive for hydrocodone, for which\n\nGrandmother, but not Grandfather, had a prescription. The trial court later found\n\nthat Grandfather had no biological relationship with the children. Grandfather\n\nnonsuited his claims.\n\n      On May 24, 2012, Grandmother filed an original petition to terminate the\n\nparent-child relationship between the children and their parents. Grandmother\n\nsought to be continued as the children’s JMC with the exclusive right to\n\n\n                                       3\n\fdetermine their primary residence and also pled for attorney’s fees, expenses,\n\nand costs from Grandma and the parents. On June 13, 2012, Mother filed her\n\npro se answer opposing the petition from jail. Grandma filed a general denial\n\nand a request that Grandmother pay reasonable attorney’s fees, expenses, and\n\ncosts. Grandma also filed a counterpetition to terminate, seeking that she and\n\nGrandmother be continued as JMCs but that she, not Grandmother, have the\n\nexclusive right to designate the primary residence of the children.          Grandma\n\nagain pled for Grandmother to pay reasonable attorney’s fees, expenses, and\n\ncosts.     On March 6, 2013, Grandma filed her second amended petition in\n\nintervention, seeking to be named a JMC along with Grandparents and to have\n\npossession or access of the children under an expanded standard possession\n\norder.      She also requested that the parents be appointed “possessory\n\nconservators with supervised visitation only if deemed in the child[ren]’s best\n\ninterest for their safety and welfare or with no visitation at the present time if\n\ndeemed appropriate considering the current circumstances.”               This petition\n\ncontains no request for attorney’s fees.\n\n         After the March 18, 2013 trial, the trial court issued a letter announcing the\n\ntrial court’s rendition terminating the parent-child relationships between the\n\nchildren and the parents, appointing Grandmother as SMC, appointing Grandma\n\nas PC with the same possession schedule that she had been enjoying since\n\nNovember 11, 2011 (six hours on every first, third, and fifth weekends), and\n\nadmonishing Grandma that “permitting the association of the children with\n\n\n                                            4\n\f[Father] and/or [Mother] will be considered an objective act of bad faith and\n\nconduct that is contrary to the best interest of the children.”\n\n      The “Final Order Granting Termination of Parental Rights and Final Order\n\non Suit Affecting the Parent Child Relationship” contains those rulings from the\n\nrendition. Additionally in the decree, the trial court found that the parents\n\n      knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the children to remain in\n      conditions or surroundings that endanger[ed] the physical or\n      emotional well-being of the children. In addition they have failed to\n      support the children in accordance with his or her ability during a\n      period of one year ending within six months of the date of the filing\n      of the petition. Further, the parents have used a controlled\n      substance (as defined by chapter 481 of the Texas Health and\n      Safety Code) in a manner that endangered the health or safety of\n      the children and failed to complete a court-ordered substance abuse\n      treatment program[.]\n\n      The trial court also found that termination of the parent-child relationships\n\nbetween the parents and children was in the children’s best interest. Finally, the\n\ntrial court additionally found that\n\n\n      •      Grandmother’s attorney “incurred attorney’s fees and costs . . . in the\n             total amount of $30,000.00”;\n\n      •      the attorney’s “fees are a reasonable and customary fee for an\n             attorney” with Grandmother’s attorney’s “experience practicing in\n             Tarrant County, Texas”;\n\n      •      Grandmother’s attorney’s “services were for the benefit of the\n             children . . . and were reasonable and necessary to protect the\n             emotional and physical welfare of the children”; and\n\n      •      Grandmother’s attorney “is entitled to recover from [Father and\n             Mother] jointly and severally $30,000.00 over and against the\n             Respondents herein, the amount shall include interest from March\n             21, 2013, for such fees, costs and expenses.”\n\n\n                                          5\n\fEndangerment Evidence\n\n      In their first issue, the parents contend that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court’s finding that they knowingly placed\n\nor knowingly allowed the children to remain in conditions or surroundings that\n\nendangered their physical or emotional well-being. 2 As we have explained in\n\nprevious cases,\n\n             Endangerment means to expose to loss or injury, to\n      jeopardize. The trial court may order termination of the parent-child\n      relationship if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the\n      parent has knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the child to\n      remain in conditions or surroundings that endanger the physical or\n      emotional well-being of the child. Under subsection (D), it is\n      necessary to examine evidence related to the environment of the\n      child to determine if the environment was the source of\n      endangerment to the child’s physical or emotional well-being.\n      Conduct of a parent in the home can create an environment that\n      endangers the physical and emotional well-being of a child. 3\n\nSpecifically, a parent’s abusive or violent conduct may produce an endangering\n\nenvironment. 4 Likewise, illegal drug use and related criminal activity will also\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(1)(D) (West Supp. 2013).\n      3\n       In re J.W., No. 02-08-00211-CV, 2009 WL 806865, at *4 (Tex. App.—Fort\nWorth Mar. 26, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.)

(mem. op.).\n      4\n     I.C.W., 2013 WL 173746, at *3; In re J.T.G., 121 S.W.3d 117, 125 (Tex.\nApp.—Fort Worth 2003, no pet.).\n\n\n                                          6\n\fsupport a finding that the children’s surroundings endanger their physical or\n\nemotional well-being. 5 Finally,\n\n      [a]n environment which routinely subjects a child to the probability\n      that she will be left alone because her parents are once again jailed,\n      whether because of the continued violation of probationary\n      conditions or because of a new offense growing out of a continued\n      use of illegal drugs, or because the parents are once again\n      committed to a rehabilitation program, endangers both the physical\n      and emotional well-being of a child. 6\n\n      Grandparents, Grandma, the parents, and Grandmother’s trial counsel\n\ntestified at the bench trial. Additionally, Grandmother’s trial counsel read the\n\nparents’ deemed admissions into the record, 7 and Mother’s written answers to\n\nthe requests for admission and interrogatories were admitted with no objection. 8\n\n      Grandmother testified that she originally filed the conservatorship case in\n\nApril 2009 because\n\n      CPS came to the house to do some drug testing on [the parents],\n      and she admitted and he tested positive. And so when [the CPS\n\n      5\n       I.C.W., 2013 WL 173746, at *3; J.T.G., 121 S.W.3d at 125.\n      6\n       I.C.W., 2013 WL 173746, at *3.\n      7\n       See Tex. R. Civ. P. 198.2(c) (providing if response is untimely served,\nrequest is considered admitted without court order), 198.3 (providing “[a] matter\nadmitted under this rule is conclusively established as to the party making the\nadmission” absent exceptions not present here); Marshall v. Vise, 767 S.W.2d\n699, 700 (Tex. 1989) (holding unanswered requests for admissions are\nautomatically deemed admitted unless court on motion permits withdrawal or\namendment; once admitted, admission is judicial admission, whether deemed or\notherwise).\n      8\n     See Marshall, 767 S.W.2d at 700 (holding party waives right to rely on\ndeemed admissions by failing to object to introduction of contrary evidence).\n\n\n                                        7\n\f      investigator] was leaving, she said that—you know, I asked her,\n      [“]So what do we do now since they flunked their[—?”] And she\n      said, [“]Well, you have to go to court to get the children, to have—\n      you know, so they won’t go to foster care or somewhere else.[”]\n\n      Grandmother also testified that the couple’s domestic violence in their\n\nhome, about which she learned from CPS, likewise precipitated her filing suit.\n\nGrandmother stated at trial that she believed that the “children were in physically\n\nand emotionally harmful environments” when in the possession of Father and\n\nMother.\n\n      Grandmother testified that she decided to file the May 2012 termination\n\npetition quickly “after that final [conservatorship] trial” when “[Mother and Father]\n\nflunked that drug test and they admitted it.” The “final” trial on conservatorship,\n\naccording to Grandma, took place in November 2011. Grandmother testified that\n\nshe wanted Father’s parental rights terminated, that that decision was hard for\n\nher, and that she loved her son but “just wish[ed] he’d ma[d]e better choices.”\n\n      Mother’s and Father’s deemed admissions state that they both used illegal\n\ndrugs, abused alcohol, and were imprisoned during the twenty-four months\n\npreceding their answers; Grandmother’s trial counsel told the court that the\n\ndiscovery had been received by the parents on September 5, 2012 and was\n\ntherefore due October 4, 2012. In Mother’s written answers to the requests for\n\nadmissions, which were admitted without objection, 9 she denied that she and\n\nFather had abused alcohol within the last twenty-four months. She admitted in\n\n      9\n       See id.\n\n\n                                         8\n\fthose written answers, however, that within the last twenty-four months, she and\n\nFather had used illegal drugs and had been incarcerated. In the answers to her\n\ninterrogatories, also admitted in evidence with no objection, Mother similarly\n\nadmitted to using methamphetamine “on[and] off [in] 2010–2011 occas[]ionally.”\n\n        On May 21, 2012, Mother informed the court that she was in jail and had\n\nbeen since mid-April 2012.\n\n        In her testimony, Mother admitted that she had testified in the earlier\n\nconservatorship trial in late 2011 that she was still using methamphetamine. She\n\nfurther admitted to having been arrested in September 2011 for possession of\n\nmethamphetamine of less than one gram and again in April 2012 for a\n\ncommunity supervision violation related to that offense. Mother testified that she\n\nserved about four and one-half months in jail after her community supervision\n\nviolation. Mother testified that she completed intensive day treatment while she\n\nwas incarcerated and that she completed six months of aftercare treatment after\n\nher release from jail. She admitted that she was currently wearing a drug patch\n\nthat the community supervision office checked every ten days. She denied that\n\nher past drug test “stalls,” in which she was allegedly unable to provide a urine\n\nsample and which were violations of her community supervision conditions, were\n\nalso drug test failures. Mother testified that she had been in drug treatment three\n\nor four times, that she had been sober eleven months, and that she went to\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings twice a\n\nweek.\n\n\n                                        9\n\f      Mother also admitted that she and Father had had a “series of domestic\n\nviolence issues” but insisted that that was in their “past.” She remembered that\n\nthe trial court had instructed her to stay away from Father but admitted that she\n\nhad not done so. She further admitted to having gone to a bar/grill with him\n\nabout three weeks before trial, having argued with him, and having left the bar on\n\nher own. She denied having a physical altercation with him.\n\n      Father admitted at trial that he had a history of domestic violence, that the\n\nchildren were present “[a] couple times” when it occurred, and that that exposure\n\nwas not “good for” them. Father further admitted that he was at a bar with\n\nMother about a month before trial and that they argued. He denied that the\n\nargument was violent. He testified that he had not had alcohol for “a few months”\n\nand denied that either he or Mother drank alcohol at the bar.\n\n      Father also admitted that he went to jail for traffic warrants for a period of\n\nabout eight days on the same day that Mother was arrested for the possession of\n\nmethamphetamine, and he further admitted that it is difficult to “be a father to kids\n\nwhen you’re in and out of jail.” Grandmother said that the parents had never\n\nstopped using drugs during the pendency of the case.\n\n      The trial court therefore heard evidence of domestic violence in the\n\nchildren’s presence, recurrent drug abuse, alcohol abuse, drug relapses, and\n\nincarceration of both parents, at least once during the same period. The trial\n\ncourt further heard that Mother had ignored the trial court’s advice to stay away\n\nfrom Father, that the two had argued publicly in a bar/grill three weeks before\n\n\n                                         10\n\ftrial, and that the argument resulted in Mother leaving the bar/grill alone.\n\nReviewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding and\n\njudgment, 10 we hold that the trial court could have reasonably formed a firm\n\nconviction or belief that the parents knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the\n\nchildren to remain in conditions or surroundings which endangered their physical\n\nand emotional well-being, and we therefore hold the evidence legally sufficient to\n\nsupport the trial court’s endangerment finding. 11 Reviewing all the evidence with\n\nappropriate deference to the factfinder, 12 we hold that the trial court likewise\n\ncould have reasonably formed a firm conviction or belief that Mother and Father\n\nknowingly placed or knowingly allowed the children to remain in conditions or\n\nsurroundings which endangered their physical and emotional well-being, and we\n\ntherefore further hold the evidence factually sufficient to support the trial court’s\n\nendangerment finding. 13 We overrule the parents’ first issue.\n\nBest Interest Evidence\n\n      In the parents’ fourth issue, they contend that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court’s finding that termination of the\n\n\n\n      10\n        See In re J.P.B., 180 S.W.3d 570, 573–74 (Tex. 2005).\n      11\n        See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(1)(D).\n      12\n       See In re H.R.M., 209 S.W.3d 105, 108 (Tex. 2006); In re C.H., 89\nS.W.3d 17, 28 (Tex. 2002).\n      13\n        See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(1)(D).\n\n\n                                         11\n\fparent-child relationship is in the children’s best interest. The above evidence on\n\nendangerment is also relevant to a best interest determination. 14\n\n      In addition to the deemed findings discussed above on the endangerment\n\nissue, the following facts were also deemed admitted against the parents\n\nbecause of their failure to timely answer Grandmother’s requests for\n\nadmissions: 15\n\n•     that termination of the parents’ rights would be in the children’s best\n      interest;\n\n•     that either parent having primary custody of the children would not be in\n      their best interest;\n\n•     that removing the children from Grandmother’s primary possession would\n      emotionally harm them;\n\n•     that remaining with Grandmother would be in the children’s best interest;\n\n•     that Grandmother should continue to be the person determining the\n      children’s primary residence and making their educational and medical\n      decisions;\n\n•     that the children had said that they want to live with Grandmother;\n\n•     that the parents had not had unsupervised visits with the children for three\n      years before the discovery deadline;\n\n•     that the parents had not been to any medical or dental appointments for\n      the children in the last three years before the discovery deadline;\n\n\n      14\n        See C.H., 89 S.W.3d at 28.\n      15\n        While answers constituting admissions of law are not binding on a court,\na request for admission may properly ask a party to apply the law to a set of\nfacts.

The parents cite no authority for their\ncontention that whether termination is in a child’s best interest is legal issue.\n\n\n                                        12\n\f•     that the parents had not attended any parent-teacher conferences or\n      visited the children’s school in the last three calendar years;\n\n•     that Grandmother had financially supported the children with no help from\n      the parents for at least the last twenty-four months preceding the discovery\n      deadline;\n\n•     that the parents had provided no financial support for the children as child\n      support in the last twenty-four months before the discovery deadline;\n\n•     that the parents had not provided medical insurance for the children for the\n      last three years before the discovery deadline; and\n\n•     that the parents had provided no clothing for the children in the twenty-four\n      months preceding the discovery deadline.\n\n      In her written answers to the requests for admissions that were admitted\n\ninto evidence without objection, Mother denied that\n\n•     the children had expressed a desire to live with Grandmother;\n\n•     the children’s best interest would be to remain in Grandmother’s\n      possession;\n\n•     it would emotionally harm the children to be removed from Grandmother’s\n      primary possession;\n\n•     Grandmother should remain the person responsible for determining the\n      children’s primary residence and making their educational and medical\n      decisions;\n\n•     it was not in the children’s best interest to be in the parents’ primary\n      custody;\n\n•     it was in the children’s best interest for the parents’ parental rights to be\n      terminated;\n\n•     Grandmother had provided financial support for the children without the\n      parents’ assistance for at least the last twenty-four months before the\n      discovery deadline;\n\n•     Mother had failed to pay child support for at least the last twenty-four\n      months before the discovery deadline; and\n\n\n                                       13\n\f•     the parents had not provided any clothing for the children within the last\n      twenty-four months or medical insurance for the last three years preceding\n      the discovery deadline.\n\n      Mother also contended in her answers to the requests for admissions that\n\nthe reasons that the parents had not attended any medical or dental\n\nappointments or parent-teacher conferences or visited the school were that\n\nGrandmother did not tell the parents about the appointments and that Mother\n\nbelieved that the court order prohibited the parents from going to the\n\nappointments or the school. We note that no order in the clerk’s record contains\n\nsuch provisions; the orders do consistently require that all visits (excluding\n\ntelephone visits) between the parents and the children be supervised by\n\nGrandparents, Grandma, or some “other competent designated adult.”\n\n      In her answers to the interrogatories, Mother stated that she did “not feel\n\n[that she] need[ed] to be supervised with [her] own children” and that she did not\n\nbelieve her parental “rights should be terminated at all.” She wrote, “I deserve\n\nmy kids[.] They are MY kids. And I am a good mom. I have made mistakes.\n\nBut do not anymore.” Additionally, Mother answered that she should be the\n\nchildren’s JMC with the exclusive right to designate their primary residence\n\n“[b]ecause [she is] their mother.”\n\n      Mother further answered in the interrogatories that only she and Father\n\nshould have possession of and access to the children and that Grandmother\n\nshould not be appointed SMC because Mother “fe[lt Grandmother] ha[d the]\n\nchildren under p[hys]ical [and] mostly emotional harm.” Mother further opined\n\n\n                                       14\n\fthat both children needed counseling “due to their living conditions.”         She\n\nanswered that she did “not know” any information about the children’s\n\nextracurricular activities because Grandmother “d[id] not share any information\n\nwith [her] about [the] children.”      Mother contended in her answers that\n\nGrandmother denied her “any kind of contact to [the] children” and called her\n\n“foul names.”\n\n      Mother further answered that “[w]hoever ha[d] the[ children] should provide\n\n[health insurance] for them.”\n\n      Our review of the record yields no copy of the TDFPS service plan for the\n\nparents in the clerk’s record or exhibits, but we note that it was alluded to in the\n\nclerk’s record.   Mother completed Community Addiction Treatment Services\n\n(CATS) in August 2009, systematic training for effective parenting (STEP) in\n\nAugust 2009, and anger management and chemical dependency group\n\ntreatment in September 2009.        She also attended individual and couples\n\ncounseling with Positive Influences, which she had begun in March 2009, and\n\ncompleted her psychological evaluation. Again, though, Mother admitting using\n\nmethamphetamine in 2010 and 2011 and being arrested for possessing it in\n\nSeptember 2011, all of which followed her completion of or participation in these\n\nservices.\n\n      While in jail during the months of June through August 2012 for her\n\ncommunity supervision violations regarding multiple stalled drug tests, Mother\n\nwas diagnosed with amphetamine dependence and completed the ninety-day\n\n\n                                        15\n\fintensive outpatient portion of the intensive day treatment program offered by the\n\ncommunity supervision department. By February 14, 2013, she had satisfactorily\n\ncompleted both the intensive day treatment program and the six months of\n\naftercare treatment. She testified that she had been sober eleven months and\n\nattended NA and AA twice a week.\n\n      Father was progressing well in CATS as of September 2009, having\n\ncompleted fifteen of twenty-four classes; lacked only one parenting class; and\n\nhad scheduled his psychological evaluation. He too participated in individual and\n\ncouples counseling at Positive Influences. He had also obtained employment\n\nand applied for housing. There is no indication in the record whether Father\n\ncompleted any of those services. Both parents had negative drug tests in the\n\nperiod of June–September 2009.\n\n      Father completed the anger control program of Opportunities Counseling\n\nCenter on January 9, 2013.\n\n      Although each parent had been ordered to pay $50 per month of child\n\nsupport to Grandmother with the first temporary order signed in April 2009, the\n\nparents complied with that order only rarely. The child support record admitted\n\nwith no objection shows that Mother made only eight $50 payments and one $40\n\npayment during the period of almost four years from the date child support was\n\nimposed through the date of the March 2013 trial. Mother admitted that she last\n\nmade a payment on February 23, 2011 and that her family provided a June 8,\n\n2012 payment to “help [her] out” while she was in jail and not working. She\n\n\n                                       16\n\fconceded that more than a year passed between her February 23, 2011 payment\n\nand the May 2012 filing of the petition to terminate. Mother admitted that she\n\nhad had plenty of time from her date of release from jail—August 23, 2012—to\n\nmake child support payments. Mother pointed to her incarceration, lack of job\n\nstability, and fixed income as bases for her failure to pay child support as\n\nordered. She admitted that she had been a Subway employee since December\n\n21, 2012.\n\n      Father admitted to making no child support payment until the Friday before\n\ntrial, when he paid $50, but he testified that he and his father “would help\n\n[Grandmother] out when she needed help with the kids.”\n\n      Mother also testified,\n\n             I love my kids very much, I do, and I’ve made a lot of bad\n      choices, which is very clear to everybody in this courtroom, but I\n      don’t think it’s that clear that I do care and love my children more\n      than anything and I do want what’s best for them, and I’m asking this\n      Court to please not terminate my rights and allow me to keep\n      proving myself to y’all and to the Court to be able to, one day, have\n      a great relationship with my children and maybe possibly have them\n      back.\n\n            And that’s pretty much all I’ve got.\n\n      Father was originally very appreciative of Grandmother’s helping out and\n\ntaking care of the children, but by the trial, he no longer believed that she acted\n\nin the children’s best interest. He explained, “[M]y mother told me if I got my life\n\nstraight and got a job, was sober, clean, and had a job and house and everything\n\nfor the kids, she would not mind handing me my kids back.”\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\f      Father further testified,\n\n             I would just like to express to the Court and everybody here, I\n      am a good father. I have made bad mistakes, but everybody makes\n      mistakes in life. I have matured highly in the past year. I have got a\n      job. . . . I’ve just matured a lot. . . . I’m going to classes, anger\n      management classes, BIP classes, all types of maturing stuff for\n      myself, for the best interest of my kids, because I do want my\n      children back one day and I want to be there to provide for my kids\n      for the rest of their life, and I just . . . think [Grandmother] and even\n      [Grandfather] . . . know me and they know I love my kids very much\n      and they know my kids love me very much. And I’ve done what my\n      mother has actually asked me before to do, which is get a job, be\n      clean, and live right, and I’ve done that . . . .\n\n      That’s all I have.\n\n      Grandmother testified that the children were doing well in her home.\n\nDaughter was making “straight As” in first grade at a neighborhood elementary\n\nschool. Son had been in pre-K three hours each school day, but Grandmother\n\nwithdrew him because of a conflict with her work hours. Grandfather took care of\n\nSon during Grandmother’s work hours. Grandfather generally worked different\n\nhours than Grandmother. Additionally, Grandmother’s daughter also watched\n\nSon when Grandparents were unavailable.           Grandmother admitted that her\n\ndaughter might have had a drug problem years ago but denied a recent problem.\n\n      When asked about her own use of prescribed hydrocodone, Grandmother\n\nexplained that she took the medicine when her Achilles heel was inflamed.\n\nGrandmother testified that she would take hydrocodone “out of necessity” but\n\nwas not addicted to it.     Grandmother admitted that Grandfather also tested\n\npositive for hydrocodone on the court-ordered drug test, that he did not have a\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fprescription for the medicine at the time of the test, and that he had taken her\n\nhydrocodone without a prescription. Grandmother further testified that she had\n\nshared her prescription medicine with Grandfather when he was in pain. She\n\nstated that after Grandfather failed the drug test, they found out that it was not a\n\ngood idea for her to share her prescription medication with him.\n\n      Grandfather admitted that he had used hydrocodone without a prescription\n\nwhile the children were living in his home and that he had nonsuited his claims\n\nafter the drug test came back positive. Grandfather also testified that he loves\n\nthe children and has “contributed [his] share” to financially supporting the\n\nchildren.\n\n      Grandmother testified that she had never “really received any substantial\n\nchild support from” the parents, which had made life even more difficult.\n\nGrandmother stated that she works “[part-time] for a lady—[doing] a lot of things\n\nfor her, [from] bookkeeping, to cleaning, to managing her apartments” and that\n\nGrandfather manages a grocery store. She testified that they are not wealthy.\n\nGrandmother admitted that the litigation had cost a lot and had “substantially\n\naltered” her retirement plans.\n\n      Grandmother initially stated that the children had not visited with the\n\nparents while in her possession but later admitted that Father had visited the\n\nchildren while under her supervision. Grandmother also testified that the children\n\nhad seen their parents while in Grandma’s possession and knew information\n\nabout the court case that Grandma and Mother had told them. Grandmother had\n\n\n                                        19\n\fnot discussed the court case or trial with the children and believed that the\n\nknowledge caused them undue stress. Grandmother testified that Daughter had\n\nbeen very emotional and that Son had stated that he did not want to have to\n\nleave his home. She testified that the children were scared of leaving their home\n\nbecause they were “used to” Grandparents.\n\n      Grandmother testified that she should have the exclusive right to make\n\nmedical decisions and education decisions because she primarily had\n\npossession of the children. Grandmother expressed concern that even if the\n\nparents’ rights were terminated, Grandma would still allow them to visit the\n\nchildren during her periods of possession, and Grandmother did not believe\n\nthose visits would be in the children’s best interest.\n\n      Grandmother further testified that she had lived at her current home for six\n\nyears and had no plans to move.\n\n      Grandmother also testified that the children recognized Grandfather and\n\nher as their parents and called them Pawpaw and Mom respectively, even\n\nthough she had told them that she is their grandmother. Grandmother testified\n\nthat she loves the children “like they were [her] own,” that       they will never\n\n“want . . . for anything,” that she and Grandfather “just want the best for them,”\n\nand that she believes termination of the parents’ parental rights is best for the\n\nchildren.\n\n      Grandmother admitted that she had told Father “when [he] was staying\n\nwith [her] that if [he] kept [his] nose clean and stayed sober, got a job and lived\n\n\n                                         20\n\fright, that [she] would give [him his] kids back.” Grandmother testified that she\n\nhad told both parents “[t]hat if they got their—got off of the drugs and did the right\n\nthing, that they could have their children back,” but she stated that by the time of\n\ntrial, they had still not done so.\n\n      Grandmother also admitted that she and Grandma do not get along.\n\nNevertheless, Grandmother testified that she believes that it is in the children’s\n\nbest interest to have a relationship with Grandma.\n\n      Grandma testified that some of the pick-ups and drop-offs of the children\n\nhad not gone smoothly because Grandmother was argumentative, resistant, or\n\nabrasive, and Grandma felt threatened. Grandma also stated that\n\n             [t]he children have expressed that they can only say certain\n      things to their grandmother because she gets mad at them and she\n      puts them in time-out when she gets mad at them. So they—they\n      feel they can only share certain things with her.\n\n      Grandma also testified that the children had told her many times that they\n\nwanted to “go home,” meaning to her house or to their parents’ home, not\n\nGrandmother’s. Grandma further testified that she did not think that completely\n\nexcluding the parents from the children’s lives would be in their best interest\n\nbecause it would traumatize them not to ever be able to\n\n      see their parents because, yes, they do—they do love their parents\n      very much, and their parents love them very much, and given the\n      new situation, the new stake in life right now and all the\n      accomplishments, it is a wonderful, positive experience.\n\n      They relate well to their parents and, most certainly, their parents\n      have their best interest at heart.\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      On cross-examination, Grandma confirmed her statement that the parents\n\nhad the children’s best interest in their heart but stated that she did not so believe\n\nwhen the parents were doing methamphetamine in front of the children or when\n\ndomestic violence between them occurred in front of the children.           Grandma\n\ntestified that absent a court order prohibiting the parents from being around the\n\nchildren, she would allow such visits as long as the parents were not using drugs.\n\n      The trial court heard conflicting evidence about where the children wanted\n\nto live but heard no evidence about where either parent was living. On the other\n\nhand, Grandmother had been in the same home for six years and had no plan to\n\nmove; the children had therefore been in the same home with her for almost four\n\nyears and could look forward to the same stable home in the future. The children\n\nare obviously bonded with all the adult parties, but the evidence indicates that\n\nthey called Grandmother “Mom” of their own volition. There was no evidence\n\nabout any special needs, other than Mother’s contention that the children needed\n\ncounseling.\n\n      The parents’ fairly recent drug use and confinement in jail after TDFPS had\n\nalready removed their children, as well as Mother’s relapses even after three or\n\nfour stints in rehab, provide some indication of the emotional and physical danger\n\nto the children in their parents’ care, as does the parents’ failure to take even a\n\ntoken responsibility for supporting the children or to take any independent\n\ninterest in their lives during the long removal. While the evidence concerning\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fGrandfather’s use of Grandmother’s hydrocodone shows a lack of judgment,\n\nthere was no evidence that Grandparents had any addiction issues.\n\n      The parents’ own words indicate that they were not ready for the children\n\nto be returned to them at the end of trial, and there was no evidence about the\n\nparents’ plans for the children. Grandmother, on the other hand, discussed the\n\nchildren’s schooling, Son’s care providers, how she and Grandfather provide for\n\nthe children financially, and her belief that Grandma and the children should\n\nmaintain contact, even though Grandmother and Grandma do not get along,\n\nbecause that contact benefits the children.\n\n      Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding and\n\njudgment and considering the nonexclusive Holley factors, we hold that the trial\n\ncourt could have reasonably formed a firm conviction or belief that termination of\n\nthe parental relationship between the parents and the children was in the\n\nchildren’s best interest, and we therefore hold the evidence legally sufficient to\n\nsupport the trial court’s best interest finding. 16   Similarly, reviewing all the\n\nevidence with appropriate deference to the factfinder, we hold that the trial court\n\ncould have reasonably formed a firm conviction or belief that termination of the\n\nparental relationship between the parents and the children is in the children’s\n\n\n\n\n      16\n       See Tex. Fam. Code Ann. § 161.001(2) (West Supp. 2013); J.P.B., 180\nS.W.3d at 573–74; C.H., 89 S.W.3d at 27; Holley v.

Much of the litigation below was between\n      [Grandmother] and [Grandma] over custodial violations allegedly\n      committed by [Grandmother] and efforts by [Grandma] to determine\n      drug testing. Nothing was said regarding the time preparing for the\n      litigation between [Grandmother and Grandma],\n\nand concluding that “[i]t was an abuse of discretion to award all of the fees\n\nagainst [the parents].” The parents, however, failed to preserve their segregation\n\nargument in the trial court. 22    We therefore confine our analysis to their\n\nsufficiency complaint. 23\n\n      Section 106.002 of the family code authorizes the trial court to award\n\n“reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses” in suits affecting the parent-child\n\nrelationship (SAPCRs), including termination suits. 24 The award of attorney’s\n\nfees in a SAPCR is within the sound discretion of the trial court. 25 Evidence must\n\nsupport the award. 26 However,\n\n      [s]pecificity . . . is not required. Instead, to support a request for\n      reasonable attorney’s fees, testimony should be given regarding the\n\n      22\n       See Green Int’l, Inc. v.

This case has been ongoing for a period of three\n      years now. In that time, we have billed approximately—or not\n      approximately—in the amount of $33,742.69. This case has\n      become obscene. It has become a waste to the people who have\n      actually cared for and taken care of these children. I am asking that\n      that dollar amount, Your Honor, be assessed against [the parents],\n      jointly and severally liable, and that’s what I’m requesting. I bill at\n      the rate of $225.00 per hour, which is a very customary rate for a\n      lawyer with my accomplishments in this field.\n\n      Grandma’s trial counsel briefly cross-examined Grandmother’s trial\n\ncounsel, asking only whether he believed that the fees were “both reasonable\n\nand necessary” and eliciting an affirmative response. Neither parent chose to\n\ncross-examine Grandmother’s trial counsel.\n\n      The trial court also admitted without objection Grandmother’s trial\n\ncounsel’s summary of attorney’s fees earned from April 1, 2009 through March\n\n18, 2013, which showed that he billed at a rate of $200 per hour, billed 149.1\n\nhours, and earned $29,820; that an associate also billed at a rate of $200, billed\n\n1.5 hours, and earned $300; that the paralegals who worked on the case billed\n\n$125 per hour, billed 17.5 hours, and earned $2,187.50; and that the total fees\n\n      27\n       Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                        26\n\fwere $32,307.50. Out-of-pocket costs were listed at $1,435.19, and total fees\n\nand costs were $33,742.69.\n\n      The trial court also took judicial notice of the court’s file, which revealed\n\nthat Grandmother’s trial counsel propounded discovery, filed and responded to\n\nseveral pleadings, and made several court appearances. The trial court also\n\nspecifically found that\n\n•     Grandmother’s trial counsel “incurred attorney’s fees and costs . . . in the\n      total amount of $30,000.00”;\n\n•     the attorney’s “fees are a reasonable and customary fee for an attorney”\n      with Grandmother’s trial counsel’s “experience practicing in Tarrant\n      County, Texas”;\n\n•     Grandmother’s trial counsel’s “services were for the benefit of the\n      children . . . and were reasonable and necessary to protect the emotional\n      and physical welfare of the children”; and\n\n•     Grandmother’s attorney “is entitled to recover from [Father and Mother]\n      jointly and severally $30,000.00 over and against the Respondents herein,\n      the amount shall include interest from March 21, 2013, for such fees, costs\n      and expenses.”\n\nThe parents did not challenge the finding that the services were for the children’s\n\nbenefit and were reasonable and necessary to protect their welfare. Because we\n\nhold that there is some evidence to support this finding, it is binding. 28\n\n      Thus, the record provides evidence of the complexity of the case and\n\nevidence of Grandmother’s trial counsel’s preparation, and the trial court’s\n\n\n      28\n        See McGalliard v.

App. 47.4.\n\ffinding and the trial court’s findings on the termination grounds of dangerous\n\nenvironment, failure to support, and use of a controlled substance; alternatively\n\nchallenge the legal and factual sufficiency of the evidence supporting the\n\nappointment of Grandmother as SMC and Grandma as PC; and contend that the\n\ntrial court abused its discretion by awarding $30,000 in attorney’s fees from the\n\nparents to Grandmother’s trial counsel. Because we hold that the evidence is\n\nlegally and factually sufficient to support termination and that the trial court’s\n\naward of attorney’s fees to Grandmother’s trial counsel and against the parents\n\nwas not an abuse of discretion, we affirm the trial court’s judgment.\n\nBackground Facts\n\n      In April 2009, Grandmother and her husband (Grandfather; collectively\n\nGrandparents) filed suit for conservatorship and child support, and Grandma\n\nintervened for possession and access. According to Grandmother’s affidavit in\n\nsupport of Grandparents’ original petition for joint managing conservatorship,\n\nwhen Mother was pregnant with Daughter, who was born in June 2006, Father\n\nheld a gun to Mother’s stomach and threatened to kill her. In late March 2009,\n\nGrandmother further alleged, he held a hammer and threatened to kill Mother in\n\nthe children’s presence.    In early April 2009, before Grandparents filed their\n\npetition, the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services (TDFPS) had\n\nremoved the children from their parents because of the parents’ domestic\n\nviolence issues and crystal methamphetamine use and placed the children with\n\nGrandparents.\n\n\n                                         2\n\f      In April 2009, Grandparents and Grandma were named temporary joint\n\nmanaging conservators (JMCs), with Grandparents given the right to designate\n\nthe children’s primary residence.   Grandma was awarded possession of the\n\nchildren according to the standard possession order, and the parents were\n\nawarded separate, limited weekly visitation supervised by their respective\n\nmothers. The parents were each ordered to pay Grandparents $50 monthly in\n\nchild support.\n\n      In September 2011, Grandma moved for drug screening of all adult parties\n\ninvolved—Grandparents, Grandma, and the parents—and alleged that Father\n\nhad moved in with Grandparents and was still “abusing illegal substances along\n\nwith certain members of his family.” Also in September 2011, Grandma filed a\n\n“motion to clarify agreed temporary orders,” in which she requested that the\n\nparents be ordered to immediately undergo hair follicle testing and to submit to\n\nfuture random hair follicle testing. In November 2011, pursuant to Grandparents’\n\nand Grandma’s agreement, the trial court ordered drug testing of Grandparents.\n\nBoth those drug tests came back positive for hydrocodone, for which\n\nGrandmother, but not Grandfather, had a prescription. The trial court later found\n\nthat Grandfather had no biological relationship with the children. Grandfather\n\nnonsuited his claims.\n\n      On May 24, 2012, Grandmother filed an original petition to terminate the\n\nparent-child relationship between the children and their parents. Grandmother\n\nsought to be continued as the children’s JMC with the exclusive right to\n\n\n                                       3\n\fdetermine their primary residence and also pled for attorney’s fees, expenses,\n\nand costs from Grandma and the parents. On June 13, 2012, Mother filed her\n\npro se answer opposing the petition from jail. Grandma filed a general denial\n\nand a request that Grandmother pay reasonable attorney’s fees, expenses, and\n\ncosts. Grandma also filed a counterpetition to terminate, seeking that she and\n\nGrandmother be continued as JMCs but that she, not Grandmother, have the\n\nexclusive right to designate the primary residence of the children.          Grandma\n\nagain pled for Grandmother to pay reasonable attorney’s fees, expenses, and\n\ncosts.     On March 6, 2013, Grandma filed her second amended petition in\n\nintervention, seeking to be named a JMC along with Grandparents and to have\n\npossession or access of the children under an expanded standard possession\n\norder.      She also requested that the parents be appointed “possessory\n\nconservators with supervised visitation only if deemed in the child[ren]’s best\n\ninterest for their safety and welfare or with no visitation at the present time if\n\ndeemed appropriate considering the current circumstances.”               This petition\n\ncontains no request for attorney’s fees.\n\n         After the March 18, 2013 trial, the trial court issued a letter announcing the\n\ntrial court’s rendition terminating the parent-child relationships between the\n\nchildren and the parents, appointing Grandmother as SMC, appointing Grandma\n\nas PC with the same possession schedule that she had been enjoying since\n\nNovember 11, 2011 (six hours on every first, third, and fifth weekends), and\n\nadmonishing Grandma that “permitting the association of the children with\n\n\n                                            4\n\f[Father] and/or [Mother] will be considered an objective act of bad faith and\n\nconduct that is contrary to the best interest of the children.”\n\n      The “Final Order Granting Termination of Parental Rights and Final Order\n\non Suit Affecting the Parent Child Relationship” contains those rulings from the\n\nrendition. Additionally in the decree, the trial court found that the parents\n\n      knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the children to remain in\n      conditions or surroundings that endanger[ed] the physical or\n      emotional well-being of the children. In addition they have failed to\n      support the children in accordance with his or her ability during a\n      period of one year ending within six months of the date of the filing\n      of the petition. Further, the parents have used a controlled\n      substance (as defined by chapter 481 of the Texas Health and\n      Safety Code) in a manner that endangered the health or safety of\n      the children and failed to complete a court-ordered substance abuse\n      treatment program[.]\n\n      The trial court also found that termination of the parent-child relationships\n\nbetween the parents and children was in the children’s best interest. Finally, the\n\ntrial court additionally found that\n\n\n      •      Grandmother’s attorney “incurred attorney’s fees and costs . . . in the\n             total amount of $30,000.00”;\n\n      •      the attorney’s “fees are a reasonable and customary fee for an\n             attorney” with Grandmother’s attorney’s “experience practicing in\n             Tarrant County, Texas”;\n\n      •      Grandmother’s attorney’s “services were for the benefit of the\n             children . . . and were reasonable and necessary to protect the\n             emotional and physical welfare of the children”; and\n\n      •      Grandmother’s attorney “is entitled to recover from [Father and\n             Mother] jointly and severally $30,000.00 over and against the\n             Respondents herein, the amount shall include interest from March\n             21, 2013, for such fees, costs and expenses.”\n\n\n                                          5\n\fEndangerment Evidence\n\n      In their first issue, the parents contend that the evidence is legally and\n\nfactually insufficient to support the trial court’s finding that they knowingly placed\n\nor knowingly allowed the children to remain in conditions or surroundings that\n\nendangered their physical or emotional well-being. 2 As we have explained in\n\nprevious cases,\n\n             Endangerment means to expose to loss or injury, to\n      jeopardize. The trial court may order termination of the parent-child\n      relationship if it finds by clear and convincing evidence that the\n      parent has knowingly placed or knowingly allowed the child to\n      remain in conditions or surroundings that endanger the physical or\n      emotional well-being of the child. Under subsection (D), it is\n      necessary to examine evidence related to the environment of the\n      child to determine if the environment was the source of\n      endangerment to the child’s physical or emotional well-being.\n      Conduct of a parent in the home can create an environment that\n      endangers the physical and emotional well-being of a child. 3\n\nSpecifically, a parent’s abusive or violent conduct may produce an endangering\n\nenvironment. 4 Likewise, illegal drug use and related criminal activity will also\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       See Tex.

Grandmother testified that\n\nshe wanted Father’s parental rights terminated, that that decision was hard for\n\nher, and that she loved her son but “just wish[ed] he’d ma[d]e better choices.”\n\n      Mother’s and Father’s deemed admissions state that they both used illegal\n\ndrugs, abused alcohol, and were imprisoned during the twenty-four months\n\npreceding their answers; Grandmother’s trial counsel told the court that the\n\ndiscovery had been received by the parents on September 5, 2012 and was\n\ntherefore due October 4, 2012. In Mother’s written answers to the requests for\n\nadmissions, which were admitted without objection, 9 she denied that she and\n\nFather had abused alcohol within the last twenty-four months. She admitted in\n\n      9\n       See id.\n\n\n                                         8\n\fthose written answers, however, that within the last twenty-four months, she and\n\nFather had used illegal drugs and had been incarcerated. In the answers to her\n\ninterrogatories, also admitted in evidence with no objection, Mother similarly\n\nadmitted to using methamphetamine “on[and] off [in] 2010–2011 occas[]ionally.”\n\n        On May 21, 2012, Mother informed the court that she was in jail and had\n\nbeen since mid-April 2012.\n\n        In her testimony, Mother admitted that she had testified in the earlier\n\nconservatorship trial in late 2011 that she was still using methamphetamine. She\n\nfurther admitted to having been arrested in September 2011 for possession of\n\nmethamphetamine of less than one gram and again in April 2012 for a\n\ncommunity supervision violation related to that offense. Mother testified that she\n\nserved about four and one-half months in jail after her community supervision\n\nviolation. Mother testified that she completed intensive day treatment while she\n\nwas incarcerated and that she completed six months of aftercare treatment after\n\nher release from jail. She admitted that she was currently wearing a drug patch\n\nthat the community supervision office checked every ten days. She denied that\n\nher past drug test “stalls,” in which she was allegedly unable to provide a urine\n\nsample and which were violations of her community supervision conditions, were\n\nalso drug test failures. Mother testified that she had been in drug treatment three\n\nor four times, that she had been sober eleven months, and that she went to\n\nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings twice a\n\nweek.\n\n\n                                        9\n\f      Mother also admitted that she and Father had had a “series of domestic\n\nviolence issues” but insisted that that was in their “past.” She remembered that\n\nthe trial court had instructed her to stay away from Father but admitted that she\n\nhad not done so. She further admitted to having gone to a bar/grill with him\n\nabout three weeks before trial, having argued with him, and having left the bar on\n\nher own. She denied having a physical altercation with him.\n\n      Father admitted at trial that he had a history of domestic violence, that the\n\nchildren were present “[a] couple times” when it occurred, and that that exposure\n\nwas not “good for” them. Father further admitted that he was at a bar with\n\nMother about a month before trial and that they argued. He denied that the\n\nargument was violent. He testified that he had not had alcohol for “a few months”\n\nand denied that either he or Mother drank alcohol at the bar.\n\n      Father also admitted that he went to jail for traffic warrants for a period of\n\nabout eight days on the same day that Mother was arrested for the possession of\n\nmethamphetamine, and he further admitted that it is difficult to “be a father to kids\n\nwhen you’re in and out of jail.” Grandmother said that the parents had never\n\nstopped using drugs during the pendency of the case.\n\n      The trial court therefore heard evidence of domestic violence in the\n\nchildren’s presence, recurrent drug abuse, alcohol abuse, drug relapses, and\n\nincarceration of both parents, at least once during the same period.

We note that no order in the clerk’s record contains\n\nsuch provisions; the orders do consistently require that all visits (excluding\n\ntelephone visits) between the parents and the children be supervised by\n\nGrandparents, Grandma, or some “other competent designated adult.”\n\n      In her answers to the interrogatories, Mother stated that she did “not feel\n\n[that she] need[ed] to be supervised with [her] own children” and that she did not\n\nbelieve her parental “rights should be terminated at all.” She wrote, “I deserve\n\nmy kids[.] They are MY kids. And I am a good mom. I have made mistakes.\n\nBut do not anymore.” Additionally, Mother answered that she should be the\n\nchildren’s JMC with the exclusive right to designate their primary residence\n\n“[b]ecause [she is] their mother.”\n\n      Mother further answered in the interrogatories that only she and Father\n\nshould have possession of and access to the children and that Grandmother\n\nshould not be appointed SMC because Mother “fe[lt Grandmother] ha[d the]\n\nchildren under p[hys]ical [and] mostly emotional harm.” Mother further opined\n\n\n                                       14\n\fthat both children needed counseling “due to their living conditions.”         She\n\nanswered that she did “not know” any information about the children’s\n\nextracurricular activities because Grandmother “d[id] not share any information\n\nwith [her] about [the] children.”      Mother contended in her answers that\n\nGrandmother denied her “any kind of contact to [the] children” and called her\n\n“foul names.”\n\n      Mother further answered that “[w]hoever ha[d] the[ children] should provide\n\n[health insurance] for them.”\n\n      Our review of the record yields no copy of the TDFPS service plan for the\n\nparents in the clerk’s record or exhibits, but we note that it was alluded to in the\n\nclerk’s record.   Mother completed Community Addiction Treatment Services\n\n(CATS) in August 2009, systematic training for effective parenting (STEP) in\n\nAugust 2009, and anger management and chemical dependency group\n\ntreatment in September 2009.        She also attended individual and couples\n\ncounseling with Positive Influences, which she had begun in March 2009, and\n\ncompleted her psychological evaluation. Again, though, Mother admitting using\n\nmethamphetamine in 2010 and 2011 and being arrested for possessing it in\n\nSeptember 2011, all of which followed her completion of or participation in these\n\nservices.\n\n      While in jail during the months of June through August 2012 for her\n\ncommunity supervision violations regarding multiple stalled drug tests, Mother\n\nwas diagnosed with amphetamine dependence and completed the ninety-day\n\n\n                                        15\n\fintensive outpatient portion of the intensive day treatment program offered by the\n\ncommunity supervision department. By February 14, 2013, she had satisfactorily\n\ncompleted both the intensive day treatment program and the six months of\n\naftercare treatment. She testified that she had been sober eleven months and\n\nattended NA and AA twice a week.\n\n      Father was progressing well in CATS as of September 2009, having\n\ncompleted fifteen of twenty-four classes; lacked only one parenting class; and\n\nhad scheduled his psychological evaluation. He too participated in individual and\n\ncouples counseling at Positive Influences. He had also obtained employment\n\nand applied for housing. There is no indication in the record whether Father\n\ncompleted any of those services. Both parents had negative drug tests in the\n\nperiod of June–September 2009.\n\n      Father completed the anger control program of Opportunities Counseling\n\nCenter on January 9, 2013.\n\n      Although each parent had been ordered to pay $50 per month of child\n\nsupport to Grandmother with the first temporary order signed in April 2009, the\n\nparents complied with that order only rarely. The child support record admitted\n\nwith no objection shows that Mother made only eight $50 payments and one $40\n\npayment during the period of almost four years from the date child support was\n\nimposed through the date of the March 2013 trial. Mother admitted that she last\n\nmade a payment on February 23, 2011 and that her family provided a June 8,\n\n2012 payment to “help [her] out” while she was in jail and not working. She\n\n\n                                       16\n\fconceded that more than a year passed between her February 23, 2011 payment\n\nand the May 2012 filing of the petition to terminate. Mother admitted that she\n\nhad had plenty of time from her date of release from jail—August 23, 2012—to\n\nmake child support payments. Mother pointed to her incarceration, lack of job\n\nstability, and fixed income as bases for her failure to pay child support as\n\nordered. She admitted that she had been a Subway employee since December\n\n21, 2012.\n\n      Father admitted to making no child support payment until the Friday before\n\ntrial, when he paid $50, but he testified that he and his father “would help\n\n[Grandmother] out when she needed help with the kids.”\n\n      Mother also testified,\n\n             I love my kids very much, I do, and I’ve made a lot of bad\n      choices, which is very clear to everybody in this courtroom, but I\n      don’t think it’s that clear that I do care and love my children more\n      than anything and I do want what’s best for them, and I’m asking this\n      Court to please not terminate my rights and allow me to keep\n      proving myself to y’all and to the Court to be able to, one day, have\n      a great relationship with my children and maybe possibly have them\n      back.\n\n            And that’s pretty much all I’ve got.\n\n      Father was originally very appreciative of Grandmother’s helping out and\n\ntaking care of the children, but by the trial, he no longer believed that she acted\n\nin the children’s best interest. He explained, “[M]y mother told me if I got my life\n\nstraight and got a job, was sober, clean, and had a job and house and everything\n\nfor the kids, she would not mind handing me my kids back.”\n\n\n\n                                        17\n\f      Father further testified,\n\n             I would just like to express to the Court and everybody here, I\n      am a good father. I have made bad mistakes, but everybody makes\n      mistakes in life. I have matured highly in the past year. I have got a\n      job. . . . I’ve just matured a lot. . . . I’m going to classes, anger\n      management classes, BIP classes, all types of maturing stuff for\n      myself, for the best interest of my kids, because I do want my\n      children back one day and I want to be there to provide for my kids\n      for the rest of their life, and I just . . . think [Grandmother] and even\n      [Grandfather] . . . know me and they know I love my kids very much\n      and they know my kids love me very much. And I’ve done what my\n      mother has actually asked me before to do, which is get a job, be\n      clean, and live right, and I’ve done that . . . .\n\n      That’s all I have.\n\n      Grandmother testified that the children were doing well in her home.\n\nDaughter was making “straight As” in first grade at a neighborhood elementary\n\nschool. Son had been in pre-K three hours each school day, but Grandmother\n\nwithdrew him because of a conflict with her work hours. Grandfather took care of\n\nSon during Grandmother’s work hours. Grandfather generally worked different\n\nhours than Grandmother. Additionally, Grandmother’s daughter also watched\n\nSon when Grandparents were unavailable.           Grandmother admitted that her\n\ndaughter might have had a drug problem years ago but denied a recent problem.\n\n      When asked about her own use of prescribed hydrocodone, Grandmother\n\nexplained that she took the medicine when her Achilles heel was inflamed.\n\nGrandmother testified that she would take hydrocodone “out of necessity” but\n\nwas not addicted to it.     Grandmother admitted that Grandfather also tested\n\npositive for hydrocodone on the court-ordered drug test, that he did not have a\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\fprescription for the medicine at the time of the test, and that he had taken her\n\nhydrocodone without a prescription. Grandmother further testified that she had\n\nshared her prescription medicine with Grandfather when he was in pain. She\n\nstated that after Grandfather failed the drug test, they found out that it was not a\n\ngood idea for her to share her prescription medication with him.\n\n      Grandfather admitted that he had used hydrocodone without a prescription\n\nwhile the children were living in his home and that he had nonsuited his claims\n\nafter the drug test came back positive. Grandfather also testified that he loves\n\nthe children and has “contributed [his] share” to financially supporting the\n\nchildren.\n\n      Grandmother testified that she had never “really received any substantial\n\nchild support from” the parents, which had made life even more difficult.\n\nGrandmother stated that she works “[part-time] for a lady—[doing] a lot of things\n\nfor her, [from] bookkeeping, to cleaning, to managing her apartments” and that\n\nGrandfather manages a grocery store. She testified that they are not wealthy.\n\nGrandmother admitted that the litigation had cost a lot and had “substantially\n\naltered” her retirement plans.\n\n      Grandmother initially stated that the children had not visited with the\n\nparents while in her possession but later admitted that Father had visited the\n\nchildren while under her supervision. Grandmother also testified that the children\n\nhad seen their parents while in Grandma’s possession and knew information\n\nabout the court case that Grandma and Mother had told them. Grandmother had\n\n\n                                        19\n\fnot discussed the court case or trial with the children and believed that the\n\nknowledge caused them undue stress. Grandmother testified that Daughter had\n\nbeen very emotional and that Son had stated that he did not want to have to\n\nleave his home. She testified that the children were scared of leaving their home\n\nbecause they were “used to” Grandparents.\n\n      Grandmother testified that she should have the exclusive right to make\n\nmedical decisions and education decisions because she primarily had\n\npossession of the children. Grandmother expressed concern that even if the\n\nparents’ rights were terminated, Grandma would still allow them to visit the\n\nchildren during her periods of possession, and Grandmother did not believe\n\nthose visits would be in the children’s best interest.\n\n      Grandmother further testified that she had lived at her current home for six\n\nyears and had no plans to move.\n\n      Grandmother also testified that the children recognized Grandfather and\n\nher as their parents and called them Pawpaw and Mom respectively, even\n\nthough she had told them that she is their grandmother. Grandmother testified\n\nthat she loves the children “like they were [her] own,” that       they will never\n\n“want . . . for anything,” that she and Grandfather “just want the best for them,”\n\nand that she believes termination of the parents’ parental rights is best for the\n\nchildren.\n\n      Grandmother admitted that she had told Father “when [he] was staying\n\nwith [her] that if [he] kept [his] nose clean and stayed sober, got a job and lived\n\n\n                                         20\n\fright, that [she] would give [him his] kids back.” Grandmother testified that she\n\nhad told both parents “[t]hat if they got their—got off of the drugs and did the right\n\nthing, that they could have their children back,” but she stated that by the time of\n\ntrial, they had still not done so.\n\n      Grandmother also admitted that she and Grandma do not get along.\n\nNevertheless, Grandmother testified that she believes that it is in the children’s\n\nbest interest to have a relationship with Grandma.\n\n      Grandma testified that some of the pick-ups and drop-offs of the children\n\nhad not gone smoothly because Grandmother was argumentative, resistant, or\n\nabrasive, and Grandma felt threatened. Grandma also stated that\n\n             [t]he children have expressed that they can only say certain\n      things to their grandmother because she gets mad at them and she\n      puts them in time-out when she gets mad at them. So they—they\n      feel they can only share certain things with her.\n\n      Grandma also testified that the children had told her many times that they\n\nwanted to “go home,” meaning to her house or to their parents’ home, not\n\nGrandmother’s. Grandma further testified that she did not think that completely\n\nexcluding the parents from the children’s lives would be in their best interest\n\nbecause it would traumatize them not to ever be able to\n\n      see their parents because, yes, they do—they do love their parents\n      very much, and their parents love them very much, and given the\n      new situation, the new stake in life right now and all the\n      accomplishments, it is a wonderful, positive experience.\n\n      They relate well to their parents and, most certainly, their parents\n      have their best interest at heart.\n\n\n\n                                         21\n\f      On cross-examination, Grandma confirmed her statement that the parents\n\nhad the children’s best interest in their heart but stated that she did not so believe\n\nwhen the parents were doing methamphetamine in front of the children or when\n\ndomestic violence between them occurred in front of the children.           Grandma\n\ntestified that absent a court order prohibiting the parents from being around the\n\nchildren, she would allow such visits as long as the parents were not using drugs.\n\n      The trial court heard conflicting evidence about where the children wanted\n\nto live but heard no evidence about where either parent was living. On the other\n\nhand, Grandmother had been in the same home for six years and had no plan to\n\nmove; the children had therefore been in the same home with her for almost four\n\nyears and could look forward to the same stable home in the future. The children\n\nare obviously bonded with all the adult parties, but the evidence indicates that\n\nthey called Grandmother “Mom” of their own volition. There was no evidence\n\nabout any special needs, other than Mother’s contention that the children needed\n\ncounseling.\n\n      The parents’ fairly recent drug use and confinement in jail after TDFPS had\n\nalready removed their children, as well as Mother’s relapses even after three or\n\nfour stints in rehab, provide some indication of the emotional and physical danger\n\nto the children in their parents’ care, as does the parents’ failure to take even a\n\ntoken responsibility for supporting the children or to take any independent\n\ninterest in their lives during the long removal. While the evidence concerning\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\fGrandfather’s use of Grandmother’s hydrocodone shows a lack of judgment,\n\nthere was no evidence that Grandparents had any addiction issues.\n\n      The parents’ own words indicate that they were not ready for the children\n\nto be returned to them at the end of trial, and there was no evidence about the\n\nparents’ plans for the children. Grandmother, on the other hand, discussed the\n\nchildren’s schooling, Son’s care providers, how she and Grandfather provide for\n\nthe children financially, and her belief that Grandma and the children should\n\nmaintain contact, even though Grandmother and Grandma do not get along,\n\nbecause that contact benefits the children.\n\n      Viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the finding and\n\njudgment and considering the nonexclusive Holley factors, we hold that the trial\n\ncourt could have reasonably formed a firm conviction or belief that termination of\n\nthe parental relationship between the parents and the children was in the\n\nchildren’s best interest, and we therefore hold the evidence legally sufficient to\n\nsupport the trial court’s best interest finding. 16   Similarly, reviewing all the\n\nevidence with appropriate deference to the factfinder, we hold that the trial court\n\ncould have reasonably formed a firm conviction or belief that termination of the\n\nparental relationship between the parents and the children is in the children’s\n\n\n\n\n      16\n       See Tex.

Much of the litigation below was between\n      [Grandmother] and [Grandma] over custodial violations allegedly\n      committed by [Grandmother] and efforts by [Grandma] to determine\n      drug testing. Nothing was said regarding the time preparing for the\n      litigation between [Grandmother and Grandma],\n\nand concluding that “[i]t was an abuse of discretion to award all of the fees\n\nagainst [the parents].” The parents, however, failed to preserve their segregation\n\nargument in the trial court. 22    We therefore confine our analysis to their\n\nsufficiency complaint. 23\n\n      Section 106.002 of the family code authorizes the trial court to award\n\n“reasonable attorney’s fees and expenses” in suits affecting the parent-child\n\nrelationship (SAPCRs), including termination suits. 24 The award of attorney’s\n\nfees in a SAPCR is within the sound discretion of the trial court. 25 Evidence must\n\nsupport the award. 26 However,\n\n      [s]pecificity . . . is not required. Instead, to support a request for\n      reasonable attorney’s fees, testimony should be given regarding the\n\n      22\n       See Green Int’l, Inc. v.

This case has been ongoing for a period of three\n      years now. In that time, we have billed approximately—or not\n      approximately—in the amount of $33,742.69. This case has\n      become obscene. It has become a waste to the people who have\n      actually cared for and taken care of these children. I am asking that\n      that dollar amount, Your Honor, be assessed against [the parents],\n      jointly and severally liable, and that’s what I’m requesting. I bill at\n      the rate of $225.00 per hour, which is a very customary rate for a\n      lawyer with my accomplishments in this field.\n\n      Grandma’s trial counsel briefly cross-examined Grandmother’s trial\n\ncounsel, asking only whether he believed that the fees were “both reasonable\n\nand necessary” and eliciting an affirmative response. Neither parent chose to\n\ncross-examine Grandmother’s trial counsel.\n\n      The trial court also admitted without objection Grandmother’s trial\n\ncounsel’s summary of attorney’s fees earned from April 1, 2009 through March\n\n18, 2013, which showed that he billed at a rate of $200 per hour, billed 149.1\n\nhours, and earned $29,820; that an associate also billed at a rate of $200, billed\n\n1.5 hours, and earned $300; that the paralegals who worked on the case billed\n\n$125 per hour, billed 17.5 hours, and earned $2,187.50; and that the total fees\n\n      27\n       Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                        26\n\fwere $32,307.50. Out-of-pocket costs were listed at $1,435.19, and total fees\n\nand costs were $33,742.69.\n\n      The trial court also took judicial notice of the court’s file, which revealed\n\nthat Grandmother’s trial counsel propounded discovery, filed and responded to\n\nseveral pleadings, and made several court appearances. The trial court also\n\nspecifically found that\n\n•     Grandmother’s trial counsel “incurred attorney’s fees and costs . . . in the\n      total amount of $30,000.00”;\n\n•     the attorney’s “fees are a reasonable and customary fee for an attorney”\n      with Grandmother’s trial counsel’s “experience practicing in Tarrant\n      County, Texas”;\n\n•     Grandmother’s trial counsel’s “services were for the benefit of the\n      children . . . and were reasonable and necessary to protect the emotional\n      and physical welfare of the children”; and\n\n•     Grandmother’s attorney “is entitled to recover from [Father and Mother]\n      jointly and severally $30,000.00 over and against the Respondents herein,\n      the amount shall include interest from March 21, 2013, for such fees, costs\n      and expenses.”\n\nThe parents did not challenge the finding that the services were for the children’s\n\nbenefit and were reasonable and necessary to protect their welfare. Because we\n\nhold that there is some evidence to support this finding, it is binding. 28\n\n      Thus, the record provides evidence of the complexity of the case and\n\nevidence of Grandmother’s trial counsel’s preparation, and the trial court’s\n\n\n      28\n        See McGalliard v.

The unchallenged finding\n\nprovides that the attorney’s fees were for the children’s benefit.
