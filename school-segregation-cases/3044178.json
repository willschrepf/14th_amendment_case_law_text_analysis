Snider and Win Heiskala, for Respondent Saracia Shannahan.\n\n       Appellant and third party claimant Higgs Fletcher & Mack, LLP (Higgs) appeals\n\nfrom a family court order denying its third party claim to ownership of certain insurance\n\nfunds at issue in the divorce proceedings of its former client, appellant William P.\n\nShannahan. The family court ruled the funds, which Higgs held in trust, belonged at all\n\ntimes to William's former spouse, respondent Saracia Shannahan; Higgs had no right to\n\nthe funds in part because William's1 purported assignment of those funds to Higgs was\n\ninvalid as in violation of an automatic temporary restraining order (ATRO; Fam. Code,2\n\n§ 2040, subd. (a)(2)) barring transfer or hypothecation of any property that remained in\n\neffect until the final division of William and Saracia's property; and Saracia had a lien\n\nover the funds that was superior to William's assignment to Higgs.\n\n       Higgs appeals from the order, and William joins in its arguments. It contends (1)\n\nthe family court's determination that the funds always belonged to Saracia is internally\n\ninconsistent, which is itself grounds for reversal; (2) the court erred by making its\n\nfindings without permitting a hearing before a special master on the issue in\n\ncontravention of the parties' prior judgment on reserved issues and Higgs's right to due\n\nprocess; and (3) the court erred by ruling Saracia's interest in the insurance funds had\n\npriority over Higgs's interest. We affirm the order denying Higgs's claim of ownership\n\n\n\n1      We refer to William and Saracia by their first names for convenience and clarity.\n\n2      Statutory references are to the Family Code unless otherwise stated.\n                                              2\n\fon grounds William's assignment and pledge of the funds to Higgs violated the ATRO,\n\nand on that basis the family court did not err by invalidating the purported transfer and\n\nHiggs's interest.\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       William and Saracia were involved in divorce proceedings, in connection with\n\nwhich they disputed the characterization and division of personal property (furniture and\n\nfurnishings) destroyed in a fire. In March 2008, following trial, a privately compensated\n\ntemporary judge (Hon. Thomas Ashworth III (Ret.)) entered a final statement of decision\n\non reserved issues. In part, the court appointed a special master pursuant to Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 639 to make recommendations to it concerning which items of\n\nfurniture or furnishings were separate property, as well as an appropriate equal division\n\nof the community items. Several months later, the court ordered that any insurance\n\nproceeds relating to the personal property be deposited into an interest bearing segregated\n\ntrust account of William's counsel, Higgs, for the benefit of the parties. Thereafter,\n\nSaracia sought, and the family court stated it would grant, a \"judicial lien\" in Saracia's\n\nfavor against William's assets.\n\n       On August 29, 2008, the court entered a judgment of dissolution on reserved\n\nissues in the matter. In addition to appointing the special master with respect to the\n\ncharacterization and division of furniture, the court reserved jurisdiction over the\n\ndisposition of the insurance proceeds.\n\n       In October 2008, the court entered its findings and order after hearing granting\n\nSaracia a judicial lien \"against all assets in [William's] name . . . .\" The court also\n\n                                               3\n\fordered that the parties' ATRO's would \"remain in effect until a final division of all the\n\nassets under the judgment has been made.\"\n\n        In April 2009, William executed an assignment of his interest in $179,297 of the\n\npersonal property insurance proceeds (the insurance proceeds) within the Higgs trust\n\naccount. At the same time, William executed a $100,000 promissory note in Higgs's\n\nfavor and a concurrent pledge agreement granting Higgs a security interest in the\n\ninsurance proceeds for his timely and complete payment of the amounts owing on the\n\nnote.\n\n        In June 2010, Saracia filed a notice of lien under Code of Civil Procedure section\n\n708.410 et seq. based on the August 29, 2008 judgment.\n\n        In early 2012, the court ordered on the parties' stipulation that all of the insurance\n\nproceeds held in trust by Higgs \"on behalf of [William] or any third party on his behalf,\n\nshall be held on deposit pending disbursement pursuant to court order or judgment that\n\nspecifically authorizes disbursement.\"\n\n        In late 2012, Saracia sought a hearing to address, inter alia, the division of the\n\ninsurance proceeds held in trust. She asked the court to order those proceeds be deemed\n\nWilliam's property on condition that the funds be released to her in partial satisfaction of\n\nthe $3,400,000 judgment in her favor in the matter. In a sworn declaration, Saracia\n\nacknowledged that Higgs had asserted a lien against the proceeds, but she averred any\n\nsuch lien had not been disclosed to her until July 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f        The hearing on Saracia's request did not take place until September 2013, with\n\nWilliam represented by different counsel.3 The court observed that there had not been an\n\nadjudication of the characterization and division of the insurance proceeds, which was to\n\nbe done by the appointed special master. Saracia proposed to concede her interest in the\n\nfunds to William as long as they were applied to her judgment. Observing that the\n\nproposal made sense, the court ruled Higgs had no right to the funds held in trust; it\n\ndetermined that the owner of the funds \"is and has always been [Saracia] to satisfy her\n\njudgment\" and its determination \"extinguishe[d] any rights that Higgs might have\" in\n\nthem.\n\n        In its findings and order after hearing, the court found given Saracia's concession\n\nof her interest in the insurance proceeds, \"the funds are and have always belonged to\n\n[Saracia] to be applied to the Judgment.\" The court further ruled: \"The claim of\n\nassignment to Higgs . . . is denied because as Trustee of the funds by prior court order,\n\nHiggs . . . has no rights to the funds and any rights it purports to have are extinguished by\n\nthe claim of [Saracia], and therefore denied. Said funds are to be released to [Saracia]\n\nforthwith.\" Days later, Higgs released the funds to Saracia's counsel with interest,\n\nnotifying counsel of its third party claim.\n\n\n\n3      In his opening brief, William states that the court began the hearing by saying,\n\"Anything she asks for, she gets. If anybody thinks she shouldn't get it, then they can\ncome to me and have me order that she doesn't get it. . . . [¶] . . . But I assume if she\nasks for something, she needs it, and it would be provided.\" The court's comments were\nnot referencing Saracia, but Carolyn Brock, who was appointed to prepare the parties'\nqualified domestic relations order (QDRO), and who needed authorization to access\nWilliam's retirement accounts.\n                                              5\n\f       Higgs filed a third party claim of ownership in the family court proceeding under\n\nCode of Civil Procedure sections 720.110 and 720.210. Higgs asserted it had acquired an\n\nownership interest by virtue of William's assignment, which it maintained was perfected\n\nin April 2009, and had also acquired a lien against William's interest in the funds\n\nassertedly created and perfected by the pledge agreement William executed on the same\n\ndate. Higgs asserted that its ownership interest and lien were senior to Saracia's judgment\n\nlien, which was filed in June 2010. Higgs further argued the ATRO did not preclude\n\nWilliam's assignment of the proceeds because the assignment constituted payment of\n\nWilliam's attorney fees and costs in the family court proceeding. Saracia opposed the\n\nclaim, asserting in part that William's assignment contravened both the judicial lien and\n\nthe ATRO in the dissolution action.\n\n       In October 2014, the court confirmed its prior findings and order after hearing. It\n\nmade the following additional findings and orders, which the court partly handwrote:\n\n       \"a. The parties agree there is no factual dispute as to the wording and intent of the\n\njudgment;\n\n       \"b. William . . . never had ownership of the funds;\n\n       \"c. A Judicial Lien, or if that term is inappropriate, the appropriate device to\n\nprevent any transfer, encumbrance, or restriction on the ability of the funds to be\n\ntransferred in accordance with the court's [unintelligible] determination as to ownership,\n\nwas placed on the funds in 2008 before the assignment to [Higgs];\n\n       \"d. This Court interprets the Judicial Lien or other appropriate device as an order\n\nthat the funds not be encumbered, transferred, or restricted in any way that would\n\n                                              6\n\ffrustrate the intent of putting the funds in escrow [trust] so that once the Court determines\n\nthe disposition, that the recipient receives the funds right away without any other claims\n\nof ownership;\n\n       \"e. The assignment of the funds to [Higgs] violated the clear intent of the order of\n\nJudicial Lien or other appropriate device;\n\n       \"f. The assignment of the funds to [Higgs] violated the . . . ATRO's[], which\n\nremain in effect until final distribution of all assets in this case;\n\n       \"g. The assignment of the funds to [Higgs] violated the clear intent of the Court's\n\nprior orders entrusting the funds to [Higgs] to hold in its client trust account pending\n\nfurther court order or agreement of the parties;\n\n       \"h. The Court affirms its prior order that the funds are to be released to [Saracia].\n\n       \"i. Counsel for Third-Party Claimant agreed on the record that based on the\n\nCourt's findings Third-Party Claimant has no rights to the funds at issue.\"\n\n       Higgs appeals from the October 2014 order.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n       Higgs advances several theories as to why the court erred in its order. We need\n\nonly address one: Higgs's contention that the ATRO did not prevent William from\n\nassigning or otherwise transferring his interest in the funds to Higgs. We conclude the\n\ncourt's finding that William's assignment and pledge agreement violated the ATRO is a\n\nsufficient ground by itself to invalidate Higgs's purported interest and affirm the court's\n\norder. The matter is one of statutory construction that we review de novo. (Coker v.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2016) 62 Cal.4th 667, 674.) \" 'As always, we start with the\n\n                                                7\n\flanguage of the statue, \"giv[ing] the words their usual and ordinary meaning [citation],\n\nwhile construing them in light of the statute as a whole and the statute's purpose.\" ' \"\n\n(Ibid.)\n\n          In every dissolution proceeding, four standard mutual ATRO's bind the petitioner\n\n(on filing the petition and issuance of summons) and the respondent (on personal service\n\nor waiver of service of the petition and summons). (§§ 233, subd. (a), 2040, subd. (a);\n\nsee In re Marriage of McTiernan & Dubrow (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1090, 1102.) The\n\nATRO's bar both parties from, among other things, \"transferring, encumbering,\n\nhypothecating, concealing, or in any way disposing of any property, real or personal,\n\nwhether community, quasi-community, or separate, without the written consent of the\n\nother party or an order of the court, except in the usual course of business or for the\n\nnecessities of life . . . .\" (§ 2040, subd. (a)(2).)\n\n          Section 2040, subdivision (a)(2) further provides: \"Notwithstanding the\n\nforegoing, nothing in the restraining order shall preclude a party from using community\n\nproperty, quasi-community property, or the party's own separate property to pay\n\nreasonable attorney's fees and costs in order to retain legal counsel in the proceeding. A\n\nparty who uses community property or quasi-community property to pay his or her\n\nattorney's retainer for fees and costs under this provision shall account to the community\n\nfor the use of the property. A party who uses other property that is subsequently\n\ndetermined to be the separate property of the other party to pay his or her attorney's\n\nretainer for fees and costs under this provision shall account to the other party for the use\n\nof the property.\" This provision creates an exception to the ATRO's, permitting a party's\n\n                                                 8\n\fuse of community, quasi-community, or separate property to pay attorney fees and costs\n\nfor retaining legal counsel in their dissolution proceeding.\n\n       There is no dispute that the ATRO's issued in this case, or that the family court\n\nhad ordered the ATRO's to remain effective \"until a final division of all the assets under\n\nthe judgment has been made.\" Rather, pointing to the foregoing exception permitting a\n\nparty to use community property to \"pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs in order to\n\nretain legal counsel in the proceeding\" (§ 2040, subd. (a)(2)), Higgs's sole argument\n\nregarding these orders is that William's assignment constituted payment of his attorney\n\nfees and costs incurred in the divorce proceeding and it was \"therefore . . . valid and not\n\nprecluded by the ATROs.\"4 In its reply brief, Higgs expands on this argument, pointing\n\nout there is no case authority directly on point, but maintaining \"[a]s a matter of logic, the\n\nexception must apply to the payment of ongoing attorneys' fees and costs to keep counsel\n\nretained during the pendency of dissolution. First, attorneys' fees and costs do not arise\n\nbefore litigation commences—i.e., when the client would normally be expected to pay\n\nthe initial retainer. Further, Saracia's argument results in an illogical and impractical\n\nresult: a client in a dissolution proceeding being unable to pay his counsel after payment\n\n\n\n4      Other than this exception, Higgs does not present any other theory as to why\nWilliam's conduct in executing the pledge agreement or assignment falls outside section\n2040. Indeed, the restraining order imposed by the statute prevents a party from\n\"hypothecating . . . or in any way disposing of\" property without the other party's written\nconsent or court order. To \"hypothecate\" is to \"pledge (property) as security or collateral\nfor a debt, without delivery of title or possession.\" (Black's Law Dict. (10th ed. 2014)\np. 861, col. 1.) Nor does Higgs argue William's actions fell within the exception for the\ndisposal of property in the \"usual course of business or for the necessities of life.\"\n(§ 2040, subd. (a)(2); see Gale v. Superior Court (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 1388, 1392.)\n                                              9\n\fof the initial retainer.\" Higgs further argues, citing a family law treatise, that its\n\ninterpretation \"comports with the commonplace practice in dissolution cases where\n\n'attorneys routinely contract for a lien against the client's separate property and\n\ncommunity property share awarded by the court or received in settlement.' \" It maintains\n\nWilliam's action in giving it a lien against his potential separate property (as opposed to a\n\npresent interest in his property) is standard practice in dissolution cases.\n\n       On our independent review, we do not read the statute in this manner. Section\n\n2040 does not define the phrase \"in order to retain legal counsel in the proceeding\" or\n\ncontain any explanation of its meaning. The statute's plain meaning controls if there is no\n\nambiguity in the statutory language. (Poole v. Orange County Fire Authority (2015) 61\n\nCal.4th 1378, 1385.) But \" ' \"[t]o seek the meaning of a statute is not simply to look up\n\ndictionary definitions and then stitch together the results. Rather, it is to discern the sense\n\nof the statute, and therefore its words, in the legal and broader culture. Obviously, a\n\nstatute has no meaning apart from its words. Similarly, its words have no meaning apart\n\nfrom the world in which they are spoken.\" ' \" (State of California v. Altus Finance, S.A.\n\n(2005) 36 Cal.4th 1284, 1296; see also Arnett v. Dal Cielo (1996) 14 Cal.4th 4, 19\n\n[\"[W]hen a word used in a statute has a well-established legal meaning, it will be given\n\nthat meaning in construing the statute\"].) \"In interpreting a statutory provision, 'our task\n\nis to select the construction that comports most closely with the Legislature's apparent\n\nintent, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the statutes' general purpose, and to\n\navoid a construction that would lead to unreasonable, impractical, or arbitrary results.' \"\n\n(Poole, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1385.) We read the statute \" ' \"with reference to the entire\n\n                                               10\n\fscheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain\n\neffectiveness.\" ' \" (Ibid., quoting Horwich v. Superior Court (1999) 21 Cal.4th 272, 276.)\n\n       Our analysis of section 2040 under these principles, which as we explain requires\n\nan examination of the Legislature's intent, compels us to reject William's arguments. We\n\nlook first to the words and phrase used to determine what the Legislature meant for a\n\nparty to use community property \"to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs in order to\n\nretain legal counsel in the proceeding.\" Black's Law Dictionary defines the word \"retain\"\n\nin various ways, including to \"hold in possession or under control\" or to \"keep,\" as well\n\nas \"[t]o hire; to engage for the provision of services (as by a lawyer . . .) . . . .\" (Black's\n\nLaw Dict., supra, p. 1509.) It defines the word \"retainer\" as \"[a] client's authorization for\n\na lawyer to act in a case,\" \"[a] fee that a client pays to a lawyer simply to be available\n\nwhen the client needs legal help during a specified period or on a specified matter\" and\n\nalso \"[a] lump-sum fee paid by the client to engage a lawyer at the outset of a matter.\"\n\n(Ibid.)5 Though these definitions plainly include a party's initial hiring of an attorney,\n\nand the common legal understanding of a retainer is payment for the purpose of hiring,\n\nthey are not limited to that interpretation. Thus, these definitions do not definitively\n\nresolve whether the Legislature intended that specific meaning.\n\n\n\n\n5      The common dictionary definitions are similar. (See Merriam-Webster's\nCollegiate Dict. (11th ed. 2006) p. 1063 [defining \"retain\" as to \"keep in possession or\nuse\" or \"to keep in one's pay or service; specif: to employ by paying a retainer\" and\ndefining \"retainer\" as \"the act of a client by which the services of a lawyer . . . are\nengaged\" or \"a fee paid to a lawyer or professional adviser for advice or services or for a\nclaim on services when needed\"].)\n                                               11\n\f       Where the statute's language is inconclusive, we turn to other extrinsic aids in\n\ninterpretation, including legislative history. (State of California v. Altus Finance, S.A.,\n\nsupra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1296 [\"Because the language of the statute does not answer the\n\nquestion before us, ' \"we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible\n\nobjects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, . . . and the\n\nstatutory scheme of which the statute is a part\" ' \"].) Doing so reveals that the legislative\n\nhistory of section 2040 is dispositive on the question in Saracia's favor.\n\n       Family Code section 2040, subdivision (a) continued former Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 412.21, which provided \"for the automatic granting of restraining\n\norders with the issuance and service of a summons in an action for dissolution or\n\nannulment of a marriage, [and] for legal separation.\" (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Assem. Bill\n\nNo. 1905 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1989, Summary Dig., p. 415; Stats. 1994, ch.\n\n1269, § 13.) In 1999, the Legislature amended section 2040, subdivision (a)(2) to \"cure\n\nan anomaly in current law which prevents a party in a dissolution proceeding from using\n\nhis or her own separate property to pay attorney's fees and costs incurred in retaining\n\nlegal counsel.\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 357 (1999–2000 Reg.\n\nSess.) as amended Mar. 18, 1999.) Thus, the Legislature proposed to include a party's\n\nuse of quasi-community property and separate property within the above exception for\n\npayment of reasonable attorney fees in order to retain counsel. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary,\n\ncom. on Sen. Bill No. 357 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 18, 1999.) The\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee's analysis states that \"the restraining order . . . is intended to\n\npreserve the community assets and to prevent waste or concealment of property that may\n\n                                              12\n\fotherwise be determined to belong to the community.\" (Ibid.) However, the use of the\n\nproperty for the exception for payment of attorney fees is \"restricted to attorney's fees and\n\ncosts to retain legal counsel.\" (Ibid.) The committee analysis states, \"The original intent\n\nof existing law in allowing use of community property for payment of attorney's fees is to\n\nfacilitate a party's ability to retain legal counsel. Thus, the exception is allowed only for\n\nthe purpose of retaining legal counsel. [¶] This bill would similarly allow the use of\n\nquasi-community or separate property only for payment of attorney's fees and costs in\n\norder to retain legal counsel. [¶] Additional expenses for attorney's fees and costs can be\n\ntaken care of by applying to the court for an order for such expenditures.\" (Ibid., italics\n\nadded.)\n\n       In its analysis, the Senate Judiciary Committee addressed a comment by the State\n\nBar's family law section, which proposed \"further amendments that would permit\n\nunilateral use of community, quasi-community and separate property to pay attorney's\n\nfees and costs beyond the retainer fee that would be permitted under this bill,\" so as to\n\nreduce the number of hearings in family court. The committee observed that such an\n\nexpansion \"could, in some cases, cause diminishment of community assets.\" (Sen. Com.\n\non Judiciary, com. on Sen. Bill No. 357 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 18,\n\n1999.) It made clear that attorney fees and costs beyond the retainer fee could be taken\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fcare of by court order, or existing law requiring an advanced five days notice to the other\n\nparty of any \"extraordinary expenditures\" with an accounting to the court. (Ibid.)6\n\n       The legislative analyses of the subdivision (a)(2) exception to the ATRO's within\n\nsection 2040 demonstrate that in using the phrase \"in order to retain legal counsel in the\n\nproceeding,\" the Legislature referred to the initial hiring of counsel, and not fees and\n\ncosts incurred thereafter to maintain counsel in the action, which must be approved by\n\ncourt order or other mechanism with notice to the other party in the proceeding. This\n\nconstruction comports with the purpose of the ATRO's to prevent the waste or\n\nconcealment of community assets by a party to pay ongoing legal fees in a dissolution\n\n\n\n6      More fully, the Senate Judiciary Committee analysis states: \"Existing law requires\nadvanced 5-days' notice to the other party of any 'extraordinary expenditures' and requires\nan accounting to the court of such expenditures. Attorney's fees and costs beyond the\nretainer fee can be taken care of under this 'extraordinary expenditures' provision, or by\nobtaining a court order. [¶] The suggested expansion of the bill would circumvent the\nexisting mechanism by which the court monitors 'extraordinary expenditures,' i.e., those\nbeyond the usual course of business and for the necessities of life. Thus, while perhaps\nreducing the number of hearings at which authorization for further use of community,\nquasi-community or separate property is requested, the suggestion made by the State Bar\nFamily Law Section would allow attorneys to charge fees and costs without regard to the\naccounting requirements of the court and without prior notice to the other party of the use\nof community or quasi-community assets.\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, com. on Sen. Bill\nNo. 357 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 18, 1999.)\n       We observe that other committee analyses support the conclusion that the\nLegislature used the terms \"retain\" and \"retainer\" to refer to the initial hiring of counsel in\nthe proceeding. (See Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 357 (1999-\n2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 18, 1999 [stating in a \"summary\" that the bill\n\"[a]llows a party to a dissolution to use or encumber that party's separate property or\nquasi-community property to hire an attorney in a dissolution proceeding, and requires\nthe party to account for that use\" and also stating, \"The author introduced this bill to\ncorrect what seems to be an oversight in the law and ensure that neither party to a\ndissolution proceeding is unnecessarily deprived of adequate representation\"], italics\nadded.)\n                                              14\n\fproceeding, beyond the initial retainer. Finally, William's reading of the statute as\n\npermitting the payment of any ongoing attorney fees and costs after the initial hiring of\n\ncounsel would eliminate or render superfluous the phrase \"in order to retain legal counsel\n\nin the proceeding\" from the statute, violating basic tenets of statutory construction.\n\n(Tuolumne Jobs & Small Business Alliance v. Superior Court (2014) 59 Cal.4th 1029,\n\n1038-1039 [\"It is a maxim of statutory interpretation that courts should give meaning to\n\nevery word of a statute and should avoid constructions that would render any word or\n\nprovision surplusage. . . . 'An interpretation that renders statutory language a nullity is\n\nobviously to be avoided' \"].)\n\n       Because William's actions in assigning and pledging his interest in the funds was\n\nnot for the purpose of retaining Higgs but to pay Higgs's ongoing fees and costs in the\n\nproceeding, the trial court correctly found they violated the terms of the ATRO barring\n\ntransfer or hypothecation of property, which remained in effect until the final division of\n\nWilliam and Saracia's assets. As a consequence, the assignment and corresponding\n\npledge agreement was voidable on Saracia's motion. A transfer of property in violation\n\nof an injunction is voidable. (See, e.g., Powell v. Bank of Lemoore (1899) 125 Cal. 468,\n\n472 [involving a sale of real property]; Warburton v. Kieferle (1955) 135 Cal.App.2d\n\n278, 283.) \"In such case, upon a proper showing by a party entitled to the consideration\n\nof a court of equity, relief may be granted by setting aside such sale.\" (Powell v. Bank of\n\n\n\n\n                                             15\n\fLemoore, at p. 472.)7 Having concluded the court correctly invalidated Higgs's\n\npurported interest, we do not reach Higgs's remaining contentions.\n\n\n\n\n7       We reject as without merit Higgs's argument that William's arrangement was\nnothing more than a commonplace charging lien. The treatise cited by Higgs explains\nthat such a lien against a future award or settlement is contractual, and \"may only be\nenforced by counsel in an independent action against the client (counsel has no right to\nintervene in the main action to establish the amount of the lien or enforce it).\"\n(Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law (The Rutter Group 2015)\n¶ 1:280b, italics added, some italics omitted; see also Mojtahedi v. Vargas (2014) 228\nCal.App.4th 974, 977-978; Bandy v. Mt. Diablo Unified Sch. Dist. (1976) 56 Cal.App.3d\n230, 234.) The treatise additionally emphasizes that \"charging liens may not be enforced\nduring pendency of the proceedings . . . .\" (Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice Guide:\nFamily Law, supra, ¶ 1:285, some italics added.) Finally the treatise warns about ethical\nimplications of taking a secured promissory note for fees, as Higgs did here: \"Counsel\nmay ethically accept the client's unsecured promissory note in payment of fees; this\narrangement violates no public policy because, if a fee dispute arises, the attorney may\nenforce the note against the client's assets only through a judicial proceeding where the\ncourt will scrutinize the fairness of the transaction. . . . But taking a secured promissory\nnote from a client is a far different matter[.]\" (Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice Guide:\nFamily Law, supra, ¶ 1:287.) One such problem recognized by the authors is the concern\nover the ATRO's. (Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, supra, ¶ 1:300\net seq.) They point out, with respect to a real property lien, that \"[a] family law attorney's\nreal property lien given before commencement of the proceeding would, of course, not\nimplicate the § 2040(a)(2) TRO. Likewise, though § 2040(a)(2) does not expressly\nexempt a § 2033 lien, the statute's broad exemption for the payment of attorney fees and\ncosts to 'retain' legal counsel in the proceeding (above) should protect enforceability of\nsuch a lien after the TRO is in effect. This seems especially true once the court passes on\nthe validity of the lien pursuant to §§ 2033 and 2034 . . . . [See . . . § 2040(a)(2)—TRO\nbars unilateral encumbrance without court order].\" (Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice\nGuide: Family Law, supra, ¶ 1:300.) William's assignment and pledge of a secured\ninterest in the insurance proceeds, given after commencement of the proceeding and not\nfor the purpose of paying an initial retainer, gives rise to these concerns.\n\n                                             16\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n\n      The order is affirmed.

The family court ruled the funds, which Higgs held in trust, belonged at all\n\ntimes to William's former spouse, respondent Saracia Shannahan; Higgs had no right to\n\nthe funds in part because William's1 purported assignment of those funds to Higgs was\n\ninvalid as in violation of an automatic temporary restraining order (ATRO; Fam. Code,2\n\n§ 2040, subd. (a)(2)) barring transfer or hypothecation of any property that remained in\n\neffect until the final division of William and Saracia's property; and Saracia had a lien\n\nover the funds that was superior to William's assignment to Higgs.\n\n       Higgs appeals from the order, and William joins in its arguments. It contends (1)\n\nthe family court's determination that the funds always belonged to Saracia is internally\n\ninconsistent, which is itself grounds for reversal; (2) the court erred by making its\n\nfindings without permitting a hearing before a special master on the issue in\n\ncontravention of the parties' prior judgment on reserved issues and Higgs's right to due\n\nprocess; and (3) the court erred by ruling Saracia's interest in the insurance funds had\n\npriority over Higgs's interest. We affirm the order denying Higgs's claim of ownership\n\n\n\n1      We refer to William and Saracia by their first names for convenience and clarity.\n\n2      Statutory references are to the Family Code unless otherwise stated.\n                                              2\n\fon grounds William's assignment and pledge of the funds to Higgs violated the ATRO,\n\nand on that basis the family court did not err by invalidating the purported transfer and\n\nHiggs's interest.\n\n                    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       William and Saracia were involved in divorce proceedings, in connection with\n\nwhich they disputed the characterization and division of personal property (furniture and\n\nfurnishings) destroyed in a fire. In March 2008, following trial, a privately compensated\n\ntemporary judge (Hon. Thomas Ashworth III (Ret.)) entered a final statement of decision\n\non reserved issues. In part, the court appointed a special master pursuant to Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 639 to make recommendations to it concerning which items of\n\nfurniture or furnishings were separate property, as well as an appropriate equal division\n\nof the community items. Several months later, the court ordered that any insurance\n\nproceeds relating to the personal property be deposited into an interest bearing segregated\n\ntrust account of William's counsel, Higgs, for the benefit of the parties. Thereafter,\n\nSaracia sought, and the family court stated it would grant, a \"judicial lien\" in Saracia's\n\nfavor against William's assets.\n\n       On August 29, 2008, the court entered a judgment of dissolution on reserved\n\nissues in the matter. In addition to appointing the special master with respect to the\n\ncharacterization and division of furniture, the court reserved jurisdiction over the\n\ndisposition of the insurance proceeds.\n\n       In October 2008, the court entered its findings and order after hearing granting\n\nSaracia a judicial lien \"against all assets in [William's] name . . . .\" The court also\n\n                                               3\n\fordered that the parties' ATRO's would \"remain in effect until a final division of all the\n\nassets under the judgment has been made.\"\n\n        In April 2009, William executed an assignment of his interest in $179,297 of the\n\npersonal property insurance proceeds (the insurance proceeds) within the Higgs trust\n\naccount. At the same time, William executed a $100,000 promissory note in Higgs's\n\nfavor and a concurrent pledge agreement granting Higgs a security interest in the\n\ninsurance proceeds for his timely and complete payment of the amounts owing on the\n\nnote.\n\n        In June 2010, Saracia filed a notice of lien under Code of Civil Procedure section\n\n708.410 et seq. based on the August 29, 2008 judgment.\n\n        In early 2012, the court ordered on the parties' stipulation that all of the insurance\n\nproceeds held in trust by Higgs \"on behalf of [William] or any third party on his behalf,\n\nshall be held on deposit pending disbursement pursuant to court order or judgment that\n\nspecifically authorizes disbursement.\"\n\n        In late 2012, Saracia sought a hearing to address, inter alia, the division of the\n\ninsurance proceeds held in trust. She asked the court to order those proceeds be deemed\n\nWilliam's property on condition that the funds be released to her in partial satisfaction of\n\nthe $3,400,000 judgment in her favor in the matter. In a sworn declaration, Saracia\n\nacknowledged that Higgs had asserted a lien against the proceeds, but she averred any\n\nsuch lien had not been disclosed to her until July 2012.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f        The hearing on Saracia's request did not take place until September 2013, with\n\nWilliam represented by different counsel.3 The court observed that there had not been an\n\nadjudication of the characterization and division of the insurance proceeds, which was to\n\nbe done by the appointed special master. Saracia proposed to concede her interest in the\n\nfunds to William as long as they were applied to her judgment. Observing that the\n\nproposal made sense, the court ruled Higgs had no right to the funds held in trust; it\n\ndetermined that the owner of the funds \"is and has always been [Saracia] to satisfy her\n\njudgment\" and its determination \"extinguishe[d] any rights that Higgs might have\" in\n\nthem.\n\n        In its findings and order after hearing, the court found given Saracia's concession\n\nof her interest in the insurance proceeds, \"the funds are and have always belonged to\n\n[Saracia] to be applied to the Judgment.\" The court further ruled: \"The claim of\n\nassignment to Higgs . . . is denied because as Trustee of the funds by prior court order,\n\nHiggs . . . has no rights to the funds and any rights it purports to have are extinguished by\n\nthe claim of [Saracia], and therefore denied. Said funds are to be released to [Saracia]\n\nforthwith.\" Days later, Higgs released the funds to Saracia's counsel with interest,\n\nnotifying counsel of its third party claim.\n\n\n\n3      In his opening brief, William states that the court began the hearing by saying,\n\"Anything she asks for, she gets. If anybody thinks she shouldn't get it, then they can\ncome to me and have me order that she doesn't get it. . . . [¶] . . . But I assume if she\nasks for something, she needs it, and it would be provided.\" The court's comments were\nnot referencing Saracia, but Carolyn Brock, who was appointed to prepare the parties'\nqualified domestic relations order (QDRO), and who needed authorization to access\nWilliam's retirement accounts.\n                                              5\n\f       Higgs filed a third party claim of ownership in the family court proceeding under\n\nCode of Civil Procedure sections 720.110 and 720.210. Higgs asserted it had acquired an\n\nownership interest by virtue of William's assignment, which it maintained was perfected\n\nin April 2009, and had also acquired a lien against William's interest in the funds\n\nassertedly created and perfected by the pledge agreement William executed on the same\n\ndate. Higgs asserted that its ownership interest and lien were senior to Saracia's judgment\n\nlien, which was filed in June 2010. Higgs further argued the ATRO did not preclude\n\nWilliam's assignment of the proceeds because the assignment constituted payment of\n\nWilliam's attorney fees and costs in the family court proceeding. Saracia opposed the\n\nclaim, asserting in part that William's assignment contravened both the judicial lien and\n\nthe ATRO in the dissolution action.\n\n       In October 2014, the court confirmed its prior findings and order after hearing. It\n\nmade the following additional findings and orders, which the court partly handwrote:\n\n       \"a. The parties agree there is no factual dispute as to the wording and intent of the\n\njudgment;\n\n       \"b. William . . . never had ownership of the funds;\n\n       \"c. A Judicial Lien, or if that term is inappropriate, the appropriate device to\n\nprevent any transfer, encumbrance, or restriction on the ability of the funds to be\n\ntransferred in accordance with the court's [unintelligible] determination as to ownership,\n\nwas placed on the funds in 2008 before the assignment to [Higgs];\n\n       \"d. This Court interprets the Judicial Lien or other appropriate device as an order\n\nthat the funds not be encumbered, transferred, or restricted in any way that would\n\n                                              6\n\ffrustrate the intent of putting the funds in escrow [trust] so that once the Court determines\n\nthe disposition, that the recipient receives the funds right away without any other claims\n\nof ownership;\n\n       \"e. The assignment of the funds to [Higgs] violated the clear intent of the order of\n\nJudicial Lien or other appropriate device;\n\n       \"f. The assignment of the funds to [Higgs] violated the . . . ATRO's[], which\n\nremain in effect until final distribution of all assets in this case;\n\n       \"g. The assignment of the funds to [Higgs] violated the clear intent of the Court's\n\nprior orders entrusting the funds to [Higgs] to hold in its client trust account pending\n\nfurther court order or agreement of the parties;\n\n       \"h. The Court affirms its prior order that the funds are to be released to [Saracia].\n\n       \"i. Counsel for Third-Party Claimant agreed on the record that based on the\n\nCourt's findings Third-Party Claimant has no rights to the funds at issue.\"\n\n       Higgs appeals from the October 2014 order.\n\n                                         DISCUSSION\n\n       Higgs advances several theories as to why the court erred in its order. We need\n\nonly address one: Higgs's contention that the ATRO did not prevent William from\n\nassigning or otherwise transferring his interest in the funds to Higgs. We conclude the\n\ncourt's finding that William's assignment and pledge agreement violated the ATRO is a\n\nsufficient ground by itself to invalidate Higgs's purported interest and affirm the court's\n\norder. The matter is one of statutory construction that we review de novo. (Coker v.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The\n\nATRO's bar both parties from, among other things, \"transferring, encumbering,\n\nhypothecating, concealing, or in any way disposing of any property, real or personal,\n\nwhether community, quasi-community, or separate, without the written consent of the\n\nother party or an order of the court, except in the usual course of business or for the\n\nnecessities of life . . . .\" (§ 2040, subd. (a)(2).)\n\n          Section 2040, subdivision (a)(2) further provides: \"Notwithstanding the\n\nforegoing, nothing in the restraining order shall preclude a party from using community\n\nproperty, quasi-community property, or the party's own separate property to pay\n\nreasonable attorney's fees and costs in order to retain legal counsel in the proceeding. A\n\nparty who uses community property or quasi-community property to pay his or her\n\nattorney's retainer for fees and costs under this provision shall account to the community\n\nfor the use of the property. A party who uses other property that is subsequently\n\ndetermined to be the separate property of the other party to pay his or her attorney's\n\nretainer for fees and costs under this provision shall account to the other party for the use\n\nof the property.\" This provision creates an exception to the ATRO's, permitting a party's\n\n                                                 8\n\fuse of community, quasi-community, or separate property to pay attorney fees and costs\n\nfor retaining legal counsel in their dissolution proceeding.\n\n       There is no dispute that the ATRO's issued in this case, or that the family court\n\nhad ordered the ATRO's to remain effective \"until a final division of all the assets under\n\nthe judgment has been made.\" Rather, pointing to the foregoing exception permitting a\n\nparty to use community property to \"pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs in order to\n\nretain legal counsel in the proceeding\" (§ 2040, subd. (a)(2)), Higgs's sole argument\n\nregarding these orders is that William's assignment constituted payment of his attorney\n\nfees and costs incurred in the divorce proceeding and it was \"therefore . . . valid and not\n\nprecluded by the ATROs.\"4 In its reply brief, Higgs expands on this argument, pointing\n\nout there is no case authority directly on point, but maintaining \"[a]s a matter of logic, the\n\nexception must apply to the payment of ongoing attorneys' fees and costs to keep counsel\n\nretained during the pendency of dissolution. First, attorneys' fees and costs do not arise\n\nbefore litigation commences—i.e., when the client would normally be expected to pay\n\nthe initial retainer. Further, Saracia's argument results in an illogical and impractical\n\nresult: a client in a dissolution proceeding being unable to pay his counsel after payment\n\n\n\n4      Other than this exception, Higgs does not present any other theory as to why\nWilliam's conduct in executing the pledge agreement or assignment falls outside section\n2040. Indeed, the restraining order imposed by the statute prevents a party from\n\"hypothecating . . . or in any way disposing of\" property without the other party's written\nconsent or court order. To \"hypothecate\" is to \"pledge (property) as security or collateral\nfor a debt, without delivery of title or possession.\" (Black's Law Dict. (10th ed. 2014)\np. 861, col. 1.) Nor does Higgs argue William's actions fell within the exception for the\ndisposal of property in the \"usual course of business or for the necessities of life.\"\n(§ 2040, subd. (a)(2); see Gale v.

Section\n\n2040 does not define the phrase \"in order to retain legal counsel in the proceeding\" or\n\ncontain any explanation of its meaning. The statute's plain meaning controls if there is no\n\nambiguity in the statutory language. (Poole v.

But \" ' \"[t]o seek the meaning of a statute is not simply to look up\n\ndictionary definitions and then stitch together the results.

We read the statute \" ' \"with reference to the entire\n\n                                               10\n\fscheme of law of which it is part so that the whole may be harmonized and retain\n\neffectiveness.\" ' \" (Ibid., quoting Horwich v.

We\n\nlook first to the words and phrase used to determine what the Legislature meant for a\n\nparty to use community property \"to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs in order to\n\nretain legal counsel in the proceeding.\" Black's Law Dictionary defines the word \"retain\"\n\nin various ways, including to \"hold in possession or under control\" or to \"keep,\" as well\n\nas \"[t]o hire; to engage for the provision of services (as by a lawyer . . .) . . . .\" (Black's\n\nLaw Dict., supra, p. 1509.) It defines the word \"retainer\" as \"[a] client's authorization for\n\na lawyer to act in a case,\" \"[a] fee that a client pays to a lawyer simply to be available\n\nwhen the client needs legal help during a specified period or on a specified matter\" and\n\nalso \"[a] lump-sum fee paid by the client to engage a lawyer at the outset of a matter.\"\n\n(Ibid.)5 Though these definitions plainly include a party's initial hiring of an attorney,\n\nand the common legal understanding of a retainer is payment for the purpose of hiring,\n\nthey are not limited to that interpretation. Thus, these definitions do not definitively\n\nresolve whether the Legislature intended that specific meaning.\n\n\n\n\n5      The common dictionary definitions are similar. (See Merriam-Webster's\nCollegiate Dict. (11th ed. 2006) p. 1063 [defining \"retain\" as to \"keep in possession or\nuse\" or \"to keep in one's pay or service; specif: to employ by paying a retainer\" and\ndefining \"retainer\" as \"the act of a client by which the services of a lawyer . . . are\nengaged\" or \"a fee paid to a lawyer or professional adviser for advice or services or for a\nclaim on services when needed\"].)\n                                               11\n\f       Where the statute's language is inconclusive, we turn to other extrinsic aids in\n\ninterpretation, including legislative history. (State of California v. Altus Finance, S.A.,\n\nsupra, 36 Cal.4th at p. 1296 [\"Because the language of the statute does not answer the\n\nquestion before us, ' \"we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible\n\nobjects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, . . . and the\n\nstatutory scheme of which the statute is a part\" ' \"].) Doing so reveals that the legislative\n\nhistory of section 2040 is dispositive on the question in Saracia's favor.\n\n       Family Code section 2040, subdivision (a) continued former Code of Civil\n\nProcedure section 412.21, which provided \"for the automatic granting of restraining\n\norders with the issuance and service of a summons in an action for dissolution or\n\nannulment of a marriage, [and] for legal separation.\" (Legis. Counsel's Dig., Assem. Bill\n\nNo. 1905 (1989-1990 Reg. Sess.) 4 Stats. 1989, Summary Dig., p. 415; Stats. 1994, ch.\n\n1269, § 13.) In 1999, the Legislature amended section 2040, subdivision (a)(2) to \"cure\n\nan anomaly in current law which prevents a party in a dissolution proceeding from using\n\nhis or her own separate property to pay attorney's fees and costs incurred in retaining\n\nlegal counsel.\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 357 (1999–2000 Reg.\n\nSess.) as amended Mar. 18, 1999.) Thus, the Legislature proposed to include a party's\n\nuse of quasi-community property and separate property within the above exception for\n\npayment of reasonable attorney fees in order to retain counsel. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary,\n\ncom. on Sen. Bill No. 357 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 18, 1999.) The\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee's analysis states that \"the restraining order . . . is intended to\n\npreserve the community assets and to prevent waste or concealment of property that may\n\n                                              12\n\fotherwise be determined to belong to the community.\" (Ibid.) However, the use of the\n\nproperty for the exception for payment of attorney fees is \"restricted to attorney's fees and\n\ncosts to retain legal counsel.\" (Ibid.) The committee analysis states, \"The original intent\n\nof existing law in allowing use of community property for payment of attorney's fees is to\n\nfacilitate a party's ability to retain legal counsel. Thus, the exception is allowed only for\n\nthe purpose of retaining legal counsel. [¶] This bill would similarly allow the use of\n\nquasi-community or separate property only for payment of attorney's fees and costs in\n\norder to retain legal counsel. [¶] Additional expenses for attorney's fees and costs can be\n\ntaken care of by applying to the court for an order for such expenditures.\" (Ibid., italics\n\nadded.)\n\n       In its analysis, the Senate Judiciary Committee addressed a comment by the State\n\nBar's family law section, which proposed \"further amendments that would permit\n\nunilateral use of community, quasi-community and separate property to pay attorney's\n\nfees and costs beyond the retainer fee that would be permitted under this bill,\" so as to\n\nreduce the number of hearings in family court. The committee observed that such an\n\nexpansion \"could, in some cases, cause diminishment of community assets.\" (Sen. Com.\n\non Judiciary, com. on Sen. Bill No. 357 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 18,\n\n1999.) It made clear that attorney fees and costs beyond the retainer fee could be taken\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\fcare of by court order, or existing law requiring an advanced five days notice to the other\n\nparty of any \"extraordinary expenditures\" with an accounting to the court. (Ibid.)6\n\n       The legislative analyses of the subdivision (a)(2) exception to the ATRO's within\n\nsection 2040 demonstrate that in using the phrase \"in order to retain legal counsel in the\n\nproceeding,\" the Legislature referred to the initial hiring of counsel, and not fees and\n\ncosts incurred thereafter to maintain counsel in the action, which must be approved by\n\ncourt order or other mechanism with notice to the other party in the proceeding. This\n\nconstruction comports with the purpose of the ATRO's to prevent the waste or\n\nconcealment of community assets by a party to pay ongoing legal fees in a dissolution\n\n\n\n6      More fully, the Senate Judiciary Committee analysis states: \"Existing law requires\nadvanced 5-days' notice to the other party of any 'extraordinary expenditures' and requires\nan accounting to the court of such expenditures. Attorney's fees and costs beyond the\nretainer fee can be taken care of under this 'extraordinary expenditures' provision, or by\nobtaining a court order. [¶] The suggested expansion of the bill would circumvent the\nexisting mechanism by which the court monitors 'extraordinary expenditures,' i.e., those\nbeyond the usual course of business and for the necessities of life. Thus, while perhaps\nreducing the number of hearings at which authorization for further use of community,\nquasi-community or separate property is requested, the suggestion made by the State Bar\nFamily Law Section would allow attorneys to charge fees and costs without regard to the\naccounting requirements of the court and without prior notice to the other party of the use\nof community or quasi-community assets.\" (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, com. on Sen. Bill\nNo. 357 (1999-2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 18, 1999.)\n       We observe that other committee analyses support the conclusion that the\nLegislature used the terms \"retain\" and \"retainer\" to refer to the initial hiring of counsel in\nthe proceeding. (See Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Sen. Bill No. 357 (1999-\n2000 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 18, 1999 [stating in a \"summary\" that the bill\n\"[a]llows a party to a dissolution to use or encumber that party's separate property or\nquasi-community property to hire an attorney in a dissolution proceeding, and requires\nthe party to account for that use\" and also stating, \"The author introduced this bill to\ncorrect what seems to be an oversight in the law and ensure that neither party to a\ndissolution proceeding is unnecessarily deprived of adequate representation\"], italics\nadded.)\n                                              14\n\fproceeding, beyond the initial retainer. Finally, William's reading of the statute as\n\npermitting the payment of any ongoing attorney fees and costs after the initial hiring of\n\ncounsel would eliminate or render superfluous the phrase \"in order to retain legal counsel\n\nin the proceeding\" from the statute, violating basic tenets of statutory construction.\n\n(Tuolumne Jobs & Small Business Alliance v.

As a consequence, the assignment and corresponding\n\npledge agreement was voidable on Saracia's motion. A transfer of property in violation\n\nof an injunction is voidable. (See, e.g., Powell v.

The treatise cited by Higgs explains\nthat such a lien against a future award or settlement is contractual, and \"may only be\nenforced by counsel in an independent action against the client (counsel has no right to\nintervene in the main action to establish the amount of the lien or enforce it).\"\n(Hogoboom & King, Cal.

The treatise additionally emphasizes that \"charging liens may not be enforced\nduring pendency of the proceedings . . . .\" (Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice Guide:\nFamily Law, supra, ¶ 1:285, some italics added.) Finally the treatise warns about ethical\nimplications of taking a secured promissory note for fees, as Higgs did here: \"Counsel\nmay ethically accept the client's unsecured promissory note in payment of fees; this\narrangement violates no public policy because, if a fee dispute arises, the attorney may\nenforce the note against the client's assets only through a judicial proceeding where the\ncourt will scrutinize the fairness of the transaction. . . . But taking a secured promissory\nnote from a client is a far different matter[.]\" (Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice Guide:\nFamily Law, supra, ¶ 1:287.) One such problem recognized by the authors is the concern\nover the ATRO's. (Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice Guide: Family Law, supra, ¶ 1:300\net seq.) They point out, with respect to a real property lien, that \"[a] family law attorney's\nreal property lien given before commencement of the proceeding would, of course, not\nimplicate the § 2040(a)(2) TRO. Likewise, though § 2040(a)(2) does not expressly\nexempt a § 2033 lien, the statute's broad exemption for the payment of attorney fees and\ncosts to 'retain' legal counsel in the proceeding (above) should protect enforceability of\nsuch a lien after the TRO is in effect. This seems especially true once the court passes on\nthe validity of the lien pursuant to §§ 2033 and 2034 . . . . [See . . . § 2040(a)(2)—TRO\nbars unilateral encumbrance without court order].\" (Hogoboom & King, Cal. Practice\nGuide: Family Law, supra, ¶ 1:300.) William's assignment and pledge of a secured\ninterest in the insurance proceeds, given after commencement of the proceeding and not\nfor the purpose of paying an initial retainer, gives rise to these concerns.\n\n                                             16\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n\n      The order is affirmed.
